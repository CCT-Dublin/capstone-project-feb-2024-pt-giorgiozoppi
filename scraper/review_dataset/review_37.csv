37,Horrible Not Recommended for Price,"Who is writing positive reviews? This place is sub par especially for $400 per night. Reception was under staffed on a Thursday in October? The room is run down to say the least. We had to carry our own bags to the room. Not like a huge deal but compared to the Melias we stayed at this week in Madrid and Seville, this place is a dump in comparison. Unless you’re desperate- I would never recommend staying here.",1,2024,10,10
37,Good hotel in Las Ramblas area,"First time at the Meridien as it was picked by my friend who I was traveling with.   Arrived early morning and my room wasn't ready but my friend's was, so dumped by bags in his room.   Hotel is right along the Ramblas so great if you are a tourist.   Plenty of food options close by.

Had a basic room and small upgrade (Titanium member).   My room was quiet and comfortable with a king sized bed.  Room was still small 

Breakfast was complimentary and quite good every morning.

I did try communicating with the concierge a few weeks prior to arrival to get some info.   Not sure why but they were poor in getting back to me (days to get a response).   

Overall a very good stay.",4,2024,10,02
37,Great Stay at Le Meriden.,"Perfect location walking distance to beach,shops, restaurants and the Gothic district.  Very good breakfast included with our stay. Our waiter Fouad was very friendly and made a perfect start to our day. Easy check in and staff was very friendly",5,2024,08,26
37,Charm city and good quality of food spicily  Patatas bravas was the icon dish to my kids,Staff from check in until check out was corporate at all times. All the help I asked for was provided and all my family's requirements were met. Also location is excellent and convenient to all activities around Rumbla and shopping centers in Barcelona,5,2024,08,20
37,Wonderful time in Barcelona!,"We had a great time staying at this hotel. We booked a suite which had an amazing view of the city. The suite was quite spacious for our family of 4. The service at this hotel was excellent with the room service coming in multiple times a day. As others have mentioned, the hotel is in a prime location in Las Ramblas with many tourist attractions in walking distance. Special shout out to the amazing concierge and front desk team, they made excellent suggestions for restaurants and helped with getting reservations, this made all the difference in our trip!",5,2024,08,14
37,Not a five star hotel,"We are currently still at this hotel unfortunately but our hands are tied as we are only in Barcelona for a few days prior to a cruise. For the record, this is not a five star hotel. The lobby carpets are filthy and sofas/ pillows very worn. They have a bunch of 20 year olds with clearly not enough hospitality industry experience running the front desk, so be warned your problem will not be resolved. The only thing 5 star is the location at las Ramblas. That part is very convenient. We arrived from the US at around 9 AM fully aware that our hotel room would not be ready. One of two rooms was available so my in-laws were able to check in but our room was not so we patiently waited around town for several hours until about 1 o’clock, then returned to the lobby to check if the room was ready and it was not. We understood that 3 o’clock is the guaranteed check in time so we expected to be getting our keys at three. That was not the case . It still wasn’t ready until close to 3:30.  The language barrier makes it difficult to convey frustration but my face does not. We are long time bonvoy members and should have at least gotten an upgrade. We finally get our keys and check in. A few hours later, we go out to see a show and return back to the room to find that my son’s rollaway bed has been completely unmade and stripped with no explanation.  when we called about it, they seem to be aware of it and alleged that request was made an error, but it seems pretty suspicious.  I don’t know what’s going on with this hotel but it certainly does not meet the standards for any Marriott I’ve ever stayed at. Save the money and go somewhere else. .",2,2024,08,09
37,Awesome location and great service,"This hotel saved the day, we had a house booked and when we showed up it was not as advertised and we left and showed up to this hotel with no reservations and the GM and Front desk went above and beyond beyond to get us taken care off. The hotel is located close to the main areas and subway. The breakfast was great",5,2024,07,30
37,Great Hotel and Staff in a Great Location,"This hotel was excellent in all aspects.  The location was great, right by La Rambla...lots of nearby shops and restaurants...as well as a full service grocery store around the corner.  The hotel itself was extremely well kept up.  Our rooms (we had three)  -  which appear to have been renovated within the last year or two were great.  While not large, they were certainly large enough (and larger than most European hotels), well appointed, comfortable and with fantastic showers.   They cleaned the room everyday and did a great job.  The staff was tremendous...everyone, and I mean everyone was extremely friendly, polite, courteous,  and helpful at all times with any request.  From the doormen to housekeeping to reception to the manager, they were all wonderful.   The breakfast buffet was also quite good and the price reasonable.  Overall, a great stay where we felt welcomed at all times.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,29
37,Look Elsewhere. Run don’t walk,"I am currently staying at this hotel and it has been one thing after the other. The first room we were assigned how a damp/smoky smell to it. We called the front desk and they decommissioned the room. The quickly found us a replacement which lacked the view we had originally booked but we didn’t complain. I was hoping the mishaps would have stopped them but they didn’t. The room we were put in has a very odd layout - shower, no bath, front room with nothing in it. The shower doesn’t have a curb and the drain was clogged. We had water spilling out of the bathroom into the walkway. 

I had to call for service twice. Each time, it’s a recording and then finally someone live answers the phone. We went to check out the spa and there was a sign saying no technician was on staff.

The hotel simply is not up to Marriott standards. There is absolutely no way this is a five-star hotel. I have no clue how this received a traveler’s choice award. Avoid this dingy, rundown hotel at all costs.",2,2024,07,11
37,Nice hotel stay away from rooms in the front,"The hotel staff were very pleasant when we arrived and check in was easy. We were told we have a room overlooking the street, we thought that was good. Well the street never quiets down so sleep was tough, so I would request an interior room away from the street. The rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. We were not told of any of the hotels amenities upon check in. Overall nice hotel but didn’t like our room location",4,2024,07,11
37,Don’t stay here!,"I am very disappointed that I picked this hotel amongst the many in Barcelona. There is absolutely NO WAY  this is a 5 star property, not even a 4. The rooms are in really rough shape!!! The smell so bad, bed is worn out, drains are clogged, the list goes on. 

Now I need to take so blame here. I booked due to the location…. And the what a huge mistake.  It is located directly in the tourist zone, which I would highly recommend against. Move out a mile or so to have a true Barcelona experience. 

My guess is Marriott loyalists are the only ones who book here… and I am telling you it’s not worth it. If you are dead set on staying in the heart of it all check out the Kimpton… 

Okay… the only positive.  Alex the BellMan is truly amazing!!",2,2024,07,08
37,"Great location, nice shower!","The convenience of the hotel was great, as was our quiet room.  Bedroom was spacious but very plain, lots of pillows, which was a plus.  Front desk and porters were really friendly and helpful.  Wonderful shower with lots of water pressure.  Restaurant was ok, not very atmospheric, we didn't have breakfast there, but instead wandered to the Boqueria, just around the corner.",4,2024,06,29
37,Outstanding service.,"The location, the staff, and the rooms were fantastic.  All of the staff we met were incredibly helpful, they gave great restaurant suggestions off of La Rambla.  It was a great location to easily access all that Barcelona offers.  The hotel was beautiful.",5,2024,06,24
37,Disappointed,"As loyal Marriott Bonvoy members, my husband and I always try to stay in a Marriott when we travel.  This is probably the 1st negative review I’ve ever given, since the experience was definitely not 5 star. We originally were booked into the Hotel 1898 across the street after reading all of the wonderful reviews about that hotel.  Since my husband was part of an F1 package, they switched us to Le Méridien. Our 5 night stay was average. Should have stayed at Hotel 1898.

Pros:
- Great location right off La Rambla
- Quiet if you are in an interior room
- Friendly staff & good housekeeping

Cons:
- Felt like, as Americans, we were being nickel & dimed for things
- Poor managerial decision to charge us for the same room service order twice since there was a misunderstanding about where the food was to be delivered.  When we ordered from the “Terrace” menu, we expected the order to be delivered to the Terrace, not our room.  Rather than leave the food outside our room
when we realized where it had been delivered, management decided that the food needed to be remade and redelivered, thereby charging us twice.  Not cool Marriott.
- Spa and services very outdated & not 5 star.  Outside vitality “pool” is just a oversized warm bathtub 

If you are truly expecting an upscale experience, reconsider staying here.",3,2024,06,24
37,"A stylish hotel with a great ""vibe"" and perfect location for walking in Barcelona","Le Meridien, is a very nice hotel in a perfect location for walking vacationers. Alongside the centrally located La Rambla pedestrian walkway and a block from the famous Mercat Boqueria, it's so easy to walk to the major museums and beaches in Barcelona. The hotel is very clean, with stylish rooms and very comfortable beds. We found the bilingual staff to be very helpful and positive in their interactions with guests.  The breakfast buffet was excellent, with many tasty selections to choose from. The pastries were exceptional, very freshly baked and generously presented. We enjoyed afternoon drinks and snacks in the lounge - people were having a good time all around. Overall, a fantastic location and better than expected hotel amenities and service... will book again when in Barcelona",5,2024,06,21
37,Top hotel in Barcelona,"Le Méridien Barcelona exceeded all expectations during our recent stay. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring every need was met promptly and with a smile. The hotel's location is unbeatable, right in the heart of the city, allowing easy access to Barcelona's famous landmarks and vibrant neighborhoods.

The room itself was luxurious and beautifully appointed, with modern amenities and a stunning view of the cityscape. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep after exploring the city.

Dining at the hotel was a highlight; the breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious options, catering to all tastes.

Overall, Le Méridien Barcelona combines elegance with exceptional service, making it the ideal choice for anyone looking to experience the best of Barcelona in style.",5,2024,06,17
37,Great location in the heart of it all,"Just left an amazing stay at Le Meridien Barcelona. 

From the beginning, the staff were all amazing, from the doormen, to the front desk, the restaurants, all the way to housekeeping. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating, going out of their way to assist and make sure we had a great stay. 

We had suite 817 for our kids and my wife and I stayed in suite 812 which has a great balcony over the Ramblas",5,2024,06,17
37,A two star rating for a three star service,"It hurts me to leave this rating, especially because I am a Bonvoy Gold Elite Member, but our two nights stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary was absolutely disappointing. The gentleman at check-in was absolutely cold and stressed and did not ask for anything other then our passports and credit card. He gave us our room key and sent us on our ways, not even asking if we need help with our luggage. After a quick question which room type was assigned, he responded: Standard, we are full. When entering room 436, there was garbage under the red armchair and the room was poorly cleaned. The room was dated and worn down, but ok. 3 star hotel-niveau to be generous. But ok, we booked this category ourselves. When we came back in the evening, we let the receptionist know (blonde hair, very friendly!) about the garbage in our room. She made 40 % up for the rather harsh welcome and was very friendly. She also sent us a bottle of cava, but neither my wife nor I drink. Anyhow. Breakfast next morning was very crowded and average at max, that‘s why we did not attend breakfast the 2nd day, even though included. The check out again was absolutely horrific. First, a false invoice was printed (no taxes included). After cashing in, the receptionist asked for an additional EUR 110.-. Then, as goodbye, no one asked whether we liked our stay or if we needed a taxi or any help. If this was a 3 star hotel, I would have rated the stay 4-5 stars. But since this is a five star hotel and I am a member of their status program, two stars is absolutely fair. I would not chose Le Meridien Barcelona ever again. But I of course know, that my rating makes no different, because all the passangers from the cruise ships will frequent this hotel either way.",2,2024,06,02
37,Great Service & Perfect Location!,"This has got to be the best service I have ever received at a Le Meridien.   The staff really goes above and beyond to make sure your stay here great.  Every staff member was a pleasure to meet and all were friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable and helpful.   The staff here at the Le Meridien Barcelona is truly amazing!

Location!  The hotel is also in perfect spot in Barcelona on the famous La Rambla.  It is walking distance to many main attractions and shopping. 

Rooms, they have many different categories of room, but we had a Corner Suite on the 6th floor and the view from the Corner Suite was amazing, we could see all the way to the ocean and La Sagrada Familia.  We also had a standard room on the 5th floor, this room was one of their older rooms that has not been remodeled yet, but it was still pretty nice and has been maintained well.  The basic room was pretty spacious as well.

Overall, I would not hesitate to stay at Le Meridien Barcelona again.",5,2024,06,02
37,Good city centre hotel,"A very nice business class hotel. 
Not cheap but great location in city centre right on Las Ramblas. Nice walk into centre or down to Marina. 

Stayed just 1 night. Good experience. The room was well equipped. Nice bathroom and very comfortable bed. Small sofa and desk provided. Plenty of light options and mirrors.  Bathrobes and slippers etc. 

Slight noise issue early hours of the morning (from another guest in nearby room) but no street noise as I was on the side of hotel. 

Breakfast was really good plenty of choice and pastries delicious. Friendly staff especially Reinaldo in the bar. Great hot chocolate and espresso martini. Gracias!",4,2024,05,21
37,The best hotel in Barcelona,"The Hotel is absolutely incredible and modern. It has one of the best locations, close to shops, bars and restaurants, museums and the metro station. The view is enchanting and the staff is very welcoming and makes the experience unique! I will definitely come back and recommend it!",5,2024,05,10
37,Inconsistent services across the board !  Avoid the up sell to a ‘suite’.,"Right off the bat, location is the ONLY draw of this property!  Service level is not 5 star, more like 4 star.  
First, the 4 bottles of water allotment for our Family Suite is so frustrating because it fluctuates from day to day.  Out of the 7 nights we were there, we got it left in the room maybe 30% of the time?  Calling to get it delivered is a frustrating ‘task’ when you are tired at the end of the day when u return to your room!  Explanations from staff of how to get it consistently is a convoluted exercise that we finally gave up!    
We were up sell to a Family Suite for 150 euros more per night, which makes our per night rate well over 500 euros.  At this rate, the product we received is DEFINITELY not worth the price!  
I would suggest if you NEED to stay on the Rambla, get the lowest possible rate at this property, ie 300-350 euros max!  
We are going to try the Renaissance next time we are in Barcelona as it is in a nice low key neighborhood, right by the luxury shopping boulevard.
I do have to give a big thank you for most of the front door staff as they are always welcoming !  Upon arrival, we were almost victim of the ‘distract and grab’ thieves, one of the staff ran towards us and grabbed a few of our bags to quickly get us into the property, thus warding off a potential disaster!",3,2024,05,09
37,Excellent in Every Way!,"We stayed in 4 hotels on this recent European adventure; a Hilton in Boston and three Marriott brands in France and Spain and while the Hilton wasn’t special, this location was no exception to the previous two Marriott’s (the Aix-en-Provence Renaissance and the Prince de Galles Luxury Collection in Paris)… We were checked in with a very enthusiastic lady who was very helpful, making suggestions and going through the entire checklist during check-in, including acknowledging status, telling us about the property, times for breakfast, the spa, etc.  On this stay we were upgraded to one of their amazing suites which come with a king bed and a huge veranda.  The patio was the size of most king size hotel rooms, offering lounge chairs for sunning yourself and a full outdoor shower to clean up, couches, etc to enjoy being outside, while still in your hotel room.  

The room itself was very comfy, cozy, yet extremely spacious and well laid-out.  The bathroom had double sinks and a large double closet area as well.  It had a huge soaker tub, as well a separate shower.  The only issue I had was that the shower was combine in the same glass-doored water closet as the toilet, and though the first third of the floor under the shower was sloped towards the drain, water still got over to the toilet and that just looks and feel gross.  They could have designed this slightly better to not have one common floor in such a manner.  But, honestly that’s my only complaint about the entire stay and it’s extremely minor in the grand scheme of things, as the rest of the stay, the people at this hotel, and the area were spectacular!!

They have a large staff in the lobby ensuring we’re safe and all questions are answered at all times.  Their front desk is always staff with at least 2 people, I typically saw 4 there and they’re all concierge and can help with anything, from questions to buying tickets, cabs, directions, etc.

The location is perfect for walking to nearly everything!  There are tons of great places to eat literally across the street or within a block, as well as quick walks to more eateries, tourists sites, shopping, etc.

Highly recommend staying here!",5,2024,05,07
37,Wonderful experience!,"My family of four just stayed at this wonderful hotel for four nights. We chose it because of its great location right on Las Ramblas. We booked 2 rooms and I used an upgrade award hoping to receive a better room for one of the reservations. (My husband is a Bonvoy platinum lifetime member). We arrived before checkin time but we were able to get our rooms. Our room was upgraded to a Corner Suite which was incredible. We had a comfortable bedroom with king bed and a large living area with a huge sofa bed (that converts, I believe to two twin size beds), chairs, desks, and floor-to-ceiling windows that look on the main Avenue. The bathroom was huge and the suite had a second half bath. All 4 of us could have stayed in this room comfortably because it also had privacy doors that would close off the bedroom from the living area. We heard a bit of noise but the double windows and thick drapery block most out. My adult children were very happy with their double twin-bedded room as well. Breakfast for 2 was included due to our loyalty with Marriott; the buffet had everything you could possibly imagine. Hotel is close to the Gothic quarter and historical areas. It is also very close to a couple Metro stations (Liceu and Catalunya).  A cab rank is also outside the hotel and we found cabs to be very reasonable. There is also a supermarket around the corner for any necessities. We went to a couple great restaurants nearby - Alegoria and Rao. Staff we encountered were always professional. Recommend for a Barcelona stay!",5,2024,05,07
37,Incredible hotel,"Wow! Highly recommend Le Meridien in Barcelona. Stunning, modern and tranquil hotel in the centre of Barcelona just off La Rambles. Ignore any negative reviews, this place is incredible. Spacious, modern, quiet rooms just a stones throw from the hustle and bustle of the city. Perfectly placed for the metro and tourist buses, and walking distance from the superb harbour. Amazing buffet breakfast. Staff were attentive and happy to help with any questions. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else!",5,2024,05,06
37,"Great location, buffet breakfast and front desk, marred by housekeeping","I stayed 4 nights. Redeemed suite awards. Upgraded to family suite. 
Had to climb over bath tub into shower in tiny bathroom. Great fall risk.
Changed to a suite was with a proper bathroom with separate shower and bath tub.
First suite was renovated and modern, second suite was old, dark with dirty carpet.

Front desk staff extremely helpful. Helped call Turkish Airlines and Barcelona Airport lost luggage for my delayed luggage.

Buffet breakfast was nice. With sparkling wine.

But housekeeping staff really needed improvement. Did not top up coffee capsules or tissue paper, or replace bathrobe. Second suite had to glasses for water. Had to keep asking for complimentary bottled water.",4,2024,04,30
37,"Beautiful property, lovely staff!","We chose Le Meriden Barcelona for our first visit to the city because it was near Las Ramblas with easy transportation and walking distance to many sights.  We were not disappointed. We loved being in the middle of everything!   As a Bonvoy Titanium Elite member, I was able to use NUA to upgrade to a very spacious room with a gorgeous deck.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious.  Staff was courteous and accommodating.  This hotel was the perfect place for us for a first time, but not last, visit to Barcelona!",5,2024,04,15
37,Very central hotel,"Very centrally located; can't beat the proximity to everything you'd want to see in central Barcelona. I didn't get upgraded much as a titanium member, probably just one category up. The breakfast also was okay; I was hoping for something better for $300+ a night. They had made to order eggs which was nice along with some croquettes, but I was bored of the breakfast by the third day. The AC was also very weird; the first day it didn't seem like it worked at all and by the third day it was way strong. The fire alarm in my room also kept blinking red at night which was annoying me in my sleep. The front desk said all the rooms were like this?",4,2024,04,10
37,Le Meridien- Great hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Great hotel in a central location of the city on the Gothic Quarter.  We were able to get a slightly earlier check in than the standard 3pm at around 1:30. It was a convenient location - an easy walk to most sites and easy access to the metro to get to further out places like La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell. The hotel was exceptionally clean with great service. We ate at the hotel restaurant our last night due to weather and a long day, and it was good food, esp the oxtail croquettes. ",5,2024,03,31
37,"Great hotel, but lack of sleep marked down the score .","Stayed for 3 nights. Check-in was good very smooth and great at front desk. room, perhaps need some upgrading but my biggest problem was that there was no Aircon and sleeping with the window open meant being woken up at 5 am by the Taxi people talking very loudly outside the window. This is well-known by the hotel however nothing can be done about it. It was so noisy. It was like they  were in my room and I was on floor five. Beware these Taxi people also only want to take you to the airport. If you go outside the hotel and ask to go anywhere else. They will simply send you a 5 to 7 minute walk to a different rank.. not great when you're running late for a meeting. 

Restaurant are used on one occasion, Food was lovely , and the servers were great. The pasta was exceptionally good.

Use the gym again adequate for a hotel, really quiet and good equipment. 

The only reason I have marked it as a three is due to the poor sleep  💤 as for me, that's the most important thing when staying at a hotel for Work. 

I know March is winter in Spain, but you need to give people the autonomy to choose their own air-conditioning regardless of the season .",3,2024,03,18
37,Nice hotel in good location but no local charm,"This is a nice hotel and a good location right along La Rambla. In fact, it’s pretty much in the middle of everything in Barcelona - easy walking distance to the Gothic quarter and also to Gaudi’s houses. What is not walkable is easily reached by metro with a station very close. 

The only reason I did not give the hotel a five star rating is it was so typical of nice Marriott properties and did not have much of a local feel. If an American style large hotel is what you are looking for, then this hotel will suit you fine. I actually prefer a smaller, more authentic hotel when in Europe. 

The room I had was nice. Bright, clean and fairly large. It had a nice bathroom and good amount of closet space. Nepresso machine and frig stocked with mini bar items were also in the room. 

I did have breakfast at the restaurant both mornings. It was a breakfast buffet with typical offerings and the food was fine. Service was not great but not horrible either.  The book ahead price was not ridiculously high compared to m au places I’ve stayed. 

Overall my stay was good, but I did regret a little that I’d left the conference hotel i had been in.  The Meridian did not meet the very high bar that establishment had set!",4,2024,03,10
37,Came for conference and stayed a day more,"While the Rambla has an amazing selection of places to stay and eat, the facilities and service this hotel provides, plus the location, make it a sensible choice for a stay. Exceptional staff, brilliant service, great experience and time.",5,2024,03,06
37,Great place in Barcelona,"This Hotel is perfectly placed and in the best and vibrant place in Barcelona .The rooms are exceptional and the Hotel restaurant is great.. The staff are friendly and  extremely efficient. We had special requests and Salvadore , Maroua , Shina and Alba and the rest of the front desk staff worked amazingly efficiently to make it all happen. It functions and has the advantages of a top branded Hotel but with the intimate service and help that special boutique Hotels are famous for . Overall this is a great place and it made our stay special . Will go back !!",5,2024,02,17
37,A night to somewhat remember!,"We love exploring Marriot hotels and during our stay in Barcelona, we stayed at the W for the first night and the Le Meridien on the second just for hotel hopping. Our stay was great that's why I'm posting a different review for the hotel experience and the experience we had at the restaurant of this hotel which is called CentOnze Restaurant. We love Marriot and we appreciate the service they provide around the globe. I would like to say thanks to Monica for arranging a bottle of champagne for my husband and I's anniversary. Barcelona was my anniversary gift for him and I prepaid the hotels for a reason. What I didn't expect was the experience from CentOnze restaurant which I couldn't forsee. Nevertheless, our stay was good and we'll definitely come back to stay but not to dine. Thank you Monica for a wonderful evening recovery.",5,2024,01,14
37,Amazing hotel and  great location,"We had a sush great stay on this amazong hotel  and specially the  GREAT location , helpful staff clean rooms and beautiful lobby, the spa and the terrace upstairs unfortunately are very small, but this is not a big issue we will come back for sure",5,2024,01,06
37,A must stay in the heart of Barcelona,"We had an extremely pleasant stay at the Le Meridien in the heart of Barcelona. Prior to checking in, I assumed that the location will be the main highlight of this hotel but rooms and service would not be. However, our room was one of the largest we stayed in Spain and the service was impeccable. Maura from reception was exceptional - she not only waived the extra person fee ($80 per person per night) but also assigned is an excellent room because we were waiting patiently as the rooms were not ready. The room felt big in spite of us being three with a teenage daughter. It was modern and quite high tech with Bluetooth speakers and streaming smartTV. The bathroom was well appointed too. The location of course is the key point for this hotel - pretty much everything is walkable. It is definitely a must stay in Barcelona. ",5,2024,01,05
37,Worst hotel stay - dirty and run down,"While it was convenient location, this is one of the most run down hotels I have stayed at.  The carpet is dirty and gross and the sofa is frayed.  And the bed was horrible.   When I brought this to the attention of the front desk, they did not acknowledge or apologize.  Should stay away not only because it was dirty but way overpriced",2,2024,01,02
37,Great holiday getaway,"Extremely classy hotel with great service, excellent location, and delicious food. Room we had was very ample for family of four with beautiful views of city. Quiet even though situated in heart of action. Worth the price. Choose room carefully in terms of beds and view.",5,2024,01,01
37,"Nice hotel very central in Barcelona, quite expensive though","We decided to come to Spain and Portugal due to the mild climate in December and very little rain. Stayed here from Dec 24 to Dec 27 (during Christmas) and throughout the stay, it was gorgeous and very sunny outside. 

The place is located very centrally. However, it is quite expensive, but the reason for booking is because we wanted to stay walking distance from the central part of where the Hop on and Hop off tourist buses begin/end. That convenience factor was there. 

Mrs. Sasitorn checked us in and was very cordial and able to assist us with anything we had. Another staff was helpful especially on Christmas Day when we wanted to get some tickets for the tour bus. 

First room we got was room 115, which was big and had a lot of space, but the bathroom with a walk in shower did not have a door and hence it got flooded. Not something we liked and asked to switch rooms and they did with no hesitation.

Second room we got was 137 which had the walk in shower but enclosed with a door. The nice thing is even if you book with 3 guests, they still give you a 3rd sofa bed, maybe that's the standard in Europe. Bed (both sofa bed and normal bed) were extremely comfortable all of the nights. Shower had a lot of good pressure. 

Breakfast was a buffet, lot of good selection, though the waffles were a little too sweet to my liking. The Spanish omelette and churros were great to try for breakfast, overall enjoyed it. 

Overall, a great place if your intention is to stay central to the bus stops or metro station for touring Barcelona. However, if you are concerned about price, not the best bet. ",5,2023,12,31
37,"Great location, Great Stay Pre-Cruise","We arrived at this hotel just before check in and our room wasn't ready.  We did walk around the city a bit to burn time and the hotel held our luggage for us.  The area that the hotel is in was great.  Right off La Ramblas and close to the very large open market.  We got into our room fairly late, after check in time because they weren't ready for us. The room was very big.  We had a family suite that was room with a king size bed and nice size bathroom.  The other part of the room was also giant. Had a couch that folded out to two separate twin sized beds. Perfect for my two kids.  They provided some extra touches for us which were really nice (draw string bags for the kids and waterproof cell phone holders).  We had flown in from the states so we did go to bed fairly early (around 7pm) and around 9pm we heard a knock at the door.  They were delivering a bottle of champagne!!  Although we did not drink it, we did take it with us on our cruise!  Our stay included breakfast in the restaurant downstair and this was our first experience with a European breakfast.  It did NOT disappoint!  It was delicious.  We would definitely stay here again if we were in Barcelona.  Actually, we found out after we got back that our next door neighbors were there at that location two months earlier and loved it!!!",5,2023,12,28
37,Overcharged,"What a shameful scam! This hotel lists itself as 5 stars and charges accordingly. The rooms, however, more resemble a 3 star pension. Don't pay these ridiculous prices to stay here. Meredien used to be a heaven. Marriott has ruined this too-as they did with Westin and Sheraton.  Sheets not changed after 3 nights. Look elsewhere for a real 4 or 5 star property.",2,2023,12,22
37,"Very Comfortable, Accommodating and Great Location","Absolutely no complaints about this hotel.  Can't ask for better location on Las Ramblas.  I requested an early check in since we were arriving early.  (8 a.m.)  The reception checked our luggage, gave us a map and directions to the Hop On/Hop Off bus and told us they would call when our room was ready. They gave us a call very close to noon.  The hotel has a nice coffee shop with small bites in the lobby.  Nice choices and wonderful coffee.  The lobby is attractive with neutral colored decor.  Doormen very helpful. Friday the lobby was very full all day.  The hotel is popular with the cruise people leaving on Saturday cruises.  Our room was large, clean, and adequately furnished although the decor is minimalist.  Toilet and bathroom good size and water jets in shower powerful!  Very nice in-room coffee selection.  Comfortable beds and bedding.  Hotel has popular restaurant judging from its occupancy.  We had desserts and coffee there but no meal.  The restaurant faces Las Ramblas, the entrance to the hotel is on a side street off Las Ramblas.  The hotel is within walking distance of marinas and waterfront, and is also located just a few blocks from the famous La Boqueria Market.",5,2023,12,14
37,SO Very Nice!,"Stayed 2 nights over a weekend and the hotel could not have been nicer!
Very comfortable room with two beds. Was afraid they would be twins, but they were bigger than that. Small window but the interior lighting was generous so we were never squinting to see. Very nice, up to date bathroom and lots of places to plug in electronics. 
Location: just on the edge of the gothic quarter, we walked everywhere. Great restaurants just around the corner, and the hotel has a generous breakfast buffet. 
Check in was smooth, and the ladies behind the desk extremely nice and accommodating.
Highly recommend!

Would highly",5,2023,12,11
37,"Great location, superb breakfast and unexpectedly amazing service!","Great location, excellent breakfast and superb service
Right in middle of all the action; La Ramblas, Gothic Quarter, Plaça de Catalunya, etc. Breakfast is really awesome with variety of spread and service is definitely one of the best. If location is your criteria, look no further.",5,2023,12,08
37,Great Location,"This is our second time in Barcelona and our first time at the Le Meridien.  Here is a brief summary of the advantages of this hotel:
Great Location:  Right on the Las Ramblas, 2 blocks from La Boqueria, short walk to Barri Gotic, short cab ride to cruise port.
Very Nice Room:  Surprisingly quiet considering we were right on the Las Ramblas on Halloween.
Great Breakfast Buffet:  Great selection and made to order eggs/omelets.
Relaxing Bar:  Nice bar to have a drink and mingle with friends at the end of the day.

Very nice stay at this hotel.  Can't beat the location, quick walk to great shopping, such as shoes and belts.  Were able to go to La Boqueria multiple times because it is just a 5 minute walk away.

Would highly recommend and I will stay here again when we return to Barcelona. ",5,2023,11,24
37,Excellent in every way.  Highly Recommend staying here.  Perfect for pre-cruise!,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff could not have been more professional and friendly, and the location is perfect for any tourist in Barcelona. We stayed here pre-cruise and it was just perfect.  They are within walking distance of more tourist sites, shopping, bars and restaurants than you could see in a month.  When it was time to leave, the taxi was right outside the door and we were at the port in 10 minutes.  This will be my ""go to"" hotel whenever I'm in Barcelona from now on. ",5,2023,11,20
37,Unparalleled location at the heart of La Rambla,"This hotel is located at the Law Rambla area which is the heart of the shopping district in Barcelona. 
Access to restaurants, tourist attractions, shopping, Subway and metro is unparalleled at the hotel.  Service by the reception and the concierge were very good. They were always polite and helpful.
The hotel is rather dated, but it is well maintained. As an elite member of the Marriot bonvoy programme, I received a discount for the breakfast. A nice touch at the hotel was the complimentary croissant and coffee in the early morning for guests who depart early.",5,2023,11,12
37,Recommend Le Meridien,"Very nice hotel.  Clean , simple and straight to the point.  Front desk staff are very friendly and helpful.  Perfectly located in the heart of La Ramblas.  Conveniently located nearby restaturants, foodstores and all the usual tourist attractions.",5,2023,11,08
37,"Classy, stylish, quiet, a home away from home","Classy, stylish, quiet, a home away from home. The contrast between the soundproofed rooms and the quiet elegance of Le Meridien is in stark contrast to the garish scenes, the tourist turmoil, and the noise pollution on the ramblas just in front of the hotel.  The service in the lobby is absolutely first-rate.  The check-in and check-out teach take under a minute.  The rooms are modern and large with high ceilings and all amenities.   The beds are fantastic. (Very) minor improvements could include the removal of the carpets in the rooms and a boost to the speed of the free wifi.  ",5,2023,11,08
37,First time to Barcelona.,"If you are headed to Barcelona for the first time or anytime I highly recommend The Le Meridien on the La Rambla for your stay.  We stayed here on Oct 11th -14th 2023 Rm 512. The location is great, walking to a lot of sites and restaurants (there is a restaurant/bar attached to the hotel and accessible from the lobby as well as a small cafe to grab breakfast, coffee and I believe lunch at in the lobby).  A HUGE shout out to Coni on the front desk, this woman should be the face of the Le Meridien, amazing help with information and setting up local tours ( ask for Xavier's private tour of La Sagrada Familia this man was so knowledgeable that you'll get information you wouldn't get on an average tour) , can't say enough to thank her.  Also a mention to Federica at the desk for the restaurant suggestions, spot on and close and to the doormen for getting taxi's, again the staff goes out of their way.   The rooms are nicely appointed, the bathtub/shower combo  is a step out over to get into (this maybe an issue for some individuals with mobility issues,  my suggestion to the hotel is to eliminate the tubs all together and put large walk in showers).",5,2023,11,06
37,Very Nice place,"Excellent location, window to Las Ramblas can be bit noisy at night.
Great restaurant Bar lobo ( not tourist ) across the street very reasonable and big menu ! You can sit on the patio and nice atmosphere
Very Very friendly staff and a nice property!
Every thing is close by !
will stay there again, good for cruises",5,2023,11,03
37,Location is the ONLY reason this place has a 5-star rating.,"Astounded that this place supposedly has a 4+ star rating on Trip Advisor? Even though it claims to be 5-star it would be 3 stars at best if it was located 3-4 blocks farther from The Ramblas. Totally wasted 140,000 points for a 2 night stay here. Arrived to check-in at 2:45 yesterday & was told ""NO rooms are available but they will be available at our official check-in at 3:00P"". Really? ZERO rooms available at 2:45 but ALL rooms will become available in 15 minutes? Such a statement is so totally absurd that it defies comprehension that ""factually professional"" management would allow it to be used. Unfortunately, this place makes one question IF it even has professional on-site management? We were finally given a room at 3:45 or 45 minutes after the ""official"" 3P check-in but there were still other guests waiting. An upgrade for elite Bonvoy Members? Forget it. The room described to us at check-in was not even ""remotely"" like what we received. On our 2nd day at 4:30PM not only was our room still NOT cleaned, but the Lobby is FILLED with disgruntled guests ""waiting"" to check-in yet again. Like being at an airport when flights are cancelled or overbooked. This place LACKS solid, experienced, professional management. Yesterday at 3:30 -- 30 minutes ""after"" official check-in time, we were told (quote): ""The room HAS BEEN cleaned, but Housekeeping has not RELEASED the room yet for assignment, so we cannot check guests in"". Imagine -- even though rooms are, IN FACT, cleaned & ready to occupy, the front desk is ""prohibited"" from checking guests in until housekeeping ""releases"" the rooms. Has management??? even considered having housekeeping release rooms as they are cleaned, so the front desk can continually check guests in rather than waiting in The Lobby? Is this process simply beyond comprehension by management??? In addition, housekeeping in the rooms is NOT up to 5-star standards as attached photos show. Dirty bathroom floors & accumulated dirt in the corners & around the sink. The Lobby is so far from 5-star quality that it raises the question of WHO in Marriott Senior Management has the authority or audacity to still approve this misleading 5-star claim? The bar &/or restaurant is a dead ringer for a strip-center sports bar in a US suburb with dirty tables lingering LONG after guests have departed being only 1 of many shortcomings. All of the staff we encountered were courteous & eager to help so the problems that plague this place lie squarely with POOR to non-existent management. Truly makes on wonder if the problems at this hotel are due to operating at a drastically reduced staff level, or is management simply non-existent or totally overwhelmed???? Staying here again at the end of the current trip is not even a remote possibility. Far too many better options across Barcelona. ",2,2023,10,28
37,Recommend staying here,"This place was very nice    Comfortable rooms, helpful staff and an outstanding location    We walked to dinner each night and got to experience La Rambla at various times    Also had one dinner at hotel which was also very good    And the bar area is great for meeting people",5,2023,10,26
37,So Disappointed,"It was a bit out of our budget but decided to book Le Meridien since we were celebrating a special birthday and the photos and description of the property were amazing. The exterior and lobby of the hotel are tasteful and beautiful. The staff was nice and for the most part helpful. The breakfast buffet was delicious. The location was centrally located for sightseeing and convenient to the Gothic Quarter. Unfortunately, our room (Premium Deluxe) did not match the photos on the Marriott website. It was dark and had little to no natural light. Our window overlooked an ally with trash cans and residential apartment balconies less than 15 feet away so we had to keep the curtains drawn the entire stay. The room was very noisy. Closing doors could be heard not just next to our room but down the hall and the floors above and below. We must have been staying above the kitchen because each morning around 5:30 am doors closing, conversations, and other work sounds. The closet was tiny. There was room to hang only about 5 items. The bathroom while large, was very oddly configured. The toilet was tightly wedged between a wall and sink countertop. And positioned in a way where to sit, you had to turn 30º in one direction. Imagine an airline coach class, center seat with two large people sitting on either side of you - that was the toilet.

We requested another room but were told none was available.

I have stayed in much more affordable and more comfortable hotels.",2,2023,10,23
37,Centrally located and very pleasant staff ,"This hotel is about a 20 min ride from the airport. Check in was easy and the room was larger than most European hotel rooms. It was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The location in relation to las ramblas was ideal. Everything was within walking distance. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Each time we left the hotel, the bellman would tell us to keep our cross body purses the front. I thought it was nice that they said that as barcelona is brutal for pick pockets especially on las ramblas and it was a gentle reminder. The breakfast was very good - good selection of food and fresh juices. Definitely recommend. ",5,2023,10,15
37,"Good hotel, just lacks the wow factor","Getting to/from the airport is very easy. Hop a taxi and it'll run you 35 euro. After 3 long-haul flights, I was very happy to get to my room.

Situated on La Rambla, many of the main tourist attractions are within walking distance which gives you a cutting edge to visit those attractions when they first open and aren'tas busy. 

You're also in the Gothic Quarter and the long, narrow streets give great character to the city. There's a charm to it. And then over by the Cathedral, you have the same narrow streets and the small museum, Moco, lots of shops and eateries to take a little break before moving on.

The hotel is, well, a typical Marriott hotel with Le Meridien colour schemes to add character.  I say that in that it just doesn't have authentic Spanish accents to it. The room is nicely sized with a balcony, rain shower and bath combo. There's enough room for 2 people. The TV is slow to turn on and change channels and the wifi is very slow.
We had breakfast each morning, which was more or less what you'd expect from a standard breakfast. The gym is small, but has all the necessities and wasn't busy. There is no dedicated concierge; rather, the front desk people acted as concierges. I approached them twice, once about specific types of restaurants and once about galleries to purchase artwork. The recommendations for restaurants missed the mark, but the galleries were good.

While there isn't anything substantially wrong with the hotel, I would have preferred to stay at an independent or at least a hotel that had more Spanish flavour to it. Which is actually what my partner and I are doing for the next 4 days. Stay tuned for the next review...",4,2023,10,10
37,"Great location, great breakfast","This is right on La Rambla if that is what you are looking for. So it's convenient to many places, including the Gothic Quarter. The parking garage is only two doors away so when you need your car, it only takes a moment for them to fetch it. But the road is very small and by a taxi stand so just parking for a moment before they come to move it can be chaotic.
They have an amazing breakfast here and delightful rooms but the views are nothing to brag about. It's a cityscape. Definitely still busy at night so if you turn in early, you might be annoyed by the crowds at night but our room was on the side and it never bothered us. 
Their gym here isn't great. It's passable in a pinch though. We've been to much worse. 
Their breakfast is GREAT! Totally worth it. If you have to choose between points and breakfast, choose breakfast. Every option you could want and some Spanish staples - spanish omelettes, quiche lorraine, chocolate croissants (I know, a lot of that is French but we're near the border). 
",4,2023,10,09
37,Perfect family trip,What a beautiful hotel. The staff are great. The reviews do not do it justice. It’s perfect location and the restaurant is top notch. Please do not hesitate to book here. Close to everything and so easy to get to and from the cruise terminal and airport.,5,2023,09,18
37,I was charged for the night I didn't stay,"I have booked Grand Terrace Suit which is 86 m2 for two nights through Booking.com. Room was smelling heavly.
House keeping try to fix it twice but couldn't. I wanted to leave the hotel but they suggested to change the room to a recently renovated one if I wait up to 8pm. I spent 4 hours out of hotel. They gave me another room without terrace and 49 m2 and called it upgrade.
Next morning I left the hotel but they charged me for the second night which I have not stayed at that hotel. 
Booking .com also could not succeded to get my second night's payment back.",1,2023,09,15
37,A Perfect Location in Barcelona,"Perfect location, excellent staff,
Santiago checked us in yesturday.  He was very courteous and gave us a fabulous room #814 with a panoramic view of the “must see” sites.
Everything is within walking distance.  Definitely a return to destination in the future.",5,2023,09,03
37,Excellent Classy Hotel ..,"We are cruising tomorrow with Regent who booked this hotel, thank you Regent. After a long day we checked in at 1am to a warm and helpful welcome. Even at this time we were given assistance with our baggage. Our room is spotless and very we equipped and the bed so comfortable.. thank you for the fabulous welcome.",5,2023,09,03
37,All around very excellent,"The location is ideal.   We had 2 stays in August 2023 with 2 different rooms; each was unique and perfectly furnished and comfortable with great beds, pillows and furnishings.  The front desk staff, the employees and the manager are superb.  The ground level restaurant is great for an extensive buffet breakfast and dinner from a nice menu with windows on La Rambla. ",5,2023,08,30
37,Modern hotel ideally located in downtown Barcelona,"I was looking to extend my time in Barcelona at the end of a cruise.  While there are some options along the waterfront, the goal was to experience the culture of being downtown the city. This hotel is nicely situated in the middle of the action! Excellent service experience by the doormen and check-in staff, our rooms were comfortable and nicely appointed. There was an issue with the window in my room not closing properly, but maintenance was quick to fix the problem. If there is an area for improvement it would be to update the bathroom to walk-in showers. It's a deep tub to climb into and out of and anyone with mobility issues might have challenges. Aside from that we had a great stay, with tons of great restaurants, stores and museums all within close proximity to the hotel.       ",5,2023,08,29
37,Centrally located - perfect!,"I love it there. Centrally located, with spacious rooms is a perfect choice. I enjoyed everything there. From a good mattress sleep to a delicious breakfast. I would stay there again for sure. We never made it to the rooftop so not sure about amenities there.",5,2023,08,27
37,Great location and spacious rooms,"We traveled as a family of four and had two rooms - a deluxe room with two beds for the teens, and a Grand Terrace suite for the parents.  It worked out perfectly.  The suite was spacious and the terrace was worth every penny, doubling the space we had to spread out (and have enough spaces for everyone to do their own thing when needed!).  The kids' room was just what they needed - basic, but spacious with a sitting area and far enough away from mom and dad when they wanted their space.  

The hotel has a great location, right on Las Ramblas and a short walk to La Boqueria and the Gothic quarter (cathedral, roman towers, Picasso museum, etc.).  It was a greater distance to La Sagrada Familia - we walked there but took a taxi back to the hotel to save time (and energy since it was a hot day).  Taxis were easy to find.

The service at the hotel was excellent with a friendly and helpful staff.  We were greeted with a bottle of cava and some sweets our first night, which was a great treat and a lovely way to end our travel day.  We used room service (ordered ice and snacks a few times) and they were always prompt and professional.  

Great decision to stay here while visiting Barcelona.",5,2023,08,04
37,Unrivalled location!,"Unrivalled location. Right on Rambla. Near all the shops, the attractions and the beach. Few minutes walk to Gothic Quarters, Casa Batlló, Barcelona Beach, Cathedrial, Placa Real, Placa Catalunya. Right beside La Boqueria. What ore can you ask for.",5,2023,07,27
37,Great customer service and best location for Barcelona sight seeing,"Absolutely THE BEST location for everything on and off La rambla. Better than I had hoped based on some of the reviews. Our first room was very small and had no real balcony but was a bit noisy.  But after connecting with Sassy before our arrival, she was amazingly hostipitable and was able to move our room on Day 2 to the 8th floor with an amazing view of the city.  While that room was quite small, the patio was almost as big. In the mornings we sat on the patio drinking our coffee and in the evening we drank glasses of wine and Cava we purchased at the large market just 2 doors up the street. The on-premise restaurant served breakfast and you literally are overlooking La Rambla. At night the dinner served were MUCH better than we had expected and far superior to any of the Al fresco restaurants grabbing your attention as you stroll. Easy walk to Gothic quarter, high-end shops (as you can see), tax refund offices, bus station etc.  Will stay here next time in this amazing city.",5,2023,07,12
37,Average 4star overrated hotel,"An below average 4 star boutique hotels sold only due to brand marriot name to it!

Firstly don't go by name of le meridian , its definitely not a 5 star hotel! For many of reasons listed below

1.Hotel with no drop off car lobby. Guest are dropped and luggage taken out of car on footpath.

2. Small reception with few seating sofas and 2 receptionist

3. Outdated floor lobbies with least floor height completely claustrophobic

4. Rooms having  no views or blocked by buildings all around (some at literally high touching distance from each other)

5. Triple room booked by meid equivalent to jail cell with small 3 ft window opening and tat too straight looking into other building with no privacy. Anyone can just jump from other building to this room!!

6. Completely claustrophobic environment and Outdated interiors.

7. Over n above super unhelpful staff who doesn't want to understand legitimate concerns of guest and only interested n pushing suites for higher rates

8. Such properties bring bad name to brand like Marriot and Le meridian as guest are fooled by glorified pictures and marriot brand name later repend on the booking

Not atall recommended",1,2023,07,12
37,Expensive but safe and convenient location,"Amazing security folks who are so helpful and vigilant in helping get luggage to/from lobby. Great location right on the Ramblas can't be beat because you are close to good restaurants. However the pricey room is tiny and the extra bed is uncomfortable and is expensive for the extra cost. Although we didn't care for the room/price, the bathroom was amazing! Breakfast is good too--really great service and good experience eating here. I have an issue with the amount of extra taxes that are added at checkout as these details  are not listed in the original reservation quote.  But that said, the service and location are really good. ",3,2023,07,05
37,Excellent Choice,Staff was above and beyond exceptional and location was perfect for experiencing the heart of the city. We loved our stay here! The breakfast buffet was the best and we stayed at many hotels throughout Spain. Hotel was clean and service was excellent.,5,2023,07,02
37,"Nice hotel, good location",Great hotel! The bathrooms were nice with good water pressure. Staff was friendly. The location was great. It’s very close to the huge food market and is pretty much in the gothic quarter. La Segrada Familia is a bit far. We took a taxi there and walked back. You could walk straight there in ~40 minutes but we stopped at Casa Batlo and a few well known bars on the way back. I’d stay again.,5,2023,07,02
37,"Great location, would stay again","Amazing location! Easy to walk everywhere, even the water. Comfortable room. Water in rooms. Great water pressure and it was hot!! Room was learn and cleaned nightly. Was able to get in a little earlier than check-in, which made it perfect after our long flight to Barcelona. Breakfast buffet was really good. Had dinner at the restaurant and it was delicious, highly recommend. Overall, would stay again. ",5,2023,06,18
37,Fabulous Location!,"Centrally located, Le Meridien afforded us a great home base to spend 5 glorious days in Barcelona after disembarking from our Mediterranean cruise. The staff at the front desk were incredibly kind and helpful, assisting us with shipping treasures back to the states. The room was comfortable with grand windows opening to side street which housekeeping were able to open to allow us some fresh air. Beds were comfy and bathroom accommodations were top notch.",4,2023,06,12
37,Very nice friendly hotel,Very clean hotel with outstanding service. Excellent location. Room were spacious and silent. We slept very well. The restaurant is very good too with friendly prompt service. It was a pleasant experience. Easy access to taxi services too.,5,2023,06,10
37,Great Location,"This hotel is right in a perfect location to walk through amazing outdoor cafes, shops and just take in the city.  Restaurant was very popular and their staff were very accommodating.  Flew in early and, as a lifetime Bonvoy member, the hotel was able to check me in early which was much appreciated.  Only reason for 4/5 was the rooms were nothing special and room air conditioner didn’t cool room enough.",4,2023,06,01
37,"Loved the Restaurant.  The rooms are Modest, but Fine.","The hotel rooms are modest and quite noisy, especially if there is a sports event being watched locally.  There was an important soccer match the first night of our stay and the fireworks were active until 1:07 am. 

 However, the restaurant is wonderful.  The omelet chef in the morning is a master.  The selections were plentiful.  We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel and the salmon main was delicious.",4,2023,05,31
37,Not a place to stay with kids.,This hotel did not live up to our expectations. We requested a quite room and were placed right outside the housekeeping closet. We were traveling with our teenage daughter whose pullout bed ended up being right next to the bathroom with a transparent door.,2,2023,05,31
37,Not up to anything ,"   I decided to take the time to write this review after seeing the online photos. 

I am a Titanium-level Bonvoy member and as such I  have had lots of experience with the brand.  Just returned to Maryland after a three-day stay.  Stayed in three other hotels in Spain while we were there. Happly None of them were ""Bonvoy"" . They were all way better. If I could give  -1 I would. 

  

We had two rooms I stayed with my wife in the so-called family suite upgrade. My daughter had her own room on a different level. 

Not a welcoming lobby area.   When we arrived there were several guests complaining. One about room upgrades. Another was concerned about point credits.   One unhappy guest in the elevator told me the hotel was not up to Marriott standards.  Reminder her of a Motel 6.  I said to myself who cares. Well, I was proven wrong. 

Specifics. The room and bathroom are outdated. Lots of cracked tiles in the bathroom. Black grout or worse in the shower.   The toilet area stunk.  Every time I went in there I wondered who had peed all over the room.  The baked-in stains in front of the toilet offered one clue.
 

By the way as a hint for the management that will pretend to care my room number was 612 

",1,2023,05,25
37,Great location in Barcelona ,Great location on La Rambla.  Friendly staff all around and nice small bar area to go to after a long day of touring the city.  Bartender Jackie  M. was outstanding.   She makes the best Cosmopolitan martini.   The breakfast buffet was very good with a wide variety to choose from and made to order omelets. ,5,2023,05,24
37,Solid choice for Marriott Bonvoy types,"This is a solid choice in Barcelona, especially if you’re a Marriott aficionado.  It won’t give you a charming local experience, so for those not Marriott I’d give it 4 stars, but it’s clean, professionally run, and decent style-wise as far as these kinds of hotels go.

Avoid the breakfast if it’s not complimentary and you have time; you’re in Barcelona with a wealth of wonderful options that this cannot stand up too.",5,2023,05,16
37,Excellent experience,"We stayed 3 nights at Le Meridien, both before and after a cruise. Everything was excellent and we would return to this hotel if we ever have the opportunity to visit Barcelona again. 
Ricardo, the Concierge, professionally and patiently assisted us at the front desk. He helped us as we navigated activities and tours in Barcelona. He is an asset to Le Meridien/the Marriott Corp. 

The hotel was clean, safe and convenient. The hotel restaurant and La Poma restaurant ( on the same block) were excellent. There is a supermarket located on that block, too, in case you forget any necessities or want a quick snack/drink. 

 As non-Spanish speakers/travelers from another country, these factors of safety, cleanliness and convenience were very important to us. The hotel cost more than other hotels that we looked at, but you get what you pay for. ",5,2023,05,15
37,Beautiful lunch,"We enjoyed a fantastic paella here and two wonderful desserts. It’s a fantastic restaurant right there in the middle of Barcelona’s most famous street. Food and staff were fantastic thank you!
Definitely worth a visit whilst you’re in Barcelona.",5,2023,05,13
37,Great Staff,"The location is convenient to many things, but also on the busiest tourist street.   We knew this before booking, but it was a much more crowded and unpleasant area than we imagined. 

The room itself was average.   Though supposedly just updated, it appeared dated.   The step into the shower/tub was very high and a bit dangerous.   If you want your room cleaned before the hours of 5 to 8 pm you need to make a special request.  The room was quiet and we had restful nights.

As a status member with Marriott, breakfast was included.   The buffet had a large variety of items and was adequate.

The best part of the experience was the front desk staff and the bellmen/doormen.  All were very helpful and friendly and would go out of their way to assist.

Not the hotels fault, but the taxi stand in front will refuse to take you unless you’re going to the airport.  The hotel staff was great every time this occurred to go flag down a taxi who would take us locally.   ",3,2023,05,10
37,Great Hotel in Las Ramblas Area!!,"Visiting from California. This is a fairly new and wonderful hotel in the Las Ramblas area of town. Nice bar and restaurant in the hotel and tons of restaurants and shops right out the door. Room is very nicely appointed with high end coffee bar and amenities. With the exception of some lively conversations on the street below at times, we had a very comfortable night’s sleep. Staff greeting was extra warm, welcoming and efficient. We would return here and highly recommend.",5,2023,05,05
37,"Mosquitoes in the room, and the way was handled…","Read some negative reviews about the hotel, but decided to give it a try. What a wrong decision. The first night at around 4am, we’re woke up by the sing of mosquitoes, then I realized I got Four bites already. Called service desk, a guy came to our room and sprayed the fun area first then the rest of the room. No sleep after this. Before we left for Sagrada Familia the same day at about 8:30 am, we asked the front desk to make sure no mosquitoes anymore. The second night was fine. The 3rd day we were very tired and came back at about 5:30pm. Immediately after we laid down on the bed, the mosquitoes welcomed us back ! I got one bite this time, and luckily caught one by hand. Called the service center and waited for 30 minutes without any response. We got very frustrated and angry with the ignorance. I called again, and the lady asked me to “talk well”?  We were being very polite about the mosquitoes issue at 4am, and the following morning just asked very politely to make sure no more mosquitoes in the room. The first call of the 3rd night for the same issue during our entire stay was quite politely as well. Enough is enough! Who is not being polite here?? A gentleman then came with a pen and piece of paper. We gave the whole picture. Guess what? The gentleman told us that they don’t have mosquitoes in the hotel. We felt there’s a racial profiling going on just because we are Asian.I told him that we came from Netherlands. He became silent. Then we asked him if he wanted to see the pictures we took of the mosquitoes on the hotel room wall and the died body of one on the desk. He then said he would talk to the front desk and we would be in touched shortly. The lady who asked me to talk well called me back and said  one hotel staff came to our room to spray treat the room for us, and we rejected the service!!! Come on please! I use my toe to know this is a lie!! What is wrong with the hotel?? A lady who finally came to spray the room told us each room has its individual air conditioning unit, and the mosquitoes came from the tube of the room. Now I understand why the first night the guy sprayed the fun area when he came into the room. The hotel knows the problem. Sprayed insecticide in the room while we were still there. My husband has lung problems, and we were offered 20 minutes to rest in the lobby. This time we said No, with windows and door closed, 20 minutes   was far from enough to reduce the potential damage to human health . We were very tired and we needed rest. After chatting with someone, the lady told us we’re getting a new room to stay. Barcelona is a very lovely and friendly city. The two at the front desk while we were checking out, without even a single smile but long faces, have no where near the famous, beautiful city. One last issue, seems to us, the hotel does not welcome Go Green guests, since we used Aerobus not Taxi  from/to the airport. Just would like to share what we have experienced with everyone here.

37,Dreadful experience ,We booked this hotel with the Marriott reservation team to travel with our children (9 year old and 9 month old). One day before our trip the Le Meridien team messaged us to say that the reservation was  made for a wrong room and we need to pay double the price! Long story short it was dreadful to deal with Marriott as the Marriott central reservation team and the hotel team don’t communicate with each other! The hotel itself was ok. Location is central but otherwise it is not a 5 star hotel. We will not be back and likely will not use Marriott again. ,1,2023,05,02
37,People Make the Difference,"My wife and I had a wonderful experience in the four nights we stayed.  The room was good enough for us, but I write particularly to sing the praises of the friendly and helpful staff.  I give five stars to two outstanding doormen, Eduard and Haider, as well as Anna Mauri, the Director of Food and Beverage, whose workers made each of our breakfast meals terrifically pleasant.",4,2023,04,25
37,It’s a fine hotel,"Staff was excellent and friendly.  The location is right in the middle of it all.  Walking distance from every where.  Check in and check out was easy.  

The lighting system in the room was odd, light switches in different areas from the purpose.

The only negatives were the tub plunger/plug didn’t work,  if you got it down it wouldn’t come up.  The carpet in the hall and bedroom need a deep cleaning.",4,2023,03,25
37,the perfect place,"We spent a weekend in this beautifully located hotel right on the Rambla de Barcelona, from there easy to move around the city. After good parking instructions directly in the hotel and a quick, professionally prepared check-in, we got our room with a beautiful terrace with loungers and a seating area. So the first welcome drink in the sun - nice and no noice of the city ! We liked the very friendly  young spirit staff in a this pleasant environment. The restaurant is furnished in a modern lifestyle, the menu has an interesting tastefully selection of dishes and individual presentation,  a very attentive service and acceptable prices. In this restaurant we had  the feeling of being already part of the barcelona atmospare, as well they offer some live music during the week. So all around a super service and a super place to start discovering the city. 

",5,2023,03,24
37,Why stay anywhere else in Barcelona,"Talk about the perfect location.  You are right on Las Ramblas with easy access to the Metro and Taxi Stands.  And, many places close by foot.  I'd stay here for the location if even a decent hotel, but you get the benefit of a beautiful luxurious hotel.  

Special thanks to Alba for making the time extra special.  She made sure everything was perfect.  The room was spectacular and just gives you the sense we are on vacation and in self-care mode.  Everything you needed from amenities was there.  We were out a lot, so couldn't fully take advantage of all the amenities, but we would stay here just for the hotel.  

Finally, the Champagne Brunch everyday was amazing, truly amazing.  I miss it almost everyday.  

Treat yourself, your significant other and your family and stay here.

Enjoy!!

37,"Fantastic experience. Diego, Valentin, Ricardo and team are very helpful to say the least. Decent size rooms with brkfst",Very good hotel with best location and friendly staff to boot. All attractions within walking distance and all major brands also very close by. All food outlets also very close by! Must stay at this hotel as it’s economics given the location,5,2023,03,08
37,An Oasis in Central Barcelona,"A lovely, friendly place to visit in the centre of Barcelona. Great and comfy rooms, very modern, with all the conveniences. 
Breakfasts were outstanding, with all your choices from salads to pre-cooked meats and eggs, or a freshly made omelette. 
Staff were extremely friendly, and offered great advice on local places to visit and evening meals. 
The hotel is located very centrally so it was easy to walk to almost all of the cultural destinations we were looking for.",5,2023,03,06
37,Fantastic hotel with unbeatable location,"Amazing hotels: comfortable rooms, unbeatable location on the Rambla, 111 restaurant and bar with great atmosphere, excellent service with a smile (all staff at Front Office and Jacqueline at the bar in particular), will come again without a doubt if returning to Barcelona.",5,2023,02,21
37,"Good location, steps from Placa de  Catalunya","Our stay was right after Christmas, first time trying Le Meridien hotels. The location is great, steps from Placa de Catalunya ( one of Barcelona's main square and huge transport hub ), and gothic quarter. We were overwhelmed by the huge number of visitors, it wasn't our first time in Barcelona, but we never before witness such a crowed. The experience with the hotel was disappointing, I didn't feel appreciated as a Titanium Marriott Bonvoy member. First, we have to pay extra for our son, the 3rd person in the room, even if the maximum occupancy was 4 persons( they don't even have a lounge ); the explanation for the extra charge was that the maid needed more time to make the bed ( it was an uncomfortable sofa bed ). I witnessed at least another family with 2 young kids that have to pay for an extra room, and they were as surprised as us. Secondly, the room  looked totally different than the ones in the picture on the website; the view was depressing; luckily, we didn't spend too much time in the room. The front desk staff were polite, but they have to consult with their manager for every little thing, and he had only one answer: sorry,  NOT possible. There were a few friendly employees in the lobby/front desk, more in line with Marriott standards, but not many. The breakfast buffet was great, with a variety of hot and cold food; pastries, fruits and more; be aware and disclose your allergies since the cross contamination is real; some of the food was way undercooked one day, but it happened just once. Overall, it's a clean hotel, in a great location with good potential if the management will work more toward customer satisfaction.",3,2023,02,21
37,2nd honeymoon,"We have been to this hotel on our honeymoon 2008 and it was amazing experience, and we return this year to have even better and joyfully stay , thank you to the great staff specially Lily to make our 2nd stay greater than the first . This will be must stay hotel in Barcelona .",5,2023,01,29
37,Great location,"This is a very nice hotel within walking distance of a lot of attractions, restaurants and the hop on/off bus stop. All employees were very nice! The free buffet breakfast was much appreciated. There is a restaurant on site that has great paella and outstanding service.",5,2023,01,22
37,"Friendly and Attentive Staff, Great Location!","The location cannot be beaten. You are right on La Rambla street and steps from the gothic quarter of Barcelona. Having said this, the area is very congested and at night, didn't feel quite as safe as we would have liked. 

Service at the hotel was very good and the staff was extremely friendly. Housekeeping never missed our room, which is a real plus these days. Our only complaint was that the rooms here are in serious need of an upgrade. The beds weren't very comfortable, and there was not ample lighting in the room. We had an 'upgraded' suite so were a bit surprised that the room did not look anything like what is in the photographs.",3,2023,01,19
37,Mixed feelings,"The hotel is very conveniently located in the middle of La Rambla, the entire historic center is within walking distance, as well as many shops and restaurants.
We arrived at 10 o'clock in the evening, the door to the terrace of the room was broken and would not close. I asked for a new room, at the reception they refused me, since there was none. An employee came and fixed the door in maybe 5 minutes, but the initial feeling was quite bitter. The room itself was big enough, but the bathroom door was sliding and didn't close tightly, which I didn't like at all (privacy please). Otherwise, the rooms were clean and the service was at the level. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant - it was excellent with a large choice of dishes and superb omelettes.",4,2023,01,05
37,First night in Spain and Le Meridien treated us so well!,"Had an absolutely fantastic stay on 14th Dec. Too bad we only stayed one night. Overview below:
Location: 5 stars. It’s on La Rambla and a 2 min away from Mercado de la Boqueria. It’s a 5 min walk from Plaça Catalunya bus stop from the airport. What this means though is you will hear noises throughout the night so if this bothers you, this place may not suit 
Service: warm, welcoming and helpful. My wife and I arrived in the morning around 1045 am and the hotel, serviced by wonderful Seinya, got us a room right away. Not only that they upgraded the stay to a suite with Spanish sparkling wine + turron bc it’s our honeymoon. What more can one ask for??
Room: the suite was spacious with a wondrous view of downtown Barcelona and la Rambla
Food: the breakfast was super. Huge variety and one chef was making eggs to service. Great collection of juices, bread and pastries, cereal, cured meat, warm dishes such as varieties of croquetas, tortilla, and sausages. 
Overall: would come back in a heartbeat. Highly recommended!",5,2023,01,02
37,A Solid Choice for Barcelona,"This Marriott property while located on a quiet side street is in a great location in the heart of Barcelona.  Service was excellent throughout.  For anyone taking a cruise out of Barcelona, it is a relatively short distance to the harbor.  For Marriott Elites, the excellent buffet breakfast is included.  Modestly priced for a higher-end Barcelona hotel",5,2022,12,17
37,Not our pick,The room was very small and totally inadequate.  Two people could not walk around at the same time. The appointments were all very dated. Not enough plugs. This hotel ( belonging to the Marriott family) was picked by the cruise line and would never be a choice of ours. The location was good.,3,2022,10,28
37,Le Meriden Barcelona Rambla is More than you can describe,"My business visit in Barcelona for Canalys and clients was a perfect location.  The experience began with reservations exactly as expected.  As paying the taxi to arrive my bags were inside before I could turn around. WOW.
Checking-in staff was very professional and helpful.  Selected the room to easily use stairs or elevator as my choice. The room and greetings were perfect for refreshment.
The rooms had efficient power and wi-fi perfect for my business connections and laptop.  Air condition was adjustable and very comfortable.  The rooms were remodeled and very comfortable.  Good lighting and good hot water.  
The best part of my 4-night stays was the evening hostess at the front desk provided many great advice.  Marilia had local experience to recommend my taste each evening. Sharing local restaurants and walking distance was perfect.  She requested what taste and foods I like or looking for.  She took the extra time to recommend options and defined differences.  She made the difference being away from home and very comfortable.  I will be there again.   
One more.  the men assisting in and out the front entrance and providing taxi etc.",5,2022,10,28
37,Very poor service and hotel.  Do not come to stay at LeMeridien Barcelona,"I booked 4 days for my family (wife and child - 5 year old).  

QUIET ROOM PREFERENCE (actually a very noisy room!!!!!)  - I asked at the reception (and my agency asked when they booked the room), for a quiet room on a higher floor
- no quiet room !  They managed to put me on the second floor (not a higher floor), and housekeeping space is 2 meters from the room, across the halway!!!  They keep talking there non stop closing and opening the door!!  Non stop

WIFI  NOT WORKING IN THE ROOM - Me and my kid needed wifi.  When we entered into the room, surprise, no wifi coverage !   I asked again to fix it.
- no wifi, 24h later!  Unbelievable.  They came yesterday, they saw it is not working and they suggested a bigger room.  Today (after I saw they still dis not fix it, I went ro the reception and asked to see the other room.  Surprise!  They lied about that too.  The ro was identical and without the shower.  Complete lack of profesionalism.  And yes, wifi still does not work!

CHECKIN  WAS LATE - Even tho’ we asked for checkin at 12, they said they will call me when done.  After that they called me at 15:30, mentioning I can get the room as they needed time to make 3rd bed which appeared in the reservation one week ago anyway!

EXTREMELY DIRTY ROOM - very very dirty room
- they again told me they this floor is a renivated floor etc.  Look at the extremely dirty and dangerour for health room!  Unbeliavable!

BONVOY - missing number on reservation
Evwn today by BONVOY cose is not registered on the reservation!.

I do not recommend you stay here. Very weak management team, they only talk, they do not fix anything.  Zero action, zero support.  They will take your money for full service and give you a 2 star service and room.  Do not come here.",1,2022,10,24
37,Disappointed.  Horrible internet.  Lousy customer service. ,"Disappointed in my stay 3 nites at this hotel. I'm a business traveler with high status at Marriott and even that didn't seem to help.  There is no Marriott lounge at this property,  so you are paying a premium for location to the main avenue. 

The fact is that the internet never really worked in my room. It was embarrassingly bad and spotty. The local library where I'm from had better, stronger and more reliable internet than this place.  I travel 75 nights a year  with no internet problem so I know its not my computer.   

I mentioned the problem my first morning to the front desk and the agent said she would check on it. No message and no fix.  I did the same thing my second morning again with no message and no fix.  When I checked out this morning the agent looked at me like I was speaking an unknown language. No apology. It was the weekend otherwise I would have checked out early. Not having reliable internet in my room, to me  is hotel malpractice.  It shouldn't be acceptable in a 5 star ever.  

I did like my slightly upgraded room even though the fridge did not keep a soda cold thoroughly. 

Adequate breakfast even though it was the same each day.

Still. No excuse is acceptable for shoddy internet coverage.   It's ridiculous. ",2,2022,10,24
37,Fantastic stay,"We were here years ago when it was The Sheraton. Great location, off La Rambles so noise at night never bothered us. Staff is excellent. Helpful and welcoming. Great service.
Rooms are beautiful, bright, clean and comfortable. Great shower and big towels.
Best was breakfast...do not miss. Mimosa's, eggs and omelets cooked to order and everything else you could want. Fortunately we walked it off .
I would recommend this Hotel to anyone. Stay, you'll enjoy yourself. ",5,2022,10,21
37,Great!!!,"Placed with everything at this hotel, I received excellent attention from everyone at the hotel especially personal in the  restaurant. Chef David was careful with food I requested since I have food allergies. He personally came to the table and explain how food was prepared. Thank you to all, Allison, Jackie, Paul and the rest of people working at he restaurants. Highly recommend.",5,2022,10,11
37,Excellent service for BonVoy member👍!,"We can’t thank the staff (Ivan, Jonathan, Roberto, Matthias) and Management (Bruno) enough for going out of their way to get us an awesome room with our Marriott points. We understand for a boutique hotel with limited suites and views and an almost full occupancy, how difficult it to was to accommodate our request. Thank you for understanding that, as a BonVoy titanium elite member, I work hard all year long traveling and being away from home on the road staying at Marriott properties. When I use hundreds of thousands of points to stay at a beautiful property with my spouse for a special occasion, this is when I want the best room! You made that happen 👍❤️. From the wonderful breakfasts, tapas, and cocktails at your on-site CentOnze restaurant, to the perfect location on La Rambla, this has been a fabulous experience for us. Moltes Gràcies!",5,2022,10,07
37,Disappointed but met great employee,"We arrived around noon and were told the room would be ready in half an hour or so.  Came back 3 hours later and room still wasn't availableand there was quite a bit of pandemonium going on at check in with a couple of disgruntled customers. I want to give a shout out to my check in clerk,  Ksenia, who was able to get us into a room immediately.... although it wasn't the r.oom level we had expected.  She kept digging until sheno found the 1st floor room which we reluctantly accepted. This stay did not live up to our expectations from Marriott LeMeridien but you should be proud of your very capable employee,  Ksenia

37,Nice hotel - Unless you want to sleep,"My wife and I stayed at the Le Meridien Barcelona for our 25th wedding anniversary. We had two nights in Barcelona a before boarding a cruise and hoped to find a comfortable hotel to sleep and adjust to the time change. The was a HORRIFIC FAIL. Our only request was a quiet room so that we could sleep. Instead the put is over the area they hold parties. The first night the sound coming from the flow below was so loud the glass was rattling in our room. I got out of bed and went to the lobby which was packed with drunken caller students and I had to yell to be heard at the front desk. The second night they decided to practice moving luggage above our roo
 So we got to listen to loud wheels bumping across our ceiling all night long. We got maybe 5 hours of sleep in the two nights we were there. We actually slept better and more on the airplane flying to Spain. 

The location is great, and the staff is very nice, but completely unable or unwilling to correct an issue if you have one. We spent 140,000 point to spend two nights there. They offered us 4,000 as an apology. There are many, nicer hotels nearby. If you are staying at Le Meridien be sure to sleep on the plane, it will be the best rest you get.",1,2022,10,03
37,Tired hotel...,"The location is terrific and the breakfast is outstanding. But the rooms are worn. We had a broken bottle in the fridge, a broken towel heater, missing lightbulbs, etc.  Needs a good upgrade on maintenance!",3,2022,10,02
37,Expensive and uninspiring,"This Meridien is in a really excellent location, right on the Ramblas and near all the tourist sites.

Because it was the La Merce festival when we were there, all the hotels in Barcelona were charging crazy rates and the price for a basic room here was around 500 Euros per night, which this hotel definitely isn’t worth.

The first room we were given was extremely tired and most of the furniture was scuffed. It had a view of the adjoining Carrefour roof and there were hardly any sockets. A complete throwback to c2000. As we discovered when we noticed our socks were wet, the carpet had been cleaned not long before we arrived and was still very wet. Reception gave us a new room, but we didn’t even get an apology.

The second room was a step up, was larger, brighter and had been redecorated more recently. Plenty of sockets with a view of one of the Ramblas side streets. Still definitely not worth the price tag.

The “premium” internet they charge 15 Euros for a day reached the impressive speed of 5Mbps, which isn’t really suitable for even basic browsing nowadays. Thankfully the charged was waived.

Housekeeping still hadn’t cleaned the room when we returned after 3pm on our second day, which wasn’t really ideal.

The AC in both rooms worked well, the soundproofing was fine and the black-out blinds did their job. The large bed was comfortable.

Breakfast, at nearly 20 Euros per person per day, was fine but also pretty poor value – if you can be bothered to look for a nearby café you will likely eat better and for a lot less.

Staff were overall friendly, but I would have to be pretty desperate to return.",3,2022,09,27
37,Every request granted!,"We stayed at Le Meridien on La Rambla for three nights while on a trip to Europe.  We would like to highlight how wonderful and responsive the entire staff at this location.  More importantly, there was a slight miscommunication upon check-in with our reservation but, Ricardo is an exceptional concierge who assisted us with great ease.  He made us feel comfortable while he made the updates to our room and was extremely pleasant while resolving the situation.  Ricardo also provided a most wonderful private tour of Sagrada Familia which we absolutely enjoyed from start to finish.  Every interaction with the front desk was attentive, helpful and absolutely cheerful.  We would highly recommend this property not only for the awesome location, but for making us feel welcome for our entire stay.  We will be back!",5,2022,09,23
37,"Lots of 10's, but also a big zero","I echo everything others have said here, the location is perfect, the staff is terrific as well as the property as a whole. The problem I had, which I'm surprised nobody else has commented on, is the bathroom. While it is rather large, well appointed and has a tremendous amount of shelf space, it is enclosed on two sides by two frosted glass panels with a sliding door. This affords absolutely no privacy as the frosted glass still allows you to see inside, even when somebody is - how should I say this -  sitting. To add to the situation, the sliding glass door by design doesn't seal the bathroom off, so every little sound is heard in the room, especially at night when everything is still and quiet. Lastly, when the bathroom light is turned on in the middle of the night, the entire room lights up. 

I just though readers should be informed.",4,2022,09,23
37,Our 6 or 7th stay and always happy,"This hotel became our number 1 choice in Barcelona in the past 3-4 years . It prevailed over Ritz and W where we used to stay in the previous years.

Thanks to its location right on La Rambla , it is very close to everything: shops , Carrefour supermarket around the corner , several clubs , and of course crowds and crowds of people flocking la rambla. If you are looking for a quite hotel in a tranquil area , go somewhere else. But we love every aspect of the hotel and the area. Though the hotel does have rooms facing the quieter side of the street. 

The hotel has this European hype and design , the rooms are very nice , always clean and functional . We almost always get a room with the La rambla view. 

The staff is exceptional. I want to mention Monica (hello from MP), all the front office and all the bell captains. They are what every hotel must have : genuine care , always helpful and attentive , polite , yet friendly and relaxed. We never had any complaints about the staff or anything else . Such a rare quality . Yet the rates are very affordable considering the location and the high quality. 

The breakfast is good , a variety of choices . 

The hotel has an underground garage and valet service so parking for us in the cramped area was easy. 

A highly recommended hotel - the best in Barcelona .",5,2022,09,22
37,Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"This hotel was a perfect spot to be within all the important sights of Barcelona. Friendly and helpful staff and Concierge’s, plenty of amenities, and a great breakfast made our stay a wonderful experience.",5,2022,09,19
37,"Great location, wonderful staff, fair hotel.","This is more of a “boutique hotel” which is fine if that’s what you’re looking for. The positives here are a truly great staff….very friendly, accommodating, attentive. Also, a super location along the busy and popular La Rambla and close to shopping and attractions such as the Casa Batlo’, The Basilica of the Sagrada Familia, and many many others that are within walking distance. Dozens of tapas restaurants nearby but few regular dining establishments. Those are more rare. Also fairly close to the oceanfront and beaches.

Our room was considered a “premium” which was a bit surprising in that it was small by US Marriott standards but probably typical for here. Comfortable bedding, clean, modern (aka not much atmosphere!).

The breakfast buffet was reasonably expansive but the food quality was only fair. Good service, good hot coffee, fresh omelettes and eggs, but poor fruit selection and  some of the baked goods were rather stale.

Overall, I’d stay here for the location and service but my preference as far as hotels here would be something a notch or two above.",3,2022,09,19
37,5 star staff; 3 star amenities,"Stayed here for 3x nights on a business trip. Can’t fault the staff, all very friendly and happy to help with anything. Food and cocktails in the bar also very nice, as is breakfast. However, things like 1x bottle of water in the room and no plug sockets beside the bed (either side) are a little disappointing. The “spa” is also very small, and not suitable for more than 2/3 people at a time.",4,2022,09,11
37,Great experience and Close to everything,"Loved the location of the hotel. Room was clean and spacious. Room service was great and the service was excellent. No issues checking in and no long lines. Room was ready early upon my arrival at 1PM. Absolutely loved the location. Close to the Market, Shopping, and Restaurants. Getting a taxi was always easy as they are right outside the hotel. All around a great stay.",5,2022,09,06
37,Wonderful Place for a short trip!!,We spent two nights at Le Meridien prior to heading out on a cruise.  This hotel is centrally located near the popular La Rambla and within walking distance of many tourist spots and the market.  Hotel staff was wonderful and the interior decor was nice.  We will definitely stay at Le Meridien on our next trip to Barcelona! Muchas Gracias!!,5,2022,08,24
37,Worse experience ever with Meridien/Marriott,"I was charged 80€ per night per room for the extra bed  on top of what appeared as TOTAL price of the stay (for all rooms and guests) on the confirmation (where the number of guests per room was clearly specified).
I sent a complaint per email asking for clarifications without receiving any reply from the hotel; really unacceptable.
The check-in procedure was extremely slow (notwithstanding my Bonvoy Platinum status).
Worse experience ever with Meridien/Marriott.",1,2022,08,08
37,Okay Hotel If It Weren’t For Check-In/Out,"There were some highs of staying at this hotel and definitely some lows. I’ll start out with the highs. We stayed in a basic room—it was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable and the shower was awesome. You can choose either the rain on one end or the hand held on the other. Not sure why it’s designed that way but there’s plenty of room. The toiletries were nice, especially the liquid shampoo, conditioner, and body soap. It’s easier than calling housekeeping for the tiny bottles of shower products. The AC was easy to use and kept the room cool. The room also came with slippers and robes- nice! Another highlight was the restaurant. We were offered the buffet for 17 euros, which we though was a good deal. The best part was the coffee- unlimited lattes! We will share more about the restaurant in a separate review. They also have a coffee stand inside the lobby and the young lady that works there is the friendliest staff member in the hotel! And lastly, there were always taxis stationed outside the hotel. Unlike taxis that we took from other places in the city, these taxis are used to tourists and are more friendly. 

Now the not so great part. By far the worst part is the check in area. We arrived after check in and our room still wasn’t ready. One guy complained that he’s been waiting for 4 hours for a room but he also arrived early. No matter the time of day, the line for check in/ out is long. The lobby is filled with guests sitting on their suitcases. You’d think it was a train station. The check in staff isn’t friendly, possibly because they are overworked. We stayed in other hotels throughout Spain and were checked in quickly. It seems that even the check in process, once you make it to the front desk, is very long. Even if you have children, they ask for their passports. Weird! For the amount they charge per room, they could add a few more folks to keep the check in process moving. When we checked out, we only dropped off the key, as the line to the counter was very long. The other not so great part, is the location. Perhaps many folks like staying near Las Rambles, but for us it was too busy. We don’t blame the hotel for this, but know that you are in a very chaotic area when booking here. 

This hotel is expensive and not worth the amount that we paid. If you’re in the area, stop by the restaurant for brunch and a coffee. It’s the best part of the hotel!",3,2022,08,07
37,"Excellent service, beautiful room","The location of this hotel is perfect.  We really enjoyed our stay, close to everything.  Beautiful room.  We had been on a cruise and of course arrived too early to check in.  So we explored for a few hours, and found out we could not get into the Sagrada Familia without a previous booking.  Diego Aznar , the front office supervisor was extremely helpful and offered to get our tickets for us as we could only get them online.  That made our trip complete.  Very professional and helpful.  Many thanks to Diego",5,2022,07,29
37,Great Location! Clean Hotel!,"This is a great hotel in a great location - just steps off of La Rambla. We could walk to the starting point of all of our tours.

37,Excellent hotel,Hotel is clean and in very good location. Staff such as Ivan at the reception are very friendly and helpful. Ivan gave us a map and explained to us the direction to the recommeded places to visit during our 5-day stay. It’s a hotel that will make your stay here a wonderful experience.,5,2022,07,17
37,Poor hotel,"I am a very frequent guest at Le Meridiens.  I tend to like them a lot.  This one is by far the worst.  I stayed for 3 nights and nothing good came out of it.
On arrival there was no one helping to carry the luggage up the stairs.  Surly guests and some staff loitering around doing pretty much nothing.  Check-in was very chaotic.  This even-though I had pre-checked in on their own app.  I also have the highest status supposedly.  That was what the front-office manager man shouted, obviously trying to show off to his junior female colleagues: ""Oh I check in every day at least 5-10 Ambassadors level and I cannot get you a better room"".  Even though loads were commercially available on their app for the same stay we had.  I am sure the junior colleagues will have no respect either for repeat guests, in this hotel.  Hospitality is not their strongest side.  With poor management like that, the staff will be rude as well...
Cleaning is not either.  The common parts were grubby as well.
Breakfast was of poor quality.  
WIFI did rarely work in our room - even at the ""premium speeds"".
There is no swimming pool and the gym is laughably small.
Aircon was so so.
The location is OK.  Even though my girlfriend got robbed on the first night, just outside the hotel!  So overall not a good experience.  It seems the place is a tourist trap.  Dangerous around Ramblas.",1,2022,07,15
37,Luxury and comfort.  Just What we needed for our 2 day stay,"The room was very comfortable and probably the best bed we had over our 21 days in Europe.  We were right in the heart of La Rambla, such a fun area.  Personnel were also very helpful.  We did pay extra for the breakfast buffet and it was one of our favorite in Europe.  Mercat De las Boqueria (the huge market) was just down the street.  ",5,2022,06,27
37,"Great service at the restaurant,","We stayed at Le Meritian Hotel in Barcelona, and decided to eat at the restaurant that this hotel had to offer. We had an amazing waitress, Alba Ramos who was very efficient and helpful! She gave good recommendations about the food and catered around us! Overall a great experience at this delicious restaurant!",5,2022,06,25
37,beware of this hotel - air conditioning does not work well. supposed luxury that lacks!,the hotel is in a great location and the property has a lot of potential. however i asked front desk to check the AC - and they come and turn it on - however later on they turn it off again so the room get's hot. i had to deal with this for 3 nights and no sleep. on the 4th night i really got upset and they kept the a/c on. only then did they keep the a/c on.,1,2022,06,13
37,Busy hotel.  Suite with small window. ,Started 1N. Property is located just off the busy Ramblas street. Front desk perpetually busy resulting in a longer wait at check-in. Was upgraded to a 1BR suite with a very small window.  The living room was depressing and without a window.  Bed was comfy. Warm showers.  Big breakfast spread in the adjoining restaurant.  ,3,2022,06,12
37,"Perfect hotel, perfect location","We stayed several nights in the Le Meridian before and after a cruise and it was the perfect base for us to explore Barcelona. After we returned from our cruise it was like coming home. 

The location is absolutely perfect. Las Ramblas is is outside the door. The Boqueria Market is blocks away as are several amazing plazas. 

The staff is amazing!  The bellmen, doormen, front desk staff and housekeeping are super friendly and welcoming. 

The rooms are spacious, well appointed and super clean. Due to the nature of our trip we stayed in three different rooms and all were great. A couple nights on the 3rd floor Las Ramblas facing room. No problem with street noise but you can tell when the metro runs by no matter which floor. But that is another great thing being steps away from the metro as well as all bus stops. 

We spent a night in the 8th floor suite in the back of the hotel, absolutely huge with Mountain View’s.  Our last few nights were on the 4th floor also mountain facing, perfect room. 

The hotel has a beautiful roof top spa on the 6th floor with great views of the city and there is a grocery market next door to purchase anything you need and some great cheap sandwiches et jamon",5,2022,06,06
37,Excellent hotel - beautiful room and great service,"We had a corner suite which was just lovely.  The windows offered a great view,  The room was clean and well appointed.  Breakfast was included in our rate and it had a lot of good selections and was easy to get in and out.   They open at 7am for breakfast and there was quite a group ready at that time.  Front desk and bell staff were very helpful throughout,  This is a great hotel in a great location.",5,2022,05,23
37,Three Nights in Barcelona Pre Cruise,"The location of Le Meridien is on Las Ramblas upper end very close to Metro station at Placa de Catalunya and shops…El Corte Engles, Primark, C&A etc.  There is a Carrefour market next door with great selection of grab and go foods, fruit, wine etc.  The hotel is well maintained, quiet, very nice breakfast and the location cannot be beat. Great location for walkers. Very helpful front desk staff. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,05,23
37,"Amazing location, great service","If you like people watching, get a room on the first floor - and you can stare at Barcelona in motion all day.  Very nice service - so courteous.  We were traveling during COVID so found the breakfasts very limiting and very slow.  The coffee is also sub-par and we stepped out to the streets for real coffee.  They gave us chocolates to die for -",5,2022,05,21
37,Nightmare Stay - despite renovation,"Despite being a Marriott Gold Elite member I was put in a room in the 1st floor next to the elevators. It was not only noisy, the floor vibrated ! My colleagues think it could be the underground (subway) in La Rambla neighborhood. But I think it is the elevator. Avoid rooms next to the elevator and just in case avoid the 1st floor. The front desk lied to me claiming the only refurbished rooms where in the 1st floor. Careful -if they do this to a Marriott member I cannot imagine what they will do to a regular guest. Moreover, steep price for what the rooms have to offer despite being refurbished. For that price stay at Paseo de Gracia. Better neighborhood.

No more Le Meridien for me and no more La Rambla neighborhood. Noisy, busy and dirty. It will be difficult for Marriott to shake the service legacy of Le Meridien. Stick to traditional Marriott brands.",2,2022,05,20
37,Mediocre,"Mediocre hotel. Don't expect too much. It looks great in photos, but just a normal hotel. Clean and easy to find
They charge you extra for everything, so make sure you read everything before booking. Like breakfast (very mediocre as well) will cost you an easy 27 euro.
The staff was suppose to gives us directions to get to the F1 track, but still after 24 hours have not come up with anything.
You can probably find just as nice hotels for a better price.",3,2022,05,20
37,"Super quiet, great location, well-trained staff.","Right on La Rambla! 
Quiet & clean room, (which is the most important when you stay in the hotel), comfy bed. Amazing food in the restaurant, staff is profesional.
All our dinners (in the city) were recommended & booked by reception - they are so good, we were feeling like we had personalized service. 
Highly recommended! Just don't think, book it.
Super, super, super ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",5,2022,05,19
37,Great location and pleasant stay,"Our check  in was efficient and all staff were professional and friendly. The gentleman bringing our luggage to our room showed us how to operate the lights and AC . At our request, luggage racks were brought to the room. In room dining had a limited but delicious menu. I especially liked the octopus , grilled Caesar salad with chicken, and brownies. The bed was very comfortable and the curtains kept everything dark when pulled closed. The housekeeping staff always had a friendly smile and offered to assist with anything we needed for the room. The breakfast area in the Centonze Restaurant on the first level was clean and welcoming. The staff were exceptional and very attentive. The buffet consisted of a variety of items including eggs bacon vegetables , croquettes yogurt cereals breads fruit cups , juices and to top it off churros with chocolate sauce.Because of the variety we never tired of the breakfast buffet. We left  early in the morning on the day of our departure and a bagged breakfast was prepared for us as we requested. Taxis were always waiting outside of the hotel-even  at 6:30 in the morning. The taxi fare from the hotel to the airport was €49.
There is a large grocery store around the corner from the hotel. The room has a small refrigerator but no freezer. We enjoyed the complementary tickets to Palau Guell.which was a 15 minute walk from the hotel and a great place to visit.  The Barcelona cathedral was about a 15 minute walk away also. Hop on hop off buses were located within a 10 minute walk and the metro was convenient. We found a self-serve laundry place and an eat-in or takeout  reasonably priced Chinese restaurant Feng Wei, two streets away.  There was an antigen  and PCR Covid testing laboratory nearby on Carrer de l’Hospital.",5,2022,05,11
37,Vacation,"Excellent stay at LeMeridian in Barcelona. Hotel facilities very clean and hotel in a good condition. I enjoyed the food at the restaurant which the chef was able to prepared special requests since I have many food issues.  All the personal at the hotel were very friendly and extremely helpful. Special thank you to every body at the front desk and all the personal in the restaurant. Definitely, I will booked in this hotel. Thank you to everyone! See you soon!  Guadalupe",5,2022,05,11
37,Brilliant concierges; perfect location for a weekend !,"Many thanks to Ricardo, Bruno and the rest of the team for making our weekend fantastic. These two know everyone, everyplace and every restaurant in Barcelona and it’s area it seems.  Brilliant recommendations! 

The hotel is bright and modern with an excellent breakfast and restaurant.  Very welcoming service.

Service in the restaurant is as charming as efficient.  The restaurant manager expertly rushed to assist with first aid after I had a small trip over the sidewalk.  Above and beyond duty and kindness - thank you so very much.

The location is unbeatable.  Definitely our to go place in Barcelona",5,2022,05,02
37,Great location but . .,"The hotel has a great central location but good luck in getting any room w a view. I booked a room w a king size bed but none was available w a bath tub and a big window.  Chose a back room to get the king but it was not comfortable in what to expect in a 5 stars hotel.
The breakfast was excellent and house keeping was meticulous. 
The internet is strong but you have to pay for it and get reimbursed.  Kind of strange.
The hotel staff seem inexperienced,  my reservation was prepaid through Delta airlines hotel site but the hotel charged me the same booking total instead of just charge my card for incidentals. My credit card alerted me and I notified the front desk staff who admitted the mistake and fixed it. Just be careful and review your bill carefully.",3,2022,04,26
37,Well located !,We picked Le Meridian as we had Marriott points to use for a 1 night pre cruise stay. Good choice as nice hotel and well located off La Rambla . Nice size well equipped double room with small balcony overlooking entrance. Room was very clean and well prepared,5,2022,04,16
37,Loved my stay and the staff,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. We stayed for one night, went to Seville and came back for 3 nights. The staff greeted us like old friends and made sure we had an amazing room. They were so helpful whenever we needed anything and have such positive attitudes. I love my new Le Méridien family and will definitely come back. Much geacias111",5,2022,03,19
37,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"You really cannot beat this location if you intend to explore Barcelona on foot or using the Metro. It is also close the final Airport Bus, so getting in from an international flight is easy (as long as you pack reasonably). Great staff, especially the daytime concierge, Bruno, who is one of the best and friendliest concierges I have met. He made my day great multiple times. Room was spacious and quiet. Cleaning staff did a great job as did the breakfast staff. I would stay there again in a second.",5,2022,03,18
37,Great Hotel!!!,Excellent hotel in an excellent location right in the centre of La Ramblas. This is the second time i have stayed here…. Rooms are modern and clean. Hotel staff are efficient and helpful…..nothing to fault… good selection of drinks at the bar… and the room service club sandwich is to die for,5,2022,03,07
37,Never Again,"I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and never ever have I seen such low life people like in the Le Meridien in Barcelona. The first night in the restaurant, four guys persuaded the waitress to show her face beyond the mask; she was clearly uncomfortable, and no fault of the hotel, just a typical display of male........ 

Going to sleep in room 609 was no fun. I could hear every word of 60+ old Americans curse, scream, laugh and use extremely vulgar language until 3:00AM. When I got up at 8:00AM to go to work and turned on the TV, I got loud banging on the wall to shut the f.... up.

The second night in the restaurant, a guy passed out in his chair, at 9:00PM. Although security personal was there, looking at the guy, nobody did anything. Eventually, friends came and took him away.

The restaurant is extremely loud and rowdy, and food is mediocre. Barcelona has great restaurants, don't waste your time eating there. I could go on and on how old guys hooked up  with some other American ladies 3/4th of their age, but I leave it at that...... kind of nasty.

As for the room, it was ok, I was upgraded to a suite. Stains on the sofa and horrible insulation from the nasty neighbors, maybe a regular room would have been better. 

Sorry Le Meridien. This was my second stay, but it was really disappointing. I am sure that some people wouldn't mind what I experienced, but then again, it all depends on the clientele that you are looking for. As I am sitting here writing the review, I hear the lady behind me say that she was a bad, bad girl. And then.... all her experiences. Oh wow!",1,2022,03,05
37,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic staff, fantastic location. I could not recommend this hotel more.","As a travel agent I frequently travel to hotels before I recommend them to clients. From my first email my experience has been fantastic. The staff where so quick to respond to any questions and enquiries I had. We arrived early and thankfully our room was ready and Rodrigo made sure we where assisted with our luggage. (He also printed off our boarding passes and passenger locator forms ready for our departure the next day which was a lovely gesture) I was privileged to meet with Sandra the sales and marketing director for a coffee (they have the BEST coffee) as she told me all about the brand I then had a hotel tour with Guillermo which was incredible. The staff are so passionate when speaking about the hotel, the history and the art influence. You will find unique pieces of artwork in all rooms and on all floors it really adds to the ambience. Guillermo also showed me the spa and terrace which is accessible to  all guests, and a perfect place to watch the sunsetting over the city. We stayed in a premium king room with a Las Ramblas view  the room was perfect, stylish, spacious and luxurious. They even left a little gift for my daughter. Anywhere you went within the hotel you are greeted with a helpful smile (even from the General Manager) Everyone was so welcoming and happy to help. Sandra and the concierge had recommend some lovely little tapas bars and they even went out of there way to offer to make a reservation. This hotel really is in the heart of the city and in my opinion the best location. The hotel is 111 steps from the famous Mercat de la Boqueria a fantastic food market which is definitely worth a visit. I would also recommend grabbing a drink in the hotel bar. Alejandro R makes the best espresso martinis. I really could not recommend this hotel more and i look forward to visiting again and sending some clients. A big thumbs up to Le Meridien Barcelona Team x",5,2022,02,24
37,The amazing service at the Le Meridien Barcelona,"During our visit to Barcelona we stayed at this hotel, the front desk associates provided an amazing service, their personal touch and dedication to service was excellent. Olga ensured that our visit and accommodations were perfect. Each person we met provide great service to us. The bar experience was great, Alejandro creative mixologist technic ensured that our drinks were perfect every time. The restaurant associates ensured that our meals were delivered and prepared to perfection.
The management team provide excellent follow up",5,2022,02,05
37,Highly recommended,"Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights. Hotel staff is extremely helpful and friendly and will go out of there way to make sure you’re happy and cared for. Food is also excellent, especially their breakfast at the Cent Onze restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2022,02,05
37,Le Meridien Barcelona...a great stay,"Could not be happier with Le Meridien Barcelona. Great accommodations with even better service. Located right at the start of La Rambla and easy access to everything. I especially want to give the highest of compliments to a front desk person by the name of Sasitorn. Not only did she take the time to answer our very detailed questions, she went above and beyond to make sure we settle in okay and even ask her co-workers to follow up with us to make sure we get everything we need even after her shift. I don't think I've ever had a more wonderful experience when it comes to hotel customer service and I've been to many great locations around the world. Highly recommended. ",5,2022,01,29
37,Fantastic hotel in rambles,"A wonderful hotel just in rambles where all the shopping stores and very close to plaza Catalonia. The lobby of the hotel looks really nice gives you the feeling of a real 5 star property, rooms are also nice with step out balconies. Staff are really friendly and helpful. 

Rooms has espresso machine and coffee station. All other facilities of luxury property is there. Great house keeping service. 

I enjoyed my stay most. Only one constructive comment, rooms need more attention when it comes to maintenance but it was not annoying to us.",5,2022,01,27
37,Great hotel in center of Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while we were on vacation in Barcelona.  We really enjoyed the stay and the hotel was excellent. 
 
The hotel is located in the center of town on La Rambla which is a perfect location for sightseeing.  It's an easy walk to the market, the port, and other areas of Barca.   There is a taxi stand right outside which is also convenient.  The location is definitely in the tourist area so it is pretty busy.  If you want something a bit quieter and off the main road then perhaps this wouldn't be ideal for you.  There is a COVID testing center a few blocks away which was very convenient.

We got one of the newly renovated rooms with a king bed on the third floor.  The room was a great size, especially by euro standards.  Everything was clean and well-appointed.  The bed was a true king bed and very comfortable.  The bathroom was large with excellent water pressure for the shower.  

We didn't try the bar or restaurant so I can't say anything about that.  It looked nice and was busy at times so I assume it's good.

The only area of improvement would be the wifi.  It was very slow with a weak signal.  We didn't have to do much work while we were there but I can see how that may be an issue for someone.

Overall, a really great stay and a hotel I would recommend and come back to when visiting Barcelona.",5,2022,01,26
37,Feels like home !,"Fabulous hotel in the city center of Barcelona. Everything made me feel at home - from an exquisite suite, to the very friendly staff, to starting my days with a lovely breakfast at their cozy restaurant overlooking las ramblas. Definitely a place to recommend for any holiday or getaway stay while in Barcelona!  Will certainly call this my new bcn home :)",5,2022,01,03
37,Helped Me Through Medical Emergency,"I had a medical emergency on the road, something every traveler abhors, and I'm very thankful to Le Meridien Barcelona for helping me through it.   I ate something not good and was in terrible pain; my wife called the front desk asking for help.  Ms. Leire answered the call and we are very grateful she did.

She got our details and called an ambulance.  She kept us informed even though we were having trouble with our room phone. She stayed with us while the medics worked and translated when we ran into language problems.  She provided extra water, towels, anything that was needed.  In short, she did everything possible and with a very reassuring attitude that helped keep us calm in a painful and panicked situation. 

I am fully recovered and traveling again, thanks to Ms. Leire, Le Meridien Barcelona, and the medics who took such great care.",5,2021,12,18
37,Barcelona Experience,"Very nice hotel on Les Ramblas!  The room was great…. They did upgrade me to a suite, so that was super nice.   Our view was Les Ramblas.   The fitness center seemed to be an afterthought as it was in the basement.   It was good but needed some windows.  If willing to pay the price…. Excellent location for a great hotel.",5,2021,11,14
37,"Wonderful Hotel, Outstanding Staff!","Great hotel! Wonderful staff. I was here for 5 wonderful days in a Terrace Suite. The staff is so helpful and kind. The hotel is in a great location with many restaurants and shops near by. Breakfast is great, the hotel smells amazing and I really can’t say enough good things about the staff. They made every day wonderful. There is a COVID testing site Creu Blanca that is right up the street. I can’t wait to return!",5,2021,11,08
37,"Never again, worst hotel ever in my life","First of all i ordered transfer from airport which never show up, when we check in the lady said sorry, they will check, we stayed 5 x days no any answer…., the room what they gave us is very small, nothing like in a pictures, the most bad thing is the bathroom is smelling , i ask to fix it, but can’t!
So we stayed with my family on holiday smelling sit in 5 days on a holiday trip in Barcelona, First day they charge me the full ammount + 50 euro / day for deposits from my debit card, today we check out they cant give back the difference in cash we will see they make transfer back. This hotel is expensive but nothing like in picture or service, i have been much cheaper and better hotel in Barcelona, please don’t book this hotel if you would like to feel good, in my side is a one star hotel with a terrible service, only one good thing is the location!
Never again this hotel not in the world!
Very unsutisfied!!!",1,2021,10,27
37,Great Stay In Barcelona,"What a lovely 5 night stay. Very nice hotel in a good location.  A major subway station (La Catalunya) was close, making it easy to access all parts of town.  Just a couple of blocks away is La Boqueria, the market that is a must. Excellent place for lunch.  And the little cafe around the corner, BAR LOBO, makes a mean cosmo.  

The staff at La Meridien was extremely friendly and helpful.  The bellman gave us the lowdown on how to protect yourself from the pickpockets on Las Ramblas, so that was not a problem. The breakfast was included (Titanium perk) and was always fresh with good service.   The room (upgraded) was well appointed and clean.  The best shower ever!  The required COVID antigen test was available at a place just a short walk away (Euro35)

Would strongly recommend Le Meridien when in Barcelona.",5,2021,10,21
37,Nice place for diner,"I had diner here with my friend, it was absolutely delicious. The staff, Muhammed and Javier were super kind, they explained the menu and attended to our needs quickly. 
The food was excellent and very tasty.",5,2021,10,20
37,Top place to stay in Barcelona,"Well deserved five star hotel and Top location to enjoy Barcelona just on the Rambla. Room clean and with a very nice balcony and enough space considering you are in an historical building. 
Staff very professional. Special mention to Achille very proactive and helpful.",5,2021,09,02
37,Very efficient staff. Concierge service was great,"The hotel is centrally located. 
The staff extremely very accommodating, professional and attentive.  
The rooms size is what you would expect for a downtown hotel. 
The rooms and bathrooms are very modern (size was amazing).",5,2021,09,01
37,Great two nights stay,"We had a great stay at Le Meridian in Barcelona. It is very centrally located so it’s easy to get to a lot of the sites. There’s also several taxi stands nearby if you need to travel a little further. 
The staff was great and our room was very comfortable for a family of three, two adults and one teen. We had great room service and the hotel was beautiful. Definitely at low capacity. 
The breakfast was good. Not great but good. 
The terrace was open and so was the jacuzzi. We didn’t use it because we weren’t there long. 
Overall a really great hotel and would highly recommend.",5,2021,08,29
37,Nice hotel,"The location of hotel is perfect. In the middle of The Ramblas. 6 minutes walk from Placa Cataluyna. Supermarket,bakeries and La Boqueria close by. 
Most personnel was friendly and nice.  Specially Diego from front desk.  He was extremely friendly,helpful and professional.  Will definitely recommend this hotel",5,2021,08,28
37,City centre hotel,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien, mainly because of the fantastic experience in the middle of the Rambla. Right in the heart of Barcelona: incredible to do some sightseeing.

Staff at the front office was very kind and professional, and provided great help at check-in booking us an extra room, as we found the premium rooms a bit too small to stay in with 3 people. Beautiful bathrooms and great beds for a good sleep.

Breakfast was a la carte together with a small buffet. Very kind staff, unfortunately they seemed to be understaffed. 

Could definitely recommend!",4,2021,08,17
37,Love this hotel!,"My second time staying here. We actually checkout out of the EDITION hotel early due to disappointment being a Platinum member. This hotel delivers! While this hotel is  a little older, we got the complimentary breakfast and suite upgrade which we are accustomed to. The room was huge with a walk in closet and the customer service is fantastic. Perfect location as well. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2021,08,07
37,Location and staff,"I was back to the hotel after about 5 years. Previously we stayed at Ritz or W. 

This time I wanted to stay close to La Rambla and this is exactly where the hotel is on. 

As in the previous stays I was upgraded to a junior suite. It is a great suite , one bedroom and one living room, very comfortable and impeccably clean .  Overall the hotel cleanliness and hygiene is on the highest level. 

Location is just around the corner on the northern end of La Rambla. Everything is literally within a few meters: Carrefour , shops , restaurants, the clinic for PCR test, the Boqueria market , and many more. 

Yet it is always quite in the room despite the permanent crowd on the street. 

The hotel has its own parking space with just 5 or 6 lots which should be reserved in advance. The hotel staff is always happy to park and deliver your car themselves (highly recommended to avoid waiting at the parking gate and negotiating narrow way to the lot). 

The staff is extremely polite, nice , smiling and helpful. Well done. 

The only minor wrinkle was the breakfast . There was only one staff for several tables and she was very busy . Also the choice was very limited and the pancakes I ordered were not really edible. After the first morning, I opted to have a breakfast at the nearby Starbucks.  

All in all, it was a great stay. I recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be in the middle of action and enjoy the great service and facilities.",5,2021,08,01
37,Excellent location,"Very nice property right on Las Ramblas the main walking street in Barcelona. Very convenient location walking distance from the shops, marina, Gothic quarter and restaurants. We got upgraded to a nice room, and were offered free breakfast due to our Titanium status. The breakfast had plenty of variety. 
Would greatly recommend as a property very centrally located.",5,2021,04,04
37,Great customer service and location,"We were fortunate enough to stay at this hotel for 3 nights right before everything was shut down for COVID.  

Angela from the experience team reached out to me a few days before our stay and was able to provide many recommendations for our first trip to Barcelona. Upon my request, she was also able to upgrade us to a Junior Suite with Terrace, overlooking La Rambla and the beautiful skyline. We arrived slightly before check-in which meant our room wasn't ready but the front desk was very nice about it and I appreciated that Angela and her manager came out to greet us because of the inconvenience (which really wasn't an inconvenience at all!) There was also a lovely note and sweet treat dropped off while we were out.

The room was well laid out and spacious, with the terrace providing an unforgettable view of BCN. The bed itself is comfortable and while I can sympathize with some reviews saying the bathroom may be a little worn, it still has a luxury feel to it overall. Daily deliveries of water was also greatly appreciated. I cannot speak to the quality of housekeeping as I opted for green choice instead.

The location itself is ideal for exploring the city and the hotel provides complimentary tickets to Palau Guell, which is also worth a visit. The location on La Rambla may be too loud for some people but it wasn't a nuisance unless someone was actively blasting music down on the street.

As a Titanium member, I've stayed in many hotels and I can confidently say that this is a hotel with a great location. We will definitely look to stay here on future trips to Barcelona.",5,2020,10,15
37,A special hotel in the center of Barcelona,Picked this hotel in a city I had never visited and boy I hit the jackpot!  Wonderful employees who gave me a room with a deck overlooking all of Barcelona East to the sea. Watched the W Hotel and the giant Ferris wheel as the sun set. Stayed 5 days but by day two all of the employees knew me by name and treated me like a queen. Highly recommended. Also directly across the street is an Italian restaurant with great wood fired pizza.,5,2020,04,13
37,Just home from Spain lockdown,"We arrived to normal circumstances in Barcelona March 11 intending to stay until March 18. World events overcame us and we ended up cutting our trip short and leaving Monday March 16. Saturday March 14 the country closed down all restaurants, retail except essential services so tourists were only allowed to eat at their own hotels and starting the 15th we were to stay in the hotel except to go to airport, market, hospital etc. Things got weird quickly. Every member of staff at Le Meridien was exceptional during our stay. 

The hotel manager was very proactive explaining the Spanish government's restrictions, the front desk staff changed our reservation and did not charge us for cutting our trip short, the workers at the restaurant, the cleaning staff, everyone was great.

As for regular criteria, loved the neighborhood, very convenient, room was good sized, high ceilings, nicely remodeled. Normally we don't eat in hotel restaurants, but we did and we were very pleased with the food. The nicest people, when things get back to normal go and support them.",5,2020,03,19
37,Great Staff - Great location,"This hotel is centrally located in the old Barcelona with fantastic staff to guide you throughout the city. 
Very nice rooms and very quiet for the central location. The only two negatives for me were not a lot of vegan food and not a very good gym. However I can highly recommend this hotel if you’re going for a vacation visit to Barcelona",5,2020,03,11
37,Ideal hotel in the heart of it all,"Top notch hotel in every regard.  Clean, spacious room. Warm attentive staff.  The location can’t be beaten. Right on Las Rambla with a short walk to La Boqueria and the Gothic Quarter.  Really excellent.  Highly recommended.",5,2020,03,11
37,Good location but very noisy,"Hotel is located few meters from the Ramblas.

Bell boy offered help with mu luggage only after I took my belongings out of the taxi, took it by the stairs and entered the lobby. at this stage I did not need his help.
 
lobby has very small sitting area and it is not comfortable.

Room is very noisy at night up to 3 am with non stop truck off loading just below my window to the supermarket nearby.

toilet paper is both very thin and low quality - bad combination

air condition in the room was very noisy, had to call a technician who came and cleaned the filter (why don't they do it on a regular basis before the guest enters the room).

no separate shower, it is combine with the bath.

as an elite member there was no welcome note in the room, only on the following day after some problems with the breakfast they sent me a fruit plate with a cava and an apology note

Hotel looks very nice from the outside and the staff speak English fluently, but hotel has to fix all the problems mentioned above",3,2020,02,29
37,Great Hotel,"We enjoyed a 3 night stay at the Le Meridian.

The hotel location is excellent.  In the center, on the primary shopping street, and walk-able to almost everywhere in Barcelona.

The staff was friendly and efficient, and the quality of the hotel is very good.  Our room was spacious, quiet, nicely decorated, and very clean.  Everything worked.

Breakfast each day was an extensive layout of food and drink options, with attentive wait staff.  

This is a great hotel.  The price was reasonable and reflected good value.  We'd try to stay here again if we ever come back to Barcelona.",5,2020,02,28
37,Great hotel. Great location ,"Stayed for a couple nights prior to a cruise.  Great room.  Great location. Awesome breakfast. Walking distance to a bunch of places to eat. Not far from a hop on hop off bus stop (I highly suggest taking the tour if you have the time, totally worth the money) ",5,2020,02,20
37,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel was lovely and the location great.  Our room was very clean and comfortable. The staff were all very helpful and friendly.  The daily breakfast is worth getting, it was wonderful. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2020,02,17
37,"Great hotel, top-notch customer service","My Le Meridian experience in Barcelona was phenomenal. 

First of, I was traveling on a business trip from India to Barcelona. The trip also happened to coincide with my birthday. I took a 15 hour flight in and was exhausted coming to the hotel. When I walked into my room, I was greeted with a handwritten note wishing me happy birthday along with wine and chocolate! I was completely surprised and whoever took the initiative to go above and beyond truly made my day. I'm a Le Meridian guy now every time I come to Barcelona.

The concierge was also very helpful. The lady helped us book sightseeing trips and gave us advice and options on when/where is the optimal places to go. 

Lastly, the on-site restaurant is pretty good as well. All in all, highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,02,12
37,Great hotel Great service ,"The hotel lovely hotel is in a great location, my room was renovated, clean and modern, the bed super comfortable, the reception team was very helpful and pleasant, great concierge service and the over all experience nice. ",5,2020,02,12

Hotel room nice, all you need!
Friendly staff ready to help!

Thank you for hospitality, Guillermo!",5,2020,02,11
37,Our hotel choice in Barcelona!,"My wife and I stayed in Le Meridien while spending a weekend in Barcelona. The hotel is conveniently located just off the main street - La Rambla, which makes it an ideal choice of a place to stay in the marvelous city of Barcelona.  
From the moment we stepped in the hotel, we were greeted by friendly and professional staff. The room was spacious, clean, and stylishly decorated. Even though we were in the center of a very busy street, it was very quiet in the room and nothing disrupted our rest.

On the final note, we would like to mention hotels receptionist Artem who went above and beyond to assist us and ensure that we had a pleasant stay.

Le Meridien will be our hotel choice for our future trips to Barcelona",5,2020,02,06
37,Great Location & Friendly Staff!,"Great location and friendly staff. Stayed over the New Year's eve and found the location was perfect. Highly recommend to anyone, a beautiful Food and Beverage team they had, special thanks to Ines Ladislau! Thank you again. H&K",5,2020,02,03
37,Excellent hotel on Las Ramblas,"Had an excellent stay at Le Meridien Barcelona hotel. I loved everything about the hotel! Beautiful quaint balcony overlooking the street and view of Las Ramblas.  Location is superb. All the staff at the front counter went out of their way to assist with any questions and were extremely helpful and pleasant! 

The breakfast special that was offered was the highlight of my stay and enjoyed the buffet every morning. Many local options plus American staples as well as normal breakfast buffet choices. And I have to say the croissants were the BEST I have ever tasted in my life!!!

Extra special thank you to Jordi, who made us feel very welcome and gave great tips and suggestions!

I look forward to staying again there on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2020,02,03
37,Great hotel in fabulous location ,"I’ve been to Barcelona three times on business travel, and this is by far my favorite hotel. It is centrally located, and the staff is fabulous!

There is a breakfast buffet plus room service, mini bar, good-powered hair dryers and flat irons. The rooms are comfortable. There is a small gym on site with a spa. 

I highly recommend! ",5,2020,02,03
37,Very average ,"With so many wonderful places to stay in Barcelona I would give this one a miss. The rooms are adequate in a full corporate style, bathrooms are annoying in that the shower is within the bath. The restaurant dining area is like something out of the 1980s with ugly dated and tacky furniture. Food is grossly overpriced and low in quality. Service is kind. But genuinely if you are coming all the way to Barcelona for a holiday look around for something more special - there’s many places better. ",3,2020,01,28
37,"excellent location, superb service - overall fantastic hotel","The hotel itself is immaculately clean, every single staff member provided a fantastic service. Great location - just off the Ramblas. 

The rooms themselves are very spacious, beds super comfy, showers warm and powerful. 
Hairdryer, straightners, iron, ironing board, safe, bathrobes and slippers, speaker, mini fridge, complimentary water and toiletries provided in every room. The rooms also have a USB socket in addition to the usual. 

Breakfast and lunch were lovely - plenty of options, always restocked and different food daily. 

Highly recommend Le Meridien - no faults whatsoever.
Fantastic stay!",5,2020,01,23
37,Lovely hotel,"Situated on la Rambla a short walk from Barcelona marina, the cathedral, bustling shops and markets, the hotel is everything you’d expect from this chain. The staff are helpful and friendly, and rooms are well appointed and comfortable- only downside is I couldn’t get air con working in my room of an evening, though since I spent little time there it wasn’t a major issue. ",4,2020,01,19
37,Wonderful view and attention,"The front desk staff were very inviting.  I arrived quite early and they completed checking, held my luggage and provided me with complinetary coffee until the room was ready.  I received a beautiful king suite with wrap around windows overlooking the city and Gothic Cathedral.  House keeping was top notch and all members of the staff were polite.  The bedding was comfortable and the shower amenities nice.  The bathroom is a bit dark, so ladies may want to step into the main room for makeup lighting.  I did go down to the bar one evening.  They were hosting some type of conference and the attendees were in there.  It was quite loud so I stepped across the street for another option.

There is lots of shopping, food and sights within steps or a few minutes walk from the hotel.  Overall, a great stay.",5,2020,01,17
37,"Winter stay, was ok","Pros: Nice location, very nice staff, spotlessly clean hotel. Ample breakfast choices at the overpriced buffet. Umbrellas available downstairs were a nice perk. 
Cons: waiting 15minutes for coffee at the buffet is annoying. No self serve coffee option did not sit well with this caffeine addict. When it was finally delivered it was delicious. Also beware of food labeling it is misleading, “vegetarian “ included turkey in a sandwich our last am.. when I brought it to the attention of one of the staff he explained the veg wraps were finished (not my point... food was plentiful just good luck if you have any allergies or dietary concerns).
Whirlpool was malfunctioning. Disappointing. And annoying that was not made clear when I asked where it was :(. 
Complimentary tickets to Palau Güell were promised. At check in (around midnight) I was told that there is one ticket in the room and I could get another the following day from the concierge who is available all day. I tried the following day after our am tour.. concierge was at lunch. Came back later, waited ten minutes while another family was being helped only to be sent back to the check in desk. Waited on line again , spoke to another clerk who finally got us the extra ticket . Not clear if the reservation was for two , and they had wine ready for us chilling in the room why placing two tickets there to avoid aggravation is complicated.
All in all very clean, ample staff but disorganized a bit, great location, lots of breakfast options, we had a good time. Would stay again if whirlpool was functioning, coffee was self serve and price was right.",3,2020,01,12
37,Wonderful visit!,"Hotel was perfectly located near Las Ramblas, gothic area etc. Everything  is walking distance and all the staff were wonderful! Breakfast was also excellent. Highly recommend this hotel and we will stay here on any future trips to Barcelona.",5,2020,01,12
37,Le Meridian Barcelona worst experience I’ve ever had and I travel for a living.,"Absolutely horrible customer service and not family friendly at all. Long story but they got our room type wrong, blamed our travel agent, and then forced us to upgrade because we were 2 adults and 2 kids and would not let us cancel. Hotel was $600 a night and the managers were as rude as can be. Some bright spots were the concierge (thought they needed another one due to demand) and the bartender. It really was the worst stay ever. Marriott should be embarrassed. For that price this should be more than a hostel with lipstick. Really really disappointed. Will never use the brand again as a result. Good luck. On a positive note, Barcelona is amazing!!",1,2020,01,09
37,Excellent location and hotel,"We are a family of 4 with 2 teens and stayed here for 5 days/4nights. The two rooms were excellent: clean, plenty of space in bathroom, great view, and a coffee machine! 
The hotel had an excellent breakfast buffet that we indulged in before heading out to a full day of sightseeing.
The hotel is close to everything. Less than 10min walk to Hop on/off bus.
Super friendly staff with excellent recommendations of where to eat. 
We would highly recommend and stay here again. ",5,2020,01,05
37,Not great service,Staff was not friendly at all. They confirmed us room upgrade with our Marriott point but when we went they didn't do it. We had separate room for kids and they didn't give our two rooms on the same floor.,3,2019,12,31
37,Wonderful staff,"Excellent hotel located at the heart of Barcelona.  The front desk staff, Mr. Piedro Tripodu, took the time to explain to my family the locations and restaurants to visit.  Especially for the new year eve.  Friendly staff is what makes customers return to the hotel.",5,2019,12,28
37,Outstanding service,"The service, especially our check in agent and the waitress during the breakfast, was absolutely outstanding. After only one day the waitress recognized us and made us feel welcome. The check in (if BSA rated) was definitely 100%! ;-)

Unfortunately, we felt like being in a last sell room. If you have the chance to get an upgrade to one of the higher categories, take it!

The Spa is very small, but nice. Unfortunately the atmosphere on the rooftop terrace was not very good because of construction noises.

All in all - good location and very good employees!",4,2019,12,26
37,Excellent in every way,"Right off the Las Ramblas one of the main roads in barcelona, this hotel lacks nothing. The staff all of them great but especailly Inaki, Oskar and the rest, too many to named were the most helpful i have met in all my travels.The Hotel rooms are beautiful, clean and with every anmenity required. Great restaurent on the premises. Across the Hotel, 3 more excellen5t restaurants and of course God forgive us if there was no Starbucks less than 2 minutes away. stayed twic in November both in a regular room which was great and one night in a suite that was the envy of many hotels . Las ramblas is just outside your door and from there barcelona is at your command.",5,2019,12,22
37,Had a fabulous stay and it’s in a  great location.,"The hotel is right off las Rambla street and a short walk to the marketplace and the docks. I’ll be staying there again if we go back to Barcelona. Right around the corner is a little known Gaudi building, a place to get churros, and souvenirs. There’s also a pharmacy nearby too.",5,2019,12,21

37,Fabulous Rooftop Suites combined with outstanding service.,"Loved the experience at this hotel.  Spent three nights here and all service details were carefully reviewed, the outside terrace in our suite was lovely for morning coffee.  The Coffee bar offers yummy coffee and nice sweet rolls for a quick breakfast bite.  The Suite I was assigned was contemporary, very clean, comfortable and homey.

Thanks for an outstanding stay!  
 ",5,2019,12,16
37,"Fantastic location, great service - all around marvelous","First and foremost, the location of this hotel can't be beat - right off La Rambla, which is pretty much the central touristy area near the Gothic quarter. It's a short walk to several metro stops, tons of great food in the Gothic Quarter, the Barcelona Cathedral, and of course the Boqueria market! We were initially worried about noise, but despite having windows looking out right over La Rambla, we didn't hear street noise at all. All the benefits of being centrally located, with none of the downsides!

Second, the service was impeccable, in terms of both the big things and little. It's hard to pick a specific highlight - it was just all-around very smooth.

Facilities-wise, the hotel appears to be newly renovated, and the finishes in our room were very nice. As a bonus, we were fortunate to be upgraded to a delightful corner suite (all the more appreciated because we were celebrating a special occasion, and likely made possible because December is well into Barcelona's off-season),

One small downside is that there's no club lounge, but if there's anyplace in the world that this isn't an issue, it's here (given how central the hotel is to everything, including fantastic markets, it's less of a downside than e.g. an airport hotel). The upside of that, though, is that the Marriott Titanium breakfast benefit was at the hotel restaurant - which had a great buffet, friendly service, and excellent people-watching on La Rambla!

All around, I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2019,12,12
37,Le Meridien Barcelona,"This hotel is centrally located on La Ramblas and close to many attractions.  Plenty of places to eat nearby.  We decided to upgrade to the suite with terrace because it was 7 am when we checked in and our scheduled room wasn't ready.  Totally understandable as guests typically checkout at 1 pm.  The suite was very nice with beautiful appointed bathroom.  We were not disappointed with the upgrade.  Check in and checkout was very easy.  I think the employee(s)from the front door, security and front desk could be more engaging as guests enter and leave the establishment, hello and goodbye?  This would be the reason why I'm not leaving 5 stars.",4,2019,12,02
37,Five Star Experience,"Despite the negative reviews I read, which caused much apprehension prior to my arrival, The Le Meridien exceeded my expectations. We stayed in the newly renovated room which was nice, but nothing over the top. The hotel's location cannot be beat. The lobby, elevator and common areas are all nice, but the staff truly makes this hotel top notch. The breakfast is really good and the staff extremely attentive. There is cava being served in the lobby daily by a friendly gentlemen, someone was always available to assist, and every staff member we encountered greeted us with a smile. As Platinum Elite member, who has stayed at Marriott properties around the world, its rare to find a quality hotel with staff to match. I would highly recommend for your next visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,12,01
37,"Comfortable, clean, friendly","Our room was small, as is usual in Europe, but it had a king-size bed and a big bathroom with a huge tub. WiFi was free (at least for us Bonvoy Gold members; I don't know about others). Staff was invariably friendly and helpful. Their English was better than my Spanish (which is generally okay), so I didn't get much practice. This hotel is very centrally located and walking distance to many historical destinations. The on-site restaurant was reasonable and food was very good. Actually, everywhere we ate was very good. Hotel also had a small snack bar with hot and cold breakfast/snack items. Not gourmet but great (and inexpensive) for a quick getaway in the morning.",5,2019,11,30
37,nice hotel great location... BUT air conditioner is turned off completely during winter months,"I just checked into hotel,  rooms nice, good location. But, and it is a big but.... the air conditioner is turned off during winter months.  no air flow in rooms unless you want warm air.  NO CONTROL of air conditioning. Was told that the air conditioning turned off by management because it was an historic building ...Yet, when I called Marriott and asked them to check other Marriott hotels in Barcelona... the Cotton Hotel, an equally historic building did have functional air conditioning in winter when needed. Sorely disappointed.",3,2019,11,30
37,Nice hotel in a good location,"I arrived at the hotel at 4pm.  They told me I was upgraded to a suite due to my Platinum member status. However the room was not ready and so I waited about an hour until the room was cleaned.

The suite room was modern and quiet. It seems it was just being renovated. 

The hotel breakfast included as the Platinum benefit was very good.

The hotel location is ideal for tourists as it is right in the busy tourist area.",5,2019,11,27
37,Save Yourself & Head over to the EDITION or Cotton House! Only basic rooms have been renovated! *********BEWARE******,"Don’t even get me started!  Try spending the beginning of your two week vacation in Barcelona LeMeridian to a rusted toilet, scraped wall paint, cup stain ringed furniture, chipped tub, unglued tiled floor, a mirror you could hardly see yourself through and much more.  Never mind the 2 1/2 hrs of arguing just to get $50,000 points reinstated, for being in a room for 15 minutes MAX!  Oh and In the JR Suite! I should apparently be grateful!  I mean, I am titanium and I earned it.  You didn’t do me a favor! Le Meridian Barcelona 
I was told they were sorry it didn’t meet my expectations!   Ugh like are you out of your mind?   I wouldn’t even let my dog stay in that room!  Titanium status means nothing to them.  I must note I was reinstated the points however it took 3 weeks and countless emails!  @LeMeridianBarcelona sucks!  I have video, pictures, and emails should you need toilet seat reading!

Ask to see your room first BEFORE Check in!!!

Video was so long it wouldn’t upload.  But if you want to see it you can reach out!",1,2019,11,21
37,Great stay for us after our cruise,"We arrived here after 4 days on a cruise at 10:00am and they were able to accommodate us right away.It was nice to be able to be in a room early and begin oour sightseeing. Concierge offered great assistance in understaning cabs and walkable places. We received champagne when we returned from our sightseeing in the afternoon, great way to end the day. They also had 2 free waters and delivered a bowl of fruit and some more waters later in the evening - a very nice touch. They also set up the trundle bed upon our retrun for our 3rd person. Bathroom was a good size. Excellent bath products. Had dinner in the restaurant, fantastic food and brealfast was good too. enjoyed the varieties and good american and european choices. Convenient to Las Ramblas, enjoyed being able to step right out and enjoy the evening stroll. Doorman very good about getting taxis. Would stgay here again. ",5,2019,11,13
37,Disappointing visit,"I actually would give a 2.5 rating and was kind to round this off to a rating of 3.0.  We stayed here for 1 night.  The hotel is in a great location right off of Las Ramblas.   Had a pleasant buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  I am a Marriott Gold Elite member and when booking/confirming the reservation, I requested a room on a high floor in a quiet location.  I also mentioned that the purpose of this visit was to celebrate my wife’s birthday.  Upon arrival,  we were given a room on the 1st floor.  After experiencing lots of noise in both the late afternoon and mid evening, we asked for a room change for a quiet room on a high floor but was given the choice of either a 3rd or 4th floor(hotel has 9 floors).  We took the 3rd floor room which turned out to be fairly quiet but later in the evening, we discovered that the bathroom sink was completely clogged.  The next morning, we noticed that when showering the water leaked from the shower floor onto the bathroom floor.  Further, during this stay, my wife’s birthday was NEVER acknowledged at all by the staff.   Upon checking out, I told the checkout person of the above mentioned issues and got a very nonchalant, “I’m sorry” comment.  I have heard from the hotel manager after filling out a hotel survey that was e mailed to me.  He apologized for the issues and gave me a very minimal amount of Marriott Bonvoy points as a token of their apology.   If I return to Barcelona in the future, I will stay elsewhere.",3,2019,11,13
37,OLD STARWOOD PROPERTY WAS ANOTHER NAME 6 YEARS AGO,"THIS IS A 3 STAR HOTEL - ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION. The rooms are very smalllllllll....like really small. You can barley put your bag away on the small space they give you. The refrigerator is at least 20 years old, and was half empty of the items they wanted to sell you and it didn't work. The worst thing is the TV alarm woke me up in the middle of the night. I had to get up and find the remote. I NEVER TOUCHED IT, SO I DIDN'T DO IT. The bed is ok, the furniture is cheaper than Ikea quality the lamps are both plastic the tables are laminate, the small coach is cheap. The bathroom is tiny....This hotel should not be a a 5 star hotel at all. They offered to change the rrefridge, and the guy Brough a new one to swap out, but who wants to wait while they fix a crabby room....why didn't quality check happen before hand...why doesn't someone make sure no alarms are on. I read another reviewer had the same problem. The room was not completely remodeled, the shower was, but the closet is at least 30 years old, and the room had very small amount of teas...they brought me a hot water kettle, and they brought me ice. And the room was quiet and faced the back. And I did complain, and they did give me a bottle of Spanish sparkling wine.....I paid for one night a lot of money and the second night I used a lot of points. The manager, gave mea very small amount of points back,and offered to move to me a larger room....but the work involved he agreed wasn't worth it.  but I believe it cost me 25K points, so I feel cheated.....for a crappy hotel two nights.",2,2019,11,10
37,Great location but expensive,"This is a very nice hotel in a fantastic location but found it disappointing for the price.

Everything is very clean, very appealing, the rooms are spacious, comfortable and well kept, with a great bathroom and staff are very pleasant and friendly. The location is excellent, just off the Ramblas and within walking distance of so many great places to eat.

However for the price it was a bit disappointing. It's a very good hotel but for the price it's about average.

A word of warning, breakfast is outrageously expensive at 27 euros. It's a buffet service with well-cooked food and a decent choice but for that price I would expect champage and wagyu steak for breakfast. Just go out and find a cafe to have breakfast. It may not be as delicious but you'll get much better value for money.",3,2019,11,06
37,Lovely Hotel,"Located a short 2 blocks from the top of Las Ramblas/Plaça Catalunya this venue is convenient to shopping and transportation, Sta. Eulalia cathedral, historic El 4 Gats and reasonably priced meals. Starbucks is around the corner if the Spanish version of “Americano” isn’t your idea of coffee. Hotel staff were friendly and very accommodating. The concierge team was knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Green housekeeping option was available. We’d go back in a heartbeat. Only negative was scratchy TP.",5,2019,11,05
37,Excellent Pre-Cruse Stay,"We stayed one night, pre-Cruise.  Arrived at 11am, check in was quick and professional.  Baggage (lots of it) was quickly handled by bellmen.  They had a room ready for us (really appreciated after an over night flight).  They recognized my gold status and my gift was a voucher for a drink in the bar and they gave us a room upgrade.

The room (135) had recently been remodeled.  It was very nice and adequate for our needs.  The view was not so great, but that was okay.  The bathroom was particularly nice; large, clean and modern.

Two complimentary bottles of water were in the room, and we thought that was a nice touch.

The La Rambla neighborhood was very nice.  Very walkable and interesting.  This is our first time to Barcelona.",5,2019,11,04
37,The quality of the hotel and staff is matched by its superior location just off the La Rambla.,"The high quality of the hotel's public and recently renovated rooms and service-oriented staff is matched by its superb location just off the La Rambla in Barcelona. I have stayed in many hotels in Europe and this one rates as highly as any in terms of the quality of the physical building and the staff's focus on service. In addition, the hotel's location is perfect; close to most areas of interest for a visitor.",5,2019,11,03
37,What a Location!!,"Visited Barcelona June 2018 and stayed at a nearby hotel; wish I had stayed with Le Meridien. This trip I did. 

Room could be a little snug for a couple, but it’s Europe. Bath is terrific. Had a room away from the street; very quiet. Hotel restaurant was very good; breakfast was well done. Ate in one evening, and that was good. Location steps from Las Ramblas and around the corner from Plaza de Cataluyna can’t be compared. There’s a market close by, and a number of places close by to eat, including gelato. Fitness facility was a little on the thin side. Recumbent bike was nice; upright bike would have been better. Still 5 stars. ",5,2019,11,03
37,Great location great service ,Definitely one of the best location in barcelona. Door step to supermarket and shopping areas. Bruno front desk staff was superb while checking me in.

I stayed in a corner suite. it is nice. the room is small but living room (sala) is large and well prepared.
services is fantastic in terms of punctuality and friendliness. room service deliver orders in about 20 minutes. however, sometimes they don't pick up the phone so you have to call again in few minutes otherwise everything went perfectly.
I don highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,11,01
37,Friendly and helpful,"Hotel personnel are the most polite people We have ever seen, service is very near to perfection. we had some extra charges on our room for local calls and gentleman at front desk at the time of check out waived those charges for us. We had breakfast in the hotel for days we stayed and quality was great. Front desk gentlemen, Miguel and Achille were so helpful also the lady at concierge desk gave great recommendations for restaurants and attractions.",5,2019,10,30
37,A safe and excellent location with a great and efficient service,"We arrived Barcelona at the height of the recent protests (but with caution, awareness and common sense specially when traveling) there was never a time that we felt unsafe staying at the Le Meridien (La Rambla). 
This was a last minute choice, as I decided to cancel our previous hotel reservation located in the marina area, and we couldn’t be happier that we made the right choice! You can’t go wrong with the location of this one. Very centrally located and walkable to most major areas and sightseeing landmarks. Lots of restaurants in the area. A supermarket and pharmacy next door. 
This made it very convenient for us to move around even on foot given the limited transportation available during the strikes and protests. 
Prior to our arrival, an experience specialist, Ms Daisy Lau, reached out to me regarding our plans in Barcelona during our stay and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. (I did mention to her that I was celebrating my birthday in Spain)
At check in, we were greeted by a smiling Mr Bruno Miranda & were very delighted to have been given a corner suite (a wonderful treat indeed, thank you!) We arrived an hour before check in time but he gave us a holding room to freshen up and temporarily keep our luggages in, while the suite was being prepared. Jordi helped us with our bags and Diego from the front desk assured us that the safety deposit box in the room was ok to use.(I did mention to him about a review I read of an incident regarding lost items from the safe deposit box & the safety in the hotel. He assured us that there should be no problems at all.) True to his words, everything went perfectly fine. 
The suite was comfortable,clean and quiet with sound proofed windows, despite its proximity to La Rambla. We slept very well. 
The bathroom was clean (except for some minimal stains of a cigarette burn on a portion of the tub, which we never used) The entire hotel is a non smoking hotel. 
The ever so efficient Alessio, took care of us during our daily breakfast. The staff at Le Meridien was warm, cheerful and efficient. There are times of the day wherein the front desk & concierge can get very busy although this was not really a problem. The staff continuously issued updates during the time of the protests. 
Again, many thanks to everyone who made our stay in Barcelona special and a memorable one. 
The Le Meridien Barcelona is definitely a place to consider & I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be where the activities are but at the same time have a peaceful sanctuary once you enter those revolving doors. ",5,2019,10,29
37,Excellent price/quality ratio,"Very friendly and professional reception staff. We stayed in a nice, clean room on the first floor : enough floor space, good bed, huge shower in a huge bathroom, ... 
Le Meridien is excellently located on The Ramblas. We enjoyed a very good dinner And breakfast in Restaurant 111.",4,2019,10,29
37,Great Location and Staff!,"We stayed here for three days before departing from Barcelona on a Mediterranean cruise. The location was perfect for walkers like us. La Rambla is just outside the door, as are bust stops and a metro station. It was a great launching point for our trips around the city. When it came time to depart on the cruise, we opted to take a short cab to the port. Throughout our stay, virtually all of the staff members we encountered were polite, cheerful and always helpful. If there's a drawback it would be the decor. For the price point, the hotel could use a refreshing.",5,2019,10,27
37,Not bad,"First time at this hotel.
Location is excellent, very convenient.
Rooms are OK, and service was good throughout.
Gym is decent, quite small, might be problematic if more than 2 people are using the equipment at the same time.
Breakfast was good, but chaotic, waited to be seated both days as tables needed to be cleared.
Overall, quite good but not excellent.
",4,2019,10,27
37,Great location but not much else..,"Firstly, location is great. Very happening area and convenient. Room is ok.

We had a baby and wanted to use the minibar/fridge but it's crap. Its loaded with stuff and if you remove it there are sensors that will charge you. It doesn't even get cold. 

Also if you put the do not disturb/privacy sign up to skip housekeeping, you can expect them to call you at about 9pm on the phone to see if you need anything. So if you or your baby are sleeping, too bad!!

Toiletries such as shampoo, etc are dismal. You can ask for more but I'd expect to be given it without having to ask.

I thought this was a 5 star hotel but it definately isn't. I would say 5 star location, 3 star hotel.

I would not recommend staying here. It's very expensive and for that price you can perhaps stay a bit further away from La Rambla and cab everywhere.

",3,2019,10,24
37,Great Location BUT,Entrance is just off the Rambla but rooms are quite small.  Breakfast buffet just okay and breakfast area ambience is poor.  If location is all you care about then stay here.  There are many better hotels that are close to the Rambla and with better overall facilities.,3,2019,10,24
37,Excelent hotel with the perfect location,"We were in Barcelona on a family trip, and reserved two rooms. Rooms were really nice. Breakfast was great, and the location is wonderful. It is located right in the Ramblas, within walking distance of most of what Barcelona has to offer. 

Staff was always helpful and very kind.",5,2019,10,23
37,Amazing! 5 star experience!,"We stayed for a week and had the most wonderful experience! From our initial check in being served a glass of champagne to our beautiful room and amazing breakfast every morning, our visit could not have gone better. The staff went out of their way to help us and the concierge staff gave us maps and great suggestions for places to visit. The location was the best part- walking out of the hotel onto La Rambla and exploring Barcelona on foot made us want to return some day - thank you to all the staff at Le Meridian for making our vacation exceed all our expectations. ",5,2019,10,19
37,Magical,"The most wonderful food and service from Javier and our lovely hostess, such friendly staff and the best desert I have had in Barcelona. It was an absolutely magical experience. Can’t wait to come back already! Xx",5,2019,10,16
37,Amazing location for 1st time in Barcelona,"we were very lucky to go on our points to that hotel so i'm not gonna talk about prices. but the location is fantastic, so many places to walk to easily; lots of shopping & restaurants & you have to experience La Rambla! (could be a bit noisy at night if your room is on that side....!)
lots of Americans so don't worry they do speak English...
very generous buffet breakfast
friendly staff",4,2019,10,16
37,Great location...hotel less than average,"Took my family on a Trip to Spain. Overall, excellent time. Arrived in Barcelona and stayed at ale Méridien. Outstanding location. Walking distance to many areas of interest including Mercado de Boqueria. However, hotel was crowded. Staff was not very well prepared. Too much smoke in the lobby. Check in process was slow! Would have rated a 1...but location was ideal!",2,2019,10,12
37,5 Star on the Ramblas,"Our hotel in Barcelona did not disappoint.  The building itself was wonderful, the rooms spacious and comfortable with every possible amenity.  The concierge(s) never steered us wrong and everyone was most helpful.",5,2019,10,12
37,Great place to stay,"Very helpful staff. They are very knowledgeable, speak English and ensure you are taken care of. Room service is prompt, reasonably priced and very good. Rooms are nice with a relaxing spa shower. Short walk (1block) to the main square. And many activities. Be cautious of thieves. This was a glorified shopping trip with over half (7 hours!) spent in a speeding bus.  1st and second stops were good then at the main stop, they drop you off and say”shop, you have an hour” Nothing at all special about the shops. All big retail. Also they are not sensitive to personal needs. Very little access to bathrooms including one 2 hour stretch on the bus just after lunch. If you have any physical issues, do not take this particular trip!  Scenery is beautiful. More photo stop would have been nice. Just not worth the money. Purses should not just hang off your shoulder when you’re on the street use a cross body and back packs should be worn on the front. Taxis are excellent and trust worthy and right outside the door",5,2019,10,12
37,Most helpful.,"Hotel is in excellent location, walking distance to many features. The concierge was so very helpful. Offered excellent restaurant suggestions. Even wrote addresses for me to give to cab driver. Excellent service!!",5,2019,10,12
37,Great location,"We stayed here for 6 nights. The location is excellent, the staff polite and attentive, and the hotel very basic Marriott. The room was small and could use an update. It clearly caters to Americans and tour groups heading to, or returning from cruises. The primary language spoken is English, so if you are looking for a “Spanish experience” this hotel is not for you. It’s right in the heart of the tourist district and it’s very easy to get around the city. ",4,2019,10,11
37,Personalized experience!,"This is a terrific hotel - great location, attentive to every need.  I received a pre-arrival note from the property asking if there was anything they could in anticipation of our visit. They graciously took care of every detail...see you next we're in Barcelona!",5,2019,10,11
37,Very Good Hotel,Le Meridian is a very nice hotel. We arrived around 1pm and our room was ready for us. Which was great after getting off a cruise and doing a 4 hour tour. Service was great. Our room was lovely.  But we did have two complaints. 1. The bathroom was beautiful and large but the tub and shower unit was dangerous. The tub was extra tall plus very slippery with no mat for getting in and out. We stayed two nights and I did not dare to attempt to get in the tub on our last morning afraid I might hurt myself before flying home. 2. Our room was on the front so it was very noisy through out the night with delivery trucks and street noise of people partying. Other than those two points everything was great. I would recommend it but ask for a walk in shower unit only.,4,2019,10,09
37,Lovely hotel,"Located in the heart of Barcelona, so easy to get to everywhere. The breakfast is so delicious. The rooms are very clean and the staff is very friendly and very helpful. The hotel is located right outside La Rambla.",5,2019,10,09
37,TopNotch hotel with great Customer Service,"I stayed there for 6 nights, playing tourist, while my partner attended a meeting.  The hotel deserves its five stars: great breakfast buffet (I already miss the capuccinos!), spotless rooms, perfect location on La Rambla, and great customer service.  A special SHOUT OUT to the concierges who couldn't have been more helpful and guided us to excellent restaurants: Maria, Ricardo, and Diego.  I do have two minor critiques.  1) I appreciate the hotel's green initiatives, but I didn't notice some of the cards/pamphlets until almost ready to leave. I recommend that the hotel summarize everything in one easy-to-read card and have the clerk at check-in hand the card to each person with a short explanation.  2) The water in the 6th-floor jacuzzi was tepid, almost cold!!  Can't you increase the temperature? Or allow users to adjust it? :)",5,2019,10,03
37,Dangerous location & rude staff,"Did the common definition of the words “upgrade” or “benefit” change when I wasn’t looking?  Because I was just informed by Le Meriden, that Marriott Gold Elite members “upgrades” are just better rooms within the SAME category we book!  What?  How is THAT an upgrade or a benefit?  

I was an SPG platinum for the most part of 10 yrs, but after merger w/ Marriott, I’m only Gold (but Gold 5 different ways,
including “Gold for Life”). But because I’m still loyal, I chose to book a room at Le Meriden Barcelona! I had also stayed there 10 yrs ago & it was great (back then).  Not so much now.  This time Las Ramblas felt dangerous & was so crowded. Tourists get bombarded to buy things (cheap plastic souvenir type things).  It’s like an assault. 

I arrived early (around 11:30am) because I was coming from a cruise ship (that another story).  Lines were long & there was no designated “elite check in” person.  

I asked for an upgrade, but front desk Mgr said hotel was sold out due to a convention. she WAS able to get me checked in soon though. I had breakfast while waiting which cost 27 euros & was a very basic buffet. It was closing ASAP, so mostly everything was gone, including the omelet station.

My delux room 536 was ok.  King bed. Decent bath, ok amenities & towels.  In room instant coffee maker. Windows only open a crack. beds comfy but no plugs bedside bed for cell phone.  
FYI floors 6,7,8 & 9 are suites & grand terrace suites & corner suites have balconies. 

Some rooms had renovations, (but not 536).  My view just another building very close.  the room doesn’t get much sunlight as the result.  

I got the super fast Internet based on my status, or it would’ve cost 30 euros! 

Later that evening, I noticed online that the hotel actually wasn’t sold out. It showed availability on premium rooms & suites still. I expressed my disappointment to the manager on duty & he apologized that I wasn’t even given the option to have a decent view in the same category of room.  He showed me the “las Ramblas view deluxe” room & offered to move me, but it was late & I had already unpacked. He said if I extend tomorrow I could move to it & he also sweetly offered to send up Chocolates & fruit, which was a very nice offer.... I was impressed..: Except it never arrived. ☹️ 

The following morning, when deciding whether to stay another night or move to Cotton House, I called the front desk to see which room they’d move me to if I extended.  I spoke with Frederica & when I got her up to speed, SHE informed me that  “Marriott Gold members’ upgrade benefits” are only allowed to be a better room within the SAME CATEGORY booked (if available).  she also said I was ALREADY in an “enhanced deluxe room” because it had an “outside view”(See photo), so I would not be offered a better  room as promised the night before: THEN she proceeded to inform me that I couldn’t have been offered a “Las Ramblas deluxe room” the day prior, because the hotel was sold
out.  Except I already KNOW they weren’t sold out and I also KNOW they offered me the option to change to the other room!  2 more lies! 
Said she’d talk to her supervisor & call me back w/ options.  
reservations manager Rodrigo said MANY times, he could NOT offer me a suite since I was ONLY Gold- even there were MANY suites available & it was already 3pm, regardless of the hectic ordeal, or that I had been lied to 3x, wasted hours of my time & never even got my fruit!  He insisted on showing me a newly renovated “premium” room that was 2 floors below me, right under mine.  It was the same exact size & non-view, but it was just noisier, darker, w/ a new bedspread & wallpaper & therefore considered “premium”.  By this time, I just wanted to “GET OUT OF THERE!”  I went to their sister property down the street which was AMAZING (& a higher category & less expensive too!) 

Rodrigo offered no apology for the run around, wasting my time, & he & Frederico’s arrogant attitudes.  Clearly they don’t care about their guests & I’ll never stay there again, (and I suggest you don’t either).",2,2019,10,02
37,Marvelous Stay,"The hotel is in a great location. The staff when above and beyond in helping.
The room we had was very modern and up to date. I want a special Thank-You
to Concierge Ricardo Suarez who was extremely helpful.",5,2019,09,30
37,Location!!,"Have been to Barcelona 10 or so times and the first time I ever stayed on Las Ramblas - and it made a big difference to be in the middle of everything.

Pros:
- had USB ports next to the bed
- quiet room - even though we faced Las Ramblas, with the window closed, we didn't hear any street noise (although I wish the window opened fully instead of just a few centimeters)
- comfortable bed 
- nice, updated bathroom with good lighting
- good breakfast buffet with made to order eggs
- sounds silly but nice doors to the rooms that self shut - didn't slam so you didn't hear other doors slamming 

Cons:
- deep bathtub that you needed to step in and out of - why not a walk in shower instead?   At least there was a grab bar to assist with getting in and out.
- front desk always seemed understaffed - always a line to talk to someone",4,2019,09,29
37,Wonderful Location,Our pre cruise stay at Le Méridien was perfect!!!  We could walk the Rambla or easily get cab service from this location. The room was comfortable and the staff accommodating and helpful.  Breakfast buffet was more than adequate!,5,2019,09,27
37,very nice,"Wonderful location, very friendly and helpful staff, and very nice property. room was clean, large and quiet, even though it overlooked Las Ramblas.  plenty of shopping and food options in the area. Easy for use to get to port for cruise by taxi.",5,2019,09,25
37,Mr,When we arrived we were upgraded to a nicer room as it was our anniversary. Staff was great and the concierge’s gave us lots of ideas for dinner on the different days we were there. They also gave us tips on going to mass at family at church. Great location highly recommend,5,2019,09,23
37,Beautiful central hotel,"Very nice hotel at the city center. Everything is very close, within walking distance. Very kind and attentive staff at the reception. I would recommend it as a city hotel vwith the essential amenities.",5,2019,09,23
37,Great location ...,"My husband and I stayed here fir just one night in September.  We loved it. The location was fantastic ... so close to many attractions and restaurants. 

The staff was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and nicely appointed. Recommend this! ",5,2019,09,22
37,"Great hotel, central location","There's so much good to say about this hotel - service, location, and amenities.  The excellent service started right with check-in.  I missed the complimentary cava, but received a voucher for a drink at my own convenience in the bar from Bruno, who was extraordinary helpful in getting me checked in and connected to my travel companions.  Once I was checked in and settled to the room, the hotel felt like it was in the center of everything.  The hotel bar-restaurant immediately overlooks la rambla, which is convenient; and it was easy to get into the winding streets of the raval behind us or the gothic quarter in front of us.  Even short meanders from the hotel resulted in the cutest local sights, and all the central attractions of old Barcelona, including the marina and shopping.  The property itself was very modern and efficient - I think it had just undergone a renovation.  There was plenty of plugs, lots of space and light, and a well designed comfortable bathroom.  This will be my go-to place in Barcelona!",5,2019,09,21
37,Nice with Outstanding Breakfast,"Service pretty good.  Champagne offered upon check in.  The room was adequate but furnishings could use some touch up - some nicks and dents.  The shower was large with a nice rain shower.  There is a small coffee shop in the lobby selling coffee, pastries, ice cream, etc.  The buffet breakfast was very good.  The hotel is very close to La Rambla which gets very crowded with tourists.  Though not really close, we were able to walk to La Sagrada familia (but beware, a bird pooped on us!)",4,2019,09,21
37,Phenomenal stay!,"We are titanium SPG (yes I can't let go) and this was our first stay here after numerous visits to Barcelona, a city we love!

The service was top-notch and everyone was attentive to Sasitorn who checked us in to  room 328 which was recently renovated room.  Due to an issue (which was resolved) we were upgraded to room 906 (suite) with beautiful view.",5,2019,09,16
37,A Perfect Stay,"This was our first experience at a Le Meridien and we were not disappointed.  I felt it combined old-world charm with all the modern conveniences one hopes to find.  The hotel was in an ideal location, steps from the Gothic Quarter and all its charming shops and restaurants.  

We also found the service at this hotel to be outstanding.  Every single associate with whom we had contact was friendly, welcoming and willing to assist.  Truly, each of them was exceptional.",5,2019,09,15
37,Poor food,"Came in on reviews and pictures off the internet to be so disappointed by the food.....
However front of house staff very good but so let down bye unseasoned food I had the BBQ pulled pork that was not BBQ and wife had beef spare ribs that had no seasoning at all??!! ",2,2019,09,10
37,Fun in Barcelona,The hotel was set perfectly in the city center. The entire facility was pleasant.  The only downside was the rooms were not cold enough so I needed to get a fan. Housekeeping brought the fan up immediately it was a great stay.  Definitely would recommend this place to couples or solo travelers.  Not a place for kids.,4,2019,09,10
37,Best Honeymoon Hotel Stay,"For our honeymoon we traveled to madrid, athens, satorini, mykonos and barcelona. From all the different luxury hotels we stayed in the other locations, this hotel was the best! the view from the room was incredible, the staff was very friendly, location was perfect and close to all the tourist attraction and the hotel gave us a bottle of champagne and appetizers to celebrate our honeymoon.",5,2019,09,03
37,Excellent Service,"I had stayed in this hotel before and it is centrally located with easy access to everything , shops , supermarket , restaurants as well as 7 minutes walk from airport buses station . Very convenient .
The staffs are exceptionally friendly , attentive , and fast responses to your needs as well as courteous and very professional. My commendations to all of them specially to Bruno who did my check in . 
As a frequent traveller I highly recommend this Hotel. The recognition to Elite Marriott members is exceptional .
Again I would like to extend my gratitude to  everyone at the Le Meridien Barcelona for providing me and my family a very pleasant and memorable stay . You guys were all just fabulous .  BRAVO ",5,2019,08,31
37,"Location = Great, Service = Great, Hotel = Great","Barcelona is an amazing city, and there’s so much to see. That’s why It’s critical that you pick a base that is central. Le Meridien Barcelona is exactly that.

The hotel is a large property, with spacious and modern rooms. It’s a very busy property due to its enviable location, yet there are no delays in service.

As we visited in the height of the European Summer Holidays so you could expect that the hotel would be busy, and this it was. At no time did any of the public areas feel too small to accommodate a full hotel, so as far as space goes, for a City hotel this property has plenty of that.

I would have to nit pick to find something negative to say about the Le Meridien Barcelona, so there really is nothing on the negative side to report.

On the positive side, service is great, the included breakfast is great, and the property itself is modern and well kept. 

Stepping outside of the hotel places you in the middle of the action, with Plaza de Catalunya less than a few minutes’ walk away. Plenty of shopping in that area. The Gothic Quarter is just as close, and so is the Fresh food market. Loads of bars to enjoy the afternoons. The main beach is probably a EUR 10 cab ride away (approx. 4.5km to the Casino area), but we did walk it more than once, and it’s so flat it’s no issue. 

If it’s within budget, stay here. It’s a lovely hotel that offers you everything you need.",5,2019,08,30
37,Phenomenal hotel stay!,"Great spot to see everything. Staff is exceptional! If you are an elite member I would strongly suggest the breakfast, not the points.  And get to the corner table for great people watching. 5 min walk to the train and right in the middle of La rambles. ",5,2019,08,29
37,Central Location,"Just steps off Las Ramblas which was convenient for restaurants and walking around the city 
Clean rooms and very efficient front desk  We arrived early  in the morning after a cruise and one of our 3 rooms was available to store our luggage which was helpful
They do not provide breakfast",4,2019,08,22
37,Elegant stay at the heart of La Ramblas,"Le Meridien is situated just off La Ramblas, which gives convenient access to many tourist spots such as Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, Palau de Musica and Palau Guell, all within walking distance.  
There is a supermarket adjacent to the hotel which spans over 2 levels, appropriate for picking up local produce or last-minute shopping of iberico ham and chorizos.  
If you sign up for Marriot Bonvoy (it's free), they offer you great perks and we were lucky enough to join a special culinary event that is only held once a month or so.  This offered us a chance to understand how to make paella with a chef's demonstration, while we enjoyed a buffet of starters and paellas, with cava and sangria, a heavenly treat to start our stay in Barcelona thanks to Ana who was a gem in arranging this for us.  The hotel also organizes other events such as movie night in their own amphitheater, which i would have been inclined to join if I didn't have other plans.  
The hotel staff are very passionate and friendly, with special mention to Ali Haider and Mona Z, who always make us feel at home when we see their pleasant faces as we return to the hotel.  I also love getting a cup of self-served fruit infused water in the lobby.  
The Premium Deluxe room was cozy with touches of art decor, we requested for a room that faced the inner street (but on the corner of the hotel) so we wouldn't catch the noise on La Ramblas and it was perfect.  There were some wear and tear for the bathtub and shower area, and the amenities were not always refilled but it didn't affect the entire experience too much.  
Recommend to try their breakfast buffet which has a great variety of food, and you can have churros for breakfast! It was also useful to have a small gym and business facilities in the basement. where people can use the computer and print off visit tickets.  
A very pleasant and safe stay, will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,22
37,Great Hotel but........,"First off this is a great Hotel.  Rooms were fine, breakfast great, stall helpful.  My only warning is location. It is right on a very busy, noisy street.  Gets very crowded during the day and at night.  Maybe I am getting a little old, but it was not fun fighting to get down street.",4,2019,08,21
37,Good and not so good,"The good: location, friendly and helpful staff. The room we were in had been redone, typical hotel decor. Breakfast buffet had limited choices, but the omelet station was very good.
Not so good:  because of the location, the rooms can be noisy, especially on a lower floor.
the bathroom. The tub has very high sides and anyone with any mobility issues will have significant issues getting in or out.
No place to hang the hand towels - very strange!
Finally, a pet peeve - no night light in the bathroom.

",3,2019,08,20
37,2 night stay while in Spain,"We stayed here because we are Marriott Bonvoy members. The hotel is super clean! The front desk staff, cleaning, and service personal are all very friendly/professional, some of the best I have seen with Marriott! The beds are comfy. The reason for 4 stars VS 5 stars is simply for the fact that the WiFi is dreadful inside the rooms. Every time I needed to work on something it required me to go down to the lobby to get a reliable connect! the WiFi is better on the actual bus of the hop on hop off tour in the city then in the rooms of the hotel! 

The breakfast was outstanding from room service! Room service is very prompt when you set a time. 

The lobby & coffee bar are very stylish and clean. (Picture is attached of the lobby area...this has been my nightly late night office)

",4,2019,08,17
37,The whole package,"This hotel was really great. Awesome spot in a great location off Barcelona on La Rambla. The staff were so accommodating and helpful in every aspect. They really made us feel very welcome. Rooms were nice and more spacious than expected for a European city center hotel. The daily breakfast is very good with a fresh egg/omlette chef. The little workout gym in the basement meets its needs quite well. Business center was useful for printing our boarding passes. Would have been nice if there was a pool, but quite understandable given their location.",5,2019,08,17
37,Bit of a mixed bag ...,"The good: Rooms have been recently refreshed / modernized and beds are comfy. Bathrooms have not been redone as recently but appear to be next as there was a survey card in the room asking about preferences for a future upgrade. That said, I didn’t even think the bathroom needed any change ~ excellent shower, great bath products and good space. Staff is friendly and helpful. Location is very good for exploring as long as you don’t mind some noise from La Rambla. Thumbs up for Marriott elite rooftop cocktail party, which included a very original / cute theme and involved a summer hat-making activity. 

Not so good: Internet rarely functional ~ two of our five days, it did not work at all. This resulted in us incurring extensive wireless charges for extra use on phones and tablets. No elite lounge or on-site “store” to pick up quick snacks (though there are many nearby options). In-room fridge was hot and never restocked (including being half-empty when we arrived). Laundry service prices far too high for this level of property. Front desk, while friendly and helpful, was often understaffed.",3,2019,08,16
37,"Great location, stylish rooms, and helpful service","We had a great time at this hotel. The location is right on Las Ramblas not too far from the Boqueria market. Our room was stylish and comfortable. The AC was much appreciated, as it was very hot outside during our stay. Lastly, the bartender in the hotel bar makes fantastic drinks!",5,2019,08,14
37,"Awesome Stay, Great Location - Walk Everywhere","This hotel is charming and in a perfect location beside La Rambla which has a ton of stuff going on all the time. We upgraded to a suite and really enjoyed the view, the hotel and staff. The rooms were comfortable. The best part is you could walk everywhere. When traveling; Location, Location, Location!",5,2019,08,13
37,Great location!,"Four of us stayed here before our 12-day Mediterranean cruise.  Loved the location. Shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance.  The rooms are small as is the case anywhere in Europe.  The glass bathroom walls are puzzling.  What were they thinking?  Staff was amazing, very accommodating.  Eduardo was especially helpful and secured reservations for us at two wonderful restaurants.",5,2019,08,11
37,Price for location.,"This hotel has a great location. It is half a block from La Rambla which is crowded with tourist from early morning to late night. Also close is the Ghotic Quarter and El Mercado de la Boqueria. 
We stayed for two nights precruiseship. Staff is nice, check in was fast. The rooms shows thayt you pay for location. Small room, modern decor with an awful bathroom. I dont understand the use of glass as walls. First it gives you no privacy even there are not trough see you still feel there is no privacy but being with my wife that is not the issue. It is waking up the other person at night while using the bathroom. ",4,2019,08,10
37,A successful overnight stay,"We arrived from the US before noon.  Room was ready, fortunately.  Great location on La Rambla.  Like all European city hotels, we room was small for the price.  But it was very clean and well equipped.  Staff was very friendly.  And the taxi stand always had a few cabs, even in the middle of the night.",4,2019,08,10
37,Wonderful Guest Service,"My 2 girl friends and I stopped by this beautiful property to see if, by some miracle, we could get a reservation/massage at their rooftop spa within the hour. Although we were not staying at this property, we were greeted by the doorman, helped with our bags, AND even greeted with a glass of champagne! Eduardo at the front desk went above and beyond by helping us make last minute arrangements with the spa. He also gave us great sightseeing/restaurant recommendations for the remainder of our time in Barcelona. We all 3 were fit in last minute and had a world class massage. Thank you Le Meridien!",5,2019,08,06
37,trini 868,"I  highly recommend this hotel. The location is great on La Rambla  and with good  restaurants just across the street . We were a  family of 4 with connecting rooms so had amply space. The rooms were modern , clean and spacious. The front desk staff were very pleasant . I would recommend the morning buffet breakfast a  good start to the day. the only minor issue is low floor can get the noise from La Rambla as there is activity late in the night. A 5 star hotel.",5,2019,08,05
37,Barcelona’s Best,"Husband and I had a wonderful 4-night stay in this hotel, ideally situated half a block off La Rambla, but so quiet at night.  For a special occasion, we used points and cash to spring for a Grand Terrace Suite, no 625.  These 6 GTS’s on the 6th floor are the only ones (except one junior suite) that have outside space.  The terrace befits its name:  it is grand, with loungers, couch and tables, and dining table and two chairs.  I believe other GTS are slightly differently furnished; some have umbrellas and dining tables to seat 4 for a family.  It also has an outdoor shower and ample beach towels and cushions.    

The room itself is tastefully decorated (if a bit dated), spacious and comfortable, with lots of seating options and a huge coffee table, other shelves, drawers, and ledges to accommodate all your stuff.  Really comfortable bed and bedding.  

  Big walk-in closet, nicely equipped bar, with an assortment of glassware, and coffees, teas, and even a kettle which we really appreciated.  If you need space for your own beverages, note that the bar fridge is one that automatically charges your account if an item is moved in any way.  We asked them to clear out the fridge for us, and that was done promptly and cheerfully.  It also has a umbrella, robes and slippers, hair dryer AND hair straightener, and the most luxurious toiletries.  The spacious bathroom features double sinks, toilet and shower area separated by a glass door, and a huge soaker tub. The towel rack is heated, as are the tile floors.  

No 625 is the farthest from the elevator and right beside the spa, with hydrotherapy pool, saunas, and deck seating. 

The only improvements I would make are:  add an ice machine on one of the floors.  Housekeeping was more than happy to bring ice, but because we would have to ask for it, we just never did.  Second, there are TV stations in a variety of languages reflecting the diversity of Barcelona’s visitors.  However, the channels in English were exclusively news.  It was disappointing not to be able to watch a movie or show the day I spent sick in bed or when we were wiped from a day of sightseeing and just wanted to unwind with TV.  Given English’s more universal use, a couple channels devoted to shows and movies would be welcome.  

Another feature of the GTS is a complimentary pass into the Palau Güell (Güell Palace), just 10 minutes walk south on La Rambla.  Don't mistake this for a throw-away; it is one of Gaudi’s earliest constructions and is simply breathtaking.  And very few tourists were there or seem to know about it.  A visit is recommended while that lasts.

There’s also a good bike rental place - Barcelona Rent-A-Bike, 5 minutes walk away.  (Reviewed separately).  

Without exception, the staff were wonderful.  The hostesses in the restaurant and all the servers were pleasant, prompt, and even went off-menu for us at dinner - very service-oriented.  The breakfast buffet was perfect.  They will gladly bring you cappuccino on request, and spring into action to help if you look puzzled.  

Our receptionist, Tonka, was lovely to deal with (she got us into our room at 10am), the Concierge (didn’t catch his name) gave us ideal restaurant suggestions, the woman who cleared our fridge was all smiles, bright and energetic, and kudos to Eduardo, who didn't hesitate to leave the front desk to walk outside with us to show us exactly how to get to the postbox.  Gracias, Eduardo.  

The biggest shout out goes to Reservation Manager, Amaia, who truly went above and beyond to get us into the suite we wanted, and was such a pleasure throughout, dealing with my many emails.  Multas gracias, Amaia.

This hotel and the Grand Terrace Suite was worth every euro and our Bonvoy platinum status was constantly acknowledged and rewarded by staff.  We always welcomed the escape from the Ramblas craziness to our soothing and spacious room.  We will return.",5,2019,08,04
37,Best location and best service,"This is my vacation to Barcelona with my family.
This time they arranged a family suite for me. Thank you again for their arrangement.
The hotel has the best geographical location and walking distance everywhere. I think you must be the best choice to go to Barcelona.
Estas son mis vacaciones en Barcelona con mi familia.
Esta vez me han asignado una suite familiar.Gracias de nuevo por su organización.
Mis puntuaciones para este hotel sonCreo que túdebes ser la mejor opción para ir a Barcelona.",5,2019,08,02
37,Best Convenience ,"We stayed here for two nights 7/30-8/1/19. 
Achillo was our front desk specialist , who was not only eager to help but proactively catering to our accommodation needs . We had an hour wait before we checked into the room since we requested for an upgrade ($ extra, but worth it). In the meantime, Achillo marked all areas of interest on the map and guided us on what kind of tours/audio tours to book. 
Thanks to Le Meridian for giving free entry and tours to the guests at one of the Gaudi’s homes. 
The hotel is right in the heart of Las Ramblas , walking distance to shopping and dining and to the Gothic Quarters/Barcelona Cathedral. Park Guelle and La Sagrada are 10-12 min taxi ride . Metro station Catalunya is a min walk from the hotel.
We checked into a renovated room on 3rd floor with Las Ramblas view . Renovated and immaculate, had all the essentials needed for a comfortable stay . Housekeeping is slow , but overall polite and customer friendly.
Fitness Center in the basement was very tidy .  Check out was a breeze . Another plus point was taxis available 24/7 outside the hotel.
Will stay here again during our next Barcelona visit .",5,2019,08,01
37,great location and service,"Le Meridien is perfectly located within the walking distance of Old town.Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of cava. Overall staff is very helpful, professional. Five stars for the service/ staff responsiveness.Everybody- from the check in desk, bell hop, concierge, housekeeping are always ready to help.We felt treated like a royalty.
Had family suite. Rooms are good.As in most of hotels- could do with more conveniently located electric outlets. Bedsides tables could be slightly bigger.
Bathroom is very spacious. Occasionally bad smell would suddenly emanate from the bathroom- could be the Barcelona water. For a Family suite bathroom could use more shelves.Nightlight also would be nice.
For some reason- intentional joke or unintentional mistake- bathroom had a one-way window towards the second room- the only problem - you could not see into the room from the bathroom, but could see into the bathroom from the room.

Overall- nice hotel, amazing staff. Will definitely stay again.",4,2019,08,01
37,Adam Stefanile:Barcelona,The Hotel is perfectly situated on one of the main drives in Barcelona. Everything you expect from a five-star hotel you will definitely receive here. The staff is readily available for any matter that you need assistance with.,5,2019,07,29
37,"Perfect Location, Renovated Rooms","Great location, clean hotel, renovated room and very helpful staff. Special thank you to Diego, the concierge, who spent time helping us plan our meals and itinerary- never felt rushed and very knowledgeable.",5,2019,07,27
37,"Convenient location, some rooms with no views","We checked in a little bit earlier and when we went into our premium deluxe room and opened the curtains, we are shock that there is a wooden wall about one to two feet in front of the window, that means there is no view. This is the fourth time we stayed at this hotel and the room shouldn’t be like this, we immediately returned the room to the front desk and waited for another room with the street view, finally we got one after waiting for 2 hours. The room is nice, renovated 1 year before, housekeeping is good and quick. We requested the items, drinks and checkout using BonVoy app, very useful. The reception area is full of baggages this time and the concierge is quite lazy to help.",4,2019,07,25
37,Customer service flop ,"My husband is a titanium elite Marriott rewards member and we have been spoiled with superb customer service from Marriott. During our recent trip to Spain, we stayed in 4 different high end Marriott hotels in Madrid, Seville and Barcelona. The hotels in Madrid and Seville  had great customer service and treatment you would expect from luxury hotels. Our final hotel stay was at Le Meridian in Barcelona - the most expensive hotel we booked at $525/night so our expectations were high!! Altho the hotel has some nice features, they really dropped the ball with customer service. 
To begin with, I called the hotel the day prior to our arrival to confirm they had my husband’s Marriott number on the reservation since we had used a travel agency for booking. I also confirmed with them we would arrive by 2 pm so our room would be ready as normal check in is at 3 pm.  In all of our other hotels in Spain, we had arrived as easily as 10 am and were allowed  to check in and have a room due to my husband’s Marriott status.  When we arrived at le Méridien and checked in, we were told our room -a suite we had booked-would not be ready until 6 pm bc the person occupying our room had requested a late check out at 4 pm.  We told the check in lady this was unacceptable, and she said she could give us a small temporary room to use until then. We said that we wanted to get in our room and unpack and relax and not have to move rooms.  She said there was nothing she could do. She also said we had to pay $ 80 euros more a night for the 3rd person in our room as well as $14 euros for the 3rd person breakfast. We argued that we had booked and prepaid for a 3 person room and we did not owe more money.  She said there was nothing she could do and that’s how it was. So we asked to speak to a manager and she begrudgingly went and found one. Manager was better. He said he would expedite us getting into a suite room which ended up being ready by 3:45 pm instead of 6 pm . We used the temporary room for a couple hours and they transferred our luggage for us. He also said he would call the travel agency that booked our prepaid suite and work out the payment with them, and he offered to comp the 3rd person breakfast for free. So all in all , he fixed the situation but at that high price point, it is unpleasant to have to argue and demand in order to receive what you paid for.  Also missing from this hotel was door service greeters who always took our luggage right at the front door in our other hotels and delivered bags to our room. We lugged our own bags to the temporary room .And this hotel had no evening tidy and turn down service like we had received at the other hotels. Sometimes it’s the little things that make it feel special and this place just missed the mark.  Our suite room had a nice balcony city view. Bathroom lighting was very dim with only one outlet so my daughter and I had difficulty getting ready together at the same time.  

I still don’t understand the late check in issue they had. They said a late check out request for Marriott members takes priority over normal check in time.  That makes no sense to me.  If I pay for a room and normal check in time is at 3 pm, then essentially I am paying for someone else to use my room for a late check out if the hotel is  full and they have no availability which is what they told us.  In our extensive previous experience , late check outs are only honored if there is availability.  I had called and told the hotel we would arrive at 2 pm so they should not have allowed the late check out for the other party. I also find it interesting that the manager was able to move some things around in order to get us a suite room available much sooner than the 6 pm time the original lady had said.  

So the first impression of this hotel was quite negative and put us in a bad mood which is unfortunate especially considering the very high end luxury hotel price. ",2,2019,07,19
37,Great hotel and location in Barcelona,This Le Meridien is located right off Las Ramblas and in walking distance to central neighborhoods in Barcelona.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and comfortable.  If I was visiting central Barcelona I would stay there again.  ,5,2019,07,13
37,"Great Service (Doormen, Front Desk, Concierges, Breakfast Staff)","This is a Marriott property. Great customer service from the minute you walk in the door! Nice rooms with plenty of space (jr. suite), nice water pressure, great location (beware street noise... you are literally right above a very busy thoroughfare (pedestrians and vehicles). Breakfast staff very nice and welcoming. Food is good and plentiful. Very clean. Rooms are also very clean.",5,2019,07,12
37,Vacation concierge awesome!,Couldn’t get tickets to Sagrada Familia but concierge helped me get tickets to there and Guell Park!  Different tickets available which he was able to help me figure out availablity. Room spacious. Great service. Dropped sunglasses case and attendant brought to me. Hotel on las Ramblas. Great location and gave us tickets to Palau Guell. Fruit and water with room!,5,2019,07,10
37,Underwhelming property with Le Meridean name,"This hotel is closer to 3 stars than it is to 4. To call it a category 6 resort I would say is a stretch as it’s missing the comforts that make hotels stand out. First, Las Ramblas is a very touristy area that’s at least 20 minutes to everything but not conveniently close to anything. Personally we would have preferred staying in an area that is more classic Barcelona rather than a tourist area that attracts a hostel crowd. As for the hotel itself, it’s a budget hotel with a Le Meridean name and not so budget prices. I would compare it more to a courtyard Marriott. In our little time at the hotel we were woken up by screaming neighbours at all hours of the night because the walls are so thin. When we raised concerns to the staff they said they were not able to help us. For +450 USD a night I expect better customer service and thicker walls. We wouldn’t stay there again and we’d recommend finding another Marriott property like Hotel Les Arts or an AirBNB. ",3,2019,07,08
37,"Good location, adequate room, friendly staff","Arrived after long flight from the US, tired, late for a meeting. Desk staff cheery - offered something cold, bubbly, with alcohol while checking in.  Nice touch. The room was airy, quiet, great bedding.  The hotel is nice in a so-so way.  I really enjoyed the breakfasts - made to order omelettes, wonderful pastries, delicious juice, very tasty coffees.
If you want the hustle of Las Ramblas, it's here. I do like the location. It's an invigorating 45 minute walk to Sagrada Familia - perhaps the most awe inspiring architecture in the world! If you are in Catalonia and miss this, you're nuts.",3,2019,07,08
37,"Painfully Average BUT Location, Location, Location","My wife and I were in Barcelona to drop off our daughter for a summer semester abroad

This property is centrally located in Barcelona which is clearly its best asset.  Second best is the friendliness of the staff.   They could not be nicer. 
We used points for six nights and although I requested an upgrade using Marriotts Suite Night Award it was not available.  We asked for a complimentary upgrade prior to seeing and we were denied. When we arrived they did give me a somewhat of a suite 5 of the 6 nights.  We were moved after our first night. Thank you Alix.  

Check in was fine and our room was in the back which was great- quiet and ready at 3 PM. They did charge me extra for my daughter - three nights when she only stayed two.  I was refunded the third night.  

Room(s) were clean and comfortable but they and the bathrooms are very dated.  Shower was a bit moldy and I asked several times for it to be cleaned but this never really was cleaned properly.  

According to the video available on the TV the hotel
was renovated in 2005.  Hmmm not a plus, maybe they should remove the video?

All public areas have been somewhat updated but honestly not up to Marriott standards.  Last year I stayed in a Marriott property 175 night so I know Marriott standards. 

The bar Le Pop was also breakfast which is a home run for breakfast ( totally full American breakfast) but honestly La Boqueria is a five minute walk and with the five euros for two two Cortados and cinnamon bun, it’s out of this world.  After all it’s Europe so eat like a European. 

The bartender Diego at Le Pop is off the chart on drinks. Amazing presentation, care and simply beautiful to watch make a passion fruit martini.  Give that man a raise cause he killed it night after night.  

Some issues- 
Our room backed up against the bathroom of the adjoining suite so at 7 AM I could hear the man next door taking care of business.  Uuugh

The fire alarm “ All guests need to vacate the premise immediately” in the middle of the night was unfortunate.  Safety first I get it and TY for the complimentary bottle of wine BUT please fix the “ alarm malfunction” during the day while the guests are away enjoying Barcelona and it’s awesomeness. 

Overall we had a great week.  Hotel was location, location, location but the hotel needs an upgrade quickly.  

Would I stay again, NOPE even on points I’d stay at the Cotton House or W and good it.",3,2019,07,07
37,Amazing location,"We recently spent 4 nights here, and liked the hotel but would only return because of the location.  The location, on Las Ramblas, is amazing- it's a quick walk to almost anything in the main tourist area of Barcelona.  The staff was great and the concierge Ricardo helped with a tough dinner reservation and gave some other great recommendations for things to do and places to eat.  
The not so good- the hotel wifi was awful, we had the premier internet and it was so slow it was almost unusable.  Normal email inboxes (Yahoo and gmail) were incredibly slow to load.  The air conditioning was ok, but felt like the room got way colder during the day than at night.  The service was inconsistent- we only had turndown service 2 of the 4 nights we were there.
I would stay here again because of the location, but wouldn't plan to spend much time in the room, or rely on the hotel wifi if I needed to do any work.",4,2019,07,06
37,All I can is wow! In a bad way...,We are here for the first time in Barcelona on a much needed relaxation trip.   During the wee hours the alarm goes off continuously.  Rather than being pissed we decide to make a night of it and go out.  We get back at 5am on July 4 and they say all is fixed.  The alarm goes off again at 6 non stop.   What a joke!!!!!!!!!! And btw they gave us these apologetic letters.  Is that all????  ,1,2019,07,04
37,Felt like I was sleeping in Ikea but not as nice,"The location is fabulous but the rest falls really short.  The newly refurbished rooms feel like you are in Ikea - the cabinets and bed surround definitely are - which is fine I have them at home, but not what I expect in a purported five star hotel.  There is no sound proofing so you hear every shower, loo trip and everything else from the neighbors.  Which meant one night of no sleep.... followed by another night of NO SLEEP as the alarm system kept going off
Got a burned paella for supper but the rest of he food was ok and cheap enough. But was not a nice atmosphere 
Not worth the money",2,2019,07,04
37,Fantastic location,"Excellent hotel, fantastic location on la Rambla, walking distance to lots of attractions, we were made to feel very welcome on arrival and given a glass of Prosecco as room not quite ready. We had a newly renovated double room. Bed extremely comfortable and everywhere spotlessly clean, excellent breakfast and the food at dinner in the restaurant was extremely good, my husband said the steak was the best he had ever had. We were given complimentary tickets to gaudi’s guell palace which is really worth a visit.
Would certainly stay here again if in Barcelona.",5,2019,07,03
37,"Lovely hotel with friendly, excellent staff, and service","We were here in May on a Tauck tour. The staff were absolutely wonderful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. Rooms were very clean and recently remodeled. We received a lovely snack tray, compliments of the hotel. The champagne station in the lobby is a great touch. Staying in this hotel was a pleasure, and a great way to begin our tour.",4,2019,06,30
37,Platinum Member Approved,"We enjoyed a 5 night stay just last week and it was phenomenal.  The hotel is older, but the superior staff, the location and overall comfort of the accommodations is PERFECTION. From the checkin attendant, to breakfast greeter, to the consierge, they continue to recognize and thank me for my loyalty everyday all week.  I stay at Marriott properties around the globe and Le Meridien ranks as one of my top five in the world. 

Why do I love this property, let me count the way:
Complimentary champagne during checkin.
The Consierge team, Bruno and Diego helped me plan a special dinner at Martinez for my daughter's 21st birthday. Also, provided helpful transport tips throughout the week.  
We stayed in room 807, a spacious junior suite with great view, cozy sitting area and walk in closet. For two women, this was a score!
The breakfast is plentiful and features an omelet station.
Sonia works in the spa and she was magical with hot rock treatment.
The private patio and jacuzzi on the 6th floor are an awesome place to relax with a cocktail before dinner.
Dont forget to take advantage of the complimentary sauna.

No regrets, will definitely return.  The bar has been raised. Kudos to this location, they made our stay just dreamy and magical. 
",5,2019,06,30
37,Leaves a lot to be desired for a 5 star hotel,"Checkin was smooth and attentive.  Couldn’t have been friendlier.  Even the manager came over to introduce herself and offer suggestions.  But the room and its condition left a lot to be desired for a 5 star hotel.  The bathroom and the shower looked tired and needed some work – and they should sack the interior decorator you specified glass doors on the bathroom which offer zero privacy when the toilet is being used.  When we departed we left them with a list of maintenance items (lights, doors, the shower, etc) which should have been apparent to their housekeeping staff and not dependent on guests reporting them.",3,2019,06,28
37,Location location lovatikn,"Quick 2 night stay w my son..have been to this location before. We are loyal Marriott customers and wanted easy w good AC and breakfast and central
To what we were seeing in a quick stop in Barcelona. We like to do a VRBO to be more authentic and get local flavor but on short stays a hotel can be so helpful. Clean rooms nice bath,glass barn door w tub and not just a blow dryer but a hair straighter ahh how great since packing light and different electrical never allows for hair tools:) water coffee and. Fridge in room. Safe for the passports.. Easy $30 cab from airport , metro near by, train station close and walking to gothic, mercat, colon, beach and so many wonderful eats.. easy and convenient. Barcelona is a more pricey hotel city like a Boston ,  so it wasn’t a bargain. Madrid on the other hand ..1/3 of the price for a similar room in June ",4,2019,06,25
37,Great Location and Nice Hotel for Sightseeing in Barcelona,"We were 2 couples staying at the Le Meridien Barcelona for 4 nights June 16-20.  We reserved two deluxe king rooms which were the standard lowest level rooms that came with a Delta Vacation air/hotel package. Our rooms were 437 and 537 which faced the back of the hotel so it was quiet at night.  We received no perks as no one was a Marriott frequent guest member.  We stayed for 4 nights to sightsee in Barcelona after returning from a 7 night Royal Caribbean cruise, so we had lots of luggage.  We arrived early on the 16th as the cruise ship returned to port at 9:00am.  Our rooms were not ready that early, but the staff at the front desk were all very attentive and assisted us as soon as we arrived.  Marios checked us in and was very helpful as there were issues with our reservations.  He got this all sorted out right away.  Our rooms were ready at about 11:00am, which was still earlier that we expected given that the hotel was very busy and this was very much appreciated. 

The rooms were very clean, newly renovated and spacious, and could accommodate all of our luggage with space enough to easily move about.  The king size beds  were standard large king beds and comfortable.  Two different style pillows were also provided, firm and soft.  The shower was roomy with great water pressure and two different sized shower heads, including a rain shower head.  

The hotel provided 2 bottles of water each night, which was nice.  We didn't reserve the ""breakfast included"" room as it was an extra 28 euros per person per night.  However, we found a great American breakfast for about 9 euros at La Viena Blanca, which is located steps away from the hotel entrance (go to the right after exiting the hotel and walk less than a block on the same side of the street as the hotel).  

I wouldn't consider the deluxe rooms that we reserved to be 5 star rooms, but they were certainly well worth what we paid considering the room features, cleanliness, bathroom facilities, location of the hotel and the hotel staff helpfulness and friendliness. The doorman were all extremely helpful with unloading and loading all of our luggage, and the concierge was also extremely helpful to us in navigating the city and in helping us get to prearranged tour departure points.

The mini bar in the room is weighted, so don't touch or move anything in it as you will be charged.  There is a sign inside of the mini bar door that says this, but it's not that visible.  My husband did move a bag of cookies that were falling before we read this sign and we were charged for the cookies.  I simply told the front desk this at check out and there was no problem removing this charge - no questions asked.  

I would certainly recommend the Le Meridien Barcelona to others visiting Barcelona.  I plan to return in 2026 when the La Sagrada Familia is complete and would stay here again.",5,2019,06,24
37,In the heart of Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed for 5 nights in April 2019. We are loyal customers of Marriott because of the cleanliness, service, and amenities and this hotel did not disappoint! Check-in was quick and efficient. We came in from the US on an early flight and had to wait for our room so opted to walk around Barcelona. The location is excellent-right in the middle of everything. La Boqueria (open-air market) is about a 3 minute walk. I highly recommend you eat there or, at least, pick up some wine and snacks to have later. There is also a Carrefour market 5 minutes in the other direction for any other sundry items you may need. The entrance to the old part of the city is right across Las Ramblas from Le Meridien.  We encountered wonderful service form everyone in the hotel and our room was spotless. It look like the rooms have been newly renovated and it was very welcoming. The room was very quiet-we had a great night's sleep every night. Breakfast was included in our reservation and was enjoyable every morning with a great selection of items and an omelet chef every morning. 

I highly recommend Le Meridien if you are staying in Barcelona.  The location, service, and newly renovated rooms can't be beat! We would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,06,24
37,"Great Location, Wonderful Staff!","My partner and I stayed here on a recent trip to Spain. The rooms are clean and modern.  The hotel is conveniently located and the staff are fantastic! If we didn’t want our room made up, the service staff would check in to make sure we didn’t need anything. 

Every morning when I would get back from my run, I was greeted with a smile, a bottle of water and a small towel! It was fantastic! 

My ONLY complaint, the free wifi was terrible! If you want the good wifi, you have to pay extra for it.",5,2019,06,23
37,Lovely hotel in great location ,"Stayed in this central hotel for one night post cruise. Nice room and great staff. Lovely spa area and sun terrace. Our room was at the back of the hotel and very quiet. 
Breakfast good. Would stay here again.",5,2019,06,20
37,Lovely hotel in good location ,"I stayed here on my first trip to Barcelona, so while I have nothing to compare the location to, I found it had a ton of great dining, shopping, and sight-seeing options within easy walking distance. It was a bit of a drive from the convention center, but I liked that the neighborhood was more walking friendly than that of the convention center. 

As a platinum I was given an upgrade to a bigger room, and early checkin when I landed, always a pleasure though seldom do I assume it anymore. The breakfast buffet was more than enough to meet my needs each morning, so that was nice too. There’s a great bar at the hotel across the street (Hotel 1898) so you can pop in for a night cap after a long day. 

Overall I look forward to staying here again next year when I am back for business. ",5,2019,06,19
37,Close to everything...an intimate well maintained hotel,"Spent 2 nights here prior to a Mediterranean cruise. This property is a 3 minute walk from Placa Catalunya where you can pick up the hop on/hop off bus. Also, all kinds of restaurants are within a 5 minute walk.

Sassi checked us in and was superb.

The hotel upgraded us (Marriott Life time Titanium) to a very nice 'family room'. Very large with a view of the street...beautiful bathroom and oh, so very much room....throughout.

The staff was excellent and the breakfast buffet had more than enough items to start your day.

The only negative was that we set a wakeup call for both mornings. The 1st morning, the call never came and the second morning it was 20 minutes late. The wake up calls are NOT automated.  Good thing we didn't have a plane to catch! They did give us 2000 Reward points for the inconvenience.

We would definitely stay there again if in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,10
37,Great stay,"The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful, the rooms are newly renovated+bright and clean. And the hotel is conveniently located on a side street of the touristy Las Ramblas. 
Only one minor complaint was that Breakfast was poorly organised and they were clearly understaffed, when we ordered scrambled eggs a la Carte, they simply scooped up some cold eggs leftover from the buffet and served it to us. ",5,2019,06,10
37,Le Meridien Excellent Location and nice hotel,"Stayed at this hotel in May 2019.  Excellent location on La Ramblas and overall very nice hotel.  Our room was facing La Ramblas and we could hear the subway rumble past underground, so it was noisy but did not pose a problem for us.  The room had been newly remodeled and I very much enjoyed the functionality of the bathroom remodel.  The breakfast was very nice and loved the omelet bar.  Would stay here again.",5,2019,06,08
37,The area is too busy,"I stayed here for a couple of nights. If you're in Barcelona and want to be near Ramblas, Perfect! If not avoid this hotel and every other in the neighborhood. The whole place is crawling with tourists from just after Easter until end Sep.
The rooms are small and a bit tired.",3,2019,06,08
37,Brilliant stay - fantastic hospitality,"We had a great stay in this property. Miss Ana Miquel and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were well looked after while in this wonderful city. The location is great - everything within walking distance. The room we had was brilliant for a family with two kids (Family Suite). We were invited to a Paella cooking experience - which was a great Marriott moment.

Strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2019,06,06
37,"Great location, functional but it is in need of a makeover. Way overpriced for the quality",We stayed 2 nights prior to boarding our cruise. The location of the hotel is great - in the center of the city but as a result it has a very high traffic volume.The staff was friendly and helpful. Because we were part of a tour group we were put in an older room with twin beds (many hotels do this). When we asked for a room with a king sized bed they were very accommodating but still put us in one of the much older rooms in need of an upgrade. We understand that many hotels do with with tour groups  but usually the rate reflects the quality of the room. Here we were way overcharged ($900 a night) for the accommodations provided. When we questioned the rate we were told it was the cruise line's rate. When we asked the cruise line we were told the rates were set by the hotel.,2,2019,06,05
37,Good hotel - good location,"This is a classic. I had stayed here before and I liked it again this time. It is perfectly located at la Rambla, right in the center of the city. 

I felt very welcome when I arrived with friendly and professional service at check in. My room looked brand new. The bathroom was really comfy and had all the amenities one could think of and than some. Breakfast was very nice. Staff were all very helpful. 

In short – I liked this place. Recommended.",4,2019,06,04
37,Barcelona March 2019,"A fantastic location - right on the Ramblas. Attractions such as the Place Catalunya, Passig de Gracia, Grand Via and the Boqueria market are all a short walk as well as the  Columbus Monument overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. All public transportations such as the metro, bus lines and airport connection bus stops are a walking distance. It is located in a vibrant district with an array of restaurants, cafes and Tapas bars. The restaurant in the hotel is good and service excellent.",4,2019,06,02
37,Wonderful!,"Awesome location, great service, and nice room.  We stayed in the suite with the large terrace and loved it.  It’s right near all the action but on a quiet side street.  We were very happy with the terrific staff and great room service as well.  ",5,2019,06,01

37,Incredible staff. Clean.,"Loved our stay here. It's in the perfect location. I don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel with nicer staff members. I was blown away. The only suggestion I have is to lower the height of the bathtub/shower combos. It was so tall, I had to use the railings to get in and out and was afraid I would slip. Beautiful room. Lots of space. ",4,2019,05,20
37,"Great location in Barcelona, top staff","Le Meridien is in a great location on La Ramblas. Easy walking to many of the city's attractions and close to a train station for travelling further afield.

The hotel is quite good without being outstanding. We paid extra for a Junior Suite, which gave us a high floor with a balcony overlooking La Ramblas. Our room was spacious and comfortable. It could do with new carpet and the decor is on the dark side colour-wise, but we enjoyed our 4 nights there.  Had very good sleep as the combination of the balcony and double glazing meant it was quiet despite the late night noisy people just below.

I'd happily stay at Le Meridien when visiting Barcelona again.",4,2019,05,19
37,Review of LeMeridien hotel,"The room was very modern and clean with a very comfortable bed.  The location was excellent and the staff was extremely friendly. Great restaurants , las ramblas, and market nearby. Close to old town with Picasso museum and Barcelona cathedral nearby.",5,2019,05,18
37,Second stay. Few more additional observations,"My first stay was end of last year https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d229679-r638659435-Le_Meridien_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html This time while I was offered the upgrade to the new room it was twin beds instead of a king, I decided to stay in the standard room. As far as I can tell the only difference is the new rooms have lighter decor and do not have wall to wall carpet. The bed felt the same and most important the bathroom is the same, i.e. renovated. The only criticism I have of the room is the lack of soap tray in the shower. So either you keep all the little bottles in your hand or you'll be bending back and forth all the time. I did use the gym this time and I was disappointed to see it seems to be used also by non-hotel guests for personal training lessons. It is not a big space. A PT with two clients doing a circuit, and it feels very small. Other than those few observations, it is a great place to stay for a reasonable price in downtown.",4,2019,05,18
37,Amazing Staff and Location,"This was our first time to Barcelona from California and we were nervous about transportation from the airport to the hotel because we were getting in late and didn't know what was the best transportation to use.  Sophia reached out to us a week before we were to leave on her own and answered so many questions that we had.  The fantastic service and friendliness from ALL the staff never stopped.  We ended up being very excited and feeling comfortable that we were in good hands before we left for our trip.  Our driver was ready and waiting for us after we landed at the airport.  He was very friendly and kind.
The location of the hotel is the best ever.  It is near transportation, Hop on Hop Off, La Rambla and walking distance to so many many beautiful locations and even the water. There is also a grocery store very close as well.
The only thing we were not crazy about was the restaurant attached to the hotel.  It was nice to have the convenience but we were able to find much better restaurants close by and even across the street.
You will not be disappointed in the hotel it is fantastic.",5,2019,05,16
37,Location ! Staff! Breakfast! Everything !,"Miguel checked us in, and was SO helpful with all of our questions. The staff will go out of their way to assure you are happy. Easy walk on La Rambla to the port, or taxi stand right outside will get you anywhere quickly. We did the tram, Parc Guell, Gaudi Museum and so on, all were easily accessible",5,2019,05,16
37,Amazing staff and time on La Rambla,"Booked three nights with points. This was my first time in Barcelona and the concierge Bruno and another individual helped me plan my stay. Great recommendations for sights and restaurants. Room was extremely clean. I highly would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting that wants to stay on La Rambla. I will definitely stay here again when I return, the staff at Le Méridien made me feel like I was at home every time I walked back in the doors of the hotel.",5,2019,05,16
37,Wonderful stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the Meridian. It is an older hotel but well kept. The staff was very friendly and helpful. One of the best things about the hotel is the location. It is right on La Rambla, close to many restaurants, shops and transportation. Great breakfast service. We also enjoyed a delicious lunch at the hotel. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,05,15
37,Great Location,This place is right off Las Rambles and we were greeted from the time we arrived to the time we left with incredibly helpful and friendly staff.  The rooms are updated and very clean and comfortable.  The bathroom is modern and nicely done with lovely tile throughout.  My only feedback would be that it's a big step over the tub to get into and out of the shower.  It was ok for my husband but I am quite a bit shorter and it was a little bit of a challenge.  Overall however i would say it's definitely a high recommend from me!,5,2019,05,14
37,Wonderful ,We stayed here for only two nights. It definitely was not long enough. The hotel is surrounded by wonderful restaurants and just around the corner is a long street that has great little stalls that sell souvenirs as well as your choice of street foods and snacks ,5,2019,05,14
37,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Staff is very helpful and professional, in particular the bellmen and front personnel. Special recognition to Iñaki who went out to La Rambla to get a taxi for us, when we ckecked out as they were hard to get and scarce because it was a very busy Sunday morning. We got a renovated room on floor 1 on the La Rambla side. We heard some noise from the street but it was no issue. The noise we did not liked was the rumbling of the metro that could be heard in the room. Again an excellent hotel in the best location of Barcelona.",5,2019,05,12
37,Great Location with Friendly Staff,"Le Meridien is situated in a great location on La Ramblas.  The staff was amazing and very accomodating.  They are currently renovating the rooms so when you check in ask for a newly renovated room. We had a Jr. Suite that wasn't renovated but was still in good condition.  It was clean and a had a balcony.  The bathrooms were ok.  It was tight and awkwardly designed.  If you've traveled to Europe, the hotel bathrooms are much different than american hotels.  If you can get a room with a terrace, it's worth it for the view.  The hotel is in a convenient location to Plaza Catalunya where most of the tours pick/up & drop off.   The breakfast was great and offered a wide variety of breakfast selections. Highly recommend the hotel.",5,2019,05,09
37,Super friendly staff,"I stayed at this Le Meridien for two nights and was especially struck by the super friendly, attentive and polite (young) staff: although I arrived early, I was offered a coffee since my room was not fully ready yet, my room was upgraded and the day after check-in, a staff member who had not done my check-in, addressed me by my name, as I turned to him with a question. The room was newly renovated, the bed was great, as was breakfast. Highly recommended!",5,2019,05,07
37,"Great Location, Very Quiet, Well Serviced and Friendly","Le Meridian is about as centrally located as you could ask for, right in La Ramblas.  The deluxe rooms are pleasant, have plenty of room and comfortable king beds and pillows.  There is a restaurant/bar downstairs, and a barrista and breakfast food available in the lobby.  The lobby staff were always helpful with directions or questions. When my husband had a bad reaction to something he ate, the hotel called the doctor and he was there within the hour. We really appreciated their prompt attention.  We will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,05,03
37,"Excellent location, excellent staff!","The location is next to La Rambla, walking distance to everything entertainment that you may find interesting. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. The staff is quite knowledgeable and very nice.",5,2019,04,28
37,Worst visit over the years,"I’ve stayed at this property a few times over the past decade. I’ve always had good experiences thus chosen to stay here again. Unfortunately this time it was terrible. 

As lifetime titanium member I received no suite upgrade. (In the past with lesser status, they’ve always put me in a suite). I knew the family suite was available when i checked in (because you can book it), but was told that the suite is not part of the complementary upgrades. You can search in prior reviews that instances of upgrade to a family suite was provided. And as an elite Marriott member I was placed on the second floor and with st jordi festival, it was quite noisy. 

When I checked out, I saw 3 bell persons doing nothing. None offered to help with luggage. When I asked to see if I can open the luggage door / emergency door, the guy just opened and again no luggage assistance even when I pointed to him that the car waiting outside was mine. 

Anyhow, this past time was my last at this property. 

",2,2019,04,25
37,Le Meridien Barcelona WOW,"Le Meridien Barcelona is located right on La Rambla.  The location is excellent.  The hotel has renovated the rooms since the last time we were here 12 years ago and it is really beautiful.   Our suite faced La Rambla and we were not bothered by the noise at all because the windows were really insulating.
The staff is superb here.  Check in was easy.  They were kind enough to give us a room after flying all night so we had a minute to rest before starting our vacation.  We upgraded to a suite and it was so worth it.  Huge, clean, beautiful.
We stayed 7 nights and the staff remembered our name after one day.  They are professional, warm and welcoming.  From the front desk at check in, the concierges, the waitstaff in CentOnze to housekeeping (who btw were so spot on excellent).
The hotel lobby is inviting.  We didn't use the gym but saw it and they have everything you need for a work out.   Walking the city and taking day tours put us up to the 20,000 step mark, so need for us to use the gym.
I would have liked to use the spa but we chose to use the jacuzzi tub in the huge bathroom instead to unwind.  Great bathroom.  Wish the lighting was brighter though.  Shaving and putting make up on without good lighting was the one thing that  should be improved.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a beautiful hotel with a staff of ladies and gentlemen who go out of their way to make you feel cared for.",5,2019,04,24
37,Perfect Location!  Don’t stay anywhere else. ,"We took the Aerobus from the Barcelona Airport and it drops off two blocks away at Placa Catalunya. Staying right on La Rambla is perfect for access to Metro and proximity to the Gothic Quarter. 
We loved walking to the market and gorging on street food. 
The entire staff at Le Meridien were welcoming, eager to please and incredibly gracious. 
The included breakfast was fantastic!   We are eager to return someday. 
My only small complaint is the perfumy smell that they pump into the lobby. (Which I think is a Le Meridien thing worldwide). It’s too sweet smelling and gives me a small headache. I would just hold my breath until I got to the elevator. 😜",5,2019,04,23
37,A Wonderful Experience,"This was our first trip to Barcelona. We don’t speak Catalan; we don’t speak Spanish. When we’re is a foreign country and cannot speak or read the native language, we always feel somewhat insecure. The staff at Len Meridien did an absolutely outstanding job of allaying our fears and making us feel extremely comfortably.
   It started with Sofia, who communicated with us in advance of our trip. She arranged
for the airport transportation in a manner that made us comfortable. Our next experience was with Edwardo at check in. He was very patient with us, gave us an overview of the area, and helped us feel good about being in Barcelona. Next we met Santiago. We had some questions and some minor concerns with some of the facilities in our room. In a very pleasant way, Santiago fixed the deficiencies and made us feel comfortable. Finally the concierge, Diego, found restaurants for us in the areas where we were comfortable walking and with food that was appealing. He was able to make a reservation for us in a restaurant where we could not reserve ourselves, and as a result we wound up being seated in a special table. 
   Kudos to Le Meridien and its excellent staff if I could rate this experience higher than a five, I would.",5,2019,04,23
37,"Functional, good location ","The room was ok, modern, nothing special about it.
Bathroom was a bit dated, there was mould in between shower bathroom tiles. This is not acceptable to me.
I ordered room service, the menu for in room dining was to limited compare with the majority of the hotels I visit.
Breakfast buffet was fine and service there was also fine.
They allowed me for late check out which was good, as I had meetings all morning. Location is good.
I would rate this hotel 3.5.",3,2019,04,19
37,Great Location but needs updating,"This property sits right on the famous Rambla. It allows you to walk to almost every tourist spot in town and also to the tourist double decker bus stop just 3 blocks away. The people here work really hard to make your stay successful. Only issue with this place is that the lobby, resteraunt rooms are outdated. If your primary need is a clean, nice room near the sights this place is great. If you want things like a modern lobby and a freshened room with fast WiFi this is not your place. The Concierge here is very helpful and Marriott titanium people get the full breakfast for free which is rare for Europe. With some freshening this hotel could be one of the best in Barcelona. For now I’d give it a B rating. ",3,2019,04,18
37,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"The Meridtien is centrally located, on Las Ramblas, and offers superb service.  We arrived with plenty of luggage, fresh off a cruise, and the bellmen were extremely helpful in getting everything to our room.  We had a double room on a newly renovated floor.  Our room was spacious enough, with plenty of storage space.  The bathroom was modern and well designed.  We had the buffet breakfast in the restaurant, and it was terrific.  There were many selections, from fruit to hot offerings.  My wife and I had omelets prepared to order, and they were very tasty.  The Meridien is a wonderful place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2019,04,15
37,Amazing Stay,"We had only one day in Barcelona. However, Le Meridien and their wonderful staff made it unforgettable. We were fortunate to be upgraded to an incredible suite, with a large terrace/balcony and great views. The breakfast buffet was delicious. I’m off before checking out for a complimentary steam and sauna in the spa. 
Oh... and the location on La Rambla was right in the middle of everything. 
If you are visiting Barcelona, especially if you are a Marriott Bonvoy member, this is where you need to stay!",5,2019,04,15
37,Great location,Nice hotel situated in a great location. Right at La Rambla but entrance is at the side road which is ideal as not too crowded. Room is of reasonable size and clean. Breakfast is great. Not too big a hotel as I would have expected of other le meridian. Overall great stay of a week there.,4,2019,04,13
37,5 stars with the highest recommendation,"What made this an excellent hotel experience was the staff. Every single employee went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Throughout the hotel (registration, restaurant, concierge & so on) are employees who appear to love their job. I feel guilty about singling out any staff, but Ana in reception and Paula in the the restaurant went out of their way.

Check-in (with Cava) was smooth I had received an upgrade from Marriott - I was offered a suite immediately on the 4th floor, but they encouraged me to wait for a better suite on the 7th floor that would be opening an hour later, which gave us the opportunity to discover the area. The staff gave us two tickets to Paula Guell, a house designed by Gaudi which was a short walk away.

The location may not be to every taste. On the plus side, the hotel is 400 meters from Placa de Catalunya (the final stop for the airport bus) and  convenient to many places you will want to visit. We walked to the Cathedral (10 mins) Le Pedera (20 mins) Sagrada Famila, (45 mins) the beach (40 mins) - for areas that were a little further we used the Metro (2.20 € one way) On the negative, La Rambla is like Times Square, hectic and crowded. We were constantly warned of pickpockets and did witness a commotion that appeared to be just that. I would encourage you to watch a YouTube video ""Pickpockets in Barcelona"" before you leave.

You are surrounded by some great places to eat - Bar Lobo & Gats are casual, but very good and literally across the street (away from La Rambla) the market on La Rambla should be seen, but it's touristy and Emilia is excellent for gelato (also on La Rambla) If you want to have a drink in your room, there is a large supermarket, literally next door.",5,2019,04,12
37,Great Location and unforgettable Experience!,"I have stayed there for 4 nights. Perfect location allows you to get access to most of the famous tourist spots by walks. Hotel was very clean and all the staff there were so willing to help you to explore the city. I would like to extend my special thanks to Sophia who has provided me so valuable advice before my arrival. That has really enriched my trip in Barcelona. Also the check-in experience was so great. Thanks to Bruno. And Miguel, Marius were also being so helpful for helping me find good restaurants and explore the city. Really recommend Le Meridien Barcelona. Still my first choice if any chance to go visit Barcelona again next time.",5,2019,04,11
37,Nice experience,Spent 4 nights for business purpose. Do not expect a 5-star luxury hotel like some palaces but good experience overall. Central location. Nice welcome. Good service. Rooms ok. Mini-bar poor. Breakfast ok.,4,2019,04,09
37,Most Excellent Visit!,"From check in to check out, this hotel and its staff go above and beyond! Located right in the middle of the Gotic quarter, you could not ask for a better location! Front Office Manager, Alex made sure to greet us upon arrival and was very gracious! The remainder of our stay was made extremely fantastic by Ana - her level of dedication and genuineness is unsurpassed within the hospitality industry! A most special thanks to her! Overall, you could not choose a better hotel for a stay for business, romance, or holiday!",5,2019,04,09
37,Live the la Rambla experience,"You have here a perfect location for a city break in Barcelona. La Rambla just in front of you (you see it from the breakfast room) and much of what Barcelona has to offer in walking distance from here. Pl Catalunya, just a few minutes away where the tourist bus awaits you. The rooms are nice, we had a newly renovated room on the first floor, but completely quiet. The staff are super friendly, and will help you with any questions or request you have. The rooms have a mini-bar and beds are good. If they just add a coat hanger in the room for your outdoor coat, it would be perfect. Great hotel!",5,2019,04,07
37,"Centrally Locate, Friendly Staff","We stayed in mid-late March with our baby. They were able to accommodate our needs (including a bath mat so I could shower the baby safely and breakfast for our baby very early in the morning before our departure). The 1st room (“upgrade”) they gave us was a little bit of a mess, large, noisy and dark, AC not working and bath features falling apart. However, they were able to switch us right away to a nicer quieter room facing the street not La Rambla with perfectly functioning AC. Be mindful that the AC is not ON during certain times of the year so please confirm with the staff (multiple times) before booking. Staff was amazing, super nice and friendly with our baby and us. The breakfast buffet was ok, but definitely not worth the 20-something€ they charge per person. ",4,2019,04,06
37,Highly Recommended ,"Booked 4 nights to stay at Le Meriden through Costco Travel. Was upgraded to a renovated room at check in- maybe poor reviews are for unrenovated rooms???,  as our quiet second floor room facing away from La Rambla was just the right size and tastefully finished. Maid service has been impeccable as well as the ladies at check in, the concierge, and the restaurant staff. Special commendation to Santi at breakfast- a happy friendly welcoming individual who made our stay complete. Breakfast choices are diverse and tasteful and we definitely recommend this hotel for quality of service, accommodation, location, and value. ",5,2019,03,21
37,Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona ,"I enjoyed a wonderful stay with outstanding well appointed service by the whole staff.  This hotel is steps away from the Las Ramblas, Barri Gothic, Le Rival, El Born and Barcelona Harbor.  I will definitely be back.",5,2019,03,14
37,“Good central location; Clean & Modern Hotel”,"“Good central location; Clean & Modern Hotel”

We have stayed in Barcelona before, but while our last hotel here was in a good tourist location, near a Cathedral, that hotel was old and run down.  We like the Marriott chain, so we chose this hotel “Le Meridien” partly to continue gathering Marriott Rewards Points, but also because it looked nice, and seemed to be in a good area for us as walking tourists, and also, it ended up that our cruise tour was gathering at this hotel too.
We spent two nights here, and upon checking in, we were upgraded to a “Family Suite”.  The front desk staff was nice (as were the rest of the hotel staff and restaurant employees), and the lobby and upstairs hallways leading to the rooms were modern, clean and nice.  The hotel was right across the street from “Las Ramblas”, the famed Barcelona major street that serves as a pedestrian walking-shopping plaza, so it was easy to walk around the area, to see things and look for nearby restaurants, etc.  It was a short 10 minute walk to a local “Hop On, Hop Off” bus stop, in a nearby main square, which we used for sightseeing, touring, and getting around to various sights.  There was a nice, big, clean, modern supermarket/grocery story “Carrefour”, next to the hotel, on Las Ramblas, which was a fun market to explore, and to buy snacks.  That market had fair prices and lots of great take out foods available, as well as inexpensive wine and sodas, etc.
The room was nicely large and very good sized, for European hotel rooms (often inadequately small rooms that are overpriced).  There was a big living room area with a couch and LCD TV, with a small eating table and two chairs, and a desk.  There was a King sized bed in the separate bedroom with a good, firm mattress and nice soft pillows.  There was a good sized, ultra-modern bathroom, with one of the nicest, fun, and largest walk-in granite shower areas that we have seen, with two choices of different shower heads.  One end of the shower walk in “tunnel-cave” had a “deluge” “rain” type ceiling shower head, and the other direction in the shower tunnel, had a shower wand on a hose.  There was a separate bathtub as well.  The tile/granite in the bathroom was beautiful!   There was a mini-refrigerator, a free digital safe, and double glass paned windows (noise reduction).  We had a view on to a side alley, so it was nice to be able to see sunlight and activity outside and on the street.  The air conditioning worked well and was quiet, there was a closet, and 1 portable luggage rack.  Our hotel booking included daily buffet breakfast, where there were all of the typical offerings, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, potatoes, breads, juices, as well as a cook-to-order omelet egg station.  The food was good, with lots of variety and we could eat a quick breakfast, then get out to see things for the day.  The hotel rooftop has an outside viewing balcony area that is accessible, where there are great views of the city sights all around you, including views of some of the mountain top venue sites of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, including the Montjuic Swim-Water Polo-Dive Stadium.   The roof also has a small day-spa area.",5,2019,03,10
37,This is not 5 stars ,"Very old and unpleasant hotel with very small staff, as a traveler all over the world over 40 years , I never see 5 stars hotel that so cheap 
This is maybe 3 stars no AC IN THE ROOM 
NOTHING WORKS 
the breakfast omelette section was nice but all the rest looks not fresh
The staff on Resturant friendly ",1,2019,03,09
37,Meridien Barcelona,"Excellent hotel and wonderful accomodations.  \Located in a great area with easy walking to retaurants and museums.  The local market was a few blocks away and you can buy any kind of fish, meat and vegetables that are fresh and local. ",5,2019,03,08
37,Exceptional Service - Great Location,"Great location with exceptional service.  Marius checked us in and explained everything to us very well.  Super nice guy that was very knowledgeable.  Room was small but fine.  Nothing super special.  But great location.  

The staff at breakfast and the bar were all awesome providing great service.  Especially Andrea, Joan, and Simone at breakfast.  Very attentive.  We never had to ask for anything. The breakfast buffet spread was very nice.  Much nicer than the Cotton House where we had stayed previously.",3,2019,03,04
37,"Fabulous Hotel, Location & Staff","The front desk, valet, and concierge were all wonderful!  They gave us great recommendations for food & activities (and helped with directions!).  The hotel has a convenient location on La Rambla -- easy to get to Plaça de Catalunya station (for the metro/trains).  We had a car but parked it at the hotel and walked or used public transport for the 3 days we were there.  The hotel is clean and maintained, the rooms were comfortable, and my only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,04
37,Perfect Location Along La Ramblas,"Stayed here for one night on a stop over between Boston and Morocco.  Perfect location right along La Ramblas and near Mercato de la Boqueira. You can easily walk to dozens of fun upscale tapas restaurants, down to the Waterfront, up to Eixample, and to Barrington Gothic.  Perfect people watching at breakfast from their restaurant. Breakfast buffet was very nice.  As an Ambassador Elite member they kindly upgraded us to a larger room, which was newly renovated. Very nice bathroom, very modern, comfortable bed, window that opens and very spacious for European standard rooms. Front desk crew were extremely pleasant, efficient and helpful and snagged us a prime dinner reservation (at RAO, highly recommend), where I had had no luck. Easily caught a cab to the airport.  Very pleasant stay here. Nice hotel, very pleasant staff and great location for exploring the city.",5,2019,02,26
37,Great hotel and wonderful staff team,"We came over to have a bit of a celebratory week in Barcelona.  I’ve stayed at the W many time and we want to stay more in the heart if the city this time.  
The Le Méridien is in a prime location right on Las Ramblas.  You’re only a few minutes walk to the Market and 1.5 blocks for the center with All the local transportation options.  

The staff at reception was super friendly and helpful. The team in the restaurant for breakfast was amazing and very welcoming.  Our room was most relaxing and very well appointed.  showing a few picture but it’s well in to the week and the room is lived in. 🤗

All in all a phenomenal week. ",5,2019,02,22
37,Excellent location; courteous and professional staff,"Spent 5 nights recently at this property.  Was very positively impressed with the quality of service, personal touch and pleasant experience from all the hotel staff.  Ana Miquel the Guest Relations Manager was particularly noteworthy.  We were invited to a complimentary paella class with free food and drinks while we were there.  The room was cleaned and serviced multiple times in a day.  Its a great choice of hotel if you are visiting Barcelona.",5,2019,02,18
37,"Good Hotel, but not Perfect","The A+ location of this hotel comes with some challenges.  The rooms are smaller than you would like, but probably on par for a central location like this. The main issue was the noise. Remember, you are staying on La Rambla, so if you’re hoping for a quiet night’s rest, this may not be the place for you. Maybe there are interior rooms that are quieter, but ours faced the street and we could hear every conversation.  The staff was warm and welcoming the whole time though.  We would most likely stay here again. ",4,2019,02,10
37,The worst Le Meridien of all,"I am an SPG member and i always prefer SPG hotels. And i am generally very happy with the quality. But in Barcelona, i had a very different experience. I was there to stay only one night and when i arrived i had to leave in 1 hour to a client dinner. The room was very very cold, around 10 degrees celcius. I called the front desk after 3 minutes of my check-in. I told the guy that i need a shower and i need to change this room. He told me that i am not
‘Allowed’ to change the room before maintenance checks the heating. I told him
that it has been only 3 minutes since my
Check in, my bag is still outside. But he told me that i need to wait in the room and wait for the guy and i cant change the room.  After 20 minutes, maintenance came. He said that heating works fine but it will take a while to heat the room. After waiting for 1 hour i had to leave my freezing room without having my shower. On my way out i complained to supervisor and she told me that all the rooms are cold and i will have to wait for 1 hour in any room to heat in the winter.  So my recommendation is to avoid this hotel if you want to have a nice warm shower when you check in.  ",1,2019,01,30
37,"Location, Location, Location","We chose to stay at this hotel as we wanted a five star hotel on Las Ramblas.  This was our send trip to Barcelona and we anticipated spending most of our time in the Las Ramblas area.

The location was great.  It was perfect for our trip.  

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet--a good selection.  

The service was good.  The concierge helped us with some things and the staff helped us with our voluminous luggage.  There were taxis available when we wanted them--quite convenient.

The hotel is quite modern, a contrast with most of the area.  

I would consider staying here again.  I am giving it four stars rather than five as there was no wow factor.",4,2019,01,25
37,very convenient location,"best thing about the hotel is the location which is quite close to  La Rambla… where everything takes place in Barcelona :)
rooms were a but old and not so big, but clean and the staff was friendly…
cost wise, it was expensive... if one is booking well in advance, then you can get a better deal, or a better choice... but the location is key advantage",5,2019,01,23
37,GREAT BARCELONA,"Great location along La Rambla and with good restaurants around. Staff not too friendly though. The room is a bit small and the bathtub is too "" high "" - a bit dangerous for elderly traveler. Some improvement needed",4,2019,01,15
37,So refreshing,"The high review is because of the friendliness of the staff. First, we were locked out of our airbnb at midnight and after arguing with the host to come help us the company suggested we find a hotel for the night. At 1 am. With a child. We found this place on priceline and called to book it but when we showed the hotel did not have the reservation. The lady at the desk said it was fine, gave us a new reservation that was way cheaper than priceline and sent us to the room.

This hotel will take care of everything. The moment we drove up they took our car and any bags we had. They exchanged currency, packed up our car before we left, and had a great room service menu. (don't order the nachos though, its just doritos with guac). We took our room cleaning sign off our door around 6pm before we went out, and when we returned around 11pm they had made our beds and cleaned the room. 
The location is also great-we went for the 3 kings day parade and it was a 5 min walk. You step out of the hotel and you can seriously walk to whatever you want (groceries, food, shopping, museums, ect). 

The only bad thing is that after we checked out they tried to say we owed them money because they gave us a discount they didn't mean too. It took a few days for them to understand that we were not going to pay a different amount than what we were billed, but after a few days we didn't hear from them again. The wifi in the room is terrible. We were barely able to load a google page and our tv wouldn't pick up signals.",5,2019,01,15
37,Fine for business stay,"Second time here.  Friendly staff.  Comfortable bed and pillows.

Room slightly dated but there was a Bear With Us teddy bear explaining they were renovating rooms (I arrived at 10 pm and left before 8 am so experienced to noise).

No night light in the bathroom but light on my charger was enough to navigate.

Good breakfast array and friendly staff.  Central location.  

On our corporate list and didn’t choose for myself but would consider staying privately if rates compared with similar choices.",4,2019,01,14
37,"Great location, fantastic staff, comfortable room","Due to prior comments about this hotel, I was unsure my choice was right but actually it was! The location is just perfect if you visit Barcelona as a tourist, close to everything worth being seen, with a special mention to 'Casa Guell' which entrance is free for Meridien guests. My room was large and very comfortable (good window system so not too much noise from outside although it's right over the Rambla, which as usual was very busy).",4,2019,01,13
37,Disappointing,"Check in was quick and the front desk staff pleasant and professional. They had my room ready even though I had a very early check in. Their regular deluxe rooms however are dated, dark and noisy. There was a lot of construction noise throughout the day that in two nights it went well into the night. The reception staff denied that construction was going on, but the noise was intense. Even worse, their internet connection is extremely slow, so that I was not able to do much work. This time the front desk staff blamed the slowness to the integration into SPG's network....unlikely. Overall, a disappointing stay that is making me question the Le Meridien brand.",2,2019,01,11
37,Outstanding Hotel,"Le Meridien in Barcelona is a great hotel in the heart of Barcelona.

Warm and professional service, my first choice when I travel to Barcelona and highly recommended especially if you are an SPG member.",5,2018,12,26
37,Outstanding service with a location to kill for,"We actually switched to this hotel from the Renaissance Barcelona Fira hotel upon realizing how far it was from the action.  We couldn’t have selected a better alternative.  Upon arrival the staff was outstanding.  We were shown various room upgrade options and were able to get a great deal on our upgrade to a corner suite city view with adjoining twin room.  The rooms were both spacious, modern and comfortable.  Whenever we needed anything such as additional wine glasses, the staff was prompt to respond and provide us with our request.  And the location of this hotel is perfect!  It’s right in the heart of La Rambla with bars, restaurants, shops and stores steps away.  Highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2018,12,25
37,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"Stayed here for four nights and had a great experience.  Staff are beyond friendly.  They let us check in at 830am, got us a bigger room for no charge (helpful for our 2 year old daughter), and sent us some Champaign and a gift for our daughter. Everyone we encountered was genuinely friendly and super welcoming to toddlers. 

As others have noted the breakfast is pretty good and free of charge for platinum guests. The hotel location really is good. You're walking distance to just about everything.   There is also a Carrefour supermarket around the corner. 

I'd come back in a second. Highly recommended.",5,2018,12,24
37,Stay here!!!,"Love this hotel, the location, staff, room and all the details make this hotel the best place to stay.  The lobby is large, functional and has a coffee/sandwich shop.  It's a great place to gather with large groups to plan your itinerary.  The room is clean, large and the bed is amazing.  The best part of our trip after a long day of sight seeing and walking is to come home to a comfortable room with a lovely bed.  A good night's rest is worth every penny and this hotel is the best.  My one complaint is the laundry service, my partner had his clothes laundered here and I wasn't impressed, the jeans he had cleaned were ruin, but because he had no choice wore them anyway; the jeans shrunk, and it was ironed which left zig zag marks permanently.",4,2018,12,20
37,Always the best.,"This has always been one of my favourite hotels, largely for the perfect location and the style. On this most recent trip, we were given such excellent service that I must write a comment. We had booked a suite on an upper floor, and due to some confusion, they were unable to make good on that. We were therefore upgraded two notches to an even better suite. During the stay, Bruno at the front desk, the ""second Bruno"" at the Concierge desk, and above all the Manager looked after every detail, which proved a lucky thing when Gatwick airport was closed because of a drone. Without missing a beat, they extended our stay. I don't often write reviews, but when I do, then of the Meridien Barcelona!",5,2018,12,20
37,Loved this Hotel Room!,"I want to recreate Le Meridien's room at home! They had amazing blackout curtains and was soundproofed so it was easy to sleep. The beds are incredibly comfortable -- if anyone knows where to buy their pillows online, let me know!",5,2018,12,13
37,Location in the heart of the action,"This was our 4th stay at this hotel. We love the property, and the location is so perfect to be able to walk right out onto La Rambla and super easy access to buses and subway. Renovations continue and the improvements are wonderful. The friendly concierge team has added Maria who is so fun and lovely!  It is such an honor to have upper management Montse and Ana come visit with us personally at breakfast--the personal touch is wonderful!  Hence why we keep coming back. this kind of friendliness and warmth is lacking in many hotels so we enjoy the consistency at Le Meridien Barcelona!",5,2018,12,12
37,Second time this year and renovations completed!,"Stayed here for the second time this year again! Great hotel, amazing service! The staff are brilliant. They also let me use the hotel safe to keep a valuable item which was so kind of them. 

As a PPE member - Instantly upgraded to a suite again - MASSIVE and really impressed my traveling companion. We even had a TV in the bathroom this time as the renovations seem to be fixed! Still got my 'Please Bear With Us' Teddy they left in my room from my last trip! 

Bottle of Red wine left in my room as a welcome gift was a lovely touch! 

The breakfasts are delicious and I must say we ordered room service, the restaurant brought up the best two of the best Filets we have ever eaten in a Hotel in my life! You could cut it with the back of a knife it was so tender! 

The staff are warm and welcoming and the La Rambla location probably is the best in the city! 

Thanks for a wonderful short trip and look forward to seeing you next year!",5,2018,12,12
37,"Great location, nice property","Decided to attend a conference at a last minute. Normally I would stay by the beach, but the city was really full. Le Meridien was a pleasant surprise. The location is great. You are just a block away from La Boqueria. The rooms are done up quite nicely, and they have manged to make them quite functional. I was on the second floor facing the side street and had no issues with noise during the night. The gym is reasonable and at least when I was there no one seem to be using it. The breakfast offered plenty of variety.",4,2018,12,10
37,Nice hotel in Las Ramblas area,We recently stayed here for our first 2 nights in Barcelona.  The front desk staff was great and we used an upgrade to a suite room.  Our room was nice and clean and had plenty of room.  The hotel is located in the busy La Rambla area of Barcelona and easy walking distance to most all the sights and numerous restaurants.  If your looking to stay in La Ramblas area then this is the property for you.,4,2018,12,09
37,Conferance and Vist,"Hotel location is very good, near to shopping malls , market,cathedral and bus station.
Good service, Rooms and bathroom facility is good,I feel room size is little small.but the service good and helpful staff.lot of souvener shops on the walk way near to hotel.",4,2018,12,09
37,"A beautiful, comfortable hotel at the heart of Barcelona","What I liked most in this hotel was the smell of sweet and elegant house perfume you notice as soon as you step in from the front gate, the full-size hair styler in the room (yay!!) in addition to the hair dryer, and the delicious coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice served at breakfast. One evening I found a cute teddy bear on the bed announcing the upcoming renovation work in the hotel, with a request to ‘bear’ with them during that time. Very sweet. I did not hear any disturbing noise throughout my stay though. There was free coffee/tea, an espresso machine and a water kettle in the room as well as iron and ironing table.
My room was on the first floor facing ‘La Rambla’ the famous stroll and shopping street in Barcelona. Although it was quite crowded and lively outside, I had no trouble sleeping at night thanks to the good window isolation and blackout curtains. The room and the bed were very comfortable and clean. There was a fitness room downstairs open 24 hrs. It had adequate equipment for a full workout and space big enough to accommodate several people at once. The breakfast room/restaurant was very wide, facing out on the street and had very good service staff. Breakfast was rich, delicious food with Spanish specialties. The restaurant was open for lunch and dinner also accommodating outside customers, although I did not try. Internet connection was available in several categories. The ‘conference’ connection was free and worked well most of the time, but it slowed down when 15-20 people connected at once.
The only drawback was air quality indoors. There was central air conditioning in good working order, but I guess it might be just recirculating the air inside. The air in my room felt humid and stuffy at times so I had to open the window 1-2 times a day for fresh air. Same with the meeting rooms after spending several hours inside. Also the ‘room service opt-out program’ did not have all its rules made clear from the beginning so it was not practical to use. It would be easier to go with the towel and bedsheet reuse options as in many other hotels.
Les Meridien Barcelona is a remarkable hotel and I will definitely consider staying here again. For value purposes it is not a budget hotel, my daily (group) rate ended up being 230 Euros on average including taxes. But it is worth staying here and enjoying great service, food and environments.",4,2018,12,08
37,Great location,"A well known brand with a well deserved reputation. Check in was unusually more pleasant than usual thanks to Bruno. And another Bruno at the concierge desk was also really very good. Room was nice, although not big. Bar and restaurant are fine. The location is perfect and walking distance to everything. We even took a cab to Güell park and walked back via the Plaza Kennedy and all the other buildings of Gaudi that we never get tired of seeing. ",5,2018,11,26
37,Good location but loud !,"The hotel is very well located, easy metro access, clean and spacious. We could hear the metro’s vibrations and the people in the streets below coming and going... a bit of a disappointment really for the price, maybe better windows could help ...",3,2018,11,21
37,Quality Service in La Rambla,"The Le Meridien, an SPG hotel, is centrally located on La Rambla.  It has exceptional staff - most speak fluent English and entertain the joy of teaching of Spanish to guests who seek to do so.

We arrived early in the morning although formal checkin is at 3 pm.  We were offered tickets to a nearby attraction and told that they would call our mobile once the room was ready.  We were halfway to the venue - less than 10 minutes - when we received a call saying we could move into our room. 

That is service - profound!

The room was comfortable and housekeeping was prompt and responsive to anything extra we needed.
Breakfast food and staff are superb.  The spread is fabulous with Spanish treats and specialities.  Dinner was also exceptional- the vegetable paella was divine, as was the chicken paella.

This is a venue that we needed for our first - but not last - trip to Barcelona.",5,2018,11,18
37,Great location,"We selected this hotel because of its convenient location to the Old City and Placa Catalunya. We were pleased to discover it is a five minute walk to the La Boqueria Market, a great source for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and people-watching.  The 111 Restaurant within the hotel also serves delicious meals. While the room we had was a bit small, the location and professional staff more than compensated for this small detail.",5,2018,11,15
37,First Rate Property,"Perfect location on Ramblas, upscale contemporary decor!  Can’t say enough about high customer service level communicating with Concierge making arrangements in advance of the trip from ground transfers to tour recommendations as well as advance tickets.  We arrived very early and our room was not yet ready so we checked our luggage with the bellman and head off to explore the city.  Returning back to the hotel after lunch, our room still was not ready and the front desk attendant got the manager who offered an upgrade to a suite at very reasonable rate.  We were celebrating a milestone anniversary, of course it was “absolutely”!  The suite was AMAZING!  A rooftop terrace with chaise lounges, outdoor shower, seating and umbrella for shade...my husband was so impressed with the bathroom (you could say that was a suite too)...every amenity!  And, the manager sent a bottle of wine sent to our room for the special occasion.  Restaurant across the street was fantastic.  Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the spa at the hotel.",5,2018,11,14
37,Spectacular location,"This is really a wonderful hotel located right on the Ramblas, the main road leading from Park Guel to the water.
Rooms are modern design but also comfortable and the staff is very accommodating.
It has two restaurants one quite a bit pricier than the bar/restaurant on the same floor as the reception desk 
Highly recommended",5,2018,11,13
37,Great Hotel,This is a wonderful hotel in a fabulous location. We stayed on the 5th floor and the room was spacious and very comfortable. Only had drinks in the bar so can’t comment on the food. Plenty of good eateries close by including Luzie right across the street.,5,2018,11,12
37,Great Hotel Downtown Barcelona ,Excellent location. On Ramblas pedestrian street. Good sized rooms. Great service throughout hotel. Great restaurant and extensive breakfast buffet too. Hard to beat for downtown hotel. Reasonable prices too. ,5,2018,11,10
37,Lovely hotel. Great location,We stayed at the Meriden for a long weekend. We had one of the newly refurbished deluxe rooms which was simply perfect. A great hotel in a great location and would highly recommend this for a weekend trip to this great city. The Concierge service was also brilliant.,5,2018,11,07
37,Great Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona...but,We spent one night at the Le Meridien (A Starwood Hotel) before our cruise the next day. The hotel is located right on the La Rambla strip which was perfect for touring around and watching people. The hotel itself is a bit dated and needs a renovation in its main lobby and in the rooms. Our room was clean and okay for what we needed it to be but the signs of wear and tear are there. The people working at reception and the bellmen were fantastic though. Big kudos to them! They were very helpful and professional. The reason I’m rating this as average is the run down feel and for the problem we experienced through the night. Our next door neighbor was having a bit of a “party” in his room with loud music and people coming and going. I had to call reception 3 times that night to get them to control the problem. Finally around 2 am reception brought up a security team and they escorted “the ladies” out. Needless to say I was thankful but I wish they had done it sooner.,3,2018,11,02
37,Amazing customer service - Ana Miquel rocks!  And amazing stay,"I love Barcelona and I love the central location of Le Meridien.  On my recent stay, there was a small hiccup in my first night.  Things happen.  Not a big deal.  The amazing thing was that when I reached out to Ana, she immediately corrected it and made the rest of my stay amazing!!  Such over the top professionalism and customer service.  Wow.  The front desk staff was also special.  It seemed that everyone knew me and was 100% committed to making sure that I had the best vacation ever.  I can’t wait to go back to this lovely hotel, this lovely city, this lovely staff and also, the best morning breakfast buffet ever.  Kudos to Ana and the team!",5,2018,11,02
37,A PERFECT STAY,"Our stay at the Hotel Meridian Barcelona was perfect and it was the people that work there who made it so. The check-in was flawless. They recognized my Starwood status and did everything they could to make me feel welcome. The front desk manager may be the best I have encountered in 20 years of staying at Starwood Properties. He greeted us personally and arranged a beautiful room for our stay. The bed was very good and the bathroom clean, supplied, and well appointed with mirrors, plugs, hairdryer, nice soaps, towels and robes.The concierge group was smart, friendly and very knowledgeable about local, close by restaurants and tourism possibilities available in the area. The housekeeping was impeccable and available 24 hours a day. The breakfast was really good and the coffee terrific, but, as I said, it was the people here who made the difference. They say it starts at the top and I am sure that the general manager of this hotel has modeled a standard of gracious, friendly, professional behavior that has filtered all the way down to the person who cleans the floors. I have never, as a hotel guest, encountered a crew of hotel workers who were this happy and glad to be at work. One woman in the restaurant, told us she had worked in this hotel for 20 years and the smile that she had when she delivered those words says everything you need to know about the Hotel Meridian Barcelona. Stay here. You will leave feeling like you have new friends in Barcelona.",5,2018,11,01
37,Definitely Location is Great! ,"Stayed for two days before beginning an extensive tour of Spain! Upgraded to a family suite (SPG Platinum recognised) which was fabulous even though I was on my own! Nice toiletries, complimentary bottle of Spanish red and huge storage areas! Location is the best and enjoyed the rooftop bar at the adjoining hotel! Would definitely stay here again! Helpful front desk too! ",4,2018,10,30
37,Excellent guest relations ,"Booked a five night stay using Marriott rewards points. I received a surprise bottle of wine in my room on the first night. During my stay, Ana from Guest Relations emailed me an invitation to a complimentary paella cooking demonstration as a perk for being a Platinum member. It was a fun event and I later received a paella pan and oven mitt as a gift. 

My room was on the smaller side on the 5th floor overlooking La Rambla. I felt it was very quiet and the street noise was barely noticeable. Breakfast options are largely the same each day but there is plenty to pick and choose from. Overall, glad we stayed here as the hotel location can’t be beat!",5,2018,10,26
37,Great location,"We were 3 travelers who had a Junior Suite. The staff was very accommodating and the location could not have been better, we were able to get around the city and see the sites. The bathroom was great and the beds were comfortable however the newly renovated rooms did not allow for 3 people and their suitcases, nothing in the bedroom but the bed and 2 small nightstands, we pretty much lived out of our suitcases on the floor. A chair or dresser of some sort would have been accommodating for the 6 nights we stayed.",3,2018,10,26
37,"Great Location, but unremarkable",There's nothing wrong with this hotel.  It's on La Rambla and a great location but pretty much just like any other chain hotel.  We had our welcome dinner here from our tour and it was fine again nothing special.,4,2018,10,21
37,Underwhelming ,"This is my 7th night & 2 more to go. 
I’m writing this because the breakfast buffet didn’t change at all. 
The only one dish they rotate will be either the beans or pasta. 

Concierge , they will fold their arms and not help you with the door. When I arrive, no one at the front , so I have to drag my luggage up the few steps of stair. 

We paying 500€ each night for the junior suite. The suite is not even well lid, no separate bedroom and living area. Being platinum member, no upgrade. And they say because I’m staying for 9 nights, they cannot commit to any upgrade. It got me thinking if it pays off being loyal? €500x9 nights?! 
No club lounge, no nothing. 

Housekeeping - very inconsistent cause the person who refuel the bottle of water is not the housekeeper. But their speed of in room service is very prompt, thumbs up! 

The only thing about this place is that the location is right on la ramblas. 

Nah, I will never come back. Never. ",2,2018,10,21
37,A wonderful experience --great location,"This location can't be beat.  It was convenient to all major attractions as well as into the little neighborhoods nearby.  

Long before we got Barcelona, Maria Bru, consierge, was a huge help.  Our trip to Spain was to celebrate my 60th birthday and that day was the precise day (5 October) we arrived at Le Meredian.  About three months earlier, Maria and I exchanged many emails regarding restaurants in Barcelona where my husband and I would celebrate my birthday.  Maria was so helpful, giving me the names of places to investigate and then making a reservation at El Cangrejo Loco in Port Olympic.  The restaurant was wonderful and the evening was memorable.  Throughout our visit, Maria was always available for recommendations, directions and reservations.

Upon our arrival, Pietro at the front desk was so sweet.  He checked us in quickly and efficiently, wished me a happy birthday and explained the neighborhood.  The bellman that brought up our luggage was also quick and efficient and gave us lots of tips as to how to use the electricity in the room as well as warnings about pick pockets. Fortunately, no one tried to pick our pockets!  When we got back to our room, we were welcomed to a bottle of champagne as well as a bottle of wine and fruit with a lovely note from Pietro.  My birthday got more and more special.

Breakfast was spectacular!  Having breakfast included with our room was so convenient and so delicious.  It was a pleasure to come downstairs and have a sumptuous  selection of food as well as extraordinarily fantastic coffee.  The waitstaff was always available to make our breakfast a delight.  Overall, we were treated like royalty at Le Mereidan.  

Our room was quiet and fully equipped. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. 
 Two things that would have improved the room would be to have electrical outlets next to the bed and more of a selection of English speaking television, specifically entertainment, not just news.  Thank you so much for affording us a wonderfully memorable stay in Barcelona.",5,2018,10,19
37,Central Location,"The hotel is near to everything; shopping, dining (have nearby Halal Restaurant) & tourist attraction. However, driving to this hotel is a bit confusing. I missed the final turn because Waze didn’t telling me to turn left when arrived at the final junction. I had to make another round through a narrow street with lots of people during the rush hour. 

I didn’t notice the parking sign further down the street, so I just parked in front of the hotel. Luckily for Platinum Member, they gave me a complimentary Valet parking. The staff is very accommodating & helpful. I find the room quite spacious. Yes, there are some noise but I find it acceptable. It didn’t affect our sleep that night. 

There were some hiccups during our stay, where the access card was not working. They have to escort every hotel guests to their room. It quite hassle for us to go in & out of the hotel. But it is not their fault at all. I was made to understand it has something to do with their system migration for Marriott-SPG merger thing.

Overall, love this hotel. 

And will come back soon.",5,2018,10,15
37,Love this Hotel!,Great location and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  The room was really nice with many amenities.  The breakfast buffet was also a great way to start our day.  The concierge recommended a few tours and they were great!  We really enjoyed our stay.,5,2018,10,13
37,nice hotel in a good location,"Stayed one night. Enjoyed the hotel. Nice room, larger than standard Euro room. Well fitted out with amenities. Hotel staff was responsive, friendly and helpful planning destinations. Close to the market and a short walk to the waterfront. ",5,2018,10,12
37,Best Location!,"I recently stayed at the Le Meridien during a 5-day stay in Barcelona. 

HOTEL ROOM: We had a 2-room suite on the 4th floor. The two-room suite had a sofa pullout queen size bed in one room and a king sized bed in the bedroom with a swinging door between them. This was great as my travel partner snores extraordinarily loud. Though the room was a suite, it was on the smaller side which is fairly status quo for European hotels.

LOUNGE: The bar has a comprehensive selection with friendly bartenders. In addition to being bilingual (Jacqueline), she was very friendly, professional, and insisted on bringing the drinks to our table (vs. standing at the bar waiting to carry them myself). 

HOTEL STAFF: The front desk staff was extremely polite and incredibly helpful. When using the designated Gold/Platinum line the staff was very prompt to address my needs.

RESTAURANT: As an SPG/Marriott Platinum Elite member, daily breakfast was included at no charge. The breakfast spread was quite impressive and included an omelet/fresh egg bar, eggs, sausages, bacon, croissants, pretzels, deli meats, large cheese plate selection, multiple juice selections, and coffee, cappuccino, espresso options. 

LOYALTY STATUS RECOGNITION: (SPG / Marriott Platinum Elite)
     - Upgraded to a 2 room suite on Club floor

Sadly no rooftop bar or service on the balcony . 
Room is nice and clean . 
",4,2018,10,02
37,Highly recommend,"I am ""Platinum Elite"" and this hotel not only had our room ready at 9am, but we got a nice upgrade to a Junior Suite. The room was large, nice view, very comfortable.  The breakfast was great.  We walked everywhere from the central location.  We experienced excellent service and would stay here again.  Thanks for a great stay!",5,2018,10,01
37,Excellent Location,"On the main road, La Rambia.  Concierge was great in providing walking directions and especially making dinner reservations at Gaig and at Sensi Tapas.  Walking distance to Casa Batillo, the Arc di Triumph and S'Grada Familia.",5,2018,10,01
37,Overall a fine stay.,"We arranged for an airport pickup (95 euros). The price was a bit on the high side, but the driver was waiting for us and I like to get to my room asap when i arrive in a city.
There was no upgrade available when we arrived and the room we were given was very small on the 2nd floor with a few of a demolished back yard. The smell in the room was actually also bad if you did not use the AC. The next day they called me to offer us a new room, a suite on the 6th floor facing the street had become available. Since we had 2 more nights to go, we decided to move. It was not a renovated room but it was much more comfortable. The staff was very friendly and especially the concierge. Very helpful.
As i am Platinum, we had breakfast included. Unfortunately there is not much for vegans other than some fresh fruits and raw vegetables. They do have soy milk option for the coffee.",3,2018,09,29
37,A fantastic hotel just off La Rambla ,"This was our last use of Starwood’s rewards now that they have been destroyed by Marriott. Fantastic hotel with the perfect location in Barcelona. Walking distance to almost every great site and right off The famous La Rambla. Our room was perfect. Best of all was Diego, one of the concierges. Unbelievably helpful and honest. ",5,2018,09,26
37,Wonderful Staff and Location,"We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to be in 5-30 minutes. Staff went out of their way to provide outstanding service. Over and over again! We were in a junior suite (917) which was quiet (yeah!) Some areas of hotel are awaiting an upgrade such as 6th floor patio. My husband said the spa service was NOT in any way special/luxurious, so maybe pick up spa services elsewhere if needed. Our favorite food experiences were at ElDiset, Teoric Taverna and view from Martinez, also churros 10 minutes from hotel at Churreria Laietana and gelato from Gelaaati di Marco.",4,2018,09,12
37,"Staff great, the renovations need another quality check","So I loved that this hotel made my little one feel so welcomed by the check in they specially have for kids - the staff is awesome.  The room overall was nice, we had a renovated room however I find sometimes when hotels do renovations, they side step on some things, cut corners, and leave some details unattended to.  So while the room is a great sized room, right off La Ramblas so location is perfect, there were a few minor imperfections with the renovation that were done to our room.  The bathroom door was glass and it didn't have the protective edges, so my daughter cut her foot on it.  Also I'll show some images of the doorway, it looks like it wasn't paid attention to and the wood was fraying, there was also a nail sticking out of the doorway that any one of us could've gotten hurt on or snagged our clothes on, my husband pulled it out so there were no other injuries.  Overall, I'd stay here again.",4,2018,09,11
37,"Superb hotel, excellemt location","Stayed there for a business conference (2.5 days), in April 2018. Hotel is just off La Ramblas, but nevertheless very quiet. Excellent food and service. Wifi is good - a must these days. Very nice buffet for breakast - fresh fuit and pastries.
 Highly recommended for business or family travel.",5,2018,09,09
37,location,"location location location ,room not to big we had the first floor , breakfast was good  staff at reception where very helpful  and they know  recommendation places 
the spa was  good with the steam  and the jacuzzi and sauna",4,2018,09,08
37,Even better than our last trip (didn't think that was possible)!,"We had stayed at this hotel in 2015 and it exceeded my expectations at that time (see my previous review), so when we decided to come back to Barcelona this time around, it was a no-brainer that we would choose Le Meridien again. 

Check in: We arrived quite early and we were checked in by Miguel who was interning at the Le Meridien from Portugal. We was so incredibly friendly and and professional. Thankfully our room was ready and he let us know if we needed anything we could call down.

Room: We had a junior suite on the 7th floor which was very spacious. It wasn't one of the newly renovated rooms, but was very clean. The size of the room was very spacious. There was a separate changing area and the bathroom was also quite spacious. I loved the fact that they also provided a hair straightener along with the hair dryer. The toiletries were also quite large and plentiful. 

Restaurants/bars/room service: We frequented the buffet for breakfast and also the le pop bar for our evening drinks before heading out of the hotel. Service in both were excellent and they are adjoining. Our favorite drinks at the bar were the candy crush and the fairy forest. We ordered room service one night and we liked the fact that everything was reasonably priced and delivered quite promptly. 

Spa: We both had massages and then afterward, spent time in the sauna and jacuzzi area. It was a quiet and relaxing time. 

Service: This is where the hotel really shines. I can't get over how nice and friendly everyone is at the hotel. We were always being greeted or had a staff member making small talk with us. I loved how comfortable everyone who worked at this hotel made us feel. It made our stay so memorable, just like the last time. 

Overall, if you're thinking about this hotel, I recommending booking it. It's one of my favorite hotels in the world and we will definitely be back on a future trip to Barcelona. A huge thank you to the staff at Le Meridien for making us feel so welcome!",5,2018,09,06
37,I. Loved. This. Hotel. ,"The staff is excellent. So kind and patient and friendly and completely helpful. The room, while small, is perfectly appointed. The mattress and pillows are so good I want to take them home.  Location is central to everything. You can’t go wrong staying here  ",5,2018,09,04
37,Convenient hotel waking distance,Enjoyed stay. Nice accommodation breakfast buffet restaurant and bar. First night enjoyed tapas in bar. Good food and excellent service. Busy part of town but a block off main walking area. Convenient.,4,2018,09,03
37,Dark rooms,I can never figure out why hotels like this don’t provide adequate lighting. This is a huge deficiency. Also need more plugs at proper level (ones near beds are at floor level and require unplugging the already scant lights).  Neighborhood is ok but be careful. Restaurant very good and breakfast good. ,3,2018,08,29
37,Not a 5 star hotel!,Our room was drab dated and smelly! The service was not great and they didn't make you feel welcome. The hallways all smelled musty and damp. The location was great but the hotel a big let down. They did not provide much in the way of information and  a lot of the staff don't speak English,1,2018,08,27
37,Wonderful 3-Day Visit,"We stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for 3 days, August 19-22, 2018.  Our room was spotless, enormous, and clean.  The entire staff was totally professional, and the restaurant on premises served excellent food.  The location is perfect in relation to Las Ramblas.  We were extremely happy!",5,2018,08,26
37,More than just a great location…,"As many reviewers have noted, the location simply can’t be beat (just off Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona). The MACBA, Boqueria Market, art galleries, restaurants and the Gothic Quarter are all right outside the hotel door. Rooms in this property have all been renovated -- AC is excellent (which is important for us since we’re always visiting Barcelona in the summer), the bed incredibly comfortable, a fabulous shower, and amenities are outstanding. 

But what really makes this property special is a warm, professional and courteous staff that always goes the extra mile to make our stay in Barcelona as enjoyable as possible. This is our fourth stay at the Le Meridien in as many years, and once again, the hotel delivered a home run experience (a special thanks to the Duty Manager, Salvador Batlle, for providing a wonderful room upgrade overlooking Las Ramblas).  The bellmen, front desk staff, and housekeeping are all top-notch, and responsive to our every need. We recommend this property enthusiastically and without reservation, and look forward to returning next year!",5,2018,08,23
37,"Great Location, Friendly Staff",Ideally located right next to Plaza Catalunya on La Rambla. Several BCN sights accessible by a short walk. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. We were in a family suite with a terrace. Room was spacious and amazing! Nice breakfast spread included in our package.,5,2018,08,23
37,Descent ,"Great location, opening onto the ramblas. Typical meridian, small rooms, simple and basic. Had trouble in checking Inn early after a long flight in spite of being spg gold. The supervisor was very helpful and sorted thing out. A number of resteraunts  close by.",3,2018,08,12
37,"Location, location, location ....","Situated right at the Ramblas, what else could one ask for?

The hotel itself is sited in an inconspicuous building in the very centre of the old Barcelona with tons of shopping, local eateries and a super-market at the door-step. The port of Barcelona is also within wlaking distance. But, beware, as our hire car driver set the GPS to the address on La Ramblas, we were dropped off there instead of the side street where the main entrance is.

The reception, though small, gives one a most welcoming and friendly feel, without any tourist groups.  Though the formalities of checking-in took a little longer than anticipated, the staff members were most courteous, apologetic and full of smiles throughout.

The room we had was rather small and the view was non-existent but given the location, it was not a big issue as the rooms overlooking La Ramblas must have been very noisy.  

All the essential items were there in the room and bathroom.  Worthy of mention is the softness of the pillows and the bed which were too soft to our liking.  

Another issue was the fridge, which was linked to the accounting system of the room.  Any tiny movement of its contents would trigger a registration of the item(s) on the room's account sheet.  Given the proximity to a supermarket, the available space in the fridge for storing items like bottled water, soft drinks or fruits was manifestly inadequate (especially for this summer in Europe).

Given the shortfalls of our room, would I still return?  A most definite yes!",4,2018,08,08
37,Ideal location,"Stood here for 7 nights in July. Ideal location for tourist, it is right in the middle of most attractions. Hotel staff was very professional, the hotel itself and our room was very modern. The only negative thing is that the hotel is located on the Ramblas street, which is always packed with people   at all times, there was a lot of noise outside up to 5 in the morning. If you can deal with the noise, you won't have any complaints. ",4,2018,08,06
37,Value for money,"Had a great stay with my wife. Excellent location in tje middle of Barcelona lively places. Room was in a great condition , spacious and very good housekeeping. Room on the main road mightbe abit noisy till early morning with partying people. Front desk staff are profissional while concierge can be mire efficient. Overall it is a highly recommended hotel to stay in .",5,2018,08,06
37,Good place right in the ramblas,"First time to this hotel in Barcelona, I am a SPG platinum memberm I had a Junior Suite with private terrace and separated living room and room. The hotel is right in the ramblas which in fact is not a great location, I mean is not a luxury location although a central location and very touristic. The hotel itself looks a bit tired, the foyer and entrance is nothing impressive but the service at the reception is top, the people working at the Hoel are the best assist.
My room even when once is not what you'd say a top luxury place but good ... bed is big and ok fiurtnitre nothing special...
Breakfast has many choices and the ambiance is nice and again their staff very nice.",4,2018,08,06
37,Fabulous food and service,"The restaurant - called CentOnze or 111 - is inside the hotel facing La Rambla. The food, service and wines were great and the price for a lovely 3 course meal with a wine recommended by the restaurant manager was very reasonable for such a high standard. Would definitely return for a special occasion meal.",5,2018,08,04
37,Great Location on Las Ramblas,"Stayed for four nights after sailing on a cruise. Location was great with few meters from Las Ramblas and 5 minuets walk to Placa de Catalunya !

The room was very nice, staff was friendly and helpful by all means.",5,2018,08,04
37,Comfortable hotel in a great location,"This hotel is very centrally located and easily accessible to/from public transportation, which I much appreciated given that I was in Barcelona during the taxi strike. The hotel staff were very helpful in terms of providing assistance and directions with public transit routes. The bed and room were very comfortable, and I heard very little noise from the street given the sound-proofed windows. The hotel architecture is pretty standard, but location really gives you access to all that Barcelona has to offer.",5,2018,08,02
37,Practical & professional hotel but policies can be revised,"The other hotel where we have picked to stay in Barcelona. We have split the stay so we checked in day 1, day 2 out of town and re-checked in again to the same hotel for day 3.

Location - Excellent. It's 2-3 minutes walk to Mercat la boqueria. 

Room #1 Deluxe King

The room was okay, just standard hotel rooms, quite spacious I thought. The only thing that wasn't good was the toilet - the door was not functioning properly, it has some loud click every single time I open/close it. It was quite loud it is actually quite scary because I thought the door may fall anytime soon. We reported this at point of check out and reception took note of it (It was a room on the 5th floor but I forgot the number).  Apparently nobody had made this remark so they haven't got enough info to fix it. Hopefully it's fixed now..

Because we were going out of town for a night and will re-check in again the next day, we requested for our luggages to be stored in the hotel and move it into the room the next day. The hotel said strictly no overnight luggage due to the bombing incident. However, I understand the need for the policy but this could be revised. I mean, your guests have stayed a night and have already prepaid for the next night, so why not allow this simple request? You can always have some device to scan the bags first just if you want to “buy an insurance”. I'm sure the hotel is able to check the background/history of their guest (where I am a SPG member so my history is visible to them?). I don't know, I just felt that the policy could be revised to accommodate genuine guests. We were offered (a) hotel services to move our luggage to wherever + luggage storage fee; (b) to walk to the nearest storage. Honestly very inconvenient because we are already checking in the next day... Wasted so much time here.... The only reason I picked Le Meridien again is because of the convenience but it wasn’t that convenient afterall. 

Room #2 Deluxe King - Upgraded to Premium Deluxe Twin

Also, because of the inconvenience and the front desk staff felt really bad for us, he moved our room from deluxe to premium deluxe as a form of apology due to the strict policies. We were happy with the room as it was newly refurbished with the exception that we were given twin beds instead of king. We did not go down to change it because it was only a night and it was just too much trouble. I was pleasantly surprised by the curler in the room - it is absolutely useful!!! I hope every hotel I go to provides this too but they don't so, this is seriously a very high plus point!!

Concierge staffs:
Bruno was very helpful with the exchange of emails for my reservations request. One thing to note about the concierge - there should always be a back up staff if one guest hogs the concierge staff for too long. I stood there for close to 10 minutes because one person sat there asking 101 questions (with maps and all) when I just wanted to ask a quick one. Twice that it happened that people were asking tonnes of questions and hogging a staff but nothing we can do except waiting and hoping for staff number 2 to appear.

Conclusion:
In comparison with W where we have stayed earlier, the rooms were certainly not as beautiful/modern nor the view was as great as W’s. However, Le Meridien offers practical rooms and I got good sleep quality here, I did not have issues with noise and that is certainly WAY more important than beautiful bedroom/view. Also, the front desk staffs were a lot more professional in handling matters and I would definitely pick Le Meridien anytime over W - it is practical, professional and suitable for business. I also like the fact that they have security guards guarding the place 24/7 and they lock the main entrance after certain hours for security purposes. Again, in comparison, because W is a party place, anyone is free to walk in so security is not as good.

Other info: 
They offer free Casa Batllo tickets to guests too but we did not have enough time to see so we dropped the item of getting the tickets from the concierge. ",5,2018,07,23
37,"Meh, expect more for the price","Best feature of Le Meridien is the location. Right off la Rambla, it is central to everything this great city has to offer. That said, the room was average at best to us. About 18 inches from the foot of the bed to fixed bench on the wall made it feel very cramped. There was only one accent chair to sit on so someone always had to sit on the bed. And the bathroom was spacious but the tub had insanely high walls that created safety challenges stepping over. 

Worst was the service of one front desk member at check in. He went out of his way to explain all the benefits my wife would not receive as this was a free stay from redeemed loyalty points. While a call to management quickly resulted in an apology and complimentary room gift, it should never of happened. 

To the hotel’s credit, other staff were helpful and polite, but the initial experience plus cramped room made Le Meridien plus price point makes me recommend you look elsewhere",2,2018,07,22
37,Very Nice Hotel and Staff,"Hotel is in a great location, be sure to get a room on the side to avoid the street noise
Great Breakfast, Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Concierge service was very informative and can make arrangments for you as needed,",5,2018,07,22
37,Vacation,"First off Barcelona is a must visit city. My daughter and I checked into the Le Meridian Barcelona and was fell atotally in love with the hotel.
Our room was absolutely beautiful spacious and clean.....the bed was so comfy. The view was magnificent. We had a nice balcony to sit and enjoy a lovely bottle of wine
at night. The staff was top notch. Smiling welcoming happy people. I met Ana Miquel De LA Llave and her team who gave exceptional service....going above and beyond....providing information on where all the hot spot are in Barcelona and all the services the hotel had to offer. I give Her 10 plus and the hotel. I highly recommend this. ",5,2018,07,20
37,Amazing staff and service,"We stayed here for a week in June and were so happy. The staff was amazing, always ready to help out and offer their services. They were friendly and accommodating. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower heavenly. The spot of the hotel is excellent, so near everything you want to see and the metro too. Our room was quiet and we slept well.",5,2018,07,19
37,Great location and friendly staff!,"We visited Barcelona as a family trip. We loved the proximity of this hotel for sightseeing, nice restaurants that are nearby and very accommodating staff! Rooms were good because there was 6 of us and we could fit 3 people per room, so we only had to book 2 rooms versus 3! Would stay here again.",5,2018,07,16
37,Great Location downtown Lawrence,"Only one block of the Ramblas, so location is fantastic. Our room had recently been redone so was crisp and new. Though overlooking the street was quiet. Attached restaurant while cordial and efficient service was just average food. Desk staff very friendly and helpful.",4,2018,07,16
37,Bad food," On my last night i have ordered pizza in room dinning, i don't know how to describe it since it's not pizza , i have informed the receiption and there was no action from their side only they are sorry and you have to pay 13 euros. Unfortunately i left the hotel very disappointed.",2,2018,07,16
37,Great location and superb staff!,"We've stayed in hotels all over the world and we truly enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien Barcelona. Yes, it's steps from Las Ramblas (which some would say is like staying in Times Square crossed with New Orleans on Spring Break) but  our room faced away from the main street and was quiet and lovely. The room was what I expect at a good hotel —good bed with an excellent mattress, a fabulous dual walk in shower, all the necessary amenities — and was well decorated in a modern style. What makes Le Meridien a top notch hotel, however, is it's completely professional, amazing staff. They are wonderful. They concierge staff helped us many times with reservations to restaurants, tips on the best tours, etc. Wonderfully impressed. We had a package deal through American Express Travel which included airfare and hotel, and while we were offered other more ""trendy"" hotels, I'm glad we stayed here. Steps from the Gothic quarter, the ocean, la Boqueria Market (go!) It was just the right place. Very happy.",4,2018,07,15
37,Great night stay before our cruise,We stayed at the Le Meridien the night before we boarded for our cruise.  The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful with the 4 rooms we needed for our family of 11.  The rooms were very clean and well appointed.  The location was wonderful as we were able to walk around and get food the afternoon we arrived.,5,2018,07,13
37,"Fantastic location, breakfast, rooms, excellent staff ","We enjoyed our stay. Diego the concierge was especially helpful. His English is perfect. We bought breakfast when we booked the hotel and it was excellent. The breakfast is open from 7 to 11 so we always were able to make our way to the cafe.  
Love the hotel.  ",5,2018,07,13
37,Frrst day of Our holiday,"Arrived after very long flight from Australia for one nights stay before boarding a boat for our cruise. 
Staff at reception were very welcoming and we're able to let us into to our room in the morning. 
Person that showed us to room, very helpful advising us on everything we needed to know.
We had evening meal  and breakfast there, both were excellent. 
Hotel in great location.",5,2018,07,12
37,My favorite hotel and city.,"The location is great, on the La Rambla. I had a view of the vendors and activity. My room was well appointed and roomy. The bed was so comfortable I had no problem sleeping. The deep soaking tub and multiple showers were very pleasant. The lobby/reception was well furnished and a comfortable place to wait. The staff were all very helpful. I had a dental emergency and the front desk staff made an appointment for me and saved my vacation, wish I got her name. The cooking demonstration, which Anna Miguel invited my daughter and I to attend, was very enjoyable. Watching The Men’s World Cup in Le Pop was very nice, good drinks, food and football fans. I had no complaints and warm memories from my visit. The fruit plates left in my room were yummy. Thank you.",5,2018,07,10
37,First day of our Mediterranean cruise,After a long flight from Australia we arrived in Barcelona.The reception staff at the Sheraton la Rumbella were great booking us in and getting our bags to the room. We stayed for 3 nights with a very good room.The breakfast each day. was good with a selections of fresh or cooked foods.Our room was on the quieter side street a blessing at night so no noise from the main La Rumbler pedistran main Street..all all in all a great location to see Barcelona close to all transport and night life,4,2018,07,10
37,Loved our stay here,"This hotel is located on the Ramblas - step out the door and enjoy lots of shopping or just a delicious gelato cup/cone. Just a couple blocks away you can buy your hop on/hop off tickets to the Red/Blue/Green lines and enjoy the easiest way to see Barcelona. The hotel is lovely. The rooms are very nice and the staff is most accommodating. They have a great concierge service. We bought our tickets thru them for a lovely day at Montserrat, then walked about 3 blocks to the Travel Agency to connect with the tour group. Hotel has a great buffet breakfast with an omelet station and delicious breads and pastries. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,09
37,Best location + best service + comfortable room,"This is the 4th time staying at Le Meridien because the hotel is in the best location where we can go to places within walking distance. We stayed at a newly renovated room, simple, modern, bright and comfortable. The bathroom is quite spacious and the amenities are good. Besides from hair dryer, there is also a hair curler/straightener, which is a necessity for the nowadays ladies. The housekeeping staff did a good job to keep the room clean, the front desk staff are friendly and the concierge staff are helpful.",5,2018,07,07
37,"Comfortable hotel, great location","My wife and I stayed at this hotel for five nights in June.  As a platinum guest, I found the check-in process to be excellent.  While our room wasn't ready when we arrived (we were early), the hotel staff did everything they could to make us feel very welcomed.  The room was very nice, with seating area separate from the bedroom, and large windows letting in plentiful natural light.  

Perhaps one of the best features of the hotel is its location.  Central on La Rambla, it made much of the city walkable, with several public transport options very close-by.  I would recommend this hotel to my friends, and would be happy to stay there again myself.",4,2018,07,05
37,excellent accomodations with a staff that goes out of it's way to make your stay confortable.,"Assistant Manager Salvadore and the rest of the Le Meridien staff really extended themselves in making our family's stay comfortable and rewarding.  Their friendly and efficient service made it much easier for the six of us to see and do the things we planned.  The concierge, Bruno, successfully followed up on misplaced luggage from our Iberia flight and helped with directions and attraction advice.  The front desk staff and housekeeping were friendly and efficient.  We enjoyed  the food and drinks in the restaurant and bar.  One of the keys for our selecting the LeMeridien ws its location and we were not disappointed.  Nest time we are in Barcelona we will stay at the Le Meridien.",5,2018,07,04
37,"Great location, Great service, Great stay",Wonderful Starwood hotel perfect if you are in Barcelona for 1-2 days.  Walkable to and from so many attractions.  It has the character of an old Spanish building coupled with clean and modern design elements.  ,4,2018,07,03
37,Great location,This was a welcoming and comfortable hotel just steps off of Las Ramblas.   We found it easy and safe to walk around both day and evening.  The beds were very comfortable.  Only hotel we stayed at that actually separated the twin beds vs pushing together to make king size.  Staff was very helpful.  We did not eat on site because there are so many choices just steps away.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2018,07,02
37,"Great location, greater staff!","Just off La Rambla the Meridien is tucked away in a quiet street. What a great place! Front desk staff is very friendly, taking all the time to explain things. Also special credit to the breakfast host and hostess. They truly are great and deserve to be recognized. The breakfast restaurant is not particularly big, however extremely well managed. At the same time the hotel does cater to groups of elderly American cruisers but the good thing is when you are in the beautifully addressed room you really feel you are in Catalonia rather than California! :) Overall a very pretty and luxurious place where the staff makes it even more pretty! We will be back..!",5,2018,06,30
37,most beautiful luxurious experience,"I've stayed here for 2 nights and it was the most relaxing beautiful experience.

All strong points: Great pool, beautiful scenery, hotel is exactly on top of beach. Great food. 

We had a few workshops in the hotel; and it was fully equipped to handle hundreds of people and all ran very smoothly",5,2018,06,30
37,"Location, location, location!","Stayed here as part of a Tauck tour.  Great location on La Rambla pedestrian thoroughfare.  Easy access to Gothic quarter and waterfront as well as metro.  We arrived before check-in so our designated room was not ready yet.  Reception told us we could have an upgrade to room that had recently been renovated.  She said an extra 14 euros.. but when we got our bill it was 40 more.  Poor English accent... The room (410) and bathroom were new and very modern.  I had hoped for more Old World charm, but it was very nice.  Group dinner was nice, but noisy.",4,2018,06,29
37,Wonderful location and superb service,"This is really a terrific place to stay in Barcelona. It’s right on La Rambla and all its exciting busy-ness and great people watching (just watch out for pickpockets). We were there for the nights of June 7, 8, and 9, 2018 after taking the train down from Nîmes, France after our river cruise was over. The hotel staff is spot on fantastic in all regards. Very good concierge services. Easy to get a taxi right out front. We needed a taxi for five of us on a few occasions and one was always available - important because most taxis hold only three for four people. Rooms were large with lots of storage. Bathroom was quite large. Our daily housekeeping was very quick and topnotch. There’s a good cocktail bar onsite called Le Pop which made up very acceptable martinis and has good wines by the glass. There are some very nice tapas places at which to dine just steps from the hotel in a little square across the street. Although this is really a four-star hotel I’m giving it a 5.0 here because our experience was so good.",5,2018,06,27
37,"Great Location!, Older Rooms :( ","I love Barcelona and it’s one of my favorite cities.  The LE MÉRIDIEN is in a fabulous location and you can walk for hours from there.  The hotel staff is really great, the coffee bar and attendant are fantastic. 

The room was small, smelly and very outdated.  I would not say it’s a great spot to spend more than an overnight. 

The room service was adequate, although I will say the Ice cream was a delight. 

Overall, this is a great spot to stop for an overnight or 2.  ",3,2018,06,27
37,"Decent hotel, but a little bland","Stayed in room 320 (king bed) for three nights in mid-June 2018 as part of a week-long tour of Spain with the travel company Tauck (who chose and booked the hotel for us).

Great location right off the Ramblas and within easy walking distance of the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona.  

This hotel is ok.  There's nothing really wrong with it but there's also nothing that makes it stand out.  Just a bland chain hotel that could be anywhere.  The staff were friendly and courteous but often seemed a little clueless when asked anything beyond basic questions.  Maybe it was just a language barrier.     

The room itself was quiet and comfortable.  Lots of TV channels with several English-language stations.

Breakfast was the typical buffet.  We had one dinner in the restaurant as part of the tour and it was sub-par.

All in all, a decent hotel.  We stayed at Hotel 1898 across the street as independent travelers back in March 2018 and liked it much better as it had more character and equally friendly but more proficient staff.",3,2018,06,26
37,excellent view but small room,"we booked a junior suite with an extra bed , the extra bed was right in front of the master bed , its really hard to judge the room layout with the photo shoped picture , sometimes they post on website , the website should post a layout also along with pictures ,they should put ok for 3 adults just on the basis of area ,  the shower area is really small , its hard to miss , your elbow hitting the walls , we were in the top floor with an reaaly excellent view and yes the breakfast was also good",3,2018,06,25
37,Fantastic stay,"We loved this Hotel. The staff were really nice and friendly and our upgraded room was amazing. They looked after us as SPG members very well. This seems like a really well managed hotel with the front desk staff over our two days exceptionally professional.
We will definitely be back,this position was terrific.",5,2018,06,23
37,Great Location,"Wonderful and helpful Manager and staff. Always greeting with a smile. Location is easy access to pretty much everything...shopping, restaurants, shows, historical places. We had a great time in our visit to Barcelona especially the Sagrada La Familia.",5,2018,06,20
37,Excellent Stay!,My son and I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona and had a wonderful experience.  The location was fantastic and we had a room on the second floor with a small balcony.  Fabulous for people watching!  The staff was very helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed the property and our time at this wonderful hotel.,5,2018,06,19
37,This is the ONLY hotel I’ll stay at in Barcelona,"My story is rather unusual. I came to Barcelona three times, in March 2018, April, and again in May. I probably spent a total of about thirty days in Barcelona because my older brother became very ill on vacation in Barcelona and ended up in a coma in a hospital there. For nearly three months!!!!! So I was not a tourist. The staff of the Meridien made a horrible situation much more bearable. Specifically, the concierge staff, the breakfast room staff, and Ana who is a force of nature. Thank you to them all!",5,2018,06,19
37,"Great location, wonderful rooms, helpful service.","We stayed only for 2 nights, but because of the central location we were able to access and see tons of Barcelona. We took a Tapas and WIne Tour on night. Then the next day a bike tour. Great selections of outdoor cafes just across the street.",5,2018,06,19
37,Barcelona activity center hotel,"Better than average hotel, close to fun. I had thought of this group with the high flyers, but it is much more a Sheraton style than St. Regis! Rooms are small, but well appointed with fridge, flat screen,desk, and shower, and ample lights. Missing electric plugs near the bed are rough if you use a CPAP or enjoy white noise. Staff is very accommodating if needed, and I did X3 for,problems this stay (which were quickly resolved). Great breakfast buffets, excellent location, good work out facilities, meeting places and restaurant and bar on site, but it’s proximity to the Rambla and it’s connection to the personality of Barcelona make this a good choice for visitors. Ask for a view because many rooms, (like ours) miss out.",4,2018,06,18
37,5 Star but not spacious like Asian Standards,"The Le Meridien is quite centrally located and in an area where there are a lot of restaurants and close access to city tour buses. The hotel has all modern amenities in the room, but for someone traveling from Asia and having stayed in hotels in India, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan the rooms can be quite small with hardly any room to move around.",3,2018,06,17
37,Pre/Post cruise visit,"We stayed one day before our cruise and 3 days after. Because we were flying in early morning, we paid for early check-in and our room was ready when we arrived. Bruno was extremely helpful that morning and throughout our stay. There was no problem communicating in English with the staff. Reasons we found this an excellent hotel: location, staff, clean large rooms, breakfast, wifi and oh did I mention staff; doormen, concierge, front desk, and cafe! ",5,2018,06,06
37,Short visit before cruise,"This was such a nice hotel!  Great location to everything, metro, shopping, dining, Las Ramblas.  Surprisingly quiet rooms despite the location.  Spectacular caring staff, Bruno in concierge was very helpful as was the front desk.  Very easy access to the port.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,05
37,Experience Las Ramblas,"First off - the location of this property is amazing! It is such a treat to walk out and into the hustle and bustle of activity happening in this area of Barcelona! 

We arrived very late (due to a major airline delay) and despite the fact that it was 2 am the staff were friendly, welcoming and professional. We were even still able to order room service (yay!)

Because this is a hotel in the center of a very active city, do not expect night time quiet. We heard lots of city noises (shouting, garbage collection and the like) but the bed was comfortable and we didn't really have any trouble sleeping in spite of the noise.

We loved being able to step right out into the city and walk to everything. We stayed three nights and never lacked a new adventure. You can walk to Barri Gotic, to the sea, to La Boqueria and many other great locations.

I do like to unpack when I travel and there was really no place to put my things (small closet, no drawers), but I consider this a small annoyance rather than a deal breaker.

You are paying for location and it is probably worth it, but as far as we could tell, the rooms weren't high luxury in spite of the price.

Overall, I would stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.",4,2018,06,04
37,Best SPG experience,"This property has become my favorite SPG property. I let them know my plan before travel and they took care of all my needs, including VIP passes to most sought after lounges and access to a museum. I'll definitely visit again.",5,2018,05,31
37,Excellent location on Las Ramblas,"Excellent location! Excellent lattes (at the little coffee bar). Diego (concierge) is the absolute best! We rarely ask a concierge for recommendations, but we talked with Diego about places locales go and what we were looking for and the areas of town we liked (non touristy), and he gave (and mapped) us so many great places--all full of locals! ",5,2018,05,31
37,Good location,"Located facing Las Ramblas our room was opposite the Hotel 1898 and Luzia that is a good cafe for pizza, burgers, salad, tapas and more.  Entry to the hotel is on a side street

Our room was small, but clean, comfortable and nicely appointed..

Staff throughout the hotel was friendly and helpful.

The breakfast buffet in the hotel at Centonze had a lot of choices and cooked to order egg station.

In the room, there is an offer from the hotel for one free admission to Palau Guell.  Take advantage of the offer as the ""palace"" is interesting.  Included is a free audio guide in a language of your choice.",4,2018,05,30
37,Outstanding visit,"Stayed there prior to sailing on a cruise. Came a day early to enjoy Barcelona some. The room was very nice, staff was great and location unbeatable. Will stay there again and spend more time next time.",5,2018,05,29
37,No complaints,"We stayed for a full week.
As i thought abouth is review i tried to find fault but couldnt because i want to be completely honest.
Check in: fast and easy. We were exhausted, a full day to get there from California, and everything was smooth. No ipsell no big talks, they knew we were exhausted

Location: very central and convenient for one week. A bit close to touristy area but no big deal.

Rooms: we did switch rooms after 2 days due to construction noise. No issues, no extra charges. Better room[recent update] they dis right by us. We were moved to a larger room, on a lower floor, garbage trucks early in am but what can you do. Room was dece t size, my hubby is 6 foot 4 so it was comfortable. Great shampoos, soaps and new bottled water for us every day ( no charge). A nespresso machine and coffe no additional fee.
Staff was friendly and informative.

Laundry service was excellent 
 But a bit pricey but then again you're in a major city it is as to be expected.

All in all we enjoyed our stay the negatives were minor and the positives outweighed them.

 I do recommend staying here if you want to be in a central location in Barcelona and not pay exorbitant fees to have a comfortable clean chic room with nice staff.

If you can get on a higher floor that's probly better because the lower floor is closer to a lot of activity near Las ramblas and adjacent areas.

",5,2018,05,27
37,One of the Best Hotel Stays of my life,"My fiancé were traveling in Europe and planned to stay in Barcelona for a few days. After staying at Le Meridien on La Rambla, I wish we had stayed longer. The hotel is beautiful, the service and staff were outstanding and the view of La Rambla was intoxicating. If you have the chance, reserve the corner suite right above the street. We sat and watched the passerby’s for hours one night. When we go back to Barcelona, we will stay here again. ",5,2018,05,26
37,Great location + hotel,"We stayed here as part of a Tauck tour of Spain and really enjoyed it.  The location is ideal... walking distance or a short cab ride of most everything... very friendly staff...""typical"" upscale European hotel... very good restaurant...quiet rooms...we certainly would stay here again. ",4,2018,05,25
37,Excellent location,"You can't beat the location -- right on vibrant Ramblas -- in the heart of beautiful Barcelona. It's close to all the major attractions. Good base for exploring the city, particularly if you are SPG member. The hotel is modern and convenient. Rooms were recently renovated and are very comfortable, but like most European hotels they tend to be small.",4,2018,05,20
37,Loved it,"I had a quick business trip to Barcelona and spent a night at this place the service was great and the staff friendly, location was amazing and all I had to do was walk outside and be in the center of the action with places to eat and drink making the free time way enjoyable. I look forward to next time",5,2018,05,17
37,Fantastic location..,"Arrived early from a cruise, room was ready at 8am. Staff were very happy to take care of our early arrival. The location is perfect right on Las Ramblas. Lobby coffee bar is perfect meeting place and Barista is the best. Rooms were very clean and all amenities were replenished every day.",5,2018,05,16
37,Enjoyed Very Much with one Exception,"We had a very good experience overall at this hotel. Excellent location and a very nice and large upgraded room. The A/C worked well, the bathroom had two sinks and the sound insulation was good. The biggest, and really only one negative, was inadequate lighting. It was definitely one of the darkest rooms we have ever stayed in!",4,2018,05,15
37,Fabulous location and innovative service,"Stayed 2 nights recently as part of a trip to Spain.  Superb location if you want to be in the centre of everything as it's in the Ramblas with markets, the Gothic quarter, cathedral, Gaudi's Casa Batilo, loads of restaurants etc. all within walking distance.  

I had a newly renovated room on the second floor.  They're finished in light wood giving an airy feel even though the rooms are actually small.  However they are cleverly laid out with enough space for 2 large suitcases and 2 small trolley bags + coffee and tea making facilities as well as the mini-bar.  The main downside is noise as even double glazing cannot eliminate street noise given that the hotel is a low rise building located in the thick of things.  So ear plugs are a good idea.  

What really stands out is the hotel's combined use of Whatsapp plus an excellent and responsive concierge desk to assist guests with requests.  We could even request for help with restaurant reservations whilst en route back to the hotel, tell them roughly where we were and get the reservations.  It's the first time I have experienced it, and it made such a difference to the stay.  This more than compensated for the street noise and the rather small rooms.   

Bravo!",5,2018,05,11
37,"Great Location, average place","I was really excited about coming to Barcelona and Staying on La Rambla for 5 days.  I booked 5 months in advanced.  Based on reviews I read here I asked for a low room floor on las ramblas.   They did have a room on la rambla but wanted an extra 40 Euro per night.   You might be able to get it for free maybe if you are a SPG Platinum, but my Gold Membership wasn't enough. ?  The rooms have a few drawers that are enough for one person.  If you have 2 people you will be living out of your suit case.",3,2018,05,11
37,Outrage fees for pets,"Well, I have stayed in this hotel several times on business and the staff at check-in and concierge is always very very helpful and courteous.
This time I was travelling with my daughter and dog 11kgs!
The extra rollaway for my daughter was €80 plus dog €80 per night! I think this is a bit much as i pay at the meiriden nice €30 or the danieli venice €25 plus get extra service ;(",4,2018,05,08
37,The Best Service on My Trip in Spain,"Of course the location is fantastic if you want to tour the gothic quarter or the Barcelonetta district. Greater than that was the prompt, always enthusiastic, friendly and extremely helpful front desk staff and concierge. Diego, in particular, always went above and beyond to be sure our needs were met. He helped us a few times find suitable restaurants and locations to visit. The entire staff was always there to help. The food in the restaurant is excellent too. The room is very comfortable and attractive. As crazy as it sounds, my favorite in the room is the  upscale and extremely well functioning bathroom.",5,2018,05,06
37,Wow ,"We came to Barcelona for our anniversary and my wife’s birthday.  We spent three days at Le Meridien, at it was amazing.  The location is perfect close to everything.  The restaurant serves the best meals (please do the breakfast buffet).  The rooms are spacious, the beds are like sleeping on a cloud.  But what really sets Le Meridien apart is the staff.  They all went out of there way to make our stay memorable.  I cannot that them all enough.  Ricardo the concierge exchanged emails with us before we arrived ensuring we saw the things we wanted and had a great experience.  When we checked in Joao made sure we had a great room and made us feel like home.  I wish I could remember everyone’s name and thank them all because it is the service, the friendliness that makes this hotel one of the best I have ever stayed at, thank you. ",5,2018,05,06
37,Reminded us how wonderful Barcelona is,"Our flight had a stop over in Barcelona and we selected Le Meridien for the lay over. The hotel, the staff, and the location was wonderful! 

The service was impeccable and efficient. The gentleman checking is in took the time to share a local's perspective on things to see and do.  He shared great historical venues that host concerts and that intrigued us so much, we booked a concert!

The hotel is located at one end of La Ramblas and blocks to concert venues or local neighborhood restaurants. We walked by a wonderful neighborhood tapas restaurant that we would love to visit again. ",4,2018,05,05
37,"Central Location, Very Nice Accommodations","Overall, a really nice experience at Le Meridien Barcelona. First of all, the staff is really outstanding. Everyone was super nice and competent. Check in was fast, upgraded to a beautiful suite with a welcome gift and plenty of water. (I'm an SPG Platinum, they knew to take care of me).

Room was of course quite big and comfortable (though not luxurious -- LeM is not a luxury hotel, but it is absolutely top notch). Bath was modern with separate tub and shower which I really appreciate.

Breakfast was excellent as well with attentive service and for me a good place to work undisturbed for a couple of hours.

Oh, while it's a bit hidden, check out the outside patio on the 6th floor. Quite a nice spot to relax and enjoy the view.

Finally a note about location. LeM is smack on La Rambla. Take that for what it's worth. Close to everything for sure, but in the middle of the most touristy spot in Spain. 

Absolutely positively recommend this hotel.",4,2018,05,04
37,Great location & staff!!,"Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and upgraded to a suite.  The room was a very spacious. We had a sofa, coffee table and chairs, a king sized bed, a large bathroom with two sinks and vanities, a large soaking tub, shower and towel warmers.  The balcony was also very spacious.  It had a sofa and coffee table, a dining table for 4 with large umbrella and two lounging chairs for soaking up the sun or star gazing.  Housekeeping came regularly, refreshing towels and drinking water.  A huge ice bucket was brought to the room whenever ice was requested.  This was a huge deal for us since we are accustomed to cold beverages and most places will only provided 1 or 2 ice cubes when requested.  The gym was well equipped and offered complimentary bottled water, towels and fruits.  The hotel is close walking distance to the Placa Catalunya, the Gothic, the Picasso museum, Spain's first chocolate shop, many good restaurants, the metro station, la Boqueria market, Museu Diocesa featuring Gaudi and the Mediterranean Sea.  If you don not mind a longer, leisurely stroll, you can walk to La Pedrera, Casa Batllo located on Passeig de Garcia (High fashion shopping area), and Sagrada Familia. And for those who miss the creature comforts of home, there is a Starbucks located across the street from the hotel.  The  hotel also offers complimentary umbrellas to guest if the weather is less than agreeable for walking but you want to venture out anyway.  I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.  I would return to this property as well.  ",5,2018,05,02
37,"Great Location, Amazing Service!","The Le Meridien is located just off Las Ramblas. Great walking distance to food and shopping, Starbucks, and the Plaça de Catalunya to catch the hop-on hop-off buses to tour the city. The Le Meridien accommodated our request for connecting rooms for our large family. All of the staff members spoke English and were welcoming and friendly. The staff went above and beyond for each of our requests, helping with area maps, shopping, and restaurants recommendations. Later in the evening, the Conceriage helped us order Dominos pizza for delivery. The next morning it was rainy, and they had umbrellas available at the front door in the lobby for guests to borrow. As a Starwood Platinum, I would say that the Le Meridien Barcelona is one of the best Starwood experiences, and best Starwood service, that I have encountered. We we definitely return to the Le Meridien on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2018,05,01
37,Quick side trip in Barcelona,"At the end of our cruise we stopped by Barcelona and stayed at Le Meridien.  Rooms were a good size, restaurant on site with good food, and helpful staff who arranged good dining reservations. Hotel is near the Ramblas which is always bustling. ",4,2018,05,01
37,Good Spot for City Trekking,"Friendly Staff, Fresh Local Foods and in the epicentre of the City. If you're a 'Foodie' you're going to love discovering the eateries, markets and restaurants dotted in and around the area from the hotel",4,2018,04,29
37,Great Location right in the City Centre,"A hotel right in the city centre, a few meters away from Rambla's walking street. Hunderts  of small restaurant, shops and entertainment places around. The rooms are comfortable, bathrooms are modern. Breakfast is basic but sufficient over some short period of stay. Staff is friendly with the exception to house keeping (not interested, superficially, forgetful and not really helping if asked for example to re-stock drinking water).",3,2018,04,25
37,Hotel stay,"Extremely nice hotel, very helpful staff in particular concierge services, clean & comfortable, lots of shops right there including souvenir stands all up & down the street, also good location for hop on hop off bus tours. Also within walking distance of many restaurants.",5,2018,04,24
37,Great location,Stayed 4 nights. Given a room on what we were told was the recently renovated 2nd floor — small but by European standards comfortable and met our needs. Clean and always efficient housekeeping — returned To room usually by noon and always made up.  Room located on side street above entrance and taxi stand — we Had to keep windows closed as in early morning hours noise from waiting taxi cabs was annoying as they talked loudly.  We heard evening noise from Ramblas but that was tolerable and I. Distance compared to this. But location for getting out and walking and sightseeing was great.,4,2018,04,22
37,Genuinely quiet interior rooms in heart of the city,"The best thing about this hotel is that despite being located round the corner from the Ramblas the hotel offers genuinely quiet rooms where there is no traffic noise at all.  Request an inside room and it really is quiet.  The bedding and feather pillows are also very comfortable you should get a good night's sleep.  So for quiet room this hotel scores 5 - top score.  Overall though the rooms are quite basic, feel small, don't have much in way of amenities even in a deluxe room - no body lotion, the water took time to warm in the tap, and feels like a basic Ibis type room.  So this takes the overall score down to be fair to other hotels.  But if it simply a quiet room you want then this could be the place to stay.",3,2018,04,20
37,Good service and location,"I stayed in this property on the 29th of March for 2 nights and had booked a junior suite with connecting deluxe room. The 1st impression of the hotel was a bit disappointing had a very depressing look and ambiance also the lobby area was very basic and not attractive at all but the most disappointing shock was the rooms! The junior suite was so depressing dull, dark and situated on the 7th floor in one remote conor and what was supposed to be a connecting room was on the other end , honestly I wanted to cry as it was almost 10pm at night and a very gloomy interior and decor  really wanted to run away.but must admit the Shift Leader Mr Joao Brito was one of the most helpful managers he tried his best to please me and immediately realised my discomfort and dissatisfaction and went down to check if he could give me another room. Luckily he upgraded us to a corner suite on the renovated floor La Ramblas view and connected to the deluxe room.Indeed it was definitely better than the old set up more bright, vibrant and relaxing totally opposite to the one which was originally offered to us although the sound proofing was bad in spite of having double glazing and too many faults in the decor and door design but must admit was more cheering and relaxing to stay in and again sincere appreciation and great thanks to Mr Joao Brito the reception supervisor  who really acknowledged my discomfort and tried his maximum to keep me comfortable asap. This is what I consider a good customer service
The breakfast was just basic nothing exciting about it but the staff were all very helpful and friendly from the door keeper to the front desk staff.
The bathroom amenities were really nice and the housekeeping was nice.",3,2018,04,19
37,OLD,"We stayed at this Hotel on Easter Sunday for a pre-cruise stay and we were gouged for $500.00 for one night. They claim to be a 5 star hotel and I would like to know who rates these places but I would pay no more than $100.00 a night. The hotel itself is an Old building which was remodeled and transformed into what I would say is at best a 3 star hotel. We paid $500.00 Euro and I think I should receive a refund. They stole money. In our Country it is price Gouging so do the right thing , reimburse some of the money. and not wit a Hotel stay as I do not plan on returning to Barcelona in the future. But I will however continue to let fellow travelers know about our experience with Le Meridien.",3,2018,04,19
37,Perfect location,"This hotel was perfect. We arrived early(10 am) after a long flight.  Salvador said our room wasn’t ready however he had another room available which did not have a great view. That was fine with us.  We were happy to have anything so early.  The room was beautiful and very quit. The shower is amazing.  The location could not be better.  We are on Las Ramblas and a short walk to The Barcelona Cathedral, Picasso Museum and The Barcelona History Museum.  Tons of great restaurants at your doorstep, including the hotel restaurant for a quick, easy, inexpensive breakfast. The concierge was also very friendly and helpful ",5,2018,04,17
37,family easter vacation,"i was reluctant about the hotel, having the old look from the outside, but it turned to be a very nice choice, renovated rooms, very nice and convenient breakfast for the whole family, having 2 picky kids 12 and 7. more than perfect location with a lot to do just walking.",5,2018,04,16
37,Wonderful Property in a Superb Location On Ramblas,"Le Meridien is a very good hotel with a superb location and an excellent supporting staff.  The concierge staff are particularly noteworthy.  Ricardo is a wonderful example of the attention to service in this facility.  You'll enjoy their breakfast service, and you are within walking distance of many of Barcelona's sights.  Cleanliness is a hallmark and the beds are extremely comfortable.  As with many hotels in Spain, you may find it difficult to control temperature, particularly if you prefer lower temperatures at night.",4,2018,04,14
37,Wonderful stay ,"I just had a wonderful stay at the Le Meridien in Barcelona. As an SPG member I received an upgrade to a wonderful suite with a lovely terrace. What impressed me the most was the attention given by the staff, not just to me but to everyone. Each staff member seems to be interested in going out of their way to be helpful. I definitely recommend it.",5,2018,04,09
37,"Centrally located, wonderful staff","Used SPG points to stay here stayed in a suite. Large bathroom with large shower, Malin and Goetz bath products. Very comfortable bed and bedding. We reported a drip from the ceiling vent and were surprised to receive a bottle of champagne as an apology ! We checked in at 8 a.m. after an overnight flight from NY, our room was not ready but was well taken care of by the British guy at reception, he stored our luggage offered a free coffee from the lobby cafe, we returned at 10 and he stepped out to tell us our suite was ready. Lovely staff thruout the hotel all most helpful with any request, Well kept exercise facility in lower level, lobby cafe for coffee and light bites. We ate breakfast daily in the restaurant, a nice buffet, pricey but good. Well located Las Ramblas location, with a Starbucks around the corner as well as a supermaket for incidentals. I would definitely stay here again !",5,2018,04,05
37,On point,"This is a really fantastic Starwood property. The location, service and touches were all on point. We arrived at 8 am following trans Atlantic flight on Good Friday. Our room was ready (just good luck). Spacious for Europe and quite modern, clean and gorgeous bathroom. Everyone was very nice. Location is excellent for access to gothic quarter, Barceloneta, and Eixample. They accommodated a late check out. Really was everything we could have asked for. ",5,2018,04,02
37,"Nice Hotel, Nice Location, Great Service.","My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and were very happy with the accommodations.  The hotel is very nice.  The location on Las Ramblas is very convenient. The restaurant in the hotel is good as is the breakfast buffet. The staff is very accommodating, Dawnella at the front desk helped with room selection and restaurant recommendations.  She and the rest of the team were all very eager to pease. Higher floor was quiet.  The hotel windows have excellent sound proofing.",5,2018,04,01
37,Nice hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at le Meridian. The rooms are comfortable and well pointed, and the hotel,is convenient to seeing the city. On our first night one of our fellow travelers had his airline loose his luggage. That evening the concierge recommended a nearby restaurant for dinner. About half an hour after beginning dinner the conceierge came to the restaurant to report to our friend that his luggage had been delivered to the hotel. Our only negative comment is the pricing in the restaurant and bar are quite high.",4,2018,03,31
37,"3rd time in Barcelona, 3rd time at this hotel!","We had two nights in Barcelona at the start of our travels through Spain.  We had stayed at Le Meridien previously when it Barcelona and it absolutely lived up to our expectations again.  Rooms had recently been updated, and our room was very comfortable and clean, and had plenty of room for a rollaway bed to accommodate our family of 3.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome as an SPG elite member.  Location is just steps off La Ramblas, but on a small side street.  Highly Recommended!",5,2018,03,25
37,Expected a better service for SPG platinum member,"The hotel is OK, however, being an SPG Platinum member, i always get an upgrade upon availability, Unfortunately, the hotel staff was not able to accommodate my   upgrade request even though there were plenty of better rooms and junior suites available at the hotel.",2,2018,03,23
37,A most enjoyable stay,"It is with pleasure I write this review as I cannot remember a hotel stay I've enjoyed so much. After a 14 day cruise crossing the Atlantic, we had the opportunity to spend three days in Barcelona. We chose Le Meridien and are so happy we did. 

As a lifetime Platinum guest, we were given a beautiful junior suite. Rooms in Europe are quite small by US standards so we really enjoyed the extra space. The really amazing staff is the reason I rate this hotel so highly. I usually remember a name or two of employees who performed ""above and beyond"". That was not necessary here-EVERYONE I encountered was outstanding. Both the front desk staff and concierge gave us great tour ideas, directions and restaurant choices. Every time we returned, we were usually greeted by name-it felt like we were returning home after our busy days sightseeing and eating! Housekeeping was flawless and the bell staff was always attentive whether it was opening a door or helping with luggage or packages. I've rarely encountered such depth of excellence in a hotel. My hat is off to management and staff for creating such a environment of excellence and for helping to make our last three days in Spain so special.",5,2018,03,21
37,Fantastic holiday at Le Meridien in Barcelona,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and the experience was amazing.  The hotel is located right in the middle of the action - fun on all sides with Las Ramblas in front, a great little square behind the hotel and the many wonderful shops and restaurants just down the street.  The staff were warm, welcoming and more than accommodating.  The food and drink in the restaurant was fantastic - the only reason I gave 4 / 5 stars was the beer menu could have been a little more broad. The room we stayed in was wonderful - roomy with a great view including accordion playing from the square below.  Overall the service, hospitality, comfort and value of the hotel were truly spectacular.  We will surely return!",5,2018,03,20
37,Excellent! Couldn’t ask for more....,"I was part of a big (and demanding ;)) group of business travellers who recently stayed here during our company conference. Was there for 5 days and there was absolutely nothing I could complain about! 😃Every request re the conference set up was met with a warm smile and delivered promptly. I stayed on one of the renovated floors - room was modern well designed and cozy and well stocked with amenities. Service all around was immaculate- from the restaurants and sight seeing tips offered by concierge, to the front desks staff to the restaurant staff etc. Breakfast spread was hearty and delicious. It felt like the hotel even specially prepared Asian food that suit our big group’s palates.  Last but not least - location is extremely centralised- it’s on the Las Ramblas- which means great shopping and sight seeing..... v touristy but since it was my first time in Barcelona, that suited me perfectly well. Overall an excellent hotel and I couldn’t ask for more!",5,2018,03,16
37,Great location,Travelled with business and the room was immaculate room. For work it was great the internet was quick and easy to access so allowed me to continue working without disruption. Would stay here again for work or for leisure,5,2018,03,14
37,Great Service,"Staff is extremely friendly.  Relied on concierge to make dinner recommendations and reservations and was never disappointed.  The door man ran around the block (on multiple occasions) to secure taxis for us which was truly going above and beyond.  Enjoyed a light meal at the bar which was prepared perfectly and by the friendliest bartender ever.  Room was very clean and even had a flat iron alongside the blow drier (amazing!) Soaps and other amenities were great with comfy slippers, fluffy pillows and more.  Will be staying here on my next visit.  ",5,2018,03,11
37,"Rude staff, small rooms and not linked with SPG - better stay at Renaissance or Hilton!!","I am a gold member with Starwood and get awesome benefits at Sheraton, Le Meridians and other partner hotels around the world, but i was shocked when staff at Le Meridien, Barcelona told me that they won't honor my 'gold' status unless I book it via SPG.com, which is generally 20-30% more expensive than expedia or any other third-party booking website. This is so damn bizarre and ridiculous, and defeats the purpose of loyalty if you have to pay exuberant prices on SPG website, when you can find cheaper deals at expedia. Furthermore, the reception staff including the manager was quite rude. On hotel, the location is nice, but the room is small for what you pay. I would recommend staying at Renaissance or the Hilton which are much better",1,2018,03,10
37,Attorney,Wonderful location with lovely suites.  The staff tremendous with their service and all the gifts left in my room.   Great bathrooms. The bed was very comfortable with quality bedding.  Lovely selection of restaurants.,5,2018,03,04
37,Great Spot and Wonderful Staff,"This hotel is located on Las Ramblas which makes it convenient to everything.  Short walks to the Port area as well as the Plaza, very near two Metro Stops. Our room was available when we arrived from our overnight flight which made it even better!  The staff was always welcoming and helpful.  The rooms on the Ramblas side of the hotel do allow for the noise from the night crowds and a slight rumble of the metro, but we didn't experience any noise from other guests.  Our room was nicely equipped, the twin beds and pillows were very comfortable.  A little snug moving around the furniture, but the bathroom was very nice.  A definite recommend if you wish to be in this area, close to the Gothic area too.  Wifi was free and very good.",4,2018,02,26
37,Excellent staff but overall I was disappointed for the brand,"Le Meridien Barcelona

The staff are the highlight at this hotel. From the reception, to housekeeping, to the restaurant I was met with friendly, helpful efficiency. They took Amazon deliveries, loaned me a plug adapter (without requiring a thumbprint in blood to guarantee its return) and thanked me numerous times for being SPG Platinum.

Inside the room I was surprised that toiletries were kept to a minimum and the coffee was instant. I had to ask for toothpaste and shaving cream to be delivered. There was a safe, iron and trouser press. The premium WiFi was uselessly, unbearably slow in room 440. I kept my phone on the data plan because neither my iPad or laptop showed more than two bars signal strength which made actually using the internet a painful throwback to early 2000s dial-up. I was happy that the hotel is one of the few that still does the “make a green choice” programme and awards 500 SPG points every day you decline housekeeping. 

Breakfast was high quality. The scrambled eggs were perfectly creamy. So many hotels think scrambled eggs are rubberised omelet mixture. After experiencing breakfast buffets at Le Meridiens across Asia I was surprised at the limited choices for breakfast at this grade of hotel but the staff were super friendly and for two days it was fine. Much more than that and it would be quite monotonous. 

As a SPG Platinum, I have to say the stay was disappointing. I give SPG >75 nights a year and in return they give me room upgrades and other benefits. Room upgrades are not optional when they are available and there were rooms up to Junior Suites freely available for my stay on the app (I checked) but they still gave me an entry-level room. Travelling alone for work I just needed a bed to sleep in so I didn’t raise this but if I’d been on holiday then I’d have had to put my foot down and this just creates bad feeling so they should stick to the T&Cs of the SPG programme without putting guests into uncomfortable positions. There’s no lounge here (surprising for a city centre hotel) and no Platinum hour in the bar. Strictly by the letter of the programme (this rule they did choose to follow) I had to choose between breakfast or 500 welcome points. All quite meh for a Platinum experience in a Le Meridien.

They partially recovered on the first evening when I returned to find a bottle of red wine in the room. It’s Spain so this must have cost <€5 but I appreciated the gesture as it was exactly what I needed when I got back late at night. The staff made me want to rate this hotel Very Good but WiFi, breakfast and poor Platinum treatment relegates it to an Average given the price.",3,2018,02,26
37,Magical,"This hotel as all the works. Located near las ramblas blvd - just a few steps from all the shops and attractions, this is your place for a great stay. Staff was very welcoming and the room was charming!",5,2018,02,23
37,A great hotel to discover Barcelona,"This is a first rate hotel located close to everything.  The staff was very attentive, the rooms clean and roomy (large based on European standards), the buffet yummy and the bar fun.  The concierge staff helped plan our visit with suggestions and actually locating tickets for everything we wanted to see and do.  The hotel is close to the transportation center which made it easy to catch trains for other destinations.  We made a trip up to Montserrant which is a must see.  You can do this via a tour company or on your own, as we did.  It takes 3 trains to get there but that's half the fun.  The hotel is on La Ramblas and is great for people watching.  So many things to see and do in Barcelona... don't forget one day just for the Hop on Hop off bus... a great way to see the city.",5,2018,02,20
37,Good hotel - Noisy location,"Good hotel and very central, properly in Rambla.The rooms are clean and the staff is very nice. They have a good restaurant as well.
The only thing we did not like it was that the area is crowded and noisy... But of course, that is the price you have to pay to stay in the city center.",4,2018,02,20
37,"Modern hotel, great staff in the heart of Barcelona!","The hotel is beautiful and modern located right in the heart of the city, yet it's quiet and safe. It was our first time in Barcelona traveling for both work and some personal time. At check-in we were greeted by Diego and the property manager Anna. They took the time to tell us about the hotel as well as recommend lots of great sights and restaurants in the area. Diego and Anna and the entire staff made us feel like we were the only guests at the Meridien! So personable and professional! We will stay here again!",5,2018,02,15
37,"It was ok, did not wow me enough ","Went into the bar for a drink after looking in the uk for nice place to have pre dinner drinks.  We were looking forward to going.  We went in and the young lady on the door was lovely. She got us settled down at the bar and left us to it.  The bar tender was making four cocktail and was reading his menu card for each one.  We waited a good ten minutes before placing our order then a further ten to get our drink.  Was it nice, yes a fairy garden cocktail and a glass of wine. 

All in all, there was nothing bad about my visit but I suppose m expectations were not meet as we had googled it and decided that’s was where we wanted t go.  ",3,2018,02,15
37,Great Location,"Perfectly situated off Ramblas and within walking distance to many of the areas around Ramblas and towards the water.  Hotel itself was expensive and the rooms, though well appointed, and clean were not at luxury level.  Breakfast service is good and the gym had all the basic equipment, bike, etc.  Overall a great place to stay, albeit a bit expensive.",4,2018,02,07
37,Great Hotel in a great location,"This hotel was very modern, well appointed, and in a great location. The gentlemen working the coffee bar made some of the best espresso I had the 8 days I was in Spain (2 nights here, the rest at other hotels). Comfortable beds, great shower and space.  The staff was friendly and helpful, we were allowed an 11am checkin to drop our luggage in our room before going out. The only drawback I feel was the price of the hotel, I feel it was a little higher than it should be.",5,2018,01,24
37,Wonderful,"From the time we entered the lobby the staff did all they could to make us feel welcome, and they succeeded!  Our room Was spacious, the bed very comfortable. And we were gifted in our room with a bottle of rose from the hotel!   The breakfast buffet had everything imaginable, nothing was omitted and the staff there remembered everyday that I liked ice in my orange juice!",5,2018,01,24
37,Truly a 4 star not a 5 star,"everything about this out is just okay. but not up to a true 5-star standard. Other then the rooms, which are 5 star. The staff was just okay- like luck warm. The room service *late night menu is like junk form your pantry. It was not 5 star. the location is great though. go elsewhere for the price.",3,2018,01,16
37,"Hands down best location, wonderful staff!","Was split between the W, Arts Hotel (Ritz C) Le Meridien when booking due to SPG/Marriott membership. Went for the Le Meridien on the basis that the location looked a lot more interesting. 

The location wasn't just great... it was PERFECT! :) Las Ramblas is such a cool street/area. You are literally right where you need to be for everything! There is an amazing indoor food market a few yards away!!

The staff were wonderful, super friendly and helpful! They gave great advice on what to do and where to eat. The breakfast there was really excellent with so many choices. Something for everyone to eat and the staff always ensured your glasses were topped up with freshly squeezed OJ!

There is no members/club lounge but they had 2-1 tasty cocktails at Le Pop bar between 6:30-10pm which certainly made up for it.

The rooms are well sized and even though it's just off on a busy road, the rooms are soundproofed so you don't hear anything what so ever. Views were nice too.

Really and truly a fantastic place to stay so that you can get the very best out of this exciting city! 

If your looking for a place with a bit of 'Mad Men' Mid-Century Charm - this place cannot be beaten!

Thanks LeMB for a wonderful weekend! See you again soon!",5,2018,01,15
37,so pleased!,"i'd reserved a room on spg points for my husband's birthday. we arrived early on a thursday (had booked from the night before), checked in and went straight to our room. the hotel upgraded us to a suite and it was so nice!! fully separated sitting and bedroom and quite spacious! the view wasn't great, but hey -- the room surpassed our expectations, so no complaints. the shower and tub were separate as well, and the shower had two sections -- one for the rain showerhead and the other for the handheld. it was great!

i opted for breakfast rather than points and i definitely made the right choice! nice selection each morning (fruit, yogurt, cold cuts/cheeses, hot foods, etc. they even have a DIY pan con tomate area! don't miss it!) and i loved the orange juice. (it has a small kick of bitterness, which i liked; my husband didn't like as much.)

the hotel is in a great location -- two subways nearby, carrefour next door and la boqueria just a few minutes away. the concierge was also very helpful -- we were looking for a special occasion restaurant and he talked us through a number of choices. very knowledgeable and well connected.

overall, a memorable experience. thanks for everything!!",5,2018,01,14
37,Best Location!,"Positives-Truly the best location. Right off the main street but quiet. Very clean and helpful staff. They sincerely wanted to ensure we enjoyed our stay.
Negatives-Maybe it was just too modern for us, but the Family Room we had was very dark. No lights in the closets and dim lighting throughout. Even in the bathroom. The bathroom was huge but had a very small shower making it uncomfortable and I'm 5'4'' and 110 pounds. In addition, there is no spa. Only a converted hotel room with a steam and sauna and 1 treatment room.",4,2018,01,11
37,Great Location,"Modern décor in the rooms, quiet, clean and perfect location.    Had a great night's sleep in this spacious room with modern furnishings and accessories. Staff left us a treat in the room that added a nice touch.",5,2018,01,06
37,Great location to access the heart of Barcelona,"The hotel locates at the La Rambla close to tons of the historical attractions, bars, cafes, restaurants and Tableo for Flamenco etc.  The hotel staff are quite accommodating to help customizing the trip. The property itself is like a boutique, room is a bit small, however, given it locates at the heart region, not difficult to understand it is going to be expensive to build more spacious room to welcome less guests.",4,2018,01,04
37,Milestone birthday celebration,The hotel is well situated for touring the city. The rooms are a little small and some are dated. We used points for our stay so it was a very good value. The concierge and front desk staff were both cordial and helpful.,4,2017,12,29
37,Fabulous experience!,"Just loved the Meridien. We stayed for 5 days. What made it awesome was
(1) the outstanding service provided by everyone at the reception area. Lots of advice, directions and general help to make us comfortable. And everyone was super friendly. 
(2) the location: you cannot get better than being right at Las Ramblas (entrance is on a side street so not inundated with people at your front door!). A stones throw from all the action, the metro, and tons of restaurants whatever direction you walk. Easy walking to great destination spots like the Cathedral, Real Square, the big shopping area, the sea. The metro stop at the hotel is a central one with all metro lines connecting there so easy ride to any tourist site.
3) the breakfast: Multiple options in a fresh buffet provided daily with made-to-order eggs and enough food choices to address any needs. The croissants tasted like they were straight from a bakery!
(4) the room. They upgraded us (we are SPG Platinum) and our suite was really comfortable with a great deck and view. 
All in all - a great spot to call home away from home!",5,2017,12,28
37,Pay with Cash!!!,"I paid for the hotel through a third party app before checking in. When I checked in I used a different credit card for “incidentals” than the one used for the payment of room, which was supposed to be ahold of $50 euro and reimbursed upon check out. A few hours after checking in I noticed there were THREE pending charges totaling almost $1000!! 
All of these charges have are no longer pending but have since CLEARED, and the hotel has only credited my card for $580. It is five days later now and the Accounting department and management have been less than helpful in clearing this major issue. 

The Hotel itself was fine and priced appropriately, though I would not consider it a five star. ",1,2017,12,26
37,We enjoyed it!,"Good hotel in a fantastic location. Rooms are a bit run-down, but overall a great hotel and perfect rate-quality. We spend 4 nights for Christmas there and can only recommend it. Higher floor is recommended.",4,2017,12,23
37,Gem in Barca ,"My opinion on Le Meridien Barcelona are as follows :

Location : Very Strategic 
Description : 
i) 20min drive from Barcelona Airport

ii) Surrounding full of happening places ( restaurant & bar, souvenirs shop, shopping centre, hypermarket, cafe, main road )
* all just within 5-10mins walk

Interior : Very neat & tidy
i) Booked 2 rooms ( picture attached ) the one with 2 queen sized bed is more spacious. 
* do request for the bed category mentioned for your next visit :)

ii) Complementary WIFI 

Service: Satisfactory  
i) Staffs are professional & friendly as always from Le Meridien ",5,2017,12,17
37,Very good hotel ideally located in the city center,"Room is spacious and modern. Breakfast offers a large choice. Bed was comfortable. Only down side would be the bath that is quite high, not everyone would be able to enter in the shower/bath ( thinking of older people or with physical disabilities), although they probably have different rooms.",5,2017,12,17
37,"Cheap Hotel, Really Terrible Experience","Rude Manager, Humid and smelly rooms, Bad food, and they charge on nights you didn’t spend... Construction work within some floors during daytime making it noisy, overall terrible experience and a rip-off on top of it... U really feel cheap quality and behavior across the board... Not recommended on all levels",1,2017,12,14
37,Great hotel in a great location ,"I stayed here with my two teenage daughters for six nights. We had a very spacious triple room, lovely decor. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is extremely helpful, the concierge gave us so much time helping to plan things to do. The breakfast was great. The location is fantastic, right on Las Ramblas. We could walk almost everywhere we wanted to go, and when we needed to take the metro, the stations were very close by. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,08
37,perfect place to stay in Barcelona,Fabulous rooms all attractions within walking distance. Really helpful staff the concierge gave us suggestions for food and they were awesome. Very close to the hop on hop off bus attraction and all attractions of Las Rambles.,5,2017,12,05
37,The Perfect Bareclona Experience,"My fiancee and I spent a week at Le Meridien Barcelona to celebrate our engagement. We had an amazing experience! There were the basics: location (in the heart of Las Ramblas); accessibility (easy walk to and drive to locations to visit as a tourist or a foody); and quality (newly remodeled hotel with luxury feel but also authentic to Barcelona's vibe). But what made our stay amazing was the staff. The team at Le Meridien was professional, courteous, very helpful and welcoming. The experience with the team there started before our stay. We received an email invitation a few days before we checked-in to participate in their Holiday Lights party. When we arrived, we received a great welcome present to kick-off our celebration (a bottle of good local Cava Brutt and an assortment of strawberries and chocolates)...I highly recommend this place if you want something luxury but practical.",5,2017,12,04
37,Wonderful Hotel in a Perfect Location in Barcelona,"This hotel met all of our needs and then some. We were upgraded to a very comfortable suite; enjoyed our delicious complimentary breakfast each day; and, above all, found the staff to be amazing. Everyone we dealt with Bellmen, Front Desk personnel,Concierge Staff, Food Service and Housekeeping were incredibly accommodating and friendly. Everyone at this property clearly understands the concept of customer service. To top it off, you simply can't beat this location for being right in the center of Las Ramblas and close to so many sights and attractions.",5,2017,11,29
37,Great location ,"Hotel is located in the heart of la Rambla. My room was comfortable and spacious with a big, modern bathroom. The only problem was the moldy smell in the shower. Great breakfast, loads of choices! Very nice and helpful staff.",4,2017,11,29
37,Great Location on Las Ramblas,"We celebrated my birthday and our anniversary at Le'Meridien in Barcelona this November. The management couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. The location on Las Ramblas was convenient to everything we did.  We only needed to use a taxi once in five days.  The staff was friendly and hospitable and always in the lobby to welcome us and to offer help.  The hotel has a cozy feeling.   We had a lovely, comfortable room overlooking Las Ramblas, the restaurant is excellent and so is the maitre D'.  The Concierge service could have been better for a five star hotel.",4,2017,11,23
37,"Good location, nice hotel.","Nice hotel, very comfortable rooms, top location.  Service could be better for the price you are paying, spa needs a lot to improve also service in the spa was not good.  I arrived for my massage on time and there was no one there, I had to call a couple of times the phone that was there to figure out what is going on.  Finally after about 20 minutes the masseuse showed up.  I realize she was behind schedule, but I expect better service at a hotel where you pay this price.",3,2017,11,18
37,It’s not a 5 star hotel,"As a platinum member in arrival I got upgrade, that was expected and nice! The hotel has really good location, but it’s old!
Rooms need renovation! Rooms are not very clean! We lost TV remote control and moved sofa and saw a lot of garbage under it: used napkins, dust, jelly candies. We showed photos to staff, they promised to clean it. They clean it but very bad! Only  after our second remind it was done  ok!
Also I was promised to get 2000 points for our inconvenienced, but I still didn’t get them, however I reminded about it to the hotel manager during checking out and she promised to take care about it!
Concierge service also was very poor!
We had unstandart situation and we, platinum members,  were deligated to trainee, that was absolutely unhelpful!!!! She couldn’t help, so it was easier to do everything ourselves.

I would definitely say, hotel spent looks and provide service of 5 star hotel",3,2017,11,18
37,Le Meridien Hotel,A very fine and highly rated hotel. In season it is priced very high but since it was off season we were able to get an acceptable rate. The room was modern and clean. The service and staff more than acceptable and the breakfast served each morning fantastic. Definitely go for the freshly squeezed orange juice as a starter.,5,2017,11,14
37,Great People and Lovely Property,"Did a large scale summit event and worked with business events team. Great people and easy to communicate with. The property was very nice, clean and the team was very easy to work with.

The conference rooms were very nice and the staff followed requests for our arrangements. Events with 50+ people can be a challenge, but we had not complaints from any of our guests about the hotel. 

Diego was my assistant during the event and he was FABULOUS! Elvira was a gracious and wonderful person to work with and had amazing patience and understanding regarding out groups requirements.

The concierge group was wonderful as well!

Thank you for a wonderful experience!",4,2017,11,13
37,Top shelf hotel!,"Location, service, room and breakfast A+. We were welcomed as soon as we walked in the door. The staff and concierges were very helpful with dining tips, transportation and tickets. The breakfast is a wonderful way to start off your day and the staff is very friendly. The location on the La Rambla is within easy walking to lots of great spots. Over all we had a very nice, relaxing stay.",5,2017,11,12
37,Easy option in center of Barcelona,"We stayed at Le Meridien for 3 nights after a 5 night stay at the W. As a SPG Platinum +75 member, I was upgraded to a suite.  It was great and the room-located on a corner-got great light in the living room. The hotel is centrally located on Las Ramblas. The room was comfortable & clean. Great Malin & Goetz products. 

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet.  It included cava & an chef made omelets to each customer’s specifications.  

Staff in lobby could have been more welcoming. They only occasionally greeted us as we came & went. But that is a minor complaint. 

The hotel is a great, solid option if you want to be centrally located. We walked everywhere. ",4,2017,11,12
37,Get ready to be treated well!,"Perfect location on Las Ramblas. Bedding and mattress were divine.  Concierge Bruno was very helpful getting us tickets to both Sagrada Familia (with audio tour - highly recommend!), as well as tickets for Park Guell - great to avoid the lines. Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was one of the best we have had. A little concerned that we had a room on the first floor (lobby is zero floor), but other than a little street noise, it was pretty quiet, and so lovely to take the historic staircase up to our room instead of the elevator. Easy walk down to the harbor, and to the Bari Gotic.",5,2017,11,08
37,Average Hotel in Great Area,"Great location, near shopping, great restaurants, and attractions. The staff is nice, but they are very disorganized. Additionally, the rooms are a bit dated. The bathroom in my suite could've used some remodeling.",3,2017,11,07
37,La Rambla the Place to be,"We had stayed on La Rambla previously and love the central location.  It's easy to walk everywhere and many of the Viator tours meet at the central plaza a 5min stroll away.  

The hotel is deceiptively old fashioned from the outside but very modern inside.  Check in was a breeze and as a spg gold member we have a your24 option of 24 hour checkins when available as long as the check out is prior to the time of check in (ie check in a 10am leave at 9am).  It's very convenient as cruises want you off the ship early.   (PS the trip from the port is barely 10min without traffic so a taxi is fine).

Rooms are updated and modern although a deluxe room is still quite small.   The bathroom is large and there is lots of storage with a small minibar and coffee/tea machine.    We ordered room service which is prompt but the food not as good as our Rome hotel.  A club sandwich was small, without the crusts??? and hardly any turkey to speak of -barely a couple of small nuggets.  Fries were better but also a small portion- not enough for two.

The hotel cafe has a quick breakfast -either buffet or ala carte but pricey which seems to be the theme in Europe.  Service was fast which is what we needed prior to our sightseeing tours.

All in all, a nice hotel with good service and close to many restaurants and shopping.",5,2017,11,06
37,Our Barcelona stay,"We stayed in Barcelona for 3 days at this hotel at the start of our adventure in Europe. Loved it, staff friendly and helpful, nice room, spotless and comfortable. The position of the hotel is perfect, we have walked everywhere.  It is close to the best market, little supermarkets and just go behind the hotel and discover lots of little tapas bars and restaurants. Loved to stay longer, maybe next time.",5,2017,11,05
37,Just the place to be!,"Could not ask for a better location. Near La Rambla and so many other landmarks (La Boqueria!), it was just the perfect choice. We were upgraded to the most wonderful room (thanks Daniela!). The service was just what you would expect—professional and friendly. Already looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2017,11,05
37,Heart of La Rambla,"We stayed at Le Meridien on October 15th for a couple of nights after a cruise.  We were given a room (early check in - much appreciated) on the first floor which has been recently renovated.  Spacious rooms, modern decor, very comfortable.  Staff was very helpful with information and directions.  Very conveniently located and a pleasure to stay in.",5,2017,11,03
37,Best downtown hotel in Barcelona,"Followed a Japanese client to reserve this hotel place and stayed 2 nights. Despite the complex drive and expensive parking, hotel did not disappoint. Excellent staff, large well equipped rooms (a luxury with central Barcelona hotels) and a location to die for - especailly if you like the background static a city of Barcelona's undeniable character provides. Surrounded by great architecture and  even better restaurants - 100 yards from the Ramblas and all it promises. An absolute delight - if a little of the pricey side.",5,2017,11,02
37,"Excellent service, good rooms, nice restaurant","5 stars for outstanding desk clerks and concierge.  Would definitely stay there again.

Rooms are clean, trying a bit too hard to be hip, but comfortable and very clean.  Great location.  

The staff waa what really set tbis hotel apart from others.  They were consistently friendly, helpful and courteous.  ",4,2017,11,01
37,Location is Both a + and_,"Located  smack in the middle of the Rambla, location is both a big plus and a a big minus for this property.   This is an excellent and well ran hotel but guest experience can easily be impacted by conditions outside and beyond the hotel’s control.  Protests and loud revelers outside can easily affect your access to the property and your sleep.   Rooms facing the street are besieged with street noise late into the night.   Protests and road blocks in the vicinity do not allow cabs to access to this property.  Additionally, having to go through the cowd and the tourist traps all over the  Rambla   going to and from this hotel can be very annoying.   Planning ahead is required when leaving this hotel to catch a train, plane or any appointment.     Subject to the time you leave and street protests,   you might have to drag your luggage several blocks just to hail a cab to Sants or to the airport.",3,2017,10,29
37,Nice hotel - all you would expect from Le Meridien,"This is a nice hotel just a few feet from Las Ramblas and the main shopping area. It is nice hotel with good sized rooms which are well insulated from noise. We slept so, so well during our stay there! Nice toiletries and all you expect from a hotel of this class such as Bath robes and free water. A great base for exploring Barcelona. ",4,2017,10,28
37,Luxurious hotel in fantastic location.,"You can't beat this location - right on the La Rambla.  This 5 star hotel deserves every one of those stars.  The service is impeccable and everyone on the staff was eager to be helpful and friendly.  The room is what you would expect of a hotel of this caliber - immaculate with all amenities including hair dryer, iron and ironing board, safe, turn-down service, TV, internet.  The lobby is not large but it does have a place to have a cup of coffee or drink and a few chairs and sofas near the reception desk.  Breakfast was excellent with a large display of fruits, cheeses, breads, pastries, eggs and meats.  You can walk to shopping, the beach, historical sights, Gaudi buildings, great restaurants.  I can't imagine a better location in all of Barcelona.  I would definitely make this my hotel should I be in Barcelona again.",5,2017,10,27
37,"Great location, lovely accommodations","We stayed at Le Meridien and were delighted with our room, the staff, the location, and the ease of traveling from one area to another. Las Ramblas is a happening place with lots of shops and restaurants including La Boqueria which is a fun market area with so many interesting things to see and eat. We were there a few weeks prior to the terror attack and noted the lack of bollards at the ends of this wide avenue. I suspect that has been remedied. The hotel is quite close to Plaça Catalunya which has nice statuary and fountains. Also the bus tours of the city start there. Perfect!",5,2017,10,22
37,Perfect location ,"If you want a hotel that is convenient to everything this is the perfect hotel. If you go right you can walk to the waterfront, if you go left you can find fantastic shopping. The front desk and concierge staff was helpful and friendly. The room was on the small side but the bathroom was remodeled. ",4,2017,10,16
37,Super Place to Stay,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 days. Service is what makes a hotel. The Concierge was super. She gave me lovely places to eat, guides to show me the Basilica Americana , the Picasso , the the wonderful museums on the overlook of town. The next best thing are the lovely boulevards in this city . The Meridien is just around the corner from the Hard Rock Cafe. You can leave Spain and go to real American style ice cream and fast food in minutes. 

This is a valid full service hotel, updated and nice spa. 

 Make sure you get the breakfast included. It is worth the money . The clientele is very mixed so you can see any style of folk on their way to eat .",5,2017,10,16
37,Five nights at the Le Meridien Barcelona were not enough!!!,"The Le Meridien in Barcelona is my go-to hotel!  Amazing staff and great rooms.  Yes, it's a bit pricy, but it's worth it.  Amazing location; comfortable, modern, updated rooms; excellent bathroom amenities; and a superb espresso bar in the lobby.  The breakfast buffet shouldn't be missed.",5,2017,10,16
37,great stay,I was there on a business trip. amazing hotel. perfect locations. Many great things are at walk-able distance. staff is courteous and well informed if ask anything about the city. Rooms are very great with a modern look. they have a coffee shop in the lobby. good hotel.,4,2017,10,12
37,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"Perfect position on La Rambla.  Very curteous and helpful reception staff, comfortable room which was well appointed. The welcome bottle of Cava and chocolates for our wedding anniversary were a nice touch and much appreciated.   ",4,2017,10,11
37,Barcelona hotel with Great customer service and great location,"This hotel is right on La Rambla and completely updated. The rooms are very comfortable and modern and the hotel provides full service with a smile. We used this for a couple of nights before hopping on a cruise and it was perfectly situated to experience the sites of Barcelona. We used the Hop on Hop off bus for one of our days and the bus stop to buy the tickets and start the tours is just steps away at the top of La Rambla. 

Our trip was to celebrate birthdays and the hotel made a special point of providing us with a nice treat to celebrate with. The restaurant downstairs in the hotel has excellent food at a reasonable price. We had our breakfasts there and their buffet is very well supplied with many options along with a cook for omelets or any type of eggs. This is a hotel that I would return to.",5,2017,10,09
37,Perfect Spot,"Comfortable hotel, centrally located, everything within walking distance made this hotel a great bet for our trip to Barcelona. Rooms were clean, with nice amenities, small coffee shop in the lobby and bar restaurant connected. Staff well informed and helpful.",4,2017,10,07
37,Great Location! Good Hotel,"Stayed here for a conference and it was an outstanding location within walking distance of many of the tourist sights, the beach restaurants, marketsa nd shopping. Very good service in the hotel with high standards throughout.",4,2017,10,05
37,"Terrible room, indifferent service from staff","Arriving at Le Meridian on September 20th on a Tauck tour, I was informed my room would be very small and for just 200e additional, I could upgrade.  I declined and soon knew why.  A handicapped room, but no space to move about, especially with 2 suitcases on the floor.  I don't know how a handicapped person could maneuver about.   View from the room is a tunnel and roof.  Avoid Room 111 at the Le Meridian!  The staff I felt was indifferent and only the 1st floor maids were pleasant. If you want a 5 star hotel, stay at the Barcelona Arts hotel.  The hotel is stunning and the staff anticipates your needs.  My impression of La Meridian is of a tired hotel, living off of it's old reputation.  La Meridian is a tourist trap like so many other locations on La Ramblas.",2,2017,10,05
37,Perfect Location,"This hotel was nice, clean, quiet, and well decorated.  Most notably is the location.  This is close to the metro, close to the aerobus stop, on La Rambla.  The location could not be better.  Housekeeping was good; there was cold brew out in the mornings.  Everyone was VERY nice.",5,2017,10,03
37,Great place in a great location,"Spent two nights there.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast buffet was excellent.  Within easy walking distance of major attractions.  If you exit the front door of the hotel and go right, you are one block from a very nice entertainment area.",5,2017,10,02
37,The perfect place for us!,"We spent a week here in a Garden Terrace room.  We absolutely loved having such a wonderful outdoor space.  Most days the weather was mid 70's and sunny, so we almost always had the door open to let the sunshine into the room.  The room itself was spacious and the bed and pillows were very comfortable.  The love seat on the terrace was perfect for a mid afternoon nap.  We had room service one night at the table outside.  Barcelona is very busy, with lots of crowds to contend with most days, so the terrace was a welcome respite.  The housekeeping staff was excellent, and our room was always stocked with clean towels, etc. The biggest drawback in the room was the lighting in the bathroom.  There's a make up mirror, but it's not lit, and the lighting above the sinks was dismal.  God knows what I looked like most days when we left the room, as hair, chin hair plucking and make up were completed in very dim light!!  
   The location of this hotel is wonderful.  It was even more wonderful than we first knew, once we got rid of trying to follow Google directions when walking to various locations.  FYI...get a map from the hotel and use it instead.  There are narrow streets, and tall buildings which make for a lost signal fairly frequently.  By the time we would have a signal again, it would be telling us that the walk we were first told was 9 minutes, was now 14 minutes!  One night we walked 45 minutes to a dinner destination that was maybe 15 minutes away.  We would have laughed about it, but our legs were ready to fall off!  There are lots of restaurants near the hotel, the La Rambla is 1/2 block away, there is a grocery store next door, and the Gothic quarter is a 10 minute walk.  The grocery store sells wonderful sandwiches, wine to take back to your room, fruit, etc.  If you want more...the Boqueria of St. Joseph is about 4 blocks away.  This market is amazing!!!  Fresh fish, sausage, fruit, gelato, etc. It's open everyday except Sunday.  A word about La Rambla...it's true that the food is overpriced, but you have to at least have one meal and a sangria and do some serious people watching on the avenue. 
   The staff at this hotel are very helpful.  We emailed the hotel several times prior to our visit, and they were always prompt with their reply.  You can book tours with the concierge desk, and in most cases get your tickets to almost anything you would want to see.  
   We did eat dinner at the hotel one night, and we had room service one night.  Breakfast was included in our room rate.  The food overall was good...not great, and I would not add in the breakfast.  There are plenty of coffee shops and small restaurants around that serve breakfast and coffee, and there's the supermarket next door.  The cost was $25 per person for the breakfast, which was definitely not worth the money.  The selection was always the same, most items sit under the lights, and are luke warm at best, and not so tasty.  I did love the sausage though!  
   Before we left, my husband and I each had a massage at the hotel.  The spa was just a couple doors away from our room, but I don't think there's generally anyone on staff there.  They have a sauna, and terrace for use during your stay.  I think when you call for a service they schedule someone to be in the spa, but we never found anyone at the desk.  The massages were kind of like the breakfast...good, but not what I would call great.
   If we return to Barcelona, I would definitely book this hotel again...and that wonderful terrace!  Thank you to all the staff at Le Meridien for such an excellent job!

37,Beautiful hotel.  Great location,"Le Meridien is located in the middle of La Ramblas, very near the market and about 8 blocks from the water.  It's near restaurants and was so convenient.  The service was fantastic - it's a beautiful hotel!",5,2017,09,30
37,Las Ramblas Locale,"This historic hotel is on the Las Ramblas so it is a very busy location with a lot of traffic and people.  It is close to the old town districts, the market, cathedral, Palau de la Musica and other sights.  We had a room on the back side of the hotel so it was quiet.  Our room was smallish with a narrow entryway.  The bathroom had a wonderfully large shower with great water pressure.  The lighting was nice and bright but a challenge to figure out which switches turned on/off which lights.  You operate the elevators with your room key card.  The small restaurant/ bar served a good breakfast buffet with an omelet bar.   You can sit by the window and watch Las Ramblas crowds stroll by.",5,2017,09,29
37,excellent weekend,"Thank you Le Meridien for a wonderful weekend in Barcelona. Everything was wonderful. The breakfast, the location the helpfulness of the staff and a perfect room that was wonderfully quiet during a weekend celebration.",5,2017,09,26
37,Started our Tauck Tour here,We began our Tauck Tour in Barcelona and stayed at the Meridien for two nights.  We liked the hotel and found it to be good 4 star with room quality and customer service.  The breakfasts were very good with a wide assortment of hot and cold foods.  They had an omelette station that was pretty busy.  The location was excellent just off the Ramblas Street with all it's excitement.   I would recommend this hotel.,4,2017,09,26
37,AWESOME STAFF GREAT HOTEL GREAT LOCATION ,Really can't say enough about my experience. I am a platinum member and my suite night awards from corporate did not go through. I emailed the hotel to see what they could do. The local festival La Merce was this weekend and I did not really have high hopes. When I arrived not only did I get an wonderful upgrade but the staff treated me like a king!  They really care about the guest experience here,5,2017,09,24
37,Central to La Ramblas,"Staff was friendly, daily breakfast ample and centrally located to La Ramblas. Rooms were well equipped- we were greeted with a fruit basket and champagne which was an unexpected perk! ** Check Costco for deep discounts on pricing**",5,2017,09,22
37,Perfect spot for a Barcelona vacation.,"My wife and I stayed here on a 3 day trip to Barcelona.  The location was perfect - steps away from La Rambla, the heart of the city.  The hotel was nice, rooms were newly refurbished and the staff and service were fantastic.  If I were rating this on service alone it would have been a 5!  If we go back to Barcelona we will stay here for sure.",4,2017,09,20
37,"Fantastic Location, Great Hotel, Wonderful staff","I was there on business and stayed at Le Meridien.  The hotel is very up to date and I was impressed with the room layout and the size. I slept really well because the bed was super comfortable, the room was nice and dark at night (most rooms are not that dark). Breakfast was fantastic. Le Meridien is located in the heart of La Rambla which is the highlight of visiting Barcelona. Just steps outside the hotel is a variety of sites, including small Tapas eateries, shopping, street performers. It is close to hop-on/hop-off tour busses, within walking distance of the main square as well as the waterfront. The staff and concierge were wonderful in helping me figure out what to visit and see with help on planning a few day trips.",5,2017,09,15
37,Wonderful Staff - Great Location,"Walking to La Rambla. Once you get out of your hotel, you are in the strip itself. Close to the Cathedral as well. The room is clean. Room service was great! It was our first meal in Barcelona after a long flight! it was amazing and the price is not bad at all!",5,2017,09,14
37,Great location,"We spent 5 nights here and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Room wasn't the biggest but adequate, bed was comfortable, modern and spacious bathroom with a good supply of toiletries provided daily.
Breakfast was brilliant with a huge range of food, hot and cold, a chef on hand to cook for your tastes, plenty of fresh fruit and all the basics. Service was superb.
Great location on the La Rambla and plenty of smaller eateries close at hand, along with the markets, banks and convenience stores.
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.",4,2017,09,14
37,Fabulous,"Enjoyed a truly memorable 6 night vacation at this property. The staff were exceptionally gracious and helpful. Special thanks to Ricardo,Maria, Davinia and the entire Concierge Team for their kind support both before and during our visit. I've had nearly 200 nights in SPG properties, our stay here ranked among the best ever!",5,2017,09,13
37,Great stay,"The hotel is centrally located on Las Ramblas. Our room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. We had a balcony with chairs and a table where we enjoyed our breakfast and an early evening glass of wine after a full day of sightseeing. 
The staff was friendly and knowledgable, and offered great suggestions about where to eat and shop. There is a market conveniently located less than two minutes away. We will definitely return.",4,2017,09,12
37,THE BEST! in service and location. ABOVE AND BEYOND!,"This hotel has the best location because it's found in the area of La Rambla in Barcelona. This is the heart of Barcelona, from here you can connect via subway or walking to every single attraction in this city. The beach is walking distance. What makes this hotel THE BEST besides its location is its associates. They are TOP NOTCH in customer service. They really are THE BEST team that I've ever seen in a hotel. From the moment you arrive, you see sincere and warming smiles and the effort to make the best stay for you. Every single associate delivers quality and warmth. They really know how to make you feel pampered, cared and well. They all go ABOVE AND BEYOND!!!! It is my second time in this hotel and the service was greater than the first time. David in the front door took such good care of my husband when he cut his finger and asked him for a band aid. He went running to find first aid tools to help him with his cut. It was impressive. Sabrina, Diego, Federica and Marius were the ones who helped us at the Front Desk. They were AMAZING!!!! Very professional, caring, attentive and really delivering more than the 5 stars they have. The rooms are perfect size, super clean. The housekeeping staff were always smiling and very helpful. The restaurant offers a great breakfast buffet, fresh items and a super attentive staff. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!!! Thank you so much for your unconditional service!!!!!",5,2017,09,12
37,"modern,clean,friendly","Great hotel in a quiet street off the Rambla and close to the metro,train station,center of town,La Boqueria etc...
Our room was average in size but the bathroom was big with double shower,Loved it.
Great staff from the porters to the reception.This is what we remember the most about this busy hotel.
My special thanks to Marius at the front desk,he was such a delight and so patient with our grandson.
a wonderful stay!",5,2017,09,08
37,Excellent facilities & service,"We were on a Tauck tour which booked us in Le Meridien.  Due to an accident, we were unable to continue with the tour.  We had to spend 4 uncharted days in the hotel waiting for a flight back to US.  There is no way to describe the outstanding treatment we received from the staff.  Being in some pain required the use of a wheel chair, and there always was an English speaking person to push and guide and call taxi etc.  The facilities are just like US, the food is better than most US hotels, plus the location is central to the historic surroundings.",5,2017,09,08
37,Amazing staff and a fantastic location!,"I love SPG hotels, booked this place for a couple of nights recently. The location of the hotel is amazing, right in the middle of the tourist district and easily walkable to restaurants and bars. The staff was super accommodating, we arrived very early in the morning at 10 am and they were nice enough to give us our room because were tired and jet lagged! Even let us extend our check out time to 2 PM. Nice clean rooms and excellent service. I must admit I didn't spend too much time in the hotel so can't comment on the amenities. If you want great location this is the place to stay!",5,2017,09,08
37,"Great hotel, nice breakfast and good reception team","Our 2nd stay at this hotel. Very well located near to all the things to do by the ramblas promenade. We arrived friday evening and were helped by a friendly receptionist that spoke good english and the checkin went well. 

We immidiately got advise about renting of bikes, where we could eat, and really from a local perspective. the room was clean, quite spacious - lovely bed and good shower. Also very much like the amenities (such as the shampoo, body wash) 

The breakfast is also nice, friendly service and were very welcomed for the 3 days we stayed here. 

Also make sure to go to the coffee bar at the entrance of the hotel. the barista makes a lovely cupoccino, and if you like a flat white (which isnt on the menu) go and enjoy that. And eat a creme brule eclair ",5,2017,09,05
37,"Central, situated right on Las Ramblas","Nice hotel, clean, modern and very central to everything. Lots of shopping and restaurants in the area.  It was noisy at night so if you are a light sleeper make sure you are higher up, although I'm not sure that would drown out the cars or the revellers.",4,2017,09,03
37,Excellent location,"The hotel is situated just off Las Ramblas and is within walking distance of tourist sites, restaurants, shops, and the metro. The hotel is clean, with friendly staff, comfortable beds, and large rooms (for European standards). Breakfast provides a good selection of food, including cheese, cold cuts, eggs, fruit, and baked goods. The lobby is cool and inviting.",4,2017,09,02
37,A Most Majestic and Magical Stay in the Mediterranean Suite at Le M Barcelona,"As a Platinum member of the SPG hotel network I have had the pleasure of visiting beautiful places, but a recent visit to this hotel was truly special. Thanks to Marius and the staff for exceptional service and attention. 

The Mediterranean suite is extraordinary. Imagine having a private rooftop cabana with views of the Barcelona skyline including La Sagrada Familia cathedral. Entertaining 8-15 friends on your terrace for appetizers and cocktails before leaving for a late dinner and dancing in Eixample and Las Ramblas. Wake up the next morning and take in the August Barcelona sun lying on 1 of 2 lounge chairs then enjoy a quick cool rinse in the outdoor shower for a refresher before enjoying the sights and sounds of Catalunya.

The spacious bathroom is a luxurious serene retreat amidst the hustle and bustle of Barcelona. It accommodates a walk in closet, two sinks, spa sized tub, Mediterranean tiles and generously sized Malin & Goetz products. 

For the discriminating, experienced traveler Le Meridien Barcelona will be the home you have always deserved at a price well worth its value.

37,Amazing Stay,"We Love Le Meridian Hotels, and usually stay there when we can. Hotel in Barcelona didn't disappoint.we had a great experience. We traveled with kids and had two suites on the 6th floor, both with roof top balconies (outdoor shower was a hit with my kids). Rooms were big, clean, loved the decor. Service was great, and location is a huge plus. We are coming back next year and definitely will stay there again!",5,2017,08,29
37,Summer Vacation with our Teenagers,"We loved our stay there, The location was great, right on Las Rambus (excuse my spelling!), rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was great.  What we were most impressed with was the staff, so nice, a gentleman behind the desk recommended his favorite restaurant and it became ours!",5,2017,08,28
37,Small Rooms,We stayed at this hotel two weeks ago. It is a genuine five-star hotel in all respects except one: the rooms are very small. What you have here  is a five-star hotel with three-star rooms. We will not stay at this hotel again.,3,2017,08,28
37,"Right on the Rambla, great breakfast, excellent service.","I was in Barcelona for a week long meeting, and couldn't have asked for a better location.  I also really liked the funky decor.   Breakfast was lovely, with a wide variety of options and the coffee was excellent.   My only disappointment was the view from my room, which was essentially a wall.  Well luckily I didn't spend much time in the room.   I was also really impressed by the towels.  I have long hair, and many hotel towels just don't cut it.  These were soft, large and fluffy and made me very happy.",5,2017,08,27
37,Incredible Service and Very Nice Hotel,"Beautiful hotel right off of Las Ramblas.  The location is perfect for seeing the sights of Barcelona. The staff were so helpful in every regard. Alvira and Salvadore took such exceptional care of our group -- 40 plus of us -- and the rest of the staff, as well, especially after the terrorist attack. Staff fed us, helped us deal with the aftermath of the event, and even helped us get our luggage to our bus many blocks away the next day--despite the real emotions that they were all dealing with after this horrendous event. The service and care shown were above and beyond the call of duty. Muchas gracias!!",5,2017,08,26
37,Amazing staff and great location,"Staff was very friendly and accommodating very special given the time frame of visit - 2 days after the attack at Las Rambla. The staff was the best part of the visit. On our last day, the manager sent an assortment of dried fruits and chocolates for appreciation of our stay. 

The location is also amazing, with easy to walk areas in the gothic quarter and the hop on hop off bus or metro. 

Hotel itself is modern, with good amenities, comfortable beds.  Easy to take taxi to hotel from airport. Most take credit cards.  Will repeat if returning to Barcelona. ",4,2017,08,26
37,Wonderful stays in Barcelona,"Pros:
1. The bed and pillows are nice and comfortable when sleeping.
2. Location is good (near Plaça de Catalunya) and there are lots of restaurants and shops around or by walk.
3. The breakfast in hotel (CENTONZE restaurant) is good.
4. Services are good.

Cons:
Nothing.",4,2017,08,25
37,Super location ,"One side of the Hotel has awful view , rooms are small but nicely done . Staff is very helpful and courteous .
Location is just unbelievable . At the heart of Barcelona , walkable to all places 
Just near is a well stocked Carrefour 

Restaurants r all near",4,2017,08,24
37,"Wonderful staff, great facility, and top-notch location","I had researched where my wife and 2 year old daughter would stay for quite some time.  We initially wanted to stay at the Ritz Carlton however as much as I wanted to stay there, my heart kept telling my brain to keep checking Le Meridien.  Let me tell you, I'm glad I chose Le Meridien over Ritz Carlton.  Why?

First, it's the location.  The hotel is situated right beside the famed Las Rambla street where tourist flock to visit.  Yes, it's very unfortunate that the attacks occurred within that street but it is what it is.  There is a massive supermarket right beside the hotel where you can purchase food, wine, water, etc.  This alone can save you some money by buying whatever you need there.  Also, it's a 5 minute walk to another famed institution, the La Boqueria.  Families, foodies, and tourist has to go to the Boqueria.  The hotel is in the center of everything.  It's all within 1 to 1.5 miles of all tourist attraction.  That's only a 20-30 minute walk depending on how fast you actually walk.  For me, enjoy and savor the city.

Staff is very accommodating and helpful.   The hotel is clean and modern.  The standard room however is a bit small to my liking however I booked this using my Chase rewards so it was free on my end so I can't complain much.  For couples, it should be sufficient but for families, it may be a little tight.  

The shower was magnificent, they have a rainfall-style shower head that blast you with the hottest water, it's something that everyone needs to end the day after a long day of shopping, eating, and walking.  A/C ensured that the room stayed cold during the heatwave.  

I would stay here again.",5,2017,08,22
37,"Location, Service and Ambiance","I stayed at the hotel for a long weekend with my husband.  We were meeting friends staying at another hotel.  The location of the hotel is perfect.  It became our central meeting place.  The rooms are well designed, clean and modern.  The service was consistent and polite.",4,2017,08,20
37,Great location and service,This is our second time staying here. The service is good and location is Central. If you are SPG Platinum you get free valet parking. The beds are a little hard. The room service food isn't good. It tasted all frozen.,4,2017,08,19
37,Location and service ,"Amazing location, just in the middle of the la Rambla, with carrefour and starbucks are steps away. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was ok, but not enough options. The rooms are good and clean, however there are not enough ventilation in the toilet, it always felt very humid. Other than that, amazing. ",4,2017,08,18
37,Location was amazing,"Service was Amazing! 
Location was Amazing. 
Staff was very helpful! 

Check in was very busy, but hotel was fully staffed and prepared. Although the check in line was growing, I never felt rushed. I was thoughtful to ask touristy questions later after the rush of guest after enjoying a sangria at the bar. 

Building is older. Beautiful and gorgeous staircase. Wifi was kinda weak in our room. Interior design was kinda outdated. 

Overall- great stay. 
Would stay again!",4,2017,08,18
37,Great Location and Awesome Breakfast,"Our room was not ready upon our arrival, so we spent the first of what would be several very pleasant afternoons in the restaurant/bar. Things didn't start out so well, as we were given a key to a room that was already occupied. Our second attempt was more successful as we were given a clean, albeit very small room overlooking the Ramblas. It made for great people-watching yet given the proximity to the street, it was surprisingly quiet. Wonderful bathroom with a great shower, nice amenities and quality towels.
The best part of the property was the breakfast buffet each morning, which featured an array of all types of the expected as well as surprisingly inventive morning treats. Service was superb, very thoughtful and kind. I'm still dreaming about the tiny ham toasts and the best muffins I've ever tasted. 
Because the hotel is frequented by cruise and tour lines, the concierge is often busy. It might be helpful to have additional staff available to support in this capacity.  There is a spa area on the top floor that has a kind of plunge jacuzzi but it would have been great to have a plunge pool instead, especially when the temperature hit 104 degrees F.",4,2017,08,15
37,Such a delight ,"Was pleasantly delighted at this market . Very tight and crowded excellent place to get your pocket dipped. (BE STREET SMART).
Lots a variety of fruit,sweets,juices, meat and seafood. 
Had the kids with us so couldn't stop too long . 
Will be back without the rug rats so we can enjoy the delights of this market. Posted some pics ",5,2017,08,15
37,"Fantastic location, great staff!","We chose Le Meridien as part of a package trip -- very, very happy we did.  The location was perfect for us, particularly since this was our first visit to Barcelona.  We were able to walk everywhere from the hotel -- Sagrada Familia, Montjuic, the beach, the park, Barrio Gotic.  Everything seemed really close and we were in the middle of things.

The hotel itself was outstanding.  Lots of options at breakfast, nice bar at night.  When we checked in, the staff upgraded our room to a private terrace (thanks Eduardo!), so that was obviously a huge bonus.  And since we were celebrating an anniversary, the staff went out of their way to congratulate us.

All in all a beautiful hotel, with really friendly, helpful people in a fantastic location.  As the start of our trip to Spain, this was about as perfect as it could have been for us.",5,2017,08,13
37,Quality luxury,"Very nice hotel to stay in, pleasant atmosphere and very friendly staff.  The room was clean and the amenities were nice.  We had to wait a while at check in to get our room because they were running late with the cleaning.",4,2017,08,12
37,Wei,"It was our first time to visit Barcelona. We had a wonderful and unforgettable time in this historical and beautiful city including the hotel Le Meridien we stayed. I'd like to strong recommend visitors to stay at this hotel for the following reasons:
1) people--the staff here are awesome to us. Anna, customer relationship director, is a good representative of the hotel staffs. She is not just experience and professional, but is also passionate to her job to provide the best quality of services to customers to make our vacation safe, rich, efficient and fruitful. With her patient and customer orientation recommendation to our 3 day trip, my son learned arts and history of Spain and Europe. My wife was very happy with shopping. And I enjoyed the best food and architecture. I have traveled many countries and as a platinum SPG member, I stayed in many hotels. To be honest with you, the hotel was not the most luxurious and expensive. But the service was in the high tier hotel standard. People are friendly and proactive to help customers. I am very impressed! 
2) location: the hotel is at a center to radiate to landmark museums, high end and popular shopping centers including the famous fruit and seafood market! The subway stations are within a hundred yard range. There are also good local restaurant behind the street of the hotel.
3) Activities: the hotel sponsored some summer activities to create a community environment to let customers socialize and share travel experience. 
I wish I share more experience but I have to stop here because we are departing to other countries to continue our vacation! ",5,2017,08,07
37,Great location and for families,"This hotel is in the best location in Barcelona at Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya. We stayed here with our family of four in two connecting rooms. We loved walking out the door each morning and either being able to walk to major sites (Picasso museum, cathedral, ramblas market) or get to the metro easily. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were nice. We were also able to checkin very early when we arrived from the states. It was a great experience.",4,2017,08,06
37,"Excellent hotel, dodgy area","We loved the service and our room at Le Meridien in Barcelona.  In particular, the concierge was very helpful for finding reservations, babysitters for our kids, attractions, etc.  The spa and gym were nice too, though I wish there had been a pool.

My only negative for this hotel was its location on Las Ramblas.  The area full of tourists, bad food, thieves and tchotchkes for sale.

I would recommend staying at the hotel, but plan to get out of Las Ramblas area as much as possible.",4,2017,08,06
37,Fantastic in every respect,Wonderful hotel. Perfectly situated in the heart of the action. Walking distance to all that is great. Clean and light rooms. Delightful and attentive service. Particular kudos to Monica who was of great assistance to us. Can't recommend this hotel enough.,5,2017,08,04
37,Centrally Located to Shopping area and transport to most attractions,Nice clean hotel and centrally located to wide range of activities. The Concierge are very helpful and they can book you to any attractions you may want to visit. It is an expensive hotel to stay in with minimum facilities. Food is not great and I advise to have breakfast in any of the many of the cafe's nearby. I had a very bad experience with respect to my booked rooms. Triple room joining a double room at the end of the Hallway at the 3rd floor. Too much noise apparently was coming from the supermarket next door. There is a common wall between my room and the supermarket. I had five days of noise (rolling noise) starting at 3am. The hotel staff did nothing until I lost my patience on my last night when I heard the chiselling and hammering noises from next door. When I asked for the hotel manager he was very apologetic and offered me 2000 Starpoints (wow). It made me more angry.,3,2017,08,04
37,Last stop on a family trip from France to Spain,"Barcelona was the last stop on our family summer vacation from Paris to Spain.  We only had 2 nights in Barcelona unfortunately, but chose Le Meridian as it seemed like a good location.
It is centrally located, but it's a bit too close to the La Rambla area.  There were massive crowds 1/2 a block away and the area was loud throughout the night.  It felt a bit like Times Square in NY.  We did like La Rambla for shopping and to get a feel for the culture, but would have preferred to stay in a hotel a bit further away from the heart of the action.
As far as the hotel, it was what you would expect in a traditional European hotel.  Relatively nice, very small rooms, historic.  It served our purpose as a central spot from which to explore, but I would not stay there again.",3,2017,08,02
37,Great hotel right in the middle of La Ramblas,"Hotel is nicely located in the middle of La Ramblas. You're within walking distance (less than 20 mins) from all the touristic sites. For those wanting to take a taxi, access to and from the hotel is very convenient. You have everything you can think of within walking distance from the hotel including a supermarket, 24-hour pharmacy, coffee shops, gift stores, etc. Hotel staff were super nice. Concierge desk was great in getting tickets for the different activities.",5,2017,07,31
37,excellent location right on Las Ramblas,"We stayed here for two nights in mid July.  The location is excellent, right on Las Ramblas, about 3 or 4 blocks from Placa Catalunya right in the center of town.  Many of the Gaudi museums were within walking distance of the hotel.  I am Starwood gold, and was told i was upgraded when we checked in.  Our hotel was on the first floor right above the street and also right next to the elevator.  As this did not seem like an upgrade, i asked at the front desk, and they said the first floor was the only floor that had been renovated so far, so apparently it was an upgrade!  The room was nice, not great, and was on the expensive side, but the location made up for this.",4,2017,07,29
37,Great hotel in top Barcelona location,"This was an excellent hotel.  It has it all:
1. Great location off La Rambla
2. Beautiful hotel and friendly staff
3. Well appointed rooms
4. Good restaurant and bar
5. CLose to numerous other bars and restaurants
6. Walking distance to Catalunya square",5,2017,07,29
37,Nice hotel if you're looking for convenience of the city!,"We stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for 3 nights.  Upon arriving at this hotel, the staff greeted us in a very friendly way. Checking in was easy.  The room was also clean and spacious enough.  Bathroom was clean and spacious too!  Throughout our stay, the property was kept clean and nice and the staff was very professional and polite. 

We had breakfast there during our stay.  The selection isn't a lot but decent food. Omelette wasn't so good--- in my personal opinion. But the croissants Were pretty good! 

Here's what we didn't like about the hotel: location.  While we always like to be in the center of the city and like the convenience of being able to walk to places while we stay, we thought where the hotel was situated was bit too busy.  Carrer Las ramblas was very touristy and crowded.  Plus we could just feel the air pollution in the center of the las ramblas--- and people smoking everywhere went on the street. While we felt relieved once stepping into the hotel, we didn't really get that sense of relaxation because of the location.  I think it's because the buildings are so tight and closed the city , perhaps there really wasn't any outlets.  I suffered headache every time I stepped out of the hotel.  Next time we revisit Barcelona, we will likely look for a hotel in gothic square or near casa battlo.  

Ahhhh we miss Barcelona! ",4,2017,07,29
37,Superb hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"The hotel is located on La Rambla street. Near Catalunia Square. Gothic area is within 5 minutes of walk. I had a room with the private spacy terrace. Despite the fact that La Rambla is a noisy place I hardly felt it. The room is big, clean, quiet. Services are at high level and the staff is great. But the best experience is an open terrace, where you can relax on the sun, take showers - in the very centre of the city! There is no need to go to the beach even! Great spa is also offered. This is absolutely worth money spent. I highly recommend to stay in this hotel and specifically in the room with the terrace. Great experience.",5,2017,07,28
37,Great location and service,Location is steps from the biggest and busiest street la Ramblas. You can easily walk everywhere from your hotel. Service was fantastic. Our first room was only ok so they graciously showed us several others. Our adult children had a fantastic large room with an extra large bathroom with tub. Not all rooms have tubs. The lobby cafè served an affordable lunch selection that was quick and satisfying. Rooftop jacuzzi and outdoor lounge area was lovely. No pool though. Massage I had was fantastic. ,4,2017,07,28
37,Sister trip,"Hotel was VERY conveniently located, comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Right on La Rambla, near some great restaurants and about one block from the tourist pick-up for tours and for the airport shuttle. We had a fabulous stay and I would recommend this hotel.  We walked all over the city and used public transportation easily.",5,2017,07,27
37,Tradition and modernity,"Meridien Barcelona is ideally located next to the Ramblas in typical El Barrio Chino district.
Luxury comfort, relaxed atmosphere, functional facilities, cozy accommodation, traditional architecture, contemporary style, hearty breakfast buffet, first class service ... may be not surprising for a Meridien hotel but this will be worth the chain standards. 
I particularly liked interesting contrast between hotel modernity and popular historic surrounding neighborhood.",4,2017,07,27
37,Perfect location!,"Le Meridien is right along La Rambla, the popular shopping/restaurant strip in Barcelona. It's practically beside La Boqueria, a market with delicious eaterie and cheese and jamon shops. It's also right beside a supermarket (Carrefour). It's walking distance to Plaza Cataluna and Passeig de Gracia, where major shops are located. You can also walk around Barrio Gotica where you have small alleys with endless shops and restaurants. Despite being right smack in one of Barcelona's busiest sections, the noise didn't reach our room even if we were only on the 2nd floor. My only complaint was, we got a triple room and it was a bit too small. A king sized bed and a pull out bed. We hardly had space to open our luggages. When we checked in (check in time was supposedly at 3pm but the room was ready at 4pm), the third bed was not made yet and concierge told us it would be ready by 6pm. When we got back at 10pm, the bed was not yet made and I had to call reception again. It took housekeeping 30 mins to sort this out. Sadly, the pull out bed had only a thin mattress and was not comfortable at all. For the price, we expected proper beds.

Aside from this, service at Le Meridien is excellent! Check in and check out were seamless and the staff is always at your service. Even the porters made sure your bags were attended to and kept safe, during check in and check out.

Breakfast was delicious and had decent selections. They also have a section where you can specify how you want your eggs done.

I would definitely stay here again. Best location when in Barcelona",5,2017,07,26
37,Great location!,"We stayed here recently and the location is absolutely perfect! The Hotel is located at the top of La Rambla and walking distance to many attractions.
The breakfast at the hotel was delicious with great service.
We were in a suite and found it to be very comfortable.

I highly recommend staying here and would love to return.",4,2017,07,25
37,Fantastic hotel,"Le Meridien Barcelona is in an excellent position on La Ramblas.  The staff and service in the hotel is first class.
The breakfast buffet is superb with something to suit everyone. We never had to wait for a table at breakfast which we sometimes find in other hotels. Orange juice and coffee were always brought promptly to the table.
our room was on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor as my husband is a SPG member. It was spotless and made up every day of our 7 night stay.
The cocktails in Le Pop Bar are excellent . We did not eat in the restaurant but heard good reports.",5,2017,07,24
37,Exceptional hotel in perfect location.,"Le Meridien is an excellent hotel in the perfect location close to everything. The staff and service was excellent. Attentive, helpful and informative. Superb restaurant with excellent breakfast buffet. Upon booking, I mentioned that we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and they suprised us with a bottle of champagne, fruit and a lovely card wishing us a happy anniversary. We were very pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend this excellent hotel.",5,2017,07,23
37,Beautiful Hotel But Problem Not Handled Well,"I wanted to give this hotel a much higher rating as the staff was all very kind and the hotel itself was well-appointed.  Starting with the good - the lobby and front desk staff were very polite and friendly.  The restaurant was also good and the prices were reasonable.  The hotel was very clean and the room were comfortable.  I did run into a problem, however, with the air conditioner in my room.

At around 12am, I started hearing water leak from the ceiling.  I called the front desk and they sent someone up quickly.  He cleaned up the mess and told me that the leak would stop and that it was due to the humidity level inside vs. outside.  I was woken up again around 1:30 am to even more dripping - this time the water was leaking must faster.  I called and asked to be moved to another room.  It took about 30 minutes for someone to find me another room.  When they did, they told me I had been upgraded - but in reality, I was given a room that had been recently renovated, but with a view of a wall and air conditioners.  When I asked to be moved to a similar room, I was given a handicapped room that was right on Las Ramblas and quite noisy.  Because I was too tired to move again, I accepted the room.

The icing on the cake was that I had left a bottle of wine in my old room and when I asked about it the next day, they said they did not have the wine and did not offer to replace it.  I was never contacted by a manager or offered an apology for having to move rooms.

Like I said - a very nice hotel but they could have handled the situation must better.",3,2017,07,20
37,Perfect Location For First Time Travelers to Barcelona,"Our stay at Le Meridien got off to a rocky start due to jet lag, inability to speak Catalonian or Spanish, misunderstanding of Catalonian culture, and the sheer overwhelming and the exhausting atmosphere of the epicenter of tourists visiting Barcelona ). However, this location proved to be perfect for navigating the city with a little help from the wonderful and caring staff at Le Meridien. Alex, who runs the hotel, proved to be impeccable at performing his job of making us feel at home and welcome rather than alienated and overwhelmed by this magnificent yet tourist overrun city. He took time and went above and beyond his job description to personally meet with us and help us save this precious trip with our 3 teenagers from becoming a disaster. Without his recommendations for restaurants, site seeing, and interacting with locals we would have been left frustrated and confused and likely would not have ventured off La Ramblas. Yes La Ramblas is exciting and picturesque but not without pickpockets, hordes of cruise ship passengers, tacky T-shirt and ""souvenir"" shops, and overpriced tasteless microwaved ""tapas"" restaurants. A notable exception was Le Pop Cocktail Bar located in Le Meridien where we had a memorable long lunch with exquisite food and even better service provided by the manager ( so sorry I cannot recall his name but he was a lovely tall young man with a ready smile who spoke perfect English with a lovely accent ). He treated us like family and gave us a precious memory of that long lingering lunch in Barcelona with our children we will never forget. The hotel is safe, clean and quiet and feels luxurious in contrast to the noisy chaos of La Ramblas. I wish to thank Alex and the manager of Le Pop Cocktail Bar and Restaurant for their hard work and sincere heartfelt effort to make our stay in Barcelona comfortable and memorable. Their efforts meant a lot to weary travelers like ourselves. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2017,07,20
37,Great Stay!,"We stayed here for a few days before and after a cruise. The service was wonderful and the location is perfect for walking to attractions like the Gothic Quarter, Casa Batllo. Sagrada Familia, the market, etc. Free tickets to Palau Guelle were included with our room. The rooms are modern and spotless- one had a HUGE tub to soak in and the other had a MASSIVE shower. We arrived in the early morning both times and they held our luggage and called as soon as a room was available (well before the 3:00 check in both times). We will stay here again if we ever return to Barcelona!",5,2017,07,19
37,Good location and restaurant,"La Rambla is the heart of Barcelona and this hotel is right there. It cannot get any better.  The check in process can be definitely made smoother. Luggage handling or lack of it another issue. Concierge desk is very helpful. The hotel has a very nice restaurant with good food and view of the La Rambla. Lack of pool is a bit disappointing. Overall, a pretty good experience.",4,2017,07,18
37,Worst service ever. A two star hotel at a five star price.,"Location is excellent. Rest of it sucks. I made my reservation at least four weeks in advance. I made several requests. We arrived at the hotel at around 10 am. Omar, our check in guy told me that they are only requests.  I had a gut feeling that I had booked the wrong place.The early check in was twelve noon for room one. We booked two rooms for my wife and the kids. The second room was ready at 3.30 pm. We called several times to find out why it was not ready but was given a  different answer every time. 
So we checked into our first set of rooms. Another request we had was the city view and connecting rooms. Their city view was the view of a back street. The manager said that is the city view, you have to request Ramlas view. And the kids room across the hall. The manager he said he could offer me the Ramlbas view which I thought I was getting at the time I made the reservation and a connecting room but I had to pay 50 euros per night , I agreed  for the better rooms. We  had booked a 6 night stay.
       The rooms were not clean and definitely not five star. The concierge and front desk did not return several of my calls.
      Tonight I spoke the front desk to find out why our room was not cleaned after the maid said she would be back, the front desk reply was maybe she did not understand. Same situation 2 nights ago. The beds and sheets, more like 2 stars. 
      The wifi was free but slow. There was paid wifi.
      I would not recommend this hotel. Stay away. 
I have never written a review before and have travelled for the last 40 years.",2,2017,07,15
37,Adequate and right off the Ramblas,"Pros:  Right off the Ramblas, central to all venues and museums, concierge team was fabulous, front desk was competent, taxis always waiting.  Breakfast buffet was terrific.  

Cons:  First night right for junior suite was 670 Euro to host 3 family members.  We were a group of 5 traveling together via a Costco booking but could not get the contract rate for the first night.",4,2017,07,12
37,Incredible service. Great location!,We really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is very well located. The concierge is super helpful and the restaurant is excellent. Recent updates to hotel. As Platinum members the manager personally greeted us at breakfast. made us feel special. What more can I say? Our stay was perfect.,5,2017,07,11
37,"Fantastic hotel, perfect location.","The location of this hotel is perfect, right on La Rambla which makes it close to almost everything you would want to see. Lovely spacious rooms, great breakfast, fantastic roof top jacuzzi and super staff. Cannot recommend this hotel enough and mainly because nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They recommended nearby restaurants, which all turned out to be amazing. We booked a trip up to the mountains with them that was actually cheaper than if we had booked it direct, the concierge team are really first class.
We safe spg platinum members and were given a room upgrade and welcome gift and easy check-in/out at a special counter.
For me, perfect place to stay in Barcelona.
",5,2017,07,11
37,Looking Forward A Return Visit!,Absolutely a perfect location!  There was a little mix up with our reservation but we were courteously accommodated at the last minute by one of their representatives.  The hotel is not huge but well appointed in every way and with a very professional staff who made our three day stay most enjoyable.  Our room was extremely comfortable and overlooked Las Ramblas with all it's excitement and goings-on.  We were assisted with our tour bookings without being rushed and the tours suggested were right on point.  Their little breakfast cafe had various offerings to satisfy any palette.    Definitely worth a return visit!,5,2017,07,10
37,"Very spacious, good location, great for families",We stayed here before boarding our Mediterranean cruise. It was not cheap but the price was worth it. It is a great location right on La Ramblas but it has a side entrance so you are not right in the middle of the crowds when you enter/exit. It was just a short walk to La Boqueria market which was very entertaining for the family. It's also close to the cruise port. The best thing was the room was very large. It had an adjoining living room with a fold out sofa for our kids. This was no ordinary fold out sofa. It was king size and very comfortable (no bars poking you in the back).,5,2017,07,10
37,Great hotel and even better staff!,"Perfect place for our stay in Barcelona! Situated right off La Rambla, we were close to many major sites by foot, taxi, or subway, allowing us to maximize our time in town. The staff was absolutely exceptional. I had reached out ahead of our stay asking for an early check in, knowing it can never be guaranteed but hoping they could accommodate us as I'm quite pregnant and need to rest often. Not only was there a room ready for us upon check in, we also had mini hotel slippers waiting for us in our room as a gift to our baby-to-be! We were so touched by this gesture. The front desk staff and concierge were also a huge help with everything, from adjusting dinner reservations, to making tapas recommendations and even finding an authentic Italian restaurant to satiate my pizza pregnancy craving (Luigi's is fantastic!). Our room was comfortable and well appointed and we never heard any noise from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla below. We had a fantastic stay!",5,2017,07,09
37,Great Location,"Best part of this hotel is you're right in the center of the city along La Rambla. Hotel itself was nice, but nothing mind blowing. Staff was pleasant. Rooms were a bit on the small side, but that's to be expected given the historical neighborhood. ",4,2017,07,08
37,Not a W...,"Started a trip with friends in Barcelona.  Great location just off La Rambla. Lobby was nice but basic. Service was pleasant but I can say they went above and beyond.  The room was not what you'd expect in a W or other newer high end hotel but on par with older European hotels.  Unfortunately, our room was on a low floor overlooking a rooftop and within feet of the next building.  Would usually request a better room, but since we were only there two nights and planned on being out in Barcelona most of the time, I didn't bother upgrading our room. Was definitely not happy having to take a cold showers as the water never really got hot.  Also woke one morning to the noise of construction.  Management didn't seem to know about it but were apologetic.   Overall not my best experience but not my worst. Would recommend if you are looking for a great location but not the high end of service/price.  Hope this was helpful.",4,2017,07,07
37,Best location ,"Stayed 2 nights at this hotel , excellent location 
Excellent service, very friendly staff.
Located just off Larambla, very close to the Market. 10 min walk to the beach and shopping area.
Spacious rooms, though can be very noisy at night with all the activities at the La Rambla.
Would for sure stay again at this hotel .",5,2017,07,04
37,Great Location!,"Great location, right off La Ramblas, close to the Plaza Cataluna and the market. Short walk to the Gothic district, Port Vell and the beach.  The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff ready to assist. The room and bed were comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and had a great shower.  The street noise gets loud in the morning, but its Las Ramblas, so its expected.  Ask for a higher floor is this will bother you.  Had a great time!",5,2017,07,03
37,Davide is my hero!,"The night staff upon arrival saved the day for me. I had left my purse (which held my passport and my phone) in the taxi cab we took from the airport to Le Meridien late in the evening. I immediately noticed my purse was missing and Davide immediately ran out to catch the taxi but the taxi driver,Speedy Gonzalez, had sped off. Davide got on the Telly and started calling all the cab companies to try and locate the driver who had my purse. He had nothing to go on as we hadn't even noticed what Company it was.  I thought all was lost as we made it to our beautiful room in the hotel. Even though I was pretty stressed out I was able to get off to slumberland when the phone awoke me a couple hours later and, alas, Davide, my hero, had located my purse and the taxi driver was holding it in the lobby.  Everything was intact! Thank you humanity! Needless to say the staff at this hotel is exceptional from the front to the rest of the house. The level of their professionalism is extremely high. This was my third visit to this hotel over the last 15 years and I will surely return if ever in Barcelona again.",5,2017,07,03
37,Best location!,"Situated in the most convenient dot!
La Rambla , the busiest street is just few steps away.
Friendly staffs was there to greet you whenever you walk in/out.
Comfortable bed and clean room.
Good recommendation for food outlets by the staff!
Will be back",4,2017,06,28
37,Great Service & Location,"Recently completed a stay at the Le Meridien and had a great time.  I checked in earlier and they did not have any rooms, so I had breakfast and came back and they were able to find me a room (which was fantastic).  The rooms are quite large and I would suggest trying to get a room that doesn't face the main street.  The service was fantastic - everyone was very quick regarding anything you needed.  I ended up leaving early and had pre-paid a reservation (which I was ok with - just didnt want problems leaving early), but the front desk took care of everything.  Great location - walkable to many of the attractions or you can use MyTaxi to get around (much easier if you want to pay with a cc).  I love Starwood Hotels and went to the W for dinner - which was essentially a club.  Great if you are a early to mid 20s on vacation, but would prefer Le Meridien for business or family travel.",5,2017,06,23
37,My wife and I traveled to Barcelona to join our Norwegian Cruise Lines Mediterranean Cruise,"When booking hotels, especially on our wedding anniversary, I like to show my bride of 41 years ""a good time"" in a ""nice hotel"". The Meridien Barcelona is an exceptional way to do this. It is located in downtown Barcelona on La Rambla Avenue, a combination pedestrian/Car thoroughfare in the heart of Barcelona. Le Meridien Hotel has wonderful modern rooms, spacious and very well appointed. We had a corner suite overlooking a nearby pedestrian street filled with cafes, restaurants, specialty stores and street performers - so we had a free show anytime we looked out our window. The hotel restaurant was wonderful, full bar - amazing food, especially the breakfast buffet. The front desk staff spoke several languages, and Concierge had so many tips for us, we had no problem finding something to do every moment. The Farmers' market was 2 city blocks away, the harbour was 6 city blocks away and an easy walk to go all the way to the shopping mall located at the pier/yacht club area of the harbour. If you want a perfect location to enjoy a couple days in Barcelona, look no further than Le Meridien - it is worth the cost and it is a perfect place to start your adventure in Barcelona.",5,2017,06,21
37,Nice location,"Strategically located near la ramblas & plaza catalunya 

Good housekeeping service; good receptions team

Excellent concierge service especially mr Ricardo & ms Anna guest relations manager

We Will come again

37,Probably About As Good As You Can Get,"Barcelona is a big town, and the city 'center' is too - There are numerous districts (La Rambla, Gothic, Born, waterfront...) to consider in choosing where you want to stay.

This hotel is very nicely appointed - modern, clean, excellent desk service - on La Rambla, just a couple blocks below Plaza Cataluña (where the 'good' shopping begins, if you're so inclined). It's a good location, and a fine hotel.",5,2017,06,21
37,Convenient Location,"Le Meridien was well located in the Gathic Quarter providing us with convenient access for the two days of sightseeing and activities we had preplanned.  The lounge and restaurant were nicely situated to provide ample opportunity for ‘people watching’ those strolling La Rambia while we enjoyed tapas and libations.  We utilized Starwood points to splurge on a “suite”, which sported a very modern décor.  The bedroom was quiet and well-appointed, the living area was attractive, but not at all comfortable.  Our room, which was very large by European standards, overlooked that same boulevard, which was nice until the later hours.  Then, became very noisy with late night revelers.  There were no concierge privileges, complimentary breakfast, nor snacks and beverages that we have previously enjoyed at accommodations included in the Starwood network for members.  There was a small rooftop deck off the Spa area that provided a nice view with limited seating.  The staff was mostly helpful and friendly.  However we had forgotten our electrical adaptor so we were gouged $10 Euros for one.  Pricey, but required for a necessary medical device.  We paid the staff member who delivered the adaptor to our room, then found we had been charged again upon checkout.   We don’t recommend these accommodations for the price/points required.  Average rating for consideration of the convenient location against the points made above.",3,2017,06,20
37,You are paying for the location,"For being a Le Meridien property, this hotel is a disappointment to us. Our room was on the first floor, which the reception told us supposedly to be recently an updated floor.  But the room was small, cheaply updated, and not a five star hotel quality. Towels and bathrobes were thin and weak.  One thing that drove us crazy was the light in the closet went on and off automatically every time we walked passed it (and it is located in the middle of the bed and the bathroom!).

The breakfast buffet was average as well, but there are plenty of selections.  The reception was efficient and helpful, but we could not say the same about the concierge service.  One of our 5 nights of staying there, we asked the concierge a recommendation on a restaurant for a dinner as we wanted to eat paella.  She sent us to a very touristy and expensive restaurant (we don't mind paying premium price as long the food is excellent, but this time the quality of the food was far below the price).  You could tell that the whole restaurant was full of tourists like us.  It was as a matter of fact the worst restaurant that we went for our meal while we were in Barcelona.  
And when my husband spoke the next day to the same concierge to ask what were the transportation options to go to Park Guell since there was a taxi strike, she laughed at my husband's concern about taking public transportation (as it is a soft target for terrorists).  I used to work in the Front Office in the hotels and even though you don't agree with your guest's opinion, you shouldn't laugh in front of your guests's face.  It's unprofessional.
If you need any recommendations for restaurants for dinner etc, my advice is to ask the reception, the gentleman that checked us in recommended us an excellent tapas place!

The best thing that has going for this hotel is it's location. It's almost in front of La Rambla and like 5 minutes walking to the Placa de Catalunya, where you can take the hop-on hop-off bus.",3,2017,06,19
37,Great hotel in perfect location ,"Best hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Stayed four nights easy access to restaurants, shopping, metro & tourist attractions. Breakfast is just amazing. Rooms are very new and modern. Perfect location on the La Rumbla. I wouldn't mind staying again.",5,2017,06,15
37,Beautiful accommodations and excellent staff,"The last two nights of a twelve day French/Spanish tour were spent at the Le Meridien. Our room was lovely, beds comfortable, bathroom luxurious. Our travel agent had arranged for breakfast to be included, and because we were leaving before breakfast service started, a box lunch was prepared for us. We didn't eat any other meals in their restaurant, but breakfast was very good. I would recommend Le Meridien.",5,2017,06,11
37,Excellent location on Las Ramblas,The hotel is perfectly located for central Barcelona and is comfortable with a good breakfast. My husband and I had a suite on the 9th floor at the back of the building. Being away from the street our room was lovely and quiet. My only criticism is that they have showers in baths. I have previously been in a room in this hotel where it was quite a climb to get in and out of the bath. If you're older with mobility problems you may want to ask about this. On this occasion it was much easier to get in and out of the shower but it was still in a bath. Good service and very clean rooms. ,4,2017,06,07
37,A rocky start,"We arrived at the hotel around noon and were informed our room would not be available until 3pm. We dropped off our luggage and went out for a stroll. When we returned around 3
We were informed our room was still not ready and we would have to wait about another hour. We had been traveling for hours and were tired and wanted to shower, so I asked to speak to the manager.Ana, the customer relations manager took over
To help us. She was understanding, professional and caring.
She worked to expedite the preparation of our room  and kept us informed of the progress. When the room was ready she personally escorted us up and made sure   everything was just right.
The room was lovely, the bathroom was spacious and well
stocked. We had a wonderful stay and would certainly  
return, should we go back to Barcelona.
Thank you again Ana, for your help. ",4,2017,06,06
37,Cool hotel in great location,"Perfect location within easy walking distance of many major attractions, eateries, bars and shops. Great hotel - cool modern decor, lovely room, good breakfast. Rooms quite small but really nice. Great guy who checked us in providing lots of useful information. Definitely recommend.",4,2017,06,06
37,"Good Hotel, Good Central Location","We started a recent tour of Spain in Barcelona, staying at this property for a couple nights.  

The rooms were good and very functional.  Bathrooms were ample, not always a guarantee in European hotels.  

The staff at the front desk and at the concierge were exceptionally helpful and accommodating.   The restaurant in the hotel was good and provided a good bfast. 

The location is on La Rambla, one of the main walking streets in Barca.  All the tour books will tell you to watch your belongings on this street as tourists abound and so do the pickpockets.   But there are so many great Barca sights to see from this location, from many of the Gaudi sights, to the Columbus statue and the harbor.   

When in Barca this is a very good middle of the road hotel choice and we were very pleased with our stay here.  ",4,2017,06,06
37,Great Location but Expensive,"This is a great location, based right on La Rambla. However, i feel there are cheaper hotels you can stay in of the same quality. Although the stay was good, it wasn't anything special. The actual room itself was pretty basic and the toilet flush wouldn't work properly not what you would expect for 250 EUR a night!",3,2017,06,06

37,"Luxury, Perfect Location, Bountiful Breakfast and Friendly Attentive Intelligent Staff","Wow, I was totally surprised, and absolutely delighted, by every aspect of this hotel. As a Starwood Platinum member, I have been in hundreds of Starwoods, and thought I had seen the full range of what this group can deliver, from to to bottom, but this Meridien topped them all. It has all the modern features one would expect, good wifi, numerous electric sockets, big shower etc, and the most comfortable bed. ( We were in Room 314, with is set on a corner overlooking the Rambla - very nice view, and amazing - quiet. The windows are totally insulated. No street noise. 

The breakfast , right on the Rambla, was extensive and delicious . Even Non-fat yogurt. No need to say more. Just be sure to allow extra time to  enjoy everything.

Now, last but not least, the people, beginning with the Front Desk checkin. The man at the desk provided terrific advice about Barcelona. At night we returned to the front desk to inquire about some of the monuments and buildings we have seen during the day.  The desk people immediately pulled up on their computer photos of the buildings, then inside 360 degree views, explaining in English what we had missed during the day.

Our requests for extra towels and pillows where cheerfully and immediately handled.

37,Great Hotel,"Le Meridien provided a top rate hotel experience for my girlfriend and me while we were staying in Barcelona. Despite enjoying the less touristy areas more, Le Meridien was ideally situated for easy access to all areas of Barcelona, whether walking or transit. The staff was always friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was amazing. The room was top rate and the service was second to none.",5,2017,06,02
37,Great Location,"We have stayed at Le Meridien La Rambla on May 2017. The location of the hotel is superb, with minutes to Plaza Catalunya and Barri Gotic. So if you want to stay at a hotel where you wouldn't worry about finding a taxi or transport because you can walk from anywhere anytime this is the place for you.  
Room: We have stayed at a standard room for 2 nights, then upgraded to a Junior Suite. Standard rooms have a spacious shower but the room itself is a bit small and old looking. If you go for a standard room ask for one with the good view, ours was looking to the back, to a construction site. For price per value Junior suite is a very good option. The room is quite big with a seperate living area and large terrace almost as big as the standard room. We loved to be able to relax and enjoy the views of Barcelona after a day of exploring. 
Recommendation: Special thanks to Maria at the concierge! Find her and she will give you the best and non-touristy suggestions for lunch, dinner and entertainment. Muchos gracias:) ",4,2017,05,31
37,Great and Friendly Central Hotel,"My wife and I stayed in La Meridian for a week in early May. The hotel is very central so it is easy to access lots of the main tourist sites within a short walk. Metro station and bus stops are also very close. The best feature of the hotel are the staff. They are friendly and efficient. I particularly want to thank Eduardo for his help in booking tickets to Sagrada Familia. Staff went over and above in giving help and information. 
The rooms are very comfortable and despite it's central location, on Las Ramblas, nice and quiet. Great hotel for a city break, but probably not for those on a tight budget.",4,2017,05,26
37,Busy location,"We arrived at this hotel to meet up with a larger group after staying at a boutique hotel in the quieter Gracia District for our first night in Barcelona. The hotel room had a king sized bed and an updated bathroom that felt spacious although quite dark. The bed was comfortable and the space very clean. The bathroom had only one sink so the space was limited for a 5 day stay. The 5th floor view was into adjacent buildings so this was uninspiring & surrounding street is bustling with people at all times. The hotel is very large and feels like it is run in a very corporate fashion. 

The bar was very small as were other shared spaces. This was not very conducive to meeting up with a larger group. There didn't seem to be any space to come together. Even the 6th floor spa rooftop space with plunge pool was very tiny. The spa itself seemed to be ""currently unavailable"" most times I checked during our stay. 

The morning breakfast area was great. Food selection was varied and there was always something delicious to start the day off with. Seating was never a problem either. 

Concierge staff was helpful and helped us plan a tour visiting Montjuic by subway, funicular and gondola which was quite enjoyable and easy to do right outside the doors of the hotel. 

Overall our stay was pleasant but the area is very busy and frenetic. Barcelona is a very easy city to navigate and I think if I return again I would stay in a quieter and less expensive, less touristy area. ",4,2017,05,26
37,iN THE HEART OF LA RAMBLA,"Great hotel in the energy centre of Barcelona.  We had a suite to begin with and it was dark and dismal, was thrilled to move to another hotel room which had been newly renovated and was far superior to their suites.  If going, request a new room and don't margin down for a standard room!  Facilities are bare bones but a lovely breakfast in the mornings, you could die waiting for a drink but so many other options around that there's no need to wait.  The gym was excellent but their 'rooftop' arrangement leaves much to be desired!  four lounge chairs...forget and hit the beach!",4,2017,05,25
37,Pre Cruise Stay,"Good hotel in a prime location, check in was quick and we also got our room earlier, the room was a standard room which was not the largest but adequate.
We had dinner in the restaurant which was ok, breakfast was a buffet with a good selection, all staff were very excellent.
Check out was also very smooth and quick.
Would recommend the Le Meridien for anyone looking for a central location hotel.",4,2017,05,24
37,"Wonderful Hotel, Great location & Excellent Staff!","I have always loved Barcelona & I love it even more because of the Le Meridian Barcelona! From the moment we checked in -- it was AMAZING! I can't thank the staff ( especially the Assistant Font Office Manager& Duty Manage) enough for truly going ABOVE AND BEYOND for me and for my family. 
My room on the second floor, overlooking La Ramblas, was beautiful and spacious --which is not always the case. The location is central to so many things and the staff as I mentioned--was always ready to help & make suggestions. 
Le Pop was also a terrific bar with lovely drinks and fun people watching!",5,2017,05,24
37,Cramped room. Small bar,Hated the shower in this room as couldn't get the temperature to set properly and the door kept jamming. Rain showers are nice but I felt like I was drowning! Also why was there a scale in the bathroom and preloaded with 5kg? Was well appointed room but just had this massive bathroom and a small bedroom area. We were visiting with a large group and were disappointed in the bar area as so small. Staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was great. ,3,2017,05,23
37,Excellent hotel in a perfect location,"Based on the positive reviews of Le Meridien in Barcelona by the majority of reviewers, I had very high expectations of the hotel and I'm delighted to say that these expectations were exceeded.
The service at the hotel is fantastic, particularly from Bruno, Ricardo & Noemi on the concierge desk who booked us some excellent tours as well as tables, at short notice, at some of Barcelona's best restaurants.
We decided to upgrade to a junior suite (room 614) and absolutely loved it. Very spacious with loads of character and surprisingly quiet, despite it's excellent location right on La Rambla.
I strongly recommend Le Meridien in Barcelona - a great hotel !",5,2017,05,19
37,Location is great for Tourists,"Stayed at the Le Meridien for 6 nights, location was convenient, it was close to shops, restaurants, grocery, attractions. Easy to get to a place by walking. But we were there during Holy Week and La Rambla was very crowded. Not suitable for relaxation because everyone was bumping with each other. A lot of tourists as well even if some days the shops were closed for holidays. Hotel room was modern with a decent size, amenities were sufficient except for an adaptor, some 5 star hotel lends one but Le Meridien does not, they sell it. Staff were courteous, helpful and friendly. Breakfast was boring, specially if you stay more than 3 days because they have the same menu every day. Be careful for pick pockets on the street. ",4,2017,05,18
37,Fantastic hotel!!,"My daughters and I stayed here for a week. The location is ideal, right on Las Ramblas, within walking distance of so many major sights. The hotel is beautiful. We had a lovely room, very spacious for three people (often not the case in Europe hotels. The staff was amazing, so polite, so helpful. The concierge and his staff were amazing, helped us plan things. The hotel is lovely,  very clean. Just a great overall experience. I would love to stay here again one day.",5,2017,05,18
37,Nice hotel ,"Nice hotel with excellent service , rooms are nice and clean . The restaurant is ok nothing special . The rooms smell fresh and clean . The hotel is located in a touristic area with nice restaurants and nice walk ways .   ",5,2017,05,17
37,Perfect,"On a recent trip to Spain I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona.  I love the location right by Ramblass Street, with plenty of  fun places to eat and shop.  Check in was quick.  My room was roomy and spacious.  No free breakfast. I recommend staying here.",5,2017,05,17
37,Beginning our vacation on a positive note,"Nothing is more important after a long international flight, than the hotel room where one will start the anti jet lag process.  Location is a close second.  We had stayed at Le Meridien years ago, decided to try it again for our three night stay.   Room 814, if budget allows, is wonderful with panoramic views of the city over roof tops--even to the ocean beyond--and lots of light and space.   We were made welcome on arrival and addressed by name throughout our stay.  The included daily buffet breakfast fortified us for hours of exploring and the location is as good as ever with the only caution being that La Ramblas is extremely busy with pedestrian traffic from about 0800 onward.   In terms of great location, we could easily walk to the beautiful waterfront promenade, Palau Guell and multiple of the other Gaudi sites, the old medieval section which is tucked off La Rambla about 10 minutes away, El Corte Ingles for retail therapy and much more.  The hotel is older, with compact lobby and the multiple ""quirky levels"" associated with revamped older buildings so one must be prepared for clusters of steps here and there and a small elevator.   The room in which we stayed had a quite dark taupe colour theme which was fine with so much light pouring in but a room with fewer windows would be quite dark.  However we saw other rooms that were decorated in the more common off white.  On a future repeat visit we would choose this hotel again based on quality of service and location.",4,2017,05,17
37,"Great Hotel, Location and Service!","A week before we arrived in Barcelona, Aline Geyer - Le Meridien Experience Specialist, provided very helpful assistance in personalizing our stay. Upon our arrival to Le Meridien, my husband and I were delighted to be warmly greeted and assisted with our luggage by the doorman. At check-in, Ms. Geyer and her manager - Ana Miuel, came over to introduce themselves and welcome us to Barcelona. Ms. Miuel informed us about complimentary passes to Palau Guell in our comfortable, modern room. BTW, we did visit Palau Guell and it was wonderful! The food in the restaurant was delicious, with great service and incredible people watching. The concierge, Oscar provided us with helpful maps and information. The lobby coffee bar makes amazing cappuccinos. We will return to Barcelona and stay at this lovely hotel with its great location and wonderful staff!",5,2017,05,15
37,Amazing!!!!,"We stayed here in December (sorry for the late review). Great location, right on Le Rambles & 2 minutes walk to the Mercat de La Boqueria - Sant Josep. The staff on the front desk were very welcoming. We checked-in straight away, when we got to our room I was alittle dissapointed as I had booked a room with a bath, no bath? I called the front desk and explained my request, I spoke to Alejandro, who was very helpful, he called me back with a couple of options and offered to show us. We opted for a Junior Suite which was gorgeous!!! (with a bath!!) It overlooked Le Rambla, which initally I was worried it would be noisey, but not at all.
We had an amzing stay in the hotel, and would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,05,15
37,Great Location but that's about it,Recently stayed 2 nights.  Having previously stayed in Le Meridan hotels elsewhere was expecting the rooms to be much nicer.  They were average at best.  The room and the bathroom was small.  Furnishings were nothing special.  The buffet breakfast was very good but did cost 25 euros per person.  The location was great being right on Las Ramblas.  Don't think I would stay there again,3,2017,05,13
37,Great hotel! ,"Stayed for 3 nights. Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Clean, modern and great bed!! Ordered room service one evening and the food was actually really good (given room service can often be hit and miss)! The employees were super friendly, attentive and helpful. This really stood out, more so than other hotels I have stayed at. Will definitely stay again when next in Barcelona. ",5,2017,05,11
37,Good and not so good,"The Meridien is a mixed bag. I've had good and bad experiences here. 

I upgraded to a prestige suite using my suite night rewards for this trip. The suite night cleared 5 days before so that was great. 

However, the prestige suite I got, while having excellent views of La Rambla, was tiny. There was a small living room with a bathroom attached to it, and you had to go through a door to enter the (rather small) bedroom as well. There was no bottled water in the room, which as a Starwood Platinum member, I would have certainly expected. 

I upgraded to a prestige suite before, and the last time the room I got was much larger and nicer. Which leads me to believe that all rooms in this hotel are not the same even if they have the same name (e.g prestige suite). I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families as the rooms are simply not large enough and inconsistent in size. 

The breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was excellent though, and the staff at reception as well as in the parking garage were exemplary. The parking facilities were great as well although expensive at 35+ euros to park overnight. 

",4,2017,05,09
37,"Great location, wonderful staff.","This is a fantastic location - just a block of Las Ramblas, you can access everything without all of the noise and commotion.  We could walk to the Mercado Boqueria, the Mediterranean, La Sagrada Familia and many of Gaudi's famous buildings. With Le Meridien's Unlock Art program, we also got to go to Palau Guell for free!  The staff there were wonderful - Ana, an Experience specialist gave us great dinner recommendations and Bruno, the concierge, mapped out a great walking path that showed us some wonderful sites!  It was a first time in Barcelona - we will be back and will stay at Le Meridien!",5,2017,05,07
37,Fabulous Location ," Being right on La Ramblas is a remarkable Location. Easy walking distance to many of the sights and and short metro rail to the rest. It is  crazy beautiful with architecture and vegetation. Take note, the beds are a strangely small size in a double room. Not what Americans are accustomed to. We also experienced repeated power failure in our room, that eventually took several occasions and about 5 hours to fix. The service is very good, but we did count 5 times in 3 days that an employee keyed themselves into our room while we were present without waiting for us to answer. Always dead bolt your door. ",4,2017,05,05
37,European Modern,"This hotel is a fine example of modern Europe architecture and furnishings. We are here on the second phase of our cross Spain tour. The staff was quite efficient and registration went like clock-work. Located in the center of Barcelona, all attractions are within easy reach. Parking is problematic; however, the concierge will be helpful.

I will also say that the hotel staff was more than helpful and efficient when we required help for a minor medical situation. A local doctor was called, an in-room examination was made, prescriptions were called for and obtained locally within a few minutes.
",5,2017,05,04
37,Weekend in Barcelona,"Very nice Hotel in the centre of Everything and good service overall 
But if you want Breakfast in your room do not take the bed and breakfast deal 
We did and they do not ask you to pay a tray supplement as normal they will bill you for the breakfast again double in fact as they say bed and breakfast deal do not cover it in your room ?",5,2017,05,03
37,Very good location and excellent service,"Nice & clean rooms. very good locations at ""Las Ramblas"" walking distance to main points. The staff was super polite. We had room with breakfast which was very good too.I recommend it so you don't have to go out for breakfast.",5,2017,05,02
37,Le Meridien Barcelona,"We enjoyed every aspect of our visit to the Le Meridien.  We were here over a very busy Easter Week.  Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was eager and helpful, including Ricardo who helped me buy Picasso Museum tickets through my phone.  The front desk staff and the concierge were always helpful.

We reserved a room many months ago. In subsequent messages between me and the hotel's representatives, I stated that I wanted a quiet non-smoking room.  I was given both.  (The hotel was 100% smoke free.)  The room faced the interior as I requested.  The view was non-existent.  My experience with Spanish hotels is that you can have a quiet room or one with a view.  While our room faced a dingy, unused interior, that is exactly what I wanted. The room was very quiet despite the central location of the hotel.

I wish I had tried their spa, but did not have time. The hotel's food was good at breakfast and lunch. I don't recall if we tried dinner there.  My wife who has severe food allergies was always able to get honest answers to her questions about contents of the food. The hotel asked me about my gold status immediately.  It was easy to check in via the Starwood Preferred area of reception.
Many of the staff had spent time in the United States and were well disposed to Americans.

I would stay at this hotel again. Please keep up the good work.",5,2017,05,02
37,Perfect location ,"The hotel can easily be missed as it is accessible from the side which made it a little tough to spot. 

We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but the staff were happy to hold onto our bags while we went off for lunch. 

Our room was spacious and clean and the shower was huge!! 

The spa area is a little disappointing as the sauna and steam rooms are tiny however they were perfect to relax in after a long day of walking. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 

Ps the breakfast was the perfect start to our long days offering a great selection of hot and cold dishes. 

The bar is also a great way to end the night ",5,2017,05,01
37,Pleasant Surprise,"this was a fabulous surprise for us! The rooms are giant and well appointed.  Don't miss the cocktail bar.  They have a very good cheese and meat board.  The front desk staff was so helpful and VERY friendly.  We were there on Easter Weekend and was it ever busy!  I would definitely stay here again.   
I liked the location even though it was a taxi ride to the Old Town and water.
Loved it!",5,2017,04,30
37,Central and Beautiful! ,"We enjoyed a wonderful week long stay here in Barcelona. It was clean, comfortable, and beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful for anything you need. We enjoyed room service which came very quickly, was hot and delicious. They even gave me a bottle of cava and strawberries for my birthday during the stay! Free wifi is a huge bonus as well. We appreciated how centrally located the hotel was for walking around the city. Being close to plaza Catalunya is really important if you are planning to take any bus tour as all buses meet in the square. It is located only two blocks away from the hotel! I would highly recommend staying here. It is worth every penny! ",5,2017,04,29
37,Convenient and beautiful,"We recently stayed at Le Meridien as part of a Tauck tour of northern Spain.  The hotel was such a pleasant surprise.  The staff spoke perfect English and were very competent and helpful.  The room was lovely, with very comfortable beds and pillows.  Best of all was the bathroom, which was beautiful and large with a fantastic shower.  We loved the service and food at the restaurant, which was among the best meals we had in northern Spain.  Finally, the location was very convenient.  We are looking forward to our next stay there!",5,2017,04,29
37,Excellent!,Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  Staff were very helpful and kind.  Rooms had great mattresses and bathrooms were spacious.  Had plenty of shelving for storing clothing.  Location was busy.  The hotel has a locked room for storing your suitcases if your room isn't available.  Food was good.  Decor very nice.,5,2017,04,25
37,Excellent Location and Great Breakfast!,"Hotel is in a great safe location central to everything and within walking distance to most interesting areas of Barcelona. The staff are friendly, the bed was comfortable, breakfast is excellent! Don't be fooled by the roof top plunge pool.. its literally 1 metre by 1.5 meters. But overall great stay.",4,2017,04,24
37,central and cozy +Kidzcool !!,"Friendly service folks + very nice rooms, the family suite with all you need for kids to use their PS4.
Room service is perfect. The bar serves nice Caipi's and other services.
Professional team at reception and concierges.
Breakfast with lazy or active versions also very good.
You walk out and directly are on the Rembla, and within 10.000 steps you reach most relevant places in Barcelona.
Could not try the SPA..
Prices are subsequently high...

Great place.",4,2017,04,21
37,Great hotel in a great location,"On the Ramblas, so if you like being at the heart of all the action, location is hard to beat.  Our suite faced Ramblas, but we were not bothered by any loud noise.  It was fun to look out onto the street and see all the activity.  Public areas are pretty nice and restaurant where we had breakfast every day was pretty good.  It was a buffet and did not really change day to day.  Could walk to most popular tourist places in Barcelona.  When we had to take a cab somewhere, the drivers were all professional and rates were reasonable..",4,2017,04,20
37,Perfect Location,This was by far one of the best locations to call your home base if you are staying in Barcelona.  Right on Las Ramblas there is so much that is walking distance from the hotel as well the metro is very close.  We spent a total of 9 days here broken up in to 4 days and 5 days. We bought hope on hope off bus tickets for 48 hours the first two days while so we could get and understanding of the city and than used the metro after that for all our travel.  The hotel offered a great breakfast as well had a nice spot to relax in on the roof.  You could spend a few hours wondering the local are and come back to rest before heading out to people watch and dinner.  Recommended this hotel,5,2017,04,20
37,Excellent hotel in great location,"Had such a pleasant stay at this hotel.  I loved the spacious room.  The bed and duvet were so comfortable, I had such as restful sleep.  Breakfast buffet had good choices.  The location was also excellent, being right in La Rambla, walking distance to everything in the old city.

Hotel also was very thoughtful on providing a coffee and some breakfast breads and pastries in the lobby for us travelers leaving for the airport early in the morning, with no time for a sit down breakfast.",5,2017,04,19
37,Excellent Hotel Choice ,I stayed with my niece for 2 nights in March 2017. The hotel is perfectly located for walking on the Ramblas or to the Gothic quarter or catching a metro to other areas. The staff were courteous and very willing to assist anyway they can. We ordered breakfast room service and it was absolutely wonderful. The room itself was nice and quiet. The rain shower was wonderful and amenities of anything you could need was already provided. I definitely will stay here again if visiting Barcelona. ,5,2017,04,17
37,"Good enough, plenty of better options","Having stayed in almost all the 4/5 star hotels in the area I can see no reason for booking this place again unless you specifically want to collect Starwood/Meridien loyalty points. 

There is nothing wrong it it, its a perfectly nice hotel but the property is surrounded by other 4/5 star hotels - even the 4 star 1898 Hotel opposite represents better rooms and perhaps has more personality to it (and arguably better facilities). 

Rooms were comfy enough, but again in a City full of personality they were functional rather than impressive. Barcelona has some magnificent hotels so the chain hotels need to try harder to impress than in many cities - and this is just OK. 

Breakfast was nice enough, and the staff there were lovely. But really again nothing exceptional. 

Some service elements let the place down too:

- Door man watched us unload our taxi of 6 suitcases whilst being beeped from behind by the line of traffic. He stood there watching, even when I gestured for his help he didn't come to our assistance. When we got to the hotel steps he picked one suitcase up and took it up the 4 steps. When I asked him to store, he said - go inside, they'll store it. No help at all. Inside we found 2 other doormen stood around chatting with each other. Awful for a Le Meridien. 

- Front desk staff were mixed. Again a few just stood around not really helping the others with the others working really hard. Felt sorry for the hard working ones really.

- Room service menu felt limited for a hotel of this standard but the food was nice. 

All in all there is nothing wrong with this hotel but in a City full of beautiful hotels with incredible rooms and service this was a standard chain hotel that did just enough to get its star rating and nothing more. 

As such, unless you specifically want to collect Starwood points (as we did) I'd be included to book the 1898 opposite or one of the many other 4/5 star hotels in this amazing city.

PS - to the management, you need to sort out the door staff issue. It was disgusting how he watched us unload and offered no assistance.",3,2017,04,14
37,Cozy place to stay.,"Pros:
Nice room, warm people both on reception and service desks, good breakfast, very close to most tourist attractions.
Close to city transportation and easy to reach from airport (we used Aerobus).

Cons:
A little expensive and close to La Rambla (noisy street at evening, night) but if you get the room on the other side of the building it is rather nice.

Try going to Plaça Reial for a lunch / dinner.",4,2017,04,13
37,Lovely Hotel In Prime Location,"Drove from UK to here, was met and my car parked by concierge, hotel was as expected for one of this standard and price, room was up to a high spec, view wasn't amazing but then again in this location, no view is.

Staff were more than helpful, needs attended to more than adequately, was made to feel welcome and valued, enjoyed the stay, will stay again when in Barcelona.",5,2017,04,07
37,"Fine Hotel, service, location","This was our first stay and Le Meridien and we would happily return. We upgraded to a Jr. Suite, which was large even by US standards. Large bed and bath. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful (as, to be honest, most Spaniards are, in our experience). The restaurant had a very good breakfast buffet of local specialties and ""the usual suspects"" found on breakfast buffets found in hotels around the world. Lunch and dinner less interesting, but a nice coffee place in the lobby. Great location just steps off La Rambla with a taxi stand (taxis are clean and cheap in Barcelona) just outside the door. Easy walk to many locations, short taxi ride anywhere in the city.",5,2017,04,04
37,GREAT LOCATION,"This property is located in a wonderful area and easy to get to everything.  I lowered the stay from five to four because of check in.  Am a platinum 100 night a year guest and asked to be upgraded to the terrace suite for which they had available during my entire stay.  Was told that the room I have is the best that they allow for an upgrade, really.....I used my suite night awards for this stay and wasn't given anything for free.  We also arrived early in the morning and room as expected was not ready.  Though room was ready a little over 9 am which was great.  I asked to be given breakfast and was said that I would have to pay for this.  The manager quickly chimed in and told me that I would be his guest; nice gesture and what I have come to expect.  The suite was a nice size and drinks at the bar were fun with a DJ each night.  Paid for this room versus using points as had a great rate but this is a property I would stay at again.",4,2017,04,03
37,no problem hotel,Good quality hotel with obliging staff and everything just as you would hope for. Well positioned in the Ramblas to be close enough to walk (if you want) to restaurants and places of interest.Coffee /tea/bottled water in rooms -umbrellas (!) provided if needed.,4,2017,04,03
37,Excelent stay - great location,"we had a great stay at Le Meridien. Welcoming staff, ready to help. My family (2 adults & 2y.o. boy) got the 116 room (newly renovated), which was perfectly located (just on the corner of La Rambla) - not too noisy, not to isolated from the action. Decent size room, nordic style. Breakfast had a decent selection of choices. Maybe a bit overpriced, but given the location & conditions, we overlooked this.",5,2017,03,28
37,Location is good.,"If you've never been to Barcelona, La Rambla which this hotel is located is probably one of the best places to stay in. 
That said, I don't necessarily think it has to be this hotel. 

The rooms are small, they won't upgrade you even if you're platinum and standard suites are available, the place is dated, and the complimentary water is charged if you ask for more than the allotted 2 per day which I've personally never seen at any other spg hotels. 

AC in room 530 is non-existent so you end up opening the window but it's loud outside with drunk people so it affects your sleep. Oh and you get the added bonus of cigarette smoke from the street too.

The lights in the room either have to be all on or all off except for the table lamp which made no sense. I had to change the outlet for the floor lamp so I could work while my friend slept.

The wifi never worked even when inputting the room number and last name. Called downstairs to get it fixed to which they agreed but never resolved it or checked up on us after I called. I ended up having to connect to the free wifi which was slower and I had issues with video conference calls for work. I'll probably avoid this place if you need stable wifi with decent speeds for work.

The concierge was helpful in securing dinner reservations and flamenco tickets. 

The bar is ok, with decent drinks. The male bartender was very good. 

All in all not the best stay. 
I'll give 5 stars for location but everything else is subpar and definitely not 5 star standards. Not sure why this place received a 5 star in the first place. There are better hotels in the area.",3,2017,03,27
37,Cocktail masterclass!,"11 of us did a cocktail masterclass here as part of my friends hen do! We were not disappointed!! Was about £23 each and wow did we get our moneys worth! The bar tender made 10 cocktails which we all got to try, then we all got to make our favourite! 
We were allowed to free pour so they weren't measuring how much alcohol we were using! We even asked if we could make a couple of cocktails that she hadn't shown us which she was more than happy to help us with! 
It was such a good afternoon! 
Cannot fault them at all!",5,2017,03,24
37,Location Location Location,"We'll stay here again not only because it's a great hotel but its central location on Barcelona's main La Rambla Blvd gives you easy access to so many great areas/sites of the city. You are steps away from the famous La Boqueria food market (we did a food tour that was to die for), 10 min. from the beach, 10-15 from Sagrada Familia, walking distance from the gothic quarter and some of the best restaurants/shops in the city. 

The hotel is beautiful, clean, and well staffed. We loved our room (5th floor corner) which had an expansive balcony overlooking the area's rooftops and was furnished with a sofa, table and two lounge chairs. We took advantage of the balcony quite a bit and although it was a free membership upgrade we felt the balcony alone would be well worth paying for. Large clean bathroom, rain-shower head, comfy bed. 

Our only disappointment with the hotel was the spa. I wouldn't call it a full spa. It's an extremely small/cramped co-ed amenity area with a shower, steam room and sauna (the steam room was not hot when I went into it). The outdoor water feature is a warm tub (not hot tub), meant to be like bath water. The lockers are out in the open so if you want to change in privacy you have to use the one bathroom. My husband loved his massage, mine was okay. 

Overall, we really loved our stay here and highly suggest this beautiful hotel, and if possible, a balcony upgrade. The location itself is worth it. 

TIP: We were flying out late morning and needed to pack so ordered room service. It was excellent. You can order al a carte so it was less expensive than eating at the hotel restaurant AND we were able to enjoy it on our sun soaked balcony. It made for the perfect, relaxing end to our Barcelona stay.",5,2017,03,24
37,"Aged property, excellent location","The welcome was a bit of a downer being informed that platinum members have no access to the top suites! Never heard o this upgrade practice. We got a junior suite ""city view""....overstatement of the year: small window looking at a wall! Lighting is minimal, layout made no sense...Staff especially in the breakfast room, was outstanding! Location made up for modt of the ""downers""!",3,2017,03,23
37,Perfect location. ,"Right across street from Hotel 1898. See that review. Perfect for shopping. Clean, nice, very small lobby. Room not ready early. Small elevators if you are claustrophobic.

37,Excellent,Perfect location... friendly staff... good breakfast.... allowed us to check in at 9 which was very nice of them as we had 4 rooms... All the rooms had all the amenities that one would require... only let down was the glass door to the bathroom as it did give enough privacy as we were two guys sharing a twin... Bar is a nice place to have a drink....   ,5,2017,03,20
37,Excellent value for money,"We were allowed early check in and allocated a room facing away from La Ramblas. The room was excellent and the hotel was located right on the La Ramblas, a short walk from the ocean front and Barceloneta. Excellent service. Loved it",5,2017,03,19
37,Lovely hotel & great location,"Stayed here for one night on business, super hotel with friendly staff.

I also ate dinner in the restaurant, i dont normally eat at hotel restaurants but as it was late in the evening and I wasnt in the mood for finding somewhere I gave it a try. 

I was pleasently surprised, excellent food.

Complimentary wifi, water and ever important on business an iron in the room !

Breakfast was great too, omlettes made to order

Enjoyed the stay and its right on La Ramblas",5,2017,03,18
37,Honeymoon heaven,My son and his bride stayed here earlier this month on the first stop of their honeymoon cruise. I arranged for the romance package to be awaiting in their room when they arrived. Ms. Garcia couldn't have been more helpful and gracious in arranging this upon their arrival after I missed her email asking about the time. It was ready when they got there and she upgraded them to a terrace room overlooking the city. They loved the hotel and staff and room. Thank you so much for being so accommodating. Roses on bed looked amazing.,5,2017,03,16
37,Best possible location,"A very good hotel, but most importantly in the perfect location. 
Nice design, good service, decent breakfasts. The design of the rooms is little crude, but practical and ergonomic. 
But the strongest points is the location. I can hardly think of a better one. Directly on the Rambla, short walking distance from the sea, plaza Catalunya, Bario Gotico. Still not far from La Sagrada Familia, Montjuïc, Diagonal. Plenty of restaurants, bars, etc. 
If you plan a weekend and wan't waste time on too much walking or money on too many taxis, this is the choice to make. ",4,2017,03,16
37,City break ,Just returned from four night stay at le meridian . We upgraded to a junior suite and well worth it . Views on les rambles fantastic . Room spacious and clean . Really comfy bed wish I could have bought it home !!! Nice touch that hair straighteners are provided . Complimentary water provided daily . Excellent breakfast . Would highly recommend . ,5,2017,03,13
37,Not the level of a 5star hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights
positive : location at the Ramblas
reception : friendly but not efficient
doorkeepers : not efficient
rooms : rather small  and quite standard for a 5 star hotel, noicy sometimes , could hear the metro 
breakfast : friendly staff that serves coffee and orange juice, buffet quality is way under a 5 star hotel ; I have been in 3 star hotel in Barcelona where quality and presentation is better than what was offered here
We had tapas during reception/drink : were not really tastefull
wellness : small but ok and friendly staff, second day neither the sauna nor the haman was on Temperature and staff didnt show up
I think you can find better price quality in similar location in Barcelona, gave a 4 overall but is more a 3 rating if you consider this is a 5 star hotel",3,2017,03,10
37,Excellent Hotel,"The service, room and location of this hotel were all excellent. I was there for work doing a project at the MACBA and walking 5 minutes to the site every day was amazing. 

The room was awesome and, unlike many hotel rooms even Meridiens in other cities, had lots of storage for clothes, shoes, etc. The bathroom was great and had a huge tub. 

In addition, there is a very comprehensive and upmarket supermarket called Carrefour's around the corner, making small errands a total snap. 

The restaurant off the lobby is also great.",5,2017,03,05
37,"Pretty good, but pricy.","Stayed in recently renovated room on the first floor.  Couple things: robes provided in the rooms for your convenience but hotel should really check these as both of ours were worn out and had completely ripped pockets.  
Coffee machine and tea in the room - very nice, good coffee.
Light in the closet has sensor that drives you crazy all night long by going off and on.
Beautiful roof top spa which was too crowded for us to use, but we enjoyed the view of the city and sunset.
Location is absolutely best - in the middle of the city, walking distance to the market and many good restaurants.
",4,2017,03,05
37,"Great Location , Top service","My wife and I have been here few time, the location is in the middle of all activities during the day and at night, the rooms are very nice and clean, Breakfast is nice and plenty, Staff our very profesional and helpful, The last few time we drove there and left the car right in front of the hotel and they parked it for us everytime, so no problem for parking on La Ramblas. Short walk to the beach and all the facilities. On a short notice they even managed to get us ticket to watch Barcelona game on a Saturday night, So few meter down the road we got into the green line (underground) and without any problem arrived right next to the arena. So perfect location for every activity.",5,2017,03,04
37,"Great location on Ramblas, nice rooms","The place to stay in Barcelona is Ramblas as it is quite central and walking distance from all tours that one may take for sightseeing. Also the street is lively till late and you can get stuff at walking distance.

The room / bathroom is clean and bed is really comfortable. The restaurant is nice facing the Ramblas. 

I must share experiences on food. Limited menu but good quality however looks like the team that takes orders is confused / untrained - 
1. First night I am asked to take an eclair as its a speciality and then later I am told its finished. Never heard of stuff finishing in an expensive hotel. I order ice cream - one scoop chocolate and one scoop strawberry. 
2. Next day I order salmon dish with vegetables and potatoes. My order comes without potatoes and they are sent later. I got a plate with just salmon and a few veggies. I also order a chocolate eclair and get a catalan flavour eclair which is changed. 
3. Day 3 I ask for strawberry ice-cream in the restaurant and am told its finished. I got to my room and order chocolate ice-cream and I get one scoop strawberry and one scoop chocolate. Didn't understand how I got my day 1 order. Also I order a catalan eclair and instead got a chocolate eclair.
Today, I will order whatever and not be worried as anything can come :)",4,2017,03,01
37,Wonderful place to stay...top service,"Stopping here after 10 days in India to see sights we had missed before while trying to drive in Barcelona  a couple of years ago (as an Australian you should never attempt that...except for sheer thrills of driving in very dense traffic/narrow medieval streets and few escape for parking!).
Before we even arrived we had been greeted via email by Ana Miquel the hotel experience manager. She sorted out our pick up  from the airport and then told us all the things we could do in 2.5 days. Great location at 111 La Rambla (Barcellona's pedestriain mall...centre of all good in Barcelona). First few hours were 'lost' in the nearby local market...amazing colours, displays and life! Sat at the bar and enjoyed a very cheap, but wonderful local meal plus the entertainment of the staff interactions!!
Next day was the first of the hop on hop off bus. Walking up to Parc Guell..got done over by a very professional pickpocket... targetted us as two by themselves..... gave us directions then out of the blue he spotted that we had 'bird droppings' over both of us...had water and tissues to clean it off, but needed to take off  shirt and jackets..then helped us clean it off....funny it had got into our hair at the back but we had wide brimmed hats on...all is logical in retrospect...... and as fast as he appeared he disappeared... walked on to line up for Parc Guell tickets and found wallet empty of notes..but back in inner zippered pocket of main bag...BUT all cards etc in place still. Talked to Ana Miquel at Le Meridien who had never heard of this...normal is for wallet to go cash out and thrown away! Ana Miquel took us to the main Police Station and even they were suprised about what had happened!! 
Ana Miquel went out of her way to help.
Le Meridien was fantastic, great food for breakfast allowing us to last the day and only need to eat again at night.
Everything about the Le Meridien at Barcelona was more than we expected even as SPG Gold members...loyalty programme (FREE to) pays off as you travel!
SPG Le Meridine in Barelona is the best choice!",5,2017,03,01
37,"Great hotel, great location, amazing staff!","Loved this hotel!!  Location was perfect ....very close to where we met our tours so was very convenient. Staff was amazing- the concierge was so helpful! We worked with him even before we left home to coordinate tours, FCBarcelona game, etc.  Kids loved the treats left in the room each night. Great breakfast buffet each morning. Every staff person was very friendly! We didn't want to leave! Would highly recommend this hotel and we are so grateful to them for making our vacation so special! ",5,2017,03,01
37,very clean and nice,This was an uptown modern place to stay and was very clean and tidy.   Wonderful people working there and yes I would come back just because of that and also it was very centrally located to where you could see a lot.,5,2017,02,23
37,Great Hotel in a excellent location.,"From the moment we walked in from a long flight we were greeted and settled in to our lovely room immediately at first I was a little anxious as I heard the rooms were not all refurbished, as I was a SPG member there was a separate check-in desk, the room was fantastic (so nice that I did not realise it was not even refurbished) so I cant wait to see what they are like once done. The windows were soundproof so no problem there at all. 
I cant comment on the breakfast but we did visit the bar LePop on a Friday night and that was great! We came on a couple holiday to tour Barcelona and the staff made sure they helped us as much as they could plan our days and book trips. 

Thank you very much for an amazing stay. 
Anisha & Nilesh",4,2017,02,22
37,Don't Stay Anywhere Else In Barcelona,"Big brand hotel with small, neighborhood feel. You shouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Barcelona.

We celebrated our first year wedding anniversary at this property and enjoyed walking minutes in all directions to enjoy Barcelona. Time spent on the property was well worth it, too. The restaurant had a delightful bar / espresso products.

The mini bar was creatively stocked with tapas which bailed us out of jetlag related hunger pangs a time or two.

The staff was excellent.",5,2017,02,21
37,Warm room but excellent hotel,"Stayed here 3 nights in February. Rooms are nice and beds comfy. Very warm room though, airconditioning did nothing against this. Colleagues in another room experienced the same.
For the rest everything is as may be expected from a 5 star place, breakfast also good.",4,2017,02,19
37,Great Location Great Staff,"This hotel sits right on the main shopping street in Barcelona and just 2 blocks from the amazing open air food market in Barcelona (Borquena)(a must visit place).  Staff at hotel was super friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back next time in Barcelona. Only bad part of the visit was, that I was only there for 1 day. Can not wait to return and spend more time.",5,2017,02,19
37,Be careful with your belongings,"I have stayed in this hotel for four days. No matter the hotel environment is good and front office staff is good. 

I ended up with very bad experiences related to security me safety. Nearly 700€ of money in cash has been stolen from my wallet which I noticed only after coming back home. This experience ruined my all good opinions on this hotel. 

This is Starwood group hotel and these kind of things happening in the hotel ruins the image of the hotel leaving bad image on the group. I stayed in the same group hotel in lot of places around the world never had such experience which I had in Barcelona. 

I hope this will be resolved and restore the image of the hotel.",1,2017,02,17
37,"Location, Location, Location!","A great modern hotel in a very central location. Rooms were a good size and the bed was very comfortable. Our room was at the back and it was very quiet.
The breakfast buffet was very good, much more than just continental. There was hot and cold food, an omelette guy and  lovely pancakes!
The cocktails in the pop bar were also very good if a little expensive. It was mainly not too busy in there, but it did get very busy on the Saturday night, so that was less good.
We ate outside the hotel in the evenings as there is loads of choice just a short walk away.",4,2017,02,16
37,High quality in very good location,"It has the typical Meridien smell, decoration, elevator music, and much more. Impressive how they execute the high quality consistency around the world. Professional staff, the rooms are in good shape and feel modern, fresh and clean. Location is perfect for tourists, and the breakfast buffet is excellent. Being so central the downside is the view from the rooms is not spectacular like in others, and if you travel by car or taxi, it can get congested in the area. Wifi is solid and fast, can warmly recommend also for the business traveler.",5,2017,02,15
37,Good stay,"My husband and I spent 1 night at Le Meridien prior to our cruise.  I was a little concerned because of the previously written reviews, but was very satisfied with my 1 night stay.
We arrived early and were able to check-in immediately.  The room was a deluxe Starwood room, and was a good size.  Bed and amenities were fine.
The location is amazing!!!!  Located on Las Ramblas and a few minute walk to the Plaza Cataluña and the Barrio Gótico.
We did not eat in the hotel .  There is a great cafe when you walk out the main door to the right.  Had a great breakfast there.
Would definitely return to this hotel.",4,2017,02,14
37,SuperB Hotel,"We are still staying in the hotel. I have really good impression of the hotel. Very warm and helpful staff, big rooms. Definitely will be staying again. This is terrace which is we have at our room, where we can relax after city sightseeing. Amazing city, amazing hotel",5,2017,02,14
37,Great location,"The hotel is steps away from Rambla and very close to Placa de Catalunya. The bus and metro station are very close - you can also walk to the harbor (10-15 minutes)
Despite the chaos from the street, inside the hotel is very tranquil. 
Rooms are a bit small but comfortable and very clean.
The hotel is very busy, so the staff is under a lot of pressure, therefore not too accommodating.
Breakfast is good - a reasonable variety - but again, the restaurant is very busy, so sometimes you have to wait to get a table or the attention of the staff.
The rooftop spa is quite small (and in September the jacuzzi was not working), but if you manage to find a spot you can enjoy a wonderful view.
Around the hotel there are several restaurants serving excellent food.",4,2017,02,14
37,Good place to stay,Great location for tourism as well as business trips. Excellent friendly staff. Rooms are spacious and modern. Good breakfast buffet and a relaxing bar. Meeting rooms can be underground which is a little challenging - plan lunch time carefully on an agenda as food served in restaurant. Would stay again,5,2017,02,14
37,THE ROOFTOP IS AN AWESOME PLACE TO HANG OUT IN THE SUN,"I liked this hotel for its location, cleanliness and the rooftop spa. 

The hotel is dated but somehow it's calming beauty away from the busy las ramblas, right on your doorstep, but when you get inside the hotel it's a peaceful oasis in the heart of BCN. 

For the right rate it's an awesome hotel. 

I especially like the fresh fruit found in the hallways. Kinda made my mornings. 

Have tea on the roof in the afternoon, or maybe something a more little spicy. 

As an SPG Gold member they went out of their way to make everything special. I did something by mistake and they just helped me with little question. I loved that. Thank you guys! 

",4,2017,02,13
37,THE Place to Stay in Barcelona for a Wonderful Experience,"I chose this hotel for a February vacation with a friend.  The location is perfect, as you are right on Las Ramblas.  It's a beautiful property, with a cocktail bar, restaurant and spa on site.  We patronized the bar, but the restaurant looked very nice as well, and seemed to be busy.  There are so many great places to try within walking distance in this beautiful city that we always ate out of the hotel.

The check-in was very smooth, and since we were staying for a week, we were offered 10-20% off food, spa and parking whenever we might use them.

Our room was lovely, with windows that opened, 2 comfortable queen beds with luxurious bedding.  The closet was amazingly well-appointed for a hotel, and included drawers, shelves and rods, ironing board, iron and press.  

The bathroom was great.  All slate floors (heated) and walls, including in the decadent shower (rain and hand-held shower heads with separate controls.)  Towels are very thick and nice.  Lovely toiletries include shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, bar soap, lotion, comb, shower cap, cotton pads and buds, hairdryer, and a scale.  I love being able to travel without having to waste luggage space on these things.

We received a fruit bowl and mineral water in our room when we arrived, and every 2nd or 3rd day as well.  2 gratis water bottles in our room each day were appreciated.  There were also apples, newspapers and magazines in the small lobby on our floor (5th, one of the SPG floors).  There was a nice selection of current magazines placed in our room as well.  Mini bar gives you room to put a bottle or two of wine or whatever in to chill.  Nice grocery store around the corner, with full liquor selection, to say nothing of the open air market a few blocks the other way.

All of the staff were so pleasant, and anxious to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying our time there.  I would go back again any time.",5,2017,02,13
37,Excellant location,"Stayed for 3 nights, on the La Rambla, just down from the Placa de Catunlunye, where the hop-on-off buses (2 companies) begin, 100 meters from Bonquarta market, across from the old gothic area, great restaurants close by.  Hotel had great service, and one of the best breakfast buffets, with chef made omelets and fried eggs, 10 pastries, fruits.  Nice modern bath, walk in shower,  We had room 215 which is to the back (no view) but quiet and on the ""curve"" so a bigger room -- 10X10 entrance hall",5,2017,02,12
37,Truly wonderful stau,I travel quite extensively and have not stayed at such a warm and hospitable location in quite some time. The people checking in/out at the front desk were kind and friendly. The concierge was very helpful - especially Ricardo who took the time to help us identify several dining options but also learned our names. A great place with a great location. Fantastic!,5,2017,02,12
37,Wonderful stay,"As an SPG Platinum member I was treated like a King!  We were upgraded to an amazing suite with so many windows!  The hotel also placed a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered stawberries in our room, nice touch!  Breakfast was so good...the prosciutto was so good and the fresh fruit was delicious and sweet.  The hotel is in a great location and we always felt safe...there seems to be a lot of police around this area.  We will definitely be back!",5,2017,02,12
37,Nice Old Hotel,"Located on LaRambla in the heart of that area so walking to many areas is quite easy as it is centrally located. 

Part of the Starwood Group of Hotels.

Nearby are the La Boqueria market, McDonalds, and lots of restaurants.....

the Doctor hit me with a helpful vote! ",4,2017,02,12
37,Wonderful,I love the City. And the hotel was wonderful. The trip with friends was amazing. I really liked the hotel and services. It's not only a hotel with name but stand by it's name and brand. Whosoever is looking for a good hotel with services should definitely try it without any doubt. Thanks to rosy for helping with all my needs during stay u were really amazing!!,5,2017,01,31
37,Top class full service hotel,"I came here on business with a group in December. Right off, I was very impressed with the friendliness of every staff member I encountered - the room was very clean and comfortable too. The fitness room was not large but reasonably equipped. The location was great in the middle of La Ramblas, but not noisy at night. A very pleasant experience indeed. ",5,2017,01,27
37,Anniversary trip,"The location of the hotel was spot on! It's a pretty decent hotel for the price and had all the basic amenities. The breakfast was decent and the stay was good. Nothing special was offered on being our anniversary, but that's ok I guess as we did not expect anything either.",4,2017,01,26
37,Great place but expensive ,"I liked this hotel at La Rambla. The front desk staff are very friendly and very helpfull. Parking inside the hotel is too expensive, so i recommend to get to the hotel by taxi and do not worry about parking...",4,2017,01,15
37,I would go back in a heartbeat,"My husband and I stayed at Le Meridien with our two boys, ages 16 and 19 for 5 nights around Christmastime.  First, the hotel's location is really great, walkable to just about anything in the city.  Second, the staff was wonderful, from the front desk folks to the Bruno the concierge who gave us phenomenal restaurant recommendations, to the entire hotel staff.  Finally, the hotel itself was great.  Super comfortable beds; great shower pressure; roomy spaces (we had 2 junior suites); wonderful turn-down service; contemporary, spacious bathrooms; and a big, flat screen tv (which we didn't watch but it was nice to know we could.)  I loved it and loved Barcelona.  So much to do over the holidays and great weather (in the mid-high 50s the entire week.)  A wonderful trip made better by staying at Le Meridien.  BTW, we also stayed at Meridien in London and felt equally enthusiastic about it.  A great hotel all around.",5,2017,01,14
37,Hands down the best place to stay while in Barcelona!,"This is absolutely one of the best places to stay while in Barcelona. Few things that really worked for us (1) Proximity to La Rambla and other key attractions (2) Comfortable luxury rooms with all the amenities (3) Reasonable price. 

Essentially, it provides the two key ingredients which you need on a vacation i.e. central location and a safe comfortable place. Pretty much all the key attractions like La Rambla, Sagrada Família, Gothic Quarter, Casa Batlló, Casa Milà are very, very close and easily reachable from this hotel. That was hands down the major plus with this hotel.

Few things that could have been better - (1) The staff, manager was less accommodating of some of the requests that we had - left baggage request, some room configuration needs. But I presume those were not accommodated for valid reasons. (2) Would have been great to have a breakfast buffet included at the price that we paid. In any case, it became a non-issue for us as most of the eateries were literally next door.

In-spite of some of the shortcomings, the positives associated with the hotel outweigh everything. If I were to visit Barcelona again, I will definitely stay again at Le Meridian.",5,2017,01,09
37,"Great Service,Hotel, but kind of small","Great view  we had the junior suite , housekeeping outstanding! , close to everything , Barcelona is a small city you could walk it , great location. Very expensive hotel even if the service is great. Breakfast was good ,",5,2017,01,07
37,Excellent location,"Reception staff very accommodating and friendly. Wife and I arrived early around 11:00 am and were able to check us in. 

Rooms are decent size but slightly dated. Bathroom a very good size.

Location of the hotel right on Rambla though we could not hear the busyness of the streets 

Would stay here againb",4,2017,01,07
37,Comfortable and relaxing,"I couldn't say enough good things about Le Meridien in Barcelona. They were so helpful and complied with every request we had, including even fixing the handle of our suitcase! They printed our boarding passes and kept our luggage for the day. The gym is great too. Overall all a wonderful stay!",5,2017,01,07
37,"Great Location, Great (But Smallish) Suite, Nice Staff, Really Expensive","My wife, two children and I visited Barcelona in December 2016 and January 2017.  We stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for four nights.  We received good responsiveness from the concierge via email before we arrived.  Omar at the front desk was very friendly and helpful during our check-in.  The hotel lobby was nice.  The location of the hotel is fantastic.  It is right on La Rambla (there is a debate about whether La Rambla or Las Ramblas is correct), about 2-3 minutes walking to the Barri Gothic, La Boqueria Market, Plaza Catalunya, and about 10-15 minutes to many other things.  We were upgraded to a suite - Room 546.  I would say looking back on it now that our suite was comfortable but not very large.  Our bed was very comfortable but the pillows were very soft and I usually prefer harder pillows.  We had a very nice shower and bath.  The room and rollaway bed for our children was fine.  We had free WIFI.  The hotel sent up some fruit and bottles of water which was a nice touch.  The breakfast room and staff were very nice.  The food for breakfast was excellent.  I especially liked the various multigrain breads, sliced Iberian ham, yogurt.  The breakfast of my wife and I was free but unfortunately I had to pay for 50 percent of the breakfast for our children which added about 100 euros overall to our bill.  The hotel also had a New Years Eve party in the breakfast room which also doubles as a dinner restaurant.  We paid 50 euros per person.  The party had a dress code and started out very nicely.  We were entitled to three drinks plus free champagne.  The DJ and music were very nice especially hearing some American music like Justin Timberlake.  It was fascinating to watch the countdown on Spanish television and the Spanish TV personalities and reporting from Madrid and Canary Islands.  But then the hotel started letting in many younger people from the La Rambla entrance.  I assumed they paid but I doubt they paid 50 euros per person.  They were not well dressed and a couple of them smoked cigarettes which ruined the party for me as I have asthma.  So at about 1:15 AM I had to leave and go back to the room as I simply cannot stand cigarette smoke.  I believe it is against the law in Spain to allow smoking in restaurants so I am not sure why the hotel did not do something about this.  My wife and our friends stayed on for another hour.  I really do not think it was fair to let in those other younger people from the street.  Such a party should be for hotel guests only.  The cost of our hotel stay was over 500 euros per night (so over 2000 euros for 4 nights and more like 2200 euros), 100 euros extra for our children's breakfast and 100 euros for the party.  Many hotels in New York jack up their prices for New Years so I guess this is normal.  Adding up all the positive things I have written and the negative things I have written, I would definitely stay here again if we return to the great city of Barcelona one day.  And I guess you have to look at celebrating the new year in Barcelona as a once in a lifetime experience.  I might pay for some of the nights with points next time and negotiate harder for free breakfast for our children the next time.  The great location and feeling of safety, the nice staff, the great breakfast buffet, the nice but small suite and the fact we were paying New Years prices (hopefully during the year it is less expensive)  make this hotel worth it.",4,2017,01,05
37,"Great location, but needs fine tuning.","Great location, and friendly reception staff. The room was nice with interesting amenity - great location to celebrate NYE. Housekeeping was not up to SPG standards, especially if one has booked a junior suite for two. Restocking and vacuuming were not on the hotels priorities. Even though it was a holiday, these holidays come annually - plan & prepare. Room service was horribly slow as well. Slightly disappointed, but still a good location, despite getting pickpockets on the corner. Fortunately my family and locals caught the thief and my belonging were retrieved.",4,2017,01,02
37,In the middle of where you want to be,"The hotel in a touristic area, which will be a great choice for new comers to Barcelona. Everything is within a walking distance.
Rooms: are good but you can see better specially for people who used to come to the middle east.
Gym: quit small with limited machines. 
Spa: limited choices.
Early check in: they told me hotel is busy, who knows?!
Lobby cafe: cozy area, sweets worth to try. 
For me it was a one day experience, maybe it would be better if I stayed longer. ",4,2016,12,29
37,A rewarded suite stay,"So I have reviewed this place before and was coming back to Barcelona and so we looked at either the W vs this Barcelona staple, Le Meridien. In the end, weighing up the taxi costs from the W, we decided to choose Le Meridien and upgrade to a suite stay right in the very heart of Barcelona on the main walking street of La Ramblas.

The hotel itself wears the same face as before, with additional funky pieces placed throughout their coffee lounge and I love the light signs of Le Meridien on the Piano and Barcelona in the background, very nice.

The room was a great size, but the suite could certainly do with a little bit of a pick me up in a renovation towards the bathroom, but the furnishings and bed quality and comfort where definitely up to par with the best. 

One super highlight is the water pressure in the shower, which was so strong it could knock you down an amazing way to shower, really loved it.

Their in room amenities was great, forget anything, no worries, they have it all already there awaiting you in the room and the in room coffee bar has the great offering of cappuccino which was a great treat every morning. The only issue is that they give you like 4 coffee sachets and Nespresso capsules and the same with milk capsules, a pain when you consider everyone needs more milk than the 3ml's the hotel provides for your morning coffee.

If your looking for a place that has great central location, modern and vibrant dining offerings, and the smell of boutiques in the air, this is the spot. Jump on into Le Meridien Barcelona",4,2016,12,28
37,Fantastic Location ,"Location is unbeatable. Very close to restaurants, coffee shops, shopping place, public transport. 

Hotel has good quality rooms and bathrooms are very nice. Spa is small but very good. 

Small hotel but friendly staff. Taxi rank outside. ",5,2016,12,26
37,Tea time,"A short brake for tea. Nice location, on la rampla street. Clean and acceptably priced. Stopped by for a tea break /rest. SPG management sounds the same as every location they are in. Prices are little higher compared to main street.",4,2016,12,24
37,Unbeatable Location,"We experienced a very pleasant and convenient stay at a very prime location. Rooms are very spacious. The decor is very simple and needs some update. Beds/Rooms were clean and comfortable. Buffet breakfast included in the price had extensive selection. We opted for rooms on La Rambla, which may get noisy for light sleepers but did not bother us at all.The staff was very pleasant and courteous. A very special thanks to Ricardo at the concierge desk who with all his heart planned out days for us according to weather, and arranged a wonderful guide and comfortable transportation for our out of city tour. 
Only two problems were encountered
1) The cleaning service did not remove empty coffee cup from my kids' room for three days
2) Our room had an old fashioned thermostat with five numbers in plus and 5 in minus. After 3:30 am our room would get extremely hot. Our connecting room for kids had an updated thermostat and their room temperature was comfortable. We never reported this problem to the staff so we should not whine about it either :)",4,2016,12,08
37,Consistently a great home away from home,"From the moment you arrive, the staff make you feel welcome in this corner property located in the heart of La Rambla.  We always make it a point to stay at this hotel when in town for its location and consistent customer service. 

Location is great if you travel with family and friends - you can wander and each do your thing and come back to this central spot. Easy to find and walking distance to many great places to visit (La Boqueria, MACBA, barri gotic, Born shopping district, etc.).  Also like the convenience of a Carrefour just around the corner for quick items.

Rooms are always clean with enough space to stretch.  We prefer the rooms facing Carrer d'en Xucia or Carrer del Pintor Fortuny - less noise. Beds are heavenly after a long day on your feet, and housekeeping is always efficient and responsive to requests. The front desk and bell staff are very helpful to make sure your party gets around town, you make your pick up/connections, and catch your ride to the airport. The hotel lobby, while not huge, is welcoming and cozy with space to meet friends and unwind. Overall, a good experience whenever we're in Barcelona.",5,2016,12,06
37,"Prime Location on La Rambla, Modern, Clean","Stayed here for two nights this year - Hallowe'en Night and November 1st.

You can't beat the location; directly on the best part of La Rambla.

Front desk personnel were professional and friendly.

Room and bathroom were well appointed and clean.

Would stay here again in without hesitation.",4,2016,12,05
37,Modern hotel in great location with friendly efficient service,"Great launching pad on La Rambla to tour Barcelona. The hotel is modern with well appointed relatively spacious rooms, warm service, great albeit small 24/7 gym, good restaurant (111) with a very reasonable prefix lunch/dinner paella course. 
Barcelona is expensive and this hotel is no exception, but definitely in line with expectations of large European cities/capitals.",4,2016,12,04
37,Barcelona IBTM,"Great hotel,great service, and it's near everything if you have a choice of room try to get a suite on the ninth.  they're much bigger, however the bathrooms tend to be a little smaller just keep that in mind.  Avoid the pizza place across the street.  ",5,2016,11,30
37,Nice location and High Value SPG Recognition,"We stayed there and got a beautiful suite giving on Las Ramblas. Ideally located, this hotel has very nice Staff and the Service is #1! The only exception is the attitude of the Barman at the 111 bar that was a little unpleasant. Except that, It's really a place of choice when coming to Barcelona. Thanks a lot! We will be back!",4,2016,11,28
37,Great place to stay at La Rambla,I stayed here with my wife and 16 month old daughter for 4 nights. I used my suite night awards and was upgraded to a suite. The hotel is located on La Rambla and very close to everything. The breakfast selection was amazing - probably the best selection I have seen in Europe. The staff were amazingly helpful and accommodating. I highly recommend staying here.,5,2016,11,21
37,"Superb location, fun and safe!","We recently visited this hotel and it was a perfect location, fun place to stay out late and enjoy the local flair.  I would stay here again and prefer this location over the other hotel. Small rooms but, normal for city living.",5,2016,11,20
37,Staff was extraordinary ,The hotel truly made us feel special. Everyone in the hotel went out of their way to assist my family and ensure we had an amazing experience.  The hotel location was perfect (central) for walking to many of the sites and restaurants - 10 minutes either way and you are in a new section to explore...  ,5,2016,11,20
37,"Nice hotel, excellent staff","The staff was excellent!!! From check in to check out, people went out of their way to help us and provide recommendations. This is especially true of Ricardo, the concierge.  He was unbelievably helpful! He helped us plan out our time during the day and book some amazing dinners. 

We were upgraded to a junior suite on the 5th floor, less noise than our 3rd floor room.  Furniture was modern but a little outdated. 

Generally a very nice hotel.

",4,2016,11,19
37,Le Meridian - Well located for a couple of days in Barcelona,"The Meridian Barcelona does not disappoint - a bit pricey but in keeping with this level of hotel. What we liked in addition to the hotel's excellent facilities and service was the location. Right on La Rambla, an easy 6-7 minute stroll to Placa Catalunya. Almost next door on (exit restaurant, turn left) is a Carrefour, where you can get wine, beer, sandwiches, etc. at very reasonable prices. Comes in handy if you are watching $$. While La Rambla is interesting, it is touristy and therefore there is a premium for restaurants and bars. Explore the neighbourhood behind the hotel - less crowded, a bit less expensive, and excellent quality. Within 5 - 10 minute walk from Hotel main entrance - exit hotel, turn right, follow your nose. There is a small square on the left that has a number of bars and parallels La Rambla. In fact you can see hotel from a couple of the bars. More of the same in surrounding blocks. 

If this is your first visit to Barcelona we recommend The Barcelona City Tour - a hop on/hop off tour of the city. Gives an excellent of the overall city and key points of interest. Do the green route first, as early as possible. This will get you to Sagrada Familia before crowds get too big. 
Enjoy.",4,2016,11,16
37,Great location ,"Excellent location, we walked to La Pedrera, Casa Batllo, dinner, the opera house, and Gothic quarter. It is right off La Ramblas which is a main street in Barcelona. Very easy to get a cab too. The concierge, especially Riccardo, was very helpful. ",5,2016,11,11
37,Best possible location for tourists and businessmen,"The hotel is situated in the heart of the bustling Las Ramblas boulevard. The staff are extremely polite and efficient, so the hotel is suitable equally for tourists and business travellers. The rooms are clean and the beds are surprisingly comfortable.

The gigantic food market, with unbelievable varieties of fruit/veggies and bar-style restaurants brimming with fresh fish and produce, is just 100 metres down the road, while the busy side streets and attractive squares and sites of the Old Town are within short walking distance.",5,2016,11,07
37,Great location,"Fantastic location on the corner of a side street and Las Ramblas (entrance is on the side street). It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Christopher Columbus Monument where we were dropped off after our cruise, and a five minute walk to Plaça Catalunya where you can catch the Hop on Bus or the Airport Aerobus. Great front desk staff.",4,2016,11,06
37,4 Strikes & You're Out,"We cruise out of Barcelona quite often and have stayed here 4 times.

It's a love / hate relationship really. We love the location and it's generally well kept and the rooms (although on the small size) are comfortable. We have begun to hate the level of service and attitude of the front staff. They are not mean or insulting, they just don't have the genuine hospitable attitude of other hotels of this stature.

Have you looked at the prices of rooms here?

We asked for a corkscrew and the front desk said they'd sent one up - with a room service charge.

Have you seen the prices yet?

We asked for wine glasses - room service said they'd send some up - with...yes a room service charge.

Did I mention the price point of the rooms here?

This is just simply not something a hotel of this level should do. I will say that I did get a reply from the manager on duty to say they have corrected this for future guests but why do customers paying these kind of prices have to even deal with this?

I've not been happy with the lack lustre performance of the front desk each and every time we've stayed there. They seem to actually dislike foreign guests. The SPG Preferred desk should actually take care of us ""preferred guests"" which is again not something customers should have to ask for. 

Finally, do yourself a favour a take a look at what price they want for a room here - and then take a look across the street to H1898 because that's where we will be staying next time.",2,2016,11,03
37,Great place to stay,"Le Meriden Barcelona is a great 231 room designer hotel.
It is a very modern hotel situated in a historic building on a side street off the famous Las Ramblas area of Barcelona.
The front desk staff was great!
We arrived from the States around 9am.
Our check in time was scheduled for 3 pm but the staff made arrangements for us to get into our room by 11am.
While waiting they directed us to a nice little coffee shop down the street, and gave us some ideas of where we could walk to start exploring the area.
LeMeridian is so perfectly located in this great walking city that we were able to walk to all of the shopping and restaurants along with their famous out door market place ( 5 mins down the street.)
This hotel has modern  spacious somewhat monochromatic colored rooms with rich darker woods. Bath rooms were great with rain shower, shower heads and all of the bathing amenities one would expect in a fine hotel.
Their restaurant that is also open to the public was a great place for breakfast, and their cocktail lounge was a nice area to just sit and relax with your favorite drink after being out and about in  this beautiful city.
I highly recommend this hotel if ever traveling to Barcelona Spain.
",5,2016,11,02
37,Great Hotel,This was a Wonderful hotel.  Great location off of Las Ramblas. Close to shopping and Hop on Bus.  This hotel had the best restaurant.  Great food at reasonable prices.  Close to everything.  Loved it and would recommend it to everyone.,5,2016,11,01
37,Luxury on Barcelona's Las Ramblas,"Our first couple of nights we stayed in a quaint rustic boutique location.   That was nice, however then we moved to the Le Meridien and wow what a difference.    The location is amazing.   You are 1/2 block from the Las Ramblas and our room was spectacular.    Very modern and comfortable.    The service was excellent.   If we needed anything, they were quick to deliver.    One day we had to catch an early tour but it was pouring rain.    They provided us with umbrellas and called a taxi to get us to our location.    There are so many great places to eat near the hotel.     It was very convenient having the hotel located where it was.    Great place overall.",5,2016,10,31
37,"Tired room, but great staff!","The hotel is conveniently located.  Our room was clean, but ""tired"" (e.g., the furniture and carpeting was old and somewhat worn). The bed was reasonably comfortable for me, but my wife had trouble with it (i.e., morning back aches).  We did eat at the buffet breakfast, which was really excellent!  However, the real draw for this place is the staff!  They are competent, friendly, and very willing to help.  (They also speak English, although that's common in Barcelona.)  Due to a cancelled cruise, we had to change the nights of out stay at least twice.  The desk staff was more than helpful and spent a lot of time with my wife working on this.  The concierge was also pleasant and had good information on restaurants and places to go.  (We didn't think much of the Barcelona cuisine, but that's another story.)  We gave the hotel an average rating due to being so ""tired"", but in truth it was a 3 and 1/2.  We would stay there again.",3,2016,10,30
37,Vacation ,Great location on Las Ramblas. The restaurant service every morning was excellent. Housekeeping was a little inconsistent. Turn down service at night comes around a little late. We stayed for 10 days in 2 different rooms. Floors 5 and 7. There were plus and minus to both floors. Centrally located! ,4,2016,10,29
37,First floor noise,"We were assigned a room on the first floor looking at motorcycle parking across the street.  The room was adequate but had problems.  First, the shower was in a bathtub.  That is okay except for the high step over the tub and the responding Hugh step over the tub to get out of shower.  Dangerous!  And, after a long flight originating in LA, I wanted sleep, but the metro must run under hotel.  The every 10 minutes noise starting early in the morning was obnoxious.  We won't stay here again.  I've used SPG around the world, but this sucked!",2,2016,10,25
37,European Adventure ,"This hotel was in a great location on La Ramblas, could not really get any closer . I arranged to pay extra to get into room early but spent mist of my day morning running back and forth as our suite was very hot . The AC was not working at all and it was hot and stuffy . 

Eventually the Asst Mgr tried to make good but it was just a gesture of buffet breakfast our last morning , being in the business in past I would have refunded some or all of the early arrival fee . 

This hotel has a lovely restaurant on property and I would give it a 4 star rating . Service and food were great as well as wine and cava served . 

Take the suite if you can being a family as it provides you with king bed as well as queen size pull out sofa bed and nice space to spread put . An outside pool area is missing ( small plunge pool if that ) and it seemed that other hotels offer roof top pools . The hotel across from Le Meridien had a very nice rooftop , hotel 1925 . 

Get out and explore La Ramblas , take a 1/2 day tour of Barcelona as it is an amazing city , I look forward to visiting there again someday . ",3,2016,10,23
37,Great service and location ,"The check in was fast, Simon gave us great restaurant suggestions and the concierge found excellent last minute tickets for a concert at the Palau de la musica.  Our room was quiet on the 5th floor, facing the back.  The location is perfect near La Rambla, in proximity of subway stations.",5,2016,10,23
37,Wonderful hotel and location,This is a fabulous hotel in a perfect location. Right on Las Rambles and do closed to so many sights including la bocqueria. SPG members enjoy free full breakfast too. Rooms are lovey with great beds and high quality amenities for bathroom items. ,5,2016,10,21
37,More like a three star hotel,"We stayed at this property for four nights and although, the location is great the hotel is at best average. We had reservations for a deluxe room and upon check in were given a room on the first floor facing a patch of rocks and metal bars. The girl who checked us in was rather inept and rude and claimed that it was the only room available. After a call to the manager they miraculously found a room on the fifth floor which was more acceptable but still rather small and average. The housekeeping was also a huge disappointment. Two days in a row we had to call to get the room cleaned. The buffet breakfast was fine but pricey for what it was. We did however have a good experience with the concierge staff and found them very helpful and knowledgable.",3,2016,10,21
37,Quality and service,"I'm staying at Le Meridien for another business trip to Barcelona and the service is excellent as usual. The room I'm in is overlooking Las Ramblas and one can feel the vibrant energy that is Barcelona.

The location is superb for walking around and getting to know the gothic quarter, also it's a stone's throw away from the more chic areas and the sea front.

Every Le Meridien hotel
I've stayed at has very high  standards of customer service and quality and I'm not disappointed with my stay.

",5,2016,10,19
37,Fabulous hotel in the heart of old Barcelona,"Certainly Le Meridien must be one of the best hotels in Barcelona, very upscale and luxurious- earns it 5 stars!  Lobby, bar, dining, and staff all top notch and professional. Included breakfast was like a cruise ship buffet only better. Excellent room,bath, and very comfortable bed with 2 pillow sizes to accommodate your preference-a first!. Great location on La Rambla, in the heart of all of the best that old Barcelona has to offer.
Treat yourself. Worth it.",5,2016,10,18
37,Good Location Modern Hotel,"Very nice hotel right in the middle of all the action - bars and restaurants.  Quiet considering how busy the area is.  The hotel staff was very nice and helpful.  They even let us borrow converters!  

Very modern hotel and rooms are not too large on the cozy side but perfect for 2.  We had a king room.

",4,2016,10,18
37,Bon Dia Barcelona!,"Stayed here three nights prior to an AMAWaterways cruise.  Easily reached from the Aerobus drop off on Place Catalunya.  Location just off La Ramblas made for lots of hectic activity on that strip when the big cruise ships were in.  That aside we enjoyed our stay here.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Our room on the second floor faced rooftops but protected us from street noise.  Bed was great, plenty of room to move around.  Light switches were a challenge, especially after a long travel day.  The location is great for exploring on foot some interesting areas and some amazing wine and tapas.  ",5,2016,10,18
37,Perfect Location & Perfect Hotel,"We were on the top floor in a sleek, modern suite. Our room overlooked Barcelona. We would walk out the door of the hotel and could be anywhere in Barcelona within 10 to 15 minutes either walking or taking a taxi.  The staff was amazing and so helpful.  An amazing place to stay!",5,2016,10,18
37,Lap of Luxury...Almost Perfect,"We arrived in Barcelona Friday during evening rush hour. When we got to the hotel they were also very busy- but we were taken care of quickly.

The rooms are beautiful and the bed was huge and covered in fluffy and soft bedding.  Decor was modern and spare but was stylish. Large tv and closet with all amenities. 
The shower was large and there was plenty of light in the bathroom.  We were facing La Rambla- which meant there was some early- morning noise- even with windows shut- but the view was terrific.

Breakfast is a huge event with everything you can imagine- from pastries to fresh omelets to fruit to cereal- and there was non-dairy milk available.  Service was friendly and our coffee cups were always filled.

A bit of a splurge but worth it. The only glitch was that we had  to go and get our bags after checking in because they were not sent up. The lobby was busy and they forgot.  A minor thing- but a detail that should have been covered.  

Location was excellent- and we were able to shop and return packages and head back out.  

We generally prefer boutique hotels - but Le Meridiene is really very nice.  We will consider returning.",4,2016,10,16
37,Nice hotel & perfect location to explore Barcelona!,"Overall, we had a great stay at the Le Meridien in Barcelona.  The location is perfect - situated on bustling La Rambla, 2 min walk to La Boqueria (food market), and an easy walk to the Gothic Quarter, beach and La Pedrera.  The front of house & concierge staff were excellent - friendly, helpful and efficient.  We used SPG points for free nights so had a basic room - rather small but well designed for efficiency of space.  We had a view of an adjacent lane directly overlooking the apartments across the way (didn't bother us, but may be an issue if you like privacy - the blackout curtains are good though if you don't mind not having any natural light).  The bathroom was lovely, well designed, good ventilation, great hot water albeit a little low in pressure at peak times.   The buffet breakfast was excellent - the staff here deserve special mention: efficient, friendly, remembered our favourite table & coffee preferences each day.  The spa was also excellent - wonderful spa therapists, great spa menu & reasonably priced.  Where we felt the hotel fell below standard was with the housekeeping - our room had a glass bathroom door with a terrible ""cracking"" noise of the hinge which seemed loud enough to wake up the entire floor every time you decided to go to the bathroom, our minibar was never re-stocked (to the credit of the checkout staff, when I reported this at checkout he apologised & granted our minibar usage as complimentary), and our room service was completely missed/forgotten one day. Had we been paying the usual room rack rate we would have been disappointed with these aspects of the hotel which fall below the usual Le Meridien standards.  That being said, SPG points or not, the standard should be consistently high throughout whether you are paying guests or using points for awards nights. Overall, we did enjoy our stay at the Le Meridien.  Location and staff were definite positives which outweighed some of the below-par aspects, and we would have no hesitation staying here again.",4,2016,10,11
37,"Good Location, Staff was Friendly",Average Hotel but in a good location.  The rooms were nothing special but comfortable.  I f we went back to Barcelona I would try a different Hotel but remember you re not in your room much because your busy exploring this wonderful city!,4,2016,10,11
37,Average stay,"Our stay at the Le Meridien in Barcelona was quite average. Much more was expected given the very expensive price and hotel description. 

The overall facilities are good and they have a restaurant which is not bad. The room was also fine, but quite small. Overall, everything was alright in this regard, but really nothing special. The hotel is quite highly priced and you do expect something 'amazing' for that kind of money. 

The service was a little inconsistent. Some staff were very nice and helpful while others were not. For instance, we had arrived with quite large suitcases and there were 3-4 staff watching us carry them from the sidewalk into the hotel (going up a few steps) but none of them had offered any help, which is a little strange for a 5-star hotel. Some other similar instances had occurred during our stay. 

Overall, the hotel is not bad but just is not really worth the price. There are many other hotels which we had looked at prior to our trip which were much cheaper (4-5 star hotels at around 40-50% the price of this hotel) and probably will offer the same facilities and service. We had decided to visit this hotel as we had thought that it would offer something special but, unfortunately, it was quite average. Our rating would be 3+ out of 5. ",3,2016,10,08
37,Indifference to the hotel guests!,"It began with the inconsistency of the paid and having the room and then the staff just did not notice its guests! No one even offered to bring things to taxis, etc., and this despite the presence of five stars! Not cozy atmosphere had to change hotel! The only advantage of this hotel's convenient location!",3,2016,10,07
37,Le Meridian standard,"The location is perfect to explore the city. The rooms are good, but not very quite. Unfortunately is the service far below standard; some people in our group were offered breakfast for a reduced price others not, even it was same reservation. At the time we stayed there were two conferences. This lead to a significant shortage of taxis. We waited 75!! min to get a taxi and missed a business appointment. When we complained at the hotel the service manager first pretended to not know nor be aware that there were two conferences ongoing. There was no information upfront that this could lead to a shortage if taxis.",3,2016,10,06
37,A perfect stay in a perfect location.,"We stayed at the Meridien Barcelona for 4 nights in September 2016 (very recently).
Our room was beautiful, modern and chic with lots of natural light and superior amenities.
We had the tasting menu in the hotel restaurant one evening- with 4 excellent wine selections and four wonderful courses for about 45 euro-a great deal for a meal of this superior quality.
Last but not least the staff was wonderful. We left a cell phone in our room and called from the train station. Olga, a consummate professional, located the phone, contacted our next hotel in Sevilla to let them know she was sending the phone to them so it would be there when we arrived, and then called us back to let us know it was all taken care of.
Really, what more could you hope for from a hotel.  Oh yes, and the concierge services were great. Highly recommend it!",5,2016,10,06
37,Hotel Disappointing but Barcelona was great,"So we had great expectations for Barcelona and these were met once you take the Hotel component out of the equation.  For the exorbitant rates that we paid for this hotel, we expected a 6 star experience but ended up with something like a 3 star one.  The items in particular which disappointed us were:

- Concierge service was pretty much non existent - The recommendations for restaurants were very poor.
- The dress code of the staff left alot to be desired. No ties, etc. 
- Wifi in the rooms was very slow,
- Construction noise in a neighboring Hotel room disturbed us on a few occasions. -- We were never advised of any construction happening.
- No Breakfast was included in our rate which makes no sense giving the high rate.  We requested management to review the issue however no one ever responded.
- Rooms were ok but looked dated and lacking the usual technology aids one would expect these days such as USB charging points, universal sockets, wift connectivity to TV, Bluetooth speaker etc. 
- Iron Board in the room was too small.
- No Video on Demand (VOD) to view movies etc.  Minimum selection of TV Channels.
- When trying to order some room service at 5pm in the afternoon, our phone just rang out continiously.  We therefore just went to the lobby cafe and got our own Teas and Coffees. 
- Selection of cakes and snacks at Cafe lobby bar was barely nothing.

So not a good experience at all.  This Hotel does not meet the 5 star requirements it is suppose to in our opinion. We finally asked for a late check out, the best which was offered was 3pm.

We ultimately believed that we would have a great experience at this hotel given the name, brand and rates which we paid however it was anything but.  The positive thing we can take away from it however is that Barcelona is a great city and we were busy out and about touring the numerous sites in the City.",2,2016,10,06
37,Terrific location and service,"Amazing location on La Rambles
Great property
Stayed in the suite which was v spacious for a family of 4
Highly recommended 
Bang in the middle of everything
Very comfortable 
Will definitely go again
V helpful concierge and reception

37,3 day visit,"Hotel is very well located near Las Ramblas (walking street), check-in efficient, staff helpful, breakfast very good, room very comfortable & clean  but a little tired. Lots to see within walking distance with many excellent restaurants.",4,2016,10,04
37,"Le Meridien Barcelona, Spain","This is a beautiful, centrally located hotel.  It is on Ramblas in the heart of everything.
We walked everywhere from our location.  The Port is not that far and there are many eating places. The staff was great and our accomodations were excellent.",5,2016,10,04
37,It was ok.,"The hotel was ok, had friendly staff, and in a good location. But, overall, I wasn't impressed. My room felt small and it took forever to figure out all the light switches. If I go to Barcelona again, I'd check out other hotels, but I wouldn't have a problem staying there again. ",3,2016,10,01
37,Delivered everything we expected,"The Meridien Barcelona is situated on the busy, tourist street of La Rambla. The location can be noisy and difficult to navigate, but has the benefit of being close to all the main attractions and minutes from the food market. Our room was very nice, spacious and sound-proofed from the noise outside. Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel delivers the standard Meridien experience. IF you want something more typical of Barcelona then this probably isn't the hotel for you, but for us it was ideal.",5,2016,09,29
37,Perfect location,"This place has been owned by more corporations than Caesars Palace.  It is a corporate hotel atmosphere place.  It could be in any city.  Restaurant food and bar are outstanding.  Wait staff beyond good.  However, the hotel has no feel of Barcelona.  Inside you could be in Houston.

The location could not be better located.  Right on La Rambla, short walk to the Gothic Quarter, Short walk to outstanding restaurants, continuous access to cabs, and other than pickpockets, a very safe feeling place.",4,2016,09,27
37,A farewell to Spain,"The last stop on our Golf tour, and a great finishing hotel. Not as spacious as our reorts but not bad, right on las Ramblas so was handy to everything we wanted. was a pian to get the bus close but it is a city property, so that can always be tough.",5,2016,09,25
37,Great location and warm friendly staff,"We arrived from Philadelphia Sept 12 with plans to meet up with 'Taulk Tours '1 week in Spain' group on Sept 14.  Our room was more than adequate, their breakfast buffets were plentiful and very varied.  The location was great for walking, but what certainly made our stay even better was their consierge, Bruno.  Bruno came down to the business center to help my friends and I on the computers / schedule, book and pay for sites we wanted to do our own.  He was never in a rush and answered several of our questions about Spanish cultures besides his great recommendation to 'off the main street' restaurants that natives go to.  

",4,2016,09,24
37,"Good hotel, great location","Stayed here for a weekend break, was a good comfortable hotel in a great location just a few steps from the busy Ramblas.   Hotel room was comfortable.   Bar was a little on the quiet side, but you don't go to Barcelona for a weekend to stay in the hotel bar.   All in all, very pleased and would book again.",4,2016,09,23
37,Le Meridien Barcelona,I spend long time trying to chose between Le Meridien and W in Barcelona. The final decision was Le Meridien due to it convenient location directly on La Rambla. Very convenient to get to and from the Airport since the Aerobus to the airport is between 5 minutes of walking. However this probably will exhaust the benefits of the hotel. Despite low occupancy at the hotel at that time wasn't much for the Platinum recognition and No room upgrade. I read many reviews that typically this Le Meridien upgrade Platinum members to Suite...well not for me. I got the room category I reserved with no view. Again I would understand IF the Hotel would be busy...but it wasn't. For the price they charge it's not worth it. I wish I would chose W instead of Le Meridien in Barcelona.,3,2016,09,21
37,Barkin' round Barcelona...,"We arrived in Barcelona 5 days ago.  The Le Meridian is an awesome hotel.  The staff was super friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable.  It is right on the Rambla in the heart of the city.  Everything was within walking distance.  I recommend taking the Hop-on - Hop-off bus at the end of the street.  It takes you all over Barcelona and lets you see all the sights.  You can then get on and off wherever you like.  It is a wonderful, magical city and Le Meridian makes it even more special.",5,2016,09,21
37,The Suite Life,"We got to the hotel late after a long flight. The first room they put us in had two twin beds.. not going to work for a married couple celebrating a birthday. After going back downstairs to see what they could do I was prepared for the standard ""there's nothing else available"" line.  The front desk and the manager went above and beyond and upgraded us to the Prestige suite.  The suite is beautiful and spacious with a view looking right at Las Ramblas. I loved the hardwood floors (as a germaphobe I always feel they are cleaner than carpet). There will be some noise from Las Ramblas, but its Spain, what else do you expect? Great location, great rooms, and great service.",5,2016,09,21
37,"Great hotel, just one small thing","This hotel was in a great location - my room overlooked Las Ramblas but the walls were thick enough so I wasn't awake all night with the noise.  The room was larger for European standards and very clean.  The entire staff in the lobby was incredibly nice and helpful.  However, there was one small thing that I hated.  The bathroom door wasn't a typical door - you couldn't really close it as it was just a swinging door without a latch. Plus it was a semi-frosted door.  This door made the entire room uncomfortable for sharing with my dad.  This feature would be a deal breaker for my next stay if I wasn't alone.",4,2016,09,19
37,A week at le meridian,Spent a week at Le Meridian in Barcelona. Hotel rooms are small but functional. bathroom was moden and also a functional size. Hotel is situated next to la Rambla - a popular tourist spot and a short walk to the Gothic quarter. Good number of small restaurants near by away from the main tourist area. ,4,2016,09,19
37,Oasis from business chaos,"Quieter rooms on the back. When on international business travel I want sleep not views. Just enough Barcelona city drifted in through the windows to give a ""far from home"" feel. Public areas are well appointed. Staff is helpful. Central location to catch the metro or taxi or post business stroll.

It's a Starwood joint and delivers on the promise. The hotel soaps are the best I have ever used. Wanted to buy but they don't sell. :-(",4,2016,09,18
37,Good not great.,"Good location, right off of Las Ramblas and close to Plaza de España, restaurants, Boquerias market, Cristobal Colon's monument all and more within walking distance. If you are looking for a hotel that's centrally located in Barcelona this is it. Rooms and beds were tiny, staff was very friendly, the bar and restaurant were equally good. All in all, the most you get at this hotel is the location.",3,2016,09,18
37,"Location, location, location","We highly appreciated the service at the reception, the concierge, and in the mornings at the excellent breakfast buffet.  Each of the members of staff was extremely polite and courteous.

Location is everything, and the hotel being situated right at La Rambla it is not far to anything – whether shopping-centres, harbour, beach or restaurants.  The only thing, the entrance of the hotel, as you would assume from the address,  is not right on La Rambla, but just around the corner in a little side road.

The room we had booked via Voyage Privé was called a “deluxe”-room and even though being spacious and equipped with a wonderful huge stand-in shower we had expected something nicer. We were told that the type of room we stayed were all called “superior”. For being in the vivid centre of Barcelona the room we had was very quiet – we did not hear a single noise of the town, at any time of the night – but this we had been told by the receptionist “warning” us that our room would face to the rear of the hotel.  As such, the view was simply the rear walls or roofs of houses.  The window of the room was so small that even at a nice summer day you were obliged to use the light, and last but not least you could not even open the window completely.

What disappointed us in this “five-star hotel” (we wouldn’t give it 5) was the so called Spa area – it was so small that I could call my shower at home a Spa and you will find bigger and nicer ones in private houses. Secondly, it was far from being neat and clean – the “whirlpool” on the balcony was used by the parents and their small kids as a padding pool – which led us to the presumption that the water is probably not very hygienic. 
When I claimed that both, the Sauna as well as the steam bath, were too cold and that, especially on the latter one, the intervals of hot steam were too long I was told that it is only for the security of the guests. The fact that no instruction plate was installed or laid out anywhere, and the fact that on one of the two evenings we were up there was no responsible person available makes me think what was meant by “security of the guests”.  Interestingly enough, after having remarked that both areas are too cold, I had to realize that on my second visit both had been shot off completely.
Last but not least – the Spa-area did not have sufficient towels and the floors were wet and slippery (no warning).
At least, I must admit, the “responsible” person we saw on our second visit to the SPA must have missed the lessons on client service.

We would return to the hotel, but we certainly would not agree to the 5 stars.",4,2016,09,18
37,Hustle and bustle ,"This hotel is located off of the extremely crowded street of las ramblas. Upon check in, I was surprised at how small the spaces were inside the hotel. I was expecting bigger areas from looking at the pictures online. I didn't have any issues with the cleanliness of the room, although I am used to bigger living spaces.  While the location is excellent, the hustle and bustle of the surrounding areas make this location a bit less desirable. ",4,2016,09,16
37,Great location ,"Great hotel, great location in the heart of the city. A bit expensive but would definitely come back. No pool if you have kids! Noisy at night. Rooms were spacious and staff were very friendly. Only complaint was shower in the bath, if you are less agile it would be hard to get in",4,2016,09,16
37,over rated,"the hotel is located on the La Rambla street among other many hotels. the location is not unique and you can find other hotels with better rates and better service.

I personally chose this hotel because of the well known name which turned out to be a great disappointment. the lobby is crowded in the afternoons and  the front desk staff are unprofessional and make several errors ,

to be fair the concierge and bellboy are very helpful and polite.

 I would recommend going to  another 4 star nearby hotel with better prices",3,2016,09,13
37,Beautiful & Central ,"Just back from staying 6 nights here.

Absolutely bang in the middle of everything that you would look for in a city break.

Lovely room with all we needed & Every single member of staff that we encountered ( bar none ) were extremely friendly and courteous.

Lovely food,great bar service & we would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel. ",5,2016,09,12
37,Love the staff and facilities ,"We stayed here two years ago and we're excited to return. Beautiful rooms and close to many sites and the metro stop. We don't like to eat on La Rambla, but so many places are still close. A market, the beach, sandwich shops. Any a visit to Palau Guell was included with every stay. This is a five minute walk and an amazing museum of Antony Gaudi's work. Quite the bonus!
Plenty of storage in the room and take the stairs a few times, so you can see the circle sculpture. ",5,2016,09,09
37,Fabulous location,"Perfect position to wander the Ramblas  and so many interesting walks from this Hotel. Upgraded room meant we had a balcony overlooking the Ramblas, exciting 24/7.  Breakfast was great and the service impeccable. Unfortuneately if dining  during any other part of the day,  the attention was abysmal and conflicting stories as to what menu is available and very tardy service.  Would not rate this a 5star property at any stretch . The concierge helped us in all ways.",4,2016,09,09
37,Definitely not a 5 Star!,"Perhaps Spain has less than quality hotels, but to rate this hotel as a five star is ridiculous.  It would not even be a four star in France, Italy and definitely not the United States.  The rooms were beyond small, even though we upgraded to beyond a deluxe.  There was no tub in our room, even though one was advertised and a necessity for me (and I never could get the ""rain"" shower to work).  The bed was soft.  The sheets passable at best.  The restaurant lacked ambience and the tappas were incredibly greasy.  We only stayed here as a precursor to a cruise (thank goodness).  Oh, our room looked right into a wall (no kidding).  The location is wonderful if you like to be on the main, very crowded, tacky tourist street where the best thing they sell is a key chain with a picture of ""Barcelona"" or you want an ice cream cone.  I couldn't wait to get out of this dark, dreary room.",3,2016,09,08
37,Perfectly located,"Spent a week here in Barcelona and Le Meridian was the perfect place to stay. Location was great for seeing all the sites. Walk to beaches, shopping and sightseeing. The staff was extremely friendly. Rooms were clean hip and modern with spacious bathroom and amazing showers. Air conditioning worked great which was good because the first part of the week was overly hot! Nice bar and American breakfast buffet. If we ever come back to Barcelona we would not hesitate to stay here.",5,2016,09,08
37,"Some Good, Some Bad","We were using Starwoods points to stay at this hotel. We arrived early after a flight from the U.S. Knowing check-in wasn't until 4:00 pm we checked our bags and went off for a walk on La Rambla which is just outside the hotel. 

We returned at 2:00 pm hopeful of an early check-in. The staff indicated they believed our room was being cleaned and so rather than wander off we took a seat in the lobby. That became a mistake because as we sat there couples and groups walked up and were immediately given keys and were off to our room. 

In the final analysis part of the problem was us. We were jet lagged and cranky. In theory as SPG members they were trying to give us our ""upgrade"" and that is why we were not given a standard room immediately. But it worked against them. Apparently some other SPG guests had taken advantage of the 4:00 pm late check out which meant our room was not even gotten to until late in the afternoon. Or at least that this the story they gave me when I demanded to see the Manager on Duty at 4:15 pm. 

The lobby was nearly empty when they finally summoned us and gave us our room keys at 4:25 pm. There was nothing overly special about the room. It was on the second floor without a view and did not appear to be what I would have considered an upgrade. For our trouble the MOD had given us a coupon for two free drinks at the hotel bar. 

What was good is that I had been corresponding with one of the concierges and his advice was spot on. He gave us suggestions on how to get to attractions, how to use the metro system and a recommendation (and a reservation) for our final night's dinner. Kudos to Bruno. 

The bell boys were always asking if they could help although the one time we wanted a cab, they could not be found. The bartender in the bar, Le Pop, was wonderful. 

A nice hotel in the heart of the tourist district on La Rambla but flawed service. I would certainly stay here again and just hope for better hospitality.",4,2016,09,07
37,Superb hotel and great location!,"Le Meridien is right in the middle of the Barcelona action on La Ramblas!  The location could not be better for nightlife, shopping, sightseeing, food.  As this was  our first time in Barcelona, we opted for this location.  I went for morning runs to the beach, walked to shopping, ate in the nice hotel resturant and bar.  The concierge was very very helpful and she gave us many great recommendations of things to do.  We had an extra large room that slept 3 comfortabky with a nice bathroom and shower.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2016,09,07
37,"Classic Le Meridien, nothing more","We stayed at the family suite. I hate it once the couch opens, there's no moving space. But the balcony was great. The check in / check out is slow because of crowds (need more staff but the staff is courteous and helpful despite being short handed).Free wifi is always good. The location is good but so are all hotels on Ramblas. Search a little more before booking. Can do better.",3,2016,09,07
37,"Nice hotel, great locaton","Good-sized, clean comfortable room with great air conditioning. Nice bar and restaurant in the lobby, with separate coffee bar. Free wi-fi. Location on La Rambla is perfect, near shops, restaurants, bars and the spectacular St. Josep de la Boqueria market.",4,2016,09,05
37,Great location and service,"Spent a week in Barcelona using this hotel as our home base. Nice hotel, clean and reasonable prices. Wish they had upgraded my room as a platinum Starwood member but still busy tourist season. No concerns and would stay here again with my wife. Had used thus hotel as base for multiple business trips with no disappointment, can always count on Starwood to support you.",4,2016,09,05
37,Location Location Location,"Le Meridien Barcelona is a sleek, contemporary hotel perfectly located in the heart of the city. It is within very easy walking distance to the Plaza de Catalunya around which all of Barcelona buzzes; it is on the Ramblas with its wonders and zaniness and terrific insofar as taxis and the Metro. That all said, it is quiet! A lovely, peaceful palce where the city disappears. The service is superb, very attentive and quick to resolve any questions or problems; the front desk staff are young, hip, charming and beautifully multilingual. Rooms are zen chic in woods and monochrome schemes which contribute to the sleek but comforting vibe.",5,2016,09,04
37,exceptional,"Location is perfect for tourist activity. It is actually one building around the corner from Ramblas – the only entrance from Ramblas is their café/restaurant. From the hotel you can walk to Bocqueria, Gothic Quarter, Plaza Catalunya, Palau de Musica, and more. Ramblas is very active with a wide walking section between the street.
We had no view from our room. The room was quiet. The bathroom was large. The shower alone was approximately 6 feet by 4 feet with wall and ceiling showerheads.
Reception/Desk staff were nice.
There is a taxi stop in front of the hotel in case you need one.

A room that included breakfast was an extra $43 (USD) per night. Breakfast was very good there, and also very convenient, but if you want to reduce the cost there are some other breakfast options nearby.
There was free wifi in the room and hotel area.",5,2016,09,01
37,Not just a good holiday hotel - a very efficient Business hotel too,"Stayed here for two nights on a business trip. 
Very efficient hotel. 
Staff were charming and extremely helpful (Alessandro Silva at reception in particular). 
Room was clean and spacious. 
Good bed, decent pillows. Sadly, no bath tub - shower only. 
Very good breakfast buffet. 
Concierge certainly know their stuff. 
Location is perfect - right on La Rambla. 
Will definitely stay here again.",4,2016,09,01
37,Hotel needs a revamp,"This hotel is well situated close to all major shops etc, however its in a desperate need for a revamp.  The rooms and decor are looking tired and old!!!
Reception staff is not very helpful.  My standard requirement is a free standing shower, which my travel agent booked and confirmed.  When I checked into my room this was not the case.  I asked for my room to be changed it was declined saying that they are fully booked.  Only when my agent called suddenly a room became available and I was moved!!!",3,2016,08,27
37,"La Meridien, Barcelona","You won't find a hotel with a better location in Barcelona!  Within walking distance to many of the historical areas of Barcelona, and only a few blocks away from the amazing covered market, The Boqueria, the Le Meridien keeps you close to the action, yet is a peaceful respite from the busyness of Las Ramblas.

Our room was small, but well equipped, and quiet.  The breakfast, which was included with our room, was terrific!  Not to mention, at least two terrific restaurants are located literally steps away from the hotel, directly across the street!  

I would definitely stay at the Le Meridien again, when I return to Barcelona!",5,2016,08,24
37,I'm done waiting for a reply that will never come,"I have stayed at this hotel many many times. I have written prior reviews of this hotel, praising it and the staff. Now, for whatever reason, this place has gone downhill on the cleanliness factor, and they know it and try to make excuses.

I am a seasoned traveler. I am platinum 75 with SPG, Lifetime Diamond with Hyatt, Platinum Elite with Marriott, and many others. I spend as many as 200 nights a year traveling and working, and I chose to use my SPG Points and upgrades to have a really wonderful vacation in my very favorite city. That came to an abrupt halt immediately upon arrival.

Taxi from the airport, no one to help with my bags. I had been traveling in Europe for 2 months and had two bags, normally I drag them myself, but not up the stairs.

The  initial service at reception was chilly, the room I had booked and requested seemingly unavailable for me, maybe in a few days, well that doesn't fly with me. Booked well in advance, absolutely no reason in my mind for this to happen, at this hotel, but it did.

The room they assigned me was a standard run of the mill room on the fourth floor, with the sounds of Rambla, but not really a view room overlooking. However that was not really the problem, the problem was that the room was filthy, and the bathroom was full of BLACK MOLD. I reported it immediately, the next day, they found another room, a few doors over and guess what, a suite, with BLACK MOLD in the bathroom.

I'm not talking a little spot in a corner, but all over the shower, every crevice crack and in between the grout. I took pictures I even took video, knowing that I was going to get some crazy answer that it was something else. Of course I did get an answer, dirt, that black mold in both rooms a few doors apart, not mold, our engineer and housekeeping say it's not mold.

I know what mold is, room number 3 day number 3 of my hard earned vacation and not so well spent points and upgrades, I finally get not only the room I requested, ( a room I have stayed in before and requested,) but no mold. 

From then on it was a reasonably pleasant stay.

My biggest concern is obviously the mold, and the filthy conditions of the first two rooms. Not once did I receive an apology. Not once did the GM, who was on Holiday, make an effort to contact me. Weeks later, still no contact. Not a single offer of replacing 10's of thousands of points, for the first wasted days of my well deserved vacation.

Now SPG may have sold out to Marriott, and that could be a good thing. However on an individual property basis, this hotel needs to not only fire their housekeepers, they need to fire their supervisors, there is NO EXCUSE, and no coincidence that two rooms on the same floor had this problem, I guarantee that other rooms are or were in the same filthy shape. This does not occur unless it's left unclean for a very long time, mold is not overnight, and the amount of mold, was horrifying. I took two cotton swabs and on video, in a one inch spot it peeled off like thick mashed potatoes, and it was throughout the shower. In another I used a white washcloth, that went black.

I loved this hotel, had fond memories, love the city and used to love the staff.

I had long discussions that seem now like wasted time, as were the first days of my stay. It's a shame, shame on management and staff, shame on Le Meridien, shame on SPG.",1,2016,08,23
37,Perfect in Every Way!,"I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 nights with some friends for a girls getaway to Spain. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. this hotel is in the perfect location. It is within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, supermarkets, and is right near where a lot of the tours pick-up. The hotel itself is updated, clean, and the rooms are excellent! the bathrooms are huge and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and will stay here again upon returning to Barcelona. I give this hotel 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!!!

Just a quick note: This hotel does not have a pool.",5,2016,08,23
37,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location in easy walking distance to many must see sites. The rooms are well appointed, the mattresses are really comfortable, and all the amenities you need are available. Our room overlooked Las Rambla and intially I  thought it would be very noisy but there are excellent soundproofing windows and we weren't  disturbed at all. There was a muffled rumbling noise but I think that was from a subway running beneath the hotel. At any rate, it wasn't  annoying. The waterfall shower was great and robes and slippers are provided. The staff is most excellent....all of our needs were anticipated right down to providing area maps before we asked. The restaurant was OK. We ate dinner there one evening. The salmon was tasty but the ravioli was overwhelmed by onion. Breakfast was excellent. Tip...read  the info packs placed on ur bed. Tucked inside was a complimentry pass to Gaudi's Palau Guell (if u need more ask the concierge). The palace  is in easy walking distance of the hotel and is a must see! Oh, and visit the roof for a great view!",4,2016,08,20
37,Little things missing to get a higher rating,"To state one thing right at the beginning: The hotel is a good hotel and there is no reason not to recommend anybody to choose it: It is well maintained, the rooms are good, the staff is nice and helpful and the location is just perfect, when you want to do something in downtown Barcelona - no matter if you are traveling as a tourist or on a business trip.

However, there is always a ....""but"" - and here it comes:
Hotel prices in Barcelona during August are simply just crazy! Even in the ""cheaper"" hotel chains you have to calculate almost 200€ a night. So the Meridian was almost 300€ per night. But for 300€ per night, there should be a little ""more"". In my opinion there is the following room for improvement:
- Lobby: Reception is small, always busy and loud. Especially that there are only 4 positions available let long waiting lines form during the busy hours of the day. A different arrangement would allow more space for additional positions on the counter and help to avoid lineups
- Rooms: As stated before, the room I stayed in was nice. But there could have been a little more decoration and maybe better for free coffee/tee and maybe a fresh fruit a day. Should be possible when you charge almost 300€
- breakfast: You pay 300€ a night - for sure breakfast is not included but another 27,50€...fine with me, but then the buffet needs more to offer than actually presented. And the quality of the food needs to be better as well. For example the bread did not appear to be made on the same day all the time.

I still gave the hotel 4 points because it was more than average for sure, but either the prices need to get lower or some improvement should be done - at least in my opinion.",4,2016,08,19
37,Best hotel I have stayed in Barcelona,"I stayed twice at the Le Meridien Barcelona. It is not inexpensive, but I loved it both times. The first time I had a huge bath in a small room. The second time I was on an upgraded floor and had a big room and a smaller bath. Both rooms were great, servcie is top notch and the hotel is beautiful. There is also a grocery almost next door on Las Ramblas for fruit, snacks and sandwiches.",5,2016,08,18
37,Great Location .. Ok Hotel,"We are loyal SPG members which is why we chose this hotel.  It is right on Las Ramblas so you are literally steps away from all the action of downtown Barcelona.

This central location was amazing for hitting all the sights and to go out for dinner and exploring.

The hotel was not up to snuff I terms of a five star hotel.  The staff we dealt with were great and service was good.

We just found the other services just ok.. Including the restaurants and business center.

If you get a good deal and don't need too much from your hotel then this is a good option for its location.

",4,2016,08,18
37,"Great location, mediocre as a whole","We have been to Barcelona before and coming back with a small child, we wanted this hotel given its great location at the Ramblas and the 'family friendly' reviews.  We were also attracted to the family suite concept but it did not appear to be available at booking so we just did a regular room for our brief stay to sample.

The location is hard to beat, just a few blocks away from the Boqueria - it is a great place to be.   The staff was nice and polite, although lacking in judgement.   We did not get any upgrades we typically get as SPG Gold but we are understanding of that knowing that it is based on timing and availability.

The property is newly renovated and looks nice.   Bedroom is clean.  That said, the bathroom did not seem to be clean (yes, Starwood, we also noted on your survey).   It appeared to be clean but it had the strong combined stench of urine and cleaner.  We have been to old structures in Europe that had bathrooms with the old plumbing/sewer smell but the Le Meridien Barcelona bathroom reminded you of an overused airport WC.   No matter how sleek your surroundings are while brushing your teeth, it is hard to shake off this issue.

In terms of our stay - they make it clear they welcome children - with the lego set at check in.   One thing that was a big turn off was charging adult buffet breakfast price for a 4-year old.   This is our first time ever to have experienced that in any hotel anywhere.  Sure we are happy to pay - but seriously - full price?   I did ask about that, and the staff had this roundabout nonsensical excuse for it.  Seeing the lack of logic, we did not want to bother with any further discussion and counted this as a lesson learned.   It is ironic they go out of the way with the lego set amenities, but can't get the basics right.

When we go back to Barcelona, this location tempts us and is hard to beat but the average experience for above average price tag, will force us to consider others.",3,2016,08,14
37,"Great modern hotel, excellent location!","This is our second stay at this hotel and stayed again due to its great location, exceptional service and modern renovated rooms.  We love to walk and visit key areas of cities and this hotel is well positioned for you to walk down bustling Las Ramblas, or over to the Gothic Quarters, up towards the Gaudhi buildings, down to the waterfront or to head to the beach.  The hotel staff was attentive to our needs and made the stay quite enjoyable, and provided great advice on what to see and where to eat.  Also, it is located right next door to ""Le Carrefour"" supermarket which makes it easy to grab ready made food either for the room or for your day out.",5,2016,08,13
37,Do not stay here,"I travel for a living. I'm an spg gold member and platinum or diamond with most other chains. I stayed here on a recommendation that it was a great place. It was anything but that. The staff are rude, they don't care about your stay. The room they ""upgraded me to was not an upgrade. I asked several times to be moved into a room that was not so beaten up and had working door security but was told sorry, you booked on Expedia. Numerous staff over 3 days managed to make you feel like you are inferior and almost talk down to you right away. The only nice person is the barista , he remembers your name and makes you a great coffee with a smile. 
SPG should be ashamed of this hotel, our room was trashed, carpets were gross, the door security was broken, the bedside lights were all bent and the list goes on. When brought to the attention of the front staff, they did not care, but always took time to remind you that you are only a gold member and sorry you booked this thru Expedia, like they were shaming me for that. My fiancé had the same experience with all the staff. 
I'm a pro travelled and am a diamond member at Hilton, platinum at fairmont and sit top tier at many other top chains. I usually don't stay at spg anymore as j find their perks not really perks. Like they make free coffee in the room a big thing lol. 
If you want to pay top dollar for a hotel in Barcelona then stay across the street at the H1898. It's amazing and has way better ammenities like a rooftop patio and pool. They are also nice to you for no other reason than to be nice to you, even when you are not staying there. 
I cannot overstate that the le meridien is a horrible place to stay, many guests I spoke to felt the same while chatting in the lobby etc. 
but if you like paying big money to get treated terribly and stay in a dirty run down room, this is a great hotel for sure. ",2,2016,08,12
37,Great Hotel for Families/Perfect Location,"We recently took a 5-day, 4 night trip to Barcelona. We booked two rooms at the Le Meridien on Las Ramblas and were very pleased with the accommodations. the rooms were spacious and clean.   We travel with our teenagers so we need two rooms.  one of the rooms 510, was on the preferred floor and it excellent for a couple.  Room 311 was smaller and less deluxe, but very comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the rooms and hotel were overall despite being located right on Las Ramblas, perhaps the busiest street/walkway in the all of Barcelona.  The location was super convenient to the subway, attractions, food, cafes bus tours, the beach, the open markets, etc.  The staff was very nice, accomodating and helpful.  Our check in was super smooth and check out was even better.  The hotel guests were equally nice and there seemed to be a lot of families traveling on vacation.  The gym was a little small for such a large hotel, but it was clean and the equipment was all in working order.   I would recommned this hotel highly to any family or couple travelling for vacation.  And, the restaurant in the hotel is pretty good too. I hear it's best to ask for a room in the ""newer"" part of the hotel, but as I said our rooms 510 and 311 were just great. We will be returning to this hotel and will continue to recommend it to others who want a no fuss, clean, centrally located, well sized rooms hotel.",5,2016,08,10
37,Miguel ruined our stay,Stayed here for 4 nights with my cousin and friend. We accidentally didn't book the day of arrival as we were arriving late/ early hours of the night. When my cousin had spoken to the hotel manager during the day she said it was fine and they would sort something out for us. Unfortunately upon arrival that was not the case. Miguel at reception was really unhelpful and not accommodating. He kept repeating himself and had no compassion or empathy for our situation. The facilities and location of this hotel was good but not enough to save the overall experience. Would not recommend or ever come back to this hotel. The only positive thing I can say about this hotel was the bellboy was really nice. ,2,2016,08,10
37,Vacation in Barcelona ,"Location of hotel is really fantastic. Close shopping streets. Very good restaurants are all walking distance. Rooms are clean and service is quick.

37,"Great location on Las Ramblas, average rooms","We stayed in this hotel in Aug and its location is excellent for tourists visiting Barcelona. Everything is walking distance, and you are in the center of the famous Las Ramblas street.

The rooms are average though. We stayed in the suite and it was large, but very dark and gloomy (they need to put more lights in the rooms). The jacuzzi in the hotel is very small also.

I would still recommend this hotel because of its location.",4,2016,08,09
37,Busy !,"Le Meridien on La Rambla is a hectic, busy place. The line ups for checking in and out are crazy. The lobby has a tired feel to it. For a higher end hotel the lobby should have a bit more ""pizzaz"": flower arrangements or some sort of ornamentation. You can feel the metro rumbling under you in your room. We had a room that overlooked La Rambla, which was nice and the room was a very streamlined decor. The bathroom was very modern but there was a huge step in and out the shower/tub to the floor.  I can't complain as the room was booked in Starwood points but should I be paying my own money to stay, I would chose a different hotel.",3,2016,08,09
37,"Great location, very well appointed, amazing front deck and concierge staff","I convinced 6 friends to try this central Barcelona hotel for a few days after a cruise and couldn't have been happier.  Front desk staff were friendly and helpful and while we waited for our rooms, they provided free tickets to visit Palau Guell - a Gaudi masterpiece a short walk done La Rambla. Rooms were ready well before the 3pm promise and the staff called to let us know.  Concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and restaurant breakfast buffet was great with  attentive, warm staff.  Even the porters were exceptionally effecient and helpful.

37,Great Location for exploring Barcelona,"This hotel is a half block off Las Ramblas which Rick Steves once said was the most heavily traveled tourist area in Europe.  So if you like restaurants, bars, shops, sightseeing, touring, etc. this is an absolutely great location.  And the metro is about one block away so you can get almost anywhere with a minimum of exertion.  The hotel itself is very nice, the staff outstanding, the concierge full of great tips on where to go, the bar quite good, (and there is a nice area on the top floor to look out over part of the town).  If I return to Barcelona in the future, this will be where I will stay because of the location.  And Le Boqueria market is two blocks away, and you can stuff yourself there in one of the many restaurants or vendor stalls,for a very reasonable price.",5,2016,08,03
37,"Fantastic hotel, perfect location","My wife and I have stayed here several times, most recently last week. The staff are always first class, professional, friendly and eager to help. The renovated rooms can be fantastic (some are quite small, as is the norm in Europe, but many are tremendously spacious.) We were delighted to be upgraded to one on the 6th floor with a huge balcony overlooking the city - perfect place to wind down the evening with a drink and a cigar.

The location, right on the La Rambla, is perfect, with easy access to most of the city's attractions and tons of good restaurants and cafes nearby. Highly recommended!",5,2016,08,03
37,Comfortable well positioned,"Warm efficient welcome.
In side street off the main Ramblas so easy to walk to the main Square
Comfortable well appointed room
Nice roomy shower
Good beds clean
Just a very nice stay with helpful staff
My only slight issue is why modern hotels have sliding glass doors on the bathroom rather than a proper door but maybe I'm just old fashioned!
Still would definitely return ",5,2016,08,03
37,Perfect location,"Close to most attractions. The junior suite is a must! Close to the best restaurants, Lobo, Cats.... Would stay there again. Las Ramblas is filled with people all day long, if you can't handle big crowds, this one isn't for you!! The only draw back is no pool.",4,2016,08,01
37,"Attentive staff, large and modern suite, and delicious breakfast","Our cruise planner booked us into Le Meridien for two post-cruise nights.  Even before we checked in, the concierge reserved us tickets for a wonderful flamenco performance, and the level of service was high throughout our stay.  Perfect location on La Rambla, great walking everywhere.  The breakfast was outstanding:  the croissants are made for the hotel, and the churros hit the spot.  Most remarkable was that the hotel found and sent us my husband's hearing aids, which we'd left behind.  We'll be back!",5,2016,08,01
37,Location,Very nice hotel...good mix of hardware and software... Nicely managed...unfortunately no executive lounge..location is excellent..just aside from La Ramblas street...top location and there is a big supermarket and a very famous local Catalan market just around the corner.. Rooms are neat and convenient.. Staff is helpful and professional...breakfast is above average... Also a nice bar/restaurant adjusted...price is medium...,4,2016,08,01
37,An oasis in touristic chaos! :),"I think the title says it all! 
Spent 5 days in this lovely hotel. Great Location especially when travelling with family for leisure. Walking distance to lot of landmarks and attractions in the city. The hotel itself was fantastic both physically as in conditions and also service. Had booked a deluxe room and was a bit concerned prior to arrival about space in room as we needed twin beds and a child rollaway. But even with twin beds and rollaway the room was quiet spacious and well equipped with coffee, tea, kettle etc. so perfect to start your day with a cup of coffee before breakfast. The breakfast service was good, excellent staff, attentive to your needs and professional. Good food too. 
Another special mention goes to the front office staff. A lady by the name of 'Ilaria' checked us in and was a delight! Another mention goes to 'Marc' as well also at the front desk. Both were exceptional, professional, polite and helpful for every need or question. Also at check-out the experience was pleasant thanks to a lady (apologies I didn’t get her name as we were rushing to the airport) who walked us out and enquired if our stay was good and that they look forward to having us back soon. 
The hotel is clean, well designed and beautiful, great location but it’s the staff, the people of this hotel who made all the difference! Cheers to you!",5,2016,07,30
37,Nice hotel in the most touristy place in Barcelona,"Went there for a business trip. Nice room and specially nice shower. The street where it is places its a narrow street always full of tourists, so taxies and cars have it very difficult to go there, much better to just take the car to Plaza Catalunya, which is 2 min away or take the metro in Plaza Catalunya if you wanna go somewhere.",4,2016,07,30
37,Perfect Location ,"Locked on the north end of Los Rambla this luxury hotel is walking distance to everything. Friendly staff, great pick up service at airport easy check in. Excellent cafe just off the lobby. Would stay here again on gh e next trip.",5,2016,07,29
37,"Great location, nice rooms, nice staff","We stayed for 3 nights as part of a tour.  The location is great - 1/2 block off Las Ramblas.  Rooms are very nice.  Staff is helpful.  We did get one piece of bad advice from the front desk.  We told the associate that we were going to see the concierge about getting tickets to Parc Guelle.  She said we should just go - it shouldn't be a problem.  We took a taxi and found that it WAS a problem. There was a two hour wait.  We should have booked in advance.  But, she gave us great advice on everything else including a great place on the water to have lunch.  Breakfasts were very good.  This is a nice place.  We would stay again.",5,2016,07,26
37,Perfect location,"Barcelona is the perfect summer destination.It has all,sight seeing,shopping,culinary opportunities from local sea food to Mediterranean,night life and family activities including biking and visiting beaches.
Its people are among the friendliest,most helpful,and courteous needless to mention their high sense of fashion. The best part is that it's all affordable !!
Le Meridien hotel is right in the center on the Rambla which allows one to go around on foot.you are surrounded by local markets and cafes. All at the hotel are friendly and all smiles.However the hotel has a problem with its doors Key/card system where the keys 
don't after 48hours and you have to change them at the reception.Everytime you need to change ,you have to go through an interrogation about showing identification docs,which happen to be safe locked in your room to which you can't acces because keys are not working.A security officer will escort you to the room to check your docs. If you are unlucky,the receptionist will ask if you are checked in the hotel and have shown official docs at arrival. This happened three times in one week during our stay at Le Meridien. Other than this incident,I would certainly recommend the hotel and the city.Go for it!!",4,2016,07,26
37,Centrally located and friendly staff,I really loved my stay at this hotel located in the heart of the Rambla just a breath away from Passeig the Gracia. Staff is friendly and helpful as well as it is really enjoyable the solarium with hydropool at the top floor. Rooms are big and well appointed as well as the baths! Suggested. Just a point of improvement: some technology allowing the staff to know you are in-room. :),4,2016,07,26
37,Very good hotel but a tad overpriced,"I'm a big fan of Starwood hotels, and take every opportunity to stay in one. As such, the Le Meridien met my expectations from the hotel, but it rarely exceeded them. 

It's an undoubtedly very good hotel, which is extremely well located for tourists. It's at the heart of La Rambla, in the middle of the hubbub. The hotel is well appointed, and feels luxurious when entering. The deluxe rooms, on the other hand, are more business-like than luxurious, and more compact than expected.

That said, it's spotless, well appointed (great bed, high end toiletries, all expected amenities) and comfortable. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly, despite the rush. The ""experience specialist"" writing to me in advance to offer help in planning my trip was a very nice touch.

However, there were a couple of service glitches that I found odd for a Meridien. I had booked a king bed (staying solo) but when I was checked in, I was given a twin bed. Also, I had to wait relatively long for service at the coffee shop/ bar. Neither was a major issue but it was unexpected from a Meridien. 

But the one thing I didn't expect was to come away feeling that the hotel was overpriced. It wasn't just the price of the room (which is largely based on location) but it shows in small things such as the price of the coffee and the cost of the pay-per-view movies. It wasn't the value proposition I expect from LM and was priced closer to a Sheraton and some Westins!

I would recommend the hotel no doubt, since the flaws are relatively minor, the hotel generally very good and the location prime. Just be cognizant of the relatively higher cost.",4,2016,07,26
37,"Comfortable, good location","Comfortable and spacious room, facing the side street and not las ramblas so it was quieter. Nice toiletry selection.
Good amentities, free internet worked fine, convenient coffee bar in the lobby. Had cocktails only in the restaurant downstairs, but everything looked good. Staff were helpful and pleasant.",4,2016,07,26
37,Classy and perfectly located,"Usual Le Meridien experience. Ideally located on La Ramblas and just a few mins walk from the square and many bars/restaurants. Very helpful and kind staff, clean and modern environment. Excellent bar with themed nights. Scrambled eggs at breakfast are possibly the best i have had any where! Invigorating fruit smoothie shots set you up for the day. Can get busy when checking in but otherwise perfect.",5,2016,07,26
37,"Great Hotel, Great Location!","Le  Meridien is an upscale hotel with comfortable rooms, an attentive staff and a prime location. Located on Las Ramblas Le Meridien is two blocks from la Boqueria Mercado a short walk to the historic Gothic Quarter and a 15 minute walk to the water. Taxi cabs are always available in front of the hotel. There is a restaurant located in the building not owned by the hotel with an agreement to service the hotel. We stayed there 3 nights and were very satisfied with every aspect of our time there.",4,2016,07,25
37,Good location. ,"The hotel was very nice, clean, and close to many things including tourist bus stop. The breakfast was also amazing! The staff was friendly and always available to answer questions as needed. The complementary water included for being SPG members was nice too. ",5,2016,07,25
37,Just Good when it should be Perfect,"The hotel is in a great location. The staff when I checked in were perfect, enabling the check in to be swift and prompt. The second day, we have asked for some new towels just as we left for dinner and when we came back 4 hours later we got to our room for them not to be anywhere. We then asked for them AGAIN just as we were about to leave for a quick 15 minute walk and when we got back they were there, however they ended up thrown on our bed. I do not mean to be a pain, but for a 5 star hotel, I expect better. Furthermore, when I went to ask about why they were thrown on the bed, the staff member told me it was my fault because i asked him to rush and housekeeping isn't working. I do not think it matters position you are within a hotel, but it doesn't take much to realise that towels should be folded straight. Otherwise, the hotel was in a good location and the concierge was really helpful with getting restaurant reservations and aiding us with whatever we needed. This hotel is somehow sub par to other Le Meridien properties I have stayed in and there is certainly room for improvement.",3,2016,07,25
37,Great Location,"Very nice hotel with a great location to La rambla , so everything is just few mintues walk.the staff are friendly and very professional,unfortunately there s no swimming pool as the beach is far from the hotel.",4,2016,07,24
37,Fantastic quality and location,"Hotel is well situated in La Rambla, short walk for shops and night life, plenty of restaurants and shops in the locality.
Rooms very clean and well equipped, staff were most cooperative and helpful, kids loved it.
Will absolutely stay in again.",5,2016,07,23
37,Great hotel. Great location. ,Nice hotel directly on the Rambla.   Nice professional desk staff.   Nice rooms some with a terrace.   On the expensive side but the location is worth it.  Try to get a Mediterranean suite - which just a very large room with a big terrace. But a nice place to relax before going out on the town ,5,2016,07,22
37,"Superb service, food and nice environment","Had dinner in here on 20 July 2016 at 2200. Service was outstanding, the restaurant is well decorated and spotlessly clean. Having taken our order the waiter arrived with hot bread rolls and olive oil and anchovies followed by a vegetable and prawn appetiser. The starter course was generous and delicious as was the main and sweet courses. The restaurant manager was extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The entire meal including drinks and coffees was an extremely agreeable 59 euros. Well done to all the staff.
",5,2016,07,20
37,Good stay during our honeymoon,"Get a room on a higher floor - we were on the 2nd floor on an Saturday night Ramblas is LOUD!  The staff was great, recognized our honeymoon with a nice bottle of cava and some small pastry desserts.  Location is right on Ramblas so near the touristy stuff and only a few minutes walk to the heart of the Gothic and Borne districts.  The big market is a few blocks away which was nice for a quick snack, fruit stop, etc.  Be careful, a woman had her pursue stolen IN the hotel at the restaurant during the breakfast buffet.  In general be careful when traveling but same goes even when you are inside the hotel.  Management took it seriously, they seemed to be getting camera footage, etc.",4,2016,07,20
37,"Perfect location, good service, modern room decorations","Perfect location, big improvement in housekeeping since my last visit, the management addressed to issues very quickly. Looking forward to stay there again after renovations. Better request for a room with views in advance :-)",4,2016,07,19
37,Gorgeous hotel in my favourite location with great service,"I had admired this hotel on previous trips and was lucky enough to be taken here last weekend. 
The location is perfect. Right in the heart of the Ramblas with very secure car parking which is fairly crucial for Barcelona.
The staff were all incredibly helpful and we had a wonderful room with stunning views of the Ramblas.
Fantastic choices on the breakfast buffet which I did not do justice to as I am not really a breakfast person but everything I did try was of very good quality and well cooked.
many thanks",5,2016,07,19
37,Fantastic Location and Up to Standard,"In general, I really like Le Meridien hotels, and this example in Barcelona only reinforced my affinity for the brand.

The best thing about this hotel is its location for touring Barcelona. It's right on the main commercial strip, Las Ramblas, which puts you within walking distance of just about everything.

The rooms were average sized, but the bathrooms were great. I personally liked the dark colors and glass combination so much I took pictures in case I wanted to redo my home bathroom in the same style.

The breakfast buffet is good but the selection isn't huge, but the hotel isn't that big to begin with. 

I would happily stay here again.",4,2016,07,18
37,Perfect location for very good hotel in Barcelona ,"The Meridien is a lovely property located just off Las Ramblas in Barcelona. Our family stayed here for 4 days prior to a cruise. We had the 360 Barcelona Suite, a family suite, and 3 regular rooms.
The rooms were well appointed with plenty of outlets for charging phones, iPads, etc. The big red chair in the rooms was extremely comfortable! The linens were a bit worn (towels especially), but nothing too bad. The biggest issue we had was with the door locks. Apparently the hotel is in the process of changing the room locks, and there were definite issues with the door of one of our rooms. We could not access the room for 8 hours one day and 2 hours another day. This made us late for a dinner reservation one night. While this was extremely frustrating, it is not enough to keep us from being satisfied with the accommodations. 
The 360 suite was fabulous! The views from the round sitting area were phenomenal and the circle sectional sofa seated plenty in comfort. We also appreciated the daily treats in the 360 suite. 
The daily breakfast buffet was delicious with plenty of choices for everyone. We especially loved the omelette station and the Churros! 
The concierge desk personnel made excellent restaurant recommendations and were helpful with sightseeing suggestions.
",4,2016,07,16
37,In the thick of it,"This was a nice hotel. The staff was courteous and very helpful.We decided last minute to go to a restaurant that we found to be booked up, but the concierge was able to get us in. The rooms were in  the process of being remodeled, but we had one that had not been redone yet despite that, our room was still nice and roomy also they offer free internet.
The hotel is located overlooking Las Ramblas, so the area can get quite busy. That being said, the hotel's entrance is located on a cross street, so it is not overrun by tourist foot traffic. I must warn, even though the hotel is quiet inside, and the entrance is off the main street, if you are looking for a quiet location, I would not recommend staying here. I recommend a stay here especially for those who want to be close to many of the tourist sites.",4,2016,07,14
37,Great location for exploring on foot.,"This was a nice hotel in the middle of the main sites in central Barcelona.  The staff were very helpful and spoke very good English.  I was there over a weekend before a business meeting, so did not get to see all the sites Barcelona has to offer, but I will definitely stay here again.  Ask for a room facing the main street and you can people watch  from your window.",5,2016,07,13
37,Perfect for first night in Europe,"This fine hotel is well-located with great rooms, a nice restaurant, and a very courteous staff.  They made aspect all effort to have a room ready for us earlier than usual due to our age after a trans-Atlantic flight.  Although on the street side, our room was quiet.  The amenities were top notch and we felt well served.  We would return!",5,2016,07,11
37,Nice ,"This is a really fine hotel. Interior design is of high quality, nice stereo to play your iPhone music and if you can get one of the apartments with a shower on the terrace, well, you've hit bull's eye, sir :-)
Plus, needless to say, it is perfectly located and the ground floor restaurant is a really good one (plus it offers lunch specials and such)",5,2016,07,05
37,Great Location,"Le Meridien is in the perfect Location of la Rambla. The area is full of activity day and night. You have the choice of eating in the hotel which has a great menu or the many restaurants in the area. 
The location of the hotel meant that our small wish list of attraction were quick and easy to get to. My 15 year old son wanted to do the tour of Camp Nou, Home to FC Barcelona. My 18 year old daughter wanted to visit Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia.
The rooms at Le Meridien were spacious, bright with a contemporary feel. 
The staff were very welcoming and friendly.
We only ate breakfast whilst staying at Le Meridien. It was very good a large choice of hot and cold food.
This hotel also welcomes dogs and has a car park both were vital to us as we were tying Barcelona in with our summer holiday in Southern Spain. 
Barcelona and the hotel Meridien were the perfect end to a great summer.",5,2016,07,05
37,Great location and now with 24/7 mobile city WiFi,"Consistent quality across the board and one of those few with ""old times luxury"". Comfortable, clean, helpful staff and awesome location. Also, I found specially useful their Freeclick service, basically a mobile WiFi service. Just ask for it at reception and you can roam around the city with permanent high speed Internet connection. Wrote this from having a coffee at ""El Lobo"" bar close the the hotel, don't miss that one either.",4,2016,07,05
37,Great service,"Stayed one night for a dinner meeting. Hotel all all the expected facilities, neat tidy and generally impressive. What made the difference for me was the excellent service provided by the reception staff, friendly and efficient, nothing too much trouble. 

Excellent work",5,2016,07,05
37,Early high season stay,"We arrived at the Le Meridien directly from the States for a 4-nights stay.  This was a family trip with our 3-yr old Lil Bun.

The Great:  the location of course.  We weren't so much interested in the La Rambla scene since we've been in Barcelona a few times previously.  The excellence of the location had to do with being able to walk to quality restaurants in the area.  (We suggest Caravelle and Cafe Silenus which were both very casual & friendly and welcoming to our Lil Bun.  Granja Viader is a good place for a quick snack.)  Additionally, the metro stop was about an easy 5-minute walk away.

The Good:  the hotel was kind enough to honor my SPG suite upgrade reward and moved us into a junior suite that had a balcony overlooking La Rambla.  I think we were on the 8th floor so outside noise was not an issue at all.  The junior suite was about 400 sq ft excluding the balcony.  There was a large couch and desk with chair.  There was a 36"" flat screen TV (not sure about exact size but definitely less than 40"" because I have a 40"" at home) hung on a swivel on the wall.  The king size bed was very comfortable.  All 3 of us slept together there and I did not feel the need to request a separate small child's rollaway bed for Lil Bun.  The bed linens were soft and the light comforter was a good weight for the warm summer weather.  (Note that I set the air conditioning fairly cool because we like to sleep in temps around 20C/68F.)  The A/C was very effective and kept our room cool all day which was especially pleasant after walking under the beautiful sun around the city.  The bathroom in the room was long but narrow.  There was a single sink and just a bathtub with shower.  The bathroom floor had radiant heating.  The balcony was about 75 sq ft and had plenty of seating.  We did not get to use it too much except to air out our footwear.  We used the free WiFi (for SPG member) and the bandwidth was good.  We had the buffet breakfast one morning and the selection was very credible with plenty of warm savory foods to go with the typical breads and dairies.  We also had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night and it was fine.  Service from people throughout the hotel was consistently good.

The Not-so-good:  We arrived from the airport at around 13:00 local time and of course there were other fine folks looking to check in also.  It took almost 8-10 minutes to get started with check-in.  There wasn't anyone initially working at the SPG desk.  The hotel upgraded us but asked us to come back at 16:00 to get our room so we had to wait 3 hours.  And of course we were exhausted from the airport.  With 5 star properties, they will provide you a temporary room to freshen up but this Le Meridien is a step below so we just used the loo in the lobby area and then headed outside to eat a long lunch.  There are steps to get into the main hotel entrance and no ramp so that was not very convenient for using the child stroller.  (The hotel porters are very kind and will help you which we were grateful for.)  The breakfast is fairly good but it ended at 10:30 so with our Lil Bun fighting the jet lag we couldn't really make it the first couple of mornings.  There are other Starwood properties in Spain where breakfast runs to 11:00 and that half hour makes a huge difference.  (We are not that type of family that sneaks in at the last 5-10 minutes of breakfast service.)  For a junior suite, the bathroom in our room was disappointing.  It was narrow and there was only a single sink.  The bathtub has a partial glass enclosure but it is not long enough so when we took showers here was always water on the floor.  The body towels were old and had seen better days.  Also, the clothes hanging area is part of the bathroom which we personally do not like because we prefer our clothes away from the humidity typical inside bathrooms.

All in all I would recommend this hotel for SPG status members because the service is very good (outside of long check-in wait at the prime time) and of course the advantages of SPG Platinum recognition are hard to beat.",4,2016,07,04
37,Great location,"The hotel has a great location, just off Le Rambla which has vibrant day, evening and nightlife. We chose one of the mediterranean suite's which was very nice, well positioned and with its own terrace. The staff were very helpful, particularly the guys on the Concierge desk, assisting with restaurants and tours.

Unfortunately there is a but, if you are a vegetarian or vegan then you are not very well catered for regarding the menu selection, that said we had a very good stay !",4,2016,07,01
37,Great location,"Located at the start of popular Las Ramblas, you'll be in good position to walk to many places including the Las Boqueira food market (3 mins walk), the harbour front (15 mins walk), Catalunya Square and all the shopping spots (5 mins walk). It is also near a metro station and there are loads of restaurants nearby as well. (I would avoid eating at the tourist trap restaurants along Las Ramblas and recommend venturing into the side streets for better options). There's a handy Carrefour supermarket just around the corner as well. 

The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful and the room is excellent and spacious. We had a very comfortable king size bed, a gorgeous bathroom with rainfall shower and lots of storage space. Not sure of other rooms but I imagine it may get quite noisy if your room is facing Las Ramblas, so I'd check if noise bothers you. We had one facing the side street and it was nice and quiet.",5,2016,06,29
37,Le Meridian Hotel,"Wonderful location right off La Rambla.  Excellent service , very attentive front desk and concierge. security is very good.  Good restaurant attached to the hotel on La Rambla. Within walking distance of la Plaza Catylun and La Boqueria(fabulous outdoor market).",5,2016,06,29
37,Great possition ,"At the top of Las ramblas this hotel is in a great Central position,  the hotel itself is excellent. Freindly efficient staff and very comfortable rooms, very good drinks and cocktails in the bar,  and a high standard  breakfast for hotels,  will stay again ",5,2016,06,29

Rooms very accomodating, bath amenities top notch, rooms we had very quiet, 5 blocks to harbor 1 block to placa Catalunya, great dept store el corte ingles on right side of placa catalunya also near hop on hop off buses at Catalunya as well, subway stop 2 blocks away can walk to most sites within 20 min",5,2016,06,27
37,nice hotel great location,Nice hotel in a great location.  Could do with a refurbishment but still acceptable as a quality hotel.  If you want to be on the Ramblas then this is a great choice.  We didn't eat at the hotel because there are so many choices near by.,5,2016,06,24
37,Great Location and Pampered,"If you'll looking for Location, Location, Location, Le Meridan in Barcelona is for you, 111 La Rambla, right in the middle of all the daily and evening action. The staff are plentiful and attentive. Stayed with friends from an Amawaterways French River cruise, so our stay included Breakfast, seriously, after breakfast there's no need for Lunch, personally made omelettes, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, anything and everything. And then the perfect location for a nightcap and desert in the evening. The staff assisted in every way possible, opening the front door, every time you arrived or left. Rooms were very nice and although we faced the rear, with all the evening noise, I pretty sure that was s good location. Very clean and helpful. If you can afford it this is definitely the place to stay. ",5,2016,06,22
37,Great hotel and awesome location,"Awesome location right off La Ramblas. Received a great Platinum SPG upgrade to a suite with a view facing the water. Breakfast was good. Bar and restaurant were relatively quiet. Also Some great food options nearby - concierge was able to provide plenty of good recommendations. Often only one concierge on duty though, which did result in some queues and grumbling among guests having to wait. Gym was nice and quiet and the gym equipment appeared to be almost brand new. Also a grocery store right around the corner.

Of note the spa has an outdoor whirpool and sun deck for sun bathing that are open to guests and can be used during spa operating hours on a first come first serve basis",5,2016,06,22
37,Great location off La Ramblas,"The Le Meridien is a nice property with a convenient, central location.  It is close to La Boqueria, all types of shopping, the Gothic neighborhood, the Columbus statue at water’s edge, and several Gaudi structures.  The rooms are modern and comfortable.  They have great breakfasts with cooked-to-order omelets.  The staff is excellent in all respects – very helpful and knowledgeable.",4,2016,06,21
37,Wonderful place to stay in Barcelona,"I stayed at the Le Meridien hotel for 10 days in January while I was in Barcelona for work. The hotel is in an unbelievable location on Ramblas.  Within minutes of walking you can be shopping, at the waters edge, parks, eating at amazing restaurants or seeing some of the architectural sites in the Goetic neighborhood.  The rooms were very comfortable, modern and a decent size for Europe.  The breakfast in the morning was very good and the fresh juices were amazing.  Most of all the staff was very warm and welcoming and took great care of us while we were there",4,2016,06,20
37,Wonderful place to stay in Barcelona,"Location was quite convenient and easily accessible by metro at Catalunya (3 min walk). 10 m from La Ramblas with central walkway, markets, fun fare, plenty of restaurants; we stuck to traditional ones n ate inside. 

Rooms were well furnished with all amenities in room and bathroom.

Wifi free and available 24/7 in the room as well. Login so easy.

Telephones were provided in room and bathroom and one gets service immediately.

Porters were available to take luggage to and from rooms.

Lift service one should get used to. Floors 1-5 has lifts. Rooms 6-7 has a separate lift not stopping in floors 1-5. If one travels with a party with some, say, in floor 3 and others in floor 7 then the need to understand the system become essential.

Reception staff are overtly friendly and most helpful. Concierge helps with travel and visit planning if required. Currency could be changed but at lower rates e.g. 1£ = 0.965 on that day. In currency shops varies from 1.02to 1.10 Euro. A short walk would help a lot in finding the higher rate.

Food -had taken breakfast only. Most rooms the guests have to pay 25Euros per person for breakfast. Expensive but no easier option. Choice of items really great and with a hearty breakfast one can skip lunch!

Restaurants nearby and everywhere in Barcelona have good choice of food unlike Madrid. Evening starts from 9 pm! La Rambla area alive even at 3 am.",5,2016,06,18
37,Wonderful Barcelona Hotel!!,"My husband and I spent the night at this hotel before embarking on a Mediterranean cruise. We arrived very early, but the hotel took our luggage while we explored the neighborhood. They said they would call when the room was ready. Le Meriden is within walking distance of many shops, attractions, and quaint little outdoor eateries.  We wandered upon a wonderful marketplace that sold fresh fruit, vegetables and other delights just a few blocks away. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They were kind enough to call us as soon as our room was ready and let us to check in several hours early which we greatly appreciated.  I highly would recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona!",5,2016,06,14
37,Excellent,"Amazing staff, amazing property. 10/10. Bellman very helpful. Management staff and SPG gold and above line staff is very helpful. Located in center city it is the 1st stop of the city tour. Tons of restaurants are near by and its right in the middle of the action.",5,2016,06,11
37,Great atmosphere,"This hotel is in a perfect location to the Ramblas. Great atmosphere all around. We walked around to the different shops and restaurants even walked down to the water to take a boat tour on evening, perfect! The hotel is clean, nice place to stay. The only negative is the bed is extremely hard and not comfortable to sleep. Otherwise great location right in the heart of everything!",4,2016,06,09
37,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed at le meridien for 3 nights with the children and friends.
Lovely hotel and attentive staff. Only thing to complain about was only 1 room was ready on our arrival as they had allowed a late checkout for the previous guests! We had to wait 30 minutes in our friends room, then when told our room was ready we waited outside the door for 15 minutes before anyone arrived to let us in!!
Breakfast choice was excellent and we ate in the restaurant on our last night - food was very good. 
I visited the spa for a massage which was very good, the therapist was very pleasant and the treatment she gave was perfect.
Apart from slight problem with the room on arrival our stay was great and I would recommend this hotel ",4,2016,06,06
37,Perfect Location Next to the Ramblas,"We were traveling for our 20th wedding anniversary. The staff at the W was able to upgrade us to a beautiful room with a very large terrace. The terrace had a outdoor shower, lounge chairs & a table to 6. The room itself was very spacious & had a huge bathroom. Absolutely stunning room! The staff was extremely helpful & kind. The hotel is situated right on Las Ramblas & is a perfect location for walking to almost everything.",5,2016,06,06
37,Horribly overpriced!  Just say NO to CROWDED Spain!,There is a reason this country has 50% youth unemployment and no standing government...........there is no one to run things in an efficient manner!  Walk out of this hotel into a meat packed avenue that is a daily grind to go anywhere..........and there is no luxury in this hotel as it reminds you of a Holiday Inn.............Just say no to overcrowded Barcelona and say no to Spain!  Oh and did I mention one of their fine citizens stole my wallet and the police and local counsel were totally incompetent in getting it returned!  SPAIN?  NEVER!,1,2016,06,04
37,Center of the Action,"If you want to be right in the center of things, the Meridien is a good choice.  It is an old building but fully modernized and located on La Rambla.  Of course, this is a ""touristy"" area and only a couple of blocks from the Boqueria market but we enjoyed the activity.  The only downside was that the room, although well-appointed, was extremely small and there are basically no views, unless you upgrade to a suite, which faces La Rambla.  We found the two concierges, Gil and Ricardo, to be very friendly and helpful in assisting us with directions and restaurant and tapas choices.  The hotel does not have a particularly Spanish character but it is comfortable and well-positioned for anything you want to do in Barcelona.",4,2016,06,03
37,Great location and very nice hotel,I have stayed in a few different hotels in Barcelona but my favorite is Le Meridian.   It is right on Las Ramblas very close to the gothic quarter with more good shops and cafes within a couple of blocks than you could go to in a week.  They usually get us in our room hours before checkin time.  The hotel restaurant is also excellent.  Not the cheapest hotel in Barcelona but a good value.,5,2016,06,02
37,"Looking to stay in the heart of it all, this is your place","As with every Le Meridien hotel you're immediately greeted with the signature fragrance of Le Meridien No 1. After that you'll take in the art factor - cool, modern yet sophisticated art adorns the lobby and halls. Then, you'll realize that all of the staff truly love their jobs - and you'll notice it because they are happy. Yes, happy customer service agents. Bliss. The rooms are spacious by all European standards and the bathrooms are huge! I enjoyed the large shower though if you're under 5 feet, bring a step stool to climb into the tub. The coffee bar serves Illy (as they do globally) and the room service food is impeccable. Also spend some time in the 111, the lobby bar and restaurant, to enjoy some cava or tapas as you watch the tourists pass by.",5,2016,06,02
37,Beautiful hotel and outstanding staff,"Traveled to Barcelona to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our hotel room was beautiful, very large and quiet. The hotel staff was extraordinarily welcoming, recognizing our special occasion in a number of ways. Ana, especially, is an excellent ambassador for Le Meridian and for Barcelona!

The entire hotel staff was gracious and helpful. And the property is elegant and well-maintained.",5,2016,05,25
37,Good hotel--GREAT location!,"The service and location is superb.  You almost cannot get lost in this magnificent city when your hotel is in the center of the universe.  The quality of the hotel itself is, well, underwhelming.  The rooms are smallish.  The air conditioning iffy and if you can figure out the light switches, good luck!  They had us guessing all week. (Hint:  two switches are master controls which override each other.) For eating, I suggest you walk outside to one of the thousand cafes serving fantastic tapas (a bunch of cafes are literally across the street.) The concierge can't help with purchasing tickets for attractions, directions, and one didn't even know there was a small terrace on the 6th floor.  But overall the people were helpful and courteous.  Not five stars.  But if you're in this city, you won't be staying in your room very long, so who cares!",4,2016,05,24
37,An Oasis in the heart of Barcelona,"Let me start this by saying, I work in a 5 star hotel and can be pretty biased. I also usually love edgy, trendy, boutique hotels, BUT when you have some hotel points, you expand your horizons! The Le Meridien, is set right in the thick of Las Ramblas, the Times Square, of Barcelona. The interior is modern, mixed with deco. A beautiful small coffee, lounge, and bar area awaits you to your left and a wonderful pleasant staff, greets you to your right. Everyone in this hotel is super friendly. Ricardo at the concierge desk, as well as Gil were my go to guys. These men were beyond pleasant and helpful to my Mom and I during our navigating trip. Another plus to the hotel besides the fact that even if you get lost, you magically remain back on Las Ramblas(near the hotel)is the rooms are amazing. Comfortable and modern bathrooms with TV's in the mirror, as well as plenty of space, and super quiet floors. Another great thing is the restaurant in the hotel, was fantastic! If you get a chance, book a massage, enjoy the outside spa area and enjoy beautiful Barcelona at Le Meridien.",4,2016,05,21
37,"Central location, fantastic service","Post cruise and stayed at Meridien for 3 nights. This hotel is in the middle of la rambla! Walking distance to la bouqueria market , to pl Catalunya , to the cathedral. Location, location! Easy access to the underground , local transpiration , bus, taxi, hop on hop off buses. 
Since the hotel is close to la rambla it tends to be noisy during the day. It gets quieter during the night but you could hear some noises. We had no problem sleeping during the night.  Our room was on the second floor in the front. Room was spacious, but the bath tub was to high to step into. My wife have knee problem and had a difficult time getting in and out of the bath tub. Other than that - the stay was enjoyable. But the service  was outstanding ! I have problem with my cc while trying to purchase attraction tickets in line . Bruno, one of the concierge must spent an hour on the phone with me calling the States to solve my issue and all that time with a smile. Bruno is wonderful! I cannot say enough about how good and helpful he is. Also the entire front desk, door man are very polite and always helpful. We were happy to stay with Meridien. 
In addition there are apples and English newspaper by the elevator. How could this be bad?
Enjoy Meridien and Barcelona!",5,2016,05,21
37,Winter City Break,"I booked this hotel as a surprise gift for my partners 31st birthday. We went with another couple & after much research we picked this hotel due to its location.

We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel which didn't cost a lot between 4 of us & didnt take to long.

The hotel is just off the Main Street in las ramblas, down a little side road opposite hotel 1820. It was a beautiful reception area (it even had board games to play with it you are waiting around).

The hotel rooms were lovely & spacious for a city centre hotel. The bed was comfy & bathroom really modern. There are balcony doors to get some fresh air into the room.

The hotel is in walking distance (we walked everywhere) & in the heart of las ramblas. There's loads of lovely restaurants around.

We did all the tourists things there are to do, the bus tour was a relief after 2 days of non stop walking. We went to a restaurant at the top of the hill near the castle, the service wasn't amazing but food was nice & the views were amazing.

I loved our trip to Barcelona & would highly recommend this hotel. Opposite is a lovely restaurant for breakfast really yummy food!",5,2016,05,21
37,Ok hotel amidst the circus of La Ramblas,"If you want commotion outside at all times, then this is the place for you. Located steps from La Ramblas, you're centrally located in the city of Barcelona and walkable to many tourist sites and close to public transportation, but expect noise and watch the pickpockets! The hotel itself needs updating badly. But it's a decent stay at a good price. But I wouldn't call it luxury.",3,2016,05,20
37,Loved Barcelona even more this time!,First of all this hotel is beautiful! Lovely decor and the bathroom is roomy and gorgeous and everything up to date. Service was top of the line. Special touch --they sent me a bottle of champagne for my birthday and I really thought that was amazing! Location is everything and this location is perfect right off las ramblas but we could t hear noise of streets. We all loved it even my two year loved the hotel as they gave him Legos upon arrival small touch but big deal for a two year old! Thank you for a great stay till next time!,5,2016,05,19
37,Quality hotel in a highly popular location,"Originally booked for  night, our passports were . stolen adjacent to Las Ramblas (a familiar story) and we re-booked for another 3 nights until our travel arrangements could be sorted out. The hotel staff are multi-lingual , helpful and in our case they were sympathetic. The rooms are good and the hotel ticks all the boxes one would look for in a 4 star hotel. There is a coffee  bar in the reception area which is a good place to sit and read your newspaper.
Opposite the hotel is a restaurant which features a variety of menus,  not just Spanish, quality very good, service excellent. The hotel is a civilised base from which to explore the side streets off the Ramblas, My advice is to keep to the side streets on the Southern side of Las Ramblas, the danger areas are on the Northern side, especially Calle de l'hopital. Do not carry anything of value with you when you roam Barcelona's streets, the thieves are ultra professional and you will only discover your loss when you look for your purse, wallet, etc. The mayor of Barcelona wants to cut down on the number of tourists (I don't imagine the retailers or hoteliers are thrilled with this project but the mayor obviously has an understanding with the thieves who are executing his policy for him.
I will return to Barcelona, a city I find enchanting, but from now on I think I'll keep a poisonous snake in my bag.

37,great location,This hotel is in a great location to see Barcelona. The meals we had here were very good as was the service. we took a paella cooking class as part of our stay and would highly recommend this. Quite a few museums were in walking distance as is a great outdoor market. we did take the subway once or twice and it's within easy walking distance.,5,2016,05,18
37,Luxury on the Ramblas,"I was hesitant to stay any where near The Ramblas given it's touristy feel and the repeated warnings about pick pockets in the area.  My friend and I were treated to a suite at Le Meridien in early May.  The room was very comfortable.  The bathroom was ginormous with an impressive shower. How nice to have a oversized shower head with as much hot water as you can tolerate shortly after an over seas flight!  

The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful.  We had room service breakfast which was prompt and quite sufficient.  If you need to stay near The Ramblas area, Le Meridien is a tasteful gateway to the Bari Gottic and El Born.",5,2016,05,18
37,Ratna Rao,"Good hotel that's centrally located. So we spent a lot of time walking around.
Several good restaurants around so there's no need of eating in the hotels expensive restaurant
Lovely weather around this time of the year in Barcelona",4,2016,05,18
37,"well worth it, and service exemplary","We were there 3 times during April, Miguel at front desk, Ana, Starwood specialist, and  Maria at concierge desk. Breakfasts are bit expensive in hotel, there is alternative at coffee bar in lobby, but service at front desk amazing, location is very convenient, rooms are very comfortable, restaurants are everywhere, close to Placa Catalunya, taxis always outside the hotel, front desk staffed 24/7 very clean,   a flagship   of other starwood properties and they are continuously anxious to please. Highly recommend the hotel",5,2016,05,18
37,"Helpful, pleasant, and caring staff","Our room was large and comfortable.  The bathroom had attractive, modern fixtures--and even a small TV.  When my daughter came down with a bronchial infection, the desk clerk called a good, local doctor for us.  The clerk also inter-faced with the hospital several times to get information for me, as my Spanish is limited.  The hotel restaurant was convenient and had good quality food and service.",5,2016,05,17
37,Great location on Las Ramblas,"1/2 way between the sea and plaza Catalunya. Beautiful rooms, quirky lobby, wonderful breakfast and so convenient to everything. Take a stroll late at nite on las Ramblas and get a rose shaped gelato at Amorino, right around the corner. Rooms are spacious and well appointed, good havc, and an amazing bath suite! Large enough for a cocktail party with a tv too!",5,2016,05,17
37,Great Location ,"Situated right in the middle of las Ramblas, so much to see and in town. The hotel is well appointed with friendly staff and a good bar, I didn't try the restaurant apart from breakfast but am told the food there is good. I would recommend this hotel for a weekend away. ",4,2016,05,17
37,Nice,The hotel is in the rambla street. The staff so pro and so welcoming and helpful. There is a spa and good facilities. The bathrooms when you shower gives you the feeling that you are in a cave. It's close to everything. I just like my stay there..,5,2016,05,17
37,"Nice location, ok hotel",Great location seconds away from Las Ramblas. Food in hotel was good but not outstanding. Guests ranged in ages so we were subject to one night of noisy children and another night of loud teens. Thin walls for such an aged hotel. Staff is friendly and accommodating.,3,2016,05,16
37,"Great location, nice staff","Great location,  staff all speak English, the restaurant has a great selection for breakfast.
Doorman helpful calling taxis. Nice usual le meridien toiletries. 
Would love to have Nesspresso machine in rooms.
Beds comfortable. Would return. Stayed May 2016.",5,2016,05,16
37,"OK, but not a five-star experience","The hotel is well placed on the Rambla, but it is becoming tired. Not only the rooms that need some serious looking after, but also the service. It is basically friendly, but the overall atmosphere is tired and a bit sad.
A Meridien hotel should be able to do better with some better management",4,2016,05,16
37,"Great Location, Comfortable, Good Staff","Just completed four nights at Le Meridien. This time of year a little pricey but the location is outstanding. We walked everywhere from here, often clocking nine miles in a day.  Many great eateries including right across the street - Luzia - for lunch. During the week for lunch, they serve menu el dia - appetizer, meal, drink and desert all for 14 euro - exceptional deal.
   Best thing about this hotel is the concierge, Gil Valdez, he has the patience of a Saint. We asked him many questions and he always was cheerful with very helpful answers. He really helped make our trip great!
    Our room was serviceable and clean. Front desk great. Gym fine. 
Enjoy Barcelona!",5,2016,05,14
37,Lovely Hotel near Las Ramblas,"We enjoyed our stay here.  The hotel is first class and the staff is most helpful.  Very good breakfast.  They give a free ticket to see Palau Guell, a house designed by Antoni Gaudi, this worth taking the time to see.  Since it is so close to Las Ramblas it is easy to run out for a yummy gelato.",5,2016,05,13
37,"Nice place to have something to drink , the staff was very friendly.","Nice place to have something to drink the staff was very friendly and kind. Nice music as well. The coctails were perfect well located it Is near the Rambles, If I come back to Barcelona I will come back for sure, I would recommend it to everybody😀",5,2016,05,12
37,Great location,"This hotel has a great location. The rooms are smaller, but OK by European standards. We arrived early off of a cruise and had asked for an early check-in, but weren't able to get one, even though we are lifetime SPG gold. We did get an upgrade to a room overlooking La Rambla. These can be a little noisy at night. 

We were celebrating a special event and did receive acknowledgement of that with a bottle of bubbly and chocolate dipped strawberries delivered to our room. Nice!

The location is great, being close to the metro, on La Rambla, near other tourist sights, and the cruise terminal. There is a grocery store next door and the amazing produce market is a 5 min walk away. 

We did not eat in the restaurant as it was pretty pricy for all we wanted for breakfast. The service was good and the concierge helpful. Would certainly consider this property again.",4,2016,05,12
37,5 Stars ... Really??,"Superb location and all the amenities you would expect, but hard to see how they rate 5 stars.  We stayed there because we are SPG Gold and were not disappointed, but it didn't really seem that special either.  Front desk staff very friendly and helpful.  Very pricey restaurant, but not atypical for large cities.",4,2016,05,10
37,"Great location, fabulous breakfast","Best choice for being on the La Rambla, location perfect, staff super helpful & friendly & a wonderful buffet breakfast with numerous choices.  We also ate dinner here & found the same 1st class service & food.",5,2016,05,10
37,"Nonchalent, typical of well situated properties","We stayed at Le Meridien, Barcelona owing to the fact that we are SPG Platinum members. Check-in is expedited but the bellman's ""you can carry these to your room, right?"" catches my attention. We had just traveled 15,000km to Barcelona with two carry-ons, 1 large suitcases and two personal bags. Luckily, it is 9AM and we have a room thanks to the 24-hour check-in. 

This property does not have an Executive lounge which we typically enjoy upon traveling through that many timezones. 

The room is clean and comfortable. We have tried the downstairs breakfast at the CentOnze several times. The service is attentive, there is a good selection of food. 

The wireless connection works. 

You are located on the iconic Ramblas, where you have a lot within walking distance. It is easy to commute via the underground subway. 

Overall, an ""OK"" experience for this type of property. I would have expected more, starting with being greeted when entering the property. Same goes for when leaving the hotel by taxi (in front of the property). we were not asked were we were headed.

This is typical of well-situated properties where service gets sloppy. I would prefer a boutique hotel experience next time in Barcelona.",3,2016,05,08
37,"Great room, service, and location","This beautiful hotel is in a great location, especially for a solo traveler. All of the staff were friendly, helpful, and efficient. I was pleasantly surprised that I had been upgraded to a suite on the sixth floor - and what a fantastic room it was! I was so impressed, that I splurged and had breakfast in my room the next morning. The only down side is that my stay was too short - so I'll have to book here again when I'm next in Barcelona!",5,2016,05,08
37,Perfect location,"Very nice Le Meredian in the center of the city.
Great service, clean room, nice bathroom, friendly staff
Really can't add anything more to what other reviews say.
We loved the location, perfect for our two nights stay
Close to the Old City that is a must see while in Barcelona",4,2016,05,06
37,Very good,"Was very happy with my weekend at this hotel. Nice staff, clean rooms and very good food. . It was quiet every night. Just lovely. It was easy to find shopping, taxi and the metro was just a short walk away. Will return some day!",5,2016,05,05
37,About average..,"I won't deny that the bathroom was spacious and very modern, but the room was simple. For a Meridien i expected a bit more luxury and more staff in the front desk. It took me almost an hour just to check out. The restaurant centonze however was pretty good! ",3,2016,05,03
37,Very good location,"The hotel itself situates in a very vibrant location on La Rambla St. and easy access to everywhere. It is not the cheapest but if you would like to walk to places, Le Meridien is the place to be. 

The breakfast is ok and have got the variety ranging from Ibirico of several kinds , chorizo, and the usual hotel breakfast items. Orange juice is outstanding but I guess it's the case in all around Spain. The negative side is that all the items are the same everyday. I was there for 4 days and it's really up to my neck on the very last day. Tapas is very easy to find around La Rambla and the market is next door so, if you have to pay extra, I would go out and eat. 

In rooms, we stayed in a few types, the amenity is ok and they've got all that is necessary. The water pressure is not too strong but it's strong enough. The bed in our room ,123, is comfortable but the legs of the bed stuck out beyond the frames themselves. They are very dangerous. My wife and I kicked them everyday as you tend to walk around the room and around the bed from time to time. 

The staff is very well attentive and they are friendly. I would recommend this hotel to others if they have the budget. Overall, I would say it's a good hotel in a great location !! 

Photos are from room : 123, 611, and 718

",4,2016,05,03
37,ok hotel witt overpriced breakfast,"Typical Le Meridien in a good Barcelona location. Nothing very memorable and/or off-putting. Breakfast was way too expensive, they are half a block from a plaza with 5-6 good restaurants, thought most are closed  for breakfast of course, this being Spain.",4,2016,05,02
37,Apt place in Barcelona,"Location wise, this is very apt- facilitating shopping and travel as well as dining! This hotel exudes a sense of supremacy as you enter- a feeling of a booking well done. The check-in /out procedures are well handled; the concierge guide you well on travel/ dining. Yes, the bell desk also do a neat job of handling your luggage and doing the taxi bookings. The staff are surprisingly very friendly [ apart from being very elegant]. The rooms fairly well done, the toiletries real classy. We couldn't try out their restaurant and spa, but the restaurant did appear well patronised. They charge you 25 euros for the breakfast - which is one negative thing. We believe all rooms should come with a complementary breakfast. You get a free coffee coupon but the coffee shop closes at 1600 hrs !  Barring these two negativities, the hotel is excellent. Right on the magical La Rambla street, you have everything from souveneir shopping to branded stores, different dining options, tourist hop buses just outside the hotel. The room prices are high but worth it. Will come back again.",4,2016,05,01
37,Well run operation,"Clean,comfortable,attractive,centrally located. Professional staff. First class operation.
Concierges were well versed in best options for ""first time"" vacationers to Barcelona.
Walking distance to so many great sites.",4,2016,04,30
37,Best location. ,Located at the Ramblas the hotel is in the center of the action of Barcelona. Amazing bar and restaurant. The staff is super professional and very helpful. The only missing part is the swimming pool.  I loved the proximity of everything you need to see in Barcelona.  Down side the room are small.,5,2016,04,29
37,Great stay,"This hotel property is right on La Rambla, which really isn't my scene. BUT it is set back a bit and isn't noisy at all (we were on the 8th floor, facing a side street). Its about 2 blocks(max) from a subway stop, 3 blocks to the Playa Catalonia and right next door to a grocery store(great empanada and fresh juice). If you walk out the front door and turn right and then  take the first right and keep walking, you'll find some nice bakeries and one of the best places for Tapas, crowded and local (called Centric)",4,2016,04,29
37,Lunch,"Centric hotel but to much clasical decoration, the restaurant is well decorated , the food is not high quality, standard will be the right word.
I cannot tell anything about rooms but we visit the upper terrace where there is a tiny tiny jacuzzi not even a pool!!! And the views from the Gotic area is also poor",3,2016,04,25
37,Great location and wonderful assistance at the Concierge Desk,The hotel met our needs; we stayed in an upgraded suite that was very modern and clean. The television set is huge and the bathroom was very nice. The addition of a flat hair iron is a nice touch. The Concierge staff in particular was very helpful and accommodating and could not do enough for us. The restaurant was very nice and the breakfast buffet was excellent (and includes omelettes made to order.) The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to almost everything.The free internet service was reliableI will definitely return to this hotel next time I am in Barcelona.,5,2016,04,24
37,Weekend in Barcelona,"My wife and I found the hotel to be exactly what we needed close to Las Ramblas and all the shopping that offers. We enjoyed being able to walk any where we needed to go.The rooms were quite comfortable, our suitew had an incredible view of Sagrada Familia. 
The only downside is the A/C, and equipment on the roof was directly over the room so you could hear the equipment running throughout the entire stay. After discussion with the front desk they told us they have never heard the noise and there have never been any complaints. The suites are pricey and they should do something to help silence or deaden the sound it was hard to rest peacefully.",2,2016,04,21
37,Celebrating 50th in Barcelona,"Overall I have to be honest and say the Hotel was really good, very clean and well positioned on the Ramblas. The only issues I have was the private transfer from the airport to the hotel was not well organised. The driver had a sign but it did not have my name on it, in fact it did not have any name on it! I had to call the Hotel to ask to be collected.
We also asked for a late check out and although this was allowed as the hotel was not full the charge for this was a bit steep and left a bit of a sour taste! But don't let this put you off the Hotel is ideal for couple and families, the breakfast were really good, the Omelette guy is special!",4,2016,04,20
37,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location, the rooms are small but very clean and modern.
The staff was very friendly, i really liked the tv in the bathroom it was nice able to relax in the bathtub and watch tv after a long day of walking.",5,2016,04,19
37,Perfect Location For Barcelona,"Le M. Barcelona is right in the Busy area of the tourist area. Great for walking. 10 minute walk to the Harbor.Easy access to other areas in Barcelona. The Hotel was great from the room I got to the service all 5 star.
The Spa was one of my better SPA experiences I have had in Recent years.
The Restaurant down stairs was also a big plus for quality and service.",5,2016,04,18
37,Very Nice Last Minute Choice!,"Booked the room 2 days ahead of time (using points). Everything was great, and although there was an issue with the minibar (it contained a smoothie left by another guest and was also not fully stocked), this was mostly resolved right away. The smoothie was removed but no additional items were added. Other than that, everything was perfect. Quiet room, comfortable beds and great shower. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Perfect location.",4,2016,04,17
37,Not an SPG Category 6 Hotel,"To begin - I would not stay at this hotel again. It was not up to the level that a typical Starwood Hotel would be at. The evidence is not only mine, but also witnessed another guest with issues as well, so am not alone.
Room was booked on SPG.com with Starpoints and a Suite Upgrade. The room we were presented with, was absolutely filthy.... not only did we acknowledge this but so did the duty manager, who agreed that it was dirty. There was food on the floor, dirty throw pillows on the sofa, urine spots on the bathroom floor and more! The telephone system was not working either and only after complaining that incoming calls could not be transferred to me, did they look into it. I will thank the hotel management for allowing me to return the call at the hotel's expense.

The replacement room, did not have a king bed as requested - twin beds were the order of the day! Could not give me a room as requested and booked! 

Internet was good. Restaurant service and food good.
Concierge (Maria) Excellent
Location: On Las Ramblas - very central in Gothic Quarter

It appears the hotel has renovated some of the rooms, however we did not get a look at them.

This is the first time I have said that I would not go back to a hotel. BTW, when I completed the Starwood survey the response was not overly apologetic but more to say thanks for letting us know and we will try better next time. - Sorry folks you blew it!",2,2016,04,16
37,Feeling Valued,"From the moment we came through the revolving doors until we said goodbye, we felt that our stay was important. All the good things that you read in the other reviews are true. And it also is true that there's vibrant noise from the Rambla (bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper or reserve a room in the back). But what I want to talk about is the feeling that we had during our entire stay. 

Beginning with check-in with the extraordinary Gabriela -- an extraordinary reception desk staffer -- we felt that this hotel's entire staff was committed to making our stay as pleasant as possible. Her competence and care were equalled by the staff of the concierge desk: Gil in the morning and Bruno later in the day had the answers to our every question and suggestions that were perfect. 

The rooms are lovely (book 514), the windows open, breakfast is sumptuous, the green apples in the hallway are thoughtful, morning newspapers are available in multiple languages, the housekeeping staff is pleasant and competent, and the breakfast staff was thoughtful in many ways. 

Nothing we asked was too much; nothing we asked was too little. That's priceless. 

But no hotel is perfect and this is my suggestion for Le Meridien Barcelona: increase the size of the W.C. waste bin so that there is enough room for the trash that cannot be recycled. Not much of a complaint, is it?",5,2016,04,15
37,Much better 2nd time.,"Returned to this hotel in January. My second stay was much better than the first. The room was very nice, we had a great terrace overlooking the city and an outdoor shower (but I'm why and who would opt to take a shower out there)
The breakfast was good but a bit odd, you must ask for your bill. They will not just bring it to you and as in most places in Europe service is very slow compared to the US. Overall should I return to Barcelona I would stay again.",5,2016,04,15
37,Nice hotel in a great location,"Very clean and tidy, and considering its a nice hotel in a major city centre the prices for mini bar, food etc were very reasonable.

The room was great, plenty of space and the bed was huge and so comfy! Only slight negative was the air conditioning wasn't very powerful so the room stayed quite warm.

The wet area on the rooftop was a bit small and basic, room in the water for two people only. Spa was pricey so didn't use it.

Breakfast was really nice, loved the freshly cooked omelette! 

Would definitely come back",4,2016,04,10
37,Could not have chosen better,"From check in to check out, this hotel has been outstanding. At check in, our daughters (3 & 5) were each given a pack of lego and their own own key which was an instant hit. Our family room was very big with the girls having their own space with TV and their sofa bed (in their own words) - 'was the best  we have ever slept on'  and they have slept on many in many different hotels. They had a chocolate on their pillow every night. As for the adults, the rainshower was a class of its own and on one evening were offered complimentary sweet wine, nuts and huge plate of petit four. The concierge were very helpful and were a wealth of knowledge about the city and had an answer to every question we had. They booked all our evening show tickets. Breakfast was lovely with something for everyone (churros for breakfast... Wow!). The location of this hotel could not be any better, right in the middle of La Rambla, a few minutes to Placa Catalunya and 15 minutes leisurely walk to the seafront. The location, service and little touches for the guests and mini guests makes this hotel one above the rest for us. We will definitely be staying there again when we are in Barcelona next. ",5,2016,04,07
37,Outstanding luxury,"Distinct full service luxury
Excellent location on the Rambla. Walking Convenience to museums, restaurants and shopping along the high spot Rambla and nearby. Excellent professionals staff 24-hour concierge. Friendly and attentive service throughout. Fun cafe with people watching comfort on the Rambla. Good dining. An extraordinary and distinct luxury experience with extraordinary accessibility.",5,2016,04,06
37,Modern and Inviting Hotel,"Arrived early am from flight, but Juan graciously found a room for us (again, thank you!).  The quick nap and freshen-up gave us a great start to explore BCN.  Modern room, great shower, and the smell of fresh bread baking when we opened the window.  Maid service, bellhops, and concierge were very helpful and friendly.  The lady who ran the spa took us all with great humor when we made an impromptu wine party at dusk (gorgeous view) on the terrace outside the spa (one at the party had a massage earlier and raved!).  Obviously, it's close location to Las Ramblas and the Placa de Catalunya make this an ideal spot for ""touristing."" Yes, you can find a less expensive option--but the pluses this hotel provides make the extra $ worth it!",5,2016,04,06
37,Wonderful hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel for a work conference, but decided to extend my stay there when work was done. The hotel was beautiful and in a great location (right off the main street, Las Ramblas). I felt very comfortable and welcome during my stay. I would definitely recommend this to people traveling to Barcelona!",5,2016,04,05
37,The worse hotel ever,"It was my boyfriends birthday we came to Spain to celebrate his birthday we booked a double room they gave us a twin . Very noisy rooms now the next room is watching tv and i cant sleep , very rood staffs they don't care about anything at the end not a 5 star hotel",1,2016,03,31
37,"Great location, family friendly","The staff at this hotel were so nice.  When we checked in they gave my daughter (5YO) a gift of legos and a coloring page, PLUS her own key, which was a hit.  My husband is a platinum Starwood member, so we were upgraded to a wonderful suite with a view of a small square.  The location was convenient to the metro, a bunch of important historic sites, the Barri Gotic.  The hotel was nicely renovated.",5,2016,03,30
37,Perfect location in the heart of La Rambla,"We (family of 4...two 40somethings & two teen boys) stayed here for two nights in March as part of a journey to see FC BArcelona play Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League.
This was as points stay using Starwood points. We book two rooms.
Because purpose of stay was to see Barca, we relied on the Le Meridien concierges to obtain tickets for us.  Can't remember all of their names, but Maria Bru was excellent help for us.  The hotel uses MYBCNEVENTS for tickets and the experience was flawless.  Tix were waiting for us on our day of arrival, one day before the match.
Front desk staff were both efficient and stellar in their customer service. (Kasia was fantastic)  The hotel is as you expect from the brand, very very happy with the rooms.
Located on La Rambla, you could not find a better base to explore the heart of Barcelona.  Steps to Liceu metro station, easy walking to the Mediterranean, gothic quarter, La Boqueria.  You will run out of days before you experience everything that is close to this hotel.
Metro to the Camp Nou is easy...walk to Liceu metro stop, take the M3 line to Les Corts and enjoy the short walk to the stadium.
Beside the hotel on La Ramble is a Carrefour grocery store.  Great hot deli as you enter with many choices for grabbing a light meal to go...empanadas, etc.  Grab a one euro sangria and a bowl of paella as well from the front and you are good to go.
We had hoped to practice lots of Spanish in Barcelona, however unlike France everyone freely spoke English and many many signs in stores were in both Spanish and English.
A fantastic hotel, in a great location.  We would definitely return.",4,2016,03,27
37,Excellent location,"Great location to Las Ramblas and all the shops along it.  Easy walking distance to the Cathedral but you need to take a cab to the Segrada Familia, which is beautiful.  The rooms in hotel are very nice and we even had a walkin shower.",4,2016,03,24
37,Very cosy stay,"Before my arrival, the experience specialist Ana Miquel has been contacted me regarding my possible needs upon arrival, which is really wonderful. She fulfilled all of my request, including early check in around 9.30 am and better yet with upgrade as well. Service wise they are very very good and caring, they even helped me to book my lunch place. Location is at La Rambla...so easy to go anywhere and there is a taxi stand just in front if you don't feel like walking, very very convenient. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Barcelona.",4,2016,03,24
37,modern & stylish,"great hotel in a great location next to Les Ramblas, with easy walking access to all Barcelona has to offer - we were given a lovely spacious room with a FAB bathroom and shower to die for - nice helpful reception, I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona",5,2016,03,24
37,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Just steps from Las Ramblas, the Meridien is in the perfect location to explore Barcelona on foot. The Gothic Quarter is 3 minutes away, and the Sea is a nice 20 minute walk. 

Restaurants, Tapas Bars, cafes, wine stores, even a Starbucks is within a minute or two on foot. 

The hotel's buffet breakfast is exceptionally good, and service is excellent. 

Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,24
37,Impeccable service,"Came to Barcelona for the FCB Escola Easter tournament . This was not the event hotel , sought it sue to Starwood and previous Meridien experiences. No disappointments here. Great location just off La Rambla, excellent staff and service that go above the call of duty.",5,2016,03,23
37,Breakfast was fantastic!,This hotel is situated on La Ramblas and is within walking distance to a million restaurants.  The rooms are nice and large and very cool looking.  The breakfast is fantastic as the ham and eggs were the best I have ever had.  Two thumbs up!,5,2016,03,22
37,best attention & service,"The staff is the best, the nouvelle vague selected music is a compelling soundtrack, and the hotel in general is enjoyable, very centric, great food, the only missed point is the ""jacuzzi""... too small and useless in cold weather.",4,2016,03,20
37,"Great location, quiet rooms","Despite being just on the corner of La Rambla, we didn't hear anything even with our window open. You are steps from the Catalunya metro, the Barri Gotic, and it's an easy walk to the seafront. The La Rambla area is very crowded and touristy, but it is a short walk to L'exiample and you are next to Raval where you can find great dining and shopping options. The rooms at Le Meridien are not huge, but modern and thoughtfully laid out. We had a king-size bed, desk, table and chairs, nice large bathroom with shower, all tiled in slate, minibar, and safe. We were very comfortable! The closets were ample, but we could have used some drawer space for clothes or a luggage rack for a suitcase. We had coffee and pastries each morning, and room service was super fast and everything was delicious. Everyone at the hotel seemed to be at least bilingual (I speak Castellaño, but my husband does not). I heard Catalan, Castellano, French, and excellent English. 

We would definitely return to Le Meridien!",4,2016,03,20
37,Average service at best ,"Good location and friendly front desk staff.  Very disappointing housekeeping when our room was dirty at 4pm.  Sat and waited in the lobby and at 445pm I asked for a a manager whose answer was we clean rooms till 5.  Indifferent and would not recommend the hotel after this experience... Customer service is not their strong suit!!

",3,2016,03,20
37,Great location!,"Perfect location for exploring Barcelona.  Centrally located to Catalunya Plaza, the waterfront and positioned between 2 metro stops.  Was given a first floor room (212) facing Las Ramblas which was a concern at first due to noise.  Turned out to be quiet and excellent for people watching.  Hotel staff was polite, friendly and helped with everything we needed, including a ice bucket for a bottle of Cava.",4,2016,03,19
37,Great location,"The hotel is in a great location in the middle of Las Ramblas, they have a multi-lingual staff.  The room we had was in the back and had a bad view inside of another building. We had the staff mail postcards for us that were not received yet, so I am not sure they were mailed, as the postcards from other locations were received.",4,2016,03,19
37,Great Experience,"I stayed at this hotel with a group of friends for 5 days.  The room was a decent size, very clean and nicely appointed.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The concierge staff was amazing.  I think I went to them every day with a request or to ask for help.  They couldn't have been more accommodating.  The food in the hotel was very good (the croissants were unbelievable!)  I liked the location too.  I would definitely recommend and I would stay again.",5,2016,03,17
37,Excellent location and even better service!,"I stayed with wife and two young children (ages 6 and 9) over Spring Break. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a family suite. Hotel is located on La Rambla, a few blocks from the market, La Boqueria. For breakfast, the service was good but the selection could be a bit better. The concierge was very helpful in selecting delicious dinner locations. At checkin, they gave the kids Legos to build and play with.",4,2016,03,17
37,Great Hotel on Rambla,Stayed here for a few nights back in the summer. The hotel is right on Rambla with nice modern amenities of all sorts. Was not given an upgrade being an SPG member which was a little disappointing; but other than that all around all top notch.,4,2016,03,16
37,"Location, location, location ","An exceptional hotel, very well maintained, staff at check in where welcoming.  

The location was very central to restaurants, bars - but yet you could hear a pin drop in the hotel room which is a must in getting a nights sleep.

The hotel bar is relaxing, but did not experience the evening food.  Breakfast had a reasonable selection of fruits, breads and hot food.

Worth a visit.",4,2016,03,16
37,Nice Place to Park when in Barcelona,We stayed here on many occasions before we moved to Barcelona.  I always felt the rooms were very comfortable and had every amenity I needed.  The service was good and the food in the restaurant was fine.  Not elegant dining but fine.  It's location is in the heart of the Rambla so there are lots of tourist in and out.  I would stay here again if I needed to because of the location and it's mid to upper level but I live here now so no need!  Manager is very nice!,4,2016,03,15
37,Central Hotel  ,"Very nice hotel - central location -great to walk everywhere and explore the city. Harbor is 30 min walk, market halls 3 min and beach 45 min .. Shopping 1 min. 
Room 126 is a two single bed room facing the little side road. Bathroom clean and modern .. 
",4,2016,03,15
37,Great location and excellent staff,"Le Méridien is the hotel I return to whenever in Barcelona and it doesn't disappoint. It is on La Rambla, and while quiet and safe,  two turns and you're in the heart of La Rambla with easy access to tourist attractions and transportation. The rooms are modern and the beds are comfortable.The breakfast buffet is worth booking with your room. The gym is basic and sufficient and the lobby has great seating for conversations or just reading.",5,2016,03,14
37,More motel 6...,"We arrived here at 6pm and despite my being an SPG member and it being my birthday I was given a motel 6 type room on the 4th floor by Javier at the front desk. 

Thanks to Javier I got a room with no view, run down furniture and zero amenities. No kleenex tissue, no cotton swabs. Worst was the lack of room temperature control. The room became sweltering at 1am requiring is to open the window only to hear the hooligans at street level. 

Before you believe me to be coming off like a prima dona, I had recently stayed in a dusit Thani and a W hotel at lower cost with great rooms and amenities. I expected at least this from Le Meridian Barcelona. 

After our first night I expressed my unhappiness about our stay to Sanchez at the front desk and he was completely emphatic to my cause. I emphasized the quality of the staff and the location of the hotel thus far were very good, but I simply expected more. 

We returned to our room that afternoon and were told that we would be transferred to anther room the following day. 

Literally dog house to penthouse. If you can, request for room 818. It offers a great southern view of the city. Plus it has a large balcony and all the expected amenities one comes to expect in a 5 star hotel at this price point. 

Kudos for the bottle of champagne awaiting us on my birthday. 

Thanks to Sanchez for much improving our stay at your lovely hotel.

37,Comfortable rooms in a great location,"I'm lucky that I get to visit Barcelona a couple times a year for work. And this has allowed me to stay in a number of different hotels in this great city. And while there are many great choices, Le Méridien is the one I return to whenever possible. It's got the right mix of comfort, utility, and location to be a great choice on any visit to Barcelona. It sits right on La Rambla, providing easy and immediate access to the city's main attractions including my favorite area, the Gothic Quarter. But it's also centrally located allowing me to get to business meetings, the Fira convention center, or be a tourist in my downtime.

The rooms are modern without being sparse. They're clean and comfortable with great beds, it's quiet, there's free wifi, and more spacious bathrooms than many small hotels. And you'll  find a typical restaurant that faces the street with the morning breakfast buffet. A good but expensive way to start the day. And yet again, you're close enough to options to venture out and find something for suitable to your wallet and palate.

Barcelona has many quaint and local hotels that are appealing. But Le Méridien is a great choice for most any visitor, and certainly a great compromise for business travelers who want a touch of local flavor, and Starwood points, during their stay.",4,2016,03,11
37,very nice hotel,"Very conveniet and central location of the Hotel, on the ""La Rambla"", that is very nice to walk along this street 
nearby to the metro 
                           
, Very Nice Staff
 we had arrived a little bit earlier but the room was ready so we could leave our stuff and start travel                             
 Good and varied breakfast
                          
Pleasant and Relaxed atmosphere",5,2016,03,09
37,Great location with Pros and Cons,"I really enjoyed this hotel- modern amenities and good service- The location to everything is pretty awesome. First advice- A Ramblas view at the Le Meridian might 'sounds nice' but- if you get one, be prepared. It can get very noisy very late and this gets very annoying when your staying for a week. My other note of caution - the Ramblas during the day is fine and although you should always be on guard for pick pockets, most people feel generally safe and are having fun....however, if your out late - or leaving to catch an early flight at El Prat) you may be confronted by some very sketchy and scary characters. If you pre booked transfers- Get picked up Directly in front of the hotel and wait inside for the driver. Or Have staff hail a cab for you while you wait inside for it. I am well traveled- I avoid all confrontation, however I had a very scary confrontation waiting outside the hotel by a drunk patron annoyed as my bags were being staged into the car. To the hotels credit they handled this as pros - but I've heard many similar stories. Just be cautious and keep out of danger. I've since enjoyed staying at hotels on Via Lantana - it's busy street yes, but more removed from party central and I'd feel better bringing my family. It is a beautiful city- be cautious, but Barcelona is unique, fun and surprisingly wonderful! ",4,2016,03,08
37,"A Peaceful, Seamless Stay in the Heart of Barcelona","First off, the location is hard to beat. It's right in the center of the city, around the corner from La Rambla, a popular street with shops and vendors lining the central walkway. We arrived tired from 14 hours of flying and were immediately taken to our room which had a modern look and was very clean. They made sure we were well taken care of and the whole experience was very pleasant. The breakfast was also excellent; it had an omelette bar as well as quite the selection of pastries and antipasto. Awesome hotel.",5,2016,03,08
37,"Look no more,  Le Meridien Barcelona can't be beat!","Our 2 night stay was fantastic from the get go.  We greatly appreciated having been given a room early on the day of our arrival.  

The hotel is magnificent and we knew we had chosen well from the moment that the elevator doors opened to our floor.   Facing us was a table with a platter of fresh green apples and top fashion magazines and newspapers.  Upon opening the door to our room, we loved the tasteful decor and immaculately clean everything.  The bathroom had it's own television, rain shower, and was stocked with fresh towels, bathrobes, and fine shampoos, conditioners, soaps and gels.     The bed was so comfortable,  and the easy chair with side table very inviting.   

Next morning's breakfast was not to be missed.   From the gentleman whipping up delicious omelets to the buffet with fresh fruit, veggies, cheeses, bacon, sausages,  waffles, pancakes, croissants, blueberry muffins and divine coffee,  we left happy and full.

Kudos to the Hotel for the smiling and courteous staff members we came across.   We were lucky to have met the delightful and charming Salvador Batlle from the Front Office while he accompanied the charming General Manager on her rounds.    

To sum up, the central location of the hotel is perfect for strolling on the Ramblas, exploring the Gothic quarter,  and the friendly staff makes you feel special and welcome.   If there was an Oscar award for best hotel, Le Meridien Barcelona would win.",5,2016,03,06
37,Drinking hole,Like the Renaissance hotel we never stayed here but its location on Las Ramblas made it an ideal spot to pop in and have a few drinks while watching the world go by. Table service for drinks and snacks was top notch and the toilets were very clean and spacious. We drank here everyday of our stay.,5,2016,03,05
37,Average Hotel,"Hotel Location is fantastic, however due to high occupancy we waited long to get checked inn. there is nothing wrong in this place but i don't find anything that make me wow in this hotel. i found that housekeeping staffs are doing their best to deliver the service, in my point of view they may need more staffs.",4,2016,03,03
37,very good location in the heart of the town,"the hotel is located at 20 mt from the famous Ramblas, at 200 mt from Plaza de Catalunya.Therefore very comfortable to reach by Subway ( green line stop Liceu ) and from AIRPORT ( Bus in Plaza de Catalunya).
My room at 4th floor was quiet, absolutly not noisy.
Staff kind and fast. Room a very big double bed and a good tv screen.
Price reasonable for the level and location",4,2016,03,02
37,Beautiful property in a great location,"Had a wonderful 6 night wintry stay. Great room, great staff (especially the concierge team). Recommend higher floors due to some street noise. The neighbourhood is great for restaurants and there is a grocery store only 100 metres away. Enjoy!",5,2016,03,02
37,"Great location, awful staffs. STAY AWAY","The location of the hotel is ideal- close to everything. Room is great but try to stay AWAY from it!!!!

However, the staffs are extremely rude
1. Our 22-month daughter was vomiting at 3AM and we asked the room service to bring us some extra water. They said you had to pay XXX to have the water

2.  The next day we were rushing to downstairs to have breakfast buffet before heading to the airport. I wanted to take one banana with me because my daughter didn't have any food yet. They said NO. YOU CANNOT TAKE ANYTHING AWAY

3. What could be worse? They charged my 22- month daughter 30 EURO for breakfast buffet without telling me.",1,2016,03,01
37,Great location - awesome staff,"Great central location on La Rambla without all the noise.  Large suite with amenities like a flat iron and a huge soaking tub.  Staff was warm, welcoming, accommodating and the concierge gave great restaurant recommendations!  Would definitely stay again!",5,2016,02,29
37,Great place to spend a couple of days,"My partner and I decided to spend a few days in Barcelona while we were visiting my family back home in Palencia (Spain). We booked this hotel last minute using our SPG points, which by the way was a great deal. 

The hotel is right by the Ramblas, a 5 mins stroll from the Boquería (Fresh Market), another 5 mins aways from Plaza de Catalunya where you can take the Bus Turistic (sightseing Bus, by the way, another great deal), just around the corner from the Barrio Gótico... All in all, if I were coming back to Barcelona, I would definitively come back ;)",5,2016,02,28
37,Great,"Location is great. Just minutes walk from Metro station either Placa Catalunya or Lieu. Staffs are kind and helpful. I booked thru priceline but they still gave me SPG credit which is nice. Room is clean and Wifi is strong. In general, I enjoyed my stay pretty much.",5,2016,02,22
37,Bit disappointed,"I was upgraded to a junior suite as part of Starwood Platinum. The hotel has gone out of its way to bring water, little desserts, hot tea and have it all in the room when I'm back. Nice touch to make me feel like I'm an appreciated and loved loyalty member. 

The room is nice (but small for a suite). The interior is trendy. Scandinavian meets industrial meets Barcelona. I especially like the coffee table and the selection of magazines. Makes me feel like home. I also liked the desk - was easy to get work done. 

Beds are comfy (they gave me two doubles vs a king), pillows come in two pairs - one squishy and one medium - and the bathroom is good. The closet space and changing area is nice. 

The room numbers in the hotel are not sequential so good luck finding the room the first time. It isn't a big deal since the floor is small. 

Unfortunately the room looks like it could use a deep steam clean. The carpet doesn't look great but realized it isn't stains but the way the fibers in the carpets work. The white couch needs a good steam clean. 

Also wish there was an Apple TV or connectivity, so I could beam movies from my phone to the TV. ",4,2016,02,19
37,Excellent Hotel with an excellent location,"This is a perfect hotel to visit Barcelona. It is located right at the heart of Barcelona. From the hotel, located right in Las Ramblas, you can visit several major attractions like the Cathedral, the Picasso museum and many others. My wife and I took a cruise and decided to stay 3 days in the city and we couldn't choose a better hotel. The accommodations are top notch and the customer services was excellent. We arrived around 10am and they were real nice and let us get into the room as soon as was ready. 
You won't have any regrets staying at this hotel. Highly recommended!!",5,2016,02,18
37,Great hotel,"My husband and I spent 4 days here on our babymoon. The location was perfect for us, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet our room was (although, we did not have a room on La Rambla by request). We were upgraded to a junior suite and it was lovely. The bathroom was superb! My only ""issue"" was the lighting and the worn out couch fabric. It wasn't terrible, but for a 5-star I was surprised by the condition of the couch (small stains, a hole, etc). I spent some time in the spa and had a lovely mani/pedi. It seemed a bit rushed, but still a quality job. The breakfast was good, but again, for a 5-star I was surprised by the lack of variety. All in all, I would come back to this hotel and recommend it. By US standards, though (and I realize I was not in the US), it was not a 5-star hotel. ",4,2016,02,17
37,Fantastic first visit to Barcelona!,"This hotel is in a perfect, central location for first-timers to Barcelona.  Short walk to the gothic quarter and many landmarks, and more importantly to many good eats :)  (Pinotxo, Biocenter, and El Quim de la Boqueria to name a few). We took advantage of the spa sauna.  It's small but perfect when you have it to yourselves. I also got a massage and it was so great that I fell asleep on the table. (Ask for Isabel). Lastly, the rain shower is probably the best I've ever experienced.  Highly recommend!",5,2016,02,14
37,It's like staying on the Times Square of Barcelona,"Stayed over at Le Meridien La Ramblas around the Christmas holidays. The hotel is located on the top end of La Ramblas which makes the hotel right at the heart of Barcelona, almost like staying on Barcelona's version of Times Square. 

Within the same building there's a Carrefour for groceries, and there's a spa and pool which I tried one evening. 

Location wise, it's in between 2 metro stations on the same line, Catalunya and Liceu. There's a Starbucks just in the building next door, as well as a good restaurant opposite called Luzia as well as one inside the hotel called Centonze. Centonze in particular was a favourite of mine. An amazing serving of dishes that I would consider one the best I had in Barcelona and that's not an easy thing to achieve considering the dizzying array of choices on the gourmet front. Plus, while I was there they had a SPG promotion that made the meal really value for money. The place is on the higher-end scale but comparable or better value then the more touristy fare you get near the harbour. 

One note is that Barcelona has strict laws on occupancy and that caught me by surprise as the hotel could not check my family in. There was 4 of us and 2 of them are kids. Luckily, there was a family room available which I had to pay additional for (if only I've been upgraded!). So if you're bringing kids, look out for this requirement in case you get stranded. 

After the initial distress, we were delighted when we got into our family room. There was a living room with a convertible sofa, the bedroom was huge and the bathroom equally as huge. Totally loved the bathroom. It had a large separate shower and a bath. The best surprise of all was the outdoor patio that greeted us when we pull open the blinds. Running the length of the room from the living room to the bedroom, there were sunbeds and and outdoor dining table. We were really blessed with a warm weather over Christmas which meant we could enjoy ice-cream out on the patio and enjoy the outdoors while we were there. 

On one of the evenings, I ventured into the spa and got myself a treatment. I didn't had my swim trunks with me (didn't think I needed one in winter) and was unable to take advantage of the spa, pool and saunas. The massage I received was pleasant and the hour went by too quickly. 

In the lobby itself there's a waiting area that has been designed like a living room, complete with a piano. It was really nice hanging out here while waiting for the rest of the family to get ready before heading out. 

Overall, the central location of the hotel meant that I didn't had to go far to explore Barcelona attractions, get food or shopping. We walked almost everywhere, supplemented by the metro and the bus which was extremely convenient. 

",4,2016,02,14
37,Las Ramblas Shopping location!,"Las Ramblas is loud, vibrant, and busy and yet Le Meridien Barcelona was amazingly quiet inside.   The hotel is in an excellent location for shopping, people watching, eating, tourism, and walking - basically everything you want!

Upon arrival I was greeted warmly with a prompt check-in.  My room was cozy in size, nicely decorated and clean.  Wi-Fi was great.

On a few occasions I enjoyed wine in the lounge area and the service was excellent.  Fellow travelers were also enjoying a break from the city and shared local experiences.  My breakfast and dining experiences were equally as good. 

The concierge seemed to be always busy but knowledgeable and helpful with tips on dining, tourist stops, and shopping.  When it was time to conclude my holiday checkout was a breeze - quick and efficient - hassle free.

Great place to stay!",4,2016,02,13
37,Piece of Soviet Union in Spain,"Location is great but service awful. After a long day in city we thought we will have  drinks in bar next to Rambla. Place was empty but waiter said that this is restaurant, not bar. However, we got the drinks, but second drinks they denided to serve. In empy restaurant! 
Only in former Sovet Union we have met same kind of service. A professional waiter would have said that sorry, we have reservaitions, so when customers come would you please move to other place. That would be have been fine of cource. 
We all had our platinium SPG cards, but we decided to throw them away and concentrate in future to a chain that has customers in focus, not bureaucracy.

37,Absolute luxury!,"We have stayed in this hotel in the family room with my husband and Twins. It was a fantastic very large room, spacious bathroom and shower, and a good size living room. Very clean with elegant toiletries including toothbrush, razor etc, hair straightener, and hair dryer. The check in was fast and friendly. They are also kids friendly as they gave little toys and Legos for kids as well. Their restaurant is very nicely decorated but it is also open to public situated in a corner so it was a bit difficult for us to get a table as it was always busy. Breakfast was fantastic with al lot of varieties. Enjoyed every minute of our experience here. 
One tip: right across from the le meridien there is a restaurant where we are our second night dinner. It is a pizza place and I had the best pizza of my life there. Definitely recommend it!!! ",5,2016,02,10
37,Great hotel! In the center of everything.,"Lovely hotel - Great rooms. In the center of Las Ramblas, so be sure to get an inside room if you're a light sleeper!  Very friendly staff - helped us plan dinners and tourism. We didn't get a chance to experience many of the amenities because we were so busy with the city. ",4,2016,02,09
37,Nice,Stayed here because the W was booked.  It was nice as was the room.  The location was very nice as you are right in the middle of everything.  This is nice but it is not beachfront.  It is very closely situated to many tourist sites though.,4,2016,02,06
37,"Great hotel, unbeatable location","Stayed here 7 nights in January and February 2016. Good customer service and they upgraded us nicely. They gave our kids Legos on check in. We ordered room service daily and they were always timely and delicious. The location is superb, right on La Ramblas in the heart of everything. It's so nice to step out of your hotel and have loads of restaurants, shops, sights and people watching. 
We stayed in attached rooms on the fourth and first floors. I was worried about the noise on the first floor facing la Ramblas but it was never a problem. One deluxe room perfect for kids with two doubles or oversized twins. Great size by European standards. My husband and I were upgraded to suites. Both large. The prestige suite lacked in coziness, especially the couch but it was huge. The family suite was more comfortable. Both suites had king beds. Turn down service every night. Kind and friendly staff. Would stay here again. ",5,2016,02,04
37,City Break,"My review of Le Meridien, Barcelona is somewhat tardy. I visited in March 15 for a long weekend break with my partner and we both had a great time. Le Meridien is in a central location with easy access to buses and tubes for visiting all areas of the city. Check in was a breeze with no wait at all. The reception team were friendly and professional and a prepaid voucher from lastminute.com (at a brilliant price) posed no problem. Concierge were also well presented and very willing to assist and offer advice on what to see and do. Security was obviously taken importantly and I had no issue leaving any valuables in the room throughout my stay. The room was a perfectly good size for two people, the bed itself was very comfy and some free water, tea and coffee are supplied. The surrounding area can be quite noisy right through the night so the soundproofing was a blessing, we didn't hear a peep from outside or any neighbouring rooms. The bathroom was modern with a huge tub and rainfall shower, which was delightful. We didn't book breakfast or have drinks at the hotel so can't comment on the restaurant or bar. Le Meridien meets all of my requirements for a city break. I would happily stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.",4,2016,02,03
37,Great rooms in the best las ramblas location,"Been at a business convention of our comoany.
We used all the conf. Rooms for a sales event.
Hotel staff service was excellant. The rooms cosy and clean.
Location is right next to la boqueria market on the remblas.
Has a great time will definetly come back",5,2016,01,31
37,Comfortable hotel in a prime location,"Le Meridien is located at the top of Las Ramblas so an ideal location for a visit to Barcelona. Within a few steps of the hotel there is a wide choice of restaurants and easy access to the metro.

I was initially given a room with twin beds but a trip to reception got this sorted. There are floors for SPG members and I stayed on one of them. The rooms are not large but they are well laid out and comfortable. The beds live up to the usual Starwood standard. The bathroom had a spacious shower cabinet with both a rainshower head and a more conventional one. Water pressure and temperature was good. There was televisions in both the bathroom and the bedroom. Free wifi was available and this seemed to have a good speed.

Breakfast does not open until 0700 which is a little late when you are there on business. There is a good range of food on offer for breakfast and the coffee is of a good quality.

There is a small gym in the basement. Two of the machines weren't working properly the first time I used the gym. I did report this to reception, but they weren't fixed before I left the hotel.

Overall a good hotel with friendly service in a really good location.",4,2016,01,29
37,Nice hotel in a great location,"A nice hotel (among the best in this area) in a great location near all the acton on the Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya.  Amenities are pleasant, my room was spacious, well laid out and tastfully designed.  A comfortable stay with helpful staff and great service.",4,2016,01,22
37,The best of Barcelona Hotels,"Rooms very clean and roomy, Staff extremely helpful and courteous, I felt as though I was family. Wonderful view overlooking the main street, and noise was blocked out by very good thick  windows. The gym was amazing, as was the round the clock security, and these where real guards dressed in suits, but they where the real deal. I felt very secure there. It is somewhat pricey but you get a lot for your buck. They also have a eatery and bar, with fantastic people at both. I would stay here again and have recommended it to people that have also loved it.  This was in May of 2013, sorry it took so long to write this.",5,2016,01,20
37,"Amazing location , fabulous staff , perfect stay","Stayed here for 2 nights last weekend and I have to say everything was just perfect.
The location was amazing , the staff so friendly and helpful and the rooms superb.
We had breakfast included and there was just about everything you could want there.
I will return as soon as I possibly can .
Barcelona is a great place to visit .",5,2016,01,20
37,"4.5 review - great location, nice hotel, little more expensive than others in the area","Title says it all. This review is really a 4.5 out of 5. The hotel is in great condition, very helpful and friendly staff, nice sized rooms, and overall very clean. The location is perfect for walking around the center of town and only 2 blocks from where the bus from the airport drops off. 
I found it to be more expensive than other comparable hotels in the area, but decided to stay here because of the brand. In the future I may try one of the boutique hotels in the area instead.",4,2016,01,20
37,Nice location on the Ramblas,Good central location for tourists right on the Ramblas. I have stayed here many times but lately the quality is declining. The rooms were updated but were not cleaned well and we had to be moved. The woman at the front desk was very rude when we asked to change rooms so much so that we moved the next day to Bagues or 1898 I cant remember. The restaurant in the lobby is good.,4,2016,01,18
37,"Nice hotel, great location","Situated on La Rambla, this hotel is great for discovering Barcelona. Renovated in the past few years, the rooms are modern but a little small. Shower over the bath I don't like. Breakfast was good and the staff were generally helpful.",4,2016,01,17
37,"Excellent hotel, excellent location","Nothing to complain about. Modern, well appointed room.  Nice extras.  Would definitely stay again- you can walk to everything. Clean rooms, friendly staff. Restaurant was good but expensive. We came to the hotel from our cruise which finished in Barcelona and they were nice enough to let us check in at like 10 am.  Nice place.",5,2016,01,13
37,Perfect location!,"The hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.
Plus they have an iMessage service so you can text them any time for any requests and questions and they reply back right away. That came in so handy during our stay there.
The room is nice and spacious and the housekeeping service was on point.
Plus they have complimentary robes and slippers for you to use during your stay.
And the biggest bonus is the location - so many restaurants, activities, places that are walking distance from the hotel.
And if not, there's plenty of taxis that come by (or the bellhop can call one for you).
I'd love to stay at this hotel again if i come back to this beautiful city again.",5,2016,01,10
37,Mrs,"I am a Travel Agent  that booked a group of 15 we stayed here and the rooms were great,the service was great,the restaurant and food was great.The area right outside the hotel was all in walking distance .we loved it.will recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,10
37,Sauna not rooms,It's mentioned that this hotel is air conditioned but I was surprised that's it's not!!!!! Once you ask and start complaining they will get a fan which does nothing my question is how they got five star and their features lesser than a three star hotel!!!!!,1,2016,01,08
37,Perfect location,"right there where everything is, such a handy location to walk around. We had a nice room and front desk staff are very kind and helpful.  We did not try the restaurant or the break,  so I cannot judge this part. ",4,2016,01,07
37,Great location,"Great location for a first-timer to Barcelona. Central and plenty of things to eat, shop and see from the hotel. A bit touristy, but since it was our first visit it was perfect for us. Room was nice and everything you expect from a Le Meridien. The only negative part of our experience was the Spa. It's really not one. We had to wait 15 minutes before our massage therapists showed up and no one was around to greet us. The massages were disappointing. The front desk staff did give us a discount after hearing about our concerns, but they would be better off not even offering this service.",4,2016,01,06
37,Great location and lovely staff!,"This hotel is located in the hustle and bustle of Barcelona - La Rambla district.  Within walking distance from many shops, restaurants, cafes and tourist attractions.  There is a busy square nearby, so if you are looking for a quiet stay make sure you request for a room away from the main street",4,2016,01,05
37,"Location, Location, Location!","Need I say more? You couldn't ask for a better location in Barcelona unless all you're after is peace and seclusion. Tons of great restaurants, shops, supermarkets within walking distance.  Being so close to La boqueria (food market) was the best! 

The hotel had way above average rooms (decor, comfort, amenities, etc) for European standards.  Buffet breakfast was also good but there wasn't a single item change at all for the three mornings I stayed. 

I will definitely stay here again when I revisit Barcelona!",4,2016,01,05
37,Nice hotel in an Ideal Location,"The hotel is very nice. It's located just off La Rambla, so you are steps away from many attractions in the city. There is a metro stop not too far from the hotel as well, which was very convenient. The rooms were comfortable and spacious for European hotel rooms. We had a room with two double beds, and everything fit nicely in the room. The bathroom was large and modern, with a rainfall shower head- very relaxing! We did have a couple small problems we needed to call maintenance for, and they came quickly and fixed the problems in 10 minutes. We had breakfast included with our stay, which was very nice. The staff was very professional and helpful.",5,2016,01,04
37,great staff,"Great hotel with a great staff.Hotel is built on a curve so rooms close to the elevators are smaller. Hotel is right on the Ramblas. Family vacation had two rooms. Gabriella at reception was wonderful regarding a room change. Ricardo the concierge was so very helpful with tickets and rest. reservations. Called ""service"" regarding a sink that was leaking and a drape problem--was taking care of very quickly. Had breakfast buffet  each am and serving staff was very friendly and attentive.",4,2016,01,04
37,"Nice hotel, excellent location ","The hotel is centrally located on La Rambla street. It is my 2nd time staying at this hotel. It's excellent for tourists who want to experience the busy side of Barcelona. Many restaurants nearby, and if you enjoy walking it's around 1 KM from Picasso museum, 2 KM from the beach, around 3 KM from La Sagrada Familia, and other attractions. In the lobby they have a nice cafeteria to enjoy nice coffee and local sweets (photos). Staff are very nice and professional. ",5,2016,01,03
37,Unreliable hotel,"I made a reservation for 3 people about 10 months ago, no extra charge for roller bed. However, when I checked out, they charged me for the extra bed, 75 euro (+tax) per night. How can I trust the hotel next time I make a reservation? The staffs are uncaring about the issue.",1,2016,01,01
37,Not Impressed,"After visiting Barcelona in September 2014 and loving it so much we decided to see more of Spain in 2015 and felt the best way to do this was to take a Tauck tour, therefore, we didn't pick this hotel ourselves as in the past.  

Definitely would not stay here again.  From the minute we arrived we found the front desk staff  very unhelpful.  The room was small and faced a brick wall....no charm.
Don't know if it was the fact we were with a tour that we were basically dismissed...this tour was very expensive so it shouldn't have been that way.   

There are so many hotels to choose from if it's location you're after...that would not be a reason to stay here.

Anyway...the food in the restaurant was excellent...I'll give it that. 

Will go back to Barcelona again for sure, but will stay at the Mercer as we did the year before.",2,2015,12,29
37,Decent hotel--hospitable staff,"We were referred to this hotel by good friends who were also staying there.  We had consistently positive experiences with the hotel staff during out three-day stay.  The room was modern, spacious enough and generally well appointed.  Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice and modern although the lighting was not great.  Our shower had a glob of hair in the drain and overflowed.  We were able to remove the hair (yuck!) to clear the drain.  The wifi worked great and the housekeeping service was good.  The location was near attractions, however the area seemed a little ""transient"" later at night.  We would stay again of the price is right.",4,2015,12,26
37,Pleasant Stay,"The entrance is located just off the Rambla, convenient location close to the latin quarter and several popular squares.  Service was above average, the room very clean and the  room was quite large considering European standards.  Additionally, the rate was not as high as you might imagine.  We would definitely stay here again.  The only negative was the lack of swimming pool, although thet did have a small ""puddle"" to cool down in.",4,2015,12,21
37,Location and Style,"Stayed at Le Meridien for three nights - a great location right along La Rambla. The hotel is very well appointed and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious for Europe. The morning breakfast, which was included in our room fee had a great selection. The hotel is  close to the old city which is well worth walking - even better to take a guided walking tour. Close to the great food market, Mercat de la Boqueria which is a must see if you are in Barcelona. Great shopping nearby. I recommend this hotel if you are visiting Barcelona; a bonus is that is part of Starwood hotel group.",5,2015,12,20
37,"""Location and Hotel was Great""",Stayed three Nights and was within walking distance of Christmas Market and St Josephs Market and lots of great shops and Restaurants.  Loved the Hotel Breakfast and the three Restaurants just outside the front door.  Would stay there again.,5,2015,12,17
37,Just Average,I reviewed this property one year ago and it was not a positive reviewed.  Frankly the only reason I returned was because it is a Starwood property and I am a member of the program.  Last year one of my concerns was the lack of security at the property.  I am happy to report security is now very visible.  I also wanted to acknowledge Vera at the front desk whom was always pleasant and helpful.  The room was adequate but I still can’t understand the limited television programing selection.  Two other issues that remain unchanged.  1. There is no concierge lounge for suite guest and the breakfast buffet is not up to the standard I am accustom to at every other Meridian I have stayed at.  I still cannot recommend this hotel because the value for price is just not there.,3,2015,12,12
37,Excellent location,"We stayed there for 4 nights . Hotel is at excellent location . Rooms are good and spacious from Europe standard.
We had three rooms -two regular rooms and one upgraded suite . Suite and rooms were accessible by different set of elevators . I wish I was told this before, I would not have paid for upgraded room.

Hotel Restaurant is ok, nothing great . Lot of other excellent places right outside hotel. 
Hotel is waking to train station .

Stay agAin --may be ",4,2015,12,10
37,Great Hotel near the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel while we visited Barcelona. The hotel lobby was very modern and the room was spacious and beds were very comfortable.  Staff was very helpful and friendly. The lady at the check in desk gave my little boy a pack of toy when she noticed we had a child with us.  They even sent a crib to our room without us having to ask. 

The breakfast was really nice with lots of selections.  

The hotel is located right at the Ramblas, one of the busiest and popular area in Barcelona, where you can find restaurants, shops, supermarkets, and everything right outside the hotel.  We enjoyed walking around the hotel so much.",5,2015,12,09
37,"Lovely hotel, poor service post cruise when we are on our own","We had a three day AMA Waterways post-cruise stay at this hotel in early November.  While under the guidance of AMA everything went smoothly.  We stayed an extra night post AMA guidance and it was a nightmare.

Our flight got cancelled due to a rolling Lufthansa strike.  My husband went to the front desk to see if we could stay another night.  Whoever he spoke with said yes and gave him a card with our rate and note that included breakfast.

The next day, at noon, we receive a phone call from the front desk asking if they can help us with our luggage.  We say we are staying and she thought we were checking out.  Obviously the person from the day before didn't enter our additional day.  And we had neglected to get her name.

We went to the lobby with the card and the writing and the reception girl argued with us.  No breakfast.  We said fine.  We went out for lunch and when we returned to our room in the afternoon our key cards did not work.  

Two hotel personnel at the point had not looked after us well.  We went down to the desk and spoke with the person and someone else got involved.  The issue was neither of the first two personnel had swiped our credit card.  Yet the had the credit card information on file for the previous three nights.

There was absolutely no customer service therefore no customer satisfaction.  There was no interest in quickly solving a problem.

These folks need to find a way to say YES and be more thorough and thoughtful when handling what shouldn't have been such a simple situation.",1,2015,12,08
37,Wonderful Honeymoon Pre-Cruise Stay!,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon prior to our NCL Epic Mediterranean cruise. Check-in was quick and efficient, the clerk looked up my SPG number for me as I could not remember it, and we were greeted by chilled champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. The timing was perfect. Our room was on the SPG floor, had a king size bed, full bath with deep soaking tub and rain shower head. The bathtub was awesome. Enough room for two comfortably, but beware when stepping out of it as the floor of the bathtub itself is raised higher than the bathroom floor that you are stepping out onto, so if you are short or clumsy, be careful and hold onto the wall or countertop as you maneuver out. Be sure to tour the spa even if you don't get any services because the view from the rooftop hot tub is fantastic. 

This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. We walked Las Ramblas, explored the Gothic Quarter and the marina, and even ventured over to the Barcelona Zoo (which is a very nice zoo - lots of animals). It is only about a 15 minute drive to the cruise ship pier; one could actually walk from the hotel to the cruise ship pier, but it would be difficult carrying luggage and there did not seem to be a good path once you left Las Ramblas. I recommend getting a taxi from the hotel, which was approximately 16 euros with tip. The driver took us right up to the terminal entrance. Wonderful stay all around!",5,2015,12,05
37,"Great central location, staff is always super helpful","Great central location, staff is always super helpful.  The high quality bedding and pillows here make it so easy to get a good night sleep.  Multiple times the staff went out of their way to make are stay good.",4,2015,12,04
37,Perfect Place to Stay!,"Stayed at Le Meridien for 5 nights in November which we booked through Delta Airlines Vacations.  My daughter and I had a fantastic experience here - the location is unbeatable as it is right on La Rambla and only a few blocks walk to the central plaza Catalunya, the airport bus, the tour busses, the Metro, and great shopping. But beyond the location, everyone at the hotel was super friendly and helpful, and the basic Deluxe room was updated, contemporary and very luxurious. We were on the SPH floor which may have been why the room was so nice. Breakfast was included in our package and the buffet was exceptional - loved the made to order omelets.  My only complaint was that the heat wasn't very easy to manage and the sheets were a bit stiff, but everything else was superb and worthy of 5-stars.  If I return to this amazing city, I will certainly stay here again. ",5,2015,12,04
37,"Premium hotel, location is an advantage","They do not exceed expectations, that’s to make it in brief. Usually when you are lucky enough to stay in 5 star hotel, you expect something special: somewhere the service is unbelievable, somewhere design is so unique that hotel is remembered long after. With Le Meridien Barcelona we got what we expected, at a very reasonable price for the center of Barcelona, though after intense but really polite discussions with the managers on duty. The hotel offered us finally 2 adjacent rooms at a family rate which appeared to be very convenient. First statement from the hotel that we were not allowed together in one room with 2 kids easily brought the picture for my wife how one of us slept in the small lobby, and that was not fun. With the help of the hotel staff we found a reasonable compromise. So, the hotel! Rooms at the end of a long corridor in traditional brown palette gave was nice feeling, spacious and with really good beds. Dinner at the hotel restaurant made us feel even better with excellent service and fair price. Breakfast was not fascinating at all. Next time we stay at Le Meridien only if they give us good offer. 
Location of the hotel is the reason to stay there when you want to pack many things in the center of Barcelona in short period of time.",4,2015,12,01
37,Business stay in La ramblas - Meridien,"This is a hotel with very central location right middle of La ramblas in Barcelona . It is few mins walking so distance to the authentic mercato and right on top of a Carrefour store. I found the hotel rather overpriced for the smallish rooms - apr 18-20 sqm- no fancy frills, rather basic in general . It was ok for a single traveler but not ideal for bigger parties. There was no proper coffee machine- one of my key items in a business hotel these days. I would recommend rooms facing side - back street , much quieter and Ramblas facing rooms are at a premium for whatever reason. Breakfast is quite basic 3-4 star quality, nothing to remember or be impressed about, in a fairly congested room set up.",3,2015,11,30
37,Amazing,"At the first sight the stunning building makes you understand that the time to live in luxury is just in front of you! The employees are all with warm smiles,ready and welcome to assist all of our inquiries!
The fo manager who also checked us in treated us more than good and made us feel unique! She also spoiled us with a bottle of champagne combined with a wishing car for our honeymoon!
Carlos at the illy breakfast was the best person to start your day with!
Definitely coming back.",5,2015,11,28
37,Great Location,"The key advantage of this hotel is the location, you are on the Rambla, where all the tourists want to be. So easy to see the main sights. What's also great is it's right next to an art gallery and Le Meridian provides guests with complimentary passes. We didn't have time to go as it was a short trip and we wanted to see the main sites.

Breakfast is excellent, I would recommend getting the package that includes it as it's totally worth it. Rest of the food not as good.",5,2015,11,28
37,In the thick of it,"The best part about this hotel is the location and the buffet brekky. The view is ordinary (old, run down buildings out back), the rooms aren't flash and it has some weird outdoor bath and no pool. But if you're looking to walk out your front door and be in the middle of all the action - give this place a go. The staff are top rate too. Everyone we dealt with was friendly, helpful and happy to be there. ",4,2015,11,27
37,5 night in Barcelona,"Love this Hotel,  First little skeptical when the put me in the room facing the front entrance,  but later on I think I have nice view and lest noise compare facing La Rambla.  Great service good local We can go almost anywhere within 15 minutes walking.",4,2015,11,24
37,Just above average,"As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. 
I was left not sure about this hotel. I think its not sure it knows what it wants to be. Its kind of a cross between a Hyatt and a W. Yet wants to be a Ritz or a Fairmont. The room was average, very very modern and odd layout. (and I like modern, but still found this weird) The service was not very good at all, the wait times at the front desk was crazy, its clear they are very understaffed. Our reservation was made with Costco and included a bunch of ""extras"" none of which we got. I don't know if its their fault or Costcos.  The breakfast which we had two mornings was very good and truly a highlight of the stay. Our room faced the boulevard and found that around 1:00am prostitutes came out in large numbers and made for great entertainment chasing guys as they made their way back to their hotels.  The location is great! you can walk just about anywhere. Barcelona is a great city and CHEAP! Being our third city on a 3 tour of Europe we thought there was a mistake at the first restaurant we went to because it was so affordable.  Overall, would I return? Not likely. Actually I'm going back to Spain in 2 months and will likely book somewhere else.",4,2015,11,24
37,3 nights in Barcelona,"Great location, amazing staff. Room was great and bed was awesome. Our view outside of the window was some apartments, which is my only complaint since I am a devoted Starwoods member.   Breakfast was delicious and everyone from the front desk to the doorman was great. The staff also directed us to some amazing restaurants.",5,2015,11,23
37,Excellent Centrally located hotel with great service,I loved this hotel.  The rooms were clean and quiet considering the location.  The concierge staff was amazing and they helped us with our many requests.  We were there in July and the only negative was the lack of pool.  I highly recommend this hotel and will stay again when I make it back to Barcelona.,5,2015,11,23
37,PLEASANT LOW PROFILE STAY,"This will be my 200 review on Trip Advisor.

I have come to this hotel for many years-- rooms-service--special occasions vary.

Our Junior suite  was pleasant on the 9th floor with great views--housekeeping was excellent. Coffee-Tea making facilities available in room.

Breakfast was standard buffet--nothing special--a greater variety of fruit especially KIWI -daily - is required.

We were on a 4 night stay to celebrate my birthday and i was very surprised as a  LIFETIME PLATINUM guest  --nothing came to the room even though Starwood had a note of the occasion.  Human error..

It was either forgotten or went to another room.

Salvatore in reception is dealing with the issue.

We had the special tasting  dinner on the last night which was really good --however a choice would have been welcome. House wine was acceptable in quality.

The hotel is very centrally located on the Ramblas--and sleep quality is so good even though we were right in the centre.  .",4,2015,11,23
37,Just fabulous,"My friend and I decided to fly to Barcelona for a week and of course, we stayed at the Le Meridien.  I have been to this beautiful city 4 times and stayed at the Le Meridien on three of those times.  What I like about it is the location and how friendly, knowledgeable and helpful that staff are.  Not to mention the cleanliness and the convenience of this hotel.  I got the chance to meet the FB manager and other managers who gave me good restaurant recommendations and included me in their new cocktail tasting.  These things, among others, always make me want to come back again and again.",5,2015,11,21
37,Perfect location,"Right in the heart of La Rambles!  The staff was super nice, and the concierge was helpful in our accommodation needs.  We enjoyed our adjoining rooms which made for a spacious stay.  The showers were luxurious and nice after long days in Barcelona. 

Our rooms were not ready at 3 pm, and we had let the hotel know we would be arriving early ... they asked us to come back by 3 pm, and we still has to wait before 1 of our 2 rooms were available.  Also we had noted we needed a rolling bed, but our room couldn't actually fit one ... so our son had to sleep in the need with us. 
",4,2015,11,19
37,"Great location, great bed, great service","They say that a bunch of the hotel was fairly recently renovated, maybe that's what caused the complaints, and it isn't a huge bargain.  But we arrived with a broken reservation and they just fixed it, Jose at the desk was fantastic and helpful, and the bed was luxurious, and the WIFI worked.  The bar was polite to my overly noisy friends and a good time was had by all.",5,2015,11,17
37,Three night ins Barcelona,"Well appointed, nice, small spa, excellent concierge service  - they use texting for room service and it works extraordinarily well! the location puts you right in the middle of the action.  we felt at home the moment we walked in the door!",5,2015,11,17
37,"Not a luxury hotel, nice business persons hotel","The rooms are nice but not luxurious.  The lobby is alright but not particularly inviting.  The reception desk was busy with lots of business people checking in and out.

The bathrooms are fine but the shower door is very small and we got water all over the bathroom.",4,2015,11,15
37,Thoroughly Satisfied,"We were completely satisfied with our stay at the Le Meridien Barcelona.  The hotel is in the ideal location and was very clean and modern. We had a beautiful view of Las Ramblas and enjoyed friendly staff and a complimentary bottle of wine in celebration of our anniversary.  All in all we highly recommend a night or two here pre-cruise or during your stay in Barcelona.

Also note we looked at 5* hotels near the beach but we were very happy we went with a hotel near Las Ramblas",5,2015,11,13
37,Convenient to touristy attractions,"Giving ""very good"" only due to Le Meridien being SPG property and our long lasting relationship with SPG. Frankly nothing exceptional. Worn out place in need of some renovations. If you want to stay next to Las Ramblas - absolutely. This is your place. But if you expect any sort of luxurious accommodations look somewhere else.  Personal is very good and accommodating but next time I am staying in Mandarin Oriental.",4,2015,11,11
37,Barcelona overnight. Pre cruise ,"Stayed at this property on the 26th of October. Excellent location! Nice size room, spacious, lots of closet space, and large bathroom based on European standards. Hotel has an on site bar and restaurant. Front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. Check out was rather busy in the AM so give yourself plenty of time. I highly recommend this hotel it's worth it! Close to everything and within walking distance. La Rambla is just outside, but amazingly the hotel is quiet.",5,2015,11,11
37,Great one!,"+ perfect located at las ramblas
+ nice employees
+ big rooms with fantastic shower
+ excellent service
+ quiet rooms despite being in the heart of Barcelona

I enjoyed this hotel very much and it was perfect for a weekend business trip. Therefore I can fully recommend this hotel!",5,2015,11,11
37,Solid 4.0,"This is a solid, good value, 4-start hotel.   It is not a legendary, destination hotel, for which I give 5-stars.   

In that context, and at this price point, there is a lot to like and I would recommend it for both business and personal travel to this lovely, historic, vibrant city.

Our room (345) was especially nice, a little larger than average.  The hotel is very well situated, carefully maintained, modern, airy and scrupulously clean.   The staff try hard to please.  For example, three days prior to our arrival the concierge reached out to me by email to ask about our plans and to offer to get things started in we needed her help.  When we arrived she introduced herself and was quite helpful.  This proactivity is very unusual and welcome at the reasonable/value price point of a Le Meridien.

The location is very convent if you want to be in the Rumbles, near the markets, and walking distance to the scenic harbor.  There is a Metro stop very close to the hotel.  The University is walking distance away.  The complementary WiFi (for Starwood SPG guests) is very reliable and adequately fast.

However, the hotel restaurant is just average.  The climate control is not quite perfect.  The beds and furnishings, while comfortable and well maintained, are not 5 stars.   As I said at the opening, a solid 4.0.",4,2015,11,11
37,"Great location,staff.","We stayed on the fifth floor, around the corner from la Ramblas. Room was quiet and clean. Staff at this hotel very professional and helpful, all that I met spoke English well.  The location is the best, close to the market and buses. Meals and drinks were expensive in the hotel, but with so many choices nearby, not an issue.",5,2015,11,08
37,Tucked into a corner of Las Rambles,"Nit hotel with a terrific location. It is a little pricey but the rooms are small and a little cramped. Beds are comfy and we had a really nice bath with slate walls and floors. The service from the from door. To housekeeping, to the restaurant and bar was great. Wonderful views of Las Ramblas from the restaurant. Great base to wander the entire area.",4,2015,11,08
37,Great stay on the las ramblas,"Final night in Barcelona, so we wanted to be pampered and be close to las ramblas.  Great location, wonderful staff and a large comfortable room.  We stayed on points, and it was a great deal.  Plus, you are a short walk from barri gotic and the seaport.  It is not authentic Barcelona, but five star.",5,2015,11,06
37,Friendly staff with a great location,"We enjoyed very much our recent stay at Le Meridien.  We arrived early after our overnight flight and we created by Anna, a guest services person, whose energy and enthusiasm set the tone for the whole of our stay.  Despite our early arrival, we were lucky to find our rooms ready.  Our rooms were nicely sized and decorated in a modern style typical of the chain.  They were clean and comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and plentiful.  I would also like to commend Bruno, the concierge, who was helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations.  I would return to the hotel on my next visit.",5,2015,11,05
37,Real good experience,"Perfect location in la Rambla, walking distance from nice shopping area, food and places to go out in the evening. 

People there are very nice and you will feel they are really willing to make your stay a good experience.

Breakfast buffet is great, and the breakfast room is comfortable.

Clean and comfortable rooms. No noise from the street even though it is on La Rambla.

Will go again for sure.",5,2015,11,05
37,Great hotel!,"This hotel really goes out of its way to make sure you have a good stay. If you arrive before your room is ready - they offer you a shower in their spa. I had one of the best massages there. We also had a problem with our sink (turned out it was just that we didn't know how to drain it), but they sent someone up to fix it immediately. The room and bathroom was very large. Very centrally located. Highly recommend!",5,2015,11,04
37,Wonderful Stay,This hotel is perfect. Very well situated and comfortable. We stayed there after a week long cruise. Service was exceptional.  Room accomadated our every need.  Highly recommend this hotel for those looking for an upscale setting in the heart of the city.,4,2015,10,31
37,Great location and comfortable room,"I'm surprised that many others didn't enjoy this hotel.  It's in a prime tourist location in the midst of Las Ramblas, very near to the Liceu metro stop, with many restaurants nearby.  Although we were sad to be unable to check in until the official time, once we got into our room, we found it more spacious and nicer than expected.  The bed was very comfortable, and the room was quiet.  It had a very nice bathroom with a luxurious bath/shower.  The property seemed very renovated and up-to-date.  Highly recommended, particularly if you are a Starwood member.",5,2015,10,25
37,"Wonderful location, large rooms, lovely stay","We have stayed at the Le Meridien a number of times and have booked a room with them for our next visit to Barcelona, too. The location is perfect for walking on La Rambla, shopping, eating, or just people-watching. Staff is welcoming and service is professional yet warm. Hotel is spotless and even the standard rooms larger then most European hotel rooms. Hotel bar and restaurant worth a visit and the sangria served in the bar is the best I have had. We are Starwood Hotel Members (free to join) which gives us free Wifi, late checkout, free cocktails, etc. In addition to the restaurant and bar, with windows onto two streets, there is a coffee bar off the lobby and a large grocery store just doors away.  Pick up a bottle of enjoyable but inexpensive Spanish wine, deli meats and fresh bread for a picnic lunch or snack. Looking forward to our next visit.",4,2015,10,24
37,Stayed here for 4 nights during work trip,"Nice hotel and super close to awesome parts of the city off Ramblas! The rooms are way over priced for the room type and service that you receive , however I did enjoy my stay. The bar has slow service and is overpriced, there are lots of other spots around that are much better.  Over all I would rec based on location, staff appeared friendly but I would look for a lower priced hotel in the same area next time.",5,2015,10,23
37,Great Hotel perfect location,"We stayed at Le Meridien for 3 nights, the best part is the hotel located on Las Ramblas, the hotel room were clean well maintained, we received a bottle of cava and fruit plate, hotel services was excellent , breakfast was very good.. we have trouble with shower hose that was cracked, reported to front desk and we went out to dinner when we got back the shower hose was replaced... overall we would stay at this hotel again when we visit Barcelona again..",5,2015,10,22
37,Great experience att Le Meridien Barcelon,Staff was exceptionally helpful and very professional.  Everyone spoke english well (not surprising since its a Meridien - vast majority of guests were American).  Concierge was superb with suggestions and arranging private tours of Sagrada Familia and other Gaudi sites.  Bar in the hotel was great and the bartender made the perfect drink!,5,2015,10,22
37,Great hotel and location,"We stayed here as part of an AMA Waterways package.  Very good hotel, right off Las Ramblad.  Good room, good wi-fi, great breakfast and great location. Would stay here again.  We arrived late after a long day traveling from France.  Went to a little tapas restaurant across the street and enjoyed a nice meal outside.",5,2015,10,21
37,Good location,"This is a very small hotel but given the location it is what it is.  The room is big by most European standard but small comparing to some other nice hotels in Europe.  The main advantage is that is it right on La Rambla so it is very convenient.  The bathroom does not appear to have good ventilation as it has a funky smell, also the TV remote did not work but we did not bother to complain as we were just staying for 2 nights before going home after a cruise.",4,2015,10,19
37,Great location in toen,The service was great and the location is in the best area for walking and shopping. The hotel was overloaded with people going on cruises and not the crowd who are independent travelers who don't need tour guides.  I was disappointed that being a gold SPG member they didn't make the effort to extend my stay as they said they were fully booked but I won't lower my revue because of that. The room is nicely decorated but not exceptional and room service had the room spotless.,5,2015,10,18
37,Superb hotel in excellent location,"Big room, comfortable bed, excellent bathroom (which included tv-in-mirror), fast internet, comfortable working desk with US and European plugs, nice breakfast, friendly staff and it's right around the corner from Playa Catalunya.",5,2015,10,17
37,"Good location, great service","6 of frequently travel Europe together in a 9 passenger van. While entering Barcelona, we had a flat tire.  After making all the necessary calls to have it fixed, we called Le Meridien to find out if they could send a car to pick up the girls & luggage.  Not only did they get to us quickly, but Bruno, the concierge,went above & beyond to help us with the language barrier and to get repair done quickly.  Also, Ana, PR mgr was very helpful to us.

Great staff at this hotel with a good location",4,2015,10,16
37,Very good located hotel,"Like this hotel and location on the Ramblas. Personel very helpfull, fantastic breakfeast. Rooms very clean. Dinner was great. We will  come back soon. Easy now with plane from Ostend to Barcelona. We recomand it very much.",5,2015,10,15
37,Great location!,"We stayed here for a weekend in August and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was a bit small, but in this area of Barcelona, that's to be expected. The room was quiet. The shower had good water pressure. When my in-room safe did not work, maintenance staff came up to fix it within 10 minutes. The fitness center is small, but usable. The location is perfect for exploring Barcelona. The coffee bar in the lobby has good coffee and tasty pastries. I would happily stay here again.",4,2015,10,15
37,"Great hotel,  great location! ","We stayed here for a week and it was perfect!  Nice room,  modern and clean. The front desk was friendly upon check in. The concierge service was top notch,  right down to recommendation for restaurants and Le Merce festival information. Location was ideal for walking distance to Gothic area, which was our favorite. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,10,15
37,Very Good Hotel and Fantastic Location,"Recently stayed with my family for several nights at Le Meridien Barcelona and I was very impressed.

We had a family suite and it was quite spacious with a King bed in one room and a fold out sofa bed in the other room.

We stayed on the 9th floor and had a great view.

The room suite was very nice with modern decor and a spacious bathroom.

The staff was very friendly. The door men were quick to assist with our bags and the concierge was very helpful.

The check out time is noon which is later than many hotels and with SPG status they are very willing to provide late checkout. The problem that this creates is that many guests arriving from North America can't get into a room until late afternoon.

This is however par for the course if you travel to Europe and its not reasonable to expect that you can arrive in the morning and automatically get checked in so best to plan to drop your bags and go explore for a few hours.

Barcelona is a great city to walk and this hotel is situated right on Las Rambles not far from the Plaza Catalunya.

The bar in the hotel was very nice and the girl tending bar the night we went made the best Old Fashion ever. She was great and took amazing care to produce perfect cocktails including non-alcoholic versions for the kids.

We really enjoyed the our stay in this great city and Le Meridian played a big part in our enjoying everything Barcelona has to offer.",5,2015,10,14
37,Not sure how it has scored so well...,"For a 5 star I was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel. We had to change rooms when we arrived as we had smokers in the room next door. The bed was 2 singles pushed together and the bathroom was hardly clean. In the second room, there was a strong damp smell. We were told to wait outside the room at 5.30pm while they cleaned it - rude much? We were disturbed 15 minutes later by another member of staff who just let themselves into our room without knocking. However, the location was good and the room size was generous.",2,2015,10,14
37,About as expected,"Recently spent 4 nights here on the front and back end of a trip to Northeast Spain. This hotel is good not great.  The location, right on La Rambla, is great access to most of the central sights of Barcelona.  The rooms are average and thus the 3 star review.  Everything was clean, but I found the noise level more than average in the rooms, despite the fact that the rooms faced away from the La Rambla.",3,2015,10,13
37,Great location,"The best part of this hotel is the location near Las Ramblas. You are so close yet you don't hear the loud nightlife. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. But I would say they are on the smaller side. The hotel is modern and consistent with the Le Meriden brand. 
The restaurant food isn't really great. Breakfast was a buffet so it was a bit on the cold side.  But there are so many better options in town for food. There is a little bistro across the street for breakfast. There are several outdoor eating areas for wine and tapas all over the city. 
The concierge at the hotel is very knowledgeable and helpful with suggestions on what to do on which day and can get tickets easily for all the tourist attractions. 
Overall a very good hotel with location as its greatest feature.",4,2015,10,13
37,Convenient Location,"Location is ideal for walking in any direction to explore Barcelona. Rooms have a standard business decor. We appreciated in room tea and coffee. Rooms were clean and overall property was well maintained. Breakfast buffet and service were good.
What the hotel lacks in charm and character, it provides all the necessities for a comfortable place to rest after a long day of walking.",4,2015,10,12
37,Best location ever,"Hi,
We have been in this hotel for our honeymoon during August,
The service was just perfect, the location is very convenient: it is on La Rambla close to Metro station as well as Aerobus.
Thanks for the team for the upgrade, my only feedback is that we were offered Champagne although we don t drink Alcohol when we asked for it to be changed to fruits they braught us a small glass with a fruit salad, i found this cheap for a 5 star hotel.
We experienced a small issue on check in time as the receptionnist pre authorized our card even though we told him to chare the whole stay without pre authorizing...

The room service was quick and the food was tasty.

Thank you for making our stay memorable.

37,Lousy Excuse for 5 Stars...or 4 Stars....Even 3,"My wife and I stayed in a Suite at Le Meridien Barcelona as we excitedly kicked off a Europe vacation.  When we arrived in our Suite, we quickly discovered that very few things worked correctly.  A couple of examples:

1)  There was no hot water.  Five star hotel....Suite....no hot water.  I'm not joking.  We called maintenance to have someone check it out, and no one came.  We called again, and finally a maintenance guy came and tinkered with the plumbing.  When he left, we had sporadic hot water that unpredictably fluctuated between hot and cold.

2)  The television in the bedroom was broken.  We called maintenance for someone to come fix it, and no one came.  We called again about 20 minutes later, and again no one came.  We called a third time after another half hour or so had passed, and were told ""the guy who works on TVs is in another room.""  No one ever showed up to fix the TV.

Think twice before booking with this hotel.  If you want a legitimate nice hotel in Barcelona, then there must be other options.  The W looked really nice from a distance.",1,2015,10,11
37,Beautiful centrally located hotel,"Though there wasn't much of a view.  But by the time we got done walking all over Barcelona, who's looking at the view?  The hotel is right in the middle of La Rambla, thus making it a perfect location.  Walking distance to La Sagrada Familia and also the train station (where you go for the train to Montserrat).  Also very near the Gothic quarter, the Cathedral, and many, many churches.  We found a Disney Store and a lace maker within a couple blocks.  One of the features I like the best is that there was a grocery store around the corner, with reasonable prices, and cooked food to order.  We could just get our food, walk around the corner to the hotel, and eat al fresco in the room.",5,2015,10,09
37,The way all hotel should be,"this was one of these hotels you hate to leave. but when a suitcase is designated as laundry is full, its time to go home.
We came from Palma, and Ibiza, and This hotel is just what the doctor ordered, large rooms outstanding staff from the doorman to the hotel manager, they all were there to help  and give advise if,, you ask for. the rooms were large and comfortable the balcony was large and perfect for morning coffee. the beds are very comfortable and great AC.
the bkfs is plenty of everything and good attentive staff.

LOCATION, could not have been better",5,2015,10,08
37,"Great location on La Rambla, excellent staff and sevice","We stayed for an anniversary trip, and I was hoping to use some of my SPG platinum suite night awards that I had been saving.  I think they were fully booked during our stay, so we were appointed with a standard room.  Initially, I was disappointed, but really it wasn't a big deal, since we were in our room so little during our stay.  The room was clean and large by European standards, with a fully opening window to the street.  The rainfall shower was nice as well.  
We arrived around 9:00am from an overnight flight, and planned to drop off luggage and do a little sightseeing / eat lunch until our room was ready.  The front desk arranged to call us when it was ready, which was much earlier than we expected, to our delight.  
The platinum breakfast benefit is an excellent amenity choice.  The breakfast spread is varied each day with hot and cold items and some healthy choices so you can splurge later on some tapas.  Another Le Meridien benefit is the UNLOCK art program (I may have the name wrong.) You can visit MACBA, which is a contemporary art museum less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel when you present the card provided by the hotel.  We had a lovely visit, and very much appreciated  the opportunity.
We visited the concierge, and the gentleman helped us to find a couple restaurants that weren't on La Ramblas proper, but in neighboring districts that had less of a touristy vibe.  We enjoyed El Pintor, although the menu was all English, for a reasonably priced dinner in an historic building, as well as Bar Pinoxto (in the Market), which didn't have a menu at all.  If you are looking for a pre-dinner apertif, do yourself a favor and stop at the supermarket next door to the hotel, Carrefour, and pick up a couple bottles of Cava and vino tinto to enjoy in your room.  The selection of reasonably priced Spanish wines is really amazing, and don't be scared away by the low prices- the wines still taste great!  They also carry Kinder Eggs for my American friends who want to bring something small back for the kiddos.",4,2015,10,08
37,Nice hotel on Las Ramblas----great location,Reserve a suite and you will love life. Great Ramblas view from the huge windows. The WC and a separate dressing room / closet is deluxe. The price is reasonable and they even negotiated a better price for a suite.,4,2015,10,07
37,"Great location, good stay!","Good location of this hotel makes it a perfect go stay !
The rooms are small though, but have wonderful options for food and shopping near the hotel.
The staff and service is commendable.
Very convenient hotel, would love to stay in next visit too.",5,2015,10,06
37,Disappointing hotel/ Great location,"As a lifetime platinum SPG member I expected better room. Given standard European room with no balcony. 

SPA is not staffed full time. Spoke to someone in spa 5 times before they could schedule. No amenities in spa. No heated massage table. 

Location great near shopping, flamenco show, tours, restaurants. Starbucks across the street. 

Breakfast in Resturant is really great. Pastries, omelettes, fresh cut fruit, hot and cold assortments. Overlooks shopping area. ",1,2015,10,04
37,Nice hotel and great area,"the hotel is really neat with very friendly staff. The quietness of the corridors and the insulation of the rooms is great (I was on the third floor). The restaurant for breakfast was excellent. The most amazing thing is its location which is in the center La Rambla; no need to take any kind of transportation; everything is close and within a few meters walk. Plaza Catalunia, where the Barcelona Bus touristic stops is just a few minutes away walking. 

Great hotel, clean rooms, and very friendly staff",4,2015,10,02
37,Great location and service! ,"We were really happy with our experience at Le Meridien in Barcelona. The hotel is lovely as is everyone who works there. You cannot beat this location, right in the middle of Las Ramblas (the biggest touristy street in the city). Even with the busy street below, our first-floor room was still very quiet and private. ",5,2015,10,01
37,Excellent Location,"We loved the location of this hotel. It is located in the middle of the old town on La Rambla which is a perfect place to be. It was easy to walk to the harbor or to one of the locations for the Hop On Hop Off bus. The service at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. They even gave us our room early as requested. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also very nice and large. The beds were very comfortable and even though we were facing the street, it was not noisy at all. We were very happy with this hotel and would highly recommend it if you are planning a trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,09,30
37,Stay in Barcelona,Excellent location just off the rambla in the old city of Barcelona.  Very nice room excellent bathroom. And comfortable beds. Very quiet.  Breakfast was first rate and the staff was very professional.  Easy to recommend,4,2015,09,28
37,"Great location, standard hotel","The best part of this hotel is the location - right off La Rambla, you can easily wander Barrio Gotic or walk almost anywhere in the city. The service is excellent. They have me a room overlooking La Rambla first, which was too loud for me, so they immediately moved me. The hotel itself is pretty standard - feels like you could be at any Le Meridien worldwide. The walls are a bit throb, I could hear people sneezing in the next room and children screaming. It's good if you are looking for the same standard of quality you'd get anywhere - but not much atmosphere. However, I'm grateful for the excellent service, and had a good nights sleep. ",4,2015,09,25
37,Exceptional!!,"I went to Spain to visit my family and decided we would spend the night in Barcelona to be able to arrive at the airport without any traffic worries. We stayed at the Le Meridien on the Rambla in Barcelona. The location was perfect right in the middle of all the action but the best part was the service. I was personally greeted by the Publicity Manager Ana Miquel de la Llave as I am a Starwood Platinum Pro and she even walked me to my room to make sure I was happy with my room and I was I had been double upgraded to one of the best rooms in the hotel. While my room was incredible right on the Rambla the service was exceptional the amenities in the bathroom I was even gives an Hermes cologne, the bedding and bed were so comfortable the whole stay was fantastic. There are a lot of new hotel in the area but this would be the best choice in the area when visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,09,24
37,Great location and overall,"I was here on vacation.  The location can't be beat!  the hotel is very clean, the service is very friendly and all round we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and I would stay again at this hotel if I was to return to Barcelona.",4,2015,09,24
37,Heart of Barcelona hotel.  Exceptional staff in an ideal location,"Love this Barcelona SPG hotel and in particular any suite on floors above the 5th floor.  Best parts of Le Meridien Barcelona Hotel are the attentive staff (they were prompt and courteous when I made a request) and its city center, Las Ramblas location.  Another bonus are the two wonderful restaurants directly across the street:  Luzia and Bar Lobo.  Be sure to book as far in advance as possible because this hotel often runs at full capacity (sells out) due to cruise ship lines that offer their passengers this hotel as a stop-over add-on.  

My plan is to return soon to explore their ""Unlock Art"" amenity whereby guests are offered complimentary access to local art galleries (I didn't have enough time this trip as I stayed 4 nights & filled my itinerary w/ day trips to San Sebastian & Costa Brava, Spain).  This was my second visit and both times, I left with a positive impression of a comfortable and streamline Barcelona hotel worthy of a five (5) review.",5,2015,09,24
37,Location + Comfort + Friendly staff,"The hotel is in a convenient location. Walked to almost everything we wanted to see in our 3 day stay. Rooms are comfortable, spacious and tastefully decorated.  The bathroom was the best we had of the four hotels we stayed at on this trip to Spain and France.  Every encounter we had with the staff was friendly and helpful.  When I was a little confused on directions, the concierge actually walked us to the location. ",5,2015,09,23
37,Superb customer service!,"We satyed there only for one night and the welcoming was super nice. Joao gave us a warm welcome and he was very accommodating, polite and very professional. The rooms are very cozy. The location is perfect, it is at the heart of La Rambla. When we left, Cristina and Paula were very professional and always with a very sweet smile. These people really make you feel at home.",5,2015,09,23
37,Great location,"Great location, the rooms are compact. Have everything EXCEPT a pull out clothes line for daily washing.
Beds are good, 2 different showers heads, water is hot and there are plenty of towels.
One very annoying point is the constant rumble and light tremor of the trains of the Metro that travel below the hotel. At night it can be hard to sleep.
Breakfast just ok, nothing special.
Good supermarket just around the corner on La Rambla.",3,2015,09,23
37,"Great Location, Great Service, Great Room","The concierge Bruno was excellent.    He directed us to best sites on our road trip to Costa Brava.  Arranged our car rental   Highly recommend his services.
The Manager Salvadore was also very helpful.   We needed an addition night that was not reserved in advance & he worked his magic to find us a room plus sent us a bottle of wine to our room.  Excellent service from all the staff!!    Our room was comfortable.   Large shower & bathroom.    Comfortable bed.   Location on La Rambla right in the middle of everything.    Market around the corner & a great little restaurant around the corner.   Only complaint was the service from the dining room - we were totally ignored by wait staff.   Food was good but did not go back except for buffet breakfast.",4,2015,09,23
37,Centrally located hotel,"We just stayed there before getting on a cruise ship. It was right off the central part of town, and conveniently located right off the Ramblas. The rooms were a little on the small side, but clean and good service with a very good breakfast. Try to get this included in the room rate if possible. The WIFI was very good, and Starwood gold member the internet and late check out was available.
There is a market next door which makes it convenient for getting snacks or water.",4,2015,09,22
37,Below average Le Meridien,"I've stayed at Le Meridiens across the world...and this, by far is my least favorite. 
Pros: Location, location, location and the value of the room. 
Cons: Dark, bed wasn't comfortable and kind of loud.  
Overall service that we encountered was average.",3,2015,09,22
37,"Really nice, conviently located hotel with extremely helpful staff.","Our party had very nice rooms and all services in the hotel were excellent.  The location on the popular Las Ramblas made it possible to be near shops, restaurants and, of course, the crowds. The hotel is quite lovely and we found the staff to be quite helpful.",4,2015,09,22
37,Worst service ever / worst experience,"Small room very expensive (300e) with a wall 5m far from my windows. My credit card had a problem, and instead of being comprehensive (i stay every week in spg hotels, the room was booked by my society) they forced me to ask a friend to come on a Sunday night at 10pm to come and take 350e by cash for me so I can pay the room in advance...",1,2015,09,21
37,Modern hotel right in the thick of things at Barcelona,"This is a pretty decent Starwood property. The rooms are smaller than I'd like - but they're well fitted and furnished.

The hotel is right in the middle of Las Ramblas, which is a good thing, and a bad thing (super touristy area). The good thing about this is that the gothic quarter (old city) is very close, the beach is a 5 minute cab ride away, Sagrada Famila is also 2km away - so you're right in the center of things.

The buffet breakfast is awesome! We loved the buffet and attentive service. 

I thought the concierge was just ok - have had much better experiences where someone tried to engineer something great for us. 

SPG Platinum will get you very attentive service - but highly unlikely to get upgraded if you have a suite night award or something of that sort.",4,2015,09,17
37,Barcelona Hotel - High Recommendation,"This is a very nice centrally-located hotel situated only metres from the vibrant Las Ramblas and its markets, shops and night life. Barcelona  is a great city and deserves a stop-over of at least five days.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2015,09,15
37,Barcelona 2015,"Typical European hotel room with nice amenities & a great location.  Directly on Las Ramblas with easy walking distance to all quarters.  Very good local restaurants, shopping, & markets.  Very reasonable taxi service with good access to public transit.",3,2015,09,15
37,"Love, love the city, the hotel location and the app ""Chatamos""","This was our first visit to Barcelona and I am quite sure we will be back to that city and that hotel.  It is located right on La Rambla, and is somewhat car free.  Two blocks away is La Canete restaurant/bar (GREAT place to eat) and maybe three blocks away is the famous open air market La Boqueria where you can find anything that swims, slithers, walks or hops locally.

The staff at Le Meridien could not have been nicer, more welcoming or accommodating.  They introduced us to their app, ""Chatamos"" which functions as your private concierge, almost butler service at the hotel.  I pinged them in the morning that my blankets had been too heavy the night before and immediately they were at the door with the blanket combination I requested.  I had thought housekeeping would simply leave them in room as I'd asked, but they were so quick to please.

Another night we were watching a movie and requested double cognacs delivered to the room.  They were delivered immediately.  How great is that?

I did try ""chatamos"" at their other property at La Vendrell and it was not nearly as responsive, but that could very well be because it is a beach location and more relaxed.

I would very much like to return to Barcelona in a couple of years and see what progress has been made on La Sagrada Familia Church.

Great stay, great hotel, we will be back!",5,2015,09,15
37,Le Meridien Barclona,"We stayed here two separate nights. Once before and once after our cruise. The first night was on the second floor. We had a king bed. We slept with the windows opened. That was a mistake. I did not sleep much at all that night because of all the noise that went on all night. Very loud. Location is right next to La Ramba. That is good for day but not at night if your on the second floor with windows opened. My brother has a room on the second floor too but further down the hall. They had not problem with noise. 
When we returned from out cruise we were on the third floor further down from all the night noise. Room was much quieter. Hotel is very nice. Everyone is helpful. I would stay here again. I just know what to ask for.",4,2015,09,13
37,Very nice hotel,"We traveled to Barcelona for a short week-end stay to sightsee before a cruise planned for Sunday. The room was very nice, clean but no view. We were out most of the time so it didn"" really matter. The breakfast was very good and a good selection of things to eat. Overall a nice experience, and good location close to La Ramblas.",4,2015,09,08
37,located in very good area all major attraction in walking distance,"Check in process was very easy. Room was good clean with all the amenities, good comfortable beds. Concierge was very helpful booking various tours. Front desk was helpful as well. Definitely will stay again if in Barcelona again.",4,2015,09,07
37,Excellent staff and service,"As a platinum member of SPG I have seen many hotels, but this was the best service I have ever received. The room upgrade was beautiful, the staff was friendly and I felt personally welcomed.

The room was amazing and felt like a home to me. Not the usual white sterile environment, but dark, warm colors and lots of wood (with a view on La Rambla)",5,2015,09,04
37,Beautiful Barcelona!,"This is a beautiful, modern hotel located adjacent to Las Ramblas and in a very convenient location.  It is not a large hotel, so bar/coffee area is pretty small.  The Spa area is super-tiny, so very atypical.  The rooms, however, are nice size, with comfortable beds. If you can get the junior suite, do it!  The highlight of this room is the walkout terrace. There are lounge chairs, plus a great sitting area. We sat on the couch under the stars, drinking our wine, eating popcorn and girl talk! The hotel is so conveniently located to all the main sights, shopping and restaurants.  We really enjoyed our stay.",4,2015,09,03
37,Right hotel to stay in summers,"I had an excellent weekend in this hotel, located at the Ramblas, walking from great nightlife, and several tourist attractions. The concierge is very friendly and helpful. They have a running track laid out that i would highly recommend, as it covers several good views.",5,2015,09,03
37,Wonderful and right in the heart of the City,"After 11 day cruise we elected to spend three additional days to visit the city !
We hired a private car to take us all around and to some of the major attractions.
The City is alive with many fine restaurants and for the ladies shopping!

This hotel staff was over the top when it came to service and they were eager to do anything or there guests.",5,2015,09,01
37,Great location! ,"Very nice hotel with a wonderful location in Las Ramblas. The lovely tree-lined walking area has all sorts of interesting keosks and a large market with all foods imaginable. Tour buses  (hop on hop off) are a short walk away. 
We were pleased with the food in the hotel restaurant and the prices were fair.
But the main advantage is the location. I will stay there again. ",4,2015,09,01
37,Turned lemons into lemonchello!,"Our flight was cancelled - and so amidst all the travel headaches and re-scheduling the staff at Le Meridien were helpful, kind and simply brilliant.  They went above and beyond to help us get two gorgeous rooms.  They provided excellent restaurant recommendations and made sure every detail of our stay was perfect.  Thank you Danielle and the great team at the front desk.

The location here is fabulous - right on Las Ramblas.  Close to fabulous restaurants and walkable to all the great sites of Barcelona.

We look forward to returning and spending more time with the staff at Le Meridien.  Excellent place.",5,2015,08,31
37,roger1278,"We are starting out Tauck tour of  the Paradors of Northern Spain here in Barcelona & the allocated Hotel is Le Meridien on Las Ramblas. With our extra night we are staying 3 nights. From our arrival & the warm greeting the friendly staff are great.We are extremely pleased with the room.The room space is generous with 2 king size beds.Bathroom is modern but needs some attention to the stained base.Breakfast is buffet style with good choice. The gym is adequate.WIFI is offered complimentary however we would like to see a Nespresso pod machine in the room.Located on Las Ramblas near the Boqueria market (Mercat de Sant Josep) the Hotel is perfectly placed for access to the Old town & many attractions,shopping&restaurants in this area. A very good place to stay.",4,2015,08,30
37,Wonderful stay at Le Meridien Barcelona!!,We had a wonderful 5 day stay at Le Meridien Barcelona.  The location can't be beat - it's right off of the world famous Las Ramblas and within walking distance to so many attractions.  Service was outstanding.  Would highly recommend staying here when in Barcelona and look forward to a future stay on my next visit to Barcelona.,5,2015,08,27
37,Excellent service in a great location!,"This hotel is one of the best locations if you really want to be in the middle of the action on the Las Ramblas. But even better than the location is the fantastic staff and their excellent service. This hotel is extremely busy but the staff always made us feel special. My wife had a brief sick spell and the hotel kitchen cooked her special food and staff even offered to go shopping for us if we needed anything. I wish I could remember everyone's name but I would like to give a special shout out to Marius, Bruno, and Tanka (spelling?). We would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,08,26
37,Barcelona hotel,This hotel is very well situated.  The rooms are comfortable and clean but housekeeping seems to happen very late in the day (after 4pm). The dining room staff are helpful and friendly but be careful thst you read the small print on the menu or the meal might cost more than you expect. The food is good.,3,2015,08,26
37,I would give it a 6/5 if I could!,"Wow! Le Meridien Barcelona blew me away, from the exceptional service and location to the beautiful room, this hotel is amazing. 

Check in: We arrived in the evening and our deluxe room was ready. The check in line was very short and the person checking us in was very helpful in explaining everything about the property to us. We told her about some of the activities we had planned while in Barcelona, and she provided a map and explanation of how to get to these places. Excellent customer service in my books! 

Room: We had a deluxe room on the 5th floor. It was very quiet and you wouldn't know that you're staying on such a busy street in Barcelona. The room was very spacious and had great amenities. It has lots of room for your clothing and suitcases. I loved the turn down service in the evenings/night. On the first night, the maids left us a couple welcome gifts, which was a nice touch. The bed was amazingly comfortable; not too firm and not too soft. The toiletries in the bathroom were of a high quality and they provided a shower cap as well. I forgot my power adapter at home, so I called down for one and was able to borrow the hotel's thankfully. 

Property: This hotel is very centrally located to many shops, markets and public transit in Barcelona. The hotel does not have a pool or salon, but does have a spa and gym. There's also a cocktail bar and restaurant on site. We had many delicious buffet style breakfasts while staying at Le Meridien. The selection is phenomenal; fresh fruit, eggs, bread, churros, Spanish dishes and an omelette station as well. We had drinks in the Le Pop cocktail lounge one evening and we had very good service and drinks. I did not find the cocktail lounge or the restaurant to be too crowded during our stay. 

Overall, I had one of my best ever hotel stays at the Le Meridien Barcelona. I definitely recommend this hotel if you like luxury and being centrally located. I cannot wait to return on future trips to Barcelona!",5,2015,08,25
37,Good location but nothing more - disgraceful service - never again!,"We will never stay in a Le Meriedien again after the poor service we received in Barcelona and their 'dont care' attitude and general lack of service and passing us off between staff. 

We booked in March for our 3 nights in July.  In the booking under special requests we advised I advised I am a light sleeper and please do not put me near the lifts.  Where do they put me? 2 doors away from the lift.  We then ask later that night after having an afternoon siesta to move rooms.  We are told all the cleaning staff have gone home so we need to stay in that room and move in the morning.  So because their staff didn't read the booking ahead of time, we were inconvenienced.  Poor form!  Not only that they offered us ear plugs to sleep, really!! and told us that we need to give them more notice - we booked 4 months in advance!!

The attitudes of the staff we had to deal with really putt a sour note on our arrival into Barcelona for the first time.  We also put in our special request for an early check in as we had arrived from Australia and got to the hotel around 10am.  We do realise that these special requests cannot always be guaranteed however it was the laziness and don't care attitudes of the staff again that really got our backs up and they were not even willing to try help us - lazy!.  The guy behind the counter when we arrived tried to put the charm on asking us if first time to Barcelona, would we like a map etc ( which he never ever gave to us) then he planted the seed of we cannot check into our room.  I asked how long and he said we need to clean then a supervisor needs to check it.  I said we had a tour at 3pm he said we will have you in way before then, so we proceed to the cafe to have a coffee while we wait.  3 hours passed and I went up and asked him how much longer and he said we are cleaning it and the supervisor needs to check it.  Second attempt to ask him delivered the same response, third time we couldn't stand his brush off attitude so held our ground and all of a sudden a room was ready, this was after 4 hours of waiting and wasting our first day in Barcelona.  Poor form Le Meriedien Barcelona.

We tried to check out and they told us that we would lose all our money as we were fully pre-paid, yep they then also hold you as a captive audience, sounds like they are professionals at this.

This hotel is very noisy and generally not a nice place.  When we arrived in the foyer which is very small and almost no where to sit.  we went to the coffee shop and sat there.  It was not a comfortable environment, about 4 or 5 loud American people were sitting at the long table doing business.  When they finished they left on scooters so didn't even appear they were staying at the hotel, nor consuming anything from the cafe as the lady bought her own thermos.

The bedrooms are very noisy, the first room we had, had a large free standing shower and the second room we had to climb into the bath to have a shower.  The rain shower heads are good. We did not get bottle water every day.  We asked for firm pillows, no such thing as firm, we asked to exchange AUD they do not exchange AUD, they have an in room bar fridge system whereby if you remove their drinks to put your own in it bills the drink to your room, so check your bill against what you really consumed.  There is a little personal space in there but not big enough, both rooms when you turn the lights on have a buzz in the room as soon as you switch the lights off the buzz goes.  You can hear the water running in the rooms adjoining you.  If your room faces the front of the hotel you hear noise from the streets, trucks, people partying etc..

I posted comments on their Facebook site and someone (they never put a name or position title to anything) responded to say 'they will consider moving us' and the office manager tried to contact you to discuss the possibility of moving rooms.  Not sure why all the commotion from the office manager as we had already been in contact with reception the night before and WE organised a room move, she did nothing to assist, just left me a note on a card.  This is the only hotel we have encountered worldwide where they don’t have a duty manager, only an office manager – hence the lack of professionalism.

Our taxi driver drove past the hotel on Las Ramblas as its actually around the corner off the main street.  Try the Luzia Street Grill restaurant across the road from the hotel, great food.

There are many more hotels in the La Ramblas area, chose a different hotel.  We are loyal SPG members but on this occasion not even that would bring us back to this hotel or chain again!",1,2015,08,24
37,A Gem of a Hotel,"For those of you who want to be centrally located, Le Meridien is a great hotel. It's entrance is located off Las Ramblas so you can avoid the busyness of the area to some degree. But just be prepared for the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas. This is my second stay to Le Meridien and the update they completed after my first stay is excellent. Views from the rooms on one side of the building are not the best, but the rooms themselves are quite comfortable and well appointed--great bathrooms. The hotel has a nice roof-top terrace. The staff is wonderful. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,08,24
37,"The Best Le Meridien  - Room, location, and staff!","I travel a lot for business and pleasure and have stayed at a lot of SPG properties.  This Le Meridien was by far the best of the Le Meridien chain.  My room was newly remodeled to exemplary standards and was very chic. The beds were soooo nice, especially after long days of hicking around town.  My 21year old daughter wants me to remodel her room to look like this one!  This hotel is right on the La Rambla and very close to Placa de Catalunya where you can get to the other parts of the city - shopping and sight seeing.  All hotels say they have great locations, but this one REALLY DOES!  The staff also helped us plan a few things to do in Portugal (several are native Portuguese).",5,2015,08,23
37,God location before a cruise,"Good location before or after taking a cruise. Rooms very nice, great bathrooms.  Restaurant was good and so was the bar. Very good location to walk to all the main tourist spots in Barcelona. We used Starwood points so we had free wifi.",4,2015,08,21
37,Awesome everything... ,"The staff at Le Meridian go out of their way for anything you may request.

We had the Mediterranean suite with huge walkout to a deck that had a table for 8 sun chairs and a great outdoor shower.

The doormen are by far the friendliest I've ever met and I travel a lot.

Location  location location... your on La Rambla what more is there to say.

Emily the GRAND staff truly do make you feel at home or in our case an amazing vacation.",5,2015,08,21
37,Our recent stay,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights as a couPle..locatiOn was fantastic , as handy Tao be able to walk everywhere. Hotel reception fine . Rooms very basic for a 5 star hotel, do not expect the same standard as we get in the UK. He biggest problem was breakfast. We had prepaid for this and did not even bother going down for it on th.e 3rd morning.
Food was cold, unappetising, and generally of a standard which you would expect from a 1star hotel. My advice would be to just stay on a room only basis. We did not eat in the hotel at any other time due to the breakfast being so poor . As somebody who worked in hotels in a previous life, I do wonder wh.y hotels struggle so much on providing a decent breakfast..loved Barcelona and would return but not to the meridian",3,2015,08,21
37,Le Meridien Barcelona shouldbe a 5 star hotel in barcelona!! Best  Location!!,"THe Hotel is located in the best spot in Barcelona!! Center of Ramblas!!
The Hotel Room was amazing!! Large Bed amazing Bathroom and spa style shower.. I would not expect such an great room in Barcelona knowing most hotel rooms are small in Barcelona.. Le Meridien Barcelona for the price we paid is a BARGAIN!! The hotel was so worth it on every level. The staff was wonderful as well.",5,2015,08,20
37,Awesome stay at LM BCN,"I am a platinum member of SPG and choosed LM BCN as hosting hotel for my vacationi, which has been proved to be a wise choose from many different perspective. 

The hotel has a very good location in city center with walking distance to shopping centers and attractions.  Meanwhile the hotel upgraded my room to a large suite which has fantastic view of Barcelona.  My room was very comfortable and cozy, with sufficient light in room.  Amenities in bathroom is also refreshing and pleasant to enjoy.  

The breakfast restaurant, has an excellent team.  Although the food variety is average level, not that much if you compare to Asia but enough to start the day.  The staff could remember my preference (cappuccino) on third morning and she served without asking, so impressed. 

The gym of hotel is a bit simple, with couple cardio machines and limited weight dumbbells.  Don't expect too much for gym.  No swimming pool.",5,2015,08,20
37,"Great location. Nice room, nice service (but expensive..)","We stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for 4 nights (August). It is a great hotel (modern), very nicely located close to all the major attractions. Location cannot be better. We had a familiy suite (4 people) and we enjoyed it. The bathroom was huge and great, Service is friendly and efficient. Frontdesk personel is nice and the concierge are helpful. 
On the minus side, price was expensive, there is no pool (however there is a spa). Parking is possible but this is Euros per day). Wifi was free and worked very well.
Overall, a nice hotel in a great location.",4,2015,08,19
37,Stay here.,Excellent place to stay !  We loved the location.  Easy to get the train from two close stations.  Very clean and modern hotel.  You can walk to the marina from here.  So many cafes for morning and afternoon coffee.,5,2015,08,18
37,"Great Location, Very Helpful Staff","We are a family of 5 with three older children - aged 16 to 22.   We recently spent 5 nights at Le Meridien in Barcelona.   We had 2 rooms.  The location really can't be beat - it's on Las Ramblas in the middle of everything.  It was walking distance to many Barcelona sights and restaurants.  

The staff of the hotel was extremely helpful.   We called ahead to tell them we were coming in early on the red eye from New York - and they did everything they could to get us into rooms early before the 3:00 pm check in.  They were very accommodating, even though they were fully booked the night before.   The consierges were also very helpful and informative.  

The hotel appears to have been renovated over time, and some rooms and floors are clearly better than others.  There is a roof deck with lovely views and a whirlpool sized cooling pool, but no full swimming pool, which would have been welcomed after sightseeing tours on 90 degree days.   We also had a problem with the air conditioning in one of the rooms, but the staff was again very accommodating and provided several alternative solutions.   

We didn't eat at the hotel, so we can't comment on the food.  They did provide ice upon request - and like in all other cases, they were prompt and eager to assist. 

All in all, a solid choice and we would go back again - particularly thanks to the ideal location,",4,2015,08,16
37,Magnificent Stay in a world class hotel,"My wife and I stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights at the Meridian and had a fabulous time. The rooms were excellent (incredibly impressive walk-in shower), wonderful front desk staff, and a perfect location right off of La Ramblas.",5,2015,08,16
37,Really nice all around and great compared to hotels nearby,"This place is located right on the La Ramblas, so the location is great. A short walk tot he beach and public transportation in nearby. While La Ramblas doesn't have the best food since it's pretty touristy, it does have a lot of variety. There's a supermarket less than a block away and the Mercat de Sant Josep/ La Boqueria is also very close.

The staff is also very friendly and accommodating, the rooms were clean, but nothing to ""write home about."" If you're an SPG platinum member you'll also get the buffet breakfast for free, which is pretty decent. 

I'd stay here again, if I was in the area.",4,2015,08,16
37,Ok,"Great location 
Busy hotel in central Barcelona 
Staff friendly and accommodating! 
Our room window looked out to a brick wall Unfortunately , but its Barcelona!!!!! 
Breakfast / bar etc all pretty ok 
............,.......................",3,2015,08,16
37,Business & pleasure!,Week of business meetings with a large group and the hotel performed well. Conference areas were convenient and meals were more than adequate. (Little bit slow but this is Barcelona!). Provided gluten-free and veggie options the entire week for dietary restrictions. WiFi was great and hassle free.  Staff was always friendly and attentive. Central location provides a launching pad for any activities in the town. Located directly on the Ramblas but the entrance is tucked down a side street for easier access. Would use this hotel again......,4,2015,08,15
37,Not worth the money,"We stayed there for four nights in May.  The hotel is definitely not up to Le Meridien standards.
On the plus side, the location is great (1/2 block off La Rambla) and the staff is pleasant (and very good at apologizing for the hotel's shortcomings).
Unfortunately, negatives abound:
At check in we were promised a large room overlooking La Rambla but were shown to a modest sized room looking over a narrow side street.
At 715 ion our first morning, we were awakened by water leaking from the ceiling.
On two afternoons, we returned to the room in late afternoon 1530-1645) to find the room not made up-particularly annoying in a culture that retains the siesta.
Worst of all was the bathroom.  It was small and cramped with a single sink and minimal counter space. The bathtub/shower unit had a rain shower head. Due to poor design, the glass wall that should have contained the shower only covered one third of the tub, and the shower head was beyond the wall, producing an unavoidable enormous flood with every shower.
I expect much more from Le Meridien.
Stay elsewhere.",2,2015,08,13
37,Great pet friendly hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"As a traveler that always travels with my pet, I am always on the look out for pet friendly hotels that also maintain a certain standard. Aside from satisfying that, this hotel is also very perfectly located. The rooms are a bit on the smaller side, but I really had no complaints. They also provided a bed and food bowl for my pooch, which also adds a nice touch. With very easy access to the subway, tour buses, La Boqueria, Shopping and the Port, you can't go wrong with this location. ",4,2015,08,13
37,Cool hotel on La Rambla,"If you want to stay in central Barcelona, this is the place!  It is on La Rambla the central most boulevard which cuts through the heart of the city center, minutes away from a million restaurants and on the edge of both the Gothic and Raval districts.  The hotel is modern,very clean, and convenient and to add to that, the breakfast is excellent (their bacon was the best I've ever had!).  It is also the only 5 star hotel on La Rambla.  Recommended!",5,2015,08,11
37,A great hotel in a fantastic location.,"The service and hospitality at Le Meridien Barcelona is excellent. From Marius at the front desk who welcomed us, gave us fantastic advise and assistance, to the porters, waiting staff and housemaid, the staff members are friendly, helpful and good at their jobs.
The hotel location on Las Ramblas and virtually next door to a great market and historic tourism spots is fantastic. We had a great time and will certainly return.",5,2015,08,11
37,Barca 2015,"Excellent location, good service, rooms were a bit small yet trendy, beds quite comfortable.. overall a very good experience. Location just off the Ramblas giving access to the heart of Barcelona with many sites, museums and shops within short walking distance.... One negative thing, it was quite hot and humid during visit, cant blame that on hotel :)",5,2015,08,11
37,Awesome,"Highly recommend this hotel. Very nice, spacious and modern rooms. Super friendly staff, and they all speak English. Free breakfast buffet included, very nice variety and all good food. Service was excellent, the concierges and the desk staff were excellent at making recommendations and reservations. Great location, only a few minutes walk to the Placa Catalun where you get get on the hop-on hop-off tour buses - which were a great way to get to know your way around. Excellent experience, highly recommend. Since you are right on La Rambla, higher floor is better as this is a bustling and noisy area. And you must always beware of pick-pockets. Lock your valuables and passport in the room safe.",5,2015,08,10
37,Not Great Value,I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and was rather unimpressed. The room was very small with the bed so close to the wall that my shins were black and blue from my 2 night stay as I had to walk sideways along the wall to get to the other side of the room. The concierge were not very helpful and every time I approached reception I was met with a long Que. There are many very good hotels along La Rambla that I could highly recommend instead of this one. Particularly for the price once can do so much better.,3,2015,08,05
37,WOW!,"Great location!   Very poor service!   Stay else where! Check in was a nightmare.  Booked four rooms, only one ready at 3:00 pm.  Ordered ice to the suite every day for four days...never delivered within 15 minutes as promised...even a 10 euro tip daily didn't help encourage the staff. Not even a 3 star hotel.",2,2015,08,05
37,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location and Amazing Bartender","The hotel was beautiful and well maintained. The location is ideal if you are wanting to be in the mix of things.  It is located in a centralized location that is extremely busy.  

The staff was always helpful and kind.  Mathias, the bartender, was Excellent.  He gave us advice of places to go off the beaten path.  Each day we would begin or end our evening with him.  He was genuine, funny and knowledgeable about the area.  He made me some unique and delicious cocktails.  

The only downside was that the business center was hard to navigate.

Also, there is a store just around the corner.  Exit out of the door and turn right.  When  you come to the first alley way, turn right and the store is shortly on the right.  We stopped daily for water, snacks, etc.  Very convenient",5,2015,08,04
37,Outstanding Hotel & Service,"We stayed here for the second time in 2 years and it did not disappoint!  The hotel is in a perfect location, the service is outstanding and the concierge helped us each and every day with hotels and sites to see.  You really couldn't ask for a better hotel and a better location.  I would recommend it for couples or families.",5,2015,08,04
37,Well located.,"We stayed there as part of a group tour. The location on the Main Street could not have been better. The room was well appointed and comfortable. The bathroom had a large shower with great water pressure, although as with most hotel bathrooms, not enough hanging hooks.
We were impressed with security. One of our keys wouldn't work and a staff member came to our room to see ID before he would supply another one.
We found it very inconvenient when our room wasn't serviced until late afternoon, when you need to get ready to go out for the evening.
Breakfast was ok. Staff were great but hot food was generally pretty cold.",4,2015,07,31
37,Le Meridien Barcelona-Honeymoon Stay,"Excellent hotel right in the heart of Barcelona. The hotel staff was as kind and welcoming as can be and even helped us celebrate with a bottle of champagne waiting in our room. Dinner at the hotel restaurant was as good as it gets and there is a great lounge (Le Pop) open every night to relax and have a few drinks. Excellent choice and should we ever be back in Barcelona, Le Meridien would be a great choice!",5,2015,07,31
37,4 star hotel at most,"Staying 2 nights at room 528 for 7/29-8/1, 2015. Paid 440 EUR per night totaling 880

Definitely not 5 star quality and  breakfast is more close to 3 star.  

I wanted to move to El Palace, but they say it is prepaid and no refund. 
If you find a price bargain of 4 star and you will get deserved service. 
",2,2015,07,30
37,Nice hotel is great location,"This is a very nice hotel along La Rambla.  The location is perfect for shopping and hopping on the Metro to get around.  The hotel is also close to may restaurants.  The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly and helpful.  The room itself was clean with a very nice bathroom.  The only con is that it does not have a swimming pool and is not a resort location.  The cost for the room was right and not overly expensive considering it is a LeMeridien.  

All in all we had a nice stay and would return.",5,2015,07,29
37,A pleasant stay in an unbeatable location where the action takes place!!,"Apart from being an international chain hotel, the greatest advantage of the hotel is its unbeatable location right on Las Ramblas in the middle of the hustle and bustle enjoying the convenience and excitement without sacrificing peace and tranquility. We stayed here in a deluxe room for 3 nights, which was decorated in a simple, chic style with vibrant colours, comfortable with an adequate bathroom with bathtub. shower head and handheld shower. Room was quiet; we were surprised that the street noise was minimal even on Friday and Saturday nights. Carrefour was just around the corner and La Boqueria is just a three-minute walk away. Breakfast buffet was good but not a wow with the usual hot and cold selections, the hot selection was quite basic. Coffee Americano was weak, so we had double espresso with milk instead; I liked the pain au choloat and the sparkling wine, Cava. Overall we had a pleasant stay Le Méridien Barcelona; best of all, we loved the fact that we could pop in and out of the hotel to drop our shopping bags at our room and go for dinner.",4,2015,07,29
37,Great family stay,"Le Meridien Barcelona was our first stop on a three-stop vacation and my daughters and I have used our stay to compare with the other hotels we've stayed out.  Le Meridien was definitely a great hotel.  The staff is friendly, the breakfast buffet was consistently terrific (also with a great restaurant staff), and the rooms were spacious - a nice surprise for Europe.  We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and would stay here again, should we have the good fortune to be back in BCN.",5,2015,07,29
37,Summer holidays ,"We just recently ended our European holidays in Barcelona .
As a Starwood platinum member, I travel quite extensively for work and spend over 100 nights a year in hotels. 
Our check in experience was flawless!! We were upgraded to an amazing suite and welcomed by  the General Manager.  The breakfast and lounge restaurant are amazing!! Definitely one of the highlights of this hotel. Traditional Spanish frittata, churros, delicious coffee & a beautiful assortment of pastries & fresh fruit kept us happy !!
The concierge team went above and beyond our expectations ..every team member was helpful and knowledgeable.  

Providing us with complementary tickets to the modern art museum, assistance purchasing Flamenco tickets, directions to local attractions and help finding train schedules..
The location of the hotel is amazing! Centrally located and in walking distance to everything you could want to visit while in Barcelona .. Definitely a great place to end our holidays. ",5,2015,07,28
37,"Great Location, friendly staff!","Located at the center of the city - right on the vibrant La Rambla. We walked down to almost all of the ""must visit"" places in Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and helped us plan our 3 days in the city. The only meal we had at the hotel was the breakfast - and what a spread :) Highly recommended!",4,2015,07,28
37,Excellent hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Really great experience overall at Le Méridien Barcelona. The staff were really friendly and smiled a lot. They made our stay superb. Service here really makes a big difference. The rooms were well appointed, modern with good amenities. Definitely sign up as a SPG member if you are not already. Lots of benefits. We had a free dinner at CentOnze restaurant for our kid, and a free bottle of wine. The location can't be beat. It's right on La Rambla and if you have a room facing the side street it's not noisy at all, even if you are in the lower floor count. The nearest metro station is the Liceu, which is super convenient. Walking distance to Mercado de La Boqueria, which is the bomb because you'd want that fresh fruit juice and killer breakfast in the morning at the most famous market in Spain. This is the hotel to stay when I come back to Barcelona.",5,2015,07,26
37,"Historic building outside, cool modern design inside","Located right on La Rambla, steps from the Placa de Catalunya and the Barri Gotic, this hotel is in the middle of Barcelona's bustling core. 

The rooms are modern, decorated in earth tones, apart from the bathrooms, which are done in black slate tile. Our room had a large shower stall.

Service is ok but not outstanding. Unlike the Four Points Barcelona, which had our bags waiting in our rooms, the Meridien had to be prompted to deliver them. The room keys did not work, necessitating a trip downstairs to fix the problem.",4,2015,07,26
37,Barcelona Bound,"Arriving in Barcelona for 3 days prior to a cruise, we chose to use Sheraton points at  Le Meridien. The location was super.  Right off the busiest, noisiest street in town.  A lovely room overlooking the street is not what you want.  The noise outside did not stop until 3:00 am on both Friday and Saturday nights.  You were however in the Gothic Quarter, which is a good place to be.  Most sites were no  more than a 20 minute walk from the hotel and a cab was easily found for your visit to Parc Guell and the Sagrada Familla.  The hotel rooms were a bit on the small side but the room was clean and pleasant. The hotel lobby is quite comfortable and there were good cafes across the street in case you didn't want to pay the exorbitant prices at the hotel for breakfast.  All in all a good choice for first time visitors to Barcelona.",3,2015,07,25
37,Vacation,Great location. Everything is very close by and walkable. The breakfast was pretty good too. Worth taking over points. Reception was friendly and fast. Don't use your spg upgrades here. I got confirmed a prestige suite but was down graded once I arrived. The hotel was great for visiting Barcelona,4,2015,07,24
37,Would have moved if we were staying longer.,"First off if you've never been to Barcelona (like I hadn't) being right on La Ramblas sounds like a good thing. Here's the catch: to me La Ramblas felt like the Vegas strip. Crowded with tourists and hucksters, overpriced restaurants and honking taxis.  Yes there's a fruit market but if you want a better feel for the city, stay closer to the beach or in neighborhoods like El Born. We were only here for 3 nights or I would have changed hotels.

Now for this hotel, I still give it a 3 no matter where it was in the city.  First room we were given smelled like fresh paint.  The window was closed (it only opens 4 inches) and it was stuffy and smelled of fumes.  I went to the desk and asked for another room emphasizing that it be quiet.  She placed us in the room directly across from the elevator on the first floor.  The elevator dings every time it opens and BONUS the subway runs right under that room.  Even with earplugs I woke at 6AM to rumbling under the bed every few minutes. Are you kidding me?  I asked for a quiet room.  Groggy eyed at the front desk they were able to promptly move us to another room on the 3rd floor.  Why weren't we given this room to begin with? It was finally quiet except for a pipe in the wall that would moan occasionally without warning. Sigh.....  

The rooms are very modern with low beds and sliding glass doors. Not my taste. There were motion detectors at the foot of the bed so when you walk to the bathroom a bright blue light illuminates your way and but also wakes up your companion.  It un-conveniently turns off after a short time plunging you in complete darkness while you're still on the toilet.  Our sink was also peeling like another reviewer mentioned.  The bathroom was large and the shower was great. Free Wi-Fi was terrible so you end up paying 42 euros for 3 day stay. 

Breakfast was included in our rate.  It was a nice spread but I was so jet lagged I didn't feel like eating the heavy, greasy offerings. The subway also runs under the restaurant. Awesome.  Also take note that room service breakfast is NOT complimentary which was an expensive mistake I made on the last morning. 

The hotel is full of pre or post cruise ship guests, lots of Americans etc.  It doesn't feel Spanish at all.  I won't be back.",3,2015,07,23
37,This was our first time in Barcelona and I could not have been more pleased with the location of Le Meridien,"The rooms were very nice, the bathroom was awesome( I loved the shower head) the location was excellent, the check-in staff were very helpful. The had adapters available to borrow and fresh bottles of water were delivered daily.  The restaurant was very good.  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona",5,2015,07,23
37,"One star is given to some staff at this hotel, and another one is given for the location and breakfast combined.","Checked out today and this is a first-hand review.

Most staff in this hotel, especially those who works at check-in and concierge are excellent. Attentive, nice and polite.

However, the hotel has some staff whom are HORRIBLE. Why does it take 90 minutes and four phone-calls to ask for a bottle of water. Both unacceptable at a SPG Category 5 and a 5* listed hotel(the hotel has a board indicating the hotel is indeed ""5*"" at the door). At EUR 550/night, this hotel is nothing compared to Park Hyatt Milano(EUR 600/night). I should spend more and chosen Mandarin Oriental instead.

Hotel view was excellent, however window shades does not close properly at suite 142, and some windows are broken.

Location IS excellent. There couldn't be any complain about its location.

Breakfast spread was EXCELLENT. At 20EUR/person, it is absolutely worth it. Restaurant and its purser was horrific as well(and also reasonably priced).

Hotel guestroom is indeed very loud, and a room swap was not possible due to fully booked hotel. Asked technician about the issue twice and it is not fixed. 

I do not recommend this hotel unless you absolutely need to live near the Ramblas, the area is indeed very safe(unlike what others described) and absolutely safer than Gallaria in Milan. 

I do recommend to have a breakfast at this hotel though, if possible.",2,2015,07,21
37,Location Location Location,"Stayed at the hotel for three nights in July and was very satisfied.  Our flight landed very early in the morning so we dropped off our bags at around 8.30 and was told that they would call me when the room was available.  Given how full the hotel was I was not expecting to hear from them until midafternoon but they called me at 11.30 telling me that my room was ready. As requested, I was given a rear facing room away from the noisy street.  It was a little small but very well appointed and comfortable.  The hotel has a feel of a boutique hotel although it is rather large.  I did not have much interaction with the staff but they were very pleasant and helpful.  They don’t have a great looking restaurant but given that the market is a block away we had breakfast there every morning.  The hotel is perfectly situated for walking to many of the sights of Barcelona.  As an SPG member I was automatically given a 4 pm check out without even asking for it.  I would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,07,21
37,Hotel jewel in the heart of La Rambla,"Not only does this hotel have a great location, but the staff could not have been nicer.  We were there in peak tourist season - July - but still had a fast easy check in and were able to get into our room in the morning, way before the official check in time.  The concierge was very helpful, altogether a great hotel.",5,2015,07,20
37,Short break in Barcelona,"Late booking to meet up with family at the end of their river cruise. Wasn't sure about the hotel when we first arrived. 

Completely clean, friendly staff and great service. The way the handled a missing TV remote and one missed room service was excellent - fast, followed up twice and it made us realise this was far from a standard hotel. 

Very helpful concierge as well. 

Recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,07,18
37,"Excellent service, wonderful rooms!","The location was wonderful and the rooms were great, but the service takes the cake at this hotel. From the moment we checked in, till the second we departed the staff was there to help. The bartender/hostess, Josephina, at the adjoining restaurant was especially helpful. She took some time to listen to what we wanted to do and then made spot on suggestions! (avoiding the typical tourist destinations) In turn we became regulars for cocktail hour to thank her and hopefully get another expert Barcelona tip; she never failed to deliver. Our trip to Barcelona wouldn't have been the same without her!",5,2015,07,16
37,"Great hotel, perfect location","This is a lovely hotel that is ready for tourists with excellent concierge services, welcoming staff and lovely rooms - and it is right on La Rambla so it is walking distance to everything.  Definitely will stay here again!",5,2015,07,16
37,Unhelpful Concierge,"I'm actually writing this review in anticipation of an upcoming September stay that I am now considering cancelling. My wife reached out to the concierge with some questions about our stay and to ask for help making dinner reservations. It took 2 full weeks for the concierge to respond. Our follow up email directly to the hotel went completely ignored. By the time the concierge responded, our preferred restaurant was already booked up. Additionally, the concierge ignored all of our other questions about the stay and simply gave us a list of recommended restaurants. Needless to say, this pales in comparison to the level of customer service we've become accustomed to at other Starwood properties. I'm considering switching to the W, but we had been hoping to stay in Las Ramblas. I'll probably just look at other options in that area. Between the unresponsive concierge and our concerns about king beds actually being 2 single beds pushed together... it just doesn't seem like this hotel is the right fit for a vacationing couple.",2,2015,07,16
37,"We were not overwhelmed - great location, though","We arrived around 4:30 in the afternoon, and had to wait almost an hour for the staff to arrange our reserved room. Then we settled in for the night and discovered that the minibar hadn't been plugged in and the  clock/radio didn't work. The bathroom lavatory surface had peeling paint, reminiscent of a third world hotel. The worst was the shower with a tub arrangement was an accident waiting to happen for those 75+, with a huge step getting in and out. We asked for another room the next day. They don't fold down your bed at night or leave a chocolate. As others have stated, the location near las Ramblas is its biggest attribute.",2,2015,07,15
37,Amazing location,We stayed at this hotel pre-cruise and it is very nice. Quick mart next door and tapas restaurants everywhere. You can watch the interesting people on the street from your window. The only downside was my mother fell on a rug they had by the elevator and broke several ribs. That kind of ruined things as she couldn't walk without pain.,4,2015,07,14
37,Where else would you stay?,"Perfect Location, Lovely room, Great breakfast. 
Right in the heart of Barcelona and perfect for people watching. Very comfortable and clean. The disabled room was well equipped. Access through the restaurant was preferable to the lift in reception for wheelchairs.",5,2015,07,14
37,Excellent location with great Plat recognition,"Stayed here 2 nights and LOVED the property.

Platinum recognition: AMAZING. Upon checking in I was immediately greeted by Ana the Experience Specialist. Because we checked in early and my gf had fallen asleep while waiting for the room, Salvadore the Front Manager upgraded us to their ""presidential suite"" which was the 360 degree suite for one night (the second night was booked already). Needless to say the room was amazing.  

The hotel now switches between hosting a cocktail mixing and paella making event for their platinum guests. The week I visited, we had cocktail mixing so it was fun to learn from one of their bartenders how to make a few drinks. I've heard the paella is better but unfortunately the chef was only teaching the course the following week. 

The amenity was a oven glove so I opted for the breakfast on the bottom floor. Food was good but nothing special. 

Rooms: The 360 suite was amazing of course. It came with two balconies and a 360 degree foyer with a retractable projector screen on the 9th floor. There were plenty of plugs and the bedside clock was outfitted for the newer iPhones. The second night we were switched back to our original Prestige suite on the SPG preferred floor (2nd floor). We had a view overlooking the Ramblas and the windows were thick enough that we couldn't really hear the noise unless there were sirens. This room was a little bit older with less plugs and included a Bose and iHome sound system/alarm clock that only accepted the older iPhones. Both rooms had rain forest showers and provided Cinq Monde toiletries. 

All in all, I would recommend staying here if you're trying to do all the touristy things. We moved over to the W Barcelona our last 2 nights. While the view was great, we were pretty thankful for having done most of the touristy things our first 2 nights.",5,2015,07,14
37,Perfect Location,"The staff is friendly, although the lobby can get extremely crowded.  The rooms are nice, the air conditioning is very good and, most importantly, the location is superb.  It is right in the heart of La Rambla.  I will be back.",4,2015,07,14
37,in the heart of the rambla,"just off the rambla -- which means we could walk everywhere we wanted to go in barcelona -- the meridien was clean, modern, efficient, comfortable, quirky (in a very good artful way), in other words just the ticket. i loved their wifi, which let me take care of my online 'stuff' quickly and get back out there exploring barcelona. one of our guides recommended the bar lobo across the street, and that just gave us more of a feeling of being 'at home' in this little block of barcelona. i would definitely go back. i would definitely recommend it to friends. the spa upstairs was excellent. my airplane back got sorted out up there and i'm grateful for the massage that saved my trip.",5,2015,07,11
37,Excellent location and family amenities,"We stayed at this property in early July. The location is fantastic since it is very central to exploring most of Barcelona (even if you hate La Ramblas). The rooms are nice and decently-sized for a city hotel - what's very thoughtful is the spacious bathrooms! The buffet breakfast is a great spread - combination of the usual continental stuff and some Spanish items. And the staff is great - they even helped us track down a stroller we'd forgotten in a taxi

Great experience, overall. Would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Barcelona and plan to spend most of your time seeing the usual sights",5,2015,07,11
37,A wonderful experience!,"A perfect location for our two-day visit to Barcelona. From check-in to check-out the staff, front desk in particular, was so accommodating and met our every need. Rooms were clean with every amenity, and the breakfast buffet was excellent. I would not hesitate to return if our travel plans take us to Barcelona again.",5,2015,07,10
37,Excellent Hotel,"Quaint, well-decorated, quiet, small in size. Most importantly, located right in the middle of the middle of the center of Barcelona's tourist district. To some this may be a disadvantage, but to me the location was crucial. You walk out right on to Ramblas and within a short walking distance you're in the Gothic Quarter, or in the port, or at Montjuic. 

Our room was well appointed in a modern style, fairly sized considering the size of the hotel and the tendency for hotel rooms in Europe to be small. 

Fresh flowers, sexy a la Hotel Costes music and well-chosen scents dominated the hotel lobby at all times. Wonderful hotel.",5,2015,07,09
37,"Beautiful, modern, and in the heart of everything.","My wife and I stayed in Le Meridien for our honeymoon. Our first impression was how convenient the hotel is to everything. It sits right on La Rambla (busy pedestrian street and a highlight of Barcelona) and is just steps away from a major Metro hub that will take you anywhere in the city. Lots of shopping, eating, and people watching literally right outside the door.

The staff really went above and beyond. They carried our bags to the room for us and gave us a room tour (it was a bit funny at the time, but in retrospect was a nice touch). The 24 hr front desk was helpful for our 3:30 AM departure time. All we had to do was walk downstairs. They had arranged the taxi, loaded our bags, and checked us out. Very nice considering how early we had to leave.

The room was clean and modern: big flat screen, rain shower head, motion sensitive illuminated floors for walking at night, etc. Lobby area is nice as well with a cafe and restaurant. The free wifi was better than we had experienced at the other European hotels we stayed at.

Definitely a great place to stay and worth every penny. I can't recommend Le Meridien Barcelona highly enough.",5,2015,07,09
37,Wonderful,"I stayed here with my parents last summer. We were greeted with s bottle of prosecco as we were celebrating their wedding anniversary, which we enjoyed out on our balcony (we had a junior suite). The location of the hotel is amazing, close to all the sights (which was handy as we had a mobility issue) as well as a Carrefour if you need to stop for any snacks. Amazing hotel, lovely clean rooms, courteous staff. We also paid a visit to the top floor pool. Probably would get a little crowded if more than four people in there, but a beautiful space nevertheless. Thoroughly recommend.",5,2015,07,08
37,"Not a five star hotel, but pretty good.","This hotel is located in the center of the tourist district, so very convenient for any type of activity you may want to do.  Rooms are small, but well appointed, with modern decor.  Breakfast was traditional European buffet, and fresh juice is a nice touch.  I enjoyed the hotel after we switched our room from the first floor to the third floor. Still there was no view, but at least we didn't feel like we were in the basement.  Remember the higher up, the better in this hotel.",4,2015,07,08
37,Barcelona,"Great hotel off the Main Street. Walking distance to many shops, restaurants and close to the metro.  The staff at the hotel was great and very helpful.  Our room was what we would expect from a Meridien Hotel.  Would stay there again.",4,2015,07,05
37,Excellent Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"Stayed at the Le Meridien Barcelona for 2 nights in an upgraded suite with a balcony overlooking La Ramblas, which was lovely. The room was clean, large and comfortable and the balcony well appointed and the bathroom outstanding. As platinum members we took advantage of the breakfast amenity, which was also very nice. I'd highly recommend this property, for both the location as well as the quality of the rooms. We did have some difficulty at check in; the guaranteed 3pm check in was more like 4pm due to high turn-over of guests, but given how lovely the room was, it was well worth the wait. Thank you!",5,2015,07,05
37,Wonderful Hotel Experience- one of the Best We've  Had,"We were in the amazing Mediterranean Suite. Believe the pictures- this room is very large with a beautiful bathroom and huge outdoor terrace. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Every evening a thoughtful treat was left in our room; a bottle of Cava, a large tapas serving of Iberian ham with crackers, fruit or a large bar of chocolate. The in-room espresso machine is  nice touch and the housekeeping service was so unobtrusive. We never saw all the housekeeping harangue  out in the hallway yet our room was spotlessly clean each day with a nice turndown service in the evening. We would definitely return. Barcelona was typically beautiful as well.",5,2015,07,04
37,NO customer service,"We have stayed in this hotel in the past.  The customer service was luke warm at best.  We gave the hotel another chance because of location; unfortunately, we needed to end our trip one day early for a medical need, we gave them 24 hours notice, and they would not release us from the reservation.  This is no way to treat customers.  After rearranging travel and flights to get back to the US, this is the last thing an establishment should do to their Starwood Preferred Guest customer.",1,2015,07,03
37,Perfect location,Nice hotel.  Great people.  Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.  We had a room on the third floor over looking Ramblas.  Perfect for people watching as the street was filled with people day and night.  Took the steps every day down to the lobby.  Friendly staff always willing to help and offer ideas.,5,2015,07,02
37,A gem on La Rambla,"I'm not sure where some of the reviews for this hotel are coming from.  I'm a long-time world traveler (China, Japan, Europe, Australia, every major US city you can think of, etc...).  This is a top-end European hotel in a downtown environment.  Net, the rooms are not expansive, Embassy Suite style rooms that you might get in the US -- however, they're larger than the typical European city hotel room, tastefully appointed with nice bathrooms.  Net, the rooms are well-above-average--but they're not large. If you've stayed in a metro-area European city, you'll know what I mean.  That said, the square footage is listed when you book these things, so please verify so that your expectations are met.

I can't say enough good things about the staff -- I made fairly extensive use of the concierges (they saved me from one big mistake), the kitchen staff (we had breakfast there every morning), and talked to the front desk more than once.  Everyone was awesome!    They're patient, pleasant, and knowledgeable.  When the kitchen staff found out I was Celiac, they arranged for Gluten Free bread every morning.  When they found out my wife prefers Hot Cocoa to Coffee, we had a pot of Hot Cocoa at our table 2 minutes after we sat down -- every morning.  It was a lot of little things -- but they got everything right, and they really make you feel like a valued guest.

The location is perfect.  You're on La Rambla, in the middle of two stops for line 3 of the Metro.  (If you've never been to Barcelona -- they have one of the best metro systems in the world -- you can get everywhere worth going on the metro + regional train).  Net, you can be on the metro in 5-10 minutes.  It's easy walking distance to the Gothic Cathedral and Palau De Musica Catalonia, and easy rides to Sagrada Familia and other attractions.

Note:  I'm a Platinum member of Starwood, so I did stay on the members floor.  We occupied two rooms, so I obviously can't vouch for the entire hotel, but all of the public areas were great, and, again, the staff was amazing.",5,2015,06,29
37,Best Hotel. Best Location. Quiet Rooms.,"We use the Starwood Group Hotels regularly because of their high standard. This hotel is excellent. Comfortable, spacious and quiet rooms despite being right on La Rambla. We had a room on the 5th floor. Everything pretty much what we expected but I must say the staff here are exceptional. Very responsive and helpful. If you are going to stay in the middle of Barcelona this is THE place to stay.",5,2015,06,29
37,The most perfect location,"Really a great hotel. Just a brief walk with luggage from Placa Catalunya to the hotel. My early arrival was met with my room ready and it was great. Clean, modern, on the 5th floor what seems to be a renovated floor. the room is a bit smaller than expected but very smart in its arrangement.
My wife slept for 13 hours in what she said was ""the moat comfortable bed she has ever slept in in her entire life."" Can't give more of a compliment than that! And the shower: she never wanted to get out of it! Le Meridien made my wife happy, so that's all that matters to me. A home run. And the gentleman at the front desk was fantastic. very proud of his city and wanted to show us the map of the city. 
Carrefour is right next door with a fantastic selection of ready to eat food, beer, wine, all at great prices. Then the Pita place right up the street for an incredible snack at unbelievable prices. But.....be sure to cross the street and walk down a couple blocks to Maximus Helados (ice cream) for the absolute best ice cream in the entire city, maybe in the country. MUST go for an ice cream cone.",4,2015,06,29
37,Worst hotel and very bad service,"The room was dirty and and it smelled horrible I expected much more from an SPG hotel. Also we had a rate problem and was not cleared until the last day of stay and at that point there was nothing to do which then we had no choice to decide what to do, very incompetent staff. Would never come back or recommend this property.",1,2015,06,28
37,Perfect location,This hotel is in a great central location for exploring the city in every direction and also close to meeting spots for tours and excursions out of the city.  The hotel was clean and the staff was attentive and helpful.  I would absolutely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.,5,2015,06,27
37,Excellent service and beautiful suite!,"Staff could not have been more helpful. They figured out from my ID that my birthday was a few days earlier and sent up a bottle of Cava and a hand written note as a gift, how nice is that! First suite I ever stayed in that we actually really used the living room, it was that nice. Can't wait to go back.",5,2015,06,26
37,Great...,This hotel has a great location right in the centre of the action... The staff are great and ready to offer any helpful guidance required etc. ... the rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  For a bit of luxury this is a good place to stay.,5,2015,06,26
37,Location!,"Excellent customer service.  The bar/restaurant staff were exceptional.  Nice to be on las ramblas.  Rooms were lovely and clean! The concierge was extremely helpful, booking restaurants, car service or verbal instructions to the metro. Any request was met with a smile and efficiency!",5,2015,06,25
37,Excellent hotel in a perfect location,"The staff at Le Meridien was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were spacious, modern and clean with great amenities.  I loved that they gave us two bottles of water every day!  La Rambla is touristy and loud however we didn't have any noise in our room.  There is easy access to the metro and cabs are always right outside.",5,2015,06,24
37,"Location, location, location","This is in the heart of Barcelona, only three blocks from Catalunya Square, it corners on Rambla which is a pedestrian mall. Walking distance from almost anywhere. The rooms are good size with a place to keep luggage, other than under the bed. There are plenty of electrical outlets, and one in the bathroom (which is generally absent in European hotels ~ and I need one for my curling iron). The staff is friendly, accommodating, and welcoming. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,06,24
37,Great hotel in best location!,"We had a Junior Suite on the 9th floor. High enough to block out the noise from Las Ramblas at night. Great to be a short walk from everything including the Hop-On Hop-off bus!
The Sangria at the hotel bar is delicious! The rooms are very modern and clean. Great food and service at the hotel eating areas too.",4,2015,06,23
37,Outstanding Hotel in the best location in Barcelona,"From the moment we arrived until our last day, we were treated phenomenally!
Front desk could not have been more gracious and hospitable, a special thank you to
Louisa, what a great ambassador to Le Meridien.  When I experienced a problem with noise, she was very understanding & changed rooms without hesitation.  The concierge service there is also amazing, thank you Bruno for all the wonderful recommendations that you gave us.  The hotel stands on its own merit, with it's location in the heart of the city.  We found everything enjoyable and definitely a trip I would like to repeat again.",5,2015,06,23
37,Excellent Choice on Las Ramblas,This hotel has wonderful staff and great rooms with modern bathrooms. Stone lined shower stalls with rain shower head as well as hand-held. Night lighting system which is motion activated so that your trip to the bathroom is made easier overnight. Stay in a room away from the noise of Las Ramblas and dine in the hotel restaurant for the fixed price menu!,5,2015,06,23
37,Is it possible to be peaceful and quiet in Las Ramblas?,"Yes!
Excellent location, service and rooms. I decided to propose to my girlfriend in Barcelona. The help and support from the staff exceeded my expectations. 
As a consultant I've had to travel a lot; thus, I know a bit about hotels: Le Meridien @ Barcelona I fully recommend for leisure and/or work.",5,2015,06,22
37,Whatsapp service,"All was great, perfect location, very nice bathroom. Specifically like to give creds to their new Whatsapp service. You can text anything (taxi booking, room service, dinner reservations), thought it was so convenient and loved not having to pick up the phone!!",5,2015,06,21
37,A Quiet Refuge on La Rambla,"When our taxi drew up to the door of Le Meridien only steps from La Rambla, we were horrified we had made a terrible mistake.  We invisioned three sleepless nights listening to the noise of such a busy street.  Actually, we heard not a sound!  Our room was delightfully quiet.
The stay at Le Meridian greatly added to our total enjoyment of visiting Barcelona.  The décor is fresh and comfortable,and the staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable.  They arranged a fabulous guide for us, who gave us a delightful and very informative tour of everything Gaudi!
It did not take us long to feel right at home walking the old, beautiful neighborhood surrounding the hotel, and we absolutely loved promanading the entire length of La Rambla each evening.
There were great tapas restaurants everywhere, wonderful small shops and the excitement of being right in the middle of such an exhilarating city.
I wholeheartedly recommend Le Meridian Barcelona and definitely will stay there again!",4,2015,06,20
37,"Great location, good hotel","Great location. 15 min walk to the beach. 15 min walk to any of the gaudy attractions. Right on the gothic quarter and eixample. 

Hotel is nice. Clean, modern, well appointed. Rooms are a bit small, but so is all of Barcelona.  This is a clrealy a 5 star hotel, but it won't wow this you with anything inside other than great location and a clean well appointed room with good service.  Loved our stay here for a week. 
",5,2015,06,20
37,Great Location,"We stayed at the LeMeridien Barcelona the beginning of April, it was wonderful, our standard room overlooked Las Ramblas.  We purchased the breakfast with our room and it was outstanding.  The concierge was very helpful with giving us directions and assisting us with purchasing tickets.",5,2015,06,19
37,Poorly Run,"The toliet paper is worse than the free ones we get at the beach in california. In other words, almost sand paper.

I was lied to by the front desk saying no suites available.  At the time of checkin and at the time of this review, a suite is still available online.",2,2015,06,19
37,Superb Service,"Through Costco Travel, I booked a stay at Le Meridien over the past two weeks before and after a Western Mediterranean cruise that boarded in Barcelona. I found the hotel a real oasis, especially after my connecting flight from Heathrow airport was delayed fro over five hours. As soon as I checked in, one of the front desk staffers handed over the process to her supervisor to complete the procedure. My regret is that I have failed to get all the names of the front office desk staff, except for Magda, all friendly and personable young Barcelonans who made sure to make eye contact with each guest, making each one feel most welcome. Not only were they attentive, but they also showed real sincerity in handling their guests. They showed this by being detailed oriented, friendly and pleasant. I did not feel rushed at any point while at the front desk. The supervisor offered to give me and my girlfriend a better room after our first night, although I must say that there is no bad room at the Le Meriedien.
Everything in the room was spick and span, immaculately clean, thanks to their efficient housekeeping staff. The hotel is located along La Rambla, the main tourist drag of Barcelona, and is within walking distance of most of the city's many attractions. The Sagrada Familia is just a  short subway ride away. From here, you can also walk to Barcelonita, where you can enjoy one of Barcelona's public beaches near the hip Olympic Village built for the 1992 Olympic Games.
The breakfast and the bar staffs were very friendly and helpful, the reason why my girlfriend and I were at the bar every night of our stay there.The ambience of the hotel captures the spirit of Barcelona, open, warm and friendly as well as artistic. But above everything, it is the people who work at this hotel that made all the difference.",5,2015,06,19
37,An artsy hotel at a great location!,"This hotel partners with local art museums! The room key cards are works of art! I kept mine because it was so unique! The decor of this hotel is quite artsy - very fitting. 

The rooms are great but nothing special. My love of this hotel is the location! Located right on the famous Las Ramblas street! The street comes alive at night! 

We stayed at this hotel a couple days before and after New Years Eve and we welcomed the new year at the hotel's NYE Gala! It was quite a delicious dinner but only an average gala/special event dinner food-wise. The most memorable part was the eating of the grapes at countdown, a local tradition! The hotel gave each of the participants a bag full of noisemakers and confetti, masks and boas! it was lots of fun! We had a wonderful New Years Eve experience!

We highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona!",5,2015,06,18
37,Location is good but staff make it great,"Stayed at this property on Starwood points as part of a birthday celebration and was very pleased with everything from the staff, to the room, to the location. We were met by the guest services manager Amaia upon arrival who was very gracious and took the time to come and meet us at check in in person. Soon after check in a bottle of cava and some chocolate covered strawberries arrived which we thoroughly enjoyed on the roof top patio that I would highly recommend for a sun drenched afternoon or early evening cocktail. The hotel is in the middle of the action close to shopping, restaurants and the beach.  The front desk staff were excellent and it is obvious that all employees are well trained and focused on delivering great service.",5,2015,06,18
37,First Class Hotel in the perfect location,"Le Meridien Barcelona is a first class hotel in the perfect location for your introduction to Barcelona.  Mere steps from La Rambla, this hotel puts you close to everything, the Mercado, el Reval, La Rambla. The staff is extremely helpful and very nice.  The bathrooms are large and clean.  The Spa and Terrace are a pleasant respite.  I even used the workout facilities on multiple occasions.  Morning Espresso from the in-house barrista was delicious!",5,2015,06,18
37,A wonderful place to stay in the heart of Barcelona,"I have stayed at The Meridien many times over the years and I have never been disappointed. Great location, great hotel, nice and efficient staff.  And if you have a car, parking is really easy, as it is located right underneath the hotel and very roomy as well, so no need to worry about the size or the height of your car.",5,2015,06,18
37,"Great location, comfortable hotel","Le Meridien Barcelona was the first stop on our two week Iberian peninsula vacation.  It was a very good hotel in a great location on Las Ramblas.  The room and bedding was clean and the shower was the best shower I have ever used.  I truly loved it and took a bunch of pictures to hopefully, someday incorporate in my house.  We were in room 531 and there was not much of a view, but it was quiet and easy to get to.  Despite how tiny the room was, I was impressed by the fully functioning air conditioner and the fact that it was true king size bed.  I did not eat at the hotel at all, but we did have a early evening drink at the Le Pop Cocktail bar which was very enjoyable.
The reason I am not giving it five stars is for two reasons.  #1. We had requested early check in, and which this was the first time we had not been granted it, which is not great, but ok.  We were told we would get a call when our room was ready and never received one.  Five hours after we checked in, we were tired and ready to rest, so we went back to check to see if our room was ready and it had been ready.  #2. Our room wasn't made up on our first full day until sometime after 4:30pm.  We came back for a siesta around 1:30 since we were jetlagged and were disappointed it hadn't been done.  The rest of our stay was not a problem though.
Despite a couple of hiccups I would recommend this hotel.  The front desk staff was always so helpful for us even when the concierge was not available.  Upon checkout, Joao was so helpful and gave us some advice on our next stop, Lisbon!",4,2015,06,17
37,Good but with some issues,"The Le Meridien Barcelona is a full service hotel, very nicely situated for touring. Right on La Rambla, it is convenient to everything. Sound proofing is quite good.  We had a room directly looking over the avenue and the noise level was acceptable. 

The room was large by most standards, good storage, large bathroom, ok lighting, though the halls were way too dark. 

Restaurant was first class but not in love with its particular choices of food.   But, that is an individual thing. Service excellent, attractively decorated, priced ok and cocktails were also excellent. 

What  I did find is that we felt the hotel was under staffed. There were lines at the front desk, and housekeeping was very delayed during the day. Early check although not guaranteed is usual in the hotels we stay in Europe. I really think it had to do with lack of housekeeping staff. 

So, in summary, Le Meridien Barcelona was a ""mixed bag.""  ",3,2015,06,14
37,Le meridian Barcelona,"Le meridian Barcelona is small in size and located in the la Ramblas where all the major shopping and eateries are located.  we spent 2 nights prior embarking on a cruise holidays. To summarize our experience. The hotel is build on a old traditional style building but the room interior appear to have gone through a recent refurbishment with a modern look but don't expect for a proper five star hote room size.  This hotel has a very knowledgeable and helpful conceige but front desk staff appear cold.  There is only one restaurant in the hotel and they serve decent buffet for breakfast. The A la carte menu for dinner also not bad and reasonable price with very friendly waiting staff. One advice for those intending to visit Barcelona - avoid Sunday as all the shops are closed at la ramblas area. 

Opposite of Le meridian are hotel 1889 which look nice as well or those as seeking cheaper option can try citadine. Both of the alternative are just one street across.",4,2015,06,14
37,"Good location, great hotel","Very good hotel on the La Ramblas close to all the attractions. You have everything close by and edge is public transport stops near by. All the restaurants, everything you wish to eat you will find close by. If you are arriving by bus from the BCN intl airport, bus will drop you on Plaça de Catalunya from where this hotel is 300 meters maximum. I had a breakfast included in my package but I didn't managed to get up in time to get the breakfast :P Wifi is also super and rooms are also wide with window open to La Rambla. Recommended off course :)",5,2015,06,12
37,"Great location, super service, Needs some updating","The location was perfect.  Walkable to most sights.  The service was outstanding.

 I thought the rooms could use a bit of updating.  We had a room overlooking the Ramblas and I was concerned about the noise, but it was very well soundproofed and didn't prove a problem.",4,2015,06,11
37,Bad experience,"at the beginning the staff treated me very friendly, the third day was a victim of a robbery in the street and went to the hotel for help and did not receive any collaboration by the hotel team, should care more for the guests personally not coming back to this hotel ever.",1,2015,06,11
37,Nice hotel...great location,"Barcelona was the last part of our vacation.  The Le Meridien Barcelona, is very centrally located, just off Las Ramblas.

We used points to reserve our room, and got upgraded to a suite.  The only thing is our room had two full beds, vs a king we requested.  Other than this, no complaints about this hotel whatsoever!  The staff were great, and our suite was spacious.

Our stay came with breakfast, which was served in the restaurant.  The staff were attentive and food selections were great!  A little of something for all food preferences!

All in all, if this is your first time in Barcelona, Le Meridien is well located, right off Las Ramblas, close to the Boqueria  Market, and the shopping districts.  I highly recommend this place!",4,2015,06,10
37,Outstanding Hotel - great accommodation and service,Phenomenal location - great rooms and outstanding service from all staff we interacted with. Overall a great customer experience!  I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the beautiful city of Barcelona.,5,2015,06,09
37,Loved the Location and Sevice!,Stayed for three nights. Found the location to be great right off of Las Ramblas. All service staff aim to please and were very helpful. Rooms are very modern and slate shower was tiled nicely and very large.,5,2015,06,08
37,"Excellent location, shower fantastic, quiet, clean, but beds a disappointment","We arrived very early from a red eye from JFK, and the staff was very helpful in getting us into our room early. We booked the room on an award, and so we received what is the worst room in the Deluxe category of rooms. I am a SPG Gold and entitled to upgrades, but that wasn't meant to be it appears. We stayed two nights. The ""view"" was of a rooftop, and the ""king"" was really two cots pushed together. I mean cots... no box spring of any sort. Just those flexible metal coils underneath the mattress. Don't expect cuddling with this  arrangement. The whole system would come apart. On the plus side, the hotel was pretty, lovely art nouveau staircase, the elevators worked well, the hallways were clean and renovated. The biggest plus is that the shower was really excellent and had a wonderful rainshower head. The location of the hotel is spot on ideal. Can't get much better. From the airport, get a bus to take you to Plaza de Catalunya, and it's a 5 minute walk south on Las Ramblas, hotel on the right. Same for your return to the airport. 

Make sure to go to La Boqueria which is only a couple of blocks away. Go hungry!!! Go early as it gets MOBBED! Closed Sundays. Incredible tapas at Taverna Basca Irati. Make reservations for the Picasso Museum beforehand, or plan to wait in a long line. Free on Sunday means that you need to get in line about an hour prior to opening. Near that site is the Museum of Chocolate. Didn't go into the museum, but I must say the chocolates are to die for and CHEAP by USA standards. If you love fine chocolate, this is a must! Of course go to Casa Mila and the Block of Discord. Go to Sagrada Familia either early morning or late afternoon... the east and west windows are designed to create spectacular rainbow effects on the interior, so either go when sun is rising, or setting. I was there on May 3rd at 3:45pm and the rainbow through the west windows is a once in a lifetime spectacle. Amazing. I loved Barcelona. Beach areas really funky! Try to go for a lunch on the beach. It was very warm and sunny while we were there, and only early May. I will go back someday.",4,2015,06,08
37,A once great hotel brand needs an update here...,"As we found all over Barcelona on this trip, the staff in the hotel were lovely, helpful, friendly and welcoming. The hotel location is unbeatable.  
We stayed in a suite on the 5th ""Starwood"" floor and were disappointed, it's not a 4* premium experience. The public areas are without atmosphere and breakfast just 20% less tasty than it should be - please go and buy better ingredients and get your bakery sorted out! They do oversell the place, even the video of the hotel shown on the screens in the lifts is much more appealing than the real thing....",3,2015,06,04
37,Nice hotel in a good location,"Stayed here with family for a couple of nights overall a very nice experience.  The staff were friendly and helpful and overall everything went smoothly.  The hotel is in a great part of the city for exploring, right off of las ramblas.  We had a basic room which was very nice my parents staid in a suit which was amazing looking right out over the street.  Despite the busy area the rooms were very quite.  Would definitely come back, wifi is pretty slow though.",4,2015,06,03
37,"Great location, friendly staff","Situated right off the main Las Ramblas strip, the hotel is walkable to a number of great shops and restaurants while also being close to the metro. The front desk associate was one of the most helpful we've ever met, more than happy to talk us through the city and the best neighborhoods, restaurants, etc. Overall, a nicely updated hotel, in a convenient location allowing you access all over the city.",5,2015,06,03
37,Great location,"Well situated on les rambles and in walking distance to many local attractions including the harbor and the Gaudi houses.
Concierge was very helpful and assisted in arranging tours and getting reservations.
Rooms were of sufficient size and decently furnished and the front desk personnel were friendly and also helpful.",4,2015,06,02
37,Great location and staff,"I recently stayed as part of an organized tour.  I have not ever been so warmly received by hotel reception staff.  One would have thought I stayed on a weekly basis.  The room was comfortable and without a view, but this meant that it was very quiet.  At this hotel view may mean not so quiet.  Breakfast was excellent with very attentive staff.  I had dinner my first night and the food was excellent with a very helpful waiter and I thought reasonably priced for an hotel.  The location is excellent for exploring on your own.",5,2015,06,02
37,Short and sweet,"Very well located, right on Las Ramblas.
Limited access for cars and taxis.
A rather restricted dinner menu, but what is on the menu is excellently prepared and served.
Generous sized rooms, comfortable, clean and quiet.
Friendly reception staff",4,2015,05,29
37,Perfect location comfortable hotel,"It is located only a few meters away from La Rambla, that's wonderful as it is very close and away enough from the crowd and noise. Rooms are neat, all I need is in. Modernly decorated cozy room with a window opening to fresh air. Breakfast openbuffet is rich enough & food is of good quality.",4,2015,05,29
37,Great location & staff,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff was always very helpful. One of the best things is that I always received great food and directions information. I was able to get things done quickly so I could really enjoy my holiday!  

Location is fabulous and right in the middle of everything.  Walk out the door and you can pretty much hit any of the main highlights with a 20 minute walk.  Rooms were well kept.",4,2015,05,29
37,Perfect!!,"This hotel was delightful. The service was excellent, the room was clean and large by European standards, and the location couldn't be beat. The staff was very helpful to me when I had a problem with my return flight. They also ordered tickets for us to attend an event that was in progress at the time. Overall, this hotel helped to make our visit to Barcelona a memorable one.",5,2015,05,29
37,Definitely a 5 star,"A great experience. Le Meridien has it all:a great location, staff, restaurant and even the the best beds. The concierge staff is truly helpful and altogether a truly enjoyable stay. Any trip to Barcelona  will definitely include Le Meridien.",5,2015,05,28
37,world class from the moment of arrival,"From the moment the doorman opened the door, I was impressed with the personal service and attention to detail of everything from the elevator to the room. The room size is larger than most European hotels, and the very large bath with walk in shower was impressive.
Complementary bottled water and well approximated desk for the computer , really added to the comfort.
Front staff all were very helpful to answer questions, help with directions and always welcomed you back from being out .Con
It is located on La Rambles, a very busy street in the Gothic district of Barcelona, with lots to do and see every day.
Hotel is located very near the bus and Metro station for easy transport about the city.
Will certainly stay again  in the future.",5,2015,05,27
37,great hotel great location,Location could not have been better.  The staff especially the concierge team is terrific. Breakfast buffet was very good too.   You walk out of the hotel and in any direction you can explore the city.  No need for cabs there is so much to do near by.,5,2015,05,26
37,Le Meridien Barcelona,"wonderful hotel, great location, staff extremely helpful, the location on Las Ramblas is perfect for walking and exploring the city. the lobby is lovely.  the staff offers a warm greeting.  We were surprised by a bottle of champagne for a birthday celebration.  We will be back!",5,2015,05,26
37,Great locale for Barcelona,"Le Meridien are almost always highly dependable for a very nice place to stay and this is no exception.  Beautifully decorated lobby area, you are met at the door graciously with staff offering assistance and the front desk was also very friendly and responsive to needs and requests.  Rooms were nice and spacious.  Hotel restaurant used for breakfast and one dinner also offered tasty food.  The key to this hotel is its superb location for travelers.  Adjacent to Las Ramblas and very near one of the city's key underground transit ""metro"" stations.  Nearby eateries on side streets were also nice.  No complaints with this stay.",4,2015,05,24
37,"location, location, location!",Great location to all the tourist locations in Barcelona! The hotel is on the la ramblas. The gothic quarter is very close and the water front is of equal distance. Being walking distance to many things was great and we found ourselves out in Barcelona until 2am most nights! The Le Meridien chains are a part of starwood so the level of service was very consistent. Staff was very friendly and helpful except for the concierge. He was quite short with my sister when she asked for restaurant recommendations. He was quick to shoe her away and only one restaurant recommendation which when I looked the restaurant up on trip advisor had a rating of 3. The hotel needs to really evaluate their concierge staff. The hotel offered free museum tickets to the MACBA . The rooms were nice and clean and the free breakfast was great.,5,2015,05,23
37,Wonderful Location,"This hotel is located centrally on Las Ramblas. The market is only a couple of blocks away. The old Roman walls are basically across the street. There are lots of  places to eat within walking distance. The hotel itself has great dining.
The staff were friendly and exceptionally helpful.",5,2015,05,23
37,Le Meridein Barcelona,"The hotel is strategically located close to Las Ramblas, Barrio Gotico, the golden shopping district along Paseo de Gracia and with a lot of public transportation which in Barcelona is of a high quatilty.
The hotel is a good fit for both business and leisure travellers.
Very knid and well trained staff ready to satisfy your needs.
Premises are excellent, Gym, restaurant and rooms both standard rooms or suites.",5,2015,05,22
37,Excellent facility. Excellent staff. Excellent location.,"Great location for tourists, with some rooms fronting on La Ramblas. From the moment we arrived we were smoothly greeted at the door, reservations quickly confirmed and directed to our room by an entire staff that truly seemed to enjoy their work. The manager that we saw most often - Salvador, always made it a point to say ""hello"" and assure that all was OK (we are NOT VIP's, by the way). The rooms are very clean, comfortable, contemporary, and well-supplied. If you get the breakfast option, it is excellent. The concierge staff helped us in many regards, assuring that we had the best information, directions and prices. We would not hesitate to stay at the Le Meridien again.",5,2015,05,21
37,Le Meridian Barcelona,"Excellent hotel! May be the best overal experience for a siteseeing trip.
The view from the room was beautiful. We felt a part of the city.
The position of the hotel could not be better, sitting overlooking Las Ramblas, the excitement was palpable.
We will return!",5,2015,05,21
37,Le Meridien Hotel Barcelona is fabulous!,"My daughter and I enjoyed a wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel. Extremely pleased with the ease of booking this trip through AMEX travel, I look forward to stay in at another Le Meridien. The service, rooms, lobby and location were perfect. We highly recommended this location!",5,2015,05,20
37,Good stay,"We stayed for 3 nights last week in May 2015. Great stay. Great hotel. Very contemporary design and decor . Great facilities. Free wifi . Good quiet rooms. But a bit too small though with all amenities. Free bottled water every day. Small but functional gym. Didn't use the restaurant but Bar seemed nice. 

Best thing is the amazing location at Las Ramblas and great sights , connectivity by metro and many places to eat and bars to go to all nearby. 

Very friendly , professional , prompt and courteous staff. Concierge were nice and knowledgeable but we did get some confusing directions to get to castle Montjuic :) 
Breakfast was a bit expensive and light on the spread , so we opted to eat out as there are many places just as you step out :)  . 
All in all would definitely recommend this hotel over others farther out from las ramblas.",4,2015,05,20
37,Great Centrally Located Hotel with Strong Service & Amenties,"We stayed our first 3 nights at the Le Meridien which occupies a strategic corner off the Rambla providing an excellent base to tour the old city. Check in was great with a very friendly SPG rep and while our room was not ready we were able to change in the spa which was kind of a random and potentially very nice facility but didn't shine when we were briefly there. After a great meal at Quim de la Boqueria, we checked into our room which had an amazing terrace looking over the La Rambla. The room itself was not large but the large terrace and wonderful views more than made up for that. Later, we found a nice bottle of Cava left for us. 

This hotel provided a perfect base for exploring the Gothic Quarter, Gaudi sights and more. The service was excellent and they provided ample assistance before we arrived (planning dinner reservations & ensuring our FC Barcelona tickets arrived safely at the hotel) and during our stay. I recommend this hotel for a well situated one in the city center and especially if you are using SPG points where the value goes up even more given its relative low points value.",5,2015,05,20
37,"Great location,wonderful room, very helpful staff!","We were very impressed with the accommodations-room was well appointed and the walk in shower was huge. Also, the breakfasts had many choices and the service was very good. We loved staying here and we will be back.",5,2015,05,20
37,Great central location with good quality,"We stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and as with the Meridien brand standards are pretty much spot on. We had a family suite which was spacious with a large bathroom and king bed in one room and a double sofa bed in the other. Our room was on the 6th floor on La Rambla but as soon as the windows were closed there was little noise from the outside at night- time. Breakfasts are really good value with a good choice. I recommend online pre-booking of breakfasts as you usually get a 20% discount but you must take in breakfast on every day of your holiday.
Booked Bus Turistic hop on hop off bus as Place de la Catalunya close by so you can bag the best seats on the top of the bus.
Pre-booked time slot at Sagrada Familia and Nativity basilica- fantastic but either go early or late afternoon as it gets ridiculously busy.Another nice place to see with the guided tour is Santa de Maria del Mar(Barri gottica)- the young lady tour guide was really good and the tour was very interesting...again beautiful stained glass windows/architecture.
Would recommend trip to Tibidabo- great views of the city and a funfair on top if you have kids- funfair is quite retro which may appeal to more people.Personal favourite is Montjuic which again offers fantastic views of the city. Also parc de la Ciutadella which is lovely..and free and the harbour area.
Be sure to watch your belongings at all times especially if you stop to watch street entertainers etc as pickpocketing is rife and there were quite a lot of police around to  stop this. Dont let this put you off going to what is a wonderful large city with a small city feel to it.
We also got tickets to see Espanyol vs. Real Madrid...Ronaldo is some player...scored a hat trick and Madrid won 4-1.

All in all a fantastic short break but be prepared for a lot of walking.",5,2015,05,20
37,Brilliant Barcelona Le Meridien,"The hotel contacted me prior to my stay to check on any special request. After being informed it was a special occasion for us, we were allocated a nice suite with a view of La Rambla and there was then a complimentary bottle of Cava sent to our room on the first night there. The LM Experience Specialist (ANA MIQUEL) even assisted in ordering flowers.  

At the breakfast lounge, all the staff addressed us by our (family) name. 

Well done!",4,2015,05,20
37,Right location,"We stayed at the hotel for four nights. We booked a Dulux room with the view of La Rambla but it was little bit noisy in the evening. We were offered a Junior Suite with £85.00 supplement and it was the right choice. Their Suites located on 7th and 8th floor with nice balconies and they are very quite , with nice view of the city. Staff were helpful and we were looked after by Salvador, their General manager. He addressed all our requirements. We recommend this hotel for its location, service and cleanness.
We will stay there again.",4,2015,05,19
37,Great honeymoon destination,"Chose the hotel based on the location but was pleasantly surprised by the room itself and the level of service. 

We stayed in a Mediterranean suite, and were very comfortable. The terrace was great for laying out in the mornings. 

As mentioned, the service was excellent. The espresso machine in the room was not working, but I left a note by it in the morning and the machine was replaced by the time we got back in the afternoon.

I will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona. 

",5,2015,05,18
37,perfect location！,The hotel located in the perfect location for tourists! In the middle of La Rambla and right next to the market! Easy walk to Gaudi's art pieces. The check in time is 3 and we request for a triple's room but we got our room around 11. The king size bed is huge and the add on bed is not bad. Overall this is a good deal.,4,2015,05,17
37,"Excellent location, but not much else","This is a difficult hotel to review in as much as its location is central on the Ramblas, however, after that there was little quality to justify its five star rating. Our difficulties started when using the room keys to access the lift which were restricted to certain  floors. After spending a lot of time pressing buttons in a stationary lift we eventually found out that the keys were faulty and had them reprogrammed so as to access our floor.. Staff intimated that it was probably our  fault as tourists who tend to walk through  museum security gates with cards in your pocket and can erase the information on the card. Some system. The general ambience was sterile with little to no hotel information available. The hotel reminded me of  boutique hotels such as the Ibis / Accord. Functionally furnished and practical to use but with little evidence of their five star rating. To add to our frustration the bathroom had a blue light system that was activated when used at night. The only problem was that when you put your foot out of the bed the light would be triggered. A minor point, but it's the first five star hotel  where I have been offered  breakfast cereal in cardboard boxes.",3,2015,05,17
37,Lovely stay at convenient location,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and had a great experience.  The hotel staff and concierge in particular were considerate and helpful, suggesting hip and delicious restaurants and even coordinating us VIP access to visit the W Hotel Bar in Barcelona to enjoy the ocean view.  During our stay, I had a birthday and the hotel kindly sent a surprise bottle of sparkling wine and strawberries to our room. Overall, I highly recommend this property.",5,2015,05,13
37,Excellent hotel at perfect location!!,Our stay at this hotel was really amazing. The room is very nice and comfortable. The hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. It's located at perfect place. The street is so crowded all the time and you can get everything in a moment walk. Everything is perfect!!!,5,2015,05,12
37,after cruise visit to Barcelona,After a transatlantic cruise we spent 1day in Barcelona to see the sites The hotel staff were very helpful in getting us where we needed to be. We chose Le Meridian because it was in the center of  Las Ramblas and we could walk to most places. The rooms were clean and nice and we had a great time,5,2015,05,11
37,Great Location,"Le Meridien is on La Rambla, so right in the heart of Las Ramblas.  The beds are comfortable and they had the best bathroom with a TV (which we never used).  The complimentary breakfast is great with made to order omelettes.  We also had tapas in their restaurant, also good.",5,2015,05,11
37,Dinner,"Went for dinner there on 8th May, had a great 3 course set price, the food was excellent, the service great and I become an SPg member so can't be bad, will revisit again, point out great service from a young girl with glasses very sweet and an asset",5,2015,05,10
37,Very Nice Hotel,"I really enjoyed my vacation stay at Le Meridien Barcelona.  It is centrally located off Las Ramblas with many choices of restaurants and shops, all in a quick walking distance!  The hotel was clean and the service was friendly and pleasant.  Everyone was willing to help out (I had some internet connection issues that were dealt with immediately). The housekeeping staff was friendly and courteous.  Everything about this stay was wonderful!  My only slight complaint is that the mattresses are too soft (perhaps too old). There were 6 people in my party and everyone said the same about the soft mattresses, where you kind of sink into the middle of the bed. By Day 3, our backs were hurting.  If they upgrade the mattresses, this place gets five stars !!",4,2015,05,09
37,Great Location. Great Service,"We are Starwood Gold members and have stayed at several SPG hotels around the world. This is one of the best. It is situated in a fantastic location right on the wonderful Rambla and only a couple blocks from the Plaza Catalonia. The staff greeted us like we were old friends. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The Concierge, Bruno, booked two tours for us and he was not only knowledgeable, but willing to spend whatever time we needed to make sure we got the best deal for what we wanted to see. Altogether, a very positive experience.",4,2015,05,09
37,Lovely Central Hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this super central hotel right on La Rambla. The location couldn't be better, right next to the divine Boqueria Market and just across La Rambla from the Gothic Quarter and Barcelona Cathedral. Our room had a lovely view of the bustling street below but was not too noisy, our bed was amazing (especially after a long flight). Theirs was one of the best hotels breakfasts I've had - the omelettes and cured meats are to die for. Thoroughly recommend.",5,2015,05,06
37,A very comfortable option in the utter center of Barcelona,"Overall I really enjoyed this hotel and would probably stay here again unless I found a really great deal at a comparable place.

Location
The hotel is right in the middle of Las Ramblas (the main artery for Barcelona) and very close to the metro.  From here you can get to anywhere you would want to go in the city in basically about as fast as you would want.  In particular, it's a great location if you want to walk to the sites.  The noise from Las Ramblas is muted because you are on a side street.  This is definitely the hotel's greatest strength.

Service
The service is very professional.  The hotel deals with a large number of tourists from all over the world and the staff is focused on keeping things running.  Don't expect to get into some deep conversation about the desk clerk's favorite local sports team, but you will get checked in on time, your room will be clean, you will be seated at breakfast, etc.

Amenities
If you have SPG status, choose the free breakfast since the hotel's buffet is terrific.  I do not believe there is a club lounge, but if there is we did not make use of it.  The wi-fi is free with status and perfectly adequate.  The gym is solid by unexceptional.

Rooms
The rooms are very nicely appointed in the highest trim for the Le Meridien brand.  We were lucky enough to receive an upgrade to a suite, which had a separate bathroom (with a TV in the mirror)! and a lot of space.  The room did back up on a service area which meant we got a lot of noise from doors slamming, beds coming in, etc.  All in all worth it though for the nice upgrade.

Conclusion
If you are an SPG member, this is your best bet for Barcelona (the W is goofily out of the way and expensive so don't stay there unless you are a pro athlete or a celebrity who will just be taking a limo around anyway).  If I did not have SPG status, I would probably shop around but consider this hotel strongly still.",4,2015,05,05
37,Enjoying our 10th yrs wedding celebration,"During the booking period we chose this location only because it is on the Rambla but during our stay we felt as being at home, the staff has been very kind and taken care of all our requests including our 3yrs baby.",5,2015,05,05
37,Wonderful experience,My wife and I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel end of April and were very pleased with our experience. The location is unbelievable but the best part was staff attitude. Whether it was the front desk or concierge it was the extra effort that made the difference. In general the rooms were modern and well maintained.,5,2015,05,05
37,Great location and friendly staff !,"We spent 5 nights in this hotel in mid-April 2015.  It was our first time in Barcelona.  We were very happy with our selection of hotel .  The location couldn't be any better...right on Las Ramblas.  And a very short (5 minute) walk to the square where you can catch a hop on/off bus tour or the metro.  

We had a nice big room....with the bed separated from the living area by french doors.  It was very clean and comfortable.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful (thanks for everything, Xavi!).  They were very patient with us as we practiced our Spanish and gave us great recommendations for places to eat.

If we ever get to go back to Barcelona, we will surely stay here again.",5,2015,05,03
37,Location is amazing!,"The location of this hotel is amazing -- just off of Las Ramblas, but in the heart of all of the action.   We had a first floor, street-view room, but because the hotel is on a side street, we could not hear all of the noise of Las Ramblas.   

Pros:  Free wi-fi, a nice big bathtub that is deep enough for soaking, and large closet and in-room safe.

Cons:  It was very awkward to get into the very high shower and tub, the bed was extremely low and not that comfortable, and most of the power outlets were on a main switch, so when the lights were out, your phone and iPad wouldn't charge.",3,2015,05,03
37,MEDIOCRE,"As a lifetime platinum member I think I have a decent frame of reference having logged more than 1000 nights in spg hotels around the world including this chain.  

Overall the hotel is up to spg standards but falls short in the following areas:
- no complementary water provided for platinum guests so you are stuck with the mini bar
- terrible bed.  It's not comfortable,  the springs dug into my back.  Frankly for this chain I was shocked.  
- service in the restaurant is hit and miss.  I dined there a couple of times and you really have to chase the staff down to get a drink or a water refill.  Seems they don't appreciate being interrupted by guests who are there to spend money.  However the food is excellent.  ",3,2015,05,03
37,Outstanding hotel in outstanding location,"Thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights there. Staff seriously helpful. PR manager Ana arranged an impromptu Paella cookery lesson which was the perfect send off. Rooms were modern, trendy and functional. Stumble out of the lobby into the major thoroughfare with endless little streets, surprising squares and individualistic shops - not full of generic Zara's, H&Ms etc (tho these are available nearby). Couldn't think of a way for this hotel to improve!",5,2015,05,02
37,"Centrally located, helpful staff - but a few caveats","You're not going to get a better center-of-the action location than this hotel. Situated just of La Rambla much of what Barcelona has to offer (and it's a lot) is right at your fingertips. Food, bars, access to public transportation, street performers, touts, the lot. And the staff is pleasant and helpful. It's what you would expect from a Meridien.

But there a few caveats: as I've said before, I think it fair to grade ""on the curve"" - you wouldn't judge a 3-star hotel on 5-star standards. By that token the hotel leaves a bit to be desired.

The bathrooms are poorly designed. I'm far from being a prude, but this trend towards ""open"" bathrooms where privacy is sacrificed to design needs to be resisted. Just because you are traveling with someone doesn't mean that every intimate physical act needs to be on display and the frosted glass walls of the bathrooms here come awfully close to that - especially with the toilets right up against them. The tub/shower combo is also dangerous with a 3 foot hurdle to overcome to reach the (slippery, tiled) floor below.

I also believe that in this day and age WiFi is like electricity and water - it's just part of the infrastructure that all hotels should provide and while this one has a free ""tier"" its network performance is abysmal. You shouldn't have to pay extra for a ""premium"" network just to get decent network connectivity.",4,2015,04,29
37,Great place to stay,Found this lovely hotel by chance and we are very happy we did. Rooms clean and bright and staff very nice.There restaurant is very good offering very nice meals at very reasonable prices. YOu are close to all attractions extremely good location. Bars and restaurants just across street. You are in the heart of Barcelona just off Ramblas. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,04,27
37,"Great location, nice staff, clean rooms and modern facility","My wife and I enjoyed our short stay at the Meridien in Barcelona. The location is great, walking distance to major touristic spots or metro stations. The staff, specially the concierge were very cordial, and helpful. We found the rooms to be clean and equipped with good facilities.",4,2015,04,27
37,PROUDLY MAINTAINING HIGH Le MERIDIEN STANDARDS,"I visit Barcelona frequently but this was a return visit to this Hotel for quite some time. I have always found the Le Meridien Brand exceptional when I have stayed in their Hotels and this one operated by the Starwood Group was no exception.
Speedily welcomed by efficient friendly Bellboy my luggage was taken and we were shown to Reception. Efficient friendly receptionist made us feel most welcome and although we had arrived quite early our suite was ready and we were shown to it immediately and our bags were  already there.
Le Meridien is situated right on the famous Rambles and and is first class location for visiting all the well known landmarks and only a short walk from the Placa des Anglais with its wonderful shopping and Restaurant facilities. Starwood have obviously spent a lot of time and money upgrading the facilities of the Hotel since I last stayed with a dedicated Executive floor, a first class Spa and rooftop leisure facilities. The Coffee Shop adjoining the foyer has been upgraded and is a pleasant place to relax and people watch. 
The Hotel restaurant !)! is good value with a comprehensive menu and definitely worth a visit and I strongly recommend the morning Buffet breakfast which is superb. 
All in all consistency key word everything carried out to a high standard by competant ,well trained helpful staff. .",5,2015,04,22
37,Dine and wine,"Nicely located, at the same time very well isolated from outside noise.
Helpful staff, and the breakfast Bar has the best fresh fruit juice, carrot ginger and green apple! And of course crunchy croissant.
The hotel entrance not siuted for luggage, but the young porter took care , same as in Barcelona! 
",4,2015,04,22
37,Excellent Location & Comfortable Room,"This was our third time back to this Le Meridien and it did not disappoint. We disembarked a cruise ship early in the morning and the front desk worked diligently to accommodate our early check-in. We were recognized as SPG Gold and appreciated the free wifi. The rooms are compact, but comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are great! You just cannot beat the location.",4,2015,04,21
37,Location & service make it a wise choice,"Spent 2 nights here in April 2015 after disembarking from a cruise.  We arrived at the hotel before 10 a.m. and the front desk was able to find us a room after a very short wait, and a delicious coffee.  The location, as many others have stated is very convenient and the staff was welcoming, friendly and helpful.   We had drinks at the bar and ate at the restaurant one evening and were pleased with the food and drink, along with the service.",5,2015,04,20
37,Perfect location,"Very nice hotel in a perfect location on the Ramblas. Easy to go all over Barcelona from there by train or taxi.  In fact, we could walk to a lot of popular spots. Helpful hotel staff. Only negative was spotty internet connection.",4,2015,04,18
37,"Comfortable rooms, good location, weak service","Stayed 4 nights this week with husband & children.  Hotel is in a perfect location to walk to most Barcelona attractions & the beach.  Rooms were comfortable and nicely decorated.  We paid to upgrade to a suite after the 1st night for more room.  Lovely view.  

Unfortunately, the service was just not very good.  A lot of little things that added up to an experience that was not guest focused.  No bath towels in the room, broken elevator but no notices posted, rude front desk clerk, very high cost for rollaway bed (€55).  On our last night, housekeeping closed up the sofa bed my son was sleeping on and took away all of the linens ... Then it took 45 minutes and 2 separate visits for someone to resolve the issue at midnight - not ideal with very tired children.  

So, I know these are all small things - but it adds up to a series of annoyances that could all be avoided by a staff that cares about guests' comfort.  
",3,2015,04,18
37,Location Location,"This is the 2nd time I stay at the hotel, and I have to say its localion and convenience still makes it a great place to stay when you visit Barcelona. It is close to the airport shuttle (A1) stop, the subway and bus stations. You are within minutes walk from the Farmers Market, grocery stores, the cathedral, and many of the sight seeing spots. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are comfortable, though a bit dated. I did not eat at the restaurant at the hotel because of the many Tapa places available and of course the food stalls at the market. Be careful when you go out at night because my son got pick-pocketed right outside the hotel and lost his Galaxy phone (although I have to say it was 2am in the morning). I love this city and will probably come back to this hotel again when I visit Barcelona next time!",5,2015,04,17
37,The Staff Shines,"Both we and the staff at Le Meredien Barcelona were surprised when SPG's Concierge service messed up our reservation at the height of the European holiday travel season, booking us for 2 people instead of 3.  Somehow, though, Assistant Manager Salvador Batlle and his team found us an extra room at a great rate, and treated us very well throughout our stay.  In addition, their bartender in CalOnze is outstanding.  His craftsmanship is admirable, and the results are delicious.  Of course, the location of the hotel is excellent.",5,2015,04,16
37,This place got everything right,"This is a modern business hotel right on La Rambla, so there were countless activities within easy walking distance.  It was easy to access public transportation, or a taxi if you needed one.   The staff here is friendly, professional, and multi-lingual.  We needed to exchange some currency, and they easily accommodated us, but also offered alternatives in the City where we could get a much better exchange rate.",5,2015,04,12
37,Like Sleeping on a Giant Marshmallow!,"I stayed here for one night whilst on a business trip. The room was fantastic and had the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in. Unfortunately I only got to sleep in it for a few hours. That's the legacy of being there on business I suppose. The location is great, very central and was within 5 minutes walk of the office. Barcelona is a beautiful city and this hotel makes a great base for exploring it. ",4,2015,04,11
37,"Location, design and service","Perfectly located on the Ramblas, tastefully designed and high level service. Room spacious and elegant. Tv screen embedded in the bathroom mirror. Excellent breakfast although choice is narrow. Helpful concierge. Soft spot is thin walls so you hear your neighbors. Room quite cold at night (april). We got a great family suite. Expensive",5,2015,04,09
37,"Location, Location, Location","With the good comes the bad.
Best location in Barcelona.
But  the cost of being on Las Rambas is the noise!!
We heard singing and laughter until 6 am from the street! 

The heat in the room didn't work. The hotel tried to fix it- but we were freezing.

We are a family of 5. So our kids room- for 3 consisted of a king bed and a pull out single bed from a couch.
The bed was awful. We requested a regular cot- but the hotel did not have any.

On positive side- the hotel was not expensive- staff tried very hard to accommodate and the location was excellent ",3,2015,04,08
37,Best hotel for my whole trip to spain,"We stayed only 1 night in Le meridien barcelona for our last day in barcelona,when we check in the hotel lobby is looks small the staff remind us to watch our luggage as we check in earlier and the room not ready yet,the receptionist staff is very friendly and helpfull he help me to bring our luggage when we check out and arrange a Taxi for us to the airport.The room was also very good they have  shower,bathtub and small television in the bathroom.The bed is also comfortable and wifi work very well. Breakfast is also excellent there are so many various choice.The hotel itself located in la ramblas street in a very strategic location,close to the shop,restaurant and as we are moslem it is very easy to find a halal food either turkish or arabian food around the hotel with reasonable price,if you walk to the right from the hotel about 1 km you can see a beautifull sea (port of barcelona)and there are so many yatch park there,and there are one small shopping mall in the same direction that open in sunday.overall this hotel is highly recommended",5,2015,04,06
37,"Incredible hotel, location and staff","We stayed for 4 nights on an 8 night european vacation. First part was in Paris then Barcelona. We really can't recommend this hotel enough. We emailed them in advance with questions, everything was answered right away. We took the blue aerobus from the airport which they recommended and it went right to the hotel for 6 euros a person. When we arrived and checked into our room, it was very hot. We had requested an upgrade as an SPG member but were told there were none when we got there (celebrating special experience). They did send us a bottle of champagne which was very nice. We went out for the day, and put the air conditioning on low, but when we got back, we realized how hot the room was and called downstairs, we were told that the air condition was not on yet. It was a seasonal thing, they felt bad and said the entire hotel didn't have air conditioning until their spring season started which would be any day now.  I ended up speaking with Supervisor Jose Gomez. He immediately transferred us from our room to a top room with a terrace and incredible view of the city. We slept with the terrace doors open at night which made the room very cool and comfortable, the air then went on halfway through our stay and is now on for the remainder of the year. We were thrilled. From that day on, Jose chatted with us each day, made sure we were enjoying our stay, gave us advice, introduced us to others in the hotel that could give us recommendations and ALWAYS had a smile on his face. This hotel and location is fantastic but Jose really made our stay. He should be commended for his customer service and professionalism. 

The rest of the staff and the concierge service were phenomenal. They made reservations for us, helped us buy tickets to all of the sites and it was great! AMAZING LOCATION again!",5,2015,04,03
37,"Excellent staff, superb location","I've just returned from a four night break with a friend. We shared a room, facing the back of the hotel which has an ""interesting"" view of walls of adjacent buildings, but this didn't bother us as the room was spacious and comfortable with one of those brilliant dinner-plate size showers. Especially excellent was the concierge, Bruno, who gave us invaluable advice about where to go and what to see and showed genuine interest in making our stay an enjoyable one. Other staff were also most friendly and helpful. The hotel booked us tickets for the popular sights so you don't have to waste time in queues. This was my first time in Barcelona and I'd highly recommend this hotel. The buffet breakfast was delicious with a wide range of foods. Just across the street is a very good restaurant which seems to be popular with locals and was reasonably priced, although busy (a good sign!)",5,2015,04,02
37,Good location,this is a great location - right infront of the plaza close to shops cafes restaurants and the food hall.  The reception was great - I had quite a large  delivery from Holland and this was stored and later brought to my room with no fuss. They arranged a large taxi at departure and paid regular rate with no surcharge .,4,2015,04,01
37,excellent localization,"The hotel has a perfect localization! You can go by walking to many cool places, very nice restaurants, markets and to the Barceloneta! You also can rent a bike and go everywhere. We stayed here for 4 days, and the breakfast was very nice also.",5,2015,03,29
37,Very Disappointed,We stayed here last week on a family spring break vacation for 5 nights.  I am Platinum with starwood as I stay over 120 nights per year with starwood.  I had arraigned for 2 rooms and after checking in we were shown to our rooms which faced the busy street below.  The A/C was not working so we were forced to leave our windows open.  The hotel offered fans which we accepted but they were also noisy when turned on.  Throughout Spain we had stayed only at Starwood--The Westin Palace in Madrid and the Alfonso XIII in Seville.  Both of which were fabulous.  Needless to say we were beyond disappointed.  The hotel has a great location in the heart of the city right off La Ramblas but the rooms are nothing to write home about.  Even though we had 2 rooms that we were paying for we were only given breakfast for one--2 people when there were 4 of us.  This did not occur at the other hotels in Spain.  I spoke to the manager on duty but got no where.,3,2015,03,28
37,"Fantastic location in the heart of Barcelona, well run hotel","The location right on Ramblas is fantastic.  You can walk out in any direction and get to good restaurants, interesting cultural tourist attractions and lots of people walking.  You are located in the center of the city and while there is a subway system we decided to walk even to locations 1-2 mi away and it was a great way to see the city.  La Rambla has many people walking on it at all hours but there are no side walk cafe/bar's next to Le Meridien so my sleep was not disturbed even though I was only on the 2nd floor.  The gym was adequate with 3 treadmills which I used every day.  The breakfast buffet was very good and stays open until 11AM which is good as this is a late night city. Some parts of the buffet were excellent (seeded breads) and the rest was very good with attentive service. We were in a suite which was very comfortable, bed was good and pillow choice was good.  Concierge was helpful to get tickets to a local event.",4,2015,03,28
37,Improved Stay after Hiccup in this Expensive Hotel,"Shortly after arrival, we were prepared to ditch the Meridien Barcelona. The typically small European hotel room seemed dusty and moldy, largely with respect to the room's carpeting. We complained about scratchy throats within minutes of getting into the room, we got on the phone with the folks who made our reservation, and wanted to move to another hotel. We were stuck, however, because we prepaid the hotel. The hotel offered to vacuum furiously to make the room acceptable for the night, then move us into a new room the following day after deep cleaning the carpet and replacing the sheets with hypoallergenic sheets. The new room also had a better view. The difference was enormous, making the stay a pleasant one. The staff was generally helpful, and the location terrific on La Ramblas, but we will consider other choices the next time we go to Barcelona.",3,2015,03,27
37,"Good, quality place right on Rambla","stayed here for 1 night on a business trip; got upgraded to a suite, which you can't complain about :-) Overall a good hotel, although with a couple of small annoyances.
So the suite was really a nice room; spacious - as one can expect - with a nice view, very nicely decorated - modern, a lot of wood, a bit of modernism and tradition put together to a really pleasing mix. Only the bathroom was the typical (?) palace-like style, which I really don't like... But it was big and i don't spend too much time in the bathroom anyway...
A very nice view to the city, and you can open the windows which is something I can't live without, so great too.
Things I didn't like: the palace-like bathroom decor; iphone speakers not working in the leaving room; wall current plugs in the bedroom switched off by the lights switcher (i.e. when I turned out the lights at the bedroom, the power plug stopped working too and I woke up with the phone battery still at 28% :-/ ); strange arrangement of wardrobes - there was no place to hang my jacket in the 'entry area' even though there was a wardrobe there; the only hangers wardrobe was in the bedroom... go figure...
all of these are not even close to serious of course and since I was upgraded, I didn't mind too much; but had I paid full price for the suite I'd be disappointed for sure...
there's free wifi in the hotel for all the guests (in public areas as well as in the rooms), but I chose the 'superior' option for 19,50€ and indeed can't complain about the connection speed. It is also setup in such a way that you don't have to login to it everytime you close/open a device (which it is so in many other places and I absolutely hate it there). For this price I also had it work on all 3 of my devices, which is not always the case neither.
I very much enjoyed the adjacent CentOnze restaurant.",4,2015,03,24
37,Excellent food and service,"We took a group of 20 Hospitality students for afternoon tea on a busy Saturday. The food and service were excellent. The management team even took time out to chat to our group
about carrier  opportunities. Thank you Carme, Miguel and Chef, you inspired ups.",5,2015,03,24
37,Great hotel in the heart of central Barcelona ,"I stayed in a small suite. The hotel is completely updated and is very nice. The central location is perfect for shopping or just wandering. 

The city bus tours are close by for those who want to get an overall feel for the city before booking individual tours. 

The staff was very nice and the concierge was particularly helpful. 

Around the corner there are 3 quiet outdoor bistros with nice inexpensive drinks. 

Definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,03,21
37,A very good hotel at the best location,"Location was my priority when it was time to choose an hotel in Barcelona and I wasn't disappointed. The location is just perfect. Everything around is so spanish you have a lot of bar restaurant shops and everything is easy to access by foot or metro.
The hotel is a good chain hotel it is not a Palace but everything is professional. the bedroom is large and quiet and Clean.
A very good address especially for the address",4,2015,03,20
37,Great Location and Service,"Stayed for a week on a business trip. The meeting rooms were well laid out and everything worked. Refreshments were very good and copious. The rooms had good facilities, big TV (lots of channels but the only English channels were news channels), good bath/ shower etc. The bed was too soft for me, but plenty of room. We had a 3 course lunch provided each day from a set menu, lots of fish, which I don't eat, but the staff were only too happy to offer chicken, pasta or vegi alternative. Far too much food. A couple of events were also orgainised within the hotel for team building, I can not fault the hotel on this.",4,2015,03,19
37,Birthday in Barcelona,"I celebrated my 50th Birthday in Barcelona and stayed at Le Meridien. The staff were very attentive and helpful but not pushy. The room was fairly basic but the bed was comfortable and and the facilities adequate. Without it being mentioned, the receptionist noticed that it was my birthday and had a bottle of bubbly put in our room.",4,2015,03,17
37,More than just a hotel..,"Yes it is centrally located.. Yes it is a Starwood Hotel, so expect proper rooms and proper atmosphere.. yes it is a Le Meridien.. But... it is one of the exceptional places where you are indulged by a group of employees who take pride in their work.. Thanks Le Meridien Barcelona.. For everything you have put together..",5,2015,03,17
37,"Second visit at Le Meridien, a much better experience","My wife and I decided to go back to Barcelona and give Le Meridien hotel a second chance. Our last stays in November 14 were tainted with irregularities not expected from such a renowned hotel (see my other comment from November). 
Just home from Barcelona and our stay at Le Meridien for the weekend I am happy to say that the hotel and its staff indeed showed themselves from the best possible perspective.  As I said in my last comment, “good staff and unbeatable location” – I have to be more precise this time - the staff at the hotel was from reception to housekeeping an example of smiles and good service, just perfect in every aspect of the word. Location cannot be better; the hotel is situated just in the middle of everything, and a short walk to the subway, which is an excellent way of transporting yourselves around Barcelona. Barcelona’s biggest and in my opinion best food marked is just 5 minutes down the street, and there is easy access and walking distance to some of the best restaurants in town.
The hotel is nevertheless in need of a little redecoration. Bathrooms are new and nice, reception and spa area quite nice, but the rest of the interior needs a little love and care to keep up the appearance.  Breakfasts were this time included, and were as expected compared to similar hotels with the same rating in Spain. Cleaning were good, beds and lining good and room service effective.  
Would we come again? Yes, I think so. One of the most important things for me when evaluating a hotel is how the staff behaved and treated us as guests. I have worked several years with hotels and restaurants and can easily decide within a short time whether the establishment is well run or not, Le Meridien Barcelona is well run indeed.
We are foodies and had a reservation at Tickets again. The best way to describe the experience is: pure happiness and joy, do try to get a table – OR go to San Sebastian for a wonderful  pintxos experience first (and eat at Akelarre). Another very good restaurant experience was restaurant Can Majo at the beach. This Michelin restaurant is renowned for its seafood and baby squids, oysters and seafood paella were enjoyed with a very good cava and superb service, recommended – you have to make a reservation in advance, serves lunch outside if weather permits.
Bilbao Berria just across La Rambla from the hotel and down towards the church, is also a nice pintxos place if you are in the mood, and who isn`t?",4,2015,03,17
37,Perfection Location,Great location and enjoyed our stay. Our room was modern and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was great. Professional staff. High suitable for families. Close to metro and hop on/off bus. Highly recommend.,5,2015,03,17
37,Location location,"great located hotel in heart of ramble street.  Close to everything in Barcelona.  Rooms were comfortable.  Breakfast was good, but rest of food was ok.  Bar in hotel was a bit pricy, but there is so much around no reason to drink and eat here.  Rooms were quiet so no need to get off street.",4,2015,03,13
37,Perfect Location,"This hotel is your average 4 star hotel it has all the amenities you need plus good food. What I love the most about it is the location. You get the beautiful beach, shopping center and it is next to a casino if you like to do some gambling.",4,2015,03,11
37,Great hotel in perfect location,"Everything about this hotel is just perfect; the service you get since you enter the hotel, professional staffs who handle all you need (from posting your postcards, luggages, luggage store for your extra luggage that you don't need to carry to the room, or any complaints you have about the room), location (the best in Barcelona!), and rate for breakfast which is very good for what they provide. Bed is also perfect, and the room was, surprisingly, very modern in spite of its very old and classic exterior of the hotel.
Of course that's what you need to pay, as this is a 5 star hotel, and that's the reason the price is not that cheap. But, after checking out from some lousy hotels for the last 9 days with my tour around Spain, I was so happy to finally find 'a real hotel with full service'.",5,2015,03,07
37,Nice place in a nice location,"Personally, I was expecting something more for the cost of the room.
Due to the good location of the hotel, the prices are too high comparing with other Sheratong hotels.
Rooms are very beautiful, but with a very small window to the back side.",3,2015,03,06
37,Great access to heart of city,Very well positioned to give you access to most popular streets and district in Barcelona!  Great location if you want to avoid taxis and public transport. Conciergerie services are just excellent and very friendly despite the very late check in time (3pm) and the bit expensive rates. Overall satisfying package,4,2015,03,03
37,excellent location,"We stayed here fro 3 nights in January and it was very comfortable although not quite 5 star. The reception and bar area are not particularly welcoming or impressive but the rooms are well appointed if a tad small for this class. Breakfast was nice with a wide choice and the freshly-cooked omelette was delicious. There is an impressive work of art hanging the full height of the many storeyed cast iron staircase which I am told is a Gaudi installed by the artist himself many years ago. Don't worry there is also a lift ! The nearby galleries of modern art are worth visiting and we were given a free entry voucher by the hotel which we appreciated,",4,2015,03,02
37,Excellent location,"What a great hotel, would come back here ANY day!

I booked this hotel directly through the SGP app and got a good rate. Then a few days before my arrival I got an email from the hotel offering to pre-purchase breakfast, which made it an even better deal.

After arrival at Barcelona airport I took a taxi to the hotel, the driver knew where it was and if I remember correctly it was about 30-40 EUR for the trip. At the hotel there was a bellman waiting for me to help me with my luggage.

Check in was smooth & friendly, there was no one in front of me and with a smile and a room upgrade I was off to my room. I had to take a very small & narrow elevator to my floor but it was perfectly suited for 1 guest and 2 suitcases.

The room was excellent, there was a desk/lobby at the entrance of the room. Besides the desk/lobby area was the entrance to the bathroom which was fully equipped. The bathroom did have a bath as well.

Going straight from the desk/lobby was were the bedroom was situated. It had a big 2 seater couch, salon table, big tv and a very comfortable Kingsize bed. The view from the bedroom was limited, it looked out to the back of the hotel (not the Ramblas) and I could only see some other buildings.

After arrival I got changed in my running gear and I did an hour run, which took me to the beach promenade for quite a while, beautiful scenery and lots of people outside even though it was fresh for Barcelona standards.

I had dinner in the restaurant across the road, which had great tasting food & was very reasonable priced.

Check out went well (no errors on the bill & fast)

Would definitely come back here again.",5,2015,03,01
37,Maybe on the lower 4's except for the 5-star price,"One night stay over a business trip. Asked for a king bed, got a twin. Typical 4 star room with no more than average bed linen and by the way, poor bed. It's that kind of hotel where you can see savings are everywhere. No turn down service. Free internet wifi is SO slow that it's no more than a trap to get you choosing the paid wifi. Lots of better offers around in Barcelona for less price.",3,2015,02,25
37,"Great location, excellent service","Right off La Ramblas, near Placa de Catalunya (very easy to take the bus from the airport here), and easy access to the Metro, make this a perfect location for seeing all of Barcelona. Very clean, modern, consistent internet - no complaints!",5,2015,02,24
37,Perfectly located and very friendly,"The Meridien is perfectly located on the upper side of La Rambla, a few minutes away from Corte Inglese and the Gaudi Museum. 

The rooms are nice, sound proff from the noise of the street below, and clean.

I must say that the team at the reception was one of the friendliest, nicest and most helpful that I have crossed in a long time, and my congratulations go to Jose who proved a perfect welcoming party!

Nice buffet beakfast, agreable bar wth a good choice of cocktails. In two words, a very nice, quaint and well managed hotel. I'll come again.

Why did I then not rate it as ""Excellent"". Only because I find that the choice of furniture, whether in the bar or in the rooms, look cheap and cold, Not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. No fresh flowers at reception, no ""special attention"" in the luxury room. The sort of encironment you would expect from a 4 star hotel. But tis seems to be the trend at the Meridien chain as the one in London is just as bad. I look forward to a new decorator!

Other than that, great job.",4,2015,02,23
37,Nice hotel.,"We were very pleased with Le Meridien.  The room was a decent size.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  The best feature is its' location.  Situated right on Las Ramblas!  I only have two complaints.  One is that breakfast was not included in the price.  The other is that we were charged for something that we did not use.  They immediately removed the charge when we reported it, but I find it suspect that the other couple we traveled with had a similar situation where they found a charge on their bill that shouldn't have been there.    It could have been a coincidence that it happened to both of us, but I suggest you check your bill with a fine tooth comb when checking out!",4,2015,02,22
37,Le Meridien - Le Perfect,"Ok ok, yes I am SPG Platinum so I am always shopping the Starwood Brand, BUT, I am also very honest when it some to if the places on offer are the good, the bad and sometimes the very ugly. But this place rocks on the very heart of Barcelona on the main walking street of La Ramblas.

The hotel itself wears the brand image very well and has a great open feel lobby with that signature scent gently pumped through the air con vents to the background tracks from the latest music offerings. The hotel is old, but the team there has done a great job to keep the property, not only relevant, but well maintained.

My room was a good size with the separated lounge and dining areas in the suite, and a great oversized bed. The views looked down onto the side alley of La Ramblas with great views over the roof tops of the city. The bathroom has an amazing oversized shower for 2. 

They in room amenities was great, forget anything, no worries, they have it all already there awaiting you in the room and the in room coffee bar has the great offering of cappuccino which was a great treat every morning.

If your looking for a place that has great central location, modern and vibrant dining offerings, and the smell of boutiques in the air, this is the spot. Jump on into Le Meridien Barcelona",4,2015,02,19
37,Good - but not 5 star,"My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed the restaurant with its attentive staff and tasty breakfast, plus the room with a comfortable kingsize bed and an excellent bathroom.  Centrally located, everything is in easy walking distance.

But, when you return to the hotel after 4pm you find the coffee shop closed.  Reception is tucked away round a corner from the main door which itself is not too inviting.  No fresh flowers or other touches you would expect from a 5 star hotel. And on one afternoon when we returned to our room for a siesta at 4:15pm the cleaner was still working in it.  Not good.

These are my reasons for rating the hotel an excellent 4 star but not a 5 star.  ",4,2015,02,14
37,Just Perfect,"We booked a last minute weekend .. and all I can say it was just perfect .... !!! A big thanks to all the staff at the Le Meridien. ... All to often hotels fail due to poor attitude , but not this one ... there was a genuine warmth and keenness of all the staff to help we could not have asked for more !!! .... thanks again !!!!",5,2015,02,12
37,Great location and superb service,"This hotel is located in The Ramblas a main attraction in Barcelona, the staff is well trained and all are very kind and friendly. 
Perfect place if you want to walk and visit the main attractions in Barcelona.",5,2015,02,08
37,Long weekend in Barcelona,"Hotel is well situated, the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are a decent size and well equipped, but we did upgrade.
Be careful with the mini bar, Impicked a packet of nuts up to check them and they tried to charge us for them, so check your bill when checking out",4,2015,01,28
37,Very comfortable room. ,Rooms are very well appointed. Excellent bed. Good lighting. Excellent bathrooms. Breakfast fare is reasonable. The bar is a little pricey but the bar staff are very attentive and friendly. Great location in the city. ,5,2015,01,20
37,"Great location, well appointed","Le Meridien Barcelona is located right on Las Ramblas, just a 5 minute walk from Plc Catalunya.. Though for those of you trying to find the entrance from Las Ramblas, it's actually down the side street. If you walk down Las Ramblas and pass Starbucks, you've gone too far. 

The staff were very helpful and managed to quiet down a party next door at 3am (not so much fun to wake up to loud drunk people). 

We had a side facing room (it's not much to look at, but was quieter than Las Ramblas), and had our water replenished daily. The one challenge of the room was the frosted sliding glass door of the bathroom, which was very noisy (on it's rollers). It's not a problem, except if you have to visit the loo while your partner sleeps, and you end up waking everyone up due to the rumbling. 

We didn't bother with breakfast at the hotel, instead, taking advantage of coffee at the lobby coffee shop, and then wandering over to the mercado for breakfast. 

The wifi signal was decent, (not fast enough to stream videos, but could load multiple tabs at once), the room had a small wardrobe but no luggage valet (which was odd and meant that both of us had to open our suitcases on the floor - not ideal), and a random empty space between the mini fridge and the desk (the tv was mounted to the wall, so perhaps it used to be a tv stand?), which is where a luggage valet or something could've fit.",4,2015,01,15
37,Location + enjoyment,"We've been staying in Bracelona for a few days every time we travel from Singapore to Brazil and on the way back. This is definitely the best ho we stayed so far (we previously stayed at 1898, OHLA, Montecarlo and Central). The location is amazing and the room was extremely spacious for local standards. It's certainly our choice for the next trips.

+ Location
+ Room size
+ La Boqueria

- Not really a big negative point but I believe breakfast could be better.",5,2015,01,15
37,Very well located hotel,"So I am Platinum SPG, travel non-stop etc.  So here is my review.

We were there for a brief weekend while traveling EU.  The place is right in the middle of the action, a block away from the famous market in barcelona (where you need to go every day)...  The rooms are are great, the bed is great, the bar is small but great.  the bfast buffet is what you really want for fast on your way to experience Barca.  Count on the concierge and give him/her the heads up on what you want to do ahead of time... they will reach out to you through email, and do take advantage of that.  Once you get there, you will find that they are quite busy or your reservations cannot be honored because summer is busy in Barca.  So, plan ahead and send them what you want ahead of time over email.  They are very very good.

Front desk had a lot of trouble getting us in (along with several dozen other people) who arrived on the overnight from NY... So have a good nap on the plane and be ready to roam around while 3PM comes around and you may have a room ready... or get ready to be unimpressed with them.

Once you are in the room, all is grand and you will chill out and be ready for the sangria and the great stuff that is available in Barca.

Good time due to the rooms and the location...",4,2015,01,12
37,"No complaints whatsoever...GREAT location, great service!","I really can't think of anything I didn't like about this hotel. The location right on Ramblas was fantastic- close to so many little shops and restaraunts.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  My husband and I were there as part of an anniversary trip, and they gave us a free upgrade (don't know if that was intentional), so our room was incredible! Huge and overlooked the bustling Ramblas. I would definiately stay here again!!",5,2015,01,12
37,Best location in town for tourists,"This is a very modern hotel at a perfect location for tourists. It was on the corner of La Rambla and that is the most exciting street in Barcelona. The Metro station is only 100 meters away and the huge plaza where the ice skating rink is set up is only 200 meters away.

The rooms are modern with plenty of storage space. It had a big TV and the bath was great with a showere big enough for at least two with lots of nozzles.

The restaurant is one of the best in town and we had a great Christmas day brunch. The food and service was the best and well worth teying even if not staying in the hotel.

Some reviews say the street noise is a problem, I never even heard the street noise so do not worry.",5,2015,01,08
37,Great experience,"Location is excellent for exploring La Ramblas and all of the centre of Barcelona.
Close to metro, AeroBus, Plaza Catalunya and right on La Ramblas.
Service was excellent.
Amenities are very good.
I was staying in the hotel for 8 days so my room was a little small for a long stay but perfect for a weekend away, or if you don't intend to spend much time in the room.
Check out the views from the rooftop terrace.",4,2015,01,07
37,"Central location, clean and updated hotel","I'm platinum with SPG, and try to stay at SPG properties whenever we're on vacation. Le Meridien is one of my favorite SPG brands, and so I was looking forward to our stay. We arrived around 9am and they had our room ready for us on the spot. 

Location:
The hotel is right off Las Ramblas, which can be a blessing or a curse, depending upon how touristy you like to be on your vacations. We found the area a bit too crowded and bustling (we live in NYC and it's comparable to Times Square), but it was an easy walk to more local neighborhoods and the location was quite central. There was also a Carrefour (our favorite European grocery) right below the hotel for any essentials one might need. From our hotel, we easily walked to every other district including the Gothic Quarter, Sagrada Familia, Gracia, Eixample, Barceloneta, El Born, etc… 

Room:
Our room had a view of local apartments where old women were hanging laundry out to dry on a regular basis. It was nothing spectacular, but it was charming for what it was. The bedroom was on the smaller side, but suitable for our needs. The bed was typical of SPG properties, and the linens were pristine. There was also a large dressing room separate from the bedroom that was a big open space surrounded by closets, a floor-length mirror and the bathroom on one wall. We stayed for three nights and it was more than acceptable.

Staff:
So, SO friendly and accommodating. We arrived after a red-eye and the nice man manning the tiny coffee bar checked on us multiple times to ensure we liked our espresso, fruit and pastries. The front desk was hyper-efficient and nice, and the concierge was so quick to book dinner reservations and advice as to when and how to visit certain attractions. It was one of the best concierge experiences I've had in any of my stays -- both business and leisure. 

Overall, the Le Meridien Barcelona was a great place to stay, and we'd return again. Extra kudos to the staff who made it extra special.",4,2015,01,06
37,Just OK,"Standard room/2nd floor/Not facing the Ramblas.  Great location/base for exploring Barcelona.  This is an old/dense part of Barcelona so one should not expect light and airy - this is part of the ancient city center so get out and explore!  If one would like to sit in their room and enjoy the views, the Arts or W hotels are much better located for that.  Everything in room functions well, but in-room safe is way too small for anything but an iPad and door to room 228 does not fully close without giving it a good shove.  Lighting in room adequate but we never did figure out which light switches did exactly what in combination with the others - always a bit trial and error.  Reliable free Wi-Fi and good, easy to navigate TV complement the rest of the furnishings that one would expect of a hotel of this category.",3,2015,01,06
37,Wonderful Christmas holiday spent in Barcelona,"This Starwood property is conveniently located in the center of Barcelona.  The staff are friendly, and highly supportive.  The rooms are very clean and have all the modern amenities one could want, The meals that we had in the hotel dining room were wonderful (especially Christmas dinner). We would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a great hotel in Barcelona.",5,2015,01,05
37,Le Meridien Barcelona,"If you want to stay in a great hotel in the heart of Barcelona, Le Meridien is for you. Situated on the Ramblas (N° 111), it is within walking distances of the most popular areas of the city, the Cathedral, Plaça Catalunya, Passeig de Gracia, the University, El Born, The Boqueria food market, Plaça Real, etc...
Rooms are really nice and staff is very helpful and courteous.
One little frustration, last time I was there I had a room with a balcony overlooking the Ramblas, but the window was locked, impossible therefore to take advantage of the magnificent view...
Next door there is a Carrefour supermarket which from the outside does not look as huge as it actually is. Great for last minute food shopping in the very unlikely case you don't want to take advantage of the dozens of restaurants around the hotel.",5,2015,01,04
37,Great hotel in the center of rambla,"Very nice hotel, medium size rooms very clean, comfortable . 
The staff very friendly and helpful . A little bit  noisy due to pedestrian area but located in the heart of Barcelona. Location of this hotel is really unbeatable! Right on Las Ramblas and near a million tapas bars",4,2015,01,02
37,Chic Hotel in Fantastic Location,"This is a chic property just like many other Le Meridien hotels. The rooms were of decent size, but the bathroom was admittedly a tad small (no separate standing shower). We liked having the comfy balcony to take in the cold winter breeze as well. 

The best part of Le Meridien Barcelona was its location. Its right ON the popular La Rambla lane (filled with restaurants, cafes, snack and dessert stalls, and some shopping options), and next to it several other shopping boutiques as well as a large El Corte Ingles department store. Within a couple of minutes' walk you would be headed to the Catalunya metro station, which is one of Barcelona's main stations and key interchanges. You are also very near historical attractions like the Barcelona Cathedral (note that this is not the Sagrada Familia) and Gaudi's Casa Batllo and La Pedrera.

Because I was a SPG Gold Member, I was offered a (slight) complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe Room with the La Rambla view. However, I turned that down because I was concerned about the street noise (and looking from other reviews now, thankful that I did). Note that the only level up from a Deluxe Room is a suite, so it is unlikely for a Gold Member to be upgraded to a suite, especially since this is a fairly popular hotel.

Service here was top-notch, especially from the concierge, who was extremely helpful in calling the main hotlines to confirm our earlier attraction reservations (for Montserrat and Sagrada Familia). Thank you to the hotel too for the thoughtful champagne surprise for us, in celebration of our honeymoon! :)",4,2014,12,29
37,This is just ok,"The entry lobby is very compacted and very busy, it's does not give the impression of an upscale hotel nor does the room either.  It kept feeling like a somewhat better upgrade on an efficiency hotel like we have in the US.   The view from our window was gross, facing some old buildings and apartments, most in poor condition.  It was directly on Las Ramblas which was fun for getting into all the excitement and the street scene but chaotic as well.  The various nooks and cranny alleys were full of pleasant surprises, but I would pick another hotel next time.",3,2014,12,28
37,"Great location, but noisy!","I'd rate this hotel average-good. The location is great.. The room (a suite) was lovely with a wonderful view of the city. And I say its noisy for two reasons- firstly I could feel the metro rumble underneath you at all hours & secondly I could hear everything my neighbours were up to (noises which most people do not wish to be subjected to!) I stayed here while I was attending a conference, which wasn't close by to the CCCB, but close to everything else- markets, old town, shopping district, great restaurants. Hotel staff were all pleasant and breakfast was typical buffet but of decent quality.",3,2014,12,27
37,Phenomenal! ,"Right in the center of La Rambla, with the best service in all of Barcelona. The second night we came back(of course) for drinks, they recognized us and the service was as exquisite as the first night. Great cocktails and wine, with the most pleasant lighting. We had their arranged Christmas lunch on the 25th. The food was wonderful and they were very sweet to substitute the main course with vegetarian. Plus, the wine kept coming for a fixed reasonable price. 
The most pleasant staff who makes you feel at most welcome!
We will without a doubt be back for more. ",5,2014,12,26
37,"Good location, average F&B","If you are looking for location, you simply can't go wrong with Le Meridien Barcelona as the hotel is in the middle of where you want to be.  Staff is very attentive and cleanliness acceptable, everything in the room was in working order.   For American travelers that perhaps are a bit too picky, the room is a bit small for what we are accustomed to. However, the room meets the basic needs of a good 4 star hotel. Question to management, why upon arrival there were apples on the hallway where you place the newspapers, and then you never replenished the basket? consistency is an important part of hospitality...

We ate breakfast twice at the hotel and dinner once and again, the overall dining experience meets the basic needs.  I expected a bit more selection and variety for breakfast but quality of the food was good.  The breakfast experience was ruined by the waiter presenting the check before I even sat down to eat the food. Dinner quality was good, however we came down to eat perhaps too early and we were greeted by the hostess with a ""can I help you?"" which almost made me turn around and go eat else where...

Kudos to Vanessa from the front desk for an outstanding and very informative check in and to Marcus, the cook from the restaurant that made a great omelette and with his hospitality made up the discreet F&B experience we had.",4,2014,12,23
37,Superb Quality Hotel,"We stayed in one of the large top floor suites on a business weekender, the rooms and the views over the City were sublime at night, the design was really well done and the public spaces and dining were well considered and a pleasure to experience, if you've got the money and want to do it first class in Barca, this place is top notch. ",5,2014,12,23
37,Great hotel in the center of all the action,"Le Meridien Barcelona is a very nice, comfortable hotel in the center of the all the action.  All the shops, the Opera House, merchants, shows, museums everything is within walking distance from this hotel.  My room overlooked the La Rambla which is a kind of avenue with lots of street merchants.  A huge farmer's market is just a short walk away as well.  The hotel itself is very comfortable.  The rooms are pretty good size for European hotels.  The bathroom had a huge tub and really hot water.  Not much to watch on TV so if you're stuck at the hotel bring a good book.  They pretty much only get news and a documentary channel.  The hotel has a juice and coffee bar that was a nice stop on the way out in the mornings.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  There is Wifi.  You have to pay for premium speeds but the free wifi is adequate for checking and sending email.  Great place ton stay for sure!",4,2014,12,23
37,Technically 3star rating!,"Ok so here is why I rated this a 3 star... 

First star for location. Superb! Central! Walk to pretty much anything! Convenient!

Second star for their concierge Bruno! Nothing was too much trouble. Everything explained with patience and confirmed with efficiency. Great restaurant recommendations. 

Third star for their lobby staff... Very pleasant and helpful!

So why only 3 stars... Because the rooms are poor and the housekeeping even more poor! Simply put the rooms are not of the quality I have experienced at other meridien properties. Poor craftsmanship and design too. Poor quality furniture and fittings. Poor fixtures in bathroom - everything in the room shouted I am cheap!

And then the housekeeping... Recycled towels from floor every day and everyday we had to request changes. We'd come back to pretty much only the bed made up and a few things put away or rubbish thrown... Carpets were still dirty. Hair all over the bathroom and sink. Wet towels on rail. So sad for what claims to be a 5star property. 

We chose this place as were with kids and wanted something central. Next time I will go with what was my first choice.... Arts hotel and pay up for taxis! ",3,2014,12,21
37,"Great hotel, great location !","We stayed here 2 nights at the end of November. It was the perfect location ! great restaurant in hotel and many excellent restaurants just across the street as well !  
Walk out of the hotel and walk a couple hundred feet and u are on La Ramblas. 
Staff were friendly and very helpful in buying tickets for live flamenco. The rooms were very nice and quiet and the beds were extremely comfortable !!
On my previous trip to Barcelona I stayed in El Born which was great too, but this location was so close to everything...it was the perfect hotel for a short visit !",5,2014,12,21

37,What an Incredible Hotel!!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for several nights before to taking a cruise across the Atlantic. We are so glad we chose this property for several reasons. We could walk out the door and be on Las Ramblas, a fun and active part of the city filled with street vendors, local shops, churches and fascinating people. The property itself was amazing and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Our room included a large balcony that overlooked the city and the room itself was spacious and clean. Our rate included beakfast-which was a very big plus-since it was quite expensive otherwise. Breakfast did include Bloody Mary's and Mimosas, however, so for some the price might just be worth it! I would definitely recommend this property for the location, the service, and the quality and will choose it again next time I go to barcelona.",5,2014,12,18
37,"Great Hotel, great location, friendly staff","It took me quite a while in my online search until I found this hotel that is just perfect. 

In addition to the three merits I mentioned above, they have a very tasty breakfast buffet not to be missed! We also had dinner at the bar-restaurant place in the hotel & food was great😊! Don't miss the Catalonian lamb shoulder & the grilled seabass 

",5,2014,12,17
37,Great Location in Barcelona,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights prior to taking a cruise.  The location was awesome!  We could walk everywhere as it was one block off of Las Ramblas and just a few blocks from Gothic Quarter.  The concierge was so helpful in telling us how far everything was and if we should take a taxi to any of our destinations (the Sagrada Familia was the only time we took a taxi as our tours were early before the hop-on/hop-off bus started).  The hotel was clean, rooms were updated, and the public areas were inviting.  I would highly recommend the hotel if you are in Barcelona.",5,2014,12,15
37,Superb location on Las Ramblas,"My friend and I spent 4 nights in Barcelona. This hotel located in a prime location in the middle of Las Ramblas. The room was nice, amenities are high quality. Excellent WiFi. Highly recommend. We didn't try their breakfast because there are so many shops nearby the hotel.",5,2014,12,09
37,Chain hotel experience but adequate,"It's on the busy La Rambla and a stone's throw away from La Boqueria. It's a great place to station yourself in Barcelona as it is walking distance to the gothic quarter, the 2 Gaudi houses and many shopping streets. Lots of restaurants around too. 

The hotel and room wise, it's a typical business class hotel with everything you would need. Safe, ironing board, kettle with tea/coffee, bottles of water etc. But it's also very vanilla in experience. Generally, I would say its a good decent hotel!",4,2014,12,06
37,Outstanding Accommodations - A Real Gem on Las Ramblas,"I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.  Looks brand new. Large, super clean rooms and whisper quiet at night.  Excellent fast WiFI and work table in the room. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Even the hotel restaurant has great food.  Location is perfect downtown for walking to sights and shopping.  I've stayed in about 400 different hotels, and Meridien is in the top 10!",5,2014,12,06
37,Great location and staff somewhat undone by high style,"We recently stayed here for five nights and appreciated the superb location and consistent, warm, helpful service from staff.  Our room (345) lacked a view but it was quiet and clean with elegant finishes in red, white, gray and black.  

Our room's layout and design had the closet placed on the far side of the bedroom, distant from the door and the bath, and little drawer space.  Instead of a tub we had a huge shower with floor and walls of handsome slate tile and the bathroom features a frosted glass door and wall.   But, form trumped function on several fronts:  water leaked from the shower onto the floor and toilet activities were audible in the bedroom.

Our hotel breakfasts were excellent with freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh figs and memorable coffee brewed in French press pots.  There was no problem checking into our room early and we enjoyed people watching from the lobby.",4,2014,12,05
37,Barcelona visit,"Well located and well appointed hotel. Ideal position for exploring central Barcelona. The room was spacious and being located on a side street was less noisy than the busy Las Ramblas. Indeed, the double glazing was sufficient to eradicate any noise and so we had a peaceful night's sleep! The breakfast was very good.
We would recommend this hotel because of its amenities, the helpfulness of the staff and its central location.",4,2014,12,05
37,Great location but a bit tired,The hotel is perfectly located but my bathroom was pretty tired with a damaged bath and scratched sink. Being at the side of the hotel i did not notice any noise. The staff were very friendly and helpful  - the only criticism I would have on service was that check in was a very lengthy process due to the hotel being very busy ,3,2014,12,05
37,Dark & Dingy & Dusty,"The reviewers who complain about the shabby condition of the room furniture and carpeting and lighting are spot on.  We stayed for several days - based on the Le Meridien reputation in other cities - and were disappointed at the condition of the rooms.

The amenities in terms of shampoo and soap are poor.  Supposedly, there was a refurbishing recently but the only area that seemed to have been updated was the bathroom sink and shower and tile.  The rest of the room had broken shelving, lots of dust and impossible to read even a newspaper unless you had every light on in the room so it was like a hospital operating room along with a miner's head lamp.

All the ambiance and charm of Greyhound bus terminal.  

The front desk tried to upsell us to a room facing the Rambla with ""a view."" Based on reviews here we knew not to take the bait due to the noise.  Our room was quiet on the 5th floor but the view was of seedy tenements across the way.  Artwork consisted of a small print that looked like it was torn from an airline sales magazine.

Positives:  Though we did not eat at the hotel, it was difficult even getting a coffee in the morning as no one was staffing the bar, directly across the street is nice café operated by the Tragaluz group that has a number of well run restaurants in town.  La Luz serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with something for everyone - tapas, wood oven pizzas, salads along with a good breakfast choices at decent prices and coffee to start the day.

Also, the staff was pleasant in our limited dealings. Location is great, just off Rambla.  But the negatives far outweigh the good location.  We believe we can do far better will not return to this property when we next visit Barcelona.",2,2014,12,04
37,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and found it to be extremely accommodating and comfortable.  I used the concierge for several items including booking a massage when I arrived after an overnight flight.  They arranged it within an hour of my request (had to call someone to come in).  Also they arranged a private wine tasting tour at Oller Del Mas with a tapas tasting.  The driver arrived on time and we had an outstanding experience.  I found the wine selection at the hotel was excellent and the food was good too.  I had breakfast there each day and had tapas one evening for dinner.  All the staff was helpful and friendly.  I would certainly return if I am in Barcelona again.,5,2014,12,03
37,"An ""OK"" Property With a Great Location","My family and I stayed at the Le Meridien for 4 nights in November 2014.  We had 2 large interconnecting suites on the 8th floor of the hotel, both of which had large beautiful terraces overlooking Las Ramblas.  The view was incredible.  Both rooms were spacious and appointed nicely, but both were dirty and desperately needed to be professionally cleaned.  There were multiple stains on the carpets of both suites and the couches in both suites had very large stains on the cushions.  We only sat on the couches after laying clean bath towels on the cushions.  The bathrooms were not very clean - stains on the walls and dirty floors.

But beyond the cleanliness issue of the rooms, the staff were very helpful and friendly.  The location of the property cannot be beat, however.  All of the main attractions in the Gothic section and the waterfront of the city are in easy walking distance to the hotel.  Las Ramblas and all that it offers is right outside the hotel doors.  A great location with great staff.",3,2014,12,03
37,Friendly hotel in a great location,"My wife and I booked a 5 night stay using points to stay here.  We e-mailed the hotel ahead of time to request an early check-in as our arrival from the US would be around 11 a.m.  We got a response telling us that the hotel would be full the night before and it would not be possible.  We arrived around 11 and were told our room would be ready in 30 minutes.  We got a quick breakfast, returned, and our room was ready as promised.  That was a nice surprise.  You can't beat the location of the hotel--right on Las Ramblas, in the center of just about everything.  The staff was very friendly, always greeting us whenever we passed by.  The room was a bit small but we had a large balcony overlooking the city(room 818).   On two occasions we needed staff to come to our room(for ice and to show us how to use the espresso machine) and both times they arrived very prompt.  I really enjoyed this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,03
37,totally at ease,"i stayed here for 4 nights last week and i cant praise the hotel and staff high enough ,the rooms very fresh and super clean ,the shower was excellent no probs with preasure and water temp.the breakfast was cooked fresh and the bar was ideal for a quick snack,the rooms are totally soundproof and great security,the location was fine",5,2014,12,03
37,Outstanding location - hotel and staff,"I had the unfortunate request from my son to book him 3 rooms in Barcelona for his 18th with friends. As a platinum member of SPG I used points to book this hotel and It has to be said the communication from the hotel was outstanding.
The day my son was flying to Barcelona he dropped the bomb shell that there are now 7 going and not 6. I called the hotel to see if they could help and without question they had a camp bed placed in one of the rooms for me. As you can imagine 7 teenagers turning up to a respectable hotel is any parents worst nightmare. The hotel staff treated them like any other custom and couldn't do enough for them. 
Having been to this hotel previously I would highly recommend It for It's location within Barcelona, the hotel facilities and certainly the hard working staff.

Thank you again.

A very satisfied customer.

Regards

William Barrie",5,2014,12,03
37,Nice people,"I loved staying at the Meridien. We got a beautiful view and a nice clean room.

They helped us with any questions we had, and it was a great location.

I actually ended up getting food poising on our last day from a crappy restaurant and needed to stay in my room longer, which they were nice about.",4,2014,12,02
37,Excellent! Got what was expected,"The hotel was booked using points for an emergency stop over in Barcelona. The staff was friendly, and for a five-star class, I would rate it more towards the 4-start level. It was very nice and pleasant, but nothing out of t his world. It did the trick for that night but perhaps not worth $500+/night",5,2014,12,02
37,Location is the only positve aspect of this property,"I urge fellow travelers after reading my review to also look at some of the other negative reviews before booking.  Up front I am a fan of Le Meridian Properties in general.  That said this property has almost 20% of the reviews rating it average or below.  This is supposed to be a luxury hotel and it falls far below that level.  Worse yet if you read the managers responses to reviews you become aware there is not going to be a pleasant outcome if you have a problem at the property.  The manger needs to take a crash course in hospitality
The Room: I want to talk about my room because when you take a suite you expect to receive more than just additional room for a sofa and cocktail table.  The best I can describe Suite 717 is depressing.  The walls and carpet are dark grey.  There is not even padding under low quality carpet.  The room offers no warmth or comfort.  The lighting was the biggest issue.  It is very poor quality and not functional.   Not only is the room dark and gloomy but at night even with all four lights on the ambience is that of a horror film.  The toiletries are nonexistent and they have the dreaded soap dispenser in the shower with the mystery brand of soap.  I’m all for green friendly but I also want to know what product I am putting on my body.  If they are not ashamed of the product, label the dispenser.  The bathroom walls looked like they wipe dirt off the walls but didn’t do a good job.  Finally the tile in the bathroom is all spotted and stained.  It needs to be buffed and re-sealed.  I challenge the GM to visit that room at night draw the drapes turn on the lights and experience what the guest does.  Ms. Manger please don’t write in your response that you are sorry the décor did not suite my taste.  It would be merely a platitude given other guest reviews.  In other words respect what other reviewers have noted and take action.  Since it was a Meridian I did not think to read the reviews,  I have learned a valuable lesson. I am not even going to say much about the view other than it is poor because you need to keep the drapes drawn to keep private from the surrounding units.  My phones didn’t work and they supposedly serviced them only to find out when the manager called the following day to check the issue we were disconnected.  She never called back or sent someone up to fix the problem.  I was dumbfounded at the lack of concern.   I got out the ironing board and found it bent and difficult to use.  This goes back to my basic rule for hotels.  Did the maid check to see the TV’s, remotes and phones work.  Is the alarm clock turned off from the previous guest and are the amenities in good working order.
Noise: if you are sensitive you will want to know the subway rumbles under the hotel at all hours.
Food: the breakfast buffet is the same every morning and is a poor selection compared to other Le Meridian properties.  Would not recommend this property for price and value.",2,2014,12,02
37,It was OK,"Stayed here with my wife after visiting Madrid and staying at the Westin Palace.  Our experience at the Palace (another SPG property) probably made the Le Meridien less memorable due to the fantastic service there.  It was convenient and the room was more than sufficient.  However, in comparison the service was lacking.  The concierge team was just OK and we waited for ages for requests like ice for the room and glasses for champagne.  Additionally, our wake up call never came on our departure morning and our car to the airport was not called.  It wasn't a bad stay, but I will stay somewhere else when I return to Barcelona.",3,2014,12,02
37,Great location,"Great location located in the heart of the city.  Small grocery store right around the corner and shopping up and down the street.  We used their car service $90 euros to the airport.  A bit disappointed with our room as we were given a very small room, in the corner on the third floor.  The brochures all state a nice deep tub which I was very much looking forward to (after being on a cruise for the past 12 days) no tub just a shower.  There was a loud humming kinda sound that we heard all night through the walls.  We were not close to the elevators so I'm not sure what it was.  Our window faced the other rooms so we had to keep our curtains closed all the time.  We were only here one night so none of this really bothered me except that I thought for a 5 star hotel I would have expected a bit more (and for the price)",3,2014,12,02
37,Bugs and not so good standard.,"Room in bad condition, with bugs.
We booked the room through a well-known hotel engine, and made a good deal. Due to experience we were prepared to be given a room on a low floor, but we were not prepared for the condition of the room in a hotel which is supposed to be a 5 star. 
We arrived on Friday afternoon and were met with smiles and very good service from the friendly staff.  We noticed that the wall next to the bed on the right had some water damage, and that the carpet were rather dirty, but we did get a bargain on the price and decided that since the room were large enough, the bathroom were big, and all the appliances seemed to work, that we could live with it. When the shower handle loosened, we were in doubt, but okay.
Next morning my wife discovered a bug on the wall next to her side of the bed (close to the water damaged area).  We were in a rush to get out in to town, and just killed the bug thinking that it was just a regular bug coming in from the outside through the window (witch we had closed 99% of our stay. 
When we returned later that day two more bugs (little silvery things) had arrived, but we were in a hurry (booking at Tickets – fantastic) and just killed the bastards, and went out again. We never alerted the reception, since we still thought the bugs were from outside.
Sleeping late next morning due to over eating & drinking at Tickets we went up to prepare for our departure, and noticed 4 more bugs crawling out of the wet spot on the wall. The entire luggage had to be examined, shaken vigorously and repacked. We cached one of the bugs to show the management, and left the room in a hurry. The management (head of reception) looked on the bug and offered us a new room. Well, we were departing, and did not need a new room, but I did expect the staff to treat this bug infection with a little more enthusiasm.  It is on its place to mention that we already had pre-paid for the room, and had paid for all our beverages from the mini bar, and we were not after compensation. (Nevertheless I would have expected to be offered dry cleaning or something similar).
To conclude, friendly staff, cannot beet the location, close to everything. Cheap booking equals cheap room, absolutely no 5 star reactions from reception to a bug infested room.",3,2014,12,01
37,Very good hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Very good hotel in the heart of Barcelona. bit expensive for all the things they offer: SPA is not included, free wifi is very smallband (high speed available at a cost). the breakfest area is a little bit cramped. for one night work it's ok.",4,2014,11,23
37,Fantastic Location,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights prior to taking a transatlantic cruise back to the United States. It is located on the famous Las Ramblas and is a short walk to the Placa de Catalunya (city center). The airport bus, metro, and hop on bus all have stops at Placa de Catalunya. The hotel is a short walk to many attractions including the Gothic Quarter, Marketplace, and Flamingo Theatre and Opera House.

Le Meridien is a 5 star hotel and the rooms and public places are modern and attractive. And you could not ask for a better location.",5,2014,11,19
37,Nice,"here with a tour group, staff is very friendly & helpful.
Rooms are big, bathtubs are very deep - hard to climb in & out, though they do have grab bars. 
Restaurant is good, prices seem fairly reasonable
Beds are comfortable",4,2014,11,19
37,Perfect Location. Good rooms. Five Star indeed.,"We were on a company convention in Barcelona and was booked to Le Meridien. Everything was great. Located in the heart of Las Ramblas. Breakfast was as good. It was nice to retire to a soft, comfy bed and nice cuddly pillows after long walks and travel around Barcelona. Rooms were spacious and very ideal for those who want comfort and luxury on their travel to Europe.",5,2014,11,19
37,Perfect Stay,"We arrived in Barcelona on an early flight from JFK.  I had called the Platinum Concierge desk informing them of this and that I'd like to request an early check-in. All was well till we arrived tired, dirty and told by the very rude girl at the desk that early check-in was only a request and not guaranteed. Yes, of course, I knew that, but that gave her NO permission to be rude and condescending to us.  I gave her my credit card and she flatly said, ""I don't need that now - we are full and I cannot give you a room.""  I knew they were not "" full"" as the Platinum desk said that property was around 80% occupancy that night, and I also checked upon landing, and there were plenty of rooms available for the previous night - empty rooms.  About the time I was ready to strangle a front desk worker, in walks Salvador Batlle, a manager of the hotel. He clearly overheard from the back what was transpiring at the front desk. He immediately stepped forward and took over what was turning into an ugly situation.  In less than three minutes, he took my credit card, checked us in and had given us the Platinum upgrade to a wonderful room.  So, I thank you, Mr. Batlle; you saved the day, and  please release the rude, rude girl on whom you intervened.
   Everything was perfect after that almost lost check-in  Room was great, service was perfect and location could not have been better.  I personally gave Mr. Batlle a thank you note upon leaving.  I look forward to staying here next January, and would not even consider another SPG property in Barcelona.",5,2014,11,18
37,"Great, central location","This hotel is ideal if you want to be located close to Las Ramblas - the entrance is just a few metres/yards from that busy thoroughfare. You have nearly all of Barcelona's amenities and tourist sites within walking distance of the hotel.
Breakfast is great here with a large choice of fresh dishes, and a cook who will make an omelette for you according to your precise tastes. I liked the fresh figs, something that's unusual to find in a breakfast dish. The bread was good too.
The surprising thing about this hotel was the speed of the lifts. Within seconds of pressing the button, they arrive promptly. I'm sure readers will recognise the many hotels they've been to where the lifts seem to take for ever - not this one.
The room was large and well equipped with a large shower room which itself had a choice of an overhead shower or a smaller showerhead fitted to the wall. Plenty of space to move around in. The bathroom had well stocked toiletries - soap, shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel, all good quality. The bed was comfortable too with a warm but lightweight quilt.
The only negative point were the large queues at reception. Staff seemed to be taking forever at check-in, so perhaps this hotel needs more people on the front desk. Also I don't expect to have to pay for Wifi- they were asking EUR 19 a day, reduced in a special deal to EUR 10 a day, but this should be free.",4,2014,11,17
37,Great Stay at Le Meridien!,"We had a great stay from start to finish at Le Meridien in Barcelona! The staff are OUTSTANDING across the board from the bellman that greeted us as he opened our taxi door and grabbed our luggage, to the Front Desk woman, Tomka, that checked us in and kindly upgraded us to a Junior Suite (I'm Lifetime Platinum), to the team at breakfast, to the Concierge, Gil, who lined us up with a fantastic tour guide (ask for Fabio Bugna), to housekeeping who we never saw, but kept our room clean as a button and well supplied with coffee, cream and waters that I had left a note requesting! This is a well managed Hotel! It's a tribute to Elisa Barral, the GM, who also was kind enough to send up some strawberries and a nice welcome note!

Well done all!",5,2014,11,13
37,Marvelous!,"This hotel was the first on a Week in Spain Tour with Tauck. I went in a day early, so had three nights in this wonderful place, a Starwood property. My room, comfortably large and nicely furnished, overlooked the small plaza at the end of the side street, centrally located just off Las Ramblas. I had requested a quiet room and it was perfect.

The bathroom was lovely, with tub/shower combo, tricky to get over that high ledge, but typical for the age of the hotel. However, the lighting could be improved, perhaps with a light up makeup mirror? Coffee/tea facilities in room very much appreciated.

Staff across the board in this hotel were very pleasant and service oriented at all times. Buffet breakfast food (freshly squeezed orange juice) was quite elaborate and there was something for everyone. I ordered room service after settling in and the Spanish omelet was delicious, perfect comfort food for a very tired traveler, promptly delivered. Our tour started off with a marvelous three course dinner with wine in the hotel dining room which was absolutely delicious. The chef here is outstanding. A creamy gazpacho, salad with tuna, roast lamb to rave about, flamed creme brûlée. Food served banquet style should always be this impressive! All in all, a wonderful hotel.",5,2014,11,11
37,Outstanding hotel in a great city,This was my first time staying at a Le Meridien hotel. It was a great experience all round. The staff are great and know the area extremely well. Liceu metro is right outside of the hotel and there are so many dining and shopping options opposite the hotel. Barcelona is one of my favorite cities now. They have a spa which is great as well.,5,2014,11,11
37,Great Service & Great Location,"Located in the middle of the ramblas, the hotel is pretty much in the heart of the tourist centre of Barcelona. This does mean that the hotel is pretty close to many restaurants and bars etc and there is always plenty of things going at a stone's throw. The location is pretty busy but the rooms are well built in that there is barely any noise that one notices. 

The rooms themselves are pretty big and have a very modern feel to them. A lot of times city centre hotels tend to be a bit dated- this is certainly not one of those places. 

The other thing that really makes the hotel stand out is the excellent service here. Arriving really late at night, check in was smooth and room service for food even at 2am was very quick (and reasonably priced). Each time we ventured out, the concierge was very helpful in promptly fetching us a taxi. And there was no issue in getting a late check out either. 

Overall a very good experience at a reasonable pice. If returning to the city, it would be hard to stay in a different hotel.",5,2014,11,10
37,Great location for Barcelona visit,"There are many things to like about the Le Meridien in Barcelona, especially the convenient location on Las Ramblas, close to many tourist attractions.  The staff of the hotel is top notch: polite, friendly and very eager to be of service.  The breakfast, which was included in our rate, was excellent for a buffet breakfast, with plenty of choices, especially the baked goods.  The room was kept very clean.  As we arrived at the hotel after an overnight flight with little sleep, we asked for a quiet room, away from the very noisy street scene.  Our room, on the first floor, was indeed quiet, facing a wall and apartment buildings. There was still sufficient natural light, and the lack of a view did not bother us at all, since we preferred quiet to catch up on sleep.  We did periodically hear the subway rumbling beneath us, but it wasn't that loud and last only a few seconds.  Didn't bother us at all.  The hotel didn't seem to be exceptionally crowded and, in any event, we didn't hear anyone in neighboring rooms or the hallways.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the bathroom is large and there was plenty of shelf space to put our toiletries.  We would have preferred a solid door rather than the glass door for privacy.  
The Ikea like decor of the room itself was a disappointment on many fronts and the reason for only 3 stars.  The platform bed was very low to the floor and not very comfortable.  The frame of the bed protruded at the end, causing painful bumped shins, until we placed a suitcase at the end of the bed to remind us to steer clear.  Lighting in the room was very dim.  There were two meager ""reading"" lights on each bedside shelf, but these could not be adjusted properly at all.  There were some motion sensor nightlights, but these didn't stay on long enough to get from the bathroom to the bed; fortunately we had some mini flashlights which we used.  The desk was too small to do anything useful, and lighting on the desk was also nonfunctional.  There was a single chair, which was extremely uncomfortable, and useless as a reading chair.  Truly it was one of the most nonfunctional hotel rooms I have ever spent a night in.  Coffee in the room was, surprisingly, instant, but drinkable.  Still, we had a wonderful time in Barcelona and enjoyed visiting this beautiful city.",3,2014,11,10
37,In the heart of La Rambla,"If you want to stay in La Rambla, this is a great hotel. In the heart of it all and right next to a Starbucks. Room was really small but nicely furnished and modern. They managed to utilize space in the room in a very impressive manner. Bathroom was big and spacious. Bruno the concierge was absolutely excellent.",4,2014,11,09
37,Very Good Choice,"Location is prime, right on Las Ramblas. Sometimes foot traffic can get hectic but it is expected.

Hotel is trendy (a W feeling), functional. Service is very attentive from the Bellmen and the receptionist to the people who took care of us during the stay. I was in need of a Doctor, the hotel handled the call extremely efficient so within half an hour the Doctor arrived.

Room and bathroom are comfortable with all the expected amenities.

For dinner, the restaurant is very good, quality dishes will be served, If you want a light fare there is a cafeteria on the other side of the lobby serving illy Cafe and very good pastries, affordable.

If in Barcelona again, most-likely I will make this a choice.",5,2014,11,09
37,Unbeatable location,"Stayed here in late October as part of a big group.  The hotel is superbly located in Las Ramblas with easy access to the both the metro and the Plaza de Catalunya stop of the hop-on-hop-off bus.  The rooms were nice and clean,  they could be bigger but they were not too tight.  The bathrooms would have been perfectly fine if not for the fact that the doors slid shut with no locks and did not quite fully close.  Thus you will hear everything the other person is doing in the bathroom.  

The front desk staff ranged from very helpful to curt.  I'm not sure if this is a language problem but I believe , ""I don't know"" should never be said under any circumstance.  I asked a lady at the front desk if she thought it was possible to get Renfe Spain Passes at the train station itself or if they can help me get it and she said, ""I don't know,  maybe the concierge would know.""  Thankfully the concierge was very gracious.

The breakfast staff, on the other hand,  were consistently attentive,  helpful,  and extremely gracious.  You must have the churros con chocolate they were one of the best we had in Spain.",4,2014,11,08
37,3 Years Later -- Just a SOLID CHOICE AGAIN!!,"Arrived in advance of a cruise departure for a couple of days at 0900, just as we did 3 years ago. Room 447 was ready before noon. There is a big push for guests to check out in the morning but the staff does an outstanding job in a fairly small space but they get the cabs and luggage arranged and out the door so incredibly well. The restaurant has changed hands and has a menu that leaves much to be desired; not a fan of this change. But the burgers are great on the bar menu in a pinch. Rooms were clean, modern, and quiet - Room 447. Location in Ramblas is just wonderful for access to historic quarter, catching HOHO buses, taxi to cruise terminal. No regrets here.",5,2014,11,07
37,Nice Hotel,"Obviously a group tour hotel (since we were on one) but, for a change, it didn't feel like one.  Obviously the La Rambla location is excellent and puts it close to almost everything you might want to see.  The rooms were large, clean and comfortable but, like some others, I'm not a big fan of the half glass doors in the shower.  The best part, however, was the friendliness and helpfulness of the entire staff, especially  the concierge.  Their assistance from restaurant recommendations to tickets for La Sacrada Familia was invaluable and always delivered with a smile.  A great place to stay.",5,2014,11,07
37,Great location and service,"Hotel is right in the middle of La Ramblas. you can literally walk around most touristic places in Barcelona. Very near to metro station to cover remaining area. I think concierge service in this hotel is one of the best I've seen. They put me on VIP list for great clubs on the beach, planned out my walking tour on map and gave very accurate direction to FC Barcelona game (based on my seating area). If in town and can afford, it is must stay",5,2014,11,06
37,"Location, Location, Location","The Barcelona Le Meridian is a good hotel in a perfect location for long walks in a wonderful ""walking city."" The staff is superior, very helpful and extremely competent. The concierge desk, in particular, made our visit much more wonderful because of their advice.",4,2014,11,05
37,1st time in Barcelona ,"

This hotel is conveniently located in the middle of the action, in Las Ramblas! The room is pretty quiet considering it is in the busy street.
We stayed from Oct20-23rd. 
Our package deal includes breakfast and it was worth it. They served hot and cold meals. Good selections! The servers are also very friendly. Good job!!
The room is spacious and the bathroom shower is big.
We did the hop and hop off bus and it was worth it.
The hotel is 15 mins walk to the Picasso museum and the Gothic quarter.
Pleasant stay for the short duration of our trip.

Tips : try to find restaurants in between alleys rather than eating at restaurants by Las Ramblas.  They serve better food.

Try the tapas inside the market, fresh food but it get busy so try to get early.

Buy your tickets in advance to go to the tower of Sagrada de familia.

*Do the hop on and hop off bus that is located in Placa de Catalunya.  There are 2 different bus company and both are good. * ",4,2014,11,05
37,Perfect location!,"Awesome location for walking the sites of this beautiful city. Hotel is lovely, impeccably clean with chic decor. The breakfast buffet has everything you could ask for and more. Omelette station, fresh fruit, delicious pastries. Would be my hotel of choice on a return trip. ",5,2014,11,05
37,Great Central Hotel,"Great Location midway down La Ramblas near all the shops  sights and restaurants. Lovely modern room and bathroom, nice sized desk for keeping up with business pressures and fabulous restaurant. Friendly efficient and helpful staff and very comfortable bed. Would definitely recommend this hotel and I will stay here again.",4,2014,11,03
37,"Nice hotel, excellent location","We stayed at LeMeridien on October 21, 2014 after a cruise and found the location to be excellent.  LaRambla is an exciting part of town.  The room was very modern and trendy. I didn't care for the glass bathroom doors, but the marble and appointments were beautiful.  The concierge was very helpful in reconfirming our flight and printing boarding passes.  Breakfast service on departure day was a little too slow and we had to keep asking for coffee, etc.  But I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona.",4,2014,11,01
37,"Sleep in luxury, walk to almost everything!","Le Meridien is a beautifully appointed modern hotel on Las Ramblas within walking distance of so many of the sights in Barcelona.  The staff is pleasant and helpful.  The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom large, with rainfall shower and good water pressure.  Breakfast was excellent with a large variety from which to choose.  Close walking distance to the market, the Gothic Quarter, Cathedral and Palau Guell, one of the Gaudi buildings.  On Sunday's, around noon, the locals gather at the Cathedral for dancing.  Only negative was almost constant wait to speak to the concierge, they could probably use another person at times.",5,2014,11,01
37,Good location,"The hotel is on the famous La Ramblas where many tourists shop, and eat at the many restaurants there. The staff was friendly and helpful. The salmon with asparagus was delicious at their restaurant.. My room was very quiet, and very clean. A French supermarket Carrefour, and a very nice public market are with in walking distances.",4,2014,10,29
37,One of our favorite hotels,"We loved staying at this hotel. The location right off La Rambla is excellent, and we had a quiet room. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. The person who greeted us at the registration desk made us feel very welcome. The concierges are knowledgeable and very helpful. The rooms are modern, well-equipped and comfortable. We loved the rain shower fixture in the stall shower. Le Meridien is one of our favorite hotels--and we have been at many hotels in many places.",5,2014,10,26
37,Must Stay in this Hotel on your next trip to Barcelona!,"Stayed here October 2014 and had a wonderful experience! This hotel is all about its location! Walking distance from El Born, La Boqueria market, and the waterfront area. The staff was very helpful and went out of their way to make sure as SPG platinum members we were accommodated nicely.  Coming from the US we always find European hotels sub-par compared to hotels in America, but the rooms were spacious, roomy bathroom with nice shower pressure and well flowing toilets. We had breakfast there daily which was convenient and very good. We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to Barcelona!",5,2014,10,25
37,Updated Hotel in Great People Gazing Location,"Pros: Great location for strolling, people gazing, window shopping.  Hotel and room are nicely updated with good amenities, linens, great blackout curtains, etc.  Room was not facing La Rambla, so noise was not an issue.  Bathroom and shower are nice.  Breakfast has a good selection with a custom egg chef.  All staff was friendly.  Neighborhood has lots of choices for dining or take-out.

Meh: hotel room is a bit small with limited storage space for stays more than a few days.

Cons: Painfully slow check-in.  For check out, price shown on hotel television (""View your bill"") doesn't say that it doesn't include VAT, so there's sticker shock at the desk.

Bottom line: Nice hotel in a great location to stroll and take in the city life.

Tip: instead of booking breakfast ahead of time at 25€ per person, you can book it for 18€ per person when you check in.",4,2014,10,23
37,Pleasant....,"Stayed last year at the Hotel 1898 which unfortunately was booked out this time around. Location was very good just off Las Ramblas. The amenities were ok, internet was slow, breakfast was good and rooms were a good size. Obviously with this hotel you're paying for the location than anything else.",3,2014,10,22
37,Great location for La Rambla,"This hotel was part of our tour and was surprisingly very good.
Located next to the La Rambla with plenty to see, and very convenient to tourist sites.
Breakfasts were a bit disappointing as the restaurant area was too small for the hotel numbers.",4,2014,10,21
37,An enjoyable stay,"Very nice hotel, a little further along La Rambla than I expected buta very well ran and central hotel. Lovely Reception areawith a coffee shop that also serves snacks.  Breakfast and Dinner both very nice and value for money",4,2014,10,21
37,"Amazing location, friendly staff.","Stayed here with a friend for 2 nights in early October. Le Meridien is perfectly located on La Rambla, a 10 minute walk to the harbour and beach and 5 minutes to the main market. 

Initially the room I was given was frustratingly not great. The subway passing underneath meant all the glass fixtures rattled very loudly and there was a strange smell. Taking in to account there was no hot water after taps ran for 10 minutes and there was no drinking water available I spoke to reception and asked to move rooms. 

The room I was upgraded to was amazing, absolutely fantastic! There was a beautiful walk in shower, a super comfy bed and the most fantastic private roof terrace ever. 

The team were very friendly, the breakfast choice was extensive and a great bonus. 

All in all a great stay, would recommend. ",5,2014,10,18
37,Home Away From Home,"We stayed at the Le Meridien for two days prior to our cruise and one day following the cruise.  We were thrilled with the quality, service and location of the hotel.  Traveling from the U.S., we arrived 9:00 am on Friday.  The staff greeted us warmly, checked for a room, communicated that it was not ready, took our phone number and called us an hour later to report the room was ready.  I was thrilled with the caring of the front desk.  Our room was upgraded and we had a lovely two days adjusting prior to the cruise.

The location was ideal, just steps away from La Rambla.  As first time visitors to Barcelona, we had access to great walking tours, resturants and the metro.  

The conciere was fantastic.  All of the recommendations were spot on and we braved the metro to see a FC Barcelona soccer match - easy!  Upon our return from the cruise, we were given the tip to visit the Picasso Museum (free on Sundays) and toured one of the Gaudi homes.  

Our last name was the same as the hotel resturant.  The staff all made a big deal about that and treated us to a lunch and drinks.  Totally unexpected and special.  

All in all a fantastic hotel experience.  I could have not asked for more.",5,2014,10,15
37,No ocean view  but grate staff and desired location for quick trip to Monserrat,"This hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona that means no ocean view unlike W Barcelona. 

We used free night award for one night as SPG  member and drop no dime to this hotel  but we  still got superb hotel service from front desk to concierge.

Can you believe our  room was upgraded and  we knew our room # ahead of  check in?

Concierge actually called our next SPG hotel to resolve our problem. No, not sending an e-mail !!

If you plan to go to Monserrat, I highly recommend to hire private guide and driver then leave hotel early in the morning. (takes about an hour)
By doing so you don't have to wait long line to touch  and pray Black Madoona.

Thank you Le Meridien Barcelona we will stay with you again and longer for  the next time.",5,2014,10,14
37,A wonderful hotel with a great location,"Le Meridian is a located right in the center of  Las Ramblas area.  While the hotel is rather spendy, it has excellent service, spacious rooms and is all of the amenities one would expect in a good hotel. It is located within walking distance to a great many excellent restaurants that afford you excellent dining experiences.",5,2014,10,13
37,Great location for exploring Barcelona,"Hotel is in a fantastic location as it's right where the La Rambla is and walking distance to the famous market 'La Boqueria', shops and restaurants. Very convenient. 

Standard rooms are quite small though but very clean and nicely decorated. 

Concierge services were brilliant and can help organize tickets to most attractions for you. 

Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Barcelona. ",4,2014,10,12
37,Fantastic,What a lively hotel. Superior suite amazing. Room was huge with floor to ceiling curtains that blocked out all lights so you can have a great sleep in their extremely comfortable bed. Bathroom huge and shower nice and hot. Very quiet location and the ambience of hotel great. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant is very nice food good.,5,2014,10,11
37,Great experience,"In an excellent location right off La Rambla in Barcelona.  The room was a good size and comfortable and quiet.
The staff was excellent and very helpful. I was using a walker and there was always someone available to help me exit and enter the hotel. 
The breakfast was excellent and the staff in the breakfast room were wonderful.  Special requests were filled with a smile.
The location is within walking distance of many attractions like the Boqueria Market and the Plaza Catalonia.",5,2014,10,10
37,Location in the Heart of the City,"As Starwood Gold we were comped up to a suite with a sitting/working area. The room was very nice. This was our first stop and it took Delta 36 hours to get our bags to us. The hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful with this situation. The location was within walking distance of the bay, the Picasso museum and most of the sights. It was on the Ramble which is the core tourist route from the cruise ships into the sights so we saw more travelers than Spaniards, but it was all interesting.",5,2014,10,10
37,Most central located and very friendly,"The hotel is very conviniently located on the main street La Rambla close to all shopping, restuarants and entertainment. Staff very friendly and reception always available .

The rooms are cozy and clean . The food are very attractive and it is a pleasure to stay here at the Le Meridien Barcelona. We will definatly visit again .

37,Central Location steps from the La Ramblas,"Our stay at Le Meridian 111 La Rambla was good, the location is what makes this hotel a good choice for visiting Barcelona. Main entrance: on a side street therefore away from main hustle & bustle of the La Rambla. A very busy hotel, foyer constantly filled with people/groups checking in...... our room on a low SPG floor was quiet despite 24/7 touristy La Rambla; view overlooked the side street & was nothing much, torn flag, trees, corner store. Air-conditioning: great. Decor: understated modern, my opinion, little dated; bed: reasonably comfortable ((not a pillow-top mattress) although a little too soft/lumpy for my liking). Amenities: good included 2 small complimentary bottles of mineral water daily, mini bar, tea/coffee making facilities & pull out ironing board and iron. Toiletries: good. House keeping: very good regarding bed making,cleaning bathroom etc but unfortunately tea/coffee/milk were never replenished our entire 3 night stay, second day, left empty dish for refill with coffee/tea/milk but no luck, 3rd day left everything out, kettle, dirty mugs...... unsuccessful...so washed mugs & luckily bought tea/coffee from previous hotel, plus there was a supermarket just up the street (yes, could have asked for some at the hotel just could not be fussed). Bathroom: renovated, modern with frosted glass walls and sliding door (for those with privacy concerns this may not suit everyone), included bath. Buffet breakfast (included in our room rate) was very good. Gym: small but well equipped. Does NOT have a pool. Spa services: available. Best features: location, 3-4 min walk to the wonderful Boqueria Market, approx 15-30 minute walk to water front,  Gothic area,Old Town, Cathedral, Placa de Catalunya & high end designer shopping, 3-5 min walk to Metro stop & the staff, all are very friendly and helpful.",4,2014,10,06
37,A fine central property close to all the action,"The Le Meridien Hotel is extremely well situated on Las Ramblas, the main pedestrian shopping street of Barcelona. It is within easy walking distance of the Old City, the Liceu opera house, the Boqueria market, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. The staff of the hotel is exceptionally helpful and courteous and the concierge is able to provide helpful advice on what to see and make bookings for tours and a wide range of restaurants. Of spec ial note is that the concierge desk has two original Gaudi chairs. The rooms are large, quiet, and well-appointed. The one area for improvement could be in the restaurant: the décor is unattractive and the food at dinner could be better. But there are many good restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, including a good tapas bar directly across the street and, our favorite, En Ville, only a short walk away on Calle Doctor Dou.",5,2014,10,04
37,Perfect location-Excellent breakfast!,"-The location is fantastic.  
-slow check in however they gave everyone excellent service which is very important
-lobby is small and not too inviting
-ample amount of umbrellas for a few raining days  :)
-breakfast buffet was the best we have ever had in a hotel.  
-Spouse had a birthday while here and he was treated well
-We had a first floor suite(Prestige suite), some say to stay above the 5th floor, with ear plugs we found this room top notch.  We could people watch on La Rambla perfectly from our living room  :) And you could pop up and down the stairs and not wait for the elevator.
-did not care for the bathroom door, large/glass/got in the way/was awkward.
-Would absolutely stay here again",5,2014,10,04
37,Nice Stop,"Located at 111 La Rambla , one block off from the walking, strolling street.
good shopping and sights.  Easy walk to waterfront.  It was the 400 year anniversary for Catalonia  Independence, so many people wee celebrating, but very orderly.
We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast and service was very fast and good.",5,2014,10,03
37,Nicely located,"The Meridian is close to the Rambles and restaurants. The Hotel is very clean and comfortable. 
The staff are friendly and speak very good English. The bar is very nice serving good food local and cosmopolitan. There is a City Tax and VAT tax which has to be paid before you leave the Hotel. Our room was facing a side street which was quiet allowing us a great nights sleep.",4,2014,10,02
37,"Locations, locations, locations....","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Barcelona's Le Meridien. First of all, the location's proximity to Las Ramblas is amazing. You can walk out and literally experience the local market. I feel safe and comfort throughout my stay. It's also close to the metro train nearby. I was choosing between W (which is a little bit further to the east near the beach) or this hotel. Thankfully, I felt that I made the right choice.

The room itself was great, it looks like the building and the unit itself are well-maintained. Service was also great, although nothing particularly memorable. In short, I found no problems at all during my stay, and would definitely stay here again in my next visit!",5,2014,09,30
37,Wonderful hotel,"Enjoyed a wonderful stay in Barcelona, Spain at la meridian hotel. Accommodations were wonderful, hotel location made traveling to points of interest very easy. The rooms were very comfortable and the staff extremely helpful. Lovely start to our Mediterranean silver sea cruise!",5,2014,09,30

We have not previuosly used this Hotel but were very pleased with the front desk staff, nice rooms and great location just off the main strret yet reasonably quiet.",4,2014,09,29
37,Excellent in Everything,"It was a 4 nights visit to attend a conference. The location is excellent in the center of the busiest street in barcelona and near the shopping stores and malls, the metro stations nearby,  alot of attraction areas and resturants are just a walking distance from the hotel.  The staff in the concierge and reception were so kind and attentive. The room was big and comfortable with big modern bathroom. Breakfast was good but it doesn't includes alot of varieties and costs 23€ ( you can get cheaper breakfast beside the hotels).
Overall my experience in this hotel was excellent and definitely will stay there again. 
 ",5,2014,09,29
37,Honeymoon ,Wonderful place. The staff are impeccable. Very helpful. The room are fun and the views fabulous. Great location next to the market. If you need anything the concierge will help you. It's pricey but the location and quality make it worth it. We got a nice honeymoon upgrade. ,5,2014,09,28
37,Wonderful Hotel on La Rambla - In the Center of It All,"I stayed two nights at the Le Meridien and this was my first visit to the hotel. When you walk in it does have a long and narrow lobby which isn't necessarily inviting. However, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel couldn't be more perfect on La Rambla. You are surrounded by restaurants and places to walk and the metro is only steps away if you want to explore the rest of the city. 

As a Starwood memeber I used some upgrades for my nights at this hotel. I was upgraded to a suite that in one word was AMAZING! There was one small bathroom located in the entry hallway of my room as you enter the living area. The views and windows all around were fantastic.

There was a huge master bathroom separate tub and shower and a mirrored wall with a TV system installed in it. Very nice! The bed was beyond comfortable! It was difficult to wake up and get going in the morning. 

The hotel buffet breakfast is served in their restaurant on street level with a view of La Rambla that made for enjoyable people watching as I ate breakfast. 

They do have a small business center in the hotel which I used to print some tickets for tours. There was no charge. I did like that there was an iron and ironing board in the room. The air conditioning system was efficient and the pressure of the water in the shower was perfect. 

If I were to return to Barcelona I would stay here for the comfort, air conditioning, friendly staff, comfortable surroundings and perfect location.",4,2014,09,27
37,Great location  nice hotel,"This is a very nice hotel right off the main drag, modern and not noisy.  One small gaff on arrival.  They put me in a non made up room.  They immediately gave me a free breakfast and tonight the added another one and the breakfast buffet that is over 20 euros but very good.   Staff friendly and helpful.  Tonight came back to room to find a delicious desert and fruit.   Would stay here again for sure.",4,2014,09,27
37,Great location,"This hotel is very well located just off the Ramblis.  Easy access to cabs, metro etc.  Rooms are comfortable and the staff is very helpful.  Breakfast was included in our package and was excellent. I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,09,26
37,Great location and love the hotel & staff,"My son & I spent a couple of days in Barcelona and wanted a central location we could see the old neighborhoods of the old town and Gothic quarter as well as see some of the Gaudi sights. Le Meridian is well situated part way down La Rambla. The street itself is interesting but too commercial. It is however close to the food market which is a fun experience as well as close to the many small winding streets in the old area with cafes and restaurants. 

Le Meridian itself is modern, typical of the brand. Our room faced La Rambla on the 5th floor and had a great view. With the windows closed it was surprisingly quiet. Beds were very comfortable. Good amenities. Breakfast was plenty with a variety of buffet items. Omelet was only just ok (all filling in center) but that that was the only negative. 

Hotel staff were very helpful. We arrived early and they did their best to get the room ready for us and they called me when it was ready prior to normal check in . There is one concierge fellow who helped us with recommended sights and reservations. His upside down writing on maps while talking to us was amazing. 

This hotel will not disappoint.",5,2014,09,24
37,Great location and service,"I recently stayed two nights in Barcelona towards the end of a two week vacation through other parts of Europe.  I stayed at another Le Meridien property in Nice and was a little skeptical of the brand after that stay, but was so pleasantly surprised when I arrived in Barcelona.  I got to the hotel pretty early in the day - 10 AM - so a room wasn't ready yet, but the hotel took my luggage and the concierge helped me book tickets to Segrada Familia while I waited for a room to be ready.  I went on my way to eat breakfast and shortly after that I got a call from the hotel that a room was available.  

My favorite part of the hotel was the location.  Couldn't ask for a better area to be in and despite being on a busy street like Las Ramblas, I could never hear any noise from the street.  

If I ever come back to Barcelona this will definitely be where I'll be staying.  Thanks for making it such a pleasant stay!",4,2014,09,24
37,"Excellent - Hotel, Staff, and Location","This was a perfect work/vacation trip at the Le Meridien.  The location cannot be beat on La Rambla.  It is close to the main square for shopping, close to the water for attractions, and full of energy.

Probably one of the best breakfasts that I had in Europe for a long time.  Very well done.

Only issue, if you want to call it that, was the bed.  Two full beds (plenty of room), but with a very large cavern between and separate sheets.  Just a bit weird.

The front desk, bellman and wait staff were all exceptional.

I had a Prestige suite which overlooked La Rambla.  Would book the same again in a heartbeat.

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,22
37,In the Heart of it All.,"Perfect hotel for your first trip to Barcelona.  It's as central as you can get to all of the sites and the Ramblas (main city walking path to the beach) is just right out side your door.  The hotel itself is what you expect from a Starwood in Europe, big, lots of tourists, Ok sized rooms.  You stay here for the location.

Design: Modern Funky (Le Meridien Standard)
Room Size: Standard, on the largish side for European Hotels
Beds: Comfy, not plush
Price: $$$
Value for the Area: Great value for Tourists looking for a large American Brand Hotel
Who's it good for: Couples or families looking to explore the city
What Makes it Stand Out: Location and a Starbucks around the corner.",4,2014,09,22
37,Very Nice and Location Location! Location!,"Great place to stay in  Barcelona if you you like modern and chic. I  love charming and old style with lots of amenities. Our room was very small a nd very short on style and charm. That being said, the location is perfect for walking to everywhere.",3,2014,09,22
37,Great hotel! 4th stay here!,"I love this hotel. I always stay here when in Barcelona. I am a vacation, not a business, traveler so do not have to stick to a particular hotel or hotel class. But I am an SPG Gold member. I think this hotel has the best location in the city! Vivian checked us in and was very pleasant and friendly. I was really hoping to get a room upgrade, but that didn't happen as the hotel was sold out. Leaving our husbands at home, I requested 2 beds for my girlfriend and myself. The room we were given was on the SPG floor overlooking the side (quiet) street. The room was quite large (442) so I was pleasantly surprised. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large but only had 1 sink. I personally do not care for the new trend of glass walls in the bathrooms, but the glass was frosted and only on 2 sides. The doormen, especially Alex, were very friendly and helpful. As I said... I love this hotel and I will surely return!",5,2014,09,17
37,Excellent everything,"We stayed for 3 nights using SPG points. It was excellent overall, very clean, nice bathrooms, awesome shower, phenomenal location, very attentive staff with excellent customer service. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Illy coffee next to lobby! Would come back for sure.",5,2014,09,16
37,Great Location,This property is located on Las Ramblas and convenient to La Boqeria.  The hotel has a nice lobby and restaurant.  We were offered a welcome drink in the lounge which was very nice.  The interior of the room was very nice with full length mirrors and a separate closet space in the entry.  The bed was very comfortable.  The view from our room was not good.  One of the rooms facing the street would be better in terms of view.,4,2014,09,15
37,Encore! Bravo!,"I stayed at this Hotel just this past April... Very impressed with the overall experience!
Unexpectedly, I had the opportunity of re- visiting Barcelona once again last week and stayed at the Le Meridien once again for 2 nights...I am so impressed with the consistency of their overall service... I just feel the need to give them a pad on their back and a High Five and 2 thumbs up!
We all know the hospitality industry is a people's industry and the personal interaction with the Hotel's staff is so very important..I am particularly impressed with the smiles on the Hotel's staff's faces and it just make for a great stay!
Merci !",5,2014,09,15
37,Perfect,"We stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago for 4 nights celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was our first trip to Barcelona. The location was excellent, situated right on La Rambla within easy walking distance of most of the places you visit whilst in Barcelona along with shops and restaurants. The hotel was lovely, no noise from the street below. Breakfast was continental and was very satisfying, and from memory the bed was the most comfortable bed we had slept in whilst on holiday. We did eat in the restaurant and the meal was delicious.
All staff were courteous and professional and we were well looked after throughout our stay. 
Looking to return for another long weekend before the year ends.",5,2014,09,13
37,"Great location, excellent rooms","The location of the hotel is great to go shopping and to go for restaurants. We got some upgrade to a suite and had a very nice view over the city. The room was very new renovated and excellent. The staff was very nice and helpful,very good service.",5,2014,09,12
37,"Excellent location, wonderful rooms","This hotel is located just off Les Rambles (perhaps all of 50 yards), so you can get all of the silly fun tourist stuff there, or turn in the other directions, and find tons of shops and restaurants. The rooms were great, and the staff were very, very helpful.

We were on a trip with our son & his fiancee, and her parents. Our son's room was a little noisy the first night, and when he asked if anything could be done, they moved him to a beautiful suite.

Like most hotels, I am going to ding them a bit for not having sufficient open electrical outlets. I want to be able to plug in a phone next to each side of the bed, and a tablet at the desk without having to unplug something else.

The stairwell has to be seen to be believed. It's a work of art.",5,2014,09,10
37,Perfect location,"This modern full-serviice hotel is very well located right on La Rambla within easy walking distance of the cathedral, shopping, and the places you want to see in the Gothic and Born quarters.  The concierge was very helpful in arranging the obligatory Gaudi visits.  We did not get a chance to try the restaurant or bar because we were too busy going from one tapas cafe to the next!  My only small complaint is that the hotel is obviously a favorite for cruises that begin or end in Barcelona, so the front desk can at times get overwhelmed by the influx of check-in or check-out all at once.  But they had a well-trained staff who seemed to handle this challenge well, and all-in-all we were quite pleased with our Barcelona base of operations!",5,2014,09,06

Breakfast buffet was good with lots of choices.  ",5,2014,09,06
37,Amazing Location,"The accommodations and service were splendid, particularly the hotel restaurant was pleasant, well-appointed, and food was perfect.  The concierge handled restaurant reservation changes for us expertly, enabling us to have the best restaurant experience I have ever had.  The hotel location on the Ramblas was phenomenal in terms of enabling easy access to many activities and tours of the city in general, and specifically the Gothic quarter.",5,2014,09,05
37,BEST LOCATION with QUALITY service,"We stayed here in July 2014. We had already visited Madrid, Segovia, and San Sebastian. We took a midnight bus from Segovia to Barcelona, word of advice: NOt worth it!!! take a train if you can. We were trying to kill two birds with one stone, and in the end we ended up paying for it. By paying for it, i mean NO SLEEP. it was a long ride, but once we got off, we were in BARCELONA!!! Beautiful city. Absolutely loved it. We took a bus for 4 euros to the subway station, which was another 2.50 euros and then walked about 5-8 mins to our hotel. Its dead center of La Rambla. It's centrally located to all the tourist shopping & Dinning. we didn't do much of the tourist dining or shopping. But the street is very busy. Once we got to the hotel, we were there of course too early for check in. Like most hotels in europe, they let us keep our bags there while we explored. The staff members were very kind, the vicinity in the lobby were clean and kept up well, and the rooms were gorgeous & very spacious for it being in europe. We had a foyer, a closet, cal king bed, a chase, desk, and a spacious restroom. The showers were unbelievable. 
Another good tip: free wifi & free business center usage.  you can print your boarding pass and use their computer for FREE!!! If I could, I would definitely stay here again! loved it. I could see this being potential loud at night, but we were out so late, we didn't even notice.",5,2014,09,04
37,"Great location, Meridien standard","Hotel is just in Ramblas and very near a lot of interesting places. Only problem is the parking and access by car (not that easy). Service is as expected and breakfast was just perfect. Many fresh products and healthy choices (not common,,,). Good place to be when visiting Barcelona",5,2014,09,03
37,"Le Meridien quality, unbeatable location","I booked this hotel because of the perks associated with SPG (free room upgrade).  For a European hotel, the rooms were large, with a spacious bathroom. There was plenty of closet space, a room safe, and minibar.  My room had a balcony with a view of Hotel 1898 across the street.  If you want to fully open the balcony doors, you have to go down to the front desk and sign a waiver, then maintenance will come and release the catch that prevents them from opening.

Unfortunately, in the morning there is quite a bit of street noise. (restaurant deliveries, garbage pickup, motorcycles).  There are also a couple of blue ""nightlights"" that never go off and the curtains allow a bit of light at the bottom. One of the things I enjoy about a hotel room is being able to create a quiet and dark cocoon and catch up on some sleep.

Like other reviewers have said, the location is sublime. I'd guess there are about 20+ restaurants within a block.  There are two nearby metro stations as well.

We worked with 3 different concierge and each one was immensely helpful. They can make reservations at restaurants for you (helpful if you don't speak Spanish), and pre-book tickets for the major attractions allowing you to skip the long, long lines.

The front desk staff were lovely and fast. 

There is something to be said for paying a bit more for a luxury hotel.  The perks are well worth it.",5,2014,09,02
37,Perfect Location - Excellent Service - Wouldn't stay anywhere else!,"I stayed here with my wife for our 10 year anniversary in the July of 2014 for 3 nights (2 at the beginning of our trip and 1 night towards the end of our trip).  Here is my breakdown.

Location:  Excellent location in the heart of the La Rambla shopping area.
  
Rooms:  The rooms are extremely nice and clean.  We did not hear any noise from the streets and our room was on the street side.  I think if you get a high level floor, you are ok.  We were upgraded to a suite on the last day and it was on the 8th floor with a balcony.  It was VERY nice sitting on the balcony in complete privacy.  Beds were very comfortable.  Loved the Robes and slippers they had in the bathrooms.  The showers were equipped with a nice rainfall shower which was nice.

Service:  Excellent service, everyone was ready to help.  They have a dedicated person standing in the lobby to help with any questions.  They have security at the front door all the time as well.

Restaurants:  We never ate in the hotel.  For breakfast we walked directly across the street and they have a nice breakfast place there (can't remember the name).  For lunch we were usually out and about in La Ramba area.  For dinner you can try the place across the street as well.  They call it a bar but it's not a bar as in the american style pub.  Very nice food there with an outdoor patio. 

SPG cardholders:  Since this is an SPG hotel I used my SPG card.  One thing I don't like that they do is that they count 2 days as a single stay.  They should have counted each night as a single stay.  Don't think I'll ever reach gold level. Next time I'll book it as 2 separate nights. lol

Tip: If arriving from the airport, don't bother with a taxi to get to the hotel.  As soon as you exit the airport there is a bus that will take you directly to the area.  The bus costs $5.90 euro per person and you stay on it until the last stop:  plaça catalunya.  Once you get off the bus, you will have about a 5-10min walk and you are there at the hotel!  Just ask where La Rambla is and walk in that direction.  You will see the hotel on the right hand side.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  We took a taxi once on the way there and it costs $30.  

Taxi's:  Make sure that they start the meter correctly on the car.  They sometimes start it at $2 euro and change and others it is $5 and change for the same time of the day.  Keep an eye on it.",5,2014,09,02
37,Stop over in Barcelona,"Once off the ship we whizzed into central Barcelona to Le Meridian just off las ramblas. Perfect position! 
Modern rooms,excellent shower! Room a bit dark but otherwise very well appointed. Hotel staff from Marius at the front desk to Jordi and co at the concierge could not have been more helpful! Breakfast was excellent particularly the lady making the most perfect omlettes i've ever seen or tasted!  Just a great base to tour an amazing city and then relax on your return!",5,2014,09,02
37,Beautiful Hotel in Superb Location,"Stayed here for 3 nights and couldn't fault the place. Right slap bang in the middle of La Ramblas. The rooms are very high standard, as are the staff. Upon checking in the lady on the Front Desk couldn't have been more helpful, spending a good 20 mins giving us tips on where to go and what to see. Wonderful customer service. The hotel bar was immaculate and very reasonably priced for a hotel of this standard.
Highly recommended",5,2014,09,02
37,Brilliant Location,There cant be a better location- step out of the hotel door and you are right in the middle of the happening Ramblas area. Very helpful concierge people and nice quiet rooms. Would definitely come back here during my next visit.,4,2014,09,02
37,"Excellent location, staff was very helpful.",The location is perfect it is within walking distance to everything we only took cabs to and from the airport. You are situated right off the La Rambla but yet it is on a quaint side street. Also there is a grocery store right next door which was perfect for buying snacks and water.,5,2014,08,31
37,Good stay,The Meridian in Barcelona Spain is a classy hotel smack in the center of Barcelona. The rooms are well kept with a nice shower and a mini fridge always fully stocked up and loaded. The rooms are also equipped with a great safe key pad locked too. Get down to Barcelona and have a great stay at the Le Meridian just like me!,4,2014,08,26
37,Brilliant,"Perfect location, next to the famous Ramblas. Gorgious suite with terrace, giving our stay in the middle of the city that little extra allowing slow afternoon's outside with the privacy of a personal terrace while only a couple of steps away from the vibrant terraces and city vibe! A good spa area with roof-terrace and helpful staff. Highly recommended.",5,2014,08,26
37,"Very good Hotel, Good Location, Good price","We stayed here as part of an APT tour 4 Nights July August 2014. The hotel is in a very good location just on La Rambla. Our room not on the side facing La Rambla, jus as well as other guests on the La Rambla side said it was noisy in the early hours of the morning from the crowd in the street, avoid the La Rambla side if possible.  Breakfasts very good plentiful and good selection. Service excellent.  Check in efficient and timely. I would recommend this hotel. Clean and reasonably spacious rooms. Helpful staff.",5,2014,08,25
37,Location that matters,"Highly sattisfied with hotel. In first place by its location at la Rambla - at the heart of all the bars, restaurants, sightseeing places. The noise level is low - don't worry about that. Concierge service is great - will book you any restaurant and prebook you tickets for Sagrada Famiglia Cathedral - don't queue there for hours, just ask at the hotel for tickets. Big modern rooms, even tv in the bathroom. And breakfast buffet is amazing, with huge windows overlooking the street and amazing food! Enjoyed, thank you.",5,2014,08,25
37,Location only good thing about this hotel,"Our whole experience we were looked down upon much like homeless people. Started in the parking garage where after we passed the 10 minute inspection, we were literally escorted to a designated parking space. At checkin, we ended up needing a rollaway bed which cost almost as much as an additional room!  Room wasn't ready at 4pm, gave us a ""cocktail"" while we waited which took 5 minutes to get service then asked for our free cocktail card which had been given to them by our desk clerk. In a huff the server went to find our card, came back 6 minutes later and informed us no cocktail, just beer (4oz) or cava.  Wanting to get on with our first day in Barcelona, we really didn't want to be sitting for 15 minutes for a 4 oz free beer, had we known. 
Off to get something to eat (off-property, thank you), we returned to find our room ready but was asked if we wanted the rollaway bed made up, really?  Got to our room where we had to wait almost 10 minutes for somebody to bring our luggage.  Again, wanted to just get on with exploring the city, not sit in a hotel room.  Room was clean enough, view was horrible - a 2nd floor rooftop.  Bathroom was updated but the door was etched glass, kind of like a shower door.  Not very private and didn't close all the way.  Overall, not very inviting atmosphere, staff was adequate but not very engaging or helpful.  Having traveled to Starwood properties very often, I was discouraged this one did not make the guest a priority.  At $300 for the night, this was the biggest disappointment of our 8 day trip to Spain.",1,2014,08,24
37,"Clean comfortable romantic, in the heart of the city","This was an overnight trip the first time from Ibiza to Barcelona to ibiza. It was such a great hotel in this great city that we went back a week later for a few nights more.

This is probably one of the best run Meridian hotels I have stayed at. It was a flawless stay, the hotel staff was amazing, the accommodations were fantastic, and the location is ""right there""  they have their own restaurant 111 directly in the hotel on the corner of La Rambla, and the food was exceptional easy 4 stars.

The famed market is two blocks down and we ate there as well.

Thanks for beating and exceeding my usual expectations for Le Meridian. You really killed it.",5,2014,08,24
37,Perfect for our needs,"We had only two days for a return visit to Barcelona before a boarding our ship for a  cruise from that city.  Le Meridean was a perfect choice.  Well located, with beautiful, comfortable rooms and courteous staff",4,2014,08,23
37,Super-accommodating hotel,"Our flight landed in Barcelona early. My husband and I were both jet-lagged, and with me being in the first trimester of my pregnancy, I was exhausted and slightly sick. The staff did everything they could to get us into a room early, and when our suite wasn't ready; they let us crash in a hospitality room for a few hours to get in a nap. 

The room itself was spacious, the location was fantastic, and the breakfast was delicious.

My only complaint is that this is a common before/after cruise hotel, and they seemed completely overwhelmed with the influx of guests on Saturday mornings/afternoons (pre-cruise guests) and Sunday afternoons (post-cruise guests). You'd think they'd expect this and be able to better handle the large groups. My suggestion would be that if you're getting on/off a cruise, grab some lunch first and stop by the front desk an hour after the mad rush.",4,2014,08,20
37,Not bad,"Business hotel trying to be ""hip"" in a great location.  Room clean, small, with poor view. Roof terrace tiny with no service. Reception always very busy with people checking in and out. Felt very impersonal. Better options in Barcelona in the same area are definitely available.",3,2014,08,16
37,Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hide,"It was an interesting experience because they were very reluctant to provide the service they should until you get upset, then they go overboard to provide what you requested. I guess they did not want to take responsibility until you called them on it and then they were happy to oblige. It started right from the beginning when i arrived at 11am and they told me check in was not until 3pm. We stowed our bags and left to explore the city. We came back at 3:30pm and they told me check in was not until 4:00pm. I checked there website and it was 3:00pm! i had to call out the person who initially told me 3pm then we all agreed it was 3pm and they apologized?? They continually screwed up from that point on from check in time, to cleanliness of the room, to honoring SPG membership, to not doing what they said they would on room charges. They fixed everything but their first reaction was denial or act like there is no problem. I would have to call them on it and get the person responsible in front of me and then they would fix it. I tip well so the staff was taking care of me, but who wants to continually have to ask them to provide normal service. I travel a lot and have never experienced anything like this before. I was on vacation trying to enjoy time with my family and shied away from the hotel as much as possible. Barcelona is a beautiful city! You will spend 1/2 day in this area. Eat lunch at the market!! Amazing! There are no good dinner options in the area.",2,2014,08,13
37,"Great hotel with best location, amazing service","First of all the location - at the middle of the Ramblas but on the side - so you do not hear the noise at night.
The hotel is modern , very clean, big rooms and big bathroom ( good surprise for European hotels )
Amazing sleeping quality - the bed was too comfortable !!!
The service was more than good - they just make you feel at home.
the next time i come to Barcelona is only for this hotel.",5,2014,08,12
37,Nice Hotel but Poor Location,"This Meridian  is a nice hotel on the inside but would be so much a better hotel if it was somewhere other than the Ramblas. The location is noisy down on the street, touristy and maybe not the safest, with all the back and forth endless crowds descending on the Ramblas nearly 24/7. People constantly warn about pickpockets in the area surrounding the hotel, and a couple with us had a nearly bad experience nearby. The rooms are nice but not over generous in size. With so many great hotels in Barcelona to chose from, located north of this area in different districts, I do not want to return here again.",4,2014,08,12
37,Good Location,"This hotel is at a perfect location if you want to walk to many of the wonderful sights, shops and restaurants of the city center. Overall, a very nice ambience but overpriced due to the location. View from the room was not the greatest but the view from the spa made up for it. Gym was small but clean, with a variety of modern equipment. My one complaint would be the attention to detail of the cleaning staff. The closet was microscopic (not enough room for more than a couple days of clothing), and yet the hangers and clothing rod were covered in dust. You could still see the glass marks on the side tables by the bed and the decorative cover on the bed was dirty. Besides that, cleanliness was ok overall in the hotel. Nice modern bathroom but not good for privacy due to the sliding, frosted glass door. 
If you are staying here, you are staying for the location. I would stay here again but I wish the SPG program made it worth the price.",4,2014,08,10
37,Very average service,"The hotel is well located , next to the wonderful Boqueria Market ..but was extremely extremely crowded , and the front office staff was lacking attention. Huge line to get attention either from the concierge or front desk. Overall a very poor level of service.",3,2014,08,10
37,Great home base for exploring Barcelona,"We stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona as a home base for family touring of Barcelona urban attractions in June 2014. We stayed in a Prestige Suite on the 5th floor. We had our 5-month old daughter with us, and we were somewhat concerned that street noise from the Ramblas would be a problem that might interrupt her sleep. As it turned out, while the sitting room was overlooking the Ramblas and slightly noisy despite closing the windows, the bedroom faced over a quiet side-street and was perfect for sleeping. We all slept very well!

Overall, we really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Plusses, in our view, included:
1. Great location for touring the city (right on the ramblas, very close to a metro stop and a big grocery store)
2. Comfortable rooms, recent renovation of rooms and common areas. Chic hotel design.
3. Great buffet breakfast and dinner fare at Cent Onze restaurant, overlooking the Ramblas
4. Excellent service from staff, including Gold Key concierge. The concierge expertly helped us make all our bookings for tours, saving us a lot of time and effort.

The only minus, we would say, was that the concierge desk was often very busy with tourists trying to make bookings for attractions. Heavier staffing during peak periods would have been helpful.

Overall, we wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting central Barcelona who wants a comfortable, convenient home base for touring the city.",5,2014,08,10
37,Very good location,I like the location. It is located in the Ramblas  street. Just get out of this hotel and walk into action .The lobby is small. the rooms are OK. The service is good.We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and we were happy with it.,4,2014,08,07
37,What a way to treat SPGmembers,"Just checked in for family vacation booked on points with 3 people in one room - booked through Starwood Platinum Desk and confirmed via email.  On check in find that the room has only one bed and is not capable of actually sleeping three (oh and it is our 20th wedding anniversary!). 

Check-in staff kept changing story of room, where we could sleep and how they only have small number of triples - can't see why a confirmed room would not be honoured - it is not as if I haven't stayed Starwood before having been Platinum for past 3 years!

Frankly the whole process so far seemed to be to let me know what extras I would have to pay for rather than to try to accommodate our actual booking.

Really very unimpressed with the complete lack of customer service - I appreciate that a point booking is not a revenue booking but would expect some appreciation of customer loyalty and honouring bookings",1,2014,08,06
37,Good modern hotel,"Stayed here 1 night pre cruise and 3 nights post cruise. Hotel is in a great location right on the Ramblas. Reception staff very efficient and friendly as were the  porters and breakfast staff. Stayed in two different rooms both with Ramblas views. One was a better shape than the other but both equally comfortable. The beds are amazing , so comfortable. Large bathroom with great rain shower and very large bath.  The bath is very deep to climb in and out of but there are grab rails to help. Its a short walk to Plaza Catalunya, the hop on hop off buses and El Corte Ingles. Nice, modern, city centre hotel.",4,2014,08,04
37,"Nice hotel, great location","The perfect location for a stay in Barcelona.  We were warmly greeted by front desk staff and given a quick instructional, with map, of our location and places we wanted to see.   Our room was nice, with a great bath, the shower was huge, with 2 shower heads.  Our room, located off the street, was quiet except for kids ringing the door buzzers which, after a call to the front desk, the staff put a stop to. While the entire staff was great, Lorena, at the concierge desk, was invaluable.  She made great restaurant suggestions and booked us a table at her favorite jazz bar one night.  Victor, at the front desk, answered almost all my calls and was quick to fulfill my requests.  The location of the hotel makes exploring the Gothic Quarter very easy.  There are metro stops nearby on La Rambla and cabs pass by the hotel entrance often.  One note on cabs, if the hotel calls a cab for you, the cab charges an extra 5 euros, so, once we realized this, we would just go out front and have the doorman hail a cab or hail one ourselves.  Also, there is a large, 2 story grocery store 1 minute from the hotel that, in addition at any kind of food, sells liquor, wine and beer.  Here we bought everything we needed for a picnic at Montserrat.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,31
37,Le Meridien ,"This is the second time here, I was a little disappointed this time. I would have given it five star last time , that's why we returned, but it unfortunately only gets a three and a half stars this time. The breakfast was sub standard with cold water in the tea pot , the eggs took forever and were not cooked like one expects from a five star hotel. The fridge had rubbish in it from the previous guests. The position is really good in the middle of the best st. We did not eat there other than breakfast so I cannot comment on the lunch or dinner. The staff were lovely. ",3,2014,07,30
37,"great location, great staff","Others have said it, but the location is phenomenal.  We were able to walk everywhere.  In addition, two staff members were fabulous.  Bruno, one of the concierges, was an absolute standout.  He made marvelous suggestions and offered some extremely helpful advice.  Best of all, he really listened to what we wanted.  Paula, the front desk manager was also great.  We had a series of issues and she really helped at making things right",4,2014,07,30
37,Fantastic Property,"Loved loved loved the Le Meridien.  Location was the best.  The hotel offered us a half price connecting room for our kids while still paying a good rate for the first room. The staff was outstanding - from the front desk to the concierge to the luggage assistance.  With tons of luggage and four of us due to a month long European vacation, hotel recommended a luxury van service at a great price - and booked it for us. Just a great property. A full rooftop pool would make it perfect.",5,2014,07,30
37,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite and had buffet breakfast included every day.
The location was wonderful for sightseeing. The service was also great.",5,2014,07,29
37,"Location,Location,Location !","We have just returned from Barcelona having stayed at this hotel  in july ! The location is perfect for visiting Barcelona with good transport links very nearby at placa catalunya. The hotel is right on La Rambla with many good restaurants nearby. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast very good with a large selection of sweet and savoury and freshly cooked omelettes and fried eggs on request. The staff were very friendly and accomodating. Within walking distance is Passage Gracia
which is great for shopping and visiting Casa Batllo and La Pedrera  two   Gaudi masterpieces.
Casa Batllo is very worth visiting as is la sagrada familia. We would definitely recommend this hotel .",4,2014,07,28
37,Great location,"Location is ideal; right on La Rambla so quite central for tourists (however, it also means you have to deal with aggressive Nigerian hookers and scam artists on your way back late at night...oh well, that's Barcelona for you).

Didn't spend much time in the hotel but we stayed in a junior suite on the top floor. Had one minor issue at check-in (AC not working) but it was fixed by the time we got back that evening. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were nicely furnished in a minimalist/midcentury style. Rate was very fair at around 400 USD/night. I'd definitely consider returning.",4,2014,07,26
37,Few days in Barcelona!,"This hotel is in the most ideal location for tourists. It has many restaurants and shops nearby, shops ranging from the low end goods to the high end goods. The suites we stayed in had some extraordinary views, and was a great place to stay as a family on our first and most definitely not our last trip to Barcelona. Only 10-15 minutes away from Camp Nou, and thats an experience everyone should enjoy. A very modern and upmarket hotel, which fits right in with the Le Meridien image. I can't wait to visit Barcelona once again in the near future!",5,2014,07,24
37,The worst hotel?,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel and I must say that it was the worst experience we have ever had at a four star plus hotel.
There was no valet to greet us when we arrived so we had to carry all of our luggage to the front desk where a long line awaited us in a hot, crowded lobby. After waiting for quite a while, we were given a room in which someone had been smoking. In addition, the air conditioner didn't work. 
I called the front desk and was told that there were no rooms available to move to until the next day. After a horrible night, we were told to leave our luggage in our room while we toured Barcelona and the valet would move it to our new room. When we returned to the hotel that afternoon, our thing had been moved to the new room but one of our bags was missing. Missing!
We informed the front desk manager and after they did a ""thorough"" search, they assured us that all the bags had been moved. The manager even insinuated that perhaps we took it with us and had left it somewhere! The bag contained all of my wife's shoes- the only shoes she had now were the ones on her feet. 
The hotel manager said that they would not accept responsibility for the loss. After some serious words from me they offered 100 euros to compensate. Really? Ridiculous.
We were so disgusted with the hotel and staff,we transferred to the Ritz. A far better property.

I have contacted American Express Platinum to convey our displeasure. They are looking into the matter.

Our advice is to stay away from this property. It is not up to the typical LM standards.",1,2014,07,24
37,good location in Barcelona,"Right on La Rambla, this Meridien boasts of great influence of art in its decor and furnishings.
Almost everything is walking distance, some walks maybe long but always interesting in a city like Barcelona. The port is 15 minutes away with great restaurants. the Cathedral is not far with lots of tapas places and the street is crowded most of the time.
The hotel though is quite but like most European hotels, the loby is good, the rest you can do without, just a mediocre mid level hotel.

One high light though, the tapas in the rsetaurant in the hotel (111) are very good.",4,2014,07,24
37,Comfortable and Convenient,"First of all the main attraction for this hotel is location and you would be hard pressed to find something more convenient than the Meridien. Located right on Las Ramblas it is a short walk to Placa de Catalunya and a comfortable walk to the beach down Las Ramblas. The Gothic District is just east of the hotel and there is a metro stop just down the street.

As for the room ours was comfortable if a bit dated. The bathroom had been remodeled and the bed was adequately comfortable. They did have a nice breakfast (included) we were able to take advantage of each morning and there are a number of places to eat within easy walking distance. There is a little restaurant just down the street called Flor de Maig that had wonderful food and great service, one evening the owner came out and sat at the table with us and gave us some pointers on things to see that were ""off the beaten path"" so to speak.",4,2014,07,24
37,Suite Upgrade,"We stayed at the Le Meridian, Barcelona for one night in July. To be honest, I booked this hotel on a pre-paid rate by mistake and the hotel refused to refund the money to us so we ended up changing some plans and staying the night. The evening we checked in, the hotel was running at full capacity so we got upgraded to an amazing suite. 

We really enjoyed our stay the one night we were there. The people were nice and the room was fabulous. The location is quite nice as well. It is smack in the middle of La Rambla so you are close to all the touristy things. I would highly recommend this hotel if it's you're first time in Barcelona and are looking to be close to all the attractions.",5,2014,07,24
37,Just ok,"Disappointed ..... High prices for average outdated rooms. Booked family suite.... Did a bunch of research and upon check in got stuck in old room. Shower gross and moldy. Have been an SPG member for over 10 yrs. Does not amount to much. On a positive note, Location is great with access to all Barcelona has to offer. Of all the hotels I researched for our family, I might have stayed somewhere else.  Or an apartment!i guess lesson is always the same.... If you are a particular traveller, call hotel direct and ask many questions about exactly wHat you want ...... We are giving THEM the business.   550 euros is lots to pay for room anywhere.   Get what you want!  Still stick in an uninspiring room. In regards to safety. Seems ok so far BUT pickpockets are still rampant in Ramblas.  We found a wallet tossed and found the very happy owners . It was gone for 3dys..... Thieves seem to only take money and then toss wallet. Keep wallet at bottom of purse and carry in front of body. ",2,2014,07,23
37,"Great location, great bed, old building","Location is super great. Close to everything. Old town, Gaudi apartment, beach, harbor, cathedral, roman wall, are all within 30 minutes walking distance. 
Internet is slow equivalent to 3rd world country. Whole city is dry like semi dessert. Another strong point is that hotel agent can help you buy ticket to all attraction with same price. Considering queue on site us usually more than one hour, this is great.  ",4,2014,07,23
37,Honest,"I always try to be honest with my reviews as I have found that most reviews on here are either terrible or excellent and nothing in between.

The Hotel is ideally located on the Main Street in Barcelona which means you will never be stuck for somewhere to eat or something to do. It was great to just step out the lobby and be in on the action.

Check in was easy and pleasant. Our room was not ready but this was fine as we were hungry so took the opportunity to get a bite to eat. The receptionist was jolly, friendly and very helpful taking the time to provide us with a map and making suggestions.

We are platinum SPG members but on this occasion the Hotel was fully booked so no upgrades were available so we were in a standard room on the SPG floor. 

The rooms are extremely clean, filled with everything one needs but very basic. This was the most disappointing thing for me. For a 5 star Hotel, the room decor is a little too simple and is more suited to a 4 star. Grey walls, grey floors and red leather chairs. Nothing offensive but not exactly luxury. The bathroom is a lot better with slate floor and wall tiles. The bath tub was deep and very nice for relaxing. The shower is powerful with good pressure. One of the most annoying things about the room is that there are no power sockets at the bed side. I use my phone for business emails and calls and was unable to relax in bed whilst using my phone. 

The food at the Hotel is very good, breakfast especially. There is a delicious selection and the staff are attentive and welcoming.

This is a pleasant Hotel with good service, however the decor leaves a lot to be desired. By the end of my week stay I was seriously missing a beautiful deep armchair and walls with colour instead of the sea of grey! I think this would be a very nice 4 star Hotel.",4,2014,07,20
37,Awesome stay!,"My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights. Best location, right on Las Ramblas, block away from the Boqueria, theaters, Plaza Catalunya, subway, Barrio Gotico, etc… Excellent accommodations,  comfortable beds, very chic and contemporary, excellent breakfast, extremely helpful concierge desk, all in all the best hotel we had in Spain during this trip! 
The bar could use a little more ambiance.",5,2014,07,20
37,"Good Location, friendly and helpful staff","The hotel is located very conveniently, very close to old Barcelona and walking distance to the seaside. Comfortable rooms, restaurant and bar on site, two doors away from a Carrefour and a block north of a great local market on La Rambla.

Parking available as well on site. This is a good place for visiting Barcelona, not sure it would be great for business as there does not appear to be any office concentration nearby although plenty of taxi service and near public transit if necessary to move away from the area.",4,2014,07,20
37,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"We loved our stay at Le Meridien in Barcelona. Great location on the corner of La Ramblas- easy walk to the Placa Catalunya, Gaudi landmarks, the Gothic District and the waterfront. However, still pretty quiet.
Nice size room, helpful concierge.",5,2014,07,18
37,great tourist location - very helpfull service,"Was on a 2 day trip  then came back for one day later in the week. staff very attentive and eager to please. stayed in two separate rooms. the street side rooms where cozy nicely appointed, The only criticism I would have  would be of design, the bathroom is made up of opaque glass doors/walls, sliding, with no lock, very awkward. I stayed on the Rambla side room, which was very nice and had a much better layout. Regardless, you can't go wrong. The concierge (Bruno) was exceptional and it made our trip that much more enjoyable.",4,2014,07,17
37,"Ideal Location, Friendly Staff, Spacious Rooms, Great Property!!","We also booked this hotel because we are Starwood Preferred members and are very glad we did!  The Le Meridien in Barcelona was a fantastic choice for our recent trip to Barcelona!  The hotel is in a perfect location as it is not directly on La Ramblas - but a few steps away.  The staff was very friendly and all spoke wonderful English, I heard them speaking French and Spanish as well.  The hotel was very busy at check-in, but the staff handled it well and were VERY accommodating about our room and were able to help us out by getting us a more spacious room with a rollout bed for our last minute unexpected guest.  The breakfast was amazing and the hotel was very clean and trendy.  It was definitely up to Starwood standards and I will now stay here everytime I travel to Barcelona.  I am a Platinum member and used points to pay for this stay and the staff still applied the room upgrade!  The management was very responsive to our requests and did everything they could to make our stay very pleasant.",5,2014,07,17
37,Excellent service and brilliant location for our 3 day stay in July.,This was a great hotel for our short stay in Barcelona. We had a room on level 5 on the La Ramblas side and had no trouble with noise except for one night when celebrations from the World Cup woke us. The bed was comfortable and a useful feature was the sensor movement night lights. ,5,2014,07,16
37,Ideal central location.,"Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights mid week on business.

As reviewed previously the rooms are not big, they are averagely sized against other European hotels. The room is equipped with satalite television with several lauguage choices, mini bar and air conditioning.

The bathroom is of a high standard, my only concern would be if you have mobility issues it would be a struggle to get into the shower which is incorporated into the high sided bathtub.

Staff are friendly and happy to help.

Breakfast is a well appointed buffet.

Happy to return for business or leisure.",4,2014,07,15
37,Amazing nice !,"We booked at this hotel because we are Starwood Preferred  members, so glad we did.  Check-in early a.m. was quick, but busy.    Our room wasn't ready , so we went  to the very comfortable lobby coffee bar and had breakfast,  The front desk clerk came to us and told us we were to be given a complimentary room to check into while our room was readied, hours away.  So we checked into a normal, nice room then spent hours exploring Barcelona .  Once we returned, we were shown to our room, and we think , the most fabulous room of the hotel.  Gorgeous views over rooftops of the city, and sunset view.  Really, much more than we expected.  I would go back to this hotel just to stay in this room again .
     Across the street is the beautiful Hotel 1898, with a stunning rooftop terrace bar,  don't miss it.
From our hotel in the morning, we could walk 20 steps to Starbucks , the next night, we crossed the street on foot to a fabulous bistro-type restaurant, delicious food.  Great location, you can walk everywhere.  Don't miss going down to the open air farmers market.  Ask anyone, they will direct you. Best part of our stay at this hotel was the fabulous location Ramblas district.",5,2014,07,14
37,Heart of Barcelona & Las Ramblas,We stayed here for 5 nights before our cruise. Perfect location on Las Ramblas! The staff was excellent and very helpful.  We are Gold SPG member and was upgraded to room on 5th flr facing Las Ramblas The view was just ok. FYI: Very noisy during the weekend.  Plus was supermarket around the corner and 2 blocks to the La Boqueria Market.,4,2014,07,13
37,The best hospitality experience and comfort,The family vacation in Barcelona was definitely improved with our stay at the Le Meridien from June 21 through the 26th. As great as the location is only hundreds of feet from La Rambla and a block from a Starbucks and a dozen blocks from many Old City sights we thought the hospitality from the doorman and the front desk and the maid and the bartender were praiseworthy. Each of our interactions was helpful and pleasant.  The front desk took time to help when problems regarding flight and taxi arrangements came up.  The two rooms we had were spotless and very tasteful with many comforts. A surprise of delicious fresh apples were present in our hallway.  The sangria in the bar was very refreshing. The lobby barista served a great expresso . We were given a sense of welcome and were charmed by Baecelona. It would be easy to say Yes to a return visit to this hotel.  As a parent I felt the facilities were safe for my children at all times.,5,2014,07,12
37,Very Good Stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights and everything was excellent. 

The facilities were great, the location was superb and the room was wonderful! Staff were very friendly and helpful as well. 

It's right next the Carrefour supermarket and right on the busy street of Las Ramblas where you get a really good view of all the action that's happening outside. 

From the hotel, 100 meters away to the left is the Plaza Catalunya. Less the 100 meters away to the right is the La Bouqeria market (which you absolutely have to pass by) and that market is right next to the subway station as well. Tons of shopping areas in that location and very accessible. 

For the triple room, it was very spacious as the extra bed was given. The bathroom was very clean (although the floor can get a bit cold and the tub a bit slippery) and the hairdryer would blast away--very salon-like. :) hehe.",5,2014,07,12
37,"Great location, friendly staff!","Barcelona was the first stop on our honeymoon and this hotel was so welcoming and friendly.  As our first stop in the country and first time in this city, we had lots of questions that the front desk staff and concierge were always more than willing to assist with.  Our room was very nice and more than met our needs, with lots of room to store our luggage and belongings and a bathroom with ample counterspace for a couple.",5,2014,07,10
37,Great location!,"Located just off Las Ramblas, the metro and walking distance to a lot of attractions, this hotel is perfect. It is clean and decorated with a modern flair. The staff are very attentive and know English well. The rooms are a decent size and also have a modern decor. 
The breakfast  we had there had a wonderful selection of hot and cold items. I would stay again primarily because of the location, but the hotel in general was not that bad.",4,2014,07,09
37,Excellent location,"The hotel was on the Las Ramblas ....great hotel, room was lovely and clean a little noisy as the subway was just a few rooms away but didn't really bother us...breakfast was included and was excellent....free wifi which was very fast. Staff were very helpful and friendly...would definitely recommend this hotel...the only down side was the bed it was a little low and the shower over the bath was a little hard to get into if like me you have a little arthritis.",5,2014,07,09
37,"Location is the best, room is good, service needs improvement","We stayed for three nights in June, the is the second time we stayed at Le Meridien, very good location, within walkIng distance to attractions. Decoration both inside and outside of the room is good, clean, comfortable beddings, house keeping needs improvement, it took one hour when we asked for an adapter and the thought it was delivered. 

Our room has a big outside space/balcony where we can sit and enjoy sunshine, very nice view too. Inside the room is not very proportionate, the wardrobe is way too small and there is only space for one chair inside the room.

Having Breakfast at the restaurant is good, street view, nice food",4,2014,07,09
37,Ok stay,"We stayed here recently for 5 nights on SPG points; we are both SPG Platinum as we travel alot for work. We also used suite rewards.

I would say the stay was OK, and depends what you are looking for. The best ""pro and con"" for the hotel are the same thing ... location.

Check-in - very fast and friendly though we were supposed to have a prestige suite and were given a family suite ... still not sure what the difference is though there were no prestige suites available for our stay to move to. They did show my wife another room, but liked the second option less.

Room - average. Wasn't a big fan of the rooms at all. As well, the bed was quite uncomfortable. Nice bathroom, great shower .. this made up for the bed. Here is the ""con"" - Biggest issue of the stay was the noise. Even though we faced the back roads, between the screaming and outside noises, early deliveries and crashing of glass at pickup early each morning, my wife hardly slept at all each night and we considered changing hotels two nights in.

Hotel - no pool ... that was a disappointment but the beach is close by. Back to the ""pro"" .. great location to all the action if that is what you are looking for. We tend to prefer being a few blocks from the action.

Breakfast - we did have breakfast at the hotel each morning which was quite nice and had a great selection.

Service - the service throughout the hotel was top notch for sure.

Overall - nice location, a little to close to the action (and all the noise) for us .. if we return to Barcelona we would most likely stay elsewhere",3,2014,07,08
37,Great Hotel,"This hotel is right in the centre of Barcelona and is perfectly located for people wanting to experience what the city offers.  You are only a couple of minutes from the Metro and there are many restaurants close by.  The hotel caters well for Australians with all the staff having some English speaking skills, enough to make themselves understood anyway.",5,2014,07,07
37,All about location...,"Arrived to be told that the double room we had booked wasnt booked and that we had actually booked a twin room.. When i asked the receptionist to change she said that she would do her best as the room wasnt ready until 3pm. We decided to go out for lunch and a mooch around the local area.. WOW what a great location you are in the thick of it ! Fresh market just down the road was amazing, go and have a look around hen you are hungry :  )
After a few drinks and about 5 kilo's of iberian ham we arrived back to be given our room 230. The twin bed's had been pushed together but bedding as two singles rather than a double duvet etc.. I assume the receptionist didnt try her best here..
The bar area in my opinion was under staffed in the evening had to wait on each evening to be served, to be honest that helped me in making my mind up whether to have a few early drinks in the bar or go out ...! 
Front of house team on the door and reception was always very attentive, professional and happy..",4,2014,07,06
37,great surprise,"Talk about a great location. This was at the end of a long vacation and if I had it to do over I would stay here 3-4 days. It is in the heart of everything. Sights, Food, Entertainment...The hotel is clean and in a very safe area. Rooms are large and everything you need is right outside your hotel. What more can you ask for. The staff was super nice and I would tell my family to go their when in Barcelona ...",5,2014,07,05
37,A breath of fresh air in Barcelona,"Le Meridien in Barcelona is a breath of fresh air. From the moment we arrived until we departed, the staff was wonderful, helpful and friendly. Compared to my stays this trip at Starwood in Brussels and Le Meridien in Paris, this should be the standard and the other locations should send their staffs for training in Barcelona.

We arranged for a private transfer from the airport and it was perfect. The sign was displayed and it was a pleasant trip to the hotel.

The hotel is located on La Rambla, but the entrance is on a side street. This is a happening area so security is always present in the lobby and you need a room key to activate the elevator. The rooms have been recently re-done and they are lovely. The feel is young, modern and the comforts are all present. We had three great nights of sleep, the HVAC worked perfectly, the rooms were quiet and there were plenty of pillows. 

The bath is a little small and you need to be careful operating the shower, it takes a little patience the first time, but once you master the overhead shower head it is a great shower. The toiletries are all high end and there was a small bottle of perfume to take with. Internet access was easy and efficient.

Breakfast, if not included, is Euro25. It includes a full buffet plus an omelet maker. We ordered a different omelet each day and they were perfectly made. Other options are pastries (croissant were delicious), cheeses, charcutterie, juices, fruits and a few cold cereals. Although not massive, the trays are filled regularly. 

The Concierge was available to help with any request. We arranged tours, dinner reservations, airport transfers, wine and cheese suggestions. They were pleasant and efficient.

They will call for a cab and that is a good idea. We flagged one going by one of the nights and the charges were 50% higher than when they called for it. They keep tabs on the cars and the fees. 

The only nick was the transfer they arranged to the airport on departure. We asked for a mini-van since we were 4 people and 5 pieces of luggage. They arranged for a 6 seat MB van on the inbound leg and we thought we would have a similar vehicle. They ordered a 16 passenger mini bus for the four of us. The driver did not speak English and dropped us at the wrong part of Terminal 1. It was a very long walk back to the correct area.

I would return to this Le Meridien when back in the area. They know exactly how to treat their guests.",5,2014,07,05
37,Center of the center,This location of this hotel was perfect.  Great amenities.  Rooms were really nice and spacious we felt.  Very modern look.  Easy access to La Ramblas Street which is where you want to be.  friendly staff.,5,2014,07,05
37,Pros & cons!,"Booked a short stay with voyage prive, price was great ..However!!! Cheers VP for sending us to the furthest airport away without informing us!! Not hotels fault tho 
So pros ;
Great concierge (Gil?) helped organise the trek back to Reus this morning
Perfect location
Nice quiet room
AMAZING BED

Cons:
Grubby bathroom (seriously not nice) only 1 robe
Faulty TV (sound)
Breakfast - had better 3*
Mirror at desk too high - sounds silly but couldn't sit & dry hair. 

Overall 'good' hotel but would not wanted to have paid top price (although wasn't exactly cheap)

",3,2014,07,05
37,Wonderful Room and Ramblas too!,"With the bar/restaurant of Le Meridien facing the famous Ramblas pedestrian walk, I could not have asked for a more centrally located hotel. Just what I expected, sleek tasteful modern, yet keeping the surrounding culture to heart. My favorite part, three large glass vases filled with ice and glass pitchers with three choices of Sangria. What a way to say Welcome to Barcelona, Yum!",5,2014,07,05
37,Modern and Comfortable; Some quirks,"The location of this hotel cannot be beat.  The front desk staff were always charming and helpful with maps, directions, and restaurant recommendations.  You are steps from Las Ramblas and the whirlwind of tourists and shops.  Easy base for walking through la Boqueria, el barri gottic, and even down to the harbor.

The room we had was on the 5th floor overlooking in the back of the building.  No view to speak of but quiet overlooking some Barcelona apartments.  The room was very modern and quite frankly, we had problems trying to figure out the lighting.  We enjoyed the shower with rain shower head very much.  We also enjoyed having a tea kettle in the room (our prior hotel did not have that amenity.).  

One thing that was bothersome, was that the bedding in the room was damp.  When we lay down to sleep, we felt like we had been in swimming.  THe next day, when the issue was no better, I called to have the bedding changed.  The desk promptly sent up housekeeping to fix the issue.

We did not eat in the hotel so I cant comment on the food quality.

Overall, this was a nice hotel, a quirky building and perfect for its location.",4,2014,07,02
37,Perfect Location - Amazing Hotel,"Le Meridian Barcelona has a perfect location in Barcelona right on the Ramblas.  You can walk or metro easily to shopping, waterfront, restaurants, and all of the popular sight seeing locations.  The well trained staff are very accommodating and will make you feel at home.  The rooms are lovely, very comfortable and quiet for a nice rest.  This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Europe and a good value!",5,2014,07,02
37,Great Location & Service,"First time to Barcelona we thoroughly enjoyed staying the Le Meridien. On arrival we were booked into a Family Suite & then upgraded to a junior suite. Great surprise. The hotel is very central, clean & a great breakfast. We've had an amazing chef at the egg station (28 June to 1 July) in the breakfast area who had the best personality & made you feel extremely welcomed every morning. We looked forward to seeing him every morning. The other staff in the breakfast area including supervisors could take a note out of his book & smile & at least try to make you welcome not like an inconvenience. Front desk & concierge were very helpful throughout our stay.",5,2014,07,01
37,Stay at the Le Meridien when visiting Barcelona,"What more can you ask for when your hotel is in the heart of the city at La Rambla. That was the biggest selling point for booking my stay at the Meridien. Besides that, it is a Meridien. And one of the best Meridien's I've stayed at in some time. Being a Platinum member of the SPG program, I was updgared to a Suite. The lobby staff was courteous and efficient, and the concierge was helpful and informative.The room was very comfortable. I did not get a chance of moving around and exploring the city as I was preparing for my golf tournament, but I did manage to try some of the food at the hotel. The breakfast buffet was really good and set me up for a good day of golf. Barcelona is one of the best cities in the world I have ever been to and living at the Le Meridien heightened the experience even more.",5,2014,06,30
37,Great location,"This hotel had a prime central location that was in the middle of a shopping district, with restaurants and cafes within a stone's throw.  We had an easy and fast check in and were appointed a very spacious suite.  We were delighted to see that we had an enormous deck that was about the same size of our room, complete with a large outdoor dining table, comfy lounge chairs, and an outdoor shower.  We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel and especially enjoyed the location.",5,2014,06,30
37,LOVED LeMeridien and Barcelona,"We stayed at the Le Meridien hotel for 6 days as part of an extended business trip.  LOVED Barcelona, and loved Le Meridien.  The rooms were nicely decorated and spotless.  The lobby staff was courteous and efficient, and the concierge was helpful and informative.  We ate at the breakfast buffet every morning and it had a large variety of healthy and delicious options.  The location was excellent…near all the action of La Rambla.  I would definitely recommend Le Meridien and would stay again. 

Make sure you stop by the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria (outdoor food market), located about 3 blocks East (toward the water).  It's AMAZING! 

I'm not a shopper at heart, but I loved looking through all the windows and seeing something different...not the same old chain...Gap, Macy's, etc.  While walking through the old gothic area (La Ribera), I saw one storefront with handmade shoes...and the cobbler was working on a pair in the back.  Also saw a dressmaker working on clothes she sold in her store.  The architecture is so charming, with narrow, winding streets.  I spent hours just strolling the streets. 

If you stay at  Le Meridien over a Sunday, stop by the Cathedral (in El Gotic) at noon and witness the native music and dance.  It’s a simple, easy dance that you’re welcome to join.  Don’t miss the La Sagrada Familia (Gaudi).  It is truly one of a kind and you’ll never see anything like it elsewhere.   We also enjoyed the MUHCA Placa del Rei,  the  La Padrera (another Gaudi…don’t miss the rooftop) , and the Picasso museum.   I’m convinced the makers of “Star Wars” got their inspiration from Gaudi.  He was truly ahead of his time, and still is.  

Barcelona is definitely tourist friendly with most people speaking enough English to be helpful.  The area felt very safe and comfortable even late at night.  There are so many things to see and do that we'll just have to return.  LOVE Barcelona!!!!",5,2014,06,25
37,Great location but room is not typical Le Meridien/Starwood quality,"We are SPG gold members and were so disappointed by our room. We arrived at 6pm and they had to keep checking if the room was even ready at that time. We arrived at our room on the 2nd floor (first concern - very low floor) and our hearts sank. The room was tiny and faced a brick wall with local apartments above it.  We called the front desk to see if we could switch and the only other rooms were 2nd floor street (very noisy) or 4th floor right above our existing room, so we decided to stay put. The cleanliness was questionable - stains around the bathroom walls and on the backboard of the bed, sticky blow dryer.....The room (maybe all?) needs a thorough deep cleaning. I was pretty grossed out. If the location wasn't so amazing I would give it zero stars but I guess that's their hook. Location is perfectly situated to get to everything in Barcelona within a 10 minute walk. So if you're willing to overlook the fact that this is not your typical sparkling Starwood property, then I would recommend staying here for the location alone. If you want that luxurious feeling in your room offered by mostly all Starwood properties, do not stay here.",3,2014,06,25
37,Excellent Las Ramblas hotel and terrific staff!,"We stayed here 3 nights as part of a post-AMA Waterways Rhone cruise.  I must say when the tour bus pulled up in the Las Ramblas area we were all (as in the bus load of passengers) a bit taken back at the crowds of people everywhere!  As tour busses cannot pull up directly to the hotel, (it has to stop a couple blocks up in the city square) we had to circle the blocks a couple times to wait for a space to let off our bus load of passengers.  It wasn't a good introduction to Barcelona (fortunately we had been before), but our our first impressions quickly faded when we arrived at the hotel.  I point this out as a positive, so you don't freak out if you arrive late in the afternoon and see tons of people everywhere - you readily adapt to the flow once settled in.   Las Ramblas is crowded of course, but the hotel entrance is conveniently located off a side street, and  actually has a quaint and quiet neighborhood feel to it. 

The hotel staff was wonderful and spoke fluent and very understandable English.  Everyone we encountered, from the front desk, bell staff, restaurant, bar etc, was friendly, professional, and genuinely seemed to make sure you were well cared for.  The front desk especially was top notch, answering my multiple questions over my stay, and provided maps, suggestions, and directions etc, always with a smile.  

Our room was on the second floor, and although only a block from Las Ramblas (down a side street), it was amazingly quiet.  I will say the elevators are tiny,  however there is a beautiful red staircase (someone posted a photo of this already) that we used to walk up one floor to our 2nd floor room.  The room had a long rack near the entrance, which was great for storing our luggage - really a great idea, and saved space too.  A safe was in the closet area, as were two robes for our use while there.  There is a mini-bar in the room as well, and the ice machine is just down the hall.

The bed was comfortable and the TV was wall mounted on the wall across from it.  There was  a comfortable wide chair for lounging, and another chair by the desk.  The hotel has a couple levels of wifi access, but we were fine with the basic (free) internet for emails, and could even do FaceTime back to the States as well using it.

The bathroom was very large and modern, with large sliding opaque glass doors.  The bath had a large tub/shower, with nice quality shampoo, lotion, and conditioners.  Nice large towels too.

We had a nice buffet breakfast each day in the restaurant which was included with our vouchers.  One day we sat in the overflow area of the adjacent bar, but did not have to wait more than a few moments for this to be setup.  

We stopped by the bar a couple nights for a nightcap, and thought the prices were quite reasonable for an upscale hotel such as this.  Didn't eat at the hotel for dinner, as there are many places close by.  We had read and been told by others 'Don't eat on Las Ramblas', but there were a couple nice restaurants that were the exception; one being The Attic, which is just across and up the street (on Las Ramblas) . We really enjoyed our meal there.

The hotel staff gave us suggestions for other places as well, just off of Las Ramblas, and an easy walk.  We had no problem with safety, although as anyone will tell you watch out for pickpockets anywhere in Barcelona, and don't leave items unattended.",5,2014,06,24
37,Rather disappointing,"This is a Westin hotel and as regular SPG members we booked this hoping for a standard as high as the Westin Valencia but were somewhat disappointed. 
Rooms were well equipped but small and a little cramped for two people.The bathroom was inadequate with shower over bath which didn't work too well on the combination tap. The loo was in the bathroom which means if someone is using the bath one has to wait. No bidet. Lots of nice towels and facecloths.
The breakfast promised much and looked great but delivered less on flavour. The tea and coffee were tepid although service was very good and trying to please.
The room was quiet and cool which was a plus for being so close to the noisy Ramblas.
WiFi is free in the bedrooms which is good and not always a feature in Spain or France which it 
should be.
All in all this hotel is a bit of a curates egg. Don't think I will be returning.",3,2014,06,24
37,Were are the stars,"Check in  .. Room 521 , a kind of prison , no view , walls . Changed to 508 . Rambla view . Nice . Now roomservice : no menu etc to be found . After calling frontdesk  , we get the minibarlist...... Again calling , someone come and looks under the matras for a list...finally the roomservice menu . We order a bottle of veuve cliquot ... They do not have a bottle . Have to settle for Mum . No apoligies . One star is to much.",1,2014,06,24
37,Excellent Location and Service in a Beautiful Hotel,The staff always had smiles on their faces and were eager to help us. They got us into our room early which helped us in our time adjustment. The rooms were very good with a night light system that came on when you got out of bed. The breakfast buffet was superb and had a cook who would do omelets or fried eggs on the spot. The location is right off La Ramblas and near many attractions.,5,2014,06,22
37,"Perfect location, excellent service","We stayed at Le Meridian Barcelona before starting our cruise. The hotel is located in the middle of the action on Las Ramblas, so it is an easy walk to the water or many restaurants or sights. Our room on the 5th floor was excellent. Try to avoid lowest floors, as it may be noisy outside. Even before we arrived, e-mails to Monica Garcia in guest relations were handled much to our satisfaction.  There is plenty to do in Barcelona and lucky for the guests, Ricardo, the expert concierge, goes out of his way to assist you in planning your day. In fact, everyone at the hotel was quite friendly and helpful.  Try the breakfast buffet, it is well worth the money.  Le Meridian will be our stop when we return to Barcelona.",5,2014,06,21
37,"This time around, they had it all right!","This was our second visit to Le Meridien Barcelona this year, and while my previous experience and review here on tripadvisor was one with mixed feeling, this time they had it all right!
Upon checkin around 5PM, the manager greeted us, and told us they had a suite for us waiting (complimentary platinum upgrade) but it was not yet cleaned, so they offered us another room for the time being to relax in.
After we went out in Barcelona for a couple of hours, we came back around 8.30PM and the manager approached us again saying that they had a very nice, out of the SPG program, suite waiting for us. This particular suite is advertised as a Mediterranean suite on their website. Upon entering the suite, we were immediately impressed by how new it was and the FABULOUS terras with loungers, table for 6, some fat boys and an outdoor shower, all bathing in privacy. The room itself has a nice, warm color scheme and the bathroom had a nice big soaking tub and a seperate rain shower. We absolutely loved this suite! My fiancee told me it was in fact the nicest hotel suite she ever stayed in.
Another to thing I need to complement the hotel on, was their breakfast in the morning. While our first experience a couple of months ago was a bit hectic, this time, the staff was really friendly and took the time to make us feel welcome. The offering in the breakfast buffet is all you could wish for, up to Le Meridien standards. 

In short, we enjoyed our stay very much and would be happy to return here.",5,2014,06,20
37,Great Location. Great Service. Great Hotel,"My family and I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona in mid May for over a week.  The hotel added immeasurably to a wonderful visit to the city.  Right on Las Ramblas, it is in the middle of where you want to be—a stone’s throw from Roman tombs, the Boqueria, Barri Gotic, and Plaza Catalunya, plus the color and activity of Las Ramblas itself.  

The service culture of the hotel is exemplary—from senior managers like Walter Rijkers (who on his own initiative upgraded our room to better accommodate our needs), to the concierges (Gil and Bruno were patient, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful), to the cooks and housekeeping (whatever we needed appeared instantly).  This is not a large impersonal establishment, but one that conveys so well a sense of wanting its guests to enjoy Catalan hospitality and the joys of the city.   After a long morning exploring it was so easy to pop into the hotel for a break.  

The restaurant and bar had first rate food at reasonable prices, and with the huge picture windows one could continue observing Barcelona go by.  When you wanted, there are scores of restaurants, stores, and street happenings in any direction of the hotel.  

We cannot thank Walter and the entire staff enough for their obvious dedication and pride in their professions and their contributions to an extraordinary vacation.

Ron, Washington DC",5,2014,06,20
37,"Great Location, Rooms a bit small","This hotel has a wonderful location, great concierge service, and friendly staff.  We had a hiccup with a late checkout, but it was resolved without too much effort.  I've stayed here before, and would stay here again.  It is expensive, but again, you can't beat the location.",4,2014,06,19
37,Great location,"I stayed here for 5 nights of vacation and thoroughly enjoyed it. I found all the staff to be very helpful and accommodating. I mostly interacted with the front desk staff and the concierge, and both teams were very supportive - it was nice to feel very well taken care of. The concierge team also helpfully responded to my emails before my visit, which helped me plan my schedule and excursions.

The best part of this hotel has to be the location - I loved just wandering around the area at any time of day. I also found it very easy to walk to the other sites I wanted to see, like Barceloneta beach (I think that was about a 30 minute walk) and Sagrada Familia (same).",5,2014,06,18
37,Great hotel in the perfect location for seeing Barcelona,"Stayed for 5 nights in May on holiday with my husband and another couple.  

The staff was nice and helpful throughout the visit.  We had a rental car, so needed some extra help with parking, etc, and the staff could not have been more eager to help.  Concierge also helpful to find the best restaurants.

There is a gym - not huge, but glad they had it.  Some weights and equipment also 2 treadmills and 2 elliptical machines.

The rooms were modern and in perfect repair.  For being in the city, the size was good.  We had a front facing room that was very quiet.  We heard that the side facing Las Ramblas could be noisy, which is understandable.

Location was great - on Las Ramblas, near the Gothic Quarter and walkable to lots of restaurants.  Also near a city tour bus stop.  Great tapas restaurant just across the street. 

Would definitely stay here again if lucky enough to make another visit to this fun city!

",5,2014,06,18
37,Excellent service and stay,"I would highly recommend this hotel. It is in a great location. We were upgraded due to my husband's status and the adjoining rooms were fabulous!  Large, clean rooms overlooking La Rambla. Chocolates at night!  I would stay here again any day. Hermes cologne and great shampoo/conditioners. These little things make such a huge difference when traveling.  Service was impeccable. Everyone was always friendly and helpful. The restaurant across the street is convenient and another great little place to go to (Luzia). Within walking distance to many of the sights of the city. We were on the 7th floor so we did not notice much street noise. Highly recommended!",5,2014,06,17
37,Fantastic Location. Upscale Hotel,"Standing at the window of your room overlooking the Ramblas is not too hard to take.  Activity is happening throughout the day and night.  The hotel is ideally located for everything...food...shopping...touring and people watching.  The lobby coffee stand is perfect for grabbing a quick coffee and croissant.  Staff is very helpful and approachable. With all of that said, we had a weird situation. One of the bed coils was sticking through sheet.  Hopefully that's been handled by now! Go across the street and order a pizza.  Simply done and so perfect.  Well worth a visit.",5,2014,06,16
37,Great experience,"What a great experience we had at the La Meridian. Upon our arrival, we were treated to a nice upgrade, a room ready to move into and most of a all a pleasant staff. This hotel is centrally located to all of the La  Rambles sites. Just to share one experience, I went to the restaurant one morning to grab a coffee for my wife and at least 5 of the staff greeted me while I waited. They are trained for customer service!! We will stay here again!!   ",5,2014,06,15
37,Simple convenience,"Our Barcelona honeymoon was made more memorable by the convenience of this hotel. Perfectly located near the subway station and station for hop on hop off bus tour, bed is super comfy, breakfast is simply sumptous and staff are courteous. This is truly simple extravagance...",4,2014,06,14
37,Excellent stay in an excellent hotel,"I was invited for a short stay in Barcelona Spain last week, and had the opportunity to stay at Le Meridien. What ""exclusive"" I heard about this hotel is completely true: excellent service, excellent staff, great rooms, very modern, stylish, luxurious,... you think of it and it is there.
Minibar, luxury soap set in bathroom, bathrobe, tv in bathroom, light dimming, wired internet in room,... I also had extraordinary breakfast and enjoyed the perfect atmosphere in the bar.",5,2014,06,14
37,One of worst Le Meridien hotels,"I favour SPG hotel group, so booked for weekend at Le Meridien Barcelona in busy summer season.

I was little early for check-in and was told I will be given usual upgrade to better room (as SPG Platinum) so was asked to wait... Without any reasons, the room was not ready until 5pm, I guess it is typical for Spain. I was told that room has been upgraded from sperior, but I see no difference, but annoyingly, it face main street where parties continue all night. 

I asked for another room for following day, but was told it is not possible to change because changing bed sheets blah blah blah.... 

Room was meant to have a good view, but half of the curtain covers the wall, so I only see bit from one window. Room is tidy but small (yes not worth 340 EUR per night for sure!)

Breakfast is so so, nothing specutacular. 

I will definatley not come back to this Le Meridien for sure.",2,2014,06,14
37,Sightseeing in every direction!,"Took mom to Spain for her birthday, first stop was in Barcelona.  Hotel is on a small street just off Las Ramblas and super close to the main Plaza de Catalunya where one can shop at the Corte Ingles or board the hop-on/hop-off tour buses.  It's so centric that each day we were able to wander out in any direction and get to the gorgeous artistic sites the city has to offer.  Room was modern, decent size, and staff was attentive.  Granted, they don't always make the first salutation, but they were always attentive when I came to request anything, including a transfer to the airport.

The surrounding restaurants are a bit pricey for dinner.  So we would always eat and find good places to eat in whatever other part of town we were.  Don't forget to visit the Palacio de Musica Catalunya ... possibly the most gorgeous concert hall interior we've ever seen!",5,2014,06,13
37,Unbeatable location and staff - worth every penny,"Located right on La Rambla and close to train and buses. Staff were extremely lovely, service was top-notch -- everything from the check-in welcome to remembering to place miniature bottles of sunscreen outside on our lounge chairs on the terrace. Breakfast was also great with lots of fresh foods and pastries. Rooms were modern, beautiful (especially the bathrooms) and despite it central location, it was very quiet. One of my favorite SPG hotels in the world and can't wait to revisit the next time we are in Barcelona!",5,2014,06,11
37,"Great location, sucky bed","Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien.  We liked the close, but right around the corner, location of the property relative to La Rambla.  Staff was very friendly.  Room was nice, but on the small side.  Bathroom had a very spacious shower with two options for water flow - a rain bath or your traditional spray - what a treat!  TV was quite small.  We had a 'king' room, which was really two twin beds put together.  Unfortunately, one of the twins was really sunken in, so it wasn't the most comfortable sleep.  We were celebrating my fiancé's 40th birthday on this trip and were nicely surprised to see a bottle of cava in an ice bucket and glasses waiting for us one evening.  Thanks, Le Meridien, for the wonderful stay!",4,2014,06,10
37,Perfect Location in Barcelona,"We stayed here for one night en route to another destination, and couldn't have chosen a more well-located base to give ourselves a quick taste of this marvelous city.  While located on La Rambla, and a quick walk to the boqueria, the Gothic Quarter, and the waterfront, while inside we were insulated from noise and crowds.  Our room was ""green"" (lights don't go on unless you put a key in the light switch, etc.), but soothingly comfortable.  The luxe bath had awesome water pressure.  The staff speak wonderful English so I didn't have to embarrass myself too badly with my barely-passable Spanish.",4,2014,06,10
37,"Location, service and amenities all great","Located right on La Rambla the hotel is close to everything including the Born district and Gothic Quarter.   Staff is attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  The rooms are spacious, well appointed and quiet.  Loved it and would go again.",4,2014,06,09
37,GREAT VENUE,"The perfect hotel for a great time in Barcelona. The staff, service, amenities, and rooms are perfect, in addition to the location. You are a block from the largest market, across the street from shopping, and close to the train station. We will stay there every time we visit Barcelona.",5,2014,06,09
37,Stay There!,"Le Meridien in Barcelona is in an ideal position to see the city - right on La Rambla. Service is excellent and staff members re all courteous and friendly. Unfortunately not all of them speak fluent English, which is probably my problem, not theirs. After all, we ARE in Spain.
Rooms are very comfortable and clean and the service is what one would expect from a five-star hotel.
A good restaurant, without being great.",5,2014,06,08
37,Very good experience,Very very centrally located. Right in the middle of the Ramblas. The rooms are good and the breakfast was excellent. Would definitely stay here again but the only little drawback was that the hotel could give 2 ply or 3 ply toilet paper instead of the rough paper that was there in the bathrooms. The staff esp the concierge was very helpful.,4,2014,06,08
37,Very good for vacation,"Stayed here 3 nights. Clean, comfortable, nice bathrooms, free wifi, nice staff, excellent location on the main road. Great for a 3-5 day vacation, but not for work. Had a 1 day meeting there and the meeting room is terrible.",4,2014,06,07
37,"Best location, but you pay for it","We stayed here a few times and loved it for its location right on the Rambla and central to the port area and the old city.  The hotel itself was very nice too.  Howeve, they renovated a few years ago to a more ""modern"" style (I preferred the previous look) and the prices almost doubled.  It is still a very good option in Barcelona, but be ready to pay more than you think it's worth.",4,2014,06,07
37,Wonderful staff & a great property!,"From the moment I was greeted at the front desk to my check out, the staff was all about providing a fantastic experience. Location is super convenient to all Barcelona has to offer! Went for a long weekend to see the futbol match Barc v At.Madrid with my 14 yr old nephew. We had a nice room overlooking the street, although did not spent much time in the room other than to sleep. I must say the staff were some of the best IMHO. At check-in Vanessa took care of things right away and her warmth was genuine. The concierge Bruno was amazing, all his recommendations were spot on and he went above and beyond in helping get my futbol tickets sorted out. 
I used my SPG points as a platinum member (digg'in that SPG loyalty program).  I would certainly recommend this hotel and will be coming back!",5,2014,06,05
37,great location average room,"This hotel is in the best location of the city. The room was average, the service was pretty good for Europe. Concierge was very helpful. I would stay there again.
It was a snap taking the bus to the airport from hotel, 2 block walk and only $10 versus cab ride about $45",3,2014,06,05
37,"Convenient, Well Managed and Friendly Staff","We toured northern Spain in late April/May and this hotel (3 days) was our first introduction to big city Catalan life. We were impressed by the location (steps from Las Ramblas and about a mile from the Mediteranian) which allowed us easy foot access to many historic venues and city parks. We also took advantage of the grocery store located right outside and to the left  of the hotel restaurant facing Las Ramblas. Inexpensive wine and freshly made to go items are available for those not wanting to wait until the normal Spanish dinner hour.  

Hotel staff, especially front desk personnel, were very friendly and always extremely helpful. Check-in was performed quickly and we appreciated the ability to access our room early. The room itself was fairly modern in design but was beginning to show it's age. Not surprising with the usual high occupancy rate.

For those who like to get out and walk or jog for exercise I recommend avoiding very early starts (many suspect characters loitering up and down Las Ramblas). During the main part of the day the street is just too crowded and smoky. Instead, ask directions to the Giant Parc de La Cuitadella which is about 15 minutes away by foot. 

Overall this hotel is comfortable and a good choice as a base for exploring all that Barcelona has to offer.",4,2014,06,05
37,Amazing hotel,"We had no idea this hotel would touch us the way it has. This wonderful find combines old world charm elegantly with sophisticated modern decor that blends perfectly into one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in at any price. The details of the room were exquisite and provided every comfort. The service could not have been better, and the location likewise is in the heart of the action but with quality construction maintaining quiet in the room.  Le Meridien made the list of one of our top 5 hotels in the world.  We want to come back for a month!",5,2014,06,05
37,Superb location...small rooms,"Spot on- La Ramblas can't get a better location. Lively street with loads of Restaurants. A few nice halal restaurants as well. A mosque is located 5 mins walk away from the hotel. Take the hospital street after the market on your right walking down the Ramblas from the hotel.
The rooms are Small, staff is very pleasant. The safe box in the room can't fit a laptop bigger than 15"".

The breakfast is okay- selection is limited.

In room service is pretty fast.
Bed was too soft.
TV channel selection is poor.

Overall a nice lively area to stay in.
Be careful walking alone at night after mid-night. Too many pick pockets in all shapes and sizes..

 

",3,2014,06,01
37,Good hotel in Barcelona,"Great location, 20 mins from the airport, (about 30 euros).  The rooms vary, some larger than others.  If you are a member of starwood preffered Guest, then they put you in a really nice room.  But in general, the ""normal"" rooms are fine too.  Comfy beds, great shower, good breakfast (worth it). Little extras.. there's a sensor night light which is pretty cool, ipod dock (was a saviour as I forgot to bring my iphone charger).  Just a step away from La Rambla, where it's all happening.  So would stay here again as price is very reasonable for such a central hotel.",4,2014,05,31
37,Nice Barcelona Hotel,"Great location, but rooms were not as large as we would have liked. Helpful concierge.  Cabs were easy to find, and laundromat was a 10 minute walk from hotel.  Free internet. Weather was fine, not too warm, but AC wasn't usable.",4,2014,05,29
37,The center of action!!!,"I used SPG points so I cannot comment on the value.  I will say this hotel is in the center of the action in Barcelona.  The accommodations; staff; food; and drink were all very good.  I would return here again.

You are very close to the open air market and the water front.",5,2014,05,29
37,User friendly,"First time in Spain and in Barcelona. My husband and I arrived one day early before joining a tour. We had the fortunate experience to meet Ricardo, the hotel concierge who helped us plan the best use of our time.
Although it's the job of the concierge to help their guest in making plans, we were impressed with the  enthusisiam shown by Ricardo about his beautiful city.
We felt genuine concern in Ricardo's manner as we went over information that he no doubt covers multiple times to guest on a daily basis. He still made us feel important.
Our encounter here was our first impression of Spain and it's warm, welcoming people.",5,2014,05,28
37,Exceptional Experience!,This was my first time staying in Barcelona. It really was a wonderful visit. The hotel was more contemporary that I expected and very well located.  The staff was very warm and helpful. The food excellent. The Breakfast Buffet was wonderful complete with warm and very excellent chocolate sauce. Our room had a beautiful view and that is worth paying a supplement for. They have a complementary business center. We used the Consierge service a lot. They provided tickets for the Gaudi events which saved waiting in lines. I look forward to my return trip to this wonderful property.,5,2014,05,28
37,"Great place, no worries, no hassles, great location, absolutely loved the hotel and the service.","So nice to stay at a place where you don't have to worry about anything.  Great location, the staff is so helpful and friendly.  It was nice to truly enjoy the vacation because they took care to tend to whatever needs we had.  Just absolutely great service, I am definitely coming back to this hotel. It is worth the money to be worry free and hassle free.  You can't beat peace of mind.",5,2014,05,28
37,"Great staff, property and perfect location",We stayed at Le Meridien for 3 fabulous nights.  Every interaction with the front desk staff to the concierge was warm and personal.  Extremely helpful with dinner recommendations and answers to the sights that are a must see.  This hotel is centrally located and easy to walk to all of the sights in the city.  Their breakfast was awesome - best coffee and food selection in a long time.  The room we stayed in was super quiet with the windows closed and a great view of La Rambla.  We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Barcelona.,5,2014,05,27
37,"Great location, friendly staff","I've been in this hotel many times both for business and pleasure: hotel and staff are at top.
Rooms are different rom each other, but most of them are very comfortable. Location is superb: few steps from the Liceu theatre or from Paseo de Gracia or from the Marina. The restaurant is good and convenient for lunch. At the bar they make a superb ""old fashioned"" cocktail.",4,2014,05,27
37,Great location,"There are many places to walk from the hotel - good food, public transportation, and interesting sites. Staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. A good place to stay in Barcelona and close to waterfront restaurants.",4,2014,05,27
37,Centrally located in Barcelona,"We stayed here for a couple of nights in late April. The hotel is centrally located to most of the major touristy venues. The hotel room was simple and clean. We didn't spent too much time in our hotel since we were in the heart of Barcelona. 

We walked to the following must sees from our hotel - La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, Las Ramblas and the beach. I'd like to credit our concierge at Le Meridian named Bruno. He was very helpful in mapping out where we should go and provided us with several dinner locations during our stay. For Park Guell, I don't think it is worth spending money to go within the gated section of the park. If you hike high enough through Park Guell you'll be at the very top of the park overlooking the entire city of Barcelona. If you're able, this is a must do. For La Sagrada Familia, I recommend taking a self guided tour with the headphones provided to you when you walk into the church grounds. The tour is very interesting and not terribly long. If you find yourself at the Beach in Barcelona, go to the W and have a drink at the top of the hotel. Check ahead of time as to when the bar opens up therefore you can plan accordingly. 

If I were to return to Barcelona, I would probably seek out the W as my hotel to stay in, solely based on the view of the ocean and city you have from their location. The W is far out on the beach and not very walkable to any of the touristy areas I previously mentioned. The Le Meridien served it's purpose with respect to location.",4,2014,05,26
37,Friendly staffs with wonderful and centrally located in Barcelona!,It was my first time visit Barcelona.  I have always been treated very well being a Starwood Prefer Guest member but this time I was invited to their paella cooking experience by their relationship manager which was very special and thoughtful. Both me and my wife was very impressed by their friendly staffs and hospitality.  I have to say this is the first time I have experience such thoughtful arrangement.  We will certainly look froward to return to Barcelona and stay in Le Meridian hotel again! ,5,2014,05,25
37,Great Location.  Fantastic Concierge!!!,"We have travelled quite extensively of late and without doubt Bruno the concierge at Le Meridian has to be the shining star of our many hotel stays and is definitely the shining star of the hotel.    From arranging to retrieve my Drivers license from a tourist sight that I inadvertently forgot (along with returning the audioguides that came back to the hotel with us from the same location) to recommending excellent restaurants and day trips he is truly a gem.   I honestly can't thank him enough for going the extra mile and helping out with the DL issue.  (which would have taken 3 hours of my travel the next day to resolve had it not been for him)

The rooms are nicely appointed.  We faced Las Ramblas and the noise was non existent at night with the windows closed.   Housekeeping very good and the breakfast buffet while standard fare still welcomed to start the day.   

The bathrooms are fabulous (albeit the tub is a little hard to get in and out of if you are shorter...(I am 5'2 and had some trouble)    Gorgeous, just a little awkward.  :D

The location can't be beat.  Walking distance to so many sites and a quick subway ride to others.    Thanks for an excellent week in Barcelona!!!  Give Bruno a raise....seriously...  ",4,2014,05,23
37,If you like Las Rambla stay here,"We were here during May Day and the amount of people on  Las Rambla was incredible.  The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet.  The hotel staff was very helpful.  We enjoyed being able to walk outside the hotel and being right in the middle of the action.",4,2014,05,22
37,Deep in the Heart Barcelona,"If you want to be in the center of everything, then this hotel is for you, especially if the pocket book allows.  Our quoted rate of $274.50 E is expensive but I am sure that isn't the price our Tour paid.  Located right on the Las Ramblas, the main street separating ""old town"" and the least desirable area to vist at night, the hotel is about 3/4 of the way between the ""Columbus Momument"" and Placa del Catalunya.  This makes the hotel easy walking to the harbor to view the yachts, the Catedral de Barcelona for amazing religious study, the Arc del Triomf and its associated Park, and  Barceloneta where seafood meets the sea.  Tired of walking, take the metro to Sagrada Familla ... the on-going master piece of Architect Master Gaudi or out to the Musical Fountains of Montjoic.  Famillia is worth the visit to Barcelona on its own and the light show of the Musical Fountain at night is just topping on the cake. Both are less that a 10 minute ride away.  The Le Meridian is about a 5 minute walk to either the Liceau or Cataluna Metro stations on the L-3 Green Line which will take you to the Musical Fountain at the Espanya stop. From the Green Line you can catch the L-2 Purple Line out to Famillia or the L-4 Yellow Line down to the Barceloneta for sea food.  The T-10 ticket is the best value which gives you 10 entrances onto the metro.  Transfers within the first 1 1/2 hrs of first entry are free.  For a couple just use the ticket and pass it back to your spouce. Pick up a map of the city by GHB which shows all the metro stops as well as a map of the metro system.  Each entry to the metro has a map and remember to figure out the name of the end of the line in the direction you are going and follow the signs to that platform and you can't get lost.

Prices on the Las Rambla are quite a bit more than going a block to the ""old quarter"" but , hey, it's vacation time, isn't it.

The help at Le Meridian is great especially the Concierge .... they will mark up a map for you about any place you need to go.  Rooms were modern and those on the interior really quiet.  Front desk personnel were efficient and most helpful.  Took till mid afternoon to get room cleaned by if you are in town most of the day who cares ..... they need to get the turn-around rooms ready first.  No ice buckets in the room but a call to the front desk got a bucket big enough and full enough to chill champagne! The price of the room includes breakfeast which will keep you full to dinner but don't pass up the mid-day tapas or passerias for Spanish treats!

If money is not an object, this is the place to stay!",4,2014,05,21
37,Great family hotel,"Barcelona is always worthwhile a trip. This time we stayed at the Le Meridien and this will certainly be our first choice in the future. We were fortunate to stay in of the newly renovated suites overlooking the Barcelona skyline. Perfect for families as they are very spaceful and the decoration truly gives you a sense of place feeling. The location couldn't be better. You are in walking distance to all points of interests and restaurants. The breakfast at the hotel was amazing, which is not always the case in hotels in Barcelona. Very friendly staff! The lobby is set up like a lounge and invites you to relax after a long day walking through the city.",5,2014,05,21
37,Right on Las Ramblas,"Being on La Rambla is good for many reasons. You can walk a lot of places from there (beautiful Catalunya Square is just 2 blocks away). La Bouqueria market is three blocks the other direction, toward the port. You are never more than 5 minutes from a paella or 10 from a Flamenco performance. A main shopping street, Paseo de Grazia, starts at Catalonya Square and if you walk along for about a mile you'll pass two major Gaudi houses and just a little further will get you to the Sagrada Familia. Or you can take the metro to Sagrada...Park Guell... and many other wonderful places.  The Barcelona port, with its statues, impressive buildings, parks, museums and seafood restaurants is around a half mile away.  

But remember the Rambla goes late into the night and lately they're selling these little noise-makers you put in your mouth to make obnoxious sounds. Plus the garbage trucks come by early in the morning, as do a lot of delivery trucks. We were on the 2nd floor. I'd try to stay as high as possible.

Our room was really nice. Great bed. Great bathroom. All the desk people seemed to be young and beautiful...and VERY nice.

Loved the little health club/spa on the roof of the 6th floor. At the time we were there it was being staffed by an intern named Katie, from Portugal - she was so nice and personable and helpful. 

The breakfast buffet is very good. Lots to offer and nice eating area. Try for the window overlooking La Rambla.",4,2014,05,19
37,Great Hotel!,"We had the pleasure of staying at this property from 5/14-5-16 2014. I travel constantly and stay almost exclusively in Starwood properties. It is simply one of the best. From location to hotel staff you could not ask for more. It is centrally located and the property it self is well laid out and exceptionally well maintained. The staff was beyond compare. From check in to the instant response to any request the service stood out, especially the concierge. We especially enjoyed the sumptuous breakfast buffet. We strongly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,05,19
37,Best Place to Stay,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Le Meridian Barcelona and it was by far one of our best  hotel expereinces and we have stayed at over 100 SPG properties  - including several St. Regis properties. The staff were very attatentive and personable.  The location is excellent - within walking distance to most attractions which is why we chose this hotel over the W.
 
When we first checked in, Laura addressed a slight issue with our room. In the end, we had a great room (544) with a terrace, which had wonderful afternoon sunlight for sunbathing and siestas.  Sara and Gil, who worked the concierge desk on our first day, were great at helping us plan our stay. They booked and printed tickets and offered us very good restaurant recommendations and made reservations. We emailed several items to be printed by the concierge desk and Bruno always had the printouts ready for us by the time we got down to the lobby!
 
Ana and Walter invited us to participate in a lovely paella making experience with Chef Juan, which really made our stay feel personable and special. They also offered us a great day trip idea to visit Girona over the more common (and touristy) Mont Serrat. Girona was a charming town with an interesting Jewish quarter - well worth the 1 hour drive.
 
Overall the hotel experience was great!  The staff were friendly and very responsive. They take  very good care of their Platinum guests but we don't think you need to be Platinum to receive the high level of service. We would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2014,05,17
37,The best location in Barcelona,"Wow! We weren't planning on staying on this hotel but due to a corporate buyout on The Meridien Ra in Vendrell they transferred us here for two days, and upon arrival the concierge from El Vendrell called us to see if we were properly accommodated!(thanks Martin!)
We were impressed by the great location this hotel offers, you are right in La Rambla which is the Main Street on Barcelona. We ate at the restaurant and they gave us a window table which was the best, all the tourists walk right in front of you and at some point we decided to make funny faces to laugh with them too. They have the best hair dryer that I have had in any hotel we have been in. Me and my husband watched the football game of Atletico Madrid vs Chelsea in the lobby bar seating on the piano, and their food is amazing, try the steak strips!! They have good concierges with knowledge of restaurants and nightlife, consult them before going out to explore Barcelona. They also provide you with a great map of the places you must see! Thanks Le Meridien!!! :)",5,2014,05,15
37,It just cannot get better!,"I recently stayed at the hotel during Grand Prix and it was one of the best service i have received. The hotel staff are very attentive and friendly. The location is great on Las Ramblas walking distance from all the restuarants, bars, shopping.
The room is modern in style with all the comforts you desire. The best think was free Wi Fi in the hotel which for me was highly crucial. I really enjoyed my stay and will recommend to anyone who is going to Barcelona",5,2014,05,15
37,Bravo !Le Meridien Barcelona,"My husband & I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona recently on our wedding anniversary. 
We very impressed with the Hotel.
Location was superb, service was attentive but not overwhelming. The staff was friendly. Concierge knowledgeable. Will recommend to our friends & family most definitely.",5,2014,05,14
37,Faultless service Helpful staff Modern good value hotel,"The hotel is modern and situated VERY centrally on the corner of La Rambla close to Placa de Catalunya.
We stayed here for 6 nights on a break with friends in May. Service was friendly and efficient. The Concierges were very helpful. 
The room was very modern in style with all the comforts, with comfortable bed, good bathroom accessories and very efficient maid service. Not sure I liked the colour scheme which was a bit too brown for my tastes, but everything was clean, new and pristine.  Despite being on La Rambla we weren't disturbed by any noise, and the thick curtains meant we weren't woken by an early daybreak.  Just what you want for a holiday break.  
Prices are high but you get what you pay for.
Good Bar with helpful and good barman. Good breakfast in the restaurant with cereals, fruit, hot food croissants, pastries toast etc. but too pricy for my tastes and no continental light breakfast option, so we looked elsewhere.  There is a good Espresso bar serving pastries croissants etc off of the Foyer, so this was a good alternative for breakfast, and we went outside a few times too.
Only issue was that there was a lot of controls for the air-conditioning and I'm not sure we ever completely figured it out - there were no instructions.",4,2014,05,14
37,Handy Position,"Stayed three nights and found the hotel clean,the staff friendly, breakfast was good. The hotel is close to most places of interest. Just near La Ramla. Close to reasonably priced restaurants. Would stay there again.",4,2014,05,13
37,Would recommend.. lot better options around,We got put into Le Meriden after the W over booked. The hotel is nice and good for business. But lacks the style and quality of the other local hotels. And the rooftop is very poor. Find somewhere else,3,2014,05,10
37,Great stay in Barcelona,"Le Meridien is 1 of the BEST hotels we have stayed at in Europe.  I am assuming it is a 5 star hotel.
The location is central... right off of busy and noisy Las Ramblas, YET THE HOTEL IS QUIET and the rooms are quiet as well.  The hotel is great proximity to all the attractions and great restaurants. (I am referring to restaurants in a less tourist area- more high end, not the ones on Las Ramblas)
Our room was enormous, clean. amazing shower., extremely comfortable bed.  I am not sure if we were upgraded to a better room (bc we use SPG points) or of if all their rooms are like that- but it was really surprising.  most of the places I have stayed around Europe have small rooms. 
The staff was very friendly and professional.  The concierge was helpful BUT they need 2 concierge because we CONSTANTLY had to wait for a very long time to speak with the one who was working at the time.  It was actually a little frustrating.  But he was very good, so it kind of compensated.   We did not eat any meals at the hotel- so cannot comment on that.
Barcelona is one of our FAVORITE cities after this trip.  Highly recommend the visit and staying at this hotel.",5,2014,05,09
37,"Great location, Clean Rooms!","I was here! In September of 2012, we went on a girl's trip to BCN and stayed at Le Meridien for 4 days. 3 women in a small hotel room required some coordination since it was a small room. We stayed in room with a double beed and pull out single bed couch. Also, the door to the bathroom was opaque glass, so that was interesting too, but not horrible, I guess. The room and bathroom were very clean. Hallways and elevator didn't exactly match the gorgeous lobby, but hey, you can't get everything! Ultimately, the location was *everything*!!! It's was like staying in the heart of Time Square in NYC (no noise in our room at, up 5 or 7 floors, if I recall.)  The main entrance was on a side street so I didn't seem so overwhelming. (About 20-30 feet? from Las Ramblas). Not cheap, but the location and cleanliness was the benefit! We only at once at the hotel, but it was barely OK.",4,2014,05,07
37,Amazing location,"Excellent location, the best if you are visiting Barcelona as a tourist!! very good hotel, breakfast is great value and very friendly and helpful staff as well. Because is very busy you need to book well in advance",4,2014,05,03
37,"Location, Location, Location -- Unbeatable","We spent a delightful six nights at Le Meridien, Barcelona taking excursions and getting to know the city.  The staff was marvelous and helped to enhance our stay.  The Concierge, Ricardo, answered many to our questions via email and then booked the exact tours that we wanted.  Andre at the front desk was wonderfully helpful and he and Salvador saw to it that we had a great room for our week in Spain. When I had trouble printing in the Business Office, Victor was able to correct the problem very quickly and a young lady from Germany, Paula, who worked the night shift at the desk was always pleasant to speak with and a very cheerful person.
The location of the hotel allowed us to take breakfast at La Boqueria market, if we wished, and then board the Yellow Line Metro in La Rambla, and be off for a day of sight-seeing.  Ricardo recommended that we buy a T-10 ticket for both buses and the Metro and we strongly concur.  
Our room, 344, was very spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed.  The chocolates on the pillows each night was a nice treat and the well lit, granite bathroom was a delight. 
We will certainly stay there again.  You cannot beat the location and the service.",5,2014,04,29
37,Good Location,"If you are looking for a location this is the one for sure in Rambla Street ... room size is ok, the furniture is a bit old., Bathroom is really nice .. breakfast is really nice as well i think the high price is only for the location.",3,2014,04,27
37,Overpriced comparing to Paris,"We stayed there 5 nights here and the overall was slightly below average for what you pay for. Some comments below. 

Pro: Location was excellent.

Cons:
* the bed was so soft (no box at the bottom - just a mattress) we didn't sleep that well, not sure if this is a Spain thing 
* the front desk was polite but doesn't seem sincere 
* the restaurant advertise 10% off for SPG member so we charged it to our hotel    room but they didn't apply it off when we checked out - false advertising
* the rooms were not very clean - basics were done but still dusty & hair on the floor
* the hotel doesn't upgrade you automatically, you have to ask for it
* when you choose green, they don't even come to empty your trash can
* we had 4 green nights cards but they only credit us for 3 nights 
* extremely noisy when the staff starts cleaning around 8 am and slamming doors non-stop that you cannot sleep in

We stayed at Le Meridien in Paris and surprisingly found the hotel and staff above average so we expected the one in Spain to be better because it cost more than Paris. Was very disappointed.

For the price you pay, better off using another hotel or stay here for the location.",3,2014,04,27
37,"Rough start, happy ending","Stayed here for 3 nts w my hubby and 2 teenagers.  Had arranged for airport transfer in advance and had email confirmation.  Arrived at airport and no one was there.  3 calls later to hotel (transferred all around and eventually was hung up on) and the concierge sd ""Sorry, we can't come and get you. Just take a cab.""  Arrived at hotel and questioned concierge and got zero answers except ""Well, you are here now.""  I'm a longtime SPG member and had also requested that the kids' room be next to ours--not even connecting, just close by.  At check-in, front desk staff sd that they could not accommodate my request (made months in advance) to have our kids (age 13 & 15) on our floor--they literally were on an entirely different floor.  No attempt was made to remedy this for all 3 nts of our stay.  Rooms themselves were spacious and clean.  Bathrooms were enormous by European standards.  We had booked deluxe rooms that faced Las Ramblas--not the best decision as the street is LOUD at all hours of the night (think rowdy drunk people, police sirens, etc.).  Breakfast in hotel restaurant was fantastic and staff was super accommodating to my daughter's food allergies.  Ended up in hotel bar at the end of every evening for some delicious sangria--nice setting, not seedy.  Fantastic location overall despite noise.  Received great restaurant recommendations from concierge staff--literally loved every place they sent us.  At the end of our stay, we asked concierge to arrange ride back to the airport for us--upon hearing about our arrival debacle, he comped our ride back to the airport.  Everyone makes mistakes, it's how you handle them that's important--Bruno the concierge did exactly that by addressing the mistakes made upon our arrival.  Overall, great hotel.",4,2014,04,27
37,Great location and terrific staff,Stayed here for 5 nights and was very impressed with the location and the staff was fantastic. Everyone makes you very welcome and are responsive to your requests. The 'feel' there is very good. Rooms are very comfortable and the bathroom and  amenities were top notch. I would stay there again! ,5,2014,04,18
37,Good hotel!,"I stayed here 3 nights while on a business trip. 

Pros: Central location - on Ramblas where all the tourists hang out. Hence, you are close to many restaurants, shops and cool cafe bars. Right next to the hotel is grocery store (I know this is a big + for all those who practically live out of hotels and prefer to go in and get some fruits and vegetables). 
Staff are very friendly and helpful. They all speak English really well. As I was entering for the first time, a few concierges stood outside and offered to carry my luggage for me. Was upgraded to a suit which was very big and nice. half an hour after walking into my room, they brought me some chocolate and a small bottle of cologne. Bathroom was modern, very clean. There is a walk-in shower, and a bathtub next to it. The water pressure was very good! 
Bedroom was large, very good bed, with a nice work station. The  living room is designed in an oval shape, looking right at Ranblas Street. There were 3 TVs, one in bedroom, living room and bathroom. There were some English channel, not many ... but more than in some of the other hotels I've been in world-wide. Lots of music-only channels on there as well. 
Breakfast was your typical breakfast ... but maybe with a few more options. Restaurant staff were extremely nice! 

Cons: The iron board in the bedroom was very small. It is fixed to the wall, so it was very hard to work around it. I had a hard time ironing my shirt. Since the hotel is right on Ramblas Street ... it is always very busy there. I happened to be there one night while there were some demonstrations going on. off course, they took place on Ramblas and about 3000+ demonstrators could be heard very loudly from 9pm to 10pm. On the way out, there were no concierges to help me find a taxi ... but I found out that this was not an issue as there were many of them strolling around waiting for tourists to jump in. 

Overall: A medium size, coazy hotel. It was not a typical business hotel. It is definitely tailored towards tourists .... but I certainly did not mind this. I was impressed!",4,2014,04,17
37,Brilliant hotel!,"We've just stayed for 3 nights, and found the hotel amazing. It is centrally located in Rambla, near to bus stops, and tourist buses, and also not to far to walk to the sea, and the Born district.  Dressing gowns, slippers, toiletries all included, gorgeous shower and bathroom, and beds to die for.  Neither of us has slept that well in ages!  I would recommend it!",5,2014,04,15
37,A Gem in the heart of Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed here for a night. It was centrally located on world famous Rambla street.  It took only 20 minutes from the Airport. We took the bus and it dropped us off 5 blocks from the hotel.We had a wonderful time. The staff was professional and courteous. The breakfast buffet was incredible, it was great way to remember Barcelona. The room was comfortable and modern. The toiletries were nice and abundant. The bathroom was clean, modern, and spacious. I will definitely can't wait to return back to Le Meridien.",5,2014,04,14
37,Great Stay - Awesome location,"Stayed at this hotel for 7 days for our first time to Barcelona. You can take the Aerobus straight from the airport (40 mins) and then a short 5 minute walk. This is situated close to most tourist attractions so you are right in the middle of everything which is very convenient. There is a Carrefour supermarket next door to fill up on food and water although you can't use the minibar in the room for food storage. Quite a bit of shopping and restaurants around including fast options like Macdonalds or Burger King. If you are concerned about noise, get a higher floor room that does not face La Rambla. Service was friendly compared to other spg properties in Europe and all service requests were quickly taken care of. Internet was fast but took a few computer restarts to be able to connect. Would stay here again!",5,2014,04,13
37,I will be back.,"a lovely hotel conveniently located.  great service and food.  I had a large room with balcony, but no tub.  there are rooms with tubs, so make sure you specify when booking.  don't miss breakfast!  the only thing missing is a swimming pool.",5,2014,04,09
37,Centrally located and excellent service,"I spent a lovely 4 days in Barcelona and stayed at Le Meridien.  This hotel is definitely discrete, quiet and well maintained.  The room we stayed in was fabulous.  The bathroom was very nice and the bed was great.  The size of the room was also quite large.  The toiletries were also great.  

The breakfast buffet was excellent.  I loved everything they served.  The portion size was excellent.  The fruit and veggie were fresh and exotic (for those that are from the landlocked Midwestern States of US).  The location was so convenient for restaurants and sights.  Definitely a hotel I'd recommend for vacation.  Located right on La Rambla.  It was also about 2 blocks from the hop on/hop off bus.  

The conference rooms for this hotel are good.  The rooms are relatively quiet.  (Basement ones do hear the underground subway) No need for a projector because it integrates to a TV.  Would love to go back to this place.",5,2014,04,04
37,Great location but ....,"Being situated just off La Rambla, the hotel is ideally positioned for visiting the city. The rooms are fine too. However, the pretty loud rumble of the underground trains going past every few minutes and the street noise (the sound proofing isn't quite what the web site suggests) make this a no go for light sleepers or people who need their sleep.",3,2014,04,03
37,La rambla favorite,"Great hotel, had a great suite with a terrace with out door sofa, lounge chairs and a table. The hotel had cool art throughout and was definitely a Very quiet, modern and stylish hotel.   Close to great restaurants, stores and the markets.  Breakfast was great, very affordable for a Le meridien.  The concierge in the evening had great recommendations for restaurants, he was very familiar with the area.  This central location is a must, close to are the gaudi venues, Picasso museum and barri gotic. We enjoyed our stay and would consider staying again in the future. ",5,2014,03,31
37,"Nice hotel, fabulous location!","If you are looking for a hotel in the heart of Barcelona, Le Meridien fits the bill quite nicely.  Located in the middle of La Rambla, this hotel served as a prime location for sightseeing in the old city and is very close to public transportation to explore further sights of Barcelona.  

The hotel has a trendy look that emerges after you spend an eternity trying to get through the slow moving revolving doors.  Hotel check in was quick and easy, with the hotel staff providing a welcoming atmosphere to the hotel and Barcelona's charm.

I visited with a friend in March 2014 and we stayed in a room facing a side street. The room was moderate sized for Europe with two twin beds pushed almost side by side as is common in many European hotels for a double room.  We never figured out how to use the AC, but opted instead to open our window as there was a cool spring breeze at night.  The bathroom was modern in gray tones and there was a flat screen t.v. In the room as well as the bathroom.  There was some issues with paint cracking in the bathroom due to humidity and an unfortunate incident were tape pasted to the ceiling to fix the problem also came down and landed on me in the shower. However the dual shower heads, one hand held and one ceiling shower head were fantastic.  

We took advantage of the green option, which we assumed meant that our towels and bed linens would not be washed during our stay. No big deal since we were only staying three days. However, it turns out that our room wasn't serviced at all during the stay by housekeeping.   By the third day, our tiny trash cans were over flowing with trash and the room really needed some sweeping and minor housekeeping.  I'm not sure if the green option is supposed to operate this way, but that was our experience. Let's just say I'm less likely to choose the option on future stays.  

The beds were standard in comfort and the hotel offered us complimentary converter plugs, which were a nice and welcomed perk.  There was plenty of closet and drawer space for clothes and an electronic lock in the closet for valuables and passports.  The lights in the room were a bit difficult to get used to as the only option was to have them all on or all off.  It would have been nice to have the ability to control each separately, but that was a minor nuisance. Overall, the hotel was a great choice primarily due to its prime location.",4,2014,03,30
37,Excelente!,My and my wife stayed here for one night during our honeymoon. It was such a great hotel that we def regret it not staying longer. The location is ideal!!! The staff is amazing (specially Andres and Jordi) when above and beyond for us! Thank you!!!,4,2014,03,28
37,very nice hotel and staff,"stayed in the Le Meridien for the first time and was deeply impressed of the hotel. The situation is perfect and the atmosphere very nice . The team is attentive and helpful and very friendly all the time
I will definitley come back 

Best regards BK",5,2014,03,24
37,Great Food,"We had a meal in the restaurant. It was quite early in the evening, therefore quite quiet. Two members of staff were putting pictures up on the wall using high step ladders, which was strange when people were dining!
The set evening meal was wonderful value. A glass of wine, warm home made rolls and bottled water were all included in the price. Some of the supplements seemed odd, 2 Euros extra for carrot soup?!! The food was well presented and adequate. Although the dessert didn't quite match up to the description. We were assured that it was the correct order. It was such a rich chocolate dessert, so much so that all three of us didn't eat it. ",5,2014,03,23
37,Great location,This hotel is right off the Rambla and very easy to get to so many things. Rooms were fine but a bit small for a Meredien hotel. The staff was overall very good. A few disinterested folks at the front desk but the concierge and bartender both made up for it -- they were both exceptional.,4,2014,03,21
37,Wonderful Stay,Beautiful top notch hotel. Great decor and location. Staff was very helpful. Heated bathroom floor was lovely. Wish I would have used there concierges to book all my excursions. The only place I'll ever stay in Barcelona.,5,2014,03,20
37,Near-enough Perfect,"I really enjoyed my stay here; if, like me, you are only staying briefly, it is in a great location on Las Ramblas so right in the heart of the bustle of city life. I was surprised by the shambolic reception staff, I had pre-paid and expected for an invoice of this upon arrival and had to question this which was disappointing. Saying that, that was my only criticism. I loved the hotel bar:  you can look out on the people walking up and down Las Ramblas at any time of day or night whilst sipping a chilled glass of white wine. The rooms are really well furnished, the beds are comfy and shower or in my case showers  clean and easy to use.  You will get a great night's sleep here. And when you wake make sure you enjoy the hotel's breakfast-it really is amazing. The chef is really cheery as he conjures up a fried egg or Spanish omelette and you can choose from a wide variety of breads, Danish pastries, fruit salads and juices. I WIILL be returning-such a delight. The perfect hotel for a special city break.",5,2014,03,18
37,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Great location. Great and very helpful staff. Very professional. Service is excellent.
Hotel rooms, bathroom spic and span. Room size- no complaints. 
You also feel very secure ans safe in the hotel because the hotel security is always on alert. You will see him oberserving in the lobby.  In addition to the lobby security, there is also another gentlemen, in ordinary clothes, who doubles as hotel security.  
Language is no problem.  They all speak very good English.
Breakfast is excellent - you will love it because of the variety wether you are American or Asian or European.
There is  Carrefore grocery next door.  Boqueria market is 4 minutes away by foot.  Plaza Catalunya is 10 -mins by foot.  All shopping stores are a few minutes walk.  Gothic Quarters which you do by foot is very close to the hotel - BArcelona Cathedral is around 15 mins by foot but you will walk around beautiful sites and stores.",5,2014,03,14
37,Perfect hotel for a short weekend escape......,"We stayed at Le Meridien for 3 nights over a long weekend and were not disappointed.  For us the important things were a lovely bathroom to freshen up in, a comfortable large bed to get some well needed sleep in and a lovely quiet room so as to not be disturbed in the middle of the night.....all 3 of these were achieved as we deliberately wanted a non Las Ramblas facing room (we have already visited Barcelona about 10 years ago and knew it can get a little loud on occasion).  I in particular found our bed very very comfortable and the shower was perfect for a relaxed cleanse after walking (or sitting in the lovely sun) all day!

The hotel staff we found to be very welcoming and accomodating and would always greet you and be willing to help.  The only downside we found that the coffee in our room was not great, but you have the option to go downstairs and get an Illy coffee from the Cafe or alternatively being directly on the Ramblas you have hundreds of other places to grab one (as well as a Starbucks two doors down should you wish a takeout).

We would most certainly return to Le Meridien should we visit Barcelona again.",4,2014,03,14
37,Great hotel in perfect location,"We stayed at the Le Meridien Barcelona for 3 nights over a long weekend and had a terrific experience at the hotel. While our room had no view to speak of, and faced another building rather than Las Ramblas, this ensured that the room was very quiet and this was great. The room was an upgrade to the ""Junior Suite,"" which was nice - not exactly a US standard executive suite, but certainly a large and very nicely appointed guest room. Everything was clean and very comfortable. As this is a designer hotel, the coffee / beverage services were tucked away in a corner of the closet, which I thought was a bit strange, and we had to pull the kettle out and set it on the floor in the hall to make coffee, as there wasn't a place to set the kettle on a table - maybe in the bathroom was what they were thinking? Probably the hotel should just put a power cable in the closet. 

We had breakfast each morning which was good, if not exactly inspiring; the food though was perfectly fine and the service was friendly and efficient.

Perhaps one of the greatest aspects of this hotel is the amazing location of the property, right in the middle of everything on Las Ramblas - I can't think of a better place to stay for our first visit to Barcelona, and we were able to tour around and see many sights on foot as the location is just so convenient. If you're considering a sight-seeing tour to Barcelona, I would absolutely recommend this property.",4,2014,03,13
37,Loved it.,"Lets start on location, right on la Ramblas, but entrance off of street so felt safer then if entering from main drag.  Doormen also greeted you when coming and going.  We arrived early on check in day and I was worried they wouldn't have a room ready but the women whose name I can't remember now (started with a T) found a room so we could rest up and shower before exploring city. She asked the reason for our visit and when we told her we were here to see our son who was studying there, she even offered to make him a key.  We were on the second floor, room was not huge but spacious enough.  We did not have any view but I liked that the window opened to get some fresh air.  The beds were a little low to ground but comfortable.  I loved the bathroom, we did not have a tub but a double shower with rain forest head and hand spray.  TV in bathroom was nice touch but didn't use it.  Great powerful hair dryer in room!  With the exception of the business center to print boarding passes we did not use amenities, too much to see out of hotel.  Another nice touch was bottled water without charge in room.  Our room was clean and I love the bathrobes.  Only negative was not enough wardrobe space if staying for long period and more than one person.  Would highly recommend the hotel to anyone heading to Barcelona.",5,2014,03,10
37,Best stay anywhere!!,"What a great experience.  I traveled alone for the first time to a foreign country and have to admit I was a bit concerned.  When I arrived to the hotel the staff was so VERY nice and accommodating to all my questions and concerns about safety.  Montse Pujos and Monica Garcia went the extra ten miles to make certain I felt comfortable and safe at the Le Meridien Hotel.  All the staff from the housekeepers to the concierge were wonderful.  From correcting my errors in booking tours to addressing me by name, I felt like a ""honored"" guest here at the Le Meridien hotel.  I had a great and fun time here in Barcelona, they were the most important part by assuring and seeing to my comfort in so many ways.  Thank you from my heart to yours.",5,2014,03,08
37,Nice hotel could be so much better,"It is a good hotel well located but really it is too small to provide the level of service expected of such a hotel. On more than one occasion we gave arrived room was not ready and wasn't ready till after 4pm an hour after official check in.
Work to do here!",3,2014,03,07
37,Barcelona Center City,"One of the great SPG properties. Totally surprised at the design and size. Pleasantly surprised at the location right in the heart of the action in Barcelona, but yet on a side street without the noise. Great welcome at the reception and extremely helpful. With SPG Gold we received a nice room on the main street overlooking the activities. Clean and welcoming. Several special offers when you get to you room for free coffee and discount trip to the Contemporary Museum. 
Had the BEST time at the Longitude Bar with Anita who ran the bar area. She was the best and a keeper for any hotel. Had to come back each night just to see her smile and enjoy the talks with her. Anita made our trip.",5,2014,03,04
37,"Great service, good location, nice room","I stayed 5 nights during an extremely busy time. The hotel was well run, clean & comfortable & the staff were extremely professional and friendly. I managed to lose my phone in a taxi & the concierge even managed to track it down for me - no task was too much trouble. The room was well equipped & even though I was right over the front entrance it wasn't too noisy for the center of a busy city. The only negative was that the gym was very small and dimly lit. Although I get the feeling that guests would rather be outside running than stuck on a treadmill anyway. I would definitely go back for business or with my family",5,2014,03,02
37,Wonderful hotel choice for Barcelona!!!!,"This was my first trip to Barcelona and my first stay at a Le Meridian despite being an SPG gold member since 1999. I was very impressed with the hotel and their staff, especially the front office manager Walter Rijkers. I was recognized as a gold member and given an amazing room with a great view. The front office staff and concierge were all very helpful. The location proved to be ideal and I was very happy in my choice of this hotel. I would absolutely recommend this hotel and if my travels bring me back to Spain this is where I will be staying.",5,2014,03,01
37,"Perfect Location, Excellent Service, Beautiful Hotel!","Le Meridien could not be in a better place. Along La Rambla, the hotel is easy to get to from the airport or train station using the Metro (from the train station) or the Airport Bus.We walked all over Barcelona and never felt the need to get on the hop on/off bus or ride the metro, even though it is easy to do. We enjoyed buying bread and cheap wine/cheese at the Carre Four next door, as well as strolling along St. Joseph's Market. The staff at the Le Meridien were all so friendly and accomodating. Even though we arrived at 9 am, they had a room ready for us. The rooms are clean and nicely furnished (a low, but comfortable bed) and the big rain shower was so relaxing! We were also very surprised at how quiet it was at night despite the location and we even opened the windows to let some cool air in. We enjoyed sitting in the bar for a drink at the end of the day as well. There is also free low speed wi-fi in the rooms and we used the internet on our phones and never had a problem with connection. I would highly recommend this hotel and if I ever go back to Barcelona, I will absolutely stay there. Thanks for a fantastic stay!",5,2014,02,28
37,This hotel stays on my list of recommendations!,"I could have not been more pleased with my stay at the Meridian Barcelona.  Over the last few years I have stayed at this hotel several times and have had consistently excellent service.  The location gives great access to Los Rambles  yet at the same time serves as a quiet retreat when the action get to be too much.    All of my stays have been in the rooms in the front of the hotel with a round living room giving a great view of the street with large windows that open letting the sounds fill the space.  But don’t worry, with the windows closed its quiet and restful.  The room also has a nice big TV with the standard range of channels you would expect at any international hotel.  There is also a giant circular couch, desk and dining table for two, making the room extremely functional as well as comfortable for relaxing and having a drink at the end of a busy day.

The bedroom is tucked off to the side and was cool quiet and the curtains could block all the light.  It also comes off an interior hallway so no stray noise coming in from the common hallway.    The bathroom is across the hall,  has a really big shower several shower heads.   My only issue is the lighting was a bit of all or nothing-  so when trying to navigate at night  I was either in the dark or blinded by the light.   

This hotel stays on my list of recommendations!",5,2014,02,27
37,LOCATION-LOCATION AND SERVICE WITH A SMILE,"Looking for a Hotel in Barcelona with a terrific location, modern-spacious rooms and impeccable service? Well Stop Looking because its Right Here! The Staff was cordial and Friendly. The General Manager, Elisa Barral was accommodating and professional. Lastly, Bruno Parrinha, concierge, was extremely knowledgeable and so helpful in assisting us with tickets for special attractions, restuarant suggestions and more importantly sharing the ""inside tips"" you will not discover in any book of how to experience Barcelona. ",5,2014,02,23
37,People make the difference!,"On the surface the Le Meridien Barcelona was exactly what I expected - chic and upscale. I loved the lobby and the room was very nice and comfortable. The main thing that makes this hotel really stand out are the employees. Every time we entered, we were met with smiles and a warm reception. While waiting on the elevators, we were asked how are stay was going and if there was anything we needed help with as far as exploring the city. Everyone was very genuine and really cared that we had a nice stay. I was really sad to leave! Really and exception experience. 

The hotel is located right on the Rambla, which is great! The Rambla can get noisy at night, but it was not a problem in the room (you might want to request a high floor). There is PLENTY to see and do just outside the doors of the hotel! 

We used this hotel for 2 nights after a cruise. It is close to the ship terminal and a great location for pre and post cruises.",5,2014,02,20
37,Awesome trip,"This visit was enhanced by the customer service level of everyone at the hotel.  The hotel manager, Mr. Salvatore Battle, and his staff were extremely helpful when we landed and gave us suggestions of things to do around the city.  He was also able to upgrade us before we landed, which was a nice surprise.  

The concierge, Ricardo, was super helpful in giving us suggestions for restaurants as well as assisting us in booking tours, etc.  

Overall great trip and a huge thanks to the entire staff at the front desk and concierge desk.",5,2014,02,19
37,50/50 chance ... You willing to risk it?,"When you check in to a Le Meridien you expect good service and a great experience, why shouldn't you ... You are paying for it, otherwise you would go to a motel or a cheap hotel where even they get the basics right. Our experience at this hotel was not the best, they could not even get the basics right ... It was disappointing to see the Hotel GM sing the same incompetent tone as her employees, don't think she got the concept about being in the ""hospitality"" industry. As a platinum SPG member I was thoroughly disappointed. For those of you expecting the fine things at a hotel like this one, this hotel is a toss up ... Could be good BUT could be worse ... Are you willing to risk it? I would avoid this one ... I only took the time to write this so my fellow travelers know that this property is not risk free ... Happy holidays !!!",1,2014,02,17
37,Great service and location,"This is a very nice hotel right in the center of the action in Barcelona.  I stayed for two nights at the end of a long and exhausting business trip across Europe.  When I arrived I realized that I had left my iPad at the airport security in another city from where I had just departed.  The front desk staff at the hotel were extremely helpful, contacting the airport, tracking down my lost item and arranging shipment of it back to the US.  They even followed up with me a week later to check if it had been returned to me.

Th equality, value and location of the hotel was very good but it is the service I received which has made this hotel my go-to choice from now on when I am in Barcelona.",5,2014,02,17
37,nice hotel,"Stayed there in October 2013.  It was our first time in Barcelona and the hotel was well designed and staff was polite.  The rooms were nicely appointed, clean and spacious.  We were upgraded to a suite, so I'm not sure how spacious the standard rooms are.  The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was that it was right on the La Rambla which is crowded with tourists and not the most peaceful scene.  But, since this was our first time in Barcelona, it was good to have experienced it once. Next time I think we may want to stay in an area that is a bit less hectic.",4,2014,02,15
37,Hotel in Barcelona,"We booked this hotel because of the proximity to many sites within walking distance. The staff was very friendly, the concierge very helpful, and the buffet breakfast (included in our package) was adequate. Our rooms were spacious, the beds OK, and the shower was wonderful! We were just steps from Las Ramblas which allowed us to explore the Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas to the Sea, the many homes of Gaudi, and Sagrada Familia. The open market was just around the corner and we enjoyed the fresh fruits every day. Many restaurants were within easy walk distance too.",4,2014,02,13
37,Great hotel in a very convenient location,"Wetend to stay at Starwood properties and were not disappointed.  The hotel recovered nicely from a poor start.  It was january so we chose to stay on Las Ramblas rather than the beach (probably would have as it was more central, regardless of weather).

Initially our room was disppointing with scruffy tub.  We complained and were offered $150 upgrade; eh no.

Management stepped in and upgraded us to a lovely terrace room.  Nice recovery!

Concierge had some great recommendations for restaurants and getting to Camp Nou.

Restaurant and room service were also good.

Excellent stay",5,2014,02,11
37,Disappointing departure,"Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel. The location was fantastic, the rooms were fairly spacious (for Europe), clean and modern. Most all of the hotel staff was very helpful. The only disappointment that we had, was when we were checking out. We had been informed by our cab driver coming in to Barcelona from the airport, to schedule our own ride returning to the airport because 1 - hotels get a kick-back from calling ""their cab drivers"", and 2 - the cabs shouldn't charge for luggage. Upon check-out, we declined the offer to call a cab for us, because there was a line of cabs around the corner on Las Ramblas. The concierge insisted, and grabbed a cab from across the street. When we arrived to the airport, we had additional surcharges of about 15 EUR. I am aware that there is a 5 EUR fee to enter the airport, but he made up several excuses for the charges, including for our luggage, which we had been previously told that cabs do not bill for. At the end of the day, it was only 15 EUR, but disappointing that a Starwood hotel would condone behavior like that. This is the type of behavior that I would expect from a 2 star hotel in a small town.",4,2014,02,02
37,"Fantastic location, good service","We stayed at this hotel. Being SPG gold member, it was new experience to stay le meridien hotel. I usually prefer Westin, but this time I did not regret about my choice. Location of hotel is fantastic, it is located on La Ramblas road, which is walking street and always lots of people are there. 

Service was nice and helpful. Especially from desk managers. They solved almost all my mini problems and met my requests. Breakfast was good, but without changes, all four days absolutely the same things. 

Next time if I go to Barcelona again, I will for sure stay I this hotel.",4,2014,01,31
37,Pretty good and some nice ideas,"The obvious benefit of this hotel is its convenient central location. Whilst I can think of nothing to recommend La Rambla itself (the famous semi-pedestrianised avenue that runs past the hotel), the location is very useful for the marina and 'the heart' of the city.
The room was very good; excellent linen, bed, and high-spec bathroom. Room was nicely furnished and they offer free bottled water and free wifi (though the free option is slow). Only issue was the room was too warm, and I suspect the aircon was switched off centrally as it only blew out ambient air - no cooling at all. OK, it's January, but hotels always get hot inside.
Breakfast is quite good; you can get a fresh omelette plus cold meats and smoked salmon. As usual for southern Europe, the bacon and sausage were pretty poor, but there's plenty of other good stuff to choose from.
Pleasantly surprised by the bar tariff, especially given the location and the fact this is a smart hotel. Very sensible.
A really clever touch if you're staying more than one night: if you opt to NOT have your room cleaned and towels changed, you get a 5Euro voucher per day to spend in the bar or cafe. Since my bathroom had eight towels in it, and I'm happy to make my own bed, this made perfect sense - and the bottled water gets replaced anyway. Much appreciated.",4,2014,01,23
37,"Great Hotel, Great Property","This has been one of my favorite hotels so far, and my first time in a Le Meridien. The location of this property can't be beat for a tourist trip to Barcelona. Close to transportation, right on La Rambla. We were upgraded to a suite facing La Rambla which was always interesting to watch all the people and enjoy the views. For those who speak English, the employees of this hotel are beyond fluent. My only complaint was the bed wasn't overly comfortable.",5,2014,01,22
37,Upscale City Hotel,"My mother and I stayed here on the last leg of a long tour of Europe in June 2013.  This was my second time staying at the property, the first being in 2008 before renovations were completed.  The hotel, in Le Meridien style, is a tad modern and decorated in bold colors.  The lobby is nice and the staff was very helpful.  The hotel was very busy when we stayed.  

We were a little disappointed in our room.  It was updated and clean, but the room was very small (which is why I only gave four stars/Very Good).  Our room faced out to a street and we could hear a lot of street noise but we did not hear much noise from the hallway.  To me, this felt typical of a city hotel so I'm not sure if it is a case of expectations versus reality.  Having stayed at a number of Starwood properties throughout Europe, I still believe the room was disappointingly small.  However, we didn't spend a lot of time there due to the great location to the many sites we wanted to visit.  The area around the hotel - Las Rambles - has a great energy and is at the epicenter if you want to get out and see the city.  

We particularly appreciated the friendliness of the staff and how helpful the concierge was in helping us book a few things.  As another reviewer mentioned, the recommendations for restaurants felt typical. We did end up at a place where we had a LOVELY meal, we just had to pry a little bit. 

We also had excellent breakfast at the hotel each day.  As I recall, it was a bit pricey, but the convenience and the food made us feel as though it was worth it.  

If I had to stay again, I might look at other hotels in the same area to compare price versus size of room, but I would consider staying again because of the staff and how well the facilities have been kept.",4,2014,01,20
37,Definitely not Five Star,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in mid October prior to going on tour. Its location is the only thing going for it, situated on La Rambla. We had a room overlooking backyards and all we could see was roof tops. The room didn't have enough space to place suitcases. The lights in bathroom were so dim had so use bedroom mirror to see. We only had one bathrobe and asked for another, and slippers. An extra bathrobe was supplied, but no slippers - the excuse being we were not eligible for them in the room we occupied.  The breakfasts were the worst we have encountered in either 4 or 5 star establishments.  The worst five star hotel we have ever had the misfortune of staying in.",2,2014,01,12
37,Excellent Hotel in great location with really friendly service,"My wife and I spent a week in the hotel in February 2013 and really enjoyed our stay. The genuinely helpful nature of the staff was especially appreciated.
The most important thing about the hotel is the location. It is right on Las Ramblas, which seems to be the heart of Barcelona. There was always something going on around there, from the Opera at the fabulous Liceu only 5 minutes walk away, to the Gothic Quarter with all of the quaint streets steeping with history, to the Cathedral, and the general street theatre which is Las Ramblas. It also is located very close to two subway stations, so transport is not a problem.

There was a very nice touch that hotel made, in giving us a small potted plant when we arrived, it just had many buds, and as we stayed the plant flowered  beautifully. This humanised the stay.

I cannot say much about the food, because there is so many excellent restaurants within a stones throw of the hotel, that I would recommend trying them out, from breakfast at one of the great paternities or bakeries, to restaurants recommended by the concierge.

We had stayed in Barcelona before, but this experience was so much better, a combination of the service and the location.

Finally the room, we were very happy in the room, we stayed around the corner from the Las Ramblas side, as other reviewers had recommended this to avoid late night noise. The bed was comfortable and there was more than enough space.

We will be back!",5,2014,01,12
37,great christmas vacation,"Spent 5 days here over Christmas-used points to get 2 connecting rooms. Management said the hotel was fully booked but our entire floor was very quiet and seemed almost empty. We were on the 4th floor all the way in the back of the hotel with absolutely no noise. The room lighting takes a while to get used to but eventually can be figured out. Beds were on the soft side with a few flat pillows (must have) . Housekeeping was perfect. Check in and out was a breeze. There is a downstairs coffee bar which is excellent. We did not get complimentary breakfast but went to
Bar lobos across the street which is a great café- perfect for quick eating. There is a supermarket one block away on Las Ramblas which has everything you could possibly need and the in room minibar has room for your own beverages. The only somewhat negative experience we had was that the concierge kept referring us to mediocre restaurants on the main streets instead of some of the ""hidden gems"" on the side streets. if you do your homework a family of 4 can definitely have a 3 course meal with wine for under 100 euros. The hotel restaurant was very good but on the pricey side. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Good to know also that both casa battlo and guell palace (a few blocks away) are open on Christmas day.",5,2014,01,12
37,"Location, location, location...","The location is what makes this hotel. It's right on La Rambla, so you're in the heart of everything. It's classed as a 5 star hotel and you pay as if it's a 5 star, but in general it should be classed as a 4 star. The 5 star parts are the location, the bathroom and the concierge, Bruno. Everything else really is 4 star. Our shower was fantastic – large, multiple shower heads including from the sides. The room décor  is a bit bland and passing each other in the area near the bathroom is very tight. The window was small, so the room could be quite dark even during the day. The only English language tv channels were news. We were there for 5 nights, I was very surprised that they didn’t change the sheets at all. I’m sure if I asked for them to be changed they would have, but I was surprised that it wasn’t the normal course of events in a 5 star hotel. The pillow on my side the the bed was lumpy, so I asked for another one  and for more soap. This took over an hour and required a second call – again, not 5 star service. It took us 25 minutes to check in on arrival. There were 4 staff, but two seemed to be in training, so only 2 customers were being dealt with at a time. The same for the concierge – there was always a delay to see him. The one we dealt with most was Bruno and he was excellent. Helpful, nice, with great suggestions – everything you want from a concierge. We rented a car as we were planning a day trip to Andorra and Sitges, but I wouldn’t do so if I were staying here again. You really don’t need on in Barcelona, espeically if you stay on La Rambla, and the parking was very expensive (€35 per day). Most 5 star hotels would have an airport shuttle bus, but not this one. Breakfast is €25 per day, but there are many lovely, outdoor places within a few minutes walk for €5 - €10. We had a look at the spa – very small, not very special looking. One small thing – all the other 3 and 4 star hotels I’ve stayed in in Barcelona had free bottles of water in a fridge by the lifts – you could take 2 or 3 as you needed. At Le Meridian, there was one free bottle a day, then you were paying mini-bar rates for more.  All in all, a nice hotel, but not worth the 5 star premium price.",4,2014,01,11
37,Nice Hotel - on Las Ramblas (if you like that sort of thing),"The Meridien is perfectly located if you want to be in the middle of the tourist action of Las Ramblas.  But, within a few minutes walk, you can wander into the Gothic Quarter, or one of the many other wonderful areas of Barcelona.

The rooms were very nice and comfortable - larger than many others in Europe where I have stayed.  One issue is the night lights in the rooms.  They are on a motion detection system and ""click"" on and off each time you or your spouse gets up.  Then, the click on sometimes when you are still laying in bed.  It gets a bit annoying.

The coffee in the lobby is also quite good, as the coffee I tasted in many of the shops was a bit ""muddy.""  The hotel bar is a great place to unwind.  We enjoyed several different bottles of cava and they were quite reasonably priced.",4,2014,01,08
37,Great hotel in the perfect location,"Our annual trip for New Years was to Barcelona. We chose Le Merdien primarily because of it's location right in the heart of the city.  We were not disappointed. This is an excellent hotel with larger than average rooms (seating could use a little help both chairs we not comfortable) with a great bath & shower.  The bed was very comfortable but it was a bit too low (no box spring, platform only). Loved the motion sensor night lights! Hotel was very clean & staff was glad to help in any way they could.  We did not eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food. Our room was unbelievably quiet - especially since the hotel is located right on La Rambla.  We never heard any outside noise. WIFI is ridiculously expensive - ours was comp'd because of our SPG membership, but 19 euros per 24 hours is really high. 

We would absolutely stay here again.",5,2014,01,06
37,Just ok,"We stayed over the summer for two nights prior to boarding a cruise. As others have mentioned the location is the best part of this hotel. We are Starwood members and got our rooms for free. We also used extra points to get into our rooms early prior to the 4 pm checkin. The service was slow and I was a little concerned bc it was relatively warm in the main checkin area and hallways. When we got into the room they were nice, modern, and minimalistic. The bed was comfortably. the bathroom was somewhat stylish but I was concerned at how clean in it was- that the dark colored tile hid any dirt well. The bathtub was chipped in one place but repaired with the wrong color paint. The water pressure was really low and the tub was difficult to get into with the sides being very high. The ac was surprisingly good. I think overall the hotel was comfortable but for a Le Meridien I thought it was subpar. I have stayed in the Le Meridien in Aspen which is absolutely luxurious and gorgeous. Overall the stay was ok and sufficient in serving our needs.",3,2014,01,05
37,Awesome stay,"Stayed here for a week right after Christmas for a week and it was fantastic! First off the location is perfect if you'd rather walk to mostly everything than take a taxi. Initially thought about staying at the W which I heard was fabulous, but the location is very much out of the way from lots of things. Meaning you'd spend lots of money on taxi service and with the devalued American dollar that means you""ll be spending money like running water.

Check in was great and as a Platinum member Salvador treated us nicely although they had no suites available for an upgrade- ughhh.  The hotel Is very nice and the showers are magnificent.  Both rain and handheld.  

The small bar drinks were great too and the buffet breakfast was ok. None of the buffets in Europe are typical American style which is fine for me, but the kids didn't enjoy it too much. It's pricey if you opt to get it, but really just eat croissants and juice like we did. 

Didn't eat in the restaurant there (except for sangria and other drinks which were great) but the place across the street directly across from the rotating doors is excellent! Must try it and the one to the right of it as both were great.  There's a supermarket near the hotel if nobody tells you and you can get cooked food there as we'll for much less as an option.

If I come back to BCN this hotel is where I would stay again. no question. We had a wonderful stay and thank Salvador and his team for making it a wonderful experience.",5,2014,01,03
37,Mixed feelings,"We stayed at Le Meridien on the last night of 2013. I tried checking in around 11am but at that point they didn't have any rooms available yet. As an SPG platinum member, I asked for an upgrade to a suite, but I was told they didn't have any availability.
When I left, I checked the Starwood website and saw there was availability for a prestige suite. At that point I called my SPG concierge and asked if he could help me with securing the suite. A couple hours later, I received a phone call from the hotel saying my suite would be ready around 4PM. I definitely appreciated the efforts they made to accommodate my request.
Upon entering the suite, I immediately saw it didn't look like the prestige suite mentioned on their website, layout looked the same but the interior was quite dated. I guess this suite didn't receive an update yet. This didn't bother me too much, but when I checked out our the bathroom, I could clearly see that the bathtub was not properly cleaned. Not what you expect from a 5* hotel! I  called guest services and they sent someone up immediately to clean the bathroom properly. 
The rest of our stay went pretty smooth, we enjoyed their breakfast buffet a lot, and were also really happy with the treatment we received in their spa.

As a conclusion: 

Negative points: I'm happy I didn't have to pay the rack rate of the suite, definitely not worth the price if you end up in a non-renovated room. The unclean bathroom is NOT acceptable in this kind of hotel. 

Positive points: issues got rectified quickly and with apologies. Great breakfast, great location, great beds!",3,2014,01,01
37,Modern hotel in a great location!,"We only had the opportunity to stay at the Le Meridien for one night, unfortunately, but had a very good experience for the brief stay that we were there. The room is absolutely huge by European standards, with a very large bathroom and shower, a hallway, and separate bedroom. In addition, there is also a spa with a sauna and steam room that though small, is a nice free addition for hotel guests - especially when traveling with my steam room loving husband. The décor is modern, the room was clean, and the staff was extremely helpful. We had to have them assist us with numerous things during that one night (especially upon check out when our shuttle to the airport didn't show!) and they were not only accommodating but kind as well. The location is absolutely perfect, especially when you don't have a lot of time in Barcelona and really want to see the main drag. The only drawback that I noticed on our night there was that the breakfast was outrageously priced, which we unfortunately did not realize until we had already sat down to eat. Would definitely recommend to others though!",4,2013,12,31
37,Just excellent,Booked a city break through Voyage Prive at this hotel. I have to say the hotel is excellent in all respects. The staff are fantastic and attentive with great attention to detail. Clean spacious room (541) The only thing I could fault is that the shower screen frame is starting to corrode at the bottom and will need attention soon. The buffet breakfast was brilliant and served from 7 tip 11 giving you plenty of scope for a lien if you want one. Location is perfect for a first visit to Barcelona situated on La Rambla. No hesitation in recommending this hotel.,5,2013,12,30
37,Location Location Location,"If you didn't get it by now, the best thing about this hotel is the location -- right on La Rambla.  While that can be a negative for many, given that the strip is tourist central, it is central to getting around Barcelona whether on foot or by metro (Placa Catalunya is 2 minutes away).  

The staff is great and very friendly and helpful. Carolynd Claros was the supervisor when I checked and was very welcoming and accommodating.  She also surprised me by arranging a bottle of champagne in my room on my birthday which happened to be during my stay. While the rooms could use some updating (carpets are kind of sticky and the furniture is a little outdated), the stay overall was very good.",4,2013,12,27
37,One of my favourite hotels,"I stayed at the hotel 3 times now (maybe four??) and always loved it. Granted as a SPG Platinum I always received an upgrade.
The new rooms (February 2013) are some of my favourite ones ever. We stayed in a Suite which was actually just one room with a big terrace. We loved the feel of it and the bathroom is one of the nicest ones I have ever been in. Modern but still lots of local touch.
The breakfast was good and the service very friendly. 
The location is maybe one of the best in the city.
Overall I highly recommend this hotel",5,2013,12,26
37,Fantastic location in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed here 3 nights in the first week of July. The location is perfect. This was our first time in Barcelona. All we needed to do was to step out of the hotel and be in the center of action.  We had a suite overlooking La Rambla so you could easily hear the strreet noises at night. The breakfast was excellent. The only reason that I am giving this a 4 star is because of our room. Although it was a beautifully renovated modern suite, the smell of cigarette smoke bothered me the minute I walked into the room. It was obvious that the cleaning people had sprayed the room to hide the smell. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our stay and you can't beat the location.",4,2013,12,22
37,Great position for seeing barcelona,"Just had 3 night stay. Mailed the hotel beforehand to request higher floor quiet room. Hotel acknowledged my request and then provided what I had asked for. Perfectly decent hotel. We spent very little time in the room but it was fine. Housekeeping was efficient and thorough. We ate breakfast directly across across the road from the hotel entrance - left or right, two very nice venues either for an evening meal or breakfast.

Good time of year to visit Barcelona, fairly quiet and nice weather. All in all a nice hotel and good value. Incidentally, any concerns about security bearing in mind the unfortunate experience of a previous poster who had his/her room burgled, I did note that the hotel now has a security presence in the hotel lobby. My advice is that you need to be very careful to keep your wallet/purse safe when moving around the city - pickpocketing is without doubt an issue that the city is becoming infamous for, but we felt very safe in this hotel and I am happy to recommend it to friends",4,2013,12,21
37,Some positives but ultimately disappointing,"We spent four nights in Le Meridien (Decmber 14 - 18, 2013) and in the end, we were left somewhat disappointed.  We stayed in this property, ideally located on La Ramblas, in 2004, which was before it was a Starwood property.  We remember it as a grand hotel in the finest sense of European hostelry.  This time that was not our experience.

The registration process was not prompt.  We are not preferred members of the loyalty program but there was a line there and we were in line behind one couple in the general line.  That couple had a hundred questions and while the people in the cubicles behind the registration desks could see the registration process was backing up they took no action until the couple in front of us were completed.  We were given the choice of upgrading our reservation to a suite, at the price of nearly 80% addition to our already reserved rooms.  That offer was rejected.  We were given a choice of a quiet room, which was greatly appreciated.  the room was small, almost smaller than the river cruise ship state room we had just left  that morning in Nuremberg, Germany.  The bathroom was fabulous but the rest of the room was dark, even with all lights on, and dreary.  The carpet had some noticeable spots and there was considerable mildew evident on the grout between the sink and adjoining wall.  The room was stuffy and temperature control was inadequate.

One day during our stay we left the room at 7:30 AM, no privacy sign on the door.  We returned at 3:45 PM only to discover our room had not been made up.  A call to the front desk corrected that situation in about 35 minutes.  I simply do not understand how our room could not have been ready.  When this happens, I blame management not housekeeping.  It means either too few staff or inadequate supervision, a management issue in either case.

I specifically choose a room rate that did not include the breakfast buffet; knowing we could have it at a daily rate that was comparable to the the additional room rate if I had included it in my reservation.  The buffet was meager, especially at the cost of 25 plus euros per person.  I had to ask wait staff to find the hot station chef to place an egg order.  The fresh fruit offering was minimal, remarkable given the Boqueria St Josep is just down the block.  There were no melons, just strawberries, pineapple and pomegranates drupes.  The charcuterie was equally meager.  My recollection was in our prior stay this buffet was superior; this time is was just a bad value for the money.  The hotel management should travel to the Westin Palace in Madrid to see what 25 euros can buy in the way of a breakfast buffet.

So the positives: location, staff is very friendly, helpful, and accommodating (when engaged), and a great bathroom.  The negatives are dark, dreary, small rooms; inconsistent service; and a price point for just about everything that does not deliver the expected value.  I had recommended this hotel in past but will no longer do so.",3,2013,12,20
37,Excellent Location and Very Good Service,"It has an excellent location in La Rambla with great service and restaurant. You can get to many shops, coffee shops, Carefour and metro which is steps away from the hotel.
Starbucks is on the corner of the hotel which a nice place to set and have a cup of coffee.",4,2013,12,17
37,Best view in town,"great location being directly in la rambla, great service and great food in the restaurant. The views of the suite are the best in town, covering all the gothic area and the majors momuments of the city.",5,2013,12,16
37,"Location, location, location","Excellent location on Las Ramblas an easy walk to major sites. We spent one night here before a cruise. Upgraded room was ready after arriving on early flight allowing us to take a nap and shower befores getting out to explore. This was much appreciated!!
Also had an excellent dinner in the restaurant and wonderful breakfast the next morning! Luckily ,the bedroom in our suite was not facing the  Ramblas. It's quite busy and the scene goes on well into the night! If noise bothers, ask for back room. Staff we meet was courteous and friendly.  Brief but lovely stay.",5,2013,12,15
37,Great Starwood property right on La Rambla,"Fantastic hotel right in the middle of everything - literally right on La Rambla which is where a lot of the action is in Barcelona. I used my Starwood points to book this hotel for a vacation with my girlfriend and there were absolutely no regrets. The staff there was great - all the way down to a trainee, named Daniel, who was super attentive. We got upgraded to one of the suites that looked over La Rambla so no complaints there! The rooms are very clean and modern - really feels like you are being pampered. The breakfast at Le Meridien was also amazing. It is buffet style but they have a wide assortment of local cuisine - cheeses, meats, and all you can drink mimosas! I can't speak to the price as, again, I used my Starwood points but I highly recommend this hotel to any Starwood travelers. Great value for the points.",5,2013,12,10
37,WHERE WAS THE GENERAL MANAGER ?,"I have had the pleasure of staying here many times and this weekend was upgraded to one of the newly refurbished suites overlooking the Ramblas.

Following my stay i had a meeting with management to exchange views.

Attention to detail leaves much to be desired !

How could the GM sign off on my suite bearing in mind there are so many issues or was the GM not involved.

The suite colours were morbid-totally depressing--a lack of electrical power points in the correct areas-for the person sleeping on the right side of the bed -no switch to put on a light-so the guest has to crawl over their partner or get out of bed and walk about the bed.

In the area of Internet desk no plugin available unless you disconnect the radio.

Water in the shower is being wasted based on the enormous pressure--money money !!

Very expensive electrical lights have been installed in the both bedroom/living area which simply are a waste of money-they are SPOT LIGHTS-as a result you are unable to read a book-newspaper in the living area with the awful lighting system.

Why oh why do some GMs sign off something like this without clearly seeing the issues by day and NIGHT.

Breakfast was standard however dinner was wonderful with a most delightful young German lady being charming and efficient.",3,2013,12,09
37,Starwood property in great location and it is NOT noisy.,"After all of the hype about noise on La Rambla, we initially paid 50 Euros extra to get what we thought was a sound-proofed room.  When we got to the hotel, they told us that in fact the website was wrong and ALL the rooms were soundproofed, so don't pay the extra money for the La Rambla view, as that will be the noisier room.  Also be advised that there are dead spots for internet service in some parts of the hotel.  Although the web site says you will have to pay for internet, WIFI is in fact FREE if you get service in your room.  The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly and offered to change rooms to get us WIFi, but by that time we did not want to move again.  We got breakfast included and were glad we did.  The selection was pretty good, although not as grand as Starwood properties in Italy.  They never could seem to get the coffee uniformly hot, but kept trying.  If you ask for Americano coffee, you will get the equivalent of bad instant coffee, so just get their regular strong coffee and get warm milk.  Great fruit selection at breakfast, including pomegranate seeds, berries, kiwis, and fresh figs.  Rooms are very nice and modern, some with great soaking tubs, convenience of great and quick tea pot in closet.",4,2013,12,08
37,Wonderful stay,"We just got back from a 3 night stay at the Le Meridien in Barcelona.  Everything about it was great.  The service throughout our stay was exceptional.  The check in process was very easy and pleasant. The doorman, and especially the concierge were at our service, and extremely helpful.  The rooms were spacious and clean, an the location of the hotel is ideal. We would certainly stay there again.",5,2013,12,08
37,Great pre-cruise night,"We stayed here for one night before embarking on Liberty of the Seas.  Our United flight from Newark arrived at the Barcelona airport at 9 am.  We took our prearranged ride through Costco but if I were to do it again I would taken a taxi. Le Meridien sold an early arrival package for 120 euros.  They were very nice and definitely used to cruise passengers.  Expensive but it was worth it.  We checked in, showered, and went to bed.  We didn't even eat the included breakfast buffet.  Then we woke at 130p to catch a private 4 hour tour of Barcelona, again very worthwhile. The location is perfect, on Las Ramblas, which is the fantastic pedestrian street with food and shops galore. I did not eat in the hotel.    It is also a 15 minute walk to the Gothic Quarter and cathedral.  It was about a 25 minute walk to the University metro stop which you can take to La Sagrada familia.  The hotel is a standard four to five star luxury hotel.  If I come back to Barcelona I will stay here.",5,2013,12,07
37,My favourite hotel in Barcelona,"I was lucky enough to stay at L'Meridien many years ago whilst on a business trip to Barcelona. Since then, I have recomended it to all my family and friends and I always go back there. Great staff and a great location. I love all the new modern designs ( I can still remember all the classic furnishings from yester-year !) I stayed in the Mediterraen suite recently which was spectacular and enjoyed having the new spa facilities just a couple of doors down from me. Very relaxing with amazing views of the city. Well worth a visit.",5,2013,12,04
37,"Ok hotel, excellent restaurant","Great location, not overly impressed with rooms, we were on 4th floor and the room was fairly small. Good shower, although the bathroom cleaning could be better. Heating system not great, had to call to have heating on. Particularly unhappy with the offer to pay for late checkout option at €50 for two hours (normally that is price for each hour, and we got additional hour offered free). I guess good deal from that perspective, but i have never had this offered before-late check-out was either possible or not. The hotel also seems to be vey punctual with check-ins, almost impossible to check-in before 3pm, we had the same experience. They were working something on our last day, it was very noisy from early morning and my husband heard similar sounds throughout the night! 
Breakfast buffet choices ok, nothing to brag about, definitely not 5-star hotel buffet. Restaurant meals, however were gret.",3,2013,12,03
37,Place to stay in Barcelona,Another great stay @ a place where every thing that counts in Barcelona is at walking distance. Excellent rooms (book a Mediterranean suite..) and an excellent restaurant with more than reasonable prices for good quality food.,5,2013,12,02
37,Great experience at Le Meridien Barcelona,"I only stayed one night at Le Meridien but I am sure I will be back. Location, customer service and hotel facilities are just a few good reasons to strongly recommend this hotel, not only for business travellers but also for visiting Barcelona

Really good value.",5,2013,12,02
37,Good value for what you pay,"I expected more from this hotel but when I think about what the price is, I believe it's a good value for money. There can be a long queu at the reception sometimes, I had to wait more then 30 minutes' to check in. Afterwards they brought fruit to my room with their apologies.

The double delux room has a good seize with a nice bathroom. I was on the 4th Floor but 2 nights from the 4, I woke up from the noise outside at night/early morning. 
I left my USB charger on the table next to my laptop but my charger was gone and nowhere to be found. It was only a charger so I didn't make a big deal of it but still... 
There are only a few rooms with a balcony.

The breakfast could be better with more choice and variation but it is ok, you will not starve.

I had 3 times lunch in their restaurant and that was good, much better than their breakfast!

The concierge will help you with all your bookings but when I ordered a big bus for our group, the bus didn't show up at the hotel but at the square which is a few 100 meters away. Not a problem but we were informed 15 minutes' after our departure time. So we started our trip with a delay...

Overall it's a good hotel with a perfect location but there are so many hotels around that next time, I will try another one.",4,2013,11,29
37,2nd time & still good----But!!,"My friend & I revisited this hotel because we were cruising out of Barcelona on the celebrity equinox. Our 1 night stay was great. The hotel even arranged for tickets to Segrada Familar the same day we arrived.  I love this hotel, the location is perfect and it's 5 star. Barcelona is an interesting city, but lots of pick pockets- just like other cities it has crime. We made a point of using the in room safe. I just read another review, that a guest used the room safe and found that it was broken into as they were out of the room for dinner.  The hotel claims they are not responsible!
I always felt safe here. Lots of doormen . But now I'm having 2nd thoughts about security. In order to get in the elevator and go up to the floors you need a room card inserted. Be careful who you get into an elevator with. The hotel will only be responsible for valuables left in their lobby safe",4,2013,11,28
37,All's well that ends well,"We arrived at around 8:30am after an overnight flight from Singapore.  Who would have thought this hotel would be completely booked the prior evening; no rooms were available.  After this frustrating start to our long weekend in Barcelona, the hotel worked out just fine.  I was redeeming Starwood points for 4 of the 5 nights, and could have chosen the W hotel at the seafront.  This hotel was so much the better choice due to its location.  The room itself was modern, clean and relatively spacious.  I wouldn't say the hotel staff was overwhelmingly friendly, but they were courteous and prompt, which is about all one could ask for these days.  It's not for the budget conscious traveler, but I would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,11,27
37,Amazing But Expensive,This Hotel was amazing great value amazing room service and restaurant.  It even had a Pool that was 40 m long. But at the same time all of it was really expensive. The Only thing that let me down was first the pick pockets around this area and the price of the breakfast and the Dinner. For one person to go in it cost roughly 25 pounds so maybe go to the restaurants near by that are hotel that are cheaper. Over all this hotel was in the top 5 best hotels I have ever stayed in.,5,2013,11,26
37,First night our room got broken into - all valuables stolen!,"We chose the hotel because of its location, right on the famous La Rambla and close to the metro so easy access to tourist sites. It is a very busy hotel with people constantly coming in and out! After shopping when we returned to the hotel, we got in the elevator and two guys ran in the elevator...we asked those two guys what floor they are in, they said same as us. We got out the elevator and we had a strange feeling that we were being followed...... it was the first time that we felt being followed so we didn't know what to do. We were also worried that we'll get rob in the hallway especially both of our cameras are with us so we decided to walk faster. We final got into our room and quickly locked it! The two guys passed us so we thought they were hotel guests and their room was down the corridor! It was a relief the moment we got into our room thinking we are safe, what we didn’t realize is that our worst nightmare just begin……

We stayed inside our room for an hour rest before heading out for dinner. We took out just enough cash with us for dinner and leave the rest inside the hotel room safe. We also put our expensive camera lens, flash, and gears in the hotel room safe naively thinking it’s safer in a 5 stars hotel than carry with us at night. One of our two DSLR cameras was also left in the hotel room since we thought we didn’t need two cameras for dinner. We double checked that our room’s door is completely locked since we have all our valuables inside! When we got back to our hotel room after dinner, my husband inserted the key to unlock and we entered.  As soon as I walked into the bed area, I saw the room safe was broke opened and left on the floor. EVERYTHING IS GONE except our two passports and our house keys!!!! My camera, all the lens, and cash were gone! Later two police officers arrived, did primarily observation and said they’ll be back tomorrow for more investigation.

The next day, the front desk manager greeted us and offered to walk us to the police station to help us with translation. We really appreciated his help and he said the hotel will also investigate this and will take around a month before an answer. The hotel reviewed the surveillance cameras on the outside entrance and the lobby and saw the two guys went into the elevator with us, they were confirmed as suspects. We were surprised that they don’t have surveillance cameras in the guest room hallways, if they have installed surveillance cameras in the hallways, they would’ve find out how the thieves got into our room. The manager said it is not a requirement to set cameras in the guest room hallways and this is also to protect the guests’ privacy.  In my opinion, if criminals out there are able to access my room without my permission, how is my privacy being protected? The police couldn’t recover their fingerprints on the room safe so they are very professional and came prepared and got into our room without any physical damage to the door!!! It was that scary!!!

The rest of our trip, we couldn’t enjoy it as much as we could due to this incident! I lost my appetite and avoid going out at night but staying in the room keep reminding me of what happened, it was my worst nightmare! One week later after this horrible event, we got home  and patiently waited for an answer! One month passed, we still haven’t heard back from the hotel, no email of keeping us updated, nothing until I posted a review of the hotel on Trip Advisor. The manager called us the next day and asked me to remove my review because it’s still under investigation and it’s hurting their business. I told him my intention of the review is not to say bad about the hotel but to inform other fellow travelers of what happened to us so they can learn from us and hoping to prevent this from happening to another victim! I agreed to remove the review until the investigating is completed.

After months of frustration talking back and forth with the hotel, the conclusion was that there was no evidence of a break in through the bedroom door so the hotel was not at fault and thus they are not liable for our losses. We were outraged by this! The guestroom door was the only entrance to the room with completely sealed windows and we confirmed the door was locked before we left our room. We totally disagreed on the conclusion that there is no evidence the hotel was at fault. The incident had happened inside the hotel room where the door and safe were locked and the thieves were able to access into our room without our permission, isn't that the hotel's security system, guestroom door, and safe failed to protect the guest's safety and properties in this case? Then the hotel offered us a so-call goodwill gift (around 25% of our loss) but in order to get that we must sign a letter of acceptance with the condition that we will not pursue against the hotel. That is not a goodwill gift but a settlement! We can not sign it because we had no choice but to claim against our homeowner’s insurance and it required us to transfer our rights to the insurance company. We explained that to the hotel and the hotel said they are no longer able to offer the goodwill gift. We felt that the hotel is being dishonest about this whole goodwill gift and tried to mislead us into signing a settlement agreement! 

Big costly lesson learned: if you do have valuables that you can't lost, ask the hotel if they can keep your items in their safe. It's inconvenient but that's the only safe place in the hotel. The hotel (not sure about others but definitely Le Meridien Barcelona) will not take any responsibility of any loss occurred in the guestrooms! We were very unfortunate so I want to share this with you and hope it'll help you to avoid becoming the next victim!",1,2013,11,25
37,"Comfortable, very well located","The hotel is very central, a few meters from MACBA, the Museum of Contemporary Art and in the neighborhood  there very nice restaurant and little shops. The hotel itself is comfortable and the personnel efficient and kind. The bedroom is comfortable and quiet, although the location right on the Ramblas.",4,2013,11,23
37,An oasis in the center of the action,"The hotel entrance is on a quiet side street but the building fronts to La Ramblas and the many stores and restaurants.  The foyer is great to meet friends with plenty of chairs and a coffee bar.  We are platinum members and an upgrade to a suite was not avalable but found the king room fantastic!  Bed was comfortable, bathroom oversized with a rain forest shower that was hot and forceful & plenty of towels.  Large double door closet and good use of lighting.  Wonderful use of wood on the floors. Our first time staying but not our last",5,2013,11,21
37,Excellent location,"Staff are very friendly and accommodating!
Hotel is well situated middle of shopping hub, which was perfect for me!
Rahual and his team in the restaurant gave us excellent service! Will definitely come back!
",5,2013,11,19
37,Great location and views of Las Ramblas,"I have stayed here 3-4 times a year over the last 25 years. It is very reliable in terms of service and rooms; however, only if you get the junior suite or above, otherwise even the SPG rooms are only average, nice but average. I usually get a corner suite, rooms ending in 14. They have a circular living room and separate sleeping room. The bath room is quite large with a separate shower and tub all done in stone tile work. The market, La Boqueria, is just around the corner through some back streets, and the neighborhoods off the Ramblas are quite nice for exploring. There is also a self-service laundry one block over from the hotel, very convenient",4,2013,11,18
37,Stop to have desserts with friends,"We stopped at Le Meridien to have dessert and a coffee in their restaurant.
Excellent place to be with friends. The place is very classy and their service is professionnal.
We had 4 desserts, coffees and a few drinks. We enjoy the atmosphere",4,2013,11,15
37,Nightmare!!,"We visited Barcelona in Early November this year when I went for a business trip and stayed in W durin g for the weekand when my husband and son joined me over the weekend, we moved over to Le Meridien. My logic was W is by by beach and Le Meridien in the center and after reading the trip advisor reviews, I was convinced I have made the right choice and it would be ideal for the family to stay in Le Meridien as it's in city center. How wrong I was.
To begin with, there is no comparison between W and Le Meridien. W is modern, has nice rooms, with every comfort whereas Le Meridien is the opposite. It has a small entrance on a side road to the La Ramblas and it really looks old and dark. Rooms are seriously dark too with very basic furniture. There is a lot which can be improved upon. We were on SPG floor but it seemed to me there was nothing special about this floor. I didn't look forward to coming back to my rooms after a long day walking around in Barcelona. But this is the usual stuff. You can perhaps live with it BUT we had an interesting and really disappointing experience.
Our roof started leaking at 4:30 am on Sunday morning!! It was not only leaking in drops but it was a waterfall....it was leeking at the entrance of the room and in the bathroom, drenched my luggage and made a flood on the foor and guess what - the response was absolutely un imaginable. The front desk was inadequately staffed at that hour and so when I rang them at that hour, I was told someone will come and help us out. I thought they will immediately move us out BUT I was wrong. It took them 20 mins to send someone with 10 towels to contain the mess on the floor accompanied with apologies and that was it. The ROOF KEPT ON LEAKING. I then rang the front desk again but there was no answer. I tried few times and then I gave up and walked over to the reception. There was one person there who was frantically talking on the phone presumably to do the crisis management. I finally managed to speak to him after he was on phone for good 5-7 mins and he was not very polite. He basically told me very crudely that he has to contain the leak first and then he can think about us. Well very interesting indeed but hey did I have the choice? I just requested for another room key and said we need to move and he gave me a new room key while he was still talking to someone on the phone.
Great. I thought now I can sleep in the new room....but NO. When I went back to my room, electricity was gone and so I could not have possibly moved to the new room. I went back again and asked for a torch. What I got was a tiny torch and that was the only one they had in the entire hotel. Anyways my husband and I managed to do our packing (imgaine how we did it in the middle of the waterfall and trying to look for unpacked stuff when it was pitch dark with a tiny torch) and when we were leaving, someone came over and helped us out to move to the new room.
When it was late morning, we woke up and hoped someone would have slipped a letter through the door apologising or saying something polite but no there was nothing. I called up the reception and requested a late checkout because I had a disturbed night. The person on the front desk had absolutely no idea of what I was talking  about but without saying anything he gave me time until 2 pm to check out. 
Anyways we checked out at 1 pm and I very politely complained at the check out but the front desk person said it affected other rooms as well. Honestly I am shocked!! I actually asked that person if it was a 5 star property because it definitely didn't give me that kind of feel.

Well that was it and I wonder now in hindsight why did they charge me for that eventful night. But anyways this is my candid review. Hope these guys learn a little bit more about hospitality for future for other guests as I am not going to another Le Meridien again. Thank you very much!

Oh yes, BTW location is not too bad if you can live with a waterfall in the room. :-)",1,2013,11,15
37,outstanding stay at the meridien...amazing service,"Spent 3 days in Barcelona for a business trip and although the meeting was at the international convention center, i decided to stay at the Meridien to enjoy the energy and bustle of the city in the evenings. From the moment i walked into the hotel all the staff really made me feel welcome and it was certainly not because i am a platinum member as only the front desk staff knew about it. The service at the restaurant was amazing, the concierge desk were always enthusiastic with their recommendations for dining out and helping with the booking, the lady at the small coffee shop was welcoming and just treated my like my mother. And i got upgraded to the most beautiful room! I travel a lot for work so have become rather critical about hotels however the service at this hotel was simply outstanding and by all the staff. Would like to congratulate the Hotel Management and all the staff for the level of customer service and i will be back very soon and this time with all my family!",5,2013,11,15
37,Great location,This is my thrid stay and still believe it is the best location is just in la Rambla district near the shopping area near the port everything at a walking distance. The hotel service is excellent and the restaurant is quite good. But you are near many others too.,5,2013,11,11
37,Good location and service!!!!,"We stayed at the hotel the first days of November! Upon arrival Lazaro assisted us with the check in and made us feel very welcome. Even though the room was not ready as we arrived early, he promptly took our luggage and placed them in the luggage room so that we are free to go. The hotel is located very close to Catalunya plaza which is one of the most central points in Barcelona and therefore it was easy to go all around.

The room was quite spacious for two and the service in all f&b premises very attentive. The concierge(Christian) as well gave us good recommendations for places to visit and helped us with tickets bookings.

Overall a nice stay and good location and service. I would recommend this  hotel!!!
",4,2013,11,08
37,visiting on points,"Stayed here for 5 nights on our first trip to Barcelona. The central location of the hotel is truly a big plus. The aerobus from the airport drops you off at Catalunya square and it's a short walk from there to the hotel. The metro is right outside the hotel, which should get you to most places fairly easily. Eating breakfast at la boqueria every morning was definitely a perk of the location as well. The hotel is also a short walk to the gothic quarter and el born.

The hotel itself is very clean and modern. The staff was friendly and accommodating. It was definitely nice to stay on points as rooms were $400 a night. They also offer points for skipping turndown service so I actually got back 2000 points on my stay.

The room was a little small but for just two people it's fine...it's not like we need space to practice our dance routines. The bathroom was nice with a large rain shower head and shower wand. Most importantly the bed was nice and comfortable. The internet in the room was good (be sure to have at least gold status or they charge you 20 euros a day)

Only problem we had there was that the hotel experienced an internet outage throughout the hotel the last night we stayed there. Other than that it was a good experience and wouldn't mind recommending this hotel to others.",4,2013,11,06
37,Great hotel in a great location,The Le Meridien is a great hotel in and excellent location right on La Ramblas. Close to everything Gaudi and near two metro stops. It's part of Starwood hotels and we used points to stay which made the expensive summer rates much better. There is a great restaurant right across the street from the entrance. Amazing food! The hotel is small and compact but it gets the job done. Very modern and very boutique.,5,2013,11,06
37,"Location is all for this hotel, but rooms not the best","Location could not be better, in the middle of the Rambla, with a metro stop 2 minutes away … nothing to say fantastic!!

Staff very helpful ( I had a problem with my room)

Check in and check out, very slow …. and no rooms ready before 3 Pm ! I arrived very early but I had to wait till 3 Pm, for going into my room ( the some happened to all the guests)

I am an Spg Platinum but I didn't received any nice upgraded and amenities.

Breakfast, good but not as for the price You pay for such an hotel!!

My first room was very small , while the second one was better even if it meeds some renovation.

In my opinion a good position but the hotel needs a renovation and much service, for the star they have!!",3,2013,11,06
37,"Great location, let down by rigid policies","We stayed at Le Meridien for a total of 4 nights, with a break in between for a side trip to San Sebastian. The hotel's location is its best asset, right on La Ramblas and so accessible to most attractions & shopping nearby. Right opposite the hotel are a couple of excellent tapas restaurants esp Bar Lido in the inside corner. We had an SPG room which was quite nice although a bit small (understandable though given the location). Overall the service is fine, esp the concierge & porters. But what irked us was the hotels refusal to allow us to store some luggage while we took the side trip to another city, citing limited space & something about cruise passengers, so we had to take the luggage to an outside storage. Also irritating was room service refused to give us more complimentary bottle water when we checked in late on our return trip, saying we were limited to 2 bottles a room. The cost involved is less than 1 Euro! It is the little experiences that can make or spoil a holiday & I'm afraid those little irritations did it for us. Given the choices available in Barcelona, there is no need to stay here again.",3,2013,11,05
37,They have spent all their money on fashion and forgot about service.,"A most particular hotel. The first impression is the rather  casually dress porter/security staff.
They appeared as the bus could not get down the street. The windows are covered with some sort of plastic stickers.Looks as if the builders have just left.

Very poor seating in reception. There was only one gents toilet.

We had to wait for our room so we went to the Hotel across the road H3896. This was very nice.
Would go there the next time.

The bedroom had a light that came on if you got up to go to the toilet in the middle of the night.
Good idea you would think. But it came on if you moved in bed and flashed on and off making a loud clicking noise.  

A good location wasted.",2,2013,11,05
37,"Great Location, Average Rooms, Great Staff","This is a solid 4 star hotel, and it could be a  star easily by just making the rooms a little more user friendly. We actually really liked the hotel, but our room, which was an upgrade to the SPG Gold level, was just too small for a couple and the bathroom was situated so that that it was impossible to not awaken your spouse when using in the night. I could go one, but overall we highly recommend it, because of its location and terrific staff.",4,2013,11,01
37,Mother/Daughter Trip to Barcelona,"We recently spent five nights in a junior suite at Le Meridien Barcelona.  We found the room(s) to be very comfortable: the staff was lovely and professional and helpful.  We enjoyed the lobby lounge/coffee bar both day and evening.  The concierge staff were very helpful on many occasions. While the location is in a congested/touristy area, we noted that all other hotels that caught our attention as we wandered Barcelona were also in highly congested and touristy areas! The only issue was that the hotel's wifi was down for three of the five days of our visit.  And one got the impression this happened with some regularity.",4,2013,10,31
37,Fine hotel in a great location,"Prior to my trip, I had been reading all of the reviews.  I would agree with the overall tenor of the review.

The best part of the hotel is the location.  It is right on La Rambla.  You can walk virtually anywhere.  If you are in SPG member, the W is a nicer hotel, but on the beach and a car ride (at the least) to any other place you want to go in the City.  I secured a room using points for my 4-night stay.  I was upgraded to a larger room on the quiet side of the hotel.  No complaints with the noise which would be a significant problems if you were facing La Rambla.  The right was decent size by European standards.  Very modern.  We had a problem with the lighting which was quickly addressed by the staff, changing the burned out bulbs.

The business center is great, free internet there and a slower WI-FI in your room.  The high-speed internet from your room has to be purchased.  The exercise facility is acceptable.  It is in a windowless room with some Cardio machines and limited weights.  Nothing special.  However, I went for a job on the beach which was fantastic.

The staff was first-rate.  I would not eat anything at the hotel as you are right near a seemingly unlimited number of other places to eat.  By the way, if you go just one block off La Rambla, the costs drop significantly.",4,2013,10,28
37,Great hotel near La Ramblas,"Perfectly located hotel, with attractive modern rooms, and great in-room amenities including a huge rain shower and large flat screen tv. The staff was extremely helpful and noticed my partners birthday on the second night and placed a bottle of chilled cava and chocolate cream cake in the room prior to us coming back for the night. Will definitely be staying there again.",5,2013,10,27
37,"Great location, fantastic service, exceeded expectations!","Booked via a discount site for a joint birthday trip of 3 days/2 nights in late October 2913. First time in Barcelona, so we weren't sure what to expect.  We had researched the location, so knew that Las Ramblas was a tourist hotspot and that we would be in the middle of it all.

After about a 30min taxi ride from Barcelona airport, we arrived at Le Meridien, although we couldn't check in as we were a few hours early, we were allowed to store our bags whilst we familiarised ourselves with the city, with some great advice from the service desk.  After a long hot walk in what was standard October 24 degree sunshine, we went back to the hotel to get shown to our ""standard"" room (145). We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room, with great storage space, pullout sofa/bed, double sized shower with rain shower head, and tv in bathroom. Electronic fridge, so be careful about moving any items as you might get charged.

Despite what other reviewers have said, there is free wifi, which is slow, but perfectly fine for emails, social media etc.

After a long day site seeing on the 2nd day, we came back to a happy birthday cake and chilled bottle of cava from the hotel for my birthday, which was fantastic, and made this gal very happy.

We used the concierge service for tourist tickets, and found them very helpful, and the service desk was really useful with the advice.

Checkout on the last day, and hotel stored our luggage again, and booked taxi back to airport for us.

A fantastic hotel and service, and one that we would definitely recommend and visit again. Maybe next time, we will try a deluxe suite.",5,2013,10,27
37,"Good quality food, service was a big disappointment","Visited the restaurant with a group of 12 for evening meal, our group was seated in a separate dining area and pretty much forgotten about.

The menu was expense but the quality of the food justified the price. However, the had a list of issues with the food we were served - for example,  shoulder of lamb and potatoes was served minus the potato's, beef was order but a beef burger was served and told it would be a long wait for the beef it the burger was rejected.

Drinks orders had to be re-ordered constantly as the drinks failed to arrive.

Shorts with a mixer worked out at 14 euros.

Restaurant only stocked two bottles of the wine that we ordered and were told that any further bottles of wine purchased would be double the price of the two ordered. roll

Bread rolls not requested but served and charged 2 euro per person.

For fine dining restaurant the dessert menu was very uninspiring.

Average price per person in out party, was 60 euros for two drinks and main meal.

Although the food was excellent, the service was very hap hazard and disappointing.",3,2013,10,27
37,Barcelona Hotel,"We stayed at Le Meridien in August.  It was a great hotel in a great central location in Las Ramblas.  The hotel concierge was very helpful and made great recommendations for dinner and other activities.
      
      ",4,2013,10,26
37,"Loved the Hotel, the Location and the Staff","The street named Ramblas is pretty much the focal point for tourists in Barcelona.  Ramblas is essentially a charming pedestrian mall with a single lane on either side of the mall for vehicular traffic to move in each direction.  Le Meridien is on Ramblas and therefore is pretty much where all tourist would want to be located.  Many major Barcelona attractions are walking distance from Le Meridien.  In addition to the attractions there are many restaurants, pharmacies, and stores all within walking distance as well.  Public transportation (the Metro) is nearby.  
The room was attractive and always clean.  Closet space, cabinets and drawers are plentiful for two.  The bathroom was always immaculate after the maid cleaned.
We loved the staff.  In particular, the concierge, Bruno, was most helpful.  The ariline managed to lose our luggage and Bruno did everything we asked in an effort to retrieve the luggage.  Furthermore, Bruno told us the do's and don'ts for every attraction we wanted to see.  The front desk staff were all very nice and Lazaro stood out in particular for us.  Le Meridien is a great experience...enjoy it.",5,2013,10,25
37,Unbeatable Location on Las Ramblas,"You can't beat the location for walking around Las Ramblas, with the rooms clean and reasonably large for a 5-Star property, including a microwave/sink mini kitchen and a very comfortable Heavenly bed. Staying here is an excellent use of SPG points if you have them. The only major complaint with this property is the rip-off prices for internet access (19 euro/day for spotty wireless), phone calls (10-20 euros for ~5 min local calls), roll-away beds (45 euros/night), and food (33 euros for breakfast... just go outside and the price drops to 8 euros). The electronic-sensor fridge is also filled in such a way as to trigger false charges (easily cleared at checkout) if the door is so much as opened. While some of these details may be annoying, they are avoidable and do not detract much from the overall polish and class of this location. Like all hotels in Barcelona, use extreme caution if you plan to exceed the intended occupancy.",5,2013,10,25
37,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We recently stayed 3 nights inn this hotel and were very pleased. As has been stated by others, the location is excellent right off the Ramblas, close to the Gothic quarter and within easy walking distance to many popular sites and to transportation. 
Our room was large and very clean with an ironing board which came in handy. There is a large market a few doors away and a number of good and inexpensive restaurant nearby. Despite being so close to the Ramblas, it was quiet at night and the staff was very helpful and courteous. Would stay here again when in Barcelona.",4,2013,10,24
37,Lovely birthday surprise,Fantastic location just off Las Ramblas. Recently renovated rooms. Quiet and stylish. A warm touch from the staff with a bottle of cava and chocolate covered strawberries for my partner's birthday! Thank you. Well recommended.,5,2013,10,23
37,Can't beat the location,"In my book, when in Barcelona, you either stay on Passeig de Gracia (shopping) or on La Rambla (history).  I've stayed in hotels in both areas, and keep returning to Le Meridien on La Rambla.  I believe I've stayed 5 times now.  The hotel is small enough that you get attentive service, but large enough that you get all the creature comforts.  The standard rooms are a tad small, but well appointed, and they have double glass to keep them quiet from the activity on La Rambla.  The gym is pretty sad - about the size of hotel room and in the basement... that could definitely use an upgrade, even if it means at the expense of removing a few rooms on upper floors. Then again, you can always just get your exercise by walking around La Rambla, El Born, Raval and Barceloneta, all of which are immediately around Le Meridien.",5,2013,10,21
37,Great location but hotel is nothing special,"When I arrived at Le Meridien, the taxi driver deposited me and my bags on the sidewalk in front of the hotel and drove away.  No doorman was in sight and I so I began lugging my heavy bag up the stairs to the entrance of the hotel.  Then the door flew open and the doorman assisted me the rest of the way up the steps and into the lobby.  

After checking in I was taken to my room by the porter but we found that the maid was still cleaning the room.  The porter left me standing in the hallway with my bags while he returned to the lobby to check on getting another room.  About ten minutes later he returned and said that I must return to the lobby.  And so I sat in the lobby with my bags for perhaps half an hour before I was taken to another room.  The young lady at the desk apologized profusely for the situation and I do understand that when one travels, glitches are bound to occur from time to time.  But after many hours of international travel and arrival at the hotel about 1800, it was frustrating to have to wait for a room.

Things began to improve after I finally got to my room, had a light dinner in the hotel restaurant and got a good night's sleep.  

The hotel is ideally situated on La Rambla and within walking distance of many interesting places in this delightful city. I can't say that there is anything else that is special about this hotel, though.",3,2013,10,20
37,Simply beautiful,"I've stayed at the Meridien for around 4 nights in 2012. I've stayed in for 3 nights in luxurious old style suite overlooking La Rambla, and 1 night in a newly renovated modern and hip suite. Both suites were beautiful in their own way

Let's start with the pros: 1. Great location (1 min away from La Rambla, 5 min away from the fruit market and around 15 min away from the pier); 2. Friendly staff (a cake was sent to my parent's room as soon as they found out it was their anniversary); 3. amazing rooms (both classic and modern); 4. very nice interior

Overall, i truly enjoyed staying at the hotel and didn't face any issues throughout my stay

Personally, i would definitely stay there whenever i am in Barcelona",5,2013,10,20
37,Beautiful hotel!,"The hotel is perfectly located right on the La Rambla, close to sites and restaurants. Our room was very spacious, clean and updated. The bathroom was very very nice and there was a large closest/changing room next to the bathroom that was stocked with ironing board, iron, and hangers. The refrigerator had complementary water bottles in it and the next day a complementary fruit basket was placed in our room. The breakfast was good at the restaurant in the hotel but very expensive, we only ate there once. If you would like to pack some water/snacks for a full day of site seeing there is a grocery store right up the street from the hotel. The staff was very helpful and assisted us with directions to get to different areas of the city. When I visit Barcelona again I will definitely stay at this hotel.",5,2013,10,19
37,Fantastic location and almost perfect hotel,"Stayed in Le Meridien Hotel in March 2013 for few days as part of business group. Location is really great, on middle of famous La Rambla. Hotel has everything neccesery for nice stay but maybe lacks something extra for Le Meridien hotel, lacks personality if I may say. Staff was very nice, thumb up for this guys and girls. Not sure for the price, but maybe for same price you could find hotel that will swept you with factor X. But if you stay here, you also will not regret, that's for sure",4,2013,10,14
37,"Great Location, Great Staff!","Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights during a recent stay in Barcelona!  The location was great, the staff was nice too.  Felt very safe.  We stayed on the La Ramblas side and the room was a little noisier than I would've liked--- you could hear the cabs honk at times.  You won't be disappointed if you stay here!",4,2013,10,13
37,Wonderful experience in Barcelona,"This was the first of four hotels in Spain for this trip, and we were overwhelmed by the customer service and amenities. Staff at the front desk made us feel special, even though we arrived 3 hours before our room was ready (which was 3 hours before the posted ready time!). Gave us ideas on things to do until then. There is a great hot water kettle in the room, which while European typical small, was adequate and the refrigerator with extra space for us was nice. Great bed for sleeping! Easy email access in the business center, good health club, breakfast beyond belief, and a very impressive dinner menu. The best of all 4 very impressive hotels. Thanks for a great experience.",5,2013,10,13
37,I Love This Hotel!!,"This hotel has the most perfect location in all of Barcelona!!  I have stayed here once before for 5 days and loved it.  Unfortunately, this was only a 1 night stay and because of flight problems, my husband and I basically just slept at the hotel and didn't get to spend any time in Barcelona. :-(   Our room was small, but nicely appointed.  The bathroom had all glass walls and looked like something you would find in a W Hotel.  Our room was on the 2nd floor and overlooked the Rambla, but the noise was not bad at all.  I just wish I hadn't been so tired after the long flight from California and the time changes.  We are SPG Gold member so the hotel let us check out at 4:00 pm instead of 12:00 pm... which was super nice since i didn't wake up until noon!!",5,2013,10,12
37,Great location,"As others have said, this hotel is just off Las Ramblas near ""the action"". It is a lovely hotel, decent size rooms, good bathrooms, very nice lobby with a lovely coffee bar that I stopped by each morning. Within walking distance to many many sites like the Picasso Museum and the old part of the city. Also a tiny but lovely rooftop ""spa"" with a small soaking tub outside that was very pleasant in the warm weather. Only withheld a star because it was noisy at night. Ask for a quiet room.",4,2013,10,12
37,Flawless,"The location of the hotel is in a very ""high energy"" location with tons of tourist traffic and locals alike enjoying La Rambla. During our stay there was a festival that was for the patron St. of Barcelona & there was a festive air directly outside of the hotel. Inside the hotel was modern quiet. A wonderful respite from the activity outside. From check in to check out the hotel impressed. Great shower. Perfect not overly hard bed. Good natural light in the room. Large living space & enough power outlets in the right places. Quiet. Fantastic Spanish breakfast with fresh squeezed orange juice. Overall felt that the place offered fantastic value for cost. If you cant be happy here you may want to reexamine your reasons for travelling. 

Word to the wise: Unless you absolutely need a car to go far away from the city on business or something the public transportation and taxi system cant be beat in Barcelona. Parking at this hotel, while available and well marked, would be both expensive and foolish due to the difficulty of a non local navigating the streets to get to this hotel. 

We stayed at this hotel at the end of September 2013 for 4 nights. I was in room 244.",5,2013,10,09
37,Unexpectedly good hotel,"I've stayed at a lot of hotels and I didn't have great hopes for this hotel due to the location. We had a Prestige Suite which was a spacious 2 room corner suite with a great view of La Rambla and a Mediterranean Suite which was on an upper floor with a single room and a quite spacious terrace and outdoor seating areas and a shower (without a view, but still very nice). The staff were very friendly throughout the stay and quickly and professionally resolved an error with room service. A very pleasant stay.",5,2013,10,09
37,Comfort amidst the action,"It means a lot to have an excellent hotel close to the action in the most popular place in the city. We were able to walk to most major attractions. Plenty of restaurants and shops. Clean, comfortable room. Good service. Excellent food. Our view was balconies of laundry on some crowded side street.",5,2013,10,08
37,A great stay in Barcelona,"Great (no, amazing) location in the heart of Barcelona.  Staff was extremely friendly; concierge in particular was better than we've had in most other locations (restaurants, tourism sites, etc.).  Rooms were also quite nice.  Will stay here again!",5,2013,10,08
37,Fab location and service,"Spent two nights at the Meridian before our cruise embarkation.  Room was nice sized, very clean, big bathroom, very quiet.  Concierge was a delight and very efficient, the front desk also very helpful and considerate of tired travelers.  Location was on la Ramblas,very short walk to the Bacqueria Market, the largest and best in Barcelona.  Tapas bars abound, fresh fruit, smoothies, great people watching.  Little tapas bar on the corner had great wine and a super place to sample the local tapas and savor the ambience.  Very reasonable prices.

Added bonus: my wife left her curling iron at the hotel and the next day we called from the cruise ship; the hotel had found it and saved it for us.  Unbelievable.  Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,10,07
37,"Beautiful property, fantastic location!!","This is an amazing hotel location, right off La Rambla in the heart of the action of Barcelona! It's easy to get to from the International airport, convenient to the metro and very nice walkable options nearby. The staff is friendly and the concierge is a very useful resource - good for dinner suggestions, maps, ideas. The room was beautiful and comfortable, but tiny! Not an issue if you're there to spend time walking and experiencing the city. The lobby and hotel in general are gorgeous. I would highly, highly recommend this property and location. I will return!",5,2013,10,06
37,Visiting Barcelona,"In mid July my husband, granddaughters and I visited Barcelona, Spain spending the night at Le Meridien.  This hotel has a great location right off La Rambla.  We could stroll the Ramblas and visit the market daily which gave us an opportunity to observe so much of the people and places in Barcelona.  The staff at the hotel were very helpful answering all of our questions and giving us great directions to all places we visited.The rooms were quite large and very accommodating with robes and slippers.  We loved our stay and when visiting Barcelona in the future will return to Le Meridien.",5,2013,10,03
37,Great Location on La Rambla,"Wonderful stay.... great, modern hotel, nice amenities, but no pool (was disappointed with that), great service.  The suite upgrade is definitely worth it.

Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was good, great attractions within walking distance.  Attempted to contact the concierge several times for suggestions, but was never available.",5,2013,10,03
37,Friendliest staff ever,Great location. Wonderful restaurant. A great choice in central Barcelona. Rooms good size. Friendliest staff ever. Would recommend without hesitation. Perfect spot to wander the streets of Old Barcelona. ,4,2013,10,01
37,Prof Jeff at the Le Meridien Barcelona,"This Starwood Hotel is situated on the very famous Las Ramblas.  It is within an easy walk from the end stop of the bus from the Airport.  This is always an advantage for me as I prefer public transport to taxis.  The hotel is a blend of old and new.  The room décor is modern but far from overstated and suited me perfectly.
The lobby area is very inviting and there are two bars and a restaurant on this level.
My room faced the main street which is very busy but even with my window open I was not aware of any street noise.  From my room I had a great few of the tree tops and some wonderful old buildings.
If wanted within a short walk are many of the tourist hotspots, the underground rail system and the main shopping streets.
So for a home in central Barcelona this hotel is to be recommended.  The feeling of being at home is accentuated by the excellent staff.",4,2013,10,01
37,"Great Location, Incredible Service","The location of this property is hard to beat.  Located right on Las Ramblas and therefore allowing you to enjoy Barcelona by foot or via the metro very easily.

We were a group of 18, all with a number of different demands, however the concierge team of Ricardo, Bruno and Christian were absolutely first class.  Organising tickets for entertainment, Michelin start restaurants, directions maps, what ever anyone threw at these guys they handled and it was never a chore.

The front desk team managed by Walter again is efficient and first class.

The bedroom product is what you would expect of a good 4 star hotel, with some of the suites being a perhaps bit small if you are from the U.S.  

All in all though we will be back to this property as the overall experience here was great.",5,2013,09,30
37,Excellent customer service,"Spent only 2 nights at Le Meridien.   The entry is nothing to write home about, no photo opportunities in the hotel at all really.   What the hotel lacks in character and atmosphere they make up for with helpful staff and a great location.  We used the concierge to help us find everything, which they were more than happy to do.  Our room was pretty standard but with an extremely comfortable bed, luxurious bathroom and quiet.  If you have limited time and want a certain 'standard'  this is a good choice.",4,2013,09,30
37,"Great location and service, so-so amenities","The location right on Las Ramblas carries heavy favorable weight.  Its location maximizes your visits by foot for all surrounding attractions, including metro access.

Staff also makes this a strong 4 star, with excellent customer service at front desk, SPG desk and concierge.  We were warmly greeted by Marius, who not only got us immediately checked in, but provided an excellent dinner recommendation.  Give that man a raise, a promotion, or both!

If you are noise sensitive, then request a room on the south side of building (up to floor 6)",4,2013,09,29
37,Nice place,"I stayed there on 22/23 September. I would not give 5 stars to the hotel, but I can say it is rather cozy. 
The location is perfect. The view on Ramblas is nice, but noisy. The service is good, but nothing exceptional.",4,2013,09,26
37,More than expected,"When reading the comments by others on Trip Advisor the one that struck me most was from a Starwood member who said "" expect a Sheraton."" 
The hotel was much more than a typical Sheraton. Room was large..TV was huge..bathroom was really nice.
Lobby was remodeled to look new? didn't care for that.
Because we are Starwood members were upgraded to a room with a balcony on the street...liked it very much.
Staff is FANTASTIC! Extremely helpful with every/any question. Did everything they could for us to make our stay great!
Location is great.",5,2013,09,25
37,Some pros......some cons.... It all depends on your priorities,"Instead of a long winded description this is my evaluation

Pro.... Great location, walk out the door and you're on Ramblas
Pro.....friendly staff
Pro......clean
Pro.....Starwood points
Pro... Extra Starwood points for opting out of daily maid service

Con....Very soft...too soft for me, bed, back problems? The beds won't work for you.
Con.....beds are so low that you feel like you're sleeping in a ditch
Con.....only news on TV or 25 USD movie from five years ago
Con... Free wi- fi stinks... Upgrade is 19 euro a day
Con......very high room service rates, even for hotel
Con....rooms are VERY small for the very high room rate

That's it so, if the pros are more important than the cons, good place, otherwise not.

",4,2013,09,24
37,Perfect!,"Great location (easy to walk to many places worth exploring), extremely helpful staff (who spoke excellent English), great concierge service, comfortable, clean, and everything as I would have wished. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2013,09,24
37,"Good hotel, GREAT LOCATION","This was our first stay in an SPG hotel and we were very pleased with the outcome.

Check in process was straight forward and staff very friendly and welcoming! Also a bonus in our book.

We stayed on an SPG floor and found the rooms to be more than adequate for our needs... Clean and comfortable.

Don't stay at this hotel if you are looking for luxury... Stay because of the fabulous location right on La Ramblas.",4,2013,09,23
37,Nice but not incredible,"As a Lifetime Platinum I have stayed over 500 nights in Starwood Hotels.  Bottom line this is a nice hotel, with a good location.  When you read the list of famous people who have stayed here you might expect it to be fabulous and luxurious.  I wouldn't say it was that.  I would put it in the top 10-20% of Starwood hotels.  Modern decor (typical to Le Meridien).  Staff quite nice.  Breakfast buffet was quite good.  We got a good rate in the mid or high 200s, not sure I would spend in the 300s for this though unless that was the going rate in this city at this time.  If I was going to spend in the 300s, I would see what else I could also get.  Families note: no swimming pool.  (Ignore my pool rating - a mistake.)",4,2013,09,22
37,Disappearing reservation in SPG accounts,"I am arguing since two weeks with this hotel because they see in their system that I have booked two rooms. The second room reservation was not visible in my account and I was informed 2 days after the room was stated in their system with no show. At this time point, I was already staying in the hotel.
I really ask myself, how it can be possible that a prepaid reservation disappears. But the worst thing is that the hotel employees were not able to come with a convincing solution and want me to pay a 4 night stay.
After this experience I have big doubts about the promises given by the SPG hotels in their website. For instance, exceptional service and memorable brand experience???",2,2013,09,18
37,Average service premium rates,"Up graded to suite but carpet shabby, lamp not working, stain on curtain
Lighting in room very bad. Could not see what was
in the wardrobe. Very disappointed. Redeeming feature is the 
Bathroom, fittings very good standard and clean
      
      ",3,2013,09,17
37,Satisfy,"I stayed this hotel for 3 nights as part of 21 Day Romantic Seine & Rhone Paris to Barcelona APT tour in June 2013.  The room is spacious and well equipped.  The front desk staffs are very helpful but I have some concerns on the housekeeping staff because I came back to my room one morning found the wardrobe door was wide open and someone seemed have gone through my things, but nothing was taken.  I reported to the front desk immediately and asked them to investigate.

I have been to the restaurants for buffet breakfasts and dinners.  The food there was very nice but there was limited choice of food in buffet breakfasts.

The hotel seemed to be quite security conscious as there are security guards not only monitoring the lobby but also the restaurant during dinner.

The hotel location is very convenient as it is right on the La Rambla.",4,2013,09,15
37,"Location, location, location!!..but...","This is my 3rd visit to barcelona and is my first time to visit the meridian hotel where I stayed for four nights. I arrived at 11 AM but the room was not ready and I had to wait until 2 PM (according to them checking in is at 3 PM). 

It's very conveniently located near major attraction areas, carrefore supermarket and Starbucks were just a few steps away and there is a restaurant in front of the hotel:serving nice pizza but the hamburger and fries were average. 

Back to the hotel: the size of the deluxe room was not bad for a European style. 
TV has only 5 English news channels and 5 Arabic channels and the rest were Spanish including other languages. 
The soundproof in the room is outstanding.
The bathroom water pressure is excellent . 
Room service is good (they have excellent sea food selections, try the seafood Paella but definitely avoid minestrone soup) . 
                                     
                HOWEVER, 

The bed was soft but very close to the ground and for people who have back pain I don't recommend it. I asked for the king bed however I was provided with 2 twin beds next to each other. 
The room temperature was hot and humid( no matter how low you put the temperature in the thermostat).
On several occasions, house keeping entered the room without knocking. 
Breakfast has the basic items with very limited options. 
Overall staff were friendly but some were impatient particularly when asking for directions.",3,2013,09,13
37,Great location in Barcelona!,This hotel is right on La Rambla so you can walk everywhere! I even walked to Barcelonetta and back from the hotel because there are so many things to see along the way anyway. My room was very nice and comfortable!!  I would definitely stay here again whenever I find myself back in beautiful Barcelona!,5,2013,09,13
37,Excellent location,"Overall great hotel that I would highly recommend.  Rooms were clean, updated and quite.  Staff was very friendly.  Location is second to none.  All of the city is easily accessible from this hotel.  We did not eat at the hotel so won't comment on that but staff gave some excellent dinner recommendations and made reservations for us.  I would definitely stay here again",5,2013,09,09
37,Great location and spacious hotel,"This is one of the best Le Meridien hotels I stayed at. The room was spacious and updated. Being SPG gold, we got upgraded to a huge suite, which was a pleasant surprise since these days it seems like everybody is SPG gold. Location wise it is right off of Las Ramblas and close to shopping.",5,2013,09,09
37,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel was truly one of the best hotels in Barcelona. The staff are attentive, always willing to help and knowledgeable about the local area. I have to give full credit to the manager of the hotel who helped ensure I was accommodated throughout my stay.",5,2013,09,08
37,A Beautiful Hotel in a Beautiful City,"Well appointed rooms and excellent service compliment the adjacency to great restaurants, shopping, art and architecture. The most famous street in Barcelona ""Las Ramblas"" is mere steps from the front door.",5,2013,09,05
37,Decent Barcelona Hotel with a great location!,Great location right on la rambla street 5 minute walk from Plaza de Catalonia if you take the bus. The rooms are nice we had a view facing the back of the hotel so had a hideous view. Good restaurants nearby and staff are good!,4,2013,09,05
37,Perfect Barcelona hotel,"We were very impressed with this hotel.  This is the first time we have been to Barcelona and we were so happy with the location of the hotel.  It is right in the center of the city, on La Rambla and close to the Metro, near the Cathedral, good shopping and great restaurants area all around the hotel.  When we checked in they upgraded our room for only 50 Euro more per night to a lovely room with a balcony/view over La Rambla and a view of the sea and the mountains.  I would highly recommend Le Meridien.",5,2013,09,05
37,Meets expectations of price and brand,"Honestly I was torn between giving an ""Average"" and ""Very good"" rating, not because there was anything wrong with the hotel but because I held it to high standards.  
The Meridien is in a prime location on La Rambla (though I personally preferred the ambiance of Passeig de Gracia), a one minute walk north of the famous La Boqueria and conveniently next door to a Carrefour supermarket.  The hotel itself has large well-lit rooms (though I could never figure out which switch did what, and in some cases the lights all went or all went off), and the shower booth in particular was quite nice with the two large showerheads, decent though not great water pressure and plenty of room for even a large guy like me to maneuver.  But at these rates at a Meridien branded property in a premium location such features meet but do not significantly exceed expectations.  One thing that did impress me was how quiet it was once I got in my room, which admittedly did not face La Rambla but onto the rear facades of several buildings.
As I stayed for two nights during the height of August busy season the staff were constantly mobbed but they managed to remain pleasant and polite.  They also were able to get me into a room by 1 p.m.  Among the staff, of particular note is Ricardo at the concierge desk.  I noticed at least one other reviewer mentioned his patience and willingness to go the extra mile, and my experience was the same.  Kudos to Ricardo and others at the concierge; it's his personal touch that nudged my rating up to ""Very good"".
I also had dinner at the hotel's Cent Onze restaurant without even knowing at first that it was in the hotel (came back from a long day of walking around and happened to waltz in the La Rambla entrance rather than through the hotel entrance) and had a very pleasant experience there as well, with impeccable service and superb food (my impression was sort of French-Catalan ""fusion"") - will post a seperate review for that.  Did not have breakfast however.",4,2013,09,05
37,Excellent location!,"This hotel is within walking distance from a few of the must see sights in Barcelona. It is also very close to the Metro lines. There is a supermarket (Carrefour) located in the same block as the hotel. It is a block away from Plaza Catalunya and 1.5 blocks from the famous boqueria. And of course, you're right on La Rambla. There's also Jean Georges restaurant at the lobby. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Just be careful of cab drivers- all of the cab drivers we used had tried to overcharge us with bogus add-ons. Read the breakdown of charges posted on the right passenger window.",4,2013,09,04
37,Close to everything,"Perfect location!  This hotel is located right off Las Ramblas, a busy walkway of outdoor shops and restaurants.  Las Ramblas is about a mile long and connects Placa de Catalunya (city center) to the marina area and beach on the Mediterranean.  

The Gothic Quarter is right across Las Ramblas from the hotel where you will find more shops and better restaurants than the ones on Las Ramblas.  If you like to stay up late, the Placa Reial is a square located right off Las Ramblas and is a short walk from the hotel.  There are several restaurants and bars that surround a fountain in the square - very fun atmosphere at night.

We got massages at the hotel and found a very quiet little terrace and hot tub up on the spa floor - very relaxing spot after a busy day walking around the city.

Loved this hotel!",5,2013,09,04
37,Le Meridien at his best!,"The service is impeccable from Tonke at the desk, to Bruno at the concierge, to Water in management. The rooms are very confortable with all of the amenities expected from Le Meridien. The large walk in showers are a delight. The breakfast buffet is delicious and incorporates everything an international guests base would expect. The location of the hotel is absolutely amazing at the corner of La Rambla just steps away from placa de Catalunya and La Boqueria. 
A great tip is the hotel accross H1898 has a fantastic rooftop terrace with great tapas and drinks for the evening.",5,2013,09,04
37,"Close to the action, sites and shopping!","Wonderful hotel in the heart of Barcelona, close to everything. Hop on a double decker tour bus just down the road from the hotel (take the blue line). The Hotel is well appointed with nice amenities. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Excellent value. ",5,2013,09,03
37,Right on Las Ramblas,"We stayed here after a Western Mediterrenean cruise with our family.  We booked 4 rooms for one night.  It is very conveniently located right on Las Ramblas which means you can just stroll out of the hotel right into the thick of things.  :) The gothic quarter is literally a few minutes away.  

The hotel was very, very busy when we checked in as it seems to be popular amongst those who were pre or post cruising.  While we waited, we had brunch at Luzia restaurant which was right beside the hotel - highly recommended, by the way.  :)

For the rate, the room is mediocre - small (but that's to be expected in Barcelona and I did not take off points for size) and basic.  I did not like the bathroom, the shower stall was too dark (made of black stone).  My pet peeve also - why be so stingy on toiletries?  We certainly were not stingy in paying for the room rate.  I think I had higher expectations given that this is Le Meridien but there was no turn down service (and no, we did not have a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door).   

I must say though that we had dinner at the hotel restaurant (and it was for a large party) and the service was TRULY phenomenal!  Very, very friendly and warm service.  I ordered vegetable soup for my baby and when it came out and I could not mash the veggies because they were still hard, the waiter came right up to me and took it away without me asking.  He came out with a pureed veggie dish which was perfect.  Mind you, I didn't even have to ask.  Now that is service! 

",4,2013,09,03
37,The Awesomest Hotel,"As the title Says this Stay of mine was Phenomenal 
The Location of this Hotel Is Super Awesome
The Ramblas is a Amazing Neighbourhood
The Hotel is Tastefully Designed And Amazing
I stayed in a Deluxe Room Which was Huge
The view Of the Ramblas was also Nice
The Staff Here is Really Helpful And Super Nice
The Bathrooms are Clean And Big
It was my Last Days in Spain but this Hotel really  Cheered The Sad Me",5,2013,08,31
37,"SPG Platinum Stay, everything you hear is true!","Just returned from a single night stay with my wife.  I am SPG platinum member and used points for the stay as well as a suite upgrade certificate.  We arrived early in the morning as we had just returned from a cruise.  Did not get off to a great start as I am pretty sure the taxi ripped us off by taking us on a tour of the city.  Realized the hotel was much closer than our cab ride!

Were not able to get into a room as it was so early.  At 7 am pretty much only thing you will see on the streets are the drunk kids from the night before!  So I must say this all left a very bad taste in my mouth!  Then while waiting in the lobby for something to open the front desk manager mentioned that they had a suite they could give me for an additional cost (just as I had read online).  Told him we were fine and could wait for the room we had.  Which was a junior suite that I had been upgraded to with my certificate.  

The hotel location is outstanding if you want to be in the action.  Right off of La Rambia.  This is a busy street and walkway with all kinds of restaurants and bars.  When we returned from breakfast we were told the room still was not available.  However, they gave us a standard room to use so we could change and rest for a bit.  That was very nice on their part.  We went back out to tour the town and got back about 3.  To my surprise we had been upgraded to the largest room they have!  Got to say it was the nicest room I have ever stayed in and I have been in a lot of nice hotels!!!

The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful.  It got slammed in there and they still were extremely helpful.  The hotel lobby is small but very clean.  The room was amazing!

Top floor room with excellent view of the city.  Two outside balconies and a large living room that had 350 degree views.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  Bathroom had separate tub  and shower with double sinks and heated floors.  The bedroom looked out over the city.  Large flat screen HDTV (only like 2 channels in English).  There is free Wifi but it is very slow.  They do offer a pay wifi that is much faster (free for platinums).  We got free breakfast also which is a buffet style.  They did have omelet station and large selection of pasteries.  

I really cant say enough about how first class this room was!  The standard room we had for a short time that day was also very nice.  At first I would have expected that was a junior suite.

Would without a doubt stay here again.  Not sure why we were upgraded to the presidential suite but was a nice touch after our bad start.",5,2013,08,27
37,Good choice in Barcelona,"We just spent 5 nights at this hotel and it was great.  Our room was an executive suite and the other member in our group had a junior suite.  I understand that several of the floors had been renovated, and both rooms looked very new and welcoming.  Our room had comfortable beds(forget about a ""king size"" bed, it's two twins pushed together which is common in Europe) huge modern bathroom with great toiletries, dressing area and wardrobe, sound proofed windows, cold (and more importantly) quiet air conditioning system.  The location is on a corner just a few steps from La Ramblas street.  This street is very alive at all hours of the day, so it was nice that this noise doesn't bother you when your at your hotel and want to relax.  
The food at the hotel was really good.  We had our breakfasts in our rooms and it was very good.  My biggest complaints was that my food always arrived cold!  The Jean Jaques Croque Madame sandwich was delicious...but cold.  The Barcalona breakfast (churros with a cup of nice thick hot chocolate) was also delicious but arrived equally cold, except for the hot chocolate which was hot.  If I wasn't so hungry on both occasions I would have sent it back and they definitely would have taken care of it.  We also tried the capriciosa pizza which tasted very good.  This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  ",5,2013,08,26
37,You can do better in Barcelona,"I see this is billed as a 5 star hotel, and I caution anyone with those expectations to lower them right now.
We are fairly loyal to the Starwood brand, especially when it comes to city hotels.  This one probably lands in the middle for us, not really anything great or bad.
We were placed in a standard room on a Starwood Preferred Guest floor, which entitled us to free high speed wifi (a mind boggling 19Eu/night otherwise) and a couple of free coffees.  Our room did not face Las Ramblas, but instead Hotel 1898, which I considered a plus as it was still fairly noisy in our room.  The bathroom in our room was nice.  I liked the big bathtub/shower.  It could have used more counter space, but otherwise I really liked the design.  The rest of the room had a lot of space for storage of luggage/clothing, but the bedroom area was not very big.  This was not a big deal to us; the bed was comfortable and that was pretty much the most important thing to us.
The hotel does not offer a pool or a spa.  I did see spa services were offered, perhaps on the second floor, but the menu was fairly limited.
I read here on tripadvisor that a lot of people do not advise staying on Las Ramblas because it is so touristy, but we honestly found it really convenient.  We used the subway often to site-see, and walked to dinner every night.  I think the furthest from the hotel we walked was maybe a mile and we found great local restaurants off the tourist path.
The lobby area has a coffee bar that offers great Illy coffee products and a small offering of other continental breakfast items. 
My main complaint here was the hotel service.  We arrived late morning, absolutely exhausted from our long journey from the states.  I knew it was not a guarantee to check in early, but we were holding out hope.  We arrived and they told us it would be a few hours, so basically we could check in at the official check in time.  They told us to keep checking back, and we wandered off to get lunch.  After a bleary walk down Las Ramblas seeking food, and craving a shower and clean clothing we stumbled back praying something was available.  No, not until check in time.   I understand their hotel policies- and they were very busy- but we were literally falling asleep in the lobby around 2:30 and, sure enough, our room was available at 3 p.m. exactly.   They made absolutely no attempt to accommodate us, or even communicate they were doing everything they could to get the room turned around, which is very unlike the many other hotels we have stayed where we arrived hours before check in. This was a sour start to our trip, unfortunately, and the service did not improve much over our stay.  Staff was overall not very friendly, not greeting us, not smiling, or really acknowledging our presence at all.  My husband did have good experiences with the hotel concierge, so that was a positive.
We adored Barcelona and would stay at Le Meridien again if the exchange rate for spg points (we paid 12,000/night) remained low, but would not expect anything special from the hotel.",3,2013,08,26
37,"Excellent location, terrible internet","I stayed here with a group, check in was a little slow as didn't have my name on the booking only the girl I was staying with but I hadn't met her yet. May not have been the hotels fault though. Excellent location, friendly service.Gym is small but decent. No pool. Now the internet, there's 2 options high speed which you have to pay an additional amount or low speed which is much slower and drops out at least once a day.  I don't think it's reasonable to have to pay extra for something which I feel should be included in the price we had paid per night. Breakfast was amazing.  Our bathroom only had a shower, no bath not sure if there's rooms with baths but we would have appreciated one.",4,2013,08,26
37,Very good experience,"A very good experience, the hotel in general is very good and in a excellent location, the room is quite big comparing to the other 5 stars hotel in the same area. Only missing a swimming pool :). I enjoyed my 3 nights stay in this hotel, the stuff are very helpful and cheerful. ",4,2013,08,23
37,Good location,"Located right on La Ramlas, the location is great.  Within walking distance of many attractions.  However, I was a little disappointed in the hotel.  The staff should have been better trained!  Sometimes helpful, sometimes not, but much too stuffy.  Check in was not a great expereicne, with all 'trainees' manning the counters.  The hotel itself is not maintained as a 5 star hotel should have been.  Too many worn out sofas, bulbs out in the rooms, and the elevators look like they need a slight make-over.  While certainly not terrible, for the money, I expected more.",4,2013,08,21
37,"Great location, great service","Stayed at this hotel before and after our cruise. Great hotel and excellent service. Staff at front desk were always helpful and had a smile on their face.  The concierge Ricardo deserves a special mention for his helpfulness and patience with helping us to arrange tours, taxis and special requests. Location is excellent, right off La Rambla.  Just beware of pickpockets when you get outside! One suggestion is avoid the first floor as you sometimes here the subway going by (at least I think it was!)",4,2013,08,21
37,Right in the middle of the action,"Location, location, location. You literally walk out the front lobby and you are 10 steps away from world famous La Ramblas and a two minute walk to the Gothic Quarter and Plaza Cataluña. From there you can catch many tour and transport options to all of Barcelona's attractions, museums and business districts. Despite being so close to a street that never sleeps the rooms are very quiet and virtually void of street noise. The rooms are very nice and we got upgraded to a large suite. The bar looks right over La Ramblas but there really are not a lot of other common areas in the hotel to speak of. The coffee bar in the lobby is not always open but there is a Starbucks right next door and plenty of home made gelato close by. Overall, a great place to use as your base to work or play in this great city.",4,2013,08,19
37,Very convenient location. Nice rooms,"Stayed here for one night after our cruise.  Meridien is in a very convenient location on La Ramblas and walking distance to shops and Catalunya square where a lot tours took off from.   With a family of 5, we got a connecting room overlooking La Ramblas.  Fun to see the hustle bustle of this touristy street.  Free wifi but it was very slow and unstable. Better luck using internet in the lobby. The bathroom was spacious but the temperature of the water changes. Meridien is also 2 blocks away from the market where you can get fresh fruits and prosciutto and all kinds of fresh food. Go check it out but be aware of pick pockets.",4,2013,08,19
37,"Nice hotel, but not quite 5 star","My 17-year-old daughter and I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona on a recent trip to Spain. I booked through Voyage Prive for a very good price. The hotel is quite nice and the location is fantastic. Although it is right on La Rambla, the rooms are very quiet and we had no problems with noise whatsoever. The common areas are rather small but nicely designed and well kept.The staff is nice and friendly and everyone speaks English. In fact, it seems that most all of the guests were Americans, Canadians, or Brits.  We had a standard room and it was very large. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom nice and well stocked with products and towels. We were quite comfortable. The only reason I'm not giving Le Meridien a 5 is their wireless internet. They claim to have free wifi, and technically they do, but I was unable to even download my email on the free wifi. Therefore you have to pay for the high speed wifi and it is absurdly expensive. Otherwise, the hotel is great and is a convenient, comfortable base for a stay in the lovely city of Barcelona.",4,2013,08,18
37,Nice modern style on the ramblas,"This hotel located on the ramblas in Barcelona, close to everything.  Great modern design and fun lobby.  The staff bare extremely nice and helpful.  You may have to wait a few hours for your room.  Our room was not ready until 5 pm but worth the wait.  The room was quiet which was surprising given the location.  I have been there twice and one time hadva large balcony overlooking the city.  The gym is small but equipped with some treadmills and elipticals.  The bar is chill with windows facing the ramblas, good people watching.  The price is a bit high for Spain.  Highly recommend if you want to be in center of  the beautiful city of Barcelona.",4,2013,08,16
37,Great location however poor service,"Great location in the middle of la ramblas. Clean and modern rooms and facilities.

However for the rate you pay, service was quite poor. Here are the cons: concierge not very friendly, front desk no communicating with their team well, house keeping not cleaning rooms, provided tea and coffee however to kettle.

It's the little things which make or break an experience. I would not recommend Le Meridien. ",3,2013,08,15
37,Great Location!!,"I booked this for a few days after we were on a cruise.  The price is alittle on the high side, especially with the US dollar conversation.  But we were pretty happy with the accomodations, the room was clean the shower was the high light of the room for me.  The staff was very friendly, we opt for the daily breakfast, it was a little pricy but was worth the convenience.  It was right in the heart of Ramblas, which was really nice.  I thnk my only complaint was the tv channel selection.  The only english channels were news and their movies were $20 bucks each!  So didn' get to really enjoy being in our room.  But all and all was a great pick!",4,2013,08,15
37,Top Hotel in Great location,"Hotel is in a fantastic location and yet offers a calmness in a lovely lively area.  The staff are excellent, the rooms are great and the beds are so comfortable its hard to get up in the morning.  The food in the restaurant is excellent and the daily menus are delicious and great value. Breakfast was lovely but quite expensive, so suggest walking 3 minutes to Boqueria market or popping next door to Carrefour!  Overall a fantastic choice of hotel in a fantastic location.",5,2013,08,14
37,Wonderful Location on the Ramblas,"The location of this hotel can't be beat.  Location is great because it was right on the Ramblas and walking distance to a lot of things....just a couple of blocks from La Boqueria and El Corte Ingles.  There was a Carrefour (supermarket) next door where we bought fresh juice; and the famous Iberico ham sandwich at Viena café was just a few doors up.  One of the travel books that I read basically said the staff ignored you if you were not rich or famous.  I'm not rich or famous, but we were treated very well by the front desk personnel and all the other service people we encountered.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful and not snooty as the travel guide implied.  Our room was very nicely appointed.  They had two complimentary bottles of water for us each day.  We used the internet without any problems.  Our room was in the back so we did not encounter the street noise that some people have mentioned.  They serve a wonderful breakfast buffet at Cent Onze.  Highly recommended.",5,2013,08,13
37,Great Location !!!!,"We had a good stay at the Le Meridien Barcelona overall, The location is unbeatable facing the La Ramblas which is a lively street full of restraunts Bars and Shops The famous Boqueria Market is three minutes walk from the hotel and a great place for Breakfast and the restraunts by the wharf ,metro etc is all within very easy access 
The room is very modern and Bathroom is new and contemporary with either a shower or tub spacious enough for european standards and very clean.  Free WIFI in the room but a slow connection but good enough ,however you may pay and obtain a speedy connection if required 
The front office was very courteous and helpful so was the conceirge 
The Hop on bus stop in also a five minutes away from the hotel.
Lobby is fairly small and nothing Fancy but nice !!! The only minus was that they did not have a swimming pool not that we missed it much though we had kids and with all the activities around we hardly had anytime for a swim
Overall We really enjoyed our stay at The Le Meridien and probably will only stay at this hotel when we return to Barcelona again",4,2013,08,13
37,Great location,"We just got back from 7 nights in Barcelona, and we stayed at LeMeridien the entire time.  Overall, we had a great experience.  The hotel is incredibly convenient to everything.  Concierge services were helpful and knowledgeable. Every staff member we encountered was professional and service-oriented.  Our room was a deluxe king overlooking Las Ramblas, with a sofa, coffee table, desk, and balcony--plenty of room for my husband and me.  In general, the hotel was clean and neat.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.  I only have two minor negative comments:  there is no pool, and they did not use a fitted sheet on the bed, so our sheets were always coming off by the time we woke up in the morning.  Minor issues.  I'm really glad we stayed at Le Meridien.",5,2013,08,09
37,The Best of Barcelona,"This past June we spent three days in Barcelona.  We tried to find a nice hotel that was centrally located.  We considered several before selecting the Le Meridien Barcelona.  Once we arrived at the hotel, we knew that we had made the correct choice.  The hotel is located near the Las Ramblas, the central street in Barcelona.  The security was great and the rooms were first class.  We left our car with the valet and basically walked everywhere we wanted to go. 
 
The rooms of the hotel were well appointed with great showers and comfortable beds.  The breakfast at the hotel was delicious and the front desk personnel were very accommodating. One of the front desk personnel, Rafael, was particularly helpful and made every effort to insure that my family was well taken care of.  

We were there during a holiday where they set off fireworks etc.  Although we could hear the occasional explosion, our hotel room was half a block off the main street and insulated from most of the noise. The hotel staff was very courteous and genuinely concerned about making certain that our stay was enjoyable. When we visit Barcelona again, this is definitely where we will stay.",5,2013,08,08
37,Fantastic Stay at Le Meridien,"I am from Canada and have to say.......I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat!! We spent four days here. The location was fantastic as we could walk anywhere from this centrally located hotel. Also, the room was luxurious and well maintained.  The staff from the front desk to the concierge were fantastic in helping us with our needs (passes to a local gym) and helping us with our map to get to various places we wanted to go. Also close to our departure the fron desk and concierge helped hold our baggage and were willing to help us book a hotel for our stopover in London. The staff was outstanding in their service and helpfulness. I would love to go back and stay at this hotel!!! The luxury of the total and staff made it a fabulous and memorable trip!",5,2013,08,05
37,Five Star Location on Las Ramblas,"The Le Meridien lives up to the 5-star rating for its location, service and quality of accommodations.   We stayed at the hotel for several nights following a transatlantic cruise that ended in Barcelona and we were pleased to find a comfortable, safe hotel that was in the center of the action.  The hotel staff was very attentive and provided some great recommendations for sights in the area and cafes close by with outstanding tapas.  The property is located directly on Las Ramblas and only a few blocks from Plaza Catalunya (a central hub for transportation in Barcelona).  We enjoyed exploring the alley ways in the Gothic Quarter and spending time in Le Boqueria.  We did use the metro line numerous times without incident and found the maps easy to follow and the stops clearly marked.  After a full day of sightseeing, we had a late evening dinner in the hotel restaurant Cent Onze and enjoyed our Catalan inspired cuisine and a cold bottle of Cava.
While we enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien, the hotel interior did lack the “old city charm” and given the limited time we actually spend in the room we would probably opt for a less expensive hotel in the same area.",4,2013,08,05
37,Good location if you like noise poor service all around,"This hotel is one of the bad examples of a typical inner city tourist hotel without any particular charm or any service level whatsoever. Location is good, if you are looking for a spot near the main tourist attractions but rooms are constantly inundated with street and tourist noise  even late into the night. Plus, you can pretty much hear everything going on in the room next door / so terrible build and insulation quality. As a Starwood preferred guest you will not get any recognition and not assigned to any of the SPG floors. Even though you can still book higher category rooms, the staff will lie to you even in the face of evidence and claim they are fully booked and not other rooms are available and therefore no upgrades. On the weekends management is supposedly not working if you would like to talk to anybody and you only can speak to the housekeeping supervisor if you have any grievances, who is useless. Service all around the hotel is shoddy. If you are going just for the location, OK. If you expect any standards, do not even think about it. And if you are used to any standards or recognition in the SPG program as a Platinum or Gold member do not expect anything here either.",1,2013,08,03
37,Highly Reccomended,"I stayed at Le Meridien for 7 days and loved it. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and the concierge helped me booked tickets, make reservations, and suggest the city sights. My view was amazing, I had a terrace and the proximity to La Rambla made it an excellent place to stay!",5,2013,08,02
37,Poor service,"Excellent hotel in a great central location adjacent to La Rambla. We had an excellent room with a great verandah

Service however is hopeless in particular the concierge who was either absent, unhelpful or unable to help. Completely ignored the 3 emails we sent them before arriving asking them to book us a restaurant. Similar experience with the other staff.

Great pity it wood have been an excellent hotel",3,2013,08,01
37,Barcelona At It's Best,"We are bringing our European trip for 2013 to a close and as I sit in my suite at the Le Meridien Hotel I am sadly reminded of how we Americans allow life to pass us by without tasting or sampling it, in other words we have not learned how to slow down and smell the Tapes!  We will leave tomorrow on July 31st after spending three wonderful weeks (Good and Bad) in Europe.  Yet with all that has happened to us, tires being slashed hoping to burglarize us in Sitges, my 24K Gold Necklace being ripped off my neck from behind as we were coming from the Picasso Museum, It is wonderful to be here at the Le Meridien Barcelona to close out this episode of our journey.  The Meridien Barcelona is a serious Five Star Hotel!  Our Prestige Suite overlooked the Ave Ramblas and even with the crowds continuing until the wee hours of the morning it was quiet in our room.  Our package included breakfast and the young chef prepared us omelettes to our taste.  Now, here is the tricky part, if you want something from the front desk you have to be persistent!  For you see, as my Spanish Wife reminds me, this is Spain and they are laid back! But once they get the message they go all out to please you!  So for my bet it is the Le Meridien Barcelona centrally located and within walking distance to everything, Chow!",4,2013,07,30
37,Nice restaurant,"Visit this restaurant last night, friendly staff, good food and quiet inside even with many people.
Location on top of ramblas right side walking down the street. Table reservation possible, telephone: +34 93 318 62 00",4,2013,07,30
37,"Solid location, but service is horrible","Just got back after 3 nights staying here. I think my experience was fairly accurate with what others were saying. 

Location--even though its on las ramblas, it's an excellent location to walk to many major sites and areas you want to see. It's also on the northern part of las ramblas, so it's less shady.

Service--consistently bad, like everyone else said. It's funny, when we checked in at 1:30, they said our room wasn't ready, and check in time is 3:15pm. When I went back up to check at 3:10pm, they said it's still not ready. Then at 3:15pm someone approached us saying it was ready. I mean really?? Instead of trying to accomodate us--they just felt a bit of power by forcing us to stick to the check in time. Never experienced this, in terms of 5 mins making such a big difference. Also, went to catch up with the concierge twice for dinner venues--both times they weren't available and put up a sign saying that they would be right back but the front desk would be able to assist me. I approached the front desk and they said oh we can't really help with that request, but the concierge employee is on a dinner break and should be back in a half hour.

Rooms--had a horrible view, but didn't bother me much, as someone has to get stuck with it. the room itself was very nice--pretty trendy & modern.",3,2013,07,29
37,"Great location, nice modern hotel",We loved this hotel it was in a great location and was very comfortable. We stayed with Starwood points and were very pleased with our stay. The room was very modern and had plenty of toiletries. The staff was very polite and accommodating. The coffee bar in the lobby is great- definitely a cafe latte there you won't be disappointed.,4,2013,07,28
37,Great Location and Good Service,"We stayed here for 5 nights in June of 2013.  While there was a little bit of a challenge to  finding out when our room was actually going to be ready (got 3 different answers) the hotel did it's best to accommodate our family.  I felt like the management went out of their way to help us.  We got an upgraded room to s a suite so our 6 year old son could stay in the room with us with a great fold out couch.  The room was great, plenty of room, great bathrooms and a great deck to go out on.  We had dinner outside 2 nights.  We received a lot of help on tours and local information from the concierge.  I have read some of the reviews which noted that the hotel had some attitude.  I could sense that but I was persistent and was able to work through this though wouldn't say it any worse at any other high end hotels around the world.  The location is excellent.  Close to a lot of the action and very lively.  Will be back to Barcelona again as we had a great time and plan to stay here again.  Thank you to the hotel and the staff",4,2013,07,23
37,"Average hotel in an excellent, sorry AMAZIN location!!","If its your first time to Barcelona, Look no further! 
Le meridian at LA RAMBLAS has very small rooms, very average interiors, ambience, nothing really great about it, EXCEPT the AMAZINN location!!
Well the hotel management is well aware of the location.
Concierge is helpful, with not well trained staff at the reception who might well take an hour for a 3 room check-in.
Breakfast is slightly better than average with nice dining section overlooking the La Ramblas. 
Tourist information center is about a 50 yards from the hotel and gives you all information on the various & numerous tours available! 
Eating out options are uncountable with lots n lotsa options on the La Ramblas itself, just walking distance from the hotel. Cafes are also abundant. Orange sim card available at about 2-3 minutes walk from the hotel.
Sangria (made from red wine, brandy and juices) is good and sweet. But the best thing to try would be Estrella Damm Lemon Draft beer! Out of the world!!
Paella is a lot over rated! 
Rangoli an Indian restaurant, though far from here (about 12-15min by cab) is better than the ones around.
Don't miss the Gaudi (architect) tour who as per my liking is the best architect in the world!! Ammazzin work!
Hop on Hop off bus tours are available from Plaza Catalunya which is about 2-3 minutes walk from the hotel! Travel agent is available in the El Cortes Englis (one opp the Plaza Catalunya from where the Bus tour starts) in the basement for any tickets u might wanna book!
U walk down the hotel and u r in the buzz of ur holiday!",3,2013,07,22
37,Great location,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a group tour.  Great location and close to everything.  A bit pricey but then this is Barcelona.  Room was great and very clean and breakfast good.  We found the staff efficient and helpful.  As another viewer has said, there are so many hotels in this city that you can take your pick from.  I would stay here again but still a bit pricey for somewhere that you are basically just using for sleep!",5,2013,07,21
37,Excellent location,"We stayed here at this hotel for two nights before our Disney Magic cruise.  The location really can't be beat as it is right on Las Ramblas and only two blocks away from La Boqueria.  Our rooms were facing the alley and not Las Ramblas, so it was pretty quiet and we slept very well.  Although there is so much hustle and bustle late at night outside the hotel, we felt that this part of Las Ramblas was pretty safe.  The rooms were very modern and clean and the front desk staff was helpful in helping me locate a bank, making change, and overall professional and friendly.

I would definitely choose to stay here on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2013,07,19
37,Great tourist location,"I enjoyed staying here but a bit noisy because its on the main road where there are a lot tourist during the summer. Customer service was excellent. We stayed there a few days before going to Ibiza, so we basically used it for a resting spot. Good location can walk to pretty much everywhere. Excellent complementary breakfast. Beautiful  roof top deck with jacuzzi and steam room.",4,2013,07,19
37,Not helpful whatsoever,"My husband and I booked the first two nights of our honeymoon at le meridien Barcelona because we had read such positive reviews and are SPG members. We arrived after the red eye flight very early and were pretty certain our room wouldn't be ready, which it wasn't. We were told to check back around noon so we walked around the area and came back and it still wasn't ready even though people who came after us were able to check in. We were told it would be ready by 3 but when we returned at 2:45 we were told it might not be until 5:30. 5:30?!?!? And we were told this with major attitude from the front desk supervisor. Long story short, we spoke to the manager who had us in a room in 5 mins. So why were we told 5:30?! We may never know. We were treated so poorly and given so much attitude. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH A PLEASANT STAFF. We were so disappointed and the room we finally received was small and nothing special. There are tons of hotels in barca so do some research before deciding on this one.",2,2013,07,17
37,Le Meridien in Barcelona has an Attitude Problem,"When teenagers or young people have difficulties responding to their people around them, we say they have an attitude problem. So is also le Meridien on Las Ramblas in Barcelona.

I was going with two collegues to a conference and decided to stay at the same hotel as the conference. Not a good idea. Although the organizers happily announced discounted rates, it turned out that the hotel had limited the number of cheaper rooms so we ended up with expensive rooms. Le Meridien also 'forgot' to add the 10 % tax when quoting prices - an early warning that should have made us decide to stay around the corner instead.

The reservation process was cumbersome. Many emails back and forth with credit card guaranties. Normally you give your credit card data to guarantee the room, but Le Meridien charges the whole stay for all rooms in advance. Because you stay in an expensive hotel, they trust you less than other hotels.

Mistrust to the customer seems to be the mantra at Le Meridien Barcelona. At the check-in they once again try to make you pay for the whole stay. The hot water is free but internet is not except for a slow connection as if we were on the moon.

The waiters in the restaurant are not managed. They all ask you the same thing and then forget your order. The food is bland and typical for a hotel restaurant with no external customers. A 5 star hotel should have higher ambitions.

Very early on the day of your departure, you can be sure to have a cleaning lady knocking on your door, hoping to collect a tip before her colleagues. As a last example of hostility and mistrust, your doorkey is blocked at noon so that you have to go back and beg the reception to let you collect your things in the room if you check out later.

So we can add the hotel problems up to a general attitude problem. The two stars are for the excellent location but I strongly recommend finding another hotel while waiting for the management to change the hotel or for the hotel management to change...",2,2013,07,14
37,"Location, Location, Location!",If you have never been to Barcelona and want a hotel that puts you right in the center of the action- the Le Meridien is the place. Located just off the Ramblas this hotel is a perfect place from which to explore this great city! Rooms are small but nicely appointed and the breakfast buffet is awesome!,4,2013,07,13
37,Convenient location,"Located in Las Rambles, very convenient, our room is small, modern decorations, buffet breakfast is good, lots of choices, very nice street views.

We joined the hi-speed Internet plan, got disconnected several hours due to tech problems. 

We booked booked 2 massages on the arrival day, and when we arrived at the ""spa"", it doesn't look like a spa, looks like a toilet door, no reception, actually no one is there, we had to go back to the room to call the front desk, they told us the therapists are busy and asked us to wait outside. Not too professional therapists finally finished their work, we could not be angry with them as they're wearing smily faces, We asked for towels for shower, they replied, oh yes, of course, we asked for a few things before we can go to shower, don't know why they gave us one complete set of utilities at the beginning (like other spas) do.
",4,2013,07,12
37,Great Location!!,"My wife and I stayed at the is hotel the evening before a cruise and one night upon our return to Barcelona after the cruise.  Le Meridien is located on Las Ramblas in the heart of old Barcelona.  From the hotel's location, we were able to walk to most of the historic sites such as Barcelona Cathedral and Santa Maria del Mar.  It is also within walking distance thousands of restaurants and shopping.  The only disadvantage is that Las Ramblas is extremely busy until the early morning hours.  This is also a disadvantage if you have a room on the side of the hotel that faces Las Ramblas.

The rooms are a decent size, clean, and comfortable.  Hotel staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  Service at the hotel is good and timely.  Unfortunately, when we arrived at the hotel in the morning of our stay, our rooms were not available until the afternoon.  As part of our stay, we had the breakfast which I thought was excellent.  The quality of the food was top-notch and the variety of food was very good.  Overall, I feel that we received a great value for our money.  I would definitely stay at the Le Meridien Barcelona again.",4,2013,07,12
37,"Great Location, excellent hotel","We arrived early on a Saturday and our rooms weren't ready, but the staff was friendly and helpful pointing us to the market down the street to get some authentic food to eat.  The rooms were well appointed and the showers were huge.  We are starwood point users and only issue I had was that we were offered a guaranteed room ready rate of 16000 points per room.....practically what it cost to book the room....thought that was a bit much.  Great location on the main street within walking distance to many things.",5,2013,07,10
37,One night in Barcelona,"Stayed one night in Barcelona at the Le Meridian after a 9 day Cruise.  We didn't want to jump back on an airplane right after coming off our cruise, which disembarked in Barcelona, so we stayed an extra day/night in Barcelona.  Hotel was very nice, quiet (room facing back side), and conveniently located to a festive La Rambla street and serveral sites.  We walked to several sites, including the Picasso museum (5-10 mins away), plus walked all the way to the beach (about 1 - 1.5 miles straight down La Rambla, then along the waterfront).   Lots of options for food, shopping are just out the front door. The modern contemporary art museum is supposed to be very nearby also, but we didn't have time left to go see that.  Rooms were good size, very clean and we had a very nice rain shower in our bathroom.  the concierge were very helpful, and provide a nice city map to help you get started.   We got to the hotel early at 10 AM, since our ship docked early and wanted everyone off quickly to prep for the next cruise, so we were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3PM - no problem we checked our bags with guest services, had some Capuccino's and OJ in the lobby café (very good barista), mapped out a few things we wanted to see, and headed out the door.   we came back a little early, around 2:30PM and were told our room was ready - we were ready for a rest after walking all day.  After a quick shower/nap, we head back out to find the waterfront/beach and dinner.  All in all, a great experience for one day/night in Barcelona.

We had lunch at a restaurant across the lobby from the hotel, Luzia, which has good European style food in contemporary setting - my wife really liked the Capresse salad served on pizza bread, and I liked the pasta - I saw other people order Burgers/Fries and big salads. There are also several other options right next door, including places for Tapa's and traditional Spanish foods.  We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but I did have a Sangria in the Bar, which was very nice.

Suggestions for taking taxi's - we got taken for an extra ride from our Taxi cab driver, from the cruise ship dock to the hotel- it should be a very short straight shot from the cruise ship's dock to the hotel, but since we didn't know the area at the time, our driver took us on the scenic tour that probably cost an extra 10 Euro's - this is always a challenge in a foreign city.  The only chance you may have is to ask ahead of time what the approximate distance/cost would be from a local person before getting the taxi - then see if this jives with what the cabbie says when you ask him/her the same question before getting into the cab.  Anyways, after we walked around our hotel, we figured out how close we were to the cruise ship's docks.",4,2013,07,10
37,"Good hotel, close to tourist attractions, small rooms","The hotel is located close to La Rambla, so expect lots of tourists and crowds.  It’s walking distance to Plaça Catalunya and other popular attractions.  If you’re looking for a calmer place, this is not the place for you.

The rooms are small, but my bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious.  Room service was quick, as was the check-in process for SPG.

Ate at the lobby bar a few times.  It had delicious sandwiches and very friendly service.

Some of the staff is friendly, others are courteous but cold.  Concierge was very helpful and insightful.",4,2013,07,10
37,Great location. Great service,Even thought the hotel is on La Rambla my room was always quiet. The Baristas are great tour guides. The hotel staff was very accommodating to people who speak very little Spanish and helped with my brother(who's name wasn't on the reservation) to get a shower on arrival ahead of me. He was able to go to the spa and check in. The rooms are very clean and modern. Would recommend anyone stay here. Book the hotel with breakfast included. It's delishious.,5,2013,07,08
37,"Great Hotel, Well Maintained","When we arrived, 3 hours before check in, we received a warm welcome and a choice of checking in immediately! Surprised and grateful we took a room facing the la Ramble even though we had read it was too noisy to rest. We loved the view and the noise even on a national holiday night was not a problem.",5,2013,07,06
37,Great location and friendly staff !,The location of the hotel is fantastic. The service is also good the staff is really friendly and helpful. The breakfast is also good it is not a big spread but it's ok. The rooms are big in size and very clean but the only problem is the bathroom door as it does not have a lock and is translucent so people can look through the door. The extra beds are extremely uncomfortable and hard ! ,4,2013,07,05
37,Fantastic location and good hotel,"Hotel is on the corner of La Rambla which is a perfect location.  The buzz of people walking and the different stalls make this walkway an abundance of fun, colour and conversation.  There are several bars and restaurants within waling distance and the architecture is just awesome.  At the bottom of La Rambla about 20 minutes walk from the hotel there's the spectacular beach!  Other than not getting an upgrade (which normally Platinum do) it was a good hotel.",4,2013,07,05
37,"Mark & Adrian from Florida Say Great Hotel, Great Location, Great City!!!","From the time of our arrival we were consistently impressed by the hotel. Our room was 544 which had a large wrap around terrace which was well situated on the side of the hotel not over the lively La Ramblas. The spacious room was excellently appointed and comfortably furnished. 
The bathroom was extremely large as was the shower. The hair dryer was great and the electrical outlets were abundant including the bathroom. The hotel location was perfect. The concierge desk was staffed by two people at all times and their assistance and suggestions were outstanding! The breakfast buffet was a great way to start the day. We looked forward to being greeted by Rebeca each morning at breakfast, you can count on Xavi to make a great omelet to order, and Mar was very attentive and pleasant serving our coffee and tea.",5,2013,07,04
37,Avoid,"Where do I start?  With the bait and switch at the front desk whereby the 2nd and 3rd nights were $100 more than quoted?  And when is the last time you paid close to $500/night for a room with no internet/wireless connection? Then there is the fruit lady who randomly comes in and stands there.    And the trainee at the front dest with only a marginal grasp of English and Spanish, either of which I was perfectly willing to speak.  The best is the woman who suggested I come to the (very loud, very crowded) bar to Skype with my 4 year old and husband since I had no Internet.  Bottom line, it's a very central, very convenient location where you will be treated poorly.",1,2013,07,03
37,Excellent hotel location,"Situated on Las Ramblas, the hotel is walking distance to almost everything. Close to the La Boqueria, Gothic area and Cathedral. Taxi ride from the airport costs about 28 euros. Don't pay for airport transfers which the hotel offers for 75 euros. Take the hop on/off bus that will take you to the must see places in Barcelona.
Our concierge Christian was very helpful. He helped me booked some of my tours and recommended good places to eat.
The hotel restaurant offers a 3 course meal including wine during week days for 20 euros which they don't advertised if you are a walk-in. I had the best paella there.
The hotel is close to the port . It cost about 30 euros for a taxi cab ride if you are embarking on a cruise.
The room seems standard for the category. The bathroom is modern but the shower faucet is difficult to regulate. It is either too hot or too cold.
Due to the hotel accessibilty to most places, we had time to take naps in the afternoon and resume the tour later on.",5,2013,07,03
37,Good Location and efficient service,The hotel was situated at the famous La Ramblas off the Catanula Square. I was visiting the city on June 23 n 24 after a cruise finished in Barcelona. The hotel is in excellent location with many interesting activities around. Closed to the marina bay with new shopping centre. Breakfast was really good with a lot of choices. Will certainly stay again when in Barcelona again.,4,2013,07,02
37,"Great location, fantastic staff","We stayed here for one night before a cruise out of Barcelona.  Prior to our arrival, we contacted the hotel to see if we could enter early since we would arrive from the US at 9am. For $150 they could accommodate us and provide breakfast.  We decided to take our chances by not paying and like many others upon arrival from the US, were told that our room was not ready.  We walked along La Rambla and had lunch. They called at 1pm to tell us the room was ready. Despite the unavailable room, we had a lovely time with help from the staff.   I took many photos of he bathroom with hopes of using some ideas for my own bathroom remodel!  Room was comfortable and had every amenity I could ever want.  I highly recommend this property if you want to be close to everything touristy in Barcelona. ",5,2013,07,01
37,Honeymoon!,"Location: Perfect. Right on La Ramblas. Close to gothic district, shopping, and even a 30min walk to the beach.

Service: Front desk speaks great english, very helpful.

Rooms: Reserved a Junior Suite for about 4 days. After notifying management it was our honeymoon upon reservation (3 months prior to the date) we received complimentary cava and chocolate covered strawberries in the room and they put us in a Junior Suite that was the corner room overlooking La Ramblas. Absolutely beautiful. Pictures will be uploaded. Also paid for flowers to be put in the room and bathroom. Housekeeping arranged the flowers into a heart. Rooms very spacious, bathroom modern, clean and large. Heated floors, and towel rack and rainfall shower.
Only room complaint was that another guest complained we were to loud at night. However we were just talking to each other near the wall...my guess is that the walls could be thicker because then in the morning i heard them speaking very loudly on the phone. Non-issue for us but obviously for those guests it was.

Hotel has security in front, a nice bar and restaurant. Only downside is no pool, if it had that it would be unreal!!",5,2013,06,30
37,Great property in perfect location,"Location is extremely convenient and central (both metro and walk)... and quiet. Room (Suite Méditerranéenne) was beautiful, large, clean with a nice terrace and great amenities. I loved the design of the bathroom and bed is great. Staff was really nice and professional.
A beautiful stay in Barcelona in a perfect hotel.",5,2013,06,26
37,Great hotel - will return!!,"What a great hotel! The service was friendly and helpful! The room was massive, and the breakfast was of average size but superlative quality - I couldn't get enough of it! But by far the best thing about this hotel is the location - right on La Rambla. Through a tie-up with the Barcelona Contemporary Art Museum MACBA we were offered free entry, which we took advantage of and really enjoyed. All in all, we loved this place, and want to return!!!",5,2013,06,24
37,"Fantastic location, but....small rooms-- friendly, but ...average service","We love the location of this property, but find the rooms small.  The desk, valet and doormen were very friendly and helpful.  There was a younger gentelman (possibly a mgr in training) that was very attentive and hopefully pursues a career in hospitality mgt.  The female concierge was knowledgeable (getting her keys soon), helpful & personable--I wish she was there more often during our stay.  Unfortunatly, the property is loosing her...Hopefully she is transfering to another Starwood property, as she is a gem!   Yes, we are Starwood platinum.   The gentelmen concierges were friendly, but had their few standard restaurants withing a 10 min. radius and directions to the ""typical attractions"" and thats it.   A concierge  should try and make each guests experience unique by taking into account what the guest is seeking.  If they dont understand what is being requesting ask questions, instead  or moving the guest along with any answer.  We were at the hotel 3 years ago and sent to the same 3-4 restaurants again this trip.  We requested recomendations for good food & late night dining (9:30ish).  We did not have location or cuisine restrictions, and were open to local, fine dining and or trendy establishments. So to get the same recomendations 3 years later was disapointing.  San Joan day was celebrated during our stay, and there was no information on the events until that afternoon.  We would have prefered information about the celebration upon check in, as we could have planned better for the evening.  As for the room.... If you pack more than 1 small carry on bag per person you will find the room crowded.  we were upgraded- thank you...but, it was almost impossible, or very difficult for my husband and I to move around the room at the same time (2 pieces of large luggage and 2 totes bags).  the foot of the bed is about 2 1/2"" from the wall, so if you pack light you'll be comfortable.  Housekeeping was attentive with the exception of the grout around the bathtub...it could use some attention, but in their defense they are not provided with a great deal of time to thoroughly clean each room during high season.   ",3,2013,06,24
37,good small conference venue as well,"i recently spent four days here - 3 as part of a conference for 35 people.
The hotel could not have a better location. Most rooms face a quiet(ish) side road, but breakfast/dining faces onto La Ramblas.
Smart, clean , nice standard sized but well appointed rooms, good breakfast, and a comfortable and stylish conference room. very good.
A few niggles stop me giving this 5 stars.
1.We had to lift heavy suitcases up four steps to the entrance - watched by staff! - why no ramp (there is to the lifts inside.
2.Delays at reception (which doubles as concierge most of the time) due to lost booking, and later when the key wiped itself and was replaced by one which didnt work- each taking 5-10 mins queing.
3. Although the tea cups were washed, and the milk refilled each day, you only seem to get one allowance of tea and coffee - which wasn't topped up.
But smart, comfortable and brilliantly located.",4,2013,06,24
37,"Great Location, Great Staff, but wanted more.","We traveled to Spain for our 10 year anniversary and booked the trip on points. 

Upon arrival, the staff was very busy and the hotel manager was off site. We were supposed to be upgraded but they could not accommodate us. We were put in a basic room. The rooms are clean but tight. Next time I'll be sure to book a suite. 

Our room was right over La Ramblas which has its pluses and minuses. It's over the busiest street in Barcelona great people watching and noisy at the same time. The biggest plus for this hotel is the location. Down the street from the fresh market, across from the old city, down the street from the best shopping in town and a quick ride to the beach. Everything further is a quick subway ride (station just outside the hotel). 

The staff helped us with a typing we needed, Internet connectivity, reservations, etc.. But they seemed so busy that it was tough for them to give us the full attention we wanted. It wasnt until our last day did the hotel manager call us. He invited us for coffee in the lobby and sent us off with a very thoughtful parting gift which made up for the minor inconveniences we had. 

He also took the time to draw up a personal walking tour for us to explore some less known corners of town which was great because we thought we saw it all. Being in the center of the city made it easy to get everywhere in minutes. 

I would also like to compliment the concierge. They had a great knowledge base of the city and they were able to send us on our way each day and evening based on what we were in the mood for. In all of my travels, I have not met a better concierge staff. They asked a few questions about what we liked to do before opening a map and pointing at a street or square. They adjusted their suggestions based on our answers. They were spot on in pointing us in the right direction. 

Overall, a great hotel in the perfect location with a wonderful staff. 
Can't it to go back (and get a bigger room).",4,2013,06,23
37,This has to be one of our favorite hotels ever,"For the price, the room was perfect. Location was perfect. It had everything we needed; and American plug in, a spacious bathroom, amazingly new, big, flat screen TVs, a huge bed, turn down service, a bathroom scale even! The shower was nice, the breakfast was awesome. It's a beautiful hotel, newly redone, an outdoor deck on the 6th floor. When we go back to Barcelona I'd never stay anywhere else but here. I can't say enough good things about our stay here. ",5,2013,06,23
37,"Location, Location, Location!","We recently stayed here as part of a Tauck Tour of Spain.  As noted in other reviews, the Le Meridien is in the perfect location for seeing many things:  Las Ramblas, Placa Cataluyna, La Boqueria are all within a 5 minute walk.  The waterfront and the Columbus monument are within a 15 minute walk.  Although small, our room was very quiet and well appointed.  The rain shower was fantastic.  The bed was very comfortable.  My husband loved the trouser presser and thought it was a wonderful perk.  Our breakfast and dinner in the restaurant was quite enjoyable.  The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful.  Although we were told that our room would be ready much earlier than it actually was, we had a delightful stay at this hotel.",5,2013,06,22
37,Great choice in Barcelona,"We chose this hotel because it was a Starwood property and for the location adjacent to Las Ramblas, and were not disappointed. We have stayed at a number of Le Meridien's in Europe and have never had a bad experience.  The hotel is on a side street just off the bustling Ramblas, yet it is very quiet and calm. Our preference is always for an American style hotel with the amenities that go along with that as well as the American style breakfasts, all of which are present here. Our room faced an interior courtyard and was very quiet.  The breakfast is served in a restaurant facing the Ramblas and offers great people watching outside the large windows. Our room, the service and the breakfast were all first rate, as was the sense of security in the hotel. We enjoyed it so much we put our young daughter traveling solo up in the hotel a few weeks after we were there and her experience was the same. Should we return to Barcelona we would assuredly stay here again!",5,2013,06,22
37,"Excellent service, property, and location.","I've been to Barcelona three or four times but this was the best hotel I've stayed in while in that beautiful city by far. Check in was very gracious and several ""freebies"" were presented. The room was modern and comfortable with excellent climate controls and entertainment. The Internet was a bit slow if pressed to complain about anything. I did not use the restaurant but did have a drink at the bar which was fairly empty.

The location cannot be beat as you are right on Le Ramblas. The market is a few minutes away and while the nearby restaurants are touristy, I did have a business meeting with a native who managed to find a nearby restaurant that was serving the locals.

I'm looking forward to returning soon. Highly recommended.",5,2013,06,21
37,Beware of the Scam and overcharge,"I am a SPG Gold member and have stay in starwood hotels because I thought it meant their standards and trust was reliable when travel out side the country. Not the case for the Le Meridien in Barcelona.  I was on vacation with my family and booked a Junior Suite with starpoints for two nights. The amount of starpoint was high and for a 5 star hotel rate. When I arrived they informed me I would need to pay 120 euros per night to a larger room due to 4 people and it as illegal for 4 in a room.  I would also be charged 80 EURO per night per person. I had no choice but to agree and accept the charge. I then watched them do the same to the next four people checking in and telling them they would have to upgrade for other reasons. One was a newly married couple who they told them they only had rooms with single beds and to get a King bed it would cost them 80 EUROS per night. When I got to the room it was the same room I originally booked  and they just pulled out the couch . It was not a standard pull out and was just the extending the cushions to make a bed. It was so hard we all ended up sleeping in the two twin beds with may children . 

After all that I arrive home to look at my credit card bill and I had received an second bill for 165 Euros in addition to my check out bill . When I called the hotel they told me this happens a lot and is an error in their room deposit when I checked in. They said they were not allowed to correct it by phone due to security reasons and I would have to email them the details.",1,2013,06,20
37,Great property!,"Was at this hotel for two nights for business. It is located in a fantastic location and the hotel staff were superb. I was upgraded to a large suite and the welcome espresso was a nice touch, especially after my red eye flight! I managed to get some sun in the spa area and the concierge recommended this fantastic tapas bar which was one of the highlights!

I would definitely return next time in am in BCN ",4,2013,06,18
37,Not a real 5-Star,"For location, its hard to beat: ten seconds out of the door and you are on the vibrant La Ramblas--where everything is happening! Check-in was quick and the reception staff were very pleasant. I actually later found one of the staff even better informed than the concierge when we were looking for directions to La Roca Village--an outlet mall some 40 minutes out of Barcelona by bus! 

My wife and I stayed on the 2nd floor--a Starwood Preferred Guest Floor. Contrary to our expectation, our room was probably the quitest place on earth--considering it was only a few meters from the noisy Ramblas. 

As for the room itself: this is where we rate the hotel 4 rather than the 5-Star it claims to be. The room is on the smaller side; with no place to place your luggage. Luckily we only had one suitcase which ended up on the floor--further limiting the minimal floor space available. The built-in trouser press and iron board is absolutely ridiculous; you pull it out of the closet and it is totally unusable for lack of space.  We stayed for 6 nights and we found the house-keeping service very inconsistent: no drinking water one day; no tissues the next; no toiletries, etc. On the positive side:

Very quiet room. The bed is super comfortable with fluffy pillows and cuddly comforters. I loved the lighting: lights everywhere for grooming, reading, etc. The one I liked best is the dim blue LED lights came on as soon as you stepped off either side of the bed in the middle of the night. Your legs trigger the sensor hidden under the night stand (yes, I looked for it) to light your way to the bathroom. I thought that was very simple and clever, especially for such a small room! Room smelled fresh every time we walked in--I am asthmatic and hence very sensitive to smelly carpets and drapes. The bathroom is modern, and the rain shower is heavenly!

Breakfast very simple but adequate European and the staff very attentive. The restaurant-cum bar becomes alive at night. 

Overall: a good place to stay with good value for your dollar.",4,2013,06,15
37,Perfect Location for First-Timers!!,"I stayed in a Jr. Suite with some girlfriends in April. This was our first time in Barcelona, and the hotel's location was absolutely perfect for us! I was a little hesitant at first to be staying right on Las Ramblas, since I tend to avoid ""tourist traps,"" but I'm so glad we did! Located on the upper end of Las Ramblas, it was very close walking distance to La Boqueria, as well as many of the Gaudi sites and great restaurants and bars in Eixample. I could understand why many travelers who frequently visit Barcelona may prefer to stay in Eixample or other areas, but again, this was the perfect home base to explore the city. 

The Jr. Suite was quite spacious and comfortably fit four adults. The room was very clean with modern decor, and the bathroom was quite spacious. The only minor complaint is that the shower door did not shut all the way, and so the floor would get quite wet. Housekeeping was fantastic, and the entire staff was very friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the small cafe stand in the lobby, which serves illy coffee and pastries. I didn't visit the spa, but my friend did, and she said that she had an incredible massage. There is no pool, but there is a hot tub on an open deck, but it was not heated when we were there. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this hotel to all of my friends and family!",5,2013,06,14
37,Great Hotel and Location,"This is a Starwood property which is key for my business travel.  I found the hotel excellent and in a great location.  La Rambla.  Very convenient to the waterfront, World Trade Center, and near the large open food market.  The staff invited me (and others) to a lunchtime reception/ Paella cooking class which was a unique experience and lovely gesture.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful - even helping to remove the handle on my suitcase after it had been broken by the airline.",5,2013,06,14
37,Terrific location and average room,"We stayed here on a Tauck Tour of Spain at the end of May and the hotel location was great.  The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Our room included the breakfast buffet which was average fare that can be found at most of the hotels we stayed at.  The breakfast food was very fresh but quite expensive if we were guests staying there and not on a tour.  

The reason that I gave only 3 stars is because our room was very dingy and disappointing and had an awful view.  We were lucky though since being near Las Ramblas, it could have been very noisy.  If you are a Starwood Platinum Guest you would most likely do much better getting a nicer room and it would be worth staying there since the staff was wonderful and it was very clean.",3,2013,06,13
37,Very Nice Hotel,"This hotel was really very nice.  The room was great, not overly large, but really sufficient, with enough amenities.  We did not have the hotel breakfast, as that was pretty pricey, but the hotel is two blocks from the Boqueria market, and we ate there.  That was fun.  The location is excellent.  There is a dedicated concierge - not just the desk clerk.  They were reasonably good, though like other big city hotel concierges, they didn't really understand what kind of restaurants we were looking for.  I think we would go back to this hotel, next time we're in Barcelona.",4,2013,06,11
37,A relaxed long weekend,"I've been to Barcelona before, so I knew where I wanted stay. Therefore, the fantastic location of this hotel wasn't a surprise - it's literally on Las Ramblas and about 50m from Plaza de Catlunya.

I never ate in the hotel, though I did have a coffee (free because I didn't ask for fresh towels every day! -  I saved the environment ant a few euros!) in the lobby cafe - it was pleasant enough.

The room was exceptionally comfortable and cleaned to a very high standard daily.

My only downer was that as Scuba Diver I asked the concierge about diving opportunities around Barcelona and was told that the only place you could dive was the city's aquarium. In fact, there are a number of city based dive companies who will pick you up at your hotel and drive you 40 minutes up the coast for some quality diving.

In short, I'd go back.",5,2013,06,11
37,"Location, amenities etc cast into shade by wondrous BEDs!","My wife and I stayed at Le Meridien during a business trip in late May. The location was ideal for a combination of work and tourism, and the quality of hotel was dictated by corporate preferences rather than personal.
Having said that, as a comfortable base for touring the city and for getting to meetings around town, it worked very well indeed. Many of these hotels simply fade into the background, and on many counts the Meridien did too. It had the requisite bar and breakfast room, the courteous staff, the full range of services, as so many other do.
But where it excelled beyond expectations was in the single most important thing a hotel can do for you - let you sleep, and sleep well! Our room overlooked the Ramblas, so we were concerned about noise. But in the event there was nary a peep through the double-glazed windows. And the bed itself was a thing of beauty: I'm no expert in what an ideal bed should be, how soft or hard, but the ones in the Meridien were perfect. And you can't ask for more than a good night's rest after a hard day's work!
One small observation was that the pool wasn't really a pool at all, more a plunge box, so don't go expecting to get your daily laps....",4,2013,06,10
37,Excellent location,"We loved our stay at Le Meridien.  Right on las Ramblas, could walk them up and down from there, so close to the Mercat de la Boqueria, restaurants, could walk up to Casa Batllo, and La Pedrera, down to the coast.  Or you could walk to Plaza Catalunya and take a double decker tour from there. Breakfast was outstanding, so was service.  
Staff were great to my kids.  We arrived in the morning, before our rooms were ready.  My teenage son had a fever and was feeling very ill.  They let him go inside a party area that they were getting ready for an event later that night and let him sleep in one of the couches, away from the busy hotel lobby.  We actually left him there and picked him up a couple hours later. 
Would highly recommend it.",5,2013,06,09
37,"Excellent location, excellent concierge","For the second time this year we stayed at the Meridien. Rooms are either small and we missed a bath but  there's a large rain shower and the bed is very convenient .
Two years ago we received a large room with view on the street. Despite our Gold status we didn't receive any recognition, no extra drink, no Wifi or extra points.
In february the room wasn't clean, in june the fitting was O.K.
Breakfast is extensive and very good.
The concierge is really excellent, all the time: very efficient and compliant.
We really enjoy to stay in the Meridien but we miss some details for the price we have to pay.
The location is the top but we miss a feeling of hospitality.",3,2013,06,09
37,Best hotel in La Rambla area,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at Le Meridien and were upgraded to a corner suite with a wrap around furnished terrace. I had used Starwood points for this reservation. A full breakfast buffet was offered to us for 18  Euros per  person a day--which is definitely worthwhile. 
The hotel and concierge staff were helpful and pleasant.  Our remodeled room with a large bathroom and comfortable bed was great
As a top contributor to Trip Advisor--I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona.",5,2013,06,08
37,"Great place, but front desk can lift their game","An altogether great hotel, perfectly located on la Rambla. Especially liked the rooms - up to date with very good bed and furniture, and absolutely loved the huge rainforest shower!

Also big kudos to the concierge, very good (especially the restaurant recommendations)

Front desk with more varied performance though. Simple things like where and how to get to breakfast should be mandatory to get right. 

Will still be returning though :-)",5,2013,06,04
37,"Great Location, great stay",Stayed for 3 nights in May 2013. It was a good experience. The staff were helpful. We booked several dinners and they suggested alternates when something was not available. The rooms were good size considering the location is very premium. The location is right on La Rambla so very convenient. Overall a great stay.,4,2013,06,03
37,An Excellent Hotel on the Barcelona La Rambla Street,"We arrived at the Barcelona Airport the Tourist Office told us that a taxi would cost about 30 Euros from the Airport to the hotel.
We exited the airport to the Taxi Area.  There were no shortages of cabs.  The La Rambla is a large street with a large walkway in the center of the street with has many stands that sell food, clothes and souvenirs.  There are two lanes of traffic in each direction on both sides of the walkway.  There are several lights along the street to slow the traffic for the pedestrians.  There are no places to make a u-turn on the street for about a mile.  The meter on the cab was about 22 Euros and the driver adjusted the meter to 36 Euros.  The fare adjustment may have been for the cost of luggage and a weekend fare.
A cab from the airport is the most direct way to reach the hotel.  There is an airport bus that cost a few Euros a person that stop a half mile from the hotel.  This is not a good option with luggage.
The hotel entrance is on a side street off the La Rambla.  The hotel number can be seen on La Rambla in front of the hotel’s restaurant.  Just about the restaurant the hotel name is on a sign that is easy to miss.
The front desk clerk was excellent checking us into the hotel.  
The room has a long hallway before reaching the bedroom area.  There is a closet with plenty of shelving for storage of clothing.  The bathroom is enclosed in glassed and tiled.  There is no tub.  There is a large enclosed shower.  There is a work table with two medium size drawers.  The table top has limited space because of the large telephone and desk lamps.  There is a medium size cabinet that stores a refrigerator and a small storage area.
The bedding was very comfortable.  There are two end tables without any drawers.  The end tables have one small shelf.  
The Wi-Fi in the room and the public areas was very good.
The hotel buffet was very good with outstanding service.
The Concierge Staff was outstanding.
This is an excellent hotel in the center of the city.",5,2013,05,30
37,Very comfy bed and great manger,"This is our second stay at this hotel, we stayed here one night before our cruise and we had some issues at check in but the manger suergio fixed it all and gave us an amazing room ( and a few bottles of delicious champagne  and some chocolate for the issues.) We had a beautiful view of the city and a little of the ocean too. The room was very spacious and the beds were wonderful. The staff is very attentive and they mostly all speak English. They serve breakfast in the morning downstairs which is pretty delicious and overall the hotel is a wonderful place to stay while in Barcelona. Very good service great staff delicious food and a clean room you can't ask for more. Also the hotel is in the middle of we're all the actions happens its the perfect spot.",5,2013,05,29
37,Excellent location,"Great base right at ramblas, yet tucked in a small corner with some privacy. Easy walk to train stations and also near to hypermarket. Great stop to grab food and drinks before you head out. Very clean and comfortable rooms. ",5,2013,05,28
37,4 star hotel- 5 star location !,"Only stayed here for one night , but the location was brilliant. It is right in the centre of everything . 
We had a suite which was OK but a bit dingy and had a slightly 'eighties"" vibe with red leather chairs and black carpet ! but the bed was very comfy and the shower was really good.

Everyone on reception was very helpful , there is a nice bar and spa too and free wifi . 
The hotel is supposed to be 5 stars but i would say it is nearer to 4 . 
A good choice for visiting Barcelona, I would say its a safe bet staying here, ie it's good but it's nothing spectacular.",4,2013,05,27
37,Excellent Location,"As others have said, the location is terrific--right in the center of where you'd want to be if you are touring Barcelona.   I think the location gives it a bit of a ""bump"" in the ratings; overall, found this to be a very good hotel but service was a bit inconsistent.

I arrive for a 3-night stay around 4pm and my room was not ready.   After about 10 minutes I was told they were searching for an upgrade for me, and the front desk attendant said he'd have to check with the manager.   He came back after a few more minutes and was told that he could not upgrade my room, but now my room was ready--I truly feel like they were stalling as housekeeping got the room ready.  

I had reserved (and received) a room facing Las Ramblas, although if I had to do it again probably not worth the extra Euros and while the soundproofing is very good, can be a bit noisy at times.   Ended up with a room on the 1st floor (despite being SPG Gold), which was disappointing.   Unless you really want to stare at people walking back and forth, really no reason for the Las Ramblas room and probably quieter with other rooms.   Room was nice, as others have said very nice bathroom, good closet space and desk.   Bed was okay, comfortable but mattress ws a little ""thin""--not as ""fluffy"" as in most 4 or 5 star hotels these days.    

The first morning my alarm went off at 6am, which was very frustrating as I didn't set the alarm.   I mentioned it to the front desk and they said housekeeping is supposed to check (the alarm likely had been set by the prior guest) and didn't seem all that concerned about the unexpected 6am start to the day.   Not sure what they could have done, but really felt like they didn't care at all (same front desk attendant that checked me in....not my favorite employee at the hotel).  I think it's likely that housekeeping was rushed to get my room done (as I was being stalled at the front desk) and forgot to check to make sure the alarm wasn't set.

The rest of the stay was very good.   I had several meals at the restaturant and was very pleased both with the quality of food and excellent service.   The concierge service was a bit inconsistent--the first concierge wasn't all that helpful, but a different one on the next day was very helpful and offerred to book a ticket to La Familia to avoid the very long lines.

All in all a very good stay after the check-in and first morning issues.  Given the location, I would very likely return when next in Barcelona.",4,2013,05,26
37,Le Meridien,"Very nice hotel because of its close location by the Ramblas. Rooms are small but well maintained and comfortable. The softest bed ever ( lie  down and sink almost to the floor, we had staff put a bed board in ours to make a little firmer) .Very nice and adequate.",4,2013,05,26
37,Not a 5 star Hotel,We stayed 2 nights at Le Meredien in a Suite. No bathroom in the master bedroom but rather right next to the entrance to the room instead. Turning the facet in the bathroom sink would also turn the shower water on. A minor issue but not what you expect from a 5 star hotel and price. Very friendly and helpful staff and excellent concierge service except not available during lunch time. Breakfast buffet was very good.,4,2013,05,25
37,Excellent place to stay,"This hotel is conveniently located at the very centre of Barcelona, just cross the street and you are already at La Rambla, the crowd won't be a problem because once inside the room, you won't hear any noise, the rest is guaranteed.
The rooms are clean an comfortable with different amenities, the service is good at the reception and also at the rooms... The only negative vote would be for the price; it's an expensive hotel, but this is a Meridien hotel, what were you expecting?
The rooms don't have an excellent view but at least in this case I didn't care, maybe the last floor where I never went is better, but I ignore it
Unfortunately didn't have time to try the pool, but the bar was also good at night!",5,2013,05,24
37,Excellent location,"My husband and I spent 5 days here in May. The location was perfect for us, central to all of our needs. Room wasn't quite ready, when we arrived but we were offered the choice of having a free coffee or, if we wanted to do some sight seeing we could leave our phone number and the concierge would ring us when the room was ready. We chose the former and after about an hour were shown to our Starwood Preferred Guest room on the 5th floor. The room was at the back of thr hotel which meant that ,although the view was not great, it was very quiet. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a rain shower but no bath. The king size bed was comfortable but VERY LOW!!
Breakfast was good with a wide choice wand it was lovely to eat looking out at the crowds going up and down the Ramblas.
Staff were all very friendly and helpful.
Complementary water in our room was very useful.
There didn't appear to be a turndown service in the evening.
We enjoyed our stay, especially the location.",4,2013,05,22
37,Great location and rooms,"We made last minute arrangements to go to Barcelona and stayed here because it was Starwood.  We were lucky because this place is in a great spot to visit Barcelona.  Entrance is just steps off of the La Rambla and in easy walking distance to a lot of the tourist sights.  Front desk is helpful, breakfast was fine.  We were a family of fine split in two rooms and they accommodated us nicely.  Would not hesitate to stay again here.",5,2013,05,18
37,Excellent Location - Large Rooms,"This is our second time staying at this hotel while visiting Barcelona.

If you are visiting Barcelona as a tourist I think you would be hard pressed to find a better location. The metro stop is a short ten minute walk away and th famous La Rambla
is just footsteps away.

The hotel has undergone a change in decor and now sports a modernistic look and feel.  

As with our prior visit we found the rooms to be large (even by US standards). Our bedroom and seating areas both featured new LG big screen tv's. The king size bed was very comfortable.

The complimentary ""low speed"" wifi was fine for casual browsing and for checking e-mail I don't think you need to upgrade to the higher speed option. The breakfast buffet was basic but well stocked and the wait staff friendly and efficient.

The business center is set up for remote printing which can be very convenient.

You'll pay a premium for any hotel located on or near La Rambla.  In the case of Le Meridien it's money we'll spent.",5,2013,05,18
37,Happy with the hotel but benefited from a low corporate rate.  Great staff.,"Good location right on the pedestrianised Ramblas; I'd say great, except that it was a slightly longer walk to the metro (5-10 min), but I'll acknowledge that I am being very pernickety in this regard!

My room was south-facing onto a side street that seemed to be a staging area for taxis and sanitation trucks so it was noisy late and early.  I found the lighting controls a little bewildering (for example, I couldn't figure out how to turn all the room lights off without having to walk across a dark room to the bed) but maybe I'm just getting old.  I did not have any problems with noise coming from within the hotel.  I am a light sleeper at times so this was a relief.

I thought Tonke at the front desk was especially lovely.  I had had a long journey to get there and didn't have my Starwood membership number at check-in.  She looked it up for me (without making me wait) so that I could get credit for the stay.  I know that doesn't sound like a big deal but not making me wait was just a nice touch.  The guest-facing staff were fluent in English.

All in all, this is a nice hotel.  I've rated it as average because I think I'd be a little underwhelmed if I had had to pay €400/night but for my company's corporate rate (about half of that) it was very good value.",3,2013,05,17
37,"Comfort, Service & Location","Way more Pros than Cons! This was our first stay in a Le Meridien property, and we didn't do much research on it before booking. We really only expected a decently comfortable hotel with mild noise issues. However, to our surprise we slept soundly each night and weren't disturbed by noise at all. The room itself was also larger than we had hoped, the service was great, and you really can't beat the location. Here's our summary:

PROS:
• Location...right off of Las Ramblas...the entrance isn't facing Las Ramblas but is a stone's throw away from it on a side street [which is probably why we were able to sleep so well despite the late night Las Ramblas activity]...it's also very close to a Metro station
• Very clean room and public areas...and the room was large by European standards
• Modern decor with a rain shower and amenities that include a bathrobe and scale [not that you'd want to step on it if you're eating Paellas every night]
• Service...very helpful and knowledgable staff...Vera in particular gave great dining recommendations
• Concierge...incredibly helpful in assisting us with ticket purchases [for Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera] and printing our boarding passes
• Lobby lounge/bar/cafe...on the smaller side but done up very well, with a good menu of snacks, smaller meals, and drinks including Illy coffee...a nice place to relax between sights
• Windows that actually open for fresh air
• Noticeably plush carpeting in the room...made a big difference after walking all day!
• Additional smaller TV in the bathroom and lots of storage space for toiletries
• Multi-functional closet area...nicely sized with a bench near the door AND ample shelving...very convenient for packing/unpacking and lots of room for everything

CONS:
• Hi-speed Wifi is not free
• There is a restaurant attached to the property called Centonze, but you can't order food and take it up to your room, you have to order via room service
• Hotel transfer to/from the airport is quite expensive...better to just use a taxi [very easy to find at the airport...just follow the signs that guide you to the taxi area]",5,2013,05,16
37,Perfect location!,"My husband and I vacationed in Barcelona recently and stayed at Le Meridien.  We couldn't have had a better located hotel.  We were close to several attractions within walking, as well as several several bus tour stops.  The room itself was very reasonable in size and the staff super friendly.  Breakfast was also included in our stay, which was very nice.  Shopping, restaurants, and cafes were right outside the front door.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,05,16
37,"Standard top tier hotel, with one big annoyance.","It was a beautiful hotel, as it should be for the price paid. The rooms were very nice and bed was extremely comfortable. 

the concierge was helpful but seemed to have a bit of an attitude. 

The biggest gripe I have with this place is that they try to charge 35 euros per person for what is just a very basic continental breakfast. That is ridiculous. I went down the street and got my girlfriend and I a beautiful breakfast for 20 euros total. Perhaps most of the clientele are very rich and don't care one way or another, but I certainly am not going to get ripped off like that when the hotel is surrounded by so many great places to eat. The hotel is nice but their breakfast scam stands out in my mind.",3,2013,05,16
37,"Great location, good service, small rooms","You really can't beat the location if you're visiting Barcelona as a tourist.  It is centrally located, walkable to a lot of museums and attractions, with convenient access to public transportation.  The English-speaking staff was friendly and helpful, and the cappucinos in the coffee bar were excellent.  The restaurant is quite good as well.  My only complaints are that the rooms are very small and the wi-fi is very annoying because it requires you to relog in repeatedly.",4,2013,05,14
37,Perfect spot in Barcelona,"We stayed at this hotel on a recent trip to Barcelona.  Ugraded to a great suite as an SPG Platinum member.  Beds are super comfortable, wifi is fast, large bathroom with a shower and tub, hotel staff are exceptional, especially for Barcelona standards.  The coffee shop in the lobby is supposed to be the best in Barcelona and I couldn't agree more, hands down amazing coffee.  Location wise, it doesn't really get any better than Le Meridien.  Just off the Ramblas, near the Gothic quarter with many amazing restraunts, bars and nightclubs nearby.  We were pleasantly surprised at this little gem and can't wait to return.",5,2013,05,14
37,"Why go anywhere else, when you can move-in on the Ramblas","Location may not be everything but it is a good start. This is the best Hotel on the Ramblas and for that reason alone worth the selection. That said, the rooms are very tastefully completed in a contemporary Mediterranean style and the service faultless.",5,2013,05,13
37,One of the best locations in Barcelona,"Just finished our stay in the hotel. The rooms were well appointed, beds comfortable, breakfast was good and location on the Ramblas--so easy to get everywhere. The only downside was the wifi that was slow and required you to login and relogin and the room was a bit on the small side. Also recommend you do not stay on the Ramblas side of the hotel if you want a quiet stay. ",4,2013,05,10
37,Disappointing,"Very hard to understand the 5 star status of this holiday. I arrived around 8.45pm this evening (this is a real time review) after a long and hard day expecting (and needing) at least a relaxing evening. And perhaps a little extra comfort given that I am a gold level Starwood member.

The room is small by the standards of the 8 other hotels in this category in which I have stayed in Barcelona. Though I specified a no-smoking room on the internet booking form, the room allocated to me clearly is not no-smoking. Dinner ordered from Room Service around 9.05pm with a predicted 30 minute delay still hadn't turned up by 9.50. A call to Room Service prompted the delivery, at 10.00pm of...the wrong meal. The right meal arrived amidst much apology from a harassed, and embarrassed, server who was twice called on her phone whilst trying to serve my dinner. Not her fault at all...this is a hotel management issue. The food was, at best, tepid. Shambolic.

Need one continue? I am now about to go to sleep...we'll see whether redemption awaits the hotel from the breakfast experience in 9 hours time....

Starwood group on this evidence need to review standards at this hotel. It is not one I could recommend to the business traveller.",2,2013,05,09
37,THE PLACE IN BARCELONA,"Not only is it located right on La Rambla, just two blocks away from Plaza Cataluña, but it also offers stay-of-the-art rooms and amenities, plus their service is just great --friendly and attentive without being too sweet and almost fake. Ah, they also have a great restaurant that I'm going to review separately.",5,2013,05,09
37,Disappointing,"Sadly, I found this place pretty poor for its supposed 5* status. From mistakes with our room allocations, to the dreadfully slow 'high speed' internet, to the spa (we couldn't have treatments at the same time due to staff holidays), to very poor soundproofing of the rooms (both from street noise and paper thin walls between adjacent rooms), to loud maintenance work disturbing us...

The staff tried their best - but with a room costing nigh on €400 per night, we expected far, far better than merely an excellent location on La Rambla. Not nearly on-the-ball enough, and hence one of the more disappointing hotels in nearly a decade as a Starwood platinum guest.",3,2013,05,08
37,Not Family Friendly,"We checked into the hotel and were asked to complete a form certifying that our children were under the age of 17, (they are 4 and 2). When we arrived to our room and saw how small the bed was, we called to ask for the King room we had reserved. The man on the phone freaked out when he realized we were four people in the room and said we would be charged 55 euros per child per night or leave with no refund and no reservation anywhere else. It was awful. We asked for a manager and were told he was the manager. No name was volunteered. we asked for a General Manager and were told he was not at work that day. We were able to get Starwood Preferred on an Internet chat and after referencing the hotel's OWN website stating that children under the age of 12 could stay for FREE in their parents existing room, the front desk manager backed down. We made a conscious decision not to spend one dime on such an unwelcoming property. We were very uncomfortable and will not stay at this property in the future if we can help it despite the location being very desirable. The sheets felt grainy and a ladies watch was by the bed which makes one wonder when the room was last serviced. We left the watch in the room - I am sure it is there for the next person as well! The nicest thing we can stay is that upon check out, the bell hop - after being tipped - brought bottles of water to our car for our kids for the drive out. We certainly expect more from a Starwood property and are very grateful for Nicky M.'s assistance over the chat.",1,2013,05,07
37,Wonderful hotel in the heart of the city,"Stayed at this hotel recently, and absolutely loved it.  From the moment we walked in the front door, we were treated with extreme professionalism and courtesy--the front desk staff, the concierge, the doormen.  EVERYONE was absolutely great.  The hotel is right on La Rambla, and I was worried that it would be too chaotic and noisy.  However, the room was completely quiet, and the hotel was a peaceful haven.  Ricardo, the concierge, was especially helpful, and I appreciated the fact that he asked for and remembered my name throughout my stay.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the fitness center is above average for a hotel.  I loved staying there.",5,2013,05,07
37,Le Meridien stay May 2013,"Spent two nights in this property.  The location is very good.  The staff was very friendly and no language problems.

We had a Starwood Preferred room which was very nice. Large by Europe standards. One word of caution for Sr. citizens.  The way the bath tubs are constructed it can be very dangerous getting in and out of.

Had several meals in hotel, which were good..",4,2013,05,06
37,Amazing Mediterranean suite in a fantastic hotel,We stayed at the Meridien Barcelona for 4 nights and was not disappointed!  This hotel was full of great surprises.  It is located off a busy tourist street but still felt relaxing and quiet.  Salvador (I think he's the reservation manager) really made our stay!  He was quick to fix any problems we had and was always happy to help!!!  The staff are friendly and professional but always busy.  The Mediterranean suite was one of the most beautiful rooms I've ever stayed in!  The terrace was almost the size of the entire room!!!  It was great for a few afternoons of sun tanning.  The view from the terrace was breathtaking and I miss staying there already.  I will stay here again if I'm ever back in Barcelona!,5,2013,05,06
37,Fantastic Hotel & Perfect Location & Friendly Staff,"Could not fault this hotel in any way. 

We had arranged an airport transfer through the hotel at both ends of our stay, which worked very well. The driver was very friendly and informative and gave us complimentary bottles of water for our journey. The welcome at the hotel reception was very good. 

Our room was fantastic. We had a room with an outside terrace area. The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Room service was great. It was a special Birthday whilst we were there and the hotel sent a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries to our room. The room was spacious and very well decorated. 

Our checkout was very easy and straightforward.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and if we were to travel to Barcelona again, I would certainly stay here again.",5,2013,05,06
37,Great location and helpful staff,"We arrived early in the morning and we were greeted very warmly in the lobby and by the front desk staff. Our room was ready right away which was nice, but the check in was a little on the slow side. The hotel has a beautiful entrance and a nice lobby area to hang out in. They also have a small breakfast, coffee area. The rooms were a good size and the beds were extremely comfortable. The room included a small desk and a flat screen TV on the wall that offered many options in english which was convenient. The bathroom had a very roomy showering area. The hotel offered free WiFi in the lobby, but there was a charge to utilize in the room. The concierge was extremely helpful and patient. They booked a few options for us including a bike tour and a flamenco dancing attraction. The only issue is that at times there were long lines to gain access to the concierge. The hotel is in a fantastic location on Las Ramblas and all it has to offer in terms of food, shopping, markets, etc... If you are a Starbucks fan, there is one located about 50 yards from the main entrance. A metro stop is a two minute walk away which I found very easy to use. We used it to see a soccer game at Camp Nou. The gym was nice as it had some cardio machines, free weights and other equipment. We loved this hotel and would recommend it to others.",5,2013,05,03
37,Great Hotel in a Great Position,"We have stayed in this hotel on a number of occassions and are never disappointed, the welcome is always warm, and the staff are helful and friendly. The rooms are a good size, modern with great bathrooms. The breakfasts are varied and of good quality.

The bar area is a little impersonal and not a place that invites you to spend the night, but hey, you're on Las Ramblas with a wealth of night life on your door step.

We use the hotel as a before and after stop over for cruises from Barcelona and is a lovely way to start and round off a holiday.",5,2013,05,02
37,"Fantastic location, professional staff, stylish decor","I stayed 5 nights at the Meridien Barcelona in mid-March and had a great experience.  The location can't be beat as it is right in the heart of La Rambla: a 10 minute walk down to the coast, 25 over to the National Art Gallery, or 5 up to the Plaza Catalunya.  The staff was quite attentive and my room had a nice view of the open square out front.  The evening drinks in the lobby were a nice touch and decor was stylish.  Overall, an excellent hotel that I highly recommend.",5,2013,04,29
37,on Las Ramblas,"No hotel could be better located. A short walk from the old town, food market, supermarket/pharmacy, many restaurants, shops, galleries and department stores. Of course this doesn't come cheaply. We used points as SPG members, but in cold cash this hotel would have been nearing $500 for a rather small room. Although the building is over 100 years old, the interior is totally modern. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the side street, therefore quiet. Air conditioner vents were well placed so they don't blow directly on you while you sleep. Bed was very comfortable after two weeks of sleeping on a cruise ship. A small table and easy chair were good for comfortable seating for a snack. The bottles of water were a nice touch. The fridge has half a shelf which is usable without disturbing the automatic charging system if you  don't want to use some of their overpriced snacks and provide your own. 
The modern bathroom has robes available for use and a scale if you dare weigh yourself after a cruise. A thoughtful touch was the blue nightlight. My only problem with an otherwise great bathroom was the very deep tub which could prove a problem for less agile people.  
We had requested a very early check  which they had ready for us at 10 am . The check-in was efficient and they had copies of English language newspapers at the desk for taking. Also on the 5th floor a table held apples, which from the way they were disappearing were popular with guests.
All in all, a very classy convenient hotel in a fascinating city.",4,2013,04,29
37,great location...average value,"We spent three nights at the hotel post cruise. Our room was not ready and the complimentary coffee/biscotti was appreciated. The shower in our room had multiple leaks which spread water
all over the tub area. We reported it to the reception but nothing was done. There is no evening  turn down service. For the price we paid ($520 per night) we would have expected much better service.
On the positive side the location is the best for visiting the city.",3,2013,04,28
37,First time visit...,"Lovely rooms and wow...the bed is amazing! Better than my bed at home and the linens are devine. Nice staff. Check in desk area is very small but very efficient. After 17 hours of travel, arrived on a rainy, cold and gray day so it was nice to find the desk staff accommodating in getting us into our room quickly We had a 8:00 AM arrival after all night travel. Note: Rooms are not normally ready until after 12:00 PM (noon). Room service (lunch) was quick and tasty but it has taken us a bit of time to figure out the phone's for room service. I know...it sounds silly but the phones are not clearly marked as in other hotels with international ""pictures"" for the different services with in the hotel. Finally found the little black ""service"" button. We are here for two nights and will move on to our next destination is Spain. More to come...",5,2013,04,28
37,Great Stay on Las Ramblas,"We travelled here pre-cruise for 4 nights, and had a great stay. Although we were nervous about staying in such a heavily congested, touristy area, we had a relaxing, great time, and benefitted from the centrality of the location (very close to placa catalunya), many shops, restaurants, and the Carrefour grocery store steps away.

We had a room that faced a side street on the SPG floor, so we got internet included, but it is free in the lobby I believe for other users.  Water was complimentary, and the room was very modern an adequate for our stay.  We enjoyed the service, proximity, and the consistency we get with SPG hotels (we also stayed at the W post-cruise).  

We chose the ""green"" option you get when you stay past 2 nights and in lieu of housekeeping you get $5 euros to spend in the hotel bar for lattes. We also got 2 free lattes and free admission to the museum (we didn't use). There is a starbucks next door, but the hotel serves fantastic Illy coffee.  For food I recommend you check out the grocery store next door Carrefour (also has a pharmacy--it is HUGE).  You area steps away from everything.   For dining check out Teresa Carles 5 min away on a side street!!!!  We avoided the shops/restaurants on Las Ramblas.

TIP: download google maps to your iPhone (uses your GPS so it's free).  Plot your must-sees and you are set!!! =) Barcelona is a walkable city and the only time we too transportation is to Parc Guell (another must see).  You can buy a 10 trip card, which is sharable amongst two people (we just paid the $2 individual fare as we love walking).  Walked all the way to the harbour and back, which is beautiful.

Let me know if you found this review useful, and I am glad to answer any questions!",5,2013,04,20
37,Again a fantastic stay,"Third stay here in 5 years. Hotel remodelled since. Excellent service throughout, very accommodating in allocating room and facilities for toddler. Best location in town. Room was of adequate size and the bed is just awesome, very good sleep quality! Had room service twice and both times got the order wrong however was rectified straight away and the food was very well made and tasty, unlike other hotels room service fare. Yes, hotel is pricey but worth the money due to excellent service and the great location.",5,2013,04,20
37,Just as the pictures show!,"The reception area is a bit too small for a hotel of this size, but the staff try their best to cope and are very friendly and helpful. They also gave us a voucher to see a museum nearby for free and for 2 nice cups of coffee in their cafe or bar area! (The museum was sadly on the boring side). 

Lovely, modern, renovated, medium size room with a great tv and bathroom with a tub and shower. Our room did not have a view, just a building close to you but it was not a problem as the curtains shielded it & the price was very reasonable. The hotel's location is excellent: on the famous La Rambla street and near the subway and many restaurants, etc. In the middle of the hussle and bussle but the hotel was quiet: which made the whole experience of staying here very good!",5,2013,04,19
37,A staff that goes beyond....,"This hotel was located perfectly for me and my son as we were visiting my other son who was studying in Barcelona. The supervisor on duty did his best to accomadate our early arrival and when we returned from 3 days of traveling, he upgraded us to a beautiful suite with the greatest shower that I have ever seen. The suite had it all.
We walked everywhere and had some amazing meals in local restaurants that my son had heard about from locals.We were warned about pickpocketing but if cautious you will not have any problems. I would definately return.",5,2013,04,18
37,Very Nice Hotel and great location,"Very nice hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Very friendly and helpful staff speaking numerous languages. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Shower is very large which is always nice.
Food at the bar is also quite good.
Overall very nice hotel and service.",4,2013,04,16
37,excellent location,"the hotel is perfectly located in downtown Barcelona. Even if it's on the main street Las Ramblas, the rooms are very quiet. I picked up a room not overlooking the main street cause I was afraid of too much noise, but I heard from other guests that also those on the main were quiet. 
the king room is fairly big and the bathroom has all comforts including a small TV screen which is a plus! I strongly recommend breakfast; there's a wide selection of cakes, hot and cold dishes including the typical Churros, daily fresh. The personnel is multilanguage and very friendly.
The price per a king room is about 140 euro per night, not too expensive all considered.",4,2013,04,15
37,Fantastic!,"Le Meridien is in a great, central location. Easy to walk or take the metro all over the city. The room was very modern, clean and had all the amenities you could need. Also, the hair dryer was excellent quality and there is no need to take your own from home. They had a restaurant, but we never use it. We only had coffee from the bar in the lobby. The hotel has free wifi in the lobby which is a nice touch. There is a small rooftop with a plunge pool as well. Beds and shower were also very comfortable. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2013,04,14
37,Quality hotel but not a fan of the bathroom,"We stayed at the Le Meridien for one night just as a pre-airport hotel on our way out of Spain.  The location of the hotel is right off Las Ramblas, but on a quiet side street -- perfect if you like that scene, and a possible negative if you want to avoid the inevitable all-hour crowds.  We are preferred SPG members and stayed on points.  The service was lovely, and the rooms were spacious and well maintained.  My only negative is the bathroom -- the doors to the bathroom are frosted glass which are not completely opaque.  Also, they slide closed, but not completely, so that you can see in through the crack.  This may not be a big deal for some people, but I was really bothered by the lack of privacy.  Just something to keep in mind!",4,2013,04,12
37,Quality we expected and great location,"We are loyal SPG members and this hotel met our high expectations.  Staff was warm and professional. The concierge service was quite helpful with reservations.  We were in a second floor king room and a bit worried about noise, but it was fine facing the side road.  Location is ideal with nearby metro, easy taxi service and walkable to the port area and many sights.",5,2013,04,08
37,Le Meridien La Rambla Barcelona,"This hotel is contemporary and centrally located in the most tourist oriented part of Barcelona.  For me, a perfect location because I am a tourist and don't want to spend a lot of time having to travel to the sites I want to see.  La Rambla is a central gathering place and runs along the border of the historic Gothic District.  Form the hotel you can walk to this district to explore the origins of Barcelona, stroll to the beach, access the subway, etc.  The staff at the hotel were helpful and from the restaurant you can people watch for hours.",5,2013,04,07
37,Le Meridien solid,"As others have said, the biggest draw to this Barcelona hotel is its incredible location right on La Rambla, only steps from the Metro, and within a leisurely walk to many of the key sights in the city.

We had a 4th floor room with a view of the side street rather than La Rambla.  Noise was never an issue.  The king size bed (rare in itself in most mid-priced European hotels) was very comfortable, and the room moderately sized (again by European standards).  The staff was universally helpful and cheerful, especially concierge Bruno, who went out of his way to help us prepare for the next leg of our trip.

While Le Meridien is steps from La Rambla, which is packed with restaurants, they are all tourist based and over priced.  I highly recommend the short walk to Barri Gotic and - even better - La Ribera.  These neighborhoods are a short walk from the hotel and away from the bustle of La Rambla, and there are countless better food options among the winding streets.

A small critique of the hotel - the free wireless is nice, but very weak on higher floors.  Needing to watch a sporting event from the US in the middle of the night, we spent $19E on the ""high speed"" wireless option, but noticed little difference in performance.  Again, a small critique in the big picture for a hotel that does all it can to keep its guests happy.  We highly recommend Le Meridien.",4,2013,04,07
37,Perfect hotel,"This hotel is perfect, starting form it's location. It literally can't get any better. Sitting in the middle of the bustling Las Ramblas, shops or just outside the hotel. If you're a big a shopper (like me) and bags get too heavy, just stop by the hotel, drop off and go back out. The centrality of the hotel makes this easy! 
The service is excellent. We ate at the restaurant twice in four days, because the food is super and the prices are fantastic. Being in such a hotel you would expect the prices to be sky high, but they were like any other restaurant, except the service and food were much better than anywhere else we went to. 
The room was a good size and very comfortable. 

I really can't praise this hotel enough. Would go back there any day!",5,2013,04,07
37,Great Location & Service,"Located on La Ramblas.  Great lobby and friendly, helpful staff.  Concierge was very helpful in directing us to good restaurants.  The room was clean, but small and with no view.  If you are a Starwood traveller, definitely choose this hotel over the W if it is not beach weather.  If you plan to hit the beach, you might consider the W, but the location of Le Meridien can't be beat.",4,2013,04,02
37,Best location on Ramblas!,"Predictably great stay at Le Meridien!  Attentive staff, clean rooms and can't beat location in the center of the action!  As SPG platinums we were upgraded to an executive suite and loved the concierge and lobby staff.",4,2013,04,02
37,"Best hotel, great Location, excellent for couples + single or Business travellers or 'new to town-want to be close to everything","Stayed here for work, over Feb 2013. Beautiful hotel. Located off the Ramblas close to the Playa Catalunya, where you can get the tourist buses to all Barcelona locations. Incredibly good location if you are new to town and want to be close to the famous Ramblas. 
The room was 5 star. The interior is beautifuly designed and finished to a very high standard. No english TV. There's a restaraunt in hotel, which serves breakfast early, this is helpful as most places only open after 10am.
",5,2013,03,31
37,"Best location, good service, old room","Location is the main feature of this Hotel. In the middle of all attraction, shopping, restaurant and La Rambla. Just 10 minutes walk to many places, easy access to Metro, Taxi, Bus, etc

The room is quite old but fully functional, services very efficient, breakfast is very good.

Been here almost every February since 2006. Very well recommended for business and also for holiday.",4,2013,03,30
37,Lovely modern hotel,"The hotel is perfectly situated on La Rambla in the Cntre of Barcelona. It is very modern in appearance, but the decor feels very in tune with Barcelona.

The rooms are somewhat on the small side, but the bathroom is a good size and well designed, although the tv in bathroom seems a little over the top! 

The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. They also now their stuff and are able to help first time visitors to the city as though they were tour guides.

The hotel provided excellent value for money and lived up to expectations.",4,2013,03,29
37,"Excellent room, great staff, minor complaints","I made reservations at Le Meridien Barcelona for a 4 night stay as part of a Spain vacation. I was upgraded to a Prestige Suite using my suite night awards and I couldn't have been happier.  While not the best view, the room was fantastic.  The bathroom was spacious, included both a tub and stand alone shower, and came equipped with great toiletries and other amenities.  I think they hooked me up with Contemporary Prestige Suite, and the furniture (including the king sized bed) were extremely comfortable and well thought out.  After check in, a staff member even dropped off a bottle of Hermes cologne to my room... an unexpected but welcome gift.  One complaint I had has to do with the lighting in the bedroom.  There are only 2 lamps that are dim at most, and they are intended to provide lighting for the room.  Looking in the closet and pulling out clothes at night before going out seemed to be a guessing game.  It just seemed unnecessarily dark. Dimmer switched or a ceiling light would have helped.  Also, the room included no full length mirror.  Just an odd omission in my opinion.  As a Starwood customer, I was a big fan of this hotel and all that it offered.  The room was so comfortable and romantic, we had a hard time dragging ourselves out of bed in the morning to explore the city. I definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,03,25
37,A few inconveniences but overall good,"Stayed in room 812. Faced the side street, not Las Ramblas. Had very little problem with street noise as others had complained about, except for when we left the balcony door open when it was warm. Had to close the balcony door to avoid noise. Overall a good location and price. 
Something good: 
- They gave us free bottled water and a fruit bowl. I think this was related to our starwood  membership.

Here are some things I wish the hotel would work on: 
- We are not late night party-goers, so we tended to be back in our room after a late (Spanish hours) dinner, and wanted to watch a movie a couple of times. Could not get the movie function to work. Checked with the hotel and it was broken in our room - they tried to fix it while we were there, but they could not. 
- As a result, we ended up downloading a couple of movies on our laptop, but the hotel wireless was not very good, so it was slow with lots of interruptions. Slow internet is free, but fast internet was about 20-25 euros per day. We paid for the fast internet, but it was not fast enough to prevent problems with streaming movies. 
- We had a few days when the power was out in the hotel between 11am and 1pm. I believe they were doing some electrical work on one of the floors. This turned out to be a little inconvenient with our plans. 
- The bed was not very comfortable. I am not fussy about mattresses, but this one hurt my back.",4,2013,03,24
37,"Excellent Location, Great Service, Small Rooms","The location of this hotel couldn't be more perfect for a tourist weekend in Barcelona.  Located right on the Ramblas, it was easy to walk to most of the major sights or to a subway station that would take you where you needed to go.  There's a bus from the airport that stops a few blocks away so getting around the city from here is pretty easy.

Service here is great - I showed up at 7:00 am after a red-eye and even though normal check-in isn't until 3:00 they were able to provide me with a room.  They also offered me some tickets for free coffee at the bar area and local museum tickets.

The only disappointment was that the room was a bit on the small side and looked directly at the hotel wall across the street.  For the prevailing rate the weekend I stayed there were probably better values to be had in Barcelona (Hotel 1898 across the street looked like it had nicer, larger rooms and was less expensive).",4,2013,03,24
37,"Class, Affordable and Great Location","LeMeridien Barcelona offers 4/5 Star amenities at a 3 star price. First stayed here in April 2012 and mean to write a review then. They are located right off Las Ramblas and are steps away from a metro station that can get you to all parts of the city. 

Service: The staff are wonderful. They are very nice and are extremely helpful in recommending areas to eat and visit. They offer late check out and also arranged a taxi service for us to get to the airport. 

Room: We had a double bed room and the room was average size and we were able to fit a blow up bed in the corner. The look was very modern and the beds were very comfortable. The shower was great and powerful, although it did require a huge step in/out. We were given an upgraded room and had a sort of balcony through a sideway opening window. I was surprised and pleased that the staff gave us this, especially since we got the room booked through Priceline. Definitely great value for the money. 

Location: Located off of Las Ramblas, it is easy to go out and find many shops and restaurants with good value. The metro Placa de Cataluna is also very close and we were able to get to see many of the tourist spots with our 2 days in Barcelona. 

Overall: I really enjoyed Barcelona. Great night life, wonderful food, and the culture is great. LeMeridien Barcelona was the icing on the cake that provided a comfortable place to stay with their modern rooms, great staff, and great location. I definitely recommend staying here if visiting Barcelona.",5,2013,03,23
37,Elegance and chic in Las Ramblas,"What a fabulous place.!,, The rooms were delightful, very chic! The service was impeccable. Room service was excellent as was the restaurant. The concierge was very helpful but do not go to the waterfront returants he recommends. Stick to local tapas. Back to the hotel... truely a gem for  the price",5,2013,03,21
37,You Can Go Back Again,"We first stayed at LeMeridien Barcelona December 2011 and were overwhelmed by its overall ambiance, attentive service, and perfect location. Based on our favorable first impression we decided to celebrate my February birthday in Barcelona at LeMeridien. Sometimes, returning to a special place can prove to be disappointing as it may not live up to one's memories, but this was not true of our second visit to LeMeridien. Because we checked in on my birthday, we were upgraded to a newly redone suite (located on the quiet back side of the hotel) plus a bottle of cava and a delicious birthday gateau were delivered to our room with the staff's birthday wishes. 

Everyone was so warm and accommodating, especially Bruno and Ana Miquel! And the restaurant staff were always so cheerful in the morning, it felt like being with family.

The rooms are fully outfitted with everything one could need including the first flat iron I've ever seen provided by a hotel in addition to a hairdryer.  Outstanding idea!  

And, yes, the location is ideal within walking distance to the Old City and the subway making it
easy and tireless getting around.

LeMeridien will always be our home base when in Barcelona.",5,2013,03,21
37,A fabulous hotel in a central location with friendly and helpful staff!,"In the center of the colorful and fascinating city of Barcelona is this elegant and pampering hotel. We were delighted with the room and the amenities as well as with the courteous and helpful staff. As a couple without children, we enjoyed the easy access to the old city.",5,2013,03,18
37,Excellent location!,Stayed here for 3 nights in the second week of March and the stay was excellent. The hotel is located bang in the heart of ramblas street. It has a modern and very warm lobby.  The check in was quick and the staff extremely helpful. The rooms are spacious clean and comfortable. If you are looking for a view then recommend floor 6th or higher. Had a great trip and meridien made it even better. ,5,2013,03,16
37,Great location very nice staff.,"Once again a Le Meridien does not disappoint.  Great rainwater showerhead in the shower :-)  Nice room, got to check in early and the location couldn't have been better.  Within minutes of the Placa de Catalunya and just off of LA Rambla.",5,2013,03,14
37,Excellent hotel in great location,"This is a first rate hotel.  The service is excellent and the location is perfect for getting about the city.  We had three nights and could have stayed longer. It is very close to the Placa de Catalunya where all the important transport links converge, including tourist bus tours.
Thoroughly recommended.",5,2013,03,12
37,Not a 5 Star,"This property does not deliver what you'd expect from a 5* hotel: no real lobby area, unispired rooms, no service. Out room was small and noisy, and the beds not comfortable at all.

Only asset is the location. We checked out the 1898 and it looks faboulus: great lobby bad, elegant room and a fantastic rooftop bar/pool.",3,2013,03,11
37,Best hotel in Barcelona,"This is my best hotel in Barcelona. I stayed two nights last february on a business trip. The hotel is well located, the room is very spacious and modern; the breakfast is very good. The staff is very helpful. This is my fourth stay at le Meridien Barcelona and I will never try any other hotel If I go again to Barcelona. It really deserves its five stars. I warmly recommend it.",5,2013,03,04
37,Beautiful & extremely comfortable & accomodating,"This was the last stop on our tour through Spain and it was well worth it. The hotel itself i.e. quality of the rooms and service were top notch. The bathroom and shower were awesome - very nice for a hotel room; and the beds were very comfortable. The air conditioning was on and working which was very nice (as opposed to a few other hotels we stayed at in Spain).

Since this hotel is on Las Ramblas other web reviewers were saying they could hear street noise at times if their room was street-side of the hotel. We had an inner room not on the street so we couldn't hear anything and I can't comment for certain on the street noise or not. 

One nice thing was that the restaurant, Centonze, was very accommodating to my strict gluten free diet. While their menu wasn't huge - they had gluten free options and they even made me gluten free bread! That was great.

It's right on Las Ramblas - the busiest street in Barcelona. Which is nice because we walked to EVERYTHING from this hotel including the beach, the gothic quarter and Picaso's museum, La Sagrada Familia, etc. La Sagrada was definitely a decent walk but doable for us. The beach area was an easy 10-15 minute walk from the hotel.",5,2013,03,03
37,Great Location,"This hotel has a great location and even if it is near the Ramblas in not noisy at all. My room was elegante, modern and  beautiful, seemed recently renovated
The hotel is surrounded by coffee shops and typical Tapas places.
The staff is nice and helpful. Rafael went really out of his way to try to help us a problem. He was efficient and caring.",4,2013,02,23
37,"Excellent location, staff OK","Stayed at Le Méridien Barcelona at the end of December while they were renovating the higher floors.

Initially stayed in a deluxe room, and later switched to a junior suite. Due to the renovation the junior suite was noisier.

Pros:
+ Location is excellent
+ Decent breakfast
+ Good cocktails in the bar
+ Prompt room service
+ Very quiet and intimate feeling in the lobby

Cons:
- Some issues with some of the staff
- The junior suite was rather dark, and to make matters worse, the walls were grey. Lighting should be improved",5,2013,02,19
37,Perfect Location for a Barcelona Break,"I have just spent 3 nights in this hotel situated on La Rambla right in the heart of Barcelona, with my wife, daughter and two grandchildren. The position of this hotel could hardly be better, a short walk in one direction to the Plaza de Catalunya and in the opposite direction to the Port. You will find two of Gaudi's famous buildings, La Pedrera (Casa Mila) and Casa Battlo not too distant, within walking distance for all but the most frail. 
My only criticisms of the Hotel were the beds, bit lumpy and not very comfortable, and the bar service was a bit hit and miss, sometimes we waited ages to be asked for our order, despite the fact that there were very few people in the bar. 
Despite these minor irritations, the staff were very friendly and efficient and I would not hesitate in booking this Hotel again.",5,2013,02,15
37,Not a 5 star hotel,"My 23 year old architectural student son and I booked to stay here with British airways, as a club
Class package in January. We have over the years stayed in many hotels within the Meridien group and always found them good, this one however was not. When staying in a 5 star hotel I do expect help with my baggage, ( they did not, ) the room was also so tiny, excellent shower though. 
We had dinner in the restaurant , we had to send the starter back as it was so salty, to be fair they didn't charge for it. Breakfast was not 5 star. 
Whilst eating our meal a fight stated on the street outside which wasn't a pleasant experience, seeing police armed with batons hitting youths. 
The next morning we checked out even though we had paid for a three night stay ( it was that bad.) We went to stay at El Palace and saw a totally different city. We are returning to Barcelona in May to continue enjoying the wonderful sights and  we are going to stay at El Palace again.",1,2013,02,09
37,"YES, PERFECTION DOES EXIST!","Le Meridien Barcelona was simply the best experience I've ever had in my traveling life. 

At first, on La Rambla - Barcelona's everlasting party.

Secondly, amazingly art-deco design 5-star hotel, with the very Barcelona's spirit.

Then, surprisingly upgrade to Prestige Suite (I've had booked Junior Suite) for me and my kids (thanks, my darling Laura!).

At last, but not least - my endlessly thankfulness to Concierge - Christian, Bruno, Ricardo and friends, who've made our stay very special before, during and after that!

Alex, Jordi and my Galego friend - for your perfect service, warm reception and pleasant talks about football, indeed we've become Barça fans :-)

And Franziska - ich liebe dich! wir treffen uns wieder bald!

No more IHG Hotels, Starwood forever!

37,Best service in Barcelona,"We had reservations at a decent hotel in Las Ramblas but after sleeping there for one night, decided vacations were not meant to be spent on beds with the soft suppleness of a marble slab, specially if such bed has a slight but noticeable tilt towards the headboard.
We reached Le Meridien and the personnel bent over backwards to get us a great room. 
One suggestion, make sure you search a couple of travel websites for deals. They found us a great room for 450 euros a night! I reserved the same room on Orbitz, while chatting with the check-in clerk at the counter, for 180 dollars...",5,2013,02,04
37,Good Meridien in good location,"This Hotel location is really in the center of the center  .
I got a very nice room , looking at the Ramblas , If you want quietness at night , avoid this direction , but i liked the feeling and vibe , although was a bit noisy.
service was good ,and overall very good experience and nice surprise.",4,2013,02,03
37,Perfect location,The hotel is right on Rambla where the main attraction is for 24 hours. Main locations to visit are walking distance and the reception is very helpful in finding your way around the city. Rooms are nice and clean.,4,2013,02,03
37,Very good hotel on Rambla,"The hotel is very central, very functional both for work meetings and for holidays. I was there for a work meeting for 3 days and it was very relaxing to have a walk in between meetings.
Good rooms, very clean, good bedding and good service. Personnel very kind and attentive to client's attentions. It worth a stay.",4,2013,02,02
37,There is better in Barcelona,"I've stayed in many of the 5 star hotels that Barcelona has to offer. There are two disappointments so far. Le Meridien is one of them.

The service was spotty at best. I was staying with 2 other colleagues and we all experienced the same problem : the climatisation of our rooms was actually simply heating. So the dial that said -5 actually did nothing... This meant that the option that was given to us by the hotel was to open the window (which was not really an option because La Ramblas is a very noisy street) or have a fan brought up which doesnt really solve the problem. Overall unsatisfied with this whole situation... specially considering that Barcelona doesnt really have a need for heating and both should be available in a 5* hotel.

The redeeming quality of this hotel is of course its location! amazing to get around.",3,2013,02,01
37,"Convenient, modern Hotel.","A convenient location in the middle of Las Ramblas. Although not the easiest to notice as its right on a corner and the main entrance is up the side street. Reception were very efficient and friendly. Rooms modern, clean, good bathroom and complimentary slippers and bottled water. We were also given complimentary coffees in the bar which I thought was a nice touch. I can't comment on breakfast as we ate out. Would definitely recommend.",5,2013,01,31
37,"lovely hotel, grate location","grate location! just in the middle of la ramblas! rooms are a bit small. grate shawer, no tubs. our dlx room on the 5th floor has a poor view out of the window. staff are nice and frindly. helps you in any why they can. spa is a bit small. when we wanted to order a massage for tow on the same time there was only one staff working so it was inposibale. one of us has to give up.",4,2013,01,30
37,Very pleasant surprise,Stayed here at the end of a cruise and was not expecting anything special. Was I suprised by the location and service at the LeMeriden. I have stayed at 5 star hotels In many cities throught the world and the service here was right up there with the best. Thank you for the attention and comfort you provided.,4,2013,01,28
37,"Great Location, Great Service","The hotel is walking distance to everything and the front desk and concierge are very helpful. The bathrooms are great and the showers are stellar. The beds were merely so-so and the linens weren't really five-star but we got a great deal, so that's a minor quibble. If you can score a good price here, you'll love it. If you're paying full price, it doesn't truly feel like a five-star property.",4,2013,01,26
37,Another fantastic stay,"For me this is the only hotel to stay at in Barcelona. It has style, friendliness of staff and location.
The rooms are also spacious and well presented. Our room this time looked over the Ramblas and we didn't have our sleep disturbed by noise from that quarter. Mind you we walked so many miles everyday nothing could have woken me! I cant wait to visit here again. It is superb.",5,2013,01,23
37,Feel right at home!,"We stayed in this hotel during the New Year holiday. The front desk and the concierge were super friendly and helpful. You get questions? They get you covered. Also, it is just a short walk from Metro.

The location is right at the heart of the Rambla, it was a little noisy during the night but we had no trouble to get to sleep even though our room was right on top of the busy boulevard. If you prefer quiet area but convenient location you might think about booking a hotel around Pg de Gracia.

If you do stay here, remember go check on the Mercat de la Boqueria which is just blocks away. When you just enter the market make a left turn to the far left edge of the market. You will see a seafood restaurant (or food stand) where we had one of those unforgettable meals there. The seafood was so fresh and delicious.",5,2013,01,23
37,Great Hotel & great location,"Nice place with great location. I would definitely recommend it! The hotel is in Las Ramblas area, a nd few steps of Plaza Catalunya. You can find transportation to almost every place in Barcelona. The Metro is about 100 meters from the hotel.
We didn't take breakfast at the hotel as it was very expensive. You can find lot of places for breakfast just close to the hotel.
We had dinner at the Hotel restaurant. They had a 3 course menu for 20 EUR during the week (including wine). The food was excellent! The same menu in the weekend and without wine will cost 35 EUR at the weekend.
We traveled to Girona by train and found it very convenient. There is a new speed train to Girona & Figueras. No need to have a guided tour and pay lots of money for it.",5,2013,01,21
37,Our stay at Le Meridien Barcelona,"Wonderful location, room, food, service, and the equal of our visits to Paris and Rome.
Sorry my review is late but our computer died and have only now retrieved the emails!
Our visit included tours of Montserrat, Antoni Gaudi's home, his garden, Picasso's museum and
Miro's museum all with the help of your concierge.",5,2013,01,21
37,"Very nice, location is good too","Nice place, clean and great location. I would definitely recommend it! However, the food and coffee at the hotel was expensive. The hotel is right in the renowned Las Ramblas area, a beautiful, gothic-styled promenade which leads to the old port of Barcelona. Taxi rates were not that bad in Barcelona.",4,2013,01,20
37,Great location and very professional staff.,"the hote l is near las ramblas, livey and busy part of the city,  Very elegant public areas and it does have a cosy feeling, rooms are of good size,  my only comments is the glass wall and door of the bathroom.  still prefears briks, if you fash the toilet the other person in the room may end up getting woken up by the noise!  Matresses are too soft but that may be a personal taste.

Internet is free for a slower version and chargable for fast version.

All staff are very friendly, welcoming and professionals.

37,Good location not 5 star though,Husband here in Barcelona on business.stayed ay hotel art which was 5 star.this hotel while comfortable lacks the little extras and is not on the same level . No wi fi in room unless you pay 19 euros. You can access free wifi in bar and lobby.breakfast ok but again not 5 star. Room deluxe comfy bed but a little cramped. Location best aspect of this hotel. Hop on off bus great value. Would suggest shop around as this is an expensive hotel.,3,2013,01,18
37,Our second time at this property. Has gone downhill unfortunately.,"We recently stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona, and on the whole, found our experience to be less than excellent. Having stayed at the property seven years prior, we were very excited about returning as we did have a positive experience last time. However, things have clearly gone downhill at this hotel in terms of the service level, the management, and the gradual deterioration of the rooms. 

POSITIVES
1. Location is excellent. Very close to Place Catalunya, which is the transportation hub within the metro system. Excellent place to catch various metro lines and bus lines. Very good area within which to base your stay in Barcelona.

NEGATIVES
1. Service level is poor. We found the staff to be inattentive to some of our most basic requests and needs. Multiple phone calls were required in som cases. This was not the case last time we were here, so this would appear to be a management issue. Also, prior to our arrival, we emailed the General Manager to arrange some aspects of our stay. His response was generally unhelpful and he passed off all responsibility to a very junior assistant who was rather clueless, inefficient and sterile in their response. Ultimately we were not happy with how our requests were handled at all. Especially as a Starwood Platinum, I would rate this hotel among the poorest LeMeridiens in the system. 
2. Rooms need a serious update. The rooms need a major facelift. All the rooms seem to smell of old cigarette smoke and the carpets and furnishings are in need of replacement. 
3. Construction noise. Surely this will subside at some point, but right now there is construction noise from the revamping of some suites (much needed I'm sure, but the other rooms are in even worse shape). 
4. Breakfast not up to standards. For a hotel of this price and star level, the breakfast was subpar. It was a sparse and limited offering which would find at a three star property.",2,2013,01,16
37,Great Location,"We stayed here after a Mediterranean cruise.  We were exhausted and it was raining.  We were so thankful for the warm welcome we received at the Le Meridian.  The staff was so gracious and accommodating.  Being that it was so early the room wasn't ready but the staff gave us vouchers for their coffee shop and a map to the city.  Within a couple hours the room was ready and we were sinking into our very comfortable bed.  They also provided us with an electrical adaptor which was much appreciated.

This hotel is in the middle of Las Ramblas but we were never bothered by the hustle and bustle on the street.  It was a convenient jumping off point.  I highly recommend the hop-on hop-off bus.  Can't say enough about the staff, they were professional and anticipatory.",5,2013,01,14
37,Recommended! ,"We went here right after New Years and we're very happy with the hotel choice! We found this hotel through a ""secret hotel"" offer and didn't know what hotel it was until we paid for it! All they guaranteed was that it was located right by the La Rambla and was a five star hotel. We stayed here from Sat to Tues and had a great time! The hotel staff were very polite and helpful and they even remembered my boyfriend's birthday (mentioned briefly in an email months before) and surprised us with a bottle of Cava and a cake, complimentary! The rooms were really nice and clean and modern! The location of the hotel was perfect! We were right by the La Rambla and it wasn't noisy at all and walking distance to almost everything! The only negative was the room service food. We decided to stay in one night 'cause one of us got food poisining from KFC (!) and didn't have the strength to go out. The food was a bit overpriced and bland, but however we heard that the hotel restaurant is good. Other than that, perfect! Really recommend this hotel if you're looking to stay central and want a nice hotel!",5,2013,01,14
37,Best hotel to stay near Las Ramblas,"Located right on the edge of Las Ramblas, so well situated if that is where you want to focus. The good:  Bright lobby, great lobby cafe with an express breakfast, restaurant looking over Las Ramblas (which served and excellent New Year's Day brunch), excellent service.  Staff is very attentive and helpful.  The bad: Our room was small and didn't allow us much ""leg"" room but the bathroom was large.  Lighting could be brighter, closet was small.  We had a room off Las Ramblas, which was mercifully quiet.",4,2013,01,09
37,great stay,"Great stay, great room, great location, great staff and food, great assistance.
what else can I say about it?
I have  been there for 6 nights with my little daugheters .
the room was great an comfortable, with a huge bathroom, enourmous private terrace.
the service and the clananin service was always on time and well done.
front office and concierge, as bell boys and doorman, always present and ready to help you.
food perfect, sevice on time and attentive.",5,2013,01,09
37,Decent hotel in great location,"We checked into Lè Meridien as Starwood members and were not too happy with the room we were given at the back of the hotel and requested a room facing the street. The receptionist was very accommodating and found us a room later that afternoon. Highly recommend street view as its not too noisy if you are high up and the sun beams in in the morning.

We extended our stay and because the location is great with excellent restaurants next door (Lubo and Luzia are amazing) decided to move across the road to H1898 to try it out and it is even better with an amazing rooftop with heated pool and 360 views of the city. Also have amazing spa facilities although the gym is even smaller than Lè Meridien which is also pokey. Lè Meridien has no pool or spa facilities.",4,2013,01,07
37,"Lovely hotel, great service and amazing location","This is a five-star hotel with all that you would expect from a Starwood property.  The service is excellent, the rooms are comfortable and aesthetically pleasant, and the location is just off of La Rambla - so away from all the madness but close enough if you choose to indulge.  

Our room came with a bathtub, with a built-in shower.  I am 5""2 and the barrier of the bathtub reached well over my knees.  It was a very high step to get into and out of the tub/ shower, and each time I used it I couldn't help but to think about how it would be a safety hazard to other people (for example, my parents in their sixties).   This is definitely something to consider when booking a room.  

Room service accommodated us with an order of cream of chicken soup, even though that wasn't on their room service menu.  

Great diner across the street, Luzia, that we frequented often for breakfast and mid-day snacks.  Definitely visit them for a quick bite or for drinks.  Absolutely lovely and always filled with happy customers. 

Bell captains were always very courteous, helping with luggage and hailing taxis when we needed a car.  Overall, great service.",5,2013,01,05
37,Location! Location!,"Central to everything. Service was very good, and got upgraded to a great suite. But there were minor flaws. Wifi only worked in one corner of the room of the suite. As I said, it was minor - wifi worked perfectly in the lobby. Location couldnt have been better. ",4,2013,01,05
37,Great location.,"Spent one night before catching a Silverseas Med., cruise in July, 2012.  Stayed in ""W"" in 2011 and Hotel Clarise in 2010.  Both are very different in location and style to Le Meridien.  This is a moderately priced hotel, clean, nice decor etc., but the best thing about it is the location right on The Ramblas.
The foyer is small as is the reception desk which seemed a bit chaotic but surprisingly the job got done.  Nice bar and restaurant which closed early which is unusual for Barcelona. Lots of tapas bars surrounding this hotel.  It represents value for $'s and seemed to attract a youngish clientelle.",3,2013,01,05
37,the best location in Barcelona,"stayed there one night Dec 12/12 could not ask for a better hotel
used our air miles(29000)  same hotel in Rome 44,000 air miles   great value 5* service

Limo service to the Port for our cruise the following day  excellent two weeks in spite of the time of year  cool but not cold",5,2013,01,02
37,The best hotel for Barcelona,"Location...location ! You're right on the Ramblas!

Food was great.  Rooms spotless and nice size. You close the window and miraculously the street noise is gone.  I dunno how that works. Wow.  

Everyone is out to make sure that I'm enjoying.  And I did!

The Concierge staff have a wealth of info. My trip was amazing.",5,2012,12,31
37,A rare find,"Spent three nights in late November and enjoyed our stay immensely.  The staff was excellent and very accommodating.  When we arrived the front desk was three deep with check ins and we thought this will take forever.  But, within minutes our luggage was stored and we were on our way to explore beautiful Barcelona. The hotel is right in the middle of everything and within walking distance to all the sights. Our room was excellent. Recently remodeled in a very hip fashion and comfortable.   The concierge staff especially Christain was just outstanding.  He  recommended two excellent restaurants in the neighborhood. His guidance and other recommendations helped to make our visit special. When we return to Barcelona in the future we will stay again at the Le Meridien.",5,2012,12,29
37,Better than reviews listed,"We stayed there Dec 4 - 10, 2012.  The staff could not have been more accommodating and gracious and one was nicer and more helpful than the next.  Our room was  newly remodeled, bath tub is deep and accommodates two (really appreciate this after long day of walking), all appointments were new, bed comfortable and no issues with pillows as mentioned in one of the other reviews. The rooms are not large and some might have a stall shower and no tub but this is an older building as are most on La Ramblas. The only thing you must decide is do you want to be in the front of the building with a great view of La Ramblas which is noisy throughout the night and the subway runs under the Ramblas and vibrates your room or do you want a quite no view room not on the street, again, this is an issue for any hotel on the La Ramblas.  There was construction on the upper floor which was noticeable if you came back to your room for an afternoon nap (they did offer to move us).  The location is about the best you could ask for.  I was a little anxious after reading some of the reviews but pleasantly surprised and would definitely recommend the hotel with the one condition of room location.  It is within walking distance of most sights and the cabs are reasonable and honest. Pickpockets are an issue in the city but with normal precautions (no purses or backpacks), you should be safe... enjoy your stay.",4,2012,12,22
37,Bed woes in a beautiful setting,"This hotel is in the best possible location in the middle of the very active Las Ramblas tourist section. It's trendy and hip and the rooms, while small are contemporary and well appointed. My husband and I both slept terribly and woke up stiff because the beds are rock hard and the pillows are not soft and cushy. I do prefer a firm base with a pillow top, but this was the hardest bed I've ever slept on. For that reason alone, I don't recommend this hotel.
The food in the restaurant was fairly good - by no means a five star restaurant - yet a nice place to escape from typical tapas. The bar is very comfortable - cushy lounge chairs & great group seating, but very busy and service is slow due to under staffing. 
The coffee bar in the lobby makes a great espresso and serves pastries, muffins & cookies for a quick breakfast before heading out. 
Beautiful hotel, wonderful front desk staff--a few management tweaks, upgraded mattresses, and it could be top notch.",3,2012,12,21
37,Hotel Let Down by Admin Processes,"I recently stayed at this hotel, a regular stay through business and its been on the preferred hotel list of the company for some time. On numerous occasions I have stayed without issue and the hotel is nicely located, comfortable rooms and as a result I return on a regular basis.

The most recent stay however threw up a set of concerns that are still unresolved as I type and just generally dont fit a hotel who wish to portray themsleves as attractive to a business customer.

My stay, as usual, was booked through a partner booking agency who handle the booking and billing and then cross charge to the company. I arrived at check in to be asked for my credit card as usual, not an issue and a usual process for holding funds for incidentals which I settle seperate to the room charges paid for by the agency. I then am asked to pre authorise a substantial amount, highly unusual against previous stays. The response to my statement that the room is paid for by the agency is met by, this is to cover damage and bar/food bills and that I was not being charged. I accept and am comfortable that the values and policy for incidentals may have changed. I leave the actual booking confirmation with the desk agent pointing out that this clearly shows the room is paid for by the agency.

The stay in the hotel is fine and the room is comfortable and without fault.

On check out, I am asked to pay the room bill, a surprise considering the points I rasied at check in. I produce the copy of the confirmation and point out that the bill is not for me but for the agency. I do have to point out that the tourist tax is my own responsibility and proceed to pay this. The check out agent takes the booking confirmation from me and promises that she will pass on and organise as she has not dealt with this before and if there are any issues I will receive a call, otherwise expect the matter to be concluded.

2 days on and the hotel still has hold of my funds and after twice calling, I am unable to speak to the finance department, who will call me or email me back in 48 hours to resolve. Now the actual funds are not really the irritant here, its the fact they are holding my own funds and should have released that hold on check out and after chasing 2 days on, I must wait another 48 hours to receive a call or email to confirm the matter is resolved. That simply doesnt feel right and I am pretty sure if it was the other way round they wouldnt allow me to pay them 4 days later from check out!

So a poor show Le Meridien and one thats still not resolved. The icing on the cake will be if you have charged the agency too. 

Business customers, be wary as something has clearly changed in the usual process of booking through travel agency partners.",2,2012,12,21
37,"Clean, Modern, Great location on Las Ramblas, Nice Breakfast buffet","This is my second stay at this hotel.
I arrived in the mid morning and though I am a gold Starwood member I had to wait in the lobby for over an hour before a room was ready as did many others. The hotel was most completely full that weekend. However, the staff was very friendly and actively tried to accomodate those of us who arrived before the ""official check-in"" time.

Restaurant - The breakfast buffet that came with our reservation had a lot of choices, and the service was very friendly. Wonderful croissants.
Lobby coffee place - offered coffees and wonderful thick hot chocolates, champagne and desserts and chocolates, for afternoon and early evening dining.

Bed - clean, and modern, but lower to the ground than I care for.. Soft, white duvet covers.

Bathroom - The bathroom was clean and good toiletries, but with few places to hang a bathroom travel kit. Also, the bathroom sink was lower than one usually finds at an upper level hotel. There was no bathtub, just a large grey, glass walled shower. 

Location - On Las Ramblas which is a great tourist location and not a far walk from a Train stop.
The location is very good, however, at this stay, in late November, there was a lot of ongoing music and noise outside the hotel which kept us up... We arrived from USA and were to catch a cruise the next morning, and the loud music went on for quite some time. The last time I stayed here, two years ago I faced the side street, where the entrance to hotel is, which was a bigger room and not much noise at all. I recommend this instead of facing the Las Ramblas Street.
There are lots of little alleyways and streets one can shop from this location and the fruit/vegetable market is closely, and I recommend stopping by for a fresh fruit drink and snacks.

The location of hotel is great for walking and a cab to the cruise port is about 12 - 15 Euros.",4,2012,12,20
37,Friendly and best location,"From the moment you enter the hotel, you feel welcome. The staff is friendly and there is no wait at the reception. They created key cards for both rooms, which could open both rooms, which is quite useful when travelling as a family. Latte is perfect, also in the morning. Breakfast is a treat, but I was pleased we had paid this as part of our booking, as it is not cheap at 26euro p.p.
The rooms are clean, sufficient and well equipped. Despite the fact that you are located at the centre of Barcelona, there is hardly any noise from outside. Perfect hotel for a long weekend break with the family.",5,2012,12,20
37,Best Location in Bracelona and Great Service!!,"My family and I spend 4 days at Le Meridien Barcelona last week and we had a fantastic stay at their property. Below are some of the highlights of our stay:
 - The reservation staff was very helpful in ensuring that our room reservation needs were met. We were traveling with 2 kids, so they ensured that we had adjoining rooms for our stay. Ms. Montse Pujols gets the highest points for her courteous customer service, providing personal attention, and spending time talking to us several times during the trip. On the day of our arrival, she sat down with us for 20 minutes and gave us personal recommendations for places to visit. Clearly she has a lot of experience in the hospitality industry and Starwood/Le Meridien should be proud to have her on its management staff.
 - The property is located in the heart of Las Ramblas and we are so glad that we picked this location. Our teen age boys had a blast spending time on the Las Ramblas. I would pick this property over any other SPG properties in Barcelona.
 - The cleaning staff made sure that our rooms were made in a timely manner. When we needed anything, they would follow-up within 5 minutes of the phone call to house keeping
 - My wife has lost her purse at Park Guell. Luckily, some nice person found it and called Le Meridien staff that they have left the purse at a public library outside Park Guell. The hotel staff helped us to get the purse picked up from the public library and had it delivered to the hotel. Everything in the purse (credit cards, goggles, personal documents, money was in the purse as is. We are very thankful to the person who found the purse and returned to the public library and Le Meridien staff who helped us to get the purse back.
 - Last but not least, we enjoyed the breakfast, beverages at the property. We also got a lot of personal attention from JiJi at the front desk that helped us with the check in, not to mention Mrs. Pujol's excellent customer attention thru out our stay.
 - I have to say that our stay at Le Meridien was very pleasant, customer service was awesome, and they didn't dime and nickel the customers. Overall, we had a 5-star experience with Le Meridien Barcelona!!!
 - Las Ramblas is very close to many sight seeing locations. For transportation, we used the T-10 Metro tickets (i.e a book of 10 tickets) which you can use it for any public transportation like metro train or bus. One huge benefit of T-10 tickets is that when you punch it for any train or bus ride, it is time-stamped and is good for next 1:15 minutes for any public transportation i.e you can use any public transportation for free for the next 75 minutes without having to use additional tickets!
 - Cable ride over the Harbor is a must. This ride has spectacular views of the harbor and all of Barcelona. Park Guell, Sagrada Familia are also must-see places. And Gelato on Las Ramblas is great way to end the night!",5,2012,12,10
37,Great location,"Lovely hotel, great location, very central, lovely and comfortable,  buffet breakfast was very good with a lot to choose from, if you have a choice of paying for breakfast in your deal do so as very expensive if not. The hotel is very central for all the site seeing, and shopping, we had everything we needed in our room, the bathroom was exceptionally well equipted with toiletries and what a shower room for 6 rugby players.",5,2012,12,09
37,Great hotel if you like a busy and bustling city area,"If your idea of a good time is to be in the middle of the action in a very busy city like Barcelona, then this is your hotel. It was very comfortable and luxurious and you pay for it. The breakfast buffet was great and kind of affordable by European standards
All the shopping you would ever need is within walking distance from the hotel. You are right on Las Ramblas, so people watching is interesting. 
The hotel has a small rooftop spa area that is very comfortable and worth visiting for relaxation. 
Definitely a hotel to stay in if you can afford it. ",5,2012,12,08
37,Beating our expectations,"Just back from a 7 night stay at Le Meridien Hotel Thanksgiving week. In a word, fantastic.  Really enjoyed our stay. Room 445 was excellent. After reading reviews of noise on Las Ramblas I requested a room away from the street and it proved to be very quiet. We even had the window ajar for air at night. The room was clean and fairly small but large enough to accommodate a cot for a few nights so our son who's studying abroad could stay with us. The room was clean with adequate storage space/shelving and closet. The shower area (double stall and huge sunflower head) was terrific. Also, the shower area seemed to be fairly new. The food/breakfast/coffee bar was very good. (Nice to get a late afternoon Cappuccino after a day of tourist stuff).  The hotel staff, front desk/reception, concierge staff was really nice, helpful and friendly.  We look at a few things in evaluating a hotel room; Cleanliness, comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and good pressure for shower.  Check box on all.  We slept the first night and every night very comfortably which can be tough in a hotel bed.  We were impressed with the bed.  The little things like stocking our room every day with fresh fruit, water and dark chocolates were very much appreciated.  Even the little bottle of Hermes’ was a nice touch!  Overall, a wonderful stay and would stay again.  As a side, we went away for two nights mid week to Nice/Monaco and we kept our room to leave our clothes, bags, etc., We let the staff know and had fresh linens on our return. The hotel is right in the middle of the action.  If you like to walk a city, the Le Meridien is a great location. The Catalunya stop for the underground trolly system was very close by and very convenient.  Overall, my wife and I were very happy with our decision to stay there and we would stay again.",5,2012,12,06
37,"Great Location, lovely hotel and fantastic concierge","Le Meridian, Barcelona, was everything you expect from a hotel of this pedigree. The staff were friendly, the room and communal areas are spacious and well appointed. The bathroom is worth a special mention; what a shower! The location is spot on for seeing all of the major attractions on foot, with one or two further away attractions easily accessible by the excellent public transport system, which has stations a few hundred metres in either direction up/down La Rambla.

The hotel has an in-house retauarant, ""Cent Onze"", which serves some amazing food. OK, it's not the cheapest, but it's very good. We also breakfasted in there once; it's pricy at around 50€ for two, but it was very good. There's a café over the road which does a great breakfast for around 20€ for two. The café bar near reception is also very good.

The concierge was incredible and spent 45 minutes trying to sort out an issue we had with tickets for the Sagrada Familia. In the end she got the tickets cancelled at minimum cost and re-ordered new ones from scratch. Without her help, we'd have lost quite a bit of money.

All in all a great base to explore this beautiful city.",4,2012,12,06
37,5 stars in every way :-),"We were delighted with this hotel and the whole experience was outstanding. We booked in on 30th November and stayed two nights. The room was clean, modern and stylish and the bed kingsize (a free upgrade) and very comfortable. The location was perfect for us as the hotel is situated a minutes walk from La Ramblas, and about three minutes from the tube station. 

We were a little worried as our room was on the first floor, at the front of the hotel and just above a side street from La Ramblas, and we thought sound would be an issue as we're both light sleepers. I spoke to reception and they said that we were welcome to change rooms if it was an issue: so we tried the room on the first night and we both slept soundly both that night and the next. It was nice to had the option to change though. 

The hotel staff were polite, courteous and very helpful. And best of all, when we returned from our night out on the Saturday, there was a complimentary bottle of champagne and a lovely card in our room. We were stunned and delighted! It was my birthday and I assumed they checked the passport? What a great hotel!!

Our whole stay was perfect and I just like to say a big 'Thank you' to everyone connected with Le Meridien: Barcelona is a great city and staying in this hotel really made our whole trip magical. To be honest - I couldn't recommend them highly enough and I'll always look for Starwood hotels first on future trips abroad. Thank you again.",5,2012,12,05
37,"Good Location, Great Staff, Pretty Noisy, World's Worst Shower","Hotel staff at this property is the primary reason to stay. Vera at the front desk and Christian at concierge were particular stars. However, several things prevented this from being a five-star experience. 

1) The shower, inside a high-walled tub, is almost impossible to climb into safely. Not quite sure how they clean it also, given that it's impossible to reach the controls without standing inside it. 
2) It's incredibly noisy. We had a room on the side of the hotel - not on La Ramblas proper - and we still had so much noise it was nearly impossible to sleep. 
3) Room seemed oddly decorated (that's obviously subjective)

That said, it's convenient for a cruise (our final destination) - and the location on La Ramblas  could not be better. And as stated before, the staff were top-notch.",4,2012,12,05
37,Good situation but...,"Not my first stay in Barcelona but my first stay at the hotel Le Meridien. Good location on the famous Rambla not far from the Catalunya Plaza which is very convenient if you plan to come with the aerobus, the direct shuttle between terminal 1 or 2 and the center of the city. Facing the hotel H1898, this 5* hotel should be refurbished and some aspects of its construction are a little bit disturbing such the noise of the cabin lifts just beside the room (520) during the first night. They didn't forget to wake us up as from early morning...-:( ...or trouble with our shower mixer with impossibility to get hot water.... After a short and kind discussion, we got an other room (532) more peaceful but always with the same problem with hot water....
Despite this problem, staf tried to help us as much as they could and the quality of the room was correct with flat screen, safe, coffee maker, iron, king size bed, aso....
Restaurant of the hotel was very nice, located on the corner with view on the rambla, quality and design were very appreciated.
As SPG member, i was expecting more than i received in such a brand of this starwood hotel, my stay was pleasant if I want to stay objective but I won't be back...but this personnal opinion only engages myself!",3,2012,12,04
37,Excellent location,"This is my third stay at the Meridien and on this trip everything went well. The room looked out on Las Ramblas (not good if you want an early night) and the amenities were very nice indeed - from the free water to the complementary eau de toilette. Staff seemed particularly friendly and the food in the restaurant was delicious (if a little pricey). 

I wish I could pinpoint why things went so well this time - it may be that ive spent the past week in a tent in the middle of nowhere! In any event, I leave Barcelona looking forward to my next visit!

",5,2012,12,04
37,When staying in the right room...,"I have stayed in this hotel numerous times and waited for the latest room renovation for a ""while""...but, it was worth the wait. Up on the sixth floor where I stayed in the Mediterranean Suite, the walk-in closet and bathroom area is spacious with enough room for a couple with two bags. The room is nicely appointed with a sitting area facing a comfortable king bed. The special feature of this room type is the very large (approx.40sqm) walled in terrace, complete with a six seater dining table, casual beanbags and outside shower!
The service in the hotel is excellent, the front desk and the concierge are very efficient and the staff in the restaurant are friendly. Of course the location, on the Ramblas, is perfect...",4,2012,12,04
37,"Nothing special, not worthy of a SPG hotel","11/16-11/17/2012. Room not ready for early check in as requested. Request for feather free room not honored. Maids had to come up while we were out to dinner and change pillows. Room 609 nothing special. Requested an upgrade from a deluxe room, which I paid 449 euros for, and none available. Room 609 is very noisy: heard toilets running in rooms nearby or overhead all night long as were showers or water in bathtubs. TV set in bedroom was broken. Could not retrieve telephone message and staff came up twice and said that message was deleted and could not be retrieved. Staff said that the message was probably not for me but the prior guest. No staff action to help solve this, just ""I'm sorry"". As it turned out, I found out three days after leaving the hotel that their was a phone message left for me at the hotel that I never got. When I told the front desk that the room is very noisy the clerk said they have no control if guests use the bathroom. I think the staff is in love with itself and think because they are wearing nice suits they are above solving guest problems. I will return to Barcelona and would not stay at this hotel.",3,2012,12,02
37,Good location,"This hotel is well situated near transportation and tourist sites.  The room we had was clean and comfortable.  As we faced a side street we were not bothered (much) by noise from La Rambla, however the air conditioning fan noise kept us up - I think it was heading for bearing failure.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The buffet breakfast - extra cost - was excellent.  All things considered we would likely stay here again.",3,2012,11,30
37,Starwood Hotel in Perfect Location,"Great Starwood property! Less than half a block from boqueria market, less than 5 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya, less than 15 minute walk to El Born area. Pick this hotel for their modern rooms and location not for their amenities. Hotel gym and Hotel Restaurant are nothing special. Make sure to request a room facing the back, not Las Ramblas for uninterrupted sleep.",4,2012,11,29
37,Convenient but noisy,Le Meridien is very convenient for sightseeing since it is located midway on The Ramblas. The problem is since it is located downtown there is street noise that penetrates the rooms all night. They do not have soundproofing or noise preventing glazing to alleviate this problem. The staff was very helpful especially the concierge who helped with routing our sightseeing. Our sleep was so disturbed the first night that we requested a room change. They moved us to the top floor in the rear and it was quiet there. If you stay here it is best to request a room facing the rear even though the view out the window is not so pleasant.On the whole I would say there are other hotels in Barcelona that offer better accommodations for the money.,4,2012,11,21
37,"Nice location, nice stay.","Stayed at the Le Meridien for two nights prior to our October cruise in the Western Mediterranean.  Staff was very kind and helpful.  Enjoyed the close location to Las Ramblas, the free glass of champagne at ""sun setting"" and the wonderful overhead shower - best I have ever had.",5,2012,11,16
37,Superb,"My wife and I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona after a 12 day Mediterranean cruise. Little did we know that our time there was going to be the highlight of our trip.

Le Meridien is located at the heart of Las Ramblas, making it ideal to access the best of what Barcelona has to offer. From the moment we stepped-in we experienced superb customer service and recognition as loyal SPG members. Our room was nicely decorated, well appointed and had a modern vibe as did the entire hotel. In fact, this property exudes modernism and class.

Above all, however, what made our stay so remarkable was the attentiveness of the staff, which made our time there unforgettable.",5,2012,11,14
37,Very Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed 3 nights on an award stay. We were upgraded to a junior suite and because they know from my son who is a gold member that it was our anniversary, the sent us a delicious cake and beautiful flowers. The bed was very comfortable, the room was spotless clean and so was the bathroom. The staff of the hotel are extremely helpful. The location is fantastic. Almost on Las Ramblas and walking distance to the Passeig de Gracia and to many other interesting places.",5,2012,11,13
37,Grand but just a little tired.,"Situated majestically overlooking the famous La Ramblas this Spanish icon has been a feature hotel in the city for many years and is maintaining its 5 star rating against a lot of new local competition -  but only just!

The entrance situated on a busy side street making parking difficult therefore speedy attentive work by the door staff is essential. unfortunately on several occassions when arriving by taxi with items to transfer to the hotel there was no staff to be seen. the subsequent transfer to the hotel was terilous as the taxi had to park across the road from the entrance. STaff did appear after  it was too late !

Reception was speedy and pleasant and the Junior Suite booked served by a separate lift from the main two (an apreciated feature) was well proportioned but certainly very Junior. An unpleasant aspect of the en-suite bathroom was no separate shower and the use oif a plastic curtain to cover the bath  when having a shower in it. The last time I  saw one of these used was in Alfed Hitchcocks film Psycho and we all know what happened to the person in that ! Quite an investment has been made in refurbishing the room and not to provide a separate shower or at least glass doors to avoid splashing from the bath was penny -pinching.

Above average Hotel Restauant reasonably priced with good varied menu and well presented and cooked food and wine and good service.. Their is also a pleasant coffee shop in the foyer selling a range of food and excellent coffee at competitive prices with comfortable seating and selection of multi-lingual reading matter to wile away the time.

An overall pleasant visit spoilt by inattentive front of house staff( not reception) and  a decidedly unhelpful and rude concierge. Feelthat a litle TLC wopuld help the overall atmosphere which had slightly tired feel about it. but definately worth a visit and I would go again if staying in Barcelona despite the vast array of choice,",4,2012,11,10
37,A very pleasant surprise,"Stayed here for five nights in early Nkvember 2012. The hotel was incredibly well run and clean. The room was sharply furnished and the bathroom was the best we had on our trip. The location was superb. Close to the Ramblas, Bari Gotic, and a short walk to the Passeig de Gracia. The staff was friendly and helpful. Great gym. Would definitely recommend Le Meridien. BTW the tours conducted by Context was a highlight of our trip to lovely Barcelona. ",5,2012,11,10
37,Great Stay,"We spent 6 nights on an award stay.  As Golds, we got a room on the SPG floor, but we did not get a view of La Ramblas.  The rooms are very nice--bed was comfortable, shower was very nice.  On this trip, we stayed at the Trafalgar Hotel in London and we much preferred the Le Meridien.  The hotel comped us a bottle of Cava and some chocolate covered strawberries since we were celebrating our anniversary.  One morning, the hotel forgot to call us for our wake-up call.  That afternoon, they comped us another bottle of Cava and chocolate covered strawberries to apologize for the inconvenience.  We thought that was a nice gesture and we appreciate that they were proactive about the situation.",4,2012,11,09
37,"Great location, rooms not 5 star","Ideal location, however you need to realize that the Ramblas location means a little morestreet noise. Rooms rather small and not exactly what I expect to see from a 5 star hotel. Clean but not sparkling",3,2012,11,08
37,Great location great hotel,"Just spent 1 night pre-cruise (October 12,2012) at the Le Meridien and couldn't be happier. The staff at the front desk were fantastic and efficient. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 10:30am and did not expect it to be. We left our luggage and headed out to see the sights and have some lunch,the location was fantastic right in the middle of Las Ramblas. Upon returning our room was ready and it was perfect quiet and well furninshed (not large but enough room for 1 night) the shower was great. We stopped by the conceirge desk for a dinner suggestion and we were not dissapointed  with her suggestion and can't wait to go back. I just want to say thank you to the entire staff for a perfect stay in Barcelona.",5,2012,11,08
37,"Nice hotel in the Ramblas, especially for Americans","Great place. Used Starwood points and cash to have a pretty nice and cheap stay our last 2 days in Spain.

Location is great. Smack in the middle the Ramblas and shielded by the noise.  Easy to find and well known by the taxi drivers.  Check-in was a pain unfortunately given the crowds - we got in at 9am, requested an early room, and had to wait till well after 3pm.  We got a free museum pass but after our redeye flight in from Granada, it was pretty irritating.  However, they were very nice and courteous and it was a busy time.

The subway was pretty easy to get to but did require a bit of walking up or down the street.  The concierge and front desk people were very helpful, they have wireless in the lobby, and a delicious coffee bar downstairs.  The layout is nice.  It is quite modern, very American, and catered to a business traveler.  

We didn't use room service, spas, or anything like that. The hotel provided a central location for exploring Barcelona at a rapid pace.  If you can get the hotel for the deal we did, I would HIGHLY recommend it.  However, if it's expensive, there are a TON of hotels everywhere that I would suggest trying out if you wanted to get away from the ""American"" vibe of this one.",4,2012,11,07
37,A Wonderful Hotel With Excellent Location,"My wife and I stayed at Le Meridien for two nights in late October. Great location on La Ramblas. We stayed on the Starwood Preferred Guest 5th floor and paid extra for a street view room and breakfast. The staff was excellent and reminded us of the change back to standard time while we were there. Excellent room -  quiet,  wonderful bed, large flat screen TV, mini-bar fridge and  large all tile bathroom with great water pressure & TV. Lovely view of La Ramblas, with little street noise. Location could not have been better with many Barcelona highlights a short walk away. Great breakfast with scrambled eggs and cooked to order omelets, bacon, sausage, cereals, juices, coffee, yogurt, fruit, many breads and make your own Mimosas. Also several specialty juice blends. Not much experience with European 5 star hotels, but this is the best in our experience.",5,2012,11,07
37,"Le Meridien, Barcelona Spain","Our party of four (8 pieces of luggage) arrived in Barcelona at the end of a 24 day cruise. We had prearranged transportation through the hotel. It could not have been smoother. ""Oscar"" met us at the cruise pier, loaded us up, and gave an informative running commentary on the way to Le Meridien. The hotel is centrally located on La Rambla ( The main street ). It is very nicely appointed with a welcoming lobby and a very gracious staff. ""Claudia"" quickly completed our registration and we were shown to our rooms.  The rooms were not overly large but were equipped with every amenity and very comfortable. During our stay the staff cheerfully saw to our every request and arranged out transport to the airport. I strongly reccommend this establishment.",5,2012,11,06
37,"Classy, Top Notch Service, Xlnt Location","We stayed here the last night of a 10 day whirlwind trip through Spain.  it was the perfect way to end a wonderful trip.  The hotel couldn't be more centrally located, right on the main street.  I was a little concerned about street noise, since Barcelona has such a lively late night crowd, so I asked if we could have a room off the beaten path.  The very helpful agent put us on the 3rd floor, and it was perfect.  We had a nice view of a quiet side street, and it was blissfully quiet.  The room was nice... very modern and chic, with a fabulously comfortable bed.  We did not eat any meals here, so I can't give any reviews on the food/beverage side of things.  It was an all-around great stay and I would definately go back.",5,2012,11,05
37,An excellent stay,"Rooms a tad on the smaller side but then it is Euro one must make concessions. Service excellent, clean and helpful. Food at breakie very good! A great stay. The location is great with quiet sleeping as the streets are less crowded here at night. Pool is always open for a midnight dip which we found to be unique. I would highly recommend this hotel ",4,2012,11,05
37,Best Location in Town,"We spent three nights at the Meridien in October.  The staff was excellent, the rooms were comfortable, quiet and clean.  Concierge was very busy all day long, but the service was very good in every respect.",4,2012,11,05
37,"Great location, not close to 5 stars","Let me begin by saying that I'm an SPG platinum member and stay about 50 nights per year at Starwood properties in both the US and Europe, so my sampling size is fairly large.
Le Meridien Barcelona is literally in the best place possible for exploring the city, directly on Las Ramblas. All major attractions are within a few minutes walk. The restaurant at the hotel is exceptional - we enjoyed dinner our first night, an extensive hot buffet breakfast every morning, as well as room service. All were flawless. Fitness center was small, but sufficient, I would say it is comparable to other SPG European properties.

My disappointment in this hotel is the rooms and upkeep. The rooms are tired and in drastic need of an update. Standard rooms are very small and those near Las Ramblas are extremely noisy. To make matters worse the ""individual climate controls"" as advertised on the website are non-existant. At the time of our stay the hotel had ""changed over"" from air conditioning to heat. What that means is, regardless of the temperature of your room, all you can do is turn the heat on! This is NOT a 5-star feature. If your room is close to Las Ramblas you can forget about opening your window to lower the temperature, the noise is simply too loud. Additional room disappointments include: a severe lack of water pressure, drains that do not drain properly and Wi-Fi that only works in certain areas of the room (there is a wired connection as well).

Overall, for our first trip to Barcelona, the hotel was adequate, but disappointing - as an SPG member I would clearly stay at the W Hotel considering the amount of money (350+ Euros per night) that Le Meridien charges. When I checked out, after 4 nights, I felt I had drastically overpaid for what I received. Review of W Hotel Barcelona is forthcoming...",3,2012,11,03
37,"Five-star hotel, excellent location and service","We traveled to seven cities in Spain. This hotel was easily the best of the ones we stayed in. Staff was excellent. Breakfast buffet was very good. Location just off La Rambla was good for tourists and yet removed from street noise. The concierge helped us get tickets and find restaurants. The only item we would have liked was a bidet in the bathroom (Picky, picky.)",5,2012,10,31
37,Location,"The location was so perfect. On the beginning of the Rambla and a couple of minutes from the Catalunya metro stop. Plenty of good restaurants close by.

The front desk staff and the concierge were so pleasant and helpful it just made our stay so much more better.

Will stay here when we visit Barcelona again.",5,2012,10,31
37,5-star level but not exceeding expectations,"This is a typical Le Meridien standard hotelm with good rooms, excellent location and service. It is true that there are a lot of new guests arriving and leaving almost daily so the main lobby is busy but you cannot go wrong with this hotel. All your typical 5-star standards are there but nothing above that. If you look for something different try the 1898 Hotel opposite Le Meridien which is also nice or The W which is great but in a different galaxy in terms of the prices.",4,2012,10,30
37,Stay away from room 142,"The excellent: the staff spoke clear English and were very pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful; Antonio, Christian, at the concierge desk, Claudia at reception and particularly Salvador, who is most kind and thoughtful as well as having a great sense of humor.  

The location is excellent. 
The breakfast is not worth much to us as healthy vegans who do not eat animal flesh or breads. The fruit selection was minimal, however, what was there was good.

As Starwood members, we booked with points. This is the second time we've used points, the 2nd Le Meridien we stayed at (first was Panama City), and both times felt robbed on points.

We stayed 3 nights, booked on the phone w Spg, requesting a quiet room, etc. The best night was the 3rd because we were moved to a Deluxe room on the interior of the hotel, #345, with a king bed, large shower, great internet connection and was very quiet. This room uses fewer points and is far superior to the Jr suite we were given in room #142 which had 2 twin beds pushed together, and is very noisy all night long due to laundry and trash trucks for all the hotels there. Plus the internet didn't work in that room, nor did the bathroom tv, which is unnecessary, however if is there, it should work.

The first offer to resolve was to move us higher two floors, in the exact same position, which made little sense and frustrated us, so we used ear plugs the 2nd night, which helped very little.

Finally Salvador came to the rescue as we nearly begged for a quiet last night. We feel like we lost many well and hard earned points as well as losing valuable sleep the first two nights. (We already had recovered from jet lag days before in Madrid.) Otherwise, we would have given a higher rating if we would have had a quiet room the entire time. We would stay here again and now we know what to look for and what to look out for.",4,2012,10,27
37,Great Hotel in Great Location,"I'm always wary when I book hotels on Priceline that I'm going to get stuck in a dark & tiny room and be looked down on by the staff, and this could not have been farther from the truth at Le Meridien Barcelona. The staff were incredibly friendly, from the concierge, to the guys helping with suitcases to the doormen. Great location on Las Ramblas, which made it easy to get everywhere by foot and public transport. Taxi to and from the airport ended up costing about 30 euros, so not bad if you consider the time and hassle saved by not having to deal with public transport. The hotel itself was clean and modern. Would definitely recommend it.",5,2012,10,27
37,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at LeMeridien during our tour of Northern Spain and what a wonderful choice it was!

Located right on the Ramblas and within walking distance to ""La Boqueria"" market, ""Gothic Quarter,"" restaurants and cafes, Le Meridien is the perfect home-base to visit many of the wonderful sites Barcelona has to offer.

The hotel is beautiful and fits perfectly with the city.  The staff is friendly and very helpful.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and the beds are comfortable and appealing.  The restaurant has a fabulous breakfast buffet and the dinners we had there were wonderfully prepared and presented.  It is a 5 star through and through.

Loved it and would stay there again.",5,2012,10,26
37,great location and room.,Right on the famous la rambla. The bed is amazing. The staff was very helpful with suggestions of places to go and with getting into the night clubs. The food from the kitchen was a little over priced but was pretty good. The surrounding places to eat are much better.,5,2012,10,25
37,Superb Service and Comfortable Stay!,"Was first trip to Barcelona and this hotel was amazing! The staff was very acommodating. courteous and professional.  The concierge staff were very helpful and offered wonderful suggestions for dining and ""things to do"" in the area. The hotel is modern, clean and very well maintained. The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are large with rain showers.  

The hotel is located on the La Rambla and is just minutes away from the Pl Catalunya train station.  

Would definately stay here again and would highly recommend to friends and family!!",5,2012,10,25
37,In the Heart of where you want to be!,"Location saves this hotel!  It is right off Las Ramblas, close to the Plaza Cataluna.  Yet, it is 1/2 block off this famous street, so most of the rooms are peaceful.

Our first impression of the hotel was the driver sent to pick us up from the cruise ship dock.  10 minutes late, and driving a VW, not the Mercedes we were promised, the charge was 40E to the hotel.  Afterwards, we actually walked to the dock, so the distance was less than a mile.  Best suggestion here is to take one of the many taxis waiting at the dock, not book a driver from the hotel.

Our check-in procedure went smoothly and due to the fact we were there at 11 in the morning, we did not expect our room to be ready.  But they kindly gave us coupons for coffee at their coffee shop, and stored our luggage.  We did use Starwood points for our 2 night stay, and I always fear getting treated differently, but service was great.

Once in our room, I was highly disappointed.  The room was very small, the bed seemed to be sitting on the floor, there was only 1 window which was overlooking roofs, the bathroom sink was coming off the wall, there was no bathtub, very large shower, which we thought was once a bath tub with shower.  I would rate the room as average, for a European hotel.  It has been upgraded, but most likely not in 10-15 years, and the decor was very contemporary.

We only used the restaurant once, on the morning of our departure, and only because it was raining.  It is attached to the hotel lobby through a small corridor, giving the feeling it was not always part of the hotel.  On our morning visit, the room was crowded, so they sat us in the bar area.  This room is meant for evening drinking, not for eating.  Everytime we moved, the swivel chairs turned and hit the table, spilling our coffee (as careful as we attempted to be, this was unavoidable).  I feel most people had the expensive breakfast buffet included in their room rate, but we did not, so we ate off the menu.  On our previous morning we ate at the little restaurant on the side of the street.  The food was much better there than at the hotel restaurant, for 1/3 the price.  With all the quint restaurants around, this one seemed to cater solely to the hotel, not the off the street tourist.

The total picture, with good service, great location, average rooms, and poor food brings the rating to average.",3,2012,10,25
37,Great hotel,"I loved this hotel and highly recommend it. A perfect location on La Ramblas.
Very very  clean and cheerful decor. On our second night they sent a bowl of fruits and flowers to our room which was a extra special touch that made our day. The next night they sent Hermes colone. In the bathroom they had hair straighteners as well as the hairdryer and I thought that was a brilliant idea. 
The walk in closet was large and had an iron and ironing board.
They said that free wifi is only available in the lobby but we could get in the room.
The consiairge was very helpful and polite.",5,2012,10,24
37,Great Introduction to Barcelona,"We were booked into the hotel as part of an APT package tour. We arrived early so could not access the room till mid afternoon (we were advised of this coming in from the airport) but the staff did everything they could to get us in to our rooms as soon as possible. Room very quiet (it did not overlook La Rambla) and very spacious with plenty of storage space and great facilities. The hotel is in a first class location - plenty of good eating places around away from the tourist traps of the main strip and close to Placa de Catalunya to access all transport options including the hop on hop off bus. There were several tour groups in on our first morning and they were badly understaffed for breakfast in the restaurant. Most tables were not cleared, food was not replenished and lots of people lined up to get in. I cleared a table to sit at and in all fairness after a time extra staff were obviously pulled in from other parts of the hotel to get things working. It was not an issue the other three mornings. Level of service and facilities are what you would expect from a property with this rating",4,2012,10,24
37,Did Not Feel 5 Stars,"This was a nice hotel right off of Las Ramblas.  It was a good location.  We had really high hopes for a five star experience but instead the hotel felt very corporate.  The staff was nice but did not go out of their way to help us or make us feel welcome.  When we asked for ideas on restaurants and bars, it seemed like everyone was from somewhere else and only had the most touristy of suggestions.  

The bed was really two beds put together and had a support that stuck out from the bottom which our toes hit all the time.  Breakfast was nice.  We liked the beginning fruit shots that they gave to us.  Maybe because it was a buffet, it was hard to get attention when you wanted more coffee or to have a plate cleared.

The sunset happy hour was exactly 5 minutes long.  It is really easy to miss.",3,2012,10,22
37,A Solid 4-Star Hotel,"ROOM:
My husband and I stayed in the junior suite and enjoyed the size of the room, modern design, comfortable bed, and beautiful shower.  There is plenty of storage/closet space for suitcases and good lighting in the room.  Our room also had a wall-mounted T.V. in the bathroom.  

BREAKFAST:
We really enjoyed the daily breakfast offered in the hotel restaurant, but wished that the food choices would change after a few days.  After eating the same breakfast for 3 days, we began to get bored of the food.  Nevertheless, the breakfast buffet options at Le Meridien were good compared to what we ate in the Madrid hotel we stayed in (see my Mercure Hotel review).  Our favorite breakfast food options at Le Meridien include:  churros with chocolate, made-to-order eggs prepared by a cook, fresh fruits (such as the pomegranite seeds), and sauteed mushrooms.  

OVERALL SERVICE:
With regard to service, I'd say that overall customer service was good, but not excellent.  We weren't very impressed with the housekeeper/room cleaning service.  We had 3 large empty water bottles on the table, which the housekeeper did not throw away.   The hotel-provided toiletries on our bathroom shelf were not properly replaced/organized.  While this may not seem like an issue, we expect that housekeeping perform these duties in a 4 - 5 star hotel. Also, upon check-out, we asked front desk to contact a taxi to bring us to the train station.  The taxi driver who arrived was a hot-head who drove like a mad-man and ripped us off.  Upon arriving to the train station, the taxi driver immediately turned-off his meter so we couldn't see the price.  He then charged us 20 euros for the short 10 minute ride.... I would recommend that the Le Meridien do more research on the taxi drivers/company they do business with so that other tourists do not get ripped-off.",4,2012,10,22
37,Great Hotel in the middle of old Barcelona,"Sure check in can take a bit but everthing else was fantastic.  The hotel is right on the corner of a pedestrian mall type of street in an area (la rambla) that gets PACKED, like times squre packed which really surpirsed me but its so near so many cool things to do and resturants that I guess I was being nieve.  Short walk to huge open air market with all kinds of catalan foods,  close to the catherdral where I lucked into a food and wine fair.  Easy to get a cab but hotel is close to major train station so its easy to get around.  Room nice sized for europe with comfortable bed.  My bed never had a sheet only the duvet which was oddly really long,I guess thats how they do it there.  Resturant breakfast not good but lunch, dinner are great.  Great shower.  Helpful and friendly staff invited me to a cooking class and gave us complimenrtey cava each night before going out.  Will stay here again.

I never used the spa or pool (if they have one doubt it). But cant figure out how to clear those rating.",4,2012,10,21
37,Bienvenidos!,"Perfect location we had room 110 which overlooked Las Ramblas on the first floor with a big picture window. Upon the check in the staff were very welcoming, friendly and efficient, giving a good vibe.
The hotel is very chic and modern and the bedroom mirrored this, having the signature Heavenly bed and very nice shower/bathtub. 
We did wonder if it would be a little noisy so close to the street, but this wasn't the case at all and we slept soundly.
We ate in the restaurant CentOnze (111) we had a first class meal with very good attentive service and I had the best fillet steak ever.
This hotel is a wonderful way to see the beautiful city of Barcelona.",5,2012,10,20
37,Poor Service for a 5*,"I can see this hotel has pretty high reviews generally, but i'm sorry that wasn't my experience.

I found it noisy - could hear next door and room above - i also felt the vibrations of the underground train system - perhaps i was just unlucky with room location/neighbours.

Reception is crowded , too long to check in - 15 minutes,  and staff don't appear to have a good understanding of the hotel layout - i was told there was no room above mine ,  - there was !,
(and that was after receptionist had to go to the back to look at a map after i asked the question...!)

A small thing, but the white wall behind reception is dirty and flaked paint - it's a small thing, but i think you can immediately judge the standard of a hotel by attention to such detail - How can the management of a 5* hotel not notice /remidy this? This was reflictive to the standard in the room i had too.

If you are an SPG Plat member - you can expect a bottle of water to be sent to your room! (the previous day i was at the Sheraton/Dusseldorf - a 4* hotel - they send fruit/snacks+water! a very good hotel by the way)
Even though my SPG number was in my reservation, no room appeared to be pre allocated for me.

My Luggage was lost by the airline , I had a Spanish number to call for any updates - I asked reception to help me , they sent me to the concierge - i waited 5 minutes, nobody came - i asked the doorman if someone was coming soon, he said ""no"", so i went back to reception and waited another 10 minutes for help - Bag wasn't found - i wasn't offered any additional tolietries (the room doesn't even have a toothbrush!) - the same thing happenned before at the W in H K  (also a Starwood hotel) and they couldn't do enough!! - without asking, they chased/followed up my lost bag for two days until it was located - This is great service!

Finally, on checking out - i asked for a taxi - at the airport the driver charged an additional 10 euro on top of the meter, i asked what it was for - he said 5 for the hotel commission and 5 for the bag (my briefcase only as luggae was lost as mentioned) i'm sure it wasn't true, but hotel should be careful with the taxi company they use, or at least warn the guests in advance.

Overall, poor service, poor experience. Hotel is busy so doesn't make an effort - i definately wouldn't return.",2,2012,10,20
37,perfect location,"Comfortable bed, perfect shower. Excellent expresso bar in the lobby. Computers available free of charge in the computer room downstairs. Staff was courteous and helpful.  Was however disappointed with supper at their restaurant.",4,2012,10,18
37,Perfection!,Loved our stay here. Location was ideal - right off la ramblas. The service is top notch and the amenities are fantastic. The rooms are big by European standards and luxurious. The bathrooms are also gorgeous - Best shower of my life!,5,2012,10,18
37,One of the best service experience in a Hotel ever!!!,"Awesome service!!!  Impecable!!!!  Even the laundry service was very good.  The staff was very well mannered and educated.  One of my top 3 hotel experiences, service wise, ever.  The location is very good, 2 blocks from Plaça Catalunya.  Ramblas can be noisy, but the property and service are so good one must realize that few things are perfect.",5,2012,10,17
37,Not even a Guest....,"Recently, 2 friends and I were visiting Barcelona and stayed at a reduced price hotel, not far from the Meridien! On our first night, we dined in the ""Cent111onze "" restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the service rendored. As a result, we went back 2 more days in a row to enjoy the appetizers, cocktails and great service. In additon, we encountered some travel problems and we were graciously assisted by the Consierge to resolve them..... even though it wasn't an expectation because we were not registered guests at their hotel. She went ""above and beyond"" for us and I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona. They will definitely take care of you and ensure that your stay is pleasant!!",5,2012,10,17
37,"Location, location, location ...","Le Meridien's location is, honesty, what's it's all about!  The recently rennovated rooms are nice, as is the bedding, and the new baths are modern and border on being elegant, but the Le Meridien, overall, seems to have a bit of difficulty in getting things all together.  Some of the front desk staff, while accommodating, had to bring in more senior types to help on reservation coding,, room availability etc.  And the newly rennovated and tiny ultra-modern lobby (not to my personal taste!) is far too diminutive for a hotel of this size, creating havoc at busy times for both staff and arriving or departing guests.  (Note: friends staying across the street at the Hotel 1898 thought it was spendid, gracious and devoid of our problems.)",4,2012,10,16
37,Good hotel overall,"We stayed 3 nights at the hotel as it was part of the package provided by APT with whom we were going to be cruising the Rhone River in the south of France.  3 nights in Barcelona is the start of the package. 
Our room was comfortable and clean, with a great bathroom.  The ironing board/trouser press along with a kettle, cups, tea and coffee were concealed on one side of the largish robe and finding them was a ""bonus"" as far as we were concerned since both had been lacking at the other hotels in which we had stayed while travelling independently in Spain. 
The location is excellent - right on La Ramblas so it made sightseeing very easy.  Our room was at the rear of the hotel, so no great view BUT it was quiet at night.  We did find the pillows to be uncomfortable, however,  My husband appreciated the automatic night light that would come on as he staggered out of bed to go to the toilet during the night...... and so did I, since it meant I wasn't being disturbed because of a bright light being turned on.
The first morning we went down to breakfast and the organisation within the restaurant was very bad.  There were other large groups staying in the hotel and with the groups all having excursions planned for the morning, a large number of people were wanting breakfast at the same time and the restaurant staff appeared to be completely overwhelmed.  We were told to sit and wait in the adjoining bar area and we had a clear view into the restaurant and noticed many empty tables that had not been cleared and reset which was why there were such long delays to get into the restaurant.  I asked the young woman who appeared to be the maitre d why they hadn't set up on the tables in adjoining bar area where we were all sitting as we waited because it was only a few metres extra to walk to and from the buffet set up in the restaurant area.  The hotel must have known about the large number of guests who would be needing an early breakfast that morning and should have done this, or put on extra bus boys to clear and reset the tables so that people could be quickly brought into the restaurant area.  In fact, there were tables that were never cleared and reset the entire time we were waiting and during the time we were finally in the restaurant area for breakfast.  The next 2 mornings the adjoining bar area was set up for breakfast and there were no delays in getting breakfast. The breakfast was adequate but nothing ""brilliant"".   We didn't dine in the restaurant at any other time.
Overall, a good hotel that appeared to have learnt it's lesson after the chaos of the 1st morning.",4,2012,10,15
37,Very Nice Hotel - Excellent Location,"We recently spent our 20th Anniversary at the Le Meridien and were very pleased. The room was very nice and stylish. Clean, plush bedding, nice amenities (3 TVs one in the bathroom mirror, robes, slippers, umbrella, blow dryer and flat iron, ironing board, 110 & 120 volt electrical outlets, free wifi, cordless phones, iron & ironing board, refrigerator space, just everything a traveler would need. The breakfast buffet was top notch and the service was superb. The location was perfect and convenient to everything.",4,2012,10,15
37,Great choice,"We stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for 2 nights after a Mediterranean cruise.  It was the perfect ending to an incredible trip.  We are Starwood gold members who were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a gorgeous marble bathroom.  Everyone was very friendly & helpful - we even received a wonderful tapas restaurant recommendation from one of the girls at the front desk. We also had dinner & breakfast in the hotel's restaurant which we enjoyed & thought to be good value, as well.  The location couldn't have been better! Although the hotel is right on La Rambla, our room was around the corner & very quiet.  We were also a short walk from the hop-on & off buses as well as the Gothic district.  All in all, a great choice to wind up our wonderful trip!",5,2012,10,14
37,stylish,"Even in winter Barcelona is busy. the hotel is centrally located on the La Rambla the main street of Barcelona and next to the Market. Lovely rooms, stylish decor and colors. Very helpful staff and nice breakfast.",5,2012,10,14
37,Short stay before the cruise,"Stayed at the Le Meridien a couple of nights before a cruise.  The hotel is located on La Ramblas, so it's a busy place and pretty noisy, especially when you have a room on the 2nd floor facing the street.  The room is very nice, the bed is comfortable, although no top sheet on it, which my wife thought was ""gross"", since they don't was the the duvet cover each time a guest leaves.  Lighting in the room was cool, especially the night lights, when you get out of bed there are blue lights that illuminate near the floor to help you see.  I guess we had an ""upgraded"" room for being a SPG Gold member, that's what I was told anyway.  The bathroom seemed to be upgraded, dark tiles all over, nice glass door, rainfall shower head, etc.  As an American, not much in way of ""free"" TV, but many movies available for a price.  I brought some power adapters with me, but the outlets I saw around the room were sunken into the wall about an inch, and my adapters would not fit in the sunken hole, out well, good thing we were only here a couple of nights, plenty of battery power.  I was able to use the ""shavers only"" power in the bathroom to charge a camera battery.  Overall, a decent experience.",4,2012,10,12
37,Twice a winner,"I have stayed twice at the Barcelona Le Meridien, once before a cruise and another time for 5 nights. Loved both experiences. Having traveled solo both times, I like the location and wandering around Las Ramblas, experiencing the market and little shops. Did not eat in the hotel as I preferred the little bakeries for breakfast. On Pintor Fortuny, the side street, there are lots of little restaurants as well. But the Le Meridien has great service, amazing rooms, the most comfortable beds and the best shower in town. Going to try another hotel this coming year due to price, but I will always cherish the LeMeridien Barcelona and hope to stay there again. It is expensive.",5,2012,10,11
37,"Ok hotel, will not stay there again.","Good location, right at Las Ramblas, but not very accommodating.  The rooms were average and I have nothing extraordinary to say at this supposedly 4 or 5 star hotel.  We had 2 nights there but in between nights, we were going to another city and we asked if we could store our 2 pieces of luggages there until we return the next day for the 2nd night and we were told that they couldn't.  i found that surprising because all of the hotels we had stayed at and had that situation, they were able to do it.  After talking to the manager, they took one of the 2 pieces we had, but still was uncomfortable.",3,2012,10,11
37,Nice location,"We had a difficult time finding a reasonably priced hotel in Barcelona and finally were able to secure a great rate at Le Meridien.  The location of the hotel is right in the heart of touristy Las Ramblas; the location made it very easy to get around without having to rely on taxis and public transportation.  The room was very tiny and had a strange rubbery smell.  The television was extremely difficult to figure out, we had to call the front desk twice to troubleshoot.  The first time, a gentleman came to the room to turn the tv on, he had to adjust the light dimmer to power on the tv??  The second time, we were told that to power on the tv, you have to hit a channel number instead of the power button.  Hoping this was an isolated incident as there should be instructions provided otherwise.  However, the beds were comfortable and the shower was great!",3,2012,10,08
37,"Great location, terrible staff. There must be something better in Barcelona...","Just checked in at the Meridien. I've stayed here many times before so know the hotel and what to expect. The main attraction of the hotel has always been its location although this time the check in was so painful that I believe there must be better options in Barcelona. Being an SPG Platinium I was expecting to be offered a welcome amenity and late check out, only to be told that because I had booked through a travel agent I was not eligible. I explained that this was not the case (travel agent always books my stays) and she should check. She refused and being tired I told her I'd take the room and call SPG. I did and after 15' on the phone with SPG I confirmed I was eligible and had a call from the front desk manager with a weak apology and no offer for compensation (not even the price of the phone call I had to make). Unfortunately very atipical of SPG worldwide but not inconsistent with previous experiences in this hotel. My impression is that they know the main attraction is their location and take the rest for granted. On to the room, it is appropriate but nothing exceptional. TV is very small for the size of the room. Bathroom hasn't been upgraded in a while. On bright star was the bell-boy who apologised for the attitude of the check-in staff. Kudos to you! This said, he did bring my suitcase to my room and didn't even put in on the little folding table. Not very 4 or 5 stars. Oh well... All of this is very unfortunate and it gives me a reason to try something else the next time I'm in BCA.",2,2012,10,07
37,In the heart if Barcelona,"A relatively small property just off Ramblas and in easy walking distance of many of Barcelona's wonderful sights. Rooms are quite spacious and the service is very friendly and spacious. Restaurant is fine, but there are more original places to eat than there. Wifi is quite expensive.",4,2012,10,07
37,Location location location,"Really what I am looking for is location. The 4 stars is for location mainly. I like the fact it's the center of town. Free tickets to the Modern Art museum, free cappachino coupon. Nice size room with all the amenities I needed. Quiet room even though it's so close to La Ramblas. No line for check in though check in process was less than smooth ex. asked for passport twice, note when she gave me the passport back I asked can I put these away and she said yes. And 3 minutes later she asked for the passports again because 1st time she did not copy down info, just looked at them??? I would be expecting a smoother check in then what I experience from a 5 star hotel.",4,2012,10,02
37,overpriced,"We recently stayed at this hotel and found it to be VERY overpriced.  It has a good location
but that's about it.  From the moment we registered-15 minutes in line, one hour to get luggage to room, only one SPA robe, lighting problems, dirty rug etc, we continued to be shocked that
this was considered to be a 5 star hotel.  NOT!! The Hotel Montecarlo across the way was
much nicer and cheaper!! Don't waste your money.",2,2012,09,30
37,In the heart of everything.....,"The Le Meridien Hotel is right on the las Ramblas.....that's the good and the bad. At times it can be just over whelming place to be especially during soccer games as everyone heads to the ramblas. The hotel is somewhere between an upscale hotel that is and wants to be. I left there not know which way I felt. The staff was accomodating but honestly during the time I was there they were packed and so even though I am a starwood gold member, they said that there was nothing they could do to put me in a larger room. However, when I offered them more points, oh amazingly they had all kinds of options. For my standards therefore, the normal deluxe rooms are too small and the bathrooms as well. Barcelona is a crazy place and filled with all kinds of people so if you stay here you need to be very aware of your surroundings. As it is on the Ramblas you will have all kinds of people here trying to take your money and offer you things, late at night especially. However, it is a great location to sightsee and to walk from to see parts of the old town. It is two blocks to the famous market and that is a great place to get something to eat. 
As it was my first trip to Barcelona I discovered a lot that I will use on my return. For my taste, I would probably stay in the Eixample area like the Omm Hotel which has a great bar on the roof with amazing views of the city. Its more of the high end area of Barcelona and away from the maddening crowds of Las Rambla yet only a five minute subway ride. One other piece of advice....avoid Spain in August! Brutually hot and Barcelona is very humid.",3,2012,09,26
37,We Loved The Bathroom!,"Overall, we were a little disappointed with this hotel. While it's location was great we found the staff average and the room mediocre {aside from the bathroom, which was spectacular!}. We arrived for a few days post cruise and were there early, naturally our room was not ready. However, when we returned and it was PAST normal check in time, the front desk acted like they were doing us a favor in giving us our room. When it came to finding out about making calls they were a little all over the place and not very knowledgable about their own hotels policies. If we decide to visit Barcelona again we would definitely try somewhere new.",3,2012,09,25
37,Amazing experience!,Beautiful hotel and the room was really modern and wonderful and CLEAN!  The spa is super small and I had a massage treatment that was pretty good.  The hotel is in the most amazing location.  One of the best hotels I was in when I was in Europe! I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!,5,2012,09,25
37,Perfect hotel and location in Barcelona,We stayed at Le Meridien for 2 nights in September 2012.  Le Meridien is right on La Rambla is a very nice part of the street.  Great walking area.  Nice stroll to the port area.  Many great restaurants to choose from.  Our room 341 was on the back of the hotel and very quiet.  The usual excellent amenities you expect from Le Meridien.  Great bed and linens.  Fantastic shower and bathroom with ample counter space.  Walter at the front desk went out of his way to help us.  All of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  We were there during the biggest festival of the year and could watch the parade go by from the lobby.  Taxi ride to the airport early on Monday took less than 30 minutes for 38 euros.,5,2012,09,25
37,Average - I expected more,"We are currently staying at Le Meridien. The location is obviously excellent. The woman who checked us in was friendly. We are SPG gold and did not receive any upgrade. The room is clean and comfortable. We are not facing Las Ramblas and there is no street noise. The gym is small and dated. The spa is also very small. I booked a treatment. If the therapists are in a session, there is no one to greet guests. I thought at first I was in the wrong place. The sauna and steam room are coed. My husband and I booked two rooms using our points, as we are traveling with friends. We are both SPG gold members, but were told by the less friendly receptionist checking our friends in that the second room could not receive the Gold amenity of free internet unless my husband or I split up and one of us stayed in the second room. We said fine. This is ridiculous considering it does not cost the hotel any additional money to offer Internet. Overall, I expected more from the Le Meridien brand. I travel extensively. Maybe I have been spoiled by excellent genuinely friendly service in other hotels. Le Meridienis adequate but I would not stay again. ",3,2012,09,24
37,"Location, location, location","This is the perfect hotel for the first time sightseer in Barcelona.  I cashed in Starwood points and used suite upgrades for a recent stay in Barcelona prior to a Med cruise (making cost no issue; hotel rates are comparable to upscale hotels in the area).  It is a very nice hotel with an ideal location.  Our prestige suite was wonderful.  Large and roomy, especially for a European hotel, our suite had a living area window overlooking Las Ramblas.  The Catalunya metro station, from where you can get to nearly any point of interest in Barcelona, is just a short walk.  The market Mercat de Sant Josep/ La Boqueria is also just a short walk.  An added benefit of which we took full advantage was a Carrefour practically next door.  In addition to snacks, we picked up beverages including wine.  There was a delicious Carrefour brand limonada (quite tangy with 17% lemon juice) that we kept stopping back to purchase.  As for hotel services, there is a dining room where we had a very nice, but not inexpensive, buffet breakfast.  The restaurant also serves lunch and dinner at comparably reasonable prices for Las Ramblas.  There is also a coffee shop attached to the hotel lobby for beverages and light continental breakfast items.  The front desk staff is multi-lingual and very nice and housekeeping service was performed twice daily.  If you want a beach hotel, go for the W.  But if you want a base from which to sightsee Barcelona, there may not be a better choice.",5,2012,09,23
37,"Comfort, class and atmosphere at le Meridien on rambla street","It has always been a plan for my family and I to visit beautiful Barcelona. We reside in Dubai, where there is no shortage of gorgeous and luxurious hotels. In early July 2012 Emirates Airlines started their direct flights from Dubai to Barcelona and that was the perfect excuse we needed to visit Spain. Easy and convenient. We were fortunate to be on the first direct weekly flight and it was an amazing journey, the atmosphere on the plane was festive and relaxed..

Naturally we had to stay somewhere and when asking our friends and colleagues where to go in Barcelona, they all recommended to stay as close to RAMBLA street as possible. Its the heart of Barcelona and center of all the action. So it was an easy online search through one of our favorite brand  ""le meridian"" where we found the property. So we quickly made our booking and confirmed 2 rooms; one for my wife and I a deluxe room and the other a standard room for our 2 children. 

The property was clean, classy and perfectly located in the heart of Rambla street... The check in was very smooth and easy. The staff were so courteous and even had conversation with our kids to make them feel special. As we had a rental car, the concierge took our car to the underground parking which was secure and quite handy since there is like NO parking in that area, so having your own space come in very handy, so don't worry if you are driving... 

The rooms were fantastic, very modern with all amenities that you can need. The beds are supper comfortable, soft and spacious. The nice thing is their Eco-conscience service to save on washing of the linens & towels, which I always care about. Our kids twin room was equally comfortable (albeit slightly smaller as it was a standard). we also ordered room service and the staff were quite friendly. unfortunately our order came quite late and the staff immediately informed us that the meal will be ""complementary"" due to lateness. We had not even commented on the lateness and it was a pro-active action by the F&B department to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied... needless to say the food was delicious.

The atmosphere in the hotel is like a modern art lounge ""Jazy"" and my goodness the atmosphere on RAMBLA Street can not be easily put into words... let me simply say ""ITS SUPER LIVELY"" and being right on in the middle of it made our stay at Le Meridian and visit just super enjoyable.. Each day we only had to simply walk out of the main entrance and 'Voila' onto the lively and social atmosphere of Rambla. people walking, talking, and looking great, We found various cafes to have our breakfast and lunches.. we opted to skip most dinners... one of our favorite spots was right across the street. I recommend you explore the area and especially side street to find cozy little bistro restaurants to eat in.

The area surrounding Rambla and Le Meridian is alive with restaurants, museums, amazing stylish shops, art galleries, history, cafes, and bars... you will not get bored for a single minute and everything within a short 1-4KM walking distances form the Hotel... We visited the Picasso Museum which I highly recommend... and enjoyed pizza at a small dinner. to be honest after a few days of Tapas, as delicious as it is... we started to get tired of it...

If you get a chance go visit the Barcelona football club and stadium... WOW.. that all i can say about it.. 

Overall the entire experience of Le Meridian and Rambla street made Barcelona one of the most memorable stays we have enjoyed. I have to give it a 9 out of 10.

Thank you to all",5,2012,09,23
37,Great Location on Las Ramblas,"We wanted to stay in the city center, and wanted a name we could trust, and chose Le Meridien, and couldn't have been happier! Although it is right in the center of all the action and craziness of Las Ramblas, Le Meridien offers a true oasis of calm and relaxation. The room was on the small side, which is expected in Europe, but was tastefully appointed, and had the one of the best showers around. The hotel was a few dollars more than most of the others in the area, but well worth it in our opinion. The location truly can't be beat!",5,2012,09,22
37,Le Meridien: A very good hotel with an excellent location,"Le Meridien has a great location just off La Ramblas in Barcelona making it a good choice if you want to be within easy walking distance of the old town, cathedral, and many good restaurants. The standard is very good. I was upgraded to a suite with a large balcony suitable for sunbathing or sitting out at a long table. The balcony actually had its own outdoor shower (although no special view). The room was huge with little left wanting, and plenty of space to entertain. I believe it was suite 617. At check-in I was informed that I was lucky to get this room. No kidding. Unfortunately, I checked in late and out early so I cannot comment on the restaurants. The staff were helpful and friendly. Internet was fine, and the connection also allows you to send print jobs from your room (should you need to do a little work). Overall, it is a very high standard. El Palace is more luxurious, but I like Le Meridien's location (and suite 617).",5,2012,09,19
37,Little touches and a great staff,"We just returned from our first visit to Barcelona and I must say that this hotel made it a memorable week. Yes, like everyone else has mentioned it has a fabulous location near the Ramblas and a block from the boqueria. But lots of hotels offer location...what made this hotel something worth writing about was the service. Right from the beginning, the front desk staff welcomed us warmly with and a complimentary capuccino at the coffee bar in the lobby. Bruno (at the concierge desk) never steered us wrong, whether it was a recommendation for dinner or a day trip. Other extras: International Herald Tribune every day, featherweight comforters in our extra-quiet rooms and a complimentary paella lunch that was tremendous. (We are Starwood members, so I know that not everyone will get these perks). Still, whether you are a Starwood member or not, I'd find a way to make the Meridian your base...even if it means you have to cut a day or two off your vacation to afford it. You'll be glad you did.",5,2012,09,19
37,Hot Holiday,"We had a few days  (during a heat wave) at this very good hotel right in the centre of the Ramblas tourist area. Fortunatelaty the room was airconditioned and quite well fitted out. Although showing signs of age, it was very well maintained and the double insulated windows kept all noise out. The staff were very friendly, proffessional and efficent. We had no problem being English speakers, most of the staff could comminucate in English, incluiding house keepers. Food in the hotel was very good. We also found a nice little bakery just around the back (right then left out the front door). There are a lot of little eateries nearby but avoid those on La Ramblas which are comparatively expensive. Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2012,09,12
37,Great experience 8/15-8/17,"5* experience.. Very friendly staff, clean room, and extremely friendly. Concierge was very helpful. The restaurant next door was exceptional. Could not ask for better location on the Rambla. and the boqueria.",5,2012,09,12
37,Great Location,"A wonderful location for seeing some of the sights of Barcelona.  The hotel is right on the well-known Ramblas with its street entertainers, artists and cafes. (Windows were well soundproofed so noise was not an issue.) A block away is the Bocaria, probably the best open air market in the world. The Gothic quarter is virtually across the street, Placa Catalunya is blocks away, short cab rides to the Sagrada Familia, etc. Aside from a great location, the hotel is clean, modern and secure.  Staff was very helpful with maps, schedules for metro and the like.  We liked the artwork in the halls, among other nice touches.  Our room, a suite, was very comfortable.  So were the beds - slept really well here. Friends who stayed with us in the same hotel also liked it.",5,2012,09,10
37,Business hotel,"I stayed recently in the hotel during a company meeting. Hotel was, nicely located... although Rambla is not a quiet and/or clean place in Barcelona.... Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was also nice. On contrary the room. just average. Far not the expected level. And the view - on the back of the hotel.... disappointing. For the price I paid I expected more.",4,2012,09,07
37,"Great location, Great hotel","Great location, great hotel, a little noisy but that's part of the deal if you want to be on Ramblas! 
Staff was very nice and professional, and had great suggestions for restaurants and activities. I would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,09,07
37,Great hotel great location,"The shower is just incredible! The hotel staff friendly and helpfull.  They gave us quite a few differenent coupons at checkin (we only used the coffee in the lobby one).  For our first time in Spain the location was perfect. We walked up and down La Ramblas and it was close to the Market where we got fruit for breakfast daily.  It was close to La Catalynia metro when we needed it, but otherwise we walked everywhere (to the beach to the gothic and born and gracias areas).  The hotel is clean, quiet and comfortable, even thought it is on an incredible busy street.  The room was small-average size with a large bathroom.

We got it for a great price using priceline.",5,2012,09,04
37,by far the best,"Thank you very much for your kind hospitality... The team has been great and everyone has been how helpful! Thank you patricia, Walter, the front desk team, the breakfast team for a great breakfast and for the concierge team for the great tips... My stay has been a great one!

The location is great. Close to everything! 
The breakfast is just too good to be true. very tasty and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. 

The internet connection in the lobby is free and the speed of the free Internet is great.
Ask the concierge for anything and they will do it for you... There tips are great.

All in all, the hotel is great and will stay here again when I am back next summer",5,2012,09,04
37,Nice Hotel in the middle of it all,"I loved the location of this hotel. There were fabulous tourist and local places to eat a stones throw distance away from the door of the hotel. The hotel staff are very kind, courteous and helpful. The hotel lobby is very small but the staff manage to provide the best service for the crampness of it all. I think the concierge needs more personal space as at check out that space is overcrowded. The bed was confortable the room served it's purpose in style and comfort however the windows do not open all the way and they had bars. I wonder if someone has fallen out at some point but it takes away from the room to not be able to see the view of the strees and shops and such. Overall, I will go directly back to this hotel on my next trip to Barcelona.",4,2012,09,03
37,Fantastic hotel!,We loved this hotel.  This was our third time visiting Barcelona.  The hotel is in a very central location.  The rooms are beautiful.  The beds are extremely comfortable & they have amazing down comforter & pillows.  The bathroom & shower is terrific.  Everyone who works here is really nice.,5,2012,09,01
37,Big Fan and you wont be disappointed,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and have never been disappointed
As an spg member I hve always bee upgraded and given the utmost attention
The staff is superb
the rooms are clean and up to date and the best part is the location
you can walk everywhere 
You are on Las ramblas and within 10 minutes of most places you want to visit 
too many to mention
Our favorite Tapas restaurant in the world was reccommended by the concierge and is one of the reasons we keep going back to Barcelona (unfortunately I dont remember the name but I know how to walk there). It sthe only place to stay. I will be there again on Oct 2012",5,2012,08,30
37,Great Hotel,"My girlfriend and I are spending 5 days at the LeMeridien Barcelona. We are very happy with our hotel choice.

Location: This hotel has a great location on Las Ramblas. Yes it is crowded, yes it is a tourist area, but you can walk to a lot of places. The location is great.

Service: The service at this hotel is what makes a huge difference. Vera and Gigi are very nice at the front desk. Everyone speaks English perfectly which is a big thing for me since I cannot speak Spanish. Montse the reservation manager is great. Ana, the public relations manager puts on a wonderful lunch on Thursday's for SPG members. It includes sangria, paella, iberian ham and dessert. Walter, the front office manager is delightful. He is very accomodating and will go out of his way to assist a guest in anyway possible. 

Rooms: The rooms are clean and modern. We had a deluxe king. The rooms are not large and space is at a premium. The bed is very comfortable, the tub is large and good for baths. The only downside is the size. This hotel is very busy from April to October so upgrades are hard, but Walter always tries to take care of SPG Elite Members. 

Internet: It is 19 euros per day which is expensive, free if you are SPG Platinum.

Food: The restaurant food is very good, the breakfast buffet is 27 euros per person, also free for SPG Platinum members.

Overall, you can not go wrong staying here. This is a great LeMeridien and the service is better than most. I will definitely be back.",5,2012,08,30
37,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Thank You to  for giving me that amazing big room at your hotel.

It was a great place, especially the balcony – a few of us had some quiet drinks there one afternoon and really enjoyed the luxury!

Everyone on our tour commented on how good the Le Meridien and the service there is. It was the best experience I have had at any hotel.

We’ll be back!",5,2012,08,30
37,Top Notch,"Service and hospitality was top notch. Salvator at the front desk was extremely helpful making sure our family had a great stay. We will definitely return to Barcelona and stay at the Meridien. If you are an SPG member, you will definitely get recognition.",5,2012,08,29
37,Nice Stay at Le Meridien,"Had a 3 nt stay in Aug 2012.  Very well located on Las Ramblas.. little walk to the beach. its like staying in the heart of all the action.. was not able to use the other facilities at the hotel.. decent rooms. 
lobby is small as compared to other le meridiens..",4,2012,08,29
37,What a blast of Relaxation,"This hotel is by far my No. 1 most favorite hotel. for the following reasons.

The staff are courteous and if they are not able to help they will find a way to help, speaking with their supervisors who are in turn very good at listening with open mind and heart.

The service is impeccable: I sent a few shirts for cleaning, they came back as if they were Brand New, Wow, I've had cleaning services but that was no ordinary cleaning service.

The bed (oh my God) the bed so comfortable that you don't want to go out (beware you might miss Barcelona Attractions :-) ) just what you need after long walks to come back to that sweet bed and just relax...

The breakfast is varied and well thought through, the breads, cerial, fresh fruits, nuts, eggs prepared exactly to your liking, juices (although the orange juice could be a bit sweeter), mushrooms hmmmmm.

Cleanliness of the spaces all over the hotel, and that unique scent as you enter the hotel, beautiful, the elevators had sound effects, and sometimes just fab music:)

I checked-in in a suite and had an issue regarding a personal preference about the room, so speaking to the front desk, the nice lady informed me that there was no availability to move me on the day, the manager also spoke with me in a very professional cordial manner.  I took his word that he would try to move me if there was any chance, surely enough on the next day I was moved to a room that was just Fantastic.

I am very happy with the hotel management and its staff, they do what needs to be done to ensure you are content. Please be kind and be professional and  you will get the stars.

The hotel is just on ""Las Ramblas"" so you are in the action as you step out.  Behind the hotel there's a quaint little restaurant “Buenas Migas”, fantastic for an afternoon snack, but I digress. 

I realize some people on here have written unfavorable reviews; it's beyond me what they can notice, it might say more about the person than about the hotel, just like everywhere else.
If there's something that is not working be proactive and ask for what you need and be gentle and respectful and people will be motivated to help. That works almost all the time.

37,"Space, service and comfort","The extras such as large screen TV, auto night lights, large bathroom, superb service and the location of Le Meridien made our stay in Barcelona even more memorable.  The great restaurant with views out to Le Ramblas was an added bonus.",5,2012,08,23
37,"Less than I expected, but ok","We chose this hotel over Majestic where we had positive experience of staying because Majestic had some reconstruction works going on.  I was attracted by the brand of Le Meridient which was supposed to combine French sophistication with American efficiency.  I was disappointed right from the beginning.  Big lines at the reception to check in.  Ladies at the reception seem to be friendly and trying to help, but there is some evil working against them and they are losing the battle.  I spent a lot of time just to find out that check-in time is at 3pm.  That was hugely inconvenient.  We travelled with a child and wanted some rest at least at noon, but the room was not available until 3pm.  I am a seasoned and experienced traveller, but this is first time in my life when I got in such situation.

Air conditioning worked like hell in the lobby and my family complained every time we entered it.  Welcome cup of coffee mitigated five per cent of disappointment.  WiFi worked okay, not reallly great, and only at the lobby.  In room it was not available.

The room (we had a junior suite) was clean, but interior is a bit old.  I think that some refurbishment would certainly be of use.  Bathroom was quite shabby, although clean and always with nice toiletries.

The restaurant in the hotel had welcoming nice service, but food was just okay.  For a smaller price, you would get much much better paella at Emperador Restaurant near Museu d'Historia de Cataluniya.",3,2012,08,23
37,Rooms Stink,"Both my room and my colleague's room had a very bad smell, we had to open the windows the whole night. It should be a 3 star hotel and not a 5 star. The only thing going for this hotel is the location. The lobby is very basic.
Just don't bother even if you are an SPG members, even with the free points we were deceived.",1,2012,08,21
37,Great location,This hotel is centrally located on las ramblas which is lovely. Its a close walk to a lot of attractions. The hotel itself is just ok. The rooms are small and nothing special. There isn't a mini bar or room service at the hotel.,4,2012,08,19
37,A lot of great surprises,"We stayed here on vacation in mid July and loved the service here. Every night at 8, the manager walks around reception and gives guests a complimentary glass of champagne to ""celebrate the beginning of the night."" Not only this, but we came back the first night, hungry from walking and exploring all day, we found the perfect gift in our room - a huge stash of jambon iberico, crackers, fresh fruit (possibly from the ""Boqueria"", or market, down the street) and candy. 

The concierge gave a few great restaurant recommendations (friends who have been in Barcelona for a long time confirmed the choices). 

Only downside is that street facing rooms can be a bit noisy, though location on Ramblas is very convenient for shopping, food and drinks. 

Would love to stay here again!",4,2012,08,17
37,Great hotel very comfortable rooms great service,I book this this room using Priceline and could not be more pleased.  Our room was lovely and the staff were very attentive and helpful.  Shame there is no pool just a small hot tub that is not hot.  But very nice roof.  Would return again.,5,2012,08,17
37,Great Pre Cruise Hotel,"Stayed here two nights, one at the beginning and one at the end of our mediterranean cruise.  We are a family of 4 with 2 boys ages 16 and 12.  We had 2 rooms for each night.
The hotel is in a great location, right on La Rambla.  Since we were not familiar with Barcelona we enjoyed just strolling around knowing that our hotel was nearby if we needed to go back.  The staff was very accomodating and friendly.  I used the concierge to help us with tickets for La Segrada Familia when I was having trouble with the website.  Also the staff called taxis for us when we needed to go to the cruise port and the airport.  They were very helpful with our luggage There is a great business center on the basement level with free access to computers and printers.  The only con would be that I felt the rooms were a bit too modern and stark.  Also the bathrooms were very dark.  Overall though I would highly recommend this hotel due to the friendly staff and location.",4,2012,08,15
37,Magnificent!,"We were dissatisfied with another hotel and walked in off the street where we were shown around by a most helpful and personable receptionist, Anastasyia. Her professionalism inspired so much that we chose a' Mediterranean Suite' which was outstanding. The restaurant was good and most welcoming. We enjoyed our stay very much and didn't want to leave!",5,2012,08,14
37,Location is Great and Hotel is Rock Solid,"Le Meridien is a terrific spot.  The location of the hotel makes it (arguably) one of the best in Barcelona.  Right on La Rambla, close to La Boqueria, Palau Güell and Liceu.  The Metro stop is 1 block away from the hotel entrance.  It is truly an outstanding location.

The second great thing about the hotel are the concierges and the staff.  They were always extremely helpful.

Nice rooms, very clean, great shower with good water pressure.",4,2012,08,13
37,Fantastic Hotel in Amazing Location,"Our family of 5 just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.  We had 2 connecting rooms.  The location is outstanding and the rooms were fantastic.  The service was first class.  In particular, Salvador at the front desk went out of his way to make our stay memorable.  We would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2012,08,09
37,Solid Hotel,"A cross between a Westin and a W, the Le Meridien Barcelona is ideally located and offers excellent service, contemporary design and consistent food to its guests (service in the restaurant could be more attentive).  My partner and I stayed here before a three week cruise and were reminded how great a city Barcelona is and how great a brand ""Le Meridien"" can be.    

On La Rambla, the hotel is close to a wealth of shopping choices: chain stores, local markets and posh boutiques.  Be sure to walk to the water and explore the many side streets of the city.  The food in the restaurant is quite good as are the sangrias in the bar.  I ordered a ""white"" sangria and the bar staff was most accommodating in meeting my request.

Rooms are spacious and modern.  Try to get a room on the upper floors or away from La Rambla as noise from the street can be loud - this is especially important as workers take advantage of the ""cooler"" temperatures in the early morning.

Thanks for helping us adapt to the jet lag before heading on the cruise.",4,2012,08,07
37,A hotel you never want to leave,"I have been lucky enough to stay at this hotel many many times and I have never been disappointed. I first stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona as a kid and I soon fell in love with the long carpeted corridors, the big and beautiful staircase and the ever smiling and polite staff. During all my stays, which have been many along the years, I’ve grown even more appreciative of this hotel. Its location is incomparable, of course. The hotel public areas are beautiful and kept impeccable at all times of the day. All personnel are helpful and kind. I loved the classic atmosphere of the pre-refurbishment hotel but now I also love the modernity of the Le Meridien’s new look. The new bathrooms are incredible, taking a shower there is pure bliss, you have to try it! The rooms are comfortable and beds are great. Cent Onze is the hotel’s excellent restaurant, specially the breakfast buffet. One of the best things about staying at this hotel is the customer service provided which was unparalleled years ago and now it has only got better. One of my favourite parts of a Le Meridien stay is “The Ritual”: every evening in the lobby, a member of the hotel staff offers the guests a glass of Cava (Catalan champagne) to welcome guests to the Starwood experience. Le Meridien Barcelona is, in my opinion, one of the best hotel options out there, and the best hotel in Barcelona! I hope I get many more chances to enjoy the great quality of this hotel. My only complaint: that TERRIBLE elevator music!! Nevertheless, it’s a MUST!",5,2012,08,07
37,Location Location Location,"Perfect hotel if you want to explore the La Rambla and vicinity. Very close to open market, stores and plenty of resturaunts. We used this facility for our Pre-Cruise hotel and it was perfect. We used out points for the room, but I will say that the regualr rates are a little pricey. If being close to the La Rambla is what you are looking for then this is your place. If you want to stay in a little more local area with a smaller Rambla to stroll and near the beach look at the other starwood property the Four Points. We enjoyed both hotels very much.",5,2012,08,07
37,Every aspect except for Minibar Management was not bad,"The best thing of Le Meridien Barcelona is that in a very convenient location. Located in the heart of Ramblas, close to the city tour bus stops and subway stations.
Breakfast was more than the level of the average. Just one absurd thing, liquid medicine placed in the refrigerator has been removed. I asked the staff of front desk and housekeeping and the only answer was that it is assumed to be abandoned by Minibar Manager. Without any word of apology...",3,2012,08,07
37,"Great location, great rooms","We stayed at Le Meridien for the first few nights of our honeymoon. We stayed at many hotels over this trip, and this was our favorite! The location is excellent, right on La Rambla. While this street does get old, it also means that it is conveniently located to La Bouqueria, the Barri Gotic, and the red bus tour. We were able to walk EVERYWHERE!
The rooms were modern, clean, and spacious. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom (always the deal breaker for me) was big and modern, and the shower was also a favorite! There is free wifi in the rooms, which is rare in a nicer hotel. These are the kind of extra details that I appreciate as a traveler.",5,2012,08,06
37,Perfect hotel,"This hotel is located on La Ramblas and was perfect for our 5 night stay in Barcelona. We stayed in a deluxe room which was an excellent size with a large bathroom (really good shower). The room has everything you need but because of there being so much to do you spend very little time actually in your room. The modern room has all the facilities you could possibly need, was kept clean, had good air conditioning and had plenty of space to store belongings including a good size wardrobe, draws and a safe. We arrived at the hotel before our room was ready so the hotel stored our luggage whilst we went our for a couple of hours and by the time we came back it was ready.The hotel also stored our luggage on our final day whilst we were out as our flight was not until the evening.",5,2012,08,05
37,Barcelona center,"Great location - great bell service took the bags and car perfect - check in was like trying to get into eastern europe at a check point - 20 mins of questions, come on starwood.

Paid 35 euros per day for high speed internet, worked from noon until 6 pm, could not get into icloud, business center was bad, could not print, the machine to allow you to pay was not working.

The room I booked a med suite on the net it said 98 sqm, looking forward to a big room, the room was 20 sqm, the bathroom and changing room 20 sqm and the terrace 60 sqm, and the room was smelling from smoking. 

The films, got charged even when they stopped in the middle.

The lobby was like a bus station, the hotel and rooms were cold, our room was painted dark brown, very sad and cold.

Would I stay there again - no.",2,2012,08,02
37,"Great location, adequate hotel","Staying in a hotel located on La Ramblas is a must in Barcelona if you want to be in the middle of everything, but there are many other hotels that offer the same location for a lot less money.  While the basic room is very nice and certainly large enough, especially for European hotel rooms, I had a terrible time with the low furniture.  I have bad knees after a bad accident almost 30 years ago, and I could hardly get out of the bed because it was so low to the floor.  The low bed went along with the modern decor of the room and the lobby, but after walking around all day, I didn't need the added inconvenience of trying to find something to help me pull myself out of the bed.  The bed itself was very comfortable, just hard to get out of.  The desk chair was the only place I could sit where I could easily get up.  My room did not have some of the amenities described in Le Meridien's website for a deluxe room, such as the night lighting.  The bathroom was a decent size, but certainly not big.  Also, half of the bathroom walls were frosted glass that was semi-see through.  Personally, I prefer to have complete privacy in the bathroom.  Our travel agent negotiated including breakfast with our rooms for our group.  The food was good, but even after asking for hot coffee every single morning, the best I could get was reasonably warm coffee.",4,2012,08,02
37,Great Location but not 5 star!,"As a SPG Platinum member, I have always stayed loyal to the brand wherever I go, wherever they have had a hotel. We stayed at the Le Meridien for 3 days prior in July and experienced less than what I have come to expect from this brand. 

First up, we booked the rooms many months in advance and tried to use our SPG Suite upgrades (notified them at least 3 months ahead of time), to secure at least 1 upgrade. C'mon Starwood, what's the point of awarding Suite upgrades if no hotel will honour them !!??

5-6 days before our arrival, they sent a message saying  that they are still working on it (not a good sign) and again, despite requesting an early check in for at least 1 room (we had booked 4!), we were told that they could offer a room for the morning for an additional $150!!! 
After a redeye flight and upon arrival at the hotel at 9am, we were told that they could not honour the early check in for any of the rooms (apparently they were sold out the night before) and we had to wait till nearly 3pm before any of our rooms were available. With kids in tow, you can imagine how disappointing it was for them to not even have a room to take a quick nap in or to freshen up.  Despite originally requesting a room on a high floor (La Rambla can be very noisy), we were given rooms on mid floors (didn’t argue as we were already waiting for our rooms for a very long time).

Guest relations staff were mostly pleasant and professional but really didn’t go out of their way to do anything for the inconvenience or to try to make the stay more memorable.  One would think that they would try to exceed the expectations and improve the experience of every guest much less SPG Platinum members but they did not give the impression that they tried. Let’s face it, if you are going to stay at a 5 star hotel, you expect 5 star treatment. Sadly, in my experience, this hotel did not meet those expectations.

Rooms-wise, the ones we had were very small, standard rooms – the only highlight were the bathroom with their rainfall like shower. The hotel lacks certain amenities that would comfortably classify it as a true 5 star but made up for it with its location. La Rambla is touristy but has a lot of vibe and action.

If I were to visit Barcelona again, I would probably look to another hotel in the La Rambla area to experience the location. For the cost paid, the value and experience (in my case) did not tally.",3,2012,07,31
37,Good but bad check-in experience,"I stayed here with my friend on a short trip to the city. The rooms were just what you'd expect from a top hotel like Meridien, and the concierge service was very good. The only negative was that, when first checking in, the receptionist tried overcharging us - we'd booked a room with two rooms within it, and as me and my friend were not together, one of us wanted to use the sofabed in the other room (they were fully booked on two bed rooms). However, to use the sofabed is an extra 75 euros a night as it assumes you have an extra person in the room so covers other services. After arguing with her that putting sheets on a sofabed for 75 euros a night was ridiculous and that we weren't going to have another guest, we eventually saw the manager who immediately waived the charge, saying the receptionist must not have understood what we were saying properly. After that, the staff did make an effort to be extra nice to us, and I overheard one of the other staff telling her colleague in Spanish (they didn't realise I could understand) about it and that it was silly the girl didn't just waive it immediately under the circumstances.",3,2012,07,31
37,THE place to stay in Barcelona,"This is now my third stay at Le Meridien Barcelona, and with each stay, it gets better and better.  There are a few aspects that really make it stand out for me:

1.  Location - can't be beat.  Right near the old city, you're near the action on La Rambla.  You're a few minute walk from the metro, the Boqueria market, and the old town

2.  Rooms - rooms are modern, nice, and comfortable (especially the beds).  They were a joy to stay in

3.  Service / amenities.  There are so many nice perks.  The cafe in the lobby is great and was our stop for the morning cappuccino.  If you're back by 8, they give free cava, a nice treat before heading out in a bit to dinner

4.  The staff.  They're top notch - nice, professional, knowledgable, and extremely willing to do whatever it takes to make your stay better

Suffice it to say, this hotel is my first choice whenever I'm in Barcelona.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,07,29
37,Great Location,"The hotel is in a perfect location- one block off Las Rambla. There is so much to do in the general area between the Ramblas and the Gothic quarter.Walking distance to many great attractions. Our room was not ready until 3pm but when we got upstairs we were very happy we waited! We had a one bedroom suite with a very comfortable extra room for watching television and working on our computers. It is worth upgrading if these rooms are available! The bathroom was very large and the shower was excellent- never had that much water pressure in a hotel before. The closet was large enough but there really should be an extra dresser as the four small drawers were not enough for both of us. There are no luggage racks in the room which made unpacking difficult.The bedroom has no air conditioner vent so it does stay to warm in there. I had to take a nap in the living room one day as the bedroom was hot!  When I went to use the safe the shelves were SO dusty- there was no way we could use the glasses or coffee area. The sheets do not get changed daily unless you leave a request.  We enjoyed the breakfast every morning as it was included in the price of the suite. The staff in the dining room and the concierge staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Oh, the television in the bathroom mirror was great- never saw that before.",4,2012,07,26
37,Great for a first visit to Barcelona,"Just recently spent 3 nights here before leaving on a Mediterranean cruise. This was my first time in Barcelona, and I wanted a good location. From a tourists point of view, you really couldn't hope to be in a better place. You're in the middle of Las Ramblas, easy walking distance to two Metro stops, right near La Boqueria (the marketplace), and very close to starting/ending point of Hop On Hop Off buses and the ""free"" walking tours.

The hotel itself is very nice. The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. There's a nice lobby with free wifi. (There's also a business center downstairs with free computer/internet access) We were on one of the Starwood floors, and the entire floor and our room had been recently renovated. Our room may have been a little small, but it was still very comfortable. The best and worst part of our room was that it was directly facing Las Ramblas. We had two sets of French doors that opened directly onto a great view of the street. This was a great way to soak up the whole Las Ramblas experience. The negative came at night, when even with the doors closed, you could still here a LOT of what was going on down on the street - cars honking, sirens sounding, people partying, etc. With all the money that's been spent on this hotel, I'm just surprised that they haven't found a way to sound proof these rooms a little better. Most of the rooms do not have this exposure, but if yours does, just be aware that you will hear noise. For me, the positives of the view, outweighed the negatives of the noise, but it just seems like something that they should be able to improve upon.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Le Meridien to friends, especially if they've got some Starwood Points to use.",4,2012,07,26
37,"Great location, friendly staff - great stay","This hotel is in a perfect location if you're a tourist looking to see the town. Right on las ramblas, by barri gotic, walkable to a lot of the sights. Rooms were very nice - renovated recently. Breakfast was good downstairs. We debated staying at the W Barcelona but decided on this hotel given proximity - we don't regret our decision. We went to the W for lunch one day - cool hotel, great views, but just a little out of the way relative to what we were looking for. Anyway, another good starwood stay.",4,2012,07,25
37,"A THOROUGH, COMPLETE & FAIR REVIEW","Location: 
best part of the hotel (noted in multiple other reviews) - centrally located on Las Rambla, walking distance to Gothic quarter, waterfront, Plaza Catalunya, 5 min walk to 2 metro stations (getting you to Park Guell, Sagrada Familia, Pg. Gracia - upscale shopping/dining, Montjuic, etc). Numerous dining possibilities within walking distance.

General Hotel:
this is a BUSY city hotel, caters to cruise ship tour passengers (think loud, north americans travelling in herds) and flight crews (think impatient, annoyed guests at checkout). If you are looking for a peaceful lobby this is NOT it. However, the hotel is clean and modern, and the location can't be beat (see above).

Staff:
Kind and trying their best, but clearly overworked, inexperienced (many trainees) therefore there is no attention to detail and often, details are forgotten. Constantly a line for the concierge, other times, simply none at the desk. Wake up call was late. Bags were misplaced and delivered erroneously. Rooms will NOT be available until official 3 pm check in (very busy). Our concerns were fairly and professionally addressed by the manager Walter, so he deserves credit for that and for honestly describing the demands placed on the hotel.

Rooms:
clean, modern. However, stark and not luxurious or ""warm/cozy."" Bathrooms are very modern and clean, showers are great with excellent pressure. Noise not an issue off of Rambla, which stays bustling until 1-2 am! Poor quality linens considering a 5 star rating.

General tips:
eat across the street at the modern italian and chinese restaurants, and around the corner at Bar Lobo (modern tapas). 

compare the price to Hotel 1898 which is across the street and quieter, more upscale with great rooftop pool and bar.

Also consider a few days at the W hotel by the marina to experience the beach culture (Barceloneta neighborhood), we checked out this place which was pretty amazing (pool, beach access) but also has a trendy ""seen and be seen"" kind of place.",3,2012,07,25
37,Location and overall comfort,Barcelona is one of our favorite cities and this hotel is located right in the heart of town on La Rambla Street; this made our stay fun and very convenient. Overall room was excellent and service good.,5,2012,07,24
37,"Great Location, Great Staff","I stayed at this hotel with my family prior to a 12 day cruise. We used points and stayed in a prestige suite. Even prior to my arrival the staff was helpful in responding to some questions via email. When the taxi arrived at the front of the hotel we were immediately met by staff to help us with the luggage, which was plentiful. They were all very nice and friendly. I went up to the desk to check in and was met by a nice young woman who was in training. She was very quick to thank me for my SPG loyalty and had me checked in very quickly. Her name tag said she was in training, but she seemed  like she was a real veteran. The room was comfortable and well appointed with great views. The bathroom was very large and the entire room was very clean. I will only echo the thoughts of others on the location....it was great! We walked to the market for breafast and had a great cheap meal with freash fruit and juices. It was fantastic.

When the time came to check out, the staff was as helpful calling for a cab and getting us on our way as they were when we arrived. Overall I was impressed witht he property and would probably stay there in the future.",4,2012,07,23
37,A beautiful hotel in a great area!,"The LeMeridien Hotel in Barcelona, Spain is beautiful.  The hotel offers a wonderful sleeping experience.  The breakfast buffet is very good with a great selection and the staff is nice.  The area is wonderfully located.  There are so many restaurants and souvenir shops nearby.  There must be a restaurant every few feet apart.  The area around the hotel is a little like Times Square in New York; people walking and shopping and eating all times of the day and night.  I enjoyed my stay very much.",4,2012,07,23
37,Very bad experience. I hope its not their standard!,"My wife and I are currently staying at this hotel. After multiple considerations I decided to go for ~$300 property compared to equally good options at half the price due to my continued loyalty to SPG and fear I had in living in another property in Barcelona where things could be stolen from. Our  experience here as been anything but pleasant:

Firstly, we arrived at 2p for a 3p checkout and the front desk were clearly red-tapist about 3p check-in policy and asked to wait for an hour. Until 3:10p, the person who checked us in (Anastasia) completely ignored us and not once came to give us an ETA. I went up at 3:10 to the FD again to be told to wait until 4p

Secondly, once we get in our rooms, we saw that the Internet did not work in the room (tried on laptop, iPad, Blackberry, and iPhone). The room had such bad  network that none of the devices were able to pick the signal. Then I tried the wired connection but that too did not work (Lastname and room combo was being rejected) When I called the FD, they said they will work on it and get back. They did not get back to me for full 24 hours (well the manager left me a message in the afternoon when we were gone to see the sights). Upon coming back I called Caroline (the other name that was given to me), left her a VM, called the FD asked them also to ask Caroline to call me, yet no response. Next day also no response from either manager or Caroline....Its been 48 hours now and no response. The front desk staff simply apologized and said  ""sorry we won't charge you for Internet"" That's not good enough. Why should one pay $300 at a hotel where Paid Internet won't work. One would be better off someplace else!

To top if off, the service given was very poor as well. 

- Our shower had issues, I called FD 2 times, in 36 hours but got no response. Finally my engineering background helped me find a solution and fix it.
- I am SPG Gold, entitled to 2 free water bottles everyday. Not once was the water provided to me without asking for it (except day of arrival)
- I ordered room service once, and got empty salt bottles. Are you serious? I called again for salt, and it took 20mins for them to send it. By the time I was done eating the meal as is

I am writing this note from the main lobby at 1:00 am in complete frustration...You book an expensive hotel for service and not for being treated like SH***!!

 I don't recommend anyone to stay at this property!!!!",1,2012,07,21
37,"Great Location, Nice Hotel","Great Hotel and Brilliant Location. Just a couple of things to make you aware. They don't change bed sheets or towels unless you throw on the floor or tell them so, and the other thing is that the hotel is sometimes hectic to check in or check out.",4,2012,07,20
37,Incredible location & Amazing Staff,"My family & I had an opportunity to spend 5 amazing days at the Le Meridien Barcelona. I highly recommend this hotel when visiting Barcelona. With the hotel located right on La Rambla, it was extremely convenient for access to the market, city tour buses and the port of Barcelona. The accommodations were outstanding and the staff was amazing. Their ability to assist us (we don’t speak Spanish) every day and their recommendations were very good. I give their service level a 5-star rating. In addition, I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and their attention to detail. I can’t say enough about our experience and would stay there again WHEN we go back.",5,2012,07,19
37,Let down at the last minute,"Stayed for 4 nights after having found a last minute deal via Voyage Prive. Nice hotel - perfect location (close to metro and airport bus stops as well as lots of great restauraunts and bars. Breakfast buffet was great, lots to choose from and all nice. Reception could be very hetic at times when large parties arrived. 
But the one thing that really let the hotel down was our final morning. We had to leave at 6am for our flight / but breakfast didnt start until 7am. As our room rate included breakfast we asked if there was a way of getting some food before we left. The 'helpful' lady on reception said we could get a take-away bag with sandwhiches, fruit, youghurts, coffee and orange juice delivered to our room for 6am. We told her this was the latest it could arrive as we had to get the airport. She told us that was fine and she'd sort it out for us. The next morning we waited until 6.10am - which was cutting it very fine for our flight - but still nothing arrived. We went to check out and asked what had happened to the food. Unfortunatley no order had been placed!! They said if we waited another 10 minutes they could sort something out, but the rude lady on reception didnt apologise, and even implied it was our fault we must have been mistaken in thinking we'd ordered the food. We ended up leaving with no breakfast, and because we were late, missed the bus and has to catch a later one. Needless to say we nealy missed the check-in, and were very stressed and hungry. Very unhappy and will be making a formal complaint. ",3,2012,07,19

37,Very Good Location.,"We went to the meridien in Barcelona for two days. Before we stayed at the Meridien Ra close Barcelona for four days. The location is great. You are on the Rambla. It is a touristy area. The staff is friendly but a little bit lost. At the bar, the waiter didn't know the difference between a cava and a glass of champagne Mumm. It is just an example.
The room is not very big.
The room is comfortable but the view was awful. We had a view on an old wall.
The bathroom was very nice with a big shower.
The breakfast was good but less good than the Meridien Ra.
Maybe, I will stay again at this hotel.",3,2012,07,18

37,Great location -but not quite five star.,"On a weekend break to celebrate an anniversary, wanting to see and do much, so time precious. Not helped by arriving at check-in time to be told room not ready. Weary and waiting in lobby. One hour later offered alternative room. Keen to unpack and get going; it took over half an hour for luggage to be brought up. However room fine and things got better. Later on, in knowledge that we were celebrating an anniversary an ice bucket with a bottle of Cava and strawberries dipped in chocolate were sent up to our room courtesy of the hotel.

Check in/reception staff (many not Spanish, and fluent English speakers) were charming and helpful.

Small de luxe room overlooking side street, wonderfully comfortable beds (almost best any where) and feather pillows, good lighting, really good shower, and reasonably quiet for location. Wardrobe arrangment and clothes storage space inadequate if you wish to unpack suitcase. Good towels and linen, changed daily at guests discretion.

Wi-fi, free in lobby but otherwise charged for, was poor and slow. Not good if needed for business.

Breakfast: as one would expect in a hotel of this class, good but not exceptional.
Roof top space to sit out unattractive and no comparison with Hotel 1898 across the road.

Overall: fantastic location, v.comfortable beds, well lit rooms and bathroom, reception staff helpful, good breakfast. Possibly 4 star plus rather than 5 star, but would return.",4,2012,07,12
37,Great Hotel on Las Rumblas,"My husband and I stayed at Le Meridian for 8 nights recently. It was perfectly located to take in all the major attractions and while located on La Rumbla it feels like it is just a little off the main drag and we certainly had no issues with street noise.
Our room was one of the Mediterranean  Suites with a large outdoor area with seating , solarium area and outdoor shower for cooling off. The room was very spacious with modern but warm decor.
Bar and restaurant pleasant and the staff friendly. Restaurant staff were very accommodating to my husband's gluten-free food requirements and went out of their way to assist in providing suitable alternatives.
Our only faults with the hotel were that the front desk and concierge were very busy and it was difficult to get assistance without a wait. Of course we were traveling in peak season and the hotel was very busy.
And while we had complimentary fresh fruit baskets and other treats delivered to our room daily, which was a lovely touch, often uneaten food would be left for a day or so before being removed.
The highlight of our stay was doing the complimentary paella cooking school, where a sumptuous lunch was provided ( all at no charge ) and was finished off with a gift of a paella pan , recipes and oven mitt being delivered to our room. A lovely surprise and something we would recommend any guest of the hotel taking advantage of.",4,2012,07,11
37,"good location, nice hotel","This hotel has a good location, very helpful staff, and has all the comforts. it has free wifi in the lobby, but you have to pay for wifi in your room. i find this ridiculous in this time! most of the hotels in the middle East and Far East have free wifi in the rooms.....",4,2012,07,10
37,Great location and wonderful customer service,"My partner and I traveled to Barcelona in June, prior to cruising on Carnival's new Breeze.  We spent two nights at the hotel -- and could have easily spent a week.  The staff was courteous, friendly and very helpful.  We arrived early -- and, while a room was being prepared, took the hop-on hop-off tourist bus on a tour of the city to get the lay of the land.  When we came back, our room was ready.  I found the room clean and spacious (despite reviews here otherwise).  We were on the fifth floor (not facing Las Ramblas) and encountered no noise or sleep disruption.  The location of the hotel couldn't be more convenient to all the things we wanted to see in the city.  While we didn't have breakfast at the hotel, we did experience the hotel's tremendous hospitality our second day.  As SPG members, we were hosted at a paella atelier where the chef, Eugeni Cortes, showed us how to prepare paella.  The experience was nothing short of amazing and was one of the highlights of our time in Barcelona.  We also experienced the dining service our last evening when we returned from watching the ""Magical Fountains"" near Placa d""Espanya. We dined at 111 (the restaurant) around 11:30 PM and had a window seat right on Las Ramblas.  It was perfect for people watching.  The food was excellent -- and a great value for the fixed price three course meal (with beverage).  We will return to Barcelona in the next two years -- and we will stay, again, at Le Meridien.",5,2012,07,08
37,Best location!,"This hotel is located in the heart of the Ramblas activity.
We stayed for three nights, taking a room at the back, facing a brick wall. We heard no noise from the busy street. The room was clean and comfortable but one day, having been out from 8am until three pm we came back to find that our room had not been serviced. When complaining we were told that they had until 5pm to service the room!
There is a supermarket next door drinks are expensive to purchase in the hotel so this this was very useful.
The hotel has free use of computers and WiFi, most of the reception staff spoke good English and were very helpful.",4,2012,07,06
37,Wonderful Stay,"I felt compelled to review Le Meridien Barcelona as we received such excellent service.

I stayed with my wife and 3 yr old daughter at the hotel for 4 nights. The hotel is very centrally located in the middle of Las Ramblas and easy to get to the main attractions.

At the beginning of our stay, we found the room we had been allocated on the 3rd floor was noisy due to it backing on to the service lift and laundry.

Salvador the front desk manager was extremely friendly and helpful. He spent a great deal of time phoning round to find a room for our needs (quiet, nice bed for my child, lots of shelves for clothes). In the end he was kind enough to offer us a large suite on the 6th floor for a very reasonable upgrade price. He also offered us coffee in the cafe whilst we were waiting for the room to be made up.

All the staff were really friendly and made my daughter feel very special, lending her children's books for bedtime stories and gave her a nice baseball cap.

We had dinner in the restaurant one night, and again the service was exemplary. Despite there being a set menu for the football, they managed to rustle up some spaghetti for my very fussy daughter. The surroundings for breakfast, dinner and drinks in the bar were very comfortable.

This was our 3rd visit to Barcelona, and I have to say this is the best hotel we have stayed in. We will definitely come again.",5,2012,07,04
37,"Nice hotel, good location, quite room","The hotel is everything you could ask for in a 4 star hotel in the middle of La Rambla.  Although it does not have the roof top like Hotel 1898 across the street, it does provide most amenities that you would expect.  We had a Junior Suite away from La Rambla and it was very quiet.  I would stay here again.",4,2012,07,03
37,Good quality hotel in the middle of everything,"Full disclosure: I didn't pay to stay here; I redeemed my Starwood points for three free nights so that made our experience that much better. As a SPG Gold member, we were upgraded to a very nice room on the 8th floor with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas and received free WiFi. The balcony was amazing and gave us great views of the city. Because we were fairly high up, noise wasn't a problem, although it might be on lower floors. Spain won the European Cup on the last night we were there so there was a ton of noise from the street, but even still, we weren't bothered. The rooms are on the small side, but very well-furnished; comfortable beds. The TV will be all static-y if you have all the lights on at the same time, which we didn't know until we checked out. The lobby is small with only two computers for check in and one for check out so it seemed like a total zoo the whole time we were there. Good breakfast in the restaurant, but it will cost you -- 67 EUR for 3 people. Nice service from the staff. Overall a good luxury hotel but I wouldn't have paid their rack rates; the SPG points were key.",4,2012,07,03
37,Very nice in central location,"Really lovely hotel with some great staff - particularly the receptionist who checked us in.
Room standard for European capital city, good shower and products, an evening make up service would be nice though.
Breakfast expensive so we went to place across road which was superb and would recommend.
One note of caution is location is fantastic and central for most tourist sites but personally didn't think much to Las Ramblas, I expected it to be full of one-off, quirky street sellers - in reality its full of magazine stands, fake sunglasses/handbags etc, beggars and has a bit of a run-down feel. This does not detract from the hotel in any way though.",4,2012,07,02
37,Great Hotel,Stayed in this Hotel for two nights ....the food was excellent ... the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble ....the room was very clean ....and was very quiet to our suprise as the Hotel is in the middle of The Ramblas....,5,2012,06,29
37,"Great location, average hotel.","Great location within walking distance of many restaurants and shops.  Hotel lobby is small and somewhat chaotic.  Seems to be used by some airlines for stayovers. Rooms were adequate, the tub/shower could be problematic for someone with mobility issues -- it was very high off the ground.  Although the room was on the street, it was fairly quiet.  The bed was low and hard, but I slept well.  No complaints about the room or hotel-- but pricing seems high for this property.",3,2012,06,28
37,"Great location, Surprisingly quiet","I stayed here with my family and it was a very pleasant stay.  The staff was extremely helpful.  I was concerned that it may be noisy being right on the the Ramblas, but it was not an issue.  My seven-year old loved having breakfast at the nearby market.",5,2012,06,28
37,"Great Hotel, Great Location",The staff was very welcoming and helpful.  They recommended fabulous restaurants and tours.  If you are planning a trip to Barcelona you should consider the walking gourmet tour as well as the segway tour.  We thoroughly enjoyed both of these.  Back to the hotel...... swanky and comfortable.  Enjoy!,5,2012,06,26
37,"Great location, great concierge staff","Excellent location, walk two blocks for Palau Guell (gorgeous house designed by Gaudi), and nearby is Picasso Museum, gothic quarter, Gaudi's amazing church Sagrada Familia. Hotel's Concierge staff is discerning and terrific, sent us to Casa Calvet, an elegant, small restaurant in a building designed by Gaudi and the food was superb. Concierge also recommended tickets to see Gran Gala Flamenc in the gorgeous Palau de Musica Catalana, a rare treat, and he got us excellent center, third-row seats for less than we would have paid booking online. Rooms are not beautiful but utilitarian. We didn't accept the first room offered with a view of an ugly short rooftop adjacent; they moved us to another room with a much nicer view of the side street.",4,2012,06,23
37,"Great location, very nice hotel","We stayed in the Le Meridien twice... their first time for a day prior to a cruise, the second time for a couple of days after the completion of the cruise.  Both stays were very good.  It's in an almost ideal location, right in the heart of Barcelona in La Rambla.  It's close to many sights as well as providing easy access to Barcelona's Metro system.  For our first visit, we were upgraded to a junior suite in a great location and a higher floor.  The room was outstanding in every way... comfortable, large, very clean.  Our second room was not quite as nice (but still clean and large enough) and we had some issues with the air conditioning (room was not cool enough at night).  The A/C was fixed the following day after we reported the issue.  We also had an issue with the in-room Internet service, since the wireless access was not good enough to enable a reliable connection (fortunately was able to use the hard wired internet as a fallback).  This was not an issue in the first room.

Overall, in spite of some fairly minor issues, this is fine hotel, good restaurant, and in an outstanding location.  Definitely recommended.",4,2012,06,23
37,This is ot a 5 star hotel,"It is a mystery as to how this hotel gained or maintains 5 stars. The reception staff and housekeeping are substandard and do not perform at any acceptable rating level.
With the exception of the exotic bathroom the room is poorly appointed at this level of hotel, the cleanliness of the room is poor e.g. mirrors not cleaned dirty towels left lying on floor. The  drink facilities are not replenished, bed linen is not changed unless specifically requested, in the guise of being environmentally friendly or perhaps just pennypincing.  Information display on the second floor was not functioning for three days due to a simple but unresolved computer error. The corridors were cluttered with dirty bed linen for most of the day. The free Wifi does not exist and is charged at 6 euro for 30 minutes.",1,2012,06,23
37,Great hotel and great location.,"This hotel is in an excellent location on Las Ramblas with lots of restaurants and shops around. Nothing was too much trouble for the very friendly staff. A nice room with a very comfortable bed. Could have done with a walk-in shower as the bath was rather high.
The room was overlooking the side street so very quiet. There is free internet 24 hours a day. Within walking distance of the Metro station and the bus tours which ran from Catalunya Square.",5,2012,06,21
37,Best Location,"just walk out of the Hotel and you are in the center of the city.  whether you want to sight see or eat, everything is not far away.  The staff is friendly and very helpful with great tips on things to do or go to eat.  The breakfast is a nice way to start the day and it continues from there.  The rooms are very comfortable  and the whole atmosphere makes you feel at home.",5,2012,06,19
37,Great hotel on Las Ramblas,"A great location on Las Ramblas in a small lane off the main street conveniently located with access to the metro station, the pier and the tour bus area. The Gothic quarter is also walking distance. The standard room is decently sized and fully equipped.",4,2012,06,17
37,Great location,"The hotel is located on Las Ramblas, within easy walking distance to the metro.  The lobby area can get a bit crowded.  The room was clean and the bathroom was big.  The tub/shower is high, that might be an issue for people with mobility issues.",4,2012,06,16
37,Fantastic Hotel,we stayed here for 3 nights in June a fantastic hotel. service was great. room beautiful and breakfast lovely. Great location and handy to everything. Would highly recommend it. Only to happy to arrange anything we needed from tours to room service,5,2012,06,16
37,Location can't be beat!!!,"This hotel is located right on Las Ramblas where all of the action happens in Barcelona.  We enjoyed our stay, but there was nothing really spectacular about the hotel.  Check-in was a little slow, but the rooms were clean.  The TV channels were horrendous.  My biggest complaint is that the wifi doesn't work in all rooms.  It did not work at all in Room 238, but the hotel was fully booked.  Despite those couple of items, I would absolutely stay there again given the location.",4,2012,06,15
37,"Great service, awesome location","Just off La Rambla. Get a room away from La Rambla. Close to some good cafes including one directly across the street called Luzia. You would think it was touristy b/c by hotel, but not. Modern, open kitchen EXCELLENT FOOD. Upstairs they have some awesome (really good) Chinese food. Anyway, hotel was clean and swank. Free wi-fi in lobby/cafe, 19 Euros for 3 devices in your room. Anyway, great spot close to everything.  Expensive, but we had free stay on Starwood points.",5,2012,06,15
37,Superb location at Ramblas,"Nice welcome at the reception, conveniently located in side street of Ramblas. Rooms at the back of hotel are quiet. Airconditioning functioning well and almost noiseless. Breakfast well provided for. I had a deluxe room on SPG floor, spacious entree, nice  bathroom.",5,2012,06,15
37,Great start to a Cruise,We started our cruise from Barcelona and the Le Meridien was a great base to see the sights. Just off the Ramblas and a short drive to the docks this is the ideal hotel. Great staff and nice rooms.,5,2012,06,14
37,Great hotel on las ramblas !,I have stayed at this hotel many times! The hotel is located right on ramblas and is in walking distance to everything you would want to see in this area of Barcelona! The suites here are great especially the ones on the ramblas side of the hotel they have high ceilings with a living room and marble bathroom! Very nice and comfortable. I recommend this hotel and it's suites if your stayin in a regular room they are average! The only complaint I would have here is the concierge are not very informative! Other than that great hotel with beautiful suites in a great location and if your an spg gold member they give you a choice of a bottle a wine or 500 star points. I always take the wine it's usually a nice bottle and I enjoy it at this hotel! Can't wait to go back here Barcelona it's a beautiful unique city ! ,5,2012,06,12
37,Great location and service,"Our stay at Le Meridien was everything we expected and more. The rooms were very comfortable and the concierge staff couldn't have been more helpful. The location is in a very busy part of Barcelona (La Rambla), but once you enter the lobby it is just lovely. If you want something much more luxurious and away from the hustle and bustle of town, I would recommend the W Hotel which we visited and were very impressed with. You can't really walk to very much in town from that location though. Le Meridien is walking distance to La Boqueira market, the Cathedral, Picasso Museum, Palau de la Musica and lots more!",4,2012,06,11
37,Perfect Location in Barcelona,"The location of the Le Meridien is absolutely perfect and makes this hotel very desirable for a stay.  It is located in the middle La Rambla, walking distance to many sights and to two subway trains.  We stayed here through starwood, so there are certain floors we are assigned to there.  When we got there, we were told had an upgrade.  Our room had a huge balcony/outdoor sitting area, so we were very pleased, until the next morning we were woken up to construction noise and we were told by the front desk that this noise would take place every day from 8am-5pm!  We suddenly felt that this upgrade was not a genuine one but rather one to make them look good because they knew no one wanted these rooms! All the balcony side rooms would be experience this noise!  So they were nice enough to move us to another room, no balcony but it had a separate living area and bedroom, bigger bathroom.  The rooms are really nice, spacious and clean.  Staff were very nice the entire stay. There was free fruit and free bottled water in the hallways every day. There is a nice coffee shop in the lobby, a lil overpriced but convenient.  And when it rains, they have complimentary umbrellas by the front door.  I would definitely stay here again, just make sure the construction is over with!",4,2012,06,10
37,Fantastic,"Such a great hotel, with an incredible concierge and front desk staff. The rooms are very big, modern and with a beautiful bathroom. Comfortable bed and great location seal the deal",5,2012,06,10
37,Fantastic hotel in fantastic location,"Le Meridien is right in the heart of Barcelona right on the Ramblas. It is only a minute walk from the awesome La Boqueira market and only a few minutes away from 2 Metro stations, one of which is small (so easy to figure out) and the other is a major one - seemed to me this is Barcelona's 2nd largest metro stop, so you can pretty much go anywhere from here.  

There was absolutely no street noise despite the party location of the hotel, I can only assume that management has taken great care of noise insulation.

Le Meridien really lived up to it's reputation at a top-notch hotel. Great service, great rooms. We were all fascinated by the 2nd TV in the mirror in the bathroom. It was fun.

No doubt you pay top dollar for all of this, but it certainly was worth it.",5,2012,06,07
37,"Location, Location, Location","We recently stayed at several Barcelona hotels (May/June of 2012). Le Meridien featured the best location of them all.  It was a solid Starwood experience in atmosphere, amenities, and service. I appreciated the free coffees at the coffee bar but didn't get a chance to use them all.

We liked the fact that we were steps from the Gothic Quarter, the larger metro stations (Placa Catalunya) and tons of great shopping, bars and restaurants. While La Ramblas tourist offerings in these categories can be more expensive, we were never far from a tiny side street with endless options.  It was a great location to just wander and explore...and get a little lost.",4,2012,06,06
37,Perfect Location,At the beginning of La Rambla the interior is more modern than one would expect - modern - clean - updated room with little view but more than acceptable.   404. euro per night for three including a very good breakfast.  Service very good and quite helpful.,4,2012,06,06
37,Great Hotel!,"We spent 4 nights in Le Meridien Barcelona last May during our trip to Spain and it's a really good hotel, upon our arrival they upgraded us from a deluxe room to a junior suite with La Rambla view for just 100 euros extra for the whole stay and we even got complementary internet wifi service which they usually offer for fees.

The Suite was really spacious and the beds were very comfy, the only complain we had was that the lighting was low, only few light sources available in the suite.

The Food:
We had the breakfast included in our rate and the food and service were great. The food was very delicious and had a good number of varieties from cereal to cheese to omlette stand to churros.

The Loctaion:
It's just off La Rambla which is a very touristic place and you have two metro stations only 5 mins walk to the right is Liceu Metro Station and you'll find Catalunya Metro Station to the left, also you'll find carrefour mini market in case you wanted to get sth to eat and put in the room's fridge or you want to get water bottles.

Overall, The hotel might seem a little bit expensive then other hotels in the area but it was worth the money.",5,2012,06,06
37,Central location near to all the action,"My wife and son  and i recently had a four night stay at this hotel. The hotel is typically ""Meridien"" ...in my view a bit understated but everything is done very professionally and i prefer the understated,efficient way of doing things. We prebooked breakfast at a discount and thoroughly enjoyed them as this sets you up for a long days sightseeing. We had several evening meals in the hotel restaurant ""111""  and the food was delicious and not  too expensive.Our room was a junior suite which was fine and plenty big enough for 3 adults. 
the hotel is in a prime position just off La Rambla but close to place de Catalunya where most of the tour buses start from. We used Bus Turistic- we prebooked online at a discount for a two day pass and this is a great way of getting used to the layout of the city. My tip is to stay on the bus for the full tour...there are three routes- red and blue that start at the place de catalunya and the green one which runs by the beach(and you catch this bus somewhere near the harbour).if you get a 2 day pass i'd suggest stay on the bus for the first day and then the second day you can hop on and off as you please. The bus covers all the major sights including Camp Nou.
The city of Barcelona , although large , has a lovely feel to it...maybe the weather has something to do with it but in many ways it is as  accessible as a small town. Nice to stop off at a bar every now and then and there are plenty of cheaper places away fro the main La Rambla area. Would definitely recommend the cable car trips at Montjuic and the harbour area- great photo opportunities.
Barcelona sometimes gets a bad press with pickpocketing but its like any other city...if you're vigilant you'll be ok. In particular keep your bags close to you around Metro stations and guys i would advise wearing a money belt only taking enough cash for your daily needs...leave passports etc in the hotel safe and take a copy of your passport if you want to use a credit card anywhere.

We will definately visit again and would definately stay at Le Meridien...one member of staff at reception called Vera was particularly helpful.

Barcelona is a beautiful city...dont miss La Pedrera/Sagrada Familia and the museums in particular",5,2012,06,06
37,Just About Perfect,"It's hard to say too much about the beautiful Le Meridien Barcelona. Located just off Las Ramblas, the iconic center of one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, the Le Meridien is a bastion of beautiful design, outstanding service, and many amenities for its guests.

We particularly enjoyed the buffet breakfast, which included an omelet bar, fresh fruit, and a delicious and refreshing juice bar.

In keeping with its imprimatur as part of the Starwood hotel group, the Le Meridien has immensely luxurious and comfortable beds, part of the Heavenly Bed design so prevalent at Le Meridien's sister concept, Westin.

The room is relatively spacious and includes a waterfall shower, stone and granite countertops, in-room safe, refrigerator, work station, and easy chair for reading and relaxing.

Best of all, the hotel is surrounded by many wonderful restaurants just outside the door.

All in all, a wonderful stay in beautiful Barcelona, thanks to the Le Meridien.",5,2012,06,05
37,Excellent location,"and if you can use SPG points, it's a great deal.  We stayed 5 nights in early May and were delighted with the room we were given....it was not on Las Rambla which we had requested because of noise.  As others have noted, the room is small but nicely furnished and has an excellent bathroom/shower & a comfortable bed.  We did not have the overpriced breakfast buffet even though we were offered ""a deal"" upon check in.  We instead,  being thrifty travelers, asked tht the mini bar be emptied and we purchased breakfast items from the Carrefours mini-mart next door which we kept in that fridge.  I must say nice words about the very helpful front desk and concierge staff. They were informed and very accomodating.  We would recommend it, especially if you are able to redeem SPG points.",4,2012,06,02
37,Great Location!,"Loved this hotel in the heart of Las Ramblas, close to Plaza Catalunya and the Barrio Gothico.  All the service and style expected with a Le Meridien; we enjoyed coming back every evening after exploring the city.",5,2012,06,02
37,EXCELLENT,"We spent a week at this nice hotel in March 2012 and get all what we expected from this brand - excellent service and food, pleasant atmosphere, ideal location.  

The room (looked out on noisy La Ramblas street) was not so big but quite. The décor is nice and everything is functional.  The dbl bed is very comfortable. The bathroom with flat LCD was modern & spacious and the water was hot and forceful in the shower. 

The breakfast buffet was fabulous - good variety of food items and the waitstaff was pleasant.
 
The concierge desk was great and seemed genuinely interested in helping. The special “Thanks” goes out to concierge Ricardo which was very professional and assisted us very well.  

We would stay there again and recommend it to others.",5,2012,05,30
37,Very pleasant hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"We enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien. Conveniently located for walking on La Rambla and for taking the metro. They upgraded us to a suite -- King bedroom, very large round living room, foyer, dressing room and bathroom with heated marble floors. (Love the heated floors).  Relatively good buffet breakfast.  The desk staff and concierge were excellent.

The only downsides -- the wifi is pretty weak. Basically unusable in my room and even weak in the lobby.   The people at the door were hit and miss.

Other than the wifi connection, our room was fantastic.",4,2012,05,30
37,New Suites at Le Meridien,"We were offered an upgrade at a cost for our existing Starwood point redemption. I felt it was a fair offer. The suites offer a great deal more room than standard- very contemporary and clean and fresh. You have your own private balcony which is really nice to sit and have a late afternoon drink in private. It had a dining table and lounge chairs and was a great perk. I had contacted the hotel in advance for a quiet room, and this was away from the Ramblas and peaceful. Salvador in reservations was attentive and made every effort to make our stay a pleasant one.The 6-9 floors offer quiet and lovely views. We did not avail ourselves of the spa or gym, but the facilities looked above average. Our only complaint was the room was never cool enough, but Spain was having an early heat wave - we were provided a huge fan- and we found this to be true in all other hotels during our stay.
The location is the best there  is. I would have to agree with some of the comments concerning the door staff- less than average and not necessarily helpful when we needed a cab. Nevertheless, everyone else was attentive.",5,2012,05,29
37,Unforgettable Experience,"My family and I stayed at Le Meridien for 5 days. It was a wonderful birthday get-away. The hotel is perfectly located on Las Ramblas, in walking distance to shops, sightseeing, restaurants and shows. Our suite was beautiful, well appointed and clean, with a spa-like oversized bathroom. The staff was amazing, from the very attentive Front Desk personnel to the Concierge who always greeted us by name when we walked by, to the warm and friendly hostesses and waiters during breakfast service. The breakfast selection was splendid and there was no better way to start the day than with a Mimosa. I highly recommend Le Meridien Barcelona to everyone and I am looking forward to my next visit.",5,2012,05,29
37,"Wonderful stay, great room","My wife and I stayed four nights at the Le Meridien Barcelona earlier this May prior to boarding a cruise ship.  We were using points, and were initially given a standard room, but after returning to the front desk and asking for something nicer we negotiated an upgrade to one of the rooftop suites which turned out to be a spectacular deal at 150 Euros a night.  The suite had recently been renovated; it was very modern, spacious and well decorated with a very comfortable bed [perhaps the most important part], a great soaking tub and a very cool walk in shower.  To top it off, we had an outdoor deck almost as big as the room with a great rooftop view of the old section of Barcelona.  The deck had soft chairs for lounging, a great table for eating, and was very private save for the few people at the rooftop pool across the street.  As well, the Le Meridien's location is absolutely perfect for visiting the best sites in Barcelona.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each day which was also of very high quality.  And the service throughout was very good...for example, late one evening we asked for more water and it was delivered in what seemed to be only moments.  All in all, a great hotel that we'd recommend to anyone.",5,2012,05,29
37,"very central, although...","If needing a full-on central location with main tourist bits on door step, ideal.
Polite, standards as expected. Room stay on points put on SPG floor? which assume gets you an apple tray and copy of the China Daily? can't advise what else might be different.
Room ""nice"" although fairly small, bathroom large compared to main room size with fantastic double shower. claims of 42"" TV's a bit of a let down given very old Panasonic units with dodgey picture (but your not likely to be in Barcelona to watch TV...)

Didn't eat onsite - -why, given the vast options on your doorstep (Bar Lomo opposite handy and nice). Onsite bar reasonably priced (for Starwood). main market 2 min walk away with some of the best food offerings and fantastic Tapas bars in Spain.

Had requested a room away from facing Las Ramblas, due to others noting issues with noise, our rear room was whisper quiet. however you do get some passing noise thru from adjacent rooms (nothing major)

Hotel left nice surprise of a cake and bottle of Cava for my wife's birthday which was a lovely gesture and top marks for this.

Downsides:

Having walked around the city for the day, the hotel really misses somewhere nice to chill-out- i.e. a terrace... o.k. there is the hotel lobby, but real shame there is no rooftop terrace or equivilent.

We got free wifi as SPG Gold, but I wouldn't bother paying for the outrageous costs for the in-room wifi ( its slow and intermittent), believe is provided free in lobby.

There are many similar standard/ and better hotels in the immediate area, so Le Meridian need to keep their standards and offerings worthy to entice. would we stay again... possible, but would rest on deal but really missed a terrace/ courtyard area.",4,2012,05,29
37,Nice Hotel...Would not necessarily rate it as a five star hotel,"Great location if you want to be ""right in the mix"".  The rooms are clean, well equipped and comfortable.  The staff is attentive and friendly, but make sure they give you a room on a higher floor and away from La Ramblas.  My second floor room was very noisy from the street activity.  The WiFi connection is terrible.  DO NOT PAY FOR IN ROOM WiFi CONNECTION, IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!  Even the free lobby WiFi is not intuitive to sign on to, it is dreadfully slow and inconsistent.  The concierge is very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant staff are nice enough, but the breakfast buffet itself is overpriced and not that great.  The fitness room is small but well equipped with everything you need to get a good workout.  Overall, this is a nice hotel, but it is a bit overpriced, the value is average and it does not exactly merit a ""five star"" rating.  ",4,2012,05,28
37,Le Meridien May 2012,"Great hotel, good value for money.  Good location.  No complaints.",4,2012,05,23
37,"Excellent Location, Nice Rooms","We stayed at the deluxe room for 10 nights and so got to know the hotel well.  Some pros and cons when we stayed for so long.

Our first room was tiny, small and faced an ugly roof and so we requested for a change to a better room.  The 2nd room was large and faced hotel 1898 so there is a difference in the rooms and not all of them are created equal.  We also realised they have redone some rooms from 6 - 9 floors and so, gather these rooms are even better.

Pros :
Room is bright and quiet.
Location just off La ramblas means you are 20 steps away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona and yet, can sleep in peace and quietude.
Bed was comfortable.
The gym was nice and well-equipped.
Very easy to get a taxi and we never see the need to try the infamous subway a block away.

Cons :
Pillow are way too soft and there is no option to change pillows.
We asked for scissors to cut some tape and the reception actually said it is against their rules due to safety reasons to lend out their scissors.  Sounds really weird to us as knives of all kinds can be bought easily just next door at carrefour.
The Spa is so-so as it was not as soothing as we thought it would be.  Pressure was way too light.
the showers were housed in the bathtub and so we found it dangerous to be climbing in and out of the high bathtub to take a shower esp as the edges are sharp.  and this is even riskier after the shower when the floor is wet (due to absence of a shower curtain).
the bathtub is rectangular and really uncomfrtable to lie back and relax.  you can only sit upright in it, perhaps one way of detering water wastage an discouraging the use of the bathtub?  But really poorly-designed bathtub.

Service-wise, the reception and concierge was alright but the entrance staff (from the porters to the greeters etc), were dismay in their service.  For all 10 days, we were never greeted and we were in and out so often.  Strange that for a 5-star hotel, they fail to get this basic service policy right?

Overall, nice location is a prime consideration as food, tapas bars, la ramblas and a lot of tourist attractions are nearby. But service-wise, certainly not up to par.",4,2012,05,20
37,Excellent location,"Excellent Location.  

Nice and clean bathroom.  The bed is very comfortable.  Wi-fi was very weak in room.",5,2012,05,17
37,Amazing Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Le Meridien for our 10 yr Anniversary and upon our arrival we were met with the nicest staff imaginable especially Marta... she helped us navigate our return trip to the airport after an initial mixup and she just made sure that we were having a great time... the location of the hotel is EXCELLENT as it is right smack dab in the middle of LAS RAMBLAS and great shopping on paseo de gracia.  People say that the rooms are loud being on Las ramblas but I didnt find that at all.  The room was very spacious with an very nice bathroom.  We had breakfast there every morning and the food was great with wonderful pastries, an omelette station, muesli and fruit.  Again with its location being so central, you can walk to the harbor, parc citudealla, perdera and TONS of tapas restaurants line las ramblas... YOU CANNOT go wrong with staying at this hotel!",5,2012,05,15
37,"Excellent Location, Nicely decorated, Very good service","I've stayed here twice now.  Once in May 2011 for 3 nights, and then 1 night on 4/7/2012. I stay here using Starwood points, as I'm Starwood Platinum.  This year we got upgraded to a King Suite with a view of Las Ramblas from our living room window.  We had a room with a circular living room that was on the corner of the building.  The living room itself is disappointing in the way that it was decorated.  Felt way cheaper than our room with a terrace did last year at this hotel.  It had cheap hardwood (like) flooring and oddly matched and uncomfortable leather furniture.  The bedroom was fine.  The bathroom is interesting in that there is a loose swinging glass door that offers mimimal privacy or sound reduction. It's in the hallway across from the bedroom.  Bathroom itself was very nice with a separate shower and soaking tub.  (Last year I had a traditionally furnished suite with a large terrace on Las Ramblas.  That room was more inviting and comfortable, though a bit worn/dated.  Might be remodeled by now.)  So I give the hotel an overall 4 out of 5 as a combo for both year's rooms and the location helps the rating.  This Le Meridien also doesn't have a conceirge lounge, which you would think it would as most international LeMeridiens do have them.  We missed that feature.  You can walk to so much from the hotel.  And the Metro isn't far away to get you to location further away.  Tons of cafes and restaurants in the area.  The gay neighborhood isn't too far a walk away either.  That is near the University neighborhood.  We stayed here in 2012 the night prior to a cruise.  The location is perfect and only about a 10 euro cab trip to the Port.  Recommend this hotel for location, newly renovated rooms, service, English speaking, and Starwood connection.",4,2012,05,11
37,Very Well Designed Rooms Provide LOTS of Storage Space,"We used SPG points to stay five nights at Le Meridien Barcelona from May 4-9, and were pleased with our overall experience there.

Though we did not receive an upgrade through my status as a Gold SPG member (nor did I request this at check-in), and were not on an SPG designated floor, we could not have been any happier with our room, due to the clever use of space to provide more than ample storage for everything we required, and the bed was most comfortable (as expected).

The bathroom was clean, modern and most functional (it looked to have been recently remodeled).  The bathtub (with an overhead rainshower head, as well as a hand-held shower head) was quite large, one of the deepest I can remember.

Service provided to us by the staff at Le Meridien Barcelona was warm and friendly, quite competent and professional.

The gym downstairs provided more than enough equipment to meet my fitness needs, with eliptical machines, treadmills, and bikes, as well as Life Fitness weight equipment and dumb bells also.

In the evenings, the lobby of Le Meridien was reminiscent on some ways of the W Hotels.

We would stay at Le Meridien if ever we return to Barcelona.",5,2012,05,09
37,Great hotel in central location,"The Le Meridien Barcelona is a standard center-city Le Meridien.  This hotel has a fantastic location making most things walkable.  The concierge gave good recommendations for restaurants in the area. The hotel restaurant has a good breakfast spread each morning which we received with our SPG Platinum status.  

Complaints: The hotel hosts alot of tour groups which clog up the lobby and make you feel like you're in a very touristy spot.  Also, the Wifi is not great in the rooms.",4,2012,05,09
37,Fabulous Hotel on Las Ramblas!,"This hotel is fantastic in all respects!  

The rooms are modern, updated and very quiet (despite our room overlooking Las Ramblas we never heard any street noise).

All the staff are terrific.  Very friendly and extremely helpful.  We arrived at 11:00am from overseas and our room was ready!

Our one bedroom suite was HUGE with an incredible view of Las Ramblas and the Gothic Cathedral.  We had a large bedroom, two bathrooms, two outdoor decks, an AMAZING and large round seating area (with terrific views) and a separate sleeping area for my son (with his own television!)!  I adored the round window in one of the bathrooms!  One odd thing - the 'main' bathroom had a tub, shower and sink, but no toilet!  The second bathroom had a sink and toilet.  A bit strange by North American standards to not have a toilet in the bathroom, but it worked fine for us!  The beds were very comfortable and the linens were top notch.

The location can't be beat!  You can walk almost everywhere and for the places you can't walk to it is easy to get a cab.  I really liked how the hotel was on Las Ramblas but the entrance was on a quiet side street!

I wasn't fond of the breakfast, but I attribute this more to not being used to European breakfast than to the quality of the food.

One slight drawback for some might be the lack of a swimming pool, but if you are in Europe to tour, then who wants to stop for a swim break?!  I certainly did not, but my little one did, so I was thankful to find out there wasn't one available!

This hotel has it all!  I highly recommend it.  It is expensive, but well worth it!",5,2012,05,07
37,Great trip with our 2 year old!,"We traveled from New York to Barcelona with our 2 year old.  The flight there was a red eye and we had coach seats - which was not very fun!  The way home we upgraded to first class and it was AMAZING!  If you can afford it, I recommend it.  Our daughter had her own seat and she slept for 5 of the 8 hour flight.  AMAZING!  Anyway, on to the hotel.  We arrived at our Hotel only to be told that our one bedroom suite that we booked was not available.  Not what you want to hear after a long flight.  So, we complained a bit and told them the reason we booked this hotel was specifically so we could have a one bedroom, given our daughter still takes naps.  So, they put us in a regular room for 1 night and then moved us to the suite the following evening.  A little annoying, but at least they took care of it.  We all got to our room and crashed!!  
Then upon exploring Barcelona the next couple days we really appreciated the great location of this hotel.  We loved our daily breakfast in the hotel (that came with our room) and I truly started my love of a real cappuccino.  YUM!!  One of the best ones was right there at the hotel - they have a little coffee bar.  Love it!  There was a Starbucks in the area, but I didn't even want it.  

Our 1 bedroom suite was perfect!  It had more than enough room for all 3 of us and the room was covered with windows.  The crib they had for our daugter was nice and large so she had plenty of room to feel comfortable.  We did our sight seeing during the day, came back to hotel around 4pm and let her take a nap until 7 or 8pm and then got her up to go out for dinner.  She didn't like to get up, but once she was up and changed her clothes she was ready to go.  We found so many amazing restaurants to eat at - not sure if it was because I did a lot of research, or if all the restaurants are just so good.  If anyone wants restaurant recommendations let me know and I can try to remember.  Most don't open until around 8 or 8:30, so be prepared for that.  That is why we shifted our daughter's nap time.   Our daughter fell in love with the sandwiches called ""bikini's"" it is a grilled cheese with ham I believe.  If we were going to go to a nicer restaurant sometimes we would just grab a sandwich for her and then go to our restaurant.   
We really loved our trip to Barcelona and feel the Meridien is a great hotel to make your home base!  It is beautiful, clean, great food and coffee and they will do their best to accommodate your needs.  Good luck!!",4,2012,05,03
37,"Efficient, clean hotel in great location","As everyone says, the location of this place cannot be beat.  Right off La Rambla.  Many attractions are walking distance.  And if not, the metro is a block away.

La Rambla is a VERY busy street (tourists, not traffic) and crowded until late at night.  It can be noisy, but we had a room on the backside of the hotel and did not notice any noise problems.  Slept through the night very well every night.

I am an SPG Platinum member and did not get a suite.  But the room itself was sufficient.  Clean, modern design.  Spacious enough.  Lots of closet space.  The bathroom was great --- rainfall shower head, stone floors and shower stall.

The lobby is attractive and is a decent place to hang out.  We had breakfast in the restaurant each morning at the buffet and it was pretty good.",4,2012,04,26
37,Only 5 rooms facing Ramblas Street every 1 floor!,"We stayed here 3 nights using SPG star points.
Since I had SPG Platinum status, we are upgraded to 
great room facing La Rambla Street with balcony.
(Please see Photo 2)
It seems there are only 5 rooms facing La Rambla Street every 1 floor
(Please see Photo 1)
You can buy everything at Carfour next door.
The breakfast was average Meridien.",4,2012,04,25
37,Active and Convenient Location,"This hotel is along La Rambla in Barcelona.   A very active, busy with lots of people street.  Our rooms were very nice and comfortable.  We were traveling with 2 teenage children and we were given adjoining rooms. Our rooms overlooked the La Rambla and the street noise didn't stop all night and into the morning hours.  If you think this would bother you be sure to request a room that is away from the street. We liked the location because we were able to walk to buses for touring, restaurants were plenty and so was the shopping.  Next time we will request a quieter room.",4,2012,04,23
37,Very good hotel in great location,"Loved a recent stay at the Meridien Barcelona. AS SPG Platinum member I got upgraded to a very nice and spacious suite. Very well maintained and furnished and great view of Las Ramblas.

The hotel services are great and staff very helpful. The location is perfect for sightseeing as well as business and the restaurant offers a decent breakfast buffet. All in all a very nice hotel with good standards.",4,2012,04,23
37,Very Nice Hotel,I stayed here a few nights ago and was very impressed. My wife and I were here about 6 years ago and the hotel has since undergone some significant improvements. The location is perfect for a tourists visit to Barcelona. The staff were all very friendly and helpful as well.,4,2012,04,22
37,Poor breakfast.,"Location is fabulous, city is fantastic people are remarkable the hotel price is expensive no questions asked, you obviously pay for it's location. Nothing negative to say about the Meridien except it's price and it's poor breakfast Buffett .",4,2012,04,15
37,Fantastic Hotel!!,"This hotel is in a great location.  Staff was great.  There is not a better place to stay in Barcelona.  In the middle if fantastic restaurants, bars, and shopping. ",5,2012,04,07
37,Another good experience!,"I've stayed 3 nights in this hotel for a quick visit to Barcelona.
The hotel is well located right next the market  ""La Boqueria"" where you can find many local fresh products and also delicious spanish snacks!
The hotel is quite modern and staff were always very friendly.
We had lunch and had dinner a few times in the restaurant and the food was always great.
They have a daily menu where you can eat a full meal for only 16 or 19 euros, depending if it's lunch or dinner. Breakfast cost 25 euros per person.
We tried the room service one night and we ordered the paella but we were a bit disappointed. The quality of the food in the restaurant is much superior.
The room was big and very confortable. The bathroom was also big enough but they were some missing products like towels and bathrobes every days. 
Our room was facing the street and sometimes there was some noise in the morning probably with the arrival of goods to local restaurants, but nothing excessive.
Bed was super confortable, like all the others Le Meridien hotels.
Free wifi internet in the lobby for 30 min but you have a business center with 3 computers where you can use internet whenever you want to.
I think the strongest point of this hotel is its location that it is certainly a plus for those looking to stay right in the center of the tourist area of ​​Barcelona.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,04,07
37,"Great Location, Loved the Rooms!!","We stayed at this hotel for three nights and we loved the location.  We could walk to everything and even though we were continually warned about the pick pockets, the area feels safe.  The rooms were very spacious and we had a great view down Las Ramblas.  We loved the decor and even the rooms that were not renovated were still nice and in good condition.  Staff was great and recommended good restaurants in the area.",5,2012,04,07
37,Great!,"Great location, good price and very comfortable and modern. I really enjoyed my stay!",5,2012,04,06
37,Convenient and quiet,"This hotel is in the heart of La Rambla so it's a great choice for being a tourist in the city! We walked everywhere. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and predominantly English speaking. The rooms were very nice, great amenities, and believe it or not, quiet! Our room overlooked the street yet we slept peacefully. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,04,05
37,"Good hotel, excellent location","Stayed at Le Meridian in March for a few days on cash and points. Overall, the hotel was great. We found the rooms very clean, the area super convenient on La Rambla.  The decor of the room is very modern. The washroom is wall to wall tile, the large shower stall with 2 shower heads is wonderful. 

We did have the buffet breakfast which included some of the usual items like sausages, eggs benne, etc. There was also smoked salmon and Spanish ham which was a treat. In terms of other food locations, there are a bunch of informal cafe type restaurants all along the south end of La Rambla.  If you walk about 8 minutes south, on your left there's a large open piazza type area lined with restaurants servicing full courses and inexpensive tapas.

You cannot ask for a better location. Walking 10 minutes north, you'll find yourself at Casa Battlo.  Walking 10 minutes east, you'll find yourself at Palau du Musica and the Gothic Quarter.  By the way, the best way to get into the Palau is to attend an evening concert. The website notes that  walking tours during the day must be booked way in advance. Walking 5 blocks south is an open market.  Another 10-15 mins further south you'll be at the pier which is completely modern with Imax theatres, large shopping mall, etc.

Overall and excellent experience.",5,2012,04,05
37,Business for me - shopping for Her,"Very well located on La Rambla within walking distance of good shopping and sightseeing.
Were upgraded to a full suite which was extremely comfortable for 4 nights. Staff were excellent and the dining was above average for a hotel - breakfast was good and not expensive. Will stay again.",5,2012,04,04
37,Highly recommend,"We highly recommend this hotel! Staff speaks good english and service is outstanding! OUr room was a deluxe King, big cabinet, flat screen tv, big bathroom. It's is centrally located and very close to Plaza Catalunya and it's along La Rambla, short walk to La Boqueria Market, Gothic Quarters and major attractions. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2012,04,03
37,Great Hotel!,"Truly enjoyed our one -week stay at this property. The staff were very attentive, location was first-rate and the room very comfortable and nicely appointed.

I am a fan of storage- enough drawers to accommodate clothing and toiletries - this room, a deluxe king, satisfied my needs. The bathroom had a tub/ shower with both a rainshower head and a hand held wand, and an extra deep tub for soaking. Telephone and tv, robes, nice toiletries and big, fluffy towels were provided. The king sized bed was very low, but also comfortable. Nice big screen flat panel tv. Slow internet- would not pay for it. We were comped for our Starwoods status but they need to improve the speed-tedious!

The windows were doublepaned and kept the room quiet, however, we didn't know that the window was open on the first day and it was very noisy. We had a first floor room and it didn't face Las Ramblas but late night catcalls,etc. could be heard- don't know if the rooms facing the busy Ramblas would be quiet in the evening.

This hotel is in a very convenient location, near transportation and great restaurants. Would",5,2012,03,29
37,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel but mostly beautiful people. We were treated great, by both Salvador and Anastasiya, although we went there late on Friday afternoon asking for a room (due to bad experience by another 5 star hotel).They offered us suite no 625 (just renovated) which was superb and the terrace just splendid. Great location next to La Ramblas and La Boccheria, nice restaurants, in the center of excitement and fun. Breakfast was not giving many choices while it offered helathy and tasty juices.We had nice dinner at hotel’s restaurant Cent Onze, which we highly recommend. When we asked concierge’s help for Flamenco performances, he suggested the best so we  had a great last night before leaving Barcelona. We will defintely go back.",4,2012,03,23
37,Decent urban hotel-difficult parking though,"Good service and people, rooms small but have everything you need. Entrance sort of on a side alley-very small pullover space to get out of taxi or valet park. Internet connection in rooms is way too expensive, of course. I probably would not stay here again mainly due to the congestion in this area. If you want to stroll La Rambla this would be perfect place to stay.",4,2012,03,22
37,wonderful staff/location/close to theaters.....,"I was pleasantly suprised by the hospitality and efficiency of the hotel.The Conceriege was superb and the staff extremely accomodating.The rooms were large and the location is unbeatable.Another plus is the access to local resturants, Tour guides and theaters- all within walking distance.I was a little hesitant initially because of all the reviews I had seen earlier regarding recent renovations etc- I was on the second floor and was in a room away from main Las Ramblas and did not have any problems (nor any complaints).I will definetly be visiting again and would choose Le Meridien Barcelona !!",5,2012,03,19
37,Hotel Merdien Barcelona : More than a hotel,"This is my third stay at Meridien Barcelona. The hotel is located in a great place close to excellent restaurants, and many central places are at walking distance. This hotel is unique for its atmosphere, for the service which is ""prefect"" and the breakfeast is exactly what we expect from 4 star or 5 star hotels. More than a hotel it is for me a place to be in Barcelona to really enjoy my vacations at a price which is very reasonable for the quality of service.",5,2012,03,19
37,Great location but that's about all,Near the Ramblas which was great but not worth the price. Breakfast ok but if you want lower priced menu items in lieu of included higher priced buffet you will be charged! Internet is €20 per day per device- ripoff!! Rooms are tiny and stagnant- no moving air. Try somewhere else.,3,2012,03,16
37,Great staff / location / renovations / wonderful views from upper floors,"After a shaky start due to starwood's booking agent/ web site, we had a great experience at this property. 
A special thanks to Walter, Bruno and Gil who all went out of the way to make our stay effortless. The property is in the middle of a full make over and if you want a modern room,ask for a lower floor w/ new technology / style. It is my understanding that the upper floors will be done in the fall but are great old school rooms currently. Also of note is the views from the upper floors which are five star. The restaurant advise was great with 3 out of 4 being wonderful. 
It was actually trip advisor that gave me the heads up regarding the renovation of the lower floors. Starwood made no note on their web site or on the phone when booking the hotel. After reading about it I contacted Starwood and was given a pathetic excuse for not being forthcoming and never followed up as to the end date or confirming the completion. Who wants to stay in a hotel being renovated! It was only after contacting the property myself was I treated well and had my concerns met. Luckily the work was completed before we arrived. Overall a great experience.",5,2012,03,14
37,"Great Location, No A/C for two nights!","The Meridien in Barcelona is located in a great location, right off La Rambla.  You are walking distance to many great locations, bars, restaurants, etc.  We were quite disappointed when our room had no air conditioning for our two nights in early March.  We complained to the front desk agent, who said they would take a look at it, but nothing changed.  At $500 a night, very, very disappointing.",2,2012,03,13
37,excellent hotel stay,"I spent 5 nights and 6 days in Barcelona, all at Le Meridien. The entire experience was nothing short of superb. The concierge service (which we made use of 3-4 times a day was most helpful). The rooms were very quiet (I had specifically asked about a room away from La Rambla, and they obliged), and very comfortable. The bathrooms (esp with rain shower) were great. The location of the hotel is very central (right off of La Rambla) and in a safe location. I would highly recommend this hotel for anybody planning to visit Barcelona (just make sure to book it using priceline, so you can bring the price down).",5,2012,03,12
37,Good Location for Tourists,"Great location (on La Rambla) for tourist attractions. Nice sized rooms, typical Le Meridien standard. Very friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend.",4,2012,03,11
37,"Great location, nice rooms, poor room service","We stayed here for two nights. The location is great. It is right on Las Ramblas, smack in the middle of the block, and close to Old Town and metros. The rooms were great. The Le Meridien in Vienna had better, bigger rooms, but these were still nice, though I was a little disappointed by comparison. The parking was expensive...35 euros a night. The room service was awful. I ordered a pizza and the entire cheese layer was burnt to a crisp. Someone obviously didnt look at th pizza before they sent it up. I speak limited, poor Spanish, so I had a bit of a runaround before I got another. Overall, would stay here again.",4,2012,03,11
37,Beautiful hotel located in the heart of Barcelona,"By  choosing Le Meridien, we already knew what quality standard we could expect and we were not disappointed. 
The hotel is located beside the lively boulevard of La Rambla, from where you can walk to the port or through the Barri Gotic district, full of bars and restaurants. You are also very close to the subway station, from where you can reach more distant locations as the Sagrada Familia.
But be aware of pickpockets. My Blackberry was stolen in a tapas bar nearby and it took me one full hour to do the declaration of theft at the police station, where there was by chance a translator. 
Anyway, Le Meridien Hotel was really marvellous, from the hotel lobby to the restaurant and the rooms. One single negative point goes to the noise. The windows are not soundproof enough to withstand the sounds coming from the street. So try to choose a room located in another direction. 
Breakfast, even though excellent, was a bit expensive and it is more convenient and cheaper to have breakfast in your room.
Personnel is very helpful (especially with this robbery episode) and the fitness room, even though small, is nice for a short practice.",5,2012,03,11
37,Best location in Barcelona!,"The very first thing you appreciate about this hotel is the location, right on Las Ramblas! You literally cannot find a better location in all of Barcelona ... you're just a few minutes walk away from the main square (bus transfer to the airport, metro station, and shopping at a HUGE ""Il Cortes Ingles"" department store). If you walk in the opposite direction you'll get to the beautiful waterfront. But most importantly, there's Las Ramblas itself, which has chic restaurants, fast food, souvenir shops, even ""Le Carrefour"" is a few seconds away ... Las Ramblas is very happening day and night! 

The hotel is housed a beautiful historic building. Lobby is classic, with nice furniture with views on the street ... you can sit down on a comfortable couch, sip on a cappucino and watch the people go by (lobby has a real cappucino bar, and the hotel gives you a complimentary cappucino upon check-in). 

The room itself had an amazing bathroom with stone floor and a deep soaking tub (even a mini-TV!). The room itself had a nice wooden floor, huge comfortable bed and lots of closet and storage space for luggage. The view was nothing spectacular (view on the side-street), but who wants to sit in their room and look out the window? You're in Barcelona! 

We were only at the hotel for 2 nights, as lack of availability forced us to switch hotels (next review to come), but I would have gladly stayed at this place for the whole week! I highly recommend it.",5,2012,03,09
37,Great hotel and location,"We arrived at Le Meridien after a disappointing stay in Milan on a week long business trip.
The front desk was welcoming: had a lovely room with a good size bathroom and great shower.
Everyone was so friendly; was treated like a platinum starwood member even though I am gold.
The manager was helpful and actually asked how we found everything and gave me his card.
I could tell this was a very well run hotel and will go back.",5,2012,03,09
37,Another nice stay in a Le Meridien hotel,"Introduction:

I was in Barcelona attending a conference.
The hotel where that conference was held was quite nice, Hotel Miramar, with a splendid view on the sea and the city.
The only problem was that the conference organization controlled the bar & the restaurant (that they closed to use the space for exhibitors) so after 6PM the only thing you could get for a 20€ ticket (yup they sold tickets, no way to charge the room!) was an almost still frozen ham and cheese toast.

As I was staying with my better half, we decided to move downtown to a Starwood hotel, Le Meridien on La Rambla.

Dates of stays:
From march 2 to 5, 2012 

The Exterior:
The building is nice looking, sober and classy, as usual with Le Meridien.
It’s located on a corner of La Rambla (upper part, close to the very very large Catalunya Square).

The Area:
Nothing is missing in the area: grocery stores, restaurants, bars, shopping mall (two huge el Corto Ingles), attractions, street life, and so on.
Public transportation is fast and easy: buses and metros are all at Catalunya Square.

Going up north, after the square, you find Paseig De Gracia that features more restaurants and bars, wine tasting bar, the luxury brands boutiques, and many amazing buildings, including 2 of the most famous Gaudi ones. 

I can’t think of a better area to stay at in Barcelona.
By the way, the Aero Bus (5,30€/person/one way) is going from the airport to Catalunya Square in less than 30 minutes and stops !

The Interior:
Very nicely decorated, but small lobby compared to the huge one of Le Meridien Budapest.
The lobby itself consist of two desks for the reception (with not less than 4 people working on a Saturday!) and separate desks for the concierge.
There is also a “bistrot/café”. 
A bit further away, the elevators (separate ones 1-5 and above 5) and the hall to the main bar, restaurant 111 and breakfast room which is the 111 in fact.

Check in: 
Once again, I called the hotel prior booking to confirm I could have a balcony because I’m a smoker.
Once again, when I called SPG to book and talked about my platinum status to get a balcony, I was answered “we will do our best but cannot guarantee it”.

We were welcomed by a very professional lady to whom I explained my desire to get a balcony. She was checking this with her manager and in the end I got a confirmation.
The welcome package consisted in a free Illy coffee for two, free internet access for our two laptops, free breakfast for 2 every day, a Room Upgrade and free entrance for the museum of modern art.
On top of that, we were offered a late 3PM check out as well.

All went fast and with a true kindness to assist us, including taking care of our enormous luggage!
 
The room: 546 (pls check the pictures)
When going out of the elevator, guests are offered water bottles and apples on a table.
Located on the SPG level, it was not a room but a junior suite.

In the hallway, there is a sliding glass door to separate rest rooms. Then you are in the living room with a comfy sofa, a table, an armchair, a working desk and a chair.
There is also a wall mounted very large flat screen TV and a sliding door giving access to the terrace.

The terrace is huge and offers a very comfortable sofa, a table and two chairs as well as two sun beds prepared with sun bathing towels (see pictures pls).

A double door separates the living room from the bedroom.
In the bed room two twin beds, an armchair and another flat screen TV.
There is a sliding door to the terrace too.
The dressing room, separate from the bed room, features two closets, the minibar, the safe, bags for shoes and all you need for them.

The Air Conditioning/Heating in the room: 
Perfectly working, except that, for some reason, the bathroom stayed quite fresh.

The Bathroom:
Huge and closed by a glass sliding door again.
A second toilet, a wall mounted small flat screen tv, a large bath tub, a separate very large shower, a single sink and plenty of space to move around.

Amenities are Cinq Monde, as usual, and everything is in double quantity: shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, body milk.
On top of that there are cotton pads, cotton buds, a shaving kit, a sewing kit, a dental kit, a comb, …

Comfy slippers and very comfy bathrobes are available too of course.

The Bed:
Good quality, but not as much as the other beds I slept in Le Meridien hotels I think.
Besides that, it was twins and a bit small.

The Breakfast:
Held in 111, the restaurant, the place is very nice to have a breakfast.
It was free for us, as since 1st of March, as a platinum member, you can choose from various welcome gifts or for a free breakfast for two people.
The buffet has all you can which. There is a large choice of juices and coffees as well as eggs done on order.
Fruits, cheese, breads and pastries, local specialties, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, Iberico ham and so on. You know what is a buffet, right?
Nothing is missing.

Room Service:
Not used this time.

Check out:
Fast and easy. 
The lady on duty was from Netherland so we tried to speak a bit of dutch and French together, quite funny and friendly!
The bill was correct and the checkout was a nice moment.

Fitness center/Wellness:
It was under renovation so we will have to check it next time.
Having said that, they proposed vouchers for an external Spa for free.

The Restaurants and bars:
We were offered a coffee in the lobby café and had a quite nice moment in the sofa.
We did very much enjoy the restaurant, 111, where we had dinner on our first night. 
It was not only tasteful but also original and well presented.
As for the service, TOP NOTCH.
It’s located on La Rambla, so in the evening time, it’s great to eat well, in a quite atmosphere, and still have a look on the outside action from time to time.
We went out straight on La Rambla for a after dinner promenade.
Fantastic evening at le 111, we recommend it even if you don’t stay at the hotel.

Business center:
It has it all, and it’s simple to print a document using your USB stick.
There are 3 computers, all logged in, no need to ask for assistance or password.

I really liked:
- Once again, the kindness of the staff and their efficiency in providing exactly what I hopped.
- The way I was considered as a Platinum member is really amazing: Free internet, Junior suite upgrade, free water in the room, and so on. Especially that this time I used points, so except the restaurant bill, nothing cost a cent.
- The friendly atmosphere of the hotel. It’s maybe not the most impressive Le Meridien of the world, but we felt at home.

I really disliked:
I can think about something that was negative during our stay. 

My conclusion:
After such a great experience, although there must be quite a lot of quality hotels in Barcelona, I think I found my home here for my next stays.

There are always reasons to complain or criticize. Paint on the ceilings could be refreshed, or the lobby looks more like a 4 star, not a five star, minor details in fact.
But hey, hotels have to deal with the location and organization. 

At the end of the day, what I look for is to feel at home, fell welcome, have a nice room, tolerance for my addiction to nicotine and on site facilities plus a good location.

Once again, Le Meridien made my stay enjoyable.

Thanks for reading one more bad English review!

All the best,

37,Only average Le Meridien,"Very average. I used SPG points but if I had to pay asking price, this is definitely overpriced. Excellent location and staff very nice. But would leave caveat, that some of staff instructions per getting to various venues often not accurate. Wifi public area connections absolutely terrible and a recurring problem.",3,2012,03,08
37,tiny rooms; premier suite nice,"the service is relatively good; however, the rooms at this property are really small.  At first I stayed in one of the standard, very small rooms.  Then, I received a platinum upgrade to a presige suite, which is nicely done and spacious, occupying the round corner of the building with views along rambla; however, I would never stay at this property again without a certainty of a suite upgrade.  the standard rooms are simply too small.",2,2012,03,07
37,We may have just had a bad room,"Our room seemed to have major electrical issues, our A/C would not work and it was so hot in our room by 1am we were both putting cold towels on our head.  If we were staying longer we would have called the front desk but we were only there for one night and our flight was early the next morning so it seemed pointless.  The location is great to get to all that La Rambla and the gothic quarter has to offer.  Also, it is easy to jump on the metro from this location to see all the awesome sights in Barcelona.  The staff was helpful when getting us to the airport so I can say the service was on par with any other Le Meridian we have stayed.  Our room was just a major disappointment for us but it is not to say we won't try them again on our next stop in Barcelona.",3,2012,03,04
37,solid 4star hotel,"location most probably the best in town
nice not big -solid hotel 
clean big rooms with  one of the most comfortable bed i ever sleept in
nice interior design  as a member of spg got a nice price -for a Full price
dont know if i would stay here !?
eat your breakfest near by the market {La Boqueria}",4,2012,02,23
37,Very central,"Very modern and central hotel in Barcelona. Went there twice. The first time I loved the room, the second time the same type of room was smaller and the view wasn´t so good. But overall a great place.",4,2012,02,22
37,Very nice hotel in the middle of La Rambla,"My husband I stayed at this hotel during our recent visit to Spain in September 2012. We booked the hotel at last minute using Starwood points. The staff was very friendly and courteous, and service was fantastic. The hotel is very pretty, the rooms are very clean and spacious. I didn't like the shower that much but looks like high bath tubes are a standard in Europe. Since I suffer from back pain it was really uncomfortable to get in and out of the shower. However, the room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. I was a bit afraid of staying right in the middle of La Rambla since it is definitely not my favorite place in Barcelona (pickpockets galore!) but even when our room looked over the Rambla street we were not bothered by the noise at late night.",4,2012,02,20
37,Excellent Hotel in a wonderful City.,"Central location, excellent staff and comfortable rooms.  The staff could not be more accomodating and generally helpful and friendly.  We were upgraded upon arrival (SPG Gold members) and had a wonderful view of the activity in La Rambla.  Only 200 metres from Place de Catalunia and all the transport hubs and a short ramble (!) down to the fascinating Port area.  We loved it and will certainly return.  Congratulations Le Meridien!",5,2012,02,20
37,Do not have room service!!!,"Here I am in one of the top gastromic cities in the world....but have so much paperwork to catch up on I decided to stay in for the night. I noticed trip adviser listed a good restaurant on site....so I decided to do room service...assuming it would be made in the same kitchen...so should be good. BIG MISTAKE!!! Not only was the club sandwich really really bad....the turkey in the sandwich was so hard I could kill a pedestrian if I threw it out for the stray cats to eat! The bread slices were cut way too thick and the whole concoction reminded me of a Fawlty Towers skit when the chef left early....leaving basil alone in the kitchen. I wonder who made this sandwich???? I shudder to think!
Without a doubt.....THE WORST room service food I have EVER had......£24 for club sandwich and coca cola....I expected a bit more. ",3,2012,02,17
37,"Great location, not quite Le Meridien standards","The location of the hotel is terrific.  The rooms were not up to par condition, cleanliness or comfort wise compared to Le Meridien properties we have stayed at in Asia.  This was our first time staying at a Le Meridien in Europe.  At all times the staff were very attentive and helpful, they also spoke fluent English which was very helpful to our limited spanish.  Beware in the winter time the hotel does not have control of temperature in the rooms, the heat is always on unless you turn it off and open the windows to cool off the room, the thermostat does not allow any AC in winter.  Wifi in the lobby on the weekend did not exist, we had great luck with it during the week.  The breakfast buffet was fabulous during the week with frequent business travelers through the hotel, the buffet noticeably declined on the weekend.  We were disappointed at the lack of local wine on the menu, one would think there would be more spanish and less California wine on the menu when at a hotel close to wine region in Spain.  The rooms were comfortable but obviously due for a rehab sometime in the not so distant future, the suites were in the process of being renovated while we were there.  All in all we had a fabulous time and I would stay here again as well as recommend it to friends.",4,2012,02,12
37,Excellent location & service staff!,"The hotel was located right in the heart of everything. We could get to restaurants, the subway, the market, attractions, etc., all by walking. What topped it all for us was the excellent service at the hotel. The staff was really amazing: they were unfailingly polite, helpful, and cheerful. When we couldn't get the free Internet on our laptop, the front manager even gave us free access to the high-speed Internet for our entire stay. This was without us asking for it at all! It was really wonderful to be able to walk about the incredible city and then retire for the night in this lovely hotel!",5,2012,02,08
37,Great location but a few misses,"To start the location is great, just steps from las ramblas and tourist sites. The hotel was clean and the staff were helpful. 

There were a few issues though. 

First: my room was way too hot and there was no air in the winter so j had to sleep with a sheet and the window open all night, which was loud at night. 

Second: the wifi is awful. Sporadic at best it has the strength of dial up from back in the day. Just be aware if you, like me, were expecting to have better access. And at 19euros a night it is SUPER pricy.

A good hotel but go in eyes open. ",5,2012,01,30
37,Location really IS everything.....,"Location really IS everything!  My husband and I travelled to Barcelona on a much needed vacation.  Upon entering the city, we instantly fell in love with the people, sights and most especially Le Meridien Barcelona.  The location of this hotel was the first thing we noticed - it is in the heart of Las Ramblas - the most entertaining + exciting part of town.  Upon check-in we were enthralled with the beautiful decor, the spacious room, and the superb staff.  Our room was large enough to store all our things for seven nights comfortably, it was beautifully appointed and impeccibly clean.  All of the associates were top-notch...everyone from the concierge, front desk team, restaurant brigade, and bell staff was exceptional.  Our baristas prepared the most delicous espressos each morning, and Conchi in the bar makes the most perfect cocktails in the evening.  Truly a wonderful hotel....",5,2012,01,30
37,excellent hotel with an excellent location,"We loved this hotel. It is situated right on La Rambla, moreover closer to the Northern, more attractive part of it (in my opinion). The staff of the hotel is very pleasant and nice.
The only thing we didn't like is concierge recommendations of local restaurants. The recommended restaurants were boring and unattractive. 
The rooms were pretty small but with a nice size bathroom. If the windows overlook La Rambla, it gets really noisy by night time until around 3 am.
Overall, a very nice hotel with the best possible location!",5,2012,01,27
37,"""THE BEST IN BARCELONA""","Without a shadow of doubt one of the best hotel I've stayed in. Incredible service, great staff, fabulous ambience & decor, excellent restaurants. One couldn't fault any aspect of service.",5,2012,01,27
37,OK but could do with looking at the small personal touches.,"Stay for 5 night in the last week of December. We were with our 12 yr old child.
We tend to book into branded group hotels to avoid any nasty surprise and be sure of the standard of room and room service.
Le Meridien was as expect good quality room clean etc 
But the staff were impersonal, there was complimentary tea and coffee but only for 2. There were 3 of us and we did have to pay extra for our child. On 2 occasions we did ring room service for another cup and tea bag. Ultimately we just bought some tea bags from a corner shop.
For a 5star hotel it did seem miserly and petty to put just 2teabags.
There was a health centre for the hotel but at a different premise - the hotel website conveniently ignored to mention that!!
",2,2012,01,22
37,Pros and cons,"We spent five nights here recently.  Firstly, the positives...

- Really friendly and helpful staff, especially those in the restaurant.
- Food in the restaurant was great.  Normally we mix it up and eat in and out - but we ate in all five nights - that's how good it was!
- Food was quite reasonably priced with set menus for lunch and dinner at around EUR16-19.  Three courses from the menu would otherwise be around EUR30-40 pp.  Coffees in the bar were around EUR2-2.5.
- Great location for touristing and within walking distance of public transport and tourist buses.  Also great for shopping.
- Our room and the hotel generally was clean and tidy.

Now the cons...

- The noise!!!  OMG - our room was at the back of the hotel (i.e. NOT on La Rambla where you would expect noise) and the street noise just came right in with the windows closed.  So much for double glazing??  There was a fire a few doors down on one night and the smell came right in too.  We were on level 2 so maybe being higher up would have been better, but it made for five disturbed nights sleep.
- Internet access - free in the lobby for 30 minutes at a time (you had to keep logging in) but restricted to 512k/s download speed.  Very expensive in the room (EUR19 for 24 hours and faster but not that fast).  Also, for some inexplicable reason, Apple devices are  problematic and sometimes didn't connect.  Surely this can be fixed?  We had lots of trouble with three Apple devices and the front staff kindly cancelled our internet charges as a result on check-out.
- The spa - well, there is no spa!  It's curenetly a converted hotel room with a therapist who comes in for appointments.  I understand it's under renovation, but the website really ought to say that. 
- Car parking cost EUR35/night.  You don't really need a car in Barcelona so think about offlloading the car and the rehiring if needed rather than paying for parking.",4,2012,01,22
37,convenient for tourist,"the hotel is located right on the busiest/tourist street in barcelona. The hotel is clean and wifi reliable. We were upgraded to a suite due to overbooking at the W, the staff was very polite and did everything possible to make up for the inconvenience...which is not much of a inconvenience at all since we planed on going there to check out the tourist areas anyways. 

The one thing I did not like about the rooms were that they are very dark. This is not a tall building and there are always buildings around it so it was difficult to get some natural sun light into the rooms. All other aspects of the hotel was great.",5,2012,01,21
37,Best place to stay,I stayed at the Le Merdien for 4 nights and was very happy I selected this hotel. I am a SPG Platinum member and was immediately upgraded to a suite. The hotel is in the process of renovating all their rooms and I recommend requesting a newer room. The staff was extremely helpful with anything the was asked of them. The location is one of the best in Barcelona and other firends who have stayed there confirmed this with me. The lobby bar is perfect for coffe and pastries in the morning and there is a wonderful breakfast buffet in the restaurant if you want more. There are many good restaurants in walking distance of the hotel. I will be returning to Barcelona in two months and have already booked my stay at the Le Merdien,5,2012,01,19
37,Swept away by romance in Barcelona,"After spending much time in Barcelona over the past decade I was worried that staying directly on the famous Ramblas would be too ""touristy"". However, the sheer convenience of the hotel and proximity to the metro, sites and (perhaps most importantly) the beach make staying at the Le Meridien very enjoyable. Both the Hotel Arts and newly built W Hotel (I have stayed at both) are too far from the center of town. As someone who enjoys walking around big cities, both the Arts and W are just too out of the way and require costly taxi rides to and from the center. As is the case with previous Le Meridiens I have stayed at, the service was top notch. The entire staff spoke English which always helps, and offered us free museum tickets and advice to restaurants and other ""must see"" attractions in the city. For anyone looking for that perfect romantic European getaway...go to Barcelona, stay at the Le Meridien and leave the sleeping for the flight home.",5,2012,01,16
37,"Ideal location, great staff","We booked this hotel after a late minute cancellation of an alternative booking, and were very thankful we had. The location is ideal, with the old town a very short walk away, the Market almost next door and La Ramblas the conduit to the Metro and bus services. 
The staff are friendly and professional. We arrive early in the day and fully expected to leave our luggage and explore the local area, however the ""trainee"" receptionist very quickly offered some alternatives (non starwood room,lower floor) which provided for immediate allocation. All of our interactions with the staff showed this willingness to communicate with guests rather than a rote solution to a request.
The room was quiet, as requested, and overlooked the side street. The bathroom luxurious after a month in Africa, and the furnishings and linen of the usual high Le Meridien standard.
Most of all the Lobby Bar ambiance and ideal light menu, combined with free WiFi made our stay exceptional.",5,2012,01,12
37,Good for a conference venue,"I need to be cautious here as I stayed for only two nights in December 2011.  Both evenings were spent with the people I was working with in restaurants outside the hotel, and for the most part during the day I was running / facilitating a training course.  None the less, there are a couple of observations I need to make...

The first is about focus on the customer... when I checked in I found I had an old 'Meridien' loyalty card in my briefcase - and always been one for collecting points I asked if it was still valid.  Well, actually no it wasn't - not by a few years!  So the helpful receptionist said she'd set up my details and provide me with a new card - no problem.  

Having checked in I went up to my room - and the receptionist rang a few minutes later to say that she'd 'found' me on the system and would be issuing me with a temporary card - turns out that I'd registerred a long time ago to SPG Group - of which the Meridien brand is a part.  Very good service me thinks!

I had only a few minutes in my room before going down to meet my Group for the first time, who were about to go out to dinner and wanted me to join them (this was around 7.30pm).  As we were walking UP THE STREET just outside the hotel, the duty manager ran out after us and gave me my new card with my existing SPG Group loyalty card number on it.  Not surprisingly, this set a rather good impression!

The gripe I have is with the conference room we had - there was no natural light at all.  I spent 1 1/2 days with the Group, which in a room like that would normally have been OK.  However, the training session I facilitated was part of a larger conference - they'd been in there already for 2 1/2 days before I worked with them!  

My second postive comment though is about flexibilty and conference support.  Whenever I wanted anything, I was provided it quickly and without question.  This included extra flip chart paper, a snack in the conference room rather than a meal in the restaurant (for me when I set the room up for the course which begain 2.00pm on Day 1), photocopies, etc.  Exactly the sort of professional service I want when facilitating a course.

My accommodation was very clean and very comfortable.  

So overall, for business I'd say it's an interesting place for a conference.  Facilities are fine, service is very good, and being right in the middle of Barcelona you have plenty of restaurants and other interesting places close by to go to of an evening.  I'd certainly feel comfy if I was asked to work there again.",5,2012,01,08
37,Guest Service Focus,"I agree with other reviewers regarding the small room size. Also, don't be seduced by the La Ramblas view ""upgrade"" as it is anything but.  Although you do have view of the street activity and privacy from adjacent buildings the rooms are smaller and the street noise can be very distracting late into the night/morning.

The breakfast buffet was expensive and didn't vary from day to day so after 5 days we were quite tired of it.

Where this hotel shines is its location and service.  The staff were all pleasant and helpful from check in to ice delivery to wait staff in lobby coffee bar.

They also have a lovely tradition called Vespers when they ""turn down the lights and turn up the music"" in the Lobby and toast the end of the day and the beginning of night with a complimentary glass of very good Spanish sparkling wine.",4,2012,01,05
37,Great hotel - perfect location!,"The staff was wonderful and really helpful. The location can't be beat. The rooms are a bit small, but that's European hotels for you.",5,2012,01,05
37,"Central location, well-maintained facilities","This hotel has a wonderful location - right on the Ramblas, just a 5-minute walk from Placa de Catalunya. The main entrance to the hotel is on a fairly silent, very fascinating side street. My recommendation is to try to get a room facing either this side street or the ""back yard"" of the hotel. Even on the second floor, the ""back yard"" view was fairly nice and the silence in terms of not being disturbed by the street noise was guaranteed. There are fairly many nice restaurants within a short walking distance from the hotel. 

What I particularly liked about this hotel is the fact that you get a fairly predictable Le Meridien service experience with a certain amount of local twist added to it. The staff of the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the front desk staff. Thank you for that. 

My room was fairly spacious and well-designed. It was a nice, well-balanced combination of modern European and slightly more Spanish design. There were enough power sockets in the room and they were located at the right places - something that you cannot always take for granted even at 5-star hotels. The bathroom was particularly spacious, very modern, and - even more importantly - extremely clean. 

For some reason, my back never really got used to the bed in my room. I am not sure whether this can truly be attributed to the bed or whether my back is simply used to an excessively good and highly tailored bed back at home. 

One thing that keeps amazing me at most of the hotels, including this hotel, is the fact that there is oftentimes only one door, instead of two, leading from the corridor to each room. I understand that two doors eat up some valuable space in rooms (especially when kept open), but one door is simply not enough to guarantee a sufficient amount of silence and sleep quality in the room. I found this situation fairly disturbing during my stay especially when my room was located fairly close to the elevators and the hotel seemed to be fairly full. 

As said earlier, the service at Le Meridien Barcelona was good, but not perfect. My apologies for the readers of this review, as I do not want to go into details here, but the staff made one fairly critical service blunder during my stay at the hotel - this was a one-time, isolated incident that could have caused some more serious problems. When they discovered it, they fixed the problem immediately, and sent me a nice bottle of wine as a token of apology. So, no harm done, and they clearly identified this as an area for improvement and provided a very credible explanation why this happened and why/how this will not happen again in the future.

As is typical for most 5-star hotels in Europe, be prepared to pay (too much) for the wi-fi access and breakfast. Yes, the wi-fi access in the reception/lobby area is free of charge, but you end up paying approximately EUR 20 for the wi-fi access (for 24 hours) in the room which is ridiculous. Regarding the breakfast, yes - it is expensive, but it is also very substantial, caters to all tastes and preferences, and is made of very high-quality ingredients. So, I am willing to admit here that you will get a good value for the money. 

In spite of some hiccups listed above, Le Meridien Barcelona is a very good hotel and provides an excellent base for exploring the City of Barcelona. The facilities of the hotel are very well-maintained and truly provide a nicely designed, atmospheric environment for relaxing after a busy day in the city. The concierge is most willing to help you find and focus on the most interesting attractions in the city, and he was also very knowledgeable about the things to see and do in the city. The same can be said about the front desk staff.",4,2012,01,01
37,Great location and staff,"Great location at the middle of Las Ramblas. Friendly and helpful staff.  Great rooms, good size for European standard and very clean.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2011,12,28
37,A quality luxury hotel in a fantastic location,"A friend and I did a two-night stay at Le Meridien prior to a Mediterranean cruise.  We chose the Meridien for its stature as a luxury property and for its excellent location, right in the middle of the Las Ramblas pedestrian thoroughfare and adjacent to the Gothic Quarter.  While pricier than other nearby hotels, the rate was not unreasonable for a metropolitan city like Barcelona.

We arrived around 10 a.m. after an overnight flight from the U.S., and (as we expected for a weekend stay) our room was not yet ready.  The receptionist gave us coupons for free coffee at the lobby's coffee bar, and offered us free admission to a nearby art museum to pass the time.  I greatly appreciated the extension of this offer for early arrivals, but after enjoying our coffee we chose to start exploring Barcelona on our own.

We returned later in the day and went to our room -- a large, well-appointed room with two double beds, and a modern bathroom with a rainforest shower head (I loved this!).  We found an outdoor deck adjacent to the spa with a nice view above the rooftops of the city.  The hotel also provides free bottled water, placed near the elevators on every floor.

(Our room did not face Las Ramblas, so I can't comment on whether or not the lively activity is audible in some of the rooms.)

I've also stayed at Le Meridien in San Francisco, and found the same quality and luxury extended to the Barcelona property as well.",5,2011,12,28
37,On going renovations,"This could have been a fantastic stay if the hotel knew how to handle their on going renovations which from a poster near the elevator are stated to last until the end of January 2012.

We arrived at the hotel around 4pm and the check-in process took around 10-12 minutes. I think the girl who was checking us in was a trainee. The hotel is in a great location near the city center right next to Las Ramblas. A very short walk to the nearest metro station and just beyond that access to the Aerobus which can take you too and from the airport for very cheap. The hotel has a very modern lobby, most usually comment on the weird video installations. One thing that really stood out during our trip was the obscure music in the elevator which usually consisted of a soundtrack that simulates being flushed down the toilet. If you think I'm joking search Youtube for Le Meridien Barcelona elevator, not something you expect from a 5 star hotel.

We were woken up our first morning on the 5th floor with strong jack-hammering noises that sounded as if they were coming within a few feet above our room. This started at 9am. I contacted the front desk about the noise and they informed me about the renovations on the 6th and 7th floor and told me that the whole hotel could hear these noises and pretty much hung up on me after that. I just want to state here that I never received an email about the renovations before my stay and both the SPG website for the hotel and regular website make no mention of on going renovations. During my check in I was never told about the renovations as well. I emailed Goncalo Duarte, the general manager, about the noises and he quickly responded that he was sorry about the noises and that he would make sure they stopped. The noises stopped shortly after his response. He also promised in his email that there would be no more work done on the floors above us for the next two days. Well the next morning exactly at 9 am the same loud pounding started again waking us up. Not much of a vacation when you can't sleep in.

The hotel responded by moving us up to the 8th floor into a Mediterranean Suite. The suite was very comfortable and offered excellent views of Las Ramblas. Though, I believe we only got one day off from the renovations noises. The noises were not as loud from the 8th floor, but I would say it was about a 15% decrease in the noise. During our 5 night stay we were given a bowl of fruit, bottle of cheap wine, and a plate with snacks. I'm going to guess that these were apology gifts and not for my birthday, but I wouldn't know since there was no note attached. The gifts and room move were very much appreciated, but the renovations really ruined my experience at this hotel and made my birthday vacation not as enjoyable as I hoped. I feel it is unfair not to warn guests before checking into the hotel about the noise issues that may affect their stay. I selected the Le Meridien over the W hotel due to very positive reviews by fellow travelers and because of it's locations, but if I knew there would be so many issues due to the renovations I would have picked the W hotel. 

The GM of this hotel, Gonçalo Duarte Silva, seems to be much more active in guest relations than any other Starwood hotel that I've stayed at. I feel this is a very positive thing to have in a hotel, but I cannot understand why there was no follow up on his behalf after I personally contacted him by email. Either there were a lot of people that had the same issues I had, or the communication between the front desk management and the GM is poor.",2,2011,12,28
37,Great Location but Highly Overrated,"Great Location on Las Ramblas and a delicious large assortment breakfast buffet, but hotel ambiance and amenities are equivalent of 4 star property.  Standard room size is not very large. First time anywhere that I ever complained about bed mattresses being too low to the ground and very uncomfortable. I was advised all rooms had similar bedding. This is a good hotel if being on the center of Las Ramblas is important to you. Otherwise there are many better properties at a more reasonable cost in Barcelona.",3,2011,12,23
37,Great location,"Great location, right on the Ramblas, and a block away from La Boqueria. The rooms were spacious, however we were given one in a lower level and with no view at all, I guess because we had an employee rate. The room had a nice large bathroom, a comfortable bed and a coffee maker, which was really helpful in the mornings. We used the free business center, but nothing else in the hotel, since our stay in Barcelona was short and hardly spent any time in the hotel.The staff was really helful as well, and the housekeeping service, impeccable.",4,2011,12,20
37,Barcelona,"The staff was great and in particular he Front Desk Manager, Salvador, was very helpful and should be commended for his attention to elite Starwood Gold guests. He made sure we were checked in as early as possible which, after a long journey from the US east coast was very important to my wife and I.

The concierge staff was knowledgeable and arranged a few attractions that were fantastic Gaudi ""artforms"" to experience. The restaurants were as expected based on our experience in Madrid and La Manga, very very good especially Cafe de L 'Academia.",5,2011,12,12
37,Nice central location,"This hotel is ranked as 5 stars but it is equivelant to a 4 star in North America.
Room was spacious and clean, unique bathroom with glass seperation but they need to widen the partition for the shower as the floor gets all wet everytime after the shower. 
Did include coffees in room as well as ironing board and pant press machine.
Staff in general are friendly and helpful.
Nice restaurant for dinner, paid 19 Euro for a 3 course meal and was nicely done.
They will only give you a discount of 30% if you have their buffet breakfast for the duration of your stay, I only wanted 1 day and they refuse to give me the discount unless I eat there for 3 mornings (duration of my stay), tons of nice restaurant right outside to pick from for cheaper breakfast.
Very central location, walk to a lot of attractions and to the waterfront complex.",4,2011,12,09
37,Great Location!,"The hotel is right on Las Ramblas, so you cant beat the location. The room had definitely been updated, but they were doing work on other rooms as I heard some banging from the construction. My favorite part of the room was the bathroom and shower as well as the toiletries. The bed was a little too soft for my liking. The staff was also very nice and extremely helpful. I would definitely stay here again when I travel back to Barcelona!",4,2011,12,06
37,Wonderful Hotel,"We booked late Thursday evening and arrived on Friday in Barcelona, We got an amazing price on this hotel and i was not disappointed in anyway nor despite the fact i'd sure i paid a lot less than most was i treated any differently by the staff. From when we 1st checked in until the moment we left, everything was perfect, the location is amazing, the staff, polite, helpful and engaging. The room was lovely and the glass of champers we got when we came back from our walk to 'say goodbye to the day and hello to the night' was a lovely gesture. The concierge listens to our request and style we wanted for dinner and recommended a fantastic restaurant, it was exactly what we wanted. If i had one moan it would be breakfast, the service on the 1st morning was terrible, we waited almost an hour for the food we ordered, noone came up and even asked us if we wanted more coffee, when i finally asked where our breakfast was, i was told 5 more mins, no apology or explanation, the staff were most of the time nowhere to be seen ! On the 2nd morning it was slightly better only a 25 min wait, but still only one pot of coffee, noone asked us if we wanted more and i had steamed egg !!! God knows what took so long. 

However overall this is an amazing hotel, with great staff, great cocktails, Illy coffee and in an amazing location.... I would 100% stay here again.",4,2011,12,05
37,Barcelona on Las Ramblas,"Great Hotel right in the center of the action on Las Ramblas. Room was small but remodeled with great furnishings, and great bathroom with an awesome rain shower. Flat screen TV's with English language programming. 

Restaurant on site was exceptional.

 Watch out for the pick pockets and thieves however. It's a cottage industry in Barcelona.

Hotel staff left a lot to be desired. Friendly does not seem to be a word anybody on staff understood. But Cleanliness was outstanding and the location made up for any negatives. Would stay here again.",4,2011,12,03
37,Avoid for a meeting as banquet hall has pillars,"We were in Barcelona for a conference and stayed at this hotel. The room was a decent size, though in the centre of barcelona, so that was the good part. The room had a strange musty smell that pretty much remained for a couple of days. I had to switch on the AC and keep the window open to rid the room of the strange smell.

Service at the bar was crappy. Dont blame the bartender, though as there was only one person attending to our drinks for the entire evening that day. The poor guys was good but he was struggling to keep up with the volume.

Location is very very good. Food is OK, but who eats in the hotel when in Barcelona. Did not have breakfast on any of the days so cant comment on the breakfast. Avoid the conference room at all costs if you are planning to have a meeting. It has four large awkward pillars in the middle of the hall.",3,2011,12,02
37,Excellent hotel in La Ramblas,"We recently stayed for 3 nights on our honeymoon based on previous reviews and I must say that overall we were very happy with our stay and in general this hotel is as one would expect a 5 star Le Meridien hotel to be. Very contemporary in design and well laid out with a perfect position in the middle of bustling La Ramblas.

I had booked via Laterooms.com and I am an SPG member and requested a high floor and non-smoking room as previous reviews had suggested that the noise  from the lower floors can be a bit over the top. Upon check-in I was shocked to discover they had me on the first floor. I asked if my requests could be honoured in some way and mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and then thats when things changed. A pity I had to mention this but relieved when they found a room on the third level and we had been upgraded to a Prestige suite overlooking Las Ramblas. A very spacious and modern room with a lovely bathroom and sepearte lounde room with circular couch. We were very impressed and also delighted to be higher up. However, being higher up at this hotel does not protect you from the noise. the partying in Barcelona doen't stop until about 6am so it was noisey all night, however we were in good spirits and it didn't really bother us. If I stayed here on business they may be a diffrent story.

The hotel is centrally located and a short walk to the hop on hop off buses and all that Barcelona has to offer. the one thing which I just can't get my head around is the charge for internet access in room. This is the only 5 star hotel out of 10 that on this world trip wanted to charge for in room internet or WiFi - THIS IS CRAZY. At over 250 Euro per night I think this should be included. It is however available in the lobby but this is not always convenient.

The overall servive in the hotel was good, the security in and out of the hotel fantastic and gave peace of mind to everyone.

When we departed the hotel ensured we had a fully insured, clean, trusted taxi for our transport needs which we really appreciated, especially travelling with thousands of dollars worth of luggage etc.

Overall a very good properrty.",4,2011,12,01
37,"How much longer will we be ripped off by luxury hotels overcharging for ""broadband""?","How do 5 Star Hotels like Le Meridien Barcelona have the cheek to charge €20 per day for not-very-fast so-called ""broadband"" internet access? When are luxury hotels going to acknowledge that internet access is increasingly as essential to quality accomodation as hot water or clean sheets? It's really outrageous. I am now making a personal policy of avoiding such hotels.",2,2011,11,29
37,Wheelchair Accessible Review,"We only stayed for one night at the hotel but we enjoyed it.  My wife uses a wheelchair so I will review from that point of view to assist others in our situation.

The hotel was completely wheelchair accessible from what we encountered.  The lobby and restaurant had ramps where it was needed and there were no spots that we could not access.  The only issue we encountered was that there was no ramp into the lobby through the front door, you had to use a small lift about 10 feet from the front door.  However, there was always at least one employee outside such as security or bellman and they would operate the lift so we didn't have any issues with it.  You can also enter the hotel through the hotel restaurant that borders La Ramblas because that it at street level.

We booked an accessible room and a standard room, both facing La Ramblas.  Both rooms had two full beds and the accessible room was well designed.  The bathroom had a roll-in shower with a built-in bench.  The only issue with the bathroom is that there was no shower curtain for the shower so you had to be careful not to spray the entire bathroom, which can be tricky.  

The room was large by European hotel standards and was easy to move the wheelchair in.  One small concern regarding the bed height, the beds are lower than most hotels so that can make getting in and out of the bed difficult if you have limited mobility.

The location is fantastic, it is in the center of La Ramblas and walking distance to many interesting sites.  The downside is that it's very noisy so this is not a good location if you want peace and quiet.

Service was very good and most of the staff spoke English, which was very helpful for us.  We would recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona",4,2011,11,24
37,Location is tops; Rooms modern & nice; staff only OK,"We had a great time at this hotel.  By far, the best thing was its location.  La Ramblas is one of the best spots in Barcelona, and this hotel is smack dab in the middle of all the action.  

The rooms were fine.  What you would expect from a Le Meridien hotel.  Modern lines and decor.  

The staff was OK ... but not great.  Whenever we asked for advice on dinner, sights, etc., they would rush their answer and generally try to get rid of us.  That was even when there was not line behind us.  Thankfully, we didn't need to use them much.",4,2011,11,19
37,We loved it!,"Location... It doesn't get any better, right on the la rambla st which in my opinion there is no other place to stay if you are a tourist. There's shops, restaurants, street performers definitely a lot to see on this street. The ocean is 10-15min walk down la rambla and the plaza de cataluna 5-10 min walk this is where all the hop on hop off bus tours stop so this makes it easy to start your tour. The  Hotel inside has modern look to it very cool looking. The rooms have the  same modern look we were very pleased.   Free bottles of water and fruit outside of the elevator on the way to your room.  We stayed in 9 hotels throughout our trip in Europe and this was our favorite.",5,2011,11,17
37,"Great Location , Great service!","The hotel is well located, right at the La Rambla.. The rooms are not bad,they'r relatively neat and clean but i have the following observations :
1. the carpet in the rooms are not clean
2. the window is tooooo small, and the view from the room was the roof tops of the adjacent buildings,which only made me close the curtains so that i won't get angry about it!
3. the house keeping won't do your room before 3 pm... as i have been back to my rooms on two consecutive days ,at around 3 and the rooms are not ready yet!
4.breakfast is kind of served late ,as it starts at 7.30 , unlike most of the hotels all around the world",4,2011,11,16
37,Good hotel great location,"Great location just off La Rambla. Very spacious room large bed and nice bathroom with the best overhead shower I have ever had. 
Breakfast was also very good. ",4,2011,11,16
37,"Perfect location, small but stylish room, great service.","This may be one of the favorite hotels we've stayed at. The location was unbeatable. I can see why some of the reviewers are mentioning noise, the hotel was right on Las Ramblas. Our room faced the side street and was on the 5th floor and we weren't bothered by noise at all (you could hear ambulances or police cars, but that's it). If concerned about noise I would request a room on the side street on a high floor. 
   The room was small, but stylish, and the reviewers who are posting the outdated photos I think are lying. Everything looked new, and I can't imagine a hotel of this caliber having outdated rooms like I saw in one particular T.A. review on this site. The bathroom was great, although the toilet was really wedged in there. There was plenty of light, which I find is sometimes a problem in the Starwood hotels, and the bed was among the most comfortable we've ever slept in. The in-room internet is 19 euros a day and was slow and very unreliable. i would skip it and just trek down to the lobby for the free internet...which is also slow, but it's free. Also worth noting, is that the room service was actually reasonably priced. There was a small up charge but nothing like we usually see here in the states. Also, the room service food was pretty good! 
    The hotel is literally steps from everywhere you want to go. Shopping, the metro (which was easy to use), even the Mediterranean sea was walkable. The concierge and desk staff were excellent, and remembered our names which was impressive. 
     We didn't eat in the restaurant but did drink in the bar every day. The drinks are expensive, but very good, as was the service. I would recommend a trip to the grocery store which is 3 doors down to buy your liquor. the wine at the liquor store was about 2 euros A BOTTLE! It's hard to justify 6 euros a glass when you can walk 5 steps and get a whole bottle for 1/3 the price...but alas...it's a touristy hotel...so all is forgiven. 
    I had two challenges with the hotel. The first was the check in. I had called in advance to request an early check in because were were taking the red eye. We arrived at 8am and were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. UNderstandable because no guarantees were made, but still, we REALLY wanted to shower and sleep. They were very nice about it though and I understand the early check in thing can be a problem (however our friends who stayed at the W Hotel got right in to their room). The second thing that rubbed me the wrong way was when i ordered a Diet Coke in the hotel lobby. Now I expect to pay more at a hotel, but the can of diet coke was 5 EUROS, that's more then $7 for a can of Coke. I almost passed out. Later I saw a 2 liter of Coke a the grocery store mentioned above for .5 euros, so the overcharge was definitely not a European thing...it was a rip off thing. 
    SUGGESTIONS: 1) join the starwood points club. it's free and they provide unlimited apples and bottled water on the starwood floors (or just go to a starwood floor and load up). Other hotels charge 2-3 euros a bottle for H20. 2) Ask for the AAA rate. it will save you lots of money and they never asked to see our card, although we did have it with us just in case. 3) Go to the grocery store just down the street (its on the same block) and load up on beer, wine, soda, and other 'rip-off' items. 4) Learn to use the metro, it will save you tons of money and was clean and safe (during day).",5,2011,11,13
37,Very good location,"We had booked in for 3 nights back in June 2011,and requested ,and paid for,a suite overlooking the Ramblas.
Unlike other reviewers we were downgraded when checking in!We were given a very small room-nothing like we had booked.
On returning to reception to complain,the complaint was relayed up until finally a supervisor was detailed to sort out the error.
It was eventually resolved and we were allocated a suite as originally booked.As an apology
a bottle of wine was sent to our room which was a very nice touch.
All in all the matter was dealt with in a very professional and friendly way-full marks to the reception team on duty at the time.
One small point after reading other reviews- we were not informed by anyone of the 7 pm wine tasting in the lobby.
Would certainly use Le Meriden again next time in Barcerlona.",5,2011,11,13
37,"Great hotel, staff, and location!","Just finishing a 5 night stay.  Very pleased.  Got a room upgrade.  Great views of city.  Perfect location to walk the world-famous La Rumbla area, shopping, markets, harbourfront, subway stops, sightseeing, etc.  There is a food store right next to the hotel and so many restaurants right outside the door.  Fitness centre is good.  Internet worked perfectly.  Very nicely decorated and the staff are fantastic!  bathrooms are large and ours had a walk-in shower with rainshow head which was great.  very cute lobby.  wine daily at 7pm in lobby is a nice touch!  we would definitely be back.  We walked to the new W hotel and went up to the 26th floor just to see the views but would definitely stay here over the W based on location.",5,2011,11,12
37,"Close to Rambla, easy to access.","We used SPG points to stay a this property.  This is the 2nd time we have stayed in Barcelona.  We wanted to be a bit closer to Rambla and to the port since we were staying there for one night pre and post cruise.

Check in staff and porters were quick and friendly.  

We did not have a problem at all with noise in either of our rooms but we were not overlooking Rambla and would not have asked to be for that reason.  Love the area but not the noise, so we were very pleased in that sense.

The room was a bit tight of a squeeze with suitcases but we got the smallest room type.  The bed is not a king, it is a queen.  Sometimes it is hard to tell when you book a 'double' in Europe but it worked out ok.  I, personally, don't like the bathroom all open with the shower right there on the toilet area but it was not enough to make a huge difference. When we did our post cruise our room had a tub.  Love that there is a TV in the bathroom since I had finished my book and wanted a long bath.  Nice that they had tea items in the room.

We did have a bit of a problem with communication with the staff right after we left the hotel (literally max 10 mins after we left) as we had left something in the room and were already at the port and had JUST  gotten out of the taxi to board the ship.  The person who answered the phone said they would call housekeeping IMMEDIATELY and ask about our child's stuffed animal left in the bed.  If they had contacted housekeeping immediately it surely would have been found. They were to check with the housekeeper and hold it till we returned 11 days later to stay overnight again and to call me back before we left the port.  I would not believe that they had already done our room and left and disposed of our sheets completely that quickly, if anything the bed had been stripped but sheets still in the housekeeping cart or in a bag in the hallway where they leave them for a bit for cleaning pickup.  I realize that the front desk was busy but they could have just said 'nope, we won't do that, or cannot do that' instead they did transfer me to someone they said could contact housekeeping immediately.

I left my cell phone on until the ship left-no call back.  That was about 2 hrs.  My husband could NOT go back to the hotel to ask as you must be on board 2 hrs prior to departure and there was a line.  At 3 of the ports I paid to go online and email the staff again asking why no return call and why no reply to emails.  Still no replies by the time we got back to Barcelona.  The ball was dropped by whomever I spoke to on the phone AND whomever answers emails.  I know the email address was valid as prior to the trip I had emailed with questions and had a prompt reply.  It is not like our child would die without the item, and we know it was our fault for leaving it but what if it had been something else? 

When we stayed on the return the people acted like they had no idea what we were talking about. I did not press it at the front desk as there were many people in line and it could be addressed later. I did not want to inconvenience other guests or upset the staff even though I was pretty miffed.

I did continue to email after coming back and STILL with no response.  

I did email again about 6 months later when I got an email from this hotel about some promos going on and told them what happened.  I did get a reply that they would upgrade us to a Ramblas View if we stay again. This was in September and our stay was in February.  I have over a dozen emails that were sent and I had made 5 phone calls in that 2 hr time frame from the ship right after we left the hotel. 

Outside of that, it was worth it for the SPG points and some of the special rates appear reasonable also considering the quality of the room and the location.",4,2011,11,12
37,"Plush beds, could have been quieter","One could argue that for the money, this is not the 5-star hotel one would hope for. The many review books indicate that at this price, additional amenities should be included, such as a pool. However, as my husband and I were recently gifted the hotel stay from my brother as part of our honeymoon present, we didn't argue a bit with what we experienced at Le Meridien. It is clearly decked-out to the nines, in quite possibly the best geographic location in the entire city, and the rooms themselves are plush and comfortable. Bonuses that we enjoyed from the get-go included nice bathroom products, soft, luxurious beds, and upon check-in, we also were given two free tickets to the Museo de Arte Contemporare (MACBA) and a voucher for two free coffees at the breakfast bar downstairs during our stay. 

Because of the gifted hotel stay, we were on a Starwood Preferred Guests floor (4), and were told that fresh fruit and water would be available by the elevator every two hours. When we left the hotel the first morning at 10 AM or so, only a few green apples and one water bottle remained. A few hours later when we returned before lunch, the food/drinks had not been replenished. I learned the next morning to go grab two bottles and two apples as soon as we woke up.

Most wonderful about the room was the large, spacious rainforest shower, with a second head that could be removed from the wall. The shower was lined in slate and had a fantastic pressure. The bathroom sink did not have a large vanity, but there were many shelves and ledges on which to place our toiletries. 

The room, number 406, was laid out quite rectangularly. Directly across from the entry door was a closet with a sliding door, which had a built-in ironing board. I would have liked more room to hang clothes. Just past this was the spacious bathroom, and then the beds (we were given two adjacent twin beds placed together like a giant king bed) and room space. There was a nicely sized sofa chair and small glass table on which we were able to open our suitcases. The TV was affixed to the wall, a large plasma screen. One thing I didn't like about this was that, as in many international hotels, the TV automatically resets back to the hotel menu. I had to punch in my ""profile"" every time I wanted to watch TV. I did like that we could set the wake-up call on the TV. There is also an iHome device into which you can plug your iPhone and set it up for alarm or to play music in the room.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the biggest minus about this hotel is that is directly on the main pedestrian-tourist walkway of Barcelona, Las Ramblas. Our hotel room completely overlooked the street, and street noise was a deep concern well into the morning. I was able to block out this noise with earplugs. 

The music in the elevators, as another reviewer had mentioned, was a bit confusing. In Le Meridien's desire to make the hotel an artspace, a placard in the elevator explained that a 24-hour soundscape had been composed to provide ""unexpected moments."" I would have been fine with no music at all. When my husband and I first arrived at the hotel late one Saturday night, we thought it was music being pumped in from the bar/restaurant.

Finally, one would expect that a first-class hotel like this would have had better computers in the business center. The machines were slow and crashed often, and used outdated versions of web browsers. I did appreciate the plentiful handi-wipes in the business center to use after working on the computers. 

All in all, it was a blessing to have been able to stay at such a prestigious hotel with delightfully comfortable beds at no cost, but I will argue that one who needs quiet at night might be better off at a lower-cost hotel not so close to Las Ramblas.",4,2011,11,10
37,LE MERIDIEN BARCELONA,“ I found Ms. Inga at the reception desk to have been outstanding in making guests feel welcome and addressing their concern in a seamless manner. The service in the hotel was great and my room was very comfortable and pleasant. The music in elevators was not pleasant at the times though.”,4,2011,11,09
37,Hotel Steps are dangerous,"My first hour in this lovely hotel, I fell on the black granite steps leading to the downstairs and internet.  The steps are not lit well in some places and it was difficult to see the difference between the steps and landing. The steps need a strip on the edge to insure people can see where they end and the next step begins. I heard someone else in the hotel mention they had tripped on the stairs as well.  I incurred over 10,000 in emergency bills for a fractured ankle.  Plus I incurred an addition $700+ for two nights in the hotel after spending two nights in the hospital. Please be careful.

I was disappointed the hotel did not offer to pick up the total cost of my two nights stay after hospitalization before I could go home. I thought that would be the least they could do.  However,
I should mention the staff was very nice to me and went out of their way to befriend me as I was alone on the trip.",3,2011,11,09

Extremely convenient for seeing a lot of the sights and close to a couple of subway stops.   We were upgraded to a suite which was great, but overall we found the staff a little less than interested in being helpful. Nothing major, just little stuff that added up over three days.  If you are debating between the LeMerdien and the W, unless you are interested in the beach, the LeMeridien is definitely the choice.",4,2011,11,07

37,Wonderful location!,"I stayed at this property twice within a week as a friend and I traveled Spain.  Both times we checked in we were greeted promptly and were quickly assigned a room.  Each time we were upgraded to suites on high floors.  The first suite we were upgraded to was very dark as it was a rear facing room.  However, the space was nicely appointed and we received very nice amenities including Hermes cologne and soap!  The second suite we received was on the top floor and had a stunning view of the Ramblas and the rooftops of Barcelona.  

The location of this hotel gives Le Meridien the edge over other properties.  This hotel is in the middle of everything!  We very easily accessed the waterfront and beaches by foot and Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia and other must sees by tour bus.  There is also an amazing tapas bar across the street called Bar Lobo.  Go!  It's delicious.",5,2011,10,28
37,What a total disappointment,"4 nights of horrible sleep in a dugout mushy,mattress
Small room, smaller window (what was that brown mystery splatter on the wall outside my window?)
Crappy, free, frustrating wifi only available in the lobby for 30 minutes. Very expensive to buy. We went to Starbucks or McDonalds and had better luck.
TV shorted out in the middle of a purchased movie (will have to see Harry Potter's last movie again, but the hotel did credit us. Was it the dripping water behind the wall?
Computers in business center were slow as molasses.
Good shower, good location, eh, so many other places we could have stayed.
We have done whole vacations using Starwood hotels and this hotel was our first truly disappointing experience.",2,2011,10,27
37,excellent location on Las Ramblas,"We stayed 2 nights at the Le Meridien in Barcelona in Oct. Placa Catalunya is the best location for tourist. There is a tourist office; a Metro stop; the Aeroport (airport bus) stops here; 2 Hop on Hop Off Buses stop here as well as a huge Cort Ingles Dept Store It is the beginning of Las Ramblas and Passeig De Gracia streets 2 of the best walks in Barcelona. The Le Meridien  is a really nice hotel located 2-3 short blocks from Catalunya on Las Ramblas. The staff was excellent, the rooms very nice, with clean comfortable beds and all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The bathroom was large compared by European standards and included robes and a washcloth which is not standard in Europe.
We used Starwood points so were on the SPG floor. Every day there was water and apples placed on a cart for members.  a very nice ammenity for tourist.  I have stayed at several hotels in Barcelona. Hilton Diagonal Mar; Tryp Appollo; Novotel Barcelona City; Gran Ducat & NH Rallye and Le Meridien was by far the best hotel I have found. The location couldn't have been better. I will stay here again.
suggestions: use aeroport bus (5.40 euros one way) in from airport- stops @ Catalunya
There is a Carefor store 2 doors up and La Bouqueria Market 2-3 blocks away which is a great place to eat breakfast especially if you want fruit.  There is also a really nice cafe 3 door up called Cafe Vienna (known for it's ham sandwiches).",5,2011,10,23
37,"Nice, modern hotel in Great Location","We are wrapping up one week of vacation in Barcelona.  Our flight arrived from US @ 7 am on Sunday.  Our room wasn't available until 3.  All the stores were closed on Sunday, and we were tired.  The staff was very friendly and nice, but there were no rooms open.  We went on a tour of the city on the tour bus to pass the time.

The gym is fine.  We worked out every day and we were the only people in the gym.  The room is big enough, and we have a view of La Rambla, which has proven entertaining! There is some street noise, but nothing bothersome.  Much less noisy than New York.

There is a nice espresso bar in the lobby.  The breakfast buffet is very good - although expensive.  
We have been treated very nicely!  It was my birthday and the hotel put a bottle of champagne and a birthday card in our room while we were out!  
This hotel is centrally located.  Close to the Metro, bus station across the street, and walking distance to five or six museums.  Shopping is everywhere around us.",4,2011,10,21
37,"Great Hotel, Central Location","We have stayed at this hotel on several trips to Barcelona and have always been happy with both the location and the room.  The staff is very attentive and helpful and generally speaks english very well.  The location on La Rambla puts you in the heart of the tourist district and makes a great starting point for any trip around the city.  The hotel is a bit pricey, especially for breakfast, but not excessively so considering the location.  For a better deal hit the restaurants in the sidestreet just across the street and to the right when exiting the hotel.

If you're looking for a quiet hideaway, this is definitely not the place for you - it is packed with tourists, tour groups, and flight crews.  If you're staying for more than a night or two, book one of the Mediterranean Suites.  The spacious patio is well worth the extra cost.  Like many European hotels, I usually find the A/C a bit weak compared to US standards, so close the curtains when you leave to prevent the room getting too warm while you are away.",4,2011,10,20
37,A vantage point with great service,"Just came back from Barcelona. We stayed there in October from the 7th through the 9th and again from the 12th through the16th. The hotel's location couldn't be any better. It was right on La Rambla from where everything was accessible by foot. Bus stops, metro, the Port of Barcelona, shopping venues all were nearby. The service was great and the concierge was very helpful. We left for Granada a day after checking in and most of our luggage stayed behind with them for free until we returned to check back in. They did their best to provide us with rooms earlier than the actual check in time. The hotel crew was very friendly to our son and was very courteous. 

We would love to stay there again.",4,2011,10,18

This location is no where near what I have grown accustomed to expect from this chain.  While the location is quite exellent, on Las Ramblas and a short walk to everything.  There is not much positive I can say about the hotel.  I am an SPG gold member and was ""upgraded"" on check-in, the room was modern but quite tired.  The biggest issue is the sound, the rooms is very, very noisy, from the crowds outside to the scooters passing by to the house staff banging away it is simply not possible to enjoy this hotel or to sleep.  At this price the Hotel Arts or the new W are a better bet.",2,2011,10,18

37,the devils in the details,"front desk understaffed and unhelpful, paid premium for early check in (noon) not available, starwood preferred not recognised here,(not sure its really a Starwood Hotel) very nice location, comfortable well equipped room,amenities in room very good, beautifully located. If the management were more on top of things the hotel would be excellent, as it is the Hotel directly across the street is better (confirmed by trip advisor reviews) I only review things when my expectations are exceeded or not met, too bad in this case a close miss",4,2011,10,15
37,Loved this hotel!,"Stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for one night, post cruise.  We arrived for check in early in the morning and knew that the hotel was full, therefore we expected to have to wait to get into our room.  Check in staff was amazingly efficient and cheerful.  We were able to leave our bags and go out to explore Las Ramblas after enjoying a complimentary coffee/cappuccino and by the time we got back our room was ready!

Our room was spotless and it was quite quiet once we closed the windows.  I had forgotten my European plug and was able to borrow one.  Hubby had injured his knee prior to leaving for vacation and the hotel staff graciously loaned him an ice pack. The three things that we loved about Le Meridien BCN were the location [walking distance to everything], the free wi-fi and the amazing breakfast!

Would I stay at another Meridien?  In a heartbeat!",5,2011,10,13
37,"Nice Location , Friendly Service","Stayed for 3 nights last week in Le Meridien, Barcelona attending a series of business meetings. Very compact hotel, centrally located with access to all parts of Barcelona through Metro and Taxi.

The staff are friendly and strive to help almost all the time. Unobtrusive, but efficient service.Will recommend for business travelers.Breakfast spread can be a little more variety, but overall a good place to stay for business.",4,2011,10,10
37,Front Desk Needs Help,"Overall our stay at Le Meridien Barcelona was very stressful, and this was only due to the front desk staff. We found them very unaccommodating. 

It's always nice after exhausting travel when, although it IS before check-in time, the hotel accommodates you. Can't really fault them for not letting us check in early as it IS their policy, but it's still always nice when hotels go above and beyond and let you. No big deal. But...

The biggest issue we had was with the staff at the front desk. It was very important that we were able to call home during our trip.  I did my research and spoke to the hotel prior to our arrival. They had said that if we got a calling card in Spain that started with ""900"" {their toll-free number}, I would STILL be charged a one time connection fee per call from the hotel, but not per minute. Great, this is exactly what I wanted. 

I used the phone in the room a couple of times, but wasn't able to make a connection. Since it said the fee was per connection I went to the front desk and asked if I was still going to be charged for the call since I didn't make a connection {which I was}.....So this was my BIG issue with Le Meridien Barcelona.... I was just asking about being charged when no connection was made. All of a sudden, they said I'm being charged per minute, in addition to per connection. What?!

I confirmed all this per connection/per minute business ahead of time, and now the people at the front desk are telling me to go outside and use a public phone. They said it would be less expensive. I told them that I didn't mind the one time connection fee per call. I don't care. I'd rather not use a public phone and I'd much rather pay the connection fee and use the phone in the comfort of my own room. Now they're telling me that when I call from the room, not only am I paying the connection fee, BUT ALSO per minute {which was an insane number}, even for a 900 number.

I said that's not true because that's not what it says on the card IN THE ROOM. It also doesn't say that in writing that I got from the hotel before I checked in. I showed both to them.

They continued to insist I was wrong. They were SO RUDE about it!!! They flat out told me all the other information the hotel had given me was wrong and they are the only right ones. I just couldn't believe this contradiction of information, especially since we went through so much trouble on confirming this ahead of time.

We already used the in room phone a couple of times and didn't want to rack up the bill even more, so each night we headed out of the hotel, with towels in hand, to a gross public phone, in which we wiped down prior to using.

I'll just fast forward to the end. It turned out that these rude people at the front desk were completely wrong, and it was indeed only the connection fee I was being charged, not per minute.

It was frustrating because I wasn't even asking about that and they came out of nowhere with information I thought I already had. I find it even more frustrating when people working for the same company are on different pages with this kind of thing, especially in hotels, which makes it so much more stressful for guests.

Aside from the rude staff at the front desk, the room was great. Nice size, and we really enjoyed the shower - the rain head was great. The hotel was in a great location, just needs some new employees.",3,2011,10,10
37,Right in the Centre,"Located right on Las Ramblas this hotel has an excellent location if one wants to be in the centre of where all the busy, lively action is.  It is an older hotel that has been nicely modernized.  Calling it five star is streching it somewhat, but all in all it was a very nice experience.  The old town is close by as are many good shops and restaurants.  Try Bar Lobo almost opposite.  We went there twice to enjoy the casual but smart surroundings, the excellent service and the really great tapas.",4,2011,10,08
37,Fantastic hotel and great customer service,"stayed here for one night after med cruise  in June, we used starwood points.  Only downside was check in which was 30mins+ but that was mainly down to a lot of the cruise also choosing this hotel.  everything else was spot on,  our room was amazing clean, large comfy bed, flat screen, massive walk in shower, robes, safe felt like 5 star plus.  The staff all went the extra mile we were only here for 2 days and they helped us get best trips (they were not selling these it was genuine help),  travellers cheques cashed with no charge,  ate in hotel restaurant pretty good and again great service. Hotel decor all clean, fresh and new. Location was right in heart of city and near most of the sights.   I would highly recomend this hotel the really seem to care about customer service and i would love to go back",5,2011,10,07
37,"Horrible service, particularly from front of house","Hotel is fine in terms of amenities, located in the busy ramblas (don't get the ramblas facing room) - it is over-priced and you won't get a wink of sleep from the noise of the trashy crowd on the street ......

Front of house really bad - double charge you, don't give you adequate information etc etc.,

Overall a forgetable stay.",1,2011,10,07
37,Right in the middle of the action,"Wonderful hotel - right on rambla, easily walkable to many sites and attractions. Easy to get to from the airport - rake the areobus to plaza cataluyna and you are about 3 blocks from the hotel. Staff was nice, rooms were modern, and there is free wifi in the lobby",5,2011,10,05
37,Best in Barcelona!,"We had 2 delightful stays at your hotel primarily because of the friendly, helpful, and caring support staff who took such GREAT care of us with a very praise-worthy staff. Muchas gracias for your staff and the great hotel. We hope to return in the future, and we wish you and your hotel much continued success. We will tell all our traveling friends about this great hotel as we feel it is the Best in Barcelona.”",5,2011,10,04
37,Excellent location. Efficient and courteous staff except of a female concierge.,"LOCATION: The twenty minute taxi ride from Barcelona International Airport, El Prat, cost around 30 EUR, plus 1 EUR per luggage. Entrance on the Carrer de Pintor Fortuny Street just off the busy Las Ramblas. Less than three minute walk to the excellent Teresa Carles restaurant on the Jovellanos street and a fifteen minute walk to the good Cheese Me restaurant on Pl. Jacint Reventos. 
HOTEL: Very busy hotel. The lounge was too small for the hotel this size and it was difficult to navigate during check-in and check-out. Friendly front desk staff provided courteous check-in and check-out. Early check-in not possible although Starwood Platinum Preferred Guests. Efficient bell boys. A terrible female concierge ignored two group of guests waiting for her assistance while taking a long personal call in Spanish and foolishly believing non of her guests understood her native tongue. No apology given even though after asking her to end her private phone conversation. Free, limited wi-fi access at the lounge area, very handy while waiting for the room to be ready. Lifts with loud, noisy, “sound art installation”. A nice, albeit dusty room, especially on the bedroom ceiling lights which clearly have not been clean for a while. Very good noise isolation. Comfortable beds and pillows. Functional size bathroom with excellent shower. Le PopBar provided fast service and served good drinks.
CONCLUSION: Excellent location. NIce size and quiet room. Generally courteous and efficient staff, tainted by one of the rudest female concierge I have ever experienced bringing down the overall rating.",2,2011,10,03
37,"Excellent location, beds & service","Stayed at the Meridien Barcelona in August at the end of a cruise. We booked with SPG points but still got a lovely room on the side off the Ramblas so noise was no problem. The room was a decent size and the bath fantastic, though I admit the layout was a bit quirky. The weather was beautiful when we were there and we wanted to fully open the windows rather than use the A/C. That turned out to be quite involved and required signing a waiver and having an engineer come to open the window beyond the 6"" point. Nonetheless they were happy to accommodate our wishes. Thought the hotel restaurant was pricey but there are superb alternatives all around, including Bar Lobo directly across the street from the main entrance. The front desk staff were helpful and called my cell phone promptly when our room was ready - around noon. The concierge staff were great and had excellent advice for our stay.",4,2011,09,29
37,Nice hotel at a great location,"After various visits to Barcelona this was my first stay at the Le Meridien right that Ramblas. Clearly the hotel has been renovated recently. The rooms are modern and clean, but most are somewhat dark and do not have a good view. The hotel staff is friendly and attentive. All attractions are close by. I will certainly come back to this hotel.",4,2011,09,28
37,LE MERIDIEN BARCELONA,"We are at last back home and now we can finally thank you very much for the lovely room that you kindly gave us when we stayed at your hotel mid July this year

We throughly enjoyed our stay, your staff were excellent and we enjoyed our meals in your dining room and we were very pleased that Hervey Thompson was able to recommend this very well situated hotel in Barcelona.",5,2011,09,28
37,Family holiday - amazing location,"Two adults, 13 yr old and 10 yr old girls.  The location is amazing.  Right on La Ramblas Street with everything close by.  We arrived by car from Montpellier, which is a story in itself.  They parked our car when we arrived. We had directly
 booked our oom with this hotel so when we went to our initial room it was not what we thought it woud be. A large king room with a terrace that would suit a family with smaller children. We were given, at no extra cost, the penthouse on the 9th floor.  Was not the full penthouse, but had a king bed and the girls had their own area. The front of house staff where very obliging with our mistake.  The room was breathtaking.  We chose to go to the local fruit and veg and ,meat market to get dinner and have it in our room.  Either rooms had great options, our room better with older children.  The breakfast was good with  great variety.  I could not fault the hotel or the staff.  Good start to our holiday.",5,2011,09,26
37,Disappointing stay @ Le Meridien Barcelona,"Second stay @ this property which is located just off La Rambla in Barcelona. It is definitely located in a prime area of Barcelona ... lots of shops , restaurants and in the midst of all the action. 

We were simply not impressed with the level of service. On arrival, we were told that the rooms (junior suites) would not be available til after 3pm, but it after 4pm when finally got it. Our """"junior suite"" was strangely configured and  had ony one small window and a view of another building!!!.. Unfortunately, the building was so close  there was little light coming through at all.  Others in our party had different configurations but similar non-views.  It was truly a great disappointment!  We had booked the junior suite with the expectation it would be more luxurious than regular rooms. 

Next morning, we expressed our unhappiness with the front desk only to be told there was nothing they could do, leaving us no option other than to stay where we were and simply endure. We left feeling unhappy and disillusioned to say the least! Not sure anyone really cared, either.",3,2011,09,24
37,Very nice hotel,"Location: The location of the hotel is very good for first time visit to Barcelona.  As everyone has noted, it's right on La Rambla.  Convenient to drop back to the hotel to rest or escape the heat.  It's really close to the Catalunya metro station so from there you can go to most tourist sights.  But do realize that La Rambla is really packed with people.  If you don't like to walk through crowds then this hotel might not be the best for you.

Service: Check-in was professional and friendly.  All the ladies working at the reception spoke English well and were pleasant.  However, it was a little bit annoying that instead of telling us that we cannot check in until 3PM (we arrived at around noon), they say it will be just a moment (the room is being cleaned), then we waited, and then when I check again they said maybe in another 1 hour, and then when we come back from lunch, they say it's another 1 hour wait, which ultimately takes it to 2:30pm.  I read another review with the exact same experience, so maybe this is part of the training?  If so, it's a bad policy.  I would much preferred to walk around and have a leisure lunch.  Asides from that annoyance, the services were good.

Food: We did not eat in the hotel.  It's about a 3 minutes walk to the Boqueria and there are a lot of nice restaurants within walking distance.  If we had more time, we might have tried their onsite restaurant (it looks nice).

Gym/Pool: There is a gym, but we did not use.  There is no pool, which would have been great given the heat.

Room: The junior suite room was very nice.  It was well designed and appears very spacious.  I believe the room we had was the modern design, not the classic.  It has great view into the street/courtyard.  However, the noise will continue to around 2:30AM, so if you want to sleep early/get up late, make sure you specifically ask for rooms with minimal outside noise.",4,2011,09,20
37,Barcelona Bonus,"Le Meridien Hotel in Barcelona Spain is a delight! The location is perfect - on a quiet side street just off the bustling ""Rambla"" - Our room was quiet (facing side street) with a small balcony brushing the tree tops. Sheraton has the most  comfortable beds. The room was beautifully kept, large and an oasis after a busy day. The hotel restaurant ""CentOnze"" is superb and the included breakfast wonderful. We had lunch and dinner there as well and were impressed with the culinary standards. When I lauded the orange sponge cake to the head waiter he promised to get the recipe for me - it was left at our door the next day! Special thanks  to the receptionist and concierge who were most helpful in making suggestions and helping with Wifi issues (free in the lobby). The hotel's proximity to the Metro and shuttle buses to the airport was a  plus. A great hotel in an interesting and stimulating city",5,2011,09,20
37,"Pricey, busy location if you want that.","Have stayed there on several occasions for business. it is certainly expensive and I am not sure I would pay those rates if it was my own money. The location is right on Las Ramblas - right in the heart of it. Can be very noisy at night  if you have a room facing Las Ramblas and I always request a room not facing it. Staff is friendly and does whatever they can to be of help. Restaurant is a dissapointment for me and I never eat there anymore. I even run across the street for breakfast or there is a Starbucks a block or two down on Las Ramblas. Rooms are fine if you like that quirky decor. Bed is not the standard of a Westin, Ritz or Four Seasons. Seems like there are frequently tours staying there which is an annoyance. Not my strongest recommendation. If I was looking for a hotel for vacation in Barcelona, I think I would research other places. Probably can do better for the price",3,2011,09,20
37,Perfect location and excellent service!,Stayed here three nights on spg platinum points. We received a great upgraded suite overlooking las rambla. We reAlly like this hotel and would reccomend to anyone coming to this awesome city!,5,2011,09,19
37,Fantastic Location,"I booked a 5 night stay using my Starwood points and as a Platinum member, I emailed the manager Gonzalo Duarte Silva, prior to arrive to request a upgraded room. Although I didn't get a suite, I got room 542, a large room with a beautiful terrace and off the Ramblas ( I was assured that the hotel has dual pane windows and noise is not an issue even the rooms facing the Ramblas). Walter Rijers is the Front Desk Manager, who I was corresponding with and met upon arrival. Noise was a not an issue.

The hotel is in an awesome location, just 2 blocks from the heart of the city Placa de Catalunya.  From the airport, take the blue Aerobus to the Placa de Cataluna (5.30 euro). At the Placa, you can get any where in the city via the metro and this is where the ""hop on/off buses"" are. 

Tip from the concierge, you can take the metro (1.45 euro) down the Ramblas and you get free ride on the Funicular Montjuic, to access the not to be missed Fundacio Joan Miro and Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. Nearby, I also enjoyed the CaixaForum, Poble Espanyol, Pavello Mies Van Der Rohe. 

I requested that the mini bar refrigerator be emptied, so I could store drinks and snacks. The large grocery store, Carrefour, is almost next door and has everything you would need. Don't miss the large open air food market, ""La Boqueria"" just down the street to see the colorful fruit, vegetables, fruit drinks, tapas, seafood, meat. 

Across the street, is Bar Lobo at Pintor Fortuny, has outdoor seating and the surrounding area towards the Museu d'Art Contemporani has lots of cool shops and places to eat. The Le Meridien Unlock Art program gives you free admission to this museum, it's closed on Tuesday. 

The room has a hot pot for boiling water and packs of instant coffee. Next door is a Starbucks and in the lobby, Latitude Bar 41/23 has coffee drinks and pastries in the morning. You'll get coupon for 2 free espresso or cappuccino. Free bottled water and apples at the elevators in the morning. The hotel provided a special treat,  2 bottles of water and bucket of ice on a tray, sent to my room.

The hotel has in room Wifi for a fee (expensive) and Platinum members free, but it was a hassle for me to log on with my iPhone and Franco was helping me. This turned out to be the biggest issue that I had at the hotel.  I think the Wifi is free in the lobby and there are 3 free computers in the lower level, which was a very nice amenity. 

The room was very nice and spacious with comfortable King bed (nice linens), 42"" flat panel TV with limited english channels, desk, lounge chair and small glass table. In room safe, robe, slippers, iron board and luggage shelf. Bathroom with tub/shower combo, rain head, TV.

There was no Club Lounge or Club Floor. They did offer me a discount on the breakfast, normally 25 euros, for 17 euro per day ( you have to sign up for everyday to get the discount). You can also get room service Continental Breakfast for 16 euro.

Overall, everyone was very friendly and helpful and you can't beat the hotel's location.  It's too bad the hotel does not have Club Lounge which for Platinum members typically will get free breakfast, drinks and evening hor d'oeuvres. Most of the time, I will get upgraded to a suite and didn't here. For these reasons, I am not giving an Excellent Rating.  

Tip- at the Catedral de Barcelona, in the bookstore, I got a fabulous book ""Barcelona, the City, Map by Map"" by Barcelona Turisme for 9.9 euro. Also can get it outside the Catedral at Happy Books. 

Highly recommend the hop on/off bus 23 euro one day and 30 euro two day. Note: most of the shops are closed on Sunday and some of the museums closed on Monday.",4,2011,09,19
37,Great hotel on Las Ramblas,Amazing hotel on Las Ramblas.  Some of the rooms are very modern and some are more classic.  We had two different suites in February; both were great. The Mediterranean Suite is amazing because of the Terrace.  The Prestige suite is more modern and has a round living room full of windows on Las Ramblas in place of a balcony. The hotel bar is great with friendly service and a broad selection of cocktails and spirits.  We made use of the complimentary Illy coffee vouchers we received at check-in at the cafe in the lobby.,5,2011,09,18
37,"Lovely staff, great location, and five star luxury","Stayed at the Le Meridien for 4 days to celebrate my wife's birthday, and our first wedding anniversary. From the start. the staff were lovely, checked us in early. The rooms were clean, with large bathrooms. 
The  hotel had a sun terrace where we spent couple of hours every evening, great views of the streets around you. 
A special touch was complimentary cake, and cava which was left in our room, for my wife's birthday.
Overall, a very pleasant stay, in a great city.",5,2011,09,16
37,a step away from Las Ramblas,One expects a high quality of room/food/service in this chain of hotels and the Barcelona Meridien does not disappoint.  Wonderfully appointed room and excellent staff.  We had our wedding anniversary dinner at their restaurant.  Happy to recommend this establishment.,5,2011,09,14
37,Excellent stay in Barcelona,"Stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona due to its location and being part of Starwood Hotels.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful (including concierges: Ricardo and Lorena, and assistant general manager, Walter). The hotel had a lovely tradition of saying goodbye to each day at 8 PM in the lobby with a glass of Cava for all of their guests.  Other special touches included being invited to a wonderful Friday Paella lunch and cooking demonstration at their CentOnze restaurant.
The hotel rooms are well appointed and we enjoyed an extended stay.  The only problem which prevents me from giving the hotel an ""excellent"" rating is their horrendous internet service.  After speaking to management, I learned that the hotel will be changing their internet service provider in due course.  However, given that the problem angers dozens guests daily (it is a constant topic of conversation among people in the lobby).  It is simply not feasible to do any serious business functions while staying there.  Again, hotel and staff are great (!), internet leaves a lot to be desired.",4,2011,09,12
37,Great hotel on Las Rambles,"We stayed at 2 hotel during this trip, pre and post a mediterranean cruise. This was my favorite. Close to everything, exceptionally large hotel rooms and immaculate. One of the nicest I have been in ever in Europe.Love the pastry shop around the corner. Could not beat the quality and the prices.",5,2011,09,12
37,"great hotel, location and overall services","The location is great, close to the rambla but without the feeling of the rambla rush. The staff id friendly and with a very professional service level. The room was great. The breakfast, superb.
It was a perfect three night stay.",4,2011,09,12
37,Perfect Location,"Perfect location right on the La Ramblas the famous Barcelona tourist walk street, within walking distance from Catalonia metro station which makes it easy to reach other areas of Barcelona

My room did not have the Ramblas view so I did not enjoy any view but the bedroom and toilet were good enough

Staff was very friendly and speak good English, I will return when visiting Barcelona again and hopefully this time I will get a better room with a view",4,2011,09,12
37,Best possible location,"Great location, friendly staff. had an overall wonderful stay. One surprising bug for an expensive hotel -you can hear the water flush of the room next to you woke us up in the morning.",5,2011,09,08
37,"Upscale Hotel, Fun Location","We booked 2 rooms at this hotel for 1 night pre cruise.  We redeemed starwood points for the 2 rooms, I am not certain that we would have booked here if we were paying the very high room rates.

We were travelling with teenagers so booked 1 room with a King and 1 room with 2 singles.  We were very pleased at check in when the agent told us that they had put us in 2 connecting rooms.  We had not requested this so it was above and beyond for them to think of this and offer us this convenience.

The rooms are really nice, appear to have been updated recently.  Bedding is comfortable, bathrooms are stunning with TV.  One room had a shower and the other a bathtub.  The rooms are really small, but this seems common for Europe.  We were not able to stay on the Starwood Preffered Guest floor but were told we could get water bottles, apples and magazines off of a cart on that floor.  Unfortunately, the cart seemed to be empty most of the time and after a couple of phone calls about this to the front desk we had 2 water bottles delivered to our room.  The only maintenance issue in the room was a slow draining shower, seemed to be plugged.  As we did not discover this until the morning we were departing we did not phone about the problem, but did include this on our comment card.

The location is as mentioned by other reviewers.  It is just off Ramblas and a central drive from the airport and to the cruiseport.  We walked up and down Ramblas and surrounding areas.  This area is crazy, must be seen for sure, but I probably could not handle being around so many people for too many days.

The hotel has a complimentary business center downstairs with 4 computers.  However, the internet was not working during our stay, I attempted several times.  This was mentioned to the front desk by myself and others, but apparently nothing could be done.  This did not seem like a big priority for the hotel to fix, in my opinion.

I liked this hotel and would stay here again if I was able to get a special room rate or use points again, but I could never justify paying the full price.  I would also recommend the hotel to friends and family if budget permitted.  The location of the hotel and the ambiance of the hotel can not be beat.",4,2011,08,30
37,Excellent staff,"“ There were a total of 10 family members staying at the hotel. 4 of which were 6 and under. When we departed, your bellman and security stayed with us to ensure our safety as we waited for our driver to pick us up on the corner of the hotel. With your hotel bellman and security, we felt safe in what could have been an unsafe situation. I commend their attention to our safety. Thank you very much!!!”",5,2011,08,29
37,"Impressed with attentive staff, loved Barcelona!","“ I was impressed with how easily the registration clerk (I don't remember his name) remembered my name whenever I had a question.

37,Piece of paridise,"We stayed here for one night after a Med cruise and loved the location and hotel. After walking the streets of Barcelona coming back was heaven. Cool, clean, super amenities and great staff. 

We had 2 rooms, one for us and one for the teenage boys. They loved it- a TV in the bathroom!! Our shower was amazing- I couldn't put my palms flat on either side it was so big. Rainforset shower head that had lots of power too. 

Breakfast was included in our rate. So so. Looks wonderful but didn't really do it for us.",5,2011,08,25
37,True 5 Star Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"The Le Meridien is a real 5 Star Hotel in the middle of Barcelona, right next to the Rambla, the main downtown shopping district and just 5 minutes from the harbor and the medieval city center. It could not be any more convenient location-wise.
The room was luxurious and very quiet. Only drawback: there is no pool, probably because of the historic site. Also to take into consideration: the price! Barcelona is expensive and the Le Meridien is one of the high end hotels. I did not take any meals in the hotel because of the high prices.",4,2011,08,22
37,European Vacation,"I've stayed at Le Meridien in Barcelona twice and have loved it. This time the room had more modern amenities compared to the last time. The rooms are small, but that's to be expected in Europe. Overall, I had an excellent stay.",5,2011,08,22
37,Great hotel in fantastic spot,"After dumping the car and spending a great 13 days travelling in Spain by car we decided to upgrade and stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for 6 nights.  Superb hotel particularly the floor for members.  Top spot just off La Rambla.  Could not have wanted for a better restful stay and to be right in the heart of Barcelona but surprisingly quiet.  Staff, meals everything we wanted. The oversize towels and bathroom where a delight.  Great room space also.  Well worth the extra money.  Barcelona is an exciting city.",5,2011,08,22
37,Spent a great week at Le Meridien,“ Loved the location (right on the Rambles)! Very clean and pretty hotel; large room was nice for three of us--3 beds plus couch/table.  We also made good use of the lounge chairs on the lovely roof terrace (which also presented a great view at night).,5,2011,08,21
37,I will definitely be back someday...,"Everything about the hotel including the location, rooms, and service was top notch.  I was upgraded (for free) to a beautiful suite which included several free bottles of water, a bowl of fruit, and other nice touches like a bottle of cologne. Everyone I interacted with during my stay was friendly and helpful. When I checked out and there was an incorrect charge from the coffee bar/lounge, it was taken off without any questions asked. I have no complaints and can't wait to go back!",5,2011,08,21
37,"Fantastic location, very nice hotel, average restaurant!","Spent 2 nights in this hotel situated on the Ramblas and found the experience very enjoyable. Had a very nice junior suite room with a beautiful rooftop balcony. Although located on the extremely busy Rablas, the room was whisper silent. Service was excellent. The breakfast buffet was pricey and average, and the restaurant which we ate at the first evening was just OK.",4,2011,08,19
37,EXCELLENT LOCATION CLEAN ROOM,We spend two nights before the cruise. It was our first visit to Barcelona.  The lady that served the coffee at the lobby was very nice to us.  They gave us an adjoining room for the kids.  We had a wonderful time.  Too short to see all the attractions in the city.  We are definitely going back.,5,2011,08,18
37,Great location  but....,"The location and the ambience are great selling features of this hotel. There is Concierge at this location who was absolutely fantastic, recommending great restaurants and things to do every day. (Always made us feel special) (That being said, I forget her name but young Blonde Spanish women who was actually in the Navy)

   I booked a King size bed for a couples vacation some time ago. The room they put us in had 2 single beds and so I considered this an honest mistake. When I called down to see how quickly they can accomodate the change in rooms, the gentlemen at the front desk claimed that I had booked 2 beds and that this was my mistake. I quickly got out my confirmation sheet which in fact claimed.....a booking for a King Size bed. I went downstairs to show them the very same sheet at which point the young lady admitted that I was not told the truth and that my reservation was for a King bed and that she apologizes for them not telling me the truth. NOT nice play.....

  We enjoyed our vacation and the hotel but had to overlook that we were lied to on the very first day of our location. You can appreciate that it might taint any further conversations..",3,2011,08,17
37,Fantastic Location,"We chose the Meridien for its location and were not disappointed!  We got a bus from the airport and walked down the Ramblas to the hotel.   Check in was efficient and friendly and we were delighted with our room overlooked the Ramblas - certainly worth paying the extra for; we whiled away several happy hours watching street entertainers and generally people watching.  The crowds stayed out until the early hours but with the windows shut we heard nothing and slept extremely well.  We had visited Barcelona before but enjoyed the hop on hop off buses which we used to get to Parc Guell for the first time and really enjoyed the architecture and ambience.  We were very lucky with the weather and alongside a visit to family members living nearby we walked miles and miles up and down the Ramblas, around the port area and further afield.
Our room was clean and had all the expected facilities including tea and coffee making facilities.  The bathroom with 'rainforest shower' was a particularly positive feature!  The breakfasts were very good with the usual range of foods and a few Catalan specialities too.  We had dinner in the hotel one night which was very nice and the service good; a mistake in the order was compensated by a round of free drinks and a full apology!
the public areas of the hotel were bustling and the staff polite and friendly without being intrusive.
The roof terrace is worth hunting out and provides great views over the city. As a city centre hotel we were impressed by the Meridien and would certainly stay there again.
I realised after we got home that I had left some jewellery in the room and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful in ensuring its eventual safe return despite a number of difficulties, this reinforced our very positive opinion of both them and the Meridien in general.",5,2011,08,16
37,Definitely not a 5 star hotel,"This hotel needs a complete make-over in order to restore it to its 5 star status. If you are planning on staying here, ensure you ask for a room on a higher level as the street remains very noisy throughout the night. The staff were friendly enough but the room was very basic, the TV could barely be watched through the static and the shower did not work properly. Internet was also very expensive and should have been included for the price paid.",2,2011,08,16
37,"Good location, a little overpriced","We stayed here the night before leaving on a cruise. There were 2 adults and 2 children and were able to get adjoining rooms. From the hotel we could walk to many sidewalk cafes and the Gothic part of town for sightseeing. The hotel is located right on the Rambles an area with many street artists, shopping and other entertainment. That evening we had a drink in the hotel bar but were the only people there and we kind of felt like we were putting them out by serving us.  Overall, our experience was pleasant and this was perfect for a quick, overnight stay.",4,2011,08,14
37,Comfort and location excellent,"This hotel is right on Las Ramblas.  Easy to walk all around Barcelona from here.  Comfortable restaurant and bar with picture windows facing Las Ramblas where you can watch all the people.  Bedding, shower and room were all 5 star quality.  Coffee bar very  busy and service there in the morning really frustrating as customers come at the service worker from all sides with typical indifference to others.  Starbucks located close by where service, quality etc are very good.  Barcelona is one of the best cities to visit as a tourist.  Easy to get around, lots of interesting museums, great beaches at the bottom of Las Ramblas, lots of restaurants at all price points, modern architecture such as La Sagrada Familia, etc.",4,2011,08,12
37,Fantastic location--,Spent three nights at Le Meridien after our cruise. The hotel is right in the heart of the Ramblas. Our  suite was on the third floor overlooking the Ramblas and it was completely soundproofed The buffet breakfast was very good with a  wide variety of items.  The room was a good size and the bathroom was quite spacious and modern and very clean. The air conditioning worked very well and the staff were helpful and friendly. Free internet was a nice touch. Enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.,5,2011,08,12
37,"Nice hotel, upscale, but definitely not 5 stars","I am a New Yorker who has travelled for business and pleasure extensively. I require a hotel that is very clean, modern, stylish, safe. I don't want to fear bed bugs, dirtiness or poor service. As a result, I am usually limited to 5 star and very expensive accomodations. I was able to get booked into Le Meridien Barcelona through PriceLine (name your price option) at a great price. 

The hotel is in a TERRIFIC location. It's the center of all the action and so perfect for a first time tourist. The hotel is indeed very clean, modern, stylish and safe... however it is more like 3.5 stars. Certainly not 5 stars on par with a place like, the Hotel Arts Barcelona or the W Barcelona. Also - free internet access is provided in the lobby only. For the room is another 20 Euro. Top hotels include internet access.

I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again - - however, I would only stay or recommend staying at a hugely discounted rate. And that is quite possible... book well in advance or use priceline.",4,2011,08,12
37,Great hospitality,"Excellent rooms, great location. Great hospitality and service minded staff.!",4,2011,08,12
37,The treated us amazingly well!,"We stayed in this hotel for a few days before we flew to Deia on Mallorca for our wedding.  We were upgraded to their very best suite and the service was amazing.  We enjoyed the city, hotel and were treated very well.",5,2011,08,11
37,Excellent location,"Great location in city centre off Las Ramblas. Room smaller than expected, but very clean and quiet. Room had comfortable king sized bed with white cotton duvet, decent lighting, silent and effective air con, large tv with smaller tv in bathroom which all made for a pleasant stay. No view (apart from a brick wall) and no bath in bathroom were minor issues.",4,2011,08,09
37,Great Hotel and Location,"Good hotel - great location and good knowledgeable staff. Bags were taken in when we arrived early and let us explore barcelona for a while until the room was ready (about 2.pm). Room was a twin as staying with a family member. Room was very clean but in areas perhaps looked a bit dated (light sensor near bed was also broken and a few scuffs and scratches on the back wall). Room looked over Las Ramblas which was quiet at night. As with previous reviews - I think that Wifi should be offered for free - this is a 5 star hotel and you expect such things now. So in summary
Liked - the location
           - the restaurant
           - the gym and computer area on floor -1 (which is great way of checking emails etc) and paid for as part of room fee..
           - clean rooms
           - comfortable beds
           - helpful staff
           - quiet air conditioning
           - blue lights that give you a guide to the bathroom when you go at night!
          - TV in the bathroom

Dislikes

           - No free internet in your room
           - Missed the 'sparkle' of a 5 star hotel in areas... hard to put your finger on it but just little things... 
           
A few trips for travellers

- Get yourself a barcelona card from the tourist information centre at the airport when you arrive (or pay for one online first). Lets you on all busses and metros for an unlimited time over 5 days. Metro is easy to use once you get the hang of it as saves loads of time but is hot down there in July / August !
- Hotel is easy to find but make sure you get a landmark to look for so you don't walk the wrong way up or down las rambles - and you can do alot of walking!  
- Starbucks is just next door / supermarket down a few yards
- Watch the street sellers selling the 'whistles' fans and other tourist tack ! and pick pockets esp on the metros and late at night.",4,2011,08,07
37,"Friendly staff, great location","My family stayed here (my wife and I, two small kids 3-5 yo, two grandparents) and had a great time. Being close to La Rambla was very convenient. A supermarket is around the corner which is useful for snacks and toiletries. La Boqueria is also a few blocks away and have wonderful fruits and drinks for kids.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. We kept hearing pickpockets are plenty in Barcelona, but we didn't have a problem. There are a lot of hotels and tourists around Le Meridien and as long as you stay vigilant, there shouldn't be any problems.",5,2011,08,04
37,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Great stay at this beautiful Starwood property.  The location cannot be beat if you want to be in the heart of it all - it is right on La Rambla.  Shopping, restaurants and action is right out the door.  The hotel and rooms are beautifully appointed.  We found the service to be unparalleled.  Concierge Lorena was especially helpful.   We were able to stay here using only Starwood points (16K per night - steep but worth it due to location).  

A fun little restaurant called Bar Lobo is just outside the side door - recommended!",5,2011,07,30
37,A dream vacation,"Although a bit late in reviewing, I had to make special mention of this outstanding hotel. As platinum Starwood members, we were upgraded to a suite without requesting. the service at this hotel was simply outstanding!!!!
The rooms were well appointed to the point of being absolutely luxurious. Location was probably the best feature, with the hotel being located on Las Ramblas. It was a short walk to many of the interesting places that we wanted to visit.
In short, spectacular hotel.",5,2011,07,29
37,Great Hotel/Great Location,"Just got back from Barcelona.  The hotel is right on Las Ramblas so you are in the busiest location in Barcelona, but walking distance from virtually anything.  Be prepared for crowds:  I found it lively, but understand it is not a quiet resort...more like Times Square.  I found the staff (front desk/concierge/cleaning staff) to all be exceptionally helpful.  I though about staying at the W, glad I didn't...it is isolated on the beach by itself.  No negatives.",5,2011,07,26
37,Great location,You can't beat the location of this hotel on La Rambla.  Can walk to a lot and a short taxi ride to most things in Barcelona.  The room we had was small but comfortable.,4,2011,07,26
37,Loved this hotel!!,"This hotel is amazing!! It is located right off of Las Ramblas, and is situated in the best area of Barcelona (for site seeing!).  We were able to check in immediately, and were promptly upgraded from a deluxe room, to a deluxe room with a view of Las Ramblas, which was a nice suprise.  The room itself was amazing - It was decently sized and the bed was like a cloud - so soft, and huge! The bathroom was very luxurious - it was large, included a huge soaking tub, an awesome showerhead, and soft comfy robes and slippers.  

Overall, our experience here was great.  The service was fantastic, and the rooms helped made our trip to Barcelona a great one.  I would absolutely stay here again and would highly highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona looking for a luxurious hotel thats within close proximity to all of the sites.",5,2011,07,19
37,Nice hotel with great location,"The best feature of the hotel is the location - right in the heart of the city. Hotel itself was nice too. We had 2 rooms and they were very different, one traditional and one remodeled. I actually liked them both, but some people may prefer one or the other and it wasn't really explained at the front desk. Other than that staff was very helpful with information about the city and restaurants.",4,2011,07,10
37,Gets Better Every Time & The Staff are Delightful,"This was our third stay at Le Meridien Barcelona and it just appears to get better and better.  The hotel has not changed but the really friendly and helpful natrure of ALL the staff just makes the experience better.

The rooms are good, the restaurant, Cent Onze, awesome for breakfast and the location is simply excellent but it is still the people who make it such a great hotel.",5,2011,07,08
37,"Perfect Location, Lovely Hotel, Would love to stay again!","Our family enjoyed a wonderful visit to Barcelona and would love to return to Le Meridien.  We stayed with points and were given a suite overlooking Las Ramblas, we also received complimentary admission to the MACBA around the corner- a big plus.  This location is perfect, within walking distance to many sites, museums, shopping, people watching, and the pier.  Like many city hotels, we did not find a swimming pool.  The concierge directed us to an authentic Catalonian restaurant which instantly became our favorite place to dine, Las Caracolas- must try the salted cod- excellent!  We would love to visit again!",4,2011,07,08
37,Location can't be beat!,"Pros
1.  Location-  This hotel is literally 2 minutes walking to Las Ramblas and about 5 minutes walk to the Catalunya (Barcelona) metro station.  In about a 10 minute walk, you are at the bus that takes you to and from the Barcelona Airport (IATA: BCN) commonly known as El Prat Airport.  Obviously, being caught in the middle of the action can make your stay noisier especially if you get a room overlooking Las Ramblas.  Our room wasn't overlooking Las Ramblas but the less noisy street between Le Meridien and the hotel across the street called Hotel 1898...so noise from Las Ramblas was much less of an issue for me and my wife.  My wife and I personally like being in the middle of the action because of access to the main sightseeing sites and public transportation.
From this hotel, you are also about a 10 minute walk to the Barri Gotic district and maybe a 12 minute walk to the the La Ribera district.  We can walk to the Picasso Museum in about 15-20 minutes from this hotel as well as the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia...so, again, you are very close to all of the major attractions.
We considered staying at the W Barcelona and after having gone there, we are glad we chose the Le Meridien.  The W Barcelona is a nice hotel, very modern, etc. but it is a ways from all of the action (about a 35-40 minute walk from the Plaça de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) to the W Hotel.
2.  Rooms were clean and spacious enough for the two of us.  Flat screen TVs in the main room and the bathroom.  Water pressure in the shower was excellent.  I agree with some posters on this site that the showers can leak water because water splashes out because the opening to the shower is too wide open.  Also, I agree, that the step out from the shower to the bathroom floor is odd in that the shower floor is higher than the bathroom floor (so be careful when stepping out).
3.  Wifi access in the lobby always worked and was easy to get on.  There is also a free business center on the -1 floor that had 4 workstations.  There is also a printer that is free to use.  If you run out of paper, as had happened to us while we were there, there is a service phone near one of the computer workstations and you simply call upstairs and the printer paper is refilled.
4.  Concierge and room service-  Both, in my opinion, were excellent!  The concierge helped us to decide which excursions made the most sense for our week stay there (reminder-  some excursions don't operate on certain days so plan accordingly).  As far as the room service, the rooms were always cleaned with fresh towels when I got back from a long day sightseeing.  Whenever I called for Room Service, they promptly came within 5 minutes.
5.  Local market and Farmer's Market-  You are within 2 minute walk to a market that contains just about anything you need to buy like soft drinks, baked goods, etc.  The ""farmer's market"" called La Boqueria Market is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel where you can get fresh fruit, nuts, etc.
6.  Restaurants galore within 2-10 minutes walking from the hotel.  All different kinds of foods too!

Cons
1.  If you want it resort like quiet, then you probably should opt for the W Hotel or something NOT ON Las Ramblas.  For those who are going to Barcelona for the first time, Las Ramblas (on any weekday and more so on the weekends) is like being on the busiest street in New York!  There are just tons and tons of people, cars, and buses.
2.  Workout Room-  This is located on the ""-1"" floor and the gym is quite small as has been written by other posters.  There are just two treadmills, one ellipitical machine, a couple of bike machines and then some weight machines and a small area to stretch, etc.  The room also seemed to not have circulating air so it can get a little toasty in the room after running on the treadmill for 30+ minutes.  Outside of the gym being small, it is clean and I believe it was open 24 hours/7 days a week.
3.  No ice machines-  To get a bucket of ice requires you to call room service.  The two times I did this, the bucket of ice and two glasses came within 5 minutes of me making the call.
4.  No pool.  It would've been nice to have a pool.  Hotel 1898 across the street had a pool on the top floor.  The W Hotel also had a pool (although the pool was tiny).

Overall-  To me, the Cons listed above were very minor to an otherwise excellent stay at this hotel.  I would highly recommend this hotel for those people that want to be close to the action and close to public transportation.  We purchased a 10 trip metro pass and accessed the local and farmers market which not only saved us money but made it feel like we experienced Spanish culture/flavour.",5,2011,07,07
37,In the Beating Heart of Barcelona,"This was my second stay at the Le Meridien Barcelona. I used Star Points and was given a king room facing away from La Rambla (which I recommend if you are a light sleeper). The room was very good; quiet, the AC worked, bathroom and shower are modern and excellent, the bed was comfortable...my wife and I were quite happy there. The concierge staff at this hotel is beyond excellent. Tours and restaurants they recommended were all quite nice. I screwed up my car rental for a drive up to France and the concierge had a car delivered within the hour.
I like this place. It's got a cool vibe (but not too cool). It is on LaRambla and in the old city which is all within walking distance.",5,2011,07,07
37,Wonderful Hotel,"We are SPG members and service was outstanding, from room location (quiet room request was honored) to helpfulness of staff (Vera was lovely) , everything was perfect.  The room layout and 5 star bathroom were a treat for Europe.  The gym was clean and had good air conditioning, room service was quick and delicious with large portions.  The restaurant recommendation by Concierge Claudia for tapas at Ciudad (forgot 2nd part of the name)   was so good we went there for dinner 2 our of our 3 nights in Barcelona.   We will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2011,07,07
37,Good hotel with good location and front desk staff - a little pricy,"This is a good hotel with the entrance a few steps down a side street from the Ramblas (which is better than being on the Ramblas).  The front desk staff (particularly Marta who somehow remembers everyone and is always smiling) was helpful and efficient, and actually memorable.  We had a small problem with one of our rooms and they took the initiative to move us to another room.  As a SPG member, they really did make an effort to recognize my ""level"".  The concierges were just okay...tried to be helpful but one was new and the other didn't seem expert enough in the recommendations offered.  Free lobby internet was a nice feature.  Our rooms were pretty expensive for Spain.",4,2011,07,05
37,"Great Location, staff ok.....","The location is second to none if you don't mind being in the middle of the action.  Although the hotel is loud the rooms were spacious and clean. Our room was a suite that overlooked La Rambla which of course added to the noise. I found the concierge staff to be not so helpful and clearly uninterested in our needs, questions or concerns.  I would stay again however would prebook all restaurants and day trips.",4,2011,07,05
37,"Great Hotel, Great location and Great City",“ The front desk people were friendly and personable and were very helpful to us when we needed directions. Very professional. Room was very nice and clean etc. Overall we felt very safe and comfortable. It was a very pleasant stay at a beautiful city. Looking forward to coming back to see much more of Barcelona.”,5,2011,07,05
37,Great hotel - Great location!,"Great location, staff all very helpful and friendly.  Room was very comfortable - great bedding/bed/bathroom and very clean.  Right on La Ramblas, walking distance to the marina, lots of restaurants nearby, staff are very helpful with any questions.",5,2011,07,05
37,Convenient location,"Free computers to use but slow internet speed. Free WiFi in the lobby, plenty of chairs to sit.
Great location on Las Ramblas street, dubbed as the liveliest street in Barcelona.  For American foods, there is Hard Rock Cafe nearby at Placa Catalunya (the north end of Las Ramblas), across the Hop On and Off bus stop. Two El Corte Ingles department stores are also within walking distance. The famous market La Boqueria is also on the same street.
One woman staff at the lobby was exceptionally very helpful and friendly.",5,2011,07,03
37,Overpriced with poor service.  Unable to deliver Starwood standards.,"trip advisor write up

Overpriced at 265 Euros per night ($400 per room), poor service, and huffy staff that seemed overwhelmed and bothered by guests constantly reminding us that hotel was busy!  A better choice is W Barcelona – less expensive, better staff.  W is a cab ride from touristy La Rambla, but so what?  You come back to classier, happier staff and better rooms at the beach at W.

Two days before arrival we emailed Le Meridien hotel reservations and concierge reminding them of our arrival date and special request of two feather free rooms.  At check in we were told the inside view rooms were “better” as they were quieter.  View from room was of back of another building.  See view photo:
 

When we arrived rooms had not been prepped and we had to call house keeping to properly prep rooms by removing feathers.  When we returned after dinner the feather pillows and duvet were removed but there were no pillows!  We called and requested foam pillows but were told there were none available.  

I called and asked for manager on duty. I pointed out that there was a card on the bed that listed amenities to be requested, and these included extra pillows or foam pillows!  

The manager said the pillows had been misplaced but they were looking for some.  About midnight housekeeping showed up with smokey smelling couch cushions in pillow cases.  I am not kidding!  See photo of pillow.
 

We made many attempts to contact concierge throughout this visit for dining and attraction information but alas the phone rang and rang with no pick up.  When we finally got a message to concierge via reception requesting recommendation for dining, they printed us Google map for cab and directed to the other side of town near Montjuic fountains.  We took cab to restaurant concierge recommended and they would not let us in as no one had called to make reservation (we had never been advised this was necessary and assumed as in all other hotels the proper reservation had been made!).  With starving kids we had to hunt for meal and ended up having worst meal of our trip.  Wasted cab fare.

Worse yet, when we advised front desk of these problems nothing was offered, not even apology only “we are very busy”.  Finally at check-out we asked what could be done, and they discounted one meal by 50% (about $100).  Manager Anna was called and aplogized and said she would get back to me by email and 3 weeks later I am still waiting.

At checkout I also observed another family standing next to me at check in desk with children who had been up all night on flight trying to check in.  They were told “the hotel is very busy so your room will not be ready until late this afternoon”.  The desk clerk then proceeded to magically offer them a “better room” with view (guess it wasn’t so full) for 50 euros more per night per room to get family in now.  As family did not bite, clerk then lowered price to extra 25 Euros per room, and exhausted family took this rather than wait 5 hours for room.",2,2011,07,03
37,Enjoyed our stay,"Room, staff and dining was great. The location on Las Ramblas was very convenient.",5,2011,06,30
37,"Great location, I'll come back!","Front desk was excellant, they were able to check us in early and the concierge was helpful and informative. Bellmen were great. The bathroom felt a little see-through, but no more than NCL's cabin bathrooms.",5,2011,06,30
37,"Fantastic location, helpful staff","Le Meridien is in a perfect location, right on the Ramblas and only a 5-minute walk to Placa Catalunya, theatres, restaurants, several subway stations, the cathedral, and the like.  The hotel and service are excellent, but we found the food (breakfast and dinner) to be overpriced and generally mediocre in quality.  The best food was at the capucino bar in the lobby!  With discounted prices, it is a great place to stay overall.",4,2011,06,30
37,We loved Le Meridien!,"The hotel is well-located on La Rambla with very nice rooms and a great restaurant.  One of the things we really appreciated were the perimeter lights which come on in the middle of the night to help you find the bathroom without waking the other person in the room!  Our room was nicely appointed and very comfortable with a very spacious bathroom.   The restaurant was so good that we kept coming back to eat there, rather than going to any one of the millions of great eateries in Barcelona.  We enjoyed our stay immensely and can't wait to go back!",5,2011,06,30
37,Would go back in a heartbeat!,"Our visit started off poorly was we had requested a non-smoking room and they checked us in to a Smoking room. When we informed the front desk they were very nice and said they would move us, but did not have a room available right away, but if we came back in about an hour it would be ready.

Not only was it ready they upgraded us to a suite with private patio for the mistake and delay!

Keep in mind it is close to Ramblas and could be loud (this was a parade going by the night we were there), but that is part of the fun of Barcelona!

My only regret is that we were only booked to stay one night and not more!",5,2011,06,29
37,Good and not so good,"Hotel is in a great location, staff are extremely helpful and friendly. However there is no ramp at the front of the holiday for pushing the stroller up and have to go up 3 steps.
Room could have been cleaner when we checked in the carpet was a wet on one side of the bed and though the sheets were clean they had a few marks on them.
Shower is fantastic ! however sliding glass door to bathroom is a bit wierd.
This hotel is extremely busy with a high turnover of guests and you are unlikely to get into your room early.",4,2011,06,29
37,Skip it if you expect a Starwood upgrade,"If you are Starwood Platinum and expect an upgrade, skip it.   All you will get is a lot of apologies about how sold out they are.   I booked into this hotel a good nine months before arriving for my three night stay.  I was a Platinum Starwood member when I booked.  Upon arrival my wife and I were given a standard 291 square foot room, about the size of a bathroom in a St. Regis, not large enough to swing a cat in.  The hotel claims to be five star but more properly merits three, max.  Showering in a tub with three inches of water around my ankles is not my idea of a five star property.  The hotel is heavily used by Lufthansa airlines crew, which may account for their “being full” and not doing anything to upgrade Platinum Starwood guests.  It is Centrally located on La Ramplas but that is it.  Save your Starwood point for another city, Paris, Florence or Venice, to name a few. In all seriousness, they should advertise that they do not participate in the Starwood program so loyal Starwood guests know what to expect.",2,2011,06,25
37,Big mistake,"I stayed in this hotel for 9 nights in June 2011. Beeing a Platinum Member of Starwood loyalty program, I was expecting high level of service appropriate for SPG 5 category. But I was msitaken.

Room: I got the room on the 4th floor. It was really small and very loud at nights, because it was located right above the hotel entrance. Was it  special uprgade for Platinum SPG?

Food: Restaurant is a way overpriced. I had much better quality of dinner in the neighbourhood restaurants at much more affordable price.

Service: It's the shame. The staff at reception were not able to send my fax for 2 days. The manager on duty just lied saying that the hotel was fully booked and can't offer me an uprgade I was eligable for. Just see reviews of some people for the same time I have stayed in hotel.

All in all, hotel and it's staff are absolutely spoiled by touristy location and absolutely fon't care about customer satisfaction.

I was very happy when I left this hotel after 9 nights staying there and will surely never come back or recommend this hotel to my friends.",2,2011,06,17
37,"Location was fantastic, service was great. Only downside was size of the gym (too small)","Location was fantastic, service was great. Only downside was size of the gym (too small)",5,2011,06,15
37,Do not stay here,"First - the location is nice if you're the type of person who goes to NYC and likes to stay in Times Square - my husband and I are not so that was a miss on my part.  
Second, I am a Starwood Platinum member so maybe I'm biased and used to nicer rooms but this was the WORST Starwood room I have ever stayed in during my six plus years of Starwood travel.    I've attached photos of the ""suite"" we were given.  The room was completely dated and dingy, nothing like the rooms shown on the website: https://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/rooms/index.html?propertyID=1931
For those not aware, as a Platinum member I'm supposed to be upgraded to the best available room upon check-in - look at the pictures and I had to wonder if this was the best room and if so where the pictures on the website were taken?
I called down to the front desk asking if we could be moved to another room and was told there were no other suites available (we checked in at 2:00pm).  I said we were fine waiting and we would just store our luggage at the front desk. 
After being put on hold we were told that actually there were no more suites.  I said that's okay, just please put us in any other room.  I was put on hold again, the front desk person offered to show me another room that had the same decor as the one we were currently in that I may like more.  I said that made no sense.  They said that's what they had and I finally said forget about it.  That was the last thing I heard from the front desk.  
I do want to say, the bright point of the LeMeridien hotel was their concierge Gil who was very helpful to us so if you need something ask him, he was quite helpful.
If you're SPG and going to Barcelona, you're probably better off staying at the W, my husband and I walked down towards it.  It is out of the way but you're near the beach and it looked beautiful.  I regretted not going with my instinct and selecting it when I made my reservations.",2,2011,06,15
37,Dissapointed by room,"The hotel is situated in the best possible position for tourists to Barcelona.
Directly on The Ramblas, in the Barri Gotic district. Probably this is why they have 5 star status. 
The lobby is large and well furnished.
 The bed room was fairly big as well, however the room feels old and tired. It was quite noisy . We were on the 5th floor on the front side of the hotel, opposite several Tapas bars.
The shower is above the bath and one needs extra long legs to climb over the side of the bath.
While the hotel is not bad, I would not say that it was 5 star.",3,2011,06,14
37,Fantastic location,"Situated right on Las Ramblas this hotel must occupy one of the best 'people watching' locations in the world. The room was upgraded to a junior suite which, whilst it didn't have the best view in the world, was extremely comfortable and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom nothing short of luxurious. 
Room service was very good and the restaurant food was excellent, if not a little expensive. Staff were very polite and courteous and made the stay very enjoyable, but checking out proved to be a little slow and long winded.",4,2011,06,13
37,Fine hotel in a great location.,"If we were to visit Barcelona again, we would choose Le Meridien. The accommodations were clean and comfortable--almost luxurious, but also a bit quirky. We weren't accustomed to having a sliding, frosted glass door to the bathroom and automatic lighting when you get up in the middle of the night. But we enjoyed our stay very much. Upon stepping out of the hotel door, you are right there at Las Ramblas. We did not see any downside to this--our room was on the side opposite so if there was any noise, we did not hear it.",4,2011,06,13
37,Perfect for singles,"As usual, fantastic Starwood service...perfect location for sightseeing, running on the beach, and going out at night...rooms were super clean and hotel staff was very helpful.  The beds were ridiculously comfortable.",5,2011,06,12
37,Good location; average rooms,"We were in Spain for a 3 weeks, and stayed in 3 SPG and one non-SPG hotel during this vacation. Unfortunately, the Le Meridien was our least favorite SPG hotel during this trip. First, I'll start with the positives: this hotel has an ideal location, perhaps the best location for a tourist. It's located at the start of the Las Ramblas, and just a few minutes walking from Placa de Catalunya, which is known as the main plaza of Barcelona. Placa de Catalunya is extremely convenient as it has many subway lines, and the Airport bus arrives here. The hotel is also only about 10-15 minutes walking away from some of Barcelona's most famous attractions: Gaudi's Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. Also, being on the Las Ramblas, it's only about 5 minutes or so walking from the amazing La Boqueria market (not to be missed!), and right in the Gothic Quarter. That being said, we weren't that fond of our stay here because of several things: the bed, the shower, and the temperature of the room. We stayed in the Le Meridien for 5 nights, and each night, the room temperature was hot and uncomfortable for sleeping (even though we dialed down the thermostat to the lowest setting). The shower, while having great water pressure, made a mess on the bathroom floor as it's a rainshower without having a shower door or curtain. We had to leave towels on the floor throughout our stay so the water could be mopped up. The bed was not very comfortable, and I often tossed and turned while trying to sleep. We also encountered other issues in our stay: without any warning, electricity was shut off at 10pm one night for about an hour, which was in addition to the electricity shutdown earlier in the day that we were notified about in advance. We called down to the front desk who said that the entire vicinity was affected by the electricity shutdown (though that wasn't true as  we were able to see that the hotel across the street had electricity), and they had no idea when electricity would be resumed. I showered that night in darkness, with only my phone's flashlight application as light. Based on all the factors mentioned above, in my opinion, this is just an average hotel choice, with the best thing about this hotel being its location.",3,2011,06,12
37,Great location and service,We stayed at Le Meridien for three days.  I was worried because of the reviews about the noise.  We stayed on the third floor right on Las Ramblas and we did not hear any noise!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.  The location was great for walking around.  It was a good size room for a European hotel and the bathroom and shower were spacious and very nice.,5,2011,06,03
37,Good value when compared to other Starwood properties,"We arrived at Le Meridian after 5 awful days at the Westin Vendome in Paris.  This hotel gets a lot more right – strong showers, normal sized rooms, no filthy stains on everything, fast internet, huge flat-screen TV and, for the kids – American TV to include the all-important Disney Channel.  The location is great – I’ve never seen such a large variety of restaurants in such close walking proximity.  There is a nice grocery right around the corner, and a laundry down the street.
Things that I found annoying include the African noises that are played loudly in the tiny elevator, complete lack of bottled water on their free water stand in the hallway, and the maids that walk into the room unannounced as if attempting to catch ya doin’ the nasty.  The doors of each of the rooms close with a large shuddering thud that is heard all throughout the hotel. 
I did not get the “best-room-upgrade” because, as the clerk at the front desk explained, “all of our suites are for guests that paid for their rooms.”  I used StarPoints for this stay, but it’s not like they are free. In fact, when purchasing them at their “discounted” rate of $1550/80,000 points, the price of the room is exactly the same as paying cash.  The one benefit of points however, is that there are no taxes or fees added on, which is nice.  As a Starwood Platinum Elite member, I have yet to experience the best-room-upgrade anywhere I stay, which stinks. I guess that I need to stay at places no one else wants to go to...
All in all, I am happy with this hotel - and I’m not easily pleased.",4,2011,06,02
37,The worst experience ever!,"With a notable exception, have had better service from understaffed motels.  Manager should be fired immediately, as the general approach to guest treatment is that they are of no importance to his success.  The lobby is a zoo in every morning, and there is a complete lack of service people to handle the influx of travelers.  I agree with the earlier comments about the amount of time it took to get the attention of the overworked concierge (i.e., 30-40 minutes) – this desk is understaffed, and occasionally not staffed at all.  Other posts were haphazardly abandoned as well, including the front door, the porter, the café.  Trainees were running the front desk so every transaction took an excessive length of time to complete.  And, agreeing with earlier comments of a guest staying at the same time, there were flight crews there every night, surely paying significantly less than the outrageous prices we paid for this overrated 5-star hotel with the ridiculous view of an alley and someone’s dirty laundry.  

Our stay happened to coincide with a demonstration at the Plaza Catalunya one day (close to hotel), and a celebration of the Barcelona futbol win over England the next.  This resulted in road closures both days, and celebrations ending in violence the second day.  Accustomed to 5 star service when traveling, we are always advised by our hotel of local goings-on anywhere in the world.  No such advisement was forthcoming here despite their knowledge of our plans.  Thus we were caught in the middle of the celebration/rioting in Plaza Catalunya, dressed for a cocktail party.   Never again would we stay there with that manager in charge.",1,2011,06,02
37,Great Stay in a Central Location!,"We had a good stay at the Le Meridian. We stayed 1 day prior to our cruise and 2 days after our cruise. The location is awesome. It is located on La Rambas in the middle of everything. It is only a few blocks between 2 metro stops and also a 5 minute walk to the Aerobus stop from the airport. 5.30 E per person. For the cruise, we walked down La Rambas toward Colon and there is a shuttle for 2E a person that will take you to the cruise terminal. The day after the cruise ships arrive back, the shuttle starts at 8AM. We had to wait 1/2 hour after getting off the ship so FYI!

The room was nice. We actually stayed in 2 separate rooms during our visit. The first room prior to our cruise was a standard room on 5th with 2 beds. We were on the SPG floor due to our gold status. The beds were comfty and the rainshower shower was nice.  There was a tv in the bathroom too. They had complementary water and apples you can pick up when you get off the elevator on that floor.

The room was not the newest but was functional and the location cannot be beat.

Our second room, after the cruise, we got a deluxe room on the 8th floor. This room was a lot roomier! Huge bathroom with Tub (so no rainshower) but nice water pressure. Best part was we got a balcony/terrace with our room! Sliding doors lead to a square table and 2 comfty chairs. We had a nice breakfast picnic made up of things we bought from the Carrefour supermarket downstairs and the Le Boqeria market 2 blocks away. We were picked up fresh fruit (many 1E for fresh watermelon or pineapple) and 1-1.5 E for fresh fruit juice in a variety of flavors! Really great! 

When we checked in, they gave us a little card for 2 free cups of coffee or capaccino at the hotel cafe/bar downstairs in the lobby. Hotel offers free internet in the lobby. It is in 30 minute intervals but can resign on after your 30 minutes are up with no additional charge.

In terms of noise, the first night we were on the back side of the hotel so really quiet. The second stay, we were on the La Rambas side but  that evening the Barcelona football team won the championship so lots of fireworks, chanting, and happy people in the streets till early in the morning so the noise we could hear but we were so tired from walking we feel asleep anyway. 

We overall had a good stay due to the proximity of this hotel. Close to trains, buses and walkable to many things. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2011,06,01
37,Excellent location and comfortable room,"We stayed here for 5 nights in the middle of May and had a great stay.  The location was perfect.  In the center of everything.  The room was silent and had a very comfortable bed- we slept like babies.  We stayed on Starwood points so I can't comment on the value in regard to the price.  The computer lab and gym were amount the best I've seen at hotels of this type and the sun terrace as nice as well.  We were invited to a lunch and paella making demonstration as we are Starwood preferred guests and that was a real treat. The staff is very knowledgeable an friendly.  I would love to stay there again, hopefully we will be back!",5,2011,06,01
37,Great Staff and the best hotel and location in Barcelona,"Hi 
	I have just visited Barcelona with my partner and stayed at the Le Meridien in Barcelona, I live in Sydney Australia and my partner lives in Manchester UK and when we catch up we like to go to nice places and stay in a very nice hotel. 
	We both found are stay at the Hotel very enjoyable from the moment we meet the front of house team including Mayra to asking back of house staff for extra towels etc for our room. The room was extremely nice and the bed was very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to all that want to come to Barcelona and want to spoil themselves the location is one of the best in the city with easy walking distance to all the main areas and is only a minute away from the Las-Ramblas

37,Fantastic !,"I requested a newly renovated room, however, upon arrival I was given an older room.  I therefore asked to be moved and was given a lovely bright room.  My request was handled beautifully by your staff member Michael, he was very courteous & professional.  

The room service gentleman was very happy and polite and even delivered my meal so he could apologise when there was a slight miscommunication when ordering.

I thought this hotel was amazing.  Everyone was so friendly and nothing was too much problem.",5,2011,05,31
37,Quiet Hotel on Las Ramblas,"We stayed in a junior suite which was very nice. No view with room, but then again your not there to be in the room. The bathroom tile floors are heated, american style shower, even though the hotel is off the Las Ramblas you don't hear the outside street noise at night. Staff was nice and helpful. The hotel is approximately 1/4 mile from the plaza where the airport buses drop you off and pick you up. Walk down the middle of the Ramblas and hotel is on on your right. It is an easy walk even with luggage. Plus the buses are cheaper than getting a taxi. The only thing that I have a problem with this hotel is the cost of the wi fi in your room. It is free downstairs but is cost 6.95 Euros for 20 min in your room.",5,2011,05,31
37,Exeptional service and location,"The staff and the hotel were both exceptional.  The service was above the high quality usually expected at Le Meridien. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am visiting Barcelona. The service, kindness of the staff, knowledge of the concierge who we booked a tour through in Barcelona, cleanliness of the rooms was all impeccable.

The location is perfect a 3 minute walk from the Plaça de Catalunya, the main square at the top of Las Ramblas where the airport shuttle, metro as well as BCN tours stop.  It is also convenient to Passeig de Gràcia, a major shopping street which also is the location of Gaudi's famous Casa Batlló.  My son and I walked there from the hotel a couple of times.  There are numerous restaurants in all price ranges close.  

The hotel restaurant is also quite good. We had breakfast as well as dinner there one evening and the service and food were both outstanding. 

This hotel is well worth the time and money.",5,2011,05,30
37,Fantastic service!,"My husband and I booked this hotel for 1 night before we left for a cruise out of Barcelona (we bid for a 5-star hotel on Priceline).

When we arrived at the hotel, the credit card machines were down, so we were politely ushered to the hotel bar and given free drinks.  We waited for about a half hour, and then someone carried our luggage to our room for us.  To our surprise, we had been upgraded to a 2-room suite for our inconvenience (we were more than happy with the free drinks!)  The suite had a large living area, with a couch, dining table, and desk.  The bedroom was in a separate room, and the bed was VERY comfortable!  The bathroom was HUGE and even had a tv in it!

The location of the hotel is AMAZING!  It is right on Las Ramblas, so you walk outside and are in the heart of Barcelona.  There are tons of restaurants, shopping, and things to do right outside of the hotel.  

We will definitely stay here again if we visit Barcelona, the room, location, and service were all fantastic!",5,2011,05,25
37,Great location but rooms are Spartan,"We stayed at Le Meridien the weekend of May 7, and were well pleased. The address is 111 Rambla, but the entrance is off a side street, so it was relatively quiet. Only minor noise came from the subway below the street.

The rooms are Spartan compared to Westin and other Starwood properties we stayed in this trip. Only one easy chair and one desk chair to sit on. The bathroom did not allow much privacy.

We arrived several hours early due to our flight schedule from Newark. We were greeted promptly and the bellman secured our luggage. We were given a coupon to get a cup of expresso or capucino with a biscuit in the lounge while we waited for our room to be readied. Front desk personnel were always willing to help, but often had to wait until they finished with other guests. Same with the concierge desk.

The restaurant was a little pricey. I believe it was something like 28euros for an average breakfast buffet. We found it more interesting to try the restaurants recommended by TripAdvisor than to eat other meals in the hotel.

The location was great. You can walk to all of the old quarter easily from Le Meridien or to Gaudi's Cathedral. Ramblas is great for people watching, and in spite of reports of petty theft, we felt comfortable walking about in the evening.",4,2011,05,25
37,Would never stay at this hotel again,"I do not normally write a bad review, but Le Meridian warrants an exception:

My wife and I have been travelling for over 35 years.  We tend to stay in either 4 or 5 star hotels.  

We have taken several Tauck tours and when we do not, we usually stay at hotels that Tauck uses.

We have just returned from 8 days in Spain.  In Madrid we stayed at the Westin Palace, in Seville at the Alfonso VIII and in Barcelona at Le Meridian, three hotels Tauck uses.

We loved our stay at both the Westin Palace in Madrid and the Alfonso VIII in Seville.

First here is what we liked at Le Meridian:

Rain shower, location on La Ramblas and the flat screen TV – although not HD.

Here is what we found fault with at Le Meridian:

We had an “internet special” rate of 282 Euros plus VAT, normal rate is 332 Euros, which came out to a bit over $430 per day.

When we arrived we had to ask the doorman to take our luggage.  In our stay we observed all too often the doorman watching guests drag their luggage up the stairs and through the lobby – hardly what you would expect in a 5 star hotel.

On two occasions we waited over 35 minutes to see the concierge.  This is totally unacceptable for a 5 star hotel.

The décor and size of the lobby is more like a Best Western than a European 5 Star hotel.  We have come to expect and enjoy a grand lobby to relax in after a day of sightseeing.

There was an incessant playing, and at a high level, of European Techno Rock music in the lobby.  If that was not bad enough there was weird music and or sounds playing without stop in the elevators.

Most of the front desk staff were “Trainees”. 

The rooms are extremely small.  So small in fact that there is not enough room between the foot of the bed and the wall for a dresser!

A small point, but there was no bidet in the bathroom, something we have come to expect in a European 5 Star hotel.

The beds were extremely soft – so soft that in the morning we awoke with stiff backs.

Another observation:  There were numerous flight crews staying in our hotel.  We know that they were not paying anywhere what we were paying.  It is irritating to know that you are paying substantially more than other guests – even with an internet special. 

Finally, we have come to expect that there is a charge for internet service in our rooms.  At the Le Meridian there is free WI-FI in the lobby.  However, it is restricted to only 30 minutes per day.

Neither my wife nor I would ever stay at this hotel again.",1,2011,05,22
37,Can Only Sing High Praises Here!!!,"First time in Barcelona -started a Oceania cruise here -- chose the Meridien for 2 nights pre-cruise. Could not have been more pleased! Bell and Front Desk Staff eager to please and easy to communicate with. Ate several meals in the restaurant and enjoyed the regional menu items and attentive service. Our 5th floor room was quiet. Loved the bath and modern touches. As everyone notes- could not have a better location. Walked to PIcasso museum, cathedral, mercado, and all over the Rambla. We  travel in April for cooler weather and fewer crowds. There is a Starbucks across the street, too.  Would not hesitate to return here.",5,2011,05,22
37,wonderful,"this was my first experience at a le meridien hotel. I was very happy with everything. I loved our room, the service was wonderful and everyone was helpful. You do not find that in some hotels especially since we were traveling out of the country.”",5,2011,05,17
37,Terrific location and comfortable room with friendly hotel staff,"Front desk staff helpful, and concierge was also helpful. We were not familiar with the area, and the concierge took time to answer our questions. The front desk was accommodating to check us in earlier than the usual check-in time, as we arrived from the US earlier than your usual check-in time and were very tired. This meant so much to be able to get settled after a very long flight!”",5,2011,05,16
37,Great Location & Very Helpful Staff,"Located right in the center of Las Ramblas.  Everything very accessible by short walk.  Less than 5 min. walk from Placa Cataluyna where the Aerobus arrives/departs for the airport, a 5 min walk to La Boqueria market (a must see).  Public buses are very easy and cheap--one bus that passes the hotel heads all the way to the beach--only a 5-10 min ride.  Only 'problem' with this location is it's proximity to the crowds of tourists.  I was one so shouldn't complain, but I was SHOCKED how crowded the Ramblas was with young kids.  If you're a tourist and just want to get out and walk then this is the place ior you.  But if you're a couple on a romantic getaway the pay the little bit extra (it really wasn't much more) and stay at the W!  The only reason I rate the value as 3/5 is because of the weak US$, Europe is really expensive for Americans now.",4,2011,05,15
37,Nice hotel in wonderful city,"We used Starwoods points to stay five nights at Le Meridien. The location is perfect, literally in the center of La Rambla section, which while crawling with tourists (like ourselves) is the place to stay. It's by the Gothic quarter with its narrow, charming streets, the Cathedral and a number of museums, including the Picasso, a few Gaudi structures and the waterfront. The hotel's lobby is small, but a nearby parlor/library with a coffee bar in am, wine bar in evening is a nice place to relax. Each evening, Adolfo Almagro, the charming director of sales for the hotel, would provide guests with a glass of excellent Spanish sparkling wine (up to 8 pm). We didn't like the first room we were given. I complained to Vera at the front desk and she graciously accommodated us by giving us a room (#108) which looked out at the lively scene on La Rambla. There is free internet in the lobby; in room it must be paid for. All staff members were helpful, polite and hardworking and the rooms were very clean and, while relatively small, quite comfortable. We would defintely stay at Le Meridien again on a return to Barcelona.",4,2011,05,15
37,Great Location- Good hotel,"The hotel was modern, and located near las ramblas. The rooms were good but not great. Again, we paid for location. The bathroom was modern and the rooms were comfortable but I expected a bit more than what we received. The location however was great, and this in my opinion can help a hotel overcome some shortfalls.

The staff was good but not the friendliest we have ever encountered. I do not have much to say other than it is a good hotel in a great location, however I am sure there are better deals out there to be had.",4,2011,05,14
37,Le Meridien Hotel is a traveler's oasis!!,"As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by courteous, professional staff fluent in several languages.  The rooms were spacious, great AC, safe, Euro-style bathroom (no shower door), and much to my wife's delight...a working hair dryer.  The hotel had 2 bars and a restaurant.  Great service there and a great selection of wines/whiskeys.  The hotel is right on a corner on Las Ramblas.  Everyone will warn you about the pickpockets...just stay alert, watch your wallet/purse, don't drink too much (such is the case in all big cities).  Barcelona is a modern, beautiful city.  Its look is strongly influenced by all of her artists (modernist architecture, Gaudi).  

Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a very nice place with great service.",5,2011,05,13
37,"Great Location, Great Accommodations","We used our frequent flyer miles for our one night stay in Barcelona before our Mediterranean cruise and our stay was awesome! The hotel location is right in the center of Las Ramblas and super convenient to everything to see, do and eat! The concierge was great; she completely mapped out Gaudi sites within walking distance, tapas joints where locals go and metro rails that would take us to where we wanted to go. Service staff were all really nice, the free use of internet at the business center was truly appreciated, and the free Illy coffee welcome vouchers was a great bonus! 

Our room was really nice: very modern and with an exceptional view from our walk out terrace. We only regretted not having had more time to stay at the hotel and explore more of Barcelona. We look forward to coming back, though! Our stay at Le Meridian was the perfect start to our vacation!",5,2011,05,09

37,a very nice place to stay,We were very pleased with this hotel.  The entrance just off la ramblas could not be better.  The rooms - especially the beds and pillows were as good as I have found.  The staff were great and the service impecable. Across the street is a good restaurant and a comfortable bar.  There is a great gym.,4,2011,05,03

37,Central hotel in Barcelona,"Stayed at Le Meridien in Barcelona for three nights during my Easter vacation after a cruise.

The hotel is located very central in Barcelona, only a few minutes walk from Catalunia square at La Rambla. At arrival we were meet by very friendly staff in the reception. Our room was not ready when we arrived, however it was still a couple of hours until check-in time. The receptionist helped us store the luggage.

The room it self was nice, both the room and the bathroom was clean. Our room had a king-bed, and it was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was served in the Cent 111 Onze restaurant, and was very good, and reasonable priced compared to other hotels in Barcelona. The only remark I have of the stay was that the housekeeping staff was very slow. Our room was not made up before 16:00 one of the days, and one evening we also did not get turn-down service in the room.

Overall we had a very good stay, and I can recommended Le Meridien Barcelona.",4,2011,04,27
37,great location but expected more from SPG,"Great location but we expected more.  As an SPG Platinum member I specifically picked Le Meridien  for our weekend break.  On previous stays, at other locations eg Cape Town, we have been treated exceedingly well, and received a suite upgrade plus complimentary breakfast.  But not on thic occasion , even though I queried the lack of breakfast.

The room we received was small and functional. 

 However, the conceirge was fantastic and helped with all our queries and also secured us tickets for the Barcelona football game.

Opposite is the BarLobo which was busy and full of life, and the food was good.  Segardo opposite Bar Lobo had a great set price lunch menu which we enjoyed on our first day as we had only just arrived.

If you need to take the airport bus it's about 10 minutes away (easy walk on La Rambla) and is 5.30 euros each.  We took this back , having taken a cab from the airport (30 euros)",3,2011,04,25
37,"Great location & service, small rooms","We came here with our inlaws and friends and its a great location in Barcelona. Right on Las Ramblas and walking distance to lots of great restaurants and scenes and the metro.  Service was great, the concierge is truly very helpful.  However, the rooms are a bit small even for Europe. We had a recently remodeled room which was nicely done but a bit cramped.  Our friends got a suite that was not remodeled and it was definitely not as good. If you're looking for a convenient good place in Barcelona and don't mind small rooms then this is great choice.",4,2011,04,25
37,"Great location, overall excellent place to stay","I had read prior to our stay that the hotel had been undergoing remodeling and that there was a huge quality difference if you got an old room versus one that had been remodeled.  Hence, I requested in advance in writing for a newer room.  As a platinum preferred guest, Starwood hotels are typically very good about accomodating such requests.  I repeated my request when I checked in as I understand that they cannot always block certain rooms prior to arrival.  I was very nice about it, however the girl checking us in was snooty.  Still it was disappointing to see that in a Starwood property as all the other hotels in our stay were excellent.  She put us in a suite, however it was an old suite that had yet to be remodeled. It smelled musty, the carpet was dirty, and the bed was old and hard.  Also, the couches were so worn, it was embarrassing that they were still using them.  I called down and asked if we could please be moved to a remodeled room, we do not need a suite, just a newer bed would be nice, in a newer room that didn't smell.  This is where I got a bit frustrated because the same woman who checked us in was a bit argumentative about my request to move, and kept telling me how she upgraded us.  I told her we don't really care about an upgrade to a suite with its own deck, we would be happy to wait for a smaller newer room, iif that meant we could sleep in a more comfortable bed at night, and after what felt like some convincing, she founds us a room.

We did finally get moved and it was an excellent upgraded, remodelled room, with a fairly comfortable bed.  Despite the check in process, overall our stay was quite pleasant.  The rooms are surprisingly quiet even overlooking Las Ramblas.  The service people who came to our rooms were very very pleasant and Antonio in the coffee bar was a true gentleman.  The bathroom is nice and modern and the shower is great.  Our room was quite large with a separate living area which was excellent to relax in over a drink in the evenings before heading out to dinner.  The location is super convenient.

The one annoyance are the blue lights that turn on at night.  We had to place a pillow over the sensor as the light kept coming on and off disturbing our sleep.",4,2011,04,18
37,Le Meridien Barcelona - The Best!,"The reception upon arrival was gracious; and, we were pleased that the room was ready immediately.  The room was nicely appointed.  We enjoyed the free WiFi.  Housekeeping was prompt, thorough, and made follow-up calls to ensure that their service met our needs.  Staff at the reception desk were always helpful.  We liked the hotel's decor and layout.  The breakfast buffet was very satisfying with a welcome sample of flavored juices upon entry to the breakfast room---a treat!  Overall, we had a very pleasant stay at Le Meridien, Barcelona which encourages us to visit other Le Meridien hotels in Europe.",5,2011,04,14
37,Fab Fab Fab,Great service from start to finish - we were upgraded to suite - the reception staff were really helpful - yes on a noisy street but rooms have double gazing so no problem - great location will definitely return - a real 5 star hotel,5,2011,03,31
37,Spot On,"""Everything was beautiful!  The location is perfect, guestrooms are amazingly spacious and the front desk is a dream come true.  The passion to help and the recommendations that are given were spot on.  Highly praised, can not be beat.",5,2011,03,28
37,sensational staff,“ The staff was excellent.  There was one bellman in particular who helped us.  I don't remember his name but he had lived in the United States and is being promoted to the front desk at the hotel in Barcelona.  His smile was infectious and his attitude was exemplary  This was our second stay at this hotel and we would definitely go back again.  The location can't be beat.”,5,2011,03,28

37,“ best hotel in Barcelona--period!!!,"I have stayed in many---no need to hurt their feelings. Le Meridien knows the business of taking care of guests and catering to the needs of the traveler. They are forthright, deliberate in their efforts to attend every little request making a memorable stay.

37,LOVELY HOTEL,"The location is perfect and our room was very nice, especially the large bathroom. We got a great deal on this hotel by bidding through Priceline, so for the price we paid it was an excellent value. We liked the complimentary fruit, water and newspapers, as well as the free use of computers in the business centre. The hotel staff were very polite and helpful.",5,2011,03,27
37,Very friendly staff including security staff. Food was great but breakfast was repeated.,A great place to stay - with amazingly friendly staff.,5,2011,03,27
37,Great Location,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night in September 2010.  We redeemed starwood points for the stay.  It is a fantastic location, however, for the price you pay and the cost of cabs in Barcelona it is not imperative to stay in the center of town.  The subway system is also very efficient and takes you to three areas of Las Ramblas.  Unless you have the cash to burn, or the starwood points to redeem there are many other great options.  
Pros:
Great location
Great service 
Lobby is a great place to relax with a coffee
Close to Bar Lobo - great lunch spot! (Across the Street)

Cons:
Costly 
Small rooms (large in European standards but for the price you are paying I don't think it's worth it)

Overall if you are willing to splurge it is worth it, but there are many other great options in Barcelona!",4,2011,03,26
37,"Excellent location, modern hotel, excellent service","We were very happy the moment we walked into the lobby. The decor is very modern. The check in staff was very friendly. We loved hanging out in the lobby and having a coffee and snack in the morning and afternoon. The rooms were very nice, perfect size, beautiful bathroom, comfortable bed. If you get up in the night there is a scensored blue light that comes on which was very cool. We found it to be very relaxing. We had breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant. It was an excellent buffet but was too over priced so we didn't do that again. That was our only complaint.",5,2011,03,24
37,"Hola, Wonderful Le Meridien Barcelona","Date : Feb 28 2011
We narrowed down on this place to run an annual event, and guess what we this was an amazing experience.

We had a global team from all over the world coming in for a 5 day event. Considering we were in Europe we were never short of what we wanted. Great team managing the operations followed by great service. Staff is very proactive and attentive and all the challenges that we noted on paper during planning phase was overcome ease.

Also the group had about 25% vegetarian people and their requirements were met. We had chef's who were taking care of us in and out ensuring all is good.

Hotel rooms were perfect and it's a amazing property to stay in. I recommend this property.",5,2011,03,24
37,"A well located, well run hotel, in a great location","A great hotel. Friendly staff from checking in to house keeping. The room was ready, nothing missing. Robes, shoe cleaning, iron, umbrella. Ready is much harder to find than you would ever think in a hotel. I even got a call asking if the room was to my satisfaction. That simple call always denotes a well run hotel.

At check in I was given a voucher for the Modern Art Museum, another for a free cup of coffee in the bar. Little things but appreciated. The museum was great and passed a couple of hours. 

Dinner at the restaurant was simple and wonderful. I stay in hotels all the time (200 nights per year) and this meal was one of the very best I have ever had in a hotel. You must try the Creme Catalana, amazing.

The hotel is in La Rambla, in the centre of the city. The restaurant was totally sound proofed and it was quite surreal to watch police cars, ambulances, motor bikes and hundreds of people gliding paste the window in near silence. Silence is a novel experience in any part of Spain.",5,2011,03,23
37,Great Location - Nice Rooms,"Efficient check in and check out, room standard as expected, lovely bathrooms, quiet rooms with comfortable beds.  Chose to pay extra to have breakfast in Cent Onze (the hotels restaurant) and wished we hadnt.  Very poor indeed.  Otherwise a very comfortable stay right on the Ramblas.  Location wise, you cant get better!",4,2011,03,15
37,not a 5 star hotel,"Great location with modern remodeled rooms which were a bit small.
Walking distance to La Rambla and old town.
Lobby is OK but not 5 star. No pool, No gym
Claims to have a spa which consists of one small massage room on the 6th floor. The biggest problem was that the heating (temperature control) is centrally operated. The heating was on and we could not lower our room temperature. We opened the windows to get some fresh air and along with that got all the noise from La Rambla which resulted in no sleep that night.
In my humble opinion.......
This is a very decent hotel which deserves 4 stars but NOT 5.
I would recommend the hotel for the location if you get a good deal.",4,2011,03,13
37,Too HOT to handle!,"My boyfriend and I recently returned from our trip. The location was good but the rooms were far too hot! The air conditioning was deliberately turned off because they were too 'energy efficient' and cheap to have it on in mid-March. The room was like an oven and impossible to sleep in. What kind of 5* hotel doesn't have air conditioning in a room? The staff were very unhelpful regarding the issue by giving poor advice to open the window which didn't help. 
I would really urge people to think twice before staying considering the rooms are like a sauna. 
Also, the hotel has no free internet, you have to pay 21 euros a night which is not good value for money.",2,2011,03,12
37,Beautiful Barcelona,"“Hotel was ideally located in Barcelona. Our overall experience was quite pleasant. The room was small, but extremely well laid out. Amenities were very good. We enjoyed the very central location and would most definitely stay at Le Meridien again.”",4,2011,03,10
37,Outstanding facility,"Outstanding facility, great location and customer service. Maintenance staff came quickly and fixed our TV connection problem as soon as we called.  Complimentary computers in business center with fast internet if you are not travelling with your own.",5,2011,03,09
37,Excellent stay in Barcelona,"Friendly and professional staff, excellent rooms, excellent location, and good breakfast.",5,2011,03,09
37,"Fun, funky hotel in the heart of things.","We stayed two nights at Le Meridien as the final destination in a weeklong visit to Spain.  The location can't be beat.  You can walk through Las Ramblas, people watching and experiencing all the while.  You can visit Barri Gotic, Ribera, L'Eixample, and the harborfront easily -- touching base back at the hotel to refresh as needed.  Also, you are just a few blocks from the Placa de Catalunya, which is a major transit hub to just about everywhere else.  There are PLENTY of places to eat and shop, not to mention a wealth of cultural and historical sites -- all within easy walking distance.

We heard a lot about possible pickpockets in Barcelona and were on high-alert throughout our stay, but we experienced nothing that gave us the slightest concern.  The weather was really lovely -- blue skies and warm, not to say hot, which pleasantly surprised us as we thought the weather in February would be colder.  The food in the area is delicious -- we did not try the food in the hotel beyond some very basic breakfasts.  Not on purpose, there were just so many other places to choose from, we didn't have the chance!!  We loved that there are lots of unique boutiques in the area -- we could do a lot of shopping that didn't feel like we were in a mall back in the US.  

The hotel is modern and artsy -- which was a lot of fun.  The service was good, and the rooms were immaculate.  We had a terrific set of adjoining rooms with an incredible view over Las Ramblas.  The beds are very, very comfortable.  The bathroom in the suite was one of the best I've ever seen in a hotel -- not large, but the rainhead shower had great water pressure with great temperature range, and could be used simultaneously with a handheld.  

The only thing we experienced that might not work for everyone is the noise from Las Ramblas on Friday (and, I'm sure, Saturday) night.  The windows are thick, and do a decent job of keeping the room quiet, but it is, after all, an internationally famous party-promenade.  I think this was part of the fun but, if you are insistent on absolute quiet, a Las Ramblas-fronting room would not be your best choice.  I'm sure, though, that Le Meridien offers other rooms with different frontings. We liked the fun and action of the front rooms.",4,2011,02,27
37,Great Location,"Right on Las Ramblas so just walk out the door and see everything.  Hotel is very european and chic.  Great Sheraton bed, large bathroom, quiet hallways, some english TV, and very accommodating.  Easy walk to the tour bus lines.  Lots of great restaurants nearby.",5,2011,02,25
37,Great Location and Helpful Staff,"For our first trip to Barcelona, it was great to have our hotel only 1/2 block away from La Rambla.  We were able to walk to many of the local favorites, such as Barri Gotic, Mercat de La Boqueria and the Port. Very easy metro access to La Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell and other favorite sites.

One of the hotel's best features is their outstanding concierge. Kudos to both Gil and Borja, who went out of their way to help us with a problem on our airline tickets, besides giving us wonderful recommendations for restaurants. They even locating a laundry mat and post office closeby.  We had a six night stay and every night we were nicely greeted by the staff.

When we return to Barcelona, we definitely will stay here again!",4,2011,02,07
37,Nice Hotel but horrible security-had our passports stolen,"We booked to stay at this nice 5 star hotel in Barcelona after our cruise as it was recommended by the cruiseline and was in the heart of Las Ramblas-the popular tourist area in Barcelona. We checked in the hotel and they put us in a VIP waiting are for residents only until our rooms were ready and our briefcase (with passports, photographs, money etc.) was stolen right from beside us in this VIP room. It was supposedly only residents of the hotel and staff in this room and it had no cameras (which I'm sure the staff knew about) and we were devastated. I cannot believe the lack of security in a 5 star hotel",3,2011,02,06
37,Pleasantly surprised with the standard of the hotel.,"The hotel is in a very good location, lots of shopping, beautiful Cathedrals and very close to the docks. The standard of the hotel was very high, rooms were of very good quality and the bed was the best bed I have ever slept in. The flat screen television in the toilet was a good touch.

The staffs were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was fresh with a wide range of choice. I would definitely go back again, hopefully this year.

Tip: Catch the Aerobus from the airport and take it to Plaza Catalunya, the last stop.  Only 5 Euros and the journey is 25 minutes. From the Plaza to hotel is a 7 minute walk.",5,2011,01,29
37,"Great location, rooms and services reflected in the price","Stayed there in January 2011 for a four night business trip. Great location on La Rambla between Placa de Catalunya (5 min by foot) and Liceu (10 min) metro stations.

Clean rooms, good choice for breakfast and kind staff.

Only reason why I would never use this hotel as a private trip accomodation is the price.",4,2011,01,28
37,Perfect location in Barcelona,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and when you walk down and you are in Las Ramblas!  We had a car as we came from France so we had to pay 20 Euros in a public parking as the hotel charges 35 euros.  I expected it to be a bigger hotel but it is located in the best place in Barcelona!  The staff was very friendly and helpful!  There is a fee for internet in the room but the staff told me I could go to the business center and get free internet.  Also, you can ask for the password in the lobby and you can get free internet with your laptop or phone.  The bathroom was lovely with a tv and we also had a veranda so you can go out and look down at the street activities.  They gave me 4 free admission to a museum which was just an ok museum for me and 2 free capuccinos in the small cafe in the lobby.  We also dined at Cent Onze, their restaurant and we enjoyed their pre fixe lunch for 16 euros.  You do not need to tip in Europe as everything is inclusive with the price.  We also walked in Las Ramblas at night to do more sight seeing and we ended up in Placa Real and had some tapas for dinner.  I definitely recommend this hotel for its great location!",5,2011,01,26
37,Really good hotel in central location - but no free wifi!,"Great location just off La Ramblas. Decor and rooms typical of a chain; shower excellent. Staff attentive without being overbearing - and they had a smile on their faces. Nice to see they are taking sustainability seriously by extending the opportunity to not have your linen changed everyday. If you want it changed you just leave a card on the bed. Bar lacked character and atmosphere, decor looks like it's a corporate standard. Happy to store my baggage once I'd checked out until I was ready to leave for the airport.",4,2011,01,26
37,"EXCELLENT SERVICE, LOCATION AND SPACIOUS ROOMS","We stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights in Le Meridien and loived the hotel. The service is gr8 at the hotel, staff is very friendly and accomodating. Location of the hotel is superb, its on the most happening street of Barcelona - La Ramblas. Excellent hotels, major shopping district everything is just outside the hotel. There is a supermarket just next to hotel, which is very convenient. The day tour buses are accessible in a minute. Rooms are contemporary and spacious. Breakfast can be improved, variety a little less.
But overall worth the money.",4,2011,01,22
37,The Hottest Hotel in Spain - and I mean Farenheit!,"I stayed in this property last week. The location was great and they hotel was very trendy. I spent the entire night trying to cool the room off. I would guess it was close to 80 F in there. My colleague, who was on a different floor had the same experience. It seems like they must have disabled the air conditioning system in the hotel for the winter. Check the forecast and if it looks like a warm spell in Spain, pass on this hotel.

I spent one night at the W hotel in Barcelona and thought the property was much better all the way around.",3,2011,01,18
37,"Good, but not perfect","Overall, Le Meridien was pretty good, but came up short in a few areas.  Room was well priced, well appointed and up-to-date. Very comfortable.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, but didn't follow through on a couple of occasions.  Hotel breakfast (included in package) was very good, wait staff very attentive. Concierge was spread a little thin, but did manage to give a good restaurant recommendation (Matamala).  Hotel is in great location.  Would stay again.",4,2011,01,17
37,"nice hotel, bad staff","The hotel was nice, very modern, but the beds are to soft...and the worst thing of this hotel is that being 5 stars hotel somebody came into my room and stole my money...The only thing the hotel said was that the staff was working with them like 15 years...",3,2011,01,17
37,pros and cons,"just returned from a one week stay- we were in a standard room ( which is called a ""deluxe room"" by the hotel)

PROS
1. great location on las ramblas- an easy walk from la boqueria, and other major sights;
2. excellent shower- great pressure;
3. free water and apples on our floor every morning;
4. friendly staff;
5.they have live USA sporting events on the tv in the hotel bar ( i saw the second half of the green bay -philadelphia nfl playoff game).

CONS
1. housekeeping was so so- at least 3 times they left dirty glasses in our room;
2. there was no room fan and it was stuffy in the room unless you opened the window in which case you heard the noise from las ramblas at all hours of the nite ( we went to bed no earlier than 2 am  and would leave the window open until we couldn't stand the noise any longer- so we would close the window and then sweat). so as a result, we did not sleep well;
3. the room itself was small;
4. the hotel restaurant- an italian place was awful. we made the mistake of dining there one night and 7 out of our party of 8 thought it was poor;
5. they charge 19 euros per nite for internet access in the room- they do provide a business center with 4 computers- 2 nites only one was working properly.",4,2011,01,16
37,Prime location. Need I say more?,"Located right on the Las Ramblas, the main street with plenty going on. This means everything is literally at the doorstep:  the metro, La Boqueria market, many shops, squares, the shore, restaurants and every hot spots except (Sagrada Famelia & Parc Guell).

The room has small  little touches, like the blue light that comes on in the night if you get up. The bathrooms have the large disc shower heads–nice

Front line staff were adequately knowledgeable but gave the impression that “they have to serve” rather than “they want to serve”. The shining star of the team must certainly be Martha at Front Desk. She has plenty of enthusiasm and demonstrated genuine interest and initiative  to help and serve

37,"Nice Hotel, Great Location, Only A Few Things We Would Change","We spent three days at this hotel around the Christmas holiday - we were in an upgraded room with a view of Las Ramblas.  This is a great hotel in a perfect location, right on Las Ramblas - walk distance to many attractions, metro station, Plaza Catalunya, the Aerolink bus for airport transport, and some great restaurants.  The room was nice, but could stand some updating.  The shape of the room was awkward and the large stand and tv in the middle of the floor was out of place - a flat screen plasma would save so much space in the room.  Still though, we enjoyed the room and the heated bathroom floor was a plus!  The bed was decent, firm mattress and not enough pillows, but again it did not really effect our trip at all.  The patio over Las Ramblas was huge and very nice, it was a bit too cold to sit out there, but definitely a plus!!! Excellent city views

The hotel breakfast is fantastic - we ate there every day.  We would had room service for dinner and would pass on that again.  Service across the hotel was great, and everyone was very helpful with our questions and requests.  The concierge is also extremely helpful.   Lastly, the Chinese restaurant across the street is AMAZING - great cocktails and food - definitely try it!",4,2011,01,11
37,"Extraordinary staff, rooms not soundproof, needs improvements.","I stayed here four nights, at the beginning of January. Le Meridien is definitely a pleasant hotel, located in the city centre (big plus), although I felt that it's missing some five star standards.

Let's start from the positive points:
- Staff: extremely nice. They always tried to help us. The guys in the lobby are always smiling, and figuring out if you might need some help.
- Champagne ritual: every day, at 7 pm, champagne was served to the guests in the lobby.
- Free wi-fi in the lobby.
- Rooms were cleaned accurately.

Negative aspects:
- We stayed on the second floor, not on the Rambla, and still we could hear some noise coming from outside. But what was even more disturbing, was the noise coming from our neighbours: the walls are definitely too thin. One night, some loud girls wouldn't let us sleep until 2 am.
- Wi-fi in the lobby is free, but very slow. The faster one, in the rooms, costs 19 euros per day.
- Restaurant: although lunch and dinner were cheap (16 and 19 euros respectively), they were far from being five star. The hotel wants to conquer people in Barcellona, by offering low prices, but I feel that quality is not so high.
- Parquet in our room needed to be changed!

A room costs an average of 200 euros: not cheap. That's why i believe the hotel needs some improvements.",3,2011,01,10
37,"Great Location, Nice bathroom","We stayed 5 nights in this hotel at the beginning of our 3 week spain trip.  We ended our trip in Barcelona again, but didn't stay in this hotel because they didn't want to store our luggage.  Instead we decided to stay at Hotel 1898 right accross the street for the end of our trip and stored our luggage there while we tour spain.  

The Hotel has a modern style with nice room and nice bathroom.  Besides the bathrobe, slipper etc, I love the fact that they have a scale in the room :)  The room is modern, but not in the cold minimalistic way.  It is still cozy even though it looks a bit slick. 

Near the elevator, they provide free fruits and water.  this is really handy, we always grab one on our way out.

Staff service was just okay, as expected of a hotel of that class.  Not as nice as the staff in 1898 though. 

Location of the hotel is really great.  Just off La Rambla and It is just 5 minute walk to the botequeria (the market) where we have our breakfast (great yummy breakfst w excellent coffee).",4,2011,01,10
37,Great experience!!,Everyone there was extremely courteous during my stay and made sure as a Platinum member that I was accomodated appropriately during my stay!  I would definitely stay at Le Meridien again during a future visit to Barcelona!,5,2011,01,10
37,"Awesome hotel, great room, favorite bathroom, can't wait to return!","My fiance and I spent our first night in Barcelona here. Needless to say, we decided not to leave the room when we arrived. It was gorgeous. 

The bathroom was phenomenal. The tub was so big and the shower head was like light rain. There was a phone and elegant fixtures. The robes and slippers were nice and the whole decor of the room rocked. 

We got a coupon for a free coffee in the cafe downstairs and a free pass to the Museum of Modern Art. 

The location is amazing- right off Las Ramblas. Couldn't be better. Pretty much in the middle but off the main strip so wasn't noisy. The concierge were extremely helpful. One front desk agent even took me behind the desk to let me log into my email to print out a boarding pass. 

I didn't eat in the dining room but it looked great.",5,2011,01,04
37,Great Stay,"“I had a great room with balcony, very modern, beautiful.. Staff was very friendly”",5,2011,01,03
37,good hotel and great location,"This hotel is modern and clean. The beds are not too comfortable but the room was spacious and functional. The location was great for us because this was our first time in Barcelona. We stayed during the week, so the street was not too loud at night but always thriving and busy.",4,2011,01,02
37,Strange and too expensive for the quality. Perfect position.,"This hotel is a wonderful position, being on the Ramblas and at 200 mt from Plaza de Catalunya.
This is the only reason which could let you think to pay 200euros per night (without breakfast, they offer immediately at the reception at the super special price of 15 euros per person, even before telling you your room number...), because this hotel is very ""artistic"", but not that much comfortable and useful.
The lifts were 3 but one could bring you to floors -1, 0, 5, 6, 7 and 8, while other two let you go to the 1st, 2nd 3rd, 4th, and 0 as well. Why?
The corridors are night, with a fine light and perfume.
The rooms, instead, are small and lack of services. I had tea and coffee facilities with 10 sugar lumps, and 1 only tea bag and 1 only coffee sachet for two person!!!
The closet was minimal with 6 or 7 cruthces, but had a trouser press.
The armchair was useless because the headrest could not stay immobile and usually felt down. 
The tv screen was huge, but maybe too huge for the space of the room.
Desk chair and beds were comfortable.
The bathroom was very little, its door was made in GLASS (this was right in front of the entrance door) and could not close, and had a shower that was bigger than the whole bathroom (yes, it was nice and amazing, but I'd prefer a nice bathroom, with a decent door, or a small bath, than a ""super tropical"" shower).
I asked the reception if any of the rooms had a ""normal"" bath and they offered me the little suites at 100euros per night of overprice.
I asked the reception to book a restaurant for the night and they made it after nearly 1 hour, and I had to ask repeatedly before having an answer.
I had even problems with ck-in because (I had to do it by mobile in the reception with their wi-fi) and when I asked them to make a free phone call in Spain to Spanair free number, they answered me that they couldn't do it and I could send an e-mail in the internet point at -1 floor (couldn't they tell me they had one at the ck-in, instead of giving me a silver tray with offers for breakfast, offers for museums, the keys and a bunch of receptionist's hair who became pale when saw that??!!!!)
They offer nice, black umbrellas (a little broken!) for the rain days.
For the Firm and the general evaluation, this hotel is a true delusion.
I could suggest you to choose it ONLY for the position, and ONLY when all other good hotels nearby are full booked.",3,2011,01,02
37,great location and wonderful service,"we had a great stay at this hotel. The rooms are modern and clean, the service was attentive and friendly, and small little things like free Wi-Fi in the lobby made a big difference. Would definitely recommend to friends who want a great centrally located Barcelona hotel.",5,2011,01,01
37,"The best trip of my life, made even better at Le Meridien!","Hands down, one of the best trips to Europe so far. The staff and hotel manager treated my guest and I like we were old friends. The hotel itself is in the PERFECT location, the airport bus let us within 5 walking minutes of our hotel. Our room with a balcony was ready at 11 am and it was stunning.  Big comfy bed, huge closet, flat screen tv, huge bathroom with a rainfall shower and fresh complimentary tapas waiting for us the next afternoon!
After 10 hours of sightseeing, going back to the room for a drink on the balcony was the perfect way to end the day, and once the window/doors were shut, any remaining sound from the bustling Ramblas remained outside. And the bed? Perfect.
Not only was check-in a breeze, but the staff and manager even gave a call every few days to make sure everything was going well. The hotel even has a nice gym and a coffee bar where they serve a complimentary cava every few nights..... Classy touch.
All in all, absolutely perfect stay. I'm coming back in 2012, either just before or right after Summer.... And definitely staying at Le Meridien again. Great job, guys and thank you!!!

37,Nice Hotel in the Heart of Everything,"Sometimes the thing about staying in a nice hotel in the city, especially a European city that happens to be fabulous and happens to have a ton of things to see and do, is that you really don't have a lot of time to appreciate the hotel itself. In my case, I was really just in the hotel to sleep...and for that, I'm sure I could have found something acceptable at a lower price point. However, what I paid for in large part was the location. And the location is really perfect. It is in the heart of the city. Located on the main street, La Rambla, the hotel is a 5 minute walk away from the Plaza Catalunya (the central square where the Aerobus stops and where you can get on the popular hop-on hop-off bus tours). It's also right in the gothic quarter, with many shops, restaurants, and tapas bars to choose from and close by to the famous Cathedral with the garden of geese. Nearby also, is La Boqueria - an impressive food market selling meats, cheese, spices, chocolates, breads, and everything else. 

Barcelona itself is a huge city and there really is so much to see. If you have a few days here, I'd recommend buying the 2-day ticket on the hop-on hop-off tour and alloting a day for each of the two tour routes. It really makes life easier and you don't have to worry about taking taxis. Highlights are the Casa Bottillo, Parc Guell, La Barceloneta, and Sagra Familia. 

I do wish I had a bit more time to relax and enjoy the hotel since it's very pleasant. Comfortable rooms, nice sundeck on the 6th floor, nice little Illy coffee bar. Maybe next time!",4,2010,12,27

37,Le Meridien Bacelona's Location Makes Up for Improvement Areas,"Here are my impressions on the Barcelona Le Meridien:

Area's for improvement:
- Platinum status not really recognized like at other Starwood properties I have stayed
- Request for quiet room on a high floor was not honored. The double glazed windows don't do much about the noise on the starwood guest floors 4 and 5 on La Ramblas . If you are a light sleeper and  are stuck with a low floor, request a room on the side street which is much quieter. This is the first time a request I have made was not honored by a Starwood property
- Make sure you confirm your bed type and room location before going to your room because they might just put you anywhere really and you will have to return to the front desk 
- There was not much ""service"" at this hotel and our sense was that no one seems real happy about working at the the place. 
- You rarely get a hello by hotel staff so they really don't care if you are there anyway except for one front desk guy who was fairly nice and the bed turn down lady was sweet.
- The concierge we dealt with was fair; he called a restaurant to see if it was open and available for us, and told us it was. We went there and it was closed...Yeah, weird.....
- The walls between our room and the next was very thin allowing you to listen in on your neighbors conversations. Very entertaining but not good for sleeping if the stayed up late.

The good:
- Housekeeping we thought did a nice job on the room
- The beds were pretty good; we are used to sleeping on plush pillowtops. While the beds aren't plush, we found them pretty comfortable and sleepable and the nice down duvet and pillows were very worthy of tired heads
- The heating/ac system seemed extraordinarily quiet, bravo there. No sound of shutting on and off all night. 
- Awesome floor to ceiling black out shades in the room making it very dark even in the morning hours. The motion activated nite light in main room and bathroom were nice touches.
- LOCATION: Much sightseeing is in walking distance as well as restaurants. Convenient to trains etc. For a fast coffee in the morning, starbucks is a left out the front door and a right on La Rambla and a few storefronts down. In maybe 4 minutes in the same direction, you have La Boqueria (market) where you can buy cut up fresh fruit (good place in first row as you enter) and great bakery (one of the last aisles on left side). We eschewed the hotel breakfast and picked up fruit and bakery and coffee every morning and took back the the room. It's nice seeing the market in the morning hours. 
- The Rainshower heads in the showers are phenomenal and the French amenities are very nice. You get an ample supply of hot water, very hot if you want it. The bathrooms are well appointed
- Close to a basic bike rental place (take a left on La Ramba and Left on Tallers and walk down the street for awhile and its on your left through an archway) - Biking blows away the tourist bus if you are active and want to exercise - there are some good hills to bike up to. We had 3 gears and were happy. 
- Close to a great cheap fast lunch place called Organic (right out the front door and a few doors down). They even have fresh made juices; you pick what goes in.  Save the time and bucks for nice dinners.
- A pharmancy that sells a bunch of other stuff  like bottled water is left on La Rambla and a few doors down - or pick up water at a stand in the median of La Rambla
- Tons of shopping. If you go up to Placa de Catalunya, you will find dept stores etc.

Bottom line, assuming quiet neighbors - or noisy ones that go to bed at a good hour, a room on quiet side or floor of hotel (if you are bothered by noise) and a good price, and you aren't expected a high level of service, Le Meridien would be a good choice. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped and the location is great.  However, compared to experiences at other Le Meridiens like their location in Frankfurt (really night and day), it was not as positive. The staff in Frankfurt really know what the frequent traveler is looking for.",3,2010,12,21
37,Should be a 4 star.,"If this hotel were rated as a 4 star, I would have no complaints.  I feel like this hotel would not reach 5 star status in the US.  Some of the other reviewers complain about the noise, but this is to be expected in an urban environment (it was quieter than my Manhattan apartment).  One particular concierge was also quite surly even for mundane requests like calling for a taxi.  If you are looking for a 5 star hotel in Barcelona I prefer the majestic.",4,2010,12,19
37,"Great Location, Good Service, Good Hotel","I just come back from the Le Meridien Barcelona, indeed a very nice property which has provided all the services expected and more...!
Rooms are small but well appointed and provide all amenitees incl. safe, bathtubs with rain showers, TV in the bathroom (very nice when you have enough time for a bath)! The hotel is basically in the best city center position possible, would recommend it to all travellers visiting the city!",5,2010,12,02
37,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION","This hotel is in the middle of everything. Walk outside and you are in the tourist area.  I thought the room was well laid out.  But I wasn't happy with the shower. The temperture was either freezing or too hot. It was differcult to figure out and the deep bathtub could be dangerous, getting in and out of the tub.  On the other hand, the business center was really good. We were able to print out boarding passes for the flight home.",4,2010,11,21
37,"Great location, wonderful staff, world-class hotel,","We stayed here after a 7 day mediterranean cruise. The room was quiet even though it is literally on La Rambla. The bed was heavenly and very comfortable, spacious bath with ""rain shower"" and tub.  This hotel is only 100 meters from Plaza Catalunya which is the center of great activity in Barcelona.  We hopped on the tour buses there and walked to several great restaurants and cafes.  Also similarly close to La Boqueria and the Gothic Cathedral, all locations that should not be missed when visting Barcelona. The shopping covers the spectrum of whatever you may be seeking.
The concierge staff was very helpful in recommendations and taking into account that we were there on the weekend the Pope visited we were still able to get around without too much disruption",5,2010,11,14
37,Best 2 Night Location in Barcelona,"I am a travel agent and have the good fortune of being able to stay in some of the best hotels in the world.  In Barcelona there are a few hotels that have a bit higher rating, but none that have a better location.  It is truly the best pre or post cruise location in the city!",5,2010,11,08
37,Perfect Place to Stay in Barcelona,"I just completed a short vacation in Barcelona.  this was my first trip and I traveled alone.  I could not have chosen a better location.  It was in the middle of all of the excitement on La Rambla.  But I was given a wonderful room that was quiet so I did not hear any noise at night.  The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable.  The staff was superb. Checking in was fast and efficient.  I arrived early but they were able to get me in my room quickly.  I received great service from the concierge staff, especially Salvador.  I enjoyed the saxophone player in the bar on Friday evening.  I was assisted with getting taxis by the door staff. This will definitely be my choice for my next trip to Barcelona. Kudos, Sr. Duarte for an extremely well run hotel!",5,2010,11,06
37,Excellent location and value for money,"we stayed at the LM for 4 days, and I got it at the early bird rate at eur 157+vat. I got an inner room on the SPG floor, looking out to the back of the hotel, which suit us fine as we are light sleeper. USed the gym during my stay and I am quite impressed with the little details like disinfectant wipe. There's are enough equipment for a decent workout. We didnt eat at any of the F&B outlet in the hotel as La Ramble is just right on doorstep. there are market within walkin distance and cafe but they open late round 8am. The hotel is well maintain and room clean but compact. It has all the standard amenities which a 5 star hotel should have. ( Wait till you read my next review on Westin Paris...) Not a bad choice with proximity to the La ramblas is your concern.",4,2010,11,05
37,"Excellent, Very Happy","“The concierge and room service were exceptional, over all staff was excellent, polite and professional the hotel ambiance was beautiful as well location on la rambla excellent”",5,2010,11,05
37,"Modern, comfortable and great location","This hotel is in a superb location, a 5 minute walk to the Gothic neighborhood, Cathedral, the Boqueria Market, and Plaza Cataluna, where you have an efficient connection to the airport with Aerobus. The hotel is pretty modern with an efficient business center and very friendly and efficient staff. The room we had was one of the most spacious and comfortable of all Starwood hotels I’ve been in Europe and probably the most modern.  We had a quiet room facing the side street, not Las Ramblas. The only downside was the lobby, which lacks seating and space. I didn’t try the restaurant or breakfast as I preferred to try the excellent restaurants and the Boqueria Market nearby. 
Highly recommended!",5,2010,11,04
37,Great Location + helpful gracious staff= Expectations Exceeded,"I'll admit I was a little leary of the hotel and location after reading some reviews and was determined to stay in the passeg de gracie area having fallen in love with another hotel.  However, I had a bunch of starwood points drop into my account a few weeks before our trip and decided "" Le Meridien"" was a much better location than the ""W"" for less points.  Although our room wasn't quite ready at our arrival (post cruise for 2 nights) they secured our luggage and off we went to ride the hop on/off city tour bus. Returning to our hotel we determined after riding both routes of the city tour that our location was perfect!  Checked right in to our room on the floor assigned for starwood preferred guest, I think it was 2nd or 3rd. The reason I mention this is that any concerns I had about street noise thru the windows disappeared,  The room itself isn't huge but well layed out, with a great bath that is enclosed with a smoked glass door.  Beautiful slate, storage counter area, tv, fluffy robes etc.  We asked for ice and it was there within 5 minutes, had some issues with our tv and maintenance was there to fix it within 5 minutes. After we returned from dinner the tv would not work agian.   A manager arrived immediately and when he couldn't get it to turn on he ran down to the front desk and returned with a key for another room.  Since it was after midnight, we didn't feel like moving.  No problem,he left the key with us to decide and comped us a couple of drinks from the mini bar.  I had also locked myself out of the safe (my fault) and management agian arrived immediately. Seems like we were high maintenance right?  In my opinion, no one tried harder than this staff to please.  The concierge was very helpful in suggesting reservations and scored us a reservation with friends for dinner at Botafumeiro which was excellent.  Side note - We bought the 2 day pass for the city tour hop on/off bus, the first day we sat up top and stayed on the bus to get an overview, this is a great way to see everything.  Day 2 we returned to the must sees.  Barcelona is a beautiful city and in spite of reading many reports of pickpocket or other thefts we never felt personally threatened. Will definetly return for an longer visit to Spain.  Be a vigilant traveler and  aware of the scams as you would in any city, and you should be just fine!",4,2010,11,03
37,Over rated,"I stayed there 3 nights.  The location is right off La Rambla.  There are nice restaurants around it, especially right across the street.  Ate there 3 times. This hotel is highly rate and expensive.  The six inch mattress sat on wooden box and it was very uncomfortable.  The metro runs right under it so expect to hear it (and feel it).  Nice hotel only.  Wants to be ""the place"", but doesn't have the basics.",2,2010,10,30
37,"Location, location, location","My husband and I stayed here for one night before departing Barcelona on a cruise. 

Hotel: B-. I'll be honest, we picked this hotel because I had just enough Starwood points to get us a one-night stay. When we arrived at 10am, our room was not ready, so we were given coupons for coffees in the little cafe in the lobby. We checked our luggage with the bellman. When we eventually returned at 1pm, we were told our room was ready but there was electrical work going on in the hotel and we might not have power for a while. This was only mildly annoying for us, as we slept for much of the afternoon anyway, but it's the first time I have showered by the light of my cell phone. At some point while we were out to dinner the power came back on. I would call that sub-par for a hotel like Le Meridien. Free internet in the business center was nice since neither of us had brought our laptops.

Guest Room: A. Not huge but spacious enough. Bed was decent. Bathroom was excellent! A gigantic glass-door rainshower with dark slate tile. And I admit, I am a sucker for hotels that give me a fluffy bathrobe to wear.

Location: A+. You cannot do better than this for a location for sightseeing, and especially if you like to people-watch and eat. The hotel is on Las Ramblas about halfway between Placa Catalunya (where the tourist buses stop) and the waterfront. La Boqueria market is a five-minute walk, the Picasso museum is twenty. Other sights, especially lots of Gaudi stuff, are a 5 to 10-Euro cab ride away. 

Staff: C. The front desk seemed to be poorly staffed all the time, meaning there was one person working and always a line of three or more parties waiting. We had good service in the cafe. No one could really tell me anything about the aforementioned electricity problem, including why it was out or when it would be back on, and they didn't seem to care much either. I asked housekeeping for an extra washcloth and they brought me hand towels. We did not eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on that. The bellman who helped us with our luggage when we left took one of our rolling bags and clunked it down the steps in front of the hotel; thank goodness nothing in there was breakable. 

Overall it was an OK experience, not the level of service that I was expecting, but the location made up for some of that.",4,2010,10,26
37,Best Location in the City - Great Rooms!,"Le Méridien Barcelona is probably the hotel with the best location in all of Barcelona.  It is on “Las Ramblas” about equal distance between the Liceu and Catalunya Metro stops and just a short walk to the vibrant La Boqueria St. Josep (outdoor market).  Also, close-by is the Plaça de Catalunya & the Plaça Reial (in the Barri Gotic).
We arrived at the hotel about 9:00 am in the morning after a 12 day Mediterranean cruise.  We were able to check in at the front desk without having to wait behind other travelers.  Much to our delight, our room was ready and they let us have it immediately, instead of making us wait for check-in time.  When we got to our room (612 – 6th floor) we were delighted.  My husband used Starwood points for the room and for an additional 1,500 points per night we got a 1 bedroom suite!  The room had a very nice living room and separate bedroom, each with a TV.  The bathroom was very large, all marble, with a large separate shower & bath.  Unfortunately, there was only 1 sink in the bathroom & no drawers.  There was also an electric coffee pot, safe & minibar refrigerator in the room.  The minibar refrigerator had a very small space for guest use, just enough for 2 bottles of water.  The room was quiet as it overlooked a side street but you could see Las Ramblas from the room.  

The lobby had a small coffee counter, lots of seating & free Wi-Fi.  The concierge was helpful and was able to provide maps and other tourist information.  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant.
Aside from the great accommodations, the really big advantage to this hotel is its location.  Being so close to Las Ramblas & metro stops is priceless.  The metro makes everything so convenient, except Parc Güell.  There are 2 metro stops near the Parc, but neither take you very close, so be prepared for a long, mostly uphill walk.  I suggest that for Parc Güell, a taxi is probably the best way to get there.  If you plan on visiting La Pedrera, Casa Batlló & Casa Amatller, all are located on Passeig de Gràcia and it is a nice flat walk from the hotel (about 1 mile). 
Barcelona is a city with a lot of restaurants.  We ate at a small café right on the middle of Las Ramblas pedestrian zone & would grab a quick breakfast at one of the little small restaurants lining the street.  For dinner we mostly ate in Plaça Reial, a nice plaza area lined with restaurants with outdoor seating areas.  Great for people watching.  We ate most of our dinners at Les Quinze Nits, mostly because it was the least expensive restaurant in the Plaça.  Sangria was about €8,50 per pitcher whereas other restaurants were charging about €18.  I like my Sangria!  We went early (5:00 pm) and did not have to wait in line, but when we left, there was usually a line of 15-20 people.  The food was OK, not great, but we weren’t looking for an expensive fine dining experience, we just wanted the experience and we were fooded out from the cruise by the time we got to Barcelona.
If you are flying out from Barcelona and want to save a few Euros, take the AeroBus to the airport for only €5,05 per person.  Catch it in Plaça de Catalunya, just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  There are 2 lines, one goes to Terminal 1 & the other goes to Terminal 2.  If you don’t know which terminal you need, just tell the bus driver what airline you are flying on & he can tell you.  (We flew international to USA on US Airways & that was Terminal 1).  This express bus runs about every 10 minutes & makes 2 stops.  The entire trip took about 30 minutes.
Overall, we would DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again.   It was perfect!!!",5,2010,10,25
37,5 Star????,"We stayed for 4 days in a twin room. We ordered breakfast in our room on the first day, when it was delivered ,the room entry was too narrow  to fit the trolley in - even after they tried to move the beds!!
The entry lobby is small without adequate seating. The rooms decor and furniture need 
to be renewed. 
We have stayed in other 5 star hotels and this is definately not in that category.",3,2010,10,25
37,Comfortable modern hotel in excellent central location,"My wife and I stayed for two nights at the start of a coach tour of Northern Spain.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and well equipped.  The hotel is in an excellent location for visiting the usual tourist spots as well as shops.  Breakfast and dinner were of a high quality and the staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2010,10,24
37,"Convenient, great hotel close to Rambla","Our first trip to Barcelona. Wanted a hotel close to heart of action - this hotel fits the bill, right on the Rambla and walking distance to Gothic Quarter and waterfront. Also, Barcelona has a terrific metro system for visiting other areas.  Hotel modern, clean - very nice rooms, luxurious bathroom and shower. Staff quite accommodating to requests. We arrived early from our flight - let us use meeting room with coffee, tea, snacks, etc to store until our room was ready.  Plenty of restaurants in the area.",5,2010,10,23
37,So-So Hotel,"We stayed at the Le Meridien in early September.  As platinum Starwood members, we were upgraded to a suite.  The room had a large balcony with an L-shaped sectional, but the room itself was mediocre at best.  I believe it must have been on an unrenovated floor.  The carpet was stained and the furniture was old.  The best part of the hotel was its location.  It is located right in the center of La Rambla.  Next time, however, I think I will stay at the new W or somewhere near the Passeig de Gracia.",3,2010,10,13
37,"Nice hotel, good location for tourists, questionable service levels","LOCATION:
If this is your first time to Barcelona (or you just like being in the middle of all the action), then this hotel has a splendid location.  It's smack in the middle of La Rambla - while we didn't really do much on Rambla besides walk up and down once, it was quite centrally located for the other things that we did do.  E.g. just across the road from hotel is the Gothic Quarter area, a much more quaint part of town. A 5 min walk down La Rambla and you hit the port. Passeig de Gracia (high end shopping) is a 5-10 min walk away.  The trendy El Born district is also about a 10 min walk from the hotel.

FOOD OPTIONS:
Our room came with breakfast... which was a croissant, coffee and juice.  Forget the elaborate buffet breakfasts that you get from 5-star hotels in Asia.  The hotel's restaurant didn't look very enticing either.  But that wasn't what we were looking for anyway.  Within a 10min walking radius, there are plenty of excellent tapas bars.  The market, La Boqueria, is also just a few minutes walk away (there are some good restaurants around the fringe of the market, cooking up fresh produce from the market).  If not, the hotel's concierge was very helpful in recommending good restaurants.  Just outside the hotel, there are a couple cafes/restaurants which are pretty decent.  Don't go to the Bar Lobo across the street though - the guy in charge of seating guests lacks all sense of customer service and was very rude.

ROOMS:
Rooms are decent sized, beds are comfortable.  There's a rainshower plus a handheld showerhead in the bathroom which was great!!  If your room faces La Rambla, I think you get a balcony overlooking the street, but it'll be very noisy (probably into the wee hours of the morning).  We asked for a non-Rambla facing room and it was very quiet.

FACILITIES:
There's an attached carpark.  Didn't use anything else.  There is a spa, but when I went up to the spa floor, it didn't look that great, nothing special.  There's also a small rooftop deck that you can sit on deck chairs and overlook part of the city.  It's very very small though.  Nothing else up there besides a handful of deckchairs.

SERVICE:
Ah hahhh.... if everything goes smoothly on your trip, then you have nothing to worry about as the hotel's staff are friendly enough.  But a hotel's service level is truly shown when things go wrong for a guest and they have to handle that.  Several things went wrong on our trip:
1) Problem #1 with the room key cards - you can't put them near magnets or they'll be demagnetized.  Ok, that's fine, who carries magnets in their pockets anyway.  Oh, but these cards will also be demagnetized by a credit card!  now, that I carry with me in my pockets.  So essentially, these key cards are extremely sensitive so you have to be careful where you keep them.  Small issue anyway, not holding this against the hotel.  Just telling you so you know.
2) Problem #2 with the room key cards - we had two sets of reservations but for a consecutive stretch of days (in the same room).  Now, at the end of the first reservation period (day 2), our key cards stopped working!  We were very annoyed as this happened right after the first incident with our first set of key cards being demagnetized.  The hotel apologized as they should have seen that we were staying in the same room (but but under a different reservation number) and not due to check out for another 3 days!  This type of slip up should not be seen in a 5-star hotel.
3) Internet problems - our room came with internet but it wasn't working.  The service guy couldn't fix it.  The manager couldn't fix it.  No one seemed to be able to troubleshoot the problem.  And my husband NEEDED the internet to finish up some urgent work.  The hotel manager's solution?  ""I'm sorry sir, there's nothing we can do"" and the ""solution"" to the guest's inconvenience is to placate him with a bottle of wine or some vouchers, which we did not take as it doesn't solve the problem that I still need the internet!  Common sense service would have been to offer the guest complimentary access to the business center.  Or if there's no business center, allow the guest to use the internet access ID from a vacant room.  Or if that's not possible, tell the guest where the nearest internet cafe is and offer to pay for an hour or two of internet access there!!  THAT would have been good customer service!  But NONE of these solutions were offered by the hotel.  It was just, oh well I can't fix your room's internet connection, I'm sorry.
4) Concierge booked us for lunch at a really popular restaurant.  When we went there, the restaurant was CLOSED!!  When we asked the concierge later, he apologized as he did not actually call the restaurant ahead of time to confirm our booking (it looked like it was an online booking system).  When he found out the restaurant was closed, it was too late and we were already gone.  He did not bother calling us to inform us, though we gave our cell phone number to him.  He did apologize later when we returned to the hotel and offer a complimentary bottle of wine.  Seems to be the hotels answer to every problem.

All in all, very questionable customer service skills when things go wrong.  If nothing goes wrong, then you're ok.  We've stayed in many 5 star hotels and the level of service we received at Le Meridien in Barcelona pales in comparison to some of the other top notch hotel chains.  The staff are really quite nice and friendly, I'm not saying the service is horrible, but it's certainly not up to par and they don't go the extra mile that you'd expect from a 5-star hotel.",4,2010,10,13
37,Good Stay and Friendly Staff,"The stay was very good. We looked at a couple of rooms as the first couple we looked at needed a little updating and smelled of smoke (not the hotels fault). We got a very nice room in the end. The staff was very friendly and very honest. My Mom was washing her hands after breakfast and took off her wedding ring and the maid put it safely aside for her. 
The breakfast was also very good but slow to be refilled. It was a nice way to start the day with everything you could want. 
We also had dinner at the restaurant downstairs and it was fabulous. Great service and great menu choices. 
Overall it was a very good stay and I appreciate the hotel staff.",4,2010,10,05
37,"Location, Location, Location!!!","Check-in was quick and the lady at the desk, knowing that it was my first time to Barcelona, whipped out all the maps and pamphlets in her arsenal for my use. The room was a tad small but extremely functional. The location however was second to none. It is right along Las Ramblas and very convenient to the metro stations. It is also next to a supermarket convenient for daily needs.

The location is worth its daily rate and I would not recommend any other hotel.",4,2010,10,05
37,Best Location!,"If you want to immerse yourself in the center of Barcelona,  go with the Le Meridien Barcelona on the La Rambla.  I always book a La Rambla view and even though somewhat noisy with windows opened you cannot experience a more vibrant part of the city,  and I am talking 24/7. 
The Le Meridien is close to everything.  As far as the hotel is concerned,  it has a contemporary flare.  Rooms are on the small size, but very well featured. 
Also try the Breakfast Buffet.  It is well worth it.  The staff is accommodating and professional.  You may pay a view extra dollars to stay on the La Rambla cannot beat the Le Meridien's location.",4,2010,10,02
37,A comfortable stay in a luxurious hotel,"As everyone says, the hotel's location is perfect, right on Las Ramblas and an easy walk to El Raval, Barrio Gotic, Port Vell, Plaza Catalunya, the University, etc. But there are a lot of other hotels in his neighborhood, and what set Le Meridien apart from the others was the luxury. The bed is the most comfortable bed we've ever slept on (and maybe we felt this way even more so because the hotels we stayed in other cities in Spain had really uncomfortable beds). I can see why people might think the rooms are small, but it was spacious enough for 2 people, and I am pretty sure the room was bigger than the Meridien rooms in NYC. The bathroom was big, and the rainshower was a treat, along with a small flatscreen in the bathroom to go with the 42"" flat screen in the bedroom. We also very much appreciated all the storage areas and the soundproofing of the rooms. 

We were busy eating and drinking elsewhere so did not get to try out our hotel bar until the last night of our stay, but I highly recommend it. I had a great glass of Chardonnay for EUR 5, which is cheaper than a big glass of beer at other bars along Ramblas. 

The hotel also has a small computer room with 3 computers and a printer in the basement. I used it to check in on line and print boarding passes, and it was very convenient. The hotel also gave us 2 passes to the modern art museum nearby and a coupon for 2 coffees at the hotel coffee bar, which I thought was very nice.

The only two negative things about our stay here were:
1. the bath tub did not drain very well. Sometimes we were showering with our feet in soapy water.
2. the concierge is always busy with other customers or not at the desk. 

Overall, we absolutely loved our hotel room and feel that the hotel was an integral part of the fantastic time we had in Barcelona.",5,2010,09,27
37,Nice Hotel,"Great location, right off Las Ramblas. Room was fine by european standards, little small but with great bathroom with what seemed like stone walls and floor. Carpet a little worn. Helpfulness and friendliness of staff spotty. Had 3 bags with me when i arrived and struggled up the steps to the hotel which has a revolving door in the middle and 2 large doors on each side. since i was dragging bags thought it would be easier to go in the door vs. revolving door, but it only opened from inside. Tried several times to open it while a uniformed hotel employee just stood inside it watching me, so gave up and managed to get in revolving door by myself. Arrived in small crowed lobby around 11;00 am and room not ready (check in time was 2:00) so stored luggage and went out. Came back at 2:00, and checked in anxious to go back out, they said they would bring bags up to room. Waited 45 or 50 minutes and went down and got them myself. There was no one in Lobby at time, maybe siesta time? Expected more from hotel in this price range. Nice computer room in basement.",3,2010,09,18
37,Great location from which to explore the rest of the city,"Although La Rambla is one of the less interesting parts of Barcelona - a crowded pedestrian mall - the location is central, making Le Meridien a great location from which to see the city.

The hotel has very good amenities.  The lobby overlooks a side street and therefore is a bit quieter.  I stayed on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor and thought the rooms were great: modern amenities, relatively spacious, and very quiet (I never heard noises from the neighboring rooms).  The gym facility downstairs has a sufficient number of treadmills and a multi-purpose weight machine which works fine.  There are also some computers adjacent to the gym, at no cost.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, and came up with some great restaurant suggestions.

Overall, a very pleasant stay.",4,2010,09,17
37,Great Location for a stay in Barcelona!,"We stayed for 6 nights and had a great time. We were quoted a price by our travel agent however were fortunate to secure an internet deal/rate at half the price, including flights so make sure you check before booking!
Location of this hotel is fabulous for sightseeing in Barcelona - middle of La Rambla, great if you return late. 
We used the underground/trains and took trips to Girona, Monserrat - the concierge staff were very helpful at all times, even to checking what time the Barcelona/AC Milan matched kicked off to ensure we arrived in time.
Good sized room, brilliant bathroom - we loved the shower! TV/phone in the bathroom, use of robes.
Small downstairs bar which was pleasant for late drinks (we recommend the Catalan wine)
Free internet access in the small computer suite downstairs, complimentary coffee in the coffee bar and complimentary ticket to MACBA
If I could get the same deal again I would definitely return.",4,2010,09,04
37,Good Location Is The Best Feature,"This hotel is considered a 5-star hotel, but I would say it is more like a 4-star.  The location is the best feature of the hotel - in the heart of Las Ramblas.  The concierge's desk was very helpful and made some good recommendations. We requested a quite room since we have a toddler and the staff accommodated us. Overall, the hotel is clean and the staff is helpful.  Be warned that the hotel lobby is very small and tends to be crowded since there is no free wi-fi in the rooms (only in the lobby or in the business center).   Considering the cost of the hotel and the size of the lobby, free wi-fi in the rooms should be included.",4,2010,09,03
37,did not get my moneys worth,"I recently returned from this Barcelona after staying here for 2 nights. I booked on a family package wich included the meditererean sutie, fruit tray, chcolate lollipops for my toddler and comp breakfast. Upon check in the reception did not have any of the detials and kept telling me breakfast was not included. I checked in and returned downstairs with my paperwork and she apologized. However, we never got the chocolates, and were handed a bowl with an apple and an orange, our fruit tray ?? needless to say we will not be returning.",3,2010,08,28
37,Very nice,"Everything was really nice,  I have to recommend the hotel restaurant it is really good.",5,2010,08,24
37,Good Central Location with Comfortable Rooms,"Hotel has an interesting location. On the one hand, it is central to all of Barcelona and the sights, however, it is also next to La Rambla, which to me is the worst part of Barcelona. If you do not mind being next to a crazy, smelly, crowded pedestrian boulevard, then it will work for you. I would stay there again, just because I could not determine a better location while visiting around. Also, there are some great restaurants nearby and across the street. 

Rooms are nothing special but comfortable. It seems the hotel is just about in need of a renovation, the floor carpeting and room furniture are starting to appear worn. I believe this is due to the high traffic in and out of the hotel, especially on weekends. I noticed many groups coming and going, and a Lufthansa crew seemed to be regularly arriving and departing.

The restaurant was actually a surprise, with quality food at a reasonable cost. The breakfast buffet was also very good.

The service from the front desk and restaurant was excellent. My only complaint would be the fact that there was usually only one concierge available. It is a much too busy and large hotel for only one concierge. I usually had to wait 10-20 minutes for the concierge to free up, which was disappointing.",4,2010,08,18
37,Great location!,"We stayed one night at Le Meridien.  following our Oceania cruise.  The hotel is well situated on Las Ramblas, the main boulevard and within walking distance to major sites.  The rooms are small, but well appointed.  The bathroom is large with a rain shower (great pressure), bath robes, slippers and large bath towels.  The mini bar cupboard was not properly cleaned as we found lots of crumbs when we open the door.  Other than that, the hotel and room were clean.  The concierge was very helpful.  I strongly recommend a private walking tour of Barcelona as the streets are quite circuitous and it's somewhat difficult to navigate your way through the narrow lanes and squares.  We used Hi This is Barcelona.  Our guide Christina was terrific.  We enjoyed a three hour walking tour (also included use of the metro) and a delicious tapas meal at a restaurant that the locals enjoy.   The food was great.  Christina called ahead and our freshly made paella was ready just minutes after we arrived.  The owner of Hi This is Barcelona suggested the restaurant Montiel for dinner.  It's located on a little alley near the Picasso museum.  The restaurant is small and smells a little fishy when you first walk in.  This is likely because they have fresh fish on display in a refrigerated case.   We almost left at that point but decided to at least have a drink and a couple of appetizers.  Thank goodness we stayed because we enjoyed the best meal of our 12 day trip.  We selected the tasting menu which included fish, ravioli, beef, seafood, and more.  It was absolutely delicious!  Other diners were equally as complementary about their meals as well.  For 45 euros each it was also cheap.",4,2010,08,16
37,Can't be the location/city and good hotel,"Stayed in Barcelona for a last minute weekend. Room rates however at the hotel are and were high partly due to the Music Festival. Great location direcly on La Rambla with many tapas bars, good restaurants and breakfast loactions within 50m so no need to even  consider the hotel restaurant unless you need food at 3am in bed ! Check-in was a night mare as we arrived at 1200hrs as everyone was checking out and is seemed as though it was the firstd ay for all the maybe 15 staff running around in reception..very unprofessional !! However that said we left our luggage and went to enjoy the city..later returning to a great room on the 2nd floor with two balconies over La Rambla...perfect !",4,2010,08,16
37,Excellent Stay,"Booked hotel using Starwood points, so the cost of the rooms really didn't come into play.  Rooms were comfortable, not huge, very clean and had appropriate amenities (although it would have been nice if the TV broadcast in both Spanish and English, as do other hotels in Spain).  Staff was very helpful and solicitous, offring excellent meal recommendations for example.  Location is right next to Las Ramblas, which we liked, but if you are looking for a place in a quiet area, this is not the place.",4,2010,08,11
37,Comfortable rooms. Great Location,"Rooms a little on the small side, but clean and comfortable.  Great shower.  Location is fantastic - walk to everything, metro and buses close by.",5,2010,08,08
37,Expensive Average Hotel,"We stayed here for one night in July.  The rooms were clean and a good size but quite dull decor and little character.  Also the minibars in both rooms we had booked did not open.  After contacting room service, the staff managed to open them but were unable to stop them relocking everytime the door was closed.  In the end they inserted a piece of card into the minibar door so that it would not competely shut allowing us to access it.  The rooms also did not have hairdryers in them and we had to call room service who brought  hairdryers to our rooms, quite strange. Our rooms were facing on to La Rambla with a small balcony that overlooked the street.  This was very nice during the day but was very noisy all night so we didn't get much sleep. If booking this hotel I would suggest that you ask for a room that is not facing La Rambla.  We also had to pay for internet access within the hotel.

The main entrance and lounge areas were all very nicely decorated and the breakfast had a good variety of food available.

On the whole, although the staff were good, we were quite disappointed with this hotel considering the price.",3,2010,08,04
37,Rude and Will Rip You Off!,"My parents, husband and I stayed here before and after a Mediterranean cruise in July 2010. Overall opinion was a nice hotel, but definitely not worth the money if you are not staying for very long. We found the entire staff to be very rude and unfriendly, except the shuttle bus drivers. Also, they are not willing to help out with early check-in.

We read several reviews before having a travel agent book the hotel. Most reviews were good, except several mentioned they were overcharged once they got home and received their credit card statement. THIS IS TRUE!!! We prepaid for our entire trip and upon check-in they verified the prepayment of our rooms. Upon check-out, they said they could not verify our prepayment. The guy at the front desk then went behind the counter and came back and said, ""Ok everything is fine"". No, everything was not fine. My credit card was charged a very random amount and now they cannot provide an invoice to us or our travel agent. I am writing this review to warn future travelers to be careful when you check out. It is very difficult to get anyone to even get back to our travel agent. 

Be careful when checking out!!! Also, DO NOT go eat at the Attic Restaurant, which is across the street!",1,2010,08,03
37,An Exceptional and Pleasant Experience,"We stayed at the Le Meridien before taking a Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel is located on La Rambla, which is perhaps akin to a Duval Street or Bourbon Street in the US (not as many bars or drunks) but a lot of activity, vendors and good food.  We used our StarPoints for the stay.  Upon our arrival we were warmly greeted by the door man who rushed to the taxi to open the door.  Check-in was a breeze and we were immediately upgraded to two suites.  Our daughters stayed in one and we stayed in the other (actually the one in most photos were the flags are in the front of the building).  The rooms were very clean and rather roomy and modern for a European Hotel.  Great oversized towels, televisions in the bathrooms along with a phone (a man's dream), mattresses were very comfortable and plenty of pillows.  If you stay on the La Rambla side it is a little noisy but you can easily sleep.  The view is worth the noise if you like to people watch.  The hotel is equipped with double pained glass in those rooms.  There is a great restaurant within the hotel and a fun lounge.  The gym is adequate with a small universal and some additional dumbells and aerobic equipment.  There is also an adequate computer room with internet.  You get free coffee in the morning in a nice little lounge.  The concierge staff was very helpful and the staff overall is very professional, friendly and pleasant. The location is very convenient to many things including the seaport, with many attractions and a great mall with some good bars.  Checkout is simple and taxis are readily available.  If you would like to attend mass, which we did, there is a beautiful church around the corner. Best tapas we had was at Jose Luis (a short taxi ride but worth it). Nice outside seating and good wine list. The Le Meridien Barcelona is a REALl 5-star hotel.",5,2010,08,02
37,"Nice hotel, loud street","Located right on Las Ramblas, this beautiful hotel can be loud.  We had reserved two rooms, which were supposed to be connecting as we were traveling with small children.  However, the only rooms they had on the same floor were half the length of the hotel apart.  One was a suite, which the desk clerk kept insisting was one of their finest.    We did not want our children to stay in a room so far from us,  especially since their room fronted the elevator banks.   We worked out the sleeping arrangements so the children didn't sleep in a room alone, and just dealt with it.  We'd reserved one room with starwood points and the clerk said we were never guaranteed connecting rooms, despite what the SPG rep had told me when I reserved the rooms and stressed that we were traveling with small children.

The rooms were clean, modern, and spacious.  The bathtub in the suite had a faucet like a shower, so you were rained upon during your bath.  The suite also face the busy Las Ramblas, so it was very loud--think fronting Bourbon Street in New Orleans.  

Overall, despite the room snafu, I'd stay here again.  The desk clerks tried to be helpful, could tell we were exhausted after an international flight, and all the hotel employees we encountered were friendly and had very kind to our children.  The only other issue was a request to donate to UNICEF--a ""voluntary"" donation to be added to our room charge.  We declined; however on check out, it had been added to our bill.",4,2010,08,01
37,In the heart of Las Ramblas,"We stayed at the Le Meridien for six nights and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The location was fantastic, right on Las Ramblas two blocks south of Placa Catalunya and a one minute walk from the nearest Metro stop.  The Gothic Quarter and its outdoor restaurants and tapas bars are not much farther.  Even though it was on Las Ramblas, the entrance is on a side street, much quieter, and our room overlooked that same street.  We preferred that to a room overlooking Las Ramblas.  The hotel is modern in decor with kind of an Asian bent.  The music in the elevators is a trip.  Business center was in the basement and free.  The rooms were small compared to what you would expect in a luxury hotel, but standard sized by normal European standards.  The bathroom was OK sized, single sink, and the bath/shower was a very invigorating rain faucet from the ceiling.  There was a ton of storage/closet area along a wall, which could have been better used as additional room space.  Front desk staff were friendly on check in.  Service was well-intentioned but iffy in quality.  For example we asked for a pillow and got more towels (no pillow), asked for a small bed pillow and got one of their very large square pillows.  They also had trouble fixing the TV (couldn't change channels), but since we weren't watching much it wasn't a big deal.  They had a nice reasonably priced cafe off the lobby, great for coffee in the morning.  We were staying on points, and even though it was overall a very nice comfortable hotel, the point value compared to other Starwood properties we've stayed at was probably a category too high.  You're definitely paying extra for the location and to be honest, it's probably worth it.",4,2010,07,26
37,Pleasant,"The hotel is located right on La Rambla and is within walking distance to a few places of interest (Cathedral of Santa Eulalia and Picasso Museum).  It is also a few steps away from the outdoor market, which we enjoyed greatly. Also, from Barcelona Airport we took a taxi to the hotel and it cost us about 25 euros.

The hotel lobby was pleasant and has free WiFi, check in was quick and the staff (Salvador and Maria) was great. The rooms are fairly nice, although it could always be better, but definitely wasn't to a point where you couldn't stand being in your room.  Concierge was helpful when I needed assistance.  The prices for meals and drinks in the hotel were pricey as is expected in most hotels.

Overall this was a pleasant stay and we enjoyed our time here.  I would certainly recommend the hotel for those people looking to stay near La Rambla.",4,2010,07,23
37,surprising and divided opinion,"This hotel has its good points... and its bad points...
Good first:
The design of the lobby is fresh and welcoming in a modern way, a nice touch is that in the evening they turn the lights down and place out candles in the lobby. The staff is multilingual and welcoming. Check-in was swift and efficient. The room was large (we were upgraded) and the bathroom was spacious (decor was sparse but I don't mind that at all). If you are gluten intolerant they aware of what it is and they have bread for you for breakfast which is a definate positive!! The pillows are plentyfull and lovely and fluffy. Location is central in the city (if that is what you are looking for) yet, at least in our room, I heard no street noise.

Not so good:
If you are environmentally conscious or at all sensitive to temperature differences this is NOT the hotel for you. The Spanish government recommends to have airconditioning at around 24C to lessen the effect of aircon on the environment, here they have it at 21C!! This means it is cranked up to the maximum and when you come inside after having been in 35C outside it is a huge shock to the system (an unnesesary one I believe) just as it is when you come down for breakfast and you have to wear long sleeves in order not to freeze. It is nice to cool off after the extreme heat outside but this is taking it to a ridiculous level, even the staff is in long sleeves and I am not surprised. I mentioned it to reception and they said that 21C is what they are recommended to have it at... if for no other reason they should change it for the health of the guests and the environment...
If you have a bad back and don't like rock hard matresses... this is NOT the place for you, I slept on the couch on our room...
A minor peeve and yes a bit picky but the ""ambience music"" :) in the elevator is louder than a few nightclubs I have been to and I was informed that several guests have mentioned it and they are trying to get it changed.

If you are looking for a good restaurant I can recomend La Barceloneta, stunning seafood and great service and it is about €8 in a taxi to get there.

All in all an ok stay and yes I was surprised at the quality of the beds and divided opinion because I really liked the first impression when I stepped into the hotel.",3,2010,07,22
37,"Great Location, but Poorly Designed Rooms","We loved the location of the Le Meridien, but the rooms are not well designed.  The bedside lights are impossible to use for reading, and the floor lamps are not much better.  The rooms are equipped with motion lights, but ours were not working properly, and seemed to go on and off during the night for no apparent reason.  The shower is enclosed with a high wall which I was unable to climb over, and the tub bottom does not have any treatment to prevent slipping.  There are no grab bars in the shower, so unless you are young and athletic, bathing is a real problem.  We were also not fond of the glassed in bathroom.  Our sliding glass door would not close completely.  The bed and bedding were just okay.  We chose this hotel over the Hotel Arts because we preferred this location.  If we ever return to Barcelona, I would stay at the Hotel Arts, and just use taxis.",2,2010,07,12
37,Enjoyable stay in Barcelona,"Just returned from a five night stay at the Le Meridian in Barcelona.  First of all, we were immediately greeted by Jordi the bellman who welcomed us to the hotel.  The check in was very efficient and I found the staff very helpful when I needed them during my stay.  Probably Las Ramblas wouldn't be my first choice, as the area is very crowded, but there is respite when you walk thru the door. It is actually very convenient to the Metro and to many fine restaurants and shopping and site-seeing.  Barcelona is a very beautiful city and on our last evening the concierge recommended a very fine restaurant to spend our last evening, Da Greco...it was one of the highlights of the trip! I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2010,07,12
37,"Perfecto - Great service, fantastic location","Just returned from a wonderful stay in Barcelona.  I will start by saying that I am a Starwood Platimum.  I booked two rooms, was upgraded for my room to a suite with my 22 and 19 year old in an adjoining room.  another extended family member was in a room on a different floor and had the same wonderful experieinces.

Starting with Natalia Torres, the attitude at the hotel is  very much to accomodate in every way possible.  Natalia spent the time to review our intinerary, make several local suggestions and encouraged us to try everything local.  She is certainly one of the best Starwood managers i have worked with.

Location - it cant be beat.  My room was on the corner overlooking La Rambla on one side and the side street on the other.  Noise was not an issue. We were out from 8 or 9 am until 1 am every day, and if you are touring and experienceing Barcelona, this is the place to be.  convenient to WALK or METRO everywhere.  We spent three full days visiting every site imaginable and the base of Le Meridien was perfect.

Regarding the amenities at the hotel, the rooms were great, clean, very good size for Europe, very comfortable bed and I was not on a Starwood preferred floor.  As for the bar and restaurant, we spent the early evening one night in the bar watching the world cup - GO ESPANA! and had some Tapas.  Otherwise. with La Boqueria one block away and many pastry shops as well, why would anyone ever want to have breakfast at the hotel.

the concierges - i worked for several weeks via email with Borja to find restaurants that gave us the local feel and with amazing food.  He was fantastic.  Great follow up. we had dinner reservations every night and it would be hard to stack rank them as they were all good.  The other concierges were good as well, booking our travel to and from the airport and also giving directions.

Overall, i would highly recommend this hotel.  Introduce your self to Natalia or any of the managers.  As it always the case, you always receive the best service when you are friendly and open minded to the local culture.  If you want the hotel and the city to feel like you are home, dont leave the US.  If you want to immerse your self in the local area, come to Barcelona!!",5,2010,07,07
37,I left my heart in Barcelona,"I had quite a good impression from my stay here. Very friendly and efficient check-in. Room 544 came with a very large wrap-around terrace with chaise lounge. The room itself was oddly shaped, but how much time does one spend in the room in a city so fantastic as Barcelona? (Caveat: yes you can hear your neigbors from time to time; the sound proofing is not all it could be.) The coffee bar in the lobby serves delicious coffee and snacks. Did I mention the location? It could not be improved upon: Steps from the Museum of Contemporary Art, La Boqueria, Palau de la Musica Catalana,  the Barri Gotic etc. Easy walk to the Metro and many other amazing sights.",4,2010,07,06
37,Great location right off La Rambla,IF you are familiar with the Meridien hotel chain then you know that these are very nice hotels.  The rooms we had for 3 teens and 2 adults were large by European standards.  The hotel is very modern and located right in the heart of things in Barcelona.  The metro is 2 blocks away and the Rambla is steps away.  I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2010,07,05
37,Good location but no service,"My husband and I had stayed there from June 27 to July 2 after the cruise.  The location is good but with average 280+ Euro a night w/o breakfast, no turn down service, the mattress needs to be replaced.  The concierge sent us to restaurants with the wrong name and wrong address, not once but twice (he recommended 2 seafood restaurants and we could not find neither one.  After the dinner, by chance we found out that the restaurant he recommended was on the other side of the port vell, not the one he marked on our map and not the address he gave us.  Crapy!   At night, we could hear our neighbour talking.  Not a five star hotel if you asked me.  The receiptionist for the breakfast was rude when I asked to see the buffet first to see if I wanted to eat there.  At the end, we had breakfast there everyday.  The breakfast was good but same, if you want eggs to be cooked to your like, you have to wait 15 minutes for the chef to show up.  The night light systems did not work well at the first two nights so we had to shut down the whole system, then it worked after that.  We had a great time in Barcelona but will find a better hotel next time.",3,2010,07,05
37,As expected,"We stayed at the LM Barca for a couple of nights.  Found the location to be quite central, however, perhaps a bit to close to Las Ramblas and all the tourist hussle and bussle.  nevertheless, the hotel was clean, good service and comfortable.",4,2010,06,29
37,Great lobby and service.  Great bed and pillows.  Dusty and stained furniture.,"Stayed here for a week with my wife.  We got upgraded for free to a junior sweet, which was nice (thank you, Starwood card!)  

The bed and pillows were awesome.  The lobby is great, the service is perfect.  The location is excellent.  

But the desk chair was broken, the dresser/TV stand had a thick coating of dust on it, and the couch had a big nasty dark blotch on it.  

Not sure if I'd stay here again.  I might...but the furniture situation freaked me out a little.",3,2010,06,29
37,Great Stay! Great Location!,"The Le Meridien was exactly what we were looking for! Right in the heart of the La Rambla area. Being on La Rambla we thought it would have been noisier. Never heard a thing! Just about all sites were within walking distance and the ones that weren't were easy to get to and close by. Besides having a great hotel with nice, comfortable rooms, etc.  I must say the Concierge help was impressive. First off both resturants they suggested were excellent. Pla was one and the other started with a La B...I'm sure they will know the one since I've read many good reviews about it. 
The more important help they provided was the assistance we got when we had to alter our flight from BCN to Paris Orly! Without getting into it, they basically made all the calls, adjusted our transport and all with a great attitiude and pleasure in helping us! It made the trip since it could have been a nightmare if not for thier help.
I wish I oculd remember the womans name that helped us but I'm sure she knows who she is! Compliments to her and the staff at Le Meridien Barca!",5,2010,06,25
37,Fantastic!!!!,"We recently spent 4 nights at the Le Meridien Hotel in Barcelona and I can easily say that this was one of the best travel experiences that I've ever had.  This was our first time in Barcelona and, not knowing what to expect, we couldn't have been happier with all aspects of this hotel.  From check in to check out, all the staff were gracious, service orientated, and efficient.  Even though we arrived around 8:30 PM, we were greeted by a genuinely friendly and courteous front desk staff member, who took time to ensure that we knew all the aspects of the hotel, our stay, and the benefits we had with our Junior Suite.  ( In the spirit of full disclosrure, I am a Starwood Gold Memeber, and don't know if this had any bearing on the room and service we received, but if it did, everyone should join!)  She also was extremely patient with my feeble attempt to check in using my high school Spanish!  We were greeted with champagne in the lobby (which they do each night at 8:00 PM), which after long day of travel, was welcome indeed.  Our rooms were modern, spacious, comfortable and very quiet.  (We were very surprised at this as we were on the 2nd floor, and the location of the hotel is just off the Ramblas, which is the crowded, main shopping area)  The beds were very comfortable, even the pull-out that our son slept in.  The bathroom was very large and equipped with modern shower and conveniences.  We were concerned about being so close to the Ramblas when we made the reservation, but this turned out to be a great location, as there were great restaurants, shopping, attractions and people watching within easy walking distance of the hotel.  The Metro is also right there, and the easy to use bus system is a short walk from the hotel.  I can't say enough about how great our experience was.  I didn't want to leave!  We will definately be going back to Barcelona, and will most definately be staying at the Le Meridien!!!!!",5,2010,06,25
37,Location outshines the average qualities - Good base for young families,"At times the crazyness of Las Ramblas spills into the Lobby, and that is evident with the amount of traffic the hotel sees.  It appears to be an aged property that is going thru some remodeling but that was not evident in our guest room.  The location is phenomenal bordered by some of the top TA properties (Montecarlo and 1898) and smack in the middle of the Las Ramblas.  It served as a great base for us with our toddler as we were able to zip in and out of the sights and make it back for nap time.  Other positives include my experience prior to check in and the check in itself.  We had made several requests via Reservations (Amaia) who was extremely responsive and attentive to our requests.  At check-in (Natalya) was also very helpful and upgraded us based on our SPG status.  We were also quite impressed with the breakfast spread and the hot / custom breakfast options (omelets, crepes, and etc).  

As for the downside, we were quite disappointed with the Concierge.  On two occasions I found the Concierge desk empty around 6pm.  When I finally got a hold of them, I couldn't get a solid answer on any recommendations for ""outdoor dining that is toddler friendly"".  The only suggestion was a restaurant across from the hotel that had limited seating on a narrow sidewalk (did not look appealing!).  Finally, the hotel does rumble a bit with the ongoing Metro that runs underneath the hotel.  It didnt wake us up by you definitely sense it during the day.",4,2010,06,21
37,"Nice Hotel, Average Service.","We stay at this hotel for 2 nights as a post cruise hotel.  It’s 15 minutes from the pier, just off of Las Ramblas.  The hotel was nice.  Our room was nice, clean, and comfortable.  The only problem we had was a discrepancy regarding internet access.  The website clearly stated that the room came with internet access.  The manager proceed to tell us there was only complimentary access in the lobby or bar, but not in the rooms.  She made some claim that “they” don’t have anything to do with the website.  Later that day, my husband and I went to the bar, so I grabbed my computer.  I was given directions on how to access it.  When we got back to our room, I realized I was still picking up the Wi-Fi signal.  Yes!!!  It was divine justice.  The point here is that, don’t you pay for the Wi-Fi.  Go the bar, get the access codes.  The codes were good the entire time of our stay.",4,2010,06,17
37,Perfect Location!  Great experience!,"I visited Barcelona for one week with a girl friend of mine and the Le Meridien was the perfect location for us.  Right on Las Ramblas, it was easy to walk to the shops and the farmer's market down the street.  If, no WHEN, I got back to Barcelona, I'd stay at Le Meridien again for the location was perfect for us.  

A little about the hotel:  Before I booked the room, I registered to be a Starwood Preferred Guest.  When we got to this hotel, they actually put us in a Preferred Guest floor that had fresh fruit every day and bottled water that we LOVED!  The room was nicely sized.  We did meet a couple who had a room that wasn't renovated and had some complaints...something we thought weird b/c we had such a good experience.

For 2 nights we spent the night in the hotel bar and really enjoyed it there.  It wasn't that crowded and we met a few other visitors and got to share our stories about ""what to do"" in Barcelona.  Lots of fun.  :)

If you see my Madrid review, you'll see that I LOVED the staff in ME Madrid.  The staff at Le Meridien weren't as amazing as ME, but they did their job and provided us with good recommendations to restaurants.  Also, when they booked a Flemenco show for us (which was great! even though I was skeptical at the ""touristy"" aspect of it), we got really good seats--I think b/c of the concierge booking it.

Overall, I loved it and would stay again!!!",4,2010,06,14
37,enjoyed every bit of stay,"Got to the hotel at 2 pm. Room was not ready. Got coupon for  drinks at the bar while the room was being cleaned. Took 15 mins. Cristian at the reception was very polite and friendly. Being a Starwood Gold member got upgraded to a room overlooking La Rambla. Room was very nice and clean. A little noisy at night because of activity on La Rambla, but did not disturb sleep. My wife needs special meals due to health reasons. They had no problem accomodating her needs. Service was great. Check out was painless. Isabelle was great during the check out process. Will definitely stay at this hotel in future.",5,2010,06,13
37,Modern/Urban Hotel Right on Las Ramblas,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband in June and were overall very pleased with the hotel.  We were given room 420 -- the 2nd and 4th floors are  ""SPG Floors"".   I didn't really know what that meant, but it was a non-smoking floor, which was great. The hotel was renovated a few years ago, and looking at the other TripAdvisor photos, it looks like there are renovated & non-renovated rooms.  Luckily we got a fully renovated room, which was modern, decent sized, and very well-designed from a layout perspective.  We slept very well here - the bed was comfortable, the curtains were complete blackout curtains, and the sleep area was separated from the hallway by the bathroom, so there was no hallway noise - perfect!  We had a room facing the main entrance of the hotel (on a side street), so there wasn't too much road noise. 

The location is very convenient (although very touristy) -- right on Las Ramblas, steps from the Catalunya metro stop, and walking distance of the Barri Gotic (Old City).  There is a nice Illy Cafe in the lobby, and a Starbucks around the corner.  The only downside about the location is that best restaurants are not right in the area, so you either have to travel or eat at a touristy place.  The restaurant in the hotel (Cent Onze) is okay -- they try to do avant-garde cuisine, but their attempts are average -- the food looked beautiful, but tasted only okay.  

My only real complaint with the hotel is the service.  Be prepared for very long wait times -- the front desk only had 2 people, so check-in and check-out took forever.  The concierge also has very long wait times and the service was below par.  They booked a wine tasting excursion for us, which was a disaster.  The car booking was not confirmed, so we were an hour delayed, they quoted the wrong price, and they misjudged the time needed at each winery.  One other minor complaint was that there was no pool or nice spa -- I had an average massage at the ""spa"", which was really 2 treatment rooms and a sun terrace.  

Overall, I would stay here again and recommend to friends.",4,2010,06,12
37,Friendly staff that went up and above,"I really enjoyed my stay @ Le Meridien.  The staff was extremely courteous from the moment I arrived.  I initially had an issue with my room due to noise, but the front desk was able to move me immediately despite the hotel being near capacity.  The concierge staff was courteous and helpful.  They were able to recommend flamenco dances and good paella in the area.  The wait staff was great as well, helping us with our luggage as soon as we arrived and loading our luggage during our departure despite the fact it was 4 am in the morning.

Also located in a great spot!",5,2010,06,08
37,Not a 5-Star Hotel,"We spent three night at this hotel in May - 2010 and found it to be overwhelmingly disappointing.  Upon check-in, the staff a) didn't know what he was doing and it took over 30-minutes to check us in (the first time) and b) lied to us point-blank and sent us to 3 rooms before we finally just stayed put because we were sick of having to go downstairs.  The first room smelled distinctly of vomit so we went back to the front desk, the next room had 2 twin beds (we booked a King Room) and the third room was smaller than either of the first two we were shown and gloriously overlooked mechanical equipment.  Completely unacceptable for the class and price of this hotel (not to mention we are both Starwood GOLD members and should technically have received a free upgrade).  I also should mention that after we declined the first room, we were told that the hotel was COMPLETEY sold out.  Ironically, we watched a group of flight attendants & pilots check-in hours after us not to mention several other groups.  The hotel was very obviously not sold out and we were lied to - point blank.  The carpet in the rooms is very worn and dated.  The bathrooms are very nice and are really the only part of the hotel that can be considered 5-star.  

I should also mention that the staff was overwhelmingly unfriendly (bellmen and front desk did not greet us once during our 3-day stay which included several entrances and exits through the lobby).  

When we used the business center downstairs, the printer was out of paper and the staff didn't know how to refill the printer.  We also had a reading light over the bed explode on us one evening blowing out the electricity in the entire room.  

The concierge was the only person who seemed to have a personality and know what he was doing - he recommended excellent restaurants.  The location is great, but I would NEVER recommend anyone to pay the prices they charge to stay at this hotel to be treated like dirt (and we didn't even pay, we used points).",1,2010,06,04
37,"Great Location, Great Service","My partner and I spent 5 nights at le Meridien for a short vacation in mid May and highly recommend the hotel.  I am an SPG member and we used SPG points for our stay.

The location is wonderful (as others have pointed out).  Our room was on the smaller side, but it's important to remember that hotel rooms in Europe are, in general, smaller than in the US.  Although small, it was fine for our stay.  Our room faced las Ramblas and was very noisy at night.  Because we were on vacation, this didn't bother us.  If I were staying for business, I would have asked for a room on the other side of the hotel.

We found service to be excellent.  The Concierge service (Salvador in particular, but all the staff were good) provided good recommendations for food and helped us rent a car on spur of the moment.  Jordi and Pablo among the door / bell staff were also very helpful.  Finally, Anita in the restaurant stood out for her personality and service.

All in all, we would recommend this property to others who want a full service hotel in a good location.",4,2010,06,01
37,Le Meridien Barcelona was wonderful,"We stayed at the Le Meridian (Barcelona) and it was wonderful. The location is favorable to touring all the sights, and the staff was very pleasant and professional, especially the Front Office Manager, Natalia Torres, who made us feel at home, and personally greeted us with a glass of Cava each evening before we went out to dinner. The hotel is lovely, clean, and the rooms were very good. Excellent hotel and location for viviting the city.",5,2010,05,30
37,Good Location but disappointing...,"I stayed at Le Meridien as a pre and post cruise hotel.. I want to be fair but it is hard given the prices they charge and the reputation that preceeds them..I do not believe it was worth the money for what was given in return..I would consider it average.. I requested an early check in by email 3 months prior and received from the general manager a response that said it was possible..Of course when you arrive, not only that it cant be done the lobby, is so small and overpacked with people that people had to sit on the floor..but they will give you a coupon for a free coffee at their ""coffee bar"" ..too small to even make a joke about it.. My package deal came with breakfast at the hotels's only restaurant  Cent Onze..I had the food for breakfast and tried once for dinner and it was terrible..The staff behind the front desk are quite young, none looked over 25, and can be quite curt..Although not with myself I observed them treat elderly guests that way.. The room is decent size for a european hotel but you can see it is beginning to wear..The bathroom is the nicest part of the room !! The bright spots are the location..Central to most everything..Unless the Barcelona soccer team wins a match then the rambla is a zoo...And a particluar employee must be given an honorable mention..Juan the bellman..He helped me with a cab driver who tried to overcharge me by double the price..My spanish is good but not enough to argue when Im being duped... the cab fare from the port with only 2 pieces of luggage should only be approx 15 euros..He tried to rip me off for 31 euros..Juan argued on my behalf and I paid what was the metered price..Kudos to Juan !!! Like I said..Nice but not worth the price..Dont know if I would recommend this hotel to anyone....",3,2010,05,22
37,"Great location, Disappointing Stay","I booked 5 (pricey) nights at this hotel. I departed after 3 nights and would have departed after the first night but Barcelona hotels were booked solid for that particular weekend. The lobby is modern and - at least when I was there - somewhat chaotic, with many people trying to get the attention of the limited staff. I was offered an upgrade, including breakfast for an additional 165 euros per night (more than $1,000 for 5 breakfasts!). I turned it down.  Despite being an SPG member I was assigned a room on a non-SPG floor, one busy with flight attendants. This was not the biggest problem. That would be the bed. It was so old and worn I would have tossed it long ago. Hardly the Sweet-Sleeper of the corporate ads.  The room lighting was difficult to read by. The bathroom was very nicely appointed, with a rain head shower and thick towels. Unfortunately, it did not come with either soap or bath gel until I requested them. In sum, this hotel was a major disappointment.",3,2010,05,21
37,Excellent hotel,"We were disappointed with our first hotel choice and forced to relocate when they would not take care of the problems.  This hotel, though quite expensive, was worth every penny - clean, spacious, nice bath-shower, in room iron (a rarity in Spain).  The only disappointment was no free wifi in the room which should have been included considering the cost of the room.  There was free wifi in the lobby.  There is always some street noise along the Ramblas, but they did dampen it quite a bit.  We were happy to be here.",5,2010,05,20
37,A calm oasis in the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas,"When booking our trip to Barcelona we had not wanted to stay near to Las Ramblas due to its reputation as the centre of petty crime during the evenings and being very touristy. Our friends wanted to be near Las Ramblas so we looked for a convenient 5 star hotel and came up with Le Meridien. Thank goodness.... It is on a lovely calm street off the main road, and has charming square opposite to the right with a selection of cafes and small eateries. Outside the hotel it is busy and noisy, but once you enter the lobby you can feel calmness restored. Very trendy rooms, recently upgraded, latest technology, small, but usual City hotel size. Extremely comfortable bed. Would recommend to stay......",5,2010,05,19
37,Loved our stay at the Le Meridien,"I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel. Upon check-in, the gentleman upgraded us since I was a SPG member. The room he offered was only on the 1st floor, but he said he could uprade us to a suite on the 8th floor at a cost of 50 euro/night but would include breakfast, which was already 25 euro. Total no-brainer. We went for the upgrade and were so glad we did. The room was so nice and spacious! Even though it wasn't one of the newly remodled rooms, it still suited us just fine. The bed was comfortable. The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. The blackout blinds were great for our siestas. And, the location cannot be beat! We were less than a 5-minute walk to Boqueria and right in the middle of all the action on La Rambla. I would definitely recommend this hotel for visitors to Barcelona.",5,2010,05,17
37,"Great Stay, Little to Complain About..","We stayed at Le Meridien for 4 nights in a classic room which we booked through the hotel, online, and got a great deal. The room was small but very clean and well furnished, with a spectacular bed. The bathroom was very spacious and the shower (rain) was very refreshing.
The location is perfect, right on la Rambla, everything old and most new is within a walking distance. We took a bus tour of the city which was very informative.
We arrived early and went straight to the restaurant to have breakfast. We were offered a package deal that would save us some money. We went for it. There was a little confusion at the front desk about that, but it was resolved a day or two later. The breakfast buffet was good; they do need more vegetables though..
All in all, a great hotel. I recommend it.",4,2010,05,01
37,Great service and fantastic location,"Hotel: 
Le Meridien is a 5-star hotel. There is no pool, but they do offer the use of one in a different location. We didn´t take advantage of this though. 
Seems to be quite newly renovated in a nice contemporary style. 
Internet doesn´t come for free (an understatement at 19 euro/day PER computer), but the wireless connection and speed is excellent. And if you can be bothered they do offer wifi for free down in the lobby.

Location: 
The hotel is literally located right off La Rambla. In fact some of the rooms face that street directly. Our room was towards a quiet sidestreet. I´m sure La Rambla would provide great entertainment for the eyes, not so sure about the ears... It´s close enough to walk to some great high end shopping (5-10 min´s) in one direction, and a brisk walk (20 min´s) down to the harbour with all that it has to offer of entertainment, shopping and restaurants..
The metro and a pretty decent convenient store is located very nearby which came in handy. A few minutes down the street on the right hand side you´ll find a terrific market, a must do.

Room: 
As per usual we visited 3 suites before settling down in suite nr 546. Now this is in fact a smoking room, but it doesn´t smell like anyone has ever smoked in here!
A lot of the rooms seem to have a layout that is unique to them, so visits are recommended. That said, all 3 suites were great, so it´s just a matter of personal taste. I found the rooms to be very large by European standards, the same went for the beds. The bathroom was positively huge, with a fantastic rainshower. We also had a very large terrace which was lovely to relax on and enjoy the city views. There is a huge walk-in closet with ample space to hang both clothes and store suitcases.
One thing about the rooms and their lighting though. They have these motion sensors that kick in at night and turn on lights in the bathroom/toilet. Now we were not fans of this, but if you feel the same don´t worry as maintenance can come and swith them off easily! The reading lights are also not great, wobbly LCD lights + the pillows could have had more substance to them.

Staff: 
Smooth check-in and excellent Bellman services. They were very nice in order to accomodate our wish to visit other rooms. And very fast to bring the luggage around. Housekeeping were also very fast with bringing, and assembling the cot for our toddler (not sure what previous reviewers are complaining about as there is no cost for it). The cleaning of the room was spot on with excellent cleaning and turndown service. The room we finally chose had unfortunately 2 twinbeds, but they offered themselves to make them into 1 bed, very nice and surprisingly comfortable.
In fact, the staff throughout the hotel are very friendly and good at what they do. They certainly have that extra touch that make you feel special and cared for. 
I would like to mention Bruno and Nina a little bit extra!

Food: 
There is a nice buffet style breakfast. Not huge, but of good quality and selection. The times we had lunch there the food was good. And the service once again really friendly and efficent.

Details that matter: 
They really do scent the lobby in the most wonderful way. Interesting art works throughout the hotels + such a neat little detail as that the elevators, instead of having music, has the most quirky little different sounds in them such as water draing from a tub. Fun art installation!
We were asked by Bruno if the toddler liked chocolate upon leaving the hotel one night. I answered yes to which he replied that he would make sure that some was sent to the room. So upon our return we were greeted not only by some delish chocolates, but also a nice bottled of chilled Cava. Nice touch!
Overall it´s a really friendly city/hotel to visit with a small child (2 year old). 
They also made the toddlers bed everyday, which most hotels don´t bother with.

Things to think about: 
The Spanish hours are a little bit delayed to what most of us are used to. So please do take note that most restaurants don´t start serving lunch until 1300 or 1330. Dinner in a lot of places doesn´t happen until after 2000. And even the museums are a bit slow in the start with, for instance, the Modern museum not opening their doors until 1100 on a weekday. Just food for thought.

ETA:
We were supposed to have stayed from the 12th to the 19th, but due to the unforseen events caused by the Icelandic volcano we ended up staying here until the 22nd. The hotel were most accomodation, caring and helpful!",5,2010,04,21
37,"Good hotel, GREAT location","The hotel lobby was nice, free internet was good in business center.  Rooms were ok - not great.  a bit overpriced.  we got an upgrade because i have a convention i look for sites for...  but still just an average hotel i think.  food was not good.",3,2010,04,21
37,In The Middle Of Everything,"In March 2010, we spent 8 days in Barcelona.  Four days at Le Meridien and 4 days at W Barcelona.  Both, great hotels, but despite the usual smaller rooms that come with an inner-city hotel, the Le Meridien had some major benefits to offset that minor down-side.  Being directly on La Rambla, we had direct access to the most visited street in Barcelona with all of its vendors, entertainers, outdoor restaurants and historical sites easily within walking distance.  Every morning I would wake up and walk the 3 blocks to the Boqueria market to get fresh fruit, bread and juices for breakfast.  There were some amazing Tapas bars with Cava (sparkling wine) close by.  We walked through the thoroughly fascinating alleyways of the Gothic district to a Mass at the Cathedral.  The hotel was only blocks away from Plaza Catalunya where you can catch tour buses, metro buses and the subway.  The Hotel itself was very enjoyable.  Again, while the room was somewhat smaller than you might find in newer hotels, it was plenty large for us and had a wonderful view of the neighborhood surrounding the hotel.  We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night and felt that it was entirely up to expectations.  While there was no pool and only a small workout room, we walked the La Rambla, Gothic district so extensively that any other workout was hardly necessary.  Barcelona is a beautiful, clean city.  Le Meridien is place right in the middle of it and provided us with a wonderful experience.",5,2010,04,20
37,"Good Location, Decent Hotel",We stayed at this hotel during Easter Break. The location of the hotel was very good. It is walking distance from some of the major attractions and a short taxi ride from the rest. There are very good restaurants around the area. The hotel met our expectations.,4,2010,04,20
37,Excellent stay,"We selected Le Meridien Rambla on the basis of its central location and various Internet reviews. And we were not disappointed. We took the airport bus to the centre of the town at the Plaza Catalunya and in less than 5 minutes we had rolled our luggage to the hotel. A taxi would have taken longer. Even though it was very early in the day our room was ready. Excellent room. Everything perfect, even the pillows! And we ARE fussy when it comes to pillows and always travel with our own. This was the first hotel where we did not use ours! 

We do not need the spa or a swimming pool - something critizized by some reviewers. Also we cannot join in the critique on the staff made by some visitors. We only had the best support.

And, as a great surprise we found in our room a magnifient chocolate cake, a bottle of champagne (which we did exchange, without problem, for a bottle of red wine) with a lovely note from the management congratulating me on my 80th birthday.

Summary: All perfect. And on the ""downside""? Well, the bathroom scale showed both of us to be the same weight. Each of us weighed 188.8 kilos!!! What bugged us was the constant ""noise"" (a.k.a. background music) in the public areas. And that background runs usually at disco level, even at breakfast you are bombarded with it. We did ask to have it turned down, well... a couple of decibels.

A final grudge: Breakfast is € 25 while full dinner is € 15!!!! Guess they do this for marketing reasons, this way they can show a lower room rate and they assume that most people will ""eat out"" of the hotel at dinner time. 

We would still go back there anytime.",5,2010,04,16
37,"Great Location, great service","Being on Las Ramblas is a great location.  The staff was incredibly helpful.  The rooms were small, but very comfortable.  The bathroom was large and beautiful.",5,2010,04,13
37,Great stay,"Not fabulous, most depending on the lack of pool and a better fitness center, but over all a great stay. The staff was as good as they can be, the service splendid at the location superior. Loved it.",5,2010,04,08
37,Safe Bet in a great location,"This is my second stay in this hotel and I have to say I really like staying at this hotel.  I'm one that looks around a lot to find value but there's something about Barcelona that just seems to make that difficult.   As I walk around and see some of the places i reviewed in Expedia, I never say I wish i stayed there.  I'm an experienced traveler with 4 business trips a year to  Europe, but until you been to Barcelona you can't appreciate how difficult it can be.  That's why I like the Meriden so much, it's an extremly safe bet.  The room is always clean, the bathroom is amazing with a great shower.   Sure the basic rooms are small but I find it extremely functional.   It's a modern look but it all seems to work.   US Travelers to Europe, get this through your head:  Rooms are smaller than US rooms,  because the cities and this one in particular, are VERY OLD.  They did a great job fitting this hotel in to a old building that has to be a top 3 location in Barcelona.  Stay here and take out the worry, but you will pay more than the $150 expedia special that's miles away from the gothic area.",4,2010,04,06
37,Amazing hotel!  Great location!  Surperb service!!,"We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel, right off of La Rambla.  The hotel staff  & concierge were very friendly and helpful.  They  helped us with directions, things to do, restaurants and many other things.  Marco at the front desk is excellent!  Our room was gorgeous!!  Great views of the city!  We will be back!!",5,2010,04,05
37,"Superbly located in the very center of Barcelona, but not 5 stars","The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Barcelonas center on the famous street la Ramblas. You are close to sightseeing, shopping and many nice restaurants. The hote is good but does not live up to 5 stars. There is a spa with only treatments and no swimming pool or jaccuzy. They offer guests access to a swimming pool in the neighbourhood though. The service is good and the lobby has a modern nice style.",4,2010,04,04
37,Great Location for Las Ramblas,"We stayed at Le Meridien on Las Ramblas in March of 2010.  Las Ramblas is an interesting street but beware of pick pockets.  We had booked a junior suite which was not ready upon our arrival (which was early in the morning so understandable).  We were upgraded (for a fee) to the executive suite.  It was very nice, a round living room with a view of Las Ramblas.  It had contempary furniture which was not very comfortable.  We were brought a complimentary bottle of champagne.  As European hotel rooms go, it was very large.  It had a large bathroom with walk-in shower and separate bathtub.  Breakfast was included in the room rate.  I had the concierge book me a private transfer for the return to the airport.  They did not get that right.  A large van picked me up.  Fortunately I was his only passenger so no additional stops.  I paid $66 euros for that and was expecting a private car.  I think my husband's taxi to the airport was around 20 euros.  

All in all it was a good location with friendly staff and I would stay there again.",4,2010,04,04
37,Un hotel fabuloso!,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel for our first trip to Barcelona and I loved it. We had a junior suite and it was very, very comfortable. Rooms in Europe tend to be smaller than they are here, but we had enough space and the bathrooms are quite large for Spain. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets are soft. I found the staff friendly & helpful and everyone speaks English well. A few things I liked:
1) The hotel smells GREAT! There is some scent they use and it's nice to come in off the street and have that smell.
2) There is a small cafe in the lobby run by a very friendly man who serves pastries and juice and coffee for a reasonable price. I loved the convenience of the cafe and the food was fresh.
3) The hotel is right on Las Ramblas and within walking distance to nearly everything. Cabs are easy to find. For those people sensitive to noise, be aware that if you are on a lower floor like we were, you will hear noise from the Ramblas all night long.......there are street cleaners, garbage trucks, mopeds......it's a busy area. Bring earplugs.
4) There's a business center in the basement with four computers and internet is free. We rarely had to wait for a computer.
5) The hotel restaurant (Cent Onze) had tasty food and a large buffet breakfast for those people wanting a more American-type meal in the morning. (But really! Just go to the cafe for a croissant and cafe con leche.....es delicioso!)
6) The hotel is VERY VERY CLEAN!

After walking around all day, I found it a relief to come back to Le Meridien.",5,2010,04,02
37,Great location for teens--two caveats,"Le Meridien is a great location if you are traveling with teens--they can walk nearby and go to shops, cafes, the Boqueria, and still easily find their way back to the hotel.  In order to honor our request that we room next to our teens' room, we got a free upgrade and had a lovely suite with terrace.
Two caveats: I agree with prior review, we were also told we would need to pay a ridiculous price to have a cot sent up.  Also, the concierge booked us the wrong concert, and we were told they couldn't refund us.
Otherwise, we had a nice stay and would go again.",4,2010,03,28
37,Make sure that you don't need to rent a cot at this hotel.,"Le Meridien is a nice hotel in a great location right on Las Ramblas. The room was very nice - modern and clean. The staff was professional, but not exceptionally friendly like at some other hotels I've visited recently.  

As I was traveling with my 16 year old son and a friend who tagged along on my son's and my vacation since her husband and kids were not interested in traveling to Europe (really!), we had requested a room for three. The room we were assigned had only two twin beds pushed together. When we requested a cot, the staff informed us that rental would be 115 Euro per night!  How ridiculous.  We could have found a room for three at a less ""upscale"" hotel online for not much more than that and have saved the hotel points had we known that . 

After considering our options, I realized that there was an oddly shaped squarish chair in the room. For fun, I looked under the cushions and discovered that the square chair contained a single pull out bed! We ended up being able to separate the two twin beds and pull out the chair/bed for my son without paying the ridiculous cot rental. We called housekeeping directly and asked them to bring up a set of sheets. 

Unlike some other hotels in this category, this hotel did not offer any kind of complimentary breakfast or upgrades. They did give us each a voucher for a coffee in their cafe and passes for a modern art museum. 

The hotel did have a business center with computers for internet access, although some hotel guests monopolized the computers for VERY extended periods of time. Of course, this was not the hotel's fault, but it would have been nice if there was a time limit policy when other guests are waiting.  

All in all, it was a very nice hotel which was very conveniently located, but my stay was soured by the rip-off cot rental incident.",3,2010,03,18
37,"Great location, comfy beds, amazing shower. Very hospitable. Only a little irritation with the operator.","We ended up at Le Meridien by booking a ""Top Secret Hotel"" on lastminute.com.  It said a 4-star hotel on La Ramba for 100 euros so we went for it.  Very happy with our stay.  Loved the shower and the bed and bedding were so comfy. Also loved the low level blue lights that came on by motion which is helpful in the middle of the night if you want to slip to the restroom without waking your partner.  The only problem we had was with out minbar because it would not open.  When we tried to find out how to unlock it, it took my husband a few tries to speak to someone who could unlock it from afar but it still did not work.  It wasn't really a problem because we were just curious to see what was inside.  Maybe we were just unlucky with the time we called - perhaps they were super busy.  Otherwise, the service was impeccable.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  They also gave us free tickets to the Contemporary Art Musuem (MACBA) and a voucher for free coffee at the bar.  Would be happy to stay there again.",4,2010,03,15
37,Wonderful hotel - we will be back!,"We loved Le Meridien.  We took the Aerobus from the airport  (only 5E per person) and its last stop is at Placa Catalunya, only a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel.   The front desk staff and the bellmen were all so helpful to us.  We got caught in an absolute downpour one evening and arrived back at the hotel soaking wet.  The woman at the front desk gladly sent up a second robe and even a pair of slippers for us.  

We loved the bathroom, all that gorgeous dark stone tile and glass.  Our bed was perfectly comfortable.Our room fronted onto La Rambla and it was perfect for people-watching.    We loved that the hotel was right in the middle of things that we wanted to see. 

When we return to Barcelona, we will certainly stay here again!",4,2010,03,10
37,Great location - dirty room,"Hotel overall - located in a  beautiful building off La Rambla, close to most of the tourist attractions. The hotel has a small, but very comfortable and lovely lobby that sometime is overflowing with tour groups. One of the nights, they served a glass of bubbly to ""greet the evening"" - a very classy touch.

Check In  - easy and corteous service. We arrived at about 9am and were told that the room will be ready by noon (a good few hours before the official ckeck in time) and were offered a coupon for a cup of coffee (again a nice touch).

Our Room - After an overnight flight and a long day of sightseeing, we were eager to see our 1st floor room in the back of the hotel - it had a terrible musty odor. The front deck was very nice and agreed to provide an alternative room, alas not until later in the eve, so  we decided to stay in the room after all (keeping the window openned all day and all night, helped with the odor). The bed itself was comfy, but needed new pillows (very thin with minimal head/neck support). The overall impression of the room was shabby (almost like a 3 star hotel), as ceilling paint drips were all over the walls, the carpet didnt seem too clean and the mirrow and telephones in the living area were visibly dusty. The saving grace - terrific bathroom with the overhead (rain) shower head, great water pressure, roomy.

The Restaurants: We are from a large city, so are used to good quality restaurants. We ate at 101 (?) twice (on arrival and departure nights) and were disappointed both times. Wait stuff needs training (spilled wine, missed order, charged for things not ordered) and so-so food. Eat out, there are plenty of good places in Barcelona.",3,2010,03,09
37,"Good location, good service, rooms good but not great.","First and foremost Barcelona is a great city with much to see and enjoy. My first time in Barcelona and the first time in years I have stayed at a Le Meridien. The overall experience was good but there is room for improvement, especially in a town where there appears to be a lot competition. The rooms are a bit on the small size though the amenities are good, the staff is cheerful and helpful. The restaurant and bar were quiet during my stay but there are so many options in the Rambles area. I think this hotel is a safe choice and is in a good area of town. As I would get to know Barcelona better I might try other facilities.",4,2010,03,06
37,Only if Location is the most important thing....,"Le Meridien has one of the best locations in Barcelona.  Other than that, it's an overpriced hotel.  

The Rooms are decent, nothing special.  All suites are smoking. 

The service is decent, nothing special.  The restaurant was very good but very expensive.  

I preferred the W.",3,2010,03,06
37,not a good experience... we regret this option,"terrible service!!! we arrived at the hotel with 4 luggage and nobody was there to help us. for the record: there is a stair right in front of the hotel. As we got in the room, the mini bar was locked. We asked someone to open it, but apparently they forgot it. Too expensive for that terrible service. And more: i ate ""paella"" at hotel restaurant and i had diarhea..... never come back again...""",3,2010,02,28
37,Great location and amazing hotel!,"We stayed at the Meridien Barcelona using Starwood points and were placed on the starwood floor - let me just say I was impressed with the renovation of the room. The bathroom is very big and modern so much so that I could probably have stayed in there for hours (heck there's a flat screen tv in the bathroom, a huge sunken tub, and a ginormous showerhead on the ceiling, yes on the ceiling!). The bedroom has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. In fact, we overslept until 1pm the next day because the bed was so good and of course the blackout curtains made the room feel like it was 3am. The staff was spot on in every way from the cleaning crew to the receptionist and concierge (who by the way were extremely helpful in finding us restaurant recommendations and bus tours). If you're like us and don't have much time in Barcelona please use one of the bus tours one day you're there and you'll be able to see all the hot sites. Make sure to visit the Park Guell and the Sagrada Familia -   I've never seen anything like those 2 before. For some good food, check out Pinotxo bar (La Rambla, 91) at La Boqueria which is a market a few minutes from the hotel.

Regarding transportation, take the Aerobus outside the airport and get off at Plaça Catalunya. The hotel is within walking distance from the stop. The Aerobus service normally runs every 15  -minutes. You can catch it from outside all 3 airport terminals. You can take the Aerobus back to the airport when you're leaving. It only costs a few euros so it's definitely worth it.",5,2010,02,26

37,The hotel is great - the service will bring you back!,"My wife and I just stayed at this hotel. What a great experience. Everything, from our initial greeting, to checking in, to special requests have been addressed on a timely basis with a high level of service. 

It is located right in the Old Town section of Barcelona, and provides easy access to some of the best sights. The staff made great recommendations on places to eat and things to see. The room was great - quiet, plenty of room, great king-sized bed (not always easy to get in Europe), and superb bathroom with a large shower and over-sized shower head. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the lobby and a evening get-together for guests. 

We had a problem with a local retailer and asked the hotel staff for help in dealing with the owner. The Front Desk Manager, at my request, got involved and really helped to solve the issue - as our advocate.

We have traveled many places in the world and this was one of the best experiences we have had with a hotel and their staff. Are only regret is that we can't stay longer!",5,2010,02,12
37,TREATED LIKE ROYALTY,"From the moment we were greeted at the airport and transfered to the hotel in a luxury van we felt like royalty! The staff was amazing always willing to be of service. When we were making reservations for Cent Onze for dinner on the night we arrived, the restaurant/bar manager was giving complimentary glasses of cava to the guests in the lobby. Someone must have overheard me tell my daughter to have a glass since it was her birthday because at the end of our dinner, we were surprised with a gorgeous and quite delicious cake decorated with fruit and candles for her birthday. The cake was so large, the four of us enjoyed it for the next couple of days. 
The hotel is in a fabulous location. Right in the heart of everything and in close proximity to all the major attractions. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated with the signature wonderful beds that Starwood hotels are known for. The room are pretty average size for a room in Europe. The bathrooms are new with the most fabulous ""rain forest"" shower head(as my daughters referred to it) The amenities in the bathroom are first rate as is everything at this lovely hotel!
The hotel restaurant, Cent Onze was quite good. The breakfast was very nice with amazing cafe con leche and the dinner menu though a tad limited, was nicely priced for a 5 star hotel. I always prefer that the hotel that we are staying in has a good restaurant since sometimes after long days of touring the last thing we want to do is hunt for a restaurant. We ate there for dinner all 5 nights of our stay and they were kind enough to prepare dinners for us that were not on the menu(some from the room service menu and just scrambled eggs one night!)
I highly recommend the hotel for its location, staff, rooms,. food etc. We couldn't have been more pleased and can't wait to viisit the beautiful city of Barcelona and will definitely stay at Le Meridien!!!!!",5,2010,02,08
37,We couldn't have asked for more,"We stayed in two hotels while in Barcelona: the Meridien for one night (when we weren't paying), and then a more affordable boutique hotel (when we were).  And I have to say, after that first night, we were constantly missing our plush accommodations at the Meridien.  Located right on the Ramblas, we could walk pretty much anywhere in the Old City or Raval within ten minutes, and subway stop is a couple of clocks away for farther trips.  Luxury defined: I had an LCD TV in the bathroom where I could watch the news while sitting on the can (I had a ""Ramblas View"" room, which apparently was an upgrade, though since there was no balcony the view was pretty useless).  The lobby of the hotel is fantastic, outfitted with deep couches and tons of coffee table books that you can peruse while enjoying a cappuccino from the coffee bar.  The hotel's restaurant had a great Menu del Dia, three courses for about 15 euros.  I know there was a fitness center, though I couldn't rustle myself out of bed early enough to use it.  All in all, I enjoyed the benefits of an international chain hotel without even once feeling like I was staying in a chain hotel.  I hope to stay here again the next time I'm back in Barca!",5,2010,02,07
37,Weekend in Barcelona,"Just stayed in Le Meridien Barcelona over a weekend. The hotel is beautiful. Interiors are modern and artistically designed. Location is fantastic for tourists - in the middle of La Rambla. Everyone speaks English. Check in was efficient, and the staff were courteous. For some reason, the concierge only works from noon till 8pm. For a top notch hotel, that is not really good enough. Still, the concierge was efficient and knew everything about the city.

Suite was clean and spacious and well laid out - decor in the traditional style. Walk in wardrobe and a separate shower stall in the bathroom were good points. Bed was very comfortable.

Free internet access in the lobby and the business centre is a welcome bonus, as are the eminently reasonable room rates (compared to other hotels in other European cities). Will be back whenever I am in Barcelona.",5,2010,02,02
37,Amazing Property and Experience !,"I stayed in Le Meridien, Barcelona for a weekend in Dec 2009. It was one of the best weekend i had in Europe. The reasons were:

1. The location of Hotel- It's location is the best in town. You just come out of the hotel and you are right in the middle of the tourist attractions. No need to go here and there.

2. Hospitality- The staff is amazing. They treated me as their personal guest. You just ask them anything, and they will make it happen for you.",5,2010,01,26
37,Has the perfect location in a wonderful city.,"Best location for a great Hotel, you are just a few minutes walk from major attractions, the best shopping and the historical part of town.
The Hotel itself has the modern touch; rooms are very accommodating with nice décor. You can see how they look after details; service is fantastic from reception to housekeeping, they were always with a smile. 
Breakfast is awesome and the Restaurant has a great daily menu worth trying.
If I go back to Barcelona this Hotel will be my first choice, you can’t go wrong.",5,2010,01,17
37,"Great location, rooms quite varied, some issues","Spent 4 nights here in one of the smaller but newly refurbished rooms. As others have said, the location can not be beat. Very close to the metro, on the Rambla, a 5 minute walk from the airport bus stop at Placa Catalunya. Really, a tourist triple crown.
Room was small but very comfortable, staff were uniformly courteous but there were enough issues that made a 5 star hotel a 3 star experience.
Air conditioning was not strong enough to cool the room, and I heard another guest complaining that the two rooms he was given had the same issue. Lucily my room was in a quiet enough location that I could crack the window, but since the hotel felt the need for double glazing, noice could be a problem.
Listed check in time is 1400, at 1545 they did not have a room for me as a member with status in the SPG program and I had checked in at 1000, so there was notice.
Only 1 concierge on duty at all times which is definately not enough during prime time.
My room key stopped working and a clerk who did not know me gave me a new key without checking my identity, which is a real problem in a big city hotel.
Room was not as clean as it could be although I would have to admit I could rate it adequate.
On the plus side, sheets, towels and bathroom amenities were very good. Shower was excellent, bill was correct the first time.  All in all, the hotel is good but could be much better.",3,2010,01,07
37,A satisfactory stay,"Stayed here only for a night  before moving onto Barcelona via the high speed train to Madrid.  We had booked 3 rooms and they came in different configuration. I find the room small and as SPG plat we were disappointed that we were not upgraded to a suite. Service was cordial at best . We find it difficult to manoeuvere about in the room once we open up our two luggage bags. The other feature that bothered me was the sensor lights that lit up when one of us move n the other party is sleeping. Otherwise, the room is modern and clean with the usual amenties. Although the bed was comfortable, i did not quite take to the flat pillows.
 Our alllocated room had  a view of the  La Ramblas and it was fun to people watch. The sound proofing was good  and we were not bothered by any noticeably loud noise despite the busy thoroughfare. Needless to say the location is superb with so many eateries , shop, carrefour express and an interesting food market all so closeby.  There is also a  barcelona turistic  bus stop near the hotel where one can board the hop on hop off tour  bus to see the various highlights of the city . It is good value for money .",3,2010,01,07
37,Great Location,"Great Hotel and Location for a prestay before our Christmas Cruise in the Med.. Right on Las Ramblas so lots to see and do, great restaurants in area. - bed comfortable - but the rooms were a little hot - thermostat didnt' seem to work.

Room was clean and neat - a little small - will stay here again..",3,2010,01,06
37,"Great location, but terrible management, avoid this hotel like plague!!","What poor service!! Location is great, but the hotel is overpriced, and the general manager is horrible. They charged us twice for the same and refused to refund charges for months. We only were able to get our money back thanks to visa. Avoid them by all means, there are plenty much less expensive and nice hotels in the same area.",1,2010,01,05
37,Terrific location and hard-working staff but a bit loud and not quite 5 stars,"This hotel really does have a very central location, which is both a blessing and a curse.  It's an ideal point from which to explore Barcelona but becuase it is right on La Rambla, there is definitely some noise.  We asked for a quiet room and were given one on the 4th floor that directly overlooked La Ramba.  The noise from the street was manageable  but we did notice that the subway runs very near and you hear the trains rumbling through the night.  The walls were also somewhat thin so that we could hear our neighbors talking and watching TV.  

The staff was very friendly and helpful, offering good suggestions on restaurants and sights.  They also tried to assist when there were issues with the room, such as when the room keys failed to work several times.  The staff offered us a glass of champagne to make up for our troubles, which was much appreciated.  The concierge was also helpful in getting dinner reservations.

Overall, the experience was good but just missed the mark on enough things to make it  a 4-star instead of a 5-star hotel.",4,2010,01,05
37,Simply Awesome,"What a terrific Hotel.  Perfectly located on Los Ramblas, the hotel is simply perfect.   The decor is wonderful, if you are OK with modern, and fits perfectly with the connection to the Contemporary Arts Museum.  Our room was spacious, and beautifully appointed.   The service was superb, and the staff friendly.   Included in the price were tickets to the Contemporary Art Museum and free coffee.  All nice touches that added the icing  top of a great hotel experience.  The price, while not cheap, is very reasonable, especially considering the location, room and service quality.",5,2009,12,29
37,Unparalled location,"The hotel is very nice, with, we believe, the best location in Barcelona, right on Las Ramblas. The hotel has 2 parts, the older section, with larger, but more angular rooms, with a sitting area, bigger bathrooms, older televisions, but with a balcony right on Las Ramblas.  The newer section has more modern rooms with flat screen tvs, modern bathrooms, but much smaller than the older section.  My husband liked the modern room, but for the space and character, we (I) selected the larger room in the older section.  The concierge was indispensable with recommendations for restaurants. The bar staff was friendly and mixed some great cocktails!  We would definitely return.",4,2009,12,26
37,Excellent Hotel - location is perfect,"My wife and I spent 2 nights here prior to a Med cruise.  The location is right on La Rambla, in the middle of everything.  Very easy access to the Gothic section of town.  We found the staff very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were very clean and in immaculate condition.  Except for a taxi from the airport and to the port, we walked everywhere.  If there was 1 downside (and this was expected), the street noise can be a little loud on a Friday night.",5,2009,12,01
37,"Excellent Location, Nice Rooms and Good Service","We stayed here in September 2008 with friends who had an adjoining suite.  Rooms were clean and well-appoitned with a desk in the entrance hall that we made good use of.

Beautifully appointed bathwooms with all the amenities as one expexcts from a Starwood property, and the front desk was very helpful and courteous to us, which was a welcome relief after an all-night flight from New York.

Hotel is on a lovely corner street in the heart of Las Ramblas, and we walked the entire area during our stay.  Sagrada Famiglia required a short cab ride, but taxis are plentiful.

We were cautious about the petty thieves and pickpockets who abound in this area, and had no problems in the city during the four days of our stay.",4,2009,11,29
37,"Great hotel, awesome location","Just returned from 10 Day trip to euprope with 2 nights at the Le Meridien Barcelona.  I had booked a junior suite using Starpoints.  I know its expensive and don't know if I would pay the $$ but it was a great value using points.

 I told them it was my birthday and aniiversary and we got upgraded to a suite over looking La rambla on the corner.  Great location a 2 minute walk to the market, 5 min to the Gothic area 3-5 min to the square to pick up the hop on hop off bus.  We were leaving on a cruise and it was a 10 min taxi ride to the ship.

Our room was a modernversion with a bedroom, living area and a very large cave like bathroom. The bathroom as cave like because it was dark tile and had a seperate shower with 2 haeds and a vary large bath tub, also very nice soaps, gels, shaving kits etc.   Staff and concierge were very helpful.

don't eat breakfast it's expensive, we walked 3 min to the market and got fresh pastries,  juice, meats for 1/5 the price 

The only downside is LaRambla is very noisy, the bed room ws pretty quiet but uin the living room you could hear the street.  When a group of guys is singing ""When the saints go marching in"" at 4am that will give you a flavor of the street.  You are definitely in the middle of things here.

 I would go back to this hotel again in a minute.",5,2009,11,29
37,Steps away from access to everything,"Right on Las Ramblas and minutes from Plaza Cataluna and the public market, you cannot beat its location.  In the Gaudi spirit, the stately, elegant building has been transformed into a modernist gem on the inside.

Checking-in left something to be desired as the band U2 and its entourage were checking out, creating chaos; however, once past that obstacle, it was smooth sailing. 

Our room had an incredibly efficient layout and was beautifully styled with all the latest conveniences:  The bathroom, especially, was as modern as any we've stayed in.  A cool convenience was a motion sensor in the hallway that, when actuated, slowly turned on the bathroom lights at night when all other room lights were off.  Room size -- somewhat small -- was inconsequential because there is so much to see and do in BCN, thereby limiting time spent in it.  Street noise was not a factor; the hotel must have installed sound-proof glass.

Computer and Internet access were included and readily available on level ""-1,"" and a coffee/breakfast bar on level ""0.""

For convenience sake, we found it easier to walk up to the Plaza Cataluna to catch a cab versus hailing it at the hotel; there, too, you can find public transportation to/from the airport and access to the subway system.

The on-site restaurant,  Cent Onze, is a great find for lunch with its prix fixe offerings featuring local Catalan cuisine.  People watching window-side is a must with its unobstructed views of Ramblos.

Without hesitation, we'll return to this property in the future.",4,2009,11,19
37,Great Location - room comfortable but in need of refurbishment,"We chose this hotel because of its central location and that the room (Mediterranean Suite) has a terrace (which was huge). We were very happy with both these features and even in November made good use of the terrace to relax on in between sight seeing trips. The central location is great - the major visitor sites are either within walking distance or an easy tube ride. Also, lots of restaurants and shops an easy walk.
The actual hotel was a mixed bag - the reception has a modern feel and on arrival the welcome was okay. Free internet access is available in the reception - which worked well.
The room was one of the Mediterranean suites, and was spacious and equipped with the standard stuff one expects in a 5* hotel. The large bed was comfortable and the lounge area had a large sofa and armchair.
However, it was poorly decorated and showed signs of wear and tear (holes is the curtains, worn carpet, chipped paint on the skirting boards). One example of the poor decoration was that the room had two large and deep alcoves with three glass shelves that we assume were supposed to have objects on display in them. There was nothing in either of them apart from the large TV at the bottom of one. This made the room feel barren and empty.
Our expectation of a 5* hotel is that a bit extra is provided from the normal to provide a sumptuous experience. Le Meridien only provided what it had to in order to get the rating, which made it ordinary.",3,2009,11,17
37,"Disappointed with service, but would still recommend based on location","I have been a fan of Starwood Hotels, having stayed at various properties in the US for business and travel. My friend and I picked Le Meridien for its reputation on service and professionalism. So imagine our disappointment when we were practically ignored at the front desk after an 18-hour trip from LA to Barcelona. While we stood waiting for what seemed like an eternity, a male clerk continued to work on something without looking up, while another clerk was busy with a customer.  When that clerk became available, she called out to someone behind us and served him first, then pointed to the 'busy' clerk, indicating that we should wait for him.

He responded to her in Spanish, then proceeded to go back to what he was doing with no acknowledgment to us, who were still in line to be checked in. No 'we'll be right with you' or 'Sorry for the wait'. We had to wait for the other clerk to check us in after what seemed like an interminable wait. The service clerks were equally unhelpful, appearing to open doors and offering to help only to those who appeared to be distinguished-looking or important guests. I observed the same demeanor one morning as I watched the lobby activity. 

That my friend and I are two older women who may not look the part of rich, smartly dressed tourists should not influence the type of service we receive. However, to be fair, the housekeeping was totally up to par, delivered with courtesy and professionalism. The location of this place is what keeps it a hotel I would recommend.",2,2009,11,07
37,Stop all the whining,"I can't understand all of the negative reviews - we had great front desk service, clean updated rooms (though the glass bathroom is a bit odd), good bar/restaurant service, and you can't beat the location.  We thought about staying at the new W Hotel but am so glad we didn't; it's far from the hustle and bustle (and 8000 more Starwoods points per night).  Gil the concierge had some great restaurant suggestions and the front desk folks guided us to some great clubs open late.  My only complaint would be the high hurdle you need to do to get in to the bath/shower.  Yikes!  Yes, if you're looking for hip, up-beat, over-the-top trendy then this isn't the place for you.  But that's not what the brand Le Meridien is about.  If you want a somewhat quiet, business luxury hotel, then this is the place for you.",4,2009,11,02
37,"Great Location, Nice Hotel,  but some major Tech Issues","My wife was in town for a conference so I worked from the hotel for a week and explored Barcelona by night.  

Pros: Location, Modern styling, comfortable rooms
Cons:  Expensive; Internet service is expensive, erratic, and slow; TV/Media System was buggy, issues with heat and air conditioning.

For La Rambla and the surrounding area, you can't beat the location of this hotel.  Just a few steps from the main tourist drag, the street performers, and only about 5 minutes from La Boqueria (the big market).

Rooms are nice with modern styling, big comfortable beds, and lots of cool lights to break up that hotel room feel.  Free coffee/tea service and hot water bottle was nice.  Very clean and the rooms are made up very nicely every day.  Bar downstairs was lively and had good drinks and good music some nights.

The Internet service was really poor for 20 euros a day.  It was always slow, sometimes unusuable, and performed very choppily for anything but simple web browsing.  

The TV/Movie system had some issues... we had several channels that would show what other people were doing on their TVs -- we could watch their pay movies (yes, *those* too) but had to wait if they paused the movie, for example.  We could even see messages from the hotel that were delivered via other people's TV's -- some fairly horrible privacy concerns here!

On more than one morning, the A/C in the room switched from blowing cool air to blowing hot air.  I complained the first morning and was told it was fixed and then it happened the next morning.  I was then told this part of a scheduled maintenance they didn't think anyone would notice.

All in all, not a bad place but they have some issues they need to resolve.",4,2009,11,02
37,why travel all the way to spain to hang out with american business travelers..,"My first impression as I walked up was two dorky United Pilots hanging out by the door and my second impression was a young management consultant playing with his Iphone. 

Why travel all the way to Barcelona to be surrounded by boring people like this?  I'd checked out Hotel Banys Orientals and would much rather stay there. 

That said, everything about the place is fine and exactly what you'd expect from a Starwood type of place.  I just wouldn't go for fun.",2,2009,11,01
37,Spanish way,"Arrived on Sunday at 1pm and had to queue for 15 minutes to check-in. Rooms were not ready so people were leaving the luggage at the reception to come back later and nobody was picking them up. It became chaotic and pretty disorganized. When it was my turn to check in my room was not ready. They gave me the room number and told me the housekeeper was cleaning it so I had to come back an hour later.

Came back an hour later and the receptionist told me that my room was busy (I assume they gave it to someone else) and would look for another one. Gave me a room in the first floor with a small window that looked to a wall, which I rejected.

Went back to reception and the receptionist was rude and upset because I did not like the room. He offered me to come back at 5 or 6pm to see if another room got empty. I rejected, so he kept looking for another room for 15 minutes until he found another one. He said it was a nice view so I accepted. When I got there it had twins beds (I was travelling on my own). I gave up and took the room but will not go there again. Spanish way to do things... no manners… very disorganized…

BTW the hotel does not have a swimming pool and the spa is closed on Sundays",2,2009,10,27
37,"Nice rooms, good location, terrible customer service","I stayed here for 7 days.  Looked like everyone from the bell hop, the doorman, check in staff, consierge, the resturant and the hotel management went to the same seminar in how to not provide good customer service.  The consierge gave us the wrong directions to the the train station and seemed particularly peeved that guest with young kids were in his line asking for dinner reservation information!  Could not even get us a cab in an approprite amount of time.   Seemed like everyone had a chip on their shoulder.  They should change the name of the hotel to the Le Arrogance.  With the incredible competition for hotels in Barcelona, I will not be surprised to see this one continue to fall in the overall rankings.",2,2009,10,26
37,"Great Location, Okay Service","Great, central location.  Clean rooms.  Stayed in a Classic Mediterranean suite and truly enojyed the terrace.   Without the terrace, not sure hotel would have been worth it.   Rooms could use updating (antiquated television placed oddly in room and would have preferred a separate shower rather than tub/shower combo).  Staff not overly friendly, but helpful when they were really needed.  In-room wireless access was pricey, especially considering that many hotels offer wireless at no cost.   Restaurant downstairs was nice with excellent wait staff.",4,2009,10,25
37,Great Hotel,"My husband and I traveled to Barcelona for a long weekend.  We stayed at the Le Meridien for four nights.  I could not have asked for a better, more accommodating city hotel.  When traveling we always stay at Starwood properties and expect a high quality property.  Le Meridien was just that.  We were a bit concerned when reading up on the property because of some of the negative reviews.  I am not certain that we all were staying at the same hotel.  Upon our arrival we were greeted by the front desk staff with the warmest of greetings after such a long flight.  We found Daniel (from Ireland) extremely helpful.  

The room was small but that is to be expected in Europe.  It was nicely furnished and the bed was extremely comfortable.  We had no trouble falling asleep.  The bathroom was equally as nice.  The tub/shower was a pretty high step into so I would be careful as it was even hard for me to get in and out of.  There is a nice long hallway with a closet and luggage storage are so you do not have to step over suitcases.  They are tucked out of the way.

One of our main attractions when traveling are restaurants and we rely heavily on the concierge to recommend excellent restaurants.  We hit the jackpot with Gill.  He made us reservations at four great restaurants for the four nights we were in Barcelona.  He was very attentive and knowledgeable.  We ate at Pla, Con Majo (great paella), Bella Napoli (Italian and lively atmosphere) and Bembi (Indian).  Thank you Gill!

We truly enjoyed our stay at the Le Meridien and when we return to Barcelona we will stay there again.  It is a perfect home away from home!",5,2009,10,18
37,Great location and modern hotel,"My husband and I took a cruise this year that ended in Barcelona and wanted to spend a day there before heading home. I chose this hotel because of it being part of a chain I trust, as I've experienced issues with hotels in the past while traveling in Europe.

We had no idea when we booked it that it was in the main area of Barcelona, and were very happy to see it was a quick walk from where our final cruise stop hadleft us. We immediately went to check in as we were exhausted and in need of a nap. They let us in the room early and we were impressed by the design and moderness. 

The upside to the hotel was definitely the cleanliness, the location and the friendly staff. They totally took care of us from letting us in our room early, to free coffee and arranging a taxi to the airport.

The downside was it was a big more expensive than other hotels in the area. We also had a not so great view from our room, but being that we were only there for a night that wasn't a huge concern. 

It's definitely geared towards a more upscale crowd, but that said, they didn't treat us at all like we didn't belong there. If I were back in Barcelona I would definitely look into staying here again, but making sure I got a room with a view!",4,2009,10,18
37,"Great Location, Excellent Service","My family and I stayed here at the end of the 2-week vacation to the South of France and Barcelona.  We wanted something comfortable, within walking distance of the major sites (if possible) -- and most of all, a great place to relax after 2 weeks on the road and prior to a 14-hour flight home to California.  The hotel scored high remarks on everything.  We got the junior suite for two nights -- very roomy, pull-out couch for our 5-year-old daughter, plenty of space to lay out all the bags and pack.  Very comfortable bed, nice shower.  The hotel's staff was extremely helpful and very kind to our daughter.  Their recommendations were excellent, including 4 Gats / 4 Gatos, a great eatery about 5 minutes walking from the hotel.  Best of all, we could walk out every morning to Las Ramblas, with lots to do at every moment.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2009,10,18
37,Great Las Ramblas hotel,"Stayed here on a 3 day free stay, using Starwood points.  Had a nice room, overlooking las Ramblas.  Great location for all of the attractions, restaurants, etc. in the area.  Very nice rooms, great bed, very nice bathroom.  Never ate at the hotel, since there were so many other options on Las Ramblas.  But considered this a really terrific hotel.",5,2009,10,09
37,Great location but not for everyone.,"Hotel is located adjacent to Las Ramblas,the very busy thoroughfare in Barcelona. While we enjoyed this location very much because it was the center of all, some people might find it too busy.
The hotel is an excellent property with very nicely appointed rooms. The staff is very professional and helpful. If you are a Starwoods Club member you get a room on a special floor.",5,2009,10,08
37,Nice hotel in an excellent location,Very nice hotel. Good rooms. Recently renovated bathrooms. Location is fantastic in the middle of Ramblas. I was very excited to be lucky enough to get this on priceline.  Hotel also has free computers at the business center.,5,2009,10,08
37,In the heart of it,Stayed at the Meridien over a weekend.  As a SPG Platinum we didn't receive an upgrade as the hotel was at capacity.  Likely the only Starwood hotel not to upgrade us on a month long trip through Europe.  Hotel offers free passes to MACBA (museum).  Nice touch.  Hotel is directly on Las Rambla.  You'll see all the street performers day and night.  Hotel room was very modern with a TV in the bathroom.  Meridiens in Canada are very old-fashioned (Victorian) it was nice to see the European Meridiens to be very modern.  Walking to the port is simple and we even walked back from Barceloneta after dinner at CDLC.  Might not be a walk everyone is up for.  Nice place with nearby shopping.  Be cautious outside hotel since Las Rambla is a tourist hot spot which attracts the seedy types.  We had no issues nor did we witness anything suspect.,4,2009,10,07
37,"Great Location, Apathetic Staff, Arrogant Management","I stay in a lot of hotels, and I am the first to admit that I am particular about things like service level and cleanliness.  It is just something that just happens between the 75th and 100th night in a hotel each year.  I tend to stay with one group of brands more than any other – Starwood.  Though I hold elite status with other lodging brands I find that SPG offers me the best perks and fewest headaches.  They have a great guest information system, and when a hotel reads my profile and contacts my concierge with questions it is likely to be a good stay. 

Unfortunately this was not the case with the Le Meridien Barcelona.  Upon reservation I requested two renovated rooms and noted that a renovated room should trump a non-renovated suite.  At check-in, I was given one renovated room and one un-renovated suite.  When I asked the manager for two renovated rooms I was told they were sold out and they could not honor a change in room type.  I asked if they had standard rooms that had not been check in to and they said yes, but they would not switch. 

I had no choice but the take the suite, when I opened the door it looked like it was directly out of an episode of design on a dime.  The walls were bright yellow, the wall hangings were worn decoupage prints of scrolls and faux leather, the furniture was mismatched, worn, cushions depleted, and the springs were shot.  My mother threatened to sit on it and call the front desk to say she can’t get out.  When I complained to Delfi Ferrer the Manager on Duty (and the hotel controller) his only response was “it is not broken.”  I am not really sure what the Spanish standard for broken is, but in my mind this sofa had missed its appointment with the dumpster for quite some time.  

The renovated room was not much better.  The lights in the room did not turn on for the first few days, the TV turned itself on and off randomly (all hours of day and night), and the carpet was worn and dirty.  It took no less than 10 visits and calls to the front desk to get someone up to look at the light problem, and I was at my wits end by the third day when an engineer came late in the evening and found that a dimmer switch had been disengaged.  I asked him about the TV while he was there and he stated that it is a “security feature” -  I was in disbelief, I was certain that something was lost in translation.  I called Mr. Ferrer and was told that the engineer was indeed correct.  They were making changes to the computer to see if they could stop the system checks of the TV…  The carpet issue was never addressed – I opted for shoes. 

After the TV situation was resolved in my room (423), I got a call from mother in the suite (815) – “I think someone is in my room.”  I ask her why, she answers “someone just turned on the TV in the living room,” as we spoke her bedroom TV came on.  The hotel was never able to correct the issue with the suite, nor was she ever able to get all three TVs to synch to one channel. 

Mr. Ferrer was gracious enough to send us to CentOnze for lunch.  We looked at the menu and saw many tempting entrees, so we thought what the heck.  We arrived at CentOnze and they gave us a great table by the window.  We were given menus and told that we could only order from the €15 menu items -  a selection of Pork or Rape fish and not the more extensive more tempting regular menu. We both selected the pork tenderloin.  Though my mother’s pork was fork tender, my was too tough to cut with a knife.  I lost my appetite and sent it back.  I guess I really should have had it sent to the homeless guy who was berating us from the other side of the window – but since security did nothing about him, I could only assume he would not get the meal either. 

I complained to Mr. Ferrer and he said that he had not heard any complaints. 

This is really just the highlights of the substandard service one can expect at the Le Meridien Barcelona.  I know you may be thinking that “this guy is really persnickety” but I hope you would also consider that there is a certain expectation when one is paying more than $350 a night to stay.

There are numerous amenities that are commonly found in upper upscale hotels, but were lacking or inconsistent at this property. 

•         SPG Platinum Guests will get turndown service for only their first night. 

•          SPG Platinum Guests will get water only for their first night.

•         You have to call a special number and get approval to get your sheets changed

•         The concierge will only book reservations at the restaurants he recommends, if you did your own research – good luck.  I had to go to the Manager on Duty to get him to book a table at Gresca for me. 

•         Concierge line is VERY long, relax you will be waiting a while. 

•         Hotel does not have a taxi stand, they hail they from the street and there can be a VERY long wait.  We waited for nearly 45 minutes one night before cancelling our dinner reservations and going to a local restaurant.

•         Rest assured though, the apathy expressed by staff and management comes in an endless supply and it complimentary with every paid night. 

I spoke with Gonzalo Duarte, the hotel’s General Manager upon checkout and found that the arrogance and apathy filters from the top down. He did not apologize, instead offered that he has many satisfied guests, it is “unfortunate” about my experience. 

When I got home, I called Starwood Corporate Services to file a complaint.  The hotel GM had five days to respond, but he never did.  The complaint routed back to Starwood Corporate Customer Service which admonished the managment team at the hotel for their inaction.",3,2009,10,06
37,LOOK ELSEWHERE-This is NOT a first class hotel.,"After a multiple stop trip through Europe-the experience we had at this hotel was by far the worst. The location is great but the slick interior and modern decor has completely sacrificed the comfort (beds are hard as a rock) and warmth, and luxury of a so called five-star hotel. (how it received this rating is anyone's guess)

In addition--on two separate occasions the fuse in our room blew, the first time destroying our 100.00 Brookstone alarm clock/noise machine. When it happened a SECOND time we complained to the supervisor on duty and his response was rude and dismissive. This is not, despite advertisements a five star hotel. Not even close.",2,2009,10,05
37,"Great location, lousy bathroom","We loved the location. It is right in the middle of everything , walking distance to a lot of attractions and close to the metro and buses. The hotel itself is very modern,( however i don't think it deserve to be a 5 stars , there are not enough ""5 stars"" amenities in this hotel). I did not like the lobby , it is just too small and uncomfortable but they have a nice fitness room and a business center w/ free computer use and printer in basement. The DAY  staff at the reception desk needs some training on how to SMILE. The were very ""cold"" and acted like they did not want to be bothered.  The ""night"" staff was  much friendlier . The room we had was typical : nice size , very modern but the bathroom is a JOKE : there are no walls, just a THIN  translucid glass enclosure w/ a glass sliding door that does not latch. It does not provide any privacy . If you are alone, it is ok, otherwise you feel totally exposed . In my opinoin the bathroom's lack of privacy  is a major flaw. Whoever designed this bathroom sacrificed all functionality and common sense for aestetics! ( in addition , the tub has no shower curtain and if you take a shower ,water splashes all over the floor) .Eventough overall we liked the hotel  I would not go back there because of the ""lousy"" bathroom .",3,2009,09,29
37,The best of Barcelona in one hotel,"My husband and i just returned from a 5 night stay at Le Meridien Barcelona.  We went to celebrate our 10th year wedding anniversary and from the moment we stepped into the hotel, we knew that we had chosen the right place.  Le Meridien is warm and inviting, classy and hip, with  a quiet elegance.  
The staff were all very welcoming and accommodating.  The front desk associates were very knowledgeable about the city and always willing to answer questions and offer suggestions.  The concierge too, was knowledgeable and very patient with our ongoing restaurant quests and frequent reservation changes.  The barista at the coffee bar remembered our order preferences on his own and began preparing them as soon as he saw us coming each morning.
The hotel has a business center with several computers and free internet access which was invaluable.  There is also free WiiFi in the lobby and restaurant.  In addition, there is a small gym which offers several different types of cardio machines, free weights, and other equipment.  The gym was never crowded and open 24 hours.
The hotel is situated in an amazing location.  It is right off of Las Ramblas, and gives you so much access to so many different areas of the city, including La Boqueria, the Old City, MACBA, Barconoletta, El Born, etc. etc.  In addition, there are a TON of restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance. While Las Ramblas can be crowded and crazy, you turn into Le Meridien and you feel that you have stepped into an oasis.  I never once heard any noise coming from the street.
We had a wonderful stay and are already making plans to return next yearl",5,2009,09,24
37,don't expect any service,"The concierge was not at all helpful.
Receptionist was cheerful.
Location is convenient to gothic quarter.",2,2009,09,23
37,"Fantastic location, great staff, lovely rooms.","I have just returned  from Le Meridien on the Ramblas. A lovely hotel in a great location.
Our room was very comfortable and clean. Modern with all the usual requirements.
We loved the huge plasma T.V. and the smaller one in the bathroom was a nice touch. 
 Breakfast was a choice of buffet or Al a carte  we had the buffet which was extremely good. I loved the fruit shots as you waited to be seated. The mango ,lime and chilli  was amazing.
We ate in the restaurant one of the evenings great food with perfect service.
Check in and check out were a pleasure. All the staff were polite, friendly and more then efficient.",5,2009,09,21
37,"Great location, locwly hotel, staff needs work","I stayed at the Le Meridien Barcelona for 3 nights in September. 

The hotel is modern and fresh - the typical things you expect from any SPG property. The location on Las Ramblas is great as it is close to 2 subway lines and walking distance to some of the major Barcelona sites (La Boqueria Market, the Cathedral, waterfront, Catalunya Square)

Echoing other posts, I am a Platinum SPG member and did not receive the typical perks you would receive - preferential check-in, daily water, upgraded room, or my requested local gift. 

However, besides the SPG rant that applies to few, I was disappointed in the staff at the hotel. There seems to be a condescending attitude with the staff - a simple request for the password to the wireless password was met with hesitation and questions about why I needed it. I asked for room cleaning which was never done.  When I asked about the status of my local wine gift, the front desk shrugged me off and said she would just give me hotel points. 

The rooms were spacious and fairly new. We were though welcomed by quite a bit of hair in the bathroom from the previous guests........ yuck! 

They offer free computer usage which is constantly crowded and always a long wait. Although I wished the hotel could manage the computers better, it's still nice and convenient to have them available to do a bit of research, check-in for flights/trains, etc. 

I'm hesitant to recommend this hotel due to the spotty service but would suggest to stay here if you can get a great price.",3,2009,09,20
37,Great Location..Lovely Hotel,A really nice contemporary hotel on Las Ramblas. Great location. No complaints.,4,2009,09,19
37,A terrific choice!,"The location couldn't be better.  A stylish contemporary hotel in 
an historic building.   The fabulous bathroom was a bonus.  It
takes a few minutes as the American to become used to the
'lighting' card. -- Just go out the front door and there's the center
of town for people watching. --- Stayed there before a cruise and
it is easy taxi to the port.",5,2009,09,11
37,Great hotel in a superb location.  Staff is just okay.,"As a platinum SPG member, I stayed here for 4 nights.  The first night I was put in a standard room, and upgraded the following 3 nights.  Upon check in, even though I have platinum status, I wasn't treated like a platinum member.  I guess it's because I look like I'm a kid.  Even during the hotel stay, my keys had demagnetized and the staff kept saying you're a platinum member?!!  I thought this was rude because I do stay in hotels alot for work.   This staff member was an older fellow, and I guess he was expecting someone in a business outfit.  

Okay, now to the room.  The upgraded suite was awesome.  It overlooked the La Rambla, yet wasn't noisy whatsoever.   The bedroom and living room was spacious.  Everything was top notch with the room.  

 I didn't get any water delivered, which is usually standard for platinum members.  

The business center while free is crowded with tourists trying to check their email.  Actually anyone could just walk in and use it.  The should keep a staff member down below to verify people are indeed staying in the hotel and limit the time use.  The computers can be quite slow and I'm sure there's viruses on them.  On one of the computers,  when opening up IE,  an XXX ad popped up.  Imagine if some kids were using it.  

Overall this is a great hotel that I would love to stay at again.  It would be a 5 star if it had a pool and a club lounge for platinum members.",4,2009,09,11
37,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is amazing and it is right the heart of Barcelona. 
The rooms are spacious, modern, and clean with great design details. The bed is extremely comfortable and the hotel staff super friendly.",5,2009,09,08
37,"Great location, Terrible Service","When we arrived at the hotel in Barcelona we checked in and were happy to be informed that we were upgraded to a suite. There is only one elevator for this large hotel and sometimes the wait could be upwards of ten minutes. We were on one of the top floors of the hotel and the view was great. The city of Barcelona was a beautiful site. We arrived at our room and we found champagne in the room to greet us. It was great. The room, living area and bathroom were very large. However, the rooms seemed dated and old. Some of the tile in the bathroom was falling off. The bed was rather hard for a five star hotel. The hotel is in a prime location. Perfect for getting basically anywhere in the city. My sister and I being tourists, ascended down to the concierge to book activities for our stay. We were very disappointed when there was no concierge to greet us when we got there. Other travelers seemed to be wondering where the concierge was also. Willing to wait and come back later we decided to try out the hotel's soul restaurant. We were seated immediately. We got a nice seat next to the window. Unfortunately we found the menu to be unsatisfactory and left to eat tapas about a ten minute walk away. When we arrived back to the hotel to find the concierge was still not there. Again we decided to wait until morning to speak with the concierge. We ordered room service that night. We were surprised how good of a deal the desserts were and we ordered two. When they arrived at the room we had  a completely different outlook. The desserts were tiny about half the size of my palm. About two bites and they were gone. We stayed at the hotel for two nights and during several attempts to contact a concierge we had no luck at all. Trying to book activities through the check in staff did not work either. They said we must book through the concierge. Overall, the rooms were four star quality and the service two star quality. I would not recommend this hotel for a tourist to barcelona. However, there was a very nice looking hotel right across the street. Not exactly sure if I have the name right but it was something like 1893 or some number! I would only recommend this hotel for business travelers.",3,2009,09,06
37,Poor Privacy at double occupancy,"We were assigned a ""designer room"", which provided little but fancy furniture. There was no sideboard with drawers to put your clothes in so we had to put our stuff on the floor (ok, granted, this gave the whole thing kind of a romantic atmosphere - like Attila's camp).
The worst feature is the stylish bathroom with its glass walls. Not only do you hear everything (EVERYTHING!) but using it at night also means disturbing your partner as the bathroom lights are brightly shining thru the glass walls. Poor Privacy, this. (if you are the sole person in the room, this obviously will not disturb you)
Not an adequate value for our money.
The ""gym"" is tiny (less than 20 sq meters - 230 sq feet)",2,2009,09,01
37,Excellent Location!,"Amazing location, off La Rambla - agreed it's the most touristy part of town (think Times Sq), however, it also guarantees that it will not be deserted if you return to the hotel late at night. The staff are helpful and friendly, the concierge can hook you up with tours etc...I do not want to comment on rooms/value for money, bc we stayed on SPG points and were upgraded to a suite, so ofcourse, I would have nothing but NICE things to say abt the roomy, spacious and comfortable suite we stayed in! As for Barcelona, I think it's one of best cities in the world (think Paris - with a beach!) and I live in NYC! So to all those Barcelona-dissers out there, get real!",4,2009,08,29
37,"Mixed - Great Location, clean hotel, but low value for the price","Just spent a week there, and had a mixed experience.

Hotel is very clean, sterile in fact, in both upkeep and design.  Lobby had a great little cafe with a charming waiter staffing it on his own.  The restaurant was way too garde for my taste, and it looked like they were trying too hard (and quite empty as well). The bar was comfortable, but ridiculously overpriced ($20 US for a martini???). We often went across the street to the Hotel 1899, which was ""only a 4 star"" but infinitely more charming, and had better and more food options, including a little courtyard with 3 restaurants/bars at their disposal (Attached, but I dont believe they were part of the hotel).  The 1898 also had a cool bar on their roof (Are you listening Meridien?)

Room was small, especially for an ""upgraded"" one.  As other travelers said, the weird glass door was a bit odd, but I had seen this before in several W hotels.  No ice on the floor so you had to order it up from room service twice a day. Fortunately, they didnt put up a fuss for this and were actually quite speedy on delivery (no charge).  

Wifi charges in the rooms was way overpriced at about $20 US per day.  The lobby had free wifi, which I shared with scores of travelers in all stages of dress day and night. 

Would have been nice to have a pool at the hotel to cool off since it was hot there in Aug. Plus I find a little swimming helps w jet lag and relieving stiff muscles after walking all day.  They had access to a pool, but it was a 20 min walk.  

I found the concierge services unhelpful, and even suspect.  One restaurant they sent us to was clearly a tourist trap (Restaurant Neyras: no locals, mostly empty, extremely expensive, average mid-market fare).  

The location of the hotel is fantastic. Its on the Ramblas between the Boqueria (where we had most of our breakfasts) and Plaza Catelunya, which is the location of the tourist office and the main Metro station.  Easy access to the Gothic quarter too.  But other more charming hotels in the area have these advantages as well.

Overall I would only recommend this hotel if on purely business travel, or if money and value were not a concern.",3,2009,08,26
37,Don't Go Ro Barcelona Ever!,The hotel is located near a very crowded and dirty road(La Rambla) where a lot of stealing is going on!Most of the rooms have no view!The booking was for a deluxe double room and it was nothing like that!They charge the breakfast 25 euros each!!!for God's sake!and the parking 35 euros a day while in Nice and Cannes Cote D'Azur they charge it for 21 euros per day!We don't recommend  Barcelona in general because it is too filthy and a lot of stealing is going on everywhere so be careful and don't carry a bag.Also we were robbed.They gave us a flat tire and they stole my bag while trying to fix it.The hotel offerred to help us with the tire and they charged us 225 euros only for 1 tire.So don't go to Spain by car also because they see the foreing signs and they rob you.The incident happened the next day to customers of the same hotel....coincidence???,1,2009,08,26
37,Liked it - some quibbles,"This is not a bad place to stay. I have 4 comments about our visit:
1. I expected a few more facilities - maybe a pool or a roof top bar.
2. Front desk were superb but check in was far too late. We eventually got our room after 6pm and a couple of complimentary wines at the bar. That's far too late especially when you are paying a fair amount for a room and you have an angry wife in tow (who doesn't drink wine).
3. Room cleaning was not of the Starwood standard. In fact, it was kinda annoying. Basic bed making and little else despite tips of the monetary kind.
4. The bathroom - who on earth designed this? Space age frosted glass wall looking into the bedroom and the glass door didn't even close properly! No privacy at all. A terrible design.

Nevertheless, liked the place and I might go back if they fix the door in the bathroom.",4,2009,08,24
37,Great hotel in terriffic location!,"We arrived very very late, and the gal who checked us in  (I believe her name was Danae), she was very accommodating to our needs, even tho the hotel was very full. Our room was very nice with a step out balcony.  The beds were so comfortable and the pillows were the very best I've had on our trip throughout Europe staying in 4 and 5 star hotels.  Thank you Le Meridien Barcelona.",5,2009,08,22
37,Extremely comfortable and well located,"My husband and I are very happy with our recent stay. The front desk was friendly. The concierge was extremely helpful. Staff was prompt with requests such as an extra robe, toothpaste, etc. The rooms are large and modern with the usual amenities.  We were a bit disappointed that the large flat screen television had only one channel (CNN) in English.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The hotel gave us complementary passes to the Contemporary Art Museum. Check in and check out were swift. 
I would definitely stay here again.",4,2009,08,16
37,fabulous hotel,"Our family of four spent four nights in Le Meridian in August 2009.  We had two rooms.   The rooms were great.  The beds and sheets were extremely comfortable.  The furniture was modern and solid.   The lighting was well designed and attractive.  The bathrooms were clean and elegant, with good showers, and the towels and toiletries were first rate.  There was a large, excellent flat screen tv on the wall.  Although the hotel is located in a part of town with non-stop action, the rooms were sufficiently sound-proofed that we could barely hear any street noise.  

The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful.  We did not try the restaurant, but we had some drinks, appetizers, and desserts at the bar.  They were good, but expensive.  

My only complaint about the hotel is that there were too few free computers with internet access.  There was almost always a line to use them.",5,2009,08,16
37,Nice stay at Le Meridien BCN,"We enjoyed our two night stay at the Barcelona Le Meridien.  The hotel was totally up to expectations; however, we were not expecting a true ""five star"" experience even though the hotel bills itself as five stars.  Certainly worthy of four stars though.  The rooms were pretty standard for an upscale European hotel and everything was very clean and bright.  The location is really the big draw for this hotel as it is situated right on La Rambla close to everything.  The huge market just down the block is a must see.",4,2009,08,15
37,Very nice stay,"I stayed with my boyfriend and friends at Le Méridien Barcelona for a two night visit to the Spanish metropolis.

The hotel is very modern, great lobby and first impression; same with the rooms: very nice furniture, great wallpapers, great details.

The only thing - it was not as clean as expected in a five star hotel. I kind of had the impression that housekeeping has not been ready with our room when we checked in, everything was set up, but there were stains on the mirrors, the sink, even the toilet. The minibar was not refilled - and there was a McDonalds cup left from the guest who stayed in the room before. I complained about that at the reception and they apologized, but honestly: they replaced the missing things in the minibar, but the overall cleanliness was not the best. Also, the mattresses very way to soft, it felt like you would lie on a waterbed or something, and we all love hard ones.

Other than that we had a great stay at Le Méridien Barcelona, the location is absolutely fantastic, you are right in the middle of everything. We did not eat at the hotels restaurant although they have great deals every day, but we did have some cocktails in the bar which is also very nice. Apparently there is a DJ on Friday and Saturday nights which we missed unfortunately.

The overall experience was good, not great, but I still would recommend Le Méridien Barcelona to other travelers seeking for a nice place to stay.",3,2009,08,12
37,A lovely stay in downtown Barcelona,"We spent three nights at Le Meridien and found it to be of a very high quality. The onsite staff and terrific concierge (kudos to gold-key god Ricardo for clutch restaurant recommendations and touring hints) that really enhanced our visit.  The location was ideal for us, right off La Rambla, walking distance to the Barri Gothic, and (for us) also walking distance to Barceloneta and the beach.  We felt like we were in the perfect jumping-off point, and hoofed it everywhere. Shopping was literally at our doorstep. Best of all, we sighed happily each time we opened the door to our guest room and found that the air conditioning was set on stun, the room was always fresh and clean right after breakfast, the dual shower was spacious and invited many showers, a comfy and inviting bed, room-darkening blinds that really did it so we could sleep until noon, and the two TVs were a surprisingly nice (and necessary) diversion for news junkies on different English-language stations!  The room wasn't huge, but was well laid out and well lighted so it didn't have a small-hotel room feel. We had our pick of nearby restaurants (right across the street, Bar Lobo became our local. It is the bomb for late-night tapas and serious cocktails made by Allesandro, and also weekend brunch). We could bop into and out of La Boqueria for fresh fruit, bread, and a host of other edibles on a daily basis, which was a lot of fun, and we enjoyed our late-night strolls for gelato from a number of shops that were open until midnight. The downstairs Cafe Illy was more reliable than the nearby Starbucks for morning Americanos, but we thought the restaurant onsite looked tragically hip and didn't partake. Sadly, some of the guests also were a little too foo-foo for our liking, but we rolled with it.  Two relatively smal downsides to an otherwise great stay. 1) we kept forgetting to put our ""do not disturb"" tags out on the door and bedtime, so we received daily wake up calls, courtesy of the loud door buzzers pressed by the waiting cleaning staff. Shocking and startling are understatements. This would be a very bad thing for anyone with a heart condition. Also, 2) The sliding-glass doors that separate the bathrooms from the rest of the guest rooms are pretty loud when they close, and we were sure we could here them closing and opening in all parts of the hotel. We always carry ear plugs, and used them nightly to avoid the audio in other guest rooms and the hallway. Noise levels were just slightly worse than average, but I'd expect more from Le Meridien.",4,2009,08,11
37,Great room and location,"Great bathroom, bed and television. Not the best workspace, but well worth the trade off. Loved the location, though it was far from the convention center. Would be a great place for a vacation. No view, and it really didn't matter a bit. This one grew on me with time and in retrospect is one of my favorite hotels. Spendy, though.",5,2009,08,07
37,fantastic location - right in the middle of the action,Great location right on Las Ramblas. First night I checked in no upgrade available. Rechecked with front desk on second night and they upgraded me and my family to an awesome 1 bedroom suite with a great view of the city. Very helpful staff. Very cool restaurants and bars everywhere. The street performers are everywhere. Get out and see the town and have fun!,5,2009,07,23
37,"A god stay, one complaint","Stayed there for one night on July. We booked a standard room, and it was certainly up to par (and more) with what I expect from a Starwood Hotel. The same was true of the check in desk staff both when checking-in and checking out and of the porters.  My only disappointment was the attitude of is of the staff during breakfast at the The Cent Onze restaurant. It's true that we wanted an early breakfast and were the first ones there, just a few minutes after they opened. The staff made me feel if I was just an unnecessary nuisance, they were very reluctant to answer, any questions and the only smile I got there was from another customer.  It is a good and generous buffet breakfast, but the coffee was not that great, and it is rather expensive. We came Le Meridien Barcelona after staying at a three star Hotel in Pamplona, where the ""buen dia"" and the smiles were in abundance during breakfast too, so the contrast was really striking. But apart from this it was a good stay and I would certainly come back again, and maybe eaven try the breakfast again.",4,2009,07,23
37,Great Location....excellent staff..could use better sound insulation in rooms.,"The hotel location is unbeatable....walking distance to all favorite museums and cathedral.
Catalunya Square is 2 minutes away where the main tour buses stop.   We had 2 suites on the 7th floor,  the rooms are fine but I expected a little more from a ""5 star"" hotel.  The walls are NOT sound proof at all and we could hear our neighbors quite clearly (conversations, TV noise, toilet/shower, etc...)....a major distraction especially when one tried to catch some sleep after an exhausting day in the city.   The lobby staff were nice and very helpful.",3,2009,07,22
37,"Wonderful staff, great location","From check-in through check out, the entire staff was so helpful during my stay....maps, directions, free passes to a local gym, Barcelona restaurant advice and help with reservations.  There is a business center with four computers and a printer which are free for guests to use, as well as a fitness center in the lower level.  The rooms are a good size, have blackout shades, and the beds are very comfortable.  The location is right off la rambla, so it's central and easy to walk to all of the different neighborhoods.  There's even a starbucks and supermarket, and quite a few great restaurants nearly right outside the door!",4,2009,07,19
37,Chic Hotel on Las Ramblas,"My wife and I spent 6 nights at the Meridien- Our room, facing the back, was dead quiet, which is amazing given the crowds on Las Ramblas (which is analogous to staying at the Barcelona-equivalent of Times Square).  The service, especially from the Concierge staff was excellent and the general level of service very high.  Free wifi in the lobby, which is a nice contrast to expensive wifi in the rooms.  Walking distance to a number of interesting locations including the Gothic quarter.  Furthermore, I was using Starwood points, and was treated extremely well.

My only disappointment was the number of fast food restaurants on Las Ramblas, ranging from Burger King to Starbucks (everywhere in Barcelona) to Subway to KFC.  The antidote was walking into the neighborhoods off of Las Ramblas, where more traditional restaurants are plentiful.",5,2009,07,18
37,"Not up to Starwood usual standards, but great room and location","What a disappointment on arrival.  Queued at check in desk (which seem to be woefully inadequte) for twenty five minutes, checked in and had the money taken, then was told that my room wasn't available and they didn't have another that I could take.  Others were being told the same thing, it all seemed so disorganised.  All they could offer was a drink at the bar, which is pretty useless when you have a business meeting to attend and want to freshen up after travelling.

Bar staff were difficult to find and didn't seem to want to serve guests.  Then the guy with the builder's electric tools fired up, not two metres from our table.  You wouldn't expect that anywhere, let aone a Starwood.

The room ,when I did finally get it (three hours later after more queuing and trouble explaining that I HAD already checked in) was excellent.  Well fitted out, good facilities, superb bathroom and walk in shower.  I loved the automatic low level night lights, quiet air con.  Disliked dirty bath towels that smelled awful (both of them) and no free water in the room, you have to pay 4 euros for that from the minibar.

Great location as others have said, if you want to look around Barcelona it doesn't get much better and I've stayed in the city maybe twenty five times now - this was perfect for an evening stroll or early morning walk to the harbour.

Breakfast?  Don't waste your time, 25 euros for something that just doesn't live up to Starwood standards.  Is this really a Starwood hotel?  And in case you think you'll take the Illy cheap breakfast, I don't think so.

Check out took almost as long as check in, mid-morning and fifteen minutes to get out.  They need more staff, friendly preferably and better organisation too.

Is it worth a return visit?  Hard to say, it did have some very good points.",3,2009,07,16
37,Very modern- great location!,"We stayed at the Meridien for 2 nights after a Mediterranean cruise. The location of this hotel is probably its best asset- it is right on Las Ramblas and in the center of everything that the Barcelona tourist needs to see. It's within walking distance from everything.  There are restaurants all along Las Ramblas so it is never difficult to find a place to eat- Starbucks is a block away if you get like us and need a little ""taste from home"" every once in a while.  There is a really interesting market (about 5 minutes walking) where it seems that the locals shop- it was a neat way to get a look into local culture.  The Gothic Quarter, the Port of Barcelona and eveything else very close.
The hotel itself is very nice- ours was a standard room and it was plenty big for my husband and I.  Everything is very modern- the bathroom was beautiful and all of the amenities are there (what you would find in a similar American room).  We did have breakfast at the cafe located in the lobby one morning- cappuccino, fruit, croissants, etc. which was good but the restaurant charges outrageous prices so we did not try it, although it did look good.  
The staff was a bit aloof- didn't seem to care very much about going out of their way to be accommodating and we had a bit of a hard time checking in even though we had all of our reservation documentation ready.  We were being helped by a trainee (who hadn't had much training) and she had to call over a supervisor- as soon as he found out it was our honeymoon he kindly offered us a honeymoon suite for an extra 150 euros a night but after being overseas for 10 days already- that was a little pricey when added to what we were already paying.  
All in all was it a 5 star hotel?  No.  We've stayed in several 5 stars (in the states, at least) and this hotel did not compare.  However, it was modern, clean, and in a great location.  I would give it 4 stars respectively.",4,2009,07,14
37,Location and stylish comfort,"You will be right in the heart of it all...we walked out the doors and took about 10 steps to be right in the middle of Las Ramblas, and only another few feet you can be in the Bari Gothic area.  It is sooooooo convenient.  La Boqueria is a block away, which is great for breakfast.  The hotel itself is decorated in modern decor, which is very fresh and new.  Loved the blue light that illuminated the floor of the room if you got up in the middle of the night.  Bathroom was very nice- great shower.  Bed- very comfortable.  No view, but who wants to stay in their room in Barcelona anyway?  Overall a great choice for enjoying the city.",5,2009,07,11
37,"Perfect Location, Small Suite","Positive:  Very chic decor.  Quiet & elegant.  Although this hotel is in a very busy location you will not hear any street noise.  The very best feature of this hotel was the location.  Right on La Rambla, walking distance to everything.  Negative:  We upgraded to a suite, and I cannot imagine the size of a standard room.  The entire space was probably about 400 sq ft.  Everything was very compact with miniature furniture.",4,2009,07,11
37,"Location, Location, and small rooms","The location of the hotel on La Rambles can't be beat, at least if your in town for pleasure and not business.  Your in the ""old town"" and can walk to the main shopping center in five or six minutes.  THe harbor is about a 10 to 15 minute walk.  THe subway is close by and taxis are easy to find out front.

I found the room we stayed in to be stylish and well organized but a bit small.  THe fact that our bathroom did not have a tub disappointed me though otherwise it was fine.  I don't quite understand some of the other reviews that rave about the shower.  The gym, like our room was functional but small.

I liked the business certer, I was almost always able to find a free computer and quickly log on to catch up with email.  I disliked breakfas which I found expensive and not particulary good.  We had one breakfast in the hotel which was a mistake but found any number of good inexpensive breakfast spots within a three minute walk from the hotel.  As others have mentioned a grocery is located on Rambles about two minutes away.

Other pluses are a good english speaking staff and the fact that the rooms are very well insulated - you don't hear any street noise unless you open your window.

I liked the hotel but  not so much that were I to return I would  neglect to check out the Hotel 1898, right across the street to see if I could get a similar or better deal.",4,2009,07,09
37,"Great hotel, great value!","This hotel is excellent. We booked the room directly from the Starwood Hotels website and the price was absolutely convenient for a 4 stars hotel, which in fact could even be considered as a 5 star one. Very kind service, room whith very modern and classy furnitures, great bathroom and excellent position. The hotel seems to be recently renewed and we do not have any negative comment to add!",5,2009,07,05
37,Great location for tourist visit.,"Le Meridien Barcelona location on Las Ramblas is right in the middle of everything! It was within walking distance to everything you want to see. We couldn't have asked for greater assistance from front desk staff, backroom staff or concierge.   We stayed both before and after a cruise.  It was a 25 minute ride to airport and about 10 minutes from cruise ship.  Taxi price varies depending if the cab knows the back route in since Las Ramblas turnaround is not easy once you go past it from south to turn onto street where hotel is located 50 yards from the main street.  Our rooms were very reminiscent of ""W"" chain, not gigantic, but feature stylish bathrooms,  huge flat screen television but they are lacking in choice other than financial, Spanish or German channels, plus it does come with the trademark dark rooms and hallways.   Staff speak excellent English and  was exceptionally friendly and went out of the way to help us with recommendations, advice and directions. The lilly cafe in the lobby for morning coffee is wonderful unless you like the free nescafe in the room.  Internet free downstairs from main lobby.  We had one breakfast in the hotel and the buffet was fabulous if a bit pricey (no complaint on the quality however).  There is no pool and the gym room is standard albeit a bit small.   If you want a great, secure, upscale location for a tourist visit this is the place for you.",5,2009,06,30
37,Best located hotel..right on la rambla and friendly & attentive staff,"I stayed with my partner and 1 year old son for 5 nights at the Le Meridien.  We checked in around 2pm but our room wasnt ready and was told to wait for about an hour so housekeeping can freshen up the room.  I really did not want to wait that long so the lady upgraded us to the Prestige Suite which was really nice of her, this was room 814.  The room was excellent, all facilities were there, my request for a crib and for some space in the minbar to store my sons fresh milk were all accomodated for.  I did feel the room was a little bit outdated compared to some of the photos i saw on their website which had modernised rooms...originally i booked a junior suite.  Concierge,front desk and door men were all helpful.  Room service and housekeeping were very friendly and very attentive.  The hotel didnt have a spa or much facilities in the hotel, breakfast was at 25 euros per person which i thought was really bad so ate out in the cafes along la ramblas.  Location is perfect...could not ask for a better place..round the corner from the supermarket..along la ramblas near the beach and everything else etc..overall we enjoyed my stay at the le meridien but i would rate this hotel a 4 star and not a 5 star...",5,2009,06,11
37,Right on Las Rambles,"We spent three nights at this hotel, starting on May 24th, in room 206.  The positives were as follows: 1) we arrived at about 13:00 and were able to check in immediately; 2) our room, despite fronting on Los Rambles, was very quite and stylish; 3) the hotel has as excellent business center with free internet connections; 4) the location is probably what every tourist is looking for in that the historic district, the waterfront, and the big department stores are all within easy walking distance.

I found the rooms and the gym both to be on the small side for a five star hotel and while the shower, as reported, was nice I would have preferred, and I note their was room for, a tub and shower in the bathroom.  My big problem with the hotel was breakfast which I found simply bad.  We actually cancelled part of our order the one day we ate in the hotel.  As I was not on a plan that included breakfast this was not much of a problem as one can walk 50 yards in any direction and find a cafe where for 6 or 7 euros one can have a wonderful breakfast.

The bed was fine as was the lighting in the room and i have to say once again that I was impressed how quite the room was given that we had windows on Los Rambles.  While I am not sure I would stay in this part of town were I to return to Barcelona I would recommend the hotel to anyone going to Barcelona as a tourist who does want to stay in the ""old town"".  I would also recommend Attic right across the street as a place to dine and second the suggestion elsewhere that if one wants to pick up snacks at the Carrfors store just about 40 yards to the north on Los Rambles.

I found the staff helpful and when I question a room service charge they removed it from my bill.  Checking out when as quickly as the check in and cabs to the airport were immediately available.",4,2009,06,09
37,Hotel has an ego problem,"The location is five star.  The room was small - the bed was comfortable - and bathroom average size.  The hotel staff needs to be reminded that their location will not carry them forever.  They did as little as possible - and most of the time with an attitude.  Offered no information on amenities and had to be quizzed as to locations of business center ... 
They did mention their restaurant!  Will look for another hotel when visiting Barcelona.",3,2009,06,07
37,Lovely,"First off the location of the hotel is amazing, you are literally on top of Las Ramblas and in close vicintiy of everything you would want to see as a tourist. Subway is 5 minutes away and buses, cabs are vereywhere. The hotel is set off on the side so you may miss it if you walk up on Ramblas. It was an easy check-in and the front staff was pleasant. I booked us a suite since it was our anniversary and that had a terrace, our Room 816 was amazing. We counldn't see much of the street (trees) but sitting out there in the morning with a cup of coffee was one of the best ways to start our days. The hotel is very modern (black and red) and comtemporary, they had free internet service on the bottom floor and the fitness center were great add-ons. I ran in the gym a couple of times and no one even walked in so you get lots of privacy. There are really close places to eat so breakfast and lunch are not an issue (room service is way to expensive). There is also a Starbuck around the corner.  I did have to ask for extra pillows and an iron (odd requests but really needed). Le Merdiain gives you an email for you to request anything you may need before your arrival, take full advantage of that, I did. I had mentioned to them it was my b-day and anniversay and we had champagne waiting for us, that was a nice touch on the first day. Plus I was pretty adamant about getting a nice room since we payed the full rate. 

I would only say about that the staff, although pleasant  there wasn't any more than that. The concierge needed more training, he looked frazzled everytime we asked him something, one suggestion turned out amazing, the Cuidad Condal (love the tapas) and he was more surprised then us that we loved it haha. The staff really didn't do more then what they were paid to do and anything over that wasn't extended. It was really a rather cold hospitable enviroment, I wish sometimes they were warner to their guests. I have stayed at other Le Meridians were the staff went well beyond what I expected, if you go you need to know this. You will try to get that side out and you will not see it, it became frustrating but overall I think it was one of the best hotels that I could have chosen for us.",4,2009,06,04
37,"Good location, decent hotel","My wife and I stayed at the Le Meridien this past week for 1 night prior to our cruise of the mediterranean.  I booked the hotel using SPG points and was hoping the central location would be helpful in trying to see as much of the city in 24 hours as possible.  On the positive side the location was great, the large bathroom and tv' were nice, and the complimentary coffee & free business center were also nice perks.  On the down side the rooms are a bit small, the first floor room afforded us little ambient light in our room, the water temperature in the shower would not stay constant, elevators were tiny, there was a long wait for checkout on Sunday morning, and it took 25 minutes to hail a cab shortly after noon on Sunday May 23rd (we got outside and we were 7th in line behind other guests of our hotel for a cab plus we had to compete for cabs with 2 other hotels on the same street).  I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a great location.  If looking for luxury, I'd shop around.",3,2009,06,01
37,Nice hotel,"Le Merdien Barcelona is a nice hotel, conveniently located.  The rooms are beautifully done but small.  It's location while convenient is on the Rambla which is noisy with a lot going on at all hours of the day and night.  Fortunately the entrance to the hotel  is off the Rambla and the hotel windows are super insulators of noise (i.e. none can be heard).   The hotel staff is friendly and very helpful.  Breakfast was pricey but fabulous...can't get much better.  We had dinner at the hotel one evening - the tsaing menu was fantastic.  The hotel's fitness center had all the equipment that you would expect of a hotel in this price range.  

This is a very nice hotel in a beautfiful city - but pricey.",4,2009,05,30
37,Accmodates early check in & convenient location,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights as a part of our honeymoon trip.  Our flight arrived early in the morning around 9 am.  We were able to check in at that time.  Since it was early, the room given to us was on a smoking floor.  We asked the staff if we could swtich room after more rooms are available, we were able to do so with no problem.  They were accomodating and the staffs are nice & polite.  The location is convenient.  A supermarket is steps away, and a traditional market is nearby.  It is short walk to a major plaza where all the tourist bus stops.   The hotel has 3 course lunch for $15 Euro (including drink), which was pretty decent.  On one of the nights, a soccer game ended and people were cheering on the street around 2 am.  It was loud and noisy at that time.  Otherwise, the hotel is quiet.",5,2009,05,27
37,Hello from room 139 - it is dark,"I have to type fast as these cheap business hotel that trips to be hip has three expensive plans for Internet access and I took the cheapest one at Euro 6 for 30 minutes.  I am in room 139 which faces the interior roof and this window faces the raised sky light that shings sun into the lobby.  No sun for me in this hovel.  The hotel tries to be hip and modern but really should not try and just do its job.

Staff are nice (concierge, bellman, etc.) but girl at desk had the personality of card board.  We arrived Saturday when Las Ramblas was closed due to a football victory celebration and walked blocks with our luggage.  I joked about it when she said no one was free to take my bags to my room so I would have to do so.   

Lilly coffee in lobby is good but rest of lobby tries to be a lounge type club and that is not what I want or the other guests I see want.

Odd house cleaning tip.  They turn on the big flat screen tv in the bedroom at a loud volume and leave it on for your return.  The smaller one in the bath is left off but they replace soap gel (no bars here) with more moisturizer so on day 2 I went to the store to buy champagne and soap since all I had was moisturizer.   They had those note cards you put on the bed if you want linens changed.  I put it on the bed as they felt dirty when I first checked in and the linen was not changed and note card not replaced or left for me for day two.   I guess it is to be environmentally friendly but I have to say that the showrer head uses more water than my washing machine at home.  They have a hand  held jet plus one of those big heads that waste gallons.

I have stated at the Hilton and Arts in this town before.  Location is good but there is a lot of competition and for what I am getting I would stay at a cheaper place near here nextt tie.",2,2009,05,25
37,The Complete Package,"First class hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  Location: Excellent. On la Rambla near Placa Catalunya and a major subway station. Close walk to everything - the market (Boqueria), the Cathedral in Barri Gotic, Placa Reial, Casa Batllo, and grocery store.  Midway between Parc Montjuic and Barceloneta.  Amenities: High end restaurant, Illy cafe, fitness centre, and meeting rooms. WiFi available throughout the hotel and in-rooms - 20 euros per day.  Rooms: We had a superior and it was excellent - modern design with 42"" plasma, desk, chair, small table on wheels, armoir, double closet, and juliette balcony. Slate bathroom with tub and shower and additional TV. Robes included. We were on the 2nd floor facing the street and it was noisy - not noisy enough to wake you but it would keep you awake if you were awakened. If you want peace and quiet then choose an interior courtyard room. We had a small problem with ""fruit"" flies in our room but did not detract from the overall quality of the product.",4,2009,05,19
37,great location but wildly overpriced and wildly disappointing,"The good things- great location in the heart of Barcelona, fantastic city (but also located in  las ramblas ""pickpocket row""- so watch out as they are VERY good and they ""did"" 4 people this week I was with- a regular occurence in Barcelona tho), easy walking distances of shops, some gaudi buildings, a happening area with lots of buskers and street entertainment!
It also has a sport's bar (v useful to watch chelsea v barcelona)- altho prob not so good for those wanting quiet dinner in adjacent restaurant.
rainforest showers are v good in the rooms. coffee making facils but stainless steel cups (yeuk).
Staff in reception are friendly - but typical of a 4-5 star hotel...

The downside:
I just  (reluctantly) paid 250- 300 euros/ a night! (rate varied- more for the w/end rate) for what I deem to be a 4 star hotel with zero atmosphere and zero style (unless you like really minimalist style). Few amenities, no outside space- Barce weather is great so roof top terrace/outside bar is needed. Nothing. A fairly depressing restaurant with mediocre choice (same re room service menu)  and clinical coffee bar.. (altho there are plenty of places around, partic fast food and also tapas places nearby- and great fish restaurants in the marina- a taxi ride away tho).

The room I had was a deluxe room- hilarious!  I hate to think what the standard ones are like! Mine was very small, grim, grey and brown decor with 2 bright red seats (felt like it shld have been a van gogh painting...), with a very small window letting in little light, an (awful) view of peoples' washing and a derelict building/wall... The moment I walked in my heart sank and I wanted to walk out... I hated it.  Very masculine, perhaps designed for businessmen arriving late and leaving early? The bathroom was also dark and very grey- altho the rainforest shower is a nice touch.

The rooms were only made up late afternoon- not a major issue but other hotels would have this done first half of the day. 

I am afraid I would not recommend this to anyone! unless you can get a really cheap rate and cannot find anywhere else. I wld try the Arts if having to pay top bucks as for this kind of rate- you will get much better facils and a great location by the sea.  I also spotted the majectic hotel near a gaudi building - which looked like it had a roof top terrace and pool. Colleagues stayed out at the Hilton (fine if at conference but both Hiltons are in the middle of nowhere so again- not recommended).",2,2009,05,09
37,Great Location,"Location is perfect, however air conditioner did not work in our room (we opened the window & we were on the quiet side) nor in our son's room (they were on the street side & too noisy to open the window).  They called downstairs 5 times during the night for someone to come fix the a.c.  Also spoke to another couple (their a.c. did not work either)..If you stay here, make sure the a.c. is working condition in the room.  The reception staff were all excellent.  There is a large room with enough computers (complimentary)...",4,2009,05,05
37,Not for us,"What were we thinking? We booked this hotel for three reasons: (1) starwood membership perks (2) TripAdvisor reviews (3) room rates were 50% off. 

The rooms are large, but the hotel is lacking a roof-top deck or other relaxing areas to escape the hubbub. Also, the walls are paper thin. During our first few minutes, we were immediately struck by noises coming from other rooms – children crying, a couple arguing, and someone else’s tv.  

However, the staff was great. They showed us alternate rooms right away. We chose an un-renovated top-floor room – very out-dated, but deliciously quiet with a view.

Next time, we’ll pick a different hotel.",3,2009,05,03
37,"Very good hotel, great location","Le Meridien Barcelona is your typical luxury Le Meridien property with a hint of Barcelona style.  The rooms are very nice, not gigantic, but feature nice bathrooms, lovely hardwood finishings, huge flat screen television and the wonderful beds that are a Starwood signature.  Staff was impeccably friendly and went out of the way to help us with recommendations, advice and directions.  Nice cafe in the lobby for morning coffee.  It's fairly American - all the people I saw/heard in the lobby seemed to be Americans.  If you can get a good rate, this is a great place to stay for a tourist weekend in Barcelona.  It's location on Las Ramblas is right in the middle of everything!  Very safe and within walking distance to everything you want to see.  We couldn't have asked for anything more.",4,2009,05,02
37,Very nice stay,"We stayed at Le Meridien four nights in April. The hotel is located at the Rambla very close to Placa Catalunya so it took us less than ten minutes to walk from the busstop (shuttlebus from the airport) to the hotel.
The reception desk offered swift service with a genuine smile and continued to be very serviceminded through out our visit - very knowledgeable as well.
The room was not the biggest we have stayed in, but it had recently been renovated so everything was in perfect order and with trendy design but above all the room was clean and inviting. Even though we stayed on the first floor we never noticed the noise from the street below.  So everything is as you should expect from a 5-star hotel.
We were very pleased with the location of the hotel - it is close to almost everything - it is just a short walk to the narrow streets of Barri Gothic, to the food market and to the harbour.",4,2009,04,26
37,Le Meridien Barcelona,"We stayed at the Le Meridien in Barcelona with our 7 year old from April 8th through April 12th. It was a great stay as the location was unbeatable.My daughter's only compalaint was that the TV in the room did not have any disney or cartoon network. 
The hotel is on Las Ramblas right where the action is. Everything was accessible very easily including taking the Metro. Taxis were available every where and were plentiful. Also the shops were waling distance from the hotel.
  Unfortunately we were there during the holy week so 2 days many things were closed. But it was still a wonderful trip. I would stay there again if I visited Barcelona again.",4,2009,04,23
37,Fantastic hotel but unfriendly staff,"Could not fault the hotel itself.  The room was large with loads of mod cons including a TV in the bathroom.  There were lots of different lights and also sensors somewhere near the bed so that during the night, soft blue lights lit to direct you to the bathroom.  

The staff were not friendly or helpful.  Only interested in clients who would obviously tip well. 

Check your bill.  We looked on the screen in the room and had been charged 11 euros for things taken from the minibar (the electronic type which we are quite familiar with), the first from the day before we arrived !  Had to explain FOUR times before it was taken off and reluctantly, at that.

Had pre-booked a meal in the restaurant but there is so much in the immediate area that we decided to cancel as 33 euros each seemed quite excessive even though the food did look lovely.  Breakfast was 25 euros each !  As you can imagine, we didnt bother with that - just popped down Ramblas to one of the many other venues offering a decent breakfast at a fraction of the cost.

Overall, I think we got a good deal at Le Meridien.  We paid £110 per night for room only - should have been around £230 but I wouldnt have paid that much.  It is not the best Meridien we've stayed at but it was fine for a four night break, mainly for the lovely room but mostly for the fantastic location and for these reasons I probably would go again.",4,2009,04,14
37,Excellent,"Wonderful location for Metro, Market, people watching. Close to the Gothic area.The hotel was modern and spacious. We got an excellent rate for our 5 night stay. They even sent up a bottle of Cava and free expresso coupons...Lovely staff and our room was even ready when we arrived at 10:00 am. I loved our baloney. We had a spacious Mediterean Suite...Huge mod bathroom. Huge dressing area with double closet. Perfect..No surprises..",5,2009,04,10
37,fantastic!,"stayed 4 nites with husband and enjoyed it thoroughly. location is prime to everything you want to see and do. 
hotel has much-appreciated fitness center adjacent to business center and staff was very helpful.
room was chic and well-decorated and there is a great market (la boqueria) and grocery store (carrefour) closeby for your fresh food and pharmacy needs respectively.
everything was great (but the weather -- it was cold and drizzly).",5,2009,04,07
37,One of My Favorite Hotels in THE WORLD,"This hotel is excellent for many reasons. The most important one being its prime location within walking distance of most of the major Barcelona attractions. Furthermore, from a young adult's perspective... this hotel is right in the middle of the action of Las Ramblas. It's the classiest bastion of calm and luxury in a very lively part of town. To be honest I think this hotel is in a better location, has much more character, and is more charming than either The Arts Hotel (Ritz Carlton) or The Majestic (I've stayed at the Majestic and ventured inside of the Arts). The icing on the cake is one of the best hotel restaurants I've ever been to. In fact, Cent Onze is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. My meal there literally blew me away (food euphoria) and I've been craving their gastronomical delights ever seen I left Barcelona. In a town of incredible food, Cent Onze is right there at the top so be sure not to miss it or you will be missing out. Stay at the Le Meridien for a truly gratifying experience. I'll be returning in May!",5,2009,03,31
37,Great Location and Excellent Service,"Just returned from a 4 nights stay at Le Meridien. The location is so convenient to everything. We only had to take a cab to/from theairport. All the major sites are accessible by walking or a short metro ride away (5 mins walking to Plaza Catalunya). The rooms are a bit on the smaller side...but it's typical in Europe. Bathroom was set up nicely and there was plenty of space for you luggage to rest without being in the way. It's right on Las Ramblas so if you open your window, it can get a bit noisey. All the resturants the concierge recommended were great. Plenty of food and shopping around the hotel. Almost forgot to mention the free use of 4 pc's with internet access in the biz center.",4,2009,03,28
37,loved this hotel great location,"Stayed here with my daughter for 3 nights and loved it.
Staff were very friendly.
Food was excellent; simple but good is how i would describe it.
location was excellent.
The hotel I think has been recently renovated and the ipod docking station was a nice touch.
We will be back",4,2009,03,26
37,Perfect,"Just back from four nights at the Meridien Barcelona. It was a great experience start to finish.. It was my fifth stay in  Barcelona but my first in this hotel. Definitely the best location, best facilities and most helpful staff you could find. A special world for Noella at the desk who sorted me out on a trip to Codorniu when the actual concierge was not yet on duty.   Highly recommend a stay here.",5,2009,03,24
37,"Location, location, location","Went to Barcelona with my wife and 3 kids. Stay at Le Meridien was great. The staff was very helpful, and multilingual. Front desk people were all very nice. Made us feel welcommed and although I could not get a room connected to be next to my kids, they provided me with a more elegant suite (prestige). The ambiance of this hotel is great, modern feel inside. The rooms are large for european standards and impecable keep.
Location is perfect and can't be better than this hotel. Everything is located at your steps, including the metro station is only a couple of blocks away. As well as Plaza Catalunya (where all derives)
I requested a taxi very early on our departure, at about 4 am and got it without problems. Unlike other reviews in this thread
Would definitively go back next time.",5,2009,03,19
37,Great location and big beds,"We stayed for 4 nights, hotel was modern and easy access, front of hotel is on La Ramblas but the entrance is on a nice side street, so you don’t fell like a tourist walking right out onto the main thorough fare.  
We had room 245, view wasn’t great but we left the window open at night, for in the middle of the city we never heard a sound.  When you get out of your bed censored lights active.  Big flat TV in bedroom and small one in bathroom, huge wet room. There is a glass door into the bathroom so you need to comfortable with the person your staying with.  We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel, so we really didn’t get the full feel for the hotel.  Downsides: They were a bit curt when I asked to book a taxi the morning of your departure saying it was impossible because of the marathon before asking what time we would need a taxi for, which was 7am. 2nd downside our room keys didn’t work 2-3 times and when I went to reception, they asked me for ID (they could have just asked for confirmation of my name or address).  Compared to an Irish 5* hotel more of a 4.5*.
Hotel 1898 is across from the way, looks very nice, they have a FABULOUS oriental restaurant which was buzzing every night, we went 2 nights it was so good, not just the food but the atmosphere.
Go to Barcelona you’ll love it.",4,2009,03,19
37,Perfect Hotel for Barcelona Visit,"My fiance and i visited barcelona for the first time at this wonderfully modern and comfortable hotel.  Upon arrival in our taxi we were greeted by attentive, expeditious doorman.  We checked in at around 11AM with no problem, even though check in is for 2PM.  The hotel room is great and nice size for a European hotel.  The bed is super comfortable and with the blinds drawn and the ""no noise windows"", we ended up sleeping until noon most days. The location is perfect right on Las Ramblas, near Plaza Catalunya, where you can shop/eat/catch the hop on and off bus tour, and the other direction is the harbor, great seafood restaurants.  The staff were so helpful, directed us to their favorite personal restaurants, where we had wonderful meals, and showed us the best spots to party and chill at night.  The business center downstairs was perfect and never busy so checking emails, etc was very easy.  Danae is the  most helpful hotel staff person that i have ever encountered in my travels, very friendly, and very very helpful.  Last but certainly not least were the bathrooms.  This hotel gained any and all extra points because of the WONDERFUL showers and spacious bathroom.  The Rainfall showerhead along with the moveable showerhead proved to be the most comfortable and best way to wind down after a full day of walking and being tourist in a big walking city.  The showers were so relaxing we took as many as three a day!!!  Only downfall is no spa, but to be honest, you dont miss it with your shower accomodation here...and i dont think barcelona is a city for spa treatments, more for site seeing and good food.",5,2009,03,16
37,Choose this hotel for all of the right reasons,"This hotel for our vacation was a true find. It's obvious its location is a huge asset, (as referred to in many previous reviews), but what we found that was truly more valuable was its people. We, (my wife and I) had never been to Barcelona before. Of course we 'walked the streets in 'Google Earth' and researched the where, what, how and when' of everything that was of interest to us with all the online tools available. And it's true we initially began to consider the 'Le Meridien Barcelona' because of its location and 'flag'. but as all of us who get the chance to travel internationally know, no matter the 'prep', the 'being there' is always a 'little' different, and that’s where this hotel shines. No question asked was treated lightly, and always our expectations were exceeded. I know this is an overused phrase, but in this case its truly justified. From its iPod audio guides, to its quality of product, the staff truly captured our attention and appreciation. Should we make it back to Barcelona, (still a long list of new destinations to go to first) we will seek out this hotel again, and I'm proud to recommend it to any of my friends should they get the opportunity to go to Barcelona.",5,2009,03,12
37,Stylish and Convenient Base,"The hotel is on the Ramblas and access to the bus-stop to the airport is just a 5-minute walk.The staff were friendly and efficient. We were on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor and requested another room, which we were offered promptly.  They are very helpful in terms of bookings for events, etc.
The rooms are quiet, roomy, modern and stylishly representative of the feeling of this city, while the hotel structure itself still preserves the original  'Modernisme' ambience.
We didn't eat at the restaurant, but there are numerous choices on the Ramblas or the side-streets nearby. Exploring the variety of restaurants and cuisines is one of the great delights of Barcelona. The hotel has free internet access for hotel guests downstairs, which is another great plus. Access from your room via LAN-cable was 6 Euro/30 mins. 
The location on the Ramblas makes this a perfect base to explore. There are Metro stations in close proximity. The Metro trains are cheap, clean and punctual; and have an extensive network.
The Carrefour around the corner has everything one might need at reasonable prices.
Overall, I believe this is one of the best choices for accommodation in  Barcelona.

On a last note, and people probably have told you this numerous times before; however, while the hotel is perfectly safe and guarded, one can not be careful enough anywhere in Barcelona. It is a wonderful city, but unfortunately rife with scam artists and thieves. Hold on to your belongings. Do not trust anyone and if anyone approaches you, just walk away quickly. You have been warned!",5,2009,03,05
37,Excellent Location,"Stayed at this hotel as I was attending a conference in the hotel.  Le Meridien has cleverly managed to update the interiors of the rooms to spectacularly modern style, within an old building.  The rooms are excellent, with interesting touches - such as the emergency floor level lighting, and fantastic bathrooms.

Located on Las Ramblas, the hotel is perfectly situated for getting around Barcelona - although on arrival I managed to walk past the hotel at least twice without noticing it, as it is the restaurant which faces onto Las Ramblas - the entrance is on a side street.

This is a good hotel, although very expensive.  I felt the restaurant and bar were small for the size of hotel, but there are many many bars and restaurants nearby, so maybe its not important?  Breakfast was good, but again for the price of the hotel, could have been better / more imaginative.

I liked the hotel, but know there are better in Barcelona...",4,2009,02,04
37,Nice location.,"We stayed at the Meridien for a few days before New Years.  The rooms were nice and clean.  We primarily enjoyed the location.
It is right next to the gothic quarter and two blocks from the metro station which is easy, quick (you never wait more than a few minutes for a train), and the Ravel area.  Around the corner is a great hot chocolate shop, one of the oldest in Barcelona.  The only thing missing was a nice pool and spa to relax in at the end of the days of touring.",4,2009,01,01
37,Perfect for the business traveller,"I had the most comfortable and uneventful stay at Le Meridian, exactly what you you want when you're travelling on business.  Taxis appeared instantly, I forgot my adapter and the staff were so helpful getting a new one and the best touch was the weird blue light that automatically went on when you got up at night.",5,2008,12,12
37,Le Meridien is Wonderful,"Le Meridien Barcelona was a fantastic hotel. I enjoyed my stay there a great deal and had a lovely room with a large veranda. It was an absolute pleasure. The hotel is centrally located on Las Ramblas and made it easy to get around the city. The concierge and hotel staff were polite and helpful. The quality of the rooms was quite good as I saw two separate rooms when I needed to switch to a larger room as I had a friend flying in. Overall an excellent hotel. While on the expensive side, it really made my stay there that much better.",5,2008,12,05
37,Fantastic hotel,Only problem is lack of gym,5,2008,12,02
37,Awesome Stay!,"LOCATION: Great location relative to all that can be seen in Barcelona. Close to Metro stations. La Ramblas can get a bit noisy, but you don't hear the noise when you're in the room.

ROOM: Newly renovated. Modern. Very clean. Comfortable bed. Good amenities in the bathroom. Flat screen TV.

CITY: Awesome! Barcelona is one of our favorite cities in Europe. Don't miss any of the Gaudi architecture; La Pedrera, Casa Batillo, Parc Guell, or Sagrada Familia. Take the cable car from the port to the Montijuic.

FOOD/DINING: Didn't eat the hotel restaurant because the city has many good choices. Although, the menu at the hotel looked good. Prices seemed reasonable.",5,2008,11,16
37,Really liked this hotel,Fantastic location. We had a renovated room which was modern and beautiful. Had to have the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The staff was exceptionally friendly. We didn't use the dining room as we found it quite pricey but there are tons of places to eat in the area.....and a Starbucks just 50 yrds away.,5,2008,11,07
37,did not regret the choice,"Hotel has great ramblas location with short walk both ways - either to the sea or opposit to Passeig Gracia with shops. We enjoyed the design of the hotel. New, modern, exactly what Barcelona is about. In terms of food they offer limited but very high quality breakfast as well as a la carte lunch and dinners. What was not so nice it was the impression of the lobby. It was weird as reception area being very crowdy at any time being too small comparing to empty lounge area on the other side of entrance. We booked deluxe room but as we arrived in rainy day and forecast predicted more of it during our stay we asked for upgrade (reading all the reviews here about small size of these rooms). As SPG gold no upgrade was offered/possible but when I asked if paid upg is possible it was immediately available to every higher category. We went for Prestige suite with a 150Eur additionaly and did not regret these extra money. Suite had Ramblas view, huge flat TV, Bose system, huge bathroom etc.... Great refugium after some wet escapades in rainy city...",4,2008,10,18
37,Watch Your Wallet and Check Your Bill!,"The location is the best part of this hotel. The service is very indifferent and the modernistic rooms are fine if you like that sort of thing. However we will not return as they posted an outrageous bill for breakfast and would not reverse it. The restaurant was very crowded at breakfast and as we attempted to get our bill the manager assured us that it would be taken care of properly. When we checked out the bill for breakfast for 2 was close to $100. When we protested this they would not reverse the charge at checkout. 

Additionally throughout our stay we noticed that change left in our room had disappeared when we came back after the room was cleaned. I guess the maid thought this was her tip but I call it petty theft and these are the reasons we will not return to this property.",3,2008,10,08
37,Just OK for the price,"My family and I stayed in a Mediterranean Suite for 3 nights, and to begin with the location of Le Meridien is truly excellent--close to sightseeing spots and metro stations!
But other than that a few problems occured:
The telephones in the room were out of services and were not fixed. 
The suite lacked a plasma tv--a very mediocre CRO TV with poor video quality. 
The furniture in the room was worn out!
Concierge was not properly staffed.
Fairly friendly staff though
The terrace of the suite is a big plus--especially nice with sunny conditions.
When you are paying 500 Euro or so for a night, one would surely expect more from the hotel--probably the room amenities and decoration would be better in the renovated rooms--but still no excuse after the hotel has undergone a 30 million Euro revamp!

Overall so so experience, might try H1898 just next to Le Meridien next time.",2,2008,09,25
37,Simply stunning!,"My brother and I stayed at the Le Meridian for 4 nights and it was a fantastic choice. We looked at lots of luxury hotels in Barcelona but the location of this one sealed the deal and we weren't disappointed. It is a fantastic escape from the charismatic but noisy Ramblas whilst still retaining the feeling of being part of the action. 

The hotel has recently been refurbished and it oozes quality and style from every angle, including the very cool image mosaic on the doors and windows of the entrance, the futuristic lighting in the lobby, the Gaudi chairs at the concierge desk and the stunning Cent Onze restaurant and bar. 

We stayed in a twin deluxe room, which had one of the best showers I have ever experienced (perfect after a long day of trekking and sight seeing!), very comfortable beds, bathrobes, slippers, tea and coffee and a ridiculously large plasma television to name just a few (including a second flat screen in the bathroom!). The only negative was the over priced mini-bar but all the hotels I have been to are the same. 

Breakfast was superb with a huge selection to suit all tastes and diets. There is a chef on hand cooking eggs and crepes to your liking which we thought was a fantastic concept. Wonderful omelettes! 

We also dined in the restaurant which is pricey but the food is excellent as is the service. All the ingredients are bought fresh from the Boqueria market apparently! A three course meal with wine was around 65 euros each.

We found all the staff excellent. They were instantly helpful in reserving tables for dinner, calling taxis and making calls for us.

There is also a gym and business centre with free internet use.

I would definitely recommend it. We didn't want to leave!",5,2008,09,21
37,Excellent location,"I was travelling Europe with my mom this summer and I stayed at this hotel in Barcelona. It was the best location. The market was just so closes we went every morning. The staff were really friendly, they organised dinner for us and also got us two tickets to go and see the traditional dance. As we were travelling in August it was pretty hot so we went back to our rooms just to enjoy the aircon and also for naps.",4,2008,09,19
37,Rambla Rambler,"A superb hotel in an excellent location for exploring the centre of Barcelona. An outstanding room with a well-equipped bathroom and comfortable bed. Not an inspiring view, but other rooms looked on to Las Ramblas. A noisy night, but only spent the one, so this may not be the norm. Did not sample the breakfast. Not cheap.",4,2008,09,13
37,Great location on las Ramblas,"If you want to walk out the front door of a hotel and take a few steps to Las Ramblas..then Le Meridien is the hotel to consider.  It is a very contemporary (a bit too contemporary), clean and service attentive hotel.  The rooms are roomy and the bathrooms are quite large for a European hotel.  There is a free internet access business center on the lower lobby level which was wonderful...however, it is not monitored and quite often there are children playing internet games rather than adults using the internet for email.

A few blocks away there is a wonderful and reasonable restaurant; ""Les Quinze Nits"" which usually has a long line (it moves so be patient).  We loved it so much we ate there two nights.

The tourist bus stop is only a few blocks away in either direction from the hotel and a great way to see the sights since it is the ""hop on hop off"" bus.  All in all, a great location and a nice hotel!",4,2008,08,27
37,"Lovely hotel, very small rooms!","We stayed in Le Meridian for 2 nights in July 2008. originally booked 3 nights but changed to 2 due to the size of the room.
Overall - very nice 4 star hotel in excellent location right on La Rambla. 
Service- very friendly but not the most helpful.
Rooms - very nice, new but TINY. If you can book a deluxe room with sitting area (it could be classified as a suite; just check - all bigger rooms look onto La Rambla). Nice newish but again very small bathrooms. 
We'd recommend this hotel to friends but only in a bigger room category. Our opinion was that it is a nice business hotel, not so much a holiday experience.",4,2008,08,27
37,Location Trumps All,"LOCATION
It really can't be beat.  We took the Aerobus from the airport to Place de Catalunya for about 4.05 euros.  They are outside all terminals.  If the machine is broken, you can pay the driver.  Just be careful of pick pocketers when you get off at Catalunya.  Then, just walk down Las Ramblas a few blocks and it's on your right.  When getting around, Liceu metro stop may be a little closer than Catalunya.  The Touristic buses are really convenient though.  However, so easy to walk around.  You can walk to the water and Port Vell area in 20-30 minutes depending how captivated you are by the street performers.

ROOMS
They are still in the process of renovating the rooms.  We got a creepy, older suite.  We were on the 6th floor and the noise from Las Ramblas was tolerable - more like a background humble with occasional, random yelling in the night.

OTHER STUFF
Free internet in the business center.  Sorry, no lounges or breakfast for the Platinum people.  No pool.  Small gym though.

Enjoy Barcelona!!!  It ROCKS!!!",4,2008,08,20
37,Disappointed as a Platinum SPG member,Whe booked a room for 5 nights and were allocated a standard room (ie not an SPG room). I awoke during the night to what I thought was my husband snoring but it was actually  the guy in the room next door (it was not interconnecting room). Had a shocking  nights sleep. Complained and was then moved to an SPG room. I am not sure why we did not receive this initially as I am a Platinum member and I was charged for the room a month prior to our arrival. After asking why were not allocated an SPG room I was told it was due to a lack of availability (we were later told by another staff member that the hotel wasn't heavily booked).We were upgrade a recently renovated suite on the 1st floor. It was fabulous and very spacious with intimate views over La Rambla. Ended up being a great stay but we were ready to change hotels if we had not been moved.,3,2008,08,13
37,"Great location, would pick it again!","Even though the hotel was undergoing renovations they managed to do a great job of accomodating guests.  Our room was clean, modern with a large bathroom (even by American standards). The location right on the Ramblas was great, accessible to different restaurants and the subway.  The concierge was helpful and made good suggestions. They also have a business center with free internet access which was a great plus. 

 For sure you need to check out Can Majo' in the Barcelonetta. We went there for dinner the last night and had we tried it earlier in the trip I am not sure we would have eaten anywhere else. It was great and will be my first stop when I return to Barcelona!",5,2008,08,12
37,A great hotel in a great location,"The Hotel is located on La Rambla which is city centre with close access to shops and tour buses.

The room was immaculate with a 42"" plasma screen and even a screen in the bathroom.

There was nice blue ambient lighting in the room with good amenities.

The bathroom was large and well equipped.

Concierge and staff overall were very friendly and very helpful and recommended a lot of restaurants and night spots to visit which were absolutely wonderful.

There is a business centre to use for free and open 24 hours.

The only thing I disliked was the face that the in-room safe was a bit small and did not fit my laptop.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2008,08,11
37,Loved the hotel,"We just returned from a cruise that left from Barcelona and we stayed at this hotel for two nights before the cruise left. After the cruise, we had one more night in Barcelona before our flight back to the states and there was no doubt that we would return to this hotel. It is very modern and clean. Our room did not face La Rambla which is what we wanted. It was very quiet and we were able to catch up on our sleep. Check in was a pleasure. Everyone spoke English and all were very helpful. We needed to call the airlines and the concierge let us use his phone at no charge (we waited on the line for 30 minutes for the airline to answer). The hotel is in a great location. Be sure to check out the sink in the woman's bathroom off the lobby. Also, good luck figuring out the lights in the room.",5,2008,08,07
37,"Nice, but not 5 star","All and all a nice hotel, but lacking the extras that make a 5 star hotel by US or EU standards.   I would stay again, but would not pay the advertised tariffs.",3,2008,07,31
37,"A hotel that defines the term ""uneven""","There is so much to like about the Meridien, from its central location on the Ramblas in Barcelona to the friendly staff. But there is almost as much to disappointment, from poorly maintained rooms (I had two major water leaks in my two visits) to its lack of a pool and terrace, which are important in a city that  boasts 200-plus days of sun a year. And the rates at this hotel are astronomical when compared to its rivals nearby. Try some of Barcelona's fantastic -- and far less expensive -- boutique hotels.",3,2008,07,25
37,Liked to leave the hotel,"When making the reservation I thought it's good to take a hotel directly at the Rampla - but it's not! The Rampla is full of tourists, homeless and by far not clean. So the location of the hotel already has been the first problem. Better to stay at a relaxed and green area of the city and take a taxi down-town if you want to go there.

As a Platinum SPG member at first we got one of the quite small standard but renovated rooms. They try to make it ""design"" but with grey/brown/red they got it quite 80's style... red leather armchair...

After I complained about the room and pointed to my Platinum status they gave us a quite shabby unrenovated suite (also withou any view) on 6th floor. The most amazing point of the room was that there's a window from the hall to the bathrrom where you can directly look to the toilet. Whos idea was that??? Imagine the maid comes in...

Another problem of the hotel is the internet connection. In the room it's € 20,00 plus tax (I really ask myself for what some hotels still charge money for internet access). In the business center it's free - but the computers are often occupied by children. WiFi exists at the lobby and at the business center, that's it - and it costs € 20,00. Thanks a lot!

Another issue is breakfast. While staying at Sheraton (and some Westin) for SPG platinum members breakfast (or lounge access) is included at the ""Le Meridien"" it's not. I really don't understand why SPG can't unify their goodies for all Starwood hotels.

Well, we reduced our stay from 2 nights to 1 night only and were really happy to leave.",2,2008,07,18
37,Construction Noise,Nice hotel and location but was awaken every morning at 6:00 AM by construction renovation next to my suite.  It is a beautiful hotel with all the amenities and unfortunately we picked the wrong time to stay here.  I would stay here again but would make sure beforehand that there is no constuction next to the room.  I didn't ask to be moved as it was an excellent suite and we were all unpacked and settled and had overheard the receptionist tell another guest that the hotel was full.  I don't like to complain and we were only staying for 3 nights.,2,2008,07,18
37,"Excellent hotel, best in town","Excellent 5 star hotel, can't fault it. this is my second stay and I will come back for sure. Great location, nice new rooms, friendly staff!",5,2008,07,16
37,Great Location,"I ended up staying at the Le Meriden because my first choice, a  private resident near the Central Station immediately turned out to be a bad choice: The private residence I had originally booked was smaller than advertised, on the busiest and nosiest street in Barcelona (and lacking the double pane noise proof windows you normally find in Paris) and the internet did not work.
       I packed my bags and left for a more expensive but rewarding hotel stay at Le Meriden. For the average traveler Le Meriden Barcelona is an EXPENSIVE hotel at lowest $350 average per night. But the location is a gem. Close to public transportation (the Catalunya railway and metro stations are but a 100 meters from the hotel) and right at the doorstep of La Rambla, a long series of streets that lead from city central down to the harbor filled with restaurants and shops and entertainment venues. La Rambla is  a wonderful place to people watch as city workers and locals mix with tourists.
      The building itself has the reserved modernist style of its 1950s origins but the interior is composed of that unique Barcelona strain of decoration that includes ultra modern furnishings with Catalan colors and styles with a retro sense of history. 
      My room was large with a wonderful bed and everything was very clean and professionally prepared for my arrival. Internet in the business center and for laptops was free, a great find as most European hotels charge extra for internet access. The staff was friendly and professional. 
	Because of the central location to art museums and tourist attractions, La Rambla, the harbor and subways and buses this is a highly recommended hotel.",5,2008,07,09
37,Loved this hotel,"This is a fine hotel, with a perfect location (on La Rambla).  But what really made this hotel special was how they treated us when we arrived.

Unfortunately, my daughter's pocketbook, including her passport, was stolen on the way to the hotel (the theives in Barcelona are quite clever).  And none of my family speaks any Spanish.  

Upon our arrival, we explained what happened.  The front desk staff, including Marco and a woman whose name I cannot recall. were amazingly helpful.  They placed calls for us to credit card companies, helped us with the police report, and contacted the US Consulate.  Without their amazing help, our vacation might have been ruined.  Instead, we did our best to forget about it, and had a wonderful stay there.",5,2008,06,29
37,Great location but Terrible Service,"My wife and I spent two days in Barcelona at the Le Meridien as part of our Spain Tour.   While the hotel is nicely located right off the Las Ramblas and is well kept, the service at the hotel is terrible.  They lost our passports for a day when the manager locked them in his safe and didn't tell anyone.   We almost missed our flight and had to worry the entire time in Barcelona about them.   The rooms while nicely decorated and accented were disappointing as you could hear the water running through the pipes in the wall and hear your neighbors talking.   The staff really didn't seem to care about anything.   We never even received a greeting from anyone and they just didn't seem to want to help anyone.    As a SPG Gold Member, I was thinking that I would have received better service in this level of a hotel.  Not worth the price.   Look elsewhere if you can.",2,2008,06,25
37,Luxury and location,"If you have the money, this is a great place to stay. I was fortunate enough to be able to use my Starwood points, so I didn't need to count the euros. Service was excellent at check in and departure, and our room was comparable to the Meridien in the US. The hotel has recently been renovated and everything looked new. The beds were comfortable and faced a 50 inch plasma TV on the opposite wall. The bathtub was huge, and had a rubber incline so you could lean back comfortably. And of course, a separate shower. Bath amenities were the same that I used to get at the Meridien in Beverly Hills.
The hotel location was right on the Ramblas, only a block or two from the Plaza de Catalunya. There were cabs galore, and a convenient metro too.
All in all, a great place to have has your home base in a beautiful city.",5,2008,06,17
37,Great Hotel,"After reading the mixed reviews on this site, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was definitely very happy with this choice once I arrived.  The room and bathroom were both very modern with all the best ammenities.  The bed was very comfortable, and I really enjoyed the large flat screen television in the room.  The room also has dimmer lights so that if you get up in the middle of the night, a dim light will go on so that you can see where you're going, but it's not bright enough to wake anyone up.  There is free internet access in the business center which is one of the best features of this hotel since most places in Europe make you pay an arm and a leg to get internet access.  The gym was nice, but didn't really have much if you're looking for weights.  The staff was great and accommodating as well.  The location was also superb.  We walked just about everywhere - or took the metro - the hotel is between two stops.  I'd say Catalunya might be the closer stop though.  (the other one is Liceu)",5,2008,06,06
37,Le Meridien was a disappointment!!!,"After spending two weeks in Spain, my last stay was Barcelona, unfortunally the worst hotel for me.  The others were magnificent.",2,2008,06,02
37,Wonderful Service and Great Location,The location was ideal! and the rooms were very modern and clean. I highly recommend this hip hotel!,5,2008,05,23
37,Fantastic Hotel - great room!,"My Husband surprised me for my Birthday with a trip to Barcelona, staying in Le Meridien on La Rambla. He booked us a mediteranean suite - WOW! The sun terrace was huge and was always always in the sun.....great after a days walking around for a relax on a sun lounger - in private! The room was enormous, the bed as comfortable a any Sheraton group bed. There was a dressing room, with ample hanging space and a large ensuite. It was beautifully kept, was very clean each day. We had room service breakfast every day, which was pricey but well worth it to eat on the terrace in our dressing gowns! My husband used to internet connection for his laptop, which worked well and had a good fast connection. On our first day, we came back to our room to a bucket with a bottle of champange and two champagne glasses - a nice touch. We loved this hotel and would highly recommend it, though take a med suite if you can :o) We thought the hotel was ideally situated to get to all the sights we wanted to see - on foot. It's really very central to all the tourists spots.",5,2008,05,13
37,"Great location, nice hotel but check your bill.","We stayed here in April 08 for seven nights. Arrived in the morning  around 10am and our room was not ready. The agent said that our room had been assigned but the current guests had not checked out yet. It was going to be about 4 hours. We are Starwood gold members and asked if anything else was available, but no luck. When we returned several hours later, we spoke to a different check in rep and she said our original room was still not ready, but when we asked her to check for something else, she came through for us. We ended up on the 4th floor in a newly renovated room that was very  modern with a hugh bathroom to die for. Giant  shower with top and side shower heads. We loved the shower but be prepared for flooding on the floor. Poor design flaw on the lip of the shower door. Put some extra towels on the floor. Even a flat screen TV with remote in the bathroom. There was also a large flat screen TV in the bedroom area.  Very nice. One thing that bothered us a little. For a room that was recently renovated, it had a lot of dirty finger prints on the walls and ceilings. It looked like they were from the workers that were remodeling the rooms. Very sloppy. The breakfast buffet was nice but they need to rotate the selections. We stayed for a week and the food was the same every day. The breakfast was included in our rate. Do not pay for it otherwise. You are better off at a local cafe. There is also a hugh grocery store right next to the hotel. They have wonderful baked bread with meats and cheeses and just about anything else you would need. Get your bottled water there too. The location of this hotel could not be better. You are right off La Rambla and close to the metro. This hotel is very expensive especially when converting US dollars to Euros. While a very nice hotel it is, I think the location and name is what what we are all paying for. We pre paid our stay in full before arrival and upon check out we were charged an extra 30EUR a day for a double room. We already paid for a double room in full. Why were we being charged for it again? We showed the check out agent our receipt showing that we already had paid in full and after he made a copy of it, he quickly removed the charges. Overall, we would stay a the hotel again, mostly for the location. Don't pay for the internet. The hotel has three computers in the business center on the lower level. It is not advertised, but you can use the internet and printers for as long as you like for free, yes, free and it's open 24 hrs.",4,2008,05,10
37,An enjoyable stay,"My husband and I stayed for a romatic weekend at the beginning of April.  

We took the Aerobus from the airport and a short walk from Placa de Catalyna arriving at approx 6PM.  The porters helped us to carry our largish suitcase to reception where check in was quick and professional.

We had booked a renovated Deluxe Room with a Rambla view, but on opening the door we quickly discovered that this is not what we got.

The room was a little tired looking, especially the bathroom, however we believe we had been upgraded to an 8th Floor Suite since we had a lovely large terrace (we would not have had a balcony in our requested room) with excellent views of La Rambla, lots of Barcelona and even a sea view.  We also had a largish sitting area and a good sized desk. This more than made up for the disappointment of not being assigned a refurbished room, and so we did not complain to reception.

We were disappointed with the selection of TV channels available in English, although in fairness we were not often in the room watching TV.

We didn't eat in the restaurant since there was far to much on offer in Barcelona so cannot rate the food, although the restaurant did look very nice.  We had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which was quite stylsih, albeit a little expensive.  On one evening there was a large group in the bar with lots of children and both adults and kids were very loud which spoiled our experience, however generally this was a good place to unwind with a cocktail after a busy day in Barcelona.  Breakfast was purchased from the supermarket next door to the hotel and eaten on our lovely terrace.  We were able to store juices in the minibar and made coffee/tea from the facilities provided in the room.  This made for a stress free start to the day.

We could easily walk to most locations from our hotel and only took one taxi during the whole 4 days.  

A negative point was the expensive internet at a charge of Euros 17.50 a day.

A positive point was the excellent housekeeping.  Our room was kept spotless and we had a daily turn down service, including an additional towel change.  Also, we were never bothered by housekeeping, no matter how late we left the room.

Staff were very friendly and eager to help in a discrete way (not in your face).

Overall we recommend this hotel as an excellent base for a trip to Barcelona.",4,2008,05,08
37,"Great location, comfortable rooms, but more a 4 star","I checked into Le Meridien after being unhappy with the condition of the rooms at the Colon Hotel.  Le Meridien was very comfortable and had the best shower - both a hand held sprayer and a large rain showerhead.  The bed and pillows were comfortable and fluffy and the furnishings were in very good condition.  The location on La Rambla, just a block away from Placa Catalunya, was ideal and it was an easy walk to sightseeing and restaurants.  The door and restaurant staff were pleasant and helpful. The desk staff were ok.  Although it's billed as a 5 star hotel and is very comfortable, by NYC standards, this Le Meridien is only a 4 star hotel. It's also quite expensive.  If price is not an issue, Le Meridien is a comfortable place to stay.",4,2008,05,07
37,Great Hotel in the Centre of the city,"We booked a 2 night stay April 25-27, 2008.

We arrived very late to the hotel.  Our flight was delayed 5 hours from Edinburgh so the car and driver the hotel had arranged for us was not at the airport.(approx 1 am).  

We did contact the hotel via blackberry at the airport prior to our departure about the late flight, however they did not get our message until later.  We called the hotel when we arrived and they told us to take a taxi to the hotel.  When we arrived they paid for the taxi which we thought was a very nice gesture... They did not need to do that.  

Helena at the front desk was very helpful and efficient. She checked us in very quickly.  Our room (Mediterranean Suite 615) was very nice..  Huge terrace with couch, table and chairs and loungers...  The view was fine if you looked out to either side.  There was a bottle of champagne on ice when we arrived as well.

We had two room service breakfast which both were excellent.  Food arrived on time and was just what we asked for and very good quality.  

Daniel the concierge was very helpful as well.  He helped us book dinner at Maria Christina- very good- and they were  great with our 4 year old son.  

The location of the hotel is perfect.  Just off Las Ramblas, you are in the centre of things.  You could walk to all the sights and the harbour.

We had a very good time and have no complaints at all about the Hotel.  You are sure to enjoy your stay if you choose Le Meridien.",4,2008,04,28
37,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed at Le Meridien for a romantic weekend break at the beginning of May.

The location was perfect! Everything was in walking distance so we didn't have to take a cab all weekend. We spent our time wandering through the old town and down to the beach. 

The room was so comfortable and stylish.  We had one with a view over Las Ramblas - we loved watching all the action on the street.  The bathroom was gorgeous too. 

We hated having to leave this place:-)",5,2008,04,24
37,"Excellent location, comfortable rooms","We stayed at the Meridien for a week in March 2008. When we arrived, despite my calling the hotel a few days prior to arrival to review our room requirements (newly renovated suite), the junior suite we given had peeling paint, was dark and had stains on the carpet. We complained and were given a lovely Mediterranean suite. Since we were sharing the room with our daughter, this modern, renovated suite had one and half baths and a separate sitting area with a convertible sofa. It made our stay very comfortable. The suite also had a lovely patio.

Breakfast was very good, but very expensive. We ate breakfast a lovely outdoor cafe behind the Boqueria a couple of blocks away. It was a quarter of the price and just as good.

The location was very good with all sites easily accessible on foot or by subway.",4,2008,04,16
37,Not up to expectations!,"My wife and I stayed here at the end of February.  We picked this hotel firstly as it is a Meridien and secondly due to its location being in the centre of Las Ramblas.  We had been to the Meridien Dubai the previous year and were basing our high expectations on the high standards we incurred while there.  We were very disappointed in the Meridien Barcelona!  It was the staff and location that let it down.  The decor and room were lovely.  It was when we went into the main restaurant that we came across problems.  The food was uneatible, staff unhelpful to the point of rudeness...totally uncceptable.  When a meal is presented with some of the items described on the menu missing then its only natural that you will ask the waiter about this, lets just say I was not happy with the reply I got from him. So much so that I asked to speak to the Restaurant manager about the food and the service, totally unaccepable for this star of hotel.  Needless to say we ate out for the remainder of our stay.

Second point was the location of the hotel on Las Ramblas.  Great if you are a 20 something wanting to be in the middle of all the action...gangs of young men running about made us feel uneasy walking back to the hotel at the end of the night.  If I had to choose a hotel in Barcelona again I would not pick one in this area of town.  We are a couple looking for a romantic break away not to be anxious about stepping out of the hotel at night to go for a walk. But then I suppose it was the centre of the city and these things do happen.  I would probably go back to Barcelona as we did see some lovely historical sights when on the tour hop on hop off bus, but I would probably choose a less busy part of town and a hotel which would live up to its star rating and put their customers first.",1,2008,04,09
37,Great Hotel in the middle of the action,"Booked 5 night stay on hotel website Jr Suite with view of Las Ramblas.  Booked on Hotel website...being a member of Starwood Preferred Guest there is a slight discount but it was expensive 315 Euro a nite  

Room was clean spacious flat screen tv that rotates between sitting area and bed.  High speed internet as well.

We stayed on 9th floor no balcony in the room view of Ramblas required a little bit of a lean but the view of the city was pretty cool.

I booked this hotel after I found out that the Cathedral across from the Hotel Colon was under construction and paying for a suite at Hotel Colon with a view of the Cathedral would have been a huge waste.

Check in was very quick no issues everyone spoke great English so no worries.  We used the concierge extensively to book restaurants they always gave good recommendations.  

We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did have a drink there, nice decor good service.  They also have a small bar and sitting area in the lobby.

The hotel is in the middle of a lot you walk right out onto Las Ramblas, are a few blocks from the big market La Boqueria, very close to Plaza Cataluna where you can get tourist bus,  very close to subway stations which are very easy to use and a great way to get around the city.  It is right across street from Hotel 1898, there is a Starbucks a block away.

There is still some work going on around the hotel it did not interfere with our visit, also no gym or pool though they can give you a pass to a large health club about 1/2 mile away that does have pool and all the equipment you would ever want.

Room had minibar which was expensive, water 3.90 Euro there is a grocery store a block away where water is .50 Euro and wine  and I believe beer was available all at fractions of minibar prices.

One odd issue is that they do not guarantee nonsmoking suites, the one we had smelled fine, no residual odor but something to ask about if that is a concern.

All in all a great hotel clean, professional good service and great location.  Would stay again and recommend to others.",4,2008,04,02
37,"Design a little ""off""","We just returned from a 4 day stay at the Meridien.  Overall, the experience was good, but I have to say that the room design just did not ""work"" for us.  We had one of the recently renovated rooms on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor.  First of all, there is no privacy between the bathroom and the main sleeping area. They are seperated by a frosted glass door that did not close properly and was open at the top.  My husband and I were staying with our six year old son so we had very little privacy for showering.  The sink drained very poorly and the makeup mirror just hung from the wall sadly- as if the weight of the mirror was too much for the extending arm.  There is a wonderful rainhead in the shower, but no means to prevent the water from spraying all over the bathroom floor.  The lovely plasma TV was not working properly so we were unable to get movie or internet access. The staff offered to move us, but we felt it would have been too difficult at that point.  You pay through the nose for computer internet access and a children's bed (50 Euro per night for the latter).
It felt like the designers had some wonderful ideas that just were not practical.  The wood floors that line the hallway are already showing extreme wear and tear.    Lastly, there is a concierge desk in the foyer, but it is rarely manned which is odd for a hotel of this caliber. .   Food prices are quite high and breakfast was not included in the room price.
On the plus side, the blackout curtains provided great for great ""sleep ins"" and the housekeeping staff was top notch.
The location is very good",4,2008,04,02
37,wow,"Beds are fantastic.

The rainfall showers superb after staying in  another supposed 5 star hotel in Barcelona.

Quality off the food in restaurant of very high standard.

Hotel has recently undergone renovations. This hotel is actually 5 stars unlike others in barcelona who claim to be.",5,2008,03,29
37,What a Great Hotel,"We had a great stay at this hotel.  It is in a wonderful location, right on La Rambla, but that also made it noisy and our first room was right on the street.  So, after the first night, we asked for and got a very quiet room at the back.

The decor and amenities were very, very nice, including robe and slippers.  Beautiful bathrooms, too.

We love our internet and the business center was open 24/7 with free high speed internet.

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2008,03,29
37,Great rooms,"If you want to stay on La Rambla, this is an excellent hotel choice. My room was on the small size, but not tiny as some European rooms can be. The decor was very hip and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was great with an amazing deep tub and rain-style shower - plus a TV in the bathroom so you could watch as you soak (though the only English channels are news and sports).

The construction was still happening while I was there, but it didn't affect my stay at all - just meant that the lobby wasn't superb. The room service and minibar prices were too high for me. My room was on a side street, not directly on La Rambla, and it was still quite loud, though fine with earplugs. That is probably unavoidable and the price one pays for staying on La Rambla.",4,2008,03,08
37,hip hotel on ramblas,"This hotel exceeded our expectations as far as decor.  I expected it to be old fashioned or traditional decor and was greatly impressed to find flat screen TVs, great shower/tub with very modern decor and every amenity.  The bed was super comfortable and down comforter and pillows were a treat.

The staff spoke English and was very helpful overall.  We were concerned that it would be loud since we were on second floor close to Rambla but the windows kept all of the noise out.  So we had convenient location without inconvenient noise.  

Great hotel experience overall!",5,2008,02,25
37,"Great Rooms, Great Service, Convenient Location","This hotel exceeded our expectations in terms of comfort, service, decor, amenities and location.

Comfort: The goose down bed and luxury bedsheets definitely gave us many nights of great sleep.  

Service: All the staffs at the hotel are courteous, every single one we encountered greeted us with a  friendly tone.

Amenities: Our rooms were furnished with flat screen tv, robes, slippers, comb, shaver & creme, cotton pads, cotton swabs, tooth brush & paste, sewing kit, bath beads/salt/pedals, and of course, the usual: shampoo, soap, conditioner, lotion. We were pleased with that.

Decor: If you like modern decor, ask for a ""renovated"" room upon check in. If you like ""traditional"" decor, if it's still available, ask for a ""non-renovated"" room. I have pictures for both.

Location: This is on ""La Rambla."" I find walking on La Rambla the first day to be exciting, but it became annoying after a few days to deal with a big crowd full of mindless tourists. The hotel is steps away from museums, Gothic Quarters and the famous Boqueria Market.  It's also right on the L3 subway line, close to exit: Liceu and Catalunya.  

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Whoever said that ""hotels"" doesn't not matter, or that they just ""need a place to sleep"" really have not experienced any ""luxury hotels.""  

Check out my photos too.",5,2008,02,25
37,"Very nice, Great Location","Traveling with a group and they picked this hotel.  The hotel is clean, well run and convienient location (on Las Ramblas).  I would not rate this a 4 star hotel because of amenities but it was very comfortable.  At the time it was undergoing renovations but it did not interfere with our stay.",4,2008,02,10
37,Winner in Barcelona,"There were many options for the return trip to Barcelona - but the budget didn't accommodate a return to the Hotel Arts (too bad fur us) but fortune smiled on this trip and we spent three nights at the Le Meridien Hotel, smack dab in the middle of why folks go to Barcelona in the first place - the street scene and energy of La Rambla.  Located towards the top end of famous pedestrian boulevard and a two minute walk to Plaza Catalunya - the vortex of all transportation options - and facing a side street a block from the famous Boqueria Market - the Meridien turned a great stay in the city into an outstanding memory.  Rafael at the front desk, backed up by Brendan and our pal Rauol at he bar  - the staff could not have been nicer - first name basis nice.

Our room at $245 euros per was on the fourth floor in the rear away from the potential street noise of late night Barcelona.  A Starbucks in the builidng next store helped immensely as there is not anything open when your starting an ""early morning"" walk on American time .

Hip decor, clean lines, flat panel electronics, quality bed linens and the most magical shower head I have ever experienced characterized the hotel.  I never believed all the hype about ""sunflower shower heads"" but the Meridien had one in our bathroom and it was indeed magical in its power to reinvigorate the most jet lagged tourist.   Our room had an ante-room outside the bedroom, a likely left over space from a renovation one year ago.  The added square footage made for a splendid feel to the room.

For us the location, amenities, compactness of the facility and a staff that performs at the level you expect  - and beyond - the Meridien was a true winner for us in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter area.",5,2008,02,03
37,Not a 5 Star,"Just returned from 4 nights in Barcelona, 3 spent at Le Meridien.  

PROS:  well-situated near Plaza Catalunya and Metro stop; clean; great shower; good mattresses

CON:  over-priced; not 5 star quality; very small rooms; 17.50 Euros for Intenret connection; snobby personnel; noisy environment outside; during our stay it was quite warm, but they had AC turned off, so option was to open window which proved extremely noisy.

Airline personnel say they stay at Fira Plaza near Plaza Espanya.....might try that next time.",3,2008,01,19
37,The Center of it all in Barcelona!,"My husband and I visted Barcelona this past Spring and had a wonderful stay at Le Meridien in Barcelona.  This hotel is beautifully located right on LAS RAMBLAS and is steps away from all the sites:  Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotica (my personal favorite!), many museums, the beautiful parks and myriad fantastic restaurants.  Our rooms was lovely, with a HUGE balcony overlooking LAS RAMBLAS, the majestic Banco de Espana, with it's Empire Facade and in the distance, the Mediterranean Sea.  We dined several times on this romantic balcony as the revelers milled below us along LAS RAMBLAS. The staff was accommodating and made good recommendations for restaurants.  I think our favorites were Ceverceria Barcelone (great tapas!) and the world-famous Paella place down by the waterfront.  YUM!  My husband was ill and so he spent a lot of time in the very comfortable bed, and I was thrilled with the restaurant (called 111, and really excellent!) and the room service was also super.  We ate at the restaurant alot because my husband was not feeling well, so we didn't want to go too far afield and Ricardo our waiter was the best!  the bar is gorgeous in sexy red decor and they have jazz there ont he weekends, which is fun, but we did not stay long as my husband needed to head back to bed - TOO BAD!  When we return to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2008,01,05
37,Good Experience,"Just returned from a 4-night stay at the Le Meridan in BCN. The location (as others have attested to) is very convenient and quiet, despite being on Las Ramblas. I didn't seek advice from the Concierge b/c there was always a line formed around that desk, but did utilize the security guard that was near the front door each morning... he was
a very knowledgeable & pleasant gentleman so I suggest if you're in a time crunch... seek his advice on good spots for breakfast, etc.  

I did not experience all of the shower issues some others had... our room was newly renovated and had 2 rooms - a large area in the front (dressing area) and then the bedroom. I didn't find the room to be small at all - with the luggage stored in the front room that freed up some space in the bedroom area.

Overall a good stay - used starwood points so if I had to pay upwards of USD$500 I may not have been quite as happy. Also - if you're looking for a more pleasant/quiet lounge/bar area - Hotel 1898 has a beautiful bar/lobby area you can poach while the Le Meridian is going through their renovations. It is next door to the hotel.",4,2008,01,04
37,Great Location,"Wonderful location, hotel presently under renovation of lobby  so guests must use the bar area as the lobby to check in and during stay which is inconvenient and not a pleasant experience.  Used our Starwood points and was upgraded to a  suite after many requests and being  rudely lectured to by an arrogant  hotel staff member upon check in that the hotel was making an exception to Starwood's normal policy of not upgrading gold members to suites.  On the basis of our prior travel to many other Starwood hotels this is not true. We were made to wait in the make shift lobby for 2 hours supposedly while our suite was prepared. However, upon entering our suite it was apparent that it had not been stayed in for some time.  TV wasn't connected, shower  was inoperable, no toiletries in bath etc.    Concierge staff pleasant but not that knowledgeable about restaurants,  events, taxi fares etc so do not rely upon their advice alone.  Overall a pleasant but not luxurious experience.",4,2007,12,31
37,Nice Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel while on vacation.  My room had been upgraded to a room right on Las Ramblas.  Considering how many people were walking in front of my room, my room was quiet.  The room is indeed very small as others have noted, but I have stayed in smaller rooms in NYC.  The room was dark, but thats not a problem for me.  If I had to put makeup on everyday I could see that being a problem.  The shower had drainage problems.  Despite the fact that I speak Spanish and explained the problem to the staff twice, nothing was done to resolve the problem.  I had to shower in a pool of water at my feet every night... and once I had been in the shower for more than five minutes... the water would flow into the main bathroom... not pretty.  The workout facility was under construction while I was there, but passes were given out to a local gym.  The local gym is very nice but was a nice ten to fifteen minute walk away from the hotel.  I love my starwood points so I might consider staying here again, but otherwise, its just a nice hotel with a great location.  Nothing really special about the hotel or the staff.  However, the location can not be beat... its perfect for someone who wants to see Barcelona.",4,2007,12,21
37,Wonderful hotel in Barcelona,"A wonderful business hotel with friendly staff and a great location. My hotel room was one of the best I have ever had, complete with large balcony. I enjoyed my stay and can recommend this hotel. Construction work for a new lobby was well managed. Mark, Switzerland",5,2007,12,17
37,"Excellent, considering the circumstances","The location is just perfect, on the Ramblas next to the Barrio Gotico and with a street buzzing with people and shops.  We had been advised that the lobby was under renovation prior to our arrival.  I must say however, it was very discreet and we never saw any workmen around, it was clean and not noisy at all. The reception has been discretly placed in the bar provisionally, so you can have a drink while you check-in/out.  Had a wonderful ""Mediterranean"" suite with the most amazing bathroom and jacuzzi!   The variety at the buffet breakfast is very good. We liked the touch of a teddy bear with a small card saying ""Please bear with us during the renovation"".  Highly recommended!",5,2007,12,14
37,"Great location, nice hotel","This is a nice hotel, in a great location.  They are doing construction, but that really wasn’t an issue as we were typically out and about while the noisy stuff was going on.  I was told it would be completed by the first of December, but trust me, they weren’t close when we stayed there.  Some guests were demanding they be moved to another hotel.  Overall for the price and rating, the property should be better.  The personnel were, uh, okay.  Mostly good.  But, they should have been great.  They suffer from that ugly syndrome many properties suffer from.  They mistakenly think their discussions with fellow employees and following procedures trump the needs of their guests.  The room was cool, but tiny.  It had weird motion lights.  Great when they worked properly, annoying when they didn’t.

This hotel is right on La Ramblas, so the location is perfect if you are new to Barcelona.  If you aren’t a quieter option over in the Gothic area might be preferable.  If you do spend time walking down La Ramblas, enjoy the spectacle, but keep your wallet safe.  Don’t give money to anyone for anything (okay, maybe a mime or two).  Most locals are trying to scam you.  We watched tourist after tourist get taken by the shell game…gees, the oldest scam in the book.

In summary, this property is leaning on its namesake.  Hopefully once the construction is completed, they will also take a look at their guest experience.",3,2007,12,14
37,Very disappointing - do not recommend to anyone,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for the weekend in early Nov. Overall, the hotel was very disappointing, certain aspects - ridiculous. A few incidents -

- After taking a shower, half of the bathroom was flooded & water even went into the room. Was told that there was a problem with the sink.

- Not feeling well on our first day there, so I was sleeping in the room in the afternoon to get some rest. But to be able to sleep was impossible as the hotel seemed to be undergoing some renovation and the noise was there. And just when I was about to drift into sleep, at about 4pm in the afternoon, someone from the hotel CAME INTO the room without either pressing the bell or knocking the door. It was really unacceptable. Door bells are there for a reason, please.

My general impression was that people in the hotels were not friendly/helpful. 

I understand that different people might have different experience staying here, and I do not want to make any sweeping generalisation. But for my stay, it was very very disappointing. I would not recommend anyone to stay here.",1,2007,12,04
37,How to ruin your trip,"If you want to ruin your trip to Barcelona, stay here. 

It is highly overpriced, rooms are small and dark,services are inferior, and the staff is rude and unhelpful. It starts at the curb, where you can struggle to get your luggage out of a taxi on the cramped side street, as the doorman stands still and watches you.  (And then expects a gratuity)   I had reason to approach the front desk 3 times during my stay.  Each time I had to wait behind other couples who were filing complaints or trying to check out early and go somewhere else.  The web information is highly misleading and misrepresents the ranking of this hotel.   Staying here makes you feel ripped off, and casts a palor over what ought to be a great stay in a fabulous city.

I'd rather sleep in the park.",1,2007,11,30
37,Great location.   Disappointing hotel,"This hotel is in a great location right on La Rambla.   The hotel itself was disappointing.   The lobby still isn't finished.   The desk staff was totally unhelpful when we asked questions about directions or sights.   The rooms were very small, but they were modern and clean.   Luckily we were using Starwood points.  Otherwise this hotel was not worth the rates it charged.",2,2007,11,28
37,Excellent!,"Amazing location - right on La Rambala.
Excellent service - reception and concierge were very helpful and friendly, made great recos for restaurants and got us reservations.
Beautiful room - I guess they've just been renovated so the room was definitely 5-star worthy! Very modern look, comfy bed.

The lobby renovations were still not yet complete when we visited but that really didn't bother us at all - the side entrance was small but just fine and not at all an inconvenience.

We didn't eat at the restaurant or order room service so i can't speak to the food... tho the prices did look high.",5,2007,11,28
37,Excellent Barcelona Hotel,Awesome location... make sure to ask for a newer renovated room. The amenities are awesome and the location is even better. Very particular frequent traveler would recommend this hotel to anyone on vacation or in town for business.,5,2007,11,18
37,Wait until the construction has finished - 3 star,"We stayed here for two nights at the start of November. This is not a five star hotel in its current state. The location is great, the staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms are very nice but the noise from the construction above our room 316 was a nightmare. Drilling, hammering, sawing, cutting you name it started at 9am and I don't know what time it ended at because we just had to leave the room. We had planned to stay in this hotel for two more nights but we moved to a great 4 star hotel called Hotel Jazz on Pelai at 170 euro a night versus 225 at Le Meridien. If its value for money and five stars your looking for do not stay at Le Meridien during construction.",3,2007,11,16
37,well located and very comfortable,"My wife and I booked a 3 night stay at le meridien barcelona and do highly recommend the hotel for its location, room comfort and friendly staff.",4,2007,10,30
37,"Nice hotel, very relaxing and good food!","We stayed at Le Meridien Barca at the start of June.  The staff were very helpful on our arrival and the concierge accompanied my partner to park the car which was a nice touch.

Our room wasn't ready on arrival, so we went along to the restaurant for something to eat (reception staff did give us drinks vouchers).  The food from the snack menu was great.

Our room was quiet and relatively spacious for a city centre hotel.  Bathroom was a real treat and the bed as always was very comfortable.

We have stayed at Le Meridien hotels on a number of occassions and although it was very good, it didn't quite match Vienna on service.

I would return here as the location is great and I'm sure after the hotel is refreshed it will be even better.",4,2007,10,23
37,Great rooms!!!!!!!!,"The hotel location is great, right on the Rambla (too many people!!!) and you can take the bus from the airport to Plaza Catalunya and then walk afew blocks.

They are going under major construction, I think the lobby is the last part and will be ready soon.

That was the thing I didnt like, you take a small door and then go to front desk (very small) next to the bar, next to the restaurant.

The elevators are small, I think because the construction, we had a room in the fourth floor, the halls are wide and totally new, then you open the door of your room and is small, BUT so nice, modern, GREAT BEADS, fantastic linens, towels, bathrobes, the pillows are very good, the shower is sooo good, like a spa.

I can´t say enough about how much we liked the room, we relaxed and had a great time because we were there during the weekend so we had no noise, only a little on friday afternoon and monday morning,  I´m sure during the week is awful.

The staff is very nice, very friendly, probably not very proactive in terms of understanting the guests´ needs, I would say the service is not five stars.",5,2007,10,17
37,Fantastic.!!! Don't let the construction bother you,"Fantastic hotel in the middle of the Ramblas. Ultra Modern room, best bed and linens ever, a shower that you will not want to leave, and the thickets softest towels I have ever experienced. Big LCD hanging from the wall, and TV in the bathroom.
Ask the person who helps you with your luggage to show you how the lighting of the room works because it is a little tricky. A soft blue light on the floor will always turn on in the middle of the night even with the slightest move and believe me, it is hard to manage the lighting. Ask for an upper floor room, because the construction on the lobby starts at 9:00 am and you will not only hear it but feel it if you stay in the first floor.  So, don't let the lack of a real lobby and the construction bother you and experience a fantastic room in Barcelona.

Pd; free internet in the business center...and free coffee, chocolate croisants and fruits if you wake up early.",5,2007,10,14
37,Best Location in Barcelona & Best Bed!,"We spent 1 night in the Le Meridien Barcelona after a cruise.  The location in the middle of La Rambla could not have been better as you can walk to all the good areas from this location.  I asked for an interior room to be more quiet and it was very quiet.  The room was large, comfortable and ultra-modern decor.  The beds are huge by European standards and heavenly to sleep on.  The only draw back was the lighting that seemed  complicated  and hard to figure out.  The airconditioner was making noise at night so I had to turn it off so I could get some sleep.  My advice is to always bring earplugs when you travel.  Great shower and even has a TV in the bathroom.  We used points to stay in this hotel for free but other than that is is probably around $500 a night.  A real treat for us and a great way to enjoy our last day in Barcelona before returning home.  The airport is only a 20 minute taxi ride away....I would highly recommend staying in this hotel.",5,2007,10,03

The bar to the right as you leave the lobby was very local, friendly and good late-night food or early morning as it may be.
No concierge, or, if there was they were never around, but the staff speaks English pretty well and has maps.
Don't get me wrong, nice and reputable hotel brand, but I would rather have stayed at the hotel across the street Hotel 1898.  Much more character, rooftop pool and lounging area, beautiful rooms.",4,2007,09,29
37,Wait till Constructions Finished!,"Half the hotel was being renovated and the entire lobby was not accessible.  The staff was very helpful finding us an acceptable room but at these prices, considering the difficult circumstances, breakfast or a discount or something should have been offered to compensate for noise and mess! Hotels undergoing such a major overhaul should clearly inform customers or close altogether. Older travelers should beware Meridien's ""new look.""  Getting into and out of the shower requires a huge step over a higher than normal ledge which, when wet, is also slippery.  The bathroom is supposed to be chic, if small.  I found it poorly laid out with mirrors too high to see and only half a tub enclosure to keep shower water from dousing the floor.  Lighting turns on and off automatically, thus waking your companion if you get out of bed during the night.  This hotel will probably be very cool when finished but I could not recommend it even though we found the staff very kind under the circumstances. Unless you're under 25 and plan to party all night, there really is no reason to stay on Las Ramblas anyway.  Good news is, new windows keep street noise down and we enjoyed the restaurant very much.

37,The best i've found in Barcelona,"Stayed three nights in August, booking through SPG.COM.

Upgraded to very nice suite as part of platinum spg recogntion program, and very impressed with room. Quiet, spacious with comfortable living area and well thought out bathrom with great selection of toiletries. A nice touch was the comp. botle of Hermes eau de toilette.

Had room service breakfast each morning from a la carte menu. fresh squeezed juice, superb selection of prepared fruits, good pastries etc. About the best continental i've come across in Europe, on par with Berkeley Hotel, London, but at 30 euros rather cheaper.

Wake up calls all on time.

Room service dinner was also good, with professional, polite staff who were happy to listen to specific requests for slightly off menu choices.

All the staff I came across were generally helpful, especially considering the general lack of a can do service culture in Spain, and BCN in particular.

There's a small biz centre on LG floor, which was useful as I'd dropped my laptop en route and needed to remain in touch with office.

I've previously stayed in both suites and apartments at Arts, and must say this beats the Arts in many respects, not least of all in terms of service and value for money.

37,"Great location, ultra-modern room","We spent 2 nights in the Le Meridien Barcelona before boarding a cruise. The remodeling of the hotel is done except for the lobby. They're using a place in the bar for the temporary reception which made it very crowded on check-out and difficult to find on check-in. Our room was very nice, ultra-modern decor and lighting that seemed almost too complicated for it's own good but it worked out. Very nice bathroom and large room by European standards. The hotel restaurant was always buffet-style and the food was good quality for buffet style but very pricey. The staff was friendly and available and the room and common areas were always clean and well maintained. The location right of Las Rambalas was ideal and it was easy to find.
",4,2007,09,12
37,Worst Service,"Well the hotel was modern and new but the service was terrible. I checked in to be given a smoking room wrong standard I complained and asked for correct room and the manager told me if I did not like it to leave. I eventually got what I asked for the next morning. Moved rooms and when I arrived back after a day sight seeing and the sheets had not been changed and the room had not be cleaned properly. Day 3 came back and 3/4 a bottle of Moet had been dumped by the maid without my permission. When I complained and asked for the champagne to be replaced they did not want to do it. 
To be honest if I had a problem instead of being accomodating the staff wanted to have the last word not find me a solution. Dont forget this is meant to be a 5* hotel!!
Would not recommend staying here as i left not relaxed and really p****d of. Would not receommend at all.
",1,2007,08,28
37,Great Location,"This was my first time in Barcelona.  Only stayed at the Le Meridien one night.    The reception area was still in the temporary location next to the lobby lounge.    It was very hectic, but other than, really enjoyed this hotel.

It is  located right on the Las Ramblas, which is a wide promenade that stretches maybe 20 blocks from near the seaport to the middle of the city.    There are street performers, sidewalk cafes, restaurants and shopping along the Las Ramblas, and you will be drawn out of the hotel to experience this slice of Spanish life.

The hotel was in good condition.  Our room was not particularly large, but very functional with a modern decor.    The bathroom was very nice with a rain shower and deep tub combination.   Very contemporary styling with frosted glass walls into the hallway and entry foyer from the bath.   

The lobby lounge is a great place to have a drink and watch the world walk by on the Las Ramblas.    The service is very good in the lounge.    Ate at the restaurant and found it be adequate, but really prefer to explore other dining options outside of the hotel.

If returning, I would definately stay here again.    It's not a 5 star property in US terms, but offers an nice 4 star upscale, very convenient and comfortable place to stay in Barcelona.",4,2007,08,25
37,Currently not a 5 star,"We decided to have a few days in Barcelona with friends, and got a good deal at Le Meridien, attracted by its location on Las Ramblas and the official 5 star rating. I was wary about the previous reports on refurbishment, but it sounded substantially complete. On arrival, we found that the main reception and lounge area was being re-developed, and so had to use a temporary reception. This gave a poor impression of the hotel overall. The temporary reception was very busy and crowded with  suitcases etc of those checking out, or waiting for transport. Our room was initially not ready, but after a walk around the area, we were allocated our room. This had been fully refurbished in a modern, minimalist style, and the bathroom, although very smart, had a large shower area but no bathtub. The view from the room was of the back of some appartments and offices opposite. We did not have dinner in the hotel, but had a couple of drinks in the lounge, which offered good service, but high prices. 
Breakfast was included in our package, and was very varied and tasty, with some egg dishes cooked to order. Unfortunately on the last morning, the overnight thunderstorm had caused the flat roof above the breakfast buffet to leak, resulting in water dripping through the still live light fittings - not a very safe situation!
Overall the hotel was disappointing, and it was difficult to see how the 5 star rating was justified, even if the refurbishment was disregarded, and if staying in Barcelona again we would certainly look at other options.
",3,2007,08,20
37,Great hotel in perfect location,"My wife and I spent the end of our honeymoon at the Le Meridien in Barcelona.  The downside of our trip - the hotel's main lobby was under construction.  That was the ONLY downside.  The room we got was excellent - it was not huge, but clearly recently remodeled with a very modern bathroom and a great bed.  VERY comfortable room. The hotel location is ideal for a short trip - very near the Gothic quarter for exploring. On the Ramblas. The concierge booked us into an incredible restaurant (La Dama) for dinner - superb experience. Highly recommended.
",5,2007,08,17
37,Highly recommend Le Meridien Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed at the Meridien for one night prior to going on a cruise out of Barcelona

We arrived at 9am...our hotel room was available and we were very pleasantly surprises to find a nice sized room, very modern , clean. and beautiful bathroom with great amenities.

We left the next day, boarded the ship, and then I realized that I had left a blazer behind in the room.

Two weeks later, upon my return home, I called the hotel, reported the blazer left in the room, and was told that it was found and woud be sent to me immediately.

One week later, I received the jacket, along with a book I had also left in the room.

The efficiency, honesty, and all around pleasant experience will certainly bring us back again, and we surely recommend the hotel for all of the above along with the wonderful location, right on the Ramblas.
",4,2007,08,10
37,What a disappointment!,"We were 11 in our family, stayed  July 21, 2007, for 2 nights,
we had 1 twin and 3 triples (1 adult and 2 children in each
room).
The only thing going for this hotel is the location.
Rooms are very, very small, not very functional.
The distances between elevators and rooms is
awful (my brother has only one leg). The staff was
rude and disinterested. Definitely not a 4 or 5 star
hotel. Should have listed to my travel agent about
staying across the street at the reliable Hotel Colon.
",1,2007,08,08
37,Great Experience at Le Meridien Barcelona,"My girlfriend and i spent three days in Barcelona and had a great stay at Le Meridien.  The concierage and front desk staff were tremendous.  In particular, Anthony, the concierage, was a great help.  He was outstanding maping out all the must see spots and things to avoid.  Anthony also did a great recommending local restaurants and tapas bars.  He really helped make it a great trip instead of just a good trip for my now fiance and me.

The hotel was finishing up a renovation of the lobby.  The rooms, however, were complete by the time of our stay.  Rooms were great, with plenty of space.  We really enjoyed the style of the hotel - modern, but not too crazy like some W hotels.  This hotel is a no brainer - you are right in the middle of everything on La Rambla.
",5,2007,08,06
37,Overall Very Good,"My wife and I stayed at the Le Meridien for seven days in July.  We arrived early on Sunday morning from New York and our room wasn't ready.  Not a big deal as we were there so early that we didn't expect it.  I'm an SPG Gold Member and they told us that they would put the room cleaning on a priority list and that the room would be ready in about 1.5 hours.  We went for a walk on Las Ramblas, had a cup of coffe and returned to the hotel about 1.5 hours later.  The temporary lobby in the bar/restaurant area (renovations in the actual lobby) was absolutely packed with new arrivals waiting for their rooms.  To make a long story short, we waited 4 hours to get a room and didn't get that one unitl I spoke to a Manager about the situation.

Luckily, that was the only negative we experienced.  There were room and lobby renovations going on, but there was no noise to speak of and the work did not affect our stay.  The room was a renovated one on the 8th floor with a patio and facing Las Ramblas.  It was good size for Europe, modern/clean and verything worked fine.  The location of the hotel was perfect for sight seeing and the staff was very helpful.  They really don't have a concierge as such but use the front desk people in that capacity.  They were helpful and very friendly.  The buffet breakfast was teriffic (well stocked at all times) and the breakfast help were responsive and friendly.  We ate two meals in their restaurant and it was o.k., but not great. 

We wound up having a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.
",4,2007,08,02
37,Good choice for central Barcelona,"Had 4 nights here recently. Excellent location right on the Ramblas but rooms well soundproofed so noise not an issue. Refurbishments still ongoing (late?) but not intrusive. Room a bit narrow and lighting poor for (e.g.) reading in bed. Our refurbished room obviously had water coming into it from the bathroom as skirting board and paint coming off the wall. As no damp smell didn't bother askng for new room. Bed and other facilities in room otherwise fine. Staff v friendly especially at breakfast. Downside is lack of outside space e.g.  roof terrace/courtyard - wish we had had a rooftop pool as some other hotels have in Barcelona. Recommended otherwise.
",4,2007,07,30
37,I loved this hotel,"I absolutely loved this hotel and Barcelona.  It is located right on Las Ramblas which is a great street with plenty to see and do.  There are restaurants and little shops all around the hotel within walking distance.

The room itself was a decent size for Europe.  It is very modern looking and I liked the huge flat screen TVs.  The bed and sheets were very comfortable.  The bathroom was large and clean.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

Although you had to pay for internet in the room, there a couple computers down near the lobby where you could use the internet for free.

Overall great hotel and I look forward to going back to Barcelona and staying at this hotel.

37,ramble on the ramblas,"The hotel was excellent. Travelled on sleazyJet £35 each way as a last minute present for my much better half and spent quite a lot for 1 night at a hotel. Booked a cheaper one with ramblashotels.com but upgraded with them to Le Meridien after reading a couple of tripadvisor reviews of hotel rooms broken into, grief, tears and sorrow. The hotel was great, sort of at the bottom of the Ramblas, right by the market. Older hotel, very polite staff, nice big clean, quiet room and no hassle. Slept for the best part of 12 hours. Certainly no complaints from us. The hotel had also left a courtesy note saying our room had yet to be upgraded but we were happy with what we had. Loads of complementary toiletries and as we had taken one change of clothes (my significant other half had 1 hours notice of the trip) we used them. The Ramblas is a bit overpowering at night, loads of Brits and Germans looking for the Irish bars (who were the only ones to have security on) but probably no different than any other city at night. By day, visit the market for Tapas. Amazing stalls, cheap food, friendly staff. Visit the marina, beach and cathedral, stay away from tour buses - walk, you will see so much more. We landed 9pm and flew back 7pm following evening. Mad 22 hours, lots of fun - far better than Madrid which we visited in October 06. Hotel and Barcelona both recommended by us.
",5,2007,07,12
37,What a great hotel!,"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Le Meridien.  It is half a block off of Las Ramblas- you could not ask for a better location!  Our room faced the side street (not Las Ramblas), so noise was not an issue for us at all.  Very nice, modern, and clean room- large by European standards.  Cannot speak to the food, as we did not have one meal at the hotel.  But the location is convenient to the sights, the metro, and everything for someone wanting to see and learn about Barcelona.  Could not be happier about our choice in hotel and would highly recommend it.
",5,2007,07,11
37,Great Hotel & Location,"We stayed at the hotel July 7-8, 2007 and found it to be a great property.  I booked a standard room with Starwood points.  It wasn't ready by the time they promised so they gave us a much larger room with a huge balcony overlooking las Ramblas.  It wasn't a remodeled room, but still very nice and spacious by European standards.   The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations.  It's in a great area right on las Ramblas, but beware it is very crowded with tourists in July.  Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.
",4,2007,07,11
37,maybe my individual tale of woes?,"I stayed there in April on points and am a platinum starwood member.  All the reviews have been so great but I do want to tell my tale of woe as a word of caution.  I felt very sorry for the staff as they dealt with one disaster after another and seemed quite embarrased..
1) Disaster 1:   The first room was a suite and when we arrived there was a problem with the electronic lock-- no key but the hotel master key could open it.  It was supposed to be fixed the following day but was not. I finally had to really push to get a hotel manager to see the lock who then apologized and quickly moved me to nice room with a balcony view
2) Disaster 2:  It started raining and water started pouring out of the ceiling  light fixtures onto the flat panel tv. in room number 2. We grabbed the TV so it was not damaged and went down to the front desk...who by now were flabbergasted..
3) Disaster 3:  We went to dinner at the hotel and the service was so bad they comped the meal.. we gave the price of the meal to the waiter since he and the staff were so embarrased at the hotel
4) Disaster 4:  Not really a disaster, but by now we had been upgraded to our third room which had a massive jacuzzi and two bathrooms.  After all this  I decided to take a jacuzzi to relax--which I never do-- and you guessed it, the switch didn't work and in fact came out of the socket in the tub.
The renovation of the hotel has taken far longer than expected and I hope by now all this has been fixed.  I really liked the folks working there and hope that under Westin management all the issues have been fixed.
",2,2007,06,15
37,Great style & location,"We stayed at Le Meridien for 4 nights, May 2-6, 2007.  It was actually a second choice, we had planned for the Hotel Arts but a rainy forecast convinced us to switch to this in-town (right off Las Ramblas, near Placa Catalunya) hotel rather than further away on the beach.  The forecast turned out to be wrong, but the switch proved to be a good one.  The hotel was spotless, the staff excellent, and if you want to be in city centre Barcelona you can't be in a better spot.  The Cent Onze lounge was attractive, and the hotel treats you to a complimentary Cava on check in.  We were given good tips on restaurants off the property, with no attempt to steer us to Cent Onze (where jazz is played each night.)
Overall, highly recommended as part of the Starwood family. Very good value for the money in our opinion.
",5,2007,06,12
37,Great hotel with great value!!,"This hotel is in a perfect location on La Rambla!! In addition to that the service was excellent and everyone spoke perfect english.  The rooms have just been upgraded and offer very comfortable beds and
big screen plasma tv's in each room. The bathrooms were also very nice, ceiling shower was very relaxing the bathroom was very spacious
unlike most european hotels.  

I was traveling with a 2 year old and a 7 months old, which led them to offer me a suite for lower than the standard rate so we can all fit more comfortably. I had to pay for upgrade but it was a great rate and it was well received.

There is a park around the corner if your traveling with kids and they offer free internet service in the lobby to check email and browse the web. I don't know if its every hotel in spain which the staff is so nice, but this over achieved my expectations.",4,2007,06,11
37,Great location,"We were in Barcelona for two nights before leaving on a cruise.  We chose Le Meridien because of it's location, close to the pier and right on LaRambla.  We like to run in the mornings and we thought LaRambla would give us a place to start and then go down to and along the water.  We were not disappointed, we were actually thrilled.  The room was comfortable, the staff was very friendly.  The internet access was convenient and easy to use.  We loved walking La Rambla and sitting there in the morning and afternoon with an espresso and watching the people.  A short walk to Placa De Cataluna and you can easily get anywhere you may want to go.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good hotel and one that  puts them in the middle of the real flavor of Barcelona.
",4,2007,06,01
37,"Good Hotel, Great Location","We had a great stay for 4 nights at the Le Meridien.  Staff was incredibly courteous and we loved the location and the overall feel of the hotel.  As a SPG plat member, ended up on a high floor - but with an unrenovated room.  Room was a little worn, but with a nice sitting area and bath and nice view.  A friend was on lower floor but had a very sleek, boutique hotel like room with flat panel TV.  

Big selling point here is the trusted name and the wonderful location right off las Ramblas.  Perfect place to stay and see the sights.  Boqueria is nearby for fruit, and starbucks is across the street if you miss home and need a pick me up.  

Wouldn't hesitate to stay again, although there are so many great neighborhoods and hotels in Barcelona, next time we may head a little further north into town.
",4,2007,06,01
37,Location!,"This hotel is located in the perfect location.  It is on La Rambla which is one of the main roads in Barcelona.  We were able to walk almost everywhere from the hotel which saved us a lot of money on taxis.  The hotel is modern and since it is in a city the rooms were small.  We had wished it had a pool to sit at like some of the other Barcelona hotels because the weather was beautfiul.  The staff at the hotel were wonderful helping us to select restaurants during our stay.  We would highly recommend eating  at Rosa Vinya. It was a small restaurant that wasn't touristy and the food was amazing.
",4,2007,05,30
37,Loved the Barcelona,"I loved Barcelona and the stay at Le Meridien was a good choice too. Perfectly located at Ramblas (the entrance to the hotel is from side street) and even they were going renovations on I founded my stay just fine. The hotel architecture fits into this part of town but inside the rooms are from 21st century. Ultramodern and incredibly clean - love this. Loved the raishowers - was in my room as well as in the second room we had - corner suite. Large plasma TV and smaller LCDs in bedroom and bathroom were fine as well as small blue nightlight operating when you go to the bathroom at night - cool:). Have not triyed breakfast the coffee from Starbucks next door was fine to go and explore Barcelona. 

I can not say ANYTHING against this stay but my (is it my ""luck"" forever?) usual trouble with fitness - renovation going on so no chance at the hotel and I will not go 2km to Holmes Place and back at night.. S if you wanna stay in one of the best hotels at Ramblas get in and have fun.",5,2007,05,28
37,Be alrert! Unbelievable poor customer handling!,"Once in a life time happened to me.....in the 5-star hotel.........

True Story happened on May 22, 2007: I was back to the hotel room and found that my glass was broken.  Obviously, I did not break it so it must be someone fromt the hotel broke it by mistakes. I took the broken glass to the reception and tried to found out what's happening.  It is very disappointing that they kept me waiting for like 2 hrs and the final answer was that no one was found responsible for this incident.  
In this case, I was absolutely innocent and helpless.  Because to me, a serious short-sighted person, I'm totally blind without the glasses. I felt extremely uncomfortable and is really torturing experience.
Would you choose one hotel treat customer like this? I'm absolutely indoubt.

37,Excellent Location!!!,"I stayed at this hotel with a friend during a girly weekend break.  

Our hotel room was beautiful and had a great view of La Ramblas. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the location was excellent near shops, great cafes and restaurants and only a 10 minute walk to the beach and marina. 

I can't fault this hotel - it was perfect.

37,If it suits your budget then do it.....,"Stayed in a Junior Suite in April for a long weekend.  We asked for one of the refurbished rooms and we were not disappointed.  Room had a main bedroom and a seperate lounge in which my son had a sofa bed.  Both rooms and the bathroom had a TV.  Bathroom was very modern and at night blue lights lit up automatically from the bedroom and lounge to guide you to the loo........  :)

Although on the first floor the room was very quite if the windows were closed and Yes the air conditioning was working!  

All the staff were excellent, really attentive  and friendly - we opted for the inclusive breakfast which was excellent and really set us up for the morning.

Location on top end of Las Ramblas  - excellent.

Welcome drink from the bar and bottle of Cava in our room were also most welcome.....

37,"Location, location, location!","This hotel has the best location in Barcelona, right on La Rambla and a short walk from all the major sights.  We had a large suite with huge bathroom and a sumptuous buffet breakfast was included, which allowed us to skip lunch so that actually saved money.

The room was very comfortable and the lighting, linens and amenities were excellent.  Barcelona is a very exciting city, and being in a good location is crucial in my opinion.

The staff was very friendly and seemed to go out of their way to be helpful whenever we asked for advice or directions.

The only negative was a window in our room looking into the bathroom.  I was with my wife so it didn't bother me, but I could see how it could be embarrasing.  I don't know if this was common to all the rooms or unique in ours.
",5,2007,04,30
37,Perfect Location!,"You cannot ask for a better located hotel in Barcelona. The Le Meridien, is centrally located on La Ramblas - the street that never seems to sleep in Spain, yet is a few meters off the road so that you never hear any sound if you don't want to.

Really nice rooms. I love European stying so I enjoy these rooms - they are a bit small for the price but quite chic. Big 42 inch plasma in the bedroom and another smaller one in the bathroom. The room I am in on the club floor has a lot of funky recessed lighting and if I had one complaint its that even with all the lights on it's not very bright at all. Opening the curtain does the trick but then you've got a bunch of houses looking into your room.

Stay here if you plan on going around town and yet need someplace safe to come back. Barcelona is notorious with pickpockets and this hotel is probably one of the safest places to walk back home without a hassle (since the street is always crowded). It's also perfectly located, the central square is a 2 minute walk away and from there you have every conceivable mode of transportation around town. I chose the hop on hop off bus that departs from there - buy the two day ticket, it's great value at 23 Euro. 

Overall, nice hotel, nice service and location location location.
",4,2007,04,21
37,"Great location, great service, suites a little worn...","Booked a junior suite with SPG points, upgraded to a HUGE Prestige Suite due to a lack of available junior suites. Main living room was at least 30x14 with an additional comfortable sized bedroom, a walk in closet and a bathroom to rival the size of most 3* hotel rooms in Europe. Still the room was definitely worn and in dire need of refurbishment. Unlike the standard (deluxe) rooms, no rain showers or modern fittings. An overall comfortable experience with a VERY convenient location.

Superb service via the front desk. Sheets and pillows to sink into. Decent toiletries. A complementary bottle of reserve Cava. Beautiful views of La Ramblas. They allowed us a check in at 930 am and also gave us a late check out through till 4 pm thanks to my SPG elite status. Free internet access by the lobby was convenient to check in for flights online, that is when teenagers aren't using them for online gaming.

At La Ramblas 109 (hotel is La Ramblas 111) is a Starbucks. Right next door is also a Carrefour Express. BK, McDonalds, KFC, Subway, and several tapas places within a few steps walking. Use 1500 SPG points towards breakfast, a day pass on the sightseeing bus or towards other instant awards. 

Would happily stay there again but I would not pay for a suite though till they are upgraded as well.
",4,2007,04,02
37,Loved the location,"We booked this hotel on Starwood points and stayed in early March 2007. They first gave us a standard room which was recently renovated. The king bed was VERY comfortable and we loved that, but otherwise the room was very narrow (making it feel small) and too high tech for us. Big flat screen TV on the wall and blue lights that go on and off as you walk around the room. Bathroom was okay with a large shower but no tub. We had a problem with the room in that the shower from above was leaking into our shower so we asked for a new room. I mentioned that my husband was a gold Starwood member and they upgraded us to a junior suite. WOW! We loved this room. Very large with a sitting area. This room was the old style which we liked better. Only problem is the mattress is extremely firm. (It hadn't been replaced as in the standard rooms) Didn't bother my husband but I had trouble sleeping until I figured out to pile the large pillows on top and sleep on those (true pillowtop!) I guess nothing's perfect but as we were there for almost a week, having the larger room was great.

What we absolutely loved about this hotel was the location. Right on the La Rambla and you can walk to the Barri Gottic, Placa Catalunya, the port and two metros within minutes. (Don't be afraid to take the metro; we took it with no trouble). Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance and so much atmosphere! I think this was the most perfect location of any hotel we have ever stayed in.

As far as the air conditioning goes - it wasn't turned on yet. They generally turn it on in March but hadn't done so yet, so don't expect air conditioning in the winter months. The original room we had felt stuffy because it was on a lower floor with only one window. The junior suite was on a higher floor with two windows and with them open, we were very comfortable. Our room faced a courtyard so noise was no problem for us.

Maid service was excellent. They serviced our room twice a day. Towels are huge and bed linens excellent quality. All in all a very classy hotel.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the location (right next door to Hotel 1898). Ask for a room higher up as you will get a better view and it will probably be cooler with the window open. If  smallish rooms don't bother you, the new beds are great and probably most people will like the modern style.

As far as restaurants, the Attic (across the street) was okay and  Les Quinze Nits (in the Placa Real) was a bit better (expect to wait in line to be seated). Both were reasonably priced. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on that. There is a grocery store next door and it's much cheaper to buy bottled water, sodas etc. there.

We had some trepidation staying in Barcelona because of reports of street theft. I must admit that I was accosted in the Barri Gottic by two gypsy women who I think were trying to grab my purse. Luckily my husband was with me to throw them off me. We think I might have been targeted because I had a knock off of a designer purse that looks so real they probably thought it was the real thing. Probably not a good move on my part to bring that purse. Anyway I was fine and it wouldn't stop me from going. Barcelona is a fabulous city. Just be careful in crowded areas and hold on to your purse!
",5,2007,03,17
37,NIce hotel,"We stayed for 4 night in a junior suite, with view on the Rambles. Nice big room on the 7th floor, no noise from the street but reconstruction work on the 8th floor was going on till 6 pm. Our suite was not yet renovated but still very nice.

Breakfast was included in our package. If not included you will pay € 28 per person, I think way to much for what you get.  Positive is that breakfast is served till 11.00 am.  And don't be surprised that your room is cleaned during your breakfast!

Prices for the mini bar where also high. Coke for € 4,75 excluding tax is very high. Better go to the nearby supermarket and buy it yourself.

37,Good hotel on a perfect location!,"We've just stayed here for 4 nights in a junior suite and we weren't disappointed! Very spacious room on the 7th floor which faced the very busy La Rambla, but because of the double windows we didn't hear a thing of all the noise outside. The bathroom was large and clean and bathroom amenities were replenished every day, even when, for instance, the tubes of shampoo weren't fully used yet.

The only two downsides of the room were the very (!) firm mattresses and the airconditioning that didn't seem to work well. No matter which temperature we set it on, the same temperature of air seemed to come out. There was some renovation going on at the floors above our room but there was hardly any noise from that. The turndown service was a nice touch and they even cleaned the bathroom again, replaced dirty towels and emptied waste bins after turning down the blankets.

The breakfast buffet was ok; quite pricey (€ 23) and we certainly wouldn't have used it if it wasn't included in the room price.

Food and beverage are very expensive, even for a 5-star hotel! € 5,50 for a (local) beer from the mini bar and in the hotel bar!

The hotel staff at the front desk were very friendly and efficient; so was the staff in the bar. Staff at breakfast was ok; they seemed to be more friendly towards people who speak Spanish, but that was something we encountered in more restaurants.

The location of the hotel is more than perfect: right in the busy centre of Barcelona with all tourist attractions nearby.

All in all a good experience at this hotel!

37,Wonderful Weekend,"From our 1st impression, we were not disappointed! Our rooms were superbly comfortable, the staff helpful & the location fantastic.  This is pure luxury for a weekend break, roll on next year!
",5,2006,12,14
37,Fantastic hotel,"Reading other reviews, I was a bit apprehensive to stay at this hotel.  Recent construction and noise from the street seemed to be the top complaints, though neither was an issue for me.  

I booked the hotel on points, and the staff upgraded my room to a renovated suite with a deck on the 6th floor.  It is in an alley near the middle of Las Ramblas, and so everything was nearby.  There were two computers with free internet access in the lobby, and a carrefore was just around the corner for quick food.

37,Great Service and Location,"I read the reviews for this hotel prior to traveling to Barcelona for a conference at the CCIB and was trying to decide between this hotel and the Hilton Diagonal Mar. I chose this hotel for it's fabulous location and was prepared to deal with the service experiences others had mentioned in their reviews

When I arrived, Sara, the hotel front desk clerk checked me into my room. When I went to it I found that the first thing you saw upon entering was the glass walls that surrounded the bathroom and as I was traveling with someone, I needed more privacy. I went back to the desk and told Sara about this and she took me to see 3 other rooms and I chose Room 529 which had a better privacy alignment of the bathroom to the entrance. The room faced internally and was nice and quiet, especially during the 2 demonstrations that marched down La Rambla during my stay.  

Don't eat at the hotel restaurant. It's expensive (cocktails were 15 euros).  The front desk staff can recommend amazing places to eat within walking distance. Starbucks is 123 steps from the front door of the hotel for your morning coffee and pastry.  

The front desk staff booked our dinner/show at  El Tablao de Carmen, which was an excellent experience.
",4,2006,11,19
37,"Nice hotel, but don't use the concierge service","We stayed in the Le Meridien for 5 nights in October as the final segment of our vacation.  We took bus A1 from the airport directly to Plaza Catalunya and the hotel is a short walk down La Rambla.  

The hotel location can't be any better.  The hotel is few minutes walk from La Boqueria, La Rambla is right outside your window, (if you are lucky enough to get one of those rooms) and 5-minute walk to the Gothic quarter.  Also, if you follow La Rambla all the way to the end, you find yourself in an amazing marina. 

Since the hotel is under construction, there isn't any organization to storing luggage.  There were luggage everywhere in the lobby and that seemed to be a permanent feature of the lobby.  At our 2pm arrival, the only room with king size bed ready for check in faced the back alley.  We took that room regardless.  When we got to the room, she wasn't kidding that it faced the back alley.  We were looking directly into other people's living rooms on the other side of the alley.    

The room is a decent size and the bathroom was great.  Even though we didn't have a tub, the shower had one of those rainforest shower heads.  The room came with all the niceties of robes, slippers, comfortable bed, clean linen, mood lighting and a 42-inch plasma TV.  During our stay, housekeeping was very nice with daily turn-down service.  If you have a ""don't disturb"" sign on, they always leave you a nice note to call when you are ready for turn-down service.  

The two computers with free internet access in the lobby is a great bonus.  

My main issue with the front desk/concierge service is that they insisted that we will get lost on our own and it’s better to take one of their tours when we had transportation questions.  For example, we wanted to take a day trip to Montserrat and asked the concierge for train station location.  They insisted that we will get lost on our own and not enjoy the trip,  and it’s best to book a bus tour with them for 48 euro per person.  On top of that, they would not provide any detail about the metro/train services we had asked.  We ended up looking up the train service in our tour book and took a chance with ""getting lost"".  It turned out that the train station had BIG signs directing you to multiple daily services to Montserrat.  It was a beautiful train ride up the mountain and the monastery was fabulous.  It cost us a whoppy 12 euro per person.  (BTW, we saw the route the bus would've taken, and it could not have been a comfortable ride).  

Just on a side note, hotel staff constantly stood in front of the hotel entrance taking smoke breaks or just hanging out there.  For a 5-star hotel, they could do better than that to their first-impression.    

Overall, the hotel is in a great location, comfortable room, and free internet.  But I think they could do much better for a 5-star hotel and for the price they are charging.

37,Graet Hotel-Fantastic Location !,"I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews for this hotel.However, we need not have worried ! It is a first class hotel in an excellent location right in the middle of Las Ramblas.Despite this you don't hear any noise at night so you have the best of both worlds. We only had Bed & Breakfast option but the breakfasts were excellent - so much choice ! Also breakfast served everyday until 11.00 am - a fantastic plus for me. Who wants breakfast at 8.00 or 9.00 am when you are on vacation ?? Went with my wife and 6 year old daughter and the restaurant staff could not do enough for my little girl including giving her a gift pack with crayons/colouring book etc.No big deal to some I know but it is little things like this that make all the difference ! I cannot see how any other hotel would be better. I went to The Arts Hotel but far too pretentious and too far out of town ! Le Meridien is much better !! Go for it !
",5,2006,10,24
37,Mediocre stay,"While the hotel is in a great location and the remodel is a great design, members of SPG program like myself continue to be dissapointed.

Room:
Contemporary modern style, with a lot of dark wood and red.
Very nice bathroom with flat screen TV. Tub had a curved pad so you could lean back and relax.
Safe too small for a laptop  
Huge plasma TV!   

Hotel General:
Excellent location, so much withing walking distance. Unlike previous guest, I had no trouble finding the hotel as it has a large sign on the roof.
Lobby looks to be last renovated (old elegant style)
2 computers in lobby to print boarding passes, busy, but free.
Internet in room is wired (no wi-fi), and 17 EURO per 24 hours. You can also do .50 cent a min.
Grocery store around corner, plus many great bars, bakeries and places to get coffee (Oliva had amazing cappucino!) less than 1-2 blocks away.
For cheapies, the walk to Placa Catalunya is easy and there you can take the Aerobus to/from BCN for under 4 EUR.

The hotel is busy because of it's history, nice rooms and excellent location. However, they don't seem to take the SPG program seriously.
",3,2006,10,07
37,nice room,"this hotel is undergoing renovation at present but lot's of the rooms have already been altered. the room was spacious with really comfy beds. the bathroom was a glass cube in the room with a door that doesn't quite close- okay if you don't need much privacy!  the only problem we had, which other reviewers have mentioned, was the maid entering the room on about four occasions without checking if we were in. this was annoying and happened early in the morning even when there was a do not disturb sign in use. we complained about this.
the restaurant and bar badly need updating - to compete with the 1898 hotel opposite. lastly, the location is great.
",4,2006,09,27
37,"Good location, tiny rooms","We stayed here for 2 nights using SPG points. As a SPG Platinum, I was advised there were no suites available and was given a regular room. However, I checked in at appx 6 pm and the room wasn't ready. I was given 2 cards for 2 complimentary drinks (each) at the lounge over the 20 minutes I was waiting. 

As the last poster mentioned, the location of the hotel is very hard to find. Luckily, I had asked at the tourist info booth at the airport which gave me a map with the specific location of the hotel. I took the Airport Bus which cost 3.75 euro and takes you right to Placa Catalunya. Walking down La Rambla, it is extremely easy to miss since the sign is facing the opposite way of walking and you have to walk into the side street before you see more signs. 

There is still scaffolding and they were still in the middle of renovations. The lobby is completely renovated and there are 2 free internet terminals just up from the lobby. The elevators were quite tiny but there were separate elevators from floors 1 to 5 and 6 to 9. 

Upon entering my room, it was tiny. For a 5 star hotel, I would consider it unreasonable. The room was entirely renovated with a large plasma tv. The bathroom was very efficiently laid out but the sink is too small to be practical. Interestingly, there was a small LCD tv in the bathroom but I cannot see how this could be used since there is no bathtub but a roman bath. On a good note, there was a small personal space allowed in the ""automatic"" mini-fridge, something I've never seen before.

The location on Rambla is great since you can take either the Catalunya or Liceu metro to anywhere else in the city. I recommend the Liceu metro station which was closer and less busy. My only communication with the front desk was a request for a late check-out the night before. I was curtly told to call back in the morning. I did call back the next morning and no problems with the late check-out. 

I gave it a 2-star based on the fact this is rated as a 5 star hotel. Compared to lesser hotels, I would take this hotel without hesitation. However, I am writing this review from the Hilton Diagonal Mar which is also a 5 star hotel but superior in every way except the location. 

I would not stay at this hotel again unless location was my prime consideration.

37,Queen for a day in Barcelona,"We all know Barcelona is one of the best destinations. It only got better while staying at the Meridien. Just of the Rambla giving me easy access to shopping and dining.

However the maximizer to me was the room and the service of the hotel. Thoughtful and pleasant, putting 5 stars back where it has to be. The ultimate was actually the bed... dream on.

Isn't that all you need from a hotel; great location, bed and service. I'll be back...
",5,2006,09,16
37,"Great hotel, just a few details need improvement but definitely a good choice","The hotel is on La Rambla, right in the heart of where you want to start your trip as a tourist.  It's a little hard to find, because the address is on the La Rambla street, but the entrance is actually on a side street.  That annoyed me to start, the street address the listed right now has some construction so I wandered around for 10 minutes trying to find the hidden entrance.

The room I had was enormous by European standards.  I had a lovely balcony with a nice view.  It was very nice to lie out on the balcony furniture and soak up the sun!  I had a view of hotel 1898 across the street, I think they have a pool...lots of people on the roof...

The bed was super-comfy, the room was nicely appointed.  Stereo was great.  Shower was great.  The bathroom had a floor thermometer to heat the floor, but it did not work in my room.

I would stay here again, I thought it was a terrific spot.  There are probably better hotels, and there were a few kinks which is why I can't give it a 5 rating.
",4,2006,09,05
37,DIFFICULTY WITH FRONT DESK STAFF,"We checked into this hotel in the midst of all the recent airline security issues.  All three pieces of our checked-in luggage were lost.  We were staying at the Meridien for two nights prior to a cruise and were quite frantic thinking we might not have clothing for the cruise, etc.  
When we checked in at approximately 4pm we were told that the hotel had been sold out and the remaining non smoking deluxe room was on the first floor overlooking the roof of the lobby and the dirty skylight on that roof.  We asked for an upgrade (members of Starwood preferred) and were told there were none.  We were offered a smoking room with two twin beds.  When that was too smokey for us, we were promised to be moved the next day.  Needless to say, that never happened. 
The front desk staff was cordial, but I found them to be unhelpful and ungenuine.  They told us that they would assist us with checking on the lost luggage.  They only did so when we were actually standing at the desk .  Even then, one staff memeber decided that he had been put on hold for too long and  just hung up.  One time I called to inquire and was told that the hotel staff had called the airline at 11pm and there was no news.  I reminded him that the airline luggage office closed at 7pm and so they could not have called at 11pm and he covered by saying, ""oh, well, I am sure my associates have been calling throughout the day....."".   
Needless to say,  the loss of luggage was quite frustrating.  If the hotel had not offered to assist,  we would have taken care of the telephone calling on our own.  But the fact that they offered and then really did not follow through at all (and even lied to me) leads me to a pretty low opinion of the property.  The perception was that they truly had no esteem for their cllientele. 
 I will not return to this property.

37,Fantastic weekend,"My husband and I had the most wonderful time at the Le Meridien in Barcelona. We spent 2 nights there using it as a base to explore the city.

The room was fantastic, the service was brilliant and the location couldn't be matched.

All in all a perfect stay. 

One word of caution - use the DO NOT DISTURB sign as the cleaners tend to come round at about 9am which proved a little too early for us!
",5,2006,07,31
37,Some things to work on at  Le Meridian,"Although the location of this hotel is very good, there are a number of other issues that need attention for the price.  Yes, they will walk right in on you.  No knock, no ""housekeeping"" call, nothing, even with the do not disturb sign.  In addition, half the lights in our room did not work.  Maintenance had to come in and change the bulbs.  My elderly parents were in the room next to us and almost killed themselves trying to get into the bathtub, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  They knew they were elderly and I guess just did not think of it.  We ordered a Sprite for our daughter in the bar when our room was not ready and it was 4.50 euros, almost 6 bucks!  Come on, for a Sprite?  And don't count on the wake up call, because 2 our of 3 of ours did not come.  The service downstairs is very good but they loose it once you""ve checked in.  Very comfy beds, though, and great towne/linens.  However, for this kind of money I would try elsewhere.
",3,2006,07,26
37,Nice Place,"The hotel is nice.  Great location, right on La Ramblas, near the outdoor market.  I read some comments about this hotel being noisy, but I had no problems with noise from the street.  There was some noise from some construction next door, but that was more in the lobby area than in the room.  My only complaint was the almost RABID afternoon turndown service.  More than once they just walked into our room (no knock before, no ""hello?""  - nothing).  Just put a key in the door and actually woke us from an afternoon nap with a housekeeper standing in the room - Happend twice - the same day.  I highly recommend using the 'Do Not Disturb"" sign.  Didn't know those were so important...Other than that, the housekeeping staff was great - always had clean towels, service was prompt, great beds (all down), etc.  Modern rooms.  Huge bathroom - even for US standards.  And great showers.  

Also, there are no clocks in the room, so bring your own.  I heard some complaining about missing a few wake up calls, so don't rely on them.
",4,2006,07,18
37,Great Hotel,"I loved Le Meridien in Barcelona.  I think the location is great - very close to La Ramblas.  The hotel was very quiet.  Concierge service was great with great dinner recommendations.  Rooms were very clean with terrific housekeeping service and turn down service.  Robes and slippers in the rooms with chocolates on your pillow.  The bar was a little pricey, so beware.
",5,2006,07,10
37,Tradeoffs,"This location has huge tradeoffs.  The good news is that this is a convenient tourist area with amusing sights such as street performers.  The bad news is that the area also attracts activity such as pickpockets and other mischief.    Factor that risk into your decision whether to stay near Las Ramblas.
",2,2006,06,17
37,"Sleek, convenient, quiet...","The Meridien Barcelona is reminiscent of other Meridiens in other cities in Europe and North America, in several respects:  It is very comfortable, without being decadent; it is modern and sleek, without being soulless; but the service is rather corporate and detached.  Quiet rooms are available on the back side of the hotel, the beds are plush, and the bathrooms are right out of a Malibu beach house -- broadband connections in each room are reliable.  The location, of course, is ideal, with the entrance on a side street steps away from La Rambla.  My only complaints were the overabundance of motion-detecting fluorescent lighting and the Las Vegasy red-and-gray color scheme in the rooms -- both of these features are a bit pretentious -- as well as the quality of food in the dining room, which was surprisingly mediocre.  But for business travelers who don't need to fall rapturously in love with a hotel, this place makes up for those drawbacks with its efficiency and comfort.
",4,2006,04,20
37,"Amazing Hotel, Wonderful Location","We only spent one night in this hotel as our flight was cancelled and we had to find a room for one night.  We got a great rate of 180Euro which included all taxes by making a reservation at the airpot.  The tourist service located inside the airport right beside the huge statue of the horse let us use the phone.  After some haggling with the reservation clerk and saying no thanks several times the deal was struck.  We took the aiport bus 3.60Euro and got off at Placa de Cataluna and after a short walk down Las Ramblas we arrived at the hotel.  It looks plain from the outside but it is amazing inside.  They have flat screens in the room and the bathroom which has interesting frosted glass walls and doors.  I enjoyed my one night at this hotel and hope to return someday.
",5,2006,04,18
37,Great location and good service in Barcelona,"Just got back from a long weekend at the Meridien. We had a really enjoyable time and the hotel contributed to this - except for a few small quibbles. The hotels' location is both a strength and a weakness. The convenience of being right in the heart of things is great but there is no denying it's noisy. The staff from check in to doorman to bar /restaurant staff were unfailingly pleasant and helpful. Our room on the second floor looked great at first glance - large bed ; huge plasma screen tv etc. However there wasn't much floor space left over. The bathroom again looked great - until you tried to use it. The design of the sink and taps is very poor - the tap is incredibly sensitive which combined with the shallow sink is an excellent recipe for getting an unexpected soaking. Then there's the bath tub/shower - the side of the tub is so high that it is extremely dificult to get into the shower. Also we weren't very impressed with the etched glass walls of the bathroom as anyone stood in the public corridor could easily see into the room if the door was opened for any reason. Triumph of form over function. 
On the up side the breakfast buffet/service was excellent and the entertainemnt in the bar was very pleasant for a quiet night cap.
Barcelona was it's usual blowsy self - to borrow a quote from a well known sports bar chain the Ramblas is ""tacky yet unrefined"". There was a lot less of the belligerent begging that I saw last year - maybe because it's early in the season. One point to note is that Sunday afternoon is not a good time to visit the Ramblas - most of the bird stalls packed up after lunch and a lot of the living statues were gone by 3 pm. 
A couple of restuarant recommndations near to the Meridian - Les Quatre Gats (Carrer de Montsio?) and Les Quinze Nits (Placa Reial) - people start queuing for this one before 8 even though it doesn't open till 8:30 - very popular with locals. On the other hand Los Caracoles seems to have gone downhill - very poor service and food not so good as I rememebr. If you have kids the Hard Rock is worth a visit - really fine range of memorabilia - although it's probably the loudest HR I have ever visited!!
",4,2006,03,27
37,Loudest Hotel I ever stayed at,"My first clue was when I walked in and the lobby smelled. Great location - about 1/2 block from Las Ramblas. The problem with 1/2 block from Las Ramblas is that it is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at. It felt like Mardi Gras was happening inside my room. The beds were low to the ground and fluffy and the air conditioning could not work so we were so hot. Car doors slamming and people screaming outside your window all night. We woke up and moved to a hotel down by the water. The bathroom is in the middle of the room with etched clear walls.
",2,2006,03,19
37,Great experience,"Well I must add another excellent review… This is a very comfortable hotel, really good value for money. It’s located in the very heart of Barcelona, La Rambla, and it is very easy to move around from there. My girlfriend and I went there to celebrate our anniversary and we really enjoyed our brilliant choice. I would recommend it to any person who wants their holidays in Barcelona to be just as they should be… FANTASTIC! Breakfast was very good. Room has plenty of nice details and I particularly enjoyed taking a bath watching the bathroom LCD TV. Receptionists very welcoming.
",5,2006,03,03
37,Living as a Queen,"Stayed during the renovation and got upgraded to suite with balcony. Overwhelmed with luxury, comfort and service. What a breath taking view of the city. Our visit was a surprise to my wife and became something she will not easy forget; ""Love it when you treat me as a queen"".

Reception and concierge took all time and covered the details. The bar was heart warming with considerate music and quality cocktails. 

The room was spacious, has a nice balance between classic and modern and the bed was hard to get out of. Hard to imagine that downstairs the world was racing by when upstairs silence gave a royal calmth.

The combination of luxury and location on the Ramblas made it the ideal stay for a romantic but active weekend in the centre of Barcelona.

We'll be back.
",5,2006,02,08
37,Super Base for Las Ramblas & Barcelona,"We stayed here for three nights (Thursday to Sunday). Having read some of the reviews we were a bit apprehensive. We need not have worried - what a super hotel! 

From the doorman rushing to our Taxi to open the door/grab the bags (the ever present security man opened the Hotel door for us whilst he was doing this) to the Receptionist who gave us brochures and maps and instructions after checking us in (imploring us to come back anytime and ask if we wanted anything else - restaurant suggestions, further info on Barca, whatever) to the Barstaff who served us whenever we called in for a drink, the Staff were all superb. Even Staff ""bumped"" into in the lift or corridor spoke without fail with a cheery Hola or Buenos Dais!

The room (fourth floor) overlooked the street below, fair enough not much of a view, just the Hotel opposite, & not much to see each way, but we didn't go to Barcelona to sit in the room and look out of course. 

The room was great in other respects, huge plasma TV, further plasma TV in bathroom, turn down service, Tea & coffee / well stocked mini-bar, very comfortable bed, enough storage space, iron & board etc. heating & air-con which worked as the controls said. Brilliant shower!

Sorry to say we never tried the restaurant, not even for breakfast as we were out so late at night, but others we spoke with found it fine. Breakfast in a Cafe on the Ramblas was fine for us, except for the beggars coming up to our table - the Waiters left them to it and we felt should have moved them on, some were quite intimidating. (Not the street performers - they are different to the Beggars and at least do something before holding their cap or bowl out).

On another food note, we had Los Caracoles Restaurant in Calle Escudellers highly recommended to us prior to our visit, we like to think we are restaurant connoisseurs and frankly we found this restaurant extremely poor to say the least. We went on the Friday night to a pre-booked table that I took the trouble to ring and book over a week before hand from the UK, however we were crammed into a pokey corner and experienced poor service and very poor expensive food. We felt on leaving that it was a case of rush people through as quickly as possible to make way for the large queue waiting speculatively for a table in the bar. After all, most are City Breakers who probably wouldn't come this way again!

We love the Ramblas and spent a good deal of time watching the world go by from a cafe table with either a beer or a coffee. It was about 20 yards from the Hotel door to being on the Ramblas if you like the area.

Back to the Hotel, the piano bar late at night has a couple performing songs (up to 1am) and stays open until 2am, with as mentioned above great Staff to look after you. We like to sit at the bar and chat to other guests, being a 5* hotel stools weren't on offer and you sit at tables for 2 or 4, and the drink prices were very high, but what the heck, you expect that when you book this calibre of Hotel.

In summary, excellent, and we would probably stay there again rather than risk trying somewhere else if we went to Barca again. Two things I would add to the Hotel if I were the Owner, a gym and a pool (if they have anywhere suitable to put them).         

Sorry, didn't get any photos of the Hotel!

37,Felt very welcome,"LOCATION ! LOCATION ! LOCATION !
    
     My wife and I stayed there from 1/8 to 1/13 and were overjoyed. The airport bus at 3.6 euros was a breeze and only 3.6 euros. It left you off near the top of the Ramblas only a short walk to the Meridien.
We found it more convenient to taxi back to the airport on our return at 25 euros.
       The room was a little noisy in the early AM but we got used to it. The bed was enormoud and comfortable. The pillows fantastic. The bathroom was ultramodern, plenty of shelf space,anice deep bathtub
to soak in. It had an adjustable backrest. It also sported an honest to goodness a real efficient American shower.
       Continental breakfast was obcenely priced, but the buffet breakfast was lavish and a comparative bargain.
       The staff was agreeable and helpful. the price of 179 euros plus seemed fair. Would look forward to returning. the hotel did not seem very busy

Maids were very nice and quickly upgraded our room to accommodate 3 people.  Bar staff were great and so friendly - really made us feel welcome.  Live music was wonderful both nights.

The hotel for me was in a great location, great for my pick up point and great for shopping in the evening, which I felt extremely safe doing on my own.

37,Charming central hotel,"We decided to spend a long weekend at this property due to its excellent location and only can highly recommend it: High quality service, extremely nice and helpful staff, caring a lot about our concerns regarding the refurbishments (we had been advised about those before, however we were surprised that we almost did not notice anything). The rooms were great, cozy and confortable. The TV with plasma screen and modern bathrooms are really stunning.... Alltogether an unforgettable stay!

37,What Else Do you Need?!,"I went to Barcelona last week with some colleagues for business purposes, and had the most pleasant stay at Le Meridien Barcelona. The Location is superb, Staff was extremelly polite, very professional and well trained. The concierge was a must booking all our tapas dinner and taxis always on time, extremely helpfull! We were advised that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment prior to our arrival but, to be honest, we hardly noticed it. The room excellent with brand new luxury bathroom. 5 STAR! What else do you need?! To Stay Few More Days!
",5,2005,12,07
37,Couldn't care less,"Good location and that is all.  During the stay the hotel was undertaking major building works - and we are talking here about, for instance, walls being knocked down.  The services were also curtailed, as the hotel was not able to function properly.  However the hotel still charged full rates.

The supposed new deluxe rooms are very small in comparison with other hotels in Barcelona and the value is therefore very poor despite the location.  We found staying in the room both hazardous and unpleasant.  The fittings are similar to cheap retail store fittings (dark wood laminate) and the décor induces feelings of depression.  Really it was design nonsense of style over practicality.  The best part about the room was being able to leave it.

Complaints to the hotel were met with arrogant compliancy.  They probably think that there are enough new customers not to worry.  My advice is to go elsewhere; you will be much happier.

37,Fantastic hotel and unbeatable location,"I just experienced the newly renovated rooms at this beautiful hotel and was totally blown away. The most comfortable bed I ever skept in, huge flatscreen TV and a beautiful bathroom with rainshower and extra TV. The location right in the Ramblas is unbeatable and the service was attentive and caring. I loved every second of my stay!
",5,2005,10,22
37,Charming stay in Barcelona,"My wife and I were in Barcelona for 3 days. We got a good deal at this otherwise pricey hotel. The rooms and service were really fantastic, especially by European standards. We got a very nice room, luxury bathroom and nice amenities. The location of this hotel is where you want to be if you are calling Barcelona. All landmarks, shops, night life, theatres are next door or at a stonethrow away. The staff was courteous and always helpful. The turndown service with hotel slippers and chocolates made us feel very special. The concierge were helpful in confiming our flights to Rome and making reservations for us in local restaurants (nice tapas restaurants!). Try to have breakfast included, as it is a very nice European spread, inclusive of cappuccinos or whatever you want. The hotel is quite historic. If you are looking for a place which is charming, does not feel like a typical large chain, and is luxurious, stay here.
",5,2005,10,04
37,"Okay rooms, horrible restaurant...","Now we know why the Mediterranean suites were so cheap.  The room itself is nice enough (with a large bed, deep loveseat and chair, Mediterranean-themed carpet and wall colors, decent-size TV, etc...), but the views from the terrace can be marginal (unless you like looking down on alleyways, tin roofs, and into other people's apartments nearby), and the air conditioning doesn't seem to work.

Oh, and the hotel doesn't have any fans.  Fortunately, there is a supermarket a half-block up Las Ramblas (on the same side of the street), owned by the Carrefour consortium (which means it's much like most any other major supermarket chain you might encounter in Europe).  On the first floor, they've got fresh vegetables, drinks, personal grooming products, electrical equipment (including fans), etc....  Make sure to check your bag in at the front desk before you enter the store, and keep in mind that if you're going to use a shopping cart that the only way downstairs (to all the packaged food, dairy products, fresh meats and cheeses, etc...) will be the elevator on the right, and is not well marked unless you're looking up at the signs above your heads.  Otherwise, you'll want to stick with a hand-basket and the escalator or stairs.

The bed in this room is amazingly hard -- the hardest bed I think I've ever tried to sleep on.  I'm not sure, but I may have had a softer ""bed"" at times in the past when I was camping, with my sleeping bag on the ground.  Or when I was crashing with friends, laying directly on a hard concrete floor with a thin layer of carpet.  But my wife is absolutely in love with the pillows -- they give each of you a huge two foot by two foot ""back"" pillow, and a smaller pillow to use while sleeping, and they are high quality down/feather.

But why have a nice bathroom with lots of marble and mirrors, if you're going to get a sewer stink?  We passed a sewer on Las Ramblas, so we know for sure what that smell is, we just can't be 100% certain where it's coming from in the bathroom.  And why have just one bar of soap in the bathroom?  Don't you want a large one in or near the bath/shower, and a smaller one near the sinks?  After you've washed yourself in the shower with the large bath bar, do you want to use that same bar again to wash your hands or face in or over the sink?

Note that the shower is very powerful (enough to hurt, if you turn it on full strength), and can get very, very hot -- Think McDonald's coffee hot.  I like hot showers, and I like long showers.  I could only turn the handle very slightly past the halfway point before I felt like I was being scalded.  And the hot water never ran out.  The tub is also very deep, but is made out of plastic and was rather disconcerting to feel it moving underneath my feet.  I later decided that it was intentional to have the floor of the tub have a slight ""give"" to it, to make it feel a bit softer and more comfortable.  It also has raised spots spread throughout, which I presume is intended to have some sort of massage effect on your feet. 

The electrical power in the room is also marginal -- we lost all power earlier today, but we're not sure if it was a breaker that flipped or a result of the construction.  We were leaving at the time, so it didn't really matter.  But I would be very concerned if that kind of thing happened when we were going to be in the room for a while.  Tonight, we've noticed that all the other lights in the room will flicker when you turn on another electrical device.

Also note that most of the lights in the room are compact fluorescent, which tend to give off a kind of greenish glow, and don't put out a lot of light.  If you have seasonal affective disorder, or get depressed at night if you have bad lighting, be warned.  There are lights on the terrace, and they can feel pretty bright at night.

The light switch by the door controls the power to the small halogen lamps in the ceiling near the door (over the desk), but also controls the power to the small halogen lamps in the alcoves and the floor-standing halogen lamp in the bedroom.  Unfortunately, the floor-standing lamp is fairly weak (I'm guessing 100 watt or 150 watt, instead of the standard 300 watt).  It took us a while to figure out how to turn on the floor-standing lamp, and even had the engineer come up to take a look at it to see what needed to be fixed.

Avoid room 627 at all possible costs.  It is long and thin (and weirdly shaped), with a tiny breakfast/living area at one end, and a tiny bedroom area at the other (just barely large enough to contain the bed).  The air conditioning does work well, but it drips -- make sure you don't put anything underneath the vents on the ceiling in the hallway area.

This room may have two TVs (one in the living area and one in the bedroom area), but the one in the bedroom area can't display any of the on-demand movies or other special content.  You can get the small selection of satellite TV channels, and that's it.

The one saving grace of room 627 is that it has a much larger and nicer terrace than any of the other Mediterranean suites, with views of three sides of the hotel.  The other suites on the sixth floor look out mostly onto other nearby buildings.

As far as the food is concerned, the room service menu is very minimal.  The soups have been good, the single-serving size margarita (only cheese, no sauce or other toppings) pizza is hand-tossed thin-crust style (which my wife likes but I don't), the club sandwich is very good, the chicken with green tagliatelle pasta was okay.

But whatever you do, do *NOT* eat dinner in the restaurant downstairs.  It looks nice enough, the dinner is buffet-style (which my wife and I thought we would appreciate), but the food itself was marginal at best.  It took me a long time to figure out when I last had cafeteria style food that was worse -- I had to go back to school lunches that I had in sixth grade, and even some of them were better.  And the restaurant downstairs is Euro-style expensive, with dinner for one person running something like 30 Euros.

The bar looks nice, and they're supposed to have live entertainment Tuesday through Saturdays.  We haven't actually done anything there, but I think it would be hard to screw that up too badly.

If your room is on the fifth floor or below, you have two elevators to choose from.  If you're on the sixth floor or above, there is only one elevator, which is apparently also shared with the staff.  You can get three people in one of these elevators, but that can be a tight fit.

37,Fantastic new rooms,"Just visited on business this renowned hotel. I was thrilled to stay in one of their recently refurbished rooms that have turned this hotel in one of the most elegantly designed in Barcelona. The quality of the matress, pillows, rainshower and generally the materials used throughout the room are superb...its been years since I have slept so confortably. 

Added benefits are a huge plasma TV, a very confortable red armchair, a blue night light that guides you to the bathroom without disturbing your partner and a userfriendly lighting system. I also found the complementary shower gel to be very envigorating.
 
Cannot wait untill the public areas are refurbished. If they are going to be anything like the rooms this will surely be the best hotel in Barcelona. Overall the staff were very helpull, above the level that you would expect from a five star hotel. I strongly recommed you vist this hotel!
",5,2005,09,30
37,"Nice rooms, horrible service","The rooms are nice - what you would expect for a hotel of this class.  However, the service is non-existent.  First, when we checked in, there was nobody available to help with our bags.  Then, they gave us a room with 2 double beds, even though we reserved a room directly through the hotel website requesting a king-sized bed.  We immediately asked to change rooms, but they had no king-sized beds available and they would give us a new room the next day.  The next day, I called again and the front desk had no idea I made the request the day before.  After some arguing, they relented and gave us a room with a king size bed.   Also, the concierge made us a reservation at the wrong restaurant, and they were unable to help us rent a car.  The final blow was when leaving, we requested a taxi to the train station.  The taxi driver and the bellhop appeared to know each other.  The driver charged us 18 euros for what should have been a 9 euro taxi ride.  We suspect the bellhop got a cut.

A lot of people complain about the noise, but fortunately both rooms we had were not facing Las Ramblas, so noise was not an issue for us.

If you want to stay in a luxury hotel, stay at the Arts Hotel, or any of the luxury hotels on the Diagonal.  Le Meridien Barcelona is a rip-off.  Also, while we thought the location directly on Las Ramblas was convenient our first night, we realized later it is not worth staying right smack in the middle of everything.  There are plenty of luxury hotels that are in safer areas (especially around Rambla Catalunya) and are walking distance to Las Ramblas and the Barri Gotic.  Don't stay here!  You will be sorry!
",2,2005,09,19
37,BEWARE:  You will regret staying here.  The noise is unbearable.,"I just returned from the Le Meridien Barcelona.  What a horror!  The noise is unbearable.  It makes you want to jump out the window!  It's horrible beyond imagination.  It is a constant, extremely loud, pounding, from which there is no escape.

Worse yet, before I went, I asked if there would be noise, and was told 'no'.  I was told that the renovations were finished.  Apparently, their goal is to now finish sometime in mid-2006.  Personally, I wouldn't believe them, and I would avoid this hotel for a long, long time.  They lied to me about being finished with their renovations, when there are no where near finished.  How can they be trusted?  Renovations of this scale can last for years.

This is the first time I have every posted on a travel site.  I tried to get out of the hotel as soon as I arrived, but could not for 2 days.  I asked for another room, but was told that all rooms are just as bad.  

Le Meridien should shut this hotel down with this much noise.  They are milking people to cover their expenses, but not providing a place of quiet enjoyment.  When I suggested a reduction to the rate based on the noise, the manager became insulting and accused me of trying to get something for nothing and abruptly said that no discount whatsoever would be provided.  I was shocked at the manager's rudeness, but promised myself that I would post this review so that others would be forewarned.  

You would be better off at a quiet 2 star hotel, than this terrible hotel.  There are many, many, less expensive hotels all around this hotel.  Stay at any other hotel!

The renovations start early in the morning, and go late into the day.  It is a constant sound like metal slamming against stone, and it echos throughout the hotel.  

Forget about sleeping in, and forget about an afternoon nap.  It's a bad joke.  Le Meridien as a chain, has/had a decent reputation, but this place is terrible and the management is rude.  

You should have seen the front desk.  The customers were lined up complaining all around me.  Every time I went by the front desk, people were complaining. The staff is oblivious to the customers' complaints.  They just do not care.  They know exactly what they are doing:  They are calculating that it is better for them to take in the cash flow at the cost of alienating the transitory tourists who stay there.  It really should be a crime what they are doing.

Barcelona has so many hotels.  Don't be suckered into staying at this hotel like I was!
",1,2005,08,29
37,Beware of the renovations,"We booked our trip to Le Meridien on a last minute deal, hoping for a comfortable (at least) stay in a 5* hotel in a great location.
We were dissaopinted on arrival to find that due to the renovations, our room was not ready for us. 

We were put up for the night in a hotel opposite (Hotel Montecarlo - absolutely impeccable may I add). The room we were given was a beautiful suite, and whilst this was a nice compensation and the staff did all they could, it didn't really make up for being unable to unpack and relax properly. 

We had to check out of the ""replacement"" hotel the next morning, but were told that our room in Le Meridien would not be redy until 2pm. 
This was understandable, but waiting for our room to be ready was not how we would have planned our first day in Barcelona. We pottered about in lovely Barcelona until 2.30pm, at which time our room was still not ready. We had been upgraded to a suite, and were told that as it was a larger room, it would take longer to clean. It was finally ready at 3.30pm. 

We were happy with the room (though it was not as good as the other hotel), but mostly as it meant that after 24 hours in the city, we finally had somewhere to shower, rest and avoid the sweltering midday sun. The ceiling had a large stain on it, and the room was a little average, if larger than we had expected. 

Whilst we could not have any complaints about their service, it does not make up for the fact that we effectively lost a whole day in Barcelona (out of three - a large proportion of our trip) waiting around for a room. I would advise you to hold off from staying at this hotel until the refurbishment is complete. You will have no problems otherwise, as the hotel is absolutely fine, but I would still say that it lacks personality. 

The location is great and the rooms are quiet despite being on La Rambla. My final remark is that on our last day (having not been woken up by the wake up call we ordered which never called!), we were presented with a bill for the other hotel we had stayed in. Of course this was resolved but 5* service it was not. 

If you have already booked, don't be alarmed, you will have a pleasant stay, but just be aware that the renovations are still underway.
",3,2005,08,10
37,Will be more Above Average when remodel is complete,"We waited and waited and snagged 2 rooms at the Le Meridien when we found a good price. The deals are out there. 

I think we were in the midst of a heatwave in Spain. We arrived to find a hot, hot lobby, hot, hot hallways and hot, hot elevators but really cool rooms (both style and temperature)! Seriously, the common areas were unbearable. The newly remodeled rooms are modern and great. Awesome beds, interesting lighting and fixtures. It took some time to figure out the multitude of lighting choices (switches everywhere would do different things every time you used them) and the workings of the tv were a bit of a puzzle (it would stay on or not turn on). GREAT shower, Plasma TV too. The air-conditioning in the rooms worked perfectly and the rooms were quiet enough so that you could not hear other guests. Especially when the windows were closed, you could barely hear outside noise. 

You could, however, hear construction in the hotel and across the street (the contractors on that building chose to take their coffee breaks sitting on the roof of their adjacent building to watch the goings on in the hotel rooms) but that won't last forever.

They offer free admission to an excellent, top rate gym/spa facility with an indoor pool but it is a 10 minute walk away.

The common areas were not inviting to relax or hang out in. That was dissappointing since we were traveling with friends and found ourselves just retiring to our seperate rooms. We did see some famous people who were there as guests. The restaurant was very average (even for breakfast) but they are building a new one right on Las Ramblas. The staff was incredibly helpful and made some excellent, non touristy recommendations.

We sought out the Le Meridien because of it's class of hotel (listed as a 5 star) and it's proximity to Las Ramblas. Consequently, it's kind of a contradiction. Las Ramblas sure has the activity level we were interested in but it's kind of on the ""seedy"" side. Although we never felt our safety was at risk there is a bit of an element there.

We found ourselves walking up passed the Placa Catalunya and spending our evenings on Rambla De Catalunya (higher up on La Rambla) or Passeig De Garcia where the nicer cafe's and stores are. I think a better choice would have been to stay there and visit the Las Ramblas madness for measured doses.

Not unhappy with our choice but we might consider a different location next time.

37,Great hotel in Barcelona,"We wanted to be near the La Ramblas shopping & cruise pier. This hotel was all we wanted & much more, just steps from shopping & the exciting La Ramblas ""mall"" with all the street performers, large grocery store, great produce market place, restaurants, Metro station & 5Euro cab ride to the cruise pier. 
 Smart, new, super clean Art- Deco rooms, state of the art plasma TV, HUGE bathtub w/fancy back support so that you could watch the 2nd TV in the bathroom, the BEST most comfy down pillows & bed (pillows were not available for purchase, because we inquired) & beautiful bath amenities.       
  Friendly front desk staff & bellmen, all who spoke English; all staff also served as concierge & information desk, which the hotel lacked.
  Most unique feature in our room was that when you got out of bed to go to the bathroom at night (in the dark), there was some kind of sensor that turned on a soft blue light on the floor and in the bathroom!
  We had the $25 buffet breakfast that included all you could drink Cava (Spanish champagne), a little pricey for what was offered, but food was fresh & good, friendly servers.
  Our only regret was that we only had time to spend 1 night here before our cruise.
",5,2005,05,22
37,"Simple, complicated and expensive....","Stayed in this hotel for 5 days, early in April. Called ahead to verify they had aircondition rooms and the answer was yes. Upon arrival, try to set the AC to cool the room, but didnt work. Called the front desk and the answer was that they did have AC but that it will not be available until the end of the month. Therefore had to sleep with the window open, lots of noises from people at La Rambla, garbagge truck at 4:00 am and other nightly noises. 

Bar was very expensive, 2 drinks and a couple of entrees was $70.00. Staff not very friendly, would help you if asked, but they didnt went out of their way to help.  Hotel was under renovation.  Rates are rather expensive, but so are other hotels in Barcelona, US$ to Euro dosent help either.

They have 2 PC's with internet in the lobby, that was nice and in the room the best thing was the bed, very comfortable.

The area is not very good, has changed a lot for the worse. NOT a family hotel, and I would probably stay at another location in the future.
",3,2005,05,11
37,modern hotel in the heart of downtown Barcelona,"My two toddlers, my husband, and I stayed in a suite at Le Meridien, Barcelona.  Service was great, with turndown twice/day, chocolates on bed every day, great amenities and the room was very spacious - enough to accomodate a king-sized bed, a cot, and a crib without feeling cramped.  It is located right in the heart of downtown Barcelona with many touristic attractions within walking distance or a few minuites in a taxi ride.  The street is very very busy, but the hotel does a good job of blocking out the noise once windows are closed.  
It was great for us also because a market is located right next to it - for last minute needs of milk, juice, diapers, etc.
The only thing about the hotel that was less superb was the restaurant and brunch.  The breakfast menu is not impressive for the price, and the decor is too homely/country-style which is not in accord with the rest of the hotel (The lobby and rooms are decorated in sophisticated modern style).
Parking is also additionally charged and fairly expensive.  There is no pool or gym or spa on site.
",4,2005,04,29
37,Very Shoddy,"Very unimpressive.  The hotel is undergoing a refit.  I stayed in a recently refurbished room.  It looked great, was clean etc.  It failed however on all the bits that make a difference.  Morning alarm calls never happened (I overheard a number of guests complaining as they missed or were late for meetings!.  The appliances (phone, plasma screen TV etc) were all being repaired when I arrived and did not work after the electrician left.  The sound of heavy drilling started at 08.00 and continued throughout the day.  For the money there are better places to stay
",1,2005,04,28
37,Wonderful!,"Having telephoned Le Meridien at 1800 hrs having checked out as quickly as checking in at a nearby hotel which was a dive, we had a fabulous time.  The staff were attentive, the rooms spacious to say the least (we got a great deal as a late booker on a couple of suites), the piano bar relaxing and the location excellent.  Highly recommended.
",5,2005,04,25
37,Brilliant hotel,"Stayed in the hotel as a special treat for my husband and I . We could not fault the room with own private terrace giving views across Barcelona. We could easily view La Ramblas, the Olympic stadium, cathedral and port with out leaving our room. The staff were excellent and could not do enough to help. The breakfast was pricey at 23 euros for continental breakfast but the mini bar was reasonable and well stocked. You may need to do some weight training to be able to wear the very heavy, fluffy bath robes and you may need a compass to find your way around the very large beds but the chocolate left by the bedside every night helps to keep your strength up. Our daughter also loved the teddy bear we brought back for her. Didn't eat in the restaurant but the menu looked varied and reasonably priced. Drinks in the bar were also averaged priced and you get free nibbles.
",5,2005,04,20
37,Excellent Hotel,"Just completed a short stay post--renovation (the hotel re-opened on March 3, 2005) and found the establishment to be excellent.  We got an internet deal on a king-bedded room (which otherwise would have run to 390 Euros per night..pricey by most folks' standards I am sure) and were very pleased with the accommodations.  We particularly like being in/near the Gothic Quarter so this hotel offers a perfect location for us.  La Ramblas can be quite noisy yet we heard absolutely no noise in our room whatsoever.

I researched various other establishments and on previous occasions have stayed in the nearby Colon which has an unbeatable view of the gothic cathedral. However, the current scaffolding on the cathedral prompted us to look elsewhere for a place to stay.  The LeMeridien now far surpasses that hotel in terms of appointments, etc., and the staff were absolutely helpful and responsive in every way.

I find it interesting that MANY Barcelona  hotels pointedly like to brag that they are ""near La Ramblas.""  Why stay ""near"" when you can stay right there?  We will definitely return to this hotel in the future and already have a reservation for July 2005.
",5,2005,03,19
37,"Beautiiful room, beautiful view","My wife and I stayed here for four nights in February 2004.  Our room was probably the most beautiful we have ever stayed in -- and included a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas, which was a special treat.  I am surprised that some reviews have complained about chipping paint, and a run-down appearance.  Perhaps the hotel has been renovated since those reports were written.  Our room was spotless and spanking new.  The decorating was modern and new and clean.  The bed was very comfy and the bath was spacious and modern.  I believe we were given a more luxurious room than we paid for -- it was a treat.  The staff were fine, but we didn't have many dealings with them.  I recommend this hotel without hesitation if you want to be in the heart of Barcelona and stay in comfort.  There are cheaper alternatives, but you get what you pay for.  We wanted to treat ourselves and we did.

Basicaly the top 10 attractions of the city are within a 5 minute walk!. And the shopping!. I handed over the shopping bags to the doorman every hour or so to not to have to carry so much. That is convenient shopping. Furthermore the staff is very helpful and friendly ( and for real! ). Everything in the hotel just works. You do not get any no. No hassles. We had a great room overlooking the always busy Ramblas, and not a noise to hear. I will go back for sure!

37,3 star for 5 star price,"Although we liked this hotel for the location it was in no way a 4 or 5 star hotel!   We were highly disappointed when we checked in and attempted to cancel our reservation but they wouldn't allow it so we were stuck there.  They gave us an ""upgrade"" to a slightly better room but the bathroom was still very old and seemed dirty even after cleaning, there was no clock in the room, the wake up call was 25 minutes late one morning and there is no concierge. The staff attempt to give restaraunt recommendations but they didn't match up with what we were looking for.
",2,2004,07,15
37,Great hotel,"Would echo previous comments - a very good hotel indeed. We stayed for 2 nights in an executive room (expensive at 300 Euros but there was nothing else available - we moved from other accommodation at the last minute) and it was immaculate and very big with a great view over the rooftops. There was a huge marble bathroom with underfloor heating and also a sizeable walk-in wardrobe.

The bed was king-sized and nice and firm (but not too hard). We also had a large sofa and glass coffee table.

The hotel's location cannot be faulted. Would heartily recommend, especially if you can get a better deal than we did by booking early.

37,Le Crap instead of Le Meridien,"Just came back from a 4 night stay. The rooms are from a Holiday Inn, and on top of that the A/C was not turn on on the hotel because it was still spring, that was what I was told by the Hotel manger. The sugested me to open the windows so i could air the room out, that brought the other problem, when you open the windows it is as if the rambla just got inside your room. You can hear every single sound from the street, including the construction going on across the street and inside the hotel. I spoke to managment several times and they said that there was nothing they could do. So i spent 4 nights sweeting and not sleeping very much. This is something not acceptable from a 5 star hotel, this hotel is realy a 3 star hotel. It is the last time i stay in this and any other Le Meridien Hotel.",1,2004,04,19
37,good hotel great location.,"Le Meridien is an excellent hotel,very friendly staff,really good room and a first class location just 20yards walk to Las Ramblas. Barcelona is a friendly city, the turistic oen top buses are a great way to see a lot of the city,the cable car across the port is a must do, but the other cable car up to Montjuic castle is even better and the views are WOW!!",5,2004,03,25
37,Fab hotel - great location,"Stayed here on a conference in June for 3 days. It was super, the deluxe rooms were very nice. Food was very good, adn the location, step out the door and you are on the Ramblas",5,2003,12,31
37,Fantastic,"We stayed at Le Meridien for a long week weekend in December 03. The hotel is fantastic, the rooms are large and we were upgraded to a suite as the trip was a birthday surprise. The suite was wonderful. The breakfast is good but the bar is very, very expensive. The location couldn't be better - right on Las Ramblas. Staying here really made a difference. Although its an expensive hotel, its definately worth it as a special treat. I'd definately stay here again (if I could afford it!).",5,2003,12,17
37,Verdict: Excellent Location but only 4 Stars not 5,"We spent 4 days at the Meridien in Barcelona at the end of October/early November 2003.Breakfast was excellent, staff were friendly  though some were not trained to a 5* standard, Gin & Tonics were very expensive (£10 each). Chambermaid service was poor (table tops were still marked the next day, used, wet towels were folded and left for reuse). Generally we didnt feel the room was worth £220 per night.On the day of departure, hotel staff came in twice to check the room  we were still in bed! One would assume a 5* hotel has some sort of checking system in place to verify which guests have already checked out.",4,2003,11,04
37,3 rather than 5 star hotel,We found the hotel was not clean at all and when complaining hotel staff did not help us at all. On top of that hotel is tired and need investment. Well maintained 3 rather than 5 star hotel. It is in a great location if you want to go out in the town at night. One of My reservation was the cost $287 for a twin room with out free tea and coffee facilities. After 2 nights we moved to Hotel Majestic for lower price and a real five star hotel.,1,2003,10,28
37,Fantastic hotel - The BEST location,"In short, a wonderful hotel. The location is absolutely excellent, at the top end of Las Ramblas, ideally situated for all the many sights Barcelona has to offer. Staff are friendly and efficient. The room was beautifully decorated in a modern Mediterranean theme. Despite having a room overlooking Las Ramblas, the rooms are soundproofed and no noise could be heard from the street below. Breakfast was excellent; everything you could imagine and more.",5,2003,07,28
37,excellent experience,"Just spent three nights with my girlfriend at the Meridien while in Barcelona mid july 2003. I am surprised at what the previous evaluator wrote. The location of the hotel is perfect, at the top of the ramblas.....so it is safe (and my girlfriend's gucci purses were not stolen!), and is not only in the tourist section, on a side street, but is also a four minute walk away from Exiample, which is refined and has all the shopping. it is also within walking distance to all the other old parts of town, and several museums. Their buffet breakfasts are among the best in Europe, and their orange juice heavenly. Their service was excellent, and every employee's smiles were so evident. And best of all, they upgraded us for a nominal fee to their presidential suite, and so we experienced the top floor: awesome views, three balconies, three plush rooms, marble bathrooms, dessert under the full moon....it can't get any better! Will most highly recommend the place. 
For great dinner experiences, try both Tragaluz, in Exiample, and Pla, in a hidden old part of town.",5,2003,07,27
37,Superb location & staff,"We spend a wonderful few days in Le Meridien during April 2003. When we arrived at the hotel (20 mins taxi ride from airport) we were very impressed with the friendly staff who greeted us. Check in was simply and quick and we were given a room on the second floor. The room was nice, usual stuff . . . TV (international), large tiled bathroom and desk. The room was spotless although the view from the window was towards a apartment block building - but as this was the centre of Barcelona city, you are hardly going to expect views of green pastures and grazing sheep!This brings me onto the hotels main selling point . . . LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! It is located on the busy ""tourist"" area of Les Rambas which is easy walking distance to the marina, Picasso museum and lots of other top attractions. Sagrada Familia (Gaudi Unfinished Temple) is loacted a couple of stops away on the efficient Metro Underground railway and is well worth the trip, especially if you take the lift up to the top of one of the towers - amazing views!The Zoo is also worth a visit, we spent a good day there seeing all it had to offer - the main attraction was the cute chimp babies and the only white albino chimp in captivity.Back the the hotel, the breakfasts were great - a buffet style. We didnt eat dinner within the hotel simply because there is a huge choice outside the door, recommended is Ideal Restaurant (3 minutes from hotel on Les Rambas) as we had a nice piella there one evening.In summary, if you want a great hotel for a few days city break in Barcelona look no further than Le Meridien, you wont be disappointed - we werent!",5,2003,07,14
37,Friendly staff,"I found that the Le Meridien was a friendly, clean, well maintained 4 rather than 5 star hotel.  It is in a great location if you want to go out in the town at night. My only reservation was the cost £135 for a twin room with out free tea and coffee facilities, I guess cost is relative and Barcelona is expensive. 4Gats  A previous reviewer recommended this restuarant as did a friend.  Our experience was rather an unpleasant one. The staff were unfriendly, we waited what seemed like ages to order a drink. The food was average and was certainly no better than the cheaper restuarants we had been in but of course much more expensive.  We had to send one dish back as the meat was cold and the sauce luke warm, of course there were no aplogies.  My friend was told in a very  condescending manner that she could not purchase a glass of wine, she had to purchase a half bottle if she wanted a single glass.  We started with a main course but decided not to continue with a desert or coffee,  we waited ages for the bill and it was only when I stood up and put my jacket on did the bill swiftly arrive.  This restaraunt seems to have major 'attitude' which is not backed up by the quality of the food.  Perhaps, if we had been regulars of fitted their main client base, we would have been treated better , I say 4Get 4Gats!!",4,2003,03,24
37,Great Location,"I stayed here in November 2002.  Fantastic location on the busy interesting ""Ramblas"".  Room (was a small suite) was  a little run down.  Furniture too old, bathroom tile chipping and showing age. Noisy rooms, could hear rooms on either side and noisy maids in the hall.  Nice staff.  No extras at hotel.  I thought I saw where they advertised an excercise room.  But I was wrong, they have an ""arrangement"" that we can use a gym a ""10 minute walk"" away for free.  Too much of a hassle.  A ""five star"" hotel could take one room and make it into a gym.  Very nice staff.  I have no idea why they call this a five star hotel.  I wouldn't.  I'd probably stay elsewhere the next time.  The price is too high for just an ok place with great location.  Make sure to eat at ""4gats"" restaurant, just a five minute walk away.  FANTASTIC food.

37,Excellent !!!,"Good morning!

Between July 22 and 25, my wife and I were invited at Le Méridien Barcelona. The hotel in Barcelona was one of many we were on our holiday trip this year. From the beginning, the moment we checked in, we were surrounded by extraordinary attention and hospitality from Mr. Edi, the front desk clerk. Mr. Edi is an extremely cultured person, smiling, very patient, to the point, impeccably Pro, with his own presence and style in addition to a Pro with guests, he made us feel at home, while talking to someone close to us. Our hotel room is, as always, sterile and functional, thanks to the housekeepers, every day, creating a unique microclimate thanks to the air conditioning that works quietly on these hot days. In the breakfast restaurant, a menu that met our expectations and a hospital staff. The whole machine, which operated so efficiently, was supervised by Mr. Juan Soler-Peter, Director General, who was visible every day. In the hotel we could see that we were facing a Pro, an entrepreneur, a manager, a person who felt what he did and knew what he did. You can see the hotel’s Pro face, the result of the Director’s extensive knowledge in the hotel sector, his vast experience resulting from many years of Pro practice, his specific instinct and a person hungry for success. Another gentleman at the hotel reception said goodbye to us. A very hospitable, patient and polite person who, as we saw, had full control when we waited and was able to explain everything in detail to clients dealing with their individual issues.

Once again, we would like to thank all the hotel staff for creating unforgettable moments during our holiday trip, which is still ongoing. People who noticed us at every turn were always close, but not intrusive.

Mr Director, congratulations to the crew and we wish you 110% occupancy every day, because it is the people who create this unforgettable atmosphere.

Aldona y Robert Szparaga",5,2024,07,26
37,I ONLY EXPOSE THE TRUTH,"Very good location if you want to be on ""Las Ramblas"" which is the most popular and iconic street in Barcelona but with the consequent capacity of many people, the building is old, well preserved but with limitations both in the hotel lobby and in its restaurants. which are not very big and offer very few tables with a pleasant view, most of them have interior views towards walls and need a better quality update in both furniture and decoration, as for the rooms I stayed in a Deluxe 2 twins and I must point out that it had very little luxury, the furniture is NOT luxurious although of acceptable quality for a 4 * not 5 * hotel, the same in regards to the beds and their bedding and pillows (they leave much to be desired) the air conditioning worked but without being able to regulate the temperature although the air flow through the fan could be varied, it is very old equipment, the view of the flat room VERY UGLY to a service patio and a piece of land belonging to another property that appears to have been demolished, the construction that occupied it, the bathroom of acceptable size with sliding doors and a not very efficient ventilation system, the service of the people who work there is generally good. Thank you Paula for your treatment, Professionalism and efficiency are outstanding, Salvador, you should not have the position you have, you are inefficient and rude. The cleanliness of the hotel in both rooms and common areas is quite good and the attention and security of the people at the entrance door, as well as the people who assist with luggage, is excellent. In conclusion, the Price/Quality ratio does NOT correspond to a 5* hotel when at most it can be 4* and what they call luxury is definitely not, their advertising is misleading I did not see anything (except the attention of the majority of the employees) that could be worthy of a 5* hotel",3,2024,06,18
37,Excellent!!!!,"The hotel is excellent in every way. From breakfast to the room. And the staff is very, very friendly. They make your stay an incredible experience. Special mention for Federica. Relentless",5,2024,05,02

The Hotel is attractive, the staff welcomes you. The common areas and rooms are impeccably clean and well maintained. The location of the Hotel is fantastic, close to everything.

 We loved and totally enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien. From the moment we arrived to the morning we left, it was nothing short of exceptional. All the staff are outgoing and very friendly. It also makes you feel valued as a customer. They all show the desire to meet their needs with excellence and passion for their work.",5,2024,04,19

37,The city of Christmas lights,"You want to know the cosmopolitan of Barcelona, well this is the place to stay, full rambla, where everything converges in the immigrants of this universe, take care of yourself at night because like anywhere there are many people who own other people's things, don't get distracted by enjoying the lights of a classic Spanish New Year's Eve",5,2024,02,02
37,An experience not to forget,"My name is Danilo and I am writing this review to tell you that it was an unforgettable experience.

37,Vorsicht bei Reservierungen in diesem Hotel,Ich habe dieses Hotel über booking.com reserviert mit kostenloser Stornierungsmöglichkeit. Aufgrund von Terminüberschneidungen mußte ich das Hotel wenige Tage vor der Anreise stornieren. Diese Stornierung war kostenlos. Trotzdem wurden die Nächte meiner Kreditkarte belastet. Inzwischen warte ich schon drei Wochen auf die Rückzahlung des Hotels eines nicht unerheblichen Betrages. Eine Entschuldigung seitens des Hotels für diesen Fehler gab es auch nicht. Für mich ein sehr unseriöses Verhalten und Grund dieses Haus niemals wieder zu buchen.,1,2022,09,30
37,Al Meridien come a casa. ,"Eh si. Al Meridien ti senti come a casa. Trovi gentilezza e cortesia ovunque, al banco della reception o al ristorante, dalla cameriera che ti rifà la camera al Security all'ingresso. E dopo 2 anni e mezzo di assenza da Barcellona, riprovare le stesse sensazioni è stato un vero piacere. 
E poi la posizione è impagabile. 
Non vedo l'ora di tornarci.",5,2022,05,15

37,"Servicio cordial, ubicación perfecta","Estuve alojado 3 noches el pasado mes de marzo. Ya había estado allí hace unos años y el servicio sigue siendo impecable y totalmente a la altura de un verdadero 5 estrellas. Empleados súper amables y cordiales en recepción y en el restaurante.

El desayuno con vistas a las Ramblas es increíble. Espero volver pronto.",5,2022,04,17
37,Pésimo trato en la resección.,"Estábamos en la recesión esperando y vimos como a otros clientes el trato que le estaban dando era deprimente, muy poca profesionalidad y un trato vejatorio.

37,Sentirse como en casa,"Que decir de este iconico Hotel ubicado en las mismas Ramblas de Barcelona,  escapada en Familia, donde desde el primer momento y aun que las mascarillas lo tapen, se aprecia la sonrisa de tod@s quienes nos han atendido, durante el check in se nos ha preguntado si teniamos planes para nuestra visita,  enseguida nos han dado indicaciones acerca de lo que hay que ver y hacer en Familia, sugerencias de restaurantes,etc.
Hemos probado el desayuno buffet, y hemos comido en el restaurante,  mis hijos se han enamorado de las patatas trufadas.
Ubicacion inmejorable,  trato muy acogedor y familiar,
A unos escasos minutos del Mercat de La Boqueria, Museo de las Ilusiones, Barrio Gotico, Portal del Angel, Paseo de Gracia con sus Casas Modernistas.

37,Ubicación y atención,"Con mi familia nos quedamos en este hotel durante algunos días del mes de enero, la ubicación es espectacular, la mayoría de las atracciones famosas quedaba cerca y accesibles de llegar. En cuanto a la atención del personal, quiero destacar a Karina y Joan, quienes fueron super atentos y cordiales. Siempre con muy buena disposición y sus recomendaciones hicieron de nuestra estadía en Barcelona aun más entretenido. La mejor nota para ellos. Por último, mencionar que el restaurant del hotel es muy bueno, la comida tanto del desayuno como de la cena era espectacular.",4,2022,01,19
37,Muy cómodo y bien ubicado,"El hotel tiene una ubicación perfecta para quienes desean estar central y muy bien conectados. A un costado de las ramblas y a pasos de plaza cataluña, muy céntrico.
Habitaciones súper cómodas, limpias, me gustó mucho la textura de las sábanas y una sorpresa encontrar una plancha de pelo en el baño, grandioso.
Buen desayuno, variado y delicioso.

Negativo, que faltara zumo de naranjas fresco y que las habitaciones son algo pequeñas, pero nada importante.",5,2021,10,23
37,Very good restaurant,"Paella muy buena y restaurante muy tranquilo en el centro de la ciudad. 
Los camareros en general muy eficientes, Enrique y Paul fueron muy amables con nosotros!

37,Muy recomedable,"Este hotel se destaca por su limpieza, la amabilidad del personal y su inmejorable ubicación frente a La Rambla. Las habitaciones son amplias y, pese a estar inmerso en una zona tan céntrica, se puede descansar tranquilo.
El desayuno es excelente, muy abundante y variado. Estuve por reuniones de trabajo y las salas del subsuelo están muy bien, aunque por momentos se echa de menos la luz natural exterior. El lunch tipo buffet era muy bueno, tal vez faltaba un poco de variedad. El único punto mejorable sería la señal del wifi, a veces no llegaba bien a la habitación pero era muy buena en las zonas comunes.",4,2019,12,30
37,Experience excelente en Restaurante,"Fui con mi familia el pasado miércoles y nos encontramos un servicio excelente en el restaurante del Hotel Meridian, de 5 estrellas, a un precio de 16,50 por persona.

Die Zimmer waren erstaunlich ruhig, man konnte nichts von der Straße hören. Die Hotelbar war Optisch nicht ganz schön, aber die Mitarbeiter waren sehr gut drauf. Generell war das Personal des Hotels sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.

Servicio correcto y el buffet bastante completo.

La ubicacion es buena aunque bastante turistica para mi gusto. Gran variedad de restaurantes para elegir.

37,Molto comodo per la posizione.,"Hotel molto comodo per la sua ubicazione, forse un pò datato.
La camera non era all' altezza di un hotel a 5 stelle.

37,"Sehr gepflegtes, an hervorragender Lage stehendes Hotel","Das le Meridien sieht von aussen eher langweilig aus. Von innen aber ist es ein modernes, sehr gepflegtes Stadthotel.

37,Malo! Nada que ver con otros hoteles Le Meridiem,"A las habitaciones del hotel les falta una remodelación, solo el piso 1 y 2 están renovados, el mobiliario se ve desgastado, la habitación olía a cigarro, no funciona bien el internet en todas las habitaciones, se siente la vibración del metro qué pasa justo por abajo de la construcción.

37,Bien ubicado,"Elegí este hotel por ser de la cadena SPG; está muy bien ubicado en la esquina de Las Ramblas y a 3 cuadras de plaza Catalunya y a solo dos de la Boqueria.

37,Luxus am Rande der Touristenmeile.,"Das Le Meridien ist ein 5-Sterne-Haus an der La Rambla, einer sehr belebten Einkaufsstraße. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich. Wir haben ein Zimmer im 5. Stock bekommen, nach hinten raus, wo man von der Belebtheit der Gegend absolut nichts gehört hat. Top! Ansonsten war das Zimmer schön. Nicht spektakulär, aber schön. Es gibt einen Safe, einen Wasserkocher und eine Minibar. Leider hat das Hotel nur eine durchschnittliche Bar. Das ist der einzige negative Aspekt. Positiv hervorzuheben sind noch der angenehme (parfümierte) Geruch im Hotel sowie kleine Details wie Gratis-Äpfel  am Fahrstuhl, einen Regenschirm, der einem bei Bedarf beim Verlassen des Hotels angereicht wird, und die immer freundliche Begrüßung ""Welcome Back"".",4,2018,03,04
37,Soppravalutato,"In viaggio a Barcellona per lavoro, abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel una notte.
Il punto di forza è sicuramente la posizione, a due passi dalle ramblas, quindi ottimo come punto di partenza per visitare Bcn.
Hotel sicuramente non per tutte le tasche visto che vanta 5 stelle. 
Hall curata, e personale attento alle esigenze del cliente.
Le stanze, qui prima note dolente, carine  e comode ma troppo piccole per trovarci in un hotel di prima fascia. 
Buona e varia la colazione che viene effettuata al piano terra in un ottimo ambiente che affaccia direttamente sulla ramblas.
Insomma ci siamo trovati bene, ma in un hotel così ci si aspetta ben altro.
Non so se lo consiglierei.",3,2018,03,01
37,Bodas de plata decepcionantes,"Reservamos una habitación en el hotel Le meridien para pasar una noche ya que hacía 25 años celebramos el banquete de nuestra boda en este hotel, cuando hablé con recepción para hacer la reserva hice incapie en que nos hacía mucha ilusión poder volver al hotel donde tantos recuerdos teníamos de nuestra boda que he de decir que fue una maravilla, pero la gran decepción es que no han tenido ni un simple detalle empezando por la habitación que nos han dado que daba a un patio interior y para nuestro gusto nada acorde con el precio. Además cuando hice la reserva me comentaron que tendrían algún detalle con nosotros el cual no se produjo en ningún momento, me parece muy triste que un hotel de 5 estrellas como es Le meridien no  contemple ese tipo de detalles, creo que una simple botella de cava, una cesta de frutas nos hubiera hecho llevarnos un recuerdo entrañable de nuestras bodas de plata.

37,GRACIAS !!!!!!!,"No sé sinceramente si esta opinión será publicada. Si bien hace un año estuve en Barcelona, no me alojé en Le Meridien.  QUIERO AGRADECER EN NOMBRE DE MI PAIS, ARGENTINA, Y DE NO SE CUANTOS PAISES MÁS, LA SOLIDARIDAD QUE DEMOSTRARON AYER 17/8/17 luego del atentado CON TODOS LOS QUE BUSCARON REFUGIO EN ESTE HOTEL. Según relató un compatriota mío que salvó su vida y la de su esposa milagrosamente y por centímetros de ser atropellados por ese terrorista que se llevó la vida de tantas personas y dejó tantos heridos, varios de ellos de gravedad, esta pareja y muchísimas personas ingresaron desesperadamente a Le Meridien y allí fueron acogidos, protegidos, atendidos los que estaban heridos. Fueron alimentados, les dieron bebidas y la opción de quedarse a pasar la noche los que no pudiesen regresar a sus hoteles o viviendas. Los instalaron en un Salón de Eventos.  Todo sin cobrarles un centavo. PURA SOLIDARIDAD. OJALA ESTO SE PUBLIQUE YA QUE DICE MUCHO DE ESTE HOTEL, DE BARCELONA Y DE SU PUEBLO. MIL VECES GRACIAS!!!!",5,2017,08,18
37,Estancia muy agradable en Le Meridien Barcelona,"Es la segunda vez que me quedo en Le Meridien Barcelona y en esta ocasión si que han estado a la altura con un servicio de 10 en todos los sentidos. El trato del servicio de bar, el pop bar, recepción, los guardias de seguridad se merecen mi agradecimiento y la habitación es un verdadero lujo en el mismisimo centro de Barcelona",5,2017,08,17
37,Ottima location,"Se dovete concedervi un lungo wend a Barcellona, questo hotel può essere davvero comodo. Scendi e sei praticamente nel cuore della città, sebbene l'accesso sua in una delle stradine che si immettono sulla rambla. Devo dire che la colazione potrebbe essere più curata... per il resto è ok",4,2017,08,12
37,¡ Horrible!,"Muy decepcionados nuestra estancia al meridien hotel.

El personal no sabe dar la bienvenida correctamente a su clientes! Nuestra llegada fue deplorable y particularmente en recepción con Tashia que fue muy desagradable y no muy servicial. Inadmisible para un hotel 5 estrellas. 

El hotel merece una renovación. Las habitaciones son anticuadas y muy sucios (cabellos y pelos en la bañera, juntos muy usado y bañera que se escama). Me ducharse con mi chanclas en la bañera!!!!Limpieza fatal! 
La noche cuesta 300€ y no vale el precio.
Este hotel no merece 5 estrellas un control sería necesario para reevaluar las prestaciones del hotel. Estoy muy decepcionada con esta estancia al meridian hotel. No recomiendo en ningún caso este hotel. 
No es así que debe tratar sus clientes!
",1,2017,07,30
37,pensavo meglio,"di solito la catena meridien mi soddisfa sempre al top, questo hotel e' buono ma sinceramente pensavo meglio visto il prezzo, entrata in una via laterale della ramblas, personale gentile ma non piu' di tanto, camere non molto grandi e solo poche con vista ramblas. non tornero' ",4,2017,07,29
37,"Wow, einfach wow!","Ich komme wieder!!!! Alles rundum perfekt!!!!
Danke für das super aufmerksamer Personal! Von Rezeption bis Putzfrau - super!!!! Tolle Küche!!!
Tolle Zimmer. Alles sehr sauber!

Freu mich schon auf den nächsten Urlaub! ",5,2017,07,27
37,Nos encantó. Gran servicio en una gran localización. ,Solo estuvimos una noche previa a un crucero pero la experiencia fue excelente. El personal muy atento y simpático. Nos tocaron cuartos renovados del primer piso y están muy modernos y bonitos. El baño es muy cómodo y funcional. Las camas muy cómodas y no se oye ningún ruido exterior. Me dieron mis privilegios de Gold member y tuve internet gratis para tres aparatos. La entrada y salida rápidas y eficientes. ,5,2017,07,25
37,Cómodo y cercano a distintos centros de interés.,"El hotel me pareció sumamente cómodo, habitaciones cómodas y amplias, el servicio y la atención al huésped excelente, todos siempre con una sonrisa y dispuestos a atenderte.

El desayuno incluido es bueno, aunque me hubiera gustado un poco de más variedad.

Está muy bien ubicado, con muchos restaurantes cercanos y puntos turísticos de interés.",5,2017,06,25
37,Excelente ,La mejor opción en el área de la Rambla. El servicio es de primera y esmerado. El restaurante del hotel muy bueno y a excelentes precios. La experiencia en el Meridien fue excelente. Altamente recomendado.,5,2017,06,16
37,El lujo en La Rambla de Barcelona,"Una de las mejores sensaciones es contemplar el tiempo pasar, y las cristaleras de Le Meridian que dan a la calle Pintor Fortuny de Barcelona sin duda son uno de los mejores espacios de la Ciudad para ello. Porque los hoteles de 5* GL te dan esa seguridad de que nunca ha de sucederte nada, pero además en Le Meridien hay una cercanía a Barcelona en la que esa distancia muchas veces implícita en la seguridad no existe. Durante mucho tiempo Le Meridien fue el hotel de Madonna en la Ciudad, pero hoy ya ha llegado a su mayoría de edad y es mucho más, es el el hotel de aquellos a los que nos gusta disfrutar del lujo en el centro de Barcelona; La Rambla. Ya sea para tomar un cóctel en su ""Pop Cocktail Bar"",  muy recomendables los domingos con Champagne o los sábados sparkling. Para tomar un café Le Meridien es toda una experiencia, exquisito gracias a su programa ""Inspiration Brewed Here"" por el que se han asociado con los expertos Esther Maasdam y Franz Zaunner, un café para tomar con los magníficos éclairs en el ""Longitude Bar 2º 10' "". Para comer o cenar en el ""Restaurant Centonze"" es espectacular entrar o salir por la puerta magnifica que da a La Rambla, cuando está abierta, es de aquellos lujos que solo provienen de las experiencias, de los que no se pueden comprar con dinero. De las habitaciones os invito a ver la web solo para descubrir las ilustraciones de Judit Maldonado, una autentica belleza. Por cierto para su música Le Meridien ha firmado con el grupo New Wave un acuerdo para que este desarrolle todo su concept musical, y es que viajar a este hotel es como hacerlo en los años 50, como si lo hicieramos en la pelicula el Talento de Mr Ripley.",5,2017,05,27
37,Magnífica comida y servicio.,"Hemos visitado su restaurante Centonze para una celebración familiar y no nos ha defraudado lo más mínimo. Un producto de calidad, bien cocinado y con un servicio impecable. Su cercanía al mítico Mercat de la Boquería facilita tener un producto fresco a diario. Y un precio más que ajustado!!.
Sin duda, repetiremos.",5,2017,05,20
37,"Personale professionale, location ottima, hotel ottimo","L'hotel è il classico hotel per turista, ma io ci vado anche quando ci devo andare per lavoro. Servizio ottimo, stanze funzionali, personale fantástico. Ideale per coppie e per famiglie, punto di partenza per fare turismo. Io ci ritorno di sicuro.",4,2017,05,12
37,Non lo consiglio,"Sarò stato sfortunato ma la mia esperienza in quest'hotel ha avuto degli inconvenienti molto fastidiosi.
Posizione ottima, proprio nel cuore della movida cittadina, con logicamente la controindicazione che si è nel mezzo del caos a tutte le ore.
Tutto questo però è stato amplificato dalla finestra che non si chiudeva (veramente ridicolo per un hotel del genere) che oltre a farci sentire la notte tutti i rumori della rambla faceva anche entrare uno spiffero di aria non da poco con la conseguenza che chi dormiva vicino alla finestra si moriva dal freddo.
Lo scarico del bagno era a dir poco vergognoso (si riempiva dopo circa 20 minuti) oltre ad uscire poca acqua e la doccia che aveva una pressione ridicola; in quattro giorni non sono riuscito a farmi una doccia come si deve perchè non si regolava nemmeno bene (o troppo caldo o troppo freddo).
E per finire il quarto giorno, al contrario degli altri giorni che ci ritiravamo in hotel sempre dopo la sei di sera, siamo rientrati alle 16:00 ed a quell'ora ancora non avevano rifatto la stanza!!
Per me non è per niente un cinque stelle!!",2,2017,04,30
37,Comodo y limpio,"Estuvimos aquí con mi pareja un fin de semana y fue una experiencia genial, un trato muy bueno de principio a fin. Las habitaciones no pueden ser mejores y en el centro d la Ciudad!

Elegancia, comodidad y trato a niveles superiores!",5,2017,03,10
37,Sehr zentrales und angenehmes Hotel,"Bei einem Besuch im wunderschönen Barcelona (und das bei frühlingshaftem Wetter) haben wir ein  paar Tage in diesem sehr zentralen Hotel direkt an der Las Ramblas gewohnt. Gebucht über eine Buchungsplattform (da auf der Hotel-Homepage „kein Zimmer frei“?), freundlicher Empfang an der Rezeption und erfreulicher Weise bei Ankunft um etwa 13.00 Uhr das Zimmer bereits zu beziehen.
Das Deluxe-Zimmer war nicht allzu groß, aber gut ausgestattet (Klimaanlage, Safe, Minibar, Kaffee- und Teekocher samt Zubehör, Bügeleisen und Hosenbügler, Fernseher, Telefon, WLAN kostenlos, usw.). Das Kingsize-Bett (zur Auswahl wären auch zwei Einzelbetten gestanden) war bequem und so groß, dass auch die große gemeinsame Decke nicht gestört hat. Nachtkästchen ohne Laden, aber eine Lade bei der Schreibfläche (mit Schreibtischlampe). Ein Sessel, ein Fauteuil und ein kleiner Glastisch; Kasten im Vorraum mit für einen kurzen Aufenthalt gerade genug Platz zum Hängen und Legen. Sehr aufmerksam war, dass täglich zwei kleine Flaschen Mineralwasser kostenlos im Zimmer standen.
Der Sanitärbereich war groß, mit Wanne und Dusche (Überkopf- und Handbrause) darin, Föhn, Bademäntel und -schuhe, genügend Bade- und Handtücher, viele kleine Toiletteartikel (die täglich – wenn verbraucht – wieder bereitgestellt wurden); WC im selben Raum (leider der Papierhalter so montiert, dass nur mit „Verrenkungen“ zu erreichen). Angenehm war, dass sich beim Eintritt in den Sanitärbereich in der Nacht automatisch ein gedämpftes Nachtlicht eingeschaltet hat.
Zimmer und Sanitärbereich waren sehr sauber, das Zimmerservice in Ordnung.
Einen Nachteil hatte unser Zimmer leider: es war unmittelbar neben den Aufzügen situiert und (zunächst haben wir das nicht so bemerkt, denn sonst hätten wir um einen Zimmertausch ersucht) diese waren nachts relativ laut im Zimmer zu hören und damit störend ...
Das Frühstücksbuffet war überaus reichlich, auf Wunsch wurden auch Eiergerichte frisch zubereitet. Das Service (die Getränke wie Kaffee, Tee usw. wurden serviert) war rasch und freundlich. 
Einmal haben wir im Restaurant CentOnze des Hotels (in dem auch das Frühstück bereitgestellt wurde) zu Abend gegessen. Die Atmosphäre des Raum war nett (wenn auch teilweise die Tische recht eng gestellt), der Tisch schön eingedeckt, es gab eine große Auswahl an Speisen und Getränken, auch ein Menü (jeweils mehrere Vor-, Haupt- und Nachspeisen zur Auswahl, bei manchen Speisen ein geringer „Aufschlag“ auf den Menüpreis) wurde angeboten. Alles was wir ausgewählt haben wurde hübsch angerichtet serviert, die Portionen waren reichlich und es hat uns sehr gut geschmeckt, auch die Getränke.
Insgesamt war der Aufenthalt im Le Meridien angenehm und zufriedenstellend – das Hotel war ein guter Stützpunkt zum Erforschen von Barcelona und der vielen herrlichen Sehenswürdigkeiten in der Stadt selbst (von denen einige UNESCO-Weltkulturerbe sind) und der Umgebung (z.B. ist ein Ausflug nach Montserrat absolut empfehlenswert!)",4,2017,02,11
37,Comida con amigas,"El local es muy bonito, con vistas a las Ramblas, la comida muy buena y bien presentada. Nos encantó el sitio, muy céntrico y nos trataron muy profesionalmente. Volveremos seguro. Lo mejor es ir con reserva .",5,2017,01,31
37,HOTEL DECENTE NORMAL,"Está ubicado en plena zona turística en la Rambla a 2 o 3 cuadras de Plaza de Cataluña con sus ventajas y desventajas de tumultos y demás. Es parte de Starwood pero el servicio y atención a sus clientes No es lo que Yo busco en un Hotel de 4 o 5 Estrellas Reales.
Falta entrenamiento y mayor amabilidad del personal en sus  centros de consumo. Bares y Restaurantes.
No está mal es un buen hotel de lo más normal en cuanto a instalaciones que considero ya necesita renovar.
Si la tarifa esta atractiva está bien, de lo contrario en Barcelona encuentras mejores hoteles incluyendo de la cadena Starwood, Marriott y muchos más. Nada que sobresalga. 
",3,2017,01,26
37,5 que parece 4,"En líneas generales es un hotel muy bueno. Pero que no deslumbra por ningún lado. Para 5 estrellas le falta. Creo que 4 está bien. Tiene algunos detalles que denotan delicadeza, pero me hace acordar a los colonizadores de América que intercambiaban espejos y baratijas por oro. ",3,2017,01,08
37,Wo sind die fünf Sterne?,"Wir waren über Weihnachten in diesem Hotel und hatten ein Zimmer zur Seite las Ramblas. Das Zimmer war zwar grundsätzlich o. k. aber wir hatten null Nachtruhe. Die Untergrundbahn hörte man alle circa 30 Minuten. Dann die Betrunkenen, die vom Ausgang nach Hause kamen. Nach der ersten Nacht wechselten wir das Zimmer: die Rezeption sagte, sie hätten uns ein Zimmer in den Innenhof, das wäre aber ein downgrading und wir müssten das unterschreiben, da wir kein Geld zurück bekommen. 5 Sterne Haus!
Ich habe dann nach einem upgrading gefragt. Nach circa 7 Minuten Suchen hat er auch ein Zimmer gefunden. Es war eine Suite. Das Zimmer war sehr gross , hatte ein grosses Badezimmer mit einer separaten Dusche und eine super grossen Terrasse, wo man halb  Barcelona sehen konnte. 
Dort einmal angekommen haben wir bemerkt, dass das Zimmer schon sehr lange nicht mehr benutzt wurde. Staub lag an allen Ecken und Enden. Wir haben den Raum Service aufgeboten, um das Zimmer zu reinigen. Leider klappte es das erste mal gar nicht. Wir haben den Raumservice ein zweites Mal aufgeboten, mit der Bitte einen Staubsauger mitzunehmen und das Zimmer gründlich zu reinigen. Das hat dann auch einigermassen geklappt. 
Für einen Preis von 570 Fr. pro Zimmer und Nacht erwarten wir etwas anderes!
Positiv zu erwähnen ist, der eine Mann an der Rezeption hat  sich wirklich sehr sehr viel Mühe gegeben und uns ganz viele gute Tipps gegeben. Herzlichen Dank dafür. 
Das nächste Mal in Barcelona werden wir sicher ein anderes Hotel buchen.

37,cocteleria,"Excelente trato  de  todo el personal, ambiente muy agradable, pero la pieza estrella son los  cócteles fantástico que hay. También, la calidad y precio esta muy bien comparado a otros lugares.
Sin duda es uno de los mejores lugares  que he visitado.
RECOMENDADO!!
Volveré de nuevo, muy pronto. ",5,2016,11,28
37,Excelente hotel!!!,"El año pasado estuve en este hotel y me pareció muy bueno en todos los aspectos, en la recepción muy agradables, el desayuno bastante completo... y es así que justamente hoy está llegando mi sobrina a hospedarse en este hotel espero que la atención sea la misma o mejor.",4,2016,11,02
37,5 stelle con riserva,"Sono stata in questo hotel per un viaggio premio,una notte e due giorni.
Ingresso e corridoi un po' anonimi,in compenso la camera assegnatami era veramente bella:arredamento super moderno,un letto matrimoniale super comodo e con una trapunta bianca splendente.Bagno con lavabo,water e doccia enorme che ci si stava in tre a salvarsi.
Ho provato i tre pasti : Colazione ottima continentale,Bacon e uova strapazzate fatte al momento,very good; pranzo discreto anche se il servizio è stato lento tipo da pranzo nuzziale; cena buona con un' ottima Paella di Marisco e sangria Red. Personale super disponibile!
Spa pulita ma piccolina,veramente rilassante il massaggio che mi hanno regalato,la parte più bella del mio soggiorno in questo Hotel!",3,2016,10,07
37,Excelente,"Excelente hotel a metros de la rambla.
Cerca de todo.
Amplia oferta cultural y gastronómica en los alrededores.
Personal muy profesional y amable. Con seguridad volveremos a hospedarnos.
Hotel con un servicio correcto a la altura de su precio.
Sumamente recomendable.
",5,2016,09,25
37,Molto bello,"Ubicato nelle centralissime ramblas vicino a plaza de catalunya, l'hotel rispecchia gli standard elevati della catena senza però primeggiare rispetto ad altri. Stanze non troppo spaziose per la categoria richiesta e per il prezzo. Giudizio comunque più che positivo ",4,2016,09,14
37,Trato exclusivo. Super detallistas,"Excelente grupo de trabajadores tienen, siempre cuidando al cliente hasta el ultimo detalle. El mejor hasta ahora de todos los que he estado en España.
Un fallo: Cobrarte 50.-€ por noche al hacer el check-in, después me cobraron otros 180.-€ porque había superado los 150.-€ que ya tenían míos. Esto esta muy feo para un cliente. Creo que los clientes que van a este tipo de hoteles no van a irse sin pagar.
La próxima vez no les dejo mi tarjeta VISA. Ahora me deben dinero (2 días después), porque me cobraron de mas y no me lo han devuelto, hicimos el check-out el miércoles a las 10:00 horas y es viernes. Fueron muy rápidos para cobrar, pero quizás tenga que llamarles y reclamar para que devuelvan lo cobrado de mas que son 99,98.-€.
Mjuy buen desayuno y excelente trato, desde antes de entrar, en mostrador, en restaurante, en buffet desayuno, etc.",5,2016,09,02
37,Exclusivo - lo recomiendo ,"Fui en vías de negocios con unos árabes y el servicio es exclusivo. Los botones llegan inmediatamente que se aparca un coche y de igual forma acompañan al huésped cuando se va hasta el coche. 

El ambiente y trato es muy adecuado para negocios y para visitas familiares o de trabajo. Personal muy eficiente. 

Lo recomiendo. ",5,2016,08,30
37,Troppe cinque stelle,"Da un punto di vista logistico la struttura è certamente consigliabile. A poche decine di metri dalla metro ed alcune centinaia dal terminal autobus per areoporto.
Nel merito, occorre precisare che avevamo prepagato il soggiorno, tuttavia al nostro arrivo é stato preteso un deposito cauzionale garantito da carta di credito per €. 300,00 .
La stanza assegnata si trovava al quinto piano con affaccio interno, sebbene vigente il divieto di fumo la stessa era impregnata di odore di tabacco. Fatta notare la cosa all'addetto al trasporto bagagli, nel volgere di pochi minuti la stanza é stata sostituita. 

Camera spaziosa con bagno ampio, nota distonica la pulizia superficiale che veniva effettuata giornalmente. Se ben ricordo lo standard 5 stelle prevede anche il passaggio serale per la preparazione alla notte, cosa mai avvenuta. 

Abbastanza sgradevole è la consuetudine ( verificata nel corso del soggiorno) dell'addetto alle pulizie di lasciare il carrello nel corridoio di accesso alle stanze .-

La struttura risente della vetustà del fabbricato .-",3,2016,08,23
37,Hotel Le Meridien Barcelona ,"El Hotel Le Meridien está ubicado en Las Ramblas y a unas pocas cuadras de la Plaza Cataluña, con una ubicación inmejorable , cerca de donde se puede tomar el bus turístico y visitar muchos lugares hermosos de Barcelona .

El hotel tiene la mejor ubicacion, super atentos, todo excelente.",5,2016,07,09
37,Inmejorable,"Solo puedo decir que el entorno, la atención y el alojamiento es inmejorable. Solo es superable por sus fresas con chocolate.
Habitaciones muy mimadas en cuanto a tecnología y decoración, al igual que el trato excelente del personal hacen que sea un hotel de referencia",5,2016,07,02
37,Barcelona encanta...,"Nos quedamos unos días en Barcelona en Nov 2015 y resultó ser una ciudad muy agradable...La Rambla, ni hablar de Gaudi...majestuoso, los parques, y su centro de todo gusto. Prepararse cada día con bastante agua en verano y unos zapatos cómodos y a conocer esta ciudad que te sorprende con su arquitectura, sus barrios y su gente amable. Hay que camminarla...",5,2016,06,22
37,Un lugar fabuloso,"Es un hotel caro pero el servicio es acorde al precio. 
Las habitaciones son muy confortables, muy buen amuebladas y con unas extraordinarias calidades. 
La única pega que le pongo es la bañera. Es demasiado alta y poco adecuada para personas con movilidad reducida. 
El desayuno es fantástico y la atención por parte del personal es excelente. ",5,2016,06,12
37,Gutes Hotel in toller Lage,"An den Ramblas gelegen und damit sehr zentral. Vor ca 6-8 Jahren komplett renoviert mit sehr schönen modernen Zimmern.

Opte por este,pero no lo recomiendo para nada.",3,2016,05,25
37,El hotel perfecto,"La localización del hotel es la mejor, Pintor Fortuny con Las Ramblas.  El servicio es excelente, diligente y con idiomas. La comida está muy bien, por las noches en el bar se puede tomar un coctel bien rico viendo Las Ramblas a través de la cristalera.",5,2016,04,12
37,Buena ubicación. ,Tardaron en darnos la habitación y traernos la cama adicional. El primer día el personal del comedor era desagradable y se notaba mucha des prolijidad .

37,...un breve soggiorno...,"Albergo di classe situato in posizione superstrategica per girare Barcellona; si ha veramente tutto a breve portata e a piedi comodamente si passa dal Barrio Gotico alla Città Vecchia per visite culturali e da Playa Catalunya al Passeig de Gracia per lo shopping più sfrenato fino ad arrivare a Barceloneta per vedere un po' di mare...
I servizi sono sempre impeccabili ,il personale disponibile e pronto a risolvere i piccoli problemi che possono capitare durante un soggiorno in una città che magari si conosce poco;le camere ,per quanto provato,sono spaziose, pulite e con un servizio gratuito di caffè e thè sempre gradito...
Una nota di merito va fatta al ristorante dell'albergo CentOnze ,affacciato sproprio sulla rambla,che propone un ottimo menù con un accurato servizio a prezzi più che accettabili rispetto ad altri locali prettamente turistici nelle vicinanze... insomma lo stampo degli Starwood Hotels si sente e fa sentire bene l'ospite...",5,2016,04,03
37,Excelente situación,"Hotel muy céntrico, en las mismas Ramblas, cerca de Plaza Catalunya, la Boqueria, el Liceu, el Barrio Gótico, ... Habitaciones confortables, de rehabilitación recinte, con todas las comodidades. La zona de desayuno es muy agradable, con vistes a la Rambla.",4,2016,03,09

Be che dire,hotel molto bello e ben curato con un personale sempre sorridente e disponibile....camera doppia molto comoda e funzionale,luminosa e con letto comodissimo,in più con un bagno molto grande che dispone di un box doccia spettacolare,unica pecca,il lavandino presentava qualche crepa dovuta alla vernice che si è levata....
Cmq è un hotel che merita sia per la sua bellezza,sia per la sua posizione strategica sulla rambla(tra la metro Plaza catalunya e liceu) e sopratutto per il personale che è veramente fantastico",4,2016,03,03

37,GARANTÍA STARWOOD,Si lo tuyo es la acción es tu sitio a unos metros de la Rambla. En los mares de gentes y la plaza de Cataluña a 3 cuadras. Está en una calle contra esquina a la Rambla. El lobby cuenta con su bar y café de tamaño pequeño pero suficiente. Buen restaurante con ventanales y vista a la Rambla. La calidad y garantía Starwood que para mí es lo más i portante como SPG Platinum. Buena alternativa. Cuenta con personal de seguridad y te sientes tranquilo dentro de la propiedad. Recordar que es una zona con mucho turista vía y noche recorriendo el vecindario.,5,2016,01,02

37,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel direkt an der Ramblas,"Das Meridien ist sehr zentral gelegen, direkt an der Touristenmeile. Für den Geschäftsreisenden wie auch den Touristen die perfekte Ausgangsbasis, um die Stadt zu erkunden. 

Ich hatte ein sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtetes großes Zimmer mit modernem Bad. Alle Annehmlichkeiten sind vorhanden. Lediglich die Aussicht war mit einigen renovierungsbedürftigen Fassaden in der Nachbarschaft eingeschränkt.

Das Hotel bietet auch ein Spa (habe ich nicht besucht) wie auch ein Business Center im Untergeschoß.",5,2015,12,01
37,dormi comodo e riparti con gusto,"Hotel in posizione strategica: sulla ramblas! il personale è stato molto cordiale, e la mia stanza era ampia, pulita e molto silenziosa. il panorama dalla finestra non era propriamente incantevole: il retro dei palazzi della zona; ...un modo per avere un'altro punto di vista della zona!
La colazione l'ho trovata super: molta scelta e cibo di qualità (spremuta di arance squisita!); il personale di sala molto gentile e professionale.
Mi sento di consigliare questa struttura.",5,2015,11,27
37,"Fantastische Lage, etwas verbesserungswürdiger Service","Beste Lage in Barcelona, sowohl zum Strand als auch zur Altstadt und allen Shopping-Möglichkeiten. Zimmer im Hotel sind schön, schlicht; insbesondere die Bäder - man merkt allerdings, dass das Hotel schon etwas älter ist.

Der Spa-Bereich ist sehr klein (Sauna, Dampfbad, Whirlpool), allerdings wird einem hier auch nichts anderes suggeriert, insofern ok. Dafür sind die Massagen laut Aussage meiner Frau sehr gut. 

Kleine Randbemerkung: Beim Check-in wurde nicht registriert, dass ich einen Platinum Status habe und somit war weder unser Zimmer fertig (wobei wir vorher explizit nach Anreisezeit gefragt wurden), noch das Upgrade verfügbar - und es wurde uns beim Frühstück eine Rechnung vorgelegt. In Summe aber nicht wirklich schlimm",4,2015,11,16
37,apprezzato ristorante,"non ho alloggiato in questo hotel ma ho utilizzato il ristorante. Devo dire che ho apprezzato con molto piacere i piatti proposti nel menu' del giorno. Tutti cucinati molto bene e soprattutto presentati altrettanto bene, il prezzo molto contenuto  Ristorante molto pulito e con personale disponibilissim0, anche se di italiano capivano poco.  Ottima posizione sulla Ramblas.",4,2015,11,01
37,Unica nota positiva: la posizione,"Sono stata in questo hotel 3 giorni a fine ottobre e devo dire che sono rimasta molto delusa. Avevamo la camera deluxe ma che sembrava peggio di una standard, tanto che ho chiesto alla reception se mi avevano dato la giusta sistemazione. Ottima posizione per il resto lascia desiderare. Stato della camera non all'altezza delle stelle e del prezzo richiesto. In camera neanche pantofole in dotazione e una misera bottiglietta d'acqua come omaggio. Colazione normale, hotel frequentato da anziani. Non lo consiglio.",3,2015,10,30

37,Calidad y atención de primer nivel!,"Llegamos al hotel, luego de un largo viaje desde Buenos Aires. Nos recibieron muy calidamente y nuestra habitación ya estaba disponible. Si bien, no era la mejor, nos ofrecieron cambiar por una más cómoda al día siguiente, a lo que accedimos con gusto. 
El personal es muy amable y siempre dispuesto a escuchar y solucionar cualquier consulta. 
La ubicación es muy apropiada, ya que está a unos pasos de La Rambla, en el punto justo para el mar o bien para el centro.",5,2015,09,01
37,Elegante,"Elegante, carismático y bello. Perfecto para una ocasión especial. Realmente vale cada euro invertido, un viaje para los sentidos. 
Las habitaciones son grandes y limpias. Tienen una iluminacióm especial que hacen de tu estadía un momento mágico.",5,2015,08,27
37,Così così ,"Carino ma mancano i servizi

Consigliato: nì",3,2015,08,23
37,"Lage 1a, aber keine 5 Sterne","Basierend auf der Einstufung als 5 Sterne Hotel, bewerte ich das Le Meridien als 'durchschnittlich'. Was aber nicht bedeutet, dass es schlechter als ein mit 'sehr gut' bewertetes 4 Sterne Haus ist. 

Es gibt große Unterschiede bei der Qualität der Zimmer. Leider gibt es im Le Meridien viele Zimmer mit alten und durchgelegenen Matratzen. Sie sind dermaßen alt, dass man in der Mitte versinkt und man sich nur schwer umdrehen kann. Dies kann schmerzlich enden - Details erspare ich mir. Aufgrund dessen musste ich mein Zimmer nach der ersten Nacht wechseln. Man hat mir einige andere Zimmer gezeigt (alle Etage 1). Nur eins hiervon hatte eine neuere und damit härtere Matratze. Allerdings war das Zimmer sehr klein und wenig schön. Obendrein handelte es sich um ein Klappbett, dass man im Schrank einklappen konnte. Unglaublich, aber war. Nicht vergessen, dass das Le Meridien ein 5 Sterne Hotel ist. Außerdem hat das Zimmer muffig gestunken.
Da das Hotel ausgebucht war, musste ich das Stinkezimmer für eine Nacht in Kauf nehmen. Dafür war die Schlafqualität besser. 
Das Zimmer am nächsten Tag war wieder auf Niveau der ersten Zimmers - normaler 4 Sterne Standard. Keine 5 Sterne.
Ansonsten liegt das Hotel sehr zentral.",3,2015,07,12
37,Excelente ubicacion para un hotel unico,"El hotel posee un servicio de primera, su personal es super atento y sus habitaciones de muy buen tamano para lo que es Europa.
Su bar-restaurant es unico e imperdible!!Aunque no estes alojado alli te lo super recomiendo.. sus platillos y tragos son impresionantes y el entorno majestuoso.
Su ubicacion , en el mejor y mas pintoresco Barcelona, las Ramblas no hacen mas que suma estrellas a esta experiencia unica",5,2015,07,01

37,Centrale,Posizione centralissima nel mezzo delle Ramblas a pochi passi dal km zero di Plaza Catalogna . Colazione ottima. Personale gentile. Questa volta ho abitato nella junior suite 717. Probabilmente l 'architetto che l'ha disegnata ha sbagliato mestiere puntando  tutto sullo stile e pochissimo sulla praticita'. Velocità' connessione Wi-Fi appena accettabile. Un buon hotel.,4,2015,06,11

37,Buena Ubicación,"El hotel tiene muy buena ubicación, Si bien la habitación no era de lo mejor, la ventana daba a un techo metalico. La cama no era la mejor. pero la verdad por el poco tiempo que uno esta en la habitación esta bien.
Debo admitir que esta en la mejor locación de BCN, cerca de todo, caminando a pocos metros de la Boqueria.
Llegamos en el dia de Saint Jordi. Estaba todo cortado. Las habitaciónes a las 15:00hs no estaban lista. Nos hicieron esperar poco por suerte.",3,2015,05,09
37,Das beste SPG Hotel im Herzen von Barcelona,"Als SPG Member hat man die Auswahl zwischen dem Le Meridien, dem W Hotel und dem Four Points by Sheraton. Wer mitten im Herzen der Stadt sein möchte, und Wert auf einen ausgezeichneten professionellen Service legt ist hier genau richtig. Übrigens gehört das Haus wie auch das Le Meridian RA und dem Four Points by Sheraton dem gleichen Eigentümer (W Barcelonas gehört zu einem anderen Franchisenehmer). 
Obwohl mit SPG Punkten gebucht, hatte man meinen Status immer vor Augen. Und ich habe mich als sehr wertgeschätzter Gast an beiden unterschiedlichen Aufenthalten innerhalb der gleiche Woche gefühlt. Besonders positiv erwähnenswert, sind die Mitarbeiter vom Concierge Desk, welche manche Kollegen von St. Regis in den Schatten stellen. Jeder Winkel in der Stadt ist bekannt, viele Insider Tipps sind erhältlich.
Auch die Bar war ein positives Erlebnis, was auch an den sehr netten Mitarbeiter gelegen hat. Ein Small Talk war immer möglich......und der Sangria war sehr köstlich!
Übrigens sollte man die hausgemachten Eclair`s probieren.....Schokolade war mein persönlicher Favorit, und diese lassen sich am besten in der stylischen Lobbybar genießen.
Wenn auch die Zimmer sehr stylisch sind, haben so manche Gäste bereits spuren hinterlassen. Ob 518 oder 431....Gebrauchsspuren sind deutlich ersichtlich!
Im Grunde gibt es für mich bis auf das Frühstück, keine Verbesserungsmöglichkeit. Da es kein Einzelerlebnis, sondern mit unterschiedlichen Mitarbeiter an den Tagen des Aufenthalts war, wäre dringender Handlungsbedarf im Ablauf nötig. Obwohl sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, fehlt etwas Struktur im Ablauf. Es werden Tische aufgefüllt und gereinigt, allerdings wird die Aufmerksamkeit nicht auf den Gast und das Frühstückserlebnis gelegt. Das abräumen von benutztem Geschirr am Tisch des Gast, erfolgt sehr zögerlich und meist eher zu spät, als verspätet. Was jedoch gänzlich fehlte, war die Frage nach frischem Kaffee oder Tee. An keinem Tisch erfolgte diese Frage für die Gäste.....Aufgrund des übersichtlichen Restaurants nicht nachvollziehbar. Schade.....der Gast würde dieses Erlebnis als Erinnerung behalten (bei weniger Personaleinsatz ist das Team vom Le Meridien Frankfurt viel effektiver). Aber hierfür gibt's ein Management, welche die Problematik falls gewünscht ändern kann (ich werde es beim nächsten Aufenthalt erleben).
Trotzdem gibt es 100 von 100 Punkten, da ich die Probleme durch direkte Ansprache gelöst habe. Für mein Ziel zum Glück, bin ich leider Hartnäckig, und somit läuft mancher etwas länger bis der Wunsch erfüllt ist .-)",5,2015,04,29
37,Top,"Die Lage ist absolut perfekt. Alles kann schnell zu Fuß oder mit der Metro (Station fast vor  der Tür) in kurzer Zeit erreicht werden. Von der immer lebhaften Rambla ist im Hotel absolut nichts wahrzunehmen. Freundliches, aufmerksames Personal. Abwechslungsreiches Frühstücksbüffet. Moderne Zimmer mit Flat-TV und stylischen Badezimmern. Wenn mal wieder Barcelona, dann im Le Meridien !",5,2015,04,07
37,Flüchtlingslager,"Das Hotel ist absolut perfekt gelegen. Top Restaurants sind in der Nähe.  Aber deshalb ist das Fourier steht gerammelt voll mit Gästen und Touristen. 
Für Geschäftsreisende wirklich ungeeignet außer man liebt Warten und Touristenmassen.
Vorsicht mit Taxibestellung ... Vor der Türe gibt es ständig Taxis aber wenn man bei der Rezeption nach einem Taxi bittet, bestellen die ein Taxi bei einem ""befreundeten"" Unternehmen und damit dauert es 1. sehr lange bis es kommt und 2. es kostet durch die Abfahrt deutlich mehr. 
Das Personal ist extrem aufmerksam und korrekt ... deutlich zu korrekt für Kinder bzw. viele Kinder. ",2,2015,04,05

El personal muy amable y profesional, muchas gracias especialmente a Louiza que es un encanto de persona y muy buena profesional,  nos explico el hotel  con mucha ilusión, nos recomendó unos eclaires buenísimos que hacen en el bar y  una pastelería excelente que esta muy cerca del hotel y se llama “choc”.

37,"Bel albergo e personale gentile , ma con vicini rumorosi","L'albergo è bello , curato nell'arredo e con molte attenzioni verso i clienti , e con personale preparato e gentile .
Purtroppo per due notti abbiamo avuto problemi di rumori con gli utenti della camera accanto , una notte alle 3 ca, e la seguente alla 5, gente maleducata e litigiosa , ma anche pareti con isolamento acustico carente , litigavano a voce alta , e sembravano in camera ns. !! ,
 così siamo stati costretti a chiamare in entrambe le notti la reception dell'albergo , e loro la vigilanza/sicurezza, che è intervenuta ,  per riuscire a riprendere il sonno interrotto .

37,Einfach nur wunderschön!,"Nachdem wir aus dem 5Sterne Hotel Bagues (ca. 500m entfernt) geflohen sind, wurden wir in dem Meridien-Hotel super freundlich empfangen. Ein tolles Zimmer mit warmen Farben und eine tolle Dachterrasse erwartete uns. Trotz der Größe des Hotels war die persönliche Ansprache und der Service wirklich 5Sterne wert! Sauberkeit, moderne Austattung und Ruhe waren keine unerreichbare Versprechungen sondern ganz normale Basics. Wir sind einfach nur glücklich und sehr zufrieden mit diesem Hotel und werde es sicher in der Zukunft wieder besuchen.",5,2014,10,28

El equipo del Centonze, su restaurante, fue cómplice activo de una noche inolvidable.

Gracias por una noche perfecta!
Y sí, vamos a casarnos ;)",5,2014,09,30
37,Top Lage mit kleinen Makeln,"Das Hotel entspricht dem von uns sehr geschätzten Le Méridien Stil. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Leider war für uns nicht dasjenige Zimmer reserviert, welches wir auf unserer Bestätigung hatten. Schade, dass uns dies nicht bereits bei der Buchungsbestätigung mitgeteilt wurde. Nach einem Wechsel in ein Zimmer zur Rambla hin waren wir jedoch mit Grösse und Sauberkeit der Suite sehr zufrieden. Auch unsere Kinder hatten genug Platz, um zu spielen und den Menschen auf der Rambla zuzuschauen. Einziger wahrer Makel: das an sich sehr grosszügige Sofabett ist für leichtgewichtige Kleinkinder sicher geeignet. Es ist jedoch dermassen hart, dass sogar unser 11-jähriger, sehr schlanke Sohn Mühe hatte, darauf einzuschlafen.
Das Frühstücksbuffet hat uns vollauf befriedigt: grosse Auswahl, netter Service, warme Gerichte auf Bestellung, mehr braucht es nicht.
Das Restaurant Centonze hat uns zwar mit sehr gutem Essen überzeugt, hingegen wurden wir zu einem Dreiertisch gewiesen, obwohl wir 36 Stunden vorher für unsere Familie definitiv einen Vierertisch reserviert hatte. Unser energischen Eingreifen, insbesondere zum Wohl unserer Buben, hat uns dann doch einen Vierertisch am Fenster ermöglicht. Weshalb uns dann mitgeteilt wurde, es gäbe keine Kinderkarte, war uns ein Rätsel, denn auf dem Internet findet sich sehr wohl eine Kinderkarte. Wir hatten den leisen Verdacht, dass Kinder nicht sehr erwünscht sind und dass sich der Service etwas nach dem Grad der SPG-Mitgliedschaft richtet. Das darf aber nicht sein, denn wir sind selber auch SPG-Members und unsere Buben sind die Kunden von morgen!
Insgesamt hatten wir aber einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt im Le Méridien und werden sicher ein nächstes Mal wiederkommen (sofern das Sofabett ausgetauscht worden ist...)!",4,2014,09,30
37,Nie wieder,"Der Checkin-Schalter ist zu klein, höchstens mit zwei Personen besetzt und so entstehen längere Wartezeiten. Ebenso der Checkout-Schalter, der nur mit einer Person besetzt ist. Die Zimmer sind eher klein, ebenso das Badezimmer. Unser Badezimmer verfügte über keine Türe!!!!! Nachdem wir reklamierten (und davon angeblich keiner wusste) zogen wir am nächsten Tag um. Auch diese Schiebetüre liess sich nicht komplett schliessen, ansonsten das Zimmer das Gleiche war. Das Frühstück zum Preis von Euro 27.50 pro Person, entspricht nicht der Qualität und Vielfalt, die zu diesem Preis erwartet wird.  Gesamthaft gesehen entsprechen die Leistungen bei weitem nicht einem Fünfsterne-Hotel. Auch das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis ist schlecht. Schade, wir würden dieses Hotel nicht mehr wählen, obwohl die Lage ausgezeichnet ist, d.h. nur wenige Schritte von der La Rambla entfernt.",2,2014,09,29
37,Un hotel & personal de 5 Estrellas!,"Todo la atención al cliente desde el momento que los maleteros te ayudan con las maletas al salir de taxi, hasta la fina atención brindada por la Recepcion , hasta la delicia de la comida en el a restaurante Cent Onze de Le Meridien en Barcelona hace de este un hotel una experiencia total de 5 estrellas. Esmerados, eficientes, considerados, con mucho ojo al detalle son algunos de los halagos que se merecen los empleados y el hotel en general. Me siento como 'en casa'. Muchísimas gracias por todo!",5,2014,09,22
37,Strategico,"Con la mia famiglia è la prima volta che venivo a Barcellona. Per questo ho scelto un albergo con la garanzia di una grande catena alberghiera alle spalle.......
Ottima la posizione decisamente strategica da tutti i punti di vista:  dal turismo  allo shopping......!
Il Direttore e il personale sono attenti e premurosi alle esigenze dei clienti: Victor in particolare ci ha aiutato a risolvere rapidamente un problema per renderci pienamente soddisfatti della nostra permanenza!
Le camere sono moderne e silenziose malgrado la vicinanza alla vivacissima Rambla. Sono inoltre dotate di tutti conforts. Unica pecca un collegamento wi-fi troppo lento e ""ballerino"".
Ho trovato la reception un pò sacrificata e senza un vero salone:  pochi divani e poltrone per un albergo a 5 stelle.
Ristorante molto buono con prezzi nella media.
Consigliato particolarmente  a famiglie con bambini e ragazzi e giovani coppie.

37,Buena ubicacion,"Es la segunda vez que nos alojamos, la ubicación aunque muy turísitca es inmejorable si buscas estar en el centro.

37,El mejor trato.,"Todo en este hotel es muy bueno, las habitaciones, el trato del personal es excelente, el desayuno incluido es muy bueno.

Amabilidad del personal, recepción, camareros...
Un detalle que me encantó, tv en el espejo del baño!",5,2014,06,05
37,Ottima esperienza,"Mi ero recato in passato all'hotel posizionato di fronte  (1898) e volevo tornarci per l'ottimo ricordo che avevo. Non trovando posto ho optato per il Meridien volendo conservare l'ottima location sulla Rambla. Con grande soddisfazione devo dire che sono entrambi 2 ottimi hotels. Il Meridien coniuga un ottimo livello di servizio a camere godibili e ampie. Le finestre sono perfettamente insonorizzate evitando il rumore a tutte le ore proveniente dalla famosa via. Gli arredi moderni ed i bagni ottimamente accessoriati. Nelle suites ci sono perfino degli schermi televisivi inseriti nello specchio del bagno. La colazione è faraonica ma decisamente fuori prezzo (27 euro). Se siete con bambini consiglio una suite. Noi abbiamo alloggiato nella 715, molto ampia, posta sul retro al 7 piano. In alternativa la 717 ė leggermente più piccola ma più luminosa se non si hanno bambini.

El hotel en si ofrece la mayor comodidad; las habitaciones son reformadas, muy limpias y cuidadas y las zonas nobles bonitas y acogedores. Aún asi lo mejor es el servicio que ofrecen; personal sonriente y amable. Te hacen sentir como en casa.

Desde mi ultima estancia me gustaría destacar la bienvenida de Salvador Batlle de front desk.

nos alojamos mi mujer y yo el año pasado, para pasar una noche antes de coger nuestro crucero de Luna de miel y todo fue fantastico y sobre ruedas, desde la llegada al hotel, hasta la misma salida, se nota que en este hotel cuidan los detalles, tuvimos amenidades de bienvenida, cava y chocolates buenisimos y la suite era espectacular, con una bonita terraza que daba a las ramblas. cenamos de room service muy bien y nos quedamos con las ganas de comer en el cent onze ya que debiamos ir con tiempo al barco. muchas gracias a todo el personal del hotel, sois estupendos",5,2014,03,22
37,Gutes Hotel in TOP Lage,"Wie schon mehrmals geschrieben ist das Hotel direkt an der Rambles gelegen. Zentraler gehts fast gar nicht.
In 2 Minuten am Plaza Catalunya und in 5 Minuten am Kolumbusdenkmal.
Ein ganz großer Pluspunkt und ein MUSS für jeden, der was erleben will.
Wer Ruhe will, sollte wenn möglich ein Zimmer zur Rückseite buchen.
Die Begrüßung im Hotel war sehr aufmerksam und freundlich.
Wir hatten in 4-5 Minuten unsere Chipkarten für die Zimmer.
Das Zimmer war geräumig, sehr sauber und aufgeräumt. (Sollte aber auch normal sein für den bezahlten Standard).
Das Badezimmer war groß und TOTAL clean. Sehr gut.
Das Frühstück war in Ordnung, das Buffett könnte besser bestückt sein, der Kaffee schmeckend alles war gut.
Ich werde mit meiner Frau dieses Hotel im Herbst wieder buchen, denn die Vorteile der Hotels überwiegen die kleinen Fehler.

Sauberkeit: Zimmer war sauber, im Bad hätte man aber die Flecken an den Glaswänden putzen dürfen
Fazit: Gutes 3* Hotel, Preis-Leistung (im Hinblick auf die Zimmer) stimmt hier nicht",3,2014,03,09

37,ottimo ristorante nell'hotel!!,"sono stata in questo hotel dal primo dell'anno per quattro giorni, avevamo una camera superior,molto grande con un bel bagno e tutto insonorizzato,visto che l'hotel è sulla rambla pensavo che si sentisse molto rumore,ottima colazione con varietà e quello al quale darei un bel dieci è l'ottimo ristorante 100onze dove si mangia benissimo!!!..se dovessi tornare a Barcellona ci tornerei sicuramente!!!",4,2014,02,12
37,"Schlechtes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, schlechter Service","Wir haben im Le Meridien unsere Hochzeitsreise verbracht. Gebucht war das Zimmer schon sieben Monate im Voraus und die Dame im Reisebüro hatte schriftlich darauf hingewiesen, dass es sich im eine Hochzeitsreise handle. Um sicher zu gehen, dass auch wirklich alles gut sein wird, schrieb ich vier Tage vor Ankunft noch einmal eine Mail an das Hotel mit dem Hinweis, dass wir bald unsere Flitterwochen in Barcelona antreten werden. Ich schrieb die Mail auf Englisch, damit auch jeder sie verstehen konnte - und erhielt auch eine Antwort: Alles würde gut sein.

Als wir ankamen, der Schock: Statt einem Zimmer mit einem großen Bett, hatte man uns ein Zimmer mit zwei getrennten Betten bestellt. Wir waren eher traurig, als wütend. Doch leider zeigte das Personal werde Reue, noch irgendein Entgegenkommen. Wir wurden auf den nächsten Tag vertröstet, dann würde man ein schöneres Zimmer für uns haben.

Es hätte ja einige Möglichkeiten gegeben, den Fehler mit ein paar Aufmerksamkeiten wieder wett zu machen. Zum Dinner oder Frühstück einladen, die erste Übernachtung schenken, eine Flasche Wein/Sekt aufs Zimmer liefern. Nichts. Stattdessen erlebten wir Überheblichkeit und Arroganz.

Zudem ist das Hotel viel zu teuer. Die Zimmer sind sehr klein und abgewohnt. Highspeed W-LAN muss man für 20 Euro pro Tag(!) extra dazu buchen (kostenlos gibt es nur Lowspeed W-Land).
Das Frühstück hatten wir zum Glück nicht mit gebucht. 30 Euro wäre es keinesfalls wert gewesen (einmal haben wir mit gefrühstückt): Die Pancakes waren kalt, die Karaffe mit dem Sirup hat geklebt (das nächste Waschbecken war 3 Gehminuten entfernt), das ganze Buffett sah aus wie geplündert, es wurde nicht ordentlich nachgelegt, nach Kaffee musste man extra fragen (ein Kellner kam aber auch nicht von sich aus an den Tisch - da musste man schon winken).

Unser Fazit: Nie wieder.",2,2014,01,26
37,"Lage OK, Hotel eher Business","Gutes Hotel, direkt an den Ramblas. Viele andere Sehenswuerdigkeiten in Reichweite. 
Zimmer sind sauber und es fehlt an nichts. Kleines Manko, es gibt nur kleine eingebaute Buegelbretter. Dusche ist in der Badewanne mit sehr hohem Einstieg (nicht Behindertengerecht). Lage ist wirklich zentral (15min zum Flughafen, 8 min zum Bahnhof). 
Ramblas sind etwas ueberbewertet, Restaurants sind ueberteuert. Fuer Business ist die Lage top, fuer ein Wochenende dann eher ein anderes Hotel.",4,2013,12,08
37,Excepcional,"Nuestra estancia fue únicamente durante una noche el pasado 31 de octubre de 2013. Señalar que incluimos un tratamiento en el spa el cual fue sencillamente maravilloso.

En cuanto a la suite, la habitación era muy amplia y con unas vistas a Barcelona preciosas. En cuanto al trato recibido fue totalmente personalizado y en todo momento atendieron nuestras necesidades con gran amabilidad y rapidez.

En relación al desayuno, señalar que fue muy variado incluyendo gran cantidad y calidad de productos diferentes, de forma que pudieras elaborar desde un desayuno totalmente vegetariano a un desayuno continental.

Ciertamente recomendable",5,2013,12,04
37,"Top Lage, angenehmes Stadthotel","Das Hotel liegt an der berühmten Ramblas. Sehenswürdigkeiten von Barcelone sind lediglich einige Schritte entfernt. Hervorzuheben ist das gute Frühstückbuffet im schönen Restaurant direkt mit Blick Ramblas. Fitnessraum ist für ein 5* eher mager eingerichtet jedoch o.k.(Ausdauer und Kraft). Die Zimmer sind schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen und etwas klein sind jedoch sauber. Im 6. Stock befindet sich eine kleine Wellnessraum mit einer Terasse und Liegestühle. 
Einziger ""negtiver"" Punkt ist die Begrüssung an der Rezeption, das Personal war sehr unfreundlich und entsprach überhaupt nicht dem sStandard eines 5* Hotels. Anderseits waren die Kellner sehr freunlcih und zuvorkommend. Auch wenn das Hotel eher teuer ist, so kann man hier einige schöne Tage in Barcelona verbringen (inkl WiFi). 

Kleiner Tipp für ein Restaurant ca 15' entfernt (Strasse Provenca 332 - an dieser Strasse liegt auch das Haus von Gaudi-  bei der Kreuzung Diagonal) eine kleine herzliche sehr gute und günstige Pizzeria, das Ristorante Pizzeria Eden... ist sicher ein Abendessen wert!",5,2013,11,26
37,Muy buen servicio. Acogedor.,"Estuvimos alojados en oportunidad del clásico de fútbol. La ubicación es privilegiada. La atmósfera de diseño contemporáneo le da un plus, pese a que el edifico es tradicional. El baño para discapacitados de la habitación 111 es el mejor que me tocó ocupar. Y la atención del personal de Front es impecable, y definitivamente es lo que hace que valga la pena pagar una tarifa demasiado alta. Lázaro, mis eternas gracias por tu impecable atención.",4,2013,11,14
37,Ottimo Hotel in posizione strategica,"Un 5 stelle anche se più vicino a 4, situato all'imizio delle Ramblas a un passo da Palza Catalunya.

Praticamente sotto l'hotel c'è il Carrefour comodissimo per piccole spesucce alimentari.
La camera è bella, non grandissima ma con tutto quello che serve. Bello il bagno con vasca e doccia, asciugacapelli, etc.

La cena muy buena y el servicio excelente, muy profesional.",5,2013,10,26
37,Excelente opcion,"Excelente hotel! Muy buen servicio y muy buena ubicacion, caminando ibamos y veniamos a deliciosos restaurantes, tiendas y puntos de interes. Las habitaciones amplias y con mobiliario moderno y comodo. Tuvimos ademas la suerte de que a nuestra habitacion llegaba muy bien la señal de wi fi del lobby. Los desayunos muy completos y variados. Definitivamente me volveria a hospedar ahi!",5,2013,09,28
37,Ohne Atmosphäre und überteuert,"Das Hotel lebt vorallem durch seine gute Lage an der Ramblas.
Normaler Empfang, die Rezeption etwas langsam. Das Zimmer war unser gebuchtes Zimmer, klein, und schon fast abgewohnt. Wirklich nichts besonders. Das Badezimmer war schön. 
Das Personal beim Frühstück desintressiert, magere Brotauswahl..nach dem Brotmesser musste man fragen. Spärliche Käseauswahl, kein Serranoschinken sondern nur fette Salami. Nach jedem Orangensaft oder Kaffee musste man fragen, von selber mal auf die Idee zu kommen ob ein Gast noch Saft möchte war zuviel verlangt. 
Ingesamt fanden wir es ein mässiges Le Meridien. Mit 400 Euro natürlich für das ""Gebotene"" völlig überteuert. Da wir nicht wieder dieses Hotel wählen würden können wir können es desshalb nicht wirklich empfehlen.",3,2013,09,04
37,"Mehr ""Schein"" als ""Sein""","Die meist guten Bewertungen hier kann ich leider nicht bestätigen. Hier sind Preis-Leistungsverhältnis nicht passend und sogar von einem 5 Sterne Haus würde ich hier nicht sprechen.
Natürlich ist die Lage wunderbar, gut vom Flughafen mit Taxi oder Bus zu erreichen. Ein paar Schritte und man ist mitten im Leben. Schön!
Die Lobby ist viel zu klein, an einem SA Nachmittag drängen sich Gäste für den check in/check out auf enngem Raum. Nur zwei Personen an der Rezeption (ein Trainee) sorgen für ein sehr langsames check in. Begrüssung normal. Als SPG Platinum Member erhielten wir kein Upgrade, auf Nachfrage erhielten wir die Antwort dass das Hotel ausgebucht sei. Später sahen wir auf der Starwood Hotelseite dass noch Junior Suiten und Suiten angeboten wurden. Sehr unschön als Gast angelogen zu werden!! Unser Zimmer war mässig, nicht unsauber aber auch nicht frisch. Blick zur Ramblas wie gebucht. Die Einrichtung schrecklich, das Bett zu weich oder durchgelegen. Das Badezimmer allerdings war gross und Top!
Beim Frühstücks Buffet wird natürlich satt, aber es hatte auch nichts mit einem 5 Sterne Hotel Buffet zu tun. 4 Wurstsorten/ 2 Käsesorten ist einfach zu einfach, ein Omlett das Innen noch Roh war und wenig Brotauswahl. Alles sehr Bescheiden. Ich ging sehr früh zum Frühstücken ( .30). Nur 4 Tische waren besetzt, an den Fenstertischen sass nur ein jap. Paar. Die Angestellte sagte zu mir dass die Tische am Fenster reserviert sind. Frühstückstische reserviert???
Ich setzte mich trotzdem und in den 1 1/2 Stunden beim Frühstück kam nur noch ein Ehepaar an die Tischfenster. Dafür sah ich dass das jap. Ehepaar dem Mädchen ""Trinkgeld"" zuschoben. 
Also Fensterplätze gegen Bezahlung ??
Das Personal mässig freundlich, beim Hotel betreten oder verlassen habe ich NIE eine Begrüssung/Verabschiedung gehört.
Alles in allem ein enttäuschendes Hotel. Unser Zimmerpreis ( mit Frühstück) konnten wir kurz vor der Anreise von 415 Euro auf 314 Euro umbuchen. Aber auch der Betrag steht leider in keiner Weise zu den erbrachten Leistungen.
Absolut nicht zu empfehlen, es sei denn Sie erhalten eine Zimmerate von 200 Euro.",3,2013,08,27
37,El personal hace la diferencia!,"Excelente ubicación, atención personalizada, habitaciones muy confortables, siempre llegare al Le Meridien cuando este de visita en Barcelona. Tiene un excelente conserje para indicarle los buenos restaurantes, no turísticos. El personal muy profesional y eso hace la diferencia cuando uno llega a un hotel. Los desayunos son estupendos, muy completos. La carta para comer o cenar, sencilla pero muy sabrosa. Y el nuevo cafe bar a la entrada, tiene un buen cafe. En un año, he llegado 3 veces....muy recomendable!",5,2013,08,03
37,Può migliorare molto,"Hotel direttamente sulla rambla  ma abbastanza insonorizzato , personale cortese anche se abbiamo avuto la camera alle 15 e non alle 12 come avevamo chiesto ( capisco l'hotel pieno e quindi certi inconvenienti possono capitare). Cosa inaccettabile il bagno della nostra camera peraltro pulitissima aveva evidenti tracce di muffa nella doccia e mancava di bidè ( non vorranno anche in Spagna far concorrenza ai francesi ). Colazione in linea con la categoria del l'albero.",3,2013,07,28
37,"non solo hotel,ottima ristorazione","Camminando lungo las rablas,abbiamo cenato in questo hotel(catena nota di merito).La scelta,visto l'ora tarda,è stata su un menù ""degustazione  catalana""ovvero:antipasto,paella,crema catalana e sangria.Tutto buonissimo e con porzioni anche abbondanti.Ottimo il personale,ambiente molto elegante e moderno;buono il prezzo.",4,2013,07,27
37,El Mejor Hotel De Barcelona,Fantastico el trato recibido.Soy Italiano y nos trataron muy bien.Calidad precio optimo y todo explicado en Italiano. El restaurante cada dia nos sorprendia con nuevos menú y el personal super atento.Repetiremos!!!!!!!!!,5,2013,07,10
37,Muy buen hotel,"Muy buen edificio bien mantenido en una inmejorable ubicación, Las Ramblas, para quie esta en Barcelona de turista. Personalmente me resulta perfecto pues queda cerca de los puntos de atracción, de restoranes y de tiendas y en caso que uno quiera irse más lejos los medios de transportes permiten a uno trasladarse en forma rápida.

Nos alojamos en una suite, la cual era perfecta, grande amplia con unos sillones súper cómodos con un plasma de tamaño acorde a la habitación, la misma tenía terraza a la calle con reposeras, mesa y sillas para disfrutar el buen tiempo. La disposicion de la suite era perfecta pues tiene una puerta corrediza que separa una zona de vestido res y el baño con el resto de la suite, lo que permite tener todo ordenado y lugar para las valijas, el baño impresionante con un plasma integrado al espejo, la ducha impresionante, los amenities también, cuidando al máximo todos los detalles. La fama y las almohadas de la categoría de la cadena que es perfecta lo que garantiza un excelente descanso. 
La atención buenísima tanto en la recepción como la conserjería, quienes están muy bien informados a la hora de recomendar buenos lugares a donde ir, incluso aún solicitando lugares para cenar tarde, los cuales los encontramos perfectos. 
Me encanta Barcelona y sin duda volvería a Le Meridien",5,2013,06,28
37,gutes business hotel,"für geschäftreisen ein gutes hotel in bester lage, die zimmer mässig gross, dafür das badezimmer selbst herrlich. das frühstücksbuffet nicht riesengross, jedoch ausreichend, vor allem variantenreich.
das design muss man mögen, eben typisch für le meridien.
im wesentlichen jedoch absolut weiterzuempfehlen",4,2013,06,22
37,Posizione centrale ed hotel molto bello,"Ho soggiornato qui la scorsa settimana, ci ero già stato altre volte, il personale è molto gentile, su mia richiesta mi hanno dato una camera migliore che era molto bella, peccato l'WI-FI che non aveva un ottima ricezione, bagno a vetri satinati molto bello. La colazione poteva essere migliorabile sullo standard di grossi hotel Starwood. La posizione proprio sulla Rambla vicino a Piazza di Catalunia è super. La scorsa volta sono stato in una suite e la vista era superba, dal balcone si poteva vedere tutta Barcellona.",4,2013,06,18
37,"Calidad, profesionalidad y trato personalizado.  Un lujo en el Centro de BCN","Estoy encantada con el trato recibido para mis huespedes de reuniones. Ubicación genial, trato personal exquisito, flexibilidad y adaptación a las necesidades de nuestros visitors.  Todo el mundo quiere volver a reunirse en Barcelona cuando se alojan en el Meridien Barcelona.  Aunque terminen tarde las reuniones, puedes disfrutar de Barcelona pues están en el centro y a la vez las habitaciones son tranquilas y cómodas.  El restaurante Cent Onze del hotel organiza tb. actividades gastronómcas para grupos: taller de tapas, paellas.  Genial!!",5,2013,06,13
37,Perfetto,"Posizione ottima, lungo le ramblas, da dove e' possibile raggiungere i posti più' caratteristici della città' a piedi tra cui il porto, la spiaggia ma anche la pedrera e casa batilo. A pochi passi c'e anche la fermata della metropolitana. L'albergo e' pulito, silenzioso e il personale estremamente cordiale e disponibile.",5,2013,05,11
37,Bella struttura e location perfetta in tutti i sensi,"Abbiamo soggiornato un paio di notti presso il Le Méridien Barcelona a dicembre 2012.

L'hotel si trova sulla Rambla, a due passi dalla Boquería e da Plaça de Catalunya: in piena movida diurna. Di notte, tuttavia, il riposo è assicurato perché il movimento cala moltissimo.

Noi (grazie ad un upgrade gratuito) abbiamo dormito in una Suite Mediterranean, con interni davvero particolari e una bellissima terrazza da cui si può vedere a destra la fiamma olimpica e il Palacio Nacional.

Nel complesso, davvero godibile e pratico.",5,2013,05,10
37,Excelente,"El servicio en general es excelente. El hotel esta cerca del Corte Ingles, las Ramblas, y otras tiendas muy padresss¡¡
No me gusta que te carguen un euro para UNICEF sin consultarte el cual quitaron cuando reclame.
El el bar del Lobby hay solo una persona atendiendolo de origen asiatico que habla poco español quien es muy amable y trabajador ya que hace la limpeza del bar, cocina, cobra y a hace el corte de caja ah¡ y sirve las mesas de manera muy atenta y servicial felicidades.
En el restaurante formal asistimos a comer a las 2pm d eun dia normal nadie nos atendio solo nos sentoel sr de la entrada y nadie volvio para tomar ordenes ni nada de bebidas, totalmente ignoradas eramos invisisbles que mejor nos fuimos un macdonalds cerca.
El desayuno caro y bueno.

37,Zentral gelegenes Haus mit Stil,"Das Le Merdien Barcelona befindet sich direkt an den Las Ramblas nur unweit des Plaza de Catalunya. 
Das Haus wurde erst vor kurzem renoviert und besticht durch sein modernes minimalistisches Design. Bei unserer Ankunft wurden wir freundlich begrüßt und man bot uns an uns auf unsere Suite zu begleiten.
Unsere Prestige Suite in der 6. Etage des Hauses zeichnete sich durch ihr in warmen Erdtönen gehaltenes modernes Design aus und bot einen herrlichen Blick über die Las Ramblas und die Stadt. Neben einem Wohnbereich mit großer Coach, großem 42 Zoll Fernseher sowie einem großen Schreibtisch, einem getrennten Schlafbereich (ebenfalls mit großem Fernseher) verfügte die Suite über ein sehr großzügig geschnittenes Badezimmer mit räumlich seperierter Toilette und Bidet sowie Dusche, Badewanne und im Spiegel intergrierten TV. Einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt stellte der Duschkopf dar, aus dem leider zu wenig Wasser floss, hier sollte man seitens des Hauses undbedingt auf einen Regenduschkopf aufrüsten.
Die Zimmerreinigung sowie der Turndown-Service erfolgten täglich zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit.

Das Frühstück wird im ""Cent Onze"" Restaurant serviert. Das neue ""Signature Breakfast"" Konzept, das sehr geschmackvollen Kaffeee der Marke Illy beinhaltet war hinsichtlich Qualität und Auswahl der Gerichte leider eher enttäuschend (Unter anderem wurden vorgefertigte Pfannkuchen mit Schokoladen- und Himbeersauce, aufgeweichte und kalte Eggs Benedikt vom Buffet, zwei Obssorten (Melone und Erdbeere), drei bis vier Brotsorten geboten) und entsprach nicht dem, was man sonst von Le Meridien kennt.
Auch der Service war während unseres Aufenthalts etwas unkoordiniert und weniger zuvorkommend. So musste man immer wieder darum bitten, den Orangensaft nachzuschenken, frischen Kaffe zu bringen oder das Besteck aufzufüllen. Hier gibt es noch einiges an Verbesserungspotential.

Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption waren hingegen stets bemüht und hilfsbereit, so stellte es bei unserer sehr frühen Abreise am letzetn Tag auch kein Problem da, satt dem regulären Frühstück, für uns ein sehr ausgiebiges Frühstückspaket mit frischem Kaffee zu organisieren. 

Insgesamt ist ein Aufenthalt im Le Meridien Barcelona all jenen zu empfehlen, die ein zentrales  Hotel mit gutem fünf Sterne Standard suchen und dabei auf ein enstprechendes Design und den entsprechenden Komfort nicht verzichten wollen.",4,2013,03,18
37,bravi Spagnoli,"ho soggiornato in questo hotel tutto ottimo come quasi tutti gli hotel spagnoli che ho soggiornato ,hanno un ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo in piu' a pochi passi dal centro . L'hotel è comunque molto silenzioso. Le camere sono belle, modernamente arredate.Molto consigliato",4,2013,02,25
37,Hotel de ensueño,Fantastica la estancia en Hotel le Meridien y su restaurante buenissimo.El personal nos dio un trato exquisito y repetiremos por el gran confort recibido.Os lo aconsejo precio calidad fantastico.Seguramente repiteremos a dos pasos de las ramblas.,5,2013,02,24
37,Ottima location!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel dal 5 al 10 febbraio 2013, camera accogliente, bagno spazioso con box doccia in pietra, e tv in bagno! grande televisore anche in camera con canali italiani. La posizione é ottima, sulla rambla, accanto a quasi tutte le zone da visitare di Barcellona. Il personale é molto gentile, esaudiscono ogni richiesta, ci hanno dato informazioni valide su tutto cioé che abbiamo richiesto; Il 6 di Febbraio era il compleanno di mio marito e ci hanno fatto trovare in camera una bottiglia di spumante in fresco con fragole, e un bigliettino di auguri dello staff.Lo consiglio assolutamente!",4,2013,02,14
37,Traumhaft gelegen,"Das Le Meridien in Barcelona ist traumhaft zentral gelegen. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut zu Fuß erreichbar und die Metro ist keine 3 Minuten entfernt. Zimmer modern und ansprechend. Neue Betten und sehr sauber. Rezeption war freundlich und bei Bedarf auch deutschsprachig. Concierge hatte gute Restaurantempfehlungen. Das Frühstücksbuffet war gut, ansonsten Restaurant nicht getestet.",5,2013,02,12
37,Un buon hotel,"Ho soggiornato per due notti per motivi di lavoro . L' Hotel si trova sulle ramblas, via molto turistica e animata. Si può arrivare a piedi al mare, penso al porto vecchio. L'hotel è comunque molto silenzioso.
Le camere sono belle, modernamente arredate, io avevo una con letto matrimoniale che era ampia. Il bagno é abbastanza ampio con una doccia fantastica, grosso getto dall'alto e flessibile al muro in alternativa, molto ampia e con parete a vetro. Io odio le docce con tenda. Televisione anche in bagno. Nella stanza LCD 32 pollici a parete. Noce notturna blu che si accende con rilevazione del movimento, quindi comodo per chi si alza di notte.
Ottima la colazione, molta frutta fresca, che io adoro, con fragole intere, uva, ananas e meloni tagliati. Altra frutta da tagliare. Pane di diversi tipi e poi pane cale e uova in diversi modi. Insomma molto completa.
Personale molto gentile e collaborativo.
Ovviamente questo non è gratis, trovo soprattutto il prezzo della colazione molto alto, ma è ormai i sistemi che usano tutti gli alberghi.",5,2013,02,03
37,Ottimo hotel!!!!,"Bellissimo hotel, per non parlare poi della posizione, sulla Rambla,dove c'e movimento ad ogni ora del giorno e della notte nonostante ciò xò nelle camere non si sentiva nulla, un vero spettacolo!! 
Un complimento va anche al personale dell'hotel, sempre cordiale e disponibile!! 
Lo consiglio vivamente è spero di tornarci presto anche io!",5,2013,01,25
37,Bien y poco mas...,"Fue mi segunda estancia aqui y la habitacion de nuevo me parecio muy justa, eche en falta una banera en vez de la ducha. El personal de recepcion & lobby me parecio poco interesado en ayudar a los clientes. Por ejemplo no habia nadie en la puerta para ayudarnos a la llegada con las maletas. El desayuno me gusto y ahi el personal fue amable. No volveria en el futuro, la ciudad tiene muchos hoteles en esta categoria para concer y aqui no creo que mejoren nada mas.",3,2012,11,19
37,Eccellente rapporto qualità / prezzo,"La posizione dell'albergo è imbattibile, a meno che non abbiate la macchina (cosa che renderebbe il parcheggio possibile ma costoso). Stile abbastanza ricercato e propensione per l'arte in genere. Camere molto spaziose da poco ristrutturate, con stanze da bagno ampie e cabina doccia fantastica. Niente bidet. Niente vasca da bagno. Mega televisore in camera a schermo piatto, altro piccolo televisore in bagno (autonomo). Tanti accessori per il bagno. Armadi comodi. Letto comodissimo. Non mi è piaciuta la moquette nel corridoio dell'albergo e in camera. Nessun rumore dalla strada nel modo più assoluto, a differenza di quanto ho letto in altre recensioni (eravamo al terzo piano).",5,2012,11,09
37,Rundum zufrieden,"Eines meiner Lieblingshotels in Europa. 

Unschlagbare Lage direkt an den Ramblas. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß zu erreichen. Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind direkt zu erreichen. 

Die Zimmer sind sehr schön und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Tolle Betten, sehr guter Komfort. 

Badezimmer zwar nicht so groß, aber mit großer Regendusche. Sehr angenehm habe ich empfunden, das dezente Nachtlichter über Bewegungsmelder geschaltet wurden, sobald man das Bett verlassen hat. So gibt es kein rumsuchen nach einem Lichtschalter, der das Zimmer taghell erleuchten würde.

Alles picobello sauber. Personal sehr nett und hilfsbereit",5,2012,11,04
37,Restaurante CentOnze-Hotel Le Meridien. Muy buena elección,"El restaurante CentOnze situado en el Hotel Le Meridien es una grata sorpresa. Servicio excelente, con un personal muy atento y agradable. La verdad es que todo lo que comimos estaba buenísimo. El foie mi cuit excepcional, el solomillo de buey excelente, y el lomo de rape también riquísimo. Y los postres tampoco se quedan atrás. Probamos el bizcocho de chocolate y el cheescake. Ambos muy buenos. El único pero es que la carta de vinos es muy escasa y los precios excesivamente altos. 
En general, nos pareció un muy buen restaurante.",5,2012,10,29
37,immer gut,"man könnte sagen, dass ich voreingenommen bin, aber hier ist wirklich alles sehr gut (bis auf die musik im aufzug)
das rezeptionspersonal ist vielsprachig und immer freundlich und hilfsbereit.
die bäder sind schön gross und manche haben ein tv.von der tropendusche bin ich ganz begeistert.
vor allem gibt es auch nachts eine security, die die gänge kontrolliert.
der cappuccino an der kleinen bar ist sehr gut.
die lage des hotels ist wirklich unschlagbar. man ist direkt an der rambla und am markt.
ich komme jederzeit gerne.",5,2012,10,07
37,A pochi passi dalle Rambla,"Bell'hotel situato in ottima posizione a pochissimi passi dalle Rambla. Il personale e' estremamente cortese ed efficiente.
Abbiamo alloggiato in una suite per 4 persone molto confortevole con vista sulla Rambla. Il bagno molto grande con vasca e doccia aveva addirittura il televisore integrato nello specchio. 
La sera viene offerto l'aperitivo. La colazione nel ristorante e' di ottima qualita' e buona scelta.
C'e' anche una SPA con bagno turco, sauna, Jacuzzi esterna con vista di Barcellona ed un bel solarium.",5,2012,09,10
37,un nome una garanzia,"un nome che è una garanzia per un hotel molto bello e soprattutto in una posizione unica.
ingresso sulla rambla in prossimità di placa cataluna.
le camere sono comodissime, cuscini e lenzuola di altissima qualità. pulizia eccellente.
Cosa particolare: schermo piatto anche in bagno.
la colazione non posso valutarla perchè non l'avevamo inclusa, starbucks è a pochissimi mt.",5,2012,08,22
37,sehr gut und teuer,"Wir waren für eine Nacht im Meridien. Dank Navi hatten wir es sehr schnell gefunden und konnten auch direkt vor der Reception für 20 Minuten stehen bleiben. Check in + Check out am nächsten Tag ging schnell, sehr freundlich und professionell vor sich. Das Hotel erfüllte unsere Erwartungen voll und ganz. Ausreichend große, ruhige, bestens ausgestattete Zimmer + beste Lage um Barcelona zu erleben, bester, freundlicher Service. Das Frühstück war uns zu teuer, deshalb habe wir in der sehr nahen, großen Markthalle gefrühstückt. Dort war es ohnehin interessanter als im Hotel selbst. Der hohe Preis ( über 300.- pro Zimmer, pro Nacht nur für die Übernachtung ) ist auch der Grund dafür, dass wir nicht die volle Punktzahl geben. Bei diesem Preis sollte zumindest noch ein Pool auf dem Dach dabei sein!",4,2012,07,29
37,Avoid!,"El servicio en la recepción y el consierge son terribles, lentos y hasta groseros.
El wifi no funciona bien en las habitaciones, la señal es pésima, solo funciono desde el baño, así que no pude trabajar desde la habitación y tuve que ir a Starbucks! el lobby del hotel es tan pequeño que no hay donde sentarse.
Tuve que esperar un montón para que me asignaran una habitación, pedí cambio y no fue posible, dicen que el hotel esta lleno.
Decidí dormir un rato durante la tarde, y de repente me despiertan dos personas que entran al cuarto riendo. No se a que vinieron, cuando se dieron cuenta que yo estaba en la cama se asustaron y salieron corriendo.
Staff? 
Hable con el manager y aunque fue la única persona  amable  en todo el hotel no pudo hacer nada para darme una mejor habitación.
Me había quedado en otros meridien antes , este es sin ninguna duda el peor! Lobby es pequeñito e incomodo. Nada que ver con los otros.
",1,2012,07,11
37,Calidad,"Fantástico hotel en pleno corazón turístico de Barcelona, un 5 estrellas asequible, con muchísima calidad en el desayuno, en el trato al cliente, las habitaciones confortables y con una magnifica ducha. 
Situado en las Ramblas, junto al mercado de la Boqueria y frente al barrio gótico, a sólo 10 minutos de Pº de Gracia.
Ideal para turistas, menos recomendable para viaje de negocios, alejado de estación de AVE y salidas para el aeropuerto, muy dificil aparcar.",4,2012,06,18

37,Un regalo speciale,"L'albergo è stata una graditissima sorpresa! Bello, moderno, curato, nel centro della Rambla e a due passi dal quartiere gotico. Il servizio è stato perfetto e devo fare i complimenti ad Anna che ci ha accolto in modo molto amichevole e cordiale ma anche molto professionale e sempre con il sorriso sulle labbra. La stanza era spaziosa, ben curata, con un bel design, il bagno era spazioso e con una doccia molto bella e grande ma la ciliegina sulla torta è stato il terrazzo che dominava la città dove abbiamo preso un aperitivo seduti sulle sdraio al tramonto. Colazione principesca con dolce, salato, frutta, dolci e succhi energetizzanti all'ingresso. In conclusione: SUGGERITO CALDAMENTE!",5,2012,03,31

37,eccezionale posizione piccole pecche,"sono appena tornato da Barcellona dal Meridien, sono molto soddisfatto nel complesso, la posizione è ideale nella migliore parte della rambla a due passi da dal quartiere gotico con la cattedrale (affascinante) dal mercato della boqueria (incredibile) il palazzo della musica catalana (bellissimo ma si è obbligati alla visita guidata in tutte le lingue salvo l'italiano) i musei di Picasso, Dali. Ecco alcune pecche: mancavano i canali tv italiani, sono riuscito ad averne uno per miracolo (rai2) avevo prenotato una suite per tre persone e nel soggiorno per il terzo ospite non era previsto niente (ne lenzuola, asciugamani ecc.) ho dovuto richiedere tutto. Una chicca: era il mio compleanno e mi hanno fatto trovare una bottiglia di ottimo spumante e pasticcini senza che nessuno li avesse avvistati. Rapporto qualità prezzo considerato le 5 stelle molto buono. Vivamente consigliabile",5,2012,02,22
37,eccellente,"è un ottimo albergo,posizionato all'inizio delle Ramblas,in posizione strategica per visitare la città.Il personale ed il servizio sono ottimi come pure il ristorante dove il servizio è impeccabile.

37,saugut,"ich bin immer wieder sehr gerne in diesem hotel.
die lage ist, direkt an den ramblas, sehr gut.
das personal ist freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit und oftmals auch vielsprachig.
als kürzlich mein koffer defekt war, kam sofort ein mechaniker und bemühte sich sehr meinen koffer so zu reparieren, dass er den heimflug noch meistern konnte.
die zimmer sind wirklich sehr schön, die fenster lassen sich öffnen.
die badezimmer haben oft dusche und badewanne sowie ein tv. 
jede nacht gehen sicherheits-leute sämtliche flure ab und gucken nach dem rechten.
das einzige, das ich unerträglich finde, ist die beschallung im fahrstuhl. irgendein ""künstler2 hat eine 24h geräuschkulisse aufgenommen. vogelgepiepe geht ja noch, aber das wasserplätschern erinner mich an toilette und/oder badewanne. da lauf ich lieber treppen.",5,2012,02,05
37,Fueron las mejores vacaciones de la familia!!,"Me encanto todo, la ubicación, los cuartos triples, el servicio, todo excelente!! Lo recomiendo ampliamente!! ",5,2012,01,28
37,Decepcionante,"Realmente esperaba mas de un hotel de 5 estrellas y mas aún de esta cadena.

Si se va por turismo, como fué nuestro caso, la ubicación es excelente. Junto a las Ramblas, la mayor parte de las visitas turísticas son alcanzables a pie. La atención del personal del hotel fué inmejorable.

La habitación era muy amplia y el armario tenía muchas perchas de buena calidad (detalle muy tonto pero desgraciadamente poco frecuente). Pero la cama era bastante mala, hacía demasiado calor en la habitación y no había forma de regular la temperatura para que quedara medio normal.

El tema del parking fué un poco kafkiano y además bastante caro.

En la habitación que nos dieron, el baño (ducha, inodoro, lavabo, etc) estaba adaptado para minusválidos. La verdad es que la adaptación era muy buena, tanto que su uso por parte de una persona no discapacitada era incomodísimo. No había ducha propiamente dicha. El baño, que hay que decir que era muy bonito, era una superficie diáfana grande y en una esquina había un sumidero en el suelo. Ahí estaba el asiento y los asideros de la adaptación para minusválidos, con una ducha de teléfono y un rociador de gran diámetro arriba en la pared... que no funcionaba. El lavabo y el espejo estaban muy bajos, para una silla de ruedas. El mando del grifo tenía una palanca larguísima, para poder llegar bien desde la silla de ruedas. Pero desde la postura de una persona estando de pié no había forma de acercar la cara al grifo sin que el mando estuviera a punto de sacarte un ojo. Realmente, siendo una época de baja ocupación no entiendo porqué nos dieron esta habitación ya que no creo que todas sean iguales.

El buffet de desayuno estaba bien y de buena calidad, pero era bastante pequeño, había poca variedad y los bizcochos, cortados desde hacía horas, estaban secos.

Tengo que decir que hemos estado en buenos hoteles de 4 estrellas que estaban tan bien o mejor que este. Por supuesto no es que el hotel sea malo ni mucho menos, es un buen hotel pero creo que defrauda un poco las espectativas que uno se hace cuando acude a un establecimiento de esta categoría y de esta cadena.",3,2012,01,10
37,"Lage gut, Service nur durchschnittlich.","Das Le Meridien befindet sich direkt an Las Rambals, der ""Promenade"" Barcelonas. Der Eingang liegt ca. 100m ein einer kleinen Seitenstraße, wir haben ihn zuerst übersehen. Ansonsten war das Hotel insgesamt in Ordnung, relativ große Zimmer für ein Stadthotel in Barcelona, die Lage ist sehr gut um die Stadt zu erkunden. Der Service könnte ein wenig besser besser sein, Upgrades gab es auch als Starwood Gold keins, lediglich ein Late-Checkout wurde uns angeboten, was wir aber aufgrund unserer Flugzeiten nicht nutzten.",4,2011,12,08
37,tutto perfetto,"ho soggiornato diverse volte in questo hotel per lavoro ed ultimamente ci sono stato per viaggio di piacere con mia moglie.Molto apprezzata la posizione strategica direttamente sulla ramblas
L'hotel è perfetto in tutto, veramente un 5 stelle degno di questo nome , con camere spazose e modernissime, completamente insonorizzate, quindi anche se si dorme nel centro pulsante di Barcellona , non si sente nulla.
Personale di qualificato e gentilissimo, servizi di alto livello.",5,2011,12,06
37,Guter Standard,"Das Hotel Le Meridien ist ein schönes modernes Hotel direkt an der Las Ramplas. Wir hatten ein geräumiges und auch modernes Zimmer mit TV im Schlaf- und Badezimmerbereich. Minibar, Tresor und auch Bügel waren im Zimmer vorhanden. Zu Fuß ist man hier schnell an vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten wie zum Beispiel der Kathedrale oder auch diverse Museen. Wer sich für spanische Oper interessiert hat es auch nicht weit.

37,Mitten in der Stadt und trotzdem ruhig!,"Das Hotel Le Meridien Barcelona liegt direkt an Las Ramblas, jedoch ruhig in einer Seitenstrasse. Man geht aus dem Hotel raus und ist praktisch mitten in der Stadt drin. Achtung jedoch auf Trickdiebe, die in der Gegend ""arbeiten"" Die gesamte Hotel ist sehr stylisch. Die Zimmer gut ausgestattet und die Betten super bequem. Wer ein gutes 4 Sterne Hotel mitten in der Stadt sucht, wird hier nicht enttäuscht sein. Ich kann dieses Hotel sehr empfehlen.",4,2011,09,24
37,Spettacolare,"Sono stato in vacanza a Barcellona con la mia compagna e ci siamo trovati benissimo qui al Le Meridien Barcelona. La camera assegnataci era una suite mozzafiato, molto pulita e comoda. Il personale al ricevimento e al bar e' stato fenomenale per non parlare della posizione dell'hotel, praticamente al centro della Rambla. Un'esperienza da riprovare. Complimenti!",5,2011,09,04
37,Leider enttaeuschend ... Lage aber OK,"Aufgrund anderer Tripadvisor-Bewertungen waren wir vorgewarnt, leider kam es noch schlimmer. Während des Aufenthalts mussten wir 2x das Zimmer wechseln, weil es zu laut, zu klein und zu schmutzig war. Der Starwood-übliche Service wurde durchgängig nicht erreicht (fehlende Amenities) und auch das Personal war überwiegend überfordert. Allerdings immer recht freundlich, was ich in Katalonien nicht erwartet hätte. Das Hotel ist OK, wenn man nicht mehr als EUR 150/Nacht bezahlt, nicht zu viel erwartet, zur Low-Season kommt und nur kurz bleibt. Für alles andere empfehle ich das Hotel ausdrücklich nicht!",2,2011,07,11
37,Sehr nett!,"Das Hotel liegt wirklich direkt an der Rambla, allerdings liegt der Eingang in einer Seitenstraße, dh man muss ihn erst einmal suchen. Auch die Anfahrt mit dem Taxi kann schon mal zum Spießroutenlauf werden.
Ansonsten ist das Hotel sehr nett gestaltet. Die Zimmer sind groß und sauber. Es gibt reichlich Stauraum. Das Spa habe ich leider nicht ausprobiert, aber es soll sehr toll sein, auch wegen der Terrasse. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist auch sehr groß und echt lecker. Außerdem gibt es ein gut ausgestattetes Business Center.
Ich war wegen eines Seminars im Hotel, und die Seminarräumlichkeiten sind auch okay. Leider werden diese gerade im Keller auf absolute Eisschrank Temperatur heruntergekühlt, dh es empfiehlt sich, einen Pulli mitzunehmen.",5,2011,06,28
37,gutes Hotel direkt an der Ramblas,"Ein sehr angenehmes zentral gelegenes Hotel. Möchte man die Stadt besichtigen kann man dies wunderbar zu Fuss vom Hotel weg machen. Es gibt in der Umgebung wirklich alles: Historisches, Museen, Restaurants, Theater und viele Bars und Nachtclubs.
Man hat ein Angebot von günstig über mittelmässig bis teuer. Natürlich ist es ein Nichtraucherhotel. Die Zimmer sind gemütlich und ruhig gelegen. Der Fitnesscenter ist ein bischen klein geraten aber dafür ist man dort fast immer alleine. Das Massageprogramm im Haus ist phantastisch, die Preise dafür sehr hoch. Im Zimmer kann man sich kostenlos Kaffee und Tee zubereiten.",4,2011,06,05
37,Beste Lage - schönes Hotel mit stylischen Möbeln,"Ein geniales Hotel. TOP Lage, direkt an den Ramblas. Perfekter Ausgangspunkt um die Stadt (zu Fuß) zu erkunden oder shoppen zu gehn.
Quasi direkt nebenan ist die grosse Markthalle: 
 Einfach Wahnsinn das Angebot dort. 
Schickes Hotel mit Designer Möbeln. Vor allem das Bad war der Hammer: Grosse Duschkabine mit Rainshower Dusche. Bequemes Bett, schöne Möbel. Der Blick war leider in den Innenhof, aber dadurch war es sehr ruhig. Wir konnten sogar bei offenem Fenster schlafen. Im Aufzug war immer Vogelgezwitscher etc...- naja: Geschmackssache.
Internetempfang könnte besser sein",5,2011,05,08
37,Toller Ausgangspunkt für ein tolles Wochenende,"Das Le Meridien Barcelona ist ein toller Ausgangspunkt für ein Wochenende in Barcelona. Der Haupteingang ist nur 50m von Las Ramblas entfernt und man ist pratisch mittendrin. Wir haben ein tolles Zimmer bekommen (Starwood Platin Upgrade auf Suite), aber ich denke auch alle anderen Zimmer sind vollkommen ok. Auch wenn unser Schlafzimmerfenster auf die Las Ramblas ging war es nicht zu laut. Das Hotelfoyer ist klein, aber sehr gemütlich mit diversen Sitzgelegenheiten. Dazu ist das Personal wirklich hilfreich. Neben dem Hotel gibt es viele nette Essensgelegenheiten und ein besonderes Highlight ist sicher der Mark.",5,2011,05,08
37,Splendido hotel sulle Ramblas,"Bellissimo hotel sulle Ramblas tra la Boqueria e Placa Catalunya. Alcune camere sono un po piccole, ma silenziose e conformtevoli. vista incantevole, specialmente se si riesce ad ottenere una camera agli ultimi piani con balcone come e` capitato a me. Unico neo e` il prezzo, davvero caro, ma io ci andavo per lavoro.",4,2011,04,14
37,Super Hotel in zentralster Lage,"Das Le Meridien Barcelona ist direkt an der Ramblas in Barcelona gelegen. Es ist sehr modern / stylisch eingerichtet und hat komfortable Zimmer. Ich hab ein Upgrade auf eine Suite erhalten, diese war sehr geräumig und hätte auch für eine 4-köpfige Familie Platz gehabt. Das beste jedoch ist sicherlich die zentrale Lage. Aus dem Hotel raus, ist man bereits auf der Ramblas und kann von hier aus seinen Tag beginnen.",4,2011,02,13
37,die Lage ist gut,"wenn man Barcelona zu Fuß erkunden möchte.Die Zimmer sind eher klein und es paßt einfach das Preis-Leistungsverhältniss nicht.Es sind nahezu alle mit dem Staubsauger auf Kriegsfuß und die spanische Gelassenheit  (bei uns würde man sagen Aroganz) ist etwas nervig,für 5 Sterne fehlt meiner Meinung auch Einiges,es gibt weder einen Spabereich noch Sportmöglichkeiten und die 26.- extra für das Frühstück sind es einfach nicht wert",3,2011,01,04
37,Optimaler Ausgangspunkt um Barcelona zu Fuß zu erkunden,"Die Lage ist top, direkt an der Rambla und der perfekte Ausgangspunkt um die vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt zu erkunden. Das Hotel ist jedoch etwas in die Jahre bekommen und erfüllte nicht die Erwartungen an ein 5-Sterne-Haus in dieser Preiskategorie. Die Zimmer sind sauber und zweckmäßig. Internet gab es gegen Gebühr. Der Service war sehr nett und das Frühstücksbuffet war angemessen.",3,2010,12,24
37,"Hardware toll, Software mit Potential","Das Haus liegt direkt an der Ramblas, ist im neumodischen Designerchick eingerichtet. Die Betten sind gemütlich, das Dornbracht-designte Badezimmer mit Rainshower-Dusche einfach toll.
Die Zimmer zum Innenhof sind natürlich ruhiger als zur Seitenstraße der Ramblas, aber selbst dort konnte ich mit geöffnetem Fenster problemlos schlafen.
Der Service wirkt manchmal etwas überheblich, am Concierge-Desk sitzt selten jemand, an der Reception bekommt man alle Informationen mitgeteilt.",5,2010,11,24
37,knapp 5 Sterne,"Verbrachten vor einer Kreuzfahrt eine Nacht in diesem Haus (unser zweiter Aufenthalt innerhalb eines Jahres).
Freundlicher Empfang und sehr schönes Zimmer auf der Starwood Preferred Etage. Direkt an der Ramblas und bei richtiger Zimmerwahl trotzdem kein Lärm. Das Zimmer verfügte über alle Annehmlichkeiten eines 5 Sterne-Haus. Die Klimaanlage (November) war sehr leise und funktionierte tadellos (vgl. die Bewertung aus Miami).
Wir hatten die Genehmigung bis um 13:00 im Raum zu bleiben, trotzdem war die Zimmertüre, bei der Rückkehr von einem Morgenbummel, um 11:45 nicht mehr zu öffnen. Nach meinem Anruf an die Rezeption meinte man, ich solle gefälligst einen neuen Schlüssel abholen kommen. Nach meinem (netten aber ultimativen) Protest hat man sich aber anders entschieden und  der Chef der Guest-Relations ist persönlich an der Zimmertüre erschienen und hat sich für das ""Missverständnis"" entschuldigt. Schlussendlich bin immer noch ich der Gast, auch in einem 5-Sterne –Haus.
Sind bereits am 9./10. Januar wieder im gleichen Haus.",4,2010,11,22
37,excepcional,"Me he alojado muchas veces en este hotel, la última en noviembre de 2010 y ya es hora de reconocer la excepcional calidad del hotel y de su personal.
El trato siempre es excelente, cada vez nos ofrecen las mejores habitaciones disponibles (habitualmente suites o junior suites). El servicio de aparcamiento y botones es rápido y cortés. Los procesos de check-in y check-out eficaces y amables.
El desayuno es muy correcto, el restaurante superior al habitual en los hoteles de Barcelona, el bar excelente, sobretodo el personal.
Pero lo excepcional del Meridien es que, siendo un establecimiento de lujo, es un hotel sin pretensiones, integrado en la zona donde se ubica, y asegurando con dedicación el confort y calidad de sus huéspedes.
Espero volver y seguir disfrutando muchas veces de este gran hotel.",5,2010,11,17
37,Zentrale Lage,"Das Le Meridien in Barcelona ist ein ordentliches Hotel mit durchschnittlichen Zimmern in exzellenter Lage.
Während die Zimmer weder durch besondere Größe noch tolle Sicht hervorstechen (lediglich der Fernseher ist ungewöhnlich groß) ist die Lage ein absolutes Highlight. Wenn man das Hotel verlässt, steht man praktisch unmittelbar auf der Rambla, der zentralen Straße in Barcelona, die Richtung Meer führt. Kleine Cafes, ein Markt und viele kleine Geschäfte liegen direkt vor der Haustür. Hinter dem Hotel gibt es ausserdem noch einen Carrefour-Supermarkt.",5,2010,09,30
37,Lage ist nicht zu toppen!!,"Das Hotel le meridien Barcelona liegt direlt an der Haupteinkaufsstrasse ""la Rambla"" . Draussen tobt das Leben und das Hotel ist mitten in der Stadt ein Ort der Ruhe! Die Zimmer sind sehr schön, vor allem ist alles sauber, aber von le meridien ist man ja auch nichts anderes gewöhnt! Perfekes Sightseeing Hotel :)",5,2010,09,27
37,TOP Lage,"das hotel hat eine abslute toplage an der ramblas, der eingang, rezeption duftet nach dem eigenen le meridien duft.die zimmer sind sehr stylisch mit ipoddocking, flat und riesen betten.das bad ist sehr modern mit rainfalldusche und allen erdenklichen annehmlichkeiten wie bügelbrett, hoselbügler.leider fehlt dem hotel ein pool und die zimmer in den ersten geschossen sin sehr dunkel und klein.",4,2010,09,14
37,"Top Lage, netter Service","Das in unmittelbarer Nähe der berühmten Flaniermeile La Rambla gelegen Hotel, besticht durch seine ideale Lage im Herzen Barcelonas. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind somit binnen kürzester Zeit zu erreichen. Ideal auch für Shoppingtouren. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und auch vielsprachig.",4,2010,09,03
37,Eccellente,"Hotel in posizione privilegiata e non spaventi la vicinanza con la rammbla: insonorizzazione pressoché perfetta! Personale degno del livello dell'hotel con anche comonenti italiani che hanno dimostrato un occhio di riguardo (peraltro non necessario) verso i connazionali. Ottimo il buffet di prima colazione, tra l'altro con prezzo promozionale (15 € invece di 25). Tutto molto efficiente ed efficace l livello che è lecito attendersi da un 5 stelle. Purtroppo non sperimentato il ristorante che offre anche menù a prezzi interessanti. Se è vero che una buona vacanza inizia dall'hotel, la nostra visita a Barcellona (5 gg) è stata veramente bella! Unico piccolissimo neo: la fitness room completa ma piccola.",5,2010,08,27
37,Moderner Luxus direkt an den Ramblas,"Das moderne Hotel befindet sich in direkter Lage bei der berühmten Flaniermeile der Stadt und ist damit ideal um diese zu erkunden. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern ausgestattet, bieten jede Annehmlichkeit die man in dieser Klasse erwarten kann. Für meinen Geschmack sind die Betten allerdings zu weich, aber da hat wohl jeder eigene Präferenzen. Alles in allem ein sehr zu empfehlendes Haus in idealer Lage!",5,2010,08,06
37,Assolutamente un hotel da consigliare...,"Assolutamente un hotel da consigliare!! Locazione perfetta sulla rambla, personale molto gentile, seppur non parli nessuno l'italiano ci si capisce alla perfezione. Camera eccellente, molto grande e pulita, accessoriata benissimo con bollitore per the e caffè e ferro da stiro. Peccato solo per la vista sul retro Rambla.  Bagno stupendo, con tv e una doccia stratosferica! Colazione non fatta in hotel perché molto cara, com'è solito all'estero. Ci tornerò. ",5,2010,07,28
37,Zentraler gehts nicht!,"Direkt an der Rambla liegt eines der schönsten Hotels der Stadt! Es ist sehr modern und luxuriös ausgestattet, hilfreiches Personal und ansprechendes Ambiente lassen einen Aufenthalt gelingen. Die Zimmer sind sehr ansprechend, viel versteckte Beleuchtung, grosser Flachbildfernseher, ein kleiner sogar im Badezimmer wo man ohnehin schon Schwierigkeiten hat aus der überdimensional grossen Dusche herauszukommen. Internet ist mit ca. 20€ etwas teuer. Auf den preferred-Etagen gibt es im Flur kostenlos Wasser, Obst und Zeitungen.",5,2010,07,17
37,Zentraler geht es nicht,"Das Le Meridien Barcelona ist direkt am oberen Teil der Ramblas gelegen und gut über die U-Bahn zu erreichen. Es ist sehr stilvoll eingerichtet, die Zimmer sind gepflegt und modern möbliert. Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich und nach einem Wasserrohrdefekt wurde uns sofort ein anderes Zimmer und als Entschädigung für den ""Umzug"" ein Frühstück bereitgestellt. Ich kann es nur empfehlen.",5,2010,06,28
37,molto valido e comodo,"albergo centralissimo situato sulle rambla, camera comunque silenziosa e spaziosa, bagno molto carino, personale gentile e cortese, parcheggio un po' caro ma cmq in pieno centro (35 euro per notte), mi sono trovato benissimo",4,2010,06,25
37,Super Hotel Top Lage,Ich empfehle dass Le merdien aufjedenfall jedem ... Dass Hotel hat eine Super tolle Lage und ist sehr sauber gehalten.. Dass Personal so wie die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich. Zum glück hatte ich noch gutes wetter :-)) Man hat auch viele Möglichkeiten etwas zu Unternehmen.. Dass Hotel bietet einige ausflugsmöglichkeiten an.. Viel spass im Le meridien,4,2010,06,18
37,Cerca de todo,A metros de las ramblas y el barrio gotico. Caro pero muy agradable,4,2010,06,08
37,Nicht empfehlenswert,"Nach einem Aufenthalt auf den Kanarischen Inseln verbrachten wir noch 2 Nächte in meiner Lieblingsstadt Barcelona, da unser Stammthotel leider wegen Renovierung geschlossen war entschieden wir uns für einen Aufenthalt im Hotel Le Meridien direkt an den Ramblas. 

Nach einem zügigen Check In mit einer deutsch sprechenden Empfangsdame kam auch schon die Ernüchterung - das uns zugeteilte Hotel war eine Katastrophe - Haarbüschel im Badezimmer, im eigentlichen Zimmer, kaputte Vorhänge, Staub ohne Ende, defekte Elektronik. Nach einer Reklamation und durch Begutachtung der Hausdame mit Ihren Zimmermädchen bekammen wir ein Upgrade in eine Suite, auf den ersten Anblick ok, wenngleich auch hier einige Beanstandungen: verschmutzter Teppich, das Waschbecken im Badezimmer drohte von der Wand zu brechen, defekte Bleuchtung. Um Barcelona wenigsten ein bisschen genießen zu können reklamierten wir kein zweites mal und nahmen es einfach hin.

Auf jeden Fall ist dieses Haus nicht zu empfehlen.",2,2010,06,02
37,"Ottimo, consigliatissimo","Ottimo hotel a 50 metri dalle Ramblas. Cinque stelle piene, meritatissime.
L'hotel, nonostante si affacci praticamente sulle Ramblas, è comunque tranquillo e ben insonorizzato.
Hall accogliente. Bar/ristorante, con affaccio sulle Ramblas, ottimo sia come qualità che prezzi.
Stanze meravigliose. Arredate con gusto e cura. Grandi, spazione. Pulite. Bagno immenso e completo di tutto. La dotazione della stanza comprende tutto, dall'ombrello agli accapatoi, ciabatte, ecc.
Personale gentile e professionale.",5,2010,03,31
37,Lusso apparente ma igiene e pulizia deprecabili,"Centralissimo, a ridosso della Rambla ma per questo molto rumoroso. Sicuramente non all'altezza della sua fama e soprattutto riguardo igiene e pulizia, molto ma molto pessime. In 5 giorni di permanenza non hanno mai passato una volta l'aspirapolvere!!",2,2010,03,21
37,Es war perfekt gewesen,"Mein Aufenthalt im Le Meridien Barcelona war perfekt. Angefangen vom Check In über die freundliche Begrüßung bis hin zum Zimmer war alles super gewesen.
Das Frühstück am morgen war sehr lecker und die Shots direkt am Morgen machen einen guten Start. Die Auswahl war groß gewesen und lecker. 
Das Hotel liegt direkt im Zentrum von Barcelona. Die Ubahn ist fast direkt vor der Tür und kann bequem per Fuss erreicht werden. 
Das beste war allerdings das man im Hotel einen Voucher für den kostenlosen Eintritt in das Museum der Moderne bekommt. Der Hafen ist ebenfalls auch nur 20 Minuten entfernt. 
Im Gesamturteil war der Aufenthalt super gewesen und ich komme gerne wieder.",5,2010,02,05
37,Piacevolissimo Week End,"Io e mia moglie per l'anniversario di matrimonio ci siamo viziati con un week end a Barcelona,conoscevo già molto bene la città ma ogni volta è sempre bello ritornarci,ho scelto l'Hotel Le Meridien per la sua posizione e anche un pò per curiosità perchè me ne avevano parlato molto bene,siamo rimasti piacevolmente sorpresi e soddisfatti dall'accoglienza e dalla professionalità del personale,avevamo scelto una deluxe e devo dire che entrando in camera l'impatto è stato sbalorditivo!grande,luminosa, dotata di tv al plasma con la  pay ,impianto stereo, wi-fi,arredata benissimo,completa di salotto con divani e tavolino da fumo,un piccolo open space adibito a studio con libreria e scrittoio, un armadio a muro immenso con frigobar,cassaforte e angoletto bar con bollitore per tè e caffè,ma la cosa più bella era sicuramente il bagno: immenso! tutto granito e specchi con vasca da bagno ampia e dotata di una piccola zona ai suoi piedi fornita di sgabelli con ampia seduta per asciugarsi e rilassarsi dopo la doccia,il bagno era dotato di tutti i comfort possibili dagli accapatoi e pantofole ai teli ma soprattutto da tutti i prodotti da bagno possibili e immaginari,la colazione era a buffet e completa di tutto,noi l'abbiamo fatta perchè era compresa con la camera deluxe altrimenti ve la sconsiglio perchè  25 € a testa....e poi Barcelona offre talmente tanto con tutti i suoi tapas bar che avrete solo l'imbarazzo della scelta! spero di esservi stato utile,saludos y mucho besos",5,2010,01,13
37,Maravilloso,"Moderno, funcional y en la mejor zona de Barcelona.",5,2009,12,30
37,Mejor no podría ser,"Creo que ha sido un pleno acierto el elegir el hotel Meridien de Barcelona. Aunque al principio estaba dudando en elegir entre varios hoteles, porque en la ciudad condal han abierto muchos 5 estrellas en los ultimos años. Sin duda, este hotel demuestra estar a la cabeza en cuanto a destino ya sea de negocios (como yo he ido) o de ocio. 
Primero, su situación es simplemente perfecta. En pleno centro neurálgico de Barcelona (es decir, las Ramblas y Plaza Cataluña). 
Segundo, su personal es muy correcto en el trato. 
Y por ultimo, las habitaciones muy acogedoras y con una decoración cuidada.

Sin duda alguna, os invito a que lo probéis. Yo volveré al hotel.",5,2009,10,07
37,Habitaciones demasiado chicas,"El hotel tiene muy buena ubicacion, el lugar para desayunar no es muy lindo y es caro, las habitaciones son chicas",3,2009,07,24
37,"Das Hotel liegt sehr Zentral, nur der Gast stört.","Die Mitarbeiter des Hotels zeigten kein großes Interesse am Gast. Selbst ein ""normales"" Grüßen des Gastes wurde von den Mitarbeitern ignoriert. Das Zimmer in der 3.Etage war modern und sparsam eingerichtet. Das Badezimmer war mit separater Dusche und Fernseher ausgestattet. Leider wurde der bei der schriftlichen Reservierung angegebene Wunsch nach einer höheren Etage einfach ignoriert. Bei offenem Fenster war der Lärm der Rambla sehr störend. Das Frühstück war ausreichend und um Kaffee zu bekommen mussten 2 Kellner ""belästigt"" werden. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr günstig gelegen für eine Stadterkundung. Viele Restaurants in der Umgebung bieten gutes preiswertes Essen mit freundlichem Service. Barcelona ist immer eine Reise wert. Vielleicht beim nächsten Besuch mit freundlicheren Mitarbeitern.",3,2009,07,17
37,"Ristorante ""111"" sconsigliatissimo","Ottimo l' hotel, mentre il ristorante annesso (111) assolutamente da evitare. Cibo di qualità medio bassa e estremamente caro. A chi soggiorna in questo hotel sconsiglio questo ristorante.",3,2009,04,14
37,Entspricht nicht einem 5 Sterene Standard,"Das Le Meridien ist ein 5* Hotel an bester Lage direkt am berühmten La Rambla. Sehr schöne Architektur und renoviert. Super Lage direkt am La Rambla.Freundlich und kompetent, sehr viel Personal im Restaurantbereich.Das Frühstücksbuffet war sehr reichhaltig, jedoch waren vor allem Fleisch (Schinken) und der Fisch nicht gerade frisch. Beim Schinken konnte man es schon riechen, dass er alt war und aus meiner Sicht nicht mehr geniessbar. Die Sauberkeit des Buffetbereiches war oberflächlich gut, jedoch bei genauem hinsehen nicht optimal. Für ein Deluxe-Doppelzimmer kann man in dieser Preiskategorie ein Zimmer erwarten das grösser als knapp 18m2 inkl. Dusche ist. Das einzige Highlight war der 42
Fazit Zimmer: da die von uns ausgelegten Fuseln und Fäden immer am gleichen Ort waren. Die Minibar war mit befleckten Tassen und Gläsern bestückt. ""
",3,2009,04,10
37,ubicación buenísima y hotel de calidad,"El hotel dispone de garaje (35 Euros por día¡¡¡) y aparca el aparcacoches. Es un hotel muy moderno y renovado hace no mucho (antes tenía un aire clásico que tampoco me disgustaba). Las zonas comunes están muy bien (destaco la cafetería y el restaurante) y las habitaciones lo mismo, aunque pueden resultar algo pequeñas. A mi, mi mujer y mi hijo nos cambiaron de habitación con solo pedirlo por esa causa y por un problema de ruidos de la calefacción. La cama y el baño fantásticos. Las mejores duchas de mi vida. Muchos y buenos pequeños detalles. Resulta caro, pero es lujoso y está en un sitio inmejorable de Barcelona. El personal muy profesional y educado. Repetiría y lo recomiendo sin duda. Me extraña el lugar que ocupa en el listado de hoteles de Barcelona de tripadvisor; se ve que la gente es muy exigente.",5,2008,12,01
37,super Hotel,"Das Hotel  hat definitiv 5-Sterne verdient.Das Frühstück war reichhaltig.Die Lage ist wirklich spitze.Man sieht das Hotel an, dass es erstklassig ausgestattet  ist. Das Hotel ist eine gute Ausgangspunkt für einen Barcelona-Kurztrip.
Fazit Gastronomie: Frühstück reichhaltig
Fazit Hotellage: direkt an die Ramblas

37,hotel buono ma non 5 stelle,"il meridien di barcellona,ha come prerogative ,la posizione,il personale e l'affidabilità.manca però quel di più, che fa di un hotel un grand hotel a 5 stelle. Manca dell'atmosfera,delle sfumature di qualità per quanto riguarda il contatto con i clienti e infine le camere,sono pulite ma non hanno la qualità necessaria.In definitiva,un buon hotel 4 stelle, con i prezzi di un 5 stelle.",4,2008,10,06
37,ottimo,"Ottimamente locato (vicino alla Rambla). Camere superior pulite, silenziose, servizio eccellente.

Bagno molto grande, 2 tv lcd (uno in camero ed uno in bagno).",4,2008,10,05
37,Kein 5 Sterne Komfort!,"Wir wollten zentral logieren und etwas Luxus haben, deshalb diese Hotelwahl. Lage war sehr gut, um sich auch zu Fuss bewegen zu können. Preis-Leistung stimmt aber überhaupt nicht! Unser Zimmer (Nr. 506) Deluxe mit Rambla-View: extrem lärmig, sogar bei geschlossenem Fenster war der Strassenlärm gut zu hören. Das Hotel verdient höchstens 4 Sterne, Sauberkeit und Komfort entsprechen nicht einem 5 Sterne Hotel. Frühstück-Buffet war gut, aber auch im Speiseraum war die Sauberkeit nicht wie man es in einem 5 Sterne Hotel erwarten könnte. Personal war aber immer freundlich. Wir waren schon etwas enttäuscht, Hotel ist zwar kürzlich total renoviert worden, jedoch im Bad und Zimmer sind schon wieder einige Abnützungserscheinungen zu sehen. Badezimmertüre lässt sich nur bis auf einen Spalt schliessen, Zimmer sind recht klein mit simpler Einrichtung (hatten für ein 5 Sterne Deluxe-Zimmer ganz andere Erwartungen).",3,2008,03,21
37,Siamo stati bene,"Io e mio marito vi abbiamo pernottato per 3 notti.
Si trova nei pressi di piazza Catalunya .La metro è a circa 500 mt.
La colazione era buona(a buffet)  tipo continentale.Le camere erano pulite ed ogni giorno ci facevano trovare un cioccolatino sul comodino (anche se a me ha fatto venire un po' di mal di stomaco!)
Consiglio a tutti di andare a  Barcellona una città particolare soprattutto per le opere di Gaudì che le danno quel qualcosa in più rispetto a tante altre città europee.

37,Aeusserst zufrieden !,"Sehr zuvorkommender Service, ausgezeichnete sehr zentrale Lage, tolle Zimmer mit modernem Design, 42'' Plasma-Bildschirm mit Kabelfernsehen incl. verschiedener deutschsprachiger Sender, hatte ein sehr leises Zimmer zum Hinterhof (weiss nicht wie's ""vorne raus"" ist, d.h. mit Blick auf die Rambla)!

Einzige Kritikpunkte:
Extras sind z.T. ziemlich teuer, z.B. Internet EUR 0,50 pro Minute (max. EUR 17,50 pro Tag), Minibar min. EUR 3,50 (kl. Waesserchen), aber braucht ja nicht jeder ... ein ziemlich grosser Supermarkt ist nur ca. 50 Meter entfernt.
