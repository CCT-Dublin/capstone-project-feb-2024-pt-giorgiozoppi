222,Business trip,"I stayed for a business trip and I was pleasantly surprised. Firstly the 2 staff members I dealt with checking in and out were a pleasure to deal with. 
I stayed in a single room, whilst small it was clean and well equipped. 

The single bed was comfortable and there was a small desk that I could work from.  The shower in the bathroom was lovely and powerful and very spacious.  There was also air conditioning and tv channels. 

The location was lovely and I could not hear any noise from outside during the night. There is a bus stop directly outside and the DART is at Lansdowne Road and that’s less than 10 min walk. 

I could hear people coming in past my door but I think that was just the next room getting into the room. Overall the building and area were very clean and it was quiet during the night.",4,2024,10,17
222,"Perfect location, lovely hotel and staff.","I absolutely adored this hotel. The room was lovely, comfy and clean. The staff were very helpful and they even let me check in early since I arrived on an early flight from the US. The breakfast was delicious and the location was perfect. Just a short walk to city center and temple bar. I would absolutely stay here again!! As a solo female traveler, I also felt very safe walking and jogging around the area.",5,2024,10,16
222,Disappointing Service at Reception,"During our recent stay, we encountered significant issues with the service, particularly at the reception. Upon arrival, we were told to wait ""just a minute"" as the receptionist was on the phone. This wait extended beyond five minutes, which might have been tolerable had the receptionist handled the situation with politeness or professionalism. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
The receptionist displayed a lack of enthusiasm and a somewhat condescending demeanor throughout our interaction, which became noticeably worse after she checked my passport. As a Romanian couple who have traveled extensively for over 20 years without incident, we felt this treatment might have been influenced by our nationality.
Furthermore, the hotel's policy on room checks and deposit refunds was handled poorly. We were informed that our room would be checked ""in a few hours"" after our departure, and only then would we know if our €100 deposit would be returned. This is an outdated and inconvenient practice, as such inspections should rightly occur with the guest present to ensure transparency.
Overall, our experience was marred by the unprofessional attitude of the staff member at reception. I cannot recommend this hotel while such service standards are in place.",1,2024,10,12
222,Loved it!  We will be back,This hotel was lovely and in a great location. What makes it exceptional are the staff- they are amazingly kind. From the Breakfast hostess to the front desk staff - the service was top notch. We will be back and will definitely stay here. Eat the breakfast- it’s worth it.,5,2024,10,08
222,Practical stay,"Safe and secure location. 
Room was clean, comfortable, and had a fun vibe.  
Location was not too far out from the city centre.
Had a late check-in/early check-out so not much to comment on besides reception being very nice and professional. Would have liked to stay longer.",4,2024,09,28
222,Clean and peaceful spot in Dublin,"The room was well appointed, quiet, well lit, and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Continental breakfast for 8.5 euros was delicious. The location was a tad far from major attractions but a twenty minute walk to st Stephens. They arranged a cab for our flight home.",5,2024,09,28
222,Lovely hotel. Very comfortable,"Gem of a little hotel.  My room had everything I needed for my stay. Really comfortable bed in cosy room. Nice choice of teas and hot drinks in room.  Also had a fridge which is very handy. 
Really good value breakfast. All very fresh tasty fruit, yoghurts, bread.",5,2024,09,28
222,Very bad hotel,"We stayed here and had to pay a €100 deposit for damage which we knew about, but then when we left the hotel we were not refunded the €100 even though no damage was done. They complained about having tan on sheets and makeup on towels. They took the deposit off us before they had even washed the sheets. After we emailed, they then proceded to send us pictures of the washed sheets with the slightest bit of tan still left on them. As we all wear tan at home, we have never had tan left on sheets after being washed which shows they clearly didn’t put enough effort into washing them. One wash of the sheets in our own homes gets rid of all the tan so it really doesn’t make sense how there was still tan leftover on the sheets. We are all young girls who feel like we have been taken advantage of due to our age and we will definitely not be staying in this hotel again.",2,2024,09,23
222,"Convenient location but like a lot of dublin hotels , over priced for the room and experience received","Nice hotel, fairly convenient but over priced. S as Leo it would have been nice if receptionists had told me there was a sitting room I could use and also if they had been more friendly . It simply felt unwelcoming. Hardly a hello and no goodbye. Not what I expected",3,2024,09,22
222,Loved this accommodation,"Beautifully updated, modern accommodations in a Victorian lodging. They have kept the character of the building and the neighborhood while modernizing everything. Comfortable beds. Everything worked!  Nice continental breakfast.  Good location.",5,2024,09,21
222,Good location close to the center,"Lovely place in a good location. Walking distance to Temple district roughly 20 min. As an alternative there was a busstop right in fron of the entrance that brought you downtown for 2 €. 
The room was great. All well renovated with lot of care and with some nice details such as USB sticks in each powerplug and there were European sockets in the room as well. A Coffee machine and a water cooker was also available in the room. 
People were nice and helpful and there was a parking space for our car for 10 € and a nice and complete breakfast (only the eggs were missing) for € 8.50 / p available as well. 
We‘ll stay here again when we come back to Dublin. Thanks",5,2024,09,20
222,Great place in heart of Dublin,In a great location easy to walk to restaurants and attractions.  Close to the water and it was nice to walk around the area. Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Charming atmosphere. Was easy to make a reservation and staff was friendly and accommodating.,5,2024,09,18
222,Very good times there,Really good place and one interesting city. A very nice hotel. I wish I could have stayed more than 2 days there. I enjoyed the walks in the city and the life at night. I could go there again and again not only for work but to have fun and have a good time as a person.,5,2024,09,12
222,TRULY AMAZING STAY,"The executive suite was absolutely divine! Incredibly comfortable bed, wonderful jacuzzi, every possible amenity available. Truly one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in--at a shockingly reasonable price. The staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly, and Roxy the dog was an added bonus. 

The location was peaceful but central enough that I walked everywhere I wanted to go. If I'm ever back in Dublin, I know where I'm staying.",5,2024,09,11
222,Perfect for a Dublin stay at a reasonable price. Highly recommended,"This is such a lovely boutique hotel in Ballsbridge. Our room was very individually furnished with quirky tasteful decor. I loved the paintings and wall art - not too gaudy or OTT. Very comfortable and quiet which was surprising for a non purpose building. The room was warm with a good selection of in room refreshments. Loved the drinking water tap in the bathroom - very innovative. The television was a good size and at a decent height and there was a DVD player with a selection of DVDs - again very innovative. 
The hotel was reasonably priced for Ballsbridge and value for money. The location is very near the bus stop to and from Dublin airport (Aircoach 701), the centre of Dublin and the Aviva Stadium. 
We will definitely stay there on our next visit to Dublin.
Thank you a great experience.",5,2024,09,11
222,Great stay!,"The place was quiet, well located for us, very clean and the staff members were very friendly and helpful. The single beds we had in our triple room were narrow but everything that you needed was in the room. I would definitely stay again as it was a positive experience.",5,2024,09,02
222,Extremely disappointed,"Room was in what looked like a shed in the car park. Electric gate attached to wall of room was was loud and woke us up. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean with nice extras 
I excepted a hotel room in a hotel for over 300euro for one nite",2,2024,08,31
222,Very pleasant stay in small boutique hotel,"The room I stayed in was very clean and comfortable. It had everything I needed and it was very tastefully decorated. Good consideration had been given to the wants and needs of guests in the room such as placement and types of furniture, sockets and mirrors, lighting, heating controls etc. 
A minor niggle - the mini-fridge was empty but on, which caused noise during the night. It was not obvious if I should turn it off or how. Not a big deal but thought it worth mentioning.
I enjoyed my breakfast - especially the fruit with yoghurt and choices of cereals. Nice toast too. However, I do like eggs at breakfast - even if they are hard boiled (and placed along with the cold meats and cheeses). 
Service from the staff was great. I would definitely stay again.",5,2024,08,29
222,Great place to stay!,"Our room was outside of the main house.  Never stayed in this location before, but it worked out really well.   A lovely new fresh spacious room, really nicely decorated and with all the facilities you would need.  The staff in Roxford Lodge are really nice and so helpful.  The location is ideal if visiting Dublin.   Very quite, and bus stop across the road into the city centre.  Dart train service a short walk away in Lansdowne.   Also within walking distance of Aviva Stadium.",5,2024,08,25
222,Lovely peaceful stay,"This place was our haven in Dublin. It has a calm atmosphere and is well-situated for seeing the sights. We walked into town and found everything less than a 30 minute walk. Good price, lovely breakfast, and we slept well. Best shower in 3 weeks in Ireland.
Taking the Aircoach from DUB, it stops only minutes away, and it's easy to return to DUB from there also.",5,2024,08,14
222,Amazing hotel in Dublin !,"Аmazing hotel in the center of Dublin, friendly staff, perfect  jacuzzi and sauna in the suite, we were very pleased and had a great rest, this is the best suite in Dublin if you compare it with other hotels, stay there. Very convenient location, we also really enjoyed the varied breakfast , we will definitely come back again!!!",5,2024,08,13
222,Home away from home,"What a hidden gem of Dublin!
Great location (for those who don’t mind to walk a bit! 15’ walk to downtown), very cosy and charming rooms, generous buffet breakfast, but most of all,    excellent customer service. The hotel personnel (3 wonderful girls - Bel, Karolina and Claudia) is second to none - super friendly, attentive, well-informed and extremely helpful. That makes the stay at the hotel a truly unique experience - home away from home. Without hesitation, I would recommend the place to anyone, and hope to come back here again. Thank you!",5,2024,08,08
222,Perfect for a short stay in Dublin,"Lovely small hotel near the Aviva Stadium, was only staying a night in Dublin, but hotel was relatively central, well connected to the bus network and a short walk into the city centre. Room facilities were excellent and room looked wonderful.",5,2024,08,07
222,"This is your place if you want a quiet, restful place while in Dublin.","This is a wonderful place to stay.   It's in a quiet area of town surrounded by many embassies.   The rooms are very comfortable and clean.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.   We had breakfast there every morning.   it was not the traditional Irish breakfast but more than adequate - cereals, yogurt, toast, hard bolled eggs, juice, coffee and more.  We were looking for a quiet, relaxing hotel and this was it.   One other point.   It's a 10 minute walk to a Hertz rental office so we could take a cab or bus to the hotel when we arrived, pick up our car the next morning and when we were ready to fly home, we dropped the car the night before and took a cab to the airport early the next day.   You won't be disappointed.",5,2024,08,03
222,Great !,"Quiet hotel in a lovely residential area of Dublin. Great staff and welcome, bed super comfortable and well decorated room with all necessary items included. I was having a room in a detached area from the rest of the hotel which made everything even more special",5,2024,08,03
222,"Feeling at home, superb!","I loved this beautiful Victorian hotel. The staff was very friendly, kind and helpful. My room was cozy and comfortable with all the facilities I needed. As regards breakfast, it was very good. I will miss the lady in charge of the dining room, definitely. I really felt at home so it all contributed to a memorable stay in Dublin.",5,2024,08,01
222,Lovely Dublin Lodge,"We had a wonderful stay at Roxford Lodge.  The room was clean, practical and nicely decorated.  The staff very accomodating and helpful.  A real plus is availability of secured parking spaces on the property.  There are plenty of wonderful restaurants in the area as well.",5,2024,07,28
222,Perfect rooms and incredible staff!,"The room was gorgeous, immaculately clean and had everything you could possibly need. But I need to give immense credit to the staff, who were extremely accommodating and flexible when I found in a situation where my Airbnb cancelled minutes before I was due to check in to it. I regret not catching her name, but the woman on the front desk during the day on 27th & 28th July really went above and beyond. Thank you so much - and what a beautiful hidden gem of a hotel.",5,2024,07,28
222,Thrilled with my stay!,"I initially selected this hotel based almost entirely on location and cost, and was thrilled with my experience. After having spent the last week at a different hotel each night while on a tour, this was the nicest stay of my trip.  The bed was soft.  The bathroom was luxurious.  The lighting was ample and easy to work with.  The room was beautiful.  I didn't use it, but there was air conditioning AND heated bathroom floors if desired.  There was a mini-fridge. The only staff person I saw was professional, efficient, and very helpful.  I don't know what else positive I could say about my stay, it was outstanding!",5,2024,07,16
222,Another regular visit to  Roxford Lodge,"Roxford Lodge Hotel is our go to accommodation for overnight in Dublin.  
As in our previous reviews I cannot stress how accessible and convenient this boutique hotel is.  Comfortable,  clean  and with all the necessary facilities for our  overnight stays . Guaranteed a good nights rest.  Staff are always helpful,  polite and  welcoming.",5,2024,07,13
222,"Lovely stay, great, friendly atmosphere","Fantastic stay here on my second trip to Roxford Lodge. Staff were very friendly and helpful, beautiful newly decorated room which was exceptionally clean and had everything you'd need. Extensive and fresh continental breakfast. I will certainly be back again 😊",5,2024,07,08
222,Good Choice,"The Ballsbridge bus from the airport drops you just a few steps from this lovely hotel.
There are a few steps up to reception, but there is a lift once you are inside.
I had booked the small single, but was kindly upgraded to a double on arrival. There was a warm greeting on arrival, and the whole place is immaculately clean
The room not huge,  but otherwise superb with a double bed, safe, fridge, TV (with access to Netflix, YouTube, etc),  DVD player with DVDs, desk and hospitality tray. 
There was no noise from inside or out, and I slept well
The bathroom genuinely  looked like it had never been used it was so clean. 
The continental breakfast is beautifully  presented with lots of choice. There is a comfortable residents lounge behind reception.
The hotel is around 20 minutes walk to St Stephen's Green.  But there are busses, trains and trams nearby if you don't fancy the walk.  There are plenty of shops, bars and cafes in the immediate area,so you don't really need to walk into the city centre.
The staff is a credit to the hotel across the board - housekeeping, reception and breakfast.
Nothing not to like!",4,2024,07,06
222,Perfect place to stay!,"Everything was perfect. comfy bed, Lovely staff, all clean and nice. They also leave me some coffee and cookies! Totally worth it and will go again. Close to Aviva Stadium! And if you like to walk you could go to other nice places like trinity college in about 20 min.",5,2024,06,29
222,Lovely boutique hotel,This is a lovely boutique hotel.  We had a deluxe double room that was nicely furnished and extremely clean.  The room had all the conveniences that you would expect from a 4* or more hotel.  The breakfast was extremely good value and tasty.   I would definitely stay here again.  We also managed to get parking at the back of the htoel - they have about 8 or 9 spots and some EV spots.,5,2024,06,28
222,Great hotel in a quiet but convenient part of Dublin,"Very friendly, helpful staff.  Great breakfast each morning.   The rooms are sizable and the beds were very comfortable.  A nice cozy retreat in a quiet part of town.   The location is near restaurants.   It’s out of the extremely rowdy part of town and made for a good nights sleep.  Would definitely recommend it.",5,2024,06,28
222,Below a basic Premier Inn/Travelodge,"It's by a road but the noise levels weren't bad. 
I booked a solo room for two nights. It faced a car park and so I had to have curtains drawn for the whole time, not allowing light in. 
I'm not sure if the cleaners change the bedsheets with new guests, since before I went to sleep, noticed there was what looked like dried toothpaste on the duvet amongsy other marks. Bed was dipped and hard also and seemed pretty old.
I wanted to have a bath, and when I went to turn it off, the handle for it was loose and I couldn't turn it off properly. I went to reception and notified the woman behind the desk, who came over, tried to turn the water off herself and said that ""we didn't have this issue before"" to say that I broke it and so I had to defend myself and explain their plumbing system was the problem and felt accused. 
I stayed there for two nights and this happened on the first day I was there. No rooms to move into because of the broken plumbing, and no fix or notification from a manager or updates about what they would do to fix it. Pretty disappointing. 
Whilst using the shower the next day, there was some dirt that came out also, I thought was pretty disgusting and again, a bit of a concern with the cleanliness of the room. 
All in all, it wasn't cheap when I booked as it was a busy concert filled weekend, and for that price, I'd expect there to be some basic levels of both customer service and cleanliness. If you want to have a cheap stay on the off peak side of things, I would say for a night or two it's not hugely bad and I might have had a single bad experience.",2,2024,06,24
222,I would stay at this hotel again.,"The location was excellent; we managed to visit many places on foot. The bus stop is right in front of the hotel. The rooms are very neat and clean, and the beds are really comfortable. The staff is very friendly and will gladly assist you with any help you need. I would visit this hotel again!",5,2024,06,24
222,Excellent,"Fabulous hotel. Staff were extremely friendly. Hotel is spotless. Excellent location for public transport, 5 minute walk to train station. Bus stop right outside front door. And 10 minute walk to Aviva stadium. Don’t be mislead by small double, it was beautiful and plenty of room. Very tastefully decorated and comfortable bed xx",5,2024,06,21
222,Dublin business visit,"5/5
Very nice hotel . One of the best rooms I stayed in in a while. Very close to the docks and the city center about 30 min walking. On a main street so ordering a taxi or taking the bus is easy. I haven’t tried the food in the hotel but €8.50 for a continental breakfast is reasonable",5,2024,06,18
222,"Lovely spot, fully recommend!","Awesome little hotel in the heart of Dublin. Ideal for the Aviva/3Arena or anything in town really. Room was lovely, quite spacious and well-appointed with fridge and a Nespresso coffee maker. Lots of nice add-ons, including a  sauna in the bathroom. A great find and would have no probs booking again. We booked last-minute and got a superior room for €200 on a Friday night, with private parking. Staff were very friendly too!",5,2024,06,15
222,Perfect hotel,"This has been the best stay ever in Dublin, the rooms are so comfortable, the entire hotel is so clean and so beautifully decorated, the staff are so lovely and breakfast was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel, location is perfect. We attended a concert in 3 arena and it was within walking distance with lovely places to eat and drink along the way. The beds are so comfortable and it is so quiet",5,2024,06,15
222,Lovely and clean accommodations,We had a great stay at the Roxford! The accommodations were very clean and breakfast was good. The front desk clerks were very kind and helpful. I would recommend staying here. Close to the city center for walking to sites. We enjoyed our stay!,5,2024,06,13
222,Stunning,"Beautiful hotel. To have a sauna in the bathroom was a brilliant surprise 

Lots of parking which was needed as I was here in business

The staff were lovely and so accommodating

The hotel was in immaculate condition and the breakfast was so fresh and tasty",5,2024,06,11
222,Great experience - thank you,"It has been truly a remarkable stay at Roxford Lodge. Thanks to the whole team, the very clean, well-thought trough place and the delicious porridge for breakfast! Especially in Dublin, accommodations are expensive however at Roxford there is tremendous value for a reasonable price.",5,2024,06,09
222,Roxford hotel is superb,"Superb hotel in a lovely area. Great for Aviva stadium.
Staff were so helpful, particularly Belle on reception.
Rooms are newly furnished to a very high standard . I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin who wants to stay just outside the busy tourist area.",5,2024,06,06
222,Happy customer,Stayed here many times and always a pleasurable experience. Rooms always immaculate and staff always there to help you. On two times we stayed we were upgraded to better rooms at no extra cost. Facilities are top notch and it’s so close to the city centre.,5,2024,06,05
222,Just right.,"Updated, clean, and spacious room. Especially considering the location. Worked very well for our family of 4. Location nice, wish we would have had more time to explore the area. Downtown area is walkable and bus is available at the front walk although we didn’t use it.",5,2024,06,02
222,Very good,"Very nice room. Clean, comfy. Was nice to stay . Breakfast was good. ...Was more international then Irish. But also nice choice of cereals, pastries, coffee, yogurt, some fruits...................................................",5,2024,05,14
222,Charming hotel!,"A great hotel to stay in for the 1 night we were in Dublin. Clean, roomy, charming. We appreciated the coffee maker in room. The nearby pub with Indian food truck in parking lot was a hit!! We would stay here again! PS The front of building was easy to find but there is nowhere to park even temporarily while checking in, since it's a main road. We parked in a nearby neighborhood to check in, and then they directed us to parking in the rear, via an alley and a gate. Not a big deal but just be prepared.",5,2024,05,13
222,Great hotel for business trips,Lovely clean rooms and great location for what I needed. Rooms are comfortable and have everything you could need! I have stayed here a number of times and am always pleasantly surprised at the attentiveness of the staff and variety of rooms. On-site restaurant would be preferable but what’s on offer suits for what I need.,5,2024,05,07
222,"Fourth time coming here, always the best!","This is my fourth time staying at Roxford Lodge and my partner and I truly adore every times I fully think it deserves all the highest ratings as it is one of the best places to stay in Dublin. A stunningly reimagined home into a boutique hotel, it is extremely cleverly designed. Rooms and bedding are always beyond comfortable . We have had a different room every stay and they all have their own unique quirks. Can’t wait to come back.",4,2024,05,07
222,Exceeded expectations.,"Excellent stay and staff. Super clean, safe and quiet. Many thanks to Belen at the front desk and to the amazing lady at the breakfast area who happens to be the hotel owner. So much quality in one place this hotel will be my Hotel everytime i visit Dublin. 20 stars out of 10.  Thanks for the free upgrade as well. 
See you soon!",5,2024,05,05
222,"Great staff, lovely hotel","A superb hotel, and made better by a wonderful member of staff - Bel - who really went above and beyond to be helpful. I had some small requests and everything was handled with real ease and grace. My room was generous and comfortable and quiet, and everything was easy",5,2024,05,04
222,A quiet and very comfortable hotel in a good location,"We loved our stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel.  We had a very comfortable triple room, and we all slept well.  Plenty of plug points for us all, including different plug points for international travellers.  The room opened on to a little courtyard with table and chairs, where we enjoyed sitting outside as the weather was gorgeous when we were there.  We used buses to get around Dublin and appreciated having a bus stop right outside the hotel.  We also got the Aircoach to and from the airport, and the Aircoach  stop was only a short walk from the hotel.  Staff at Roxford Lodge were friendly and helpful.  We had the continental breakfast one morning which was excellent.  The only downside was that the fridge in our room did not seem to work - we meant to mention this to staff but forgot to do so in our rush to leave on our last morning.  All in all, we were extremely happy we chose to stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel and would be very happy to stay there again on any future visits to Dublin.",5,2024,04,30
222,Lovely hotel,"Hotel is tidy and beautiful, not noise at all.  Staff is polite and it is easy to walk to city centre. Nice place to stay! Breakfast was good enough: toast, croissants, yogurt, fruits, berries etc. I lived to be here and I would recommend this for everyone.",4,2024,04,21
222,Wonderful stay!,"Wonderful stay, comfortable beds, quiet. Slept so well. A bit south of the centre but walkable to everything (if you like to walk) or buses are right out front. Continental breakfast was nice - plentiful and delicious. Would stay here again for sure.",5,2024,04,21
222,Home away from home,"An absolute dream stay; bed and pillows made for a very comfortable two night stay. Spotless and the attention to detail was immaculate, had every little thing you may need during your stay. Belle assisted with a very smooth, and early check in, she was very helpful, informative and polite. Highly recommend, and very likely to return.",5,2024,04,11
222,We will return!,An excellent experience. The rooms are spotless and the decor is beautiful. We had a delicious breakfast which is great value. The on site parking is also a major advantage. The only reason for not awarding a 5 is the shower… it seemed to just have 2 settings - cold and extremely hot. I’m sure it could be easily remedied. It certainly wouldn’t put us off returning. Thank you.,4,2024,04,09
222,Nice hotel,"Hotel was lovely, great location, I attended a wedding close by and stayed here with my partner. My friends also stayed , they received a free upgrade which was good for them, I didn't and I was also charged a 100 euro deposit which was taken from my card, they weren't, I'm not sure why they weren't and I was it must be what ever humour staff are in.",3,2024,04,09
222,Exceptional place,"I booked this hotel about nine months ago for a trip to Ireland for Saint Patrick’s Day. We chose it because the price was reasonable and it was only about a mile from city center. The location turned out to be great. There’s a bus stop literally right outside the door and one block away is the stop for the aircoach to the airport.Its located in an affluent and safe neighborhood with several restaurants and pubs nearby, and is only a 15 minute walk to Aviva stadium. 
 Checkin was smooth and we were able to stow our bags. The room was impeccably clean . It was average size . The bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom excellent. We had daily room cleaning . There was a continental breakfast daily on site . All in all a tremendous experience for the cost .",5,2024,03,19
222,"Great Value for Money, would go back!","Lovely hotel, great value for money, secure parking (paid), fab location, perfect location for a quiet night after a busy day exploring the city, good pubs nearby. Parking is quite narrow and most spaces are for EV charging and there is a dog in a neighbouring building which does bark. Despite this would definitley be back, room was well worth the money with great facilities and location.",5,2024,03,12
222,Great location,"I traveled to Dublin with 2 other friends and stayed in a triple. The location of the hotel was very easy to walk around from, as we could use the main road to get to a lot of the tourist spots. The breakfast was good, and we thought our room was very spacious and comfortable. I also forgot something at the hotel, and they took the initiative to let me know that they found it instead of me realizing I had left it there once I got home. I would recommend staying here and would stay again!",5,2024,02,27
222,"Perfect hotel, in a great location!","This place is perfect! Easily accessible by the Aircoach from the airport, it drops off 1 minute down the road. There is also a bus stop right outside the door to get into the centre. 

We were given a free room upgrade which was great, the room was spotless! Staff very friendly, and the gentleman on reception when we left couldn't do enough to help. 

Excellent stay, good location, great hotel and staff. Thank you!",5,2024,02,27
222,Aparts with sauna top,"The room with a sauna and jacuzzi is awesome. I would love to visit these apartments again in the future.

I liked everything - the ceiling windows through which you could see the clear night sky and the moon, which could be closed to block out the daylight. I liked how the lights were installed in the room; the jacuzzi is quite spacious for two people, the sauna is top-notch, there's a small balcony in the room, and a decent Samsung with a flexible screen. Next to the jacuzzi, there's a small TV, and the jacuzzi with the sauna is slightly elevated above the main room level. It feels like the hotel owner designed it for themselves; everything was enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are no photos, I didn't have time for them😁",5,2024,02,24
222,"A beautiful, comfy experience and a lovely staff.","When I first arrived the staff were very welcoming and informed me on all the amenities available. They were lovely to talk to, and very polite. The room itself beautiful. The bed itself was so soft and comfortable. The only downside was trying to park to get in to be able to check in. Even that was sorted out smoothly.",5,2024,02,09

222,Nice stay in a good location,"Roxford Lodge is a lovely hotel in the Ballsbridge area.  Room amenities are plentiful: coffee/tea service, mini fridge, iron/ironing board, DVD player, even a golf umbrella.  If you need a hearty breakfast, you'll need to look elsewhere as only a continental breakfast is available - and if you go down to the breakfast room in the last hour, there will be very little. The beds were comfortable and water pressure in the shower was excellent.  Staff were kind, but not overly so, and after staying in a B&B nearby, Roxford felt a bit impersonal.  It's definitely a hotel feel rather than an inn.  Still, it's clean, well-located, and comfortable.",4,2024,01,03
222,"Quiet, spotless, beautiful, and comfortable.","Roxford Lodge Hotel was an exceptionally pleasant experience in every way. The rooms were spotless, beautiful, and very comfortable. Although it is in the center of Dublin close to most sites, it was quiet, and we slept soundly and undisturbed even though we went to bed early. The staff were always helpful and friendly. Agnes, the owner, sat with us on several mornings at breakfast fascinating us with information about Ireland history. Breakfasts were delicious and offered multiple options. Their brown bread was particularly scrumptious. We were so comfortable that after touring in the south and west, we returned to Roxford Lodge to stay for our last night in Ireland and were surprised with a free upgrade to a large, fabulous room. It was the most enjoyable lodging we experienced on our 11-day trip.
",5,2024,01,02

222,"Great location; great place to stay. Definitely recommend; we would stay here again. Great breakfast, reasonably priced.",Great location BUT some people will find the steps challenging (although staff will help with your luggage if you need help).  We arrived before check in and were invited to wait in the sitting area and given tea and biscuits (cookies) til our room was ready — a very pleasant welcome after a very long flight!  It was generally quiet although we could sometimes hear people talking in the hallway.  Our room wasn’t large (typical European room) but it was comfortable and pleasant.  The shower was wonderful and the towel warmer was a nice treat. It seemed to be a safe area. My sister thought the bed was very comfortable but it was a little harder than I like. The breakfast was great and reasonably priced. Staff was friendly and helpful. We were easily able to do hand laundry. We would definitely recommend and would happily stay here again.,5,2023,10,06

There is secure parking around the back of the property but you have to pay extra for it as there’s no on street parking. 
It’s a good 15-20 minute walk into Dublin but a pleasant walk and there are lots of shops, cafes and restaurants close by. The hotel does offer for an extra cost breakfast but we ate out.

I did constantly have to ask for refills for the coffee machine, but it was always a pleasure to request it from the front desk as they were so friendly and accommodating! If you are carrying a large piece of luggage, beware as they do not have an elevator upon arrival to maneuver your luggage from the street to the lobby, but they have one inside so when you leave, you can always go through their parking area. The neighbourhood is lovely. Lots of greenery and embassies, so it felt safe. I will DEFINITELY return!!!",5,2023,09,08
222,Great place,"Beautiful hotel in a great location near to Dublin Center. The place is spotlessly clean, the room is very well appointed with high quality fixtures and fittings. Staff were brilliant in assisting us with a very late check in. ",5,2023,09,02

Our room was modern, slept in great comfort with plenty of room. Roxford Lodge offers a huge selection for breakfast at a slight charge. We were blocks from seeing the best sites/museums and quality restaurants. We were not into shopping but headed out to explore. Car rental was a walk away!
I am highly recommending Roxford Lodge and Dublin to all who I talk about our trip. Thank you Rick Steves for your recommendation in your 2023 book.

222,Great quiet clean hotel,I stayed at this hotel with my family. It is a beautiful townhouse with rooms that are modern with high ceilings. The person at the front desk was very helpful and gave me information to park the car out back. It is about a 20 minute walk (all flat) to the tourist area of Dublin but the advantage is that the hotel is in a very quiet and peaceful area. There are also plenty of restaurants and pubs that are close without hordes of tourists.,5,2023,07,05
222,Great Start to Honeymoon Trip,"My husband and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for the start of our three week honeymoon through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  We were blown away with the service we received - from the front desk helping us navigate public transportation, explaining how to order a taxi and even helping my husband find the correct app to download (being from the U.S. we are used to other ride-share apps).  Our rooms were incredibly comfortable and if there were other guests in the room next to us, we never heard them.  We were both big fans of the drinking water tap in the bathroom which allowed us to fill up our water bottles every day before exploring Dublin.  We found the walkability from the Hotel to the City Centre very easy, but it is farther than some people may expect so keep that in mind.  That bring said, we see no need to have a car if you are staying in Dublin. ",5,2023,07,05

Rooms and bathroom were great, with all the amenities needed and a lot of towels.",5,2023,06,29

222,Quaint getaway in the city,"Our room (119) had very high ceilings and felt quite grand. It had all the amenities we needed, was located on a very beautiful & quiet street, and was  super walkable to other areas of the city. This hotel is located on the edge of the 4th district and is only a 20-30 minute walk to the heart of the 2nd district. After staying in loud city centers, it was so nice to have a quiet spot for rest.

I also really enjoyed the bathtub as it was really deep and perfect after a long day exploring. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely stay again if I return to Dublin.",5,2023,06,12

222,Silver wedding anniversary trip,"What a charming hotel, lovely staff, excellent standard of cleanliness, no noise from other rooms.
The hotel is away from the hustle of the city centre, but has many transport links a short stroll away, or you can have a  30 min walk to the city & take in the delightful St Stephens green along the way. The Lansdown road dart close by gets you access to the whole train network.
Would definitely stay here again.

222,Business Trip,"I returned to this hotel for the fourth time this year, I've had a different room every time and they never disappoint. The hotel is finished to a very high standard, the rooms are very comfortable and clean and well equipped, they have thought of everything even a few euro power points for international passengers.",5,2023,05,09
222,Wouldn't recommend,"I travelled to Dublin for a conference, staying at the Roxford for 5 days. It is in a nice neighbourhood, short walk into the city and close to shops/restaurants. That's where the positive ends. The hotel room was very small and cramped. I barely had enough space to open my carry on sized suitcase. Bed was a twin and hard as a rock. My room was extremely noisy - noise from passing cars, hotel workers shouting down the corridor, people walking up and down the stairs...I could even hear the couple above me having 'relations' at night. So bring ear plugs if you stay here or you won't get any sleep! 
Also, there are no 'do not disturb' hangers for the door. TWICE I told the housekeepers through the door that I didn't want the room cleaned and TWICE they still opened the door, walking in on me naked. This was extremely frustrating and could have been avoided had there been a DND doorknob hanger. 
Lastly, on my last day, the hotel room safe wouldn't open and the receptionist didn't know how to open it or where the master key was. Obv not her fault, but they should be trained on this. I ended up missing my bus because of waiting for them to get the safe open.
I definitely wouldn't stay here again or recommend it. ",2,2023,05,07
222,Cosy hotel in a quiet neighbourhood,Beautiful and cosy hotel in a quiet neighbourhood not far from city centre Dublin. Confortable room and bed with a terrace. All was very new. Continental breakfast was fantastic. Friendly and helpful staff. ,5,2023,05,02
222,"Quiet, quaint & clean","This was the first of our Ireland stays and we we stayed two nights.  Your hotel is lovely.  Our room was perfect.  We especially liked the heated towel rack & energy saving ' key ' enabling feature.  The bed was comfortable, the room and bathroom were good sized, very clean and quiet neighborhood.  Being off the main path was nice for us.  We had the continental breakfast both mornings.  It was delicious and very fresh.  Agnes, in the dining room is above accommodating.  We enjoyed speaking with her and she is a very nice person.  My brother in-law told her he was going to miss the porridge she made :)  
We used the nice sitting room ( behind the reception desk ) a few times.  It is comfortable and has ample seating.  

The clerks we encountered at the desk and gentleman who carried our luggage in from the curb were so helpful.  In the front reception area there is a scented oil or incense the odor is overwhelming.  I would throw this away because it is so strong, artificial and overpowering.  This is the only thing I would change, overall this is a great property and was a wonderful stay.",5,2023,05,01
222,Good Value for the Money ,This hotel was a good value for the money.  It was in an excellent location for touring Dublin.  All of the staff were helpful and friendly.  The room was exceptionally clean.  The breakfast was great. ,4,2023,04,23

222,Looking for comfy place you will home??? Here’s the place for you in the heart of Dublin!!!,"I got a free upgrade by surprised after a nasty evening experienced about my car! Thank you very much Roxford Lodge Hotel. Definitely a place that I can recommend and by far, this place is so good compared to other hotels I stayed. 

I thought it was only a tell tale when a taxi driver told me about this place. A comfy place that I felt I was home… Very good experienced between spacious room, good quality furniture, lovely staff (2 Receptionist - Eleonora) & another lady - sorry forgot her name), location wise, biscuits & tea, etc. A well recommended place for me for sure!!! Thanks again for the lovely stay I had…",5,2023,04,19
222,Great hotel in Dublin center,"Stayed here to go to gig in 3arena. Lovely hotel and very clean, well exceeded my expectations. Everything about it was great, gd bed, shower , air conditioning etc. Staff were welcoming and friendly too. Place is within good walking distance of everywhere in the centre of the city. Recommended!",5,2023,04,15
222,A Class Act,"My overriding impression of the Roxford Lodge Hotel was one of professionalism, hospitality, intelligence, deep consideration and good design. I felt they had literally thought of everything. Raining? Fine: beautiful umbrellas available on the porch. Afraid of slipping in the shower? Check out that rolled up non slip mat standing ready. Not sure the water is safe to drink? Well, there is a dedicated drinking water tap! My room was small and I thought it would be noisy as it was on the ground floor right beside the car park. Instead it was quiet and comfortable. Although it was small, it had a little lobby and a beautifully designed bathroom with a jacuzzi. Everything worked perfectly. Everything I needed was there, as if someone had anticipated every move from a traveler's point of view. There was a beautiful front room upstairs, which I didn't use in my three night stay but would have enjoyed very much if staying longer. Breakfast was superlative. Incredible value. Billed as a simple continental breakfast, it was far more than that. Again, everything one would possibly want in a breakfast was there, beautifully laid out, in a lovely room, with Agnes ensuring perfect satisfaction. The location of the hotel is unsurpassable, on quiet Northumberland Road but only 10 or 15 minutes walk from Stephens Green. There is a Dublin Bus stop right outside and t is also on an Aircoach route to the airport. When I arrived, I was tired and cranky. Carolina's professionalism and helpfulness transcended that. I was so impressed by the Roxford Lodge Hotel. There seemed to be such intelligence, thoughtfulness, ingenuity, kindness and taste at work throughout. Highly recommended.",5,2023,04,08
222,Highly recommended,"It was very clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. The beds were good as well. I think the price/quality ratio was very good. Overall, a very enjoyable and lovely stay that was above expectations. Would definitely come back.",5,2023,04,07
222,Cozy in Dublin,"This place is perfect!  The room I stayed in was a small bedroom with bath but had every amenity available.  The room and bathroom were super clean.  Coffee, tea and cookies were in the room as well as a hair dryer and tv.  The price was great also.  The bed was very comfortable and I heard no outside noise at all.  The reception desk was very polite and helpful.  Last night in Dublin was quite comfy.",5,2023,03,28
222,Very pleasant stay,"The service Is very accurate, the staff Is very kind and available for any information and necessity, bedroom and all the spaces are very clean. The breakfast Is really worth with fresh food and good coffee. Easy reachable by bus or foot from the city center.",5,2023,03,26
222,Would highly recommend this hotel.,"Very enjoyable stay, very professional and helpful staff. Clean, good facilities, pleasant communal spaces, very reasonably priced for the level of accommodation. Running out of nice things to say. 5 stars !!!!",5,2023,03,25
222,Beautiful room and kind staff,"Through no fault of the Hotel, booking.com essentially cancelled our hotel reservation which we found out on the day due to arrive. Daiana the hotel receptionist was very helpful and upgraded us to an executive suite which was superb and we was very well looked after.  They essentially helped us with whatever we needed and we really enjoyed our cosy stay. ",5,2023,03,24
222,Fantastic experience!,"The staff were extremely welcoming, and the room was nice and cozy. I loved that they also had a Nespresso coffee machine! Overall, I had a lovely time at the hotel, and would definitely recommend the place.",5,2023,03,22
222,Absolutely perfect,"Everything about this room was perfect. It is spacious, well decorated and with all the confort you need (huge tv, huge bed, blackout curtain, coffee machine, mini fridge, storage, nice bathroom, heater). 
The hotel itself is very clean, secure (parking as well) and the staff is very welcoming. 
Only 20min walking to the St Stephen Green and there is a bus stop near the hotel . ",5,2023,03,15
222,Really beautiful hotel,"Beautiful house and my room was very nice, too. Stylish interior and I really liked the fact that there was a kettle, a coffee-machine (incl coffee) and a fridge in the room. Another big plus: the bed was really comfy, I slept very well.
The hotel is located in a very nice area and the bus-stop is right in front of the house. You can get into the centre by bus in just a few minutes. If you walk it takes you about 10min to Merriot Square and about 20min to the centre with all the shops, restaurants etc.
The only negative point is that the walls are not very thick and you can hear the noise from other rooms. I only felt disturbed once, though, when someone in a room close to mine was up late and not very quiet. Apart from that it was a perfect stay.

PS: If you want to grab sth to eat, I can recommend Paulie's Pizza. It's only a few minutes away by foot and the pizza and salad are very nice.",5,2023,03,11
222,Hidden Gem,"Very nice hidden gem! The room was very clean and a nice place to stay for the night. Private parking behind the building is also really convenient. Comfy bed, good tv selection, in-room tea & espresso, and very quiet. We would love to stay here again if given the opportunity.",5,2023,03,10
222,Excellent Customer Service ,"Excellent experience from start to finish. Beautiful modern Accommodation. Well thought out room with coffee machine, fridge, etc. car parking facilities on site. Great location with Bar and Restaurant facilities close by. 20 min nice walk to GRAFTON street. Customer service and staff were excellent. ",5,2023,03,08
222,Week in Dublin,"Very pleasant stay in a double room with separate beds. Room was just right, clean with a small terrace. The lady serving breakfast is extremally kind, the hotel has a pleasant atmosphere and attentive service",5,2023,03,02
222,Lovely hotel in upscale Dublin,"Really loved my stay at the Roxford. Room was small and quiet, but well cleaned daily with riplenished tea, coffee, and cookies. I loved meeting up with Agnes (the owner) every morning in the breakfast room for a tad of Irish history and polite conversation. All the girls including Eleanora (from Italy) were very helpful, friendly, and nice. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I often at dinner at the Schoolhouse Gastrobar which was less than 5 minutes on foot, cozy and expensive, but always delicious.",5,2023,02,26
222,Perfect visit,"One night business stay at The Roxford Lodge Hotel. It couldn't be easier to reach via bus 4 or 7 from O'Connell St at €2.60. It's a nice 20 minute walk either. Stayed in a single room which was spotless and had everything I needed. I took a bath after a long busy day and had the best nights sleep, never heard a sound! 
Ideal for business and pleasure stays. Up early and couldn't make breakfast so can't comment. Staff were lovely too btw, very helpful.
Will stay again if needed.
Best regards.",5,2023,02,19
222,Concert visit,"Great value for money. Continental Breakfast was elaborate with several healthy options. Room was comfortable, clean and quiet and bathroom was spotless.
Staff at desk was helpful and friendly - strongly recommended",5,2023,02,19
222,A hidden gem in South Dublin,"We enjoyed a beautiful stay at this magnificently restored period hotel. The room was excellent, it even had a sauna. The staff were warm friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was fantastic, top quality food on offer for a very reasonable price. The location is ideal for visiting Dublin’s cultural area. We wanted to stay another night! We shall return, this was an unexpected treat for us.",5,2023,02,16
222,Amazing little find,"Stayed for one night-and left wishing I’d stayed longer, so instead I’ll plan a return! This was a busy weekend in the area with a six nations match down at the Aviva and Chris Brown at the 3arena, it’s fair to say I was expecting a lively night to match the great atmosphere around the city. The Roxford Lodge was peace and tranquility and I had a brilliant nights sleep. I had a refurbished single room at the front of the hotel and didn’t hear a thing from outside. The room genuinely had everything you could ever wish for-from temperature controlled underfloor heating in the bathroom, to an air conditioning unit in the bedroom, not forgetting the smart tv! As a female solo traveller I felt safe in the hotel and in the outside area on the walk back from the 3arena at 11:15 at night. Highly recommend this place to all.",5,2023,02,12
222,Recommend,Great service and friendly staff. Safe parking on the territory. Executive suite was ideal. Sauna and jacuzzi was just what we needed. Very spacious and overall perfect for a little getaway or any occasion. Reasonable price for the location .Definitely coming back!,5,2023,01,24
222,Romford Lodge Hotel,"I had a very pleasant one night stay in the Roxford Lodge Hotel.  The room was clean and very comfortable with a nice bathroom with jacuzzi bath and very good rainfall shower over it.
Continental breakfast for an extra €8.50 was very good with plenty of choice, including porridge.  The hotel is very well situated,  close to the Baggot St and Lansdowne Road areas and a short walk to Grand Canal Dock Dart Station.
Staff were very pleasant and professional  
Thank you!",5,2023,01,22
222,The perfect place to stay,"My partner and I checked in early and to our surprise and delight we were upgraded to a suite. 
The receptionist was friendly, informative and very helpful. 
We were gobsmacked when she showed us to our room (the suite spanned 3 levels) the bathroom facilities were beautiful with the biggest walk-in shower I have ever seen! We then went up some stairs onto the main level. The decor, lighting and art are beautiful - we had a huge bed, a seating area with a sofa, large coffee table and 2 stylish and comfortable chairs, a dressing table and an outside balcony. The balcony has a small bistro table and chairs with views of the Aviva Stadium. 
From the main level up a few more stairs, we discovered a corner jacuzzi bath with a television. 
Next to this was our own private sauna. 

The suite was beautifully decorated and we had ample storage and hangers for our clothes. The sumptuous towelling robes and slippers were a lovely touch. I really enjoyed having the option of the Nespresso machine or the kettle for hot drinks. 

There are many and varied eating establishments very near by and we had dinner in a beautiful Japanese restaurant (10 minute walk). 

The staff of this boutique hotel are so warm and helpful - we will definitely be booking to stay here again. 

Thank you for a wonderfully relaxing and luxurious stay

222,Second stay as good as my first in 2019,"My second time staying at this hotel. I liked that there was a fridge, a kettle and an extra blanket in wardrobe (which used to be taken for granted in hotels). Also, to my surprise there was a wee balcony and a sauna in the bathroom. Lovely and quiet too.",5,2022,11,17
222,Wonderful one night stay,"Excellent location for events at the Aviva Stadium 
Hotel is immaculately clean. Bed was very comfortable.  Secure car park at rear of hotel Receptionist was very welcoming and more than helpful. We will be returning.",5,2022,11,13
222,Fabulous hotel in the perfect location,"The rooms are beautiful, well appointed, extremely clean and very quiet. The hotel feels very secure, away from the noise of the city but incredibly close to all the sights. Easy bus line/stop in front of the hotel that is incredibly easy to use w/ google maps and takes you to every tourist sight. Don't bother renting a car. This is the only hotel I'll stay in while visiting Dublin.",5,2022,11,09
222,Lovely hotel in a beautiful part of Dublin - highly recommend ,"Stayed here for one night to attend a concert at the 3 Arena and loved it. The room was beautiful - clean, comfortable and welcoming. 
All the staff were very pleasant even providing a map guiding us to the arena.
The continental breakfast including freshly made porridge was delicious with plenty of choice and fresh tea and coffee.
Agnes was a  most welcoming host!
We would definitely stay here again.",4,2022,10,31
222,Wonderful,"The hotel had a very kind staff and I was warmly welcomed. It is located not far from city center and the access to public transport is easy. Regarding to the room, it was comfortable and clean. I totally recommend this hotel!",5,2022,10,31
222,Wonderful room,"Beautifully designed room - cozy and clean. Bathroom was very nice, a bit of a puzzle with flushing the toilet as there is no handle and the “push button” above shows no indication of what it does. Very nice shower as well. 
Perfect place to relax and get a great night’s sleep.",5,2022,10,27
222,Lovely stay!,"The room was beautiful, quaint and immaculate! We stayed here at the end of our 9 days touring Ireland.  We found our room to be wonderfully decorated and relaxing.  The bathroom was large, clean and appointed with a number of shower heads to relax and soothe as well as brightly lit with plenty of room to stash our stuff which isn't always the case. We ate dinner just a block away and had plenty of choices in doing so.  We spent some of our day shopping and visiting a local park.  We highly recommend the Roxford Lodge for your Dublin visit.",5,2022,10,16
222,Not modern,"I arrived at this hotel as part of a sheerings tour. The less said about sheerings the better. The hotel had an acessable room for me but it was quiet dark. The resturant was okay but we had our evening meal slung at us. Not sure what upset the staff but it wasnt nice. 
The food was okay. However the bnreakfast was awful. We were given(no choice) a sausage, a slice of bacon and a spoon full of horrible slimy wet scrambled egg. It was not edible.
The photos they show on their site do not reflect the soom I was in.",3,2022,10,16
222,"Rooms OK, but poor location","I'm not sure why I booked this...I guess it was the good reviews on another site.

The room itself was nice.

But getting anywhere was a 20 minute walk.  We actually had to drive to get to where we needed, which was another hassle/cost for parking.

Also, this was the first place we stayed (of 8 different hotels/B&B during our trip) that did not have any sort of in-room coffee/tea option.  Oh, and the Continental breakfast for $9 EU was a joke.

I dunno... if you're visiting for sites/downtown Dublin, then this may not be the place for you.",2,2022,10,13
222,Fabulous,"We stayed two nights and found the rooms clean, with plenty of room. Although we did not use it, it was a pleasant surprise to have a sauna in our room. Breakfast was very good. The desk staff were friendly and very helpful to us.  Although this is not a central location, there are good restaurants, a rental car office, a pharmacy, and a medical clinic nearby (all of which we used). We would stay again without hesitation!",5,2022,10,02
222,One night: very nice,"We spent a night there and it was very nice, clean, calm, comfortable. The fact that the room was very small was not a problem for us, since we wanted to spend time outside to visit Berlin. The staff was extremely nice. We recommend!",5,2022,10,01
222,Superb hospitality,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for 3 nights in September 2022. We arrived wearily after an overnight flight, at 10:00 am. While check-in is clearly stated to begin at 3 pm, the front desk provided us with complimentary tea and croissants in the front room while they readied a room of a guest who had checked out early. Not expected at all, but so appreciated. When it turned out later that our particular room was affected by some unexpected noise, the hotel staff again graciously accommodated our request for a room change the following day, and upgraded the room type as well. While the rooms could benefit from a little updating, the overall hospitality is reason enough to book a stay here. 

It appears that the lodge is owned  by a woman and has an all-female staff, which was nice to see. 

The location is excellent. It is situated in a lovely neighborhood that is within a 20-minute walk to Trinity College and City Center. In addition, we found some great places to eat breakfast and dinner within a 5-7 minute walk. 

Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2022,09,28
222,Lovely hotel and great location,"I had one night in Dublin and was shocked at how expensive it was, this was one of the cheaper options so I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong, it is a very luxurious room with lots of extra touches like a DVD player, waterfall shower and coffee maker. The location is handy. Maybe 20-30 mins walk to central Dublin and many buses. We also found a Wetherspoons 15 min walk away for cheap food options.",5,2022,09,28
222,Peaceful comfort in Dublin,"My boyfriend and I spent two relaxing nights in the Roxford Lodge Inn while touring Dublin on foot. The location is perfect by being close (mostly within 2 miles) of all the sites we desired, such as Trinity College with the Book of Kells, Jameson Bow Street Distillery and Guinness Storehouse.  The Roxford is also located close to a street of awesome restaurants. 
The staff are friendly, beyond helpful and the accommodations very clean and comfortable. Agnes was also very helpful each morning serving breakfast. 
Highly recommend and will stay again when in Dublin!",5,2022,09,25
222,Fantastic all round experience,We stayed two nights in the executive suite and had a wonderful time. The room had everything we needed plus a few extra touches which was great. The staff were brilliant and helped us with everything. Lovely breakfast with delicious coffee. Thank you all so much!,5,2022,09,24
222,Will absolutely stay here again!,"I was on my last leg home after a couple weeks of a work trip. I needed one night in Dublin and booked at Roxford Lodge Hotel. The place looked nice and reviews said it was located in a nice part of the city, so I figured why not. This place was absolutely lovely! I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice the room was, how cute the interior of the hotel was, the ""boutique hotel"" feel was great. Bed was comfortable, the room was fresh and clean, and I loved having a little morning coffee on the little shares patio off my room! 

Even though Roxford isn't located right near all the action, I felt safe walking the 30 minutes up to my dinner reservation and back again after a visit to Temple Bar.  Actually being away from the noisy downtown area was perfect as I needed to be up early for my flight. 

I will definitely be going back to Dublin in general. I didn't get to see much in just one evening, but when I do, I will definitely be staying here again.",5,2022,09,17
222,Comfortable Oasis Just Outside Dublin City Center,"Had a wonderful two night stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel. Everything about the experience exceeded my expectations. The front desk staff is welcoming, efficient, and responsive. Our room, 121, was on the small side, but the space in the room is well-organized. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the air conditioning was great! The bathroom amenities were plentiful and the entire room/bathroom was super clean. I might suggest a hook on the back of the bathroom door as there isn't anywhere to put toiletries or a robe. We opted for the continental breakfast which had ample choices and was enough for us. The breakfast room was well-kept and our toast was delicious! The WiFi reception was fine. The front door is always locked and there is a night porter as well. The location is excellent if you plan to attend an event at Aviva Stadium. The Landsdowne Road DART station is a short walk from the Lodge, and the AirCoach stop is just up the road a bit. Great location, great service, great stay. Highly recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel in Ballsbridge, Dublin.",5,2022,09,16
222,Cute and quaint hotel,"The hotel is quite charming and staff was nice. Breakfast is $8 euro. The location is in a residential area so no restaurants or activities nearby but it’s about a 15-20 min walk to temple street.  Metro bus is across the street. We only spent one night during a layover to see Dublin so if short on time, I’d suggest in town but it was super expensive so this hotel fits the bill.",5,2022,09,16
222,Comfortable and quiet in a nice area of Dublin,"The Roxford has very comfortable rooms and a very nice continental breakfast option. Rooms were very clean and well furnished, the area of town is an easy walk to Merrion Sq and the Museum area. We loved the quietness at night and nice local pubs and restaurants. The staff is very helpful.",5,2022,09,15
222,Wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, very cosy, kind and very helpful lady at the reception, clean, very nice rooms, good location, easy to get there by bus, quiet neighborhood. Breakfast evailable and not expensive. Iron in the room. Coffie and tea unit in the room.",5,2022,09,10
222,Lovely stay at the Roxford Lodge,"The hotel was beautiful, and in a nice neighborhood. We didn’t arrive until 2:30am, yet were given a warm welcome by staff, who showed us the ins & outs of our rooms. The room had every amenity that we could have wanted or needed. It was also very comfortable and cozy. The towel warmer dried my very wet clothes & denim
Jacket!",5,2022,09,09
222,"A very comfortable, pleasant experience","My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights.  I specifically asked for a “quiet” room, and it was pleasantly so.  The room was large enough that we could both move around at the same time, the AC was great, the room was set up for travelers, and the receptionists were all quite accommodating (when I requested more coffee pods).  The hotel is clean and well maintained.  It’s close to the city center, with shopping and dining options very near by.  Breakfast looked good, but we didn’t partake of it.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat, it was such a good experience.",5,2022,09,07
222,Lovely stay just out of the center,"We visited Dublin for two days, and had a great stay. Just out of the city center, it was quiet enough for a good night sleep, but close enough to walk to all the pubs and restaurants. We also enjoyed breakfast and the friendly staff was there to answer all our questions.",5,2022,09,05
222,Great spot to stay in Dublin,"Rockford Lodge was perfect for my stay in Dublin. It was a bit outside the city centre, but I enjoyed the peace and quiet of the area. There were bus stops conveniently located nearby including the airport shuttle stop just down the street. The room was perfect for a solo person and comfortable all around. The staff was amazingly helpful and accommodating. My flight was horribly delayed, and they made sure someone was available to let me in after hours.",5,2022,09,03
222,A great place to stay.,Great room. Comfy beds. Quiet location. Friendly staff.  We had a short 2 night stay in Dublin and enjoyed our stay at Roxford Lodge. Our teenage daughter loved her little area in the family room with its separate TV. Overall a great place to stay.,5,2022,08,23
222,What a gem in the heart of Dublin,"Just back from another great stay in the Roxford Lodge Hotel. What a great hotel.  Rooms are beautiful, everything very well maintained and clean. Staff are outstanding and so helpful. I can't wait to go back yet agon.",5,2022,08,21
222,10 out of 10 for this hotel would recommend to friends and family,"Wow !  What a fabulous hotel with all modern amenities. We had a fabulous triple room with balcony, super in this hot weather but with air con also. Perfect stay.
 Staff were all so lovely  and helpful. Car parking also available. Close to RDS, aviva stadium and city centre. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2022,08,21
222,Lovely,"The best hotel in Ballsbridge. 
Super nice and always very clean rooms. 
Small,  familiar and you wouldn't find any sweeter and helpful staff anywhere 👌
Has parking.  Ten minutes walk to the RDS and around the same to Aviva stadium.",5,2022,08,20
222,Updated and well run hotel in a quiet area!,"We loved our stay here for our family of four.  We had two rooms, which were both well maintained and updated.  Everything was sparkling clean and comfortable.  The beds were great and the air conditioning was a real treat!  The front desk personnel was also so helpful when we needed anything and forgiving of all our questions or forgetfulness.  We loved that you needed a code to get in/out of exterior doors which made the building even more secure.  A bus stop is also conveniently located directly in front of the hotel....a truly great trip here!",5,2022,08,07
222,Just wonderful!,"Fantastic experience. The room was so light and welcoming with tea and cookies, Netflix, and a huge shower!  The breakfast was delicious and the staff - especially Agnes- were so kind and helpful. I highly recommend this inn. My husband got sick, and the hotel told us where to go for care, called a cab and allowed us a late checkout.",5,2022,08,06
222,Perfect stay with super friendly staff!,"We had a great stay in Roxford Lodge Hotel, our room was situated in a private building on the parking of the hotel, as a result of which we had only one neighbour! It was a very quiet location, and close enough to the city center to go there by foot. A pleasant surprise: we had a little sauna cabine in our bathroom free to use! Coffee and tea amenities were present in the room, as well as airconditioning and good wifi. We've really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it! Moreover, plenty of good restaurants and cosy, authentic pubs within a 10-minute walk of the hotel. We did not take the continental breakfast, so I cannot say anything about that.",4,2022,08,06
222,Fanatic,"Booked the Roxford with my 24 year old son for a weekend , Was very pleasantly surprised  with the room very clean and all amenities you require . 
Beds very comfortable and the shower was fanatic .

would definitely book again .",5,2022,08,02
222,Roxford,"We had a pleasant stay at the Roxford at the beginning and end of our tour of Ireland. On the front end they worked hard to get us into our rooms early. The rooms are cozy and fitted out with all the modern conveniences! The staff was super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast wasn't served during our stay, but the continental was the best we saw in Ireland. Definitely a good place to stay in Dublin.",4,2022,07,30
222,"Beautiful, couldn't fault it in any way!!","Kind friendly staff, beautiful building, stylish bedrom, free choccy biscuits, lovely bathroom, spotlessly clean.  Bus stop right outside the front door.  We had a twin room downstairs at the back with big patio doors, no traffic noise at all, just perfect.  Honestly I couldn't think of a single thing they could improve.  Wonderful, thanks!",5,2022,07,26
222,Go somewhere else.,You must pay to park. Seriously! They charge 10 Euro a day to park. You can tell the owners are hard up for money by the way the place is latex out. They have so many rooms packed in this place it’s ridiculous. They did have AC which is why I gave them 2 stars not one.,2,2022,07,25
222,Lovely place to stay,"We are a family of 4 and stayed two nights in the family room. It was perfect, cosy and large enough for us all. Our children were stoked! The location is spot on, not in a super touristy area which we enjoyed, but close enough to walk to big attractions. Staff was friendly. Hotel was clean and charming. 
High Nellies right around the corner is fantastic.",5,2022,07,19
222,"Clean, quiet, convenient","The hotel is quiet, clean, and well maintained.  There is an elevator but there were a couple of stair steps between it and our room.  The location is a couple of short blocks farther out than some other properties, but not far enough out to discourage walking into downtown.  There is a bus stop right outside the door for those who don't want to walk.  The staff was especially friendly and helpful.  We were really charmed by the older woman running the breakfast room.  Note - the room had air conditioning that worked; we were there during a hot spell and this made a significant difference.  This is not the fault of the hotel, but the Dublin bus system web site makes it difficult to figure out which bus route to use to go downtown.  We used route 7 to go downtown and on to upper O'Connell street.  Then again, we could have asked the staff about the bus routes  (but didn't...).",5,2022,07,16
222,Highly Recommend for any Event at Aviva,"Stayed here for a concert. Couldn’t recommend more. So convenient to Aviva stadium (10 minute walk) in a quiet and safe location with a public transport stop right outside the door.

222,Great place to stay in Dublin,Roxford Lodge Hotel is comfortable and stylish with some querky design features.  Staff are always really helpful and welcoming.

222,A quiet stay close to city centre,"We thorughly enjoyed our stay at Roxford. The place was clean and tidy, quiet, yet not far away from the city centre.

Car park safe and convenient.",5,2022,06,14
222,Lovely small hotel,"We had a great stay here; the rooms are really lovely and it was in a quiet part of town about 25 minute walk from many of the top Dublin sights.

222,Wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed here for a couple of nights after first arriving and going back for three more when we leave.
Love this place.  The staff, including Sarah, Diana and Agnes (who takes care of us at breakfast) are all wonderful.  Our room is small, but totally modernized even with recepticals for power cords.  The bathroom is also totally new even with heat racks for towels.  A kettle and fridge round out the additions.
The location  couldn’t be better for touring Dublin on foot or public transport.  There is bus stop right at the front door!  The airport coach stop is one block away.
All this at a price which is much less than nearby hotels of similar quality.
We are returning!  In two weeks!",5,2022,05,22
222,Book this place you will not be disappointed,"Executive Suite was amazing! We stayed one night while in town for the rugby and cannot fault the room, the service or the location.
We didn't use the sauna but it looked fab, we did enjoy the rain shower and the hit tub though.
The bed was without doubt like sleeping on a cloud, wish I had checked what brand if mattress it was cause I need it for home!!
There was a nespresso machine and pods as well as normal tea/coffee and biscuits.
I would totally recommend this place as a little snippet of luxury to get away for a night or two.",5,2022,05,22

Staff very friendly and helpful.,5,2022,05,16
222,Show at Bord Gais,"Always loved the Roxford Lodge , hadn't stayed there for years as our ""location"" needs had changed. Its even better than we rememberd it, Leaves other hotels that we have been staying in Dublin City centre of late in the shade.",5,2022,05,15
222,Dublin Kickoff,"We arrived in Dublin early, and Roxford Lodge allowed us to store our luggage until a room was available. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we had a small problem, they allowed us to switch rooms. The room and lobby were quiet, clean, and comfortable. The breakfasts were delicious. There was a city bus that stopped in front of Roxford that ran directly to Trinity and the main tourist area.",5,2022,05,14
222,Top Class,Location is ideal  to city  center .we attended a gig  in the 3ARENA which only cost €12 by taxi from the Roxford Lodge Hotel. Reception  staff very welcoming and helpful. The room was spacious  with all full facilities  including a separate  drinking  water  tap  in the  bathroom .we stayed in room 135 which was located at the back of the hotel with separate  entrance but was very quiet  and safe.Having their own carpark was great as we didn't have to worry about getting  parked or getting  clamped. Highly recommend  this place and will certainly  come back again .,5,2022,05,13
222,Amazing,We wish we had more than one night here. It is a but out of the city center so plan for at least a 30 minute bus into the city.. The room had everything we needed and more!! They were also very kind and helped us book a taxi the night before our flight so that we would be on time. Highly recommend!!,5,2022,05,08

Comfortable adequate bed. 
Would recommend.",5,2022,05,01

222,Nice hotel in great location,"The hotel is very centrally located in the very pleasant area of Dublin 4 within 10 minutes walking distance from Merrion Square. There is also a bust stop directly in front of the door. 
Entrance and room were very clean and the room was very comfortable and nicely decorated. There are a kettle and a coffee machine, a DVD player with a small selection of movies in the room and additional continental sockets, what is a real plus. The bathroom was very clean and modern.
For Dublin standards fabulous value.",5,2022,04,14
222,Lovely lovely Roxford a Must,"This was my favorite stay in Dublin. It offered a luxurious breakfast with delicious soda bread, a full fry, and Irish yogurt with rubarb (yum!).  My room was spotless,modern and had nice design touches. The garden out front was inspiring as I started my walks into the city. I was able to walk to all the sights and have a relaxing spa bubble bath in my room. The owners and staff were kind and fun to talk to. I was able to use the car park - so important in Dublin. Hope I can visit again one day!",5,2022,03,28
222,"A pleasant, comfortable stay and we will certainly be returning!","The location was very convenient- it was our first time in Dublin and very easy to find our way around, plus there were bus stops both ways basically on the doorstep and places to eat nearby. We received a very warm welcome from the lovely receptionist on arrival and, even when the reception was vacant, upon being alerted, she made herself available straight away. We were very early so had a walk around town and I asked the hotel to let us know when the room was available, on the off chance that it was ready a bit earlier. They then called to let us know they’d managed to get it ready nearly 3 hours early at no extra cost! This was such a relief as we had travelled for a long time and were desperate for a nap before attending a concert. The room had a lot of character and everything was in working order. I love that there was an nespresso machine and some DVDs for us to watch. We didn’t get around to using it but the bath tub also had jets and the complimentary soaps smelled so good. A very pleasant and comfortable experience and we will certainly be returning!",5,2022,03,28
222,A surprise gem,"Beautiful hotel, spotlessly clean, parking for electric car with chargers. Room was beautifully decorated and comfortable, the bathroom had rain shower head in a bath.

Walkable distance to 3 arena, approx 30mins.",5,2022,03,27
222,Quaint clean hotel,"This hotel was perfect for a one night stay while we sorted some travel issues out with the embassy. The receptionist was very kind and the room was cute, clean, and had lots of light. The bathtub and shower were the greatest part though. I did not expect such a large bathtub and jets! I would definitely come back here.",5,2022,03,24
222,Stay during St Patrick’s weekend,"I’d like to leave here our good impression about the hotel, which is absolutely lovely and cosy, the staff is very nice and friendly, the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well equipped, we loved the weekend spent there during St Patrick’s weekend and for sure I’ll stay at Roxford again in my next visit!",5,2022,03,23

222,Luxury Feel in Small Package,"Cannot say enough good things about the quality of design, fittings, furniture, modern tech built in, bathrooms.   Just perfect to my taste.  this is topped off by staff.  I stayed twice and met the three receptionist several times. 
warm, friendly and helpful as were the two ladies running the breakfast room.  Super high quality food ingrediants. I am devoted fan of Bewleys and on Dublin visits am usually there for breakfast due to its high quality. Roxboro cooked breakfast is better (and less expensive).   The room design and quality are so good you sort of forget that the room is tiny.",5,2022,03,06
222,Really enjoyed my stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel.,"The hotel is located in a very nice neighbourhood in Dublin but close to the city centre. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel, perfect! 
The hotel have been renovated for not so long time ago, super nice and comfortable room. I stayed in a smaller room with a single bed (one night) but the room was fantastic, very nice bathroom with bathtub. TV, WiFi, Kettle, fridge, coffee/tea etc. 
I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,03,01

222,Lovely stay at the Roxford lodge,"Very happy with our stay in the Roxford Lodge. I was there for one night with my daughter. Everything went smoothly from check-in to checkout. Our bedroom was very nice and spotless, also well equipped ( smart TV with many apps to choose from,  coffee, tea etc). We were lucky to get a parking space in the hotel's car park which was so handy considering there is no parking outside the hotel.",5,2022,02,22
222,Really enjoyed the stay at Roxford Lodge hotel!,"We had a 3person room with a rain shower and jacuzzi, the room was just lovely. Every day, the room was very clean and really comfortable! We had a flight delay so we came there around 23:00h, but they were really kind and made sure we had a warm welcome.

The location of the hotel is close to the center of Dublin, really walkable (note: it is around a 20-minute walk). We walked all the time, but if we wanted it, there was a bus station next to the hotel, so you can also get there by public transport.

Overall we had a nice stay at Roxford Lodge hotel, I would definitely recommend it! If we are going back to Dublin, we are going to book this hotel again.",5,2022,02,22
222,Would definitely recommend,"Excellent place to stay, very close to the centre of Dublin. It was spotlessly clean, extremely comfortable, warm and quiet, even though it was a fairly busy road. The staff were very friendly, I would definitely recommend this accommodation.",5,2022,02,16
222,Lovely stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel,"We had a small double room for a week and although it was small, it really was just perfect. All of the amenities were included such as a kettle, nespresso coffee machine and coffee, hair drier, ironing board, shampoos, shower gels etc. Cleaning service had done a great job every day, and the ladies at the front desk were really lovely and helpful! They started serving breakfast again seeing as they renovated the place (16€ for Irish, 8,5€ for continental) but we have not had the chance to try it.",5,2022,02,13
222,Lovely place to stay,"Very pleasant, spotlessly clean and friendly accommodation in a good location. 
Arrived early, well before check in but we received a warm, friendly welcome with a willingness to store our bags.
The friendliness extended to every interaction we had with staff throughout the weekend. 
Rooms were comfortable with everything we needed for our stay. 
Good choice of a tasty breakfast was available the following morning too if you choose. 
I’ll look at this again next time I visit Dublin for sure.",4,2022,02,13
222,Rugby stay gem!,I didn’t want to review this hotel because I feel like it’s a hidden gem for any Ireland rugby fan. I really would rather keep this one a secret.  Little touches in the rooms which are cosy and perfect make it a five star for me. Less than 10 mins from Lansdowne stadium. Can not fault it!,5,2022,02,06
222,Lovely stay,Hotel very accommodating. Lovely staff. Room a bit squashed only complaint. Bathroom very tight. Room probably suitable for just one person. Nice touch having Nespresso and biscuits etc on offer. Would stay again,4,2022,01,31
222,Great weekend,"Well spent weekend in Dublin. Quiet, warm and comfortable hotel, with very attentive and friendly employees. We really liked the pressure of the shower water, having Netflix on television and Wi-Fi being fast. The only thing we improved was the size of the bed.",4,2022,01,30
222,Roxford lodge,"Stayed for 3 nights ok price but no breakfast included. 
Room could of been bigger but amazing views an amenities 
EXCEPT FOR PARKING WICH WAS NONE THE FIRST NIGHT
SO HAD TO PAY FOR STREET PARKING AROUND  THE CORNER ON MAIN ROAD ..the other 2 nights my partner was in work so barely even parked and when checking out the receptionists tried to say we owed an extra 30 euro for parking !! 10 euro a night refused to pay as barely even used it and was never mentioned untill leaving other than that was good",4,2022,01,18

I think it should have at least 4 stars!",5,2021,12,30
222,Gorgeous hotel with wonderful staff,"Roxford will be my first choice for future visits to Dublin. A beautiful hotel with the most friendly, warm and welcoming staff. The facilities are excellent with tasteful and subtle attention to detail - filter water eliminating need for plastic bottle waste, Nespresso coffee machine, a real iron, and air conditioning/temperature control in each room. The staff were genuine and helpful. Top of the list of my stays in Dublin so far and definitely recommend.",5,2021,12,18
222,Nice stay in Dublin,"Very Nice stay! Comfortable rooms with good temperature control and “EU” electricity possibility. Also USB sockets. Breakfast was not available due to rebuilding, so cannot comment. Low pressure shower and hard to regulate temperature, but not a big problem. Nicely fitted bathroom.",4,2021,12,15
222,Quick city break,"Well located,  very clean with friendly staff hotel.
Room was cleaned every day, TV was working very well and in the cabinet we could find some treats to start our day in a sweet way. I have to admit that this place deserves for more than 3 stars - it was really amazing stay.",5,2021,12,12
222,Perfect. Absolutely perfect.,"From the minute we arrived at 7.00am we were made to feel absolutely welcome. Obviously at that time our rooms were not ready but the charming lady on reception made us a pot of tea and let us relax in the very comfy lounge. She also went out of her way to let us have our rooms as soon as possible. The rooms themselves were fantastic. It’s also the perfect location for exploring Dublin central. 
I would 100% stay there again. Thank you.",5,2021,12,09

Special mention to the nice staff. Always helpful. Also to the cleaners who cleant the room everyday. Very much appreciated.

Thanks for all

222,Better than expected,"The room was beautifully decorated; everything was finished to a very high standard and the spec of the furniture and TV were way beyond the standard of a hotel charging similar prices in the area. 

The room included added extras such as a nespresso machine and a selection of 10 or so DVDs to use. 

The staff were lovely, very accommodating and Covid-considerate too.",5,2021,11,16
222,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent spacious accommodation. Rooms /  bathrooms very modern. Also Reception staff were very helpful. Car park at rear of hotel is very convenient. Great location for matches at the Aviva Stadium, and only a 20 minute walk into the city centre.",5,2021,11,14
222,Great  Location for Aviva Rugby Trip.,"Not sure why I never came across this place before. Stay regularly in Dub, mostly for rugby games either in the Aviva or RDS. Came across the Roxford Lodge this time on a Trivago search.  It was just what we needed. Reasonably priced, with (limited) parking  to its rear and only a short 15-20 minute walk to the Aviva!   And had the bonus of a great watering hole, the Beggars Bush pub,  only a few minutes away too. 
We got a room facing onto Northumberland Road- the best place to get a room. Others at the back have views of the car park. Plenty of room, with a very comfy double bed and a very modern ensuite made for a pleasant stay. No breakfast available  at present as they seem to be rebuilding their dining area at present, with the knock on effect of reducing the parking spaces at the rear to around 10, so get there early if you want one.
 The receptionist requests a copy of some photo ID when you arrive- very European. Make sure you get it back from them though. I had an issue where I thought I hadn't been given my driving licence back. I went back to check in reception. They didn't have it, but they did have a licence belonging to another guest ! Luckily I found my licence, so not the receptionists fault. But just watch for that one.
Would definitely use the Roxford Lodge again. Not too fancy but ideal for our wants.",4,2021,11,11
222,3 nights in Dublin,"The room was very small for the money and considering the location.  The room was however comfortable, with a comfy bed and a nice shower which are the most important things.

If it had either been closer to town or a bigger room, I'd have said it was better value. I think though it was expensive for it's location and room size. Our room was not shown in pictures on the website probably as it was the smallest and had a mis match of furniture.

It is close enough to the centre that you can walk in 30 mins or get a bus from right outside the hotel for 3 euro each.",3,2021,11,01
222,Beautiful Hotel,I loved my stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel. The hotel is very beautiful and quite close to the city centre. The room was clean and had a spacious bed. I loved that there was a coffee machine and a kettle in the room.,5,2021,10,18
222,1 night in Rexford Lodge Hotel,"Everything was delightful! We really enjoyed our stay. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind. 
Just a 30 min walk to the city center and located in a beautiful neighbourhood. Totally recommend staying in this beautiful hotel if you're visiting Dublin.",5,2021,10,17
222,Close to the centre,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel as it's close enough to Grafton Street to walk but far enough not to have the crowds, noise or constant beggars!

I loved having the coffee machine, kettle and fridge so I could make my drinks without leaving the room.

The only thing I would say is that as the room is just opposite the car park, people tend to smoke outside the room so the room always smelled of cigarettes!  The cleaner tends to leave a window open so the smell gets into the room, which I hate. I would recommend to the hotel to put something scented to override the cigarette smell.",4,2021,10,13
222,Superb and Great Location,"A real treasure in the heart of Dublin. Beautiful and well equipped room in a beautiful building. Wonderful service by the excellent Diana on check in and check out.

222,Fabulous!,"The Roxford Lodge is really a hidden gem. Close to the city but yet in a safe and quiet location. Onsite parking was spacious and safe.

Really reasonably priced as well. Will definitely go back!.",5,2021,10,11
222,Would greatly recommend this hotel to friend's and family ,Myself and my boyfriend stayed in roxford lodge lastnight and we had the best night. When we arrived we were upgraded rooms as their was availability and the room was gorgeous. So clean and bed was so comfortable. They allowed later check our free of charge.

Selection of alcohol available and will be delivered to your room. 
Within walking distance of 2 Dart stations
On check out they took my suitcase for the few hours I would be spending in the city centre 
Which I was very grateful for. 
I can't wait to return again! 
Thank you for a relaxing stay ",5,2021,10,03
222,Lovely unexpected stay,This is such a lovely hotel. I wasn't sure what to expect and it went above my expectations. The sauna was a nice surprise. The room was beautiful and really clean. I would highly recommend staying here.,5,2021,10,02
222,Hidden gem,"Have worked 5 minutes from this hotel for 15 years and never knew it existed till recently, thankfully because of trip advisor I found it. We stayed in the executive suite and it's exactly like the pictures, nicest room we have ever stayed in. Well worth treating your other half to a special night away. Staff were all very friendly and very quick to bring drinks to room. Not your normal hotel but perfect for a romantic night away with lots of bars restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Will be coming back.",5,2021,10,02
222,"Lovey stay, would highly recommend","The room was spacious & modern decor, they had nice little touches such as a DVD player and dvds, Nespresso machine, iron, umbrella, hair dryer, toiletries, courtyard balcony etc! The overnight stay was quiet and the bed comfy, I would definitely stay again",5,2021,10,01
222,Highly Recommend,Dercy was extremely friendly and very helpful lady which was a positive start to my stay ..... Room was spacious and enjoyed a wonderful night's sleep.... Wished I could have stayed in bed next morning!. Great location within walking distance of city centre .... with bonus of car park on site. Room rate was reasonable ...... no breakfast available but lots of places nearby to dine out. Definitely will be back next time . Thanks for a wonderful stay in the city :),5,2021,09,21
222,What a nice surprise!,"A cosy hotel in a nice neighbourhood with the friendliest personnel ever! They did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. We even got a birthdaycard and birthdaycake for my husband's birthday.
Very good beds, quiet and rather big room and - as an extra bonus - a sauna!",5,2021,09,15
222,Pleasant stay,"Very nice, clean and quiet hotel near the city centre of Dublin. Our room was cleaned every day. In the room, there was a coffee machine with new fillings every day. Pleasant surprise was a 'jacuzzi' in the bath. There is also a bus stop right in front of the hotel. You can take the bus and easily get to the centre. Fridge was not freezing at all though, so we coudn't store our food. There was also a nonstandardly short bed. Although I would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels to Dublin.",4,2021,09,14
222,"Usefully placed, but needs parking instructions","We stayed twice, at the beginning and end of our holiday, as the hotel is very well placed for the ferry. Both our rooms were extremely well furnished, quite opulent in fact, very comfortable and reasonably priced. On the down side, I received the same automatic email at least ten times, which contained a very oddly phrased section about what would happen if you vomit 'and do not do it in the toilet'! Is this really necessary? It made us wonder what sort of place it was if it needed to specify this! Surely it would be better to say ' If guests do not leave the room in an acceptable condition, a fine will be payable', or something similar?
The major problem was over parking. Despite so many emails, we did not see any mention of where to park, so assumed it would be obvious on arrival. It was not - there is no indication that parking is round the back, and we approached on the wrong side of the hotel, very tired after a day's driving, and got lost in Dublin trying to find somewhere to turn round in heavy traffic. There was nowhere to pull in so that we could go inside and ask. Finally a passing guest directed us, where we found locked electric gates. It made for a very stressful start to the holiday. This information should be sent with every email, so that guests know to turn in before the hotel, and to expect to ask for a code at the gates. 
The other problem was that we were charged ten euros for parking on our second visit - again there is no mention of this in the email, and it was a shock as we had not been charged anything on our first visit.",4,2021,09,10
222,Very nice hotel,"I had a good experience wuth Roxford Lodge Hotel
The girls at reception are very hepful , always with a smile and a nice word for you
The whole place is very clean, quiet
Big size bed,

And the bus stop is at the front door, very convenient to go either way, towards city centre or towards Dun Laoghaire and the coast",5,2021,08,29
222,Superb stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel in Dublin,Everything was perfect during my stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel in Dublin. The service was very friendly and helpful. The room was super clean and well equipped. The location was also perfect as the hotel is centrally located but still not in the touristy city center. I will definitely be back at the Roxford Lodge Hotel next time!,5,2021,08,26
222,Overnight family stay,Room was setup to allow for family of 4 - great facilities in the room which included a jacuzzi and sauna.  TV provided netflix etc.. which was good as the TV channels were limited.  Parking was available but limited as only 8 car spaces.,4,2021,08,23
222,Gem of a place,"Regular visitors to this fantastic Hotel. Staff are excellent, rooms are spotless and location is top class. Parking and plug in facilities for EVs are a bonus. Great eating establishments in the locality, particularly the Press Cafe.  Great stay all round. Looking forward to return visit.",5,2021,08,18
222,Single night visit,"Interior is dated, bathrooms a bit grubby.

 Bedding was quite clean and comfortable, however two single beds were pushed together rather than getting a double bed.

You should note that parking is not free, you must pay extra to park your car on the grounds of the building.",3,2021,08,12
222,Great place to stay,"Very nice room and shower room! Staff were friendly. Everything was clean. It's in a perfect location - about a 10 minute walk away from Grand Canal Docks and the DART station there.

Overall, a great place and I definitely intend to stay there again at some point.",5,2021,08,07
222,Highly recommend,We have stayed in the executive suite before and wanted to return as it is a fantastic room for a family. On arrival we were were very pleasantly surprised at the beautiful renovation the hotel has done and will definitely be returning again. Great location and friendly staff.,5,2021,08,07
222,Beautiful room,"Very happy to get upgrade - beautiful big room :)
Quiet, tastefully designed, proximity to city centre plus bath! Staff are very friendly and helpful. Always enjoy my stay in Roxford Lodge hotel. Thanks!",5,2021,08,03
222,Quirky in a good way,"The highlight of our trip was that we were upgraded to a room with sauna. This was a very nice touch, especially because it was my wife's birthday.
The girl at reception was very courteous and pleasant to talk to.

We really enjoyed our stay as we found the place really interesting, the room even had a nespresso machine which I really enjoyed. My wife enjoyed a hot chocolate. 

The bed mattress was at least a king size and we got great sleep.

The room also has a safe and a cooler where you can keep your water/drink chilled, and a/c. The bathtub fits two. The sauna has blue tooth speakers so you can playback your own 'spa' music.

Overall we loved the quirkiness, cleanliness and politeness we encountered.

Pluses for business travel:

Overnight parking available.

The US Consulate is within less than 10 minutes walking distance.

Also you can find very good restaurants nearby too.

We will stay again.",5,2021,08,03
222,"Good location, good service but pity about the handling of a disruptive guest","It's well kept, clean and in a good location and with the bonus of the carpark. Dining couldn't be open due to the restrictions so can't comment on that. However, the big disappointment was how a pair that were staying in one of the room caused chaos and disrupted a good nights sleep. A young lad decided to have a party in his room with the music thumping and blaring away after 10.30pm on a Monday night. After waiting to see if the noise would be stopped I rang reception. The person on reception said he'd handle it. 20 mins later the music was still reverberating through my ceiling. I decided to go to reception. The person on reception said he'd try again to stop the music. I had the misfortune then of witnessing a whole lot of fracas with the owner then furiously rapping at the door and then a shouting match between the rude lad and the owner ensued. Threats flying everywhere. Quite disturbing to watch. Thought it'd get physical. Then eventually the owner stormed off and left myself and a few guests just flabbergasted saying nothing to us about the disturbance or no apology. Not nice and I think the whole situation could have been handled better and the upset at least acknowledged to the other guests who were woken. The embarrassing thing was I had a foreign business colleague staying in the next room and he must have thought he was in a fairly rough place I booked. You can't vet every guest and these things happen but I think tempers got the better of the two arguing people. Pity really. Not sure I'll return again.",3,2021,07,27
222,Lovely stay,"Lovely stay. Comfortable bedroom with a balcony, impeccably clean. Lovely friendly staff. We intend to make this our base in Dublin, from now on. The location is fantastic, a short walk into town and the canal around the corner. Looking forward to the breakfast room reopening!",5,2021,07,26
222,Great Stay,"The hotel is in one of the best areas in Dublin and very well located close to many amenities as well as public transport options.

222,Short Stay,"Great  location, close to Aviva, and only a short walk to town.  The room was very spacious, clean and tidy.  Great facilities in the room, even a few DVD's, and tea cakes with your tea/coffee.  Staff were welcoming and helpful.  Sauna was fab.  Definitely stay here again. ",5,2021,07,11
222,Recommended hotel in Dublin,Renovated building transformed into a boutique hotel. Everything in the room is high class.  The location is very good and the staff very helpful. I would say that the hotel deserves more than three stars.,5,2021,07,08

222,"Very enjoyable, beautiful hotel","Beautiful hotel, the rooms are fantastic, really nicely decorated and very clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking located at the back of the hotel. It is a great location for restaurants and bars if you want something outside City Centre. Aviva Stadium is a 3-4 minute walk away.",5,2021,07,02
222,Home away from home,"As always, the rooms are cozy, clean, comfortable, quiet and the place is convenient and near city center but without the noise! Like a home away from home.  I definitely recommend this place if you want a good night sleep. Staff are ever so helpful.",5,2021,06,23
222,Impressively clean and comfortable,"My husband and I overnighted at the Roxford Lodge for one night on a Saturday. Diana at reception was lovely and the room was super clean, a quality I greatly value in overnight accommodation. We had a good night’s sleep on the comfortable bed. The location was handy for our doings in Dublin. We didn’t avail of the on-site parking as there was free parking on a Sunday on nearby St Mary’s Road. We had some difficulty figuring out the heating/cooling system, which we didn’t flag with staff when we arrived back late at night or when checking out. Perhaps a simple visual guide to working the system would be handy. We’d happily stay there again and are appreciative of the cleaning staff’s due diligence!",4,2021,06,14
222,Amazing,"We stayed in the executive suite room which was absolutely amazing, the room was spotless, staff were super friendly. Love the jacuzzi and sauna in the room. Overall great experience would definitely stay again!",4,2021,01,04
222,A hidden gem,"The rooms in the roxford Lodge were fantastic. Spotlessly clean and modern. They really thought of everything. from the coffee maker to umbrellas in the wardrobe which was a lovely touch. 
The bathroom was really nice with an amazing shower.

Will 100% return.",5,2020,12,21

222,Well needed,My partner is an essential worker we only stayed one night but can honestly say it’s the Nicest hotel I have stayed In. The location is perfect and has a little car park out the back. The ladies on reception were lovely too ... we can’t wait to go back.,5,2020,10,31
222,Review,"Me my boyfriend and our baby stayed here for 3 nights. The front staff are so nice,straight on hand if you need anything. The receptionist both last night and this morning wore lovely and poilet. I use lots of different hotels around dublin this hotel was not what I was expecting it was absolutely spot on I couldn't fault anything. Definitely my new go to spot and I won't be visiting and new hotels any time soon. Well worth the price thank yous so much for your service see yous very shortly 😊",5,2020,10,17
222,Given a basic room in a separate (fairly ugly) building.,I was really disappointed with my stay in this hotel. We were brought through the hotel to a shed-like building (pictured) at the bottom of the carpark. There are no photos of this building on the hotel's website so I assumed that we'd be staying in the hotel. Our room was not what I was expecting - thin walls and bars in the window (also pictured). I didn't ask to change rooms  because I didn't want to kick up a fuss during Covid. But I had gone out of my way to book a superior twin room and this was not what I would consider a superior room.  So I would warn anyone thinking of booking this hotel to confirm that your room will be IN the main hotel building.,2,2020,10,12
222,Best small hotel in dublin,"Stayed here again for the first time since February.  This is the best small hotel in dublin by a long way, and its better now!! Newly refurbed rooms are brilliant, and stylish. Only made a great stay better. Highly recommend. ",5,2020,10,12
222,Highly Recommend,"I booked a Twin Room we got a Queen size bed and a Single bed, 2 TVs, a DVD Player, and  DVDs , table 2 chairs, Jacuzzi in Bath, a Powerful shower, drinking water on tap, a heated towel rail, Lovely Room lovely lighting

222,Best Hotel in Dublin ,"I work in Dublin Monday to Friday and have stayed in most of the hotels in or around Dublin 4. I discovered the Roxford Lodge  just over a year ago and I haven't stayed anywhere else since. The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable plus the staff are friendly and accommodating. It feels like my second home.",5,2020,10,06
222,"Amazing staff, great room","I spend more than two weeks in this hotel. The staff have been extremely nice and helpful. When I was leaving, I was quite emotional, more than when I was moving out from my parents many years ago! Joking aside, I strongly recommend this accommodation.
The breakfast is lovely, fresh and more than complete for a great price. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The rooms have Jacuzzi and one some even SAUNA! Yes, inside the room! (I changed the room during my stay as I preferred a bigger room and the staff offered it to me without extra charge!)
The parking access is very convenient as well. There was nothing that I didn't like about this hotel.",5,2020,10,01
222,Great place,Excellent facilities and really comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay. I would highly recommend this place for anyone. Great choice on the TV as well. The parking area is free. It's a great bonus to get free parking in this part of Dublin.,5,2020,09,30
222,"Lovely hotel, nice details.","Spent two nights here, lovely stay with very friendly staff, particularly the lady who served us breakfast. Excellent amenities in the room, huge TV with netflix, amazon prime etc. Nespresso coffee machine. These are details you dont always see in hotels. Will be staying here again.",5,2020,09,27
222,Brilliant,"Comfortable, clean and modern. Near the city and located in a quiet area Great place to stay. Maybe I should keep it secret so nobody else knows about it. What else can I say. I'll definitely stay again",5,2020,09,19
222,Review,"The hotel room it’s self was amazing we stayed in the executive suite but the buttons on the jacuzzi would not work. Only the button that makes the bubbles worked, also it was quite annoying everytime we wanted to use the sauna we had to keep going down to reception and asking for it to be turned on because it turns off every 5 minutes. 

Other than that the room was absolutely unbelievable and I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone",4,2020,09,11
222,I Night stay,"Standard and quality of the rooms was excellent, cleanliness was second to none they have taken COVID and ensured they have fulfilled every requirement would definitely recommend and the value was excellent",5,2020,08,25

Would definitely visit again.",4,2020,07,28
222,Great room,"The bed was very comfortable and the room even had a sauna. I love how they provide films to watch in the room. The only thing would be when I turn on the air conditioner, it leaks but other than that, it was great. Would come back again.",5,2020,07,20
222,"Hidden gem, 15 min walk from Grafton Street","We stayed here earlier this week while on a shopping trip. Fabulous hotel with exqusite decor, clean and modern, homely and stylish. Zara and Desmond on reception are so friendly and welcoming and are clearly prepared to do anything to help the guests. Private, free parking around the back of the hotel is an added bonus. The room was decadent with super king size bed, jacuzzi bath and they even had an extra tap in the bathroom for ""drinking water"". Despite the location on a major road, the room was quiet and we had a balcony to the back of the hotel where we could sit and relax. We were given the most amazing room rate here when every other hotel in Ireland is ripping people off after the recent lockdown. I will definitely be staying here again and will never book anywhere else in Dublin. Highly rocommended.",5,2020,07,19
222,Better than I expected,The room was spotless and the staff was so nice they even walk you to your room. The room has a smart tv heated flooring in the bathroom a Bluetooth speaker and even provided face masks and hand sanitizer. It was only a short walk to Grafton street too. The breakfast was so good french toast and bacon.,5,2020,07,19

Very impressed and would highly recommend it to any type of stay.

222,AMAZING,"This hotel exceeded our expectations! We booked the suite room. It was spacious...Very spacious with a sauna and hot tub and multiple big tvs, one of which was a huge 4k samsung tv with netflix Nd youtube and all that jazz. The staff were amazing! They even layer fresh rose petals on the bed shaped as a heart with multiple balloons for free. Could have asked for any more. Thanks you for our stay! Best hotel room I've stayed in.",5,2020,07,15

222,Not a Three Star Hotel,"I do not know how this hotel only has three stars. The room was beautifully decorated, king size comfy bed, 2 person sauna in the bathroom with a rainfall shower. Balcony fits 2 chairs and the small table from the room for an evening drink. The drinking water tap in the bathroom is a nice touch also when you wake up in the morning. Full Irish Breakfast only €12 great value. 5 minute walk to the local shop. 5 minute walk to Baggot street for an evening meal. The staff helped arrange flower in the room on our arrival and where very polite.",5,2020,07,05

222,Beware! Never Made It There but Glad In The End!,Booked the luxury townhouse for a group weekend break. It looked beautiful. However we recieved an email in mid March to inform us because of the Covid outbreak they were permenently shutting the townhouses and had moved us into seperate rooms in the hotel.As it was a group holiday and we had booked the luxury of the townhouse with all the extra amenaties we did not want our booking to be changed so asked for a refund. Afterall they were cancelling our original booking not us. But we were shocked with the lack of integrity and loyalty to customers when they replied to say we either took the hotel rooms or lose the full amount as we had paid upfront on a non refundable rate. We then recieved a number of emails from the manager full of lies and discrepencies refusing any refund. Luckily we got our money back of our credit card but beware The Roxford Lodge has very underhanded practices and management lack respect and decency towards paying customers. We will be back to Dublin though as soon as possible but npot at The Roxford Lodge Hotel!,1,2020,06,04
222,Beautiful B&B! ,"I apologise in advance for the gushing here, but OH MY GOODNESS! Such an awesome place!

The staff are so friendly and warm, you will have great conversations with whoever you chat with. The rooms are just lovely, comfy beds, cute decor, great tea and coffee making facilities. We got a lovely desk in our room which was a nice feature. 

The bathrooms are on the small side, but who actually cares, you're not there for the bathrooms! 

Such a gorgeous B&B that left an impression on us, we'll definitely be back and definitely be recommending the Roxford Lodge to anyone who asks us for a recommendation. ",5,2020,05,10
222,"Outstanding, can't rate it highly enough.","What a beautiful quirky boutique hotel. The attention to detail in the room is fantastic. Definitely the nicest room I've ever stayed in. Dvd player and DVDs in the room, top of the range large smart TV, Aircon, UK & EU sockets, hdmi & usb outlets on both sides of the bed, safe and mini fridge, whirlpool bath, and my personal favourite a drinking water tap in the bathroom. Can't wait to return. Have to mention Des the owner, couldn't do enough for us, so friendly and down to earth. I left my kindle behind and he has offered to post it, what more can you ask for.",5,2020,03,20
222,Recommend for couple/solo ❤,"I had a lovely stay and would thoroughly recommend this hotel for either couple/solo relaxing night away. The hotel is clean and quiet and very cosy.

WiFi, TV, sockets, all fine as is shower, bed etc. This is however the first time we were charged €10 for parking-travellers note-you don't pay for on street parking on Sundays in this part of Dublin. The car park was/is being dug up. Cat litter a feature in the car park-note to Roxboro-if the cats are going to be a feature, someone needs to clean up after them so guests don't have litter on footwear.A few biscuits wouldn't go astray with the tea/coffee in the rooms.",4,2020,02,18

The room was lovely, with everything considered - heating control, Nespresso machine in addition to the usual kettle etc, strong reading light over the bed, drinking water on tap (literally), fridge, safe, iron and even an umbrella.
Staff were super friendly and helpful and breakfast delicious...
I've stayed in many other hotels and guesthouses in this area over the years but this is - by far - the best.
Thank you, I'll be back!",5,2020,01,21

222,Super stay!,Perfect place to spend the night. Room was impeccably clean. It was warm and quiet and has secure parking. Modern bathroom. Plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. Could not fault it.,5,2020,01,19
222,Unexpected suprise!,"We stayed in a family room for one night. The whole family were very pleased. It is much better than the Ballsbridge hotel nearby where we had also stayed for a night two years back. And the price is cheaper, too.

The ceiling is very high and we feel very roomy. The room is well decorated with beautiful lights. There is a very large TV which has internet, netflix (free), and youtube, etc. There is a DVD player with lots of discs. There is a dedicated router and internet speed is fantastic. There is also an air conditioning system for both hot and cold air. The room is quiet (face to the car park at the back) and nicely warm. Additionally, there is a fridge and a digital safe in the wardrobe. There are light strips in the wardrobe which is very practical.

The bathroom is well designed, too. It is underfloor heated. The towel hot rail is effectively a heater as well. There are two shower heads, one large and one medium. The water pressure is very good. So the shower is very comfy. 

There is free private parking facility and the staff were very friendly and helpful.

One small drawback, the entrance to the show (bath) unit is a bit (just a bit) narrow and the hot rail is just on the right hand side before you enter the bath. It is difficult to avoid touching it when it is hot especially for family with children. My daughter had touched by accident and screamed for two mins (:D). But it can be very dangerous. Hope the management could redesign or put a sign there to prevent issues.   

Overall, it is much better than we had expected and we will certainly come back next time when we need to stay in Dublin over night.",5,2020,01,12
222,Wonderful Family Vacation ,"We stayed in the 4 bedroom, 3 and a half bath house that sleeps 12. It was beautiful and very clean. Modern eat in kitchen, family room and large outdoor patio. Housekeeping was great. Front desk handled all our requests with kindness and efficiency. We took several early morning tours and front desk arranged for taxi pickup right in front of our door. Request the day prior. Several bars and restaurants within walking distance. Take a left when leaving house, down street and right at end of lane. In a few minutes you arrive at ""the corner"" where there are several restaurants. The pizza place is great fun with delicious food and cocktails. Neighborhood very safe and breakfast room in hotel very nice and food good. Breakfast room attendant a real treasure. Ireland was awesome and we're so happy we stayed at the Roxford Lodge. Thanks to all the staff for making our visit so memorable.",5,2020,01,07
222,Weekend Visit,"Stayed here very recently in one of the lodges & I must say the standards are incredibly high, the cleaniness of the property was superb & the staff were very helpful. All items were available tea, coffee, cerelas, etc indeed some xmas decorations were erected in the lodge also.",5,2020,01,07
222,Gorgeous hotel in beautiful Georgian suburb,"We stayed 4 nights in the Executive Suite with our two young children this week.

The Roxford is a character-filled boutique hotel/b&b full of Irish charm and situated in one of the nicest areas of Dublin, the Georgian, embassy district of Ballsbridge.

The Executive Suite is very luxurious, with lots of space and a super comfy king bed(and super comfy fold-out beds for little ones if you need). There is a sauna, a spa and a balcony where you can watch the sunrise over Aviva Stadium. 

Breakfasts are generous and great value. The full Irish was delicious, as was the Continental. The lady serving breakfast is charming and we enjoyed our conversations each morning.

You can walk to Merrion Sq or St Stephen’s Green within about 15/20 minutes. Elsewhere in the city (such as Temple Bar) we took a taxi.

The one downside to our stay, and the only reason we couldn’t give the Roxford 5 stars, was that unfortunately a previous guest had partied in the room the night before (28/12) so the Suite smelt heavily of smoke the entire 4 days. The first night it was almost unbearable. I’m tempted to say this is not the hotel’s fault, but despite the no smoking sign on the door, there was a large glass ashtray in the room when we arrived, so perhaps confirm before you stay that the Hotel is not providing people ashtrays to smoke in the room prior to your visit if this is an issue for you. 

Other than that, we would highly recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel! ",4,2020,01,04
222,Beautiful hotel ,"Booked this hotel last min close to a meeting I was having,  the receptionist was so kind and friendly,  hotel was beautifully presented and the rooms were just as well prepared with everything you needed and more.  I would definitely recommend this property and will be returning for sure.  ",5,2020,01,03
222,Roxford Lodge Hotel,"My 3 sisters & myself stayed here as we went to the Bord Gais theatre for a show, we got the family room which has a double bed & 2 single beds. They were so comfortable,the room decor was fantastic, spotless & very quiet.The newly renovated room has it's own bathroom with all modern facilities incorporated into the Victorian design, simply breathtaking, breakfast was so fresh & lots to choose from. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to everyone, it's near a lot of shops,bars,restaurants & has a bus stop right outside the door,a beautiful hotel with free parking & wifi throughout.",5,2019,12,29
222,Excellent Accomodation,"Very good accomodation , excellent in fact ... one of the most memorable stays I’ve had at any hotel . Thoughtful touches throughout the  rooms one even had a sauna !! Definitely one of my favourite places to stay !",5,2019,12,29
222,"Fantastic location, clean, very nice staff. Highly recommended.","We have spent one night attending party in the city. Very good location, walkable distance from Merrion/St. Stephen's Green area (1-1.5 km). Staff was very nice, breakfast was tasty (cheese omelette) at reasonable price (E6 for continental, E12 for fried). Clean, quiet, private carpark.",5,2019,12,08
222,Beautiful house,"We had a fabulous weekend in a very luxurious house which is warm, modern, comfortable, well located and very spacious
Couldn't fault it
Lovely toiletries, towels and underfloor heating. Would definitely stay agsin",5,2019,12,08
222,"Good Location, Clean Room, Friendly Staff","We stayed here for two nights at the end of a business trip in Dublin. Our room was newly renovated, clean and I was very impressed with the large modern bathroom.  We did not get to take advantage of any of the amenities inside as we were placed in a suite outside of the building in an outbuilding that had been renovated into two suites.   It was a bit inconvenient having to go outside to come in the back of the building and upstairs to the dining room.  Oddly the first morning we entered the dining room at around 8:00 and even though it said breakfast was from 7 - 10 it was dark (lights out) and empty.  We did find the hostess in the kitchen and she was very gracious and helpful.  Overall our room was private but it did back up to the street behind and we did have some street noise.  Since we did not get to actually stay in the building itself I don't feel we got a good sense of the place.   It is in a good location within walking distance of many restaurants and pubs.  If we stayed again I think we would request to stay in the building itself so we felt more like guests.",4,2019,11,29
222,"Very nice room and, seemingly, one of the few hotels with family rooms (3 beds)","The building is a conversion and the family room we had was an old drawing room with super high ceilings - perhaps 4 metres. No view -just over the parking lot, but no big deal. 2 single beds and one double/queen bed all very clean and tasteful. A 15 minute walk to the town center if you don't feel like figuring out the buses.",5,2019,11,25
222,A gem,"Spotlessly clean house in a very quiet residential street. They even had fresh white and brown bread, butter, milk, juices and cereals laid on for us. Very comfy beds and pillows. Very highly recommended.",5,2019,11,24
222,Mrs,"Lovely hotel , lovely staff - very clean and all facilities were perfect - free parking is a huge plus also - great location great price  no complaints at all - very impressed with this hotel , very comfy bed",5,2019,11,24
222,Beautiful,Beautiful hotel and very friendly staff in a very central location. The 3arena and another attractions are all within a few kilometres of this fine establishment. I cannot recommend it enjoy and the kids loved it also.,5,2019,11,17
222,Great boutique hotel in Ballsbridge,"We stayed at Roxford Lodge Hotel for two nights while visiting Dublin. The location was great - walking distance to downtown but far enough away to feel like we were separated from the hustle and bustle. Our room was a bit smaller than expected, but still cozy with all of the amenities we needed, including parking which is hard to find! Great staff, would definitely recommend.",5,2019,11,11
222,Location to 3 arena,"We chose this hotel due to proximity to 3 arena and price.
The room we were in was spacious even for 4 sharing, immaculated decorated and clean. Attention to detail im terms of decor and dvds for example provided. The wardrobe lights up when the doors are opened.
The location of this guesthouse is an affluent area where the city meets the suburbs. It is 5 mins walk to a tssco express, coffee shops etc. The closest bar is 2 mins walk. 
The receptionist was friendly and helpful. The only thing i would mention is my friend let reception know the night before of her vegan requirements for breakfast but when we got to breakfast no alternatives were provided and the staff didnt seem to uderstand which caused a bit of and unnecessary issue.",4,2019,11,06
222,Excellent,"Me and my mates stayed here for a concert in the 3 Arena, lovely place to stay, there was even fresh bread, milk and juice etc. which was very handy. Couldn’t recommend this hotel more, lovely staff too.",5,2019,11,03
222,Marathon weekend,"Stayed here with girls for #DCM,absolutely fantastic b&b,staff amazing,so friendly,rooms so comfy,great location,very good breakfast,great service,would highly recommend,very relaxing place to stay,thanks",5,2019,10,28
222,"Homely, Clean and recommended","a bit old fashioned - which is the charm; want for nothing everything is catered for and a great home made breakfast. will be back.

parking to rear , near 3 quality pubs and several eateries incl. a great steak house,",4,2019,10,23
222,"Comfortable, quiet.","Lovely lodgings, rooms are small but perfect for a weekend visit. Furnished very well and close to three arena and Aviva stadium and pubs and restaurants. Nice breakfast and friendly staff, Highly recommended.",5,2019,10,20
222,Overrated,"Perfectly fine room and friendly staff, but if your accustomed to the basics in a fine hotel this is not your place. No porter to assist with the bags, no lobby to pass the time, exceedingly hot breakfast area, room lacked the basic amenities you would expect even from a 3 Star hotel: no lotion, conditioner, hair dryer etc. tiles were missing from the floor in the hall, walls of our room-the executive suite-were all stuffed up. Location was just outside of town but meant a lot of walking just to get to the city. Free parking was a plus, but we can not understand how all the high ranking could be real.",3,2019,10,14
222,Excellent hotel,"The room was very comfortable. The shower was excellent. The coffee maker in the room was a nice touch, as the Blu-Ray player.

Excellent breakfast with friendly service.

I can definitely recommend this hotel and will happily stay here again. ",5,2019,10,09
222,Location was on a bus route to the city centre & pubs were within walking distance.,"Having off street parking was a bonus, the room was rather small with our luggage but the king size bed was very comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The guest house was in a very nice area.",5,2019,10,07
222,located in a pleasant somewhat upscale urban setting with convenient transportation reasonable restaurants,"we were given a recently remodeled room with many nice touches and spic and span as in spotless. the washroom was replete with towel heater bar and jacuzzi tub. the receptionist was helpfu and pleasant. 
i do think tho that the website would be more detailed as where and how to access the parking since the signage is poor as to the streets with the side street and the lane that the parking lot is on is virtually the same name.  also, the receptionist was not acquainted with the concept  of splitting the bill  when there were two separate couples, this was due in part to a language problem and not being aware that the hotel had billed for the entire stay 5 days beforehand.  it all worked out but if i had been more adequately advised of the situation it would have been a much more pleasant checking out.  she did do her best.",5,2019,10,01
222,"Lovely clean, pleasant hotel","Room was really comfortable. Spotless. Tv even had Netflix and some DVDs even included, nice touch,, Cosy sitting area with books and Victorian style furnishings, Breakfast very reasonable and also drinks very affordable. Definitely look forward to staying again,",5,2019,09,26
222,Very Cosy Roxford,"We stayed here on a very wet evening and the convenient secure car park was great. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful.
The room was very cosy and well equipped with kettle. There was a good variety of dvds if you don’t want to watch tv.
The hotel is in a great location being close to the Aviva stadium, the RDS and good pubs and restaurants. Also good public transport and airport coach outside the door.
We look forward to staying here again.",5,2019,09,24
222,"Good location, friendly staff","Stayed 4 nights.  Comfortable room, small but well set out.  Great location - out of the city centre but a level 15 minute walk to city centre, close to a few eating houses, and on the bus route. Staff very helpful.",4,2019,09,24
222,So Many Stairs,"This is a very strange property. It's certainly not the place to stay if you have a disability or a lot of luggage. We couldn't figure out how to enter using the ramp from the sidewalk on Northumberland Road, so we took our luggage up the stairs to the main entrance. The counter at the reception desk is so high, or the receptionist's seat is so low, that it appears no one is there. The receptionist emerged and helped take our luggage down an interior ramp to the elevator, then up in the elevator to a higher floor, then down some stairs to our room, then up interior stairs in our room. That's a lot of stairs. Not a huge issue for me, but certainly not convenient; impossible for some guests to navigate without assistance. We had the executive suite, which is a strange space (I sort of expected this from the photos). The bathroom (which is very nice but had a missing handle on one of the shower controls) is on the same level as the entrance, but then it's up a few stairs to a vast expanse of outdated carpet and minimal furnishings. There are more stairs up to a mezzanine featuring a jacuzzi, sauna, and flatscreen TV. I liked the skylights and comfortable kingsize bed. I did not like the tiny coffee cups that caused the Nespresso to overflow even on the setting for the smallest cup. Breakfast starts at 7:30, which was late for us due to an early flight out of DUB, so they allowed us to enter at 7:00--much appreciated! The breakfast attendant was charming and helpful. Breakfast was OK. All in all, this place has a very strange vibe. It is not a luxury property. I would not recommend it unless you get a fantastic deal.",3,2019,09,23
222,Great location ,Great location. It’s an easy walk into the city center. The breakfast is nice. The staff are friendly. If you have a car there is parking.  It’s close to the Dart station. Coffee and tea and a fridge in the bedroom ,4,2019,09,22
222,Good stay but,"I would temper your expectations but overall good.  We had a superior double.  Relatively quiet and clean and spacious on the top floor.

The bed was comfortable but linens were a little less comfortable for a high quality place.  The location was good. Just a short 20 min walk to the center.  It gets a little longer at the end of the day.  Good restaurants in the neighbourhood.

My other half didn’t sleep that well and didn’t feell as welcomed but I felt the welcome was adequate and room was comfortable.

The big issue was the airport bus.  Front desk said that a bus comes every 15 mins and we waited 40 mins and it was full.  ( near the end of the pick ups). We called a taxi.",4,2019,09,20
222,Very comfortable stay.,"We spent two nights here. First, you should know that there are a number of steps up to the hotel reception so you must be able to carry your bags up these. Staff were very friendly and helpful with advice and taxi calls as needed. We arrived early so they stored our luggage for us and delivered bags to our rooms when they were ready. Building is a bit of a maze but not too bad to figure out. Rooms were neat and clean, good WiFi, and TV for those that want it. Breakfast is not included in the room price. 6€ gets you the continental breakfast that would be ample for most folks if you don't mind carbs. 12€ will get you other choices of omlettes, bacon, etc.",5,2019,09,19
222,Nope - these reviews don't tell the whole story,"I had high expectations for this hotel based on the reviews.  I am a pretty savvy and well-traveled person; I don't typically book and hope a place is decent, I do my homework.  This place severely disappointed.  You will see talk of great bathtubs and unique decorations; the hotel's own website mentions how exclusive the area is.  Reality?  That sure wasn't my experience.  Yes, the area is nice.  But that's about it.  A ""single"" room is a tad bit larger than a closet.  The bathroom is tiny, with a shower (no tub).  The space between your twin bed (yes, twin) and the wall is about enough room for your suitcase.  This place makes rooms in NYC look absurdly spacious in comparison.  Wouldn't go back; cannot recommend.  Perhaps the ""suites"" that others mention are great, but there is NO WAY that this place is deserving of the high rating it has; and that makes me wonder exactly how it is that they have so many great ratings.  ",2,2019,09,14
222,Lovely place.👊,Just outside the city center. @ 1.5 km. Bus stops in front of the hotel you can also go by foot. The national gallery is on the route. Very good hotel. Nice rooms with a lot of comfort. Enclosed carparking. ,5,2019,09,11
222,Wonderful stay in the Roxford Lodge,My dad and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for 3 nights and we had a wonderful experience. The beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and bathroom were nicely decorated and clean. We would definitely book there again.,5,2019,09,09
222,Ireland 2019,Very nice cozy inn. This was our first trip to Ireland and we stayed here for 3 nights. The executive suite was very comfortable and spacious.Lovely breakfast and very friendly & helpful staff. We would definitely stay here again!,5,2019,09,08
222,Mariana the receptionist is an angel,I have a disability and she is so kind and helpful. Restored my faith in humanity.  This is my second time staying here and as a solo traveller its so nice to have your life made easier. Will stay here again if i get the chance. ,5,2019,09,03
222,Perfect accommodation for big numbers,"Well stocked kitchen we made breakfast and dinner there, milk bread supplied which is nice when u arrive saves going to shop straight away big comfortable beds lovely showers everything easy to use and great location",5,2019,09,02
222,Friendy staff but decor a bit tired,"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel. We received a friendly and helpful welcome and informed about the charges for breakfast. We enjoyed one breakfast which elected to have in our room and we were driving up to Belfast that day to meet a friend and didn't want to be delayed. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and, once found, access to the secure car park and the access from the car park to the hotel was easy and convenient.
My main issue is the use of space in the double room we were staying in and the slightly jaded  scruffy décor - particularly the bath panel which was laminated and the laminate was peeling away at the bottom as a result of water on the floor (unavoidable as the shower screen easily opened allowing the spray directly onto the floor if one wasn't careful).
I question the need for a sauna in the room particularly as it took up a lot of space in a crowded room which otherwise could have been used for clothes storage (the cupboard allocated for this was very small and occupied by an ironing board) and an area to place the drinks facilities, coffee machine and fridge which were all squeezed into an area by the window and one needed to juggle things around to make a drink. The coffee maker sat on top of the safe and shared that space with the Wi-Fi so the potential for knocking things over was great!
I have to say, in spite of its convenient location and friendly staff, the lack of space, bar and dinner service means I probably will not book to stay again.",3,2019,09,02
222,Hmmmmm...,"The exterior of the building is elegant and large and is in an area of similar properties in what once would have been a high class residential area.  We had a double room as nothing larger was available and we’ve not been in such a cramped room for a very long time. Based on our room and the hallway/lobby the whole building seems to have been ‘designed’ to fit in as many rooms as possible without much thought given to comfort and the style and fittings seem to have been selected to mash up as many looks as possible. The murals and columns in the breakfast room are a real highlight!  Even for an able bodied couple access was very convoluted.

Bathroom design was weird as required by being so small and fittings were very tired and in need of refurbishment, and the shower was a trickle.

I’m glad we got in to the car park early as it’s a bit cosy in there and reversing in makes sense for an easier exit next day.

Breakfast service was ok but a bit sluggish and the choices were limited compared to other places we’d stayed on our tour.

If you can get a really good size room this place would probably be ok based on location alone, but if we visited Dublin in future we certainly wouldn’t stay here again.  Perhaps we’ve just come to expect more based on other excellent hotels we’ve enjoyed  in Ireland?",2,2019,08,24
222,In Dublin for a Concert,"Great location and friendly staff. The room was spacious and well appointed. The only slight against the experience was that an hour before check out water started running through the bathroom ceiling making it unusable. Nothing the staff could have done but no compensation or apology was offered. Other than that, highly recommended.",4,2019,08,24
222,A peaceful oasis close to town,"I was in Dublin for a conference at the CCD and chose Roxford Lodge in preference to the corporate dockside hotels because I wanted somewhere quieter and less expensive. I couldn't have been happier with my decision. So long as you don't mind the walk - Roxford Lodge is situated an easy 20 min stroll from both the waterside area and the town centre - this thoughtfully presented, immaculately clean hotel is equally perfect for business or pleasure. My room was comfortable, cosy, and best of all quiet, with no outside noise or background white noise from aircon, kitchen fans etc. The staff are lovely and the breakfast exceptional - one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, individually cooked to taste.",5,2019,08,20
222,A Gem in Dublin! ,"Stayed as a couple in the executive suite - a beautiful & very spacious room, with spa bath and sauna. All staff are friendly and welcoming. Hotel is spotless and in a quiet residential area, yet close to city centre. Can't fault anything. Thank you, will definitely be back! ",5,2019,08,18
222,Great hotel in Dublin,"We travel for business/pleasure and we always stay at Roxford. Lovely suburb, nice walk into the city, fab rooms. Staff are pleasant and will accommodate if you would like to see other rooms for example. I'm sure their breakfast is good but we've always gone out to Juniors over the road.",5,2019,08,13
222,Roxford lodge hotel,"A very disappointing experience for the whole family. I have never experienced a check in like this. We travelled down on the Saturday unaware that there were several big sporting events on in Dublin. This caused problems accessing the hotel carpark. When we approached the gates of the car park I buzzed to gain entrance. I thought the car park looked quite full and asked the receptionist was there any spaces. She told me to come in ,plenty of parking. However when we drove in there was none and we were left stranded in the middle of a rather congested carpark.I went to reception where I received the worse check ever. It was like something out of Faulty Towers. We were asked to come back at 5pm and hope for a space then. This was at approximately 340pm.When I asked for a suggestion of alternative parking she did not know of anywhere. Then another guess very kindly informed me of the street parking availability. We were just about to leave the property when she then said oh you are actually booked in for a town house. I explained that I booked a family room to which she replied you are in the house which has its own private parking! So after all that unnecessary stress we shouldn't have been brought into the carpark at all. This was unnecessary stress and a rather unpleasant experience which could have and should have been avoided had the staff carried out their job adequately. I asked to speak to the manager but they were not available. I informed her that as soon as they returned I would like to speak with them. She then took us over to the house which wasn't even cleaned. We left our bags in the car and went for a walk until the house was cleaned. Nobody came back to discuss the matter and I never heard or saw a manager.Also they took full payment 48hrs before check in. It clearly states payment at check in or out. I feel if the hotel had informed us of all of the above our stay would have been much more enjoyable. I also feel that they should have informed us about the surrounding streets to the hotel been closed off and suggested how to gain access. It makes sense that they should have informed us that we would be staying in the house with private parking. My booking clearly states family room. However,the house was very clean and in a nice area especially with children. The cleaners apologised several times for the house not being ready but it was obvious that they were under pressure due to work load. They did a great job cleaning it up, as when I first went in I couldn't believe the sight I saw. Its just a pity reception staff appeared clueless.",1,2019,08,12
222,Great stay,"I had a warm welcome and was brought to a very clean room with all the facilties one could need. The bed was good, although the room was quite warm. But with the Windows open of was comfortabel. Breakfast is very good, great choice and lots of extra's. The start are all very friendly. It was my third stay at this hotel and I am sure of won't be my last. Local busses stop in front of the hotel and the aircoach stop close by, only a few minutes walking. A great experience again.",5,2019,08,11

222,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in their newly refurbished family room. It is a very nice, spacious and well decorated room. We loved it. There is a Nespresso machine for coffee and an electric kettle for tea. The bathroom is small but beautiful. The air conditioning works very well. Continental breakfast is good and only €6. The lady serving breakfast is very friendly and sweet. The hotel is about 25 minutes walk to the centre of Dublin, but the bus stops in front of the hotel. Car parking is secure behind the hotel. The area is quiet. Highly recommended and if we ever come to Dublin again we’ll definitively stay here. ",5,2019,08,05
222,Very comfy stay!,"This was a lovely experience to stay with you, guys! Thanks for the comfort, amenities and your attitude. This lodge is about 20 min from city center in a very calm, clean and beautiful area of Dublin. The sleep was wonderful, the cleanliness and well decorated room. A bit biting price however ;-)",5,2019,08,04
222,Room well fitted out but very cramped,Room well fitted out but very cramped; good breakfast but quite expensive. Conveniently situated - 15-20 minutes walk to city centre with alternative of regular bus service. Airport bus stops very close.,3,2019,07,30
222,A Nice Surprise - Great for Families,"We had booked a family room, but were delighted to be upgraded to a 3 bedroom townhouse. It was so nice to have the extra space (traveling with a tween and teen) as well as a kitchen stocked with basic provisions (coffee, tea, milk, juice, bread, cereal etc.). If you are traveling with family, especially young children, this place is perfect. Tucked in cupboards around the townhouse we found baby gates (2), playpens (2), extra cots (2) , as well as a washer and dryer.

We walked into central Dublin for the afternoon (took about 20 min.). The city was simply jammed with tour groups, so to be honest, we were rather relieved to be staying a little away from the action. The neighborhood around the Roxford Lodge has some nice cafes and restaurants too (Junior's for lunch, The Old Spot for dinner – excellent food and has a kids' menu).

The townhouse was showing a little wear and tear (apparently some people don't know how to get a suitcase up and down stairs without bashing into the walls) – but otherwise it was perfect. It even had a little private garden out back !

I highly recommend this property for a Dublin stay.",5,2019,07,26
222,Quality Dublin Hotel,"Stayed here many times ending my business trips to to Ireland. Front of house staff are very welcoming and accommodation is Clean and Tidy with all room facilities you would expect. 
Location is 5 min walk to a bustling array of Restaurants, Bars and Pubs all serving excellent food. (I arrive late and leave early so no chance to try the in house food).",5,2019,07,22
222,"Beautiful garden, great neighborhood","The service from the friendly staff was excellent from my arrival until departure!  The garden in the front of the hotel is beautiful, the hotel was clean, my room was a single but it was well designed with good closet space and amenities. This is a hotel which is well cared for and sensitive to being a good host to its guests. The location was a short distance walk to the center of town or I could take a bus right in front of the hotel. Super hotel!",5,2019,07,18
222,Fantastic Accommodation!,"We were delighted with the house. There was loads of space for the 10 of us, 2 families visiting Dublin. The house was super clean and the kitchen was also stocked with milk, bread and other goodies. The location was perfect - close to everything! Would definitely stay again and recommend.",5,2019,07,17
222,Delightful - especially for solo female travelers,"I’m so happy with my stay here. I’ve traveled around a lot of countries on my own for work and fun (I’m a woman in my 20s) and have never felt so well taken care of, safe and settled. The room was *small* but perfectly outfitted with everything I could need and very, very clean. And it was nice and quiet. Best of all was the staff, who were kind and helpful. I can’t recommend this place enough!",5,2019,07,15
222,"Great neighborhood, lovely accommodations","Six of us shared a townhouse, and the set-up was perfect--a lovely walk to the canal and plenty of room for all in our party, which included grandparents, parents, and kids. We stayed in 3 different places while we were in Dublin, and this was by far the best. The only downside was the townhouse wasn't ready until 4:30 PM on the date of our arrival.",4,2019,07,08
222,Good option in Dublin,"Small but comfortable single room. Comfortable bed & great shower. Good location & only 20 minute walk to 3 Arena & other amenities. Bus stop outside hotel. Helpful staff. Would happily stay there again.
",4,2019,07,07
222,Roxford Lodge Hotel,"We rented an apartment at the Roxford Arms for our group’s last night in Dublin.  It was perfect.  Quiet location but only a 15 minute walk to city center.  There were also pubs and restaurants on the next block and the Roxford Arms Hotel is another option.  Unfortunately, it was a one night stay for us.  We’d stay there again!  Nice personal touches on arrival (juices, breads, butter, coffee/tea..) and the reception at the Hotel was very helpful. Desmond, our host was very quick to respond and made check-in easy.  5 stars all around.  Wish we had been there longer.",5,2019,06,30
222,Excellent ,"We stayed in the 4 bedroom house, and it was absolutely superb- the house is very well fitted out with high quality fixtures and the whole house is very spacious and very comfortable, particularly the beds which were huge . I can’t think of a thing to fault the place.   I would highly recommend this for a family group. ( we were 4 couples) ",5,2019,06,30
222,Lovely overnight visit,I loved this place. Comfortable. Quiet. Clean. Friendly staff. Nice location. I had a single room no. 108. Comfortable bed. Big bathtub. Beautiful Victoria building near good restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,06,30
222,Dublin Vacation,"Very comfortable and in a great location to walk through the city. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for a nice European feel. The breakfast was very good and fresh, and passed inspection of a picky eater",5,2019,06,21
222,Gracious & Comfortable,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Our room was pristine & well- appointed, beds were very comfortable and the shower was excellent. Mariana at the desk was so helpful & accommodating. We arrived very early & were able to leave our luggage & rest in the lounge. Great location- quiet but near everything. I would recommend Roxford Lodge to everyone!",5,2019,06,21
222,Disappointing ,"The room was incredibly small, not at all what we expected or had thought we'd booked! On asking the receptionist why there was a difference between what we thought we'd booked and what was provided, we were advised that they couldn't show all the rooms! The bathroom was tiny with the toilet squeezed in next to the bath. If you're a normal/decent sized person, you won't be comfortable.  Everything was clean and nice however staff weren't overly helpful or pleasant and that was before we'd queried the room size!! ",3,2019,06,18
222,Great Location,Stayed recently when attending a gig at the RDS. Hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the RDS. Modern and clean rooms. Staff were really helpful and polite. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2019,06,18
222,A great place to stay,"It was an easy drive, avoiding the city centre, from the Irish Ferries terminal to this hotel (but be aware that there is a toll to pay at a bridge en route).  We stayed for two nights and found the hotel very convenient, as we could walk or take a bus to/from the city centre.  Staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast was good.   There are restaurants nearby for dinner and a free on-site car park.

Our room was spacious but, annoyingly, a vast proportion of the available space was taken up by a dry sauna (which we did not want or use) and storage of pillows, linen etc.  The wardrobe had very limited hanging space (unusable at all until we removed the ironing board and iron blocking it).  Despite this drawback, we found it a great place to stay for a visit to Dublin.",5,2019,06,17
222,Fabulous Little Hotel,"What a great find this hotel was. Clean and really well presented with lovely modern decor. We had a small but big enough room with all we needed, loved the touches - Netflix, a DVD player with selection of films, coffee pod machine etc. Breakfast was very tasty, Full Irish or continental which included cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit selection, toast, cheeses, juices, tea and coffee. Short walk into the centre of town and perfect location for 3Arena, took us 15 minutes to walk back after seeing a concert there. Didn't need to get a cab or bus as so perfectly located. Will definitely book here next time we are in Dublin",5,2019,06,14
222,"""Georgian in style!""","Stayed here our first two nights in Dublin. Location is excellent, just 10 min walk from CBD. Continental OR Full Irish breakfast is VG value and well presented. 
The room has been renovated but still a little small - our closet really not useable(no luggage storage) and open floor space ""crowded"" around desk/chair - and somewhat outdated. Bonus - a NESPRESSO machine. 
Staff were friendly and very helpful. Parking off a laneway, but limited. Overall, very well kept and clean.

Verdict: Functional! Excellent value and would stay again.",4,2019,06,13
222,Room 107!,"Okay, I stayed here twice at the top and bottom of a one month long tour of Ireland.  First I had a room that faced the street... upstairs.  When I returned I was given a room downstairs facing the side. I really loved the 2nd room because it had a bathtub with jacuzzi.  Also the windows opened in that room.  Both rooms were very very clean, comfy beds and quiet.  I really can't say enough about this hotel.  In the first room there was a much needed umbrella.  Both rooms had a mobile phone which I could use to call home (USA) for free!  Breakfast was absolutely superb and they serve until 10:30 which is great for a later riser like myself.  Served, I believe, by the owner herself who is an absolutely fabulous woman.  I'm very proud to say she called me a ""perfect gentleman"".  The location is not right in the heart of the action but is only about a 20 minute walk away.  There is a bus just across the road that comes frequently and also the bus that takes you to and from the airport is less than a block away.  It's a quiet residential upscale woody neighborhood.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Especially in room 107.",5,2019,06,12
222,Wouldn’t stay anywhere else,"Have just left after staying two nights in a recently and beautifully renovated family room, the best we’ve had while we have been travelling around Europe. The bathroom in particular was superb. The entire building is immaculately maintained. Met the lovely owner over breakfast and she couldn’t have been more helpful. The lodge  is about 30mins pleasant walk from the city  centre/Dublin castle and extremely close to Lansdowne Park. Excellent value for money and would definitely stay again if returning to Dublin. ",5,2019,06,12
222,Great Stay,"Friendly and helpful staff that were very accommodating.  The room was a little outdated, however the bed was very comfortable.  The location is perfect - easy access from the airport with the AirCoach drop off less than 1 block away.  The city central is approximately 10 minute walk.  Great neighborhood.   My only suggestion would be to enhance the breakfast selections, particularly for the price.   Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2019,06,09
222,Excellent,"Very nice hotel which is close to links into the city but within walking distance too. Our room was very tastefully decorated, clean and comfortable. The staff are very helpful and were able to provide information on local eateries for a meal on rainy night as this hotel does not do evening meals. Breakfast (continental and full Irish) are very good and are provided from 7.30-10.30.",5,2019,06,09
222,Really comfortable place,We stayed here in April. Our room was very nice and comfortable. The breakfasts were very good. The location was perfect for us because we walked everywhere. The staff was very nice and professional. Recommended highly for your Dublin visit. ,4,2019,06,04
222,excelent service,"We are a family of eight and rented a full house with 4 rooms 
It's was perfect with a lot of complementary essentials and food 
Desmond is the perfect host 
We really enjoyed our time, Dublin is a wonderful city",5,2019,06,04
222,"A number of key advantages, especially when all the bigger hotels get booked out.","This is a cozy comfortable Victorian townhouse hotel, in the heart of Ballsbridge, on the Northumberland Road. We have stayed here a number of times as this boutique style hotel has a number of key advantages, especially when all the bigger hotels get booked out. The location is excellent for transport and access to South Dublin’s attractions including the Royal Dublin Society (RDS), scene of the Dublin Horse Show and many big soccer events and concerts, and the nearby Aviva Stadium, home of Irish Rugby. Airbus from the airport stops outside and the busses to the centre and suburbs stop there also (single ticket for less than 3 euro – note change not given). 
Some of the rooms are quite small but they’re well maintained – good soundproofing, excellent speed Wi-Fi and cabled Internet and TV plus free international calling on a complimentary mobile phone. Complimentary tea and coffee with biscuits, lots of hot water and some rooms have a Jacuzzi bath or a sauna (dry heat). There was a choice of either continental (6 euro) or Irish Breakfast, with brown bread, real black pudding etc (12 euro). Parking is free; the room costs have increased steadily over the years (but Bitcoins accepted!) but there is a family feeling when staying in the Roxford lodge, which is appreciated.",4,2019,06,02
222,"very cozy, well located and reasonable priced","The hotel is a very cozy townhouse in the beautiful district of Ballsbridge, where most of the embassies are located. It has few rooms, relatively small, but decorated with good taste and with all possible options. Breakfast was nice and tasty. Staff are very courtoise. Price of the room and breakfast very reasonable for the centre of Dublni.",5,2019,05,28
222,Lovely stay,"Stayed for three nights, good room and very helpful staff. Short walk to local food places and about 20 minutes into centre. Car parking is a bonus but limited facility for leaving luggage appreciated!",4,2019,05,28
222,Fantastic room and staff,Room was better than expected with a very large jet bath and powerful shower and dvd selection on the Android enabled TV the bed was comfortable with nice sheets. The hotel itself was easy to find with its own private car park,5,2019,05,26
222,"Good location, Good Value","Although rooms are on the small side, they were clean and comfortable. We stayed here pre and post tour and the location was perfect for our pick-up point. Convenient AirCoach stop for airport transfer. Staff was friendly and breakfast good. Hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood with nearby restaurants, etc. Hop on Hop Off bus nearby.",4,2019,05,24
222,cramped and poorly designed,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for 2 nights for a business function. Having been advertised as a luxury hotel, we were very disappointed.
I should start by highlighting the good parts. The hotel has some nice features and quality furniture and is generally in good decorative order. Breakfast was very good and the breakfast room host was a delight.
There are however numerous issues that meant we were unhappy with our stay, which at Eur160 per night, is towards the top end of the local market.
Our room had been narrowed to allow a corridor to another room, which was extremely noisy with doors slamming, and the constant noise of the adjoining rooms bathroom fan.
our double room was very cramped, with a desk (filled up with a coffee machine, DVD player and phone making it a waste of usable space) and 2 chairs wedged in somehow making it difficult to move around the room, especially as our suitcase didn't fit in the wardrobe.
there were numerous pillows (very good quality) and cushions on the bed, however, when trying to sleep there was nowhere to store these, so they became a trip hazard on the floor.
the wardrobe was too small to hold anything and was already filled with the ironing board.
also in the already cramped room, there were 3 doors - the main door, wardrobe door, and bathroom door, again restricting floor space to move around.
by far the biggest failing was the bathroom. yet again a room squeezed into a space unsuitable for its purpose.
I am not a large person, but I was unable to sit on the toilet without my knees wedged up against the towell heater rail.
the bath had a glass screen which you couldn't open as it hit on the toilet, meaning to run a bath or test the water temperature, you had to physically stand in the bath.
the bathroom ceiling height was too low and with a ceiling mounted shower head, I was unable to stand under the shower without bending and to get out of the shower, I had to stoop to get under a lower section of the ceiling, and navigate my way around the glass screen.
There was also nowhere to store toiletries. the single shelf above the sink was too narrow to put anything on, meaning we also had to store our toiletries in the bedroom and take individual items into the bathroom as needed.
I also need to add. We had a number of colleagues also with us on the trip who were accommodated in one of the hotels 'Townhouse'. These were advertised as something of an upgrade for larger groups, with 3 double ensuite bathrooms, lounge and kitchen. This was in fact reminiscent of University student accommodation at best, with mismatched furniture in a tired state, the garden having not been cleaned from the previous residents.",2,2019,05,19
222,Okay,"The Roxford is very clean. It is also very convenient. 25 minute walk to Dublin proper. On a major street for buses and taxis. Near food and drink, 5 to 7 minute walk. The place is quite compact. Small hallways and small rooms. Flat pillows and the bed was springy and a little firm. The staff was very helpful and friendly. ",3,2019,05,19
222,"Not Bad, But Not Impressed","Roxford Lodge is located a 20+ minute walk to the city center (or you can chance the unreliable Dublin buses) in a quiet neighborhood. The room was fine, even if the layout was awkward (I had the tiny single room). Unfortunately the staff wasn’t as friendly as I’d hoped, although I was only there for one night so maybe it was an off day. There wasn’t anything outright bad about it, but I wouldn’t stay there again.",3,2019,05,13
222,2 days in Dub,"Stunning room, couldn’t have wished for more. King sized bed, large jacuzzi bath, sauna, separate shower, fridge, coffee making facilities, small outdoor balcony area with rooftop views over Dublin. Well situated for city centre and local pubs/restaurants. Friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast too. The only drawback was the sporadic Wi-fi within the room.",5,2019,05,10
222,A Great Place to Stay at!,"This hotel was incredible! A little gem in Dublin for sure. My husband and I traveled to Dublin for the first time and arrived very late, but I had notified the hotel of our arrival. By the time we got to the hotel, we were worried since it was past midnight, but a very sweet lady opened the door for us and took us up to our room, she provided great service! We had booked the room way in advance and didn't realize that we had chosen the executive suite so when she opened the door to our room our jaws dropped! The room was sooo beautiful, clean, spacious, the bed was super comfortable and it had a great bathroom, spa and so much more! The breakfast was delicious and service was so great! It is walking distance to the main attractions and transit is available right in front of the hotel. We LOVED this hotel and still talk about going back one day!",5,2019,05,09
222,Very comfortable and great location,"This is a little gem of a hotel in Dublin.  It is walking distance to eateries and all the major attractions.  If you do not feel like walking transit is right at your door, including to the airport.  The rooms are very clean and very comfortable.  The breakfasts are delicious with very gracious services.  The staff is so accommodating and helpful.  Very impressed with this little gem and highly recommend it for your stay.",5,2019,05,03
222,Really helpful staff. Nice area just a short bus journey from city centre,"The hotel is in a safe area which let us have a walk in the evening. Safe secure and free carparking to the rear of the hotel, which was great.
The staff were great and helpful.
Bus stops right outside the hotel for the journey into and out of town centre (3 euro for a single trip). Buses ran to 2330 which was great.
Less than 20min walk from grafton street or 3 arena.",5,2019,05,01
222,Superb,"Had a lovely stay at Roxford Lodge , recently , from warm welcome on arrival to being shown to our lovely room , we were really impressed with the level of comfort , and soft furnishings through the hotel. The rate was excellent , beds comfortable , shower powerful , breakfast delicious and having parking included at such a great location really made for a fabulous stay, cant wait to return, thank you for taking such good care of us.",5,2019,04,23
222,"Wonderful, homey accomodations","We absolutely loved this place. They have thought of every amenity, bars on bathtub, coffee makers, music, jacuzzi and dry sauna all in our room. The bed is comfortable. The breakfasts are lovely and served by the owner Agnes. They offer just about everything for breakfast and it is all very reasonable. I would definitely like to return.",5,2019,04,17
222,Fabulous ,"I stayed here for five nights and was really impressed. The room was spotless and immaculately presented. The breakfast was generous and good value. There is a bus stop outside the door and the DART station is close by, but you can walk into the city too. I would stay here again.",5,2019,04,16
222,A lovely stay in a lovely hotel !,"We loved our stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel. We were shocked at how beautiful it was. Our room was gorgeous. A great colour scheme and lots of storage space. Bathroom was compact but very clean and nicely finished. The facilities were great, loads of lighting, even in the wardrobe! A fridge, coffee and tea facilities, comfortable spacious bed, jacuzzi bath, a balcony and a rainhead shower. The decor was fantastic, we especially loved the telephones, and pictures on the walls ! Staff were super friendly and a great secure car park! I loved the cats there sunning themselves! Gorgeous! Would come back again in a heartbeat!",5,2019,04,14
222,Pure Luxury,"I stayed in the hotel Executive Suite. Really spacious and clean. The room is split over 3 levels, and the open plan jacuzzi and sauna give the room a really luxurious feel. The room has a large smart tv as well. The hotel is really quiet too and also accomodated a late check out. 

It is quite centrally located in a good area, approx 6-8e taxi from the city centre and there are shop located on Baggot St about 5 mins walk away if you want a few bars and restaurants but do not want to head into the centre.

The parking is quite difficult to find, it would be handy if the address was on the website. Also, a full length mirror in the room would also be useful, but I feel like im nitpicking. I would definitely stay again.",5,2019,04,10
222,Fantastic gem,"We stayed here last night. We arrived and parked in the gated car park at the rear. Access from the car park via the rear door was via a clean hard landscaped area. We went up to the reception and checked into our room. Reception was clean and organised excellently. The bedroom was ultra clean and generously laid out with every conceivable requirement. Bathroom excellent, fantastic water pressure. Bed was excellent, even better than beds in two hotels in Sligo and Redcastle that we had stayed in over the previous weekend.
Breakfast was freshly cooked to order. Brown bread was excellent. Freshly made porridge was lovely.
Plenty of fresh fruit available. The lady that served us was very natural and friendly and put us at ease.
The front garden is hard landscaped with seasonal flowers. Well done gardener.
Its a handy walk into Dublin, just twenty minutes, and the bus stop is outside the front door. 
We have stayed in many hotels in Dublin for years. We have found a new place to stay.
100% recommend Roxford Lodge, their staff and their approach to customer care.",5,2019,04,05
222,A fantastic hotel and wonderful staff.,"My partner and I stayed last night. We were exhausted after a delayed flight. I phoned the hotel the lady in reception (I'm sorry I didn't get her name) was so helpful and went out of her way with us when we arrived we felt so welcome and comfortable.
The hotel was so clean and homely,the room was so modern and spacious,great location,parking on site.

We cannot wait to return and will be back very soon.
M&D",5,2019,04,05
222,Will definitely use again,Lovely clean room.  Modern feel to it. Friendly staff and excellent breakfast cooked to order.  Will definitely be using this hotel again for both business trips and personal.  No restaurant in the hotel but quite a few within walking distance.  Short walk to Grand Canal Train station and bus stop just outside the door.,5,2019,04,05
222,"We stayed twice during our travels in Ireland, and found both the room and the house to be faultless.","The beds were comfortable, bathrooms were clean and well appointed. The owners and staff were helpful and kind. The location was in a lovely neighborhood walking distance to a grocery store, restaurants and pubs. The kitchen in the house was well equipped and they even provided the thoughtful touches such as tea and coffee, bread, butter and even juice!",5,2019,04,04
222,Hidden Gem of a hotel,This family owned boutique hotel is the best discovery we have had. The service is exceptional and the breakfast is absolutely amazing. The hotel is so superior to normal chains of hotels where each room is the same. At the Roxford Lodge each room is different and decorated with the most amazing taste. You could stay here ten times and still feel it is a different hotel each time plus the family owners are absolutely amazing. I always look forward to staying here!,5,2019,04,03
222,"Extraordinary friendly service and cleanliness, unbeatable location","I spent 12 days at Roxford Lodge, and the stay was extremely pleasant. The entire staff is  friendly and forthcoming and eager to assist you with any  needs you might have.
My room was very clean and cozy. The location of the hotel is absolutely convenient, there is a busstop directly in front of the hotel, and the train services are within 8 minutes 'walking distance. I will definitely come back.",5,2019,03,28
222,Excellent!,"The staff were absolutelly great!!! and the hotel confortable, cozy, nice and 25 minutes walking to the center.
The room had all the facilities and absolutely renovated!
I would recommend it without doubt!",5,2019,03,26
222,Very nice stay,"We stayed here for one night, attending a concert in the 3 arena (25 minutes walk). Location is quiet, private parking is available at the back of the hotel, our bedroom was small but had all you could ask for (sauna, nice bathroom with bubble bath, access to a small terrace). The bed was most comfortable. 
Breakfast is 6€ for cereals and yogurts, or 12€ for cooked breakfast. Cooked breakfast was an absolute delish !
It was a sunny day so we asked if we could keep the car parked there while we went for a walk and lunch after we checked out and the lady at reception was so nice. We collected the car 3 hours later and left .
Definitely recommend this place.",4,2019,03,26
222,lovely stay - will be back,"I came to Dublin as I was meeting friends and visiting the RDS.  The location is excellent for the RDS and the city centre, either walking or on the bus.  The receptionist are very knowledgeable and friend.  My room was very clean and had lots of little extras. very good nights sleep.  will be back",4,2019,03,26
222,Family Trip to Dublin (Roxford Lodge Hotel).,"A small family group including a particularly elderly member travelled to Dublin for a weekend visit. Having arrived in Dublin we boarded the Number 4 bus from O'Connell St bridge, which (for between 2.15 and 3.0 Euros) took us to a stop on Northumberland Rd (immediately outside the Roxford Lodge Hotel).
The staff on reception were really pleasant and friendly and showed us the rooms and outlined facilities at the hotel. 
The hotel itself is small but exceptionally clean and had good facilities within the room(s).
We stayed for two nights and would definately go back and stay at the hotel again.
Northumberland Ave is about a mile or so away from the city centre so there was no noise (whatsoever) in the evening.",5,2019,03,25
222,very good quality and comfort in a relaxed hotel,Have stayed here on many occasions and ive never been disappointed. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the rooms are super clean with excellent coffee machines and handy tech.  Some rooms even have saunas for an uber relaxing stay.  I cant recommend this great place enough.,5,2019,03,21
222,"Great place, close to city center!",House was very clean and has all the facilities you need. We stayed here with a group of 9 and there was enough room for everybody. City center is at walking distance and bus to airport stops in front of the hotel. I would definitely recommend this place to others!,5,2019,03,19
222,Excellent place to stay in Dublin,"Very comfortable room, extremelly well decorated and the staff is really helpful and nice. 
I was there for 2 nights and wish i could have stayed for more days. Its close to the city center and main attractions about 25 min walk (if you like to walk) and otherwise there is a bus stop to and from the city center right outside the door",5,2019,03,19
222,The Roxford is a hidden gem!,"I've stayed at the Roxford Lodge several times now and it always exceeds my expectations. I always feel right at home with Agnes and Des--it's like they're family! They love Americans, by the way. If you stay, please tell them that ""Cousin Mark from America"" sent you. (They'll know who you're talking about!)",5,2019,03,13
222,Very comfortable room and delicious breakfast !,"Location is perfect, near the city center. Parking is fine and free. The hotel and people who worked there are lovely. The perfect place to stay in a calm and nice area. (Continenal) breakfasts are delicious (toasts particularly).",5,2019,03,12
222,Absolutely fantastic stay,Our family stayed here for one night and we were sorry we had to leave. House was gorgeous with a huge living room to chill. When we arrived a lady arrived with fresh brown bread and milk. Highly recommended staying here.,5,2019,03,04
222,Best in Dublin,"Wonderful room with modern conveniences in an attractive, traditional building, located in a quiet residential area with excellent connections to conveniences, the center of town and to the airport. Friendly, helpful staff.",5,2019,03,02
222,Perfect stay,"Roxford Lodge is a really nice hotel and very quiet. With lovely rooms and confortable bed.
Location is great. Near the city center, only 10minutes walk
You even have Jacuzzi bath in your room :)
Thank you very nice personnel",5,2019,03,01
222,Over all great stay ,We stayed in one of the houses at the back of the hotel and had no over all complaints. The only negative was that when we turned up at 2.15pm (15 minutes after our check in time) we were told the house wouldn’t be ready until 3pm. As we had travelled from England and we were only in Dublin for one night we didn’t appreciate having to waste valuable time waiting to get in to the room to freshen up. That being said we had no other complaints and will return if and when we visit Dublin again.  ,4,2019,02,28
222,Really great place to stay.,"I have stayed in the Roxford Lodge many time, beautiful house, great attention to detail, everyone is always helpful and friendly.

Lovely location.

My first choice to stay in Dublin is always the Roxford Lodge Hotel

Ciaran",5,2019,02,22
222,Everything about it was perfect,"The hotel staff was very nice and helpful at all times. The room had everything we needed for our short stay, it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We also would recommend it for the location, as the hotel is situated in a lovely neighbourhood that's 15 minutes walking from Grafton Street. Also, breakfast was delicious! 10/10!!",5,2019,02,20
222,Nothing but excellent,"I have stayed at Roxford Lodge Hotel  few times and would consider this place as an exceptional and it would be my first choice at all times. 
I do often stay at other hotels and guest houses in the area , but this is an exceptional place and would be my first choice any time, depending on availability of course. 
Rooms are so well equipped and immaculately clean, that you just dont want to leave. 
The best treat is the superior suite , at such a high standard you would not find a room like this in Dublin even if you looked, with its own private Sauna and Jacuzzi, makes the stay so relaxing. 
Great staff and delicious breakfast, what else could you ask for. 
I am not an easiest person to be pleased, but this hotel has overcome any of my expectations.
Big thank you to all at Roxford Lodge Hotel 
Excellent and strongly recommend",5,2019,02,18
222,Very comfortable stay.,"The young Mexican lady at reception was very professional and made me feel at home. I was early but my room was ready. It was very clean and quiet like I asked for. She informed me about breakfast and gave me codes for doors etc. 
Breakfast was fantastic I really enjoyed it. 
Prices are good, bed comfortable good breakfast what more could you ask for.

222,Great value - would stay again,"The hotel staff are very friendly, breakfast was very nice, and the hotel itself is quite near to different restaurants, shops, etc. Additionally, the location is not that far from St. Stephen's Green. Would stay again.",5,2019,02,10
222,Tidy place in nice area,"This is my first trip to Ireland and I stayed here for 5 nights after I was told by my Irish partner that this is a good area to stay. Loved the location and most of what I wanted to see was close by within walking distance. Convenient car park although tricky to find at first. Reception staff were always lovely. Room was clean and tidy although I paid a little more for a superior room I didn’t get a jacuzzi as expected and the king bed was 2 beds pushed together, which was very uncomfortable if we happened to lie across it. Not a bad place but just average.",3,2019,02,04
222,A great find,"Really pleased to find this place...so reasonable compared to central Dublin. A real oasis of calm with all mod cons...really cannot recommend enough.
We stayed in a treble room and whilst it was ""compact"" it was more than adequate for us.",5,2019,02,04
222,Cannot fault,Really enjoyed our stay. ..cannot fault .Mariana was very friendly and helpful...a real asset to the Roxford Lodge. ..room spotless. .lovely and warm on a very very cold night. ..ideal location for the Aviva. ..will definitely return. .thank you,5,2019,02,04
222,One night stay for business purposes,"Excellent Hotel. Nothing over the top, but everything seems to have been thought of.
All the benefits of a smaller hotel such as quick check in / check out, accommodating staff. This hotel even had an iron and ironing board, items which are strangely absent from many , much more expensive hotels.
The building itself is effortlessly clean and well specified and the location is a walking distance for many south city office locations",5,2019,01,25
222,Great stay,"Great hospitality, friendly, nice and helpful staff, clean room. Good location, walking distance from city center, bus station in front of the hotel. Very quiet neighbourhood. Very good full Irish breakfast.",4,2019,01,22

222,Unique hotel making use of a variety of room shapes and sizes.,"Our room with two twin beds was great for a father and daughter like us. They squeezed a comfortable sauna in one end of the room, a bathroom with a marginally functional jacuzzi in the other. The staff was very friendly. The ""continental"" breakfast included hot oatmeal, cold ham and cheese, and yogurt in addition to the fresh fruit, cold cereal, etc. that I had expected. Our walk to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells took about 20 minutes at a modest pace. They also serve dinner, but we did not have time to use that service.",5,2019,01,12
222,Great stay in Dublin,"We are so grateful for the warm Dublin hospitality we received. The location is conveniently walking distance to town, train & Airlink bus to the airport.  Highly recommend to travellers with family with more than ample space for everyone. We very much enjoyed our time in Dublin.",5,2019,01,12
222,Great for overnight stay,"Great location, great breakfast choice cooked to order,friendly staff, safe parking at back of hotel, - what more do you want. Standard double room was a little small but had everything you need. Would definitely stay again.",4,2019,01,10
222,Great value,"Economy room was very clean, comfortable and well equipped. Lovely breakfast and staff friendly and helpful. Aircoach from the airport stops 100 yards up the road so very convenient. We enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,01,08
222,Best Hotel I ever stayed in,"What you get for the price of the executive suite is amazing - sauna, great shower, huge jacuzzi, two tvs (one smart TV), balcony, Bluetooth speaker, king sized comfy bed. Can't fault it. Nice staff too. I will definitely return and recommend to others as a treat. ",5,2019,01,05
222,what a gem,"we booked the family room for one night so we could go to Les Miserables at the Bord Gais theatre - what a gem of a place this is and we would love to return to use it again. We had the family room for us parents and an 11 yr old and 14 yr old. Spacious, comfortable and beautifully decorated. It must have been a fine drawing room in Victorian times, the lovely plaster coving, ceiling rose and large windows remain. A decent bathroom with a wet room shower and a bath and two sinks. A surprise was a sauna - we didn`t get to use it as we didn`t have enough time
Parking is behind the hotel, perhaps 8-10 spaces in a secure area, lovely to know that we could leave our car in a safe place
Staff were friendly and helpful with local info. We walked to nearby Baggot Street to eat - a choice of price ranges and nice pubs there, just 5 minutes away
the Bord Gais theatre is in the opposite direction, a 15 minute walk that felt safe both at 6pm and at 11pm
We had not initially booked breakfast but decided to at the last minute - continental was more than adequate, lots of selection - fruits, cereals, toast, bread, cheeses, ham, toast, tea or coffee - fabulous and all served by a lovely friendly lady
I wouldn`t hesitate to recommend Foxford Lodge, it is a great location, with lovely rooms and super staff - it is a gem",5,2019,01,04
222,Very Nice,The staff was very nice. The breakfast was tasty & freshly cooked. It’s the best breakfast I’ve had in a hotel in this price bracket for quite a while. The room was clean and had a DVD player & a selection of DVDs. ,4,2019,01,02
222,Incredibly welcoming and comfortable,"We just needed a place to stay overnight after arriving into Dublin on a late, much-delayed ferry. 
The night porter waited up for us and showed us to an incredibly spacious and comfortable family room where we all crashed out and slept really well. Breakfast was magnificent - a wide choice of hot and cold, home-cooked and healthy food. 
The staff made us so welcome, and we will definitely return here sometime in the future. A great find.",5,2019,01,01
222,Fantastic holiday airbnb,"Stayed abt 1 week, what a place:

So what are u waiting for, u miss this boy I miss the best Airbnb in Dublin",5,2018,12,28
222,Excellent Setvice Clean & Comfiest beds ever!,We booked a family room with sauna and jacuzzi for an overnight stay in Dublin. As we have two teens we didn’t want them to have their own room but were worried as they are both six feet tall and often with a ‘fanily’ Room it’s asdumed they will be ok in small cramped bunk beds etc We were so pleased with the full sized beds spacious room dvd selection sauna jacuzzi iPod and the excellent service from friendly staff ensured we will use this hotel every year for our Dublin visit.,5,2018,12,22
222,Superb customer service,"Booked last minute and landed in our feet with this choice. Great space and standard of accommodation, they were  kind enough to upgrade us to a 4 bed property. It was the welcome we received and the extra thoughtful extra items provided that made such a difference .... highly recommend",5,2018,12,21
222,Excellent hotel just outside Dublin centre,"This hotel is fantastic quality way above for the price  they charge. Very friendly staff great location, we were at the 3Arena for a concert. It is within walking distance of the arena so good for that venue and city centre.Full Irish breakfast in morning was really good,the hotel was very clean and well maintained.Will definitely not this hotel again.",5,2018,12,17
222,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel especially nice at this time of year with the Christmas light on, staff very friendly and helpful, great to have parking, room we stayed in was very nicely decorated and beds where very comfortable.",5,2018,12,12
222,A nice cozy hotel room,"Everything was taken into thought in detail, and it was nice that they even had a drinking water pipe in the bathroom.

I was also impressed by a handy in the room. 

All in all, this is a very nice hotel, and the staff was super helpful and nice! There's a bus stop right in front of the hotel and there are three lines are running, which is very convenient. There could be noises if you have a room next to the parking lot. 

The only drawback for me is probably that it's so far away from city centre. Walking wasn't a problem for me, and I just felt that I spent a little more time traveling around because of staying here. But this is fully my own planning error.

By the way, don't fully rely on your Google Map Navigation when you go to this hotel. You might be led to the back alley and enter from the parking lot.",4,2018,12,09
222,"Convenient, comfortable, clean, cosy","My single room was comfortable if small, just about room for one person. Lovely to have a jacuzzi bath though! Breakfast was fine, nothing special but perfectly adequate. Ham & cheese plate a bit unusual! Pleasant staff too. Great location. Really impressed with the free Handy phone! ",3,2018,12,05
222,Looking forward to returning,"Enjoyed the visit immensely.

Only hiccup was not sure where the carpark was, but very quickly sorted when I parked outside and ran in...the receptionist also mentioned to not bother bringing luggage in to the check in desk as we would be passing our room anyway and have to take it back again

Room very nice and had a sauna and whirlpool bath, a kettle and a pod-coffee machine for refreshments and a handy gismo already logged into WiFi

Bed very comfortable and cosy bathroom

Didn’t have any meals on the hotel as we basically enjoyed wandering the City from early morning till fairly late.

The reception staff were very friendly and I will definitely come back here as and when I return to this lovely city",5,2018,12,01
222,All round awesome.,"Ful disclosure. I know one of the people that run this hotel. However, I know him so long that he isn't immune to critique. Happily all good here. I stay in hotels over 100 nights per annum for work. The positives here include
Excellent no log in Wi-Fi
Good iron.
Great bed
Nice decor
Nice professional staff
Quiet
Spotless
Good tv. 
Near good pubs and eateries
My room had a Nespresso machine..
Those nice key pads instead of slots
Brollies to borrow.

Wasn't there for breakfast. Will stay again and will recommend. 
Very near Lansdowne road and baggot st. 15 to 20 minutes walk to town.
Excellent.

",5,2018,11,26
222,Beautiful room,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for two nights.  Upon entering we weren’t quite sure what to expect, because the reception area was so small and it looked a little dated. We were showed up to our room by the nice receptionist and we were pleasantly surprised!  The decor of the room is super cute and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is not very spacious but who can be mad about that with heated floors.  The only complaint we had was it was a little noisy. I would definitely recommend earplugs. (We stayed in the classic deluxe double room)",4,2018,11,19
222,Fabulous,"This gorgeous, charming establishment was the perfect location for going to the Aviva.. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.. The bedroom was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.. Breakfast was wonderful... Can't wait to come back again..",5,2018,11,18
222,Great boutique hotel in a fantastic location,"This boutique hotel is ideally located close to Ballsbridge, a short walk for Dublin city centre. 
The hotel itself is well decorated, comfortable and the in-room facilities were excellent. 
The room was small but well appointed and featured a coffee maker, fridge, safe, comfortable bed, chair and workspace. There were plenty of plug sockets. 
The bathroom was large and the bath itself featured jacuzi jets. It also featured filtered drinking water on tap which was a welcome bonus. 
The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful; I was shown right into my room from the front desk and room service was prompt and friendly. 
The hotel also has secure parking at the rear which is a real plus in Dublin. 
Given its location this hotel is great value for money and I would definitely return.",5,2018,11,13
222,Lovely place,"I was in Dublin overnight for a course and although I wouldn't normally stay somewhere like this the location and fact that is had parking made it perfect. I was travelling solo so I normally prefer larger hotels with a larger common area however I was impressed with the lodge and would stay again. The staff were very helpful, nothing was too much trouble, the room as it was a single was a bit cramped however was fine for one night and although my room was over looking the main road I didn't hear a thing and slept soundly all night. I would certainly return again, the lodge definitely has a certain kind of charm about it.",4,2018,11,12
222,Lovely place to stay,"Very nicely presented, they have thought of everything all the little things, very comfortable beds, ladies at reception very helpful and friendly. Nicely decorated, great to have parking available and overall a positive experience.",5,2018,11,08
222,This Lodge Rocks!,"As I was going to a gig I was looking for accommodation close to the 3 Arena and happened to come across the Roxford Lodge when searching. Rooms were hard to come by in the city as it was the October Bank Holiday weekend and the marathon crowd were swarming thru the streets!
Roxford Lodge is located in the leafy suburbs of D4 however is only a 15/20 min straightforward walk to the 3 Arena. The hotel itself is an original large old Victorian style dwelling but the interiors are thoroughly modern. Parking is located @ the rear of the property but very easily accessed. The room itself was probably one of the best I've stayed in the city. Very reasonably priced too. Modern decor with a lot of extra touches (ie. dvd player/selection of dvds, nespresso style coffee machine, jacuzzi style bath, local mobile phone for use but to name a few). Obviously as I was only staying the one night and attending a gig (Van Morrison) I did not get to try many of these extras! 
A few steps out the back entrance lies Ryans Beggar's Bush a nice old style Irish pub where I stopped for a few pints of Guinness on my way to the gig. Upon returning I had a great sleep - comfortable bed and a very peaceful/quiet hotel! Breakfast was very good too with a large and varied selection of items. I took a walk around the area afterwards. The Grand Canal is but a few steps down the road and as other reviews have mentioned the Aviva stadium is also very close to the property. Check in & check out were very quick and all the staff were friendly & welcoming. In conclusion I would recommend Roxford Lodge very highly.",5,2018,11,06
222,Gorgeous room! ,"Our stay at the Rockford Lodge Hotel was wonderful. Our room was gorgeous with high ceilings and beautiful drapes and bedding, the bathroom had a separate thermostat with heated floors and a towel warmer, everything felt very luxurious. The location was very convenient, about a 15 minute walk to Trinity College. Free parking in a gated lot was also a plus. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. If we come back to Dublin we would stay here again. ",5,2018,11,03
222,Gig night,"Stayed for one night and we weren't disappointed. We will definitely be back. Clean, reasonable price and plenty of room. It was thirty minutes approximately from the room to the venue but on a dry night it was a lovely walk.",5,2018,11,02
222,Great overnight stay,"Very clean hotel room, small but well equiped, enough for one night. Close to 3 Areana and avviva stadium. Staff also very nice. Didn't get breakfast but was avaiable until 10.30. 
Big bath and shower pleanty of hot water. Free parkibg on the back.",5,2018,11,01
222,Solo travel in Dublin,"The Roxford Lodge is a very nice place to stay outside of city center Dublin.  I had a small, clean room that had great in-room accommodations.  It was just right for myself (I also felt safe staying here).  A nice surprise was a tub with jets!! That was awesome after a long day touring.  My only thought is that because it is 20+ min walk back to the city center, learn the bus system.  The bus stop is right outside the hotel's front door.",5,2018,11,01
222,Nice hotel great quiet location,We had a nice stay at Roxford Hotel in Dublin. The area is quiet and a nice change from the busy downtown area which is walking distance.  Our room was cozy but a little bit small but had a nice size shower and bathroom. The parking can be a bit tricky in the back if you're not from the area due to a narrow alleyway. Hotel staff was nice and accommodating an quickly resolved an issue with the power. There was some construction in the room next to us that starting around 10:00 AM.,4,2018,10,29
222,A Great Option,The Roxford is a 25 minute walk to downtown Dublin and a bus stop nearby to and from the airport. It's in a quiet neighborhood and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful with any questions we had. A sliding glass door allowed access to cool air and a small balcony. We did not use the sauna in our room. My only complaint is that the shower leaked water all over the floor making it slippery and messy.,4,2018,10,22
222,Quiet place to stay in Dublin,"This was a great place to stay while touring Dublin for a couple of days. It's a 20 minute walk into the city center and also has a bus stop right outside the door. Our room was small but cozy, had a very comfortable bed and was very quiet and clean. The continental breakfast was very good with efficient, friendly service. The staff were all very helpful and friendly.",4,2018,10,20
222,A little room for improvement. ,"We enjoyed staying at the Roxford lodge. We found the room to be very nice and comfortable. The staff was very friendly, attentive as well as helpful. I only wish that breakfast was included in the price. I felt the price was on the high side and would be more justified if a breakfast which was included. ",4,2018,10,18
222,What an awesome hotel,"This place is an absolute gem and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. So many amazing little touches! Nespresso machine, DVD player and a selection of DVDs, a relaxation CD even! Extra blanket, iron and ironing board, jacuzzi bath, free use of a Handy smart device. An umbrella!! Bed was super comfortable. Everything was immaculately clean and the staff were amazingly helpful. 

Highly recommend this as a place to stay in Dublin.",5,2018,10,18
222,Fawlty Towers in Disguise,"Don't be mislead but he fresh and bright white image of a chic bedroom on this places website. It is not the 'boutique style' or 'elegant Victorian townhouse' it purports to be. It is no more than a 4/5 storey multi-occupancy type set up with a labyrinth of rooms and creaky staircases. There is a small porch hole for reception and a fairly random evening machine at the base of the stairs. When we entered the main house we are struck by a strong musty smell. We were charged 130 per night excluding breakfast and asked for their best room given that it was our anniversary. 
We were shown to our room number 117 and noticed an even stronger musty/damp smell. The decor was very old and tired. Walls and the ceiling had large patches unpainted and tile flooring near to the window was cracked and dirty. 
At first glance we thought there was a standalone chalet style wardrobe, which upon closer inspection turned out to be a 1970s style hot room/sauna. You would struggle to fit one seated person inside this contraption and the electric elements inside did not look safe at all. Externally the controls were not working and there was an old car radio/CD player attached to to it for 'inside sauna entertainment'. 
The bathroom smelt of sewage. At this point my wife broke down and we decided to leave and book into another venue in Dublin.
The Roxford Lodge Hotel masquerades as something that it is not. It is old, damp, smelly  and in desperate need of modernisation.",1,2018,10,17
222,Small hotel with character in great location,"Roxford Lodge Hotel is located in a Victorian building with 19th century charm in a wonderful part of Dublin.  Our double room was quiet, spacious, comfortable and very clean with a modern and large bathroom.  Our room had a small balcony that overlooked some homes in this upscale neighborhood.  The room - not the bathroom - contained a large sauna which we didn't use.  .Breakfast, not included in the room price but very reasonably priced, was served in an attractive room overlooking the small front garden and included self-serve juices, cereals and yogurts.  A plate of meat and cheese and delicious Irish soda bread was included in the price and was served to us.   We were able to walk from the hotel, passing the American embassy, to a wonderful restaurant called ""The Girl and the Goose"" in about 15 minutes.  Walking in the opposite direction, we reached the heart of Dublin in an easy walk of about 20 minutes.  On the way, we stopped into the outstanding French bakery ""Hansel and Gretel"" on Clare Street (I know, it's not a French name, but I'm a pastry snob and this bakery is delicious) for flaky croissants and other sweets.  Roxford Lodge Hotel is an excellent choice if you prefer a small hotel with character to a large chain.

    ",5,2018,10,14
222,Perfect small hotel in an ideal location!,"Very friendly staff. We got upgraded to the executive suite which was huge, and included a jacuzzi bathtub and sauna. The room included 2 hair dryers, hair straighteners, iron, mini fridge, travel buddy smart phone, curved smart tv, DVD player and a selection of DVDs. Hotel is very clean, couldn't ask for any better. Quiet location, perfect for events in Aviva stadium RDS and 3 arena. Will definitely be returning again!",5,2018,10,14
222,Jetted tub,I arrived early am from the US and was relieved and delighted to find that my room was available.  The room was small as expected but the beautiful bathroom with jetted tub was a real bonus.  Helped to get me back on my feet and out the door to explore all the sights which were within an easy walking distance.  The hotel is located just beyond the Grand Canal in a pleasant area just south of the Georgian townhouses and the National Gallery.  Also an easy stroll to breakfast in the morning as I didn't eat at the hotel.  The bed was comfy and the room was quiet.  Couldn't have made a better choice.,5,2018,10,13
222,Wonderful Stay in Good Location,"Stayed three nights.  Room was on small side, but very comfortable and clean and good lighting.  Large bathroom with jetted tub.  Nice coffee pot in room; best one on our 14 day trip.  In-room safe.  Breakfast was optional with hotel reservations.  We did not choose, as I thought it too pricey at the time, but, we did have breakfast on our last morning and it was delicious.  Walking distance to everything; if you are a walker.  Quiet area.  Great restaurants a few blocks away.  Searsons for dinner and Beanhive for breakfast were our favorites.  ",4,2018,10,13
222,A delightful hotel in a quiet part of Dublin,"Checking in to the Roxford was a very pleasant experience because the young woman who was at the desk was so helpful.  When we got to our room we were pleased by the looks of the furnishings and the bathroom.  The breakfast table included fruit, breads, juices and cereals.  In addition we had the option to pay the extra cost for a cooked breakfast.  The check out experience was equally easy and pleasant.",5,2018,10,12
222,This establishment doesnt know what it is,"First off I will say I did sleep well and the bed was comfortable. Roxford Lodge is located in a very clean and well kept area that is easily accessible to downtown Dublin and is only a short walk from a few pubs. This establishment suffers from not really knowing what its purpose is. Is it a B&B, is it a hotel, a lodge, a motel? It tries do check all of these boxes and it does not do any particular one very well. I will say if you book threw their website then be aware that your nightly rates DO NOT include Breakfast. It is an additional $6/Continental and $12/Full Breakfast per day/per person. Upon arrival we were immediately rushed into a room. (There are a few rooms on their website and none of the rooms shown you are likely to receive). Our initial room was still in disrepair and within 5 mins of arriving we immediately met the maintenance staff who inquired whether we would be leaving the room for a period of time so he can repair a few items. My wife and I decided that we did not want that room and elected to wait another 3 hrs for a better room. The room we ended up staying in had a leaky toilet, a shower head protruding from the ceiling and the room itself was constructed haphazardly to incorporate a hallway for more rooms. Roxford Lodge was the low point of our visit to Dublin. If Roxford Lodge wants to return to quality then I would recommend downsizing the number of rooms and focus on quality. Also please don not advertise that you except BITCOIN.",2,2018,10,11
222,"Quiet, Quaint Stay","Lovely stay at a quaint hotel. Close enough to city center to walk, but far away enough to be quiet. Having the free parking and breakfast is a plus! We also arrived very early in the morning and not only did they give us tea, but they found an open room for us - very kind of them!",4,2018,10,11
222,Very nice local hotel,"Great venue, local to where I needed to be. The facilities were very nice (the in room sauna a real bonus), if I had to change one thing it would be the hair dryer and get something with a bit more power.",5,2018,10,10
222,"Charming, but More of a B&B/Guesthouse Than a Hotel","I booked this room directly through TripAdvisor. The description stated that it would accommodate two people, however, I am very glad I was travelling alone, as there is no way two people could have slept in the room unless someone was on the floor. 

The Roxford Lodge is an old converted house, with lots of twists and turns to get to the room. I remember the door being opened and thinking, ""This is Hobbit sized."" The room was very small, even by European standards. This is more like a guesthouse or BnB than an actual hotel. 

This would not have been an issue in and of itself, however, there were other items that were definitely less than ideal for the price: 
- Ability to adjust the heat was limited, and it was quite cold in the evening. 
- The location of the room I was in was right by the door - which slams quite loudly when people go in and out. I was woken up at midnight, 3 am, 5 am and 6 am by people coming in and out. 
- There is absolutely no soundproofing between rooms or rooms and the hall - a family was talking loudly in their rooms and the hall about a hairdryer at 7:30am to the point that I had to ask them to please keep it down. 

This is definitely not a place to stay if you want a good night of sleep, which is unfortunate, as I chose to stay farther out of town thinking that the hotel would be quieter than those that are in the core (and offering earplugs so their guests can sleep through the racket). In hindsight, I would have stayed elsewhere. 

The staff was lovely, though - check in went well, and they printed my boarding pass for me when I left. The location is two blocks up from the AirCoach express that goes to the airport. It's about a 20-25 minute walk into the main part of town. The room also has a Nespresso machine, which is a nice touch, as many hotels in the country only seem to provide instant coffee.",3,2018,10,09
222,Absolutely gorgeous!,What a beautiful building with the most quirky and equipped rooms. I mean the room had everything and such character and warmth. They even had some DVDs beside the tv and the bed was so cosy. Staff were extremely helpful and would recommend a stay here to anyone. 10 minute walk into town was so easy and parking available on site. Want to go back!,5,2018,10,08
222,"Unprofessional, unaccommodating and inconvenient.","Our stay at Roxford Lodge was less than pleasant. Upon arrival, my wife and I went to the front desk to check in with Maria. There were a few reasons we picked this accommodation - they were the most affordable hotel in Dublin, they had a laundry service, they offered a full Irish breakfast that could be added to your stay, and they were relatively close to the sights in-town. When we asked Maria about laundry service though, we were told, ""Oh no, we don't have a laundry service"", and when pressed her response changed further to, ""our laundry service is basically that we go to the local laundromat with your laundry, quote the price and add it to your bill. We also need 24 hours notice."" Uh, what? That's not like any laundry service I've ever heard of, and frankly they shouldn't be able to list that as a benefit on the site - laundry service means done on-site in a reasonable amount of time. Then when my wife and I asked about the breakfast, we were told ""No, you didn't order the breakfast."" Both of us distinctly remember picking the reservation option that included it when we booked, but at this point we just needed to get to our room and unpack - otherwise, how were we going to have time to get our laundry, find a laundromat and take care of it ourselves?
Maria led us downstairs into room 106 - a small, dank, cave like room with stained carpet that had a window facing right out onto the street. Though issues were piling up, we thanked her and began to settle in as best we could, since we still had much to do.

Once we arrived back to our room after a long stressful trip to the laundromat and a few clothing outlets, we decided to try the jacuzzi bathtub. I was very disappointed that room 106 did not have the personal sauna featured in many of the pictures of the rooms. When my wife finished with the bath, she noticed a layer of dirty grime had accumulated at the water line in the tub, as if the jets had not been run in ages and collected dust. I know the dirt wasn't off us as we'd showered that morning and done no extremely dirt attracting activities. After we'd showered, we noticed that a bright purple light was blasting into our room. I walked over to the window only to see that it was some form of ground spotlight that was intended to illuminate the front of the building - why any establishment would A) set a floodlight to blaze on it's windows, and B) pick UV-tanning-bed purple, I have no clue. Even with the blinds closed, the room was bathed in an alien abduction colored tinge. By this point my wife and I were both fed up and headed to the front desk. We spoke to Maria, and told her this room would not be anywhere near acceptable. When asked if they had any other rooms, her response was a curt, ""Nope, we are fully booked""; a far cry from earlier that day when she had expressed surprise at our length of stay, stating, ""most people only stay two or three days!"" When my wife pressed harder on the matter, stating we would be forced to cancel the rest of our reservation and go somewhere more accommodating, her response was a bizarre  ""that's fine"". I can't think of a hotel that would rather sacrifice a thousand euro instead of work with their customers. Frustrated, we went back downstairs to our dungeon and began to look for other lodging. My wife had the genius idea to call TripAdvisor (thank God), and spoke with a very pleasant lady who listened to the mess we'd dealt with so far patiently. She put us on hold while she spoke with Maria, and when she got back to us she noted that the manager would be spoken to first thing in the morning.

When we woke to head out for the day, we were greeted at the front desk by the owner, who asked us if our room was ok. Detailing the list of complaints to her, she asked if most of our stuff was packed and said she would check with the booking staff once they arrived and see about moving us - not sure what was so difficult about this for Maria. We thanked the owner and headed out for the day. When we arrived back at the hotel, we were told by a different front office woman that our luggage had been moved to a different room on the first floor that faced the back of the hotel. This solved ninety percent of our issues with Roxford Lodge, but I feel they needed to be documented for future travelers considering these lodgings. A few further notes - in the hotel, there were at least five different unsecured ""Roxford Lodge Hotel"" wifi points. This is a major security issue, and during our stay I had an Amazon account password reset email that I did not request, so at least one of those wifi points was a data leech I suspect. The other point is the ""free phone"" they offer you - they encourage you to log into your google account and download apps with it. After the whole unsecured wifi thing? No way. Also, the location - while a twenty minute walk from city center, it is actually more like an hour to some of Dublins finest attractions like Kilmainham, so get used to walking or calling taxis.

All in all, I would not recommend any other travelers stay here. They make false claims of their amenities, and the front office staff are largely unhelpful. And for God's sake, make sure you don't book room 106.",1,2018,10,06
222,Outstanding!,Absolutely outstanding accomodation. Great location just slightly out of Dublin away from the hubbub but with a bus stop right out the front that takes you straight into town. Gorgeous room and excellent service all for exceptional value. Couldn’t fault this place!,5,2018,10,05
222,Nice room - highly recommended,"I was in Dublin for a Conference in the Aviva stadium, which was 10 minutes to walk.
The bus to the airport is 3 minutes by walk.
The room is nice clean and the bed is soft and cosy. It was a nice stay!",5,2018,10,01
222,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Staff, Excellent Location","Stayed here for a wedding in Dublin. Safe Parking. No problem in getting Taxi, Bus or walking into the city centre. Google maps brought me straight to \hotel Car Park. Arrived early and staff got my room ready a hour early.
Had drinking water and Coffee machine in bedroom. Lovely full Irish Breakfast.
Will definitely stay again.",5,2018,09,30
222,Great find,"Stayed here twice both occasions were weddings in Dublin. The first time we stayed in one of the houses and this time in the hotel. We can recommend both, very friendly staff, rooms very comfortable and clean and quiet. There is everything you require in the rooms down to drinking water in the bathroom. Our bedroom had a balcony which was nice extra as the sun shone down in us. We didn’t have breakfast but other family members  staying over said it was very good. It’s a nice 20 min stroll into Dublin centre. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit.",4,2018,09,29
222,A top-notch boutique hotel near city center,"We loved staying at the Roxford Lodge - a lovely hotel in a great location (easy walking distance to Trinity College and plenty of excellent restaurants nearby).  Our room appeared to be recently updated with high quality carpet, curtains, and bedding and the bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was modern and clean.  The room was very quiet even though it faced a busy street.  Parking was a challenge since the it was very tight when all the spaces were taken.  Breakfast was not included but was good.  I would definitely stay there again and would suggest this hotel to friends.",5,2018,09,27
222,very nice hotel in good an quite location,"Reasonably priced hotel in excellent and quite location in Dublin in walking distance to city center. Rooms very clean and with sufficient space.
Excellent breakfast service offered.
Staff very helpful.",5,2018,09,22
222,Perfect Comfortable Overnight Venue,"I stayed here after a night out on the town with work on the 7th September.

The venue provides parking to the rear on arrival and the check-in service is very friendly and efficient.

Although small, I was VERY impressed with the single room and bathroom /shower facilities. Everything was meticulously clean, and not ‘worn’ looking. Also,there were excellent tea and coffee making facilities including a Nesresso machine !

Internally, there are many corridors and stairs : this is a compact premises, and the competitive accommodation rate reflects this.

The external windows were sound-proofed for street noise, so no disturbed sleep !

I did not have breakfast, but see that it’s €6 for a Continental, and €12 for the Full Irish ... seems reasonable !

Would recommend and would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,22
222,excellent option,"I know of many much more expensive places whose rooms are not as good.  This is a model of a small hotel for the modern age - well thought out room with excellent touches (free smartphone/internet, small inroom jacuzzi, good cosmetics and bedlinen, excellent bed, DVD player with a selection of movies, room had a balcony) - a well thought out and well priced offering. I'll use this again. Car park is a bit tight.  Overall, for the money it's excellent.  Maybe I got one of the best rooms?  (117).  Didn't have breakfast but the menu looked good.",4,2018,09,20
222,Quaint but the executive suite is very very nice and reasonably priced.  And great location,"The executive suite is very nice with dry sauna and jacuzzi and a wonderfully comfortable bed, also very spacious including an outdoor balcony.  Great value for money.  Don't have a clue what regular rooms are like but highly recommend the suite.",4,2018,09,20
222,Quaint Lodging,"We loved our stay at Rockford Lodge! The staff is very friendly and helpful, our room was clean and comfortable, and it is a short walk to the city centre. They also offer a lovely breakfast. If we come back to Dublin, we will definitely stay here again! ",5,2018,09,19
222,overall good,"The room was really small, which is common for european hotels. The biggest problem with this place was the fan in our room. There was an AC/heat unit that would go on and off through the night and everytime it would stop or start, the blades on the unit would fan open and make this reaally annoying creaking noise. We needed the unit on because the room was too hot otherwise, but it drove us crazy all night. It could have just been our room, we didn't ask to switch, but i had to sleep with headphones on every night because it was so annoying. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice. There is a code for the door to come in to the building, so just make sure you remember the code. The first night we were there, we almost forgot to write it down, and i have no idea what you would do if you got back after hours and didn't remember the code. it was about a 15-20 min walk to the city, and less if you just went to some neighborhood restaurants/pubs, but the walk wasn't bad and was well lit. All of that to say, other than the fan, it was a good hotel and a good location.",4,2018,09,18
222,Great nights sleep not far from downtown,"I picked the Roxford because it had a tub or jacuzzi in the room, and looked like a really nice quiet place to get a good night's sleep on my last night. It was great on both accounts. About 20 min. walk to the downtown area but set in a quiet neighborhood that still had pub, grocery store, and some cafes in walking distance. The staff was also really friendly. I enjoyed my stay - especially the bathtub with the jets in it. I'd stay again.",5,2018,09,16
222,Pleasant Stay,"Typical guest house of its type, not far from central Dublin. Rooms were comfortable and clean and roomy enough for an overnight stay. Breakfast was good and the dining room staff very friendly. A lift is available as is on-site parking.",4,2018,09,16
222,Excellent hotel and the heart of Dublin,"The Roxford lodge is like home away from home in Dublin. It is about a 20 minute walk from city center but it is very easy to get to.  Also the four and seven buses stop directly in front of the hotel.  And there are wonderful pubs and restaurants right around the corner. 
 The main reasons to stay in this hotel is that you really feel like you’re staying in a beautiful home. The breakfast is delicious the staff is very friendly and accommodating beyond what you would expect.  We will definitely stay there again the next time we’re in Dublin !",5,2018,09,13
222,Ralph,Had a wonderful 2 night stay. Room was spacious and clean. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Couldn’t have asked for more. Neighborhood was upscale and location was convenient to all of the great sites.,5,2018,09,13
222,Excellent stay fabulouse staff! We'd return in a flash!!!,"Stayed three nights mid August. Clean, comfortable bed, nicely furnished room which had everything we needed. It was a little on the small side. We had a classic deluxe double room that was well equipped (as pictured on their site) and also had a 2 person sauna unit. Staff were fabulous, excellent hosts, helpful and very accommodating! This alone made our visit here very special.

We walked to nearby restaurants (10-15 minutes or so) every evening and also walked into the downtown area along Grafton Street. The wonderful Irish breakfast was delicious and wholesome. The wonderful lady who greeted and served us was a real doll! 

Hop on Hop off bus route was up the street - about a 10 minute walk. We were able to park our rental car behind the complex as well. 

Great spot for our visit to Dublin. Thank you.",5,2018,09,12
222,Great Apartment in Dublin,"The apartment is very well kept and has all the utilities you might want when staying in Dublin a couple of days. The only two things we think could be better are:
1) the beds are relatively small, if you are tall then your feet might dangle off the end.
2) the water pressure machinery makes frequent noise, light sleepers might find this an issue, we didn't. ",4,2018,09,11
222,Quiet Location on Bus Line - In Room Dry Sauna,"Our 2 night stay was just what we wanted.  A clean, quiet location just a short bus ride from downtown.  The buses from downtown stop right in front of the door.   We had a room in the annex building in the back and it included an in-room infrared sauna that was great after a day of walking around.  Full Irish breakfast cooked to order was fine.  Other cooked choices available.  Irish Times available to read at breakfast.  Good wifi.

Nothing fancy about this place but at a reasonable price for Dublin we would stay here again.  Note:  There are steps to the reception, the rooms and to breakfast.",4,2018,09,10
222,exellent !!,"very complete experience, I had the single room, small but very good utilities for coffee making, nice TV with dvd player, spa bad, the breakfast was a bit expensive (12 euro's) if you just want an omelette.",5,2018,09,10
222,Surprisingly Good Hotel,"Service staff was top notch -- room was really nice for being small. Clearly updated as it had a nice, decorated bathrooms that were clean, safe, coffee maker, etc. Didn't taste the food but I'm sure it was lovely. Not bad to walk to center city Dublin (Grafton Street or Trinity College were about 15-20 minutes walking). Good value for money.",5,2018,09,02
222,Our new place to stay in Dublin ,"Was hard to believe that the place would be as good as all the reviews suggested but it was. From the initial correspondence all the way through to checkout the service was first class. Parking is an extra bonus to have in the city and it’s a great location.. walking distance to many restaurants bars etc. The room itself was very well equipped, Nespresso machine, fridge, tv, dvds, and to top it all... the sauna in the room. First time for everything. 
Breakfast the next morning was great. Cooked breakfast to start off the day! 
Will definitely be back once we return to Dublin! ",5,2018,08,27
222,Relaxing break,"Hotel was outstanding.Cleanest hotel I have every stayed in.Double room smaller than others I have stay in but with much more amenities. Personal sauna was fabulous ,easy to us. So nice to move from your own shower to private sauna and then bed with out leaving the room. We had a patio door opening onto a small court yard. Wonderful Espresso machine with a massive amount of available capsules. I will never stay any place else in Dublin in future.car park available at no extra change. Bus stop outside hotel . Within walking distance of Grafton Street.",5,2018,08,27
222,way way too expensive for this tired b and b,"Grim overpriced B and B with bad food and coffee.  The staff had that fake Irish thing going on which was annoying.  Rooms need refurbishing, not a bad size, but cold and lots of traffic noise all night long.",1,2018,08,23
222,Excellent accomodation,"Excellent customer service, very friendly staff. Arrived for a one night stay, excellent ammenities provided in the double deluxe room. Big tv, netfliks, dvds provided. Very nice bathroom, under floor heating. Were able to adjust the room temperature. The room was clean and beautifully decorated. Comfortable big bed. Spacious room. Free parking. Acceptable walking distance to attractions. I would definitely recommend to a friend and stay again.",5,2018,08,22
222,Convenient for Bord Gais Theatre.,"The room was well equipped, coffee maker, tv, dvd player, dvds, wifi. Tap with drinking water. Jacuzzi bath, 
Clean, comfortable beds. Well maintained.
Safe parking for your car. Friendly staff. Fine selection at breakfast. Loads of gluten free items for breakfast.",4,2018,08,21
222,Fantastic stay! ,"We stayed at Roxford Lodge for four nights and loved it. It’s in a great location - a beautiful and quiet area but still only a 15 minute walk into the heart of Dublin. There were also fantastic restaurants and cafes in the area (Farmer Brown’s, The Old Spot, Paulie’s). The hotel is beautiful and the reception staff were really helpful. Airport bus stops half a block, which is really handy! Highly recommend!",5,2018,08,19
222,Great place to stay,"We stated here to attend a show in the bord gais theatre. Within walking distance or €5-7 in cab. 

Lovely rooms, immaculately clean and very comfy beds!!

Easy to find, with private parking.

Great location. Would highly recommend staying here and great value for money.",5,2018,08,19
222,Gr8 stay,"Can't fault this property, everything spot on, from moment we arrived (early) and were accommodated to the moment we left you could not fault anything. Excellent location for RDS etc and would definitely stay again. Suite is SUPERB",5,2018,08,14
222,Flying visit,"Wish I could have stayed longer! Everything was great, will be returning and recommending to friends and family. Staff were very friendly and helpful. In a great location for theatre, stadiums and city centre!",5,2018,08,13
222,What a find!,"Although I would struggle to call this place a hotel, much more like a B&B than a hotel, but that does not take away from how lovely this place was. 
The building is of the Victorian age and therefore the rooms and corridors are an odd shape, not the norm, but I feel this gives the place lots of character, we were lucky enough to get a lovely room on the ground floor with access to a terrace outside, although we never had the need to use it and the door was locked with no key provided which made us slightly uneasy as there wasn’t a clear route out for fire escape etc. A key provided for this would have make us feel a bit more at ease in case of fire. 
The room we had was a triple room, which to our delight was 3 single beds, rather than the more expected double/single approach, this was perfect for us as we were mother and daughters. Two of the beds were beside one another with a tv, in front of them, and then round a corner/bend in the wall was the 3rd bed, which also had a tv in front of it. 
We were very impressed/surprised at the number of useful amenities in the room, the two TVs, a selection of DVDs (about 20), a smartphone you could take out to use as a Dublin guide paid for by the hotel to prevent you being stung on your own phone by roaming charges, shower bath but the shower was a waterfall shower with good water pressure, and the bath had jets in it which was so good for us as we were aching after a long day out at the RDS. 
There is a Nespresso machine, pods and a separate kettle for other hot drinks, there is a separate tap in the bathroom for drinking water which I've never seen in a hotel bathroom! 
The beds were so comfortable, that I woke up a bit disoriented thinking I was at home, rather than in a hotel. Both heating and air con in the room, which makes it perfect for all situations.

Breakfast - set price for continental 6euros and then 12euros for hot food, this was the only thing that slightly annoyed me as I only like hot toast, beans and some bacon, therefore the 12euros is extremely expensive for this, and I would struggle to justify this again, rather get something in Ballsbridge a short 10 min walk instead. Also, I would like to note the brown bread toast offered is wheaten bread, not brown bread. Food though was cooked extremely well, runny eggs, crispy bacon, all hot.

Distance to RDS was a huge selling point for us, it was 10mins walking distance if even and even better it was a 5 min walk to the Ballsbridge hotel, so made for easy walk to and from The Dubliner pub, which as we were down for the horse show was perfect. Bus stop right outside the hotel was great for the journey down, although the bus driver over charged for the journey as he didn't understand the instructions I gave him provided by the hotel (2nd stop on Northumberland road - 412). Bus back to Dublin on the Sunday evening was extremely hard to get as they kept passing us full, therefore I would advise just getting a taxi instead. 

All in all, I would stay again due to comfort of hotel, and proximity to the RDS, just a few things to improve on to make this a 5-star review and for a 3-star hotel that is impressive.",4,2018,08,13
222,Fleeting stat,"Stayed here literally 12 hours overnight for the Royal Dublin Show, we should have been there a bit longer but a delayed flight cut the trip short....but a comfy bed and great shower, very clean room with fab extra’s like an Nespresso machine, fridge, travel buddy and DVD selection and friendly, helpful staff.  Noticed a few scrape marks on the walls, but didn’t detract from the comfort and cleanliness of the room. Will book for next year. Also very close (walking distance) to RDS.",5,2018,08,11
222,Loved the Townhouses,"We were staying with 4 people in Dublin for 4 nights so we decided to rent the 4 person townhouse that the Roxford owns. When we first arrived the owner of the Roxford gave us a tour of the house and told us about the neighbourhood. 
The townhouse was located right down the street from a pub and a couple blocks from one of the Dart Stations. The house was very well kept and it had 3 floors, 3 bathrooms, and 4 bedrooms. 
One great thing about the townhouse is that when you arrive the kitchen is already stocked with a few food necessities, in case your to jet lagged to go shopping. 
If your traveling with a bigger group I definitely recommend renting one of the few townhouses. ",5,2018,08,10
222,Loved my stay!!,"I was so happy to find this lodging nearby my tour transportation, and super happy that they had great solo traveler options. I initially stayed one night in a single room with a sauna, then stayed two more nights following my tour in another single room downstairs. Both were great rooms with enough space and amenities. Location was perfect - away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet along the bus route, as well as close enough to walk to many places. I really enjoyed my breakfasts as well - great food, lots of options, and wonderfully friendly staff (desk and dining both).
This was a wonderful place to rest up and relax on a whirlwind trip. Thanks so much for your hospitality!!",5,2018,08,10
222,"Executive Suite, for the win!","We loved our two-night stay at the Roxford.  The room was beautiful, with a fully functional sauna, hot tub, comfy bed, sitting area.
Great location, far enough from the hubbub, but close enough to walk.  Great service, lovely front desk folks.
All around great experience!",5,2018,08,08
222,Lovely hotel,"Very nice hotel in walking distance of the main sites, which took 20-25 minutes. We had a classic deluxe room at the back and stayed for 3 nights. I particularly liked the Jacuzzi bath. The room also had a sauna in it but still had plenty of room.
Breakfast was very good although one one occasion they were slow to clear the table for us to eat and to take order. 
The airport bus stop was very close.
I would definitely stay again if I was to visit Dublin with just my husband.",4,2018,08,08
222,"Well located, super clean, charming smaller hotel",Really enjoyed our stay - this place doesn’t disappoint!  Loved the king sized bed - which are hard to find in Ireland.  The continental breakfast is huge with many choices.  Jacuzzi tubs and in- room saunas are also available in selected rooms.  Marianna was very helpful at the front desk. Checkin was seamless. They even have a machine in the lobby to buy plug adapters if you hadn’t brought one.,5,2018,08,08
222,"Great Find - Location, Comfort","Roxford Lodge was a great choice to stay in Dublin. Situated in Ballsbridge, it is on very useful bus routes (they are a very short walk away), and if you are inclined, walking is possible (a little far for us). It is, in fact, a short walk to the Grand Canal and the wonderful Merrion Square. It is also close to the stop for the airport bus, which was very convenient since this is definitely the best way to get to the airport.

Our room was a generous size, modern, very clean and comfortable. The en suite bathroom was excellent – a high-end unit with all the mod cons.

Included in the room was an Android device for guests use – google maps was very useful in getting around, providing the best bus lines etc. etc. This is the first time I have stayed in a hotel offering such a service.

Breakfast was in a beautifully appointed dining room. There was a generous continental breakfast as well as the “full Irish”. While neither was free, the price for the continental was quite acceptable. The “full Irish” was more but for us it was far more than we needed or wanted.

The staff we encountered was friendly and competent. There was also a sign saying that they accept Bitcoin – but apparently no one has ever used the service.

The price was reasonable – for Dublin, which is generally an expensive city. We were very pleased and can happily recommend Roxford Lodge. We will certainly return.",5,2018,08,08
222,Birthday treat for my wife,"Fabulous hotel, lovely room, great location with excellent restaurants and pubs very close by.  Under stated from outside but really lovely inside.  
Staff couldn't do enough to ensure stay was perfect, request for flowers in room was beautifully done in room.",5,2018,08,04
222,Travelers Beware!,"Booked online with Roxford Lodge, five months before visited Dublin, this July.  Was never sent a confirmation at the time of booking or as a reminder prior to my stay, as is standard in the hotel business.  Ended up staying elsewhere and received a call from them when we didn't check in.  I immediately released the room so they could re-rent it for the second night of my stay.  My card was charged for the entire reservation!  So here's the thing, Catherine. When there is a mixup in a confirmation of a reservation, it's wrong to assume it's the customers fault.  Rather then charge my credit card the full reservation, I was more then willing to forgo the cost of one night after WE realized the confusion.  To charge a traveler for the entire reservation, is more then bad ""policy"", it's probably illegal.  Catherine, let me give you my policy.  ""I will never stay or recommend your hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!""  It's too bad you wouldn't negotiate the charge to the first night.  My bet is you probably just work there and never informed the owner of the situation, hiding behind your ""policy"".  So, the review.  I guess it just didn't matter to you.  Sad. Travelers beware.",1,2018,08,01
222,Great location in Dublin,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for two nights when visiting Dublin.
All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially Mariana.  She answered all our questions about the surrounding area and let us store our luggage for a few days after check out while we were in Wales.
The rooms and bathrooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable, the hotel had air conditioning, and the breakfast for 6 euros was just what we needed before a busy day of sight seeing.
The hotel is located on a quieter street in Dublin, but within easy walking distance of Trinity College and other downtown sites.",5,2018,07,30
222,"Amazing hotel, so clean and such friendly staff!","I have just returned from my best friends hen do; I booked this hotel for 25 of us for the hen party and it was perfect! We booked 2 houses and 4 rooms in the hotel and they were all fab!
The houses were so lovely, clean and had everything you needed. The 4 bedroom house was absolutely perfect for all 25 of us to fit and sit in the lounge to play hen do games etc!
Everyone commented on how lovely all of the rooms both in the houses and in the hotel were! The beds were comfy and bathrooms very very clean. 
The staff were so friendly and helpful and it was clear they were there to make sure we were happy and having a good time. 
The hotel was about 30 mins walk into town but there are lots of pubs and places to eat within walking distance. We also booked the hop on hop off bus to see Dublin and there is a stop less than 10 mins walk from the hotel. 
Overall we all had an amazing stay at Roxford Lodge and all 25 of us would return! Perfect place for large groups and a great place to see Dublin!",5,2018,07,30
222,Great place to stay.. ,We have stayed here on a few occasions for concerts. It is a gem of a find! We stayed on Saturday when we came to see Wicked. Our room was immaculate and we honestly couldn’t find fault with this place at all. It had every amenity you could need including a sauna and jacuzzi bath. In close proximity to bars and restaurants but a bit away from the city. Love staying here ,5,2018,07,30
222,Weekend Away,The hotel was outstanding and the staff were very helpful. Great location to the city and gated parking. Nespresso in the room was a very nice touch!!! Jacuzzi bath is also nice to wake up to.  My new base in Dublin for any future trip.,5,2018,07,29
222,Excellent hotel," Very nice room, clean, quiet and comfortable. Very pleasant staff and the breakfast was good. Location a little way out of town in a quiet upscale neighborhood was exactly what I wanted. Actually used the air conditioning. Lots of local restaurants.",5,2018,07,29
222,Great little place,"I was so thankful for the air conditioning in the room, as we were there during a ""heat wave"".   Roxford Lodge has every convenience and is located in a lovely area, with bus transportation nearby.  
Our room was not ready, but they kept our luggage for us.  The only minus was the room was still not ready at the appointed time and we were left waiting in a lovely, but hot parlor.  The desk clerk brought ice water which was nice.
I would definitely stay here again!!",4,2018,07,27
222,Wicked 2018,Lovely little hotel! Unusual layout but so pretty! The air-conditioning in each room is super effective! The range of dvds and bluray player in the room was a lovely unique touch! Excellent service-helpful staff and freshly cooked breakfast! Will stay again! ,5,2018,07,27
222,Wonderful space with easy city access,"The Rockford Lodge townhome we stayed in was clean, comfortable and very easily accessible to the city centre (20 min walk).  We only stayed for a couple nights before leaving Ireland but would definitely stay again if ever in Dublin.",5,2018,07,26
222,Sat 21st July 2018,"Excellent place to stay. Catherine, the girl in reception was lovely and very helpful and the breakfast was excellent with the staff friendly and helpful at all times. Its a great location with a big room, near the Aviva stadium and I would stay here again for sure.",5,2018,07,26
222,Great Location - quiet but close,"This small hotel is located southeast of Merrion Square and St. Stephen’s Green, it was about a 10-15 minute walk.

One plus for us was the private gated parking lot in back of the hotel.  I should point out that the parking is tight back there and it seemed like there is available street parking out in front of the hotel.  (This part of town is mostly residential and pretty quiet) Since we had been driving all over Ireland, I was pleased to stash the car back in their lot for two nights and not have to worry about it.

The room we stayed in was the family room, which had 3 beds for my wife and I and our two teens.  In other towns we had to get two rooms to accomodate, which the kids liked, but my wallet did not!  Anyhow, the room was spacious, with a sauna tucked into the corner.  Funky but charrming, with 14 foot ceilings, I’d guess.

We never ventured into the dining area downstairs, since there were interesting breakfast choices within a few blocks.

Honestly this small hotel deserves 4 1/2 stars, but the staff at the front were friendly, so I’m rounding up to 5.",5,2018,07,22
222,Clean and friendly,"Beautiful, clean hotel and lovely location.  The major downfall was the parking.  It was a secure gated parking however it took us fifteen minutes to manoevre our car out of our parking spot after checking out, this was after we had to wait for another guest to move their car as they were blocking everyone parked there.  Parking should be allocated to guests and number plates taken at booking.  This was not at the fault of staff, the lady at reception was extremely friendly",3,2018,07,22
222,Mr Stephen byrne,Stay was absolutely amazing. Staff were excellent and rooms where outstanding. Also very close to restaurants and shops. The sauna and jacuzzi were just the break away I needed and the bed was great to sleep in very big I’d recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2018,07,20
222,Great experience from a brilliantly located hotel,"Anyone who does business in Dublin knows there is a shortage of hotels which gets really bad when there are trade shows. I was at Moneyconf in June and the city was very busy. I picked this hotel due to its location within walking distance of the venue, and close enough for a five minute cab ride / bus ride into the town. As I was by myself I took a single room which was small, but packed with every possible extra. It delivered on the main criteria of quietness and the hotel staff were excellent - even providing a copy bill with company address on it within minutes of asking. For business highly recommended - for couples I would defer to someone who has stayed in a larger room.",4,2018,07,18
222,Self-Catering on Lansdowne Rd - Excellent,"We stayed at Roxford Lodge 5 years ago when we first visited Dublin.  We had a great experience then and an excellent one this time around.

The self catering unit we stayed in is to the back of Roxford Lodge.  This cute townhouse is nicely maintained and has a welcoming feel to the exterior.  We had 3 double bedrooms which are nicely appointed but on the small side.  The mattress and bedding was all very clean and comfortable (one of the more comfortable mattresses on this trip).  There were 2 extra folding beds in the living room area which came in handy for our group.  The kitchen, living area, and bathrooms are all updated and very modern.  In the fridge was some milk, bread, butter and cereal in the pantry to get us started.  This is a very thoughtful touch that was appreciated by us all.  There is a small garden but no chairs to sit outside.  Overall, this place felt very spacious and comfortable.

Check-in was excellent and they allowed my adult daughter and son to access the house before my husband and I arrived.  (We were traveling from Glaslough and they arrived early that morning.)  When we arrived, the woman at check-in informed us that 2 of our kids had arrived safely and were already in the townhouse.  That is a nice touch that meant a lot to me.

There are plenty of restaurants and bars within about a 2 minute walk.  The first pub is about 30 seconds away but situated so that you don't realize it until you start your walk down the street. We never heard any pub noise.  This location is within walking distance to the stadium as well as into city centre for all the touristy things.

Ballsbridge seems to be getting more and more expensive and this is a fantastic deal for a larger group traveling together. Highly recommend.",5,2018,07,16
222,Very convenient and quiet hotel,"Lovely little place with great access to public transport as bus stops just outside the property.   Also very close to where the air coach from airport stops. The reception staff were lovely and were very helpful with any queries and needing change. 

The room was perfect and just the right size for a solo traveller. The air con was a welcome addition too in the current hot weather. The only thing was the bed...this could have been comfier as I’ve been left with a very sore back after 2 nights of no sleep. 

Excellent place for a short stay in Dublin",4,2018,07,09
222,Great stay in Townhouses,"We stayed in a 4 bedroom and 3 bedroom townhouses during the beginning and end of our 10 day group vacation in Ireland. They were very comfortable and spacious. We appreciated the basic food and beverage offerings in the kitchen (coffee, tea, toast, jam, butter, juice, etc.). They are located on the other side of the block where Roxford Lodge is located so in a very quiet neighborhood. It was also great to have the option to park at the townhouse and at the hotel after we checked out. The ladies at the front desk were warm and welcoming and full of helpful information. The only suggestions I'd make are that the hotel provide washcloths in the bathrooms (seems to be a common exclusion throughout my stay in Ireland) and paint touch up some of the walls more regularly (where guests have obviously scuffed up with their luggage).",4,2018,07,08
222,"Great price, room was a little dated, very small bathroom","For the price (and the amount of time we actually spent in the room), it can't be beat.  We went during a very warm stretch of June and the Air Conditioning was great.  Many of our friends staying at other hotels did not have AC.

The room was dated and the bathroom accommodations were as well. The shower ceiling was quite low and I had to bend down to get under the shower head.  The service and woman at the front desk was very nice.  We drove a car and their car park is behind the hotel, in the alley.  It was secured and they provide us a code.

The location of the Roxford is about 10-20 minutes walk to all popular attractions.

I would certainly stay here again with the same factors.",4,2018,07,08
222,"Comfortable, excellent location, friendly staff","I enjoyed my stay here. Comfortable and spotless, with a welcome Nespresso machine. Reasonably priced. Staff were friendly and helpful, and quick to respond to queries. I would stay again for a work trip.",5,2018,07,07
222,Very nice home,"Okay, so we stayed here for two nights and stayed in the condos outside.  Wow, very, very nice and will do so again. The location was a little too far for our senior members but overall, super comfy place.  No AC for the heat wave like most of Ireland but just had to open all the windows for the unusual weather and sun.  The condo was very big and extremely spacious for the 6 of us.  Has a nice kitchen and the staff was outstanding.  Let me reiterate the people of Ireland, absolutely outstanding and again the staff was great.  The only negative for our two senior members was a little too far from town but for the younger, it was great.  Great place to see Dublin and also close to two very good places to eat.  Thank you so much and hopefully see you in 2020!",4,2018,07,05
222,Nice hotel near Dublin city centre,"The hotel is situated in a very lovely house. Unfortunately, they have divided the space in many rooms, still nice, but too small to retain it’s earlier spendour.
It was very nice to have a secluded parking place. Dublin centre could be reached by car very easily, though the parking fees are high there.
The continental breakfast was very nice and the lady who served it was very friendly and welcoming.",4,2018,07,05
222,Beautiful room in a great location!,"This was our first trip to Ireland so when I was looking to book a place for Dublin I was unsure of the best location. Based on previous reviews, I booked the Roxford Lodge and was very glad I did. The room was beautiful and the bathroom is very large. Every amenitiy has been thoughtfully provided, in room refrigerator, etc. While there was a local phone provided we did not use it. We had rented a car for the earlier portion of our trip, so it was nice to leave it in a secure lot for the remainder of our trip. The location is a residental area which is nice and quiet. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and a local bus stop right out front. You can reach the heart of Dublin within a 10 to 15 minute walk. The staff was exceptionally nice too! Would highly recommend staying here!",5,2018,07,05
222,Excellet location and stay,The room was large and beds comfortable. Reception staff friendly and helpful.. Delicious cooked breakfast -love the soda bread. The location is good for the airport bus and a short walk into the centre for my 85 year old mother!,5,2018,07,04
222,Quaint and Comfortable,"I enjoyed my stay at the Roxford.  My room (111) was quaint, comfortable, clean and had all the amenities I needed. I was a bit concerned that it might be noisy as the room was on the road side of the hotel, but with the help of my sleep app, it was just fine.

The staff is very friendly and gave me a nice restaurant recommendation (Old Time). ",4,2018,07,04
222,Five Star Hotel,"Dublin is known for many things and stag weekends is one of them. A friend of mine booked this hotel for me and eight others as we were there for a stag weekend. 

On arrival, we were greeted by the friendly hotel receptionist who checked us in and showed me to the room. I wasn’t expecting such luxury when I saw the room. The bathroom itself had a three point shower unit, the room was air conditioned and everything was neat and clean. There was also a room smartphone you could take out with you that had built in travel map guides if you wanted to use it. 

I heard some of the rooms had jacuzzis and saunas too!

The hotel also hosts the use of full houses at the back, accessible through a rear gate that operates a four digit pin.

The rear of the hotel has a small car park too if you live in Ireland and travel to it by car. 

The hotel has a breakfast dining room downstairs complete with breakfast options to choose from. You could have cereals, yoghurts or something from the menu provided. I had the full Irish breakfast and enjoyed it. Everything seemed in just the right amounts to hit the spot 👌
Please note, breakfast isn’t included in the hotel room price so they will ask you your room number but it is well worth the extra cost of the stay.

Id stay here again for sure and ive noted it for when I eventually come back to Dublin and see the city better from outside the local bars.",5,2018,07,01
222,Charm and good cheer,"We had a wonderful stay at the Roxford Lodge.  The room was comfortable and lovely.  It was quiet and relaxing.  The location is great, a nice walk to city central and Trinity. The breakfast was very good-fresh fruit , bakery breads and granolas.  You can order a full Irish breakfast.  We are vegetarians and had no problem.  The staff were extremely friendly and responsive.  Great value for good quality stay",5,2018,06,30
222,Wonderful stay in dublin,Our family of four stayed in one of the townhouses owned by the Roxford Lodge. It was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.  It was s great location. Quiet but close enough to walk to several Dublin attractions.,5,2018,06,30
222,Great Staff,"Stayed here for 4 total nights spread over 8 days as I toured Ireland with my elderly father.  Staff was very welcoming and accommodating from housekeeping to front desk to email communication prior to stay.  Went above and beyond to satisfy us.  Gave us a choice of rooms on arrival, helped with laundry needs and transportation and held our large luggage bags for several days as we toured Ireland.

Rooms seem to vary greatly in size and our second one was super tiny.  That said it has lots of extra amenities such as dvd players with a selection of titles in the room, a smart phone you can borrow that has maps and local info and a very nice bathroom.  Condition of both rooms we had was excellent and looked recently updated.  I will caution that the property is pretty cut up and navigating can be confusing at first.  It is also not a good fit if you have mobility issues as space is at a premium in the rooms and throughout the facility.  The neighborhood is nice but was too far from the attractions we wished to visit, like Guinness and Heuston Station resulting in expensive taxi rides.  That was my fault in the planning and again, staff was fantastic!",4,2018,06,28
222,"Quiet, Comfortable, Highly Recommend","This was our first visit to Ireland and we needed a place to overnight (and sleep off jetlag) before our Best of Ireland Rick Steves tour started. We could have happily stayed a week or more here--rain or shine!  The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood, and about a 25 minute walk  along the canal or through neighborhoods to St. Stephen's Green and town center. We love walking so this was perfect.  Our room had a small fridge, dvd's, air conditioning, coffee/tea, and a sauna(for 2), plus long bathtub and a separate shower.  The breakfast was one of the best in our 18 days in Ireland, and staff was so friendly & helpful.  We were in a separate building from the main hotel rooms, out back. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,06,27
222,"Great neighborhood, friendly service, good value","Loved the location - a quiet residential area within walking distance of restaurants. Bus stop right in front if needed.  Friendly efficient service.  Had questions on the plumbing and 5 mins later someone was there to help.  Needed extra towels - again service was quick. Reception was helpful with answering questions, and there was a nice lady who served breakfast in the dining room.
Our room was very quiet. Unfortunately the view was of the parking lot but had a tiny balcony we could walk out on. Our only disappointment was the lack of closet space.
If we ever return to Dublin we would certainly consider staying again at the Roxford Lodge.",4,2018,06,27
222,Very cosy hotel,"The single room I stayed was very cosy, clean and nice. Sara and Florence were very helpful in given me all the information I needed to move around in the city. As my room was just besides the reception area, I can hear noise from people check-in and the noise from people moving the luggage bags. Other than this minus point,the room was indeed a lovely room.

Overall, I felt very comfortable and enjoyed my stay. It is quite a distance to walk to the City Center, is about 20 minutes. It is still better to travel by public bus rather than walking.  The bus stop is just outside the hotel and the frequency of the bus is about 10 minutes interval.",4,2018,06,24
222,"For the price, tough to beat - good value, and secure onsite parking","We always have the most difficult time finding good lodging in Dublin.  This hotel is definitely priced well below the average Dublin hotels.  It is clean, and moderately spacious if you spring for a larger room.  It could use some updating, but it appears that they are doing that currently.  One thing that does set it apart is the online reservation portal -- it is very sophisticated, and lets you take care of all of your check-in needs and details before you ever arrive.  Onsite parking behind the building is secure.  We did not eat the breakfast -- it was an extra charge.  We would definitely stay again, but it wasn't exceptional enough to keep us from continuing to search for the ""perfect Dublin hotel"" in the future (if such a thing exists!).",4,2018,06,23
222,Lovely hotel,"This lovely hotel is about a 25 minute walk from Grafton Street (though it was quite close to several great restaurants). The rooms were pristine, modern and beautifully decorated and appointed- each even came with a cell phone for use during your stay. A complimentary breakfast is served, though we were leaving too early to sample it (they were gracious enough to offer to open early for us, but we declined). Our room was on the small side - it might have been a little tricky to negotiate climbing over suitcases on a longer stay there (we were only there for our final night in Ireland), but our children's room was large - two beds and even a sauna! Very cool place, with an interesting and quirky set up, beautiful rooms. Parking lot in the back if you drove, and there was a bus stop right at the front door, as well.",4,2018,06,23
222,Delightfully Quirky,"Roxford Lodge is where we spent our last night in Dublin. The entire staff was super friendly, and the room was unique and fun. It had huge windows that opened fully, a spacious bathroom, and was stocked with DVDs and a player. Breakfast was served 30 minutes early upon request, and the kitchen staff was lovely.",4,2018,06,23
222,"Good standard of room, free secure car park and a nice location","Situated in Ballsbridge, a nice area near the Aviva Stadium, the Roxford is about 15 minutes walk from the National Gallery. The breakfasts are good with the Famous Clonakilty black and white pudding with the full Irish. WiFi and tea and coffee making in the rooms. Bus into town just across the road and just 20 minutes by car to the ferry port without the hassle of going through town. Good service and nice people.",5,2018,06,18
222,Family gathering,"Very friendly and helpful staff, spotless rooms, and very good breakfast. Super convenient location with public transport  at the doo.. Restaurants and bars only a few minutes walk from the hotel. Aviva stadium a 10 minute walk.",5,2018,06,16
222,Beautiful Find,"I can not say enough about this beautiful hotel.  We were so pleased with this find our night we stayed in Dublin.  The staff was friendly, the hotel was clean, location was great and the hotel was so quaint.  The room was clean and the architecture was stunning.  Definitely worth staying and not being in the city center.  Travel, either via transportation or walking, was easy and quick to get to the center of Dublin.  ",5,2018,06,12
222,Great little hotel,"This hotel definitely met my expectations. It was super clean and very nice on the inside. The parking lot was a little small, but easy to find and nice that they had one. The staff there was excellent and accommodating. The lady that ran breakfast was great! We enjoyed our breakfast each morning we were there. The room was clean and nice, but a little tight. Not a huge deal since we were only in it to sleep. Location was good. A little far from where you want to be in Dublin, but not awful. We walked it a couple of times and used a taxi  when needed like going to see the jail. Walk to Temple Bar was a 25 minute walk, so not too bad! Plus it was a good way to work off our food and beer! Overall, we were very satisfied with this hotel.",4,2018,06,11
222,A hotel that cares about its guests,"This is a lovely boutique hotel. From the warmth and friendliness of the welcome at checkin to the comfort of the bed, the gorgeous bathroom and extras such as DVD’s provided, this is clearly a hotel that cares about the comfort of its guests. Really enjoyed our one night stay.",5,2018,06,10
222,Nice!,"Located on a quiet leafy street, Roxford Lodge is a clean, pleasant hotel. It is really a substantial red-brick property which has been divided into as many rooms as possible with narrow corridors between. I had booked a double room with air-con on a booking website. In the week before arrival an issue with my credit card led to me contacting the hotel where I reiterated that I required a room with  air-con. I was assured this had been arranged. On arrival, I was told our room had no air-con & that the hotel was full! I had made this request on booking several months ago. We were shown the room which opened on to a small shared courtyard at ground level & told we could leave the door open at night if it was too warm. We didn't feel secure doing this & asked for a fan which was delivered immediately & kept the room cool that night. The room was nice but very small- barely room to walk around the bed. There was tea, coffee, a fridge & a sauna. There is a lift also which would be important to many guests.There is no bar but soft drinks, bottles of wine & beer are available to drink in the lounge/drawing room. Staff are friendly & helpful. As we were staying just one night this hotel was fine, however the room would have been too small to stay in for any longer. It bears no resemblance to those on any website I've seen which all appear bright & airy. I would recommend the hotel based on price, location,staff & a good night's sleep but it overall it just didn't 'wow' me.",4,2018,06,09
222,Located in quiet residential area,"The hotel is very nicely maintained with an excellent and accommodating staff.  Also, a great continental breakfast is available.

Only minor complaint is lack of storage space as the room we had was very small.  Bed was also smaller than what we are used to, but very comfortable.  And a hook behind thei bathroom door would have been very helpful",4,2018,06,09
222,"Fun hotel, comfortable rooms and friendly staff!",Comfortable hotel with helpful staff.  Nice restaurant / bar with great selection of adult beverages!  Good entertainment and great location!  The parking lot was conveniently located across the street and we had a hilarious time trying to get out of the gate.,5,2018,06,08
222,"Quiet, crowded, not wonderful","Due to a late flight, we didnt get to Roxford until around 630, trying to get back into downtown for musical pub crawl at 730. Unfortunately, as I approached the desk tired after being delayed at the airport, I was informed, our room wasn’t ready!!! Not expecting that at 630, needles to say we sat in the hallway as the maid hurriedly vacuumed a handicapped accesible (i am not) room for ourselves and our two teenage girls——was supposed to be their spacious family room, the only thing spacious was the cavernous bathroom. The beds were about 6 inches apart.  No showers, a quick change and a rush to downtown.  What hotel doesn’t have rooms (that were booked four months ago).  It was quiet overnight but stifling hot with no AC",2,2018,06,05
222,Clean boutique hotel with great breakfast ,"We stayed for two nights at this nice boutique hotel. The staff was friendly and very helpful, including emailing me promptly with directions from the Aircoach bus. We had an upstairs room that was very clean and modern with nice amenities and a wonderful jacuzzi tub. Our only suggestion would be to provide a fan in the room for guests on warm evenings. We kept the window open but street noise was bothersome. Otherwise it was a great stay. The breakfast lady was very sweet and gave us excellent service. Delicious full Irish breakfast that kept us full for most of the day. Easily walkable to main tourist sites in Dublin but away from the city center. Thanks for a wonderful stay! ",5,2018,06,05
222,Vacation ,Once again I am very pleased with my 3 night stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel. I received excellent customer service from Marianna and Karen. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Appreciated the hospitality I received. Thanks again!,5,2018,06,04
222,Nice location in quiet area ,"Very nice rooms and great location - just a 20 minute walk to center and in a quiet neighborhood.  Our room was very roomy and updated.  It has free, secured parking on the property.  A nice breakfast is offered.Too bad we could not stay longer.",5,2018,06,03
222,A pleasant retreat in the city,"What a nice place to come home to after a day of sightseeing in the bustling city.  Our room was large with a Jacuzzi tub perfect for tired feet at the end of the day.  A Nespresso machine, and mini fridge were nice touches.  Breakfast is served by Agnes in a lovely room overlooking the well manicured front yard.  We received excellent tips on navigating the area as well as reserving a cab for our early departure.  We couldn’t have asked for a better location for our trip to Dublin.",5,2018,05,30
222,Friendly staff and well maintained accomodation.,"Stayed two nights for rugby at the Aviva.  Easy walking distance to stadium with plenty of options in close proximity for food and drink thus avoiding city centre as well as handy transport options if required.  
Quiet leafy streets to get lost in but never far from where you need to be.
Friendly attentive helpful staff.  Room on ground floor came with air conditioning, coffee maker, DVD player and walk in shower, all very fresh and well maintained.",5,2018,05,29
222,3 bedroom house was just perfect ,"We stayed in a 3 bedroom house owned by the hotel. Parking was at the back of the hotel in a secure area and very convenient. The house was just beside this. It was so well kept and even came with breakfast foods, milk and juices. Could easily fit 6-8 people. All the facilities you would expect. Highly recommended. ",5,2018,05,27
222,Handy location and friendly staff,"We stayed here for one night, and found the location very convenient. The room had nice touches should as a coffee machine and DVDs were provided. One downside was that our TV remote didn't work, but we didn't mind this. The room was clean and well presented. Staff were nice and friendly too.",4,2018,05,24
222,Boutique Hotel Shines,"Roxford Lodge only added to the wonderful stay we had in Dublin.The newly refurbished room, great Irish breakfast and excellent service left us wondering how other Dublin hotels could possibly compete. From the ample service outlets, each with its own USB connection, to the tiered lighting and separate drinking tap in the bathroom, our room was a pinnacle of modernity. Moreovern, the location is on a main bus route with terrific restaurants a short walk in any direction. If we return to Dublin, one reason will surely be on account of Roxford Lodge.",5,2018,05,19
222,4 Bedroom House,"Lovely House, modern and well eqquiped !!! Great location !! Lovely neighborwood with pub and supermerket near by. Friendly staff. We had Very pleasant stay !! Highly recommended
We would defenitely book it again !
",5,2018,05,18
222,Quiet location and superb staff,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights recently and found the Roxford Lodge an excellent location for exploring Dublin.  Conveniently located in the Ballsbridge area of SE Dublin, one is only a 10 minute walk from Merrion Square or a short bus ride to O'Connell Bridge. The bus stop is directly in front of the property. The staff was exceptional. Everyone was helpful, warm, and welcoming and the accommodations were excellent. ",5,2018,05,14
222,Citytrip Dublin+Ireland,"We rented one of the townhouses for 8 persons. At rhe Arrival, which was very friendly, we were welcomed By one of the hotelworkers to explain the house and questions. An extra bed was brought in immediately. The house was clean, new kitchen and bathroom, very Nice, also the beds. The two persons bed is a little small, but we sleep at home in 1.80 and than a 1.60 OR 1.40 is small. There were 3 bedrooms, the others Needed to sleep in the livingroom. Not ideal, but we did not Bother ourselves, but check it to prefend surprises. We were very glad to notice there was coffee, Milk, Bread, juice and jam etc to have the first breakfaststuff. Very Nice!!! 
The distance to the heart of Dublin is fine: walkable, but by bus OR taxi very Good also. It was a clean, quiet en Nice neighbourhood where we felt Save at night. No noises on the Street, so the sleeping was very Good. Every day clean up and new towels. Next Time in Dublin we go back. A very Good price quality Balance. 
Service by booking was also great. Thank you Roxford Hotel for making our stay in Dublin so Nice!",5,2018,05,13
222,Visit to Dublin in May 2018.  General sightseeing.,"This is a very comfortable and well equipped hotel with friendly staff.  Excellent service all round.  The breakfast was excellent.  It is within walking distance of the city and there are good restaurants nearby.  I would recommend the Schoolhouse Restaurant, just along the road.",5,2018,05,11
222,Nice location,"This hotel is in a nice location. About 20 minutes walk to the tourist section of Dublin, and located in a quiet neighborhood. There are plenty of good places to eat within a few blocks, so if you're tired of walking at the end of the day, you don't need to go far to find a good meal. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good, and they have a secure car park on the premises. They are undergoing some renovations, so the lounge was not available when we were there and other areas were being painted, but the rest of the hotel was very clean and nice.

Our room was not the best, so if you can, book one of the better rooms. Ours was number 106, and it either backs the kitchen or a staff room, so around 5:30 or 6:00am, it begins to get quite noisy. Also, it is in the basement and the hallway from the carpark to the stairs goes right by so you can hear everyone coming and going with their luggage. Other rooms have a separate hallway so the noise would not be so bad.

The other odd thing about this particular room is that there is a sauna added in. The room size would be just fine without the sauna, but it's a 4x4-foot box in the room, takes up quite a lot of floor space, and makes it quite crowded. For two people and a small amount of luggage it is very tight. Other rooms have saunas available as well, but I don't know what size those rooms are.

The room has a coffee maker, tv, and an assortment of DVDs.The carpet in this particular room was quite dirty and probably needs to be replaced, but as I said, the rest of the hotel was clean and nice so I expect this would be taken care of in the renovation.

I would probably stay at this hotel again if I were going to Dublin because of the location, but I would pay a bit extra for a room on one of the upper floors.",3,2018,05,10
222,Roxford Lodge - quite simply - excellent,"Roxford Lodge is a gem in Dublin.  A wonderfully comfortable, elegant boutique hotel in a great location. Staff, service, comfort, character are top quality. Highly recommend. We were a party of 5 - French, Swedish and Irish, and everyone was greatly impressed and enjoyed our great stay. Thank you to all at Roxford Lodge.",5,2018,05,09
222,Great stay,"We had both a jacuzzi tub and sauna in the room. Very comfortable accommodations close to the city centre. Breakfast was great and a very reasonable price, either for a full hot Irish breakfast or a continental breakfast. When we come back to Dublin we'll be coming back to the Roxford Lodge. ",5,2018,05,08
222,"Beautiful Hotel, Friendly & Helpful Staff and Great Location","The hotel was absolutely stunning, for economy rooms they still had luxury features, with lots of extras such as a dvd player and a selection of dvd's. It was clean and comfortable and one room we had even included a sauna. The staff team were very welcoming and friendly and provided useful advice that helped us during our stay. I would definitely return to this hotel and would recommend staying here is you are visiting Dublin.",5,2018,05,08
222,Weekend trip to visit friends,". 
Roxford Lodge is located on a lovely road in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin. Airport bus stop is a  5 minute walk away. I had a lovely comfortable, cosy, single room and surprisingly useful sauna! Also pleasant 20 min walk into Grafton street. Would return and have already recommended.",4,2018,05,02
222,Good Location,"Lovely Room.  Clean, fresh tastefully decorated.  
Near RDS 15 min walk to city centre.  Secure free car park.  Fresh cooked breakfast, selection of continental items.  
Receptionist very helpful.  
Would stay again. 
Bus stop at hotel.",5,2018,04,29
222,Very pleasant stay,"I was very surprised at the quality of this hotel. I hadn't really read any reviews before my stay, and when I saw that it was a converted house I wasn't sure what to expect. The staff were extremely friendly, the woman that checked me in walked me down to the room so I wouldn't get lost. The room itself was fantastic, very clean. There are loads of sockets, one next to each of the beds and by the table. They even have sockets to fit European plugs. The room had a coffee machine and kettle, and mini fridge, as well as a DVD player with plenty of DVDs to choose from. Our room looked out into the courtyard, we spent a lovely afternoon out there in the sun. We stayed for only one night but would definitely consider staying again. Overall very pleased with our stay.",4,2018,04,23
222,Great place! ,"A delightful hotel, with every comfort. My room was a single one, small but very well laid out. Having a bath as well as a shower was lovely and the coffee machine was a treat. The staff were warm and efficient and I'll definitely be back. Many thanks! ",4,2018,04,15
222,Pleasant Hotel; Good facilities.,Very nice hotel: helpful staff and comfortable rooms with excellent facilities (mine had a sauna!). Good breakfast. Hotel is accessible from city centre at a distance (30-40 mins walk from O'Connell St). Didn't use hotel restaurant but seems a bit limited - needs notice before 4pm. Several restaurants in vicinity.,4,2018,04,07
222,Such a good hotel,This is a lovely hotel in a pleasant area of Dublin. There’s a bus stop across the road where you can catch a bus to the city centre. It’s also very convenient for the Bord Gais theatre. Our twin room had a sauna and the bathroom had a jacuzzi bath (fantastic water pressure as well) The comfy beds guarantee a good nights sleep. We were more than happy with our all too brief stay.,5,2018,04,06
222,Cozy Dublin hotel for 4,"We had a difficult time finding a hotel room for the four of us. However Roxford Lodge was perfect for us. 
Our room was amazing. It was roomy for the four adults, less than a mile from Dublin city center, and a parking lot located to the rear of the property. 
The check in was prompt, the staff was very attentive, accommodating and helpful. 
It made our first few days in Dublin an easy adjustment  and enjoyable.",5,2018,04,01
222,A hotel with character and helpful and friendly staff,"We only stayed one night at the Roxford Lodge but had a great time. The hotel is in an old building so rooms are not as uniform and regular as in a modern hotel, but we liked this and the very helpful and friendly staff we interacted with—especially Shannon. The continental breakfast for 6 Euros was far superior to the usual fare in quality, variety  and quantity. The hotel also has secure parking at the rear. It is close to some suprisingly good restaurants in the Ballsbirdge/Beggars Bush area about five minutes walk away.",5,2018,04,01
222,Lovely place,Great location 15-20 min walk to the city center. Buses stop just outside the house. Aircoach very close. Rooms were clean and had nice interior. Staff where very nice and helpful. Quiet during the night although I had a room facing the mailn road.,5,2018,04,01
222,Awesome stay!!,The lodge was perfect for our night in Dublin! Room was comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was very delicious.  Shannon at the front desk was so helpful pointing out wonderful restaurants and pubs that we would could go to on our way to a concert at 3Arena.  They have private parking which was very helpful!   I would highly recommend the Roxford Lodge!,5,2018,03,31
222,First and last visit,"Had a single room for 95euro per night.  Definitely felt like a second class citizen in this “luxury boutique” hotel.  My tiny room had a brick wall for a view and was very loud thanks to construction outside and the echoing tiny hallway.  

I appreciated the overload of appliances available (though I only used the fridge, tv and the kettle)

The bathroom fittings seemed new though shower had minor malfunctions (intermittently leaking head, stuck drain plug)

When I arrived, I found the bathroom and bed had several hairs therein (long ones clearly not mine).  This was not the end of the world but I was treated with dismissive cold politeness and informed my room was economy (which I am led to believe means it doesn’t deserve servicing??).  I asked for a cleaning.  Bedding was not changed and long black hairs in bathroom were not removed.   I mentioned this the next morning and the desk clerk (after firmly informing me that ‘bedding is not changed on the first night) brought the manager/owner down to my room to examine it.  Manager removed one long hair (as evidence??) and my room was cleaned thoroughly thereafter.  

I am not a bleaching clean freak.  Though I prefer a room to be well attended when I’m paying for it.  

My primary concern is that, although I was polite and calm at all junctures, I was made to feel ashamed and disbelieved for bringing valid situations to the attention of the staff.  

My conclusion is that the economy basement rooms are VERY overpriced and the staff are too posh to pay any kindness to lowly economy guests.  

if I could have been refunded I would have left immediately.  As it was, I wasn’t even offered a pittance upon checking out.  

My low review is based on staff attendance, the above interactions, and the price of the tiny basement room.  

Maybe the upstairs is a magical kingdom but I will never return to find out.",2,2018,03,29
222,excellent ,"Hadn't stayed before - but will be back. This is an object lesson in how to run a small hotel. Spotless, beautifully furnished, helpful and friendly staff, great location - all-round excellent. Bravo. l am still tying to get up to trip advisor's idiotic 200w limit although i'm done talking ....",5,2018,03,28
222,Great stay!,"Great location, great service and great room! Location is great, short distance to pubs, restaurants, supermarkets and even a Tesco! The staff was lovely and very helpful in showing which good pub to go to, where the locations are and how to get to them. The room was recently renovated and it was wonderful, very nice lighting, great view, USB charging ports and a great entertainment center.
Would recommend to stay here.",5,2018,03,23

Gin and tonic in front of the fire before we headed to the concert was special

222,A weekend at Dublin during Saint Patrick Day,"the room is quite small but confortable and the hydromassage vessel is very appreciated!
It was too expensive but it was Saint Patrick Day...
Very good position for city centre by foot or by bus (4 - 7 - 7a)",4,2018,03,22
222,Only 15 minute walk to city center,"Booking a hotel during St Patricks Day weekend wasn’t easy, I was grateful the Roxford had a booking left.  I had my reservation thinking it might be to far from city Center but honestly the walk is beautiful.  The restaurants and bars in the area are more local and I highly recommend them.  The staff were absolutely lovely.  I had the Irish breakfast my second day and was very glad I did. I had a lovely chat with the waitress and my food was outstanding.  The only issue I had were the water pipes can be noisy.  I’m a very light sleeper and woke up early when someone in another room started their shower.  I’m sure if I had asked for ear plugs this wouldn’t be an issue.  ",5,2018,03,18
222,Executive suite,"We stayed in the executive suite (room 120) last night and it was amazing, it's recently been renovated and it's beautiful. The jacuzzi and sauna are such a treat! Definitely recommend for a romantic getaway! The staff were also lovely.",5,2018,03,12
222,Fantastic house/hotel Dublin,"A truly fantastic house as part of this hotel which had everything location, friendly helpful staff, spotless, first class beds, a fully stocked kitchen with bread and milk and car parking.  We absolutely loved this place and will definitely be back - can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2018,03,11
222,Very friendly and welcoming hotel,"Very nice hotel in excellent location for walking to the city centre.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff.  We were in a classic deluxe room which was clean, reasonably sized and quiet.  However, some of the décor, especially the bathroom, felt a little dated and perhaps in need of an update.  Drawer space limited and wardrobe very small and cluttered with ironing board etc. A little disappointed as room was not quite as expected, based on website photos.  Bed was not super-king sized as advised in an email sent prior to our visit.  The friendliness of all the staff and intimacy of the hotel compensated for this and nevertheless made for a most enjoyable stay.",4,2018,03,10
222,My favourite place to stay in Dublin,I have been staying at the Roxford Lodge at least one day per week for the last year. it has now become my home from home.  The rooms are excellent and nearly all include a sauna and jacuzzi bath. The staff are consistently superb and welcoming. The hotel is located in leafy Ballsbridge and only a 15 minute walk to St Stephen's Green. There are excellent places nearby to eat and have a drink.  I couldn't recommend it more highly,5,2018,03,06
222,Gorgeous ,We booked roxford last minute as our flight was cancelled. It was overbooked so we got a room upgrade to the superior suite. It was just fabulous. The hotel is set inside a 150 year old house. The detail is gorgeous. Thank you to the lovely girls for looking after us. It was a lovely stay ,5,2018,03,01
222,Fantastic Weekend!,"Beautiful hotel just on the edge of the city center. Dublin is quite expensive accommodation-wise, when taking other prices into account this place is real value for money! The room is small but cosy and has everything you need: a teeny-tiny sauna, a big comfortable bed and a Nespresso machine you can use. There's also a mobile phone - we didn't use it since we're from the Netherlands and could use our own phones, but may be pretty handy if you're from further abroad. Our room was downstairs, so half under street level, but there was enough light (and we pretty much only slept there). The road wasn't noisy in my experience. The hosts are really nice and helpful. They helped us book a tour and stored our luggage between our check-out and flight. You get a code to enter the main door at night. 

The location is fine, it's a 25 minute walk to the city center and the bus stops literally in front of the hotel. If you decide to walk: just follow the road all the way to the end, you'll end up next to Trinity College. We walked every time, pretty good way to walk off the Guinness before sleeping. ;) 

Extra tip: we had brunch one day at Farmer Browns on Bath Avenue, 5 minute walk from the hotel. Was delicious!!",5,2018,03,01
222,"Wonderful service, excellent location","The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, my double bed room was very comfortable and the inclusion of a dry sauna was a nice touch. The brown bread at breakfast was exceptional, make sure you give it a try!",5,2018,02,26
222,Exceptional,"The hotel is perfect!It has everything you need in order to feel like home.The triple room was big enough.It had two television,one dvd,a coffee machine for filter coffee and espresso.It is about 2km from the center(15 minutes walking) and right on the front door there is bus station(number 4 and 7).In the corner stops the aircoach that comes and goes directly to the airport.You can also take airlink express 757 that stops in the Merrion square and then take bus 4 or 7.The hotel is very clean with a big fireplace in the living room with a computer that you can print your boarding pass.The staff was absolutely amazing especially Karen!They gave us information for everything and they were extremely kind.The wifi was excellent.The breakfast has two choices.Continental that has 6 euro(ham,different kind of cheese,cereal,fruit,toast,juice,butter,jam,nutella,honey) and the typical Irish breakfast(sausages,egg,bacon,beans...).The lady in the dinning room was very very kind!!The mattresses were very comfortable and thick with two different kind of pillows.The best thing in the room is that they give you a mobile(full of information for Dublin) that you can take it with you outside the hotel with unlimited MB in order not to spend yours.I fully reccomend it!!",5,2018,02,23
222,Absolutely delightful stay!,"The staff are really nice - could not have been more friendly and helpful 10/10.
Very comfortable room in this large Georgian building in a nice part of townand good breakfast too. Decent trad Dublin pub around the corner. Railway station (DART) and some decent eateries about 5 minutes away. Rugby fans will like to know that Lansdowne Road is also easy walking distance.
From Dublin Airport, Aircoach service 702 took 20/25 minutes (2 per hour) and stops 250 yds from the hotel @8.50 euro single.
Its only 25 minute stroll into town or there are frequent bus es into town from just across the road. Weary tourists etc returning from the sights will be pleased to know tha the bus stops bt the front door to the hotel.
p.s. Google Maps will route you to the Back door for some reason!",5,2018,02,19
222,Weekend Break,"We really enjoyed our stay in The Roxford Lodge.
 The room was quirky with a different feel to it than the normal hotel room. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Would highly recommended this accommodation.",5,2018,02,18
222,quiet comfortable place to stay,"Nice friendly staff, free phone use while you stay, high speed WIFI service. The room was very nice and clean. It is about a 15 minute to the art and archaeology museums and 20 to Trinity college. I would recommend this place.",5,2018,02,18
222,Wonderful Hotel,"Amazing experience.  Great staff, gorgeous hotel & location for a cheap price. Would certainly recommend.  We stayed in the Family Room which included three bed a sauna, and even a free phone to use when you leave the hotel without wasting any data.  Truly wonderful.",5,2018,02,18
222,Ticks all the boxes,"Great little hotel within walking distance of the city centre. There's a free gated carpark at the back. Our double room was at the back of the house and was lovely and quite. The bed was comfortable, great pillows and bedding and we had a jacuzzi bath! 
Shannon gave us a great welcome and the lady who severed the very tasty breakfast was welcoming and attentive. 
We've already booked to return!!",5,2018,02,15
222,A Wonderful Hotel!,"Our stay here was just perfect. We have two young children and were made to feel very welcome by all members of staff. 
We stayed in the family room (115) which had lots of space for the four of us, plus the added bonus of a jacuzzi bath & small sauna. 

The breakfast was wonderful - we had the French toast, bacon, sausage & maple syrup on both mornings as it was simply delicious! The children had plenty of cereals, juices, cheese & toast to choose from. In particular, the lady serving breakfast was so nice and kind to us. She is very attentive to all your needs and the children loved her! 

The buses stop right outside the hotel and take only 10 minutes to get you to O’Connell street. So easy and accessible with the children and a buggy. The receptionist helped us to purchase a ‘72 hour freedom pass’ online and she printed the voucher out so all we had to do was hop on the number 7 bus into the city and collect our freedom passes from the Dublin bus office on O’Connell street. This pass included travel on all the city buses and the brilliant ‘DoDublin Hop On Hop Off’ tour buses. Very easy!

The hotel has a lovely homely feel to it and everyone seems very friendly. A great addition for us was the free parking as we were travelling from London by car. The car park is at the back of the hotel and is secured by locked gates. Being able to leave the car safely was a great comfort and there is no charge - just brilliant! 

Overall, a wonderful stay. Thank you all at Roxford Lodge for making it so enjoyable for us.  We will return! ",5,2018,02,13
222,Excellent ,The Roxford Lodge was a great surprise. A superb upmarket location and perfect walking distance to central Dublin. The staff were extremely helpful and  friendly. The rooms and beds were very comfortable with a sauna in the room. The cost was very reasonable compared to other Dublin hotels. I would definitely stay there again.,5,2018,02,07
222,A great hotel in a fantastic city!,"Excellent hotel with fantastic staff! I booked a three bedroom townhouse and a double room for a group of mates, away for a weekend in Dublin. The accommodation was brilliant. The rooms were spacious, very clean with very good facilities. 
The staff were all very helpful and helped us with taxis, no request was too much trouble.
Thank you.",5,2018,02,05
222,Would definitely recommend ,Great place! Great location. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast. We had a slight mixup with our triple room but they sorted that very quickly and nothing was a problem.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and relatives coming to Dublin and the parking is an added bonus. Out room was nice and I’m definitely going to consider an executive room next time as they get even better reviews. ,5,2018,01,21
222,FANTASTIC,"We and my lot went for a birthday weekend away in Dublin and the service we recived at roxford lodge was fab they couldn't do enough for you, cant comment on the food, but the room was great, didn't try the sauna though. but all in all amazing welcoming service

most likely would return when in Dublin next!!!!",4,2018,01,17
222,Executive suite is a must!,"We booked to stay for 1 night in the executive suite and having had such a great night relaxing in this luxurious room, we booked to stay the next night again. As it was a Sunday and Monday night in the month of Jan we got a good deal.
There is a sauna and a jacuzzi up the stairs in your room with a tv that you can watch whilst in the jacuzzi. The bed is so comfortable and the room is so spacious. Down the stairs in the room is the bathroom with a really big shower. Everything about the room is brand new and the decor is modern and bright. The tv is large and they even provide you with new DVD’s. We could even link our Netflix account up to it.
They have a Samsung R7 speaker which we played music through as we got ready- great quality! There is also a mini fridge, kettle, coffee machine, hair dryer and straighteners.
We had breakfast on one of the mornings which was €12 per person. It was traditional and convenient and a very nice lady served us this.
You could hear no noise from outside in your room so had great night sleeps.
The hotel has its own private car park around the back and we could see right out to it from our room. 
The three girls on reception that we dealt with during the time of our stay were so helpful. 
We hope to return to this suite again in the future. Thank you!",5,2018,01,17
222,Excellent hotel in a great location,"I normally stay in large chain hotels however I am very fortunate to find this hotel with fantastic personal service, in a great location. The bus stop is directly outside the door and takes you in minutes to the city center. It is worth staying in the hotel for the cooked breakfast alone. I have no hesitation in recommending the hotel and I will be back to stay there
Peter & Maire",5,2018,01,17
222,THANK YOU KAREN Super Service,"Nice hotel but without Karen (I believe that was here name) at the front desk we may have had to find a new hotel for our first night in Dublin. We arrived late coming from Scotland and she said her manager had wanted to cancel are reservation because there was no contact with us. She advised we were coming from the US so we may be out of contact because of travel. Which was 100% correct.  Thankfully she has some sense and her manager probably should listen to here more often. Good hotel, in pretty good location. She also set up a reservation for a restaurant she recommended nearby and it was fantastic maybe our best meal on our 16 day vacation. THANK YOU KAREN Also hotel provide free cell phone to utilize while staying in Dublin.",5,2018,01,16
222,Beautiful ,The lady at reception and the lady serving breakfast really made our stay a wonderful experience and most enjoyable. Their friendliness and warmth help shape the very special welcome you feel in this hotel. We will be back. Thanks ,5,2018,01,13
222,Highly recommended,"This is a great place to stay in Dublin. It is a small hotel and they really look after you.  A lot of thought has gone in to making the stay perfect.   Very comfortable, relax and easy - just what is needed for me!",5,2018,01,12
222,Executive Suite is amazing,"I never leave a review for any hotel but I feel I must for this excellent room. Fantastic! The executive suite is huge, gorgeous decor and the best part is a big jacuzzi beside your own sauna! Staff are friendly, location is perfect so I would safely say this is the best  room in Dublin for the price.",5,2018,01,06
222,Three days in Dublin at Roxford Lodge hotel,"Clean, comfortable and with very friendly staff. I have booked a single room that exceeded my expectations. I liked the espresso machine inside the room, the large bathroom, and the comfortable bed. I absolutely enjoyed my stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel and I will definitely be back again.",5,2018,01,03
222,Wonderful ,"Had a very comfortable stay at The Romford Lodge.
A nice stroll away from the city centre and handy for the Aviva Stadium.
The free carpark was both welcome and secure.
I had a lovely clean room, good sized en suite bathroom, tv & dvds, nespresso coffee machine & plenty of pods. 
Friendly, helpful staff.

222,Final night stop over before returning to the UK,"Both the welcome on arrival and on leaving was very warm, friendly and informative. Room was very clean, modern and even had a personal sauna in the corner of the room.
Full Irish breakfast was excellent. We checked late morning but had a full days site seeing to do in Dublin before a late flight home, the Hotel staff were very happy to keep our cases all day and arrange our taxi to the airport.
We would definitely stay again when in Dublin.",5,2018,01,02
222,Heavenly treat!,"Been 3years since I stayed here...this visit was even better than the last! Having booked to stay in the executive suite for early December as a birthday present for my partner, we ended up having to postpone due to my ending up on crutches two days before the stay! Oh well, that didn't prevent us from being able to reschedule the stay. We arrived yesterday and were greeted at the carpark door,before being shown to the reception via the lift (still on crutches). We were then shown to the suite which was beautiful and exactly as shown in the photos on the website. The room was beautiful! Sauna, Jacuzzi upstairs with TV, shower and toilet down 5 stairs, with bed, couch, seat and everything else you might need on the main level. The suite was expensive for one night without breakfast but the parking was free and overall the staff were lovely,were helpful and we were able to avail of a late checkout until 2pm.  It was a real treat.....definitely going to re- book when we want another bit of luxury. The location of the Lodge is also brilliant....we wanted a quiet break so a slow crutch trip up to Ballsbridge provided all the restaurants and bars we needed. ",5,2017,12,30
222,Old but Gold,"Very friendly Staff, receptionist stayed longer to check us in! Old but clean and lovely rooms, good Breakfast Irish as well as continental. Space for car. Right in front of the hotel is a bus stop, ten min to city centre.",4,2017,12,26
222,Beautiful Luxury Room perfect for city break,"Stayed one night in the executive suite.. personal jacuzzi, sauna & bathroom were all great quality. Staff were really helpful. Definitely would stay again.. Room also includes balcony (where smoking is allowed)",5,2017,12,18
222,Cozy hotel,"The staff was friendly, hotel very cozy and clean, located a pleasant 15 min walk from the centre. The rooms were small but very well equipped (with a sauna!). The breakfast was very good with a choice for a continental or an Irish breakfast.",5,2017,12,15
222,House is perfect for a big Group,"We had the House for 7 people, it was great! We had a Kitchen, Living room and plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms. The house was clean and in a good location. There was also food ready for Breakfast in the Morning and the grocery store is just a short walk away. The City center can be reached within 15-20min walking, which is also perfect.",5,2017,12,14
222,Excellent accommdation in a great location.,"This house is brilliant for a larger group or family. Check in was really smooth and parking was provided. It is located close to bars, shops and restaurants and more importantly for our trip, the Aviva stadium. The rooms within the house are all very comfortable and nicely decorated. Another highlight was that bread, milk, tea, coffee and cereals are all left in the house so sorting breakfast was easy.",5,2017,12,12
222,"Great place, great people !","Nice charming Victorian house offers all modern confort. Very nice and very confortable room. Staff was great and very helpfull for taxi calls or city trip booking.
At walking distance from the city center but in a calm location.",5,2017,12,04
222,"Nice place, amazing location.","Great hotel, well priced and very close to the city centre. Secure car park in the rear. Lovely breakfast and very friendly staff. Will definitely be back. Everything was in order. Checkin was fast and efficient. ",5,2017,12,03
222,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely stay at Rockford lodge as usual, staff very friendly and always willing to help out and make our stay as comfortable as possible, a great location within walking distance to town and all the attractions, will definitely stay again in the future",5,2017,12,03
222,Awesome!!,"Roxford lodge was fantastic. Near enough to Dublin but not in city. Hotel was eclectic feel and clean. Staff was superb. Very accommodating, extremely helpful and always pleasant. We stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed it immensely. Can’t say enough good things about this great little hotel. 

",5,2017,11,27
222,Great for the rugby ,"I stayed here with 4 other friends when we were in Dublin for the autumn internationals, Ireland rugby match. The hotel was very well kept, staff very friendly and location was incredible in terms of proximity to the Aviva stadium and nearby restaurants just a short 10min walk away. Outside the hotel is a bus stop where you can get the bus into Dublin centre (I assume). My only small complaint, and it is small, is that at £75 per person for one night, I would have thought breakfast could have been included. This is however, a very small suggestion as we were aware of this at the time of booking. 

Thanks for a lovely stay! ",5,2017,11,27
222,Rugby weekend,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here this past weekend. The hotel was so comfortable with many little touches that five star establishments fail to provide. The staff were so welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was perfect. Really great location. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2017,11,27
222,Three day break,"Getting 8 of us a great place to share was no mean feet i booked though booking.com and through no fault of the hotel paid more than quoted so if you can book direct then go for that, they organised a people carrier 33 euros for 8 to the airport ( again i made the school girl error of using booking.com for the way there and paid 45), the house was perfect location 15 mins walk to center or 10 euros in a cab didn't use dart but believe is ok. The house was well sized and well equipped we arrived at 8am thinking wed have to wait for check in but they got us srainght in . The house was serviced everyday. The house was very warm and we can only presume it had underfloor heating as the radiators we off. The showers and beds were excellent and we had a handy phone supplied that was a guide out and about. Plenty of room for 8. The only one criticism i would have is the entry as a very basic key code pad was used with only 5 digits and we wondered if the code was ever changed, as it would also not take many guesses if you wanted to be in- proper locks and keys would be more beneficial to outsiders visiting an unknown city ( not that we had any problems - just a thought )",5,2017,11,20
222,Great stay this time,"Stayed here for the second time and it was sensational. 

We were greeted by a very helpful and friendly receptionist who helped us with not only our bags but with lots of information about the hotel and surrounds. 

We each stayed in a superior double room. Mine had a small balcony which overlooked the back area of the hotel which was very pleasant. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious and well appointed. Shower over bath. 

Breakfast was ample and well prepared. The service is lovely.

On check out we received the same great service and help. 

The hotel is located in a quieter part of Dublin but a short walk into the city centre and is close to good restaurants at Lansdowne Road.

Free wifi.

So glad I came back for another stay.",5,2017,11,16
222,Five star treatment in a three star hotel!,"Lovely hotel in a very nice area of Dublin. The hotel is comfortable and very welcoming, breakfast is very good and the staff are extremely friendly. Onsite parking is definitely a bonus! Very handy if you’re visiting one of the embassies.",5,2017,11,15
222,50th birthday celebrations ,Lovely place in a great location. Easy access to the stadium and also close to the dart. Walking distance to the night life.  Lovely little extras as well.  Will return and will definitely recommend :-) ,4,2017,11,13
222,Fantastic Dwelling in a great location.,"We stayed for one night and we all wished we had booked the house for a week.
You will not be disappointed when you see the property. All rooms very big and spacious.
The staff at the Roxford Lodge Hotel were very helpful.",5,2017,11,13
222,A wonderful stay!,"We rented a house for 8 people (4 adults and 4 children). It is well-located in a safe and peaceful area. The staff is really nice, helpful and efficient. They even booked a taxi for us to go to the airport!",5,2017,11,08
222,Great house with excellent service,"Booked this house for a trip with a group of ten. people where very friendly. The house is located near a hotel with owns the place. Everyday new bedding and towels. Even got some complementary coffee!
Only downside was the toilet system didn't work well (had to reset the pump every time). They way they dit there best to fix it made up for the inconvenience.",5,2017,11,07
222,So Good Last Year That We Returned This Year ! Highly Recommended.,"The People: Wonderful. It was nice to recognize the staff from the previous year. They're friendly and helpful. They will offer advice that you might not even think of asking for. Ms. Agnes in the restaurant is absolutely charming. She'll keep your coffee cup full at breakfast.We loved her wry humor. 

The hotel: CLEAN! REALLY clean. Room service is very fast. Sheets are changed and the bed is made very quickly. No street noise and no noise from within. If you arrive before check-in, you may be offered tea while you wait.

Location: There are several excellent restaurants, convenience stores, and a pizzeria within walking distance. There's a bus stop in front of the hotel and another across the street. The airport shuttle is in the next block. The train station is close, but far enough away so that you can't hear it..The distance from the lodge to ""downtown"" is well within walking distance but the bus is always available and ON TIME. A few banks are around the corner. If the college scene is your cup, Temple Bar (a college gathering spot, not a synagogue) is within walking distance. Christchurch and several attractions are nearby (including the famous ""Tart with a Cart"") and accessible by foot or by bus.

Internet access is available in the lobby, and the hotel provides a cell phone for you to use when you are in town. That was a wonderful surprise.

I can't think of any reason for staying anywhere else when visiting Dublin. We highly recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel. You'll leave Dublin with warm memories. We did.",5,2017,11,03
222,Leafy lanes,"Good priced hotel close to the centre of Dublin.  10-mins walk to Aviva Stadium or National Gallery, and 20-mins from Temple Bar nightlife and Trinity College.  Nice and comfortable, friendly staff, secure parking and great breakfast - what more do you need :-)",5,2017,11,03
222,Great find!,"3 friends and myself stayed in a family room in the Roxford lodge hotel,lovely spacious room with everything you could want at a really reasonable price.The location is fantastic with free parking available to the back of the hotel.The lady who checked us in was friendly and kindly rang us a taxi as we were going to a concert nearby in the 3 arena.Sadly we didn't get to experience breakfast as we had a very late night but there is lots of restaurants and cafes nearby.Thanks for a lovely stay,will definitely recommend it to anyone i know going to stay in Dublin",5,2017,10,31
222,A hidden gem,"The suite in the Roxford Lodge Hotel is absolutely tremendous. I've stayed here twice now and it's just perfect. It's just on the edge of the city so you're never more than fifteen to twenty minutes walk from landmarks and stadia. 

The facilities in the room are second to none. I've stayed in penthouses with less options for guests. Having your own sauna and jacuzzi mean you can relax in privacy like few other places. 

The bathroom has a heated tile floor and the suite it's self has massive amounts of space for you to lounge around. With local bars and restaurants being a few steps away I can't really say enough good things about the place. 

It's an incredible deal when compared to some of the 4 and 5 star hotels that dot the city and suburbs of Dublin. Trust me, if you're looking for something different then the suite is a must visit.",5,2017,10,31
222,Dublin Marathon weekend,"We had an amazing time in the Roxford Lodge.  The staff were outstanding and extremely friendly. The accommodation was 1st class and I hope that we get the opportunity to visit again. The location is spot on being only 10 minutes from Stephen's Green and for the marathon it was great as only 800m from the finish/start.

Thank you for all your help and assistance. ",5,2017,10,29
222,What a find,"My husband found this gem while trying to figure out where we could stay in Dublin.  We were trying to find a hotel with a king bed.  He contacted several, but Roxford responded immediately and even called us in the states to answer even more questions.  The accommodations were lovely.  The staff went out of their way to help us with everything (especially the evening staff).  One of the nicest features was a FREE loaner cell phone which they provide for every room that was your to take and use.  It was wonderful, we could now use google maps to find things (we did not opt to pay for our cellular plan while in Europe).",5,2017,10,28
222,"Freandly stuff, nice room, easy trip from airport","Freandly stuff, close to google head quarters, clean and nice rooms, comfortable sleeping, free WiFi, accept bitcoins, fast check in and checkout and good connection from airport - aircoach busses stop few minutes walk",5,2017,10,25
222,Dublin visit,"This is the third time I have stayed at the Rockford Lodge Hotel and was greeted by Florencia. Not only was I offered a cup of coffee or tea Florencia called the hop on hop off bus to find out the schedule and also checked the weather forecast for me. When ever I pass through Dublin I stay here as it very clean and comfortable not to mention great breakfast and exceptional customer service. Will be back again 😁
",5,2017,10,24
222,Wonderful end to our Ireland trip!,"The hotel was WAY beyond our expectations.  The sauna, jacuzzi, Nespresso coffee machine, luxury beds, were fabulous!!  Every person on the front desk was polite and helpful.  Made going home from a wonderful trip a bit easier!!",5,2017,10,24
222,"1 night stay, family room","We only stayed for 1 night in the family room (1 double bed and 2 single beds). The room was really nice with a very high ceiling. There is a sauna in the room (we did not use it). Excellents beds, very good breakfast, very friendly staff. Located in a very quiet area about 15 minutes on foot to the city center, with lots of restaurants. We will definitively book again for our next visit to Dublin.",5,2017,10,24
222,Pleasant ,"Nice hotel and lovely staff. Very helpful reception staff and accommodating. The room was fine although I was slightly surprised to find a sauna in the room which I didn't use. Not quite sure how hygienic a hotel room sauna is !! 
Good size room and some innovative extras which I didn't use. Could do with a smart Tv and an update but then again minor issue. Especially when beautiful Dublin is outside. The hotel location is lovely and great access to the city. 
I would re book ",4,2017,10,18
222,Four night stay,"Arrived very early and were met by Agnes who gave us some tea and biscuits.  We had some issues with payment of the bill which was caused by our credit card company and all was taken care of by  the front desk staff with courtesy and a smile. We stayed in a classic deluxe double room which was overlooking the front garden.  Room was a good size, bed comfortable and very clean.  The only issue was that the bathroom was small and up some stairs so that would not be a good room for someone who had mobility problems.  Also, as a surprise was a mobile phone for our use in Dublin if necessary.  Aercoach stop was just a few blocks away and it was about a 20 minute walk to the city center.  Other bus stop also right in front of the door.  There were several restaurants in the area.  We did not have breakfast in the lodge, but they seemed to have a buffet of cereals and breads with hot food available also.  Even though the room was in front of the building, it was very quiet at night.  A good place to stay for our visit to Dublin!",5,2017,10,16
222,Very nice hotel ,"Very Nice hotel & Very Nice girl in the reccapcion & woman at the restaurant . 
The room was small but Everything was clean and Nice .
To the city centre is about 2 km, to the giness homestore 3 km
Best regards ",5,2017,10,16
222,Three day stay in Dublin,"We had an excellent visit while staying at the Roxfird Lodge Hotel. We arrived from US at 5:00AM and the owner Agnes greeted us and allowed us to store our bags. She provided a nice coffee and biscuits service while we waited for the front desk staff to arrive and sign us into our room.
The room was very nice and  well l appointed. Quiet room also which I requested.
All the front desk staff were very helpful. There was also bus service right outside the front door. 
They also provided  great recommendations for dinner.",5,2017,10,13
222,Historic Hotel in Good Neighborhood Within Walking Distance of Centre City,"We enjoyed our brief stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel, located in a quiet neighborhood with some good restaurants and pubs  nearby. It is about  a twenty minute walk from Dublin centre city and very affordably priced.The Continental breakfast includes porridge and other items not usually associated with this type of breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We also recommend The Old Spot restaurant,  a friendly spot with good food and drinks, located in an historic building.",5,2017,10,12
222,Lovely small hotel walking distance to downtown,"Friendly, accommodating staff; lovely breakfast; secure parking. We walked into the centre of town and back daily, but there is a bus stop on the front sidewalk. 
This is a lovely place to stay; our room wasn't overly large, but served us well with a good bed, well appointed bathroom, sauna and jacuzzi...would highly recommend it.",5,2017,10,12
222,Overnight stay,"Stayed overnight to attend a concert in 3 Arena.  The staff were very welcoming, efficient and knowledgable, the facilities just what we needed and would intend using again as we attend rugby matches in the Aviva Stadium which is right next door.",5,2017,10,12
222,Perfect location!  C,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel.  Close to Trinity College and the River Liffey.  Located in a delightful residential area so it was quiet and peaceful but super easy to walk into Dublin.  This is a place we will stay again.,4,2017,10,11
222,Five stars is NOT enough,"This place is amazing. My family rented a 4 bedroom townhouse. The place itself was beautiful. There was plenty of room for 11 of us. Every detail was thought of, down to umbrellas by the door. The customer service was impeccable! When we first arrived, we realized the coffee maker wasn’t working. They brought us a BRAND NEW one, still in the box, within ten minutes!!!!!! The place was absolutely stunning! I would highly recommend!!!! ",5,2017,10,11
222,To be presented with the pleasantly unexpected is priceless!,"My review deserved that title because it was my first impression...whoa!! Jacuzzi tub AND sauna in my room, plus a balcony, to boot!! Hello!!?? All I knew was that I was getting a ""Classic"" room, double with single use. So, right there, I was blown away. Then, the excellent upkeep of the rooms, the location, and the professionalism and warmth of the place added to all that. A new product they are trying out, a free cell phone during your stay, also saved my life a few times. All of the staff was gracious and helpful, but, as usual, you always have that one favorite. Mine knows who she is. You will, too, when you stay. It was obvious from her interactions with other guests that many felt that way. I never had breakfast there, but on the last day it would have been convenient to have even their continental one, so I went to check it out, and that would be my only low mark. Cereal still in boxes. Ham and cheese with no bread offerings. A young lady who walked right past me as I talked to her (she was, obviously, busy, but you should never be too busy to say ""give me a second"" or something like that), sealed the deal. I decided against it.",5,2017,10,09
222,Perfect location,"I was in Dublin for 3 day's workshop. Perfect location for me: 10 min by walk from RDS.
Very Nice and quiet district, Roxford Logde Hôtel is a very Nice and clean place. The staff is very helpful, thank you!",5,2017,10,07
222,Excellent ,"This hotel is beautiful we really enjoyed our stay the only problem was we didn't get to stay long enough. The area it's in is lovely and quiet but yet not far from the city, Shannon at reception is lovely and very helpful can't wait to return.",5,2017,10,07
222,One night at the Roxford- excellent!,"We only stayed one night at the Roxford unfortunately. Very well situated in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin. Excellent service, fantastic breakfast, very quiet, comfortable but VERY small room. Very clean and affordable. Would recommend a larger room if your stay will be longer.",5,2017,10,06
222,"Perfect location, cozy accomodations","We spent several days in Ireland and stayed at the Rockford our first two and last two days.  We arrived early in the morning our first day and although our room was not ready, Shannon took our bags, settled us in the cozy lounge and brought us tea, coffee and cookies.  She went over the map with us and when we set out to explore waiting for our room, she gave us her favorite umbrella to use.  The lodge is cozy, the continental breakfast is delicious, the rooms are bright and comfortable, each with a steam room and best of all, the neighborhood is within walking distance of most of Dublin's attractions, shopping and wonderful pubs!",5,2017,10,05
222,Roxford Lodge Hotel - Review,"Great location, 15 minutes from the city centre by bus, with a bus stop right outside the door. Very friendly staff, nice clean well-equipped room. Hotel is located in a beautiful part of the city, great for walking about and exploring. Some very nice restaurants and bars in this locality",5,2017,10,05
222,Home away from home!,"Roxford Lodge was our home base for our trip around Ireland and the UK.
We were welcomed warmly when we arrived, our rooms  clean and comfortable. The location is great, bus stop right outside, walkable restaurants and pubs. Shannon, our front desk receptionist, recommended a great local spot for dinner, we loved it. She was a delight, more than willing to give directions, call taxis, whatever she could to help us. 
We returned twice more during our stay, each time greeted warmly. We could not have had a better home base.  We left early each visit so we were not able to enjoy the breakfasts, but I'm sure it would have been good. .Shannon, we're gonna miss you!!",5,2017,10,05
222,One night of real comfort,"I was met by the very friendly and helpful receptionist Shannon, who showed where the room was and its facilities which included a Nespresso coffee maker.
Mobile phone for foreign people to use on  their travels around the  city.
Excellent Wifi  (Free)!
Jacuzzi 
Fridge 
Slection of DvD's.
Iron and b o ard
Even an umbrella for the Irish weather.
Very comfortable room.
You could tell that the owner reallypaid attention to the needs of the residence.",5,2017,10,04
222,Great stay!,"Great stay! Bed comfy and room very clean! Shannon at front desk is Awesome.
If driving-the parking area is 1 street behind the hotel (narrow neighborhood road). With a closed iron gate with small sign. Just look for sign.",5,2017,10,03
222,Amazing hospitality,"Desmond was fantastic. We flew in late arriving about 1am and he was still available to show us in around the house. Central heating, ensuite bedrooms, delicious breakfast including BROWN bread :) Thanks!",5,2017,10,03
222,One-Night City Stop,"Quick and painless check in/ out.
Staff friendly and helpful.

Lady serving breakfast very, very busy. Made for a slightly uncomfortable atmosphere as no one knew what to do with themselves - self service or table service. Led to frayed tempers from a few other guests. 

Overall lovely, reasonably priced stay, would recommend.",4,2017,10,02
222,"Fabulous 3 bd townhouse, Lansdowne Park, Ballsbridge, Dublin","Three couples spent 5 nights in this lovely, clean, wonderfully located townhouse.  Close to amenities, great pubs and restaurants.  Easy walk to Merrion Square and Trinity College as well as great access to public transportation.  Thanks to Desmond and staff at Roxford Lodge for making everything easy and comfortable.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,10,02
222,Gideon's haven't found this place yet,"Booked this room as an overnight base while seeing a concert in the city. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the city centre but also has a a bus stop conveniently located at its front door.  Secure parking can be found at the rear of the building if you rent or bring your car. The hotel it self is a converted Victorian era building which has been beautifully decorated and maintained with pleasant staff and excellent facilities. The corridors felt a bit claustrophobic for a gent of my plus sized stature but the room was above what I expected. A sauna and Jacuzzi bath tub in the room were a beyond what I had expected. The best Wi-Fi in a room that featured a smart phone with GPS provided by the hotel as well as a TV and blu-ray player with a selection of discs for all tastes. The single bed was for me a bit small but then again as I have mentioned I am rather a plus sized person, but I still had a good nights sleep and woke refreshed in the morning. Breakfast the next morning was served quickly and was well prepared both in quantity and quality. I would definitely recommend this hotel and it will be one of  top  choices when I visit Dublin In the future. ",4,2017,10,01
222,Business stay in Dublin at the CCD,"It is a very nice small hotel in a very good location as it can be easily reached from the airport by bus as it stops a few steps away and after a longer walk (15 min) you are around the convention area. Nice pubs are around, staff there is super nice and helpful. I was having a single room which was equipped with a sauna and they offer a free usable mobile phone during your stay. Anyway free wifi was working excellent and fast. Any questions I had were promptly answered and you should take a look into the room behind the reception! Very nice style!",4,2017,09,29
222,Small Hotel close to city center.,Cozy little hotel.  Enjoyed easy access to city center by foot or by bus.  Room was quite small but sunny.  Bathtub needed a dusting.  Excellent full Irish breakfast. Staff was helpful. Would stay here again due to the location,4,2017,09,25
222,stay in the above hotel,"I feel that this room was very small and overpiced.Staff were friendly and location was nice.I found the inside of the hotel small and clostraphobic.Didnt have breakfast.
Use of a moblle phone was helpful and nice to have some dvds and tea and coffee in the room.",3,2017,09,25
222,"Clean Hotel, but Pricey","Stayed here for one night after arriving in Dublin.  The room is very tiny, barely enough room to get around the bed.  It is a very clean room and the one good benefit they offer is a free handy phone for your use while you stay there.  The phone can be used for local calls and has an internet connection to look for places and things to do and restaurants to go to,

They do have a locked parking lot, not easy to find, as you need to go into an alley and then look for the pink sign.

The staff is VERY nice and helpful.  They assisted in making calls to the airline to find out where my luggage was.

It is pricey compared with other places I stayed on my trip with no breakfast that comes with the room.  They do have a restaurant on site.",4,2017,09,22
222,too expensive,The room was small and compact and comfortable with 3 beds 1 double and 1single .Parking was a major issue.lucky to get one and space was very tight. Breakfast just okay .Overall expensive what we got .Would not stay there again,1,2017,09,19
222,Typical European hotel,"Quiet neighborhood, small room (but typical for Europe), pleasant desk clerks.  Bit of a rabbit warren of hallways.  Didn't have breakfast, so can't comment on that (apparently you need your room key to get into the dining room?).  Be forewarned, as the pictures show, you need to go up a number of steps to reach the front door.",3,2017,09,16
222,Honeymoon visit,"Stayed for five days for our honeymoon and we had an excellent time. We were able to check in early, and had our room upgraded because we were on our honeymoon and there was availability. Reception very helpful with any and all questions we had. Right next to a bus stop so close transportation to city center, but far enough away for some peace and quiet.",5,2017,09,15
222,Would stay there again,"We were only there one night but had the best sleep ever. The bus from the airport stopped within blocks of the hotel. Very clean, didn't have breakfast but it looked good. Receptionist very helpful with check in and directions around town. Easy to take bus to town and then enjoy the hop on Hop off or very walkable. You have to wave to get the bus to stop.",5,2017,09,14
222,Thank you,"Thank you, everything was seamless.  From check-in (we were a bit early) to check out.  Location was good -  close to food, drinks and the city center.  Bus right out front.  

For travellers who have been in transit for 36+ hrs this was the perfect start to our stay in Dublin.  ",5,2017,09,13
222,Mini break ,"Fantastic hotel only here one night but was lovely, staff really helpful, rooms very clean . Great to have onsite parking. Close enough to city centre and bus stops right outside. Ate in little place just round the corner called The Old Spot was lovely ",5,2017,09,13
222,Perfect!!!,"The staff was great!!! Kind and helpful! The room was beautiful, with all the necessary equipent, I had anything I needed. The location was very good with a bus stasion outside the hotel (going directly to the city center). The National Galery (free of charge) is only a few minutes away (walking distance). The best hotel choice concerning Dublin",5,2017,09,10
222,Quiet and convenient!,"Stayed two nights and were impressed with cleanliness, helpful staff, and free phone to use while we were there for GPS or to make calls. Convenient for bus to and from airport. Great restaurants in the area. It felt good to walk to the center of Dublin after flying.",5,2017,09,07
222,Really great house!!!,We spent just one night at the house and was just perfect!!! clean and well situated in a nice area in Dublin. We arrived at 1.30at night and the host was really kind to wait for us and give us a really nice welcome!!,5,2017,09,05
222,Great location,"We stayed just one night in the family room. It was a nice neighborhood away from the crowds of Dublin city centre but an easy 15 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride (from right out front) into Grafton Street. Pubs are nearby. Staff was very friendly. The room was fine for one night but not for a longer stay with 4 people in one room. There was a nice common room with couches, books and a computer.",5,2017,09,02
222,Excellent accommodation in Dublin,"Stayed at roxford B and B in ballsbridge in Dublin 
Excellent location , very good staff 
Very attentive to anything you require 
Was very appreciative of having my suitcase carried up and down the front steps 
Breakfast was very good and the lady who served breakfast was lovely 
When I return to Dublin will definitely stay there again",4,2017,09,01
222,Fantastic Stay,"We booked the Ballsbridge Townhouse for accommodation close to Dublin city centre. The townhouse was just perfect for a group of 6 friends. The house was immaculately clean and very well stocked. All staff from the hotel were friendly and approachable and nothing was too much trouble. Although we didn't have a car, the option of private parking is a real perk! The townhouse is close enough to walk into the city centre, but is also easy to get to and from by public bus, which is cheaper than a taxi and stops right outside the hotel. Would definitely book here again if returning to Dublin!",5,2017,08,30
222,Great location,We stayed here for 2 nights and it was great to have free parking. The location was handy for sightseeing. The lady that helped at breakfast was lovely and warm. Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone stopping in Dublin for a quick visit. Longer term may be not so good as the rooms are not huge.,4,2017,08,30
222,Great little hotel,"We stayed for one night in the Roxford and although the room was small ( a single size really with Double bed ) everything was first class. Ideal location when visiting Dublin for any shows or sporting events. Lovely Breakfast to set you up for the day.
We'll be back. !!!",5,2017,08,28
222,"Warm, Friendly and great location","Recently some friends and myself have traveled to Ireland for the weekend. Picking the roxford lodge was by far the best choice we made! First off the welcome was warm and we were made to feel important with no hesitation of having our luggage taken care of and door codes even though we had tried to book in a little before hand. We had then left for town for a few hours which was a perfect straight walk after turning right out of the gate for only a short 20-30 minutes depending on pace. You are then entering all the shops and pubs you need along with being at the heart of Dublin giving you the ability to get to anywhere with ease. 
One other thing I noticed with the lodge was that there was a bus that seemed to run to and from town but we didn't use it as the wall was nice and refreshing. 
The appearance of the lodge was extremely satisfying, set in a part of town that was very pleasing to the eyes it helped you feel comfortable, it was clean, quiet and peaceful.
Inside the hotel it was very nice too, access to a lovely lounge for guests to sit and a computer to use so you could print out tickets/order forms or even plan a trip or tour. All the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful from the first day we arrived to the last. 

The rooms were very clean and had great little mod cons which included a jacuzzi bath, nice shower and sauna. I myself had those along with the usual TV and a kettle with coffee etc. In my friends rooms there was a variety of other little gadgets such a Nespresso coffee machine, Netflix and a DVD player. One thing I would say is that the room was a little cramped due to the sauna but nothing terrible just that it wasn't necessary however handy as I used mine all the days but one. The bed was great, bedding was clean and soft and the bed itself felt very comfortable to sleep on with no issue. In the bathroom it was great to try out the jacuzzi tub which worked fine but is loud so not the sort of thing I expect you want to do very late or early in the day. The shower was also very good however I must say that the lack of a slip mat inside the bath was a cause for concern and that's the only problem I would say for the rooms.

Breakfast was devine, great service and plenty to choose from. I had a full irish breakfast every morning kng and each day the standard of both service and quality of food remained the same. There was plenty to pick from such as fresh orange, grapefruit,water and milk then you have a very wide variety of cereals and oats to choose from and fruit too. Much more was there but I would say you are spoiled for choice non the less.

In all I would highly recommend the roxford lodge to anyone that wants a short walk into the pubs,clubs and bars along with great places to shop and sight see. You are safe and secure and have no issue with public transport being outside the hotel if you don't feel like walking.

One final thing would be to look up the Viking splash tour which is no more than a 30 minute walk and costs roughly €25 each person, it's funny and interesting for all ages .",4,2017,08,28
222,Nice hotel in a good location,"We very much enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a good location, nicely decorated with a lot of character and has a free parking at the back. The room we had was very well designed with a clever use of space but not very big. Service is very good and the staff are helpful. If you are looking with a place with character to stay in Dublin close to the center this hotel is ideal.",5,2017,08,28
222,Brilliant stay,"Myself and 3 friends stayed in the suite over the weekend of the Dublin horse show (10 minute walk from the RDS). The suite originally is for 2 people but the hotel offered to put 2 extra beds in to accommodate us staying here. The room was brilliant - large (even with the 2 extra beds), bright, modern, clean, large bathroom, and it even had its own sauna and Jacuzzi bath with it's own TV. The room would be perfect for a couples weekend away. I couldn't recommend staying here enough and would definitely go back!",5,2017,08,25
222,Wonderful stay.,"Stayed for two nights in the executive suite as a special birthday treat. The room was wonderful, spread over three floors with large, modern bathroom, sauna, hot tub with television and even a waterproof remote! The bed was large and comfortable and there are electric velux window blinds so the room is nice and dark for sleeping. Service was excellent and nothing appeared to be too much trouble. 
Breakfast is served downstairs. The lady who serves provides a homely feel. The food was very tasty and I particularly enjoyed the French toast. 
We walked to the Kilmainham Gaol which took about one hour. There are bus stops outside but it's a pleasant walk and allows you to take in the sights. There are some restaurants nearby. 
Very lovely hotel and I would certainly recommend the executive suite for a luxurious stay! ",5,2017,08,23
222,overated,"when we booked it had a good review then it said parking off road we phoned hotel and there was parking at the rear, the room was small but comfortable, breakfast wasnt included full irish 12 euro each or i believe 6 euro continental we decided to walk to the town and have breakfast, the hotel was nice but was lacking that friendliness atmosphere     ,our bedroom view was of the carpark",3,2017,08,23
222,"Strange lay-out of hallways, lobby, etc., but conveniently located and very nice","We only stayed one night, our last night in Ireland.  The room had nice amenities, although we did not get the king bed we hoped for (but wasn't promised).  Amenities in our room included a mini fridge, hot pot, espresso maker (I think), coffee, tea etc.  We also had a tub with jets, which was nice. 
The front desk is in a very small area, and is not always manned, apparently.  However, the guy at the desk was helpful during the check-in process (no one was there when we left in the morning, though).  Our Uber driver dropped us off in the back, and there was some confusion as a result, so make sure if you ride with Uber to tell them to go to the front door!  Also, the hallways have twists and turns and are very narrow.  Good luck if you have over-sized luggage.",4,2017,08,22
222,Happy ever after!,"We were disappointed that we could not check in at the advertised time, after our long drive, due to the hotel cleaning up after the Dublin Horse show guests. However they did give us a pot of tea and biscuits while we were waiting.
Booking.com had asked if there were any special requirements and although I was booking an Economy room, I asked for as large as possible and QUIET. I now know that there are only 2 Economy rooms, both at the front of the property and in the basement. Nor did Booking.com tell me how small the room would be, although, in fact, it had a large sauna, sacrificing wardrobe/drawer space. We had to put the cases in the sauna!!
I was pleased, that after I had emailed in the evening, the owner moved us to a quieter Deluxe room at no extra charge, with more storage space.
The staff are very proud of their hotel, but some cosmetic work, such as painting and replacing worn chairs would improve it still further.",3,2017,08,21
222,Not what you think it is !,Be careful booking as pics don't tell the full story. We had a very small room and an even smaller bathroom with no hot water from overhead shower. Mentioned this but nothing done and no compensation ! Poor !,2,2017,08,20
222,Lovely place to stay wtih nice extras and affordable,"Coffee machine, sauna, Jacuzzis - lovely little extras.

Very clean and spacious and not too much artificial light; well soundproofed so well set up for good sleep, which I appreciated on a business trip.",5,2017,08,18
222,Lovely modern renovation with classic B&B feel,"Shannon at the front desk greeted us with a warm smile and let us check in to our wonderful room early due to our earlier than expected arrival - after a long overnight flight that was very much appreciated! The rooms were beautiful, modern renovations in a classic building. Beds were comfortable - we had a triple room and the way the room and beds were laid out it felt like we had a little privacy between our 15 year old's bed and ours. Breakfast was lovely, classic B&B - I had the full Irish and my wife and daughter opted for continental, all grand. Our bright, clean room was on the ground floor and opened into a very pretty courtyard. My comment to the management upon leaving was that they must be very proud to show people to their rooms in this property - the attention to detail and design of the spaces as well as the common areas made this a beautiful start to our Irish summer holiday. Shannon also recommended a wonderful restaurant just five minutes walk away (The Old Spot) that gave us a great first lunch. It is about 15 min walk to the National Gallery and Trinity College, or a five minute Uber ride - the street outside is somewhat busy, but we couldn't hear any road noise at all from inside the property which is good as I am very noise sensitive.",5,2017,08,15
222,went to Dublin for horse show at the RDS stayed at Roxford Lodge which was excellent,"double room was spotless,comfortable and staff were as helpfull as possible,excellent place to stay. It is very close to the center of ballsbridge dublin and the city center of dublin . Excellent locked car park.",5,2017,08,14
222,Very relaxing!,"We had a very relaxing stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel. The room was comfortable and we were very fortunate to have a sauna in our room. The location of the hotel was perfect for us - not in the heart of downtown, but close enough to walk.",5,2017,08,14
222,A nice stay,"The Roxford Lodge was a great place to stay for our two days in Dublin. We arrived from a red-eye flight in the morning and were thankfully able to check in right away since no one was in our room the night before--this was a lifesaver! The room was lovely--comfortable bed, jacuzzi tub, air conditioning, and enough room to move around. We were on the first floor so we didn't need to carry our suitcases up any stairs which was nice. The hotel was in walking distance to some sights (Trinity College, National Museum of Archaeology, Merrion Square) and had a bus stop right outside that allowed us to easily get around otherwise. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that. Overall, would definitely recommend the Roxford Lodge as a nice play to stay in Dublin!",4,2017,08,11
222,Perfect spot.,"Stayed here for 3 nights in July and was not disappointed.  Our room was a bit small but otherwise very comfortable.  Drinking water on tap in the bathroom which itself is perhaps a little dated but very clean and perfectly adequate.  Wi-fi in room is the best I've experienced in any hotel, as good as at home and no problem logging on.  TV and DVD player plus a few dads. If you want to watch I suggest you bring your own.
Staff are not highly visible but they are all very friendly and helpful. Reception staff were all keen to help and Agnes in the dining room at breakfast couldn't have been more welcoming.  Breakfast were delicious , the toasted Wheaton bread  as light as a feather and warm as toast.
There are plenty of nice bars and restaurants close at hand . But may need to be booked.
Ideal for rugby matches as just a short walk to the Aviva stadium on Landsdowne Road.
The city centre is about a 25 or 30 min walk but nice on a good day . I did it easily and I well past pension age.  Otherwise a bus to the city centre can be caught just across the road.
If you travel by car there is an easily accessible and secure free car park.
I hope to have an excuse to stay in this hotel again",5,2017,08,10
222,Wonderful stay,"We really appreciated the place. It was just perfect. Very clean. Beds are very comfortable and we enjoyed the little arrival attentions with everything you need for your breakfast. 
We'll come back. 
Thanks again for that perfect stay. ",5,2017,08,08
222,Perfect spot for the Discovery of Dublin,"Very nice hotel. The best breakfast we had on us trip. The Service is outstanding. If you want to discover Dublin then is this the right spot for doing it. The bus stops in front of the hotel. You have at the back a free parking. The standard room is  small but nice.
",5,2017,08,08
222,Perfect for aviva,"Nice room, had access to patio which was a sun trap. It could be used by two other rooms but we only seen one couple for about an hour. Bathroom ok,room was clean, coffee machine a lovely touch. Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is no residents bar but advertises drinks can be purchased ar reception for the lounge. Very limited selection, only spirits were barcardi, Jameson's and gin. No vodka. Only a small point but as the surrounding area was packed due to the match at aviva all the bars were busy so was looking forward to a drink at the hotel before bed. However lovely hotel, we loved the patio and for aviva would definitely stay here again",4,2017,08,07
222,"Lovely place, great location","We stayed here for two nights, and it had several lovely amenities.

Pros: Staff was lovely and very helpful.  We had a couple of issues, and they were pleasant the whole time.   Room was nice enough, and had air conditioning.  We had a room with both a tub and a sauna, and I used both and they both were very relaxing.  Also, I accidentally left a bunch of undergarmets in the drawer of the room.  I emailed the day we left, and they held them for me for a week so I could pick them up before I left!  Location was also lovely - just a short walk to town that made it so we could be away from the hubbub but still be able to access it.  Breakfast was also lovely, but this is the only place I stayed during my week in Ireland that didn't have breakfast included in the room price.  

Cons:  Couple of minor problems that added together lost it a star.  I used the jetted tub on the first night, and it wouldn't drain.  The front desk said it would sometimes get jammed, but they couldn't fix it until the morning.  I also couldn't figure out how to get the coffee maker to work.  Also, when I picked up my things I left, they had added a bunch of stuff to the bag (magazines, a magnet, etc.) that someone else had left behind - I thought the magazines came with the room, but apparently, it just wasn't cleaned well before we moved in.  Finally, the outer walls were pretty thin and you could hear people outside, but as long as we had the AC run at night, it wasn't a problem.

Overall, it was a nice place to stay, but they have a little room to make it just a bit better.  We'd definitely consider it on our next trip, but we'd also consider other places too.",4,2017,08,07
222,Pleasant stay,"Arrived early Dublin mid morning was allowed to use secure parking and booked straight in. Good quiet location short walk to hop on hop off stop. Fantastic staff nice room great bath. Short distance to Aviva stadium (5-10 min walk) great for the rugby internationals. 
",5,2017,08,07
222,Just okay,"Pro
Stayed there for 4 nights. Room was alright. Staff was friendly.

Con: 
1st day - coffee machine was uncleaned (used capsule from previous guest found). 
2nd day - towels, toilet paper and tissue box were not changed/refilled. Looks like room was not vacuumed.
3rd day - only 1 set of fresh towel was provided (no fresh towels for Sauna)

I blame the peak season but there is still room for improvement.",3,2017,08,06
222,Very impressed,Staff are lovely and very helpful. Its in a Great location with a lovely breakfast. We Had a room off the patio downstairs which was a great bonus for us.very clean and will stay again when in dublin.,5,2017,08,06
222,"Dissatisfied with the stay, wrong information provided about rooms","The rooms did not correspond to the rooms at the pictures on the booking.com website. The size of the room is very different form what is stated, when booking it shows that triple rooms are 30 sq.m. but the actual size of the room was less then 20 sq.m.  The hotel provides the best pictures of room but in the reality room we lived 105 was not small, dark and on the ground floor with some access to the public back yard and parking, so it was not even possible to open a window because people form other rooms could access the room 105. 
All the halls and corridors are very tiny, if you travel with a large luggage it is very inconvenient to move around the hotel. Also no place for the luggage in the room, we had to use an extra bed for it. 
The hotel manager was rude to us, screaming and shouting, sold the best room and put the people who arrived late to the rooms on the ground floor, small and dark which did not correspond to the rooms on the pictures.. Also they do not want to solve the issue until we had to contact the booking.com website, so upon check-out the issue wasn't solved. 
If you book this hotel, please do not expect to live in the rooms which are on the pictures and have the size that stated on the website. They are tricking people.",2,2017,08,04
222,Very nicely furbished house in a great location close to the city centre.,"WE stayed in one of the houses which are owned by Desmond , the owned of the Roxford Lodge. We booked the house thru AirBnB. 
The house was clean, modern and well appointed - with everything that we needed for our stay.
Location is excellent - several local bars and restaurants within 200 metres and a 20 minute walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc.
Desmond was an convivial and gracious host - and even provided us with some basic foodstuffs on arrival.
You will not be disappointed with this property.",5,2017,08,02
222,"Nice B and B, but expensive","The hotel is a large Victorian/Georgian house in a quiet area, within walking distance of the city and its attractions. The house has some elegant features, such as pretty lead-light windows and door panels, and the gardens are well-kept with borders containing shrubs and colourful flowers, also black wrought iron railings of the era. The room was comfortable with all the usual facilities (tea and coffee equipment, hair dryer, etc.), but I wouldn't call it 'boutique'. Bathroom was clean and stocked with the expected white towels and toiletries, and drinking water on tap. We had the Jacuzzi bath, but couldn't get it to work - didn't have time to ask about it. The room was fairly quiet, and away from traffic noises. There was an adequate selection of food and drink for breakfast, and the cooked option was delicious, although we thought that the price of the cooked breakfast could have been included in the price for room and breakfast. It was slightly confusing as it looked as if only continental breakfast was in the package on the website, but when the confirmation email came it stated that cooked breakfast was included. We were therefore surprised to be charged an extra €36 when we checked out. Enjoyed the stay at The Roxford, but thought it was expensive for this type of accommodation.",3,2017,08,01
222,Disappointing,"We had booked Roxford Lodge months in advance of our visit to Dublin as part of an earlybird rate offer. I had asked for a 4-poster bed after explaining that this was a romantic break away with my husband. Even with the offer it was still pricier than a lot of other hotels that we looked at (even with no breakfast included) but the fact that Roxford Lodge offered 'luxury and style' sealed the deal for us. We were distinctly underwhelmed. The room was pretty much the size of the bed. There was barely any cupboard space or room even for us to place both our weekend cases on the floor side by side. I appreciate that the hotel is described as 'boutique' but where was the luxury exactly? I ended up asking if there was a larger room available as this really was not what we had had in mind for our romantic break. After coughing up an extra £100 we were given a bigger room. The member of staff who helped was accommodating but didn't seem overly fussed that we were not happy at all with the closet we had been originally put in. The new room was fine but had absolutely no character, no period features or 4-poster bed. I feel like we might as well have stayed at a chain hotel, it would have been a lot cheaper and more central.",3,2017,08,01
222,Honeymoon,Location was very nice and room very clean. Staff was kind and helpful to us. We had a very nice stay. Location was close to downtown Dublin and easily walkable to and from different places. Nice neighborhood.,4,2017,07,31
222,Fantastic House at Roxford,"Spent two nights in the house with eight friends. We were met in the reception of the hotel, the receptionist then showed around the house, very polite and efficient. The house is immaculate and very spacious, we were even supplied with tea,coffee, bread etc. It takes about 20mins to walk into the city but staying in accommodation like this and the weather ( sunny and hot all weekend ) made it worthwhile.
Would certainly recommend staying in the hotel / house......fantastic house & staff 👍👍",5,2017,07,31
222,3 night stay for daughter's wedding,"Excellent on all counts - check-in, food, room quality, cleanliness, contact, staff - well done.  We stayed three nights and the staff contacted me when I hadn't vacated the room by 2 pm on day 2. They wanted to tidy the room - good work.",5,2017,07,31
222,The executive suite was beautiful and the staff very friendly!,"We greatly enjoyed our quick stay at this hotel and would happily return.  The staff were very friendly and helpful with breakfast and local tips.  The executive suite room that we stayed in was recently renovated and a beautiful, well-equipped room.  We enjoyed using the sauna, hot tub and large rain shower!",5,2017,07,30
222,"Nice, a good location","Clean and quiet hotel close to 3Arena, Avivia and RDS without being mobbed. Staff were polite, efficent and nothing was to much for them. Secure parking is a bonus and there was no noise.  Our room was small but was more than adequate.",4,2017,07,30
222,Very nice,"Spent two nights in this hotel. Friendly staff, very nice structure, good size room. 

A little bit far out from the center of Dublin, but overall it's perfect if you want to spend few nights and don't want to pay too much.",4,2017,07,27
222,Our home from home,"I'm reluctant to review Roxford Lodge as I selfishly don't want others to find it and make it harder for me to book. I always stay here, if I can, when visiting Dublin, even spent our honeymoon here when we were upgraded, very generously to the top suite.
It's a little walk out of the centre which is part of what I like about it - no crowds, no noise.
Beautifully finished with saunas, jacuzzi baths and tasteful decor - the staff are always polite and helpful - frankly, it's a pleasure to stay here.
",5,2017,07,26
222,Very nice - but wish closer to city centre,"I found the Roxford Lodge to be a good, quality place.   I only stayed one night at the end of my time in Ireland.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Breakfast was good, with a variety of options.  The dining room is not large.  I went when it opened, and it filled up rather quickly.

If I was staying longer, I would have liked the location to be closer to the city center.  It is within walking distance, about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on where you are going.  There is a city bus stop right outside the front door, and a stop for Aircoach to/from the airport one block away (bus 702 - Greystones).  The location is in a nice neighborhood.",4,2017,07,24
222,Nice stay in a peaceful hotel,"We stayed for three nights at Roxford lodge hotel, the place was nice and quiet and in a very lovely neighbourhood. Our room was quite small but we asked for a very quiet one facing the backyard. There is a bus going to the centre just outside the lodge hotel but we prefered walking. ",4,2017,07,24
222,Saturday night stay,"The guest house is in a lovely area and
the secure parking is great.
My room was very small, on the ground floor with access to a small yard.
The bed was very soft with no support.
I paid well over 200 euros for this room for one night but was charged extra for breakfast. 
A little mean perhaps.
",3,2017,07,24
222,A few days break,Great hotel. Friendly very helpful staff who assisted us with our excursion online bookings. We stayed in the room with Jacuzzi bath and infa red sauna which was lovely. Very clean and well located to the centre of Dublin within a 15 minute walk with great transport links. Would stay here again. Coffee and tea making facilities in the room was a nice touch.,5,2017,07,21
222,Sensational,"What a sensational room!! Very roomy, a sauna next to the bed, small balcony, spa bath, great area....what's not to love!!!! Thanks for a great stay to all staff. Car parking also for hire cars. Walking distance to city.",5,2017,07,21
222,Perfect for rest and exploration,"I spent one night at this hotel prior to joining an organized tour of Ireland. However, I would have no issue staying here multiple days if the occasion presented itself.

The staff at the front desk were very welcoming, unpretentious, and did their absolute best to check me in to my room well before the standard 3:00pm time (my flight arrived a 7:00am). 

The breakfast staff were equally friendly and efficient.

Breakfast offerings ranged from basic (cereal, fruit, juice, tea, etc. available as self-serve) to continental (which includes cooked to order porridge accompanied by slices of toast and a nicely prepared plate of cheese and ham) to full Irish breakfasts (again prepared to order and cost a little more). 
Note: all the breakfasts are separate from the room rate unless otherwise stated.

If there is one slight issue with the breakfast hour, it would be the dining space - limited seating and a little cramped. I recommend you get down there earlier rather than later.

With regards to the room,  it was very clean and cozy, had a comfortable bed, an infrared sauna (which I didn't try), tea kettle, complimentary tea, hairdryer, and iron with ironing board. Wi-Fi is available in all areas of the hotel on an open network, free of charge.

With respect to location, the Roxford is on a quiet but very well connected street in an affluent area of the city. The Aircoach from Dublin Airport stops just a 2 min. walk away from the hotel's main entrance (at the Schoolhouse Hotel) and there is a stop for other public transportation right out the door. 

I had no problem getting around the city on foot and most major sites are within reasonable walking distance from the hotel. Right away (across from where the Aircoach stop is located) you have the Grand Canal Walkway (which is very picturesque and divides the city into North & South). Turn left onto the walkway and follow it along to reach Leeson Street. Turn right on Leeson (north) and you'll end up at St. Stephen's Green (25 min.). Cross through the park and you'll get to Grafton Street (30 min). If you head North on Northumberland St (head right when you come out of the hotel) which becomes Mount Street, you'll hit the Tourist Office (Hop-off, Hop-on Bus), Trinity College, Temple Bar, the Liffey and Ha'penny Bridge in roughly 30-35 min.

When considering this hotel, I suggest you first look at their site for deals and book directly from there rather than a 3rd party. 

Again, while my stay was only for a night, it was long enough for me to realize that the Roxford is a perfect choice for a short stay in Dublin.",5,2017,07,17
222,Needs better service,"My friend and I just stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel and enjoyed our stay but sadly ,there were a few issues that let it down.
The check-in was from 2pm and we arrived after that but our room was not ready,not a huge thing and we were offered a lovely cup of tea and choccy biscuits,so that made up for it.
The room was lovely and the bed really comfy and we both had a good night's sleep although though it a little strange to have a sauna in the room!!!
However,the next morning was a bit of a let down.The night before we were told that breakfast was until 10.30am but in the morning we were then told it finished at 10 am.As it was 10 am when we were told this ,there was a bit of a panic but it turned out it was 1030 after all so panic over.
But when we went in to breakfast ,the tables had not been cleared and there were no clean glasses for juice ,it just looked messy.It seemed as if there was only one lady covering the breakfast for everything so she was trying to clear the tables ,take the orders ,bring the orders and at times she did ,I'm afraid ,get a bit muddled.She should have had some help .
The selection was very good but the French Toast was a bit bland so whilst the hotel is a lovely place to stay with pleasant ,happy staff,there really do need to be more of them to justify the label of Luxury accommodation.",4,2017,07,16
222,Loved it!,"Wonderful! Most European rooms are small. I was on my own and got a single. It had a sauna and a whirlpool tub. When I was there it was very hot. The room did not have AC and there were concerts going on so there was a lot of traffic with cars and people walking around partying. I had to leave the window open so did not sleep for almost 3 nights,(I stayed 5) I asked to be moved but no availability. On 3rd night begged for a fan or something or I was going to find other accommodation. I feel I should not have had to ask for one but offered so I could close the window for some quiet. Otherwise, it's very conveniently located and the tub was great after long days of walking and hiking.",4,2017,07,15
222,Quaint hotel walking distance from everything,"The people at the front desk were very helpful as we had questions and needed to call tour locations.  The rooms were nice, well maintained and quiet (at least in the back of the hotel where we stayed).  We had a single room on the ground floor and a family room for 3 on the top floor.  We really enjoyed that the hotel was walking distance, about 15 minutes from many of the places we wanted to visit, but not right in the noise of the city.  The breakfast was good though additional.  Not all rooms have air conditioning so ask if that is important to you.",5,2017,07,14
222,Very Disappointed in this Hotel,"We stayed here for one night before our tour started. The rooms are very small and it you have luggage there is very little room to open it, You end up tripping over the luggage.
It was difficult walking around the bed because of the TV and DVD player sticking out of the wall near the foot of the bed. I had set it up so our group had 6 rooms. I was a little embarrassed. Also you have to be able to walk to get to the on off bus. The hotel is in need of updating. The paint was peeling off the bath room ceiling, there was some black mold in between the tiles in the shower and when they touched up the paint on the walls it didn't match. The AC was also poor. 
On a positive note, the breakfast which is extra was very good !
Also, don't expect to get into your room until after 3pm.",2,2017,07,12
222,Like we were part of the family,"Stayed here for three nights while we were in Dublin.  Greeted on arrival by the nicest man who told us about Dublin and walked us personally to our room.  We were in one of the rooms in the back, which was very convenient because we could come in and out by the back gate.  Rooms were very clean and pleasant.  Parking was included as well as breakfast.  Breakfast was great- especially the homemade brown toast.  Would definitely stay here again on another trip.",5,2017,07,11
222,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"There were six of us and the townhouse was perfect for our group. Clean, quiet fast assistance whenever it was required. Special thanks to Des K. the manager who attended to everything with speed, effectiveness and a genuine sense of caring about his guests. Will stay here again next year!",5,2017,07,11
222,"Great place in Dublin, Hop On Hop Off bus stop right in front of hotel","We stayed here for 2 nights while in Dublin. I picked it because it has free parking. (And the car stayed there - believe me, you do not want to try driving in Dublin!) The Hop On, Hop Off bus stopped right in front of the hotel. This will get you to all the attractions in Dublin. Room was nice, people friendly. The breakfast (6 Euros for continental) was great  and included tea and coffee, hot porridge, cereals, fresh fruit salad, and an assortment of scones and breads, etc. 12 euros if you want eggs made to order. The only reason for the score of 4 is because it does not have air conditioning. We went at the end of June and, while we weren't hot, we would have liked it to be a little cooler. All we could do is open the sliding door to a small patio.",4,2017,07,09
222,Great place close to the Aviva stadium.,"Stayed here before that's why i booked again.Excellent service, friendly staff, rooms comfortable with sauna, tea/coffee on arrival. Kettle for tea & coffee machine in room with biscuits, also fridge. TV with dvd player & selection of dvds. Room was warm and the bed was very comfortable. Only one critique, towels just fit round the body and bit small for long hair after shower.",5,2017,07,06
222,Weekend in dublin," weekend away with the family, and we all had a great time staying at one of the houses through airbnb the quality was really high standard and the host made us feel very welcome i would definitely look to see if they had spaces on our next visit to dublin ",5,2017,07,03
222,Quirky ,"
Boutique hotel very conveniently located very near the Aviva stadium, the room had everything I could need coffee machine DVD player DVDs in the room etc, 22 bed hotel but only 16 seats at breakfast so I had to ask another guest if I could join him at his table, ",4,2017,07,02
222,Rooms decorated beautifully,"The room i had boasted a huge comfortable superKing  bed with gorgeous bedding & pillows, nespresso machine, biccies, fridge, tv (minimal channel choice) dvd player, wardrobe, desk & a little table. I loved the pretty panel of softly twinkling lights on the celing above the bed, the stained glass sky light, the gorgeous lighting accessories, excellent wifi  & i found it overall to be a really adorable small room with a quality feel about it (& complimentary bathroom toiletries). It led out to a little seated patio area next to the hotel car park & was generally quiet.

However, this was their disabled room, but it was impossible to get into it, in a wheelchair unaided. The very nice lady took us along tight little corridoors, off of which was an impossible tight angle into the room for a wheelchair user. So tight, that without my husband there to intervene & lift & jiggle my chair about, i wouldn't have gotten in. Once in we discovered the french doors from the outside would have been a doable in/out route. But to be honest, I'd have ruined the lovely soft grey carpets, especially during our rainy stay. It's a blessing that i'm light enough for my husband to carry me across the thresholds still, i didn't want to spend my time in a pretty room ruined by my dirty wheel marks & i didnt want to leave them a mess for the hotelier. 

The bathroom (wetroom style) was no easier. I use an electric wheelchair & the flooring seemed to have differing gradients to it which meant my wheels kept lifting off the floor making it impossible to acquire grip to manoeuvre about. Would likely be simpler in a manual chair. & the mirror was too high to see myself in. As a result i tried to go in as little as possible. It looked very pretty though 

Lastly, I knew of no way to gain access to any of the hotel's facilities...i couldn't get into the dining room which was disappointing because  it looked beautiful in the photos & i would've loved to have had a leisurely breakfast in there. Similarly, i couldn't access reception either. 

Overall my room was really beautiful, quiet & the bed was plush. Onsite parking was easy & we managed to find the hotel without problems. The lovely staff were super friendly & we were ever so grateful when they helped us out with a couple of things.

But the difficulties I faced as a wheelchair user, made me feel really disabled, & I hate that feeling. 

My overall rating is 5 stars for the gorgeous boutique hotel with wonderful staff that it is, & 3 stars for my experience as a wheelchair user.",3,2017,07,02
222,Fantastic Ten Days in Dublin at 125 Lansdowne Park,"We would highly recommend 125 Landsdowne Park.   It is as advertised, if not better.   The rooms are all spacious and well appointed.  We had everything we needed for a delightful ten day stay.   The beds and cots are all comfortable.  The kitchen is bright, modern and well equipped.   There is a lovely, private courtyard accessible from the kitchen and private parking available at the front of the house.   The house is a perfect layout for a large group of people and the location is absolutely perfect.    It is close to Grafton Street, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, many restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, the DART, and the Aviva Stadium.  We walked for miles and it was nice to return to such a comfortable house at the end of the day.   The day we arrived, we found that the kitchen had been stocked with basic supplies for preparing breakfast - coffee, cereal, milk, sugar, juice, etc.     It was really nice to have laundry facilities available in the house.  The neighbourhood is quiet.  We woke to the sound of birds singing, not traffic noises.  We all agreed that the house was perfect for our clan and that we would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,07,01
222,Wonderful Stay!,"My recent stay at Roxford Lodge was lovely, comfortable and enjoyable. Staff were kind and helpful, especially when guiding me to the city centre. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk to city centre, but Dublin was experiencing some nice weather, so a walk by the canal and through St. Stephens Green was worth the time. Breakfast was lovely and filling. Room was a little smaller than I imagined, but it was a single room, and surprisingly comfortable. If in town again, would certainly consider staying here again.",4,2017,06,29
222,Feedback,"I had a single room. Tired after  a long haul flight  I was glad for little luxuries: no hussles/rules,  easy access via airport shuttle, comfortable bed,  best matrass ever,  spa bath , lift for bags. Easy wifi access.  Breakfast was excellent and good value for money : freshest berries .  Hospitable!",5,2017,06,29
222,"Lovely, cozy hotel, great location. ","This is a really good hotel. 
We stayed 2 nights in a very nice but slightly smaller room than we would have liked. 
Unfortunately Dublin hotels in Summer are priced at top global rates (easily triple the low season prices) and clearly there is a shortage of good hotels, ergo the price. 
It is a fantastic location and the staff were very friendly. The room was spotless, even though the hotel is undergoing redecoration (during peak Summer! I wonder why?). 
(Curiously, WiFi was not the best for the heart of a capital city) 
I will certainly use the hotel again in the off season, and book a bigger room next time. It is just so convenient and the owners are certainly working hard to satisfy their guests. 
Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Appreciated the free parking. ",4,2017,06,28
222,Quaint,"Great place to stay, convenient location, easy to get to from airport. We stayed two nights, and the included breakfast is worthwhile (and good value at 6EUR), but it is made even more enjoyable by the lovely lady who serves it. She has a quiet charm about her. Our room whilst very small was adequate for our stay.",4,2017,06,28
222,Last leg of our trip,"This was the last place we stayed after a week in Scotland before catching our plane from Dublin to JFK. The man who checked us in was the most thorough and welcoming, he helped us carry our bags to the room. Perfect location to catch buses into Dublin or to the airport. Rooms were very comfortable and even had a sauna! Great stay.",5,2017,06,28
222,Stylish lodging with easy access to central Dublin,"My daughter and I stayed here while I attended a conference in Dublin and visited with friends. We were delighted to find that the Aircoach bus from the airport literally stops in front of the hotel, as do buses that go into the center city. And to our surprise, the updated rooms have jacuzzis and personal saunas. All the staff we encountered were professional and in good spirits, and did their best to help us. We would stay here again.",5,2017,06,27
222,Near Aviva stadium,Lovely hotel. We had room in basement which opened out onto a lovely little terrace.Bus stop across the road for town. Safe carparking. We had continental breakfast which was lovely .very clean room. Would stay here again,4,2017,06,27
222,Near Excellent !,First off ---- I'd recommend this hotel without hesitation although it fell just short of really excellent. The good is that the hotel provides great value for the money; really nice and helpful staff; in room sauna; a first class breakfast and some local options for dinner. The less than excellent part is that the hotel really is a full 20 minute walk to anything in the city and if your looking to visit ghe north and west of the city you'll need to taxi or take a bus. Also ---- our bad timing had us visiting while they were doing maintenance in the hallways (patching/painting. While not a major issue; it dd kind of dampen the ambience.,4,2017,06,25
222,Great Accommodation,"Roxford Lodge was very impressive, being great location, excellent hospitality and very clean.
We were greeted with friendliness and warmth. The room was downstairs which was smallish, but staying one night wasn't to much of a concern. It had secure car parking off the street which was also a bonus. Breakfast is served in a quaint room with an abundance of breakfast delights with both a continental or cooked. The elderly lady that served us was a delight, being very friendly and polite.
The gentleman that booked us in was so helpful and kind. I had left my phone charger at another hotel and location, 2 hours away, and he kindly found me both adapter and charger from surplus stock he had. He also offered us location advise. We found the communication and emails very professional.
Thank you all.",5,2017,06,22
222,Good and bad,"Stayed here for one night for the Robbie Williams concert with my wife.

Good: The staff were friendly. Location was great for the Aviva stadium and there were a few bars in the vicinity. It's about a 15 minute walk to the city centre for the Mrs to go shopping. Bed was big l, clean and comfy, and the room had ample facilities, kettle, coffee machine, iron, mini fridge, safe. One glaring omission which I'll mention later. Breakfast was superb, with a great selection of hot food, cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurts and juices.

Bad: The bathroom was the main problem. It was clean enough, however there was black mould on the walls and ceiling. The door frame also had traces of mould and appeared rotted. When I had my shower the next morning I walked across the floor bare footed and had to wipe my feet before putting my socks on because there was dirt and stones on my soles from the floor. There was also no air conditioning in the room, which wasn't great on the warmest day / night of the year so far, and I couldn't leave the window open due to road noise.

Overall it wasn't bad, but it could just do with some TLC, aircon, and a decent run over with a vacuum!",3,2017,06,20
222,Quirky gem,"Small efficient room.  Clean and completely stocked (blow dryer, mirrors, hot water pot for tea, etc.). Shocking surprise of jacuzzi tub and a full sauna.  Staff was wonderfully helpful and breakfast and server were wonderful.",5,2017,06,20
222,Beautiful Hotel,Myself and my husband stayed here for a quick stop over. It's a beautiful hotel in a quiet area with secure parking. The hotel is beautifully decorated and our room was lovely and comfy... check in excellent and all staff top class for customer service and a beautiful welcome. We will definitely be returning!! ,5,2017,06,19
222,Amazing Room,Stayed in the suite in the Roxford Lodge Hotel and can't recommend it enough. If you want to treat your partner to a romantic trip away in Dublin this is the room you should pick if available. Hotel is slightly out from the city centre but only 10 minutes in a taxi.,5,2017,06,19
222,Beautiful hotel,"Three of us shared a room at the Roxford for two different stays in May.  It was quite lovely, very clean, the beds were comfy, and the bath was roomy.  The room itself was a bit tight for all our luggage, and the lift wasn't convenient to use as we had to roll our luggage through the kitchen storage area.  I would have preferred to have extra space in the room and done without the sauna. The woman working the front desk on the evenings of May 13 &14 was outstanding.  She helped us with our luggage, offered advice on places to eat, came to our room a couple of times to help us, printed our boarding passes, made change so we could ride the bus into town, ordered a cab for us the night before for an early morning departure and more.  I wish I had gotten her name so that I could recognize her properly.  She was the epitome of customer service. Breakfast was delicious.  The neighborhood was lovely and felt safe.  I liked having a code to enter the building when the front desk wasn't staffed. They stored our larger pieces of luggage while we took a 3-day trip to southern Ireland.  I would definitely stay at the Roxford if ever in Dublin again.",4,2017,06,16
222,Nice ambiance,"Room in the ground floor with much equipment on small space. Enjoyed the Nespresso machine, DVDs and the hot tub ;-) Excellent Irish breakfast. Attentive service.  Only 10 minutes walk to Aviva Stadium, Airport transfer coach stops only two minutes from hotel.",4,2017,06,13
222,Just the perfect distance from bustling Dublin,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay of three nights. We originally planned for four but the West of Ireland was calling and we had seen all we wanted to in Dublin. A special thank you to Agnes and her great breakfasts and conversation. I could wake up every day for the rest of my life to that room, that food and reading ""The Irish Times"" over my breakfast. We had many a lovely stroll and appreciated the quiet confines of the Roxford Hotel. I would recommend you pay the extra for a garden room with patio access. The beds were very comfortable and the place was very clean. ",5,2017,06,10
222,"Great hotel, nice location",Sweet little b&b type boutique hotel located in a really nice neighborhood just about 15 minutes walk from the city center. Rooms were nice with a sweet jacuzzi tub and a personal in room sauna. Would definitely recommend this place! ,5,2017,06,10
222,Beautiful Place to Stay,"Had a great time at Roxford Lodge Hotel. Room and facilities excellent. Staff friendly and helpful and the breakfast, by far, the best selection we had in the UK. There were four people in our group staying in one room. We found the room to be spacious enough for four people to move around comfortably. The bathroom was large and well set out. Thoroughly  enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,06,10
222,Great location and great facilities,"Lovely well equipped room, a 'tad' small, but I was on my own so a single was fine. Lovely bathroom, and excellent staff. I didn't get a chance to sample the breakfast as I had a very early ferry (which is only 15 minutes drive away). On Saturday I strolled into the town centre and found a lovely pub with decent food. Sorry I can't remember the name! Doh!",5,2017,06,09
222,Odder than a box of frogs,"When I look for a suitable hotel for either a work or leisure trip I tend to look first at a location that works and then find a hotel within that location that suits my budget and that looks good from the photos.  This one is certainly in a location that suited me well as I don't need to be in the city centre but rather closer to some meeting venues.  It was also priced reasonably for a single traveller, though not a bargain by any means.

However, the room itself bore no resemblance to the overall expectations set by the photos of the property.  I mean really no resemblance at all.  

It troubles me that, at some hotels, it seems to be necessary to pay the very top room rate for the most executive of executive rooms in order to be able to find those rooms that have been used for the indicative photos.

It's utterly depressing to discover that the room to which you are actually assigned is so different from those in the photos that you have to double check that you booked the correct hotel.

I would suggest specifying that you have one of the rooms actually featured.",2,2017,06,06
222,Return visit,"Having recently returned to Roxford Lodge, and decided to stay in their new Exclusive Suite.It was just luxurious .Designed to such a high standard ,pastel relaxing decor,high standard fixtures and fittings,sauna,jacuzzi bath and T.V on one level,large bedroom (very comfortable bed) plasma TV,fridge etc.lower level beautiful large bathroom with large rain shower.Amazing experience .

As usual location fantastic ,RDS,Aviva,great restaurants ,bars,bus service outside the door.very friendly helpful staff.and excellent breakfast ,all freshly cooked to order,just love going to this Luxury family run Hotel,park up the car for free safe and secure.and Enjoy Dublin.",5,2017,06,05
222,Short but sweet visit,"Arrived slightly before check-in time, but room was already available. Situated in a quiet, Georgian area, the Roxford is ideally set away from the busy city centre but is still accessible by foot in about 15mins. We were there for a gig at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre which is again only about 15-20 mins by foot. Room had a mini-sauna and whirlpool bath (neither of which we had time to try), nor did we avail ourselves of the in-house catering due to travel schedule restraints. Would use it again as it's nice and quite and well appointed. Handily placed for the 702 service to/from DUB airport.",5,2017,06,05
222,Vacation 2017,I stayed at the Roxford Lodge on 2 different occasions in May and in 2 different single rooms. Both rooms were very comfortable and had enough room for what I needed.One room had a sauna in it and both had jacuzzi tubs and shower. The bus stop is right outside the door which is very convenient when using public transportation. I had the continental breakfast which was just enough and Agnes was very helpful to make sure I had everything I needed. Florencia and Caoimhe were wonderful helping me with directions to attractions I wanted to see and offering me tea in the evening when I returned. I was extremely impressed with the hospitality I received. I look forward to staying at the Roxford Lodge again. Thanks again for everything!,5,2017,06,04
222,Lovely hotel for a short break,"All the staff we met at the hotel were super. Agnes was there to welcome us despite our late arrival due to our flight times. She was there again at breakfast making sure we had everything we needed. Breakfast was very reasonably priced and of a high quality. I only had the continental but a friend had the full Irish on each morning. Have to say the brown bread was amazing.
The only  2 negative comments I have is the lack of storage space in the room. We have no issue with a small room but we do need somewhere to store our clothes and two tiny bedside drawers just isn't enough. My advice would be to get rid of the baths and install shower cubicles....our shower head was great but bath very slippy.
We plan to return - if we can get tickets for Scotland vs Ireland and this hotel will be our first port of call when looking for a room.",4,2017,06,01
222,Really comfortable stay,"Spent the night in the Roxford Lodge for a business trip. Thought the hotel was really quaint and kinda quirky in a cool way. I stayed in a room which was at the back of the hotel and it was detached from the main part. Really quiet and peaceful - it felt like I was at home. 

The room itself was well equipped with jacuzzi bath, 'big rain head' shower, fridge, lock safe, DVDs / DVD player, Wifi which was quick, air-con, iron / ironing board but most of all a comfortable bed. There were also different light options - I know, it seems an unusual thing to say but it means there is lighting in the room to suit any person.

There was also a nice desk area with a proper night light which meant I could catch up on work after I ate. 

Breakfast was nice and throughout my stay, every single member of staff was more than accommodating. 

Would definitely recommend to anyone wishing to stay for a business trip or even a leisurely night away.",5,2017,06,01
222,Beautiful location,"Very friendly staff, beautiful area & hotel. Great breakfast provided in the morning.  Safe area, numerous pubs & restaurant around. The staff helped us out while we stayed there as it was our first time in the UK.",4,2017,05,30
222,"Great hotel, great location","Great little hotel, close to the city centre but the local bars and restaurants mean you really do t have to bother. The rooms are clean, and the jacuzzi baths very welcome at the end of the Wicklow Way walk. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There is a large selection for breakfast, I highly recommend the omelettes!! ",5,2017,05,29
222,Amazing Hotel,It is a very welcoming and comfortable hotel. The room was huge and great for the value. It is not to far from the city center. We got a large Jacuzzi and sauna in the room. We stayed for a concert and the hotel was only 20 minutes from the three arena.,5,2017,05,27
222,Perfect hotel,"Everything is perfect in this hotel. I felt there as in home. The room was cozy and comfortable, with all the things we need to have a nice stay. Even a Nespresso coffee machine with different capsules! The breakfast was also very good with high quality products. I totally recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,22
222,3 Night Stay in May,"A great stay, staff were helpful, room was very comfy, car park was fantastic.  I didn't have food at the hotel, but some excellent restaurants and a great cafe only 5 minutes walk from the hotel.  One thing, the car park access is at the rear of the hotel, so don't forget to factor this in when you are setting your Sat Nav.",5,2017,05,22
222,Great stay at a nice small hotel ,I stayed at Roxford Lodge Hotel during a conference that took place at UCD Belfield in May 2017. The room was rather small but nice and clean and also had a small whirlpool and an infrared cabin. Staff was very friendly. Although it's a bit from the city center it's well connected to the city center by bus - there's a bus station right in front of the hotel. The bus stop with connections to the university at UCD Belfield is about an 8 minutes walk from the hotel. I really can recommend Roxford Lodge Hotel. ,5,2017,05,20
222,Nice Hotel/Lodge in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed here one night in May, 2017.  It has parking on-site, which was a big plus, because parking in Dublin can be quite a chore.  The room was nice and cozy, and the clerk, Desmond, was extremely friendly and helpful in helping us navigate to a couple nearby tourist spots, as well as recommending some nice pubs and restaurants.  There's also a bus stop right in front, so hopping on/off a bus here is really easy.  Breakfast in the morning was good, and we were very pleased overall.",4,2017,05,19
222,"Central, Clean with Parking on site","I stayed here for one night in May 2017z One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Neat and very Clean room.

Basement rooms looks like they are getting refurbished from observation while going to car park 

Young lady at reception was very friendly and informative. 

10mins walk to Aviva stadium ",4,2017,05,17
222,"Amazing city, excellent stay in Roxford Lodge Hotel","We were celebrating a stag party in Dublin and stay over at Roxford Lodge. It was an amazing experience. The staff was friendly and gave us great advices. The rooms were clean and have plenty of facilities. The showers were great and even the dishwashing-machine was brilliant with its led-lights. This hotel is within walking distance from the city centre and bus stop towards the city centre is right in front of the reception. In short, if you go to Dublin, go to Roxford Lodge Hotel.",5,2017,05,16
222,Lovely Lodge,"We stayed a total of 6 days at the Roxford. It was in a lovely quiet part of Dublin. It is a leisurely walk to the center of the city where all the museums, great eateries, and land marks are located. There are also delicious restaurants near the lodge. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and well appointed, so much more homelike than a chain or standard hotel room. We were 3 adults and were comfortable and relaxed in the room. The owners are on the premises daily working to make your stay wonderful.",5,2017,05,16
222,"Good price, small room","The room is a bit small with little room to put luggage yet the bathroom is of good size. Everything looks clean, bed and sheets are comfortable. At 109 euro a nite guess it is still good value considering it is located at the edge of city center. We had rental car and there is on site parking. Using public transport should be fine as there is bus stop right in front of the property.",4,2017,05,15
222,Room small but perfectly formed,"This hotel offers a very wide variety of rooms and suites in an exquisitely appointed townhouse. It is very conveniently situated on a bus route with secure parking to leave your car whilst visiting the sights of Dublin.
Enquire carefully when booking of the size of your room. My standard double, which is one of four such, three of which have sauna and jacuzzi, and which seems to imply a reasonable size. In the event I was allocated room 121 which is the one without those facilities and can only be described as tiny. Nonetheless I would go again.",4,2017,05,15
222,Dublin for three nights,I booked the Roxford Lodge a couple months ago. I was looking for a quaint place to stay within walking distance to the city center. This fit the bill. We were only about a 15 minute walk to Marion Square where we picked up the Hop on Hop off Bus. St. Stephens Green is another 5 minutes from there. The service here was excellent. Agnes the breakfast hostess was outstanding. Wonderful personality. I cannot remember the name of the young lady at the front desk at night but she was also wonderful. The only negative was the room size but we managed. The jetted tub was a plus after walking and riding so much! The bed was comfortable. A nice breeze came in through the window at night. I can imagine it getting a little warm in there during the summer months. Overall a good place to stay.,4,2017,05,11
222,Great Visit,"Nice property with very helpful staff-especially Stephanie who went out of her way to help get our boarding passes printed when the guest computer was down.  Location was perfect for city bus or walking into the city center, and catching the airport bus.  We stayed in room 135(?) which was one of two rooms outside and behind the main building.  Room was remodeled and spacious but was up against a narrow street which was sometimes a little noisy.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,10
222,Beautiful place pity about the downpour of water from the bathroom upstairs!,"We stayed in a lovely double room but the next morning we were woken up by a downpour of water coming from the ceiling...I quickly informed reception who called me back a few mins later and told me the room above had flooded their bathroom!  the water was pouring down so i told them we had moved the bed and put the bin under it but the water was going everywhere reception told me someone would be up to help!!! no one appeared!!! we waited and still no one arrived. at this stage we were getting very worried as there was noise coming from the electrics so we couldnt even touch the lights or anything in case we got electrocuted!! when no one arrived to help we just gave in, and went down for breakfast. when checking out i spoke with the receptionist about what happened but she was more worried about getting us to pay the extra €24 euros we owed for breakfast than the awful experience we had!!!!",1,2017,05,09
222,A breath of fresh air in Dublin!,"My mother and I stayed here last week.  The staff was warm, welcoming, and always ready to answer questions; which was a huge help.  The breakfast was wonderful, tea in the lounge was delightful, and it was in a nice neighborhood, with the added bonus of the city bus stop just steps away, making it very easy and cheap to get downtown with a minimum of fuss.  I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2017,05,04
222,"Roxford Lodge in Dublin, Ireland","Lovely hotel is a great location.  Bus stop right outside the hotel. literally.  Parking in the rear, but it is tight getting in and out.  We took out car back to the hotel and bought Hop On Hop Off bus tickets to tour city and we could use our tickets from that to take city busses around Dublin.  A few blocks from St. Mary's Cathedral for Sunday Mass.  The rooms were large enough, bed was comfortable, nice selections of DVDs in the room (several on Irish History - which was great), nice bathroom and a sauna in room.  We were here for 5 days.  Breakfast was lovely, continental and offered full Irish as well.  The rooms were quiet, no street noise.  Hotel staff were very kind and accommodating.",4,2017,05,04
222,Great location,The Roxford Hotel is close to Dublin centre  but in a quiet location. The bus stop into Dublin centre is located right outside the hotel.  The room was comfortableand very clean.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good and made to order. Nothing was too much trouble.,4,2017,05,01
222,"Clean, comfortable and great location ","We stayed here recently for 3 nights. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was on another level which was a nice feature as often city centre hotel rooms are very small. 

This is in a pretty part of Dublin and is really convenient for the airport. The aircoach stop is a 2 minute walk from the hotel which is ideal. A return ticket was  €14. 

The hotel location  was great, it is around a 20 minute walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College etc. There are lots of restaurants on Upper Baggot Street which is about a 10 minute walk away.

There was  sauna in the room which was a little unusual and we didn't get a chance to use it. The bath was also a jacuzzi bath, but we used the shower instead.

The room had a safe, iron and a hairdryer (the hairdryer was reasonably powerful too)

I would recommend this hotel. The decor is a little dated but overall the building is beautiful.",4,2017,04,29
222,"Ideal, comfortable, quiet Dublin hotel","The Roxford is just close enough to Dublin centre to be walkable (15-20 minutes if you don't rush) but far enough from the bustle that you can be guaranteed a quiet nights sleep. The rooms are fairly large for the price and come with some really fun extras (I won't spoil the surprise!) and all the essentials: bath, free wifi, big TV with DVD player, even a little balcony. Staff are really excellent, from kitchen staff to the front desk, and the free tea service in the lounge is a really nice touch. Everything is made very easy for you, no stress, plenty of advice on transport or restaurants, plenty of complimentary extras and overall just a very pleasant place to stay. The only downside is I can imagine if you have any mobility difficulties it might be a bit far away from the centre but there is a bus stop very close by.",5,2017,04,29
222,Quiet and comfortable,"After a long airplane flight the Roxford was a wonderful spot for some deep, quiet sleep in a comfortable bed with a private bath. We had a Classic Deluxe room; on the next trip we might try to upgrade a bit. While this room suited our needs for this trip, and was good size by European standards, we started to feel a bit claustrophobic by the end of our five days here. It was a bit like staying in the extra room at your mother's home. That said, people here were cheery and helpful and the price was right. The breakfast here was satisfactory, but we enjoyed walking to breakfast at Junior's, or taking a taxi to breakfast at the Queen of Tarts. Airport bus was easy and inexpensive. Easy to get a taxi or bus, and just a few blocks from DART for longer excursions.",4,2017,04,29
222,Wonderful base for a city break.,"We stayed in the 4 bedroom town house, as a family of 5 it can sometimes be difficult to find hotel rooms that will accommodate us, so this was a perfect solution.
The children all had their own rooms and having three bathrooms was a luxury!  the house was spacious and well appointed and we were given bread, coffee, tea, jam and milk when we arrived plus the cupboards were well stocked with cereal etc
This was the perfect base to explore Dublin and we would highly recommend.",5,2017,04,28
222,Would recommend,"My husband and I where in Dublin for concert we spent one night in the roxford. On arrival we where able to park in a secure car park and leave car there. Booking in was straight forward we where taken to our room and told how everything worked. The room was beautiful, there was a tv with loads of DVD,s, coffee machine and what gave it the whao factor was a sauna in the room. 
We will definitely be back but next time it will be for more than one night 😊",5,2017,04,27
222,Karen,"Wonderful place to stay!! Within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and pubs. Very comfortable and clean.Staff was extremely kind. Let us check in early.  Would definitely stay here again. Beautiful garden. Free parking behind Hotel.",5,2017,04,26
222,Within walking distance to Dublin attractions.,"We arrived from the USA at 0600 from an overnight flight and were extremely tired. We stopped by the hotel to see if we could leave our luggage and they were so kind!! The women at the desk sent us to a lovely lounge and brought a tray with coffee and biscuits. She let us check into our room so we could take a nap before heading to the Dublin highlights. 
I would highly recommend this hotel. Conveniently located. Staff was incredible. Would stay here again!",5,2017,04,26
222,Great stay,"Great hotel. Extremely clean room. Good breakfast. Great location just outside city centre if you don't mind walking (which i didn't, allows you to discover city streets). Very secure parking and front door.",5,2017,04,26
222,Great place to stay!,"The Roxford was such a great find!  It's a short walk to Grafton St, Temple Bar, Merrion and St Stephens green, but is located in a quiet neighborhood.  The staff are friendly and very accommodating.  Breakfast was delicious!  The room was clean and had all the basic necessities (oddly, there was a sauna in the middle of the room??).  The decor could use a bit of an update, but honestly, that's part of the Roxford's charm.  I would highly recommend staying here!",5,2017,04,24
222,Roxford Lodge Townhouses,"Just returned from a fantastic weekend staying in Dublin. Booked the two 4 bed townhouses for a friends hen do. The houses are absolutely amazing, they have anything and everything you could possibly think of, even down to being provided with bread, milk and tea and coffee which was not expected and really appreciated given that we didn't arrive until late evening. Fantastic value for money, location is literally 5 mins from the Aviva stadium so perfect for if attending anything there. Staff are friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Would definitely return!!",5,2017,04,24
222,Great Stay! Free Parking!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Roxford Lodge. We typically only stay in chain hotels because of reward points, but Dublin is a city with few chains and those few have insanely high prices for parking. The Roxford was exactly what we were looking for. Location was great and short cab ride from the downtown area... a 30 minute walk if you don't mind! Definitely worth saving 60 euro/night on parking! The rooms are cozy, full of character, and much nicer than I have previously seen in bed and breakfasts. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again next time we are in Dublin. We did not eat the breakfast here, but about a 5 minute walk away is an awesome cafe called Food Game... which has avocado toast to die for.",5,2017,04,23
222,Great Stay!,"My daughter and I stayed here for our first night in Dublin.  The neighborhood is quiet, the room (two twins) was clean, well appointed, and the staff (thanks Jasmine!) was so friendly and helpful!  Perfect place to get the ""lay of the land"" as it was our first  day in Ireland.  We were a bit bleary eyed upon arrival but  the quiet accommodations at the end of the day provided 12+ hours of pleasant sleep!  Morning breakfast was delightful and a great way to get started on a full day of sightseeing.  It is near the bus line, which we opted out of so we could get a nice walk in to the city center, which took about 20 minutes;  walking by pretty parks and the Oscar Wilde memorial too!  Great location to visit national galleries.  Felt very at home here and plan to return next visit.",5,2017,04,19
222,First time four days in Dublin :) We enjoyed our journey !,Everything was excellent and  very friendly !!! We felt us save from the first Minute on. The kindness and Flair of the Roxford Lodge Hotel made us feel like home. Breakfast was super ! Thank you very much !,5,2017,04,19
222,Dublin Ireland,"Roxford Lodge is located in Ballsbridge about two blocks from the Mount street bridge, and about a twenty minute walk from Trinity college campus.  Mount street bridge was one of the blocking positions during the 1916 Easter rebellion, and was the scene of some heavy fighting; belied by the diminutive nature of the marker. The lodge is completely updated with amenities and a warm and welcoming staff. The quiet warmth of the neighborhood is a refreshing contrast to the hustle and bustle of City Center with tree lined streets shading elegant brick townhouses.  The location is near perfect, and the lodgings a comfortable mix of modern amenities and European charm.

In addition, Roxford Lodge is bringing on a cottage property with four bedrooms and baths which we were able to sample. The cottage is totally renovated with a modern kitchen, washer dryer, parking and separate entrance. This is big enough for several couples with children. 

All in all,a compete pleasure, and not over priced for what you get.",5,2017,04,17
222,Enjoyable stay,"My daughter and I were very pleased with our 2-night stay at the Roxford. It was a convenient base to visit the Dublin sites while being in a residential neighborhood away from traffic,etc. The staff was helpful, congenial, and the breakfase was great.",5,2017,04,17
222,Cozy nice place,"A really good experience overall. 
We got a nice cozy little room. A little crammed with the luggage since there is no way to put it but reasonable still. 
The room had everything you need from a hotel room including a fridge and a safe both which I personally find essential. 
The hotel also has every service needed available on site like free coffee/tea delivered to your room anytime, phone, front desk manned for any question etc.

It has couple of issues however. The distance to the city center can be a burden. It takes about 30 minutes to walk (Temple Bar) or a bus which are not the best in Dublin and standing a lot in traffic. It's nice to walk it once or twice but to do it couple of times every day is inconvenient. 
Another issue is the breakfast. If you don't have it included it's pretty pricey for what you're getting and you have a ton of better options in the city but you have to walk the walk for that. ",4,2017,04,13
222,Excellent Staff,Fabulous and comfortable. But most importantly for us - the friendly welcome. Breakfast was great and again served by a lovely friendly lady each morning . The reception staff were more than friendly and went beyond the call to help us .,5,2017,04,11
222,Homey spot in Dublin,We stayed here after a hiking trip and found it to be very well located in a convenient and quite residential neighborhood.  The room we had was perfect for my husband and I plus our teen age son. He had his own nook which was quite private.,4,2017,04,11
222,quaint city hotel,"A lovely hotel with lots of character. great location. Very helpful staff.
We stayed in a lovely family room. the kids loved it.
A sauna in the room was an added bonus.
Very quiet no traffic noise. Off street parking.",4,2017,04,07
222,Great value for money,"We stayed in one of the houses and were delighted with everything, we were nicely  surprised when we were told to help ourselves to the food in the cupboard and fridge really didn't expect that and as we had 4 kids it was very convenient  for us. We had a small emergency while we were there and the staff were very very helpful especially Florence on the front desk. We would highly recommend this hotel and when we return to Dublin we would be looking to stay there again",5,2017,04,06
222,2 nights in Dublin,"very helpful staff, great breakfast, quiet room with high ceilings.  the room was small but all we needed.  the rate was great.  would definitely stay here again, the next time i'm in Dublin.

Would definitely recommend.
",5,2017,04,05
222,"Good value, charming hospitality & great location!","Roxford Lodge is just a lovely place to stay. I found all the staff helpful and well informed; the location is perfect - spoilt for choice for wonderful places to have dinner, including simple, inexpensive options.  I liked the basket of snacks and an honesty box, the calm and comfortable lounge with a computer (we don't all travel with laptops,so this was great!).  My room even had an espresso machine.  If you're heading for the airport, there's a bus stop two minutes away.  Top marks I'd say.",5,2017,04,02
222,Lovely stay,"Mum and granny had a lovely time here. The rooms were clean and felt homely, the service was very good and they simply enjoyed the stay. Most of Dublin is very accessible from the location, even though it is a bit further east",5,2017,04,02
222,Nice hotel!,"This is a quaint hotel close to everything in Dublin.  Loved the close parking to our room and the charm of the hotel, a perfect first night in Ireland!  A little bit hard to find down the small street behind the hotel, don't trust Garmin on this one, but when you are there a perfect room!",4,2017,04,01
222,Would not return to this hotel,"This a hotel I would definitely not recommend. 
When I arrived, the staff member on reception was very dismissive. I felt as if she was trying to get me out of her sight as quick as she could. I had questions to ask about the area (buses, restaurants e.t.c) but I dare not ask.
I ordered room service that I never received. 
My room was cold the whole night and the staff member could not work the thermostat.
Also the full irish breakfast that is on offer is way over priced. You can get a better one elsewhere. 
Overall I would not recommend.",2,2017,03,29
222,Ideal location 5 mins walk from Aviva stadium,I stayed in economy single room for 1 night. It contained a sauna and jacuzzi. Room and bathroom were both very clean. Good breakfast. Could find no fault with my stay and all staff were very helpful.,5,2017,03,27
222,Great Dublin location!,"We found this gem of a property very lovely and well maintained. The continental breakfast is great value (as is the hotel overall) - fruit, cereals, cheese plate, toast, coffee, etc. all for 6 euro. :)  Staff were all so helpful and friendly, and the neighbourhood is great - very quiet and safe, but only a 15-minute walk into the heart of things. I personally really enjoyed being (slightly) away from the city's craziness at the end of the day. Our room was small but beautiful and spotlessly clean. I think the hotel had some renovations or painting going on but it didn't disturb us in any way and wasn't really visible to guests at all (seemed to be in another wing behind a closed door). The guest lounge with printer (for things like boarding passes) was very appreciated. They've thought of everything. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2017,03,26
222,The best hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the hotel to watch Wales v republic of Irelaand.As soon as we walked towards the hotel,you could feel the welcome with the lovely garden and it's lovely daffodils in bloom.The young blonde woman on the reception was very polite and helpfull.she showed us to our rooms which were very clean and was very patient in answering our questions and guiding us to the best pub!!.The bathroom and sleeping quarters had everything you needed even DVDs so you could watch a film!The beds were nice and comfortable and you felt at home.The Full Irish breakfast was sublime and you could have cereal,juices,cheese e.t.c.....It's worth staying there just for the breakfast!!...The owner was like my mother and you felt at home....definetly would book again on my next stay in Dublin.",5,2017,03,25
222,"Lovely hotel, lovely service","We just spent two nights at the Rockford Lodge Hotel and enjoyed every minute. Delicious breakfasts (not included), friendly, kind and extremely helpful receptionists with excellent recommendations for food and shopping, and welcoming us with coffee and biscuits when we arrived very early. Special shoutout to Florence and Caoimhe and colleague for such great service!!",5,2017,03,24
222,Didnt Actually Stay at hotel due to Issue with Room.,"I booked the Executive Room at the Roxford Lodge Hotel over a year ago for my husbands 30th birthday. I was made aware that they were refurbishing the room was being refurbished but should be ready by mid-late January, however as stay wasn't until 16th March I was not concerned.
Arrived at hotel as planned afternoon 16/03/17 to be told by receptionist that there was an issue with our room and that alternative arrangements had been made in a 4* hotel nearby and that they would cover all transfers to new hotel etc. 
Obviously I was disappointed as the reviews for this hotel are amazing, however given the circumstances the Roxford more than sorted the issue and our alternative accommodation at The Spencer was superb. 
My only criticism would be that it was left to the receptionist to break the news and keep us placated, despite hearing the owners come into reception and enquire if we wish to see the room whilst we waited for our taxi, no one came in to see us personally. 
On this note the Lounge and location of this hotel seemed lovely.",4,2017,03,21
222,Wonderful location - Excellent pub round the corner,"Hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff were all wonderful.
Could not have got anywhere much closer to the Aviva stadium, which is why we were there!
I was hoping for a bar, but the staff were very happy to bring you anything you wanted either in the lounge or to your room.
Spa baths are a lovely added luxury",5,2017,03,21
222,Great location,"Stayed here four four nights recently. Its situation in a broad, quiet street near the river is fabulous. It was so easy and pleasant to walk into the city from the hotel; although there are bus stops very close to the hotel.
The hotel is quite small, but has an imposing frontage. The staff are first class, helpful, efficient and knowledgeable.
Our room ( facing onto the broad leafy street), was well equipped and every convenience. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath in it. There was coffee/ tea making facilities, and a small table and chairs in the room. My only reservation is that whilst well equipped, the room was small, cramped and in need of some renovation.
I would return, but only if a larger room were available.",4,2017,03,18
222,Sauna & Jacuzzi in my bedroom!!,"We arrived late one evening and were met by a wonderful Receptionist who could not do enough to help us; she was an absolute credit to this establishment!
We were lucky enough to be staying in the new wing  to the rear of the hotel - fabulous rooms, so very, very comfortable. In fact as my title indicates my room offered a bathroom containing walk in shower, jacuzzi bath and sauna! Sadly I was only staying one night and hardly made the most of the facilities.
However, this is not the end of the 'extras' the main bedroom sported wonderful wifi arrangements, x box, DVD player and complementary DVD's and even a Nespresso Coffee Maker with a selection of pods - wow! Everywhere was beautifully decorated and enhanced by a secure car park for guests.
Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice, promptly served, Frankly I could not have asked for more and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a stay in Dublin, but not too close to the City Centre but with a choice of restaurants nearby. Well done Roxford Lodge..",5,2017,03,16
222,Lovely Hotel.  Friendly and Helpful Staff,"Staff were friendly and helpful.  Full Irish Breakfast was delicious. Double room was spacious,in excellent condition, very clean and comfortable. Jacuzzi bath and shower in ensuite. Bed very comfortable and location quiet.
Location excellent, bus outside door to town centre, which is not far away or in opposite direction to Dun Laoighaire, where there is a lovely harbour and sea front. The nearest Dart train station Landsdowne Road, ( beside the Aviva Rugby and Soccer Stadium) is 850 killometres away. From there destinations  include Dun Laoighaire and in the opposite direction the lovely harbour and fishing village of Howth.",5,2017,03,16
222,Our place was over the top gorgeous!,"Desmonds B&B adjacent to and owned by the Roxford Lodge Hotel. Our place was over the top gorgeous! The rooms were even nicer than the pictures on the website depicted. The kitchen had all modern appliances and came lightly stocked with bread, milk, juice, cereal and tea & coffee. We did not have to make  run to Tesco immediately because the basics were provided - this allowed our group of weary travelers to rest for the day. The beds were the most comfortable we have slept in on our trip and the bathrooms and bedrooms were wonderful and spacious! The patio in back was nice to sit and have tea and the parking was very nice as your vehicle is in an enclosed space overnight and protected from the street parking. The location was also fantastic as it was just a short walk into the city center and we did not have to drive there and park. On our day of departure my friends and family went downtown and I parked at the B&B and blogged about our trip and the maids came and cleaned while I was there and they were very meticulous about cleaning the rooms. I know why the place was so clean when we arrived. We hope to be able to return to Dublin someday and we definitely would love to stay @ Roxford Lodge Hotel/Desmond's B&B in Dublin",5,2017,03,10
222,Wonderful guest services,"We had a problem during our stay and the staff could not have been more helpful, kind, and accommodating. They assisted with problem-solving and also helped us implement the solution. The location is good and the setting attractive. Highly recommend!",5,2017,03,08
222,My 40th,Enjoyed my stay here for my 40th with Family great Hotel lovely Breakfast friendly staff close to walk to access to Hop on Hop Off Bus which takes you in to the City Centre.Ill be staying here again next year.,5,2017,03,07
222,Travel with a toddler,"I had a pleasant stay at the Roxford. I stayed on the 1st floor which was nice bc I had my two yr old child with me. Hotel featured a lift which made it easy to access my room. ( lift is located in the back). Hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Restaurants are close by, I recommend the Rolly cafe.( best egg white omelette ever!). Hotel also features a rain shower, jacuzzi tub, mini fridge, hair dryer, tv with DVD player - DVD included and a dry sauna which I enjoyed! I would book at this hotel again. ",5,2017,03,07
222,They have thought of everything,"I chose a single room (107) as I was travelling alone. It was immaculately clean and very well cared for and had a spa bath.
They supply all the usual tea and coffee but also a Nespresso machine with pods which was great.
There is a good sized secure car park.
Lots of local shops, bars and restaurants a short walk away. The Rugby stadium is also very close.
Sadly I only had time for a continental breakfast but everything was so immaculate (and homemade bread) I would imagine the cooked would be fantastic.

I will definitely return when next in the area.",5,2017,03,07
222,Very friendly hotel,"Just come back from an overnight stay in Dublin, having had a very pleasant stay at the Roxford Lodge. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, the room and facilities were very excellent and the location is good, around a 10 minute walk to Merrion Square.
The link to the airport, via Aircoach, is quick and easy so I would recommend. ",5,2017,03,06
222,Rugby weekend,"Great location (5 mins from aviva stadium). Hotel was quirky, our room was small but equipped with everything you could need/want from jacuzzi bath, to nespresso coffee machine.  Comfortable bed with fresh bedding and towels and spotlessly clean.  Staff were friendly and helpful and the complimentary parking is a big bonus in Dublin.  I will definitely be back to the Roxford as it offers excellent value for money.",4,2017,03,05
222,One night in dublin,"Hotel was beautiful and staff was very friendly. Safe place to park the car. An in room sauna was certainly a surprise, but the room was cozy, clean and comfortable. Good coffee and great pillows. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,03,03
222,Perfect reception,"People of reception were very kind, they really helped us so as to organize our stay : bus, plane, visits ...
The room was very clean and well decorated
The only things they can improve is the choice for the breakfast",4,2017,02,26
222,A short break in Dublin ,"Have just had a very enjoyable two day trip to Dublin to meet up with a family member. Stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel Balls bridge. What a gem !. Very friendly and helpful staff. Our two single rooms were small but clean and contained everything you would ever need ,for a comfortable stay, and more. Breakfast excellent. Secure parking. Overall price very reasonable  ( for Dublin ). Would highly recommend. From satisfied customer Anne.",5,2017,02,25
222,Just fab,"I was impressed, I would absolutely recommend the Roxford lodge to anyone going to Dublin! Really spacious room even with the sauna in the corner, jacuzzi bathtub, Nespresso + capsules in the room, large TV and DVD player. Everyone was nice helpful, and everything was spotless. It's in a quiet neighbourhood (where all the Embassies are apparently) but a short walk to the centre or a shorter bus ride. ",5,2017,02,22
222,superb experience,"Great location for my business meeting in Grand Canal Hotel ( 5 minutes walk)
parking provided with direct assess to hotel from car park

Great breakfast. Well appointed rooms. Very friendly staff. ",5,2017,02,19
222,Fabulous place,"We stayed on a Saturday night. A short taxi ride from the ferry terminal. The receptionist was very helpful & even took our bag when showing us to our room. They could not have done enough for us. They gave us directions to a local resturant & let us use their umbrella as it was raining! In the morning breakfast was cooked to order and perfect. In fact we didnt have lunch that day! Comfy beds, tastefully decorated & a jacuzzi bath too! Would love to return one day.",5,2017,02,19
222,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Have stayed here previously. Hence,return visit. This hotel has oodles of charm and character.  Rooms are spotless and well designed.  There is a tremendous warmth and homeliness here.  The staff are very courteous and friendly.  Great location and free parking, if reserved. Ideal base for attending any venue in Dublin!  We will be back again soon!",5,2017,02,18
222,Lovely stay,"The hotel is comfortable, clean, quiet and has friendly staff. The Irish breakfast was cooked well and really filled you up for a busy day of sightseeing. The hotel is a 30 minute walk into the town centre which was ideal. You can also get the aircoach 2 minutes from the hotel.",4,2017,02,17
222,Valentines break,"Beautiful traditional hotel with everything you could ask for! Great location both from Dublin airport & bus stops right outside into city centre. Lovely, friendly, helpful staff & great disabled access - I was easily given an accessible room with no problems. Great breakfasts & all the little extra touches that make somewhere so special!",5,2017,02,15
222,Best hotel stay I could have asked for,"This hotel is lovely, not too far from city centre, walking distance of about 25 mins. We arrived earlier than our check in time but our room was ready. We had a beautiful. clean room, with a spacious bathroom. We then checked into the house the next day, which was huge, tidy and complete with all the facilities and some food too! Staff were very friendly, helpful and laid back when it came to check out time. A beautiful home, want to come back and stay again - could not recommend more highly enough!! Go there now!",5,2017,02,14
222,Excellent spot and Coeliac friendly!,"A great spot, excellent value for the city. Super comfortable rooms and beds. Prior to arrival we requested a coeliac option breakfast which the chef sourced for us and it was excellent. Definitely return!",5,2017,02,12

There is some really nice places close by to eat/drink...breakfast was lovely. The room was so clean and comfortable we really enjoyed our stay here.",5,2017,02,10
222,Lovely!,"I was only there for one night but had better treatment here than any 5 star hotel I've stayed in! I arrived quite late and didn't feel like a full dinner, so the lovely receptionist brought me tea, toast, and snacks. The room was really cosy and comfortable. I had no idea about the sauna and jacuzzi before I got there! The full Irish breakfast was delicious and the kitchen staff were really attentive. Can't recommend this place enough :)",5,2017,02,09
222,Cranmer House a home away from home,"The service was second to none. We arrived late and the staff were still on hand to show us to the apartment. He showed us in, gave us 4 sets of keys, explained how to use the TV and made sure we all had the wifi code before he left. He explained where the shops were and showed us around the house. The kitchen was filled with everything you could need to stay overnight. Cereal, bread, butter, juice, milk, coffee, teabags. There was a washing machine, dishwasher and tablets to use both. We had loads of space! Nearly hating to come home. Would definitely stay here again. It was amazing.",5,2017,02,08
222,Dublin weekend,"Every single thing about this place is exceptional - just what customer service truly should be like. From booking to organising the taxi to leave this was a perfect place to stay, walkable distance into the City Centre, near a 'hop on hop off' bus stop, rooms are immaculate, the lounge with its open fire is spectacular and the full Irish breakfast unmissable. 

Real value for money. ",5,2017,02,05
222,Weekend in Dublin,"We chose to stay in the Rockford lodge hotel due to their very competitive room rate and very good location. We were not disappointed. The staff were very accommodating and friendly, our room suited our needs perfectly and the hotel provided a car park which was very convenient. The hotel is a 25 min stroll from Grafton street and is in a very nice neighbourhood. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,02,05
222,Outstanding Accommodation and Service,"We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment adjacent to the hotel.  The apartment was clean and spacious, and we were provided generous provisions for breakfast and snacks.  We had the full breakfast each morning, and the food and service was excellent.",5,2017,02,01
222,Nice hotel within good walking distance of central Dublin,"We were really looking forward to the sauna and the jacuzzi in our room but when we checked in, our friend's room, a single, had the jacuzzi but our room was quite small and had neither. We actually had difficulty in fitting our suitcases in the room since we had a tiny closet.
That being said, the front staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful with good suggestions for touring and eating. The breakfast downstairs was nice with buffet choices as well as eggs cooked to order.
It was great to stay in a small, quirky hotel with a history but it's important to note that the room sizes (and the included perks) differ greatly.",4,2017,01,31
222,Cancelled,"Never got to stay. Was supposed to be staying weekend of the 24th Feb in the executive suite (Birthday present for my other half for a concert and the 6 nations game). Booked months in advance knowing it would be really busy that weekend - today, 3 weeks before by booking, they called cancelling my reservation saying that they were having renovation works that had overrun only on the room I'd booked and that they had no other rooms available. Found a basic room at a hotel further away from where we needed to be and was trying to get my credit card details to confirm the booking without me even looking up the other hotel. Very pushy for me to accept and just kept telling me it wasn't her fault. The works were supposed to be completed on the 15th Jan (according to them) but they didn't call me until the 30th ... I don't know whose fault they thought it was but it certainly wasn't mine and they were borderline rude to me about it.",1,2017,01,30
222,Working in Dublin,"Room had a Sauna and a jaquzzi, flat screen TV DVD player and an iPhone radio dock, Free WiFi with reasonable download bandwidth, breakfast was perfect, parking a bit tight but secure. staff very friendly. Only issue is there is no bar nor evening meals.",5,2017,01,30
222,Great accommodation fab rooms ,"Fabulous rooms. There was a sauna, jacuzzi bath, dvd player and nespresso machine in the room. Breakfast was just lovely. Nice staff. Hotel just beside the Aviva Stadium. There is also secure car parking at the back of hotel",5,2017,01,29
222,Wish I could give it six stars!,"We stay in Dublin every week for work.  This is by far the best place we have stayed in.  The welcome on arrival, the comfortable and homely (in the best possible way) room and facilities - nespresso machine, free wifi, Jacuzzi bath - even DVD player in the room with a selecion of current and classic DVD's.  Breakfast with so much choice - omelettes to die for, range of teas, homemade brown bread and served by a lovely welcoming lady. Location so handy, within walking distance of the centre of city, RDS, Aviva Stadium, Grand Canal Docks.  Parking on site.  Lots of nice restaurants and pubs near by. Really can't fault it.  Made our stay for work feel like a little holiday. A true home from home.",5,2017,01,26
222,A tiny hidden gem ,"Secure car park, great service from the staff, showed me to my room. Amazing jacuzzi bath in the room and a Nespresso machine! Quiet and fantastic location especially for RDS or Aviva events! Very good price for service provided ",5,2017,01,25
222,Great service!,"The staff was extremely nice and attentive to all of our needs. They also helped us in getting a discounted rate with the taxi. Shopping centers aren't to far, roughly 25 minute walk and the area is decent.",4,2017,01,24
222,Ideal!,"Lovely cosy boutique hotel. Mini sauna in the bedroom was novel! Good extra touches like an expresso machine in the room. Very clean. Really friendly staff, especially the lady who served the tasty Irish breakfast. Nice area, 15 min walk to centre but plenty of good restaurants and bars nearby. Hope to return soon. ",5,2017,01,23
222,super service in nice hotel,Visited here on quick trip to Dublin and as this was our third time here we found hotel to be still offering great service and great comfort. Rooms are well appointed and have everything travellers require also secure parking if offered which is great. Breakfast is cooked to order and is very tasty.  Drinks  are available to order and can be had in very cosy sitting room. Owners are very friendly and helpful and make a great change from the big hotels.,5,2017,01,22
222,concert in dublin,"very positive. great service. room very nice. very easy to move in city centre.very nice irish breakfast.

room has a jacuzzi bath and steam room within. Beds very comfortable. Nice TV and coffee machine. Great location

couldn't fault the stay",5,2017,01,19
222,Visit to Dublin,"Everyone was wonderful and our rooms were very pleasant. The location is ideal to walk into town and close to Baggot Street.
The kitchen was well equipped and I liked the coffee machine so much I will be buying one!",5,2017,01,17
222,Great hotel in a great part of town,"My partner and I both loved our stay here, the staff are very pleasant and helpful, the room was lovely (we had a sauna!), breakfast was very tasty. It's only a 10 minute or so stroll to Merrion Square, which takes you towards the centre of the city. I'll definitely stay here again ",5,2017,01,09
222,Nice place to stay,"Nice place to stay good location, less expensive than big chain hotels which seem to be very expensive in Dublin for some reason even on a regular weekend of the year. Walking distance to centre of town and also the Aviva Stadium.",4,2017,01,08
222,Nice place to stay,"This was a nice place to stay overnight in transit from Dublin to Manchester. The hotel is small and quaint. The staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful - from the pot of freshly brewed coffee on arrival, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is within walking distance of the city centre and there are several pubs and restaurants nearby. Overall, a great place to stay in Dublin.",4,2017,01,06
222,"Lovely hotel, great location and excellent staff","Interesting little hotel near the Aviva and about 15 min walk to the Bord Gais Theatre and 20 mins walk to Stephen's Green. Theres a bus stop at the front heading to the RDS and across the road going to the city centre. There is secure parking on site at the rear of the building down a narrow lane beside Ryan's Beggars Bush Pub. We parked on a side street (after 7pm - 7am free on street) but on checkin we were told the code to the gate at the rear and then moved the car. I believe there is a phone at the back to the reception so if staying again I'd attempt to go to the carpark first and call reception for the code then check in.

Room was excellent - not massive but what you would expect in such a city location. A sauna and a jacuzzi bath in ours! A great selection of DVDs and a nespresso coffee machine and kettle also in the room. 

Breakfast was included and was very good selection with Full Irish, french toast, omeletes and cereals etc. 

Wifi hub in the room also with wired ports if needed and internet connection was excellent. Hotel is very clean and there is a lounge room beside the reception also. There is no bar but you can get a drink in the lounge room or sent to your room. 

It's a quirky hotel that is contained in one of the typical Georgian style houses on Northumberland Rd with some nice little touches and is making the best of the shape of the building and it is not your typical bland chain hotel. An odd tight corridor or low roof but that adds to the charm. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,01,06
222,Fantastic house. ,"A great house, exceeding our expectations.  It is well layed out, spacious and luxurious.  The added extras like coffee, milk and bread really added a wonderful touch. Everything was considered to help us have a pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend this house as a great venue for a large family or group.  ",5,2017,01,05
222,My preferred place to stay in Dublin.,"I have had the pleasure of staying in this hotel twice last year for two 3 night stints.  I came back to Dublin and stayed somewhere else, and really don't know why I did not just stay here.  It must be somewhere between a hotel and a guest house.  

The room makes it feel like a good quality hotel - I now always wonder where the jacuzzi bath is in other hotels(!), and on my first stay in particular I enjoyed my room as much as I enjoyed my room at the Intercontinental.  Comfortable bed, spacious room, fast wi-fi.  

Where the hotel could do with improving is that some of the fixtures seemed a little broken - the TV and the shower head was broken, for example.  But these are small problems when generally the hotel is great. 

The breakfast is lovely - very homemade quality to it and the staff are very friendly in the morning.  The reception staff are also always very friendly - quick check in, TOD (tea on demand!) and always happy to accommodate - this is certainly what makes it a really good guest house.

The location is really great too, both for Ballsbridge and the city itself.  It is close or within reasonable distance to some awesome restaurants and cafes - The Old Spot, Juniors, Juniors does pizza, Maya, Roly's, Zakura Izakaya, Kerala Kitchen, or French Paradox.  The hotel does not do dinner, but that is no problem given its neat location. 

I will no doubt be back again soon, and it really is my preferred place to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,01,05
222,Nice place to be in Dublin,Nice family run hotel in a quiet surrounding in Ballsbridge. Kind and very helpful service. Comfortable rooms. Enjoyed delicious Continental breakfast. Good bus connetions to City Centre. Using Leap card recomended.,4,2017,01,02
222,"nice, but oddly-laid-out, hotel","Nice hotel.   A pretty long walk to where the action is, although there was a nice restaurant/bar nearby called the Schoolhouse.  The hotel and rooms were kind of oddly laid out.   It was hard to get our heavy luggage to our room, as there seem to be a lot of half levels.   Even in our room, we had to go up 5 or 6 steps to get to our bathroom.   The room was fairly small, but there was a small sauna in our room which was odd.    We used it as a closet.  But the staff was very friendly and the breakfasts were good.",4,2016,12,31
222,Beautiful little hotel - loved every moment!,"This is a fantastic little hotel in a quiet area of Dublin city. A 10-15 minute walk from the city centre, or about 5 minutes by bus - even handier considering there's a bus stop right outside the hotel's front door.

I was greeted and shown upstairs by a very pleasant member of staff. I had a single room which was a little on the small side, but I came on holiday to explore a new country, not sit in a room all day. Despite it being fairly compact, it still managed to feel quite open and it never felt cramped or uncomfortable. The room was nicely decorated.  

My room had a little electric sauna and a jacuzzi bathtub which I wasn't expecting. The bathroom was clean with a toilet, sink, a big wall mirror and a smaller mirror on an adjustable wall-mount that had a 3x magnification setting which came in handy for me putting my contact lenses in. The bath itself has a mixer tap with a shower head attached, and there was also a proper power shower if you'd rather have a proper shower than a bath. The tub itself has a jacuzzi function which I made use of every night. Very relaxing!

The bed was comfortable and came with plenty of pillows. There was what looked to be a spare fleece blanket in the closet but I never used it. The room also contains a writing desk, comfortable chair, a couple of drawer units, an iron, ironing board, trouser press, hair dryer and tea and coffee making facilities, with tea, coffee, decaff and sugar provided on arrival.

The breakfast is fantastic. Fresh tea, coffee, water and juice, fruit, cereal, yogurts, cheese, perhaps more but I don't remember everything. They have a few options for a hot breakfast as well, including an absolutely delicious Irish cooked breakfast with all the fresh toasted white or brown soda bread you could want. The full breakfast contained sausage, bacon, black pudding, white pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, tomato and an egg cooked to your liking.  

The hotel provides room service and there is a phone in your room you can use to call reception to request this. Also when coming back from exploring the city one night the man on reception offered me a tea or coffee, and asked if I wanted it in the lounge or in my room. I asked to have tea brought to my room, expecting just a cup of tea. Instead what I got was a silver tray holding a pot of tea, fresh milk, a slice of cake and some biscuits. And this didn't even cost anything extra!

All in all this is an absolutely fantastic hotel. For the location and the price I could not have asked for anything better. Roxford Lodge offers a convenient location, comfortable surroundings and a whole load of that famous Irish hospitality. I will absolutely be staying here again next time I find myself in Dublin.",5,2016,12,31
222,Super,"We love this type of accomodation. Everything was perfect. The breakfast was excellent, delicious, very well served. Friendly staff and very polite.
We left we the feeling of coming back pretty soon.
We don't want to look for another place to stay when visiting our family in Dublin.
Merry Xmas.",5,2016,12,20
222,"Great breakfast, comfortable night's sleep and nice and quiet","We stayed here for 2 nights and thought it was excellent.  
The cooked breakfasts are just amazing - the toasted brown soda bread is exquisite and I've never had such perfectly cooked poached eggs.
The room was comfortable, clean and well equipped.  Great to have a lovely strong wifi signal throughout.
The staff were always friendly and helpful.  
Highly recommended and good value for money.",5,2016,12,16
222,amazing customer service,"Due to my flight I arrived in the middle of the night, so I was really glad about my fast check-in at this late hour. Hotel room was small but very comfortable - room service was very good, too. Staff was lovely and helped me greatly with my questions about town, how to get where etc. Very polite and friendly. 
A bus stop for the buses No. 4, 7, 7A is located right in front of the hotel. Additionally, some shops are located in the parallel street/s.",5,2016,12,15
222,Better than it's 3 stars. ,"Very well located and fitted out little place.  Near the city centre, restaurants and with local shops close by for a top up as needed.  Rooms clean and quiet with a good breakfast.  30 mins from airport perfect base for a weekend in the capital. 
",4,2016,12,15
222,Nice cosy and comfortable,Room wasn't one in photograph. That was worth the price. Room I got was worth half that. Also room wasn't ready at check in time of two after us waiting g hours to make sure we didn't get their too early. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Place is in lovely location. The room we got may not of been the one I booked (so feels like I paid double what I should of) however was lovely cosy and warm. Lovely guest house type of accommodation. ,3,2016,12,14
222,So much more for your money,"This hotel is a great find.  It is so lovely to stay somewhere that still has a bit of individuality compared to the blandness of the chain hotels.  It is in a lovely old building but the rooms have been decorated with every convenience you could want - including our room had a sauna and jacuzzi bath!!! There was also a DVD player and a selection of DVDs. 
The bed was beautifully made up and very comfortable.
It is in a great location too.  We couldn't get a taxi after a night out in Temple Bar and easily walked back.
Excellent Full Irish Breakfast.
Really good value for money - you get so many extra little touches that you won't get in a chain hotel.",5,2016,12,12
222,Weekend in Dublin,"Very cosy, clean and quiet. Comfortable beds. We had a sauna in our room. Very friendly staff! Free Nespresso Coffee and tea in your room. Good location: a bus stop just in front of the door, otherwise 20 minutes walk to the centre. Freshly prepared very good breakfast. I wouldn't recommend this hotel though for lonely travelers because it's small and you don't get to meet people there. It's perfect for families, couples or a group of friends!",5,2016,12,11
222,Perfect location,"Stayed at this location because of it's closeness to our daughter's apartment. The staff here was wonderful, very kind and helpful. The lady serving breakfast was so gracious and always ready to help. We used the beautiful lounge with the cozy fire and Christmas tree to open some early Christmas gifts with our daughter. There were also some kitty cats that they feed that live in back of the hotel that were very cute and friendly and we could pet, which was nice because we missed our kitty. Would stay here again and recommend to anyone",4,2016,12,11
222,A lovely warm retreat,"An excellent small private hotel situated in a great area for getting around with very easy access to bus routes. Our room had every facility we needed including a sauna and jacuzzi style bath. The front of house staff were extremely helpful and would supply tea and coffee free of charge the very charming lounge in front of an open fire. The breakfast was beautifully cooked and served by a lovely lady, nothing was too much bother to her. When passing through Dublin again we would return here.",5,2016,12,10
222,Awesome,"The house and the rooms that we booked were excellent, facilities brilliant and in a lovely area.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Within walking distance of central attractions but good public transport links too, although we didn't use this as there were so many of us taxis were more convenient and cheaper.  A fabulous place to stay and we hope to return.",5,2016,12,06
222,Cosy winter lodgings,"The desk clerks were exceptionally helpful, friendly and welcoming. The room was clean with plenty of clean towels and a heated towel rack in the bathroom , which was especially appreciated in December. Tea and a tea kettle were provided in the room. The location was ideal for exploring Dublin and events at Aviva and the RDS. My lower level room was very quiet with no noise from the street. The reception room was warm and cosy with an open fireplace.",4,2016,12,05
222,Overnight stay,Have to say I will be back room was lovely and cosy .. very close to aviva stadium very ejoyable stay all.. round if u don't mind walking it's about 30mins walk into Dublin city but not idea for someone looking to shop .,5,2016,11,29
222,Quirky and Delightful,"We absolutely loved this little hotel. It's quirky with jacuzzi tubs and individual saunas in the room. The continental breakfast was good and the service was really great. The front desk was able to help with getting a cab when we had to make an emergency dental visit across town. The only negative is that while it's well within walking distance, it's slightly set apart from the city center. ",4,2016,11,29
222,"Cosy, comfortable and so so welcoming😀","We had a really lovely 3 night stay in Roxford Lodge hotel this weekend. A beautiful old Georgian house with lots of old world charm while still having all mod cons. Central location, bus stop directly outside the front door, wonderful staff (especially the lovely lady serving breakfast each morning), clean modern bedroom, and a wonderfully tasty fresh breakfast every morning. Highly recommend this small hotel.",5,2016,11,27
222,"Comfortable, helpful and a great value","A week at this Georgian lodge featured comfortable rooms, excellent breakfasts, friendly and helpful staff – especially when I left a phone in a cab and they helped get it back for me. About a mile from St. Stephen's Green on a straight shot.",5,2016,11,26
222,Short business stay,Great hotel for my overnight stay. Beautiful room with sauna and jacuzzi. Can't fault it. Receptionist was very helpful and location was excellent - snuck out for a few nice pints in the beggars bush. ,5,2016,11,25
222,"Fantastic non chain hotel, very close to city centre","Hidden gem of a place to stay in Dublin. Secure parking out back with a coded gate entry.

The rooms are spacious, with the deluxe rooms having a small sauna.

Very homely and friendly, with staff going out of their way to accommodate requests. Breakfast in the morning is well portioned and very nice

Small extras that are great to have which you wouldn't get in a larger, chain hotel venue (free tea and coffee to your room throughout the day, unlimited internet and printing access, free in room wifi)

Great location for doing anything in Dublin city centre (taxi approx 10euro)",5,2016,11,24
222,Friendly cute and clean ,Lovely little hotel with friendly staff ...hotel is clean....bathroom a little small but very clean .... only downfall and the reason I did not give 5 stars is because when we went to leave in the morning we discovered 3 cats that obviously belong to the property/owners were walking all over our car and luckily there were no scratches but left it covered in their footprints ....not really impressed with that at all .... dont really think it looks good having a few cats walking about ,5,2016,11,22
222,Great Value in a Great Location,"This is the perfect hotel if you are looking for a reasonably priced room in a great location in Dublin and don't mind having a small room.  The single rooms are very small, but you get what you pay for ... and more.  Despite the small size of the room, it had a wonderful sauna in the room, which I didn't have time to use.  The room was nicely furnished with extra cushions on the bed and an example of the attention to detail in this hotel is the umbrella provide din the wardrobe for use in rainy weather. 

The best fruit salad I've seen at breakfast, although a good quality muesli would really enhance the breakfast",4,2016,11,21
222,Great value and location!,"The hotel is in a great location and about a 20 minute walk from O3 venue. The facilities are great, with a Sauna, jacuzzi, tv and DVD player, safe, kettle and coffeemaker machine all in the room. Staff are all so friendly and we were able to leave our car in the lockup yard for a few hours, even after we checked out in the morning. Great!",5,2016,11,20
222,Lovely Hotel.....will definitely be back!,"Stayed here with my sister for a shopping trip to Dublin. Secure safe car park at the back is great and was able to get the bus right out the door.  Staff were very helpful and friendly. Rooms are not spacious but are 5*, everything you would want, modern, clean, a sauna(not in budget rooms) jacuzzi bath, fridge, Nespresso machine are all a lovely touch. We stayed in R136 in a separate building which has 2 rooms, which was very quiet, at the back of the premises. Breakfast is not included which wasn't made very clear at time of booking but was very good. Looking forward to staying here again.",5,2016,11,20
222,Lovely hotel ,"Excellent location, very handy for the Aviva stadium. lovely room, good size and we also had a  sauna in our room. Easy access to on site parking. We will definitely stay here again. 

Staff were all very helpful and polite",5,2016,11,20
222,Quirky  hotel,"Stayed here with my wife last night and it's a quirky little hotel with great use of space. Has all you need and more.  In our room was a mini sauna a jacuzzi and a new press on machine. Access to a little courtyard. Comfy bed. Small room full of stuff but was not cluttered. TV and good selection of DVD,so.   Staff extremely helpfully and friendly.  No bar on restaurant but there is a wine and beer menu and complimentary tea and biscuits or you can grab a symbol from the local shop if in a hurry  and eat in  And you pay for room only so if you choose to have breakfast you pay for that after  breakfast. Which was excellent  .. no complaints...could not fault this place on any level.. the only thing that they could change or add is . The ipod docking station  is the old ipod connection   and more so with blue tooth on most music/phones devices now. If the radio  of the sauna and in the room had blue tooth connection capabilities would really enhance  any body's stay being able  to listen to their own music( spotify/ play/ itunes/ in the room or sauna.. while getting ready or just relaxing  enjoying  a unique  gem close to the center of dublin",5,2016,11,19
222,Brillant. I'll be back. ,"I stayed here to attend a conference in the Aviva. The location is perfect for the stadium. 10 minute walk. 

The staff were brillant. Really friendly, polite and helpful. 
The lady in the dining room in the morning was a real pleasure to meet. 

The rooms were ideal. Not overly large but all you would ever want. 
The Nespresso machine is a lovely touch and was greatly appreciated 

There was a sauna in my room. Random but welcomed. The bath had jacuzzi jets. Nice touch again. 

I also appreciate the room on the ground level, avoiding hawking bags up stairs. 

I would definitely return. Thanks a million keep up the good work.

222,Excellent value in an excellent location.,"My husband and I stayed at Roxford Lodge Hotel on two occasions recently, both times in a classic deluxe double. While the rooms are not extremely spacious, they are well-appointed and well-maintained, and even when we had a room at the front, it was nice and quiet. 
All the staff were pleasant and helpful, the breakfast room is very agreeable, and the continental breakfasts we had were excellent. 
The location is really great. It's in the embassy neighbourhood, with tree-lined streets, and the hotel is very close to bus stops for the 702 Aircoach bus to the airport as well as local buses for going to the centre of Dublin if one chooses not to take the relatively short walk. 
All in all, a nice stay and very good value.
... and don't forget that you can have a nice pot of tea and biscuits in the guest lounge or in your room any time you like - it was a welcome treat when we arrived.",5,2016,11,16
222,Cute room and very kind staff,"15 mn away from city center (walking), in a very calm neighborhood.
Our room was so pretty and comfy, and the staff was very nice to us: brought us some tea in our room, helped us catch the bus to the airport...
I warmly recommend it !",5,2016,11,16
222,Small and clean Boutique Hotel,The Roxford Lodge is about a 20 or so minute walk from Dublin city center.  There is an easy bus in front of the hotel.  Our room was full of accouterments including a small sauna which made the room quite small.  We don't know if all rooms had one but we would have preferred to have the extra space as it made the quarters quite tight.  The room was clean and we enjoyed the in room coffee service.,4,2016,11,14
222,"Beautiful place, with excellent staff. Best in Dublin!","I travel extensively for work, and stay in hotels all over Europe. I've been staying at the Roxford Lodge for almost 10 years now, and I always come away after a great nights sleep, well fed and feeling special.
Fresh tea and coffee s always available, the rooms are comfortable, yet classy stylish, the beds great, and the breakfast.....
A 10 minute easy walk has you in the tourist center of Dublin, surrounded by great restaurants, bars and night life.
And then of course there are the staff. Helpful, kind always willing to offer a suggestion, and nothing is ever too much! 
No matter what room you stay in (I think I've had most by now), or for how long you wont be disappointed!
I just hope they'll still have room for me next time I'm there! Oh and try the Jacuzzi's....",5,2016,11,14
222,I almost raved about this hotel until the last morning.....,"I was happy with almost everything. Location was great. Staff were really nice. I was asked when I checked in if i would like tea or coffee down to my room which i thought was a nice touch. Breakfast was nice and there was a lot of choice. 
However,On the day I checked out day things took a turn. I hope this situation was a one off. But after i went back to bed after my breakfast i was woken up TWICE by housekeeping who actually came into the room to clean it. It was really annoying because i was looking forward to a lie in  and a little disconcerting that they would just come in. But i would stay again because i think some wires were crossed.",3,2016,11,13
222,"Welcoming, friendly place","We stayed at Roxford Lodge for 1 night and from the moment we stepped through the front door, they couldn't do enough for us. So friendly and welcoming. The room was very comfortable and clean and we enjoyed the sauna. The bed was very comfy too and we both had a good nights sleep. We did hear people moving around in the room above us as the floorboards were creaky but it didn't disturb us too much. Breakfast was plentyful with  great range of foods. 
There was a bus stop directly outside for us to get into the city centre which was less that 10 minues away, but the gentleman on reception was more than happy to arrange a taxi for us which arrived immediately. 
We would definetly recomend and stay here again if we visit Dublin again.",5,2016,11,13
222,Very friendly,"I have been at the hotel before and it was great again. The staff are very friendly, the room is clean and the neighbourhood is quite. Yet it is close to the stadium which is very helpfull. They do a great breakfastwith fresh fruitsalad as well. In the room there is a nespresso coffeemachine and you'll find some dvd's would you wish. I had a great stay, again, and will definitely come back",5,2016,11,13
222,Lovely find in Dublin,"What a lovely find in Ballsbridge, so handy for Dublin. The welcome was warm and friendly and although we arrived at 12, there was a room available and we were shown there immediately. The room was clean spacious and airy. Even the wifi was excellent an essential for us. The luxury of the sauna in the room was so unique. 
We were offered lovely coffee and biscuits in front of an open fire. Perfect 
The room was quiet but as we had lovely patio windows, some sort of blind or netting for a bit of privacy would have been good
Breakfast was served in the basement but was another lovely room. There was a good selection of cereals, yoghurts, juices, etc. The hot items were cooked fresh to order and was delicious. 
Roxford Lodge Hotel is a lovely little gem and we cant wait to return",4,2016,11,12
222,Great Cozy Location,I would definitely stay at the Roxford again.  Great Cozy home feeling.  Loved the espresso maker and hot water tea pot in the room as well as the separate drinking water faucet in the sink.  Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful.  I liked the location just out of the Dublin city center which was easily accessible by bus.  Bus stop was located at the entrance to the lodge.  Dublin was torn up with construction to join the north and south tram lines which also affected the hotel location but that was not their fault so it did not change my opinion of their facility or location.,5,2016,11,12
222,"Great Experience, lovely place","We had an exceptional stay at the Roxford Lodge.  The estate and rooms were well appointed, large, and clean.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Easy access to Dingle Peninsula.  We stayed two nights in Nov. and would definitely stay again.",5,2016,11,11
222,Beautiful home in beautiful area.,"This was one of the most wonderful accommodations I have ever used.  Everything in the house was high end.  Gorgeous kitchen, appliances and baths.  The shower was the best ever.  I never wanted to step out.  Very convenient to transportation and great restaurants.  I just wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2016,11,06
222,Short stay..,"A one day business trip with a night out added on.. lovely family run hotel, fresh tea and coffee(free) on request in room, and without being asked the owner sent out for some gluten free biscuits after he realised I was Coeliac.
In room sauna was great for some weary muscles after a few hard training sessions during the week..",5,2016,11,05
222,Great rooms in a very good location,"This is very good hotel in a converted large house in a good part of Dublin close to all attractions. There is a bus at the door to the city centre. Accommodation in Dublin is slightly more expensive but the Roxford Lodge is mid range. The facilities are very good. Each room has a sauna would you believe (!) and there are lots of power points and neat lighting available. Beds are good. The whole place is very clean, with friendly staff. Breakfast is an extra cost but is very good indeed and will set you up for the day. Would be happy to return.",5,2016,11,05
222,"Nice hotel, decent area","This is a bakery nice hotel in the ballsbridge area of Dublin, this is a very nice suburb of the city. The hotel itself is a 10/15minute walk to Grafton Street, which is a nice walk on a pleasant day. There are bus stops outside the hotel if required.
We had room 105, which was a triple (upgraded on arrival) the room was very nice, on the bottom but had access to a garden (shared with two other rooms).  
The staff in the hotel were all extremely helpful and friendly.
We found that the cost of alcohol was actually cheaper than in the city (although you are paying for bottles and not pints) the hotel doesn't have a bar as such just a lounge where your drinks will be brought to you (or you can have them in your room) it did appear however that the prices shown are exclusive of 23% VAT so be prepared to pay a little more than the price list!
One warning I would have is to be careful of the hot water, it is dangerously hot, getting in the shower and whacking it up to full will leave you burnt, let the shower(or tap) run first so you know how hot it is.
Overall I felt the hotel was good value for money and would return if I was to ever go back to Dublin (which I wouldn't - Dublin is unfortunately excessively expensive be prepared to spend a LOT of money if you stay for a few days)",5,2016,11,04
222,What a gem!,"We stayed for three nights at the start of our Ireland adventure and found all the staff here extremely welcoming and super helpful.  They had excellent knowledge of the local area and able to give good advice about where to dine, get your laundry done and transport. Our room was great with a comfy bed, small table and chairs plus a desk.  There was even a sauna in the room in the corner. The bathroom was very modern with a goodly supply of hot water.  We liked it so much that we stayed another night at the other end of our trip before leaving Ireland.  There was a small lift which made moving luggage so much easier. We hired a car and could park at the rear of the building in a secure car park.",5,2016,11,02
222,"Nice B&B, but didn't even stay the night!","On arrival was told that we were only allowed a maximum of 2 people for our room, rather than the 3 that we thought we had booked for.. Very disappointing & no refund was given due to it being past the refund date! We had to book an alternative hotel which cost an additional 100 euro, whilst also having paid 100 euro for a room in this hotel that we didn't even stay the night in. Lovely hotel though, with secure parking for the car to stay in. Staff were nice, but still very disappointed having to pay so much money for nothing!",3,2016,11,02
222,very good!,"we arrived early but they allow us  to park and to leave our bags inside the hotel. The room was good, beautifull decorated and even when it wasnt huge the size was not bad for what we saw in our trip to ireland =P
breakfast was good too",4,2016,11,01
222,"Excellent and romantic spot, well located...","Spent three nights with the folks at the Roxford Lodge. It's a small hotel, large B&B, with a great staff of very caring attentive people. The breakfast is very good, the rooms was well appointed and very clean. The automatic lighting system that turned on the light just inside the door wasn't working properly, but we managed without that little nuisance. There is a bus-stop right outside the hotel stoop, which will avail you of the wonders and charms of Dublin on public transportation, which i highly recommend: let the experts do the driving on the left side of the road! The staff at the hotel were great at helping us navigate the bus system, get tickets for the hop-on-hop-off bus (see my review of that operation) and make reservations at local restaurants. Great stay. We'll be back.",5,2016,10,31
222,nice B&b great location,"A great Ballsbridge location with easy walking to Trinity, Merrion Square and restaurants and pubs.  Quiet for being on a relatively busy street in the AM.  Great service from friendly staff.  Room was small, of course, but adequate and everything (water, Wi-Fi) worked great.  Excellent Irish breakfast cheerfully presented.  Only drawback is very steep front steps.",4,2016,10,30
222,Great Place to Stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge the last two nights of our 2 week vacation in Ireland. The room was comfortable, the breakfast was excellent, and employees were helpful and friendly. Being able to park our car in a secure lot and either walk or use public transportation to see Dublin was a big plus.",5,2016,10,29
222,Nice Boutique Hotel in Ballsbridge,"Close to local pubs, grocery, DART and bus lines. Hotel is a nice walk to city centre. Hotel could use some updating as it is showing some wear and tear. Website promises coffee and tea served all day - this was not mentioned to us upon arrival nor did we see coffee and tea in sitting area. Website also references coffee/tea/biscuits upon arrival - we were not provided upon arrival. Maybe this is something you pay extra for or only for certain room types? Amenities could be better explained. Staff was very helpful with taxis, bus service and getting around town. Lights in room were confusing and fan in bathroom was a pain to turn off - had to call front desk to find out how. Rooms are small -two people do not have sufficient space for suitcases. I would stay in the area again, not sure if I would stay at Roxford again.",4,2016,10,28
222,Don't hesitate,"We had a great stay at this hotel which has a lot going for it. Terrific location, well appointed if small rooms, Secure car parking, good wifi, Internet access via a computer in a lovely sitting room, very reasonably priced and Staff were fantastic . Would definitely return.",5,2016,10,28
222,"Great location, lovely neighborhood (Ballsbridge), but a few oddities to beware of...","The location was indeed good.  The airport Coach bus stops a block and a half away and is very inexpensive so it's easy to get to Roxford from the airport.

Now, the oddities:

1.  There is an entry code to the parking area you'll need to get in.  Ask for it if you are arriving when the desk is not manned.

2.  There are motion detectors for the hallway inside the room and the lights go on and off whenever you are too close to the hallway.  This was very annoying and lit up the room in the middle of the night when you went to the bathroom.

3.  The Coach bus back to the airport does not stop opposite the Schoolhouse Hotel (although it does drop you there when coming from the airport).  The stop for the Coach bus to the airport is actually midway between the Roxford and the Schoolhouse, on the side of the road opposite both and near the corner intersection between them on Northumberton Road.

4.  The bathroom fan stays on and is annoying and be careful not to burn yourself in the shower.

5.  The room is a bit small and over-furnished, so you'll find yourself shifting stuff around if there are two people in it.",3,2016,10,27
222,Amazing house at a great location,Booked the hotel for 6 people and got a little house in the back of the hotel. It had a full kitchen and living room and upstairs 3 lovely rooms of wich one was ensuite. The owner was lovely and very helpfull. He had gotten us some basic foods so we didnt have to go to the shop for next days breakfast. The place is only a 15 minute walk out of the centre of the town and there are regular bussen into town just around the corner. All in all an amazing little house,5,2016,10,26
222,one night stay at the Roxford lodge,"The location was ideal within walking distance of city centre without the business. V good selection of restaurants around, again within 5 min walk. I had a single room with all conveniences, Continental breakfast perfect, i loved the porridge with a selection of berries and honey..delicious and a welcoming maitre d!",4,2016,10,25
222,Amazing stay,"This hotel was more than we expected.  We booked the foodie package that included dinner from their website.   Great value for room and a four course dinner.  Food was very good and Stephanie at the front desk went out of her way to help us. Would highly recommend.  Room was a good size, shower was SO hot and welcomed after a long day of touring.  ",5,2016,10,25
222,Excellent family runestablishment,"Excellent small Lodge hotel located in a nice/safe neighbourhood of Dublin within walking distance of Aviva Stadium, the Dublin Convention Centre (about 25 mins) and famous Grafton Street for shopping, pubs, restaurants (also about 25 mins). Hotel is also located on the Aircoach Airport bus route for Ballsbridge/Graystones (use the Schoolhouse Hotel stop which is about 120m from the Lodge.

I was there for a conference so knew I wouldn't' be on premises much, so booked a single room.  The room was cozy, but more than adequate; had a bar fridge, a 32"" flat screen TV with a good assortment of channels and a very comfortable bed.  The bathroom was newly done and spotless and had a jacuzzi tub and rain shower, plus towel warmers which were a real pleasant surprise for a 3 star rated hotel.

Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The only negative I encountered was that the fridge in my room was not working which I reported on day 2 of my 5 day stay and it had not been attended to by time of departure.  Not a deal breaker...just called for more time at the local pubs (Darn!)

I did not partake of the breakfast offerings as i'm just a coffee guy in the morning.....which was also provided in the room and had traditional instant coffee/tea + a kettle and a Nespresso machine!

Great value spot, and more than earns a 3+ rating with me",5,2016,10,22
222,Three Separate Stays - Consistent Service,"We booked 3 separate stays here during our recent 2-week tour of Ireland.  Always received friendly greetings from hotel staff, and they were very accommodating when answering our questions.  We were also able to store luggage here when we went on short tours that took us to other hotels but didn't require all of our belongings.  Shower had acceptable power, and the one breakfast we ate in their restaurant was very good.  As others have noted, it is along the bus routes, and there are also always taxis going by.  Our bed was comfortable, though the Irish seem to enjoy a harder pillow than what we are used to.  While it is a nice stroll into town, the distance is far enough that you probably will not want to walk back after a day of Dublin sightseeing.  There is also an 'Air Coach' stop nearby that makes for convenient transport to and from the airport (hotel staff had to point it out to us since there is no indication that the air coach will stop there). 

Our one minor complaint is that our room (same on all three stays) was so small, we found it hard to maneuver around the luggage and each other.  Booked through this site at a much better rate than the hotel offered, so perhaps I inadvertently booked the tiny room.  If staying here again, I'd make sure we had more space, but in all honesty, if we were to do a Dublin tour again, we'd probably try to stay closer to the main part of the city for better walking ease.  This is, however, a great spot for getting more peace and quiet.",5,2016,10,21
222,Brilliant,Staff are wonderful and the rooms are cosy fills like a home away from home. It's the best Irish fry I've ever had and it's not swimming in oil. Close to the centre and some really good restaurants and great pub. Secure parking what else could you ask for. ,5,2016,10,20
222,Quirky But Well Appointed,"We stayed here on our last night in Dublin, in this old repurposed Victorian Building. It is a bit out of the tourist areas, but nothing a good (20-30) minute walk can't fix. It is right on a bus line, and there is a handy mailbox right in front. The bed was comfy (if cozy) and the room noise was minimal, despite facing a busy street. The common rooms are quite nice. Our room was very small, but had a little entrance hallway, with stained glass windows, and the bathroom had a jacuzzi bath which was wonderful. There was a DVD player with a few DVDs in the room as well. In the morning, about 8am, we were terrified by an extremely loud fire alarm going off. After a minute or so, before we were even able to leave our floor, it stopped. We were told that it was a problem, that if someone took a shower and left their bathroom door open, the smoke alarm was so sensitive that it registered the steam as smoke from a fire. Better safe than sorry, but not a pleasant way to start the day.",4,2016,10,18
222,Nice Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay here. There were 8 of us and they were very helpful and kind. We were so tired when we arrived and they let us check in early. The breakfast was delicious too. It was convenient to walk into town or take the Hop on Hop off bus. Dublin was so much fun and it was nice to come home to our room. We had a nice big bathtub and a sauna, which was so relaxing after all the sightseeing. It is a little out of the hub bub of the city which was fine with us. ",5,2016,10,18
222,Excellent Stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge and had a great time. Excellent room, great breakfast, friendly staff and the bus is right out the front door to get into the city; only 10 minute ride. Within a 10 minute walk are some great restaurants and local pubs. We highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Dublin.",5,2016,10,18
222,Dublin Vacation 2016,"Very Central location, city bus out front, single room was spacious facing front and didn't find the noise loud at all. Room was  well maintained and clean. The staff were knowledgeable and provided excellent customer service. I highly recommend.

Thanks to everyone, I really enjoyed my stay.

Ontario, Canada",5,2016,10,18
222,Handy out of centre location,"It's only a straightforward walk of about 30 minutes into town, but frequent buses stop right outside. Evening meals aren't available but there are many eating establishments only a short walk away.

The hotel packs a lot into a small space, but is clearly well maintained and the staff were friendly and helpful.

There's secure parking at the rear, and a lift is available from there. Steps at the front may be an issue for anyone with mobility issues.",4,2016,10,17
222,Interesting room with Jacuzzi and Sauna,Receptionist for both check in and check out was really friendly and extremely helpful. All the staffs are very professional. Great breakfast but not included with room price. The room itself is big enough for three people but the corridors inside the room is a bit narrow.,5,2016,10,17
222,Cute hotel in quiet neighborhood,"This hotel was lovely, and the service was excellent!  The front desk attendant was extremely helpful with our questions about what to do, where to eat, and how to get around.  He marked up a map and told us exactly which buses to get on, etc.  I can't say enough about the service--coffee and biscuits upon arrival and a complimentary umbrella when it was raining.  The hotel is not in the city center, so it is a little walk or bus ride to the activity, but it is nice and quiet when it's time for bed.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,17
222,A very satisfying experience!,"I loved this hotel! It's in a nice neighborhood with some good restaurants, not too far from the city center, and bus stops nearby for both regular transit and hop-on-hop-off city tours. The single room I stayed in was small, but nice with a music system and DVD player. From a personal standpoint, I experienced good hospitality. I arrived in Dublin 2 hours before check in time and was still suffering from a cold. The room was already available, so they let me check in early so I could rest. I was also offered tea, and when it was brought to me, I not only had a full pot with milk and sugar on the tray, but also a plate full of biscuits and digestives!",5,2016,10,14
222,Lovely hotel!,"My husband and I booked this hotel for a week for our first trip to Ireland. We booked about six months in advance through TripAdvisor and got an amazing rate. We wanted to have a home base in Dublin and this was the perfect spot. The location was exactly what we wanted -- a short walk to the Trinity College area, but removed from the hustle and bustle of the downtown. It was also convenient for taking the bus and the Aircoach. We had an overnight flight from Halifax/St. John's and appreciated that the staff made an effort to let us check in to our room a few hours early. 

The room was very clean and comfortable and larger than I expected in a small European hotel. A very nice room and we liked that we could open the balcony door to get fresh air. Our room was very warm so we made a habit of opening the balcony door each evening when we came home. Even with the door open, the neighbourhood was quiet and peaceful. The fridge, kettle and tea in the room were great to have. We picked up some fruit, yogurt, etc. at a nearby Tesco and had a quick, affordable breakfast in our room each morning.

Out of our week's stay, there was one morning where my husband had an issue with the water pressure -- there were a lot of people showering at the same time, so he had to wait a few minutes for the water pressure to recover. That was the only issue we ran into and it only happened once. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2016,10,14
222,Nice little Hotel,"Very well located, this Hotel is not so big.
I stayed in a small room for a single person.
Besides being small the room has everything, including a DVD player, an expresso machine and a good bathroom.
The staff is Ok.
Great breakfast.",5,2016,10,13
222,Loved it!,"My room had a sauna and Jacuzzi and it was perfect for one person staying for a couple of days with work. The breakfast was great, staff very helpful, and a great location! Recommended! I would go back in a heartbeat.",5,2016,10,13
222,Great Find in Dublin,"The hotel was very comfortable and accommodating. Meghan was particularly wonderful. The sauna was a nice additional touch. It is very convenient to the bus, and an easy walk into City Center. Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,10,12
222,Fantastic Choice for a Stay in Dublin,"Staying here is one of the best decisions I made during my entire trip.  Its beautiful, clean, the staff is professional and the Irish Breakfast is delicious. 

You can't beat the in room Sauna and Jacuzzi tub as well.  Its a 10-15 min walk to city centre but still has dining options nearby.  I will definitely stay here during my next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,10,12
222,Outstanding ,"Friendly staff helped us organise our day trips. Offered us free coffee yo our room despite also having our own nespresso machine in there. Bonus sauna in room and hot tub. Clean, friendly and cosy. Dvd player and selection of films in room. Comfortable beds. Great location on beautiful street. I couldn't recommend this place more highly ",5,2016,10,10
222,Was much able my expectations,"My room was not booked by me, so I did not know what to expect. It was lovely. An annex out of the main building, with a massive bed, jacuzzi and sauna, plus fab TV and coffee facilities. And, if you like them, plenty of cats. It is about a 20 min walk to the centre of town, and near the Schoolhouse Bar, which has good music and a nice atmosphere.",4,2016,10,10
222,Excellent Boutique Hotel in Great Location,"In mid- September, I spent 4 nights in this hotel to attend university reunion events. Access from Dublin Airport was easy using the Airport Coach which stops  close to the hotel (Schoolhouse stop). All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  I had a single room and although small was very well appointed and airy (I like the window open).  The breakfasts were excellent with a great choice of cereals, yogurts etc.. and a marvelous cooked selection, served by Agnes who was a delight. I loved the location in the south side which is within easy walking distance of St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street and also to the DART Lansdowne Road station. All in all, a great place to stay.",5,2016,10,09
222,Just perfect,"For our wedding anniversary in Dublin we were looking for a hotel with a typical Victorian atmosphere but at the same time clean and up to date: Roxford Lodge was just perfect! Mrs Agnes was a perfect host (we woke her up in the middle of the night because our flight was terribly late...) and prepared wonderful breakfasts: take your time to enjoy it before a visit to the city. We like to walk and the center is in walking distance (15 minutes) but the area is well served by buses, also to the airport. Nice room with private sauna and jacuzzi! We hope to be back soon!",5,2016,10,09
222,Great little hotel in a great location,"We had a 2-night stay in this cozy little hotel, and things were well-organized.  The rooms are clean, and even stocked with movies to watch!  Walking distance to a few places, but far enough away from the busy parts of the city.  We would stay there again.",5,2016,10,08
222,Very impressive hotel,"Extremely friendly staff who went out of their way to assist.  Fantastic room, comfortable bed, well located. We will definitely stay there next here. We had a sauna in our room. We didn't choose to take breakfast. We only stayed two nights but would have liked to have stayed longer.",5,2016,10,07
222,Nice but nothing too special,"We stayed here for two nights while visiting Dublin on our honeymoon. Before booking I emailed the hotel to see if we could get a room with a sauna since this is the reason I wanted to stay here. We were guaranteed a room with this amenity. When we arrived and were shown to our room there was no sauna. I mentioned that we were guaranteed one and the staff said there wasn't a room available. This was very disappointing because as I said, this was the reason we decided to stay here. The room itself was a triple, not the double we had booked. We took a nap mid-day because of our jet-lag and the entire time there was some sort of ""squeak"" coming from the tv area that kept waking both of us up. We mentioned this to the receptionist on our way out to dinner and she said she would have a look and leave us a note if she left before we came back. She did leave a note saying she stayed in the room for awhile and even had a colleague come in but couldn't hear anything. In all fairness, she was VERY nice and apologetic that this kept us awake. We didn't hear the noise that night but it did come back our second night. When we checked in we were informed that coffee was available to be delivered to our room...the first morning we had it delivered but the second morning when we called they told us to use the espresso machine in the room. One morning we both ordered a full Irish that cost 12 euro a piece. Not worth it. You can get much better for a much more reasonable price. The location was nice, about a 15 minute walk to city center. The room was a decent size and overall clean except for a few questionable areas in the tub. The staff was very nice just wish they held up to their guarantees and had more consistent service.",3,2016,10,06
222,Dad's Birthday ,This is the second time I have stayed here in a year .. last time was lovely so thought would bring Dad over for his Birthday treat - once again was a really nice stay .. lovely rooms all with their own individuality - a stunning relaxing lounge to chill out in -  clean - great location -breakfast always spot on and was nice to see the same lovely lady as last time still there  at breakfast - I can't fault this place - my Dad loved it too on his first trip and we will return again ,5,2016,10,06
222,Warm and Welcoming,"Staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel has homely, comfortable ambience and the bed rooms are cosy. Central location is perfect for walking to city centre in one direction, 3Arena in the other and very close to Aviva Stadium. Our second visit and certainly not our last.",4,2016,09,29
222,Rustic en rustig ,"Rustic hotel in a good quiet neighborhood. Close to restaurant the old Spot! Go there!! 
Rooms have everything you would want. Double beds are actually large single beds unless you're very much in love.
Beautiful bathroom with jacuzzi function. Clean.
Breakfast is perfect. Lots of fruit and all you can eat cereals.",4,2016,09,29
222,Great place,I loved the sauna in the room. As well the jets in the bath tub. The staff where very friendly and helpful. Special thanks to queeva for her help answering my questions and her fast response to my wife and I requests. ,5,2016,09,26
222,Wonderful,"After spending time in many smaller European hotels we were elated to stay at the Roxford.  We were greeted with hot tea and crackers in our room. We were elated to have a king bed, sauna, whirlpool, and large Irish breakfast. We are located 15 minutes walking time to Grafton street shopping and Trinity College.  This has a wonderful vibe, clean, and friendly staff.",5,2016,09,26
222,Great place to stay,Very nice hotel within walking distance of the city center. Good service.  Good rooms.  Comfortable beds. Coming from the US and booking sight unseen is my least favorite way to travel but the hotel was a pleasant surprise. We are planning one more night here before we go home. ,4,2016,09,25
222,More Than a 3-Star Hotel,"When my husband and I booked a room for one night at the Roxford Lodge Hotel, we were looking forward to spending the night in a well-appointed hotel in a quiet neighborhood that positioned us for travel around Dublin. The Roxford Lodge is a quietly elegant hotel, and definitely offers an outstanding accommodation for a visitor to Dublin. The hotel property exceeded our expectations.

What we didn’t anticipate is that we would need to spend two nights at the Roxford, and be treated so graciously and sympathetically by Megan and Caoimhe, two hotel staff who saw to our needs.  Not only did they offer us beverage service replete with biscuits, but also they helped us to address a medical situation.  It became evident after one night’s stay that I needed to see a doctor.  Caioimhe made an appointment for me with a doctor at a local hospital and made arrangements for transportation.  Megan assisted us in making train reservations so that we would be able to join the rest of our traveling companions after spending an extra night in Dublin.  Arrangements were quickly made to move our luggage from the room we stayed in during the first night to the last room available for the second night and to make the room available as soon as possible.  The room was definitely an upgrade, but we didn’t have to pay the extra $50 per night that we expected to pay.  I am so appreciative that the staff talked with the management/owner on our behalf, and the upgrade charge was waived. What makes this experience even more remarkable is that Megan and Caoimhe made it a point to regularly check with us to ensure that we were being taken care of. Caoimthe and Megan who are compassionate and professional are exemplars in the hotel industry.

As you can probably empathize, when you are sick, you just want to be taken care of and be home, but going home would have required a flight across the Great Pond. The Roxford Lodge Hotel staff did everything they could to make me comfortable and made us feel “at home”.  They will always have a special place in our hearts.",5,2016,09,25
222,Excellent Stay,I stayed for three days. Very helpful staff and great location on near southside. Very comfortable and clean and a hearty Irish breakfast. Close to good restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Highly  recommended. Will definitely stay again.,5,2016,09,24
222,40th Birthday Weekend,"I stayed here with my sister as a birthday treat from me , I had stayed here last year with my husband for our first visit to Dublin and was so impressed by this hotel it was first on my list for this visit
Arrived from the airport by taxi only 23e to have a lovely warm check in , drop our bags and header off for dinner which was recommended and booked for us by reception.
We strolled to a local restaurant took 5 minutes before heading back about 10 pm to settle down as we had a busy day the next day.
Slept like logs in the big comfy beds and it was lovely and quite
We didn't do breakfast the next day as we were out sighting seeing early but we did Sunday and like the time before could not fault it, it was perfect 

Love the DVD's and the player in the room. 

Our flights were not till later that day so when we checked out Will on reception helped us with any information we required and took care of our bags while we did a bit more exploring. 
We had a great weekend , love this hotel and its location ( just near enough to the centre ) and all the staff are amazing 
Thank you again Roxford  Lodge we will be back  ",5,2016,09,24
222,Roxford Lodge,"Nice hotel, professional staff.  Very small rooms.. Clean but dated. A little pricey for what you got in terms of a room and amenities. Probably would not stay here again as there are better hotels in this price range.",3,2016,09,23
222,Dublin on business,"Wonderful stay all be it a bit short on a flying business trip. The staff were very helpful pointing out where to eat ""the Old Spot"" and it was not disappointing. The room was on the ground floor and was very clean and tidy with a small sauna and Jacuzzi bath, unfortunately time meant I didn't get the opportunity to enjoy them. Would certainly book again.",4,2016,09,22
222,First time Dublin visitor,"Great hotel, very accommodating staff. Easy access to downtown and conveniently located on all the bus routes. There were a couple of restaurants and pubs very close by. We enjoyed our stay immensely and would recommend it highly. ",4,2016,09,21
222,Terrific location,"Friendly, helpful staff made our first three nights in Ireland a pleasure. The lodging is a pleasant walk from Trinity College and other areas and was never an issue, though I enjoy walking. The room was very nice, if a bit cozy, with a lovely breakfast every morning.

I would stay at the Roxford again.",4,2016,09,20
222,Superb accommodation,"Quaint, large old house in the upscale  Ballingsbridge neighborhood. We were given a room in the brand new annex at the rear of the property. It came complete with jacuzzi tub, heated towel racks, incredible sound and DVD system, an assortment of movies, USB charging ports, expresso maker and personal sauna.  Very luxurious along with a very helpful staff.",5,2016,09,20
222,Convenient Lcation,"The hotel was ideal. 15 minutes or so walk from the hustle and bustle of Dublin city centre, on a quiet road, and only 10 minutes drive from the docks, perfect for an early morning ferry.

The room was beautifully decorated and the bath included a jacuzzi. The staff were very warm and friendly. I can't comment on the food as I didn't eat there. Thus small (20+) room hotel is highly recommended.",4,2016,09,19
222,Would definitely stay sgain,"Three nights on a whistle-stop tour of Ireland, starting here in Dublin. 15-20 mins walk from the main part of town, secure parking and a comfy room - what more could you ask for? The bed was extremely comfy and the room had its own sauna and jacuzzi bath. Breakfast is immense - but don't be in a rush as it's all cooked to order. Every member of staff that we spoke to was friendly, welcoming and helpful.",4,2016,09,18
222,Only stayed one night.....wish we could have stayed longer!,"Stayed for one night only on our way back from Barcelona to catch our flight back to the US the next day.  Was originally our first choice on the way over to Dublin but the hotel was booked and we had to make another choice.  Oh how I wish we could have stayed here longer!
So quaint, charming, and in a beautiful tree lined neighborhood. Only a 20 to 30 minute walk to Trinity College, shopping, etc. with many pubs and sights along the way.
The employees are courteous, the rooms are wonderful.  Ours had a dry sauna and a Jacuzzi tub for soaking.  Air conditioned and comfy room. Breakfast was delightful.
All in all....a perfect stop for any couple visiting Dublin. Highly recommended!",4,2016,09,17
222,"Convenient and pleasant location, clean room, very helpful front desk staff",We had a nice 3-day stay here. It was great to be able to get the bus easily to and from the airport and the short walk into the center of things was very enjoyable. The room was small but comfortable and met our needs. Our room faced the street and sometimes there was traffic noise but it didn't cause us a problem at all. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.,5,2016,09,16
222,Great room with a mini Sauna!,"This was a pleasant way to end our honeymoon in Ireland.  Nice sized room with a very comfortable bed, and an infrared sauna that we took full advantage of!  There are bus stops right outside the front door, which make it super easy to get into town, but it is close enough that we were able to walk home.  Very friendly staff showed us the private parking area in the back and all the features in our room, and even offered us tea or coffee upon arriving.  There was a nice sized TV with a DVD player and even movies we could watch.  We very much enjoyed our stay here!",5,2016,09,16
222,Wonderful relaxing stay.,"Our first visit to Ireland was welcoming with extremely friendly staff, wonderful showers and very comfortable beds. The executive suite had some unusual amenities including sauna, jacuzzi and a bottle of wine and box of Butler chocolates. The hallways are narrow but bright and there was plenty of lighting. Car park is available as well as s lift. All the staff were knowledgeable and accommodating. Breakfasts were freshly made with a wide variety of choices served by a warm And charming Iris lady.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because breakfast was not included in the price of the room and the room was prepaid. For the price the breakfast should have been included. ",4,2016,09,16
222,4 nights in Ballsbridge,"We arrived at the Roxford Lodge and were brought around back , outside the hotel to the two rooms they have added near the parking lot. At first I was concerned because I had read a complaint about the noise (read on concerning noise) but the room was so lovely , including a spa of it's own ( jacuzzi and sauna along with a shower) that we had to give it a try! In the room there is a lovely pod coffee machine with ample coffee selections, a DVD player with a selection of DVD's and you are stocked with soaps, shampoos and bath gel each day.
It is situated about a 15-20 minute walk to town but there is bus stop in front of the hotel,  you can take the 4 or 7 directly into the central part of town if you want.
Being at the back has some advantages aside from the lush room. You can come and go without going up and down the front stairs but you trade off a small amount of  parking gate opening and closing with the usual people noise you would encounter in any hotel. We slept well in the wonderful King size bed, there is a wake up service if needed.
Breakfast was lovely, the bacon the best on our trip and there was always a fresh bowl of cut fruit (and bananas and apples too). Agnes ( the proprietor) served breakfast each morning making sure her guests were all happy and ready to sightsee.
We went to Beggar's Bush pub about a 1/2 block away and found it to be good food and service ( salmon especially),
We recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel.
The Aircoach was very convenient from Heathrow dropping off and picking up a block away from the hotel . There was a bus strike on our last day which are apparently scheduled regularly so don't count on the Airlink to get you to the airport unless you check with Dublin city information first.",5,2016,09,16
222,"Friendly people, clean, small room","I had a short but pleasant stay here. People were friendly, breakfast was good and the place was clean. The room was small and contained a sauna. I'd have preferred somewhat more space in the room and no sauna.",4,2016,09,16
222,Cramped basement room looking out on carpark - too expensive for what you get,"Friendly helpful reception - but no restaurant or bar open when I arrived! though I'm sure it said there was when I booked. TV sticking out of the wall directly above the bed! so I had to be careful when getting up. Polycotton sheets (and I think pillowcases/duvet)! and a direct view from the car park into my room... Very tired carpet, infrared 'sauna' just by the bed, etc. etc. On the other hand it was clean, quiet, ok temperature, everything worked - but 'luxury' and worth c 100E a night? no, not in my case",2,2016,09,13
222,Perfect for spending a weekend in Dublin,"Located approx. 250 metres from the next Aircoach station, the hotel offers a very good combination of everything you need for a short stay in Dublin: walking distance to the city centre, various breakfast options, a parking lot behind the building, spacious room (and bed), reasonably sized bathroom. Being very annoyed by the street noise, we had asked for another quiet room with backyard view which has been provided us immediately by the friendly staff.",5,2016,09,12
222,Some reservation systems are better than others,"This was a terrible experience, in that we ended up paying for a room for two nights that we didn't get to use as the hotel online reservation system screwed up the dates. And since the system keeps on sending me these requests for reviews here it is",1,2016,09,12
222,Cranmer Place Heaven,"We were a party of 7 and stayed at the Cranmer Place townhouse owned by the hotel and it was fantastic!
We were welcomed from the off, the hotel allowed us to leave our bags both before and after we checked in and even moved them to the location for us. They even printed our boarding passes for us too!
All the staff were really friendly, especially Desmond who gave us a guided tour and kindly left provisions for us. We had three sets of keys and the house was extremely clean.
Would definitely recommend it as a great base to explore and would definitely return!",5,2016,09,11
222,Wonderful Stay,"Highly recommend this establishment to anyone staying in Dublin. Very nice place with friendly and helpful staff. For our first stop in Ireland we were quickly brought to ease with a warm welcome. Rooms are comfy, breakfast is wonderful, and we were able to walk to many of the top attractions. It felt like home and we were sad to leave. Thank you. We hope to return again one day!",5,2016,09,09
222,Birthday weekend,"The hotel was exactly the right walking distance away from the centre of Dublin . The staff were really friendly and informative about the local area and the hotel had a deal with a local taxi service which was brilliant and cheaper than trying to sort it out yourself. The rooms were very clean, comfy bed and the addition of a whirlpool bath was a bonus. The only downside was dining room, the breakfast was great , really filling , but the dining room was small and the lady who was in charge was doing everything herself. Not enough tables for the guests. Great hotel would definately recommend.",4,2016,09,07
222,A lovely small hotel in Dublin,"The Roxford Lodge Hotel was great. From the people who worked there, to the great breakfast, to the sauna and jacuzzi tub in our room, everything was top notch. We also had a balcony with sliding doors which was an extra bonus! The area the hotel is located in was lovely. We were able to walk to central Dublin in under 15 minutes. And from the look of central Dublin, with all the construction, we were happy to be a bit out of the construction zones. I would highly recommend the hotel.",4,2016,09,06
222,Very nice without over doing it,"If you enjoy Boutique type B'n'Bs then you can't go wrong with this little gem. We enjoyed 3 nights here on our first ever visit to Ireland and left suitably impressed. The rooms are slightly on the smaller side but ample enough for comfort although a bit more shelving space in the bathroom would please the female customers more and an easily accessible toilet roll would be nice to. One other negative about the shower is the curtain is about 18 inches too long, if you hang it over the bath the shower water cascades over the floor, leave it on the inside and you fight a constant battle between tripping over it and unblocking the drain with it. It does have a combined bath/spa, we didn't use it but still a nice touch. 
A lovely old lady will serve you breakfast downstairs each morning, sometimes a little late and forgetful and inconsistent but that just adds to the charm. Prices are very reasonable and the choices sufficient. 
Reception staff are very helpful, ask and you shall receive anything. There is a very odd barefoot cleaner who spoke little English I encountered one morning when trying to use the guest lounge, very strange lady so I beat a hasty retreat. 
There is a bus stop directly outside and some good pubs are only a few minutes walk away, as is one of the hop on hop off bus tour stops so very location friendly. The rooms are quiet, they let in a little outside ambient light but otherwise fine. 
Overall, very comfortable and would definitely return back. ",5,2016,09,05
222,Graham Kinnaird,Fantastic hotel. Well situated. Lovely decor and friendly staff. Will stay again! 15 min walk into Dublin city centre and only 5min walk from the Aviva Stadium. Ideal for matches. Beautifully quaint part of the fair city. ,5,2016,09,04
222,Highly recommend ,"We spent 3 nights at the Roxford, and had a great time. Location was very convenient, and the accommodations were perfect. Not sure of the spelling, but Caoimhe was most helpful and pleasant. She was able to answer all questions, and always steered us in the proper direction. The location was very good, about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College. The room was very comfortable, and the sauna was a nice touch. ",5,2016,09,01
222,Best hotel bed I've ever slept in,"A friend recommended this place, & our party of 6 loved it. We dropped our luggage off at 8am, & were greeted with tea, biscuits & coffee. It's an easy, direct & flat walk just 20 minutes into city center, & there's a neighborhood pub literally around the corner for an evening pint. The room was compact but so comfortable- we wanted to take the beds with us! Good bath & shower, quiet. There were many DVDs for families, & good tourist directions. The morning breakfast was bountiful & delicious. (extra- not included with our room). Back alley off street parking was easy.  I would certainly stay here again & suggest it to others.",5,2016,08,31
222,Great location near ferries and city centre,"Very friendly and helpful staff - clean if tiny room! I would definitely stay again.
The jacuzzi bath and in room sauna was a quirky addition to the room.
Great location for ferry port and about 20 mins walk to city centre.",4,2016,08,31
222,Excellent Hotel,"stayed here for business, late check in, friendly staff, comfortable room and nice breakfast, all good.

only small issue was the water for the shower (room 123) was running hot then cold a little, but not a show stopper.",5,2016,08,31
222,"Friendly and comfortable hotel, a little pricey though","We really enjoyed our stay here, the staff were very friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The only thing that let it down slightly was the price, however, to be fair to the hotel they were similarly matched to other ranked hotels in Dublin for our weekend, perhaps it's just staying in Dublin is expensive! The breakfast could have been added for the price paid. The bathroom was a little small as well but we would stay here again given the opportunity.",4,2016,08,30
222,A Little Gem...,"Oh how I enjoyed my short stay at this gem of a hotel from the outset.  It had all  luxury features at a mid range price.  The customer service and welcome shown by Caoimhe  at reception was very much appreciated.  She showed me to my single room, which had a passageway with separate stained glass doors to the bathroom, the wardrobe and the bedroom.  When I entered my bedroom, there was a dry sauna nicely situated in it as well as all other essential amenities. As I settled into my room, I was brought tea and biscuits, which were served throughout my stay.  

I adored my time at The Roxford Lodge Hotel; it was so well situated near the centre of Dublin and it complemented my trip to Dublin.  Caoimhe was equipped with so much local knowledge and suggested how I could  maximise my short time in Dublin Town.  My full breakfasts were served so conscientiously by Agnes, who ensured that I had all that I needed throughout  my time in the restaurant.  

All in all, I felt so refreshed after my stay at The Roxford Lodge Hotel and it was exactly what I needed, especially after my restorative yoga retreat I had enjoyed days previously.  Thank you to all at The Roxford Lodge Hotel.  I will certainly recommend this hotel to all who ask, or maybe I will keep knowledge of this little Gem to myself.  See you all again sometime soon, I hope.  Ruthie",5,2016,08,26
222,nice but some negative aspects,The hotel is nice and the break-fast very good with cold and hot meals. My room was rather small and some noise due to the heating system disturbed me all the nights. Good position at 15 min from down town walking distance.,3,2016,08,25
222,No respect for hosts!!,"They made work just in front of my room. So close to it that it was like they were inside the room, notwidthstandin they kwen I was in. Very noisy situation, impossible to work, impossible to rest, I had to leave the room.",2,2016,08,22
222,"Friendly, available with some nice surprises","It is neither a luxury nor a historical place. Still we found a room with character in the design and filled with every kind of facilities from nespresso and tea machine to sauna! to multi standard power sockets to dvd to bluetooth to ipod charger..., sure to delight a family with child but also to please to everybody... even a picky teen appreciated. Add clean, maintained.  On top very very friedly and customer oriented young staff. Even flexible on dates after my family AerLingus issue, though we had booked a fix-date-prepaid.  Simple and fully enjoyable full Irish breakfast but also an excellent fresh fruit salad.  Dinner only on previous booking. To sum up, great experience.  Congrats!",5,2016,08,22
222,Townhouse down the street from the hotel,"We had a family of six traveling and were put up in a townhome close to the hotel (parking within a garage on premise).  Very clean, modern unit - it did have stairs if you want to avoid them.  Plenty of space for us with four bedrooms, 31/2 baths.  A full kitchen which they had stocked with coffee, toast, juice, etc.  Close to nearby restaurants/pubs or about a 20 minute walk to centre or can grab a cab for about 15 euros. Very quiet and secure.",4,2016,08,20
222,Amazing place to stay.,"We rented a self catering house belonging to the hotel for a family break. There were 9 of us and the house accommodated us perfectly. The receptionist on duty when we collected our keys was really friendly & helpful. When we arrived at the property the staff member (Adrian I think) was extremely helpful. The house was super clean & luxurious. Even tho it was self catering we had milk, bread, orange juice, tea & coffee waiting for us. I can't recommend the hotel or the self catering property enough. Suffice to say this will be our go to place when in Dublin for ever more!! Also a big bonus is on site free parking.",5,2016,08,20
222,Good location and friendly staff,"Hotel is away from busy city central, in a quiet, treed area, which was a treat at the end of a long day of sightseeing. Very easy to get to by city bus. We had one of the brand new rooms at the back of the hotel, with jacuzzi tub, private sauna - very quiet and private. Very helpful staff. We would stay here again.",4,2016,08,20
222,Think twice about staying here if you are looking for quiet,"I had high hopes for my stay at the Roxford lodge because of the strong tripadvisor reviews, but my experience was quite disappointing.  

On the positive side, the wifi was strong and they provide you generous amounts of nespresso pods and milk for you to have coffee in your room, if that's something you enjoy. Some of the staff were quite helpful, but I didn't end up seeing the staff most of the time because I was not located in the main house.    

I was put in one of the two rooms located in what appears to be a former garage at the back of the property.  If I had known that these rooms existed (I couldn't find a reference to them on the website), I would have requested to stay in the main house.  As a female traveller staying on my own in Dublin, I didn't feel safe staying in this isolated room at the back of carpark. The room doesn't an extra chainlink lock on the door like most hotels do.  

These offsite rooms are also really noisy.  My guess is that the main house probably has better sound insulation.  I could clearly hear all of the cars driving by and conversations of pedestrians walking by because the rooms are immediately adjacent to the road behind the house.     

I was in Dublin to run the half marathon. The night before the half marathon there was a loud party going on in the backyard at the next door house.  At midnight, with all the windows in my room closed and with earplugs in, I could still hear a lot of yelling.  I called the front desk to ask if they could perhaps ask their neighbours to move the party indoors.  The woman was very reluctant to do so.  She told me it was just young people having fun, and she didn't think they were likely to respond to her request to try to keep their voices down.  The next morning when I headed out to the start of the half marathon, I saw smashed beer bottles on the sidewalk right outside my room.  

So just because the hotel is located in a residential neighbourhood, it unfortunately doesn't mean that it will be a quieter stay than if you decide to stay at a hotel in downtown Dublin.  

There were also a few housekeeping issues the day I checked into my room.  There weren't any coffee pods provided, so I had to call to ask.  When I went to bed the first night, I noticed that there were stains on the bed sheets (I couldn't tell whether they were from the last occupant or just didn't get properly bleached in the wash).  It was too late at night by then to have the sheets changed, so I really wished I had noticed it sooner.  When I called reception the next morning to let them know that there were stains on the sheets, they agreed to change the sheets, but they didn't seem concerned about housekeeping's oversight.  

So based on my experience I wouldn't recommend staying here. But I might have had a very different experience if I had stayed in one of the rooms in the main house.",3,2016,08,19
222,"Friendly Staff, Small Room.","Enjoyed our visit, good secure off road parking, in a handy location about 15 to 20 minutes from centre of Dublin. Room very clean and comfortable bed.

Lady on reception very helpful, and quality of breakfast good.

Our room was on the small side, and breakfast service on our first day was a bit chaotic, as we had a 35 minute wait for a table despite pre-booking breakfast.

Ideal for an overnight stop, but would like a larger room with some storage for clothes for a longer stay.",4,2016,08,18
222,Friendly plus,"This hotel is in a great place, right on a bus stop, and walkable to the city. It's a main road, but I didn't find it too busy or noisy. Front steps make it a little hard getting a heavy bag up there, but you're met by a friendly, helpful face at the front desk.
I had a budget double room on the ground floor. It was pretty cramped, and while comfortable, I did feel that they were trying to appeal to everyone all at once. A sauna and jacuzzi weren't really necessary in every room. But the bed was comfortable. There's a pretty garden outside. Wifi worked too.
I would stay here again.",4,2016,08,17
222,Excellent!,Beautiful hotel which is in a quieter street despite being very central. Excellent local for wandering into town and paces from the bus stop for the airport bus. Very friendly atmosphere and staff were very accommodating. Jacuzzi bath was a lovely luxury but the poor extraction system in the bathroom meant after the shower had been on for even a short period of time the walls and floor were quite wet and slippery. The room itself was beautifully decorated and the DVDs were a good idea too! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin. We didn't opt for the breakfast but would recommend voilà just a short walk away.,4,2016,08,16
222,"Good location, friendly staff, but small room","The staff is great, and so is the location. I suggest not getting a standard room unless you are one person using it. The other rooms are much bigger and nicer. If the room had been bigger, the rating would be excellent.",4,2016,08,13
222,Outstanding choice,"We arrived early morning after a redeye flight and were greeted by very friendly staff with tea and a place to relax and store our bags.  We chose a house to accommodate the family and were very pleased.  The neighborhood is quiet and feels very safe. The house was very clean and fresh looking, beds comfortable, free Wifi, hot showers, parking in front, washer/dryer, plenty of space to hang out - large living room and a back yard!  The kitchen was stocked for breakfast with milk, juices, bread and jam for toast, cereal, coffee and tea. There were several great restaurants within a few blocks - pub food, pizza, steak house, groceries, etc.  Downtown is about 15 minute walk and passes shops for groceries or coffee along the way.  We will definitely choose the Roxford Lodge Hotel the next time we go to Dublin.",5,2016,08,10
222,Faultless ,"We booked a 4 bedroom house for one night as we were attending the Beyoncé concert. 
Our reception was friendly and welcoming, the house was beautiful! Clean, modern and the fridge was stocked with milk, juices and butter, there was brown and white bread and cereal also. 
Coffee machine stocked with all types of coffee. 
The staff were great, the house was perfect with wifi to boot. 
We had a great stay and would definitely book again. ",5,2016,08,08
222,"Clean, comforable, close to central Dublin","This hotel is located in a quite residential neighborhood about 20 mins walk from central Dublin which is also serviced by two bus lines.  The room, if a little small, was clean, comfortable, and well appointed. The staff were very helpful. Free secure parking is a plus. Good places to eat locally: Oil Can Harry's (dinner),  Searsons (dinner), Eathos (breakfast)",5,2016,08,07
222,A-maze-ing luxury,"Hotel is situated within walking distance to the docks with the beautiful harp shaped bridge and to the town centre. We felt so comfortable in the lounge getting ready and planning day ahead we wanted to stay there even longer feeling like at home. 
In the labyrinth of rooms we found ourselves in a luxurious on-suite rooms with built-in sauna with CD-player and Jacuzzi, excellent for the day after a long walk in drizzling Irish rain. Helpful and informative staff - priceless. Delicious breakfast was served with kindest care. 
Arrangement with a taxi firm was useful for our transfer from the hotel to the airport in Dublin. 
My friend and I highly recommend this hotel. Enjoy :)",5,2016,08,07
222,Beauty is only skin deep,"I was really excited to stay at the roxford lodge while in dublin for work. I even went out of my way to switch hotels for one of my three weeks here in order to do so. I stayed in the executive suite most of the week and switched to a regular room for the last night. The suite was beautifully laid out with a small kitchenette, stained glass light fixtures,  a lovely jacuzzi, and an office area. It was not well maintained however. There were cobwebs and dusty areas in the room, several of the lights were burned out, the walls and ceiling had patches that were primed but not painted, and there were no kitchen supplies (plates, utensils, bowls, cooking spoons, etc) except for pans. I brought these to the staffs attention and was able to get kitchen supplies and the lights replaced but they never did dust the areas I requested. 

The second room was lovely with beautiful crown molding and ceiling medallions. It was down a musty smelling hallway. The carpet in the room was wet and the linens had hair on them. I let the employee (manager?) know and asked for a different room. The response? ""That's impossible. I have to see this"" we go to the room and she (manager?) takes a look at the bed and feels the wet floor.  ""The bed is perfectly clean. The hair must have got there in the laundry"" Obviously it is not perfectly clean or there wouldn't be hair. ""I don't understand how the floor could be wet. Maybe it got wet when they cleaned the Jets in the tub. We are completely booked so I don't have any rooms to switch you to."" 

There were no apologies for the oversight on the cleaning- no extra dusting in the first room to get at least the obvious cobwebs, no offers to bring new linens to replace the hairy current ones or extra towels to dry the wet floor. 

Otherwise, the location was great and most of the staff were nice. 

I wish I could have enjoyed my stay but I will have to skip the lodge on my next trip out.",3,2016,08,05
222,Great friendly hotel,"We stayed one night having booked to see Brad Paisley at the 3arena only for him to cancel. Anyhow. Hotel is ideally located for Aviva Stadium, Lansdowne Road and a 20 minute walk from Grafton Street area of Dublin. On arrival we were welcomed and offered Tea/coffee. Hotel were happy to store our bags whilst we explored as we arrived well before time for check in. They also stored our bags on the day we left.

The room was delightful with great facilities including a Nespresso machine, good flatscreen TV and a selection of DVDs. The room even included a sauna. Bathroom was modern and very smart. Dining facilities were excellent. Would thoroughly recommend the Full Irish breakfast, excellent black & white pudding!  One very small issue was poor WiFi speed/connection. Would recommend anyone to stay here. You won't  be disappointed. ",4,2016,08,02
222,Great location ,We had booked into the Roxford as we were going to a football match at the aviva  staff were brilliant from we checked in. Roxford was about a 10 min walk to the ground so was real handy to get to and from and an outdoor a 20 min walk to the town. Will definitely be back to the roxford ,5,2016,08,01
222,Relaxing stay,"Spent relaxing 2 nights at this hotel. Room was very clean, staff were extremely helpful, friendly and the location was excellent- quiet neighbourhood but not far from city centre and only yards from the airport bus stop",5,2016,07,31
222,Hotel or B&B?,"There are some good things about the Roxford Lodge: it's in a good location for walking into downtown Dublin - around 15 minutes; the cooked breakfast is excellent ... that's about it really. The photos on the website are of the best rooms, obviously; ours wasn't one of those photographed: it wasn't dingy by any means, just not great. There was some leftover food and drink in the fridge - and we hadn't used the fridge, so it wasn't ours. The fire alarm went off at 6 am the first morning, somebody had left the hot water tap running we found out much later, and the steam had caused the alarm to go off - at least the fire alarm works, was all the sympathy we got on that. There is no bar, and the wi-fi is pretty dire - as it seems to be in most hotels to be fair. So, basically the place is an expensive B&B with unsympathetic staff apart from the lady in the dining area, who is very nice.",3,2016,07,31
222,Top Calss,Haven't stayed in the Roxford Lodge for quite a while but took the opportunity on a rare trip to Dublin to book in last night and thankfully it hasn't changed... Top class service; fantastic comforts (including Sauna in room) and amazing breakfast with free parking out back and of course the most pleasant welcome Agnes and her team of professionals..,5,2016,07,29
222,The best little room I ever had!,"I love travel, have been around the world several time. This was my third time in Ireland, around which I travelled in a Renault Diesel. (If you drive Ireland I recommend a diesel; it's less expensive and the mileage was outstanding!)

I've stayed at a few hotels in Dublin, but checked out this one. First, I'd been coming from Mallow, County Cork. I'd had a room booked in Kilkenny. If I could have gotten the room at Roxford a night earlier, I might have skipped Kilkenny. But, the young woman on staff said I could only do a double that night. So, the Kilkenny expense in addition to a double would have been...costly. And, frankly, when I got to Roxford I didn't know what to expect. 

I was alone and the young woman (whose name I might have been gentleman enough to ask, but I wasn't!) said the room wasn't ready yet. (I'm a tour guide who's always early!) so she advised me a few places to visit. I did that and her advise was golden. When I returned, she took me to the room: A single bed next to which was a sauna, and there as a Jacuzzi bathtub. I was delighted!

A full Irish breakfast was available at 7:30 each morning. I was thrilled with the lady who served. We were even able to talk politics, clearly my avocation. And it's not far from the center of town. Inside of maybe 25 minutes I could be at Trinity College near to which I took a ""1916"" tour.

I can't stress too highly my delight with the place. I plant to return with my wife before long.",5,2016,07,28
222,Great hotel in excellent location,"For a person travelling on a budget, this was a surprisingly great find. Located close to the city centre, within walking distance but also close to transport links (including the bus to the airport), it had everything a visitor to Dublin could wish for. The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful, and standards in general were excellent.",5,2016,07,27
222,Excellent location with off street parking rooms within lodge very clean tidy .,"Very comfortable staff made every one very welcoming easy to commute to other locations of interest within city ,One has to comment the breakfast has to be the best in Dublin City ,over all enjoyable stay certainly on my stop over locations within the city",5,2016,07,25
222,A very nice Ireland experience!,"We enjoyed our stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel very much. Cozy rooms; lovely and clean. The coffee/cappuccino machine in the room was a big success!  Not a huge room, but that's okay. We had a wonderful breakfast as well!
Thank you!",5,2016,07,24
222,"Good location, welcoming staff","Roxford Lodge is a beautiful building and the staff make you feel at home right away.  After providing us with tea, the reception staff helped us make phone calls to Irish relatives and plan our tour of the city.  We had a very enjoyable stay.

CityScape bus tour and the DART train line are near the hotel.  Parking is located behind the hotel and there is no hotel staff overnight.",4,2016,07,19
222,Beautiful beginning to a holiday.,We arrived after an exhausting trip from Canada to find a warm and welcoming staff Caoimhe helped us to get settled and went the extra mile to help us secure a place for a late dinner. The room was clean and cozy with fresh linens and tasteful decor. The neighbourhood was quiet and the beds comfortable which made for a restful night. In the morning we were treated to a delicious breakfast.There was free parking which was an added bonus.,5,2016,07,16
222,Welcome oasis after long and exhausting travel,"Absolutely incredible experience. After traveling from Vancouver, we were welcomed by the warm front desk staff and shown to our room.The linens were clean and fresh, the bed was comfortable, and the room was quite. Our room even included a sauna and jet spa bath tub. Breakfast (included) in the quaint dining room was fantastic and Agnes offered incredible hospitality. I would 100% recommend this hotel to traveling couples who want a base to explore Dublin. A bit of a walk to city center but it is very enjoyable and takes you by a lot of great sights.",5,2016,07,15
222,Charming and Relaxing,"My wife and I recently spent 2 nights here while visiting Dublin, Ireland for the first time on our honeymoon in the executive suite, and we were both more than pleased with the experience. From the moment we walked in the door, a kind receptionist was eager to assist us with our baggage and make sure we were at ease. The room itself was immaculately cleaned, and the pictures online don't quite do the room justice, as the bed, jacuzzi, sauna, balcony, and other amenities make it seem as if you are in a tiny house tailored just for you. The location was manageable; while not located in the city centre, it was right by several bus stops, and taxis are never too far away either. The full Irish breakfast was delicious, and more than fulfilled our expectations, with willing and proper service. The only problem with it was the size of the dining room, as we had to wait quite a while for a table and our food one rushed morning. All in all though we both thought it served us well and we thoroughly enjoyed the delightful experience. We would return to stay again next time in Dublin.",5,2016,07,12
222,Excellent accommodation,"I only spent one night here, in a single room, but I was very impressed about the standard of the room - lots of thought given to detail such as both Irish/UK and European type power points, a place to work on a laptop, well functioning free wifi, good lighting, comfortable bed with lots of pillows, well designed bathroom with lots of room to put your own toilet bag etc, good shower and jacuzzi type bath, coffee machine etc. I had breakfast there too, and had an ""Irish breakfast"" which was nicely cooked (including tasty black pudding, eggs, sausages, toast...) and very reasonable price at 12 Euros. Helpful staff, easy walk to town, pleasant neighbourhood, a no. 7 bustop and Aircoach bus service to/from the Airport right outside. I got some kind of discount through Booking.com and the price was very good too - I'm not sure what standard rates would look like. I can thoroughly recommend this place.",5,2016,07,09
222,"Great Value, very comfortable","Super clean, comfy, nice staff. We really liked the in room sauna & jacuzzi. Really nice neighborhood with plenty of pubs & taverns at an easy walk. On bus line too.
The staff was very friendly & helpful.. We have stayed here twice & will be back",5,2016,07,08
222,Excellent Dublin 3-star boutique hotel,"Roxford Lodge is a lovely boutique hotel, in a quiet residential area just a twenty-minute walk from the centre of town and not far from Merrian Square. There is a bus-stop just outside the hotel for those who'd rather not walk. We received a large room with a jacuzzi and a sauna, as well as a DVD player and a good choice of DVDs. The hotel is clean and well-maintained and breakfast is served in a lovely room, looking out onto a garden. Every member of staff we encountered was efficient and friendly and gave us some very good tips on what to see and where to eat. The hotel also has secure parking on its grounds.",5,2016,07,06
222,Great business stopover,"The Roxford Lodge was the perfect business stopover when I needed to be close to my clients. A short walking distance to the city centre and very secure parking plus the great choice of bars and restaurants nearby made my stay comfortable. Staff were very helpful and breakfast was freshly prepared. The coffee maker, sauna and Jacuzzi bath were nice touches in the room. Looking forward to a return visit.",4,2016,07,04
222,A warm welcome in a great location,"Comfortable (though compact) room, very friendly welcome with cups of tea, and a location that is walking distance (just about) from the city centre. Also on a bus route if you don't fancy walking, and reception can arrange taxis for airport transfer.",5,2016,07,03
222,Highly recommended,"Great stay at this hotel for a couple of nights. Room spotlessly clean, nespresso coffee machine, jacuzzi bath and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in at a hotel. The breakfasts were delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful. Would recommend and will definitely stay again next time I visit Dublin.",5,2016,07,01
222,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, very welcoming staff and very good service. Would recommend this nice quiet hotel and definitely will stay there again. Bed extremely comfortable. Staff very helpful with tips on where to go in Dublin and where to eat.",4,2016,06,30
222,great,"Extremely welcoming staff, very good breakfasts, wi-fi, Internet access, whatever you wished to be offered unless you are a total toffee-nose; than go off for your five stars. Fixed price for taxis to the airport -25 Euro. Walking distance from the centre 25 mins. Complimentary tea or coffee straight to your room. Elevator. Dry sauna, jacuzzi bath.",5,2016,06,30
222,Outstanding experience,"My friend and I stayed at Roxford Lodge for 4 nights. The room was sparkling clean and quiet. As we had requested a standard economy room, it was, as expected, somewhat small for two, but we managed.

The 6 euro breakfast was excellent and beautifully served.

What was extremely unique about Roxford Lodge is the front desk staff. Every last one of them was helpful beyond what was expected. From booking tickets to a play to ideas about touring and shopping, there was no end to their kindnesses and enthusiasm. We highly recommend this centrally located as a friendly and wonderful place to stay.",5,2016,06,30
222,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is really a little gem.  Everyone at the hotel was very nice and very helpful, giving suggestions on restaurants and how to find specific places.  We had a wonderful dinner right down the street.  The room was nicely appointed and very comfortable,  it is a bit out of the way from the City Centre area so be prepared for taxis or really walking.  It is in a really wonderful part of Dublin.",5,2016,06,27
222,As good the second time around,"Best value in Dublin; best fresh fruit at breakfast in Ireland.  Comfort! Warm hospitality.
Easy access to airport and city centre.  Don't think twice, book!  Junjiors Restaurant around the corner is memorable for both its service (Miranda) and food (Brian) although I recommend reservations.",5,2016,06,26
222,Lovely,"This was a lovely hotel, with a gracious host and staff. Breakfast was a blessing as we got up early and headed off on our travels for the day. vWe had a wonderful time here, and it was easy to catch buses from here. Our room for three was small, but laid out nicely. We would stay here again if ever back in Dublin. Thank you",5,2016,06,26
222,Quiet and convenient,"Convenient for city centre. Clean and comfortable although room a little small. Friendly helpful staff offered tea on arrival, coffee machine in room.  Breakfast food good, but insufficient tables resulting in 20 minute wait one morning.",4,2016,06,25
222,Lovely place and very friendly staff,"Just stayed here for one night and the room was lovely and the staff were really friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again. I also left my phone charger in the room which the cleaners found. The hotel let me know straight away via email and offered to post the charger on for me, they just politely asked me to cover postage which I was happy to do as it was my mistake.",5,2016,06,25
222,Perfect place!,"A wonderful ""feel like a local"" hotel. It is on a beautiful street, a bus stop right outside the door, and great restaurants and pubs within walking distance.  We took a bus from the airport and it dropped us about a block from the hotel. The hotel also has a flat rate taxi service which we used for the return trip. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the breakfasts were delicious and Agnes was a wonderful host. This was a perfect place for us to stay. Hope to return one day!",5,2016,06,25
222,Lovely stay,"Communication with the hotel was excellent. 

When I arrived I was shown to my room, brought coffee and invited to just relax. It was very much appreciated.

My room had a Nespresso coffee machine and a jacuzzi bath (fantastic!), a selection of DVDs and a comfy bed. What more could a person ask for?

My neighbours played some music which I could hear faintly, and when I tapped the wall they turned it down straight away - thanks ladies! 

Breakfast was great and I don't think my stay could have been better.",4,2016,06,24
222,Hit the sweet spot,"Extremely quiet and peaceful, in a pleasant neighborhood. About a ten-minute walk from Merrion Square; there's a nearby retail-and-restaurant stretch along Baggot Street as well. The room is on the low end of average-sized by European hotel standards--most Americans would think it quite small--but perfectly clean and comfortable (good beds). Roxford Lodge is a great deal overall.",5,2016,06,23
222,A lovely little hotel,"About a mile a and a half from the centre, this is a small but very comfortable little hotel to the south east of Dublin. A little way out of the centre but far more affordable than those closer in. The welcome was warm and the room well appointed. I opted for the pre-ordered breakfast which was excellent. Would visit again. ",4,2016,06,21
222,My new Hotel in Dublin - perfect ,"I don't know why but I wasn't expecting much. I am Dublin on a weekly basis with work and I usually stay in another larger property. I left it late and my usual Hotel was full so I consulted trip advisor and booked the Roxford Lodge.

I checked in quite late and the very attentive girl at reception brought me to my room which was in a separate building. The room was lovely and had all the mod cons like smart tv with Netflix etc. An Espresso machine, a selection of good DVDs. The bed was extremely comfortable with lovely sheets. The bathroom was really well appointed and there is even a sauna and jacuzzi bath. I didn't use these and the shower was lovely.  

The last thing and it's something I place a huge emphasis on when appraising Hotels is the breakfast. This was again of a very high quality and a great selection including cinnamon which completed my perfect stay.

I have been looking around for a good hotel in the Ballsbridge area and I have found it. I can't recommend this Hotel highly enough.",5,2016,06,21
222,Convenient small hotel,"This is a nice, centrally located converted town house in central Dublin. 

The rooms are clean and modern. My single was quite small and reminded me a bit of a posh ships cabin, but it had everything you need -including a mini jacuzzi bath!

Staff are friendly but be aware if you arrive late that the reception is not 24 hours.

No restaurant for dinner but there are several local options.

Definitely recommend for a base for a business or city trip. ",4,2016,06,21
222,Comfortable hotel close to the centre of Dublin,"My wife and I spend four nights at the Roxford while attending a conference at Trinity. We found the hotel welcoming, clean and comfortable, and good value for money. Free parking was a bonus. Very good internet access. Breakfast was good quality, particularly the excellent fresh fruit. The only disappointment was the quality of the breakfast coffee. Good restaurants nearby. 20 minute walk or easy 2 euro bus ride to the city centre. We would certainly use this hotel again, and warmly recommend it.",5,2016,06,20
222,Fabulous stay,"Roxford lodge is a beautiful hotel, well maintained and refurbished to a really high standard. Location is perfect and staff are lovely - nothing is too much trouble for them. Couldn't recommend highly enough.",5,2016,06,19
222,Excellent stay,"Just left Roxford lodge yesterday, and missing it already. Staff were wonderful, the facility was nice, rooms were small (apparently European per my wife) but very adequate. Dublin is so metropolitan that you don't need to spend hours on end in your room, why would you... The owner and his mum were quite delightful and breakfast everyday was perfect. Overall this was well worth the money. Close enough to the convention center but far enough away from downtown to be quiet.  Highly recommend it!  Thanks Agnes!",5,2016,06,18
222,great place in good location,"Everything was fine, cute clean room with an comfortable bed for an excelent price comparing with other options in the neighbourhood. I appreciate the DVD player in the room with selection of movies available.",5,2016,06,17
222,"Modern, top notch accommodations without breaking the bank!","We stayed two nights at the Roxford Lodge and would certainly stay again! Our room was new and quite modern. We loved having a jacuzzi tub, shower and sauna right in our bathroom! Secure parking and entries. Very nice lounge. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating! A bit of a walk to city center but it really made for a nice stroll. Catching a cab or ordering an Uber was easy enough and inexpensive. 

My only comment is to add additional window treatments to the ground level rooms in the very back (136). We weren't able to open our windows during the day, unless we wanted people to see us and our stuff. That made the room very dark at times. 

Again, we loved our stay and would recommend Roxford Lodge to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2016,06,17
222,Great place to stay!!,"Our room was incredible and quite spacious, and the mood lighting in the bathroom was a definite highlight. We were welcomed with juice (Guava?) when we checked in and were helped to the room. The restaurant and staff was excellent as well. The only real negative is there isn't really anything within walking distance. Fortunately, we had a car so we could drive 15 minutes to nearby attractions. ",5,2016,06,15
222,Would not stay here again,"I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for one night at the beginning of June. The person at the front desk was very helpful, and the view from my room on to the street was nice, but that's about it.

I'm not sure how this place has the ratings that it does. The entire property looks very worn out. The furnishings and decor look like they are from the 70's/80's and have not been replaced.

The ""hotel"" has much more of a bed & breakfast feel than a hotel feel. The layout of the rooms and hallways is very strange as well.

The hotel is about a 30 minute walk to Trinity College, so if you are looking for something ""city center"", this wouldn't be it.",1,2016,06,15
222,Glad we chose this hotel,"We had three rooms which varied from good to excellent with commensurate prices and all very comfortable. Ours had a disabled wet room plus kettle and coffee machine and a patio door with access to a small courtyard. Easy walk into town. Secure, free parking at rear.",4,2016,06,14
222,A Grand Dame of a Hotel - Great Location especially if you are a walker,"So glad we booked in this hotel. Lovely room with ample bath. We were on the 3rd floor. Well thought out appointments in the room and bath. The staff was especially welcoming. We were able to have parking every day so easy golfing trips for my husband. We are walkers and so enjoyed our walks into the city center while cutting into Merrion Square. Because of it's age, this hotel will be a bit worn in only a few areas. Most savvy travelers see only the charm. Case in point, a heavy rain came in, I was in the common area using the computer next to the computer. After an hour it stopped. A caretaker came out with broom and bucket: swept the sidewalk of fallen leaves than carefully handpicked them from the gravel walk way and took some time to examine the plants. it helped me appreciate even more their their lovely entrance.",5,2016,06,12
222,Hotel in a quiet neighborhood,"The classic deluxe single room has fulfilled my expectations:
clean and bright, enough storage space, comfortable bed with good pillows, large bathroom with jacuzzi.

A 20 minute walk takes you to Grafton Street. 
Huge servings for breakfast.

very good price-performance ratio - I'll be back!",4,2016,06,12
222,Another lovely visit!,"I stayed here last year with my sister and we enjoyed our stay very much. This time I brought my husband and we found the same outstanding service with a very comfortable room. Roxford Lodge is not flashy. But the beds are comfy and the bathtub fun! (Jacuzzi!). Agnes will bring you a tasty breakfast to your order each morning in the breakfast room. You've never had oatmeal until you have had good Irish porridge. And the brown bread toast! One of the reasons I came back! Caoimhe bent over backwards to help us with tickets for the bus, advice on what to do and really helped us when we discovered a mess up with our airline tickets. The Roxford has a city bus stop right at their doorstep so getting to Trinity College may take as long as 10 minutes. Certainly no longer. But it is also a nice walk as well. Catching the Hop on, Hop off bus is a 5-10 minute walk up the street. There is always a cup of tea or coffee for you in the lounge or your room. They offer this to you all the time! I can't say enough about the Roxford. I highly recommend it. ",5,2016,06,12
222,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We found this hotel via our Rick Steve's guidebook of Ireland. It was a great choice. We upgraded to the executive suite which was simply amazing. There are 3 levels to the suite, a jacuzzi tub AND a dry sauna in your room, along with a wet bar and an office on the porch!  We were spoiled. Agnes greeted us each morning for breakfast and served it with a smile and great Irish humor. What a memorable experience!",5,2016,06,11
222,Hotel with Wonderful Personality,The Roxford Lodge Hotel was the perfect hotel for me while I visited Dublin.  It was walking distance from The Temple Bar district without being too close.  The hotel has great personality and the Staff is superb.  Not one problem.  Try the family suite with a jacuzzi and dry sauna!,5,2016,06,10
222,Excellent Stay,"I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for one night on my own as I was in Dublin attending an event. As I was only getting to Dublin just in time for the event and didn't have time to check in before-hand, I was going to be arriving very late, and they kindly had the night porter wait for me even though my check-in was past midnight (I did coordinate my late arrival time in advance, however). My single room was just as large as many double rooms I've stayed in, and had lovely vaulted ceilings which gave the room an even bigger feel. I was suprised to find that there was a DVD player with a selection of perhaps 20 or so movies and a Nespresso machine with a variety of flavors, neither of which I was expecting. I booked the Roxford Lodge as I know the general area and I didn't want to spend too much money as I wasn't going to be spending much time there and the price was right, but I found that it was actually a much more comfortable and pleasant place than some hotels that are far more expensive. I would absolutely stay here again and would definitely recommend it to friends.",5,2016,06,08
222,Great Hotel close to central Dublin,I have stayed in this hotel on two occasions. The rooms are nice and retain some of the charm of the original building. The building is attractive and nicely landscaped.There is a very nice available breakfast with good gluten free options.We loved the location on this attractive street and enjoyed the short twenty minute walk to the center.It was good being central yet out of the chaos of central Dublin.There were a couple of good restaurants nearby. Service was outstanding.,5,2016,06,08
222,Great Hotel!,Nice hotel in a quiet residential area. Spent 4 nights here and was very satisfied with our stay. Room was comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Only a 15 minute walk to Dublin City Centre. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel if you do not want to walk. Would definately stay here again.,5,2016,06,06
222,Very good,"Good location (within 20 min walk from the city centre), nice staff, very comfortable bed. My single room was tiny, but had everything I needed, and a sauna for myself. Continental breakfast wasn't worth it.",5,2016,06,06
222,Awesome hotel!,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the Roxford Lodge while visiting Dublin.  The Roxford Lodge is about 30 minutes from the City Center, but there are plenty of pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood to explore as well.The Air Coach from Dublin airport will drop you off about a block from the hotel.
We stayed in the Executive Suite and were so surprised at everything this room/suite had to offer!  The suite is actually 3 levels--the first level houses the bathroom and a fully functional kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave, stove, range top, coffee maker and washer/dryer combo. Up a few steps to the main level that  had a 4 poster bed, desk, flat screen tv, stereo system, DVD player with a selection of movies, table & chairs, bar area with bar stools, a sauna(!!) 2 large closets, and a lounge/work space area with a PC and printer.  The third level had another flat screen tv, table & chairs and a large whirlpool tub!  Simply amazing!!!!  On arrival, we were also treated to a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates!   There were also plenty of useful outlets to plug in phone, tablet, etc.  Free wi-fi was also available in the hotel.
Breakfast each morning was delicious and cooked to order!  The french toast was so good and my husband enjoyed the Irish Breakfast.  A cold buffet with yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, juice, etc. was also available. Newspapers were also available at breakfast.
The city bus stop is just outside the hotel, so it was no problem getting to the City Center or around Dublin. ",5,2016,06,02
222,Very nice place in a quiet area,"The hotel is a family run house, set in a quieter area of Dublin.  It's easy to get to city center, you can walk (20-30 minutes), or catch a bus right outside the front door, or DART (local train) is a short walk away.  Coming from Dublin airport, Aircoach drops off at schoolhouse hotel (less than 5 minutes walk).  They do have a car park (in the rear) if you're driving (honestly, if you're exploring Dublin, you don't need one if you stay here.  We stayed here a few days to explore Dublin then headed back to airport for a rental car to venture outside the city)

Be sure to explore the area, there are some good restaurants a short walk away,

We opted not to include breakfast, but then ended up eating breakfast there every day anyway.  The dining room is a nice, pleasant area.  The continental breakfast is very nice, with some cook to order options (the full irish here is very good).

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The only blemish on the service at all is that one day (out of 4), our room was cleaned, but the bed wasn't made.  All in all not a big deal, but they insisted on comping our breakfast the next day (the apology was enough, but it's nice to see how seriously they take their service).  The one real nicety here was that we had laundry and they took care of sending it out for us.  We just dropped it off at the front desk in the morning and they brought the cleaned and folded clothes to our room that evening (reasonably priced!)

As for accomodations, the jacuzzi bathtub was really nice, especially since we were walking all over Dublin every day.  The bed, however, was a little soft for my liking.  When we visited, it was unusually warm for Ireland and the room was really warm (difficult to sleep) and even with the window open, we couldn't cool the room down.

All in all a very nice place to stay.  It's away from the hub-bub of the city centre, but there's plenty to do in the area and easy to get around.  If we get back to Dublin, we'll be back.",4,2016,06,01
222,Nice stay,"The hotel is in the leafy lane area of Dublin, 15-20 minutes walk from the city, but buses pull up just outside. The rooms are clean and the bubbling bath is an added novelty. The breakfasts are well worth a try as they set you up for the day. The staff are polite and attentive.",4,2016,05,31
222,Very cosy,"It is a nice twenty-minute walk from the city centre, and the neighbourhood is safe and nice. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are big and clean (I appreciatte this very much). 
There were Euro plugs in the bedroom. We had the full Irish Breakfast and it was great but a bit expensive. 
The service of the staff is brilliant.",4,2016,05,26
222,Great townhouse,We stayed with a groep of friends in the luxury townhouse. Great comfortabel accomodation which was exceeding our expectations. Very friendly staff and not too far from the city centre. We can really recommand it!,5,2016,05,24
222,Made Welcome,Made to feel welcome by friendly receptionist. Nothing too much trouble and full of helpful information. Room a tad small but we were fine with that as we were only staying a couple of nights and had travelled light. Room was clean and comfortable. Handy location in a quiet part of the city. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2016,05,20
222,"Great location, friendly people",We arrived at midnight having flown from Milan and was pleased as to the comfort and quietness of room. The breakfasts were excellent and made to order with a variety to meet all tastes. The location was superb ( and weather cooperated) so we walked everywhere,5,2016,05,18
222,Nice room. Nice people. Nice part of town.,"Our room was on the bottom floor and was quite small (but I guess to be expected for European rooms in older hotels in big citied). We had free internet and the bed was comfortable and clean. The room was quite, except by 9 or 10 am on Sunday morning due to some city workers trimming the trees on the street outside. Hardly the fault of the hotel.

When we arrived, we were brought fresh tea and milk to our room. There is a small, gated parking lot in the rear of the building for our car. The location seems to be just outside the hustle and bustle of downtown Dublin, which was a 6 minute car ride away. We took a taxi to the center of town and paid 7 euro. Nearby I saw a few pubs and restaurants, I'd say all within 2-10 minute walk. 

For the price, it's a good place to stay and I'd stay here again.",4,2016,05,17
222,Perfect location perfect stay,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for 2 nights. We were greeted very warmly by Bianca; she was exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable. She directed us into Temple Square, which we walked to and had dinner then walked back. The next morning Lindsey greeted us with just as much warmth and kindness. She too gave us great instructions and information and she suggested a hop on hop off bus ticket, which we were able to buy from her at a discount. This was the best purchase for transportation in Dublin. It made getting around Dublin highly effective and economical. We had a car and Roxford lodge has secure parking (parking was free with our room) and we parked the car for the two days and didn't move until we left. We had two blissful nights of sleep. It was quiet and peaceful in the area; the bed was very comfortable and we found the room amazing in it's Georgian decor. Our room had a Jacuzzi, a sauna, a shower, and it's own kitchen, a bar and sitting room. It was amazing. We wished we had more time to stay at the Roxford lodge and Dublin.",5,2016,05,17
222,"Comfortable, but disappointed.","We stayed for three nights. We had made reservations but to our disappointment we had rooms behind the car park with no views.  We had chosen this property for its historical appeal and were disappointed we weren't in the main building. The breakfast was good and the people were welcoming and helpful  I would recommend this hotel, but I would make sure you request the part of the hotel you would like to stay in.

The rooms were very clean and modern, close to the bus stop and walking distance to the city center.",3,2016,05,15
222,Good value for money,"I stayed in the economy single room for one night. The room was quite small, but they managed to fit sauna in there. Furniture in this room was very, very old and walls very thin and I could hear my neighbors. There is only a few tables in the breakfast room, so guests were sat with other guests at the same table. Despite all of above, I felt comfortable in this hotel and I would recommend it. Good value for money.",4,2016,05,14
222,Perfect,"Just stayed here in May for one night with my husband. We were attending a concert in the three arena and it was so close. We walked to the concert, 20minutes walk. Got taxi home, only cost us €7! Great value for money. We didn't avail of the breakfast(personal choice) but regretted that when I started smelling the beautiful bacon as we checked out. Check in was so fast and easy less than 2minutes and we were shown to our room. Our room had a jacuzzi bath and a sauna (YES A SAUNA) but unfortunetely for me been 8months pregnant I couldn't use it :( will definitely be back just to try this out. Private car park at the rear of building was so handy to not have to go looking for street parking in Dublin. Rooms were spotlessly clean and ideal for our stay. DVD players and selection of dvd's in the room was also a nice added extra. Even though we were at the front of building and a bus stop right outside the gates, we didn't hear a noise all night. Checkout again was simple and fast, hassle free. Lovely friendly staff. 
Overall I was very happy with the location, the premises and the staff. Will reccomend to friends and family.",5,2016,05,11
222,Expensive - but you get what you pay for,"We stayed here both on the first and last nights of our road trip in Ireland.

We stayed in each of their ""Townhouses"" rather than the main hotel.

Quality furnishings and customer service throughout - including an exceptional breakfast.

All 5 of our party were very impressed.

Also, very good (and free) wifi

Couple of minor points (but not enough to lose a point on the ratings)

1.  The 200 Euro deposit we had to leave - we were not warned about this and guests should maybe be notified of this on booking (on the last night of our stay they waived it)
2.  It is very pricey - you can see where they have invested but maybe a price review would help?  We spent more on accommodation on this trip than we normally would and it definitely won't suit those on a budget

I would stay here again if the budget allowed!",5,2016,05,11
222,Nice hotel in Dublin,"I stayed three nights in total in the hotel, in two different rooms. On two nights I had a room at the back. That was great as it was very very quiet. Dublin is a very loud city I guess so I was amazed to have such a quiet room! Unfortunately the third night I got a room towards the street (not so quiet anymore...). But anyway, if you like to be a bit outside the big city (8 mins by bus) this is your choice! If I go back to Dublin, I would chose the same hotel (but only if they promise me to get a room at the back). Rooms are very clean, bathroom is nice and breakfast is good. Staff (with one exception) is very very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay.",4,2016,05,10
222,Perfect for our final nights in Ireland,"We stayed here at the end of a two week tour of Ireland and couldn't have asked for a better spot. It was close enough to city center to walk (10-15 minutes) but far enough that it felt very much like a lovely neighborhood away from the tourist center. The hotel staff was very hospitable, because we had originally planned on only staying one night then booked the second night fairly last minute we ended up changing rooms. The staff moved our bags and made sure everything was set. They gave us great recommendations on nearby restaurants. The rooms themselves were spotless and very well appointed including both tea pot and coffee maker. The beds were very, very comfortable.",5,2016,05,09
222,Town house stay,Myself and a group of friends stayed in a town house linked to the hotel. It was perfect. All the facilities you need and the beds were extremely comfortable. It's a 20 minute walk to the centre but lots of bars on the way. Taxis and buses are very reasonable. ,5,2016,05,08
222,spot on,"i have decided to book a room in that hotel as the reviews on tripadvisor were really good and the price reasonable. I arrived to Dublin pretty early so went straight to the hotel to ask if i can drop off my luggage and return to the city. That turned out not to be a hassle to the receptionist which was really nice of her. When i came back to the hotel after a few hours my luggage was already in a room. The hotel itself is really nice, located 15 minuts away from the city centre so theres no need for using public transport or cabs. The room that i booked was regular single so pretty small but clean and tidy, just enough for a solo traveller as I am. I really enjoyed the sauna. It takes a bit longer to heat it up than it says in instructions but apart from that everything works fine. After the first day the room and the toilet was properly cleaned by housekeeping and what is nice the body wash has been replaced even tho i havent used all. I cant really comment about the food as i was dining in the city. I really like trying new things but i may consider staying in this place again while visiting Dublin cos its a good quality for a money and worth giving a go. Highly recommended.
",5,2016,05,05
222,"Cozy room, lovely tea service, and... a sauna?","Nice cosy room with a sauna. I didn't get a chance to use it but it certainly is something that I've not seen other hotels offer. The sitting room downstairs was quite atmospheric, and I was given tea when I arrived which was a lovely touch after a long day traveling. 
It's not in the main hustle and bustle, so it's got a quiet peaceful feel, but it's near enough to things that it's convenient. It's also got nice restaurants nearby like the Chophouse and other nice pubs.",4,2016,05,04
222,Lovely,"The Rockford Lodge was a home away from home. I was a solo traveler and the staff was very helpful and did more than they needed to in helping me with directions, public transportation, organizing tours and making me tea. Nice location within  walking distance of St. Stephens Green (1.5 miles). Only reason did not get a 5 is need to up grade towels.",4,2016,05,02
222,Amazing overnight in town house,"We stayed here as a group on 10 for a birthday party, having travelled down from the north.  A welcoming, lovely place and friendly staff.  Townhouse was everything we could have imagined and more.  Gorgeous living area and bedrooms as well as small outdoor area.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,29
222,Possibly the best value in Dublin,"Have stayed at this hotel many times and really never think of going anywhere else in Dublin. The staff treat guests with care, consideration and courtesy. There is a free, secure car park at the rear. It is a short, 15 minute walk straight into Grafton Street and the city centre (passing Merrion Square and the National Gallery on the way) but there are bus stops at the front door. It is also ideally located for the RDS and Grand Canal Square. There is a DART station nearby. Free tea and coffee can be served in your room all day (if you want) as well as tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Wi-fi, sauna, tv, DVDs, iron, fax, phone and clock are there in your room as well as the en-suite. What more can you ask for? Oh,... the breakfast is really lovely! Very good value indeed.",5,2016,04,28
222,Great hotel in a very handy location,"I stayed in one of the new rooms built at the back of the carpark.  The room was very well appointed.  Jacuzzi tub, dry sauna, nice wide screen TV with DVD player and I really appreciated the Nespresso machine with a variety of coffees.  I had to be in Silicone docks and this was a great location.  Lastly the climate controls were a nice touch, so I could regulate the room temperature.  I would definitely recommend it.",5,2016,04,27
222,Lovely surprise close to Dublin centre,"What a lovely little hotel! Staff so welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
Decor was so tasteful respecting the old building, room decor still up to date, fresh and beautiful! Location quiet though so close to quite a busy main road. Safe easy parking on private car park. Room was indeed lovely with a fab coffee machine, which I really appreciate being a serious coffee drinker! Clean lovely room! Would have rated the top marks if had had a chance to try the breakfast, had to meet with daughter for breakfast somewhere else. Next time for sure!",4,2016,04,26
222,Very nice staff; okay-ish rooms,"The staff here is really lovely; everyone was friendly and helpful. The rooms, however, left much to be desired, and the decor was very outdated. It was also a bit too far from the city center. While the hotel is not terrible, I would recommend staying elsewhere.",3,2016,04,25
222,"Could not have asked for a better place to stay, made for the perfect vacation.","First off the customer service is fantastic here, making sure you are completely satisfied with your stay. What may seem like little details add up to an amazing experience. From tea and biscuits fireside in the sitting area, helping set up taxi service when needed, storing luggage before the room is ready, taking care of shipping of a large painting (including the difficult packaging), to opening the kitchen early to adapt to our flight, are just a few. Our favorite experience was the delicious morning breakfast cooked to order with funny and warm conversation with the staff, leaving you wanting for nothing more. Second, the hotel is immaculate. The owner takes great strides to make sure it is meticulously maintained and it shows. As for the location, it is in a beautiful, safe area that is walkable to the main areas. For the first time, we were not ready to come home from a trip. I think this is due to our stay here, where we felt like we were staying with family and treated as such. Such a treasure we were lucky to find.",5,2016,04,24
222,Very friendly staff,"Incredibly helpful friendly staff. I had a double room which wasn't big but it was very comfortable & clean. Good value for money. Great location, 10 minute walk to Aviva stadium. Would definitely use again.",4,2016,04,24
222,Quiet/Clean/Friendly,"Room 118 triple single beds with sauna facing backside of hotel,   much quieter and cleaner comparing to the other two hotels nearby. Although one of the heating element inside sauna cabin was broken and leaving black mark on the wooden cabin while heating up, the friendly staff was immediately apologizing to me while I informed her, and sharing with me the same concern about the potential fire hazard. She promised to get it fix immediately. That right attitude really counts when a customer reports defects in the hotel, not like another Alex---hotel keeps on excusing under renovation phase for over 1 year, and still nothing fixed or improved (See my previous stay). I definitely will stay at this hotel again and highly recommend to travelers, who need a good night sleep and are happy to walk 25 minutes to Grafton Street. ",4,2016,04,23
222,Friendly accommodating staff,"This hotel is really lovely, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, going out of their way to make you comfortable. I arrived early in the morning the day of my stay, and they allowed me to store my luggage, hang out in the lounge, gave me free coffee and biscuits and use the free wifi as I got my bearings in the city. They also had a full breakfast for 12 euro, which was really delicious. The single person room was very affordable and had both a jaccuzzi and sauna in it!! The hotel is in a beautiful residential area of the city, and is a very short walk to the more bustling/touristy parts of town. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to others.",5,2016,04,22
222,"Lovely staff, massive suite with excellent extras, like a full sauna and jacuzzi in room","Most notable is the lovely reception. The staff are brilliant. The suite was more an apartment on 3 partial levels with operational kitchen including an oven, full sauna and jacuzzi as well as balcony and separate office equipped with computer and printing facilities. The decor is not modern, but it a lovely space. It is in an excellent part of Dublin, within walking distance to the main tourist areas. This is excellent value for money",5,2016,04,21
222,Lovely little hotel at a good price,"Stayed here for a couple of days with my girlfriend for her birthday. The staff were lovely and helpful, the location was in a lovely area just a short distance from the more busier area of town with some really nice resteraunts nearby and finally the rooms were very nice, clean and definitely worth the price you pay! ",5,2016,04,21
222,Family Feel,"The Roxford Lodge Hotel was a great place to stay for parking, location, friendly staff, comfortable accommodations.  My daughter and I were served tea in the afternoon in our room.  We were able to walk to the shopping areas close by.",4,2016,04,18
222,Very relaxing and very good location.  Highly recommend!,"The Roxford lodge is a wonderful place to stay. I chose one of the smaller rooms and with the weather in Dublin being much colder than normal for this time of year, my room was warm and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They were very knowledgable with the area and were able to make suggestions on how to get to places and the best ways to get there. Oh, and the full Irish breakfast was very tasty!  I would highly recommend staying here at the Roxford.",5,2016,04,17
222,I was charged for their mistake,"I stayed in this hotel for one night while attending an educational course for my work that was held at Merrion Square. The room was small but clean and nicely decorated for the price and the hotel was in a good location for me. There was a small hole in the wall in my room that I took no notice of when I entered it. I was about to leave this hotel a good review, but during the second day of my course I was left a very rude voicemail from the hotel asking me to call back immediately. By the time I called back, I was greeted by a very apologetic member of staff. Apparently they thought that I had created the hole in the wall, so they took it upon themselves to charge me €500. They later found out that they had made a mistake and refunded the money. I am now €500 out of pocket while waiting for the refund and all I got in return was a weak apology. I assume that because I am a young male they thought I was the likely cause of the hole. The experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be staying in this hotel again.",2,2016,04,15
222,Great hotel near Central Dublin,"I was fortunate enough to spend one night at the Roxford Lodge when I visited Dublin in April. My room was clean, quiet, and perfect for a solo traveler. On top of that, the staff were very friendly, helpful, and professional. There is also a bus stop steps outside that made it very easy to travel all over the city. I fell in love with Dublin during my brief stay and I will definitely be back to the Roxford Lodge! Many thanks!",5,2016,04,12
222,Excellent,My girlfreind and i tayed in the executive sweet the room was great. It was raining outside so we just stayed in the room. The staff were excellent to especially caoimhe. thanks for everything we will be back 👍,5,2016,04,12
222,clean and comfortable,"Stayed for one night in a single room. Room was small but very clean and had lots of equipment and gadgets, which were not of interest to me but were probably useful for some.  Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the food. staff were pleasant and efficient",4,2016,04,11
222,One of the nicest hotels we have been in,"Maybe the nicest. I wish we had taken pictures of the room we had but then I doubt that any we took would do them justice. Let's start at the beginning. This building was originally a private home, a large one. Turning it into a hotel did not  allow for cookie cutter designs. Every room was different and had to be separately designed. This could easily have been a mess but was very well done. Beautifully done. The crowning touch was equipping each room with a Jacuzzi. Luxury. The service matched the property. Our regret was we had already booked and prepaid for the rest of our time in Dublin. Oh, I suppose I should mention location. It is not quite City Center but close enough.",5,2016,04,09
222,Comfy Accomodations in an Upscale Neighborhood,"We enjoyed a clean, comfortable room.  A bit removed from Dublin's downtown, but easily accessible by the city bus, which stops right in front.  Located in a very nice, upscale residential area, with some excellent dinner spots a short 10-min walk away. Excellent breakfast available in the quiet dining area.",4,2016,04,07
222,Lovely Stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights from 4th - 7th April. Originally booked the Arlington hotel at the O'Connell Bridge but had a change of heart when we found out how central it was to the night life. 
We were pleasantly surprised with The Roxford lodge, it is very much like a home from home. We have been treated like we were the only guests in the hotel, we found the staff to be helpful and polite and couldn't do enough for us during our stay. I can't comment on the breakfast as this isn't something which we had but the rooms are lovely, we had a Sauna and a Jacuzzi bath... can't complain at that and a huge bed. 
the sauna is a nice touch but not good if you don't like small spaces. 
There is a bus stop outside the hotel, again never used this but we did use the Yellow City Hop on Hop off buses which the stop is about 5 minutes up the road on foot directly outside the Ballsbridge hotel. The bus was 18 Euros each for 3 days travel and took you to all the major sites in Dublin. 
Taxi's from the airport to the hotel will set you back around 30 Euros depending on the traffic but you will find that the taxi back to the airport is cheaper if you book it direct with the hotel (25 Euro instead) 
Overall i would stay in this hotel again, if you want somewhere which is clean, friendly and a little out of the center it is the perfect hotel. However if you are looking for a lively hotel i would suggest somewhere in town. 
We would come back without a doubt.",5,2016,04,07
222,"Comfortable, but lacking modern amenities","The bed and room was comfortable, so that is a plus. Although, the TV was from the 80s in terms of reception of picture being poor, most stations were in German or Spanish, and the dubbing was off from the picture with some stations not working. Then I had a shower, with barely warm water, and the bath filled up due to the fixed plug not working properly, so I stood in the pool of cold water.",3,2016,04,07
222,A surprise haven.,"Had a very pleasurable 1 night stay in the Roxford Lodge Hotel, this hotel is a real find.. Staff are so welcoming & helpful. The rooms are nice, comfortable with every conceivable device to make your stay more enjoyable, DVDs player with plenty of cd,s, nespresso machine & a selection of coffees, & jacuzzi bath & to top it all a sauna in the bedroom. Breakfast was very nice & served by the very helpful 'Ban An Tí' My daughter was also allowed to delay her departure, without any problem. I would very much recommend this hotel for a lovely homely stay.",4,2016,04,04
222,One night stay last weekend,"lovely hotel, lovely breakfast, nice quiet area, extremely close to the Aviva Stadium.
Would stay here again if up in Dublin. up for a rugby match with friends, very handy for pubs restaurants as well. well located.",4,2016,04,04
222,"A very cosy, home-like and intimate experience","An excellent location when you're travelling to Google, Aviva Stadium and Ballsbridge Area (5min walking distance).

A very clean room, helpful staff, a very quiet location. Does not feel like a mass consumer hotel.

The Internet connection could be a bit faster.

Would definitely reccomend.",5,2016,03,30
222,We'll be back!,"Fab hotel, rooms have every amenity imaginable, short walk to the city centre, bus stop right outside the door, free secure parking, wonderful breakfast,  friendly & helpful staff. We will definitely be back :-) ",5,2016,03,29
222,Exceptionally clean,"Room was very confortable and had a lot more than a standard hotel room - personal coffee machine, DVD's and player, etc. Also very very clean. Bus is right across the door and or you can walk to center in 20 min.",5,2016,03,29
222,Fab homely stay in kitsch but homely place,"Great time at this fabulous and very personal, independent hotel.  Decor is stunning if you like things kitsch and retro - landscape wall paintings in the dining room, and we loved the 'accessories' in the room - a sauna (with built-in CD player), DVD player with 'action film' DVD selection (handy as the TV doesn't work) and fax machine for your business needs (?).  
Breakfast was epic (full Irish great, also the continental for lighter meal) and good priced alcohol in-room service.  
Staff v. friendly and gave us eggs for easter.  
Top tip: don't fill the jacuzzi bath with gel unless you want foam everywhere. 
The Nespresso coffee machine nice touch but didn't work in our room.  Other than that tip top service at a 25 min walk into centre of Dublin.",5,2016,03,28
222,Great Boutique Hotel,"Another very enjoyable visit to Roxford Lodge. Free parking. Stroll into city in 15min or bus across from hotel door - we did both. Rooms quite at night.  Breakfast of champions, even the continental breakfast was hugely filling. As a chap who likes his porridge I was delighted with what I got - made on milk too.  The breakfast room staff could not possibly have been nicer or in any way better attend to our needs. We wanted for nothing. Classy breakfast fruit salad too - freshly made with good quality fruit. Lot of recent decor upgrades so the place never looks tired. It is kept very clean as well. It is kept warm as a building but we had a thermostat in your room to control local setyings and you can open windows.  Free to watch DVD's in your room and - cleverly- wired with a choice of EU sockets too.",5,2016,03,28
222,Very comfortable stay,"Great guesthouse with really helpful staff and really comfortable beds. Room was fantastic and had so much more than a standard hotel room - such as personal coffee machine, DVD's, and not forgetting the SUANA!",4,2016,03,24
222,Fabulous Stay!,"Charming small hotel.  It is about a 20 minute walk to the city center, but there are cabs and a bus that are also available.  

The service is GREAT!!!  Breakfasts are delicious.  

We stayed in a triple and it worked great for a family of 3.",5,2016,03,23
222,Must Stay,In a recent trip to Dublin I found this hotel via another site.. I was a bit nervous but that had great ratings.  When I arrived I was amazed..  Nice old building with a lot of history and the staff was amazing.. always looking out for their American Guest making us feel right at home.  Starting every morning with a nice breakfast was a welcoming surprise and it made our longs days work!  I'd stay there again any time,5,2016,03,22
222,excellent stay,"stayed in the executive suite and it was really lovely.  Beautiful big bed, great facilities including a very nice Jacuzzi, kitchenette, balcony; very luxurious.  Was a bit pricey as did not include breakfast but well worth it.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,03,21
222,"Charming, Affordable and Great Service","This place had a lot of character and the staff was super helpful. I appreciated being able to check in and out in mere minutes, and assistance was immediate when I needed it. 

Big pluses are the in-room saunas, hot tubs and complimentary coffee. 

Only tip is to ensure the little things work smoothly. The kettle was a little touchy and the bathroom faucet was difficult to turn off. Again, just small stuff. 

Oh, and the wifi was great!",4,2016,03,18
222,Very nice boutique hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised by this boutique hotel just a few blocks from many important sites in Dublin. I booked an economy single room and it was much nicer than I expected. Although the room was rather small with a twin bed, it was lovely with lots of amenities including a jacuzzi tub that was great after long days of walking around the city.  Wifi worked well.  The room was very quiet. There are a few nice restaurants and pubs just around the corner, a bus stop right in front of the hotel, and an airport express bus stop just down the road. Despite the airport express bus, I decided to take a taxi to the airport using the hotel's special rate of only 25 euros. The hotel also has a lounge/business center where I was able to print my airplane boarding pass for free. 
I did not purchase breakfast so cannot comment on that option. I would highly recommend an economy single room to solo travelers except perhaps for very tall/large men. The room and hotel were much nicer than other Dublin hotels I've stayed at with similar rates (although breakfast was not included in my rate package).",4,2016,03,15
222,Couldn't be more helpful,"Booked for us as a Christmas gift, and what a great gift it was. The most helpful and considerate staff I've ever met, great location with an easy walk into the city. Can't wait to go back again. I can't recommend the hotel or staff enough. It really made our weekend.",5,2016,03,14
222,4 Bed House in Ballsbridge,"Booked for a group of 6. Very happy with the house, great facilities. We were grateful for all the unexpected supplies, cereals, bread, milk etc Also the staff at the Roxford were very helpful keeping our bags on our day of departure to save us trailing them around. We would love to stay again and fantastic location for the rugby!",5,2016,03,14
222,Comfortable hotel close to the city centre,"The Roxford was a wonderfully appointed hotel, with far more facilities in my room than I was expecting. It was very comfortable, and the staff were very friendly. My only complaints were that there did not seem to be wifi, and my room was unusually warm at times.",4,2016,03,14
222,Quick one night on business,A nice boutique hotel only 15 minutes walk from the Financial District and Grand Canal.  The décor was very nice in the hotel and room. Basically a converted house in a very nice part of London not far from the Aviva stadium as well.,5,2016,03,14
222,Lovely hotel with fantastic staff,We were looking for a hotel near the Bord Gais Theatre and found the Roxford Lodge on line. The theatre is a 15 min walk and the city centre is a nice 20 min walk. The airport bus stop is almost on the door step and there is a main bus stop right outside the front door so it is in a good location. Our room was very nice and it had a jacuzzi bath and a small balcony. The real bonus here was the service provided by every member of staff we came across. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them. We arrived pretty early and were expecting to leave our bags and go out for a while. However on arrival we were served with complimentary tea/biscuits while our room was made up and after 30 minutes we were able to book in. Breakfast is not included in the price but it is well worth the extra charge. We would definitely use the Roxford again,5,2016,03,13
222,Lovely Hotel in Dublin,"Really nice room, great staff- friendly and helpful.  Clean, safe,  and great accommodations.  Close to nice restaurants, a great place to stay a little outside the center of Dublin (20 min walk outside center).",5,2016,03,13
222,A great hotel with fabulous staff!,"We had a lovely stay in this hotel. We were down for the rugby and arrived before checkin. They were happy to keep our bags and let us check in that evening. Emails were responded to within half an hour prior to our stay and the staff could not have been more welcoming or accommodating. Caoimhe in particular was a great help!

The hotel is beautiful and the decor is ornate at times. Our standard room was spacious with a balcony, sauna and jacuzzi bath. Tea and biscuits were brought up for us on arrival. We thought the price was good value for money, although breakfast should have been included. 

The reason we didn't give 5 stars was that the main wall of the room was very scruffy, with lots of dirt and scrapes.  In saying that we both agree we would return next time we stay in Dublin.",4,2016,03,13
222,Astonishing!,"I took for the first time a ""solo, one bed, economic"" room at Roxford Lodge Hotel and it was beyond what I expected! Sauna, Jacuzzi, very clean, the floor is heated and the staff lovely. Only bad point is the breakfast, I've been told 7€ and I've been requested 12€, very expensive in my opinion. 320€ 4 nights and this quality is the best hotel in Ballsbridge for this price!",5,2016,03,11
222,A €90 room for €150...very poor value for money,"This hotel is ok, but only just ok.  Not sure why they charge as much as they do given where it is (middle of a suburban area) or what it is ( a 2-3 star accommodation). You can do much better for the price in Dublin. Best part was The Old Spot pub, some 5 blocks away.",2,2016,03,09
222,Weekend stay for work visit at trade show at the RDS,"Great Room, atmosphere, breakfast & staff. Will definitely be back. Lovely not to be a normal 'corporate' vacuum, thank you. One word of warning though, the Guiness at Paddy Cullens bar up the road is dangerous!",5,2016,03,07
222,Roxford Hotel,"Very good location, close to the RDS and also convenient to the city centre. the room was small but very comfortable, staff were very helpful and polite. there is very safe parking at the rear of the hotel. If you are going to a concert or an event in the RDS I would recommend this hotel",4,2016,03,06
222,"GREAT DEAL, EXCELLENT CHOICE","Stayed there for 4 nights with a group a friends (a party of 8) and the service provided by the owners and cleaning staff was simply spotless, efficient and very professional.
They even provided plenty of welcome essential groceries even not mentioned when booked, like various cereals packs, bread, juices and water.
The house was completely cleaned daily without any intrusion what so ever.
The temperature is always perfect and the entire house is very cozy and comfortable.
They have car park allotment in front of the house and the neighborhood is calm and quite. 10/15 mins walk from downtown with is perfect for a city trip
Thank you so much for your hospitality",5,2016,03,06
222,Good choice!,"The hotel has a good location about 20 mins walking to the trinity college and with the bus stop just in front the hotel.
The people are the reception were extremely nice.
Howeve,for a single room, I would not recommend to stay there,just too expensive.You can find alternative solutions,cheaper and more convenient.
",4,2016,03,06
222,Short stay at the Roxford,"Totally wonderful little hotel, cram packed with charm and with great, attentive service. Great clean comfy bedroom and the breakfast was absolutely delicious. 100% recommend anyone who wants a short stay in Dublin",5,2016,03,05
222,Excellent hotel and personal service,"Warm welcome from friendly and attentive staff, lovely tea and coffee served in front of a roaring log fire in lounge. Sauna, jacuzzi in room a nice surprise. Location quiet and only 15 min walk to centre. Free parking. Will definitely return next time in Dublin 10/10!",5,2016,03,05
222,"Cute little Boutique Hotel, Fantastic Service!","This is a lovely little hotel in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin. The hotel is clean and the room was nice and quiet. 

What impressed us the most was the service. The front desk girl that checked us in (young brunette with a pony tail) was so friendly and welcoming and helped us with many things; recommended restaurants in the local area, helped us with the return of our rental car, arranged a taxi for us the next morning to the airport, etc. But did it all with a sincerity and eagerness that is becoming more and more rare to find in service. Kudos to this young lady, as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 18 years I can attest finding an employee like this is not an easy feat. 

Overall the hotel is great value and I would recommend if you are looking to stay in the Ballsbridge area.",4,2016,03,01
222,clean and confortable,"Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. This hotel is located in front of the local bus stop, and also very close to anther stop of but to Dublin airport.  You can also easily walk to the city centre.  The staff was friendly and helpful, the tea was served in the lounge was warming and relaxing.  
Our room had also a router, so that the wifi connection was very strong and stable (free!).",5,2016,02,29
222,Couldn't rate it high enough....hated leaving!!,"We arrived early on the Friday evening before Valentine's not knowing what to expect, but when I got into the room we were really delighted. It was exactly what we wanted with the sauna and jacuzzi and the absolute comfort of the room. The minute we landed the staff were amazing and couldn't do enough. The little comforts of DVDs, nespresso and mini fridge-freezer were well appreciated. 
Would recommend to anyone👌🏽",5,2016,02,25
222,A lovely stay,"The hotel was great - the staff were very friendly and helpful.  We were able to check in early and then they happily looked after our luggage for the day once we had checked out, which was great. They also booked a taxi to the airport for us, which was incredibly helpful. The room was fine - very clean and the bed was huge and comfortable. Only gripes were that the room was very hot (we did turn down the thermostat but it took quite a while to adjust, we slept with the window open in the end) and also we couldn't get the jacuzzi bath to work (to be fair we didn't ask for assistance, and perhaps we just couldn't work it out!). All in all though, the location was great and in a really nice area. About half an hour's walk from the City centre through pleasant streets. Would recommend.",4,2016,02,22
222,Small hotel in quiet residential area yet close to the business district,"Stayed here one night for my beginning in Dublin.
The Hotel is not big but very well maintained.
I had a single room which was small but fully functional.
Sound proof was good compared to other residential B&B or hotels I experience in Dublin.",4,2016,02,21
222,simply amazing!!!,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, location is just stunning n not too far from the heart of it all.Absolutely immaculate.. Staff were extremely helpful thank you to everyone especially Caoimhe who was an absolute pleasure to meet.Will definitely be coming back and would recommend to anyone.",5,2016,02,20
222,"Yup, liked it.","Service was excellent, they couldn't do enough for you and really made you feel welcome. Pleasant, cosy room, clean and quiet. Bit outside the centre of town, but walkable to plenty of things to do. Would stay again!",5,2016,02,18
222,Lovely Hotel with Warm Welcome,"Stayed with the family (myself, wife and two youngsters) for a couple of nights while attending a 70th birthday party for close family friends who live in the area.

Everyone we met at the hotel, from the moment we arrived on Friday evening, was very warm and friendly and made us feel really welcome.  They were great with our kids, remembering names and engaging with them - fortunately they were behaving pretty well most of the time!

The family room we had was clean, well equipped and plenty big enough. Didn't use the sauna - tempted to use it as a ""naughty box"" for our son at one point - but plenty of tea, coffee, selection of DVDs and lots of towels.  I'm not a huge fan of wet-rooms, particularly when you have several people needing to use them one after the other, but it was a good size and dried pretty quickly.

Breakfasts were excellent - and much needed after some late nights.  Buffet selection of cereals, fruits, juices, etc, and cooked breakfasts to order.  Can't go wrong with a full Irish - especially the white pudding and some soda bread!

Can't be sure if/when we'll be back, as we will usually stay with our friends unless they have another house full.  But if we do need a place to stay, the Roxford Lodge will be our first port of call!",5,2016,02,15
222,Enjoyed our stay. Room was comfortable. Excellent tea and coffee making facilities. Staff were welcoming and very pleasa,"We have stayed in this hotel on a few occasions. Have always had a very comfortable room with decent tea and coffee making facilities. The breakfast is of a high standard.Staff are all very efficient, very friendly and make sure guests have a nice and comfortable stay in the hotel.",5,2016,02,15
222,Great Hotel close to everything in Dublin,"This was a great hotel - excellent attentive staff, very clean and close to all amenities.  Nothing was a problem and especially was appreciative of the coffee/tea on arrival after a long and wet journey.  
I would go back again but would opt for a superior room as the standard was quite small compared to other hotels we have stayed in Dublin.  That said we didn't come to stay in the room all the time and suited grand for a short break.",4,2016,02,15
222,A Warm Welcome,"Booked this hotel for a valentine's weekend. Very welcoming atmosphere with a log fire burning in  the lounge and a complimentary cup of coffee. Very well equipped room with two TVs , wi-fi and Jacuzzi. All very clean, and good breakfast as well. About 20-30 minutes walk into town, If that's too much there's a frequent bus service (including a direct service to the airport) a short walk from the front door",5,2016,02,15
222,Aviva heaven,"We stayed at Roxford Lodge for the rugby, which was a 5 minute walk to aviva stadium, lovely hotel very clean excellent staff,and very helpful, enjoyed our chats with Katie who was very proffessional as with all other staff,lovely Irish breakfast served by lovely Agnes who ensured we didn't want for anything. Nothing was too much trouble at this hotel and a bus stop directly outside, we enjoyed the short walk to local bars and restaurants and approximately 30 minutes leisurely stroll to temple bar area. Thankyou all for looking after us and will be returning for the rugby in 2018 to be sure, to be sure .SUPERB.",5,2016,02,14
222,"Nice Hotel, Lovely staff","The room was a little small, but big enough for 1 person for 1night, The bathroom was lovely and the staff were really nice, lovely pub/restaurant 5 minutes away, the hotel is close to the city centre and has a secure car park.",4,2016,02,12
222,Great hotel for a short stay,"A group of 6 of us stayed here for a short trip to Dublin. We weren't actually in the main part of the hotel but we were in a house close by run by them. We were checked in and shown to the house by a helpful man called Des who gave us a quick tour and list of useful numbers; out of hours contact, taxi, WiFi code etc. The kitchen was well stocked with treats, biscuits, chocolates, coffee machine and all the usual appliances so we could make our own meals.
We had 1 master bathroom and 1 en suite bathroom with 3 bedrooms so there was plenty of space for 6 of us. The bedrooms were small but clean and adequate for a couple of nights. The living area was large enough to seat 6 comfortably and included a TV with sky channels.
Overall the accommodation was of a high standard, clean and modern. I would stay here again if I came with a group of friends.",4,2016,02,10
222,Cozy and luxurious at the same time.,This was our first night in Ireland. This place is not right in the downtown/city center but was a comfortable distance (taxi/walking). We did both walking and taxi. The room adn bathroom is very clean but a little tight. The tightness did not ruin it for us however...it made it cozy honestly. The bathtub/jaccuzi style was very relaxing. Love the options of movies. Front desk was always friendly and available for anything. They were extra nice to us when they saw how pooped we were from our rough flights to Ireland. Breakfast was delicious - simple and perfect. Great place to stay!,5,2016,02,09
222,First visit to Dublin.,"First time in Dublin for the Six nations against Wales, didnt know what to expect from hotel but knew I wanted to stay near Aviva Stadium so came across Roxford lodge on line, good choice on my part, room small but had everything I needed and clean and tidy. Lovely bathroom with jacuzzi, sauna in the bedroom (differant), staff lovely and friendly, especially Katie on reception who sorted me out with reservation for local restaurant. The breakfast was fantastic, loads of choice, something for everyone, I stuck with full irish. Lovely lounge with log fire where you can sit and read and drink tea, computer and printer in lounge, handy for printing boarding passes for homeward journey, hope to bring family here in near future.",4,2016,02,08
222,"Great location, lovely staff - shame about the room.","Stayed at Roxford Lodge on Friday, 5/2/2016.  Location is excellent as it is within easy access to all things Dublin.  The staff are extremely helpful and pleasant.  The breakfast is superb.  So to get to the core of my average rating.  I had requested a room on ground floor in an earlier email - explaining that my friend suffers from rheumatoid arthritis.  Roxford Lodge responded and helpfully told  us that we would be allocated a room near the lift.  What they didn't tell us was, that although accessible because of the lift, the room was barely big enough for one person.  We are two middle aged ladies and having to squeeze past each other to tiny bathroom, bed and door was not only an inconvenience but added to my friend's pain.  

All in all it was a positive experience but the room detracted from everything as it was actually claustrophobic for us to stay there.  I also found the wifi very haphazard although free, it kept going off.",3,2016,02,07
222,Lovely stay,"Very pleasant stay, quiet and clean room and bathroom, helpful and friendly staff managed by Lynnsie. Easy access to the city center and professional areas. 
Thank you, we'll really love to come back again!",5,2016,02,06
222,Absolutely lovely.,I have stayed here before and wouldn't hesitate coming back again and again. I'm over for business and it is so convenient for everything - the bus stops right outside the front door! The welcome is always really friendly and helpful The rooms are really well presented and some have hidden delights of a sauna and a jacuzzi. I haven't had the luxury yet but fellow travellers have and said it was brilliant.  The full Irish breakfast is wonderful and sets you up for the day.  Really looking forward to going back again soon.,5,2016,02,03
222,Try their Executive Suite,"Sauna, 3-person jacuzzi, bathe, four pillar bed, working desk, computer, balcony, kitchen, coffee machine and even breakfast, all in your room. This is so much better than staying in some four or even five star hotels where you pay through your noses and not get all these facilities.

I been there twice and would really love to go back again if I'm going to Dublin for holiday.

P.S. The owner provides a bottle of wine and a box of chocolate for free too",5,2016,02,02
222,Beautiful building,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge in April 2015.

We had requested a room with a balcony however were given a room without. We were swiftly changed after complaining which was good however the word balcony is a little farfetched! It was a rickety plank of wood essentially. The room was very tired and the bath flooded. Our original room was much more beautiful however we can't have too many complaints as we had requested the balcony and made a fuss to change our room. The bed was smaller in our second room too.

Breakfast was served downstairs and felt a little awkward but nice enough. 

The reception staff were very nice and recommended a lovely restaurant to visit nearby.

In summary, nice. But not quite boutique.",3,2016,01,29
222,Roxford Lodge,"This was our second time to stay here,we stayed for three nights when on business in Dublin . Could not fault accomodation or staff .Great location with secure free parking, looking forward to our next visit.",4,2016,01,27
222,Midweek night away,"Was going to a show in Dublin and booked into this hotel. Great spot within walking distance of the city centre. Nice room. Spotlessly clean. Friendly helpful staff. Fab breakfast! Will definitely go back, Highly recommend it.",5,2016,01,27
222,Fantastic hotel,Staff were very helpful throughout the stay. Room was lovely with lots of extras such as the sauna and DVDs to watch. Was quite a walk from the city (about 20mins) but bus is right outside if You don't fancy the walk.Would recommend for people to stay!,5,2016,01,27
222,a nice week-end,"once arrived we felt like if we were at home, we get a very pleasant welcome and we were given a cup of tea in a warm room with a chimney (despite we were too early). The room was spacious, comfortable, well equipped and so calm. We were not so far from the city center (near 15 min on foot). All the crew was lovely and nice for french people like us. It was a really nice stay for two nights/three days.",5,2016,01,26
222,Executive Suite Treat :),My partner and I decided to treat ourselves to a night in the executive suite in this hotel. We had been looking forward to the night away for ages and we were not disappointed! The room was amazing and so classy. The staff were so nice and helpful. Cant wait to go back and would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,01,25
222,Lovely Hotel,"Great location, staff very helpful and friendly. Bed very comfortable and room was a  good size. Parking at rear was very useful. Nice touch leaving the DVDs by the TV to watch. Really nice pubs and restaurants local to the Hotel.",5,2016,01,25
222,Ideal midweek bolt-hole,"Stayed for one night. Handy for Grand Canal offices. Well appointed, spacious and comfortable rooms. Very friendly and helpful team. Spot on and expect Roxford Lodge to become my regular midweek accommodation!...........................",5,2016,01,21
222,Great!,"Located in the center. Very attentive and helpful staff. Nice rooms, although we had an Economy Room seemed like a Superior Double! The only snag  is that receptionists weren’t at the front desk all the time, and sometimes we had small doubts that couldn’t be solved right away. However everything else was great, we really recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2016,01,19
222,Nice little hotel,"Nice little hotel. Friendly, helpful staff, clean with some luxurious and artistic touches. Well located. But the operative word is little. Our room would have been nice for one person- but very tight for two, with luggage. Also, a sauna was presented as an amenity,  but 'available' would have been a better word. There were some in some of thr rooms, apparently, but it wasn't a general amenity  for guests. A little misleading, we thought, but perhaps this is just a cultural misscommunication . 
I think this is a lovely place to stay, as a single, or perhaps in a larger room, but even so, not bad for the price.",3,2016,01,15
222,Excellent,"Just got back from a 3 night stay excellent hotel fabulous facilities jacuzzi bath DVD player and selection of DVDs coffee machine and a speaker docking station in our room the staff where all very helpful and friendly room cleaned to a high standard clean towels every day great location with bus stop just outside the hotel however still only a 20 minute walk into the centre wonderful stay 
We got the airport shuttle bus to and from the hotel we found out later it's much cheaper if you book a return journey online ",5,2016,01,05
222,Great hotel,Roxford lodge was a great place to stay. Friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable and clean with a homely atmosphere to the lodge. Great location as it was within walking distance to the centre of the city. Easy access to buses and taxi's,4,2016,01,03
222,Do I really want to share this?,"Have you ever found something really special and you dont weant the whole world to get their hands on it? Well thats the Roxford Lodge Hotel !
We stay in a lot of Hotels and B&Bs throughout Ireland and most are good but this 
""little Gem"" as someone else described it , is VERY special.
Its a beautiful old house set in a very nice area of Dublin - with good access to public transport and taxis - the City Centre is 10 mins away by taxi. 
The hotel has a lift - which is excellent for those with restricted mobility.
The room we had 114 was lovely - large - lovely bathroom and a large window, ok the view was over their small car park but that didnt matter as secure  - FREE- car parking was another big plus for us as in Dublin this is at a premium.   Add  free Wi-Fi that worked - no password to faf about with,  just free access -  a safe and a small bar and the room had everything we needed.
But the breakfast - well I challenge anyone to have the Full  Irish Breakfast and eat again at lunch time - Not possible - its the best breakfast we have encountered so far and the staff are friendly and interested in ther guests - something you WONT find in a chain of hotels.  Keep up the good work Roxford House - we have booked to stay again in February this time with our In Laws - so impressed were we with your hotel.",5,2015,12,30
222,Weekend Christmas shopping,"This hotel is perfect, in every way! The service (reception) is brilliant, friendly and do everything to help you out. The busstop in front of the hotel is also great! The busses come frequently and the costs are low. And then the room (115), also a 10 on the scale. Spacious and clean. We are often in the lounchroom, near the fireplace. It really feels like home...",5,2015,12,19
222,A little Gem in the heart of Dublin,"Found this for a night to stay over for the U2 concerts. Managed to get a room and although the room was not the biggest it was so well thought out and packed full of facilities I was a little taken aback.
Staff were very courteous and friendly. Breakfast was delicious and I would recommend it highly.
We will definitely be making this our ""go to"" hotel when staying over in Dublin.",5,2015,12,13
222,Luxury and spacious accommodations,"Just chanced upon this excellent hotel on Expedia for our last night in Ireland. Parking was a little,difficult to find as it is not well marked but the townhouse that we stayed in had 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, sitting room and patio. More than enough room for the 4 of us. Cab ride or 40 minute walk to city center for night life. We would definitely stay here again. Very friendly staff.",5,2015,11,17
222,Short break and to watch SLF at the Academy,We chose Roxford for the location and its style ..turned out to be fantastic choice ..we had a sauna actually in the room..a jacuzzi bath ...a gorgeous lounge to sit in behind reception and really helpful staff ...the breakfast has lots of choice and is delicious ...there are bus stops in to Dublin right outside and also the City Scape bus picks up 5 mins away which goes round Dublin for only 10 euros you can hop off and on  - perfect !!!! Highly Recommended,5,2015,11,15
222,Excellent!,We stayed one night only and we loved it. Staff is great and extremely nice and helpful. The room was clean and cozy. A wonderful place to stay! We intend to stay there again when we go to Dublin next time. Thanks a mil for the wonderful stay!,5,2015,11,10
222,Outstanding. ,What a wonderful place to stay. Beautiful rooms. Private car park.  Really good breakfast. The staff were probably the most friendly and helpful I have ever met in any hotel in dublin. Stayed here while we attended the graduations in the RDS. Definitely look forward to staying in the Roxford Lodge in the future.,5,2015,11,09
222,Great place,Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of a week in Dublin. The staff gave a great welcome. Our room was in the 'new wing' which upon arrival does look like a converted garage or out building. I almost asked for another room before I saw ours (136) but when I saw it was glad I hadn't. It was beautiful and spacious. It has everything you need in a room from safe to coffee machine to DVD player with a selection of DVDs. First time I have ever had a sauna in the ensuite too. Also apart from the shower there was a separate jacuzzi bath. All in all the room was great. Breakfast was wholesome and nothing was too much trouble. There are a selection of really nice restaurants within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin. ,5,2015,11,08
222,Lovely stay,"We arrived at least 2 hours before check in and the staff were so helpful put our luggage in our room for us despite being soaking wet. Offered us tea and coffee and were generally lovely. 

When we arrived a lady was being very rude to the receptionist because her card had been charged by her booking company (nothing to do with the hotel). The receptionist was very professional and polite to someone being very unreasonable. Please read the terms of booking if you don't go to the hotel direct.

The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The bed in our room was massive with excellent quality bedding. 

Lots of free tea/coffee.

I would happily recommend to anyone and thought it was great value for money.

Please check your bus connections to the airport as we got inaccurate info from the airport and ended up walking 2miles! There is a bus that drops off about 500 yards away.

Quiet and pretty area. Nice local restaurants and bars. May be a little out of the way for some and steps up to the front may not suit everyone. 

Wouldn't hesitate to return.

Thank you to all the lovely staff.",4,2015,11,02
222,Comfortable hotel with good service,"The hotel is very comfortable. We had a lovely family room which was of a very high standard, modern and clean. The hotel is outside the main city centre but is walkable (20-30 min walk) and 1 of the hop on hop off buses stops close by.
The staff were welcoming and helpful. Getting luggage up the front stairs was awkward - however I think if we had gone to the car park behind that there may have been a lift from that level. Breakfast was ok but nothing special.",4,2015,10,31
222,welcoming experience,"excellent service the minute we arrived
arrived 11.30 put luggage in to reception
and to be told our room is ready but had 
plans to go out very friendly staff, great location
15 mins from city centre hotel set in a quiet 
location so ideal",5,2015,10,29
222,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed here last night for the bank holiday weekend, first time to this hotel such a nice experience the rooms were lovey the sauna in the rooms is a very cool idea. Really liked this hotel would defo recommend it and very easy to get in and out of taxis to city centre. ",5,2015,10,25
222,Fantastic and Welcoming ,"Arrived after a long day and lots of travel to be greeted and shown to my single room. Absolutely perfect. . All mod cons and a jacuzzi bath. .  Lovely staff  couldn't do enough to help. 
Convenient location for tourists and very charming area. 
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. 

Secure parking at the back and they even move your car for you if need be. As car park quite small and you may block someone in. ",5,2015,10,22
222,Welcoming experience,"We stayed here just one night but enjoyed it thoroughly. We arrived at 5:30 a.m. and even though check-in was several hours later, the owner made us a pot of coffee and biscuits so we could plan our day in Dublin.  The breakfast the next morning was great (there is a charge).  Wonderful oatmeal and soda bread.",4,2015,10,20
222,Quaint little Georgian in Dublin,Stayed here for one night in October 2015 and after staying in larger hotels this was a nice change! Beautiful quiet leafy street and gorgeous gardens as you enter this very cute Georgian building. Room was a bit of a maze to get to but it was a sweet room with lots of rustic charm. Loved the bathroom with jacuzzi and heated towel rail (YAY!) The balcony was very nice for some fresh air and even had a surprise Irish kitty visitor in the evening lol! Not completely central but bus stop out front takes you right into Dublin. ,4,2015,10,20
222,Truly Remarkable Service!,"My husband and I are avid travelers, and we can honestly say that our stay at the Roxford Lodge was the most positive lodging experience we have ever encountered. Everything you typically hope for in a hotel was ideal at the Roxford Lodge - the location was picturesque and within walking distance of downtown, the room was clean and comfortably outfitted, even with extra amenities like a jetted tub, and there was ample free parking on site in a secure gated area. What made our stay even more memorable and wonderful, however, was the exemplary and truly caring service we received. Even though we arrived at 2am after a harrowing day of delayed flights, we were greeted warmly and made to feel at home right away. In the morning, I discovered my husband's cold symptoms had worsened into a full blown illness overnight, and ventured to the reception desk unsure of what even to do next since I had always been fortunate in good health on previous trips abroad. I was greeted warmly and compassionately by Stephanie, who immediately offered to call the doctors office just down the street and arranged an appointment for my husband within the hour!! She then made sure I knew where the nearest chemist's shop was located so we could pick up the prescriptions my husband needed after his doctors appointment. I then mentioned in passing that we had lost our luggage on the previous day's journey, while simply asking if I could make an outside call from our room, and Stephanie immediately came to our rescue again and offered to contact the airline for us while we were out at the doctors appointment. Sure enough, when we returned at the end of the day Stephanie had successfully procured one of our two pieces of luggage. The next morning we were greeted warmly at the reception desk by Lindsay, who, once again without even being asked, immediately took up our cause and volunteered to call the airline on our behalf throughout the day. Thanks to Stephanie and Lindsay's exceptional efforts, which went far above and beyond even the highest standards for customer service, all of our missing luggage was returned, and what could have been a very challenging start to our vacation became a remarkably positive experience. Thank you Stephanie and Lindsay of the Roxford Lodge for taking care of us with such genuine warmth and kindness!",5,2015,10,14
222,Perfect introduction to Dublin,My sister and I were very pleased with our stay at the Roxford Lodge.  We had a twin bed room in the new section and were impressed with the entire set-up.  We had no problem with the fact it backs up to a road as we heard very little street traffic noise.  Although it is not in the heart of Dublin there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance and we enjoyed walking down tree-lined sidewalks to restaurants.  The bathroom was well lit and the shower was excellent.  A delicious breakfast was the perfect compliment to our stay at the Roxford.,5,2015,10,07
222,Not quite as advertised,"The Staff was quite friendly and the main building was nice unfortunately we were guided to their ""new wing"" which was out back past the secured parking in what looked like a converted garage.  The interior was new although pretty small. It backed up to an alley way so there was a lot of street noise.  I was just disappointed because this was the one place, during our two week stay, that I pre-booked several months in advance.",3,2015,10,01
222,"Good location, secure off-street parking, 15 minute easy walk to Temple Bar","The staff were very pleasant and couldn't have been more helpful. The room was nicely presented and spotless. Complimentary cups of tea and coffee and biscuits were brought up to the room on arrival. The soundproofing was great: even though we were overlooking the road, couldn't hear a thing. The full Irish breakfast was delish! The room was rather cramped - not sure about the need for a sauna taking up space, maybe that's a European thing?",5,2015,09,30
222,Great Location,"Hotel is in great location close to city food outlets of all sorts close by and bus stop out front into city bus stop to and from airport 100mters away , the hotel is well run with helpful staff is clean and with good breakfast we stayed 6 nights would certainly stay again ",5,2015,09,27
222,Very nice little Hotel,"Very nice, small hotel with a B&B feel, located on an arterial, tree-lined street south of town.  Convenient, easy walking distance to town, or take bus at stop in front.  Quiet and peaceful place.  Parking in back.  Rooms modern and clean.  Staff very warm and helpful.  Breakfast nice, or eat in town.  Reasonably priced quality for big city.  Would stay here again.",4,2015,09,26
222,Very kind staff,"When we arrived they offered us a fresh pot of tea and was delivered to us shortly after we settled in with some nice biscuits.

The rooms were nicely decorated and very cute.

Breakfast was well set up and the attendant was very polite.",5,2015,09,25
222,Nice for a short stay.,"The Roxford Lodge is a good option for a short stay - we stayed 3 nights. The people were very nice and the breakfasts were great.  Our room was clean and fairly comfortable.  The only drawbacks were that the room as a bit small and it was about a 20 minute walk into central Dublin.  Of course that's why the rates are at least 80 Euro cheaper than the more centrally located hotels.  It's more quiet too.  If you don't mind a bit of walking or taking the bus/taxi into town, consider the Roxford.",4,2015,09,24
222,Short trip to Dublin,"I stayed 2 nights at the Roxford, having chosen the hotel due to its closeness to the Aviva Stadium (10 minutes walk). It turned out to be a great choice. 
The personnel was friendly and the room cosy and nice. The neighborhood is safe and within walking distance from the central area.",5,2015,09,23
222,Pleasant stay,"We arrived in wet miserable weather but that didn't stop the pleasant staff at the hotel giving us a warm welcome. 
We arrived a few minutes after 2pm and our room wasn't fully ready, it was Sunday and they said they had a few late check outs. The room was going to be an hour which was not a problem, the lady at reception checked us in and gave us the option to sit in the lounge and wait or we could go out if we had planned. We decided to sit an wait especially after the ferry crossing 😷. The lady provided refreshments and biscuits whilst we waited. Shown to the room, well suite I should say. Although the view was nothing special just a car park (they have a free secure car park on site) and houses it had everything we needed and much more. We didn't plan on spending much time in the room. It had the usual plus a huge king size comfy bed, sauna and jacuzzi bath. The room was very clean and tidy at eyes glance, I can't say I go around looking for dust 😂. Slept really well, no noise or lumps and bumps in the bed. Unable to comment on the food as we decided not to have breakfast but you can get breakfast and evening meal. House keeping everyday, no issues with this. 
Plenty of places to eat near by plus only a 15 minute walk to the centre. Although we opted for a hop on/hop off bus tour which took us to all the places we planned and dropped us not to far from the hotel. Overall great experience. Would come again.",5,2015,09,15
222,Wonderful!!!,"Wonderful room- family room with comfy beds, lot of space, clean and luxurious(but was well priced). Loved the jacuzzi tub, balcony and sauna. Very nice breakfast. Wonderful staff and a lovely offer of tea/coffee and biscuits in the room. Fantasic location!",5,2015,09,13
222,A warm welcome ,The team here are excellent very helpful and happy to help with ideas and advise. We had a twin room for our minibreak which was clean and comfortable. My mum is in her 70's and enjoyed the full irish breakfast before our sightseeing. Well served by buses and lots of places to eat within walking distance. An easy walk to the aviva stadium.,4,2015,09,12
222,Good location and spa facilities,"Good location in Dublin,with private parking which was very important.Small rooms but with various spa options and comfortable beds.Breakfast- various options.Very nice and helpful staff.certainly good if you have to stay close to the city.",4,2015,08,29
222,Great staff,"Wonderful location, clean and very comfortable. Even had jacuzzi bath in an economy single!!! Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Very secure parking and only 10 min walk to grafton street or Trinity. Will definitely be back!",5,2015,08,19
222,Bit of a hike,"The hotel is conveniently located just a short 15-20 minute walk to Trinity College. We were put in rooms separate from the main hotel at the back of the parking lot. At 6am there is plenty of hot water, but after 8am the water is tepid at best and there is not enough pressure to make the shower work. That said the room was newly renovated and very clean. It comes with a flat screen TV, DVD player and a free selection of DVDs to choose from. In room coffee is available each day.",3,2015,08,17
222,Excellent hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights in this beautiful hotel. Rooms were airy, spotlessly clean and furnished to a high standard. Staff were helpful and it was a nice bonus that they would serve you complimentary tea and coffee with biscuits at any time either in the lounge or in your room. Breakfast was excellent, great choice and plenty of it! Enjoyed the Jacuzzi bath, particularly after a day of walking around the city. Great choice for those who enjoy things a little quieter as it is not in the centre of the city. Only thing I would change was the size of the bath towels (too small!).",5,2015,08,09
222,Quaint accommodation,"Our room in this lovely little B&B was very nice and clean, though small. The bathroom was clean, with a bath, but again awkward because of its size. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. Parking was around the back and hard to find. The lady serving our breakfast was so nice !  Breakfast was ample and delicious....no dinners are available. All in all a nice B&B but remember its a small quaint B&B....not a big hotel in any way.",4,2015,08,03
222,Would like to rate this 4 and a 1/2,"My husband and I struggled with this one. Some really nice touches, such as tea and coffee brought to you in the lounge or your room at any time, loads of DVDs available, spa in the rooms, lovely fresh fruit salad each morning, but then there were some faults too, our toilet paper wasn't  replaced the second day, no advice or map offered when we checked in. 
Overall, the staff was great, both in the reception desk and the breakfast room. Phone calls were made ordering taxis for us, making dinner reservations and organising laundry. 
Bearing in mind it is only a 3 star hotel, we were very happy. ",4,2015,08,01
222,Excellent base for exploring the city,I and my wife stayed at the Roxford Lodge for three nights from 27th June to the 30th.  A great hotel and base for exploring Dublin situated in a very pleasant quiet area to the south east of the city.  It's an easy walk to the city centre (about 15-20 mins) with lovely walks by the Grand Canal on the doorstep. The reception staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Our room was well equipped and had everything we needed (and some things we didn't use like the sauna and jacuzzi!. It wasn't large but was perfectly acceptable and very comfortable.Recommended.,5,2015,07,24
222,"Great ambience, fantastic service","A fabulous little hotel for those looking for old-world ambience and old-fashioned friendly service but without compromising wi-fi era convenience. We stayed twice. Both rooms were spotless and quiet - our room on busy(ish) Northumberland Rd was double-glazed and we couldn't even hear the traffic. Breakfast was excellent, with a wide choice. All the staff were friendly and proactively sought to add value to our experience. Even when we returned to wait for our airport bus, long after checking out, we were served tea/coffee and biscuits in the lounge room. We could not recommend Roxford too highly and would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,07,23
222,Great hotel in a quiet area of Dublin,"This hotel is great. The receptionist Stephanie Kennedy was very helpful to us. The rooms are small, but it's to be expected anymore in Europe. Our room is quiet, and we like that it's a 20 minute walk from Dublin city centre as it's much quieter than downtown Dublin. Very nice suburban area of Dublin but little tip…dress warm and bring an umbrella. It is about 10 degrees on July 20th 2015 and the wind can be very cold. Thank you Roxford Lodge Hotel for your kind hospitality :)",5,2015,07,20
222,Wonderful staff but location is a problem,"On the positive side our room was spotless, comfortable and roomy,  The desk staff is very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to meet our requests.  It is a quick walk to pubs, restaurants and grocery store.  However, despite the reviews praising the location this is in a suburban neighborhood with long walks even to get to the Hop on Hop Off bus stops.  Given the weather (even in July it was cold and wet) walking long distances to get to town is not appealing.  Be aware that you should be in good shape for walking in not very pleasant weather to get to favorite tourist areas if you decide on this facility.",4,2015,07,15
222,Excellent location!,"This was a tough one to write. The location was perfect for exploring Dublin, lots of wonderful restaurants within easy walking.  The staff was helpful and knowledgable.
The back rooms are quiet at night.  The water pressure was great, plenty of hot and in room jacuzzis. The beds are the worst we have ever slept on.  Looked at 3 rooms, all of the mattresses sloped to the center.  Heard other customers complaining at check out, about the same issue. Mattresses need to be replaced especially in a high volume commercial establishment.",4,2015,07,09
222,"Great Location, great Breakfast","I was a little unsure about this selection, the reviews were good, the price very reasonable. We opted to take a cab from the airport (35 Euro) after being awake almost 24 hours, getting a rental and starting to drive on the other side of the road did not seem prudent. The driver dropped us off at the Front gate (As close as you can get to the front). Parking in the rear. I have to say I was I was very pleased. The front desk allowed us to drop our luggage at 8:00 am and delivered it to our room when it was ready. We took a short walk (15 min) into the historic district, and spent the rest of the day. The Room was very nice and clean and vintage to match the exterior. Our room was in the rear not much of a view but quiet. If we return to Dublin, will stay there again. The Breakfast was great (Full Irish), maybe the best I had on the trip. Everyone was pleasant and helpful.",4,2015,07,07
222,A great place to stay,"A very nice B&B just a mile walk from the downtown crowds.  Rooms were very comfy and clean, staff were outstanding.  Breakfast and hostess were excellent.  A short walk around the corner for several pubs for eats and drinks, public transportation of bus and taxis right out front.  Reasonable fair pricing and very helpful front desk staff.  Not all the amenities of the large noisy crowded hotels downtown, but charming and comfortable.  Highly recommended.  And Thank you to all the great folks at Roxford Lodge for an awesome visit.",5,2015,07,06
222,Nice B&B with friendly staff,We are on a 2 week vacation in Ireland and chose to stay here when we first arrived. It's a nice place and a good location. I loved the high ceilings in our room and it was very comfortable. Breakfast was delicious and so much food that we weren't hungry until dinner. It's in a nice neighborhood and within walking distance to all of the sights in central Dublin.,4,2015,07,04
222,Nice spotless centrally located hotel,"Roxford Lodge Hotel is an excellent, stylish place to stay. The staff are very helpful, friendly, & well versed in excellent customer service. Cleanliness was impressive, as the hotel was spotless. 
The location is perfect within 10 minutes of the City centre, Ranelagh, & Donnybrook, & bus stops for both sides of the road outside the hotel's front door.
There is a lovely, relaxing lounge and the breakfast is tasty & sumptuous with a great variety of choice.
Our room was well maintained & pleasant but a bit on the small side. An automatic sensor light comes on at night when going to the toilet, which is a great comfort, but it also comes on during the day, which is a bit of a nuisance. The double glazed windows are also a nice touch.
I would definitely rate this hotel very highly, but I would be slightly critical of having to pay extra for breakfast, which should always be inclusive in the original price. Overall, a really good hotel.
",4,2015,07,02
222,Hidden Gem in a great city,"This is a great hotel with a historic feel.  The neighborhood is very pretty with public transit stopping just outside the hotel.  The building is beautiful inside and outside.  Our room was fantastic.  Large bed, great bathroom and even a sauna in the room!  All of the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  The only negative to this hotel is it is a little distance from more of the popular tourist sights (about 30 min walk).  If you take the bus or don't mind walking it's not an issue.  Breakfast in the hotel is good but I'd recommend eating out, there are better options throughout the town. Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,06,27
222,Sauna in room,"I had the single economy room.  It was very small and had a sauna box located in the room.  The drinking tap on the bathroom did not work for the majority of my stay and the shower leaked over the floor.  The room did not have air conditioning and it was quite warm. Reception staff are helpful particularly the one that provided me with a small fan to use. The room was clean.  The continental breakfast was, excellent extremely good value for 6 euro.  There are various levels and it is quite confusing.  There is a nice line for guests to use.  My friends had rooms that were much better located at the back of the building next to car park.",3,2015,06,25
222,Great hotel,"I stayed here with 2 friends when attending a concert in Dublin. We booked a family room, which had a double and 2 single beds.
The room was spacious, spotless and very well equipped with flat screen TV, DVD player and a selection of DVDs. Also a tea/coffee tray, fax machine and even a sauna. 
The bathroom was lovely, again spotlessly clean. 
All the staff we met were warm and friendly.
To top it off, the breakfast was fabulous. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again without hesitation.
",5,2015,06,24
222,Nice hotel,"Arrived at hotel at 5:30am on Saturday morning. Had to wait till 7 am till someone arrived. They held our bags, gave us maps and a few friendly suggestions. Spent the day on the red top hop on and off bus. Arrived back at 3 pm to a wonderful room. 
Check in is advertised at 2:30 pm so we were happy our bags were not only held but but in our room when we got back. 
They have a taxi contract for airport to hotel for €25. We paid €40 to the approved taxi que driver. 
Great location, quiet at night. City bus stop right outside hotel door. 
Would recommend and stay there again. ",5,2015,06,18
222,not as good second time,"We arrived very early in Dublin and went to Roxford Lodge knowing our room would not be ready but hoping we could leave our bags, we were allowed to leave our car and luggage in the secure car park and headed off to the city whilst waiting for the room to be available, returned around 12ish and room was available, very happy with that after a long flight.
We were offered tea/coffee etc on check in which was nice.
The room was a descent size and clean.
Had a lovely hot spa bath to relax.
Breakfast was very nice we do not have a hot breakfast but were well catered for with a good selection of cereals yogurt and fresh fruit, and of course the lovely toasted soda bread
There were however a couple of negatives
The noise coming from the spa bath when draining was extremely loud, sounded like the drain was blocked, as we were only there for the night I did not advise them at the time but advised reception on paying the bill so they could see to it before the next person was given the room, receptionist was apologetic and said she would get it looked at.
There was a large patch of unfinished plaster work on the ceiling towards the sliding door and another down the side of one bedside table these were also brought to the attention of reception some of the walls were a bit scuffed.
There were obvious repairs/renovations going on in the halls but I would have thought if renting a room any repairs would be completed beforehand
Other than the few issues I raised with reception it was still an enjoyable stay.",4,2015,06,16
222,Perfect for us,"We booked to be near the Aviva Stadium for the Scotland game and it couldn't be more ideal. Although the hotel lacked a bar the room we had was a good size despite it having a sauna in it. Yes a sauna! We didn't try it out but it was a first and we have stayed in many a hotel.

The staff were all excellent especially 'Mrs Doyle' who looked after the breakfasts which were really good and of great value.

Overall very impressed.",4,2015,06,15
222,Great small hotel in Dublin.,"We have been using the Roxford Lodge Hotel in Dublin 2-3 times a year for the past few years. We love staying in the Ballsbridge area of the city as it is fairly quiet, but only a short walk into the heart of Dublin. The hotel is very comfortable and we are always well taken care of!. I highly recommend staying here!",5,2015,06,13
222,Upscale and quaint,"We arrived early so our room wasn't ready, but the receptionist was most helpful with suggestions when we said we wanted to walk in the city and have lunch. The hotel was undergoing renovations to the parking area in the back and in one of the main corridors - but workers were unobtrusive. Corridors are a bit of a rabbit's warren. Appreciated the elevator (lift). Room was comfortable.",4,2015,06,12
222,Quirky but Nice,"I booked a single room at the Roxford and that is what i got. A perfectly comfortable but small single, however i did not expect the room to be dominated by a sauna room. Only in Eire! 

My room was spotless, whoever cleaned my room has put to shame many of the 5* hotels i have stayed in over the years. 

Breakfast was generous in proportions, the Full Irish sets you up for the day and you probably could do without lunch.

The Roxford is in the upmarket Ballsbridge area of Dublin, an easy 5 min walk to some nice  bars and restaurants and not so far that you could not walk into central Dublin.

As i said in my header, this is quirky hotel and i would describe it more as an upmarket guest house rather than a Hotel but that is not a negative, the service is good and my room was all i needed.

Would i stay here again...Yes!

",5,2015,06,08
222,Cluttered Good Value Room,"The Roxford Lodge is a very congenial kind of place on a quiet, tree lined street.  It is a converted multi story house or houses and it has about 20 rooms.  As such it is a very personal experience to stay there and this is part of the charm.

The room we had was small, but it had everything you would need.  It even included a sauna and jacuzzi.  For us, it just seemed that the rooms were disordered with plugs and amenities everywhere.

The room was small and very clean.  The bathroom was smaller, with very little shelf space   We had a view of the parking lot which did not affect us.  

For the price and comparing it to other offers in Dublin, it was a good choice.  The location, about 1.5 kilometers from central Dublin was good for transportation.  Buses were available in front of the hotel, but for not too much more, taxis were easy (for 2.)  You were far enough away from the center that you could imagine living in the area.  

Not for everyone, we would recommend the Roxford Lodge if you wanted to be a little outside the center.",4,2015,06,08
222,Roxford Lodge Hotel,"A very attractive up to date guest home!  Small rooms that are extremely cozy--we had a sauna in our room with a whirl pool tub in the bathroom. Breakfast was 6 euros for juice, porridge, toast, cheeses, cereals, fresh fruit, coffee and a cold plate (2 slice of ham and a sampler of cheeses) For 12 euros a full Irish Breakfast! Delicious!  Staff was very accommodating and informative!",5,2015,06,05
222,Exceptional Dublin Hotel,Very very nice hotel with exceptional Staff!  Nice location and easy walk to great restaurants as well as the sites of Dublin.  Hesitate to give a great review as it might make it more difficult to secure a reservation in the future.  They deserve it!  The Staff made our stay very memorable.... keep it up,5,2015,06,02
222,Fantastic stay ,"Great stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel - really warm, friendly staff, secure parking with a nicely decorated & spotlessly clean room which included a jacuzzi bath & sauna. Very tasty, freshly prepared breakfast, lots of choice. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,05,31
222,Lovely little hidden gem,"Friendly attentive staff🏤
Lovely rooms with a great bath!!!!!!!!🛀
Belly busting Irish breakfast to set you up for your day ahead 🍴
About a twenty minutes walk to centre of Dublin or a bus stop right outside costing €1.95 one way
Perfect ☺☺☺

222,Great boutique hotel in nice neighborhood,"Stayed three nights, the staff were extremely nice and helpful. Our room was new, clean, and modern. Surrounding area (Ballsbridge) was quiet and felt safe even walking back late at night. 10 min walk to Trinity college, 15 min walk to Temple bar area. Great experience, I would recommend Roxford Lodge to any friend visiting Dublin.",5,2015,05,30
222,First time visit to Dublin,"first time in Dublin and picked this hotel as it was in a quiet area and hearing that Dublin can be quite lively that's just what we wanted . Entering the hotel the room wasn't quite ready so we waited 10 minutes the was taken to our room . Room was very clean , bed was lovely and comfortable , bathroom a bit small but as we only slept there it done its purpose . We were in room 116 which was at the back end and it was really quiet ... We both slept all night . Not really a bad thing to say about this hotel and it only took us 20 mins to walk into Dublin each day and back again . Thank you for an enjoyable stay .",4,2015,05,28
222,10/10,"Really lovely property, wonderful friendly staff. We arrived at the hotel early so room wasn't ready but they sat us down to tea coffee and biscuits and had the room ready within twenty minutes. Breakfast in the morning was amazing too!",5,2015,05,28
222,"Good standard of interior, Fantastic breakfast!","We stayed here for one night in May 2015. The rooms are finished to a good standard and are light and airy. The parking was secured with electric gates, a really nice touch.

Upon arrival we were taken to our room by the gentleman on the front desk. He told us how to operate the jacuzzi bath and told us what we needed to know about breakfast etc.. He was very polite and took the time to help us out with recommendations of places to go for a walk and where to find a bar we had heard about.

The room was spotlessly clean as was the bathroom. We were particularly impressed that the room has not only UK/Irish power outlets but also European power outlets, although we'd brought adapters we thought it was an excellent and useful thought to install them.

Breakfast was not included but for between €6-10 it's very good value, especially considering the standard. There was a selection of cereals, yogurts, fruit salad, fruit juices as well as a choice of various cooked items and a full Irish breakfast, all of which is cooked to order. We had some cereal and yogurt and ordered the french toast with maple syrup which came very nicely presented. The lady in charge of the breakfasts was very polite and attentive.

We wish that we could have stayed longer and when we return to Dublin this is most definitely where we will come.",5,2015,05,26
222,Nice place to spend a night!,"We spent our first night in Ireland in this B&B.  It is convenient to a rental car company - within walking distance.  The staff were very welcoming and the room clean (though small!)  I rate the sleep quality as average as we were awakened by what I believe was a vacuum cleaner before 7 AM.  We are early risers, but after a long flight the day/night before, it may have been nice to have slept a bit longer!",4,2015,05,26
222,Ideal place to stay in Dublin,"I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.  It's either a quick ride to Trinity College from the bus stop across the street, or an easy 15-minute walk.  The staff and owner are so accommodating and helpful.  There are several good restaurants in the area.  The rooms are unique but very comfortable, and the baths have quality amenities.  Ownership is constantly refurbishing and renovating the rooms, and the upgrades are lovely.  Breakfasts are delicious with a nice variety of fruit, cheeses, and cereals available on a serve-yourself basis, in addition to the delicious, cooked-to-order hot menu items.  Nice, quiet neighborhood with the U.S. Embassy just a short walk away.  Very good value for the money.",5,2015,05,26
222,2 nights in May,Arrived from US early in morning. Room was not ready. Desk clerk took our bags and they were in our room when we returned in the afternoon.  They served us tea and cookies and were very helpful.  Room was in the back and was very quiet and had a great sauna in the room.,5,2015,05,24
222,"Lovely breakfast, comfy beds, exceptional service","We exchanged several e-mails prior to our visit and all of our questions were answered promptly and thoroughly.  We stayed here once at the start of our holiday and another night at the end - and they were kind enough to store a suitcase for us for two weeks as we traveled around Ireland.

There were several examples of exceptional service.  The front desk staff provided directions for us and helped us to navigate the public bus system (the bus stops right our front).  Breakfast exceeded our expectations and we were very well taken care of by the woman who handles it.  My husband said they had the creamiest porridge in all of Ireland, which kept us full until lunchtime.  

On our second visit they had our stored luggage waiting for us in our room upon arrival and they offered to open the breakfast half an hour early the next morning just for us since we had an early flight. They also arranged a cab to the airport for us (although you could use the bus if you prefer).  All this was done for us late at night, even though the front desk should have been closing up at that time.  The young man and woman at the desk were not at all put out by our many requests, and took the time to escort us to our room and offer us tea and coffee.  The linens were wonderful and the beds were extremely comfy.

222,Great location,"You can walk to all the tourist stuff from here, which is great! The hotel is well managed, nice people, good breakfast (although it is not included). We had the executive suite, so I can't speak to the other rooms. The suite was great with an interesting floor plan. Included a sauna and jacuzzi, which we did not use. Good choice for a Dublin tourist.
      ",4,2015,05,23
222,Excellent stay!,"My group of four friends stayed in the family suite which was very comfortable and perfect for us. It even had a sauna in the room! There were two twin beds and a queen and a fully equipped handicap bathroom which was nice to have extra space. 

The location was a nice walk from the main city center and situated in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. The staff was very welcoming and met us upon our near midnight arrival from the airport. There is also a great pub down the street at the Schoolhouse hotel which we went to one night- a great little local spot! 

I would definitely stay here again! Great stay in a great location. ",5,2015,05,22
222,Special,"The Executive Suite was excellent and my Partner and I were almost speechless on entering the Room. It was full of character, romantic, cosy and had everything that was needed, plus a Sauna. Recommended.",5,2015,05,19
222,D4 Charm,"Hotel is a good, safe location with good restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Around the corner is a pub, and a few steps further a top rated restaurant. Walking down the main road takes you to a section of pubs and restaurants used by locals, which is nice to get away form the hustle of downtown Dublin and the tourists.

222,"Great location, nice room","The location was great and the room was clean and comfortable. Most of our time in Ireland we stayed in small B&Bs. This was the largest place we stayed at on our trip, but the hotel was still quaint and charming. The staff was friendly. There was parking on site which was very helpful. We left our car at the hotel and waled into and all around the city. It think it was about 30 min walk to the city center",5,2015,05,09
222,Great hotel,"We stayed here 4 years ago and loved it . Our second trip back did not disappoint. Great location, nice area and walking distance from town. The staff were very helpful and courteous and made us feel valued and not just another guest. Rooms were clean and spacious and the huge bed was a plus too. Delighted to have am option for breakfast in bed. Although we only stayed for a night, we were delighted with it and wished we could stay longer ! We will definitely be back again!",5,2015,05,05
222,"Perfect location, Perfect room. Highly recommend ","Myself and my partner stayed at the Roxford Lodge for the 1 night and we didn't want to leave. Our room and the service was top class. Sauna and jacuzzi bath, internet tv 👌 Breakfast was the best and the lady that served us was extremely pleasant and couldn't do enough for us. And the receptionists where really down to earth. We will definitely be coming back. Thank you. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2015,05,04

222,Wonderful property!,"We made an excellent choice to stay at Roxford. The room had everything and more. The staff were accommodating and helpful, beds were comfortable and breakfast was tasty. The location is a short walk to the busy areas of Dublin but right at a bus stop. Highly recommend Roxford!

222,"Comfortable, quiet, and an easy walk from the action.","Delightful and easy. Nice, quiet, ten minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and the south side of the main tourist points. Bus stop is right out front, and the Aircoach stops about two blocks away. €25 pre-booked taxi rate to airport. Super obliging staff. Coffee/tea offered each time you come in. Favorite anecdote: When I asked about herbal teas, the fellow at the front desk said, ""Actually, we have quite a few,"" and hurried off to return with an armload of boxes to choose from. Clean bathroom! Other guests can be noisy, but that's the luck of the draw. Really lovely.",4,2015,05,03
222,Great,"I never tought i will find a room with an ensuit sauna and a hidro for the money i put in it. Plus their wifi is really great. Marvelous accomodation and the best staff. If one day i came back to Ireland, and stay in Dublin, even for one night, this is the place i intend to stay. ",5,2015,05,02

222,"great location, super parking - extremely clean.","Even in the midst of renovation work Roxford Lodge Hotel was very welcoming, clean and tidy.  I had a great stay and will book for the next visit.  Location is fab, 10 mins from the city centre -  bus stop on the doorstep.  The brilliant Dubliner bar just 2 mins walk (food is fantastic) 

Could do with updating your entrance locks (parking & doors) but once you have the hang of them its fine

222,Excellent location for visit to Bord Gais theatre,Lovely little hotel in an excellent location. I stayed there for two nights and loved it. The staff were friendly and helpful. My room was spotless and nicely decorated. Bord Gais theatre is just a short walk away and the city centre is about 20 minutes walk. Would definitely stay there again.,5,2015,04,25
222,Great hotel in a brilliant area 10 mins walk from the town centre,"a really nice hotel at a great price (especially at the weekend), close to the city centre. Needed only a bed to sleep in and a shower to take in the morning so can't really comment on the facilities. Room was clean and well decorated, the hotel is in a quiet area of Dublin so you can get good night's sleep.",5,2015,04,24
222,Little Gem!,"
This place is such a nice change from the hustled anonymity of major hotels. We found it through trip advisor and in spite of some of the negative reviews we decided to give it a go. From our first emails to them to our departure at the end of our stay it was all good. We arrived later than expected so the niece we were meeting up with had a long wait. They brought her tea and biscuits in the lounge and took good care of her until our arrival. The front desk people were helpful and eager to give us good advice on places to visit and how to get there. After a long day of walking and sightseeing it was so nice to come back to a friendly face and an offer of tea or coffee and biscuits in the cozy lounge or in our room. The beds were comfy, the room had everything we needed. Loved having a fridge in the room. We didn't use the sauna but it was fun knowing we could use it if we wanted. The tub in the bathroom was a jacuzzi! Cool! The breakfast they provided us each morning was enormous and very tasty. We had the full Irish breakfast but even their version of the continental breakfast looked to be quite substantial. The neighborhood the hotel is in is very nice. Never felt nervous about walking in it. There are restaurants and pubs and two Spar grocery stores very close by. And of course the 4 and the 7 bus stop right in front of it. Very highly recommended. ",5,2015,04,23
222,Tired and in need of facelift - but centrally located and friendly staff,"This was described as a luxury boutique hotel - far from it. Our basin in the bathroom was cracked, the bath panel was very stained, one of the taps had bits missing - no bed valance so you could see the sides of the base of the  bed and very tired looking curtains. Cigarette buts on the balcony. I booked this hotel because one of the pictures showed the canal which I thought you could see from the balconies ! - rather deceiving as the balcony looked onto the hotel car park.  Staff were friendly, charming and helpful - and the hotel is within easy walking distance of Central Dublin. However, we had a delicious evening meal in a French bistro just along which was absolutely fabulous - and we will review separately. All in all, rather disappointing as could be really good with a little extra TLC and attention to all the snagging such as changing our basin! Good size TV and lots of movies to watch for free.",3,2015,04,23
222,Short Stay,Another great stay at this hotel (this was our third stay).  As always staff were pleasant and very helpful.  Breakfast plentiful. Room was lovely and spacious.  Will definitely be back to stay again. Car parking on site which is hard to find in Dublin.,5,2015,04,23
222,"Gem of a hotel, easy access to city and stadium","My wife and I had a very nice visit to Dublin and would recommend the hotel. We stayed in an economy room but the executive rooms (with hot tubs and/or saunas) look amazing! 

The staff were very helpful and accomodating. We also sincerely appreciated afternoon tea in the lounge.

The hotel is easy walking distance to Liffey, TCD and Temple Bar(15-20 min) and 10 min to Aviva Stadium.",5,2015,04,23
222,Comfort in a stylisch Victorian House,"Great place, we had an infrared (IR) heating chamber in our room (!) as well as a Jacuzzi bathtub (very relaxing). Bus to city centre departs every 15 minutes in front of the hotel and takes you to Trinity College in 5 minutes. Don't come to Roxford if you can't miss the typical hotel chain rooms! This place is for individualists.",5,2015,04,23
222,Not worth the money paid for and the description of the place is very misleading,"The sink has 2 taps and you have to decide whether you use ice cold water or burn your hands with boiling water. Most rooms are said to have saunas and spa bathtubs, my room had a shower where the water was going through the whole bathroom leaving it wet everywhere as it's not a closed shower but a shower next to sink and toilet. The free parking is only when you can find a space, otherwise you have to park on street and pay. The room has a glass on the ceiling which you can;t cover and if you can't tolerate a lot of light while you sleep, then you will wake up at 7am.",2,2015,04,22
222,A great place for a match at Aviva Stadium,"The main goal of my trip to Dublin was attending Ireland - Poland football match at Aviva Stadium. Here Roxford Lodge offers a great location, just a short walking distance from the venue.
My single room was quite small, but - impressively - containing all the necessary things and even more: a sauna! :-)
The full Irish breakfast is very tasty and filling. The breakfast room is unfortunately very small, with just a few tables, so sometimes you have to wait for a table.",4,2015,04,20
222,A little gem,"We spent three nights in Roxford Lodge Hotel.  From the moment of our arrival we were made welcome. We were offered tea and coffee on arrival.   Ou room was well appointed and the beds were of the highest quality ensuring a good nights sleep.  Housekeeping was excellent,  the en suite had full bath with shower overhead and also hand shower. Very high quality towels, changed daily and a lovely range of toiletries .  A wide range of dvd's and tea/coffee also. Car parking is free with direct access to hotel. The front garden is very well maintained and was a mass of colour.  Breakfast was not included in the rate but at €6 for continental must be the best value in ?Dublin.  Juices, fresh fruit salad, yogurts, cereals and porridge and also a ham and cheese plate. We loved our stay. Thank you",5,2015,04,16
222,Superb Staff,"Just had the one night here, we were disappointed with the room as it did not match the description, the staff could not apologise enough and put it down to the description being supplied by a third party, not the hotel. The free breakfast that they gave as a way of an apology more than made up for the misunderstanding. Agnes, maitre 'd of the breakfast room was worth the entrance fee alone, so entertaining (whether she knew it or not, I suspect she did in that understated Dublin way). Staff were so helpful, Anthony & Lindsey, couldn't do enough for us, even down to a tray of tea and biscuits when we had in effect booked out and were no longer resident. Would recommend the Roxford Lodge 100%.",5,2015,04,14
222,Lovely place to stay,"We have just had a 2 night stay and thoroughly enjoyed it, we were given room 136 which is at the bottom of the car park, what a lovely room beautifully decorated,and  a jacuzzi bath, walk in shower and a sauna all in the room!!!! Our only comment was that we found the room rather warm. Breakfast was lovely and Agnes was just charming what a lovely lady. We found all of the staff very good with a special mention for both Lynsay and Anthony, they could not do enough for you and nothing was a bother. A charming hotel, a 15 min walk into the city centre and with plenty of good bars and restaurants in the locality We would definitely stay here again..",4,2015,04,13
222,Extremely disappointing stay for us here.,"Extremely disappointing stay for us here. 
Having booked a larger luxury double we expected just that. Unfortunately this was not the case.
Having looked on some booking sites which clearly state that luxury rooms are larger, have a jacuzzi bath and sauna, well this is not actually the case !!
The luxury room we were provided with is in fact quite small, basically ours had just enough room to walk comfortably around the bed. It did not have both sauna and jacuzzi bath. 
I questioned my room as I thought it was a standard/economy room to be told it was a large luxury room, I argued my point but to no avail.
Our room was at the front of the hotel facing the road.

And so to the breakfast fiasco.

Went down for breakfast just before 9am to find the very small dining room full. We were told to wait upstairs near reception and we would be called when space become available. Two other couples were already waiting. Then another five people joined the queue.
Anyway to cut a long story short 45 minutes later the dining room was still full even though other diners had just not bothered to queue and were seated ahead of those already queueing. After waiting over 45 minutes we had other things to do and could not let it ruin our day any further. The hotel refunded 15 euros because they could not provide us with the breakfast we had paid for in a timely efficient manner. So we had to go into Dublin to have breakfast elsewhere.
The hotel is a good 15-20 minute walk into the city or a taxi ride which cost us 20 euros for a return trip.
I'm sure there are some positive points about this hotel but unfortunately they were few and far between for us.

The secure parking is a good feature.

We will be staying elsewhere next time.",2,2015,04,13
222,Amazing place to stay in Dublin,This hotel/bed and breakfast is an amazing place to stay in Dublin.  The staff are extremely friendly and courteous.  They are willing to help you with an issues or concerns that you may have.  The hotel is in a great location just outside downtown Dublin.  You have easy access to the downtown area by the bus line that picks you up right outside the front door.  The hotel is very charming.  The decor is warm and inviting.  For a true warm welcome to Dublin you have to stay at Roxford Lodge.,5,2015,04,13
222,RA,"I would stay again no question.   The staff is helpful and the hotel itself is fantastic.  In a row of brownstones in the ballsbrige area, the neighborhood is bustling and the walk the the center of Dublin was 15 to 20 minutes. Great location and the rooms are lovely too.  Sauna in my room and jacuzzi tub.",5,2015,04,09
222,Splendid in every way,"We've stayed at the Roxford several times. Each time is an abiding pleasure. The building itself is beautiful, well appointed, close enough to walk into town, with a bus stop right outside the door if you get footsore. The rooms are always not only immaculately well kept, but characterful and elegant and some of them have my ultimate added luxury: a sauna. The place exudes an air of serene charm. The staff could not be more courteous and considerate, looking after every aspect of our stay so we feel completely refreshed, even after a long journey. I strongly advise you to experience a stay at the Roxford. Simply the best place to stay in Dublin.",5,2015,04,08
222,A room with 3 floors.,"We had a fantastic stay here during the Easter break, a Saturday night stay and exactly what we needed to unwind and couldn't have picked a better place to do it with a stay in one of the executive rooms. Kitchenette, sauna, jacuzzi and a huge comfortable bed are the main assets of the room. Surround sound stereo system and big screen TV are also features of the room. Loved it here and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",4,2015,04,07
222,"Great location, staff and breakfast","This is a lovely, small hotel about 15 mins walk from the city centre. The staff are fantastic and really welcoming to our family, making a fuss of the kids (which they loved). We were particularly taken with Agnes who serves breakfast and has been there for 30 yrs. Such a lovely lady who always has time for a chat, and serves amazing breakfast cooked to order. Highly recommended for families and business travellers. Excellent to have parking so close to the city centre too.",4,2015,04,07
222,Best area to stay in Dublin,"The hotel is on the bus route from the airport. 6 euros and about 30 mins. Hotel is very comfortable and impeccably clean. Jacuzzi is a fun touch. Copious continental breakfast is great at 6 euros. Full Irish at 12 euros is OTT. Super staff are very attentive. About 10 minutes walk from Aviva stadium Perfect if you are. watching rugby. 20 mins walk into centre. Restaurants 10 minutes including  Milano, Irish version of Pizza Express. Wifi very poor over all 3 days",5,2015,04,05
222,A good hotel in a nice location,"We stayed here for just one night. This was a nice hotel within walking distance of many good attractions. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The only improvement that would have made our stay excellent would be a bit more attention to detail in the cleaning. There was a orange lolly in the floor at the foot of our bed. Upon filling the spa bath and turning on the bubbles a heap of dirt started pumping out of the bubble outlets. I emptied and refilled the bath to the same result. It really needed a thorough clean and was unusable. I notified the girl at the desk who apologised and offered to switch our room but after a long day of travel we couldn't be bothered and declined, deciding to just use the shower instead. We also had some issues with the curtains in our room not shutting properly. Some of the hooks had come off and the ceiling was so high we couldn't fix it so we had to sleep with them partially open. The saving grace was that the staff seemed friendly and they were happy to allow us to leave our bags at reception as we had a late flight. Overall it was still quite a pleasant stay with only a few problems and I would give them another go should I travel back again.",3,2015,04,04
222,A wonderful stay!,"I booked Roxford Lodge because the price was reasonable and it was easy to get to UCD for the conference I was attending. I was expecting only the most basic accommodation but when I arrived the person who showed me the room pointed out the jacuzzi bathtub! Several of the rooms have saunas/hot tubs too, but I was staying in the basic Economy Double. The bed was comfy, room was clean and well put together and the bath was wonderful. There was a wifi box in my room which meant the internet speed was really good and very reliable. The lounge downstairs is lovely too. The staff were very helpful and friendly. If I go back to Dublin I'll definitely stay here again!",5,2015,03,31
222,nice location/ poor bathroom,"we enjoyed the location in a nice old house in Dublin 4, quite central area and thus quiet. walking distance of many things. The personnel in very kind. We were disapointed by the bathroom very ill functionning, badly conceived. Room was average.",2,2015,03,29
222,Excellent,I stayed 3 nights during the St. Patrick's festivities. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. I was offered coffee or tea upon arrival which I found to be a really nice gesture. I had a single room which was very clean and comfortable. Hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood and at a perfect distance from the crazy city center. It is a 20-25 minute walk to the city center or a quick bus ride. The bus stop is outside the hotel and the airport shuttle also has a stop nearby.,5,2015,03,27
222,A really enjoyable stay.,"Stayed 3 nights, 4 days around the St Patrick's Day festival and the Roxford Lodge was a great choice. It's on main bus routes in and out of town and there are bus stops right outside on both sides of the road. You are also only a few minutes walk from the DART railway at Landsdowne Road and armed with the 72 hour LEAP pass you can easily get anywhere around the Dublin area.
I had a single room at the front of the hotel which was quiet due to triple glazing and thick lined curtains. It had a decent sized fridge, a flat screen TV, DVD and courtesy tray. The Jacuzzi bath had a pump to regulate it and even on the lowest setting it was pretty crazy. All the staff were friendly and helpful and as the receptionist that checked me in said, 'The full Irish breakfast will set you up for the day'. She was right and I set off for the day and didn't even look for anything to eat until mid-afternoon. Another plus point was the drinking water tap in the bedroom which was great for filling a water bottle from and to fend off dehydration after a few pints of Guinness. The Wi-Fi is free and effective throughout the hotel and there is a PC in the lounge which is also free to residents. On the days I was there the real fire was lit if you fancied reading or surfing in the lounge rather than your own room.
There are plenty of eating and drinking places nearby and as well as Ballsbridge I also wandered down to the Bath Road area, Irishtown and Sandymount. A walk along the beach is a good hangover cure. I found everybody welcoming and more than wiling to recommend places and pubs to visit and it's that friendliness that keeps me returning to Dublin.",5,2015,03,21
222,Wonderful experience,"Great,friendly staff. Wonderful experience. Greeted and offered coffee and tea upon every return to the hotel. Excellent breakfast, bed was comfortable. Staff was extremely helpful in booking tours and offering information. Nice warm fire to sit by on the cold wet nights.",5,2015,03,21
222,Well presented and very welcoming.,"Arrived close to midnight due to flight delays but the warm welcome by the lady on the desk made up for it. Especially as she offered to bring us a pot of tea and biscuits to our room. Room was recently furnished to a high standard and had a lot of conveniences - TV, DVD (with DVD's), Ipod speaker, Wifi, Kettle, Safe, Bath with spa. Hotel lounge was equally well presented with open fire lit. Hotel is also positioned well in Dublin. Can recommend Roxford for both excellent staff and well kept facilities.",5,2015,03,21
222,charming old-world style with modern services,"a short ten minute walk from center dublin, this hotel is spared the madness of temple bar or grafton street.  great service and amenities, comfort and style.  wouldn't stay anywhere else when in dublin.",5,2015,03,20
222,Perfect!,"Our time at the Roxford Lodge Hotel was delightful, a boutique hotel of great distinction with its incredibly comfortable rooms and charming atmosphere, accompanied by the friendliest and most hospitable staff. This hotel was truly a home away from home for us at the beginning and end of each day as we explored Dublin and surrounding areas. Simply one of the the most charming and well appointed places I’ve stayed anywhere having traveled extensively. The hotel is only a 15 minute walk to town or short bus or taxi ride, located in a quaint upscale safe neighborhood with relevant necessities in the near vicinity. I would highly recommend the Roxford to anyone looking to stay in Dublin, most definitely looking forward to a return visit one day…",5,2015,03,17
222,Overall a very good hotel,"Hotel is overall very good with excellent breakfast, friendly and helpful staff, lovely rooms, good bus link to city and largely very quiet but , on one occasion, our sleep was badly disturbed by 4 young lads.  The owner quietened them down and there was no more bother.  We will return without doubt.",4,2015,03,16
222,Great Weekend Stay,"Stayed her on one of the busiest weekends of the year, unknowingly, we had booked to see a show very early on last year because of the great reviews and glad we did, the hotel is beautiful, we loved every minute, we are not one of those couple's that goes around picking and moaning about minor details. We arrived late Friday evening ditched our bags and went round the corner for a few pints which was grand after a long day, had a great nights sleep in our lovely comfortable room, hearty full Irish to kick start the day, then a pleasant  walk into the city for a days exploring and the show, Taxi to and from the airport €28 but there was a bus service but we could not be bothered with that. Staff so friendly at the hotel , so all in all, great hotel, great location, clean and comfortable and we will be coming back, Thank you Roxford Lodge for helping to make our stay memorable .",5,2015,03,16
222,Good small hotel,"Small but very comfortable, good location. No bar but they'll serve drinks in a small lounge area. Rooms very comfortable, with a surprising addition of a sauna in the corner. Jacuzzi bath in bathroom but it's small. Room itself was spacious. Free parking in back yard is handy and secure. Nice friendly staff.",4,2015,03,14
222,Comfortable - central - great value great service and much better than we could have hoped for.,We had always stayed in a large hotel when we stayed in Dublin believing you only get what you pay for. Our Daughter had booked this hotel previously and was unable to go because of ill health. The hotel kindly issued her with a voucher so she would not be out of pocket. That was ayear ago and the voucher was due to expire so coinciding with her mums birthday she gifted it to her. The room was compact but luxurious as was the rest of the hotel throghout. But what made the stay special was the personal touch from the staff who done all they could to make our stay a memorable one. We will be back 5 star!!,5,2015,03,14
222,Very good,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for the RDS bike show, very friendly owners and staff, Great location bus stop outside the door and parking at the rear,rooms were clean and comfortable, Breakfast was lovely with a big choice of food,",4,2015,03,13
222,Not a good nights sleep,"Firstly the staff were very nice, and it is close to Temple Bar with the bus stopping just outside the hotel. There was free secure parking (if you don't mind parking in a tip with stray cats) and there was a DVD player in the room with a good selection of DVD's, but the nice points of the hotel stop there. It was not luxury at all, it was just weird. 

The room we stayed in was very old and the decor had not been updated for at least 30 years, mostly for me it was the bed, it had two depressions of previous hotel guests in it and I had a terrible nights sleep, so creepy. There was a wooden box in the corner of the room that was supposed to be a sauna, which was really strange and spooky. Actually if I was alone I would have not been able to sleep in the room because I would have been scared of what would come out of the box.

There was a tip at the back of the hotel, with stray cats which were not friendly. and the hallways were very narrow which made me feel very claustrophobic. 

Suffice to say this is a one night place only, we were checked out by 8am.",2,2015,03,11
222,Room for improvement,"The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and the front garden entrance area looks nice.  However, some aspects of the hotel are dated and could be improved.  Some areas of the common area / hallways need to be fixed up and the tip in the car park at the back is attracting a lot of neigbourhood cats, although that did not really bother me.

Our room was rather dated and mysterious.  I read that some people liked the small sauna in the room, personally I thought it was just weird - but that is just me.  Other interesting/odd features included an old radio in-built into the sauna, a fax machine, plastic plants along the wall and the disabled style bathroom (which of course is good if disabled or elderly).  The room tried to achieve an Italian feel but it didn't really work for me.

The room was very quiet which was great for sleeping.  The TV worked well and there was also a DVD player with a selection of DVDs in the room.  

The mattress on our bed must have been quite old because it had indentations from the weight of all the previous guests and I felt the springs.  That said, I still had a decent night's sleep.

So, all in all, I had a decent experience but it is certainly not luxury.",3,2015,03,11
222,Love it!,"Great place to stay, I plan to stay there every time I visit Dublin! Great room and lots of character unlike most hotels, the rooms are spacious and I love having a sauna in my room. Food is great and the owner is a lovely lady who will talk about anything and everything. Good family feel.",5,2015,03,08
222,Excellent place to stay,We were welcomed straight away and offered a cup of tea and biscuits on arrival which was a lovely touch. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good too. Bus stop just outside and about 10 minutes from the City Centre. Hopefully we will get to stay there again in the not to distant future. ,5,2015,03,08
222,A disappointing 5 star hotel,"Stayed here for one night in February.  Hotel to me is a glorified B&B and definitely not 5 star.  I see from another review that every room has a sauna and jacuzzi well ours did not have a sauna and the jacuzzi bath was a big disappointment. The bath was much too small to be used as a jacuzzi.  There was not even a shower cap offered.  The ensuite could do with being modernised if it is a 5 star.  Breakfast was ok but unfortunately  lacking in taste.  Too many cereals in little boxes offered and the large bottle of cheap brown sauce with a dirty top  did not rate 5 star to me.  This ""Hotel"" does not even have a bar area where you could sit and relax while having a drink although a drinks menu was on display in the hallway. I would not stay here again way too expensive for what you get.",3,2015,03,02
222,Excellent,Every room has a sauna and jacuzzi. What more do you need? Service was friendly and helpful and its location in gorgeous Georgian Dublin :-). Close enough to the centre but with bars and restaurants nearby too.  I'd recommend the Chophouse for lovely irish craft beers and a decent set menu. ,5,2015,02,27
222,Execellent stay,"Small but well appointed room with every amenity, lovely bathroom  with good lighting. nice quiet convenient location  Staff were very help and friendly. Highly recommended 
Car park very tight but secure,",4,2015,02,23
222,Lovely hotel and a short walk away from town,"Arrived for a 3night stay in Feb to celebrate a 30th birthday, stayed in room 122 which was small however we did not spend much time in it as we were exploring Dublin. Had all amenities needed but a small fridge would have been useful. Only down side was that next door to our room was a cleaning room and the noise of the dryers/washing machines humming got annoying hearing it everyday morning and evening, also staff noisy running up and down stairs to get to this area which were located next to our room. Did not have breakfast here so can not comment but seemed over priced. Beautiful building for a hotel and lovely easy short walk into town each day. Would visit again if in a different room.",4,2015,02,23
222,Lovely hotel,"This was our second visit to Roxford, this time with our kids. Lovely place. We would stay there again. The sauna in the bedroom was a novelty. Wonderful staff - helpful and laid back. Easy walk into town.",5,2015,02,23
222,"Amazing hotel, great location & friendly staff.","Had a great time in this hotel, was perfect in every way. Would definitely recommend & go back. Staff where very attentive & friendly. Room was a good size & bath/sauna where great. Short walk to city centre & aviva stadium.",5,2015,02,22
222,"Excellent stay, lovely hôtel.","The hôtel is located in a quiet quarter of Dublin, And the center is  easy to reach ( bus, taxi, or by foot for just 20 minutes)we had two lovely rooms.it is a really Nice place that i would recommend.the staff is Very helpfull and friendly ( good french speaking...it can help)",5,2015,02,21
222,Superb hotel in a quiet area ,"I had never heard of this hotel before finding it on a google search. 
I was visiting Dublin for the Ennio Morricone concert. 
This hotel is ideal for a stay if you're looking for somewhere comfortable, quiet, outside the city but very accessible via bus and taxi. The bus stop from the city is literally outside the door (route 4 or 7) and the stop to the city is just across the road. 

The hotel is part of a row of large houses and is very warm and welcoming. I was treated to tray service of coffee and biscuits in the sitting room in front of a fire when I arrived. 

The bedroom was very warm and well appointed with TV and music system an air conditioning. I will say it can get very warm if the AC is off. 
The bed was very comfortable and all parts were spotlessly clean. There was also a jacuzzi in the bathroom. 

The staff were very helpful and friendly. 

On the day of my departure I walked into the city centre which is a nice leisurely stroll for a Sunday morning. 

I would recommend this hotel for comfort, location and value for money and friendliness of staff. ",5,2015,02,19
222,Really nice place,I had a lovely quiet room in the annex with everything you needed for a stay of a few days. What was a really nice touch was being offered a cup of tea every time I came back in the later afternoon - just made you feel that everyone at the hotel was really making an effort. It's a brisk 15 min walk to the City Centre but for me that was perfect. Won't choose anywhere else when I go back to Dublin.,5,2015,02,18
222,My favorite place in Dublin,"I've come to this hotel already a couple of times and I love the place. Some of the reasons:
- The location: next to the office, not far from city center. Can go by foot or bus.
- The personal sauna in the room!! It feels great to go to bed after a sauna. I'll miss that!
- Many details in the room: DVDs, boiler, great wifi, european power plugs!!
- Awesome staff. Very friendly.
- Had breakfast only once, but was very good.",5,2015,02,14
222,Winter stay,"Smiling welcomes, helpful staff and a charming family owner and team.
I will return if only for the breakfast and location, perfect stay for business and pleasure..
Mini Sauna, spa jet bath and dvd library made it a home from home.",5,2015,02,12
222,Couldn't be bettere,"I stayed at the Roxford Lodge in February 2015.  This was my third visit.  I cannot imagine a better place to say -- an easy walk to City Centre, the most accommodating and friendly staff of any hotel I have stayed at, wonderful rooms, great breakfasts, and all at a fair price.  I would like to offer some constructive criticisms -- I am a college professor and that is my job -- but I simply cannot.  This place is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.",5,2015,02,11
222,Wonderful stay,"This is a fabulous guesthouse with a very welcoming and helpful staff. We stayed in the triple, which had a sauna and a whirlpool bath. The beds really cozy and comfortable -- 5 star standard. The breakfast is delicious -- the best French Toast! I also liked the secured free car park at the back. I would highly recommend Roxford -- we will definitely be back.",5,2015,02,11
222,Roxford Lodge Hotel,"Very clean, quiet, but yet very central accommodation. Easy to walk to any landmark in Dublin from here. Room has everything required and excellent deluge shower.
Friendly staff and very, very comfortable beds.",5,2015,02,10
222,Wonderful Home away from Home,"I booked this hotel based on its Trip Advisor reviews.  It did not disappoint!  Upon arrival, we were offered coffee and tea and they stowed our luggage while our room was prepared.  The front desk advisors were fabulous.  They offered us directions, tips, and general kindness.  Very friendly and attentive.  On our second day, our tour was cancelled and Stephane stepped in and recommended Paddywagon Tours.  It was a wonderful day tour and we were thrilled with his recommendation.  The rooms were cozy and accommodating.  The beds were comfortable.  There was a sense of luxury at an affordable price.  There is a bus stop right outside the door that will take you all over the city.  Although,the center of town is within walking distance.  I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again when I return to Dublin.",5,2015,02,03
222,Excellent stay,"It is not a full service hotel but it is better rooms and more comfortable than most 4 stars! If you want bar and restaurant and 24 hour reception, not for you but if you business or tourist looking for clean comfortable stay with good service this is best choice in town! ",5,2015,01,29
222,Little gem!,"Lovely stay, great location, great accommodation & great service. Got last minute deal too so excellent value! Would recommend to anyone that wants to be really well looked after & centrally located in D2 area. Arrived at hotel on a cold evening & was offered tea which was brought free of charge to my room! ",5,2015,01,28
222,"Great location, family atmosphere",Hotel has great location - just 10 minutes to the city centre. Its neighborhood is very calm. Staff is very friendly. We felt really welcomed. They are really helpful. Hotel has very cosy and family atmosphere. Rooms are well-equipped. Breakfasts were tasty. It was a beautiful stay during Christmas and New Years Eve. Thank you!,5,2015,01,28
222,Brilliant place!,"Really liked this hotel, it includes all the amenities you need - free secure parking, free wifi, helpful and friendly staff. The hotel itself is very present with spacious, clean and quiet rooms. It is located a short (several minute) taxi ride from Temple Bar and the City Centre. Definitely recommend this hotel and we would return. Plus, we only stayed in the cheaper economy double room.",5,2015,01,24
222,A real gem in many ways,"I arrived at 6:30 am exhausted from a very long trip along with a lost luggage.I requested via email to have an early check out and when I arrived a room was ready for me. The staff did everything they could to make my trip great, recommendation with where to eat, get to a pharmacy, and they actually walk you to your room and give you the "" How it works"". The hotel is very clean and has a lot of charm, a few nice touches such as a selection of movies in your room, warm towels holders in the bathroom, to name a few. The location is great you can walk to city center and major attractions by waling about 15-20 depending on your pace. The area is the upscale ballsbridge (also the home of our Embassy, US). Do not miss this great hotel",5,2015,01,21
222,Great place to stop,Stay here whenever I am in Dublin before getting the ferry back to the UK. Great rooms and friendly staff. Very continent for the ferry and some nice places to eat locally. Beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed. Well worth a visit. ,5,2015,01,14
222,Loved this place,"I've been here for two days, I loved the place, loved the lady at the reception, loved the breakfast, everything was nice and...warm! I felt like home when I was using the computer in the room besides the reception. There was a fire in the fireplace, couches and I really loved the atmosphere. The room was good, clean and I appreciated a lot the collection of movies we had in the room. We had a car and they made us park it in the back, giving us the code for the gate. It's not in the city center, but in Dublin if you don't want to spend too much this is a good place. To come from the airport you can take the taxi for 25€ and to go to the city center you have two choices, by foot, if you like walking, or by bus. If I come back, I'll definitely stay here again.",5,2015,01,14
222,Charming & Efficient,"The setting and character with attention to detail and charm, big windows looking out on the front garden and street activity, free parking and wifi, nice upscale residential area with family pub around the corner, a great walking neighborhood, and wonderful accommodating staff sets the tone and draws you in.  Everything you need in a thimble.  Infrared sauna in the room and small jacuzzi bathtub.  DVD player, printer, hairdryer, hotpot with tea amenities.  We were given complimentary tea and cookies/crackers on arrival which was much appreciated.  There is a bus stop in front of the hotel that makes everything easily accessible and much can be accessed on foot.  My only negative is that the space was a bit small for our habits.  If you are used to small spaces or are a solo traveller this may not be a factor.  Breakfast was not included and we did not partake.",4,2015,01,11
222,So nice,Such a nice and small hotel the staff are lovely and rooms are amazing near everything stayed here 2 years ago and staying again end the month highly recommend 😄.  Loved the place so relaxing and Cosey,5,2015,01,11
222,Very nice and very friendly staff,We spent 3 nights at the Roxford Lodge Hotel. We would definitely recommend the place or come back. It is very clean and comfortable! You get a welcome Tea and crackers when you arrive! (you can walk to the City center about 15-20 Min).,4,2015,01,10
222,Relaxed!,A great little hotel.  About a 20 minute walk from Temple Bar area.  Staff was very pleasant.  Room was cozy and comfortable with a jacuzzi tub and a selection of dvd's and dvd player.  Breakfast was nice and I recommend the full Irish breakfast.  Excellent wi-fi.,5,2015,01,08
222,"If I come back one day in Dublin, I'll choose this hotel once more !","Room comfortable and clean. Well heated (in winter the weather can be very cold). Possible to make coffee or tea. Bathroom clean. 
Breakfast with lot of choice. 
Very good restaurants 5 mn walk from the hotel (good advice from the man at the front desk).",5,2015,01,07
222,Half the price - twice the comfort,"Expected a budget room but was given a room which far exceeded this expectation - with person room sauna, satellite TV, DVDs. Huge breakfast selection cooked on request. Charming and very helpful owner and staff. A definite recommendation!!!",5,2015,01,02
222,Fantastic!,Stayed in the suite just after Christmas. Was fantastic. Lovely for a romantic getaway. I would highly recommend it :-). The room has all the necessities plus nice extras. Handy location to travel into town. Staff were very welcoming.,5,2015,01,01
222,Fabulous stay!,"We could not fault our stay: from beginning to end it was hospitable, comfortable and most enjoyable. Perfectly located for the city itself, but far enough out to be away from the hustle and bustle. We'd recommend it to anyone and will definitely return. ",5,2014,12,31
222,"The reviews don't lie, amazing hotel. Go for executive suite worth the money!","Stayed here on the 28/12/2014 for only 1 night in the executive suite. Arrived at 12pm and told our rooms wouldn't be ready until 2:30 so the woman behind reception never caught her name recommended places to go for dinner so we went out and found them looked at there menus for dinner that night and passed the couple of hours that way. 

Came back to the hotel for 2.30 the woman had our key cards ready instantly. Very happy with that then she offered us tea in our room and we accepted. The woman was lovely also gave us a room tour of the executive suite which was amazing. The room does have a wow factor, the sauna and jaccuzi very easy to use and very great addition to the room. The four poster bed was very comfy best night sleep I had in a long time. The selection of DVDS was great. Also received complimentary box of chocolates and wine in the room and they were of great quality. The balcony has a nice view of the Aviva. There is an ipod docking station which is nice touch to play music but neither of us had ours with us. Computer and printer also in the room but never needed to use them but handy for someone who would. Lots of closet space, lots of places to sit down in the room and the room was by no means small. When going out in the evening there was a different receptionist on he was very friendly and spoke when we went past him. Check out is at 12pm.

Hotel is walking distance to city center but if you don't fancy a walk there is a bus stop right outside the door which is great. Great location never had a noise problem at all.

Only negative would be but didn't effect our stay at all was we noticed Sky channels had no volume on the television. Only channels with volume was rte 1, rte 2, tv3 and tg4. Also the room comes with a very nice kitchen but there was no cutlery?

Planning our next trip back. Never ate breakfast in hotel so can't review that. Great for a romantic night away.",5,2014,12,30
222,Fantastic hotel!,"Just far enough outside the city, but within easy walking distance.  Very friendly staff, always offering to bring a pot of tea to the room every time we came through the door.  Very nice room; clean and comfortable.  Definitely recommended!",5,2014,12,30
222,Outstanding Accomadations,From The moment we checked in the customer service was amazing. Dez the man that checked us in was the one helping us the whole time. Every time we walked in the door he would offer to bring coffee or tea to the room. He was very friendly and accommodating. He helped us with directions by writing down on the map locations that we wanted to see and how too get there. the whole staff is very friendly and willing to help. Thank you to Dez and the entire staff at the Roxford Lodge hotel we will be back if back in Dublin.,5,2014,12,29
222,Great hotel,"Very good,!!!!!!
Excellent location!!!!!!!!
Great value for money!!!!!
Lovely staff,,,,, helpfull
Breakfast was brilliant, kitchen staff are very pleasant, tasty food,,,, clean hotel althrough,,,
Quiet, rooms are clean and tidy, beautifully decorated",4,2014,12,27
222,Comfortable and friendly,"Very good location, great staff. I've only given it 3 stars on cleanliness as the bathroom had a very very strong smell of cigarette some. The staff were very helpful when I asked for air  freshener. I was just disappointed that it hadn't been dealt with before we got to the room, as I'm sure the cleaners had to have noticed it.",4,2014,12,20
222,Home away from home!,"This was our third time staying at Roxford lodge and we really enjoyed our time there.  What sets this place apart from other places is the hospitality you recieve. The staff are all lovely and very friendly and they offer you complimentary tea/coffee on arrival and deliver it to your room! 
Breakfast is cooked fresh to order ( not like some of those hotels that have the buffet style luke warm food on offer) and is excellent quality.  Its in a great location and very quiet at night so good for a good nights sleep.  All in all great value for money and we will definitely be staying again in the future.",5,2014,12,20
222,Wonderful 😄,"I chose this hotel for the free parking and I'm so glad I did! This lovely hotel is in a great location with beautiful rooms and free wifi. The staff were so friendly and attentive, we will most definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,17
222,Great value stay in Dublin,"We ended up at the Roxford Lodge Hotel when we decided to extend our trip and the place we were staying was booked.  What a great find! The staff are extremely helpful and accommodating.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was the best I've had in years.  The room we had had both a jacuzzi tub and an infrared sauna.  The only thing I would change, is that I would trade the sauna for extra space in the room.",5,2014,12,17
222,A hidden gem.,"I was attending an evening event at one of the embassies in Dublin recently and needed overnight accommodation. Wanting something else from a chain hotel I did a bit of Googling and came across this place.
Location was right in one of the better parts of Dublin, close to the embassies, RDS and a short cab ride to the city center.
Online reviews were good so I went ahead and booked.
It was even better than expect, the hotel is in a converted townhouse and decorated very tastefully. Rooms are spacious, with excellent beds and furniture. In-room facilities included blisteringly fast *free* wifi, a flatscreen TV, DVD playet (with a stack of movies) and a printer/fax combo.
Staff was extremely courteous and efficient. 
Location is in a quiet residential area with free parking to the rear of the hotel.
On top of that the price is very hard to beat with rooms in the nearby (and wornout) D4 hotels going for the same price.
I will most definitely be staying here again.",4,2014,12,13
222,"Luxurious, warm, very helpful","In Dublin for a work social night, It was great to come in from the cold to a toasty hotel (coal fire in lounge front room was still hot), and my hotel room was also very clean and pleasant.  There is a gated secure car park at the back, and they suggested i could leave my car there the next day while i walked around Dublin in the afternoon. I would return to try out the sauna in my room for longer, and the jacuzzi bath.   My stay was a surprisingly pleasant experience.",4,2014,12,09
222,Luxury stay,"Nice boutique hotel situated 15 mins walk from the shopping area in Dublin.
This hotel especially the suite rooms are beautifully decorated.
This hotel is perfect for a treat for someone.
The suite room which is a little expensive is worth paying for
The room comes with a jacuzzi bath on its own floor and four -posted bed.
This room has all the things a honeymoon suite has for half the price.",5,2014,12,06
222,Great experience,This hotel has an excellent location for events in the Aviva Stadium (10 minute walk away) or 3 arena. The atmosphere in the hotel is homely with a welcoming open fire in the front lounge.Secure parking is also an added bonus. The beds were very comfortable and the whole hotel was very clean with the staff being exceptionally helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay again for a relaxing experience.,5,2014,12,05
222,"Comfortable, Friendly, Convenient","I was in Dublin for one night for business. The hotel was closely situated to the Grand Canal Docks, excellent choice of nearby restaurants and close to many of the big businesses that occupy that area. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Customer service really can make all the difference. Lastly, the room was comfortable, the linens plush, clean and the water warm. The lovely stay was much appreciated.",5,2014,12,04
222,A Little Irish Charmer,"I stayed here in a single room when I was in Dublin to watch the rugby. It's in the perfect location for a stadium visit, just a short walk away from the local pubs and stadium.

The room was very clean and well put together. In my room I had a sauna (this was an absolute first!!), a spa bath in a great sized bathroom and a mini business centre. I also had a TV with an array of DVD movies to choose from. I didn't spend much time in the room but had I needed to I would have been well taken care of.

The staff were excellent very helpful and cheerful, they actually showed me to my room which I haven't had much before. 

I would definitely stay again if I was ever in need of accommodation in the area.",4,2014,12,04
222,Lovely warm stay!,"A charming hotel with lovely staff. Clean rooms, great location. When we arrived, we were greeted with tea and biscuits by the fire. The linen was soft, and the rain showerhead was a treat. I wish there was a Roxford Lodge in every European city!",5,2014,12,02
222,Good for One Night,"My wife and I had to find a hotel in Dublin for a night before our return to England on the ferry. This hotel was good for the night. The rate was reasonable. The young man who worked there, Stephen, I believe, made sure everything went well. The rooms are small but at this price level in Ireland  they all are. It is an unusual place and I likely would not stay here for more than a night or two. It gave off a strange vibe.",3,2014,12,02
222,"Great location, safe, and very helpful staff... oh, and cats!","My daughter and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge during our 4 days in Dublin. One thing my daughter spotted (almost immediately) were the neighborhood cats that noticed her when she was peeking out of our balcony and she was in love. Every morning she'd go out and visit with them (I swear it was one of her Dublin highlights). For me what I appreciated was the helpfulness of the staff (immediately after check-in they brought us tea), the 'power' of the wifi (great connection and after 2 days without wifi or TV that was a big deal to us! :), and the all around comfort of the rooms and how comfortable we felt walking around for dinner and to explore Dublin. We would definitely consider staying there again on another trip.",5,2014,12,02
222,A thoughtful hotel,"Big thing about this hotel was all the nice touches in the room, many of which I have never seen before in such an affordable hotel. UK-style and continental plug sockets, drinking water tap, DVD player and selection of films, beautiful bathroom- with, I am happy to say, a HUGE bath with jacuzzi jets in, very much enjoyed!

Only stayed here one night, but was very happy with it. Not far from Dublin port, relatively easy to find though the car park behind was not hugely obvious from the front, and was small enough that it might struggle to cope if quite a few people had brought cars. Room was fairly small, not sure if I booked the small one or not, had hoped for a four-poster but you can't have everything! Very clean and warm, nice generic decor. Only 10-15 minutes walk from Grafton Street and the centre of Dublin, even less to the more literary area around Merrion Square, which I would recommend exploring. Didn't have any food, breakfast seemed a bit pricey at 12 euro, which was a shame as it would have been nice to try. Man on reception was very helpful the next day with driving directions out of the city and across Ireland- mostly for talking us out of using the regional roads!

Would recommend this as an affordable luxury place to stay in Dublin, no hesitation.",4,2014,12,02
222,A lovely welcoming hotel,"I Have just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights it was booked through late rooms. Firstly the negative . We were promised a luxury room ,i was sent booking confirmation along with a picture of a lovely room with a four poster bed. Our room was somewhat different we were shown to room 119 which after looking at pictures I would say was one of the smallest rooms. We felt the bathroom was very small and difficult to manoeuvre round and in need of a re vamp . Bath was tiny only for sitting in not possible to lay out in it . No need to have a sauna in such a cramped bedroom a silly idea, have them by all means but not in such a small room. On a more positive note We had a six foot bed, tv ,DVD player and a selection of DVDs. The room was clean and very quiet. The hotel was lovely a very cosy lounge and a lovely fire lit all the time. Hotel was very clean . The staff were just great very helpful. We had breakfast every morning which was lovely a great choice and well cooked. I would say that nothing is too much trouble for the staff that was certainly the impression we got. On the whole I can find very little  to criticise about our stay. I feel we were misled about the room but I blame late rooms for that not the hotel. I feel sure if we had said we were disappointed they would have moved us. But we felt the hotel had done nothing wrong so did not ask. I have sent an email to late rooms as they are the ones at fault . Just to add if you want a good meal the old schoolhouse along the road is great and also the chophouse around the corner.",4,2014,11,30
222,Great warm welcome and with all the comforts you want!,"Our group of four arrived in the later morning on our first visit to Ireland.  After a nice, long, flight and then getting use to driving in Ireland we found the lodge without many problems.  There is a small free gated parking area in back.  Felt more like a B & B with the unusual layout of the rooms and narrow halls.  Not a turn off at all!  As we were there way early we had to wait in the sitting area which was nice and warm and comfortable.  Neat old room with a working fireplace and the internet.  
The two ladies working, sorry didn't get or remember your names, were extremely caring and helpful especially given one in our group was ill.  They tended to our needs and made sure we had what we needed and got the rooms ready in a quick time frame.  

My room I shared with my friend was very nice and clean and much nicer then I had expected!  Two single beds which were comfortable and a wall mounted thin screen TV with DVD player and about 15 movies to choose from.  There was also a dry sauna, never used it, and a mini fridge and fax machine.  Very good dark-out curtains and a tiny deck to step out on for fresh air.  The nicely tilled floor pattern in this little office area under the table was a nice touch too.  The well lit bathroom has a jetted tub as well as shower.  There was also a towel warmer which we didn't look into using.  After being up 30 hrs was happy with a great nights sleep, very quiet room.  
There is an extra door in the room prior to the bathroom and once you leave your room there was a short hall for two rooms and another door to the main hall.  Yes, they do have an elevator/lift which is nice.  I was also glad they have a flat sheet along with the heavy comforter as I like the options to be cooler and yet under a cover.

They have a very nice breakfast in the lower level which had a great variety of options and you could pay and have a hot breakfast too.  Outside the eating area are two quaint little restrooms.  At least the men's room was very tiny but neat.  Not a bad walk to get to many areas to eat or shop or drink.  
We ONLY had time to spend the first night here but we sure could have been happy staying here for several nights.",5,2014,11,29
222,"Excellent value, and the lap of luxury.","The Roxford Lodge Hotel was an absolute treat. My partner and I stayed in the executive suite and it was really spectacular for the price. It was luxurious, and fully kitted out. I really cannot recommend highly enough. The staff were lovely, and the location was excellent. Top marks.",5,2014,11,28
222,What a wonderful place!,"We stayed one night in the Roxford Lodge Hotel and from arriving were made to feel at home. The room was lovely, warm and with everything you could need for a night's stay; the staff were warm, helpful and gave us loads of advice about how to get to the O2 as well as best place to eat near there. The hotel was in a brilliant place, really quiet but with the main road at the front, free parking and a warm, comfortable room with fax machine, fridge, DVD players, DVDs and TV. We had a drink in the front room with a lovely warm fire before setting off for concert. The next morning we had a lovely continental breakfast and again were made to feel welcome and valued customers. I will definitely be staying here again for the area, price and welcome.",5,2014,11,25
222,Just what I needed!,"I hidden gem that had charm, parking, nice/helpful staff and a very comfy room with a sauna and whirlpool tub just for me!  Also had dvd player and movies... coffee brought up to the room (free) and good restaurant recommendations nearby.  I would definitely return.",5,2014,11,19
222,Excellent!,"From the moment we arrived we were well looked after by the very friendly and helpful staff.  Our room had everything we needed, including sauna and jacuzzi, the bed was extremely comfortable and everything spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was sumptuous, loved the fresh fruit, pancakes and maple syrup, the full Irish looked excellent.  We highly recommend Roxford Lodge and would stay again if we return to Dublin in the future.",5,2014,11,19
222,Unexpectedly Excellent,"Checked in here after a long and torturous flight from NYC via Boston. Was not expecting much if honest but was so pleasantly surprised. Right from the friendly check-in through to the 'reveal' of the room, the Roxford exceeded expectations. My room was at the rear of the hotel through the car park in a new block. Clean, spacious with an excellent bathroom, the room lacked for nothing. With great free WiFi and the added benefit of free tea and coffee, everything was spot on. And the icing on the cake is the quality of the breakfast which, while not included in the room rate, was freshly cooked each morning. Such a pleasant difference to the normal big hotel buffet rubbish. Location on the edge of the City (but super close to the Aviva Stadium) was first class. Transport links excellent. All in all, a hotel that I recommend most readily.",5,2014,11,18
222,Excellent,"Stayed here with my girlfriend over the night.It is situated in very guiet location , quite close to city cente. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived.The room was unexpected ( big bed, Flat Tv, jacuzzi ) and the best thing was the sauna in the room ...Went out for a nice dinner a couldnt wait to come back and try it. Definately would recommend this hotel for couples and people looking for good value for money.",5,2014,11,17
222,Super value and convenient location,"had cause to book accommodation for my Swedish business partner over the Oct Bank Hol weekend and really struggled to find accommodation at a reasonable price. Tried the Roxford lodge and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The room itself was a single, very compact but had all the things I needed. Off street parking was free which is great in the Ballsbridge area. Local restaurants all within walking distance. Breakfast was very substantial and good quality. Overall a very good experience.",4,2014,11,17
222,Top quality accommodation at affordable price .,"Very homely.cosy and warm,very friendly staff,who could not do enough for you,and plenty of excellent good quality food.location is fantastic,near RDS.AVIVA ,great bars and Restaurants,and within walking distance to city centre,bus stop right outside the door. Free safe car parking,just park up and forget about driving in a busy city .",5,2014,11,15
222,Friendly staff,"I stayed here with a friend for a 3 night break in Dublin. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Our room was clean and quiet, despite the hotel being on a main road.  When we came back to the hotel (and when we arrived) after spending the day sight seeing we were offered complimentary tea or coffee. Outside our room was a terrace with a small fountain and a table and chairs, in the summer this would be lovely to sit out on. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel which is very handy for getting into the centre of Dublin. The hotel is also within walking distance of the open top buses for a trip around Dublin, which we enjoyed despite the rain!",4,2014,11,14
222,treated like royalty,i have stayed here on a couple of ooccasions recently i stayed one night and was so impressed i went back the next weekend sauna and room and jacuzzi bath are fantastic additions. from the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly and helpful bringing us tea and coffee advising on restaurants etc.I couldnt fault the place from beginning to end and i will return many times hopefully in the future.,5,2014,11,14
222,Relaxing stay with easy access to everything!!,"I stayed one night with my sister in a twin room as we were going to the Ireland vs Sth. Africa game in Lansdowne Road/The Aviva. The staff were so friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. The room we stayed in was a perfect and complete with a sauna and jacuzzi!! What more could you want from a stay. The beds were comfy, the room was quiet and it was just the right temperature. Overall one of the best places we have both stayed and we will definitely be returning for another stay.",5,2014,11,12
222,Hotel with charm and a VERY friendly service,"I chose this hotel by chance, as I was looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights in Dublin. When I was shown to my room I was surprised by what I saw. More than a room, it was like an apartment, with a full bathroom, a small kitchen, a sauna, a jacuzzi in a mezzanine... and all for me! There was even a Nespresso machine with free coffee. I just could not enjoy all of the facilities in the room, but it was nice to have it. The bed was very confortable and the room very calm. Very well located for the place where I was going.
Finally, the service was very friendly and it was very nice discussing with them.",5,2014,11,11
222,Nice Hotel in good location,"Our family stayed at Roxford Lodge in August.  I was very pleased with the staff which was friendly and helpful with our various needs.  It is located in a relatively quiet neighborhood area (although on a busy street with a bus stop right out front which is handy) but it was walkable to the center of Dublin and there were plenty of places to eat in the area.
Our rooms were comfortable and roomy and the beds were nice.  Everything was clean.  The room in the basement didn't really have any charm but our room on the first floor had wood floors, a bay window, tall ceilings and lots of crown molding etc. that make the old houses so charming.  They offer a breakfast (for a fee) and while the food was good the service was a bit problematic.  There was one woman working (probably more in the kitchen itself but we're not sure) and she was very busy trying to keep the items stocked and taking orders, bringing the food, clearing the table etc.  She was very pleasant and was working hard but both times we ate there, it took us longer than we would have liked and sometimes other guests came and there was no room so they had to come back later or eat elsewhere.  Not a problem if you're not in a hurry but maybe something to consider if you have a plane to catch or want to head out quickly to see the sights.
We really liked the hotel but it is a bit pricey and I'm not entirely sure it is worth the splurge.  However, I have not stayed in any other hotel in Dublin so it might be right in line with the prices for what you get.",4,2014,11,11
222,"Great place, great people Stay 10/23/14 and 10/31/14","Reading the last reviews everyone is right on, perfect location, not in city center, but right next to, 15 min walk, harbor is about the same if not shorter,  bus stop in front and locals pub 5 min walk. The house itself is over 120 yrs old but with modern, spacious rooms and bath rooms, if you can, ask for one with an infared 2 person sauna, it rocks!. The staff is AWESOME and everyone is so nice and willing to help you. We stayed their our 1st and last night out of a 10 day trip and we loved it. From the house keeper to the front desk, to the owner everyone was great!. The rooms were great but the staff really gave it the bling!  A Special Thanks to Stephanie, Stephan,  Agnes, Dennis and Anthony! You all ROCK and I told them that we appreciated them so much and how they took care of us that if they ever come to the states they can stay at our house!",5,2014,11,09
222,Wonderful place that is close to the center,"We stayed five nights in this lovely hotel! 
The rooms were very comfortable, clean and well equipped. Breakfast was rich and each and every member of staff was very obliging and friendly. 

Would have given a rating of 5 however there was some construction going on in the building preventing everyone from having a nice little evening nap due to very loud noise. Nevertheless it was a great place to stay in and for a place to stay a nice place some groundwork needs to be done .",4,2014,11,09
222,enjoyable stay,"i stayed here with a friend 4 nights at the beginning of October. the staff were really helpful and kind. having tea in the afternoons in our rooms was a wonderful treat. the common room is charming and use of computer there was very helpful to send our husbands updates. we walked to the city core and had no trouble navigating our feet around Dublin. the breakfast is wonderful. we had full Irish breakfasts every day, which were lovely, but i think the regular would easily have sufficed. we had a front room above the entry. the windows kept the noise out, and the beds were very comfortable. the room even had continental plug ins, so my friend from the Netherlands could plug in directly. this is a charming simple place and i would return any time i had the chance. also the bus to/from the airport stops just up the street. easy to get to!",5,2014,11,09
222,Good bargain close to city center,"Spent three nights here.  Much less expensive than hotels in city center.  Only a 15 minute walk to downtown.  There is a bus stop right out front if needed.  Parking in rear of hotel.
Good breakfast,  Our server was Agnes and she was delightful.  Front desk staff  very helpful as well.  Our room was a bit small with a king size bed.  Interestingly if had a one person sauna in it that we did not use.",4,2014,11,06
222,Great stay,"Excellent, friendly small hotel away from the chaos and noise of the centre of Dublin. Easy to walk into the city or regular buses outside the hotel. Good breakfast, with lots of choice. Excellent eating and good pubs 5 minutes walk from the hotel.",5,2014,11,01
222,Nice but don't stay in the rooms in the car park.,"The Hotel was in a great spot and easy to get into central Dublin. The staff were helpful and recommended lovely places to eat in the area. The only negative was the room, whilst beautifully appointed you were next the lane way at the back, past the car park.",3,2014,10,26
222,5 night stay was all to short!,"How many ways can I say AWSOME!!!!!!! We did not want to leave. The staff was Fabulous!! Helpful and kind.  Thank You Stephanie, Anthony, Stephan, Agnes and Dennis!!! Breakfasts were very generous and cooked to order. They were  helpful with some of my dietary needs and that was appreciated. There is a nice common room with a fireplace, period furnishings and a computer for guest use at no charge.  Our room was 122, an economy double on the 3rd floor. It was small, as expected from the description, but charming and well equipped. The shower/Jacuzzi tub combo was nice with rain shower head.  There is an elevator if you do not want to take the stairs that is rare in an older building like this. The location for us was perfect. It is in a very nice part of town near embassy row. It’s on a beautiful tree lined street and the bus stop was directly in front of the hotel.  We are already planning our next trip back to Dublin and will want to stay here again!!!",5,2014,10,23
222,Nice and comfortable,"Just returned from a 4 day break at the Roxford Lodge.
We liked the fact that it is not right in the middle of the town so nice and quiet. But easily accessible by car.
Rooms were neat, ours had a fridge too.
Bed was nice and comfy.
Staff all seemed very helpful and knowledgable about the local area.
We will be back!",4,2014,10,23
222,Comfortable Weekend,"The location in the Ballsbridge area was close enough to be a short cab ride away from anywhere you would need to visit around Dublin. Green and quiet I much preferred it to the busy city. Small but nicely set out room, we slept well and looked forward to the Irish sized breakfast. Genuine, friendly staff helpful without being gushing. This was a good idea.",5,2014,10,21
222,Nice short stay,"I had to find a place last minute and was glad to find the Roxford Lodge. It is a transformed older, yet lovely, home. It wasn't too far from UCD where we were visiting our son and close enough to walk into the city if wanted. We needed a place with parking and it was not only on premises, it was free! (Beware, you have to go into the alleyway behind it to get in...my request to staff is to put numbers on the key pad...we had to guess them and one number was also sticking so it took 3 tries for the gate to open, I forgot to mention that to the very friendly staff!)

We arrived later and walked, per the receptionist's suggestion, to the SchoolHouse place for dinner and drinks (wonderful by the way). We left early so we didn't have breakfast there at the hotel.

I only looked at the reviews here before going, not the pictures. Now that I see all the lovely rooms shown, we must have had the step child's room in the basement LOL. (Im sure we got the last room with booking last minute). Our room was VERY small and the decor was much older, not what I expected for $100 Euro. We also had to close the curtains in addition to the shade to avoid the colorful LED garden accent light outside our window, too. There is no need for a fax machine and we would have preferred more room to spread our stuff on the small desk (closet and floor space was minimal in this small room). The small dry sauna was a hoot and my husband did actually enjoy it...it did take a while to heat up though. The room was certainly clean and adequate and we were happy to have it on that Friday night.

For a last minute stay it was fine, we were happy to find a place where we needed it. With a better room I would definitely come back here. There was another lively pub right around the corner, too, and it truly seemed to be walking distance to all the great areas downtown. Add in the free parking and I'd say it's a great place to stay.",4,2014,10,19
222,Great Hotel!,"Our room was nice.Our bed was a queen,comfortable.Room had a fridge,a major convenience in any hotel room anywhere.Room was average size for Europe.Bathroom was nicely appointed too!Hotel needs to decluter rooms,ours had a fax machine and a sauna.Personal service was excellent,arranged early morning cabs to Huston Station to catch our Irish Rail Tours.Location is good,20 minutes walk to the Temple Bar District.Hotel was close to a cluster of good restaurants within 5 minutes walk,which were recommended by the front desk people!The price was within the range you can expect to pay for this quality of hotel ,in this location,in Dublin.We would recommend this hotel without hesitation!",4,2014,10,17
222,Hotel feedback,"The service in this property was outstanding!  While my room seemed rather small at first, it seemed to have most comforts I needed.  Very clean, fast service and quiet, thank you!  I had a tough week in Dublin and knowing that you had a comfortable and cozy room to return to every night was very much needed!",4,2014,10,10
222,Very Nice Stay,"We stayed two nights here. As others have commented, it is close enough to walk into the main areas of town while maintaining a quiet atmosphere.  It is a lovely home that has been converted to a B and B. Everyone working there was very friendly and helpful....and they didn't flinch when we arrived very early in the morning to drop off our luggage. (6AM!  Our flight was 45 minutes early...whoever heard of such a thing!).  The Roxford provided us with a good start to our trip.  We had the triple room downstairs toward the back....it was big  and was quiet.",5,2014,10,01
222,Lovely stay in quiet part of town,"The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. It is located in a more quiet neighborhood, with quick access to the heart of Dublin, either by walking or by bus, which is right in front of the hotel. We would recommend schoolhouse restaurant and bar, located just down the road. Free parking coffee and tea, what's not to love?",4,2014,09,30
222,"Great room, with a huge breakfast","Close enough to the city centre, but in a quiet location. Great breakfast, and very friendly staff. Excellent value for money! You can ask at reception to borrow from a library of DVDs. Room had a small individual sauna which we didn't use, but it's the first time I've seen that in a hotel room!",4,2014,09,28
222,"Terrific Staff, Quiet and Convenient","Quiet location in walking distance (15 minutes or so) from downtown locations; room was clean and cozy; staff was over-the-top helpful and answered our many questions, providing thoughtful and useful suggestions; breakfast was very good and the service was excellent.",5,2014,09,26
222,"Comfortable, clean and quiet","The 20-minute walk or short bus ride into the city centre is a very small price to pay for this pleasant and comfortable hotel in Ballsbridge.  The room was small but well equipped and breakfast was delicious.  We had cost of breakfast included in our room rate (by mistake as it turned out, but the hotel honoured it) which made the whole stay very reasonable.  I would certainly recommed it.",4,2014,09,22
222,Good place for a fast trip,"Everything was ok, the hotel is quite near the city centre. The room was little but with every confort. A very powerful Wi-Fi signal in the room thanks to a dedicated personal router in it.
I advice for breakfast to try the ""Full Irish Breakfast"".",4,2014,09,22
222,Yup - loved it!,"After arriving from California - to arrive at this friendly hotel was pure joy!  Easy registration, help to the room, we were ""below ground"" but still able to see the lovely flowers out of our window - but best of all was the service!  Yes, the room was small - but clean, with all that we needed to spend our ""indoor"" time - we did not come to Dublin to stay in a hotel room!  Breakfast was HUGE.  Service was exceptional - we kept missing friends staying (poor them) in another hotel.  That other hotel never delivered any messages...but at the Roxford,  well, a very complete message was taken and left at our door - so we were able make contact!",5,2014,09,21
222,A Nice Place to Stay!,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for three nights before embarking on our tour of Ireland.  As everyone indicated in previous posts, it is a 20/25 minutes walk into the city but is a leisurely and easy thing to do.  We love to walk so it was not a problem for us.  Ballsbridge is a beautiful neighborhood and if you have time, I would recommend walking around the streets nearby where the various embassys are located. 

There are nice pubs within a very short walking distance for eating and drinking.  We did not have breakfast at the lodging but walked to a local coffee shop for coffee and danishs.  

As most US flights arrive early in the day and only allow 4 - 5 hours of sleep in the plane, I would recommend renting your room for the night before to insure that when you arrive you can go immediately to your room to get a few hours sleep.  We arrived at 7:00 a.m. - slept until noon, showered and were fresh for an afternoon and evening of enjoying the city on the day of arrival.  Our traveling partners did rent a room for the night before.  Instead they opted for a walk, a snooze in the hotel lobby chair (with many others)  and were exhausted by the end of the day. I believe we made the better choice.  

Our particular room was located in the back of the hotel.  It was a small room but served our purpose.  My only complaint is that we had a sliding glass door and I missed not having a window to open at night. I enjoy fresh air.  The other couple we were with had a lovely room in the front (also small - but nicely appointed) with windows.

As everyone stated, the staff were very accommodating and really helped make our stay extremely enjoyable.  They recommended and made reservations for us for a tour through the Wicklow Mountains and always offered tea, coffee and cookies whenever we walked through the front door.  It doesn't seem like much but trust me, it was a welcome touch after a long flight or a day about town.",4,2014,09,21
222,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights in July. I can't fault anything about our stay. All the staff were helpful and the rooms were lovely. The full Irish breakfast was amazing! They do the best bread I've ever had. The location is ok, it was a 10 minute walk to get into the main part of Dublin. We would definitely recommend staying here and would come back again. ",5,2014,09,19
222,A bit eclectic but great place to stay,"We recently stayed for 2 nights at the Roxford and can't say enough good about it! It's a bit funky - our room had a sauna, bar and saoaking tub on the second level. Great location in a great section of Dublin. Room was clean, clean, clean which is important to me.  Beds were super comfortable.  Breakfast was lovely.  Delicious food and the gal who waited on us was soooooo nice. I'd highly recommend and hope to stay on my next trip to Dublin. ",4,2014,09,19
222,Lovely hotel in great location,"3 of us stayed in a treble room which was a decent size with a lovely shower/bath en-suite. The hotel situated in a lovely quiet area and is just a 20 minute walk from temple bar (or a 7euro taxi journey), 2 minutes from a very nice pub on the corner and has easy access to the Aviva stadium. The service is good and breakfast was very nice. If I visit Dublin again, I'll be staying here.",5,2014,09,18
222,BEING CODDLED,"We stayed three nights and were delighted. The owners took care of us far beyond expectations. Continental breakfast was wonderful, room comfortable and place very clean. The recommendations were as described. The location makes it easy to tour and pub crawl.",5,2014,09,15
222,Nice boutique hotel in quiet area,"We had a nice stay here. We had 3 adults in a room so it was cozy but the staff was friendly and helpful, the breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the rooms were well appointed. It's a bit of a walk from downtown and it was nice to get away from the crowds.",4,2014,09,10
222,Close to ferry port in residential ,Nice place to stay.  Room was a bit small but nice furniture.  Bathroom very nice and clean.  Nice to have a TV with quite a few channels and dvd's in room. In a quite residential which means not a lot of eating options close but we managed.  Expect to walk a bit to get to things.  Staff were nice and helpful.  One complaint is lots of stairs up to front doors which only after dragging suitcases up did they tell us upon checkout we could leave through the service entrance at street level.  Even with the lift inside we had to drag suitcases up and down 5/6 stairs.  Not a bad place just a little too far off the beaten path for our taste. But we picked here since it was close to the ferry port for our last night in Dublin.,4,2014,09,10
222,"Great Location, Great Staff","We took a cab from Dublin airport for 22 euro. The cabbie treated us to the royal tour and gave us a wonderful overview of the Dublin area. We gave him a generous tip and he said it was too much! 

We booked a luxury double for 3 nights in August.
The neighborhood is tree lined and in walking distance to some good restaurants. 
I would not say our room was ""luxury"" material. It was on the small side for us. Not really much room to put your clothes. We emailed ahead and told staff we would not be in need of a sauna, and did not have one in our room. Our tub/shower was pretty high stepping in and out of. Our room faced the street, but we were never bothered by street noise. 
The hotel is spotless. You are offered tea and coffee at any time. There is a small stock of wines and beers and staff delivered it to your room or parlor within minutes. The prices were very good.

The breakfast room was our highlight every morning. The room matron, Agnes, was delightful. We enjoyed her immensely and looked forward to conversations ranging from politics to a U.S. riot in St. Louis, weather, and the hop on, hop off bus driver coming by too early for people wanting to take it, which is true. The room was chock full of juices, fresh fruits, cereals, beautiful scones and pastries. Then there's the full Irish!

We enjoyed the hospitality of Desmond and the evening gentleman, Anthony. 

There are 2 places of note close to the hotel. We had cocktails the 3 evenings we were there at The Schoolhouse, on the walk back from town. Up the street, we ate twice at The Chop house.(Recommended by hotel) Excellent food and service. The steaks are presented on a huge tray, and seafood perfectly prepared.

We enjoyed our stay at Roxford, and would ask you when visiting Dublin, to give it a go. The staff are the best, and we thank you kindly.",4,2014,09,08
222,Nice residential location ... walkable distances to sights ... good value,"The hotel location is close to city center in a nice residential area ... classic architectural style for main building.  Secured car park in rear of property off of alley.  We stayed in the new annex building in rear of property (off alley) ... there are two rooms in the annex.  Check in was a little inconvenient due to the registration desk in the main building, off busy street, and the path to get there (but there is an elevator).  At first, we were disappointed to find out that our room was not in the main building ... but soon appreciated the private entrance to our room, proximity of car to room, and easy access to alley.  The room had the latest modern amenities, nicely furnished, large bedroom and nice bathroom (with jacuzzi tub).  The AC worked well, as well as the wifi.  About a 15 to 20 walk to major sights, nightclubs, shopping, and restaurants (can walk through a couple of city parks if you choose to do so ... also cross over the main canal).  The room was very quiet and comfortable.",4,2014,09,03
222,Groundfloor nightmare,"Having prepaid a one-night stay at the Roxford Lodge, I arrived early to be told I was confined to a ground floor single room. Indeed, I could not get my money back and had no other choice than accept the punishment.

The door to the outside parking lot banged loudly next to my room every time someone used it - the last person came in after midnight, and the first one out left before 6am.
I could hear anyone using the bathrooms on my floor as well as the one above, which made for distractions when the parking door was quiet.
The room had the feel of a prison cell, with a small window up the wall to give a narrow view of the grey sky.

I am obviously relieved that I did not stay longer, but would assume that rooms above ground are modern and comfortable. It just felt unpleasant to be given the very worst room in the house, because I had paid in advance and was probably a passing visitor in town.
",2,2014,08,31
222,"Good value, quiet and convenient","A stay in Roxford Lodge Hotel will bring you excellent value with minimal compromise on quality.  From here it is a short walk to St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College and most of the other tourist sites in Southeast Dublin, and if you are headed north of the Liffey, the bus stops across the street.   You won't quite be in the thick of things, but you also won't be besieged with noise or traffic as you will find in the city center proper.  The Hotel is on a lovely tree lined street, the rooms are nicely appointed, and the staff for the most part (one unpleasant woman was a notable exception) very friendly and helpful.  Tea, coffee and biscuits are available at any time of day either in the lounge, which feels very much like the sitting room in an elegant Victorian home, or else by delivery to your room.  We stayed in a triple on the ground floor and it was among the very nicest accommodations we enjoyed in over a month travelling through Ireland and Scotland.  The room was very thoughtfully designed, immacutely  clean and comfortable, and made exceptionally good use of space, so much so that it almost felt like two separate bedrooms.  Glass doors led to a small garden (which unfortunately abutted the parking area).  The room included any number of amenities including a small DVD library, excellent lighting (those who are well travelled will appreciate that by comparison many hotel rooms are dimly lit), a desk with a printer, and so forth.  Unless you absolutely must be in the city center, or are in search of a large establishment with health club and the like, you simply won't find a better value inn a safe, fashionable part of town. Highly recommended!",5,2014,08,30
222,Beautiful,"Beautiful hotel in a very pretty street, parking was very secure. Within walking distance to some fantastic restaurants. We had a triple room which didn't leave a lot of room for suitcases, the Saunas take up so much space and we never even opened ours up. The spa bath was fantastic and the rooms are very clean. Breakfast was fantastic, best continental we have had so far in our trip!",4,2014,08,25
222,Perfect stay,"Warm and friendly hotel in a quiet location a short scenic walk along the canal from Dublin city centre.
Rooms exceptionally well appointed ours across the courtyard 5*luxury.
Breakfast is not to be missed our first experience of a full Irish
No need for lunch after that.
Fabulous home made pastries and scones too.
Very friendly staff would 100% recommend staying here when in Dublin 
  ",5,2014,08,24
222,Attention to detail in D4,"Recently had the occasion to seek accommodation for visiting guests to Dublin - although their budget was limited, their expectations of standards were not and they wanted the very best within walking distance of Dublin city centre - the search began and I settled upon Roxford Lodge hotel in D4.   the service offered was absolutely exceptional and the personalised care and attention could only be found in a family-run enterprise.    The rooms, though not very large (we booked singles) were exceptionally well made-up with unusual details like a sauna in one and a jacuzzi in another!   the noise level were very low so good sleep and peaceful atmosphere was assured.    Desmond also went out of his way to provide extra facilities when required, like afternoon tea in the private lounge, recommendations for an excellent meal only 5 minutes away and touring suggestions & reservations    
So well done to the operators of this delightful hotel in D4 and thanks for giving us a new home from home to offer our guests in Dublin!",5,2014,08,19
222,Wonderful stay - Executive Suite was well worth it!,"My wife and I stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon. The service was wonderful (they let us check in at 10 AM after our flight got in, when normal check-in was 2 PM), and even brought us tea when we first arrived. The Executive Suite was well worth it. For a slightly higher, nominal price than an ordinary room, the suite came with a four-poster king sized bed, a jacuzzi, sauna, mini bar (with a complimentary bottle of wine - red or white - and a complimentary box of Belgian chocolates), a private use desktop computer and printer, a full kitchenette (range, minifridge, full-sized sink, dishwasher, etc.), and a balcony. Admittedly, the balcony isn't the greatest view, but it is comfortable. All in all, the suite was well worth the price.

The one downside is the Roxford Lodge isn't terribly convenient getting to or from the airport. The hotel has a flat-rate €25 agreement with cabs to get you to and from, and they run all hours, but aside from that, you'd be taking the bus. On the upside, the Roxford is a convenient 15 minute walk from downtown, and there's a mainline bus stop right in front of the hotel that takes you downtown in 5-6 minutes.

The Roxford Lodge was as fantastic stay, and I would recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2014,08,17
222,Average,"The quality/price rate is average, the room n°106 was really small (even if furnished with a sauna). The position is not bad, cause you can reach the town centre in 15 min. by walk or  5 min. by bus. The staff is really kind. ",3,2014,08,16
222,My Best Hotel Experience in 10 Years,"When in America, I stay at the Ritz-Carlton. When in Ireland, I stay at Roxford Lodge Hotel. The service is excellent. Not only is the service excellent, but the hotel is located in the best area of the Dublin, in Ballsbridge. Ballsbridge is just a short walk into Dublin City Centre, yet staying in Ballsbridge offers the luxury of Dublin's most exclusive area. The rooms are newly and freshly renovated, and the hotel mansion is impressive. The Irish breakfasts were the best meals we had in Dublin.",5,2014,08,16
222,Great find,"We have stayed here four times and its lovely, the rooms are fab with a sauna in our room, private secure parking and really unique hotel. Its refreshing to stay in a hotel thats clearly run by people who enjoy their job as its so friendly and welcoming. Very reasonable price wise too. Its our first choice when visiting dublin ... love it keep up the great work :) ",5,2014,08,15
222,Excellent Service & Clean Rooms,"We rented two rooms while visiting Dublin and this hotel exceeded our expectations.  The attendant was very helpful.  She called to make reservations for us to do a pub crawl tour, she highlighted routes on the map so we knew how to get where we needed to go, and ordered take out for us.  The full Irish breakfast was amazing.  The matron of the dinning room was very friendly and helpful.  The showers were the best we've had in Ireland.  The hotel had free parking too!  I would highly recommend this hotel for all of the reasons above.",5,2014,08,12
222,Amazing room for a great price,"I recently stayed in the executive suit with my boyfriend for one night for a special occasion and we were both completely over the moon with everything! The room was not only huge but had a hot tub, sauna, big comfy bed and more; all for a very affordable price. The service couldn't have been better. I would highly recommend it to couple looking for a nice get away together, you won't be disappointed!",5,2014,08,10
222,Great Value Hotel in a lovely location,"We stayed here for a long weekend on my birthday, having made the decision to book it primarily based on the price, which was very reasonable compared to other hotels. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room, although small was very comfortable. The neighbourhood was lovely and we enjoyed walking around the very grand houses. We walked everywhere and found it manageable although we definitely covered a fair few miles! We didn't eat breakfast here as there were too many brunch places on our list to try to be restricted to the hotel. I would definitely recommend the hotel as a good value base for exploring Dublin. ",4,2014,08,10
222,roxford lodge review,"great hotel ,couldn't recommend it enough . stay here every time in the area ! really friendly and helpful staff. so accommodating . lovely rooms and hotel really comfortable . food is super . lovely breakfast menu approx.8 mins walk from RDS . really reasonable  prices ! well worth every penny !   
EXCELLENT !!",5,2014,08,08
222,Perfect dawn and john Paris,"This is the perfect location , ten to fifteen minutes from the city centre. We got to the hotel later than planned and were received with a very warm welcome the lady agnus was a lovely lady and was full of the Irish charm, what a wonderful room we stayed in 119 it was clean and quiet spacious the sauna worked really well as did the jacuzzi bath😃😃 tea coffee facilities were perfect ,as was the tv , DVDs . The decor of the lodge was quite inspiring especially the feature in the dining area. Me and my partner will definitely be staying there again on our return to Dublin 
 Ps thanks for making our stay a pleasent one👍👍👍👍👍👍",5,2014,08,06
222,"A few hiccups, but overall a very nice place to stay","We booked the executive suite during our stay here and was quite surprised at how spacious and appointed the room (apartment) was.  Kitchenette, multiple TVs, a large bed, sauna and a wet bar all awaited our use.

The hotel is located a 10-15 minute walk from downtown Dublin, which suited us fine.  Close by access to bus service is also a plus.

Breakfast service was simple, but tasty.  Eggs to order, pastries, meat and cheese were available with fruit and bread and included in the price.

Our only complaints were with regard to access to the amenities.  The top floor can get quite warm and while an air conditioner was available, it was not operational...further, it took multiple days to get staff to acknowledge this.  Multiple requests to obtain a fan were not fulfilled -- we finally gave up asking.  It took multiple requests to get the sauna working, and the washer/dryer combo, while a great touch, barely dried out our modest load of clothing after four hours.

All in all, the room we got the value we sought for the hotel.  A little more attention to maintenance to ensure the room lives up to the amenities will make this an even better value to the Irish traveler.",4,2014,08,05
222,Comfortable hotel,"Stayed here for three nights on business. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was nice and quiet, and very clean, although the bathroom was slightly on the small side, with not much space to put things down. 
A good selection of DVDs were available in the room, but I didn't get a chance to watch any of them!
Great breakfast selection - had the cooked breakfast one morning and continental the other two mornings. Lovely fresh fruit salad with proper fruit (not tinned!)
Would stay again if I needed a hotel in the same area.",4,2014,08,02
222,Lovely neighborhood but paper thin walls,"The location is great. It's not in the heart of central Dublin, but definitely within a 15 to 20 minute lovely walk. It's in a quiet and quite quaint residential neighborhood. If you don't want to walk, it's easy to catch a taxi or hop on the bus right in front of the Inn. The rooms are small, but nicely appointed. However, the walls are paper thin. I could hear the person in the next room sneeze and clear her throat. The staff are quite nice, but the Inn definitely would benefit from an investment in soundproofing. Terrific Irish breakfast though! Kudos for that!",3,2014,08,01
222,Comfortable hotel in good location very  close to local buses into Dublin,My friend and I stayed here for a long weekend to visit the WAFA exhibition and see a bit of Dublin. Very helpful staff and  clean and  well furnished rooms. A little out of the city centre but the bus stop is opposite the hotel and the buses run frequently to the city centre and exhibition hall.. Continental breakfast not included but available  at a reasonable price and served in a lovely dining room.,5,2014,07,31
222,Nice People Make This a Great Hotel,"Really a rather large bed and breakfast than a hotel, everyone at the front desk, the maid service and the breakfast room are so nice it makes this a great place to stay. Rooms are rather small.  Just two blocks beyond the Dublin line in leafy Ballsbridge, bus service takes you straight to the heart of the city in just a few minutes, although you can walk it in ten minutes.  Nice restaurants and pubs nearby too.",4,2014,07,30
222,Large triple rooms; comfortable stay,"We booked a triple room at the Roxford, which was surprisingly and pleasingly large. The hotel is located in Ballsbridge, which is a 30 min walk from the top of Grafton Street. Taxis, though, are relatively cheap (6-8 euros from the city centre; 25 euros from the airport) and easy enough to find. Walking south from the hotel, there are a bunch of restaurants and pubs about ten minutes away. I might prefer to stay closer to the city centre next time; however, I would recommend this lodge to anyone. ",4,2014,07,30
222,"Good Location, Spotless, Helpful Staff","My wife, two young adult daughters and I stayed for two nights in one of the family, en suite rooms.  Quiet and clean.  Beds were very comfortable. We had a room overlooking the garden/parking area.  Offstreet parking was easy to use though somewhat difficult to find the first time.  Concierge was helpful with touring tips and access.  Breakfast was not included but reasonably priced.  Service was great and friendly.  We enjoy walking so the 2 km walk into the heart of City Centre was perfect.  It removed us for the noise and crowds but was close enough to allow us to fully enjoy ourselves.",4,2014,07,27
222,Just ok,"My wife and I have stayed here several times now and our most recent stay was not as good as previous ones. Too much noise. In addition to the noise the rooms are getting shabby and in need of a refresh. For the money, it is not great value in my view. There is off street parking, which is handy though. I will stay somewhere else next time.",3,2014,07,27
222,Lovely hotel in quiet suburb,We loved staying at Roxford Lodge.  The hotel is in a quiet suburb within walking distance of downtown and shopping.  The restaurant is only open for breakfast - which was delicious - but close to the Schoolhouse Restaurant among others.  Would really recommend the Schoolhouse for dinner.  The room I was initially given was on the ground floor in the back and looked over the parking lot - a little too noisy for a light sleeper like me.  The staff were very pleasant when I asked for a different room and the one I was given was on the main floor and perfectly quiet and pleasant.  This house was built in the 1800's and was originally owned by an English landowner.  It has been remodeled and updated and was very comfortable and convenient.  The original parlor has been preserved and functions as a comfortable living room overlooking the street.  Bus stop is right outside.  Staff can arrange for taxis to the airport for a set fare.  The owner (whose name I did not catch unfortunately) was very nice and sent us home with a supply of Barry's Gold Blend tea which everyone seems to favor.  All in all a lovely visit and we will certainly stay there again next time we visit Dublin.,5,2014,07,22
222,Charming and a bit different,"After a more individual touch, we try to avoid chain hotels when travelling. Our first time in Dublin (and indeed in Ireland) we chose the Roxford Lodge based on TripAdvisor reviews. We found the location pleasant, just far enough out of the centre to be fairly quiet, but easy enough to access on foot (20-25 mins walk). They also have a very well-priced deal with a taxi firm for airport transfers.

The service was always friendly, although at breakfast perhaps a little confused- with some things which you were seemingly supposed to help yourself to, and others not. Also asked for white pudding and not black for breakfast one morning and received it the other way around. Having said that, these are pretty minor protestations, and the full Irish breakfast was in fact delicious (and for some reason also served with a slice of cucumber!).

We really liked our room, which, although one of the smaller ones, was well-equipped (with more plug sockets and light fittings than you can shake a stick at!) The tea and coffee is well stocked, and there are nice toiletries offered in the bathroom.

This is not a 5 star hotel, but it is charming and something a little different. Overall for the service and quality offered, the price is very fair, which is important to me as hotel's we looked at nearer St Stephen's green and in the centre were extortionate.",5,2014,07,18
222,Nice hotel with very nice staff,"I stayed here for a few days. My single room was very nice and comfortable. Berth room was modern and well lit and included a jacuzzi tub.  Staff was lovely and able to accommodate gluten free.  When they ran out of gluten free bread one morning, they sent someone to the store to ensure I had toast.  Very nice to have free coffee and tea available and excellent free wifi as well.",4,2014,07,09
222,Great Location but bad hotel,"Pros:
good location
safe location
secure parking
let us leave our car in parking lot after check out
Cons:
saggy bed
no space to put toiletries
narrow hallway
trash in hallways 
scary elevator
they feed wild cats
terrible lighting in bathroom
look like a scene of a 1970s murder mystery
came in our room while we were gone
creepy
front desk was never there(and i heard suspicious snoring in background)
when the front desk arrived they were not helpful or accommodating

I am very surprised by the good reviews. There is very limited pros that I can say about this hotel. If it was not for its location i would give it 1 star..

My teenagers told me that the hotel was terrible",2,2014,07,05
222,Nice hotel in great location,My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our first trip to Ireland . Nice hotel fairly close to downtown - there is a bus stop right outside the hotel . Our room was small but in a property like this in an old building that is to be expected - everything was spotlessly clean and the bathroom had a full size tub which was nice .Our room had a DVD player and a selection of DVDs too . The young lady at the reception desk was very friendly and helpful with suggestions and directions downtown .When we arrived Monday morning we were early for our reservation but they let us check in and even brought a lovely tray of tea and cookies up to the room .The hotel has onsite parking which is also a bonus - parking is a rarity in Dublin from what we saw .We did not eat breakfast on the property so I can't comment on that though the room had coffee and tea making facilities which was nice . Overall a really nice little hotel with friendly people - if we had more time in Dublin we would have stayed at the Roxford longer .,4,2014,07,04
222,Beautiful rooms and great location!,"We stayed one night at the Roxford Lodge Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet at night!  The location of the hotel was great - close to good restaurants in a quiet part of the city.
The staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast that we decided to pay the extra fee for was delicious!",5,2014,06,30
222,Great service,"I am writing this here on my last of 4 nights. Upgraded to the new rooms in the back and it's very nice. The best part is the service and the staff goes out of their way to help. This morning I asked if they had a DVD copy of Michael Collins and not only did they go buy it, they picked up a documentary on him as well. Wonderful service!",5,2014,06,27
222,Pleasant stay,"My husband and I stayed at Roxford Lodge for 3 nights.It was okay but the room was quite cramped, there was a ""sauna"" room within the room I would have preferred a usable space rather than sauna but that is probably just a personal thing. It was dark in the room and difficult to get to the window to open the drapes as there was a small table and chairs there and we needed to put a suitcase on the floor there too. Breakfast was pleasant with a small but reasonable choice. You can catch a bus easily into the city or walk if you like a good walk. It is in a pleasant neighbourhood which we enjoyed walking around. A nice shopping area nearby with some good eateries. Overall a nice stay but not wonderful!",3,2014,06,23
222,Enjoyed our stay.,"I enjoyed the Roxford Lodge, loved the big rooms and the Sauna.  Everyone at the front desk was incredibly helpful and the front room was very relaxing. Bus stop close by and really liked the neighborhood.",4,2014,06,18
222,It's OK,"Stayed at Roxford Lodge for two nights in June 2014. Single room, small and a bit strange as it has a sauna inside the room and I was afraid of using it. The window of the room is turned to the outside stairs of the hotel so I could never open the window, not even the curtains. 
The bed very confortable, good shower, free wifi with great speed and this was really important for me. The sauna occupies lots of space in the room and most of all I was afraid of increasing the temperature of the room by using it.
Continental breakfast was ok and the lady at the breakfast room is very attentive and nice. 
Everyone I met at the reception was always very nice. The hotel is not very close to the city main atractions but I easily walked (15minutes)
There's a bus from the airport (number 702) stopping really close to the hotel, no need to take a taxi.
There's a great place to eat very close to the hotel: The School house Hotel",3,2014,06,17
222,VERY overpriced and sub standard.,"More a guest house than ' Boutique ' hotel. Sub standard, small room and bathroom, all very dreary and in need of a good overhaul.

Very over priced, breakfast also not included.

All in all a total rip off!!",1,2014,06,17
222,Worked for us!,"It's not exactly in the center of the city, but if you don't mind a quick walk (15min) or using the bus it will be a great location for you. Our only problem was the parking situation at first: We arrived on a Friday afternoon of a bank holiday, and had been a little overwhelmed by Dublin traffic. Huge accident on the highway, but going back roads was almost just as bad. My husband ended up parking on the sidewalk while I ran in to try to figure out where he should park. The gal at the front desk was helpful in directing us to the back parking, and the rest of our stay was great after that. The bedroom we were in was a little dated in decor, but it still was nice. It was fun to have a sauna to relax in after all the hiking we had been doing! It has wifi and the staff was kind. No problems for us and it was a great deal compared to some of the hotel deals I saw for Dublin.",5,2014,06,12
222,Noise all night long!,"All I wanted was a good night sleep.  Instead, I was awakened throughout the night by a loud noise which sounded like a generator.  When I informed the hotel management about the noise, they acted as if I had fabricated a story.   I switched to the Camden Court hotel, which was lovely.",1,2014,06,07
222,Old Dublin Experience,"Recently stayed here for one night only to attend a sports event in the RDS which is just a few minutes walk. We had decided not to stay in a nearby chain hotel, which was a similar price, but to try a more local experience, and we were glad we did. The hotel,which I would describe more as an  upmarket guesthouse, is located in one of the most exclusive parts of Dublin, which I suppose justifies the high price.  I think the additional charge for breakfast is a bit over the top however- you expect to have breakfast included in this sort of establishment.  I wasn't sure that a sauna box in the bedroom was a particularly great use of space but I did like the 'wet room' style of bathroom, which suited the size. Also liked the patio doors opening to small outside space. Owners very pleasant and welcoming, all in all, a relaxing place to stay, and lovely for a stroll around the surrounding streets checking out the homes of the Great and Good of Dublin society!  Nice pub round the back too! ",4,2014,05,28
222,Quiet and Comfortable,"We Only stayed one night at The Roxford Lodge Hotel before catching the Ferry early the next morning.One of the most important features was the secure parking, with locked electric gates to the rear of the hotel. Our luxury room was to the rear of the hotel, overlooking the car park. It was very comfortable and whilst we did not use the sauna, the whirlpool bath was very welcome after a week of showers only(once we worked out how to use it!)
The receptionist was very helpful. We arrived at a busy time, with phones ringing, other guests requiring assistance, and she single handedly showed us to our room, organised a tray of tea, helped a French couple in fluent French and answered the phone. She helped us with directions to the ferry port the next morning, she was very efficient.
We walked into the city, it took about 15 to 20 minutes, but frequent buses run from right outside the hotel.
Would stay here again.",4,2014,05,19
222,Quiet & Relaxing,"The staff were lovely and really helpful. The room was great, I was pleasantly surprised to find it had a sauna. The bed was really comfy and the room was spotless. Only downside would be for non early risers. The room was next to the kitchen so you could hear the radio and movement around above your head. 

There is a good parking lot and it's quite close to town so you can walk in if you like or take one of the many buses or taxi's passing by. There's a cosy pub around the corner that serves a good pint of Guinness so you don't have to go far if you don't want to.

The staff brought in refreshments when I arrived which was a nice touch.",5,2014,05,14
222,Really enjoyed the Roxford,"We had a wonderful stay at the Roxford. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, everything was clean, and the staff were very helpful. The neighborhood is nice and a fit person can walk to the city center.",5,2014,05,13
222,"Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Staff, Wonderful Location","I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for 6 nights in April, at the end of a 3 week trip around the UK and Ireland.  It was the perfect choice after being on the road moving around a lot.  It is family run, and you are welcomed and cared for in a way that makes you feel like a special guest in a family home.  If I am in Dublin again, I would not even consider another hotel, Roxford Lodge would be my home base.  The hotel is lovely, clean and well kept.  It is in a lovely large old home from the 1800's, which has been converted into a hotel.

The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet and very easy to get anywhere you want to go on public transport.  It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the heart of the city center, and other neighborhoods full of great restaurants and pubs.  I walked along the river to the Shelbourne Hotel, which has fabulous bars and restaurants, definitely a place you at least want to have a pint or cocktail at.

I had a single room, room 110, which I highly recommend for a single person.  It has both a Jacuzzi tub, and a small sauna, shower with great water pressure in the spotless bathroom, comfortable bed, high ceilings, good wifi, there is a printer, DVD player with newer movies, set up to make tea and coffee, a small fridge, really everything you need.  They are very attentive, and will bring you a fresh pot of tea or coffee, with biscuits, anytime you want, and ask frequently if they can get it for you.  I got food poisoning while I was there, from a Thai restaurant, I was looked after like a family member by Lynnsie, she kindly checked on me, and brought me fluids to keep hydrated.

Everyone who works there, the family and their employees, are very accommodating and helpful, they happily help you with anything you need or want to do.  Agnes, was great helping me plan a countryside day trip, she scheduled my trip for me.  Anything I needed, they were on the phone immediately to set up for me, including a nail appointment, that Desmond tried to set up for me, calling several times, but it was Good Friday, and the shop was closed.  By the way, all pubs are closed on Good Friday, no alcohol is sold in Ireland on Good Friday or Christmas. 

They have a very good assortment for breakfast, whether you have the continental or full Irish breakfast.  Being alone, I would take breakfast in my room, but loved my early morning chats with the owner, when going down to the dinning room for coffee.

I was able to see their top floor suite, which is absolutely wonderful.  It is very large, with a separate office area, that included everything you need, computer, printer, good speakers for Skype.  It has a bar, large sauna, large Jacuzzi tub for 2 people in a separate area in the room, full bathroom, a balcony, full kitchen, including oven and gas stove, everything you would need to cook full meals. There is a flat screen TV, DVD player with lots of DVD's, and separate stereo. I was very impressed with the room, which can sleep 4/5 people, and they can supply a crib.  I took photos which I will include, they are not great, but you can get a good idea of the room.  The pricing is very good for this room, I was surprised at how well the pricing is for the hotel, with such a great location, and lovely building.

I loved my stay at the Roxford Lodge.  Thank you to everyone for making my stay so lovely!",5,2014,05,02
222,quiet and convenient,"have just returned from 2 nights in roxford lodge. Arrived at busaras and took taxi. About 15-20 mins at 10 euro which was very good. Room was ready and we settled. searched for sauna but we didn't have one.(:
We were on ground floor with patio opening onto garden.The door was locked and key missing so we didnt get out until next day when we asked to have it opened.
Walked into town in about 25 mins. Lovely area.Straight walk took us to trinity college. We then spent the rest of day getting lost in dublin, but we didnt mind.
had breakfast first morning which was lovely but for us was a waste of money as we are not big eaters in the morning. 
Bus into town from across road cost around 5 euros. Slightly cheaper second day.
when we were leaving were able to leave our luggage in hotel and then came back and staff ordered taxi.
We only saw the two girls in reception and the lady serving breakfast so we had very little contact with the staff to rate them. However they were all very pleasant.
Great big TV in front of bed with a great selection of DVDs which my children said were all very recent. So able to relax with dvd and glass of wine in bed.
Would stay again as quiet and convenient to city.",5,2014,04,25
222,Great access to Dublin City Centre,"Clean, business type hotel with great access to Dublin City Centre.  Walking distance to much of Dublin.  Small to mid-size bedrooms. Free, secured car parking.  Cannot comment about breakfast since we departed at 7 am.",4,2014,04,23
222,"Beautiful quiet location, wonderful staff","My husband and I stayed her for a long weekend and we had a wonderful time.  We were worried the location was too far from the city center but it was perfect.  Far enough away to be in a safe quieter area but easy enough walk and ever  easier bus ride (use #4 or #7) to the shopping district.  I highly recommend buying a ""freedom pass"" 3 day ticket which includes airport transfers to city center, all city busses and the green ""hop-on-hop-off"" bus pass, all unlimited use for 30 Euro a person total (for three days).

Staff was so helpful and welcoming, catering to our every need even a very early morning check in!  Breakfast is hot, made to order with various choices plus fresh fruit, cereals, scones and cheeses.  

I also loved the bathroom.  Great tub/shower combo with strong water pressure (very important to me).",5,2014,04,20
222,Just the ticket.,"Booked 3 nights away for a special birthday treat and on their suggestion they arranged a bottle of fizz and chocolates which greeted us on our arrival. Staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We were spoilt for choice at breakfast with extensive cooked and continental dishes all nicely presented and tasty. 

The room, which was spotlessly clean, had a private sauna and a jacuzzi bath and a huge comfortable bed. Ample tea and coffee making facilities also in the room and a small fridge for your use plus a safe, large TV and DVD player with several films. Our room (117) was out the back of the hotel and that was quiet - the Aviva stadium at Lansdowne Park could be seen from the window.

The hotel was situated to the south east of the city on the outskirts in a smart business/residential area. Dublin city centre was less than 30 mins walk and 15 mins by bus through the traffic and this was ideal for us after a busy day out because it was away from the hubbub and noise of city centre hotels.

Would definitely go back to Roxford Lodge again when we next visit Dublin.",5,2014,04,19
222,Welcoming and relaxed hotel ideal for Dublin city break,"A wonderful relaxed hotel, within easy reach of Dublin city centre. We were welcomed and invited for complimentary tea or coffee in the lounge, which was a beautiful wood panelled room. The staff couldn't be more helpful, recommending somewhere for dinner, finding menus for us to look at and calling around to book a table for us on a very busy Saturday evening. The room was well equipped and spotlessly clean. A nice treat to be able to have a sauna in your own room added to the relaxation. Breakfast was a continental buffet and full Irish cooked to order. The selection of the continental was good and cooked breakfast very tasty. My only criticism may be that the service at breakfast was a little stretched, even though the breakfast room wasn't particularly busy. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it for a base if every visiting Dublin and wanting a relaxing, welcoming hotel.",5,2014,04,14
222,Wet Mattress a let down,"When we arrived we were greeted with a lovely warm welcome and tea and biscuits in our room. The room was nicely decorated and had great facilities that is until we went to get into bed. I noticed that there was a wet patch on the left hand side of the sheet and a few black marks in the middle, we hadn't spilled anything so I found it odd. Upon further investigation (taking off the sheet and mattress protector) I discovered a larger wet patch on the mattress underneath.  When I notified the lady on reception I was greeted by utter disbelief and got the impression that she felt that we had done this. (Not possible as the patch on the mattress was larger than the patch on the sheet and the liquid was only starting to soak up through from the mattress). The bed was changed promptly and the mattress flipped. When the cleaner was changing the bed there were marks on the new sheet but she assured us that they were clean and put the black marked side face down , trying to explain that the washing machine doesn't launder the sheets completely. All the time  the response we kept getting from the receptionist was ""this has never happened before"" , ""we've never had this happen"", as if we were to blame. Not the way to treat your paying guests!!!Shall not return",2,2014,04,04
222,Warm and charming !,"We stayed here during St Patrick's day weekend and really enjoyed this place. The room was perfect with a comfortable bed, wifi, flat screen tv and modern bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and towel warmer. All the staff were helpful and friendly. In the beginning we walked into Dublin, but by our last day we opted for a taxi as we were running short of time. A taxi into center of Dublin saved time, only cost around 5 euros and the taxi drivers were fun to talk to.",5,2014,03,27
222,A warm Irish welcome,"This is an absolute gem of a hotel in the very beautiful Ballsbridge area of Dublin.We got a very warm welcome on arrival plus a tray of lovely biscuits,tea and coffee.Staff are lovely and go the extra mile.Its about 20 mins walk from hotel to town if you make a right coming out of hotel and keep walking straight .Will bring you to Grafton St..Rooms are 1st class.Warm and comfi.Breakfast is something else.You won't need to eat again until late pm.Italian connection is good to eat in just round the corner from Lw Gardiner St. Early bird is good from 5pm to 8pm and a free glass of wine. Would def recommend Roxford Lodge Hotel..",5,2014,03,17
222,Great Service - Very Comfortable,"i have stayed here twice recently and both times received a warm welcome and tea & biscuits, which was appreciated after arriving late.  The rooms are warm, I had a great sleep and great brekki the next morning.  Lindsay in reception was very friendly and helpful, an asset to any business. I would recommend without hestation and I will be returning there soon.",5,2014,03,15
222,A Wonderful Stay,"Me and my husband traveled from the U.S.   Arrived at this great little b&b march 9th and stayed a week in the suite. We had a wonderful stay. Room was very clean and there was no request I had that was not fulfilled. Lynnsie and Anthony were great and were always available to help me or answer my many questions. They also helped me with recomendations on what to do in Dublin as well as Lynnsie booked our tour to the cliffs of Moher .  Just great customer service and genuine kindness. There was not one staff member that did not smile. Oh If you are able to do a day tour while in Dublin, the Cliffs of Moher by paddy wagon tours is absolutly wonderful.",5,2014,03,14
222,Best kept secret in Dublin,we stayed at Roxford Lodge two nights March 7-9.Everything was wonderful from the front desk to the wait staff could not be more friendly or helpful.Room was large spotless clean with sauna also dvd .Breakfast which was included in price was wonderful full Irish breakfast also fruit and juice all served with smile.Anthony on the front desk is just great we booked our stay over the phone with him.If you need a cab to the airport hotel can arrange flat rate of 25e.Well worth the stay will definitely stay again .,4,2014,03,12
222,Fantastic small hotel in Dublin,We stayed at the Roxford Lodge on Feb 20 for two nights.  It was a great stay.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  Our rate included breakfast which was delicious. The lady who served breakfast was very nice.  The rooms are spacious  and the decor is very tasteful.  We had a personal sauna and jacuzzi style bath. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the heart of Dublin but the walk is very nice.  It is in a nice part of Dublin and there are some very nice restaurants and pubs within walking distance. We especially liked Juniors.  They have a room with a fireplace that we enjoyed spending time in after dinner each night with a bottle of wine.  I would highly recommend and hope to return some day.,5,2014,03,02
222,Quirky but no regrets!,"Stayed for 2 nights in this friendly hotel. Other reviews describe as ""quirky"" and they are right but don't let it put you off! Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble - offered everything we needed.... Give it a try - refreshing change from the sometimes soulless chains... Has a ""family run"" feel to it.",4,2014,03,02
222,Very charming hotel near the Center of Dublin,"Roxford lodge hotel is a small yet charming hotel near the center of Dublin. The rooms are small, but the beds are great. Nice touch was the sauna in the room (which was not used by us...). The room with the open fireplace was a great spot to return to after a walk in the rain from the restaurant. Restaurant ""the chop house"" just around the corner of the hotel is very much worth the walk!",4,2014,03,01
222,Quirky but very good,"I stayed here for 1 night last week.  I'd seen good reviews but you never know what you'll experience yourself when you stay somewhere.  

Its in a nice part of Dublin but not too far out.  We had lunch at Juniors sandwich bar and dinner at the Chophouse both of which were excellent.  They were also in walking distance.  

The hotel staff were very receptive and solved any questions we had and were quick enough to help us.  

I am a light sleeper and they got me into a quiet part of the hotel with no issues.  Ask for room 109 if thats what you're after too ;)

Its a different hotel that I will remember for a couple of reasons.  I had a sauna in my room and some flashing fairy lights above my bed.  Raised a smile when trying to turn the lights off at night.

As a review, I think you should roll everything up to score it.  Yes, there are probably smarter, more modern/chic hotels in Dublin but for the price and its individuality along with the staff I would have no qualms in going here again.",5,2014,02,25
222,Great stay!,"Stayed here a night last year for our aniiversary. Great time and really personalised stay. Lovely staff, lady who served breakfast in the morning from Mayo was lovely, very chatty and helpful! Room was lovely, own DVD selection, personal sauna and jacuzzi style bath. Great night's sleep after drinks on the town. Not too far away from the centre, about 9-10 euro for a taxi, cheap enough for Dublin standards. A definite recommend and would go again!",5,2014,02,19
222,Best small hotel in Dublin,"Excellent in every way possible. This quaint hotel is a real find and the best compliment I can give it is we intend to make Roxford Lodge Hotel our regular port of call when we visit Dublin. Spotlessly clean, professional and friendly and in a superb location.",5,2014,02,16
222,Very Good Value,"Second time I stayed here.  Very good value: clean rooms, nice location, very friendly staff.  Most rooms have a sauna - odd but nice touch.  My room also had a fax/printer and a dvd player with around 20 decent DVDs to watch.  Front den has a computer and printer for guests to use and hotel has free wi-fi.  Full Irish breakfast should only be attempted by extremely hungry people - portions are huge.",4,2014,01,25
222,theatre trip,"Easy access from the port tunnel this hotel was easy to find on a Friday afternoon. On check in we were shown to our room an shown how to use the bedroom sauna and jaccussi. We didn't even have to make a cup of coffee as this was delivered to our room with a selection of biscuits and were told that coffee could be ordered anytime free of charge. The room and bathroom were spotless and the bed real comfy and we had a small balcony overlooking the free secure carpark and a view of the Aviva Stadium not too far away. It was only about 15 min. walk to the Bord Gais Theatre where we were going to a show that night. After the show we stopped at Jack Ryans' pub which is only round the corner from The Roxford, a busy but friendly watering hole. After a good nights sleep we ventured down for a hearty breakfast with plenty on offer an cooked to order. All in all a good location, nice hotel and very friendly and helpful staff. Would have no problem staying here again.",4,2014,01,21
222,Awesome stay!,"Stayed here with my dad in two separate single rooms and they were both great! My dad's had a sauna in it! We arrived into dublin in the morning and had our luggage and we headed straight for the hotel. And just a short sit in the sitting and we were checked in! The beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was far more luxurious than I expected! It's a pretty quiet area which is nice, but it's not so far from sights that you can't walk if you like a bit of exercise. I was sad to leave after just one night. Will definitely stay here again when I'm in Dublin!",5,2014,01,16
222,snug dublin haven,"we recently stayed at the roxford lodge hotel in dublin's ballsbridge area. what a pleasure this little gem was!  we knew we were in for a little different experience, when we found free wifi, a tea kettle and a stack of dvd's to choose from in our room. we had a sauna and jacuzzi tub, and a little patio that opened up right onto the free parking car park. if you would like breakfast or dinner, it is available in their nice little restaurant. and there is a cozy parlor with a crackling fireplace and lots of books where you can curl up and watch the street with a cup of tea. trinity college and the grafton street area is about a 15 minute walk away, and there is a bus stop right in front of the property. the grounds are meticulously kept, and the staff very attentive and pleasant, offering any help needed. if you are looking for a restive little walk up apartment in the middle of busy dublin, look no further.",5,2014,01,10
222,"Great location, service, and bath!","Had a lovely stay in this very friendly little hotel. It's well priced and only a short (15/20mins) walk from Merrion Sqaure and the city. The service was excellent and they went out of their way to ensure we had a good stay. The ""whirlpool bath"" was a bit disconcerting at first, but a nice touch of luxury to a clean, comfortable room with balcony.",5,2014,01,10
222,"Excellent stay, great location!","The room was spacious, clean, the bed was firm, the service was TOP NOTCH! This hotel is a bit of a walk outside of Temple Bar District, but the it's not insanely far (and taxi rides are very inexpensive in Dublin). Besides, you don't want to stay in Temple Bar -- it's great for pub crawls, but the nights in the district can be very loud. This hotel was far enough to get a quiet night's sleep, yet still close enough to town. The staff is especially helpful and friendly! We were very happy here.",5,2014,01,09
222,Excellent choice for first stay in Dublin,"As a first trip to Dublin with our daughters aged 15 and 20, this was something of a guess, based on good reviews on this site and elsewhere. It is a nice walk, and not far, to the centre of Dublin, and there are bus stops right outside anyway. Quiet, pleasant location and attractive looking on arrival. Hotel was happy to put us in a family room (although our children are older than normally would be allowed) and we were pleased with the space  and cleanliness throughout. We had continental breakfasts for 6 euros each on 2 of the 3 mornings and there was a very good choice, and plenty to eat. Cooked breakfasts were 12 euros each, which was a bit expensive, although quality fine. Staff were very pleasant, in particular one young Irish man who was effortlessly helpful and friendly throughout, despite having to do a lot of extra shifts because others were off sick. Hotel was about a 10 mniute walk from Shelbourne Park, which was a great (if cold) evening out. Would happily stay here again",5,2014,01,08
222,Enchanting but perhaps a bit overpriced,"I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay here.  The house is absolutely beautiful, the facilities great and the staff were very professional, friendly, and so, so helpful.  Having said that, I did feel that it was a touch overpriced, but perhaps that is because my room, whilst large, was not the most practical layout. I have no idea if other rooms have the same issue.  It was kept very clean and it was very comfortable though.  I think it would be better value if perhaps the continental breakfast was included in the lower room rate.",4,2014,01,06
222,Excellent stay at a great price!,"It is not that far of a walk from the Grafton St area, Trinity College, and Temple Bar. This was my initial concern, but we walked it many times. I don't regret staying here at all and would do it again. My brother, friend and I stayed in a 3 bedroom that also had a very spacious bathtub and was handicap-able. There was a sauna in the room also but we did not use it. The room also had some movies and a decent flat screen TV.
Desmond, one of the family owners was tremendously helpful and nice. He was a HARD WORKER too and was there for 2 or 3 days straight. 
Breakfast is free and lasts sometime after 10AM. Typical breakfast but they also have omelets and a typical full Irish breakfast to order.",5,2014,01,01
222,Consistently excellent,"We chose this hotel initially a few years ago because it had saunas in every room (which is my idea of a good time - and why it's a luxury hotel, I guess, though they've taken some of the saunas out, unsurprisingly given the cost, I imagine...). Over the years, we've got to know the staff and their kindness and thoughtfulness each time has multiplied. We are always on a tight budget (until I write my bestseller, and even then I'll donate the profits to fighting poverty and environmental destruction!) but they seem to realise that and always give us an excellent deal, making us feel wonderful. The accommodation itself is in a beautiful broad street, gorgeous old fashioned buildings, but the rooms are immaculately clean and pleasantly decorated and the lighting in the bathrooms makes you feel like a movie star (the baths all have jacuzzi settings). The luxury suite is fabulous with a sauna with coals (all the others are infrared and much smaller) and an enormous round jacuzzi bath the size of a jacuzzi in a spa (and a bar, and a complimentary computer and printer). 
I would highly recommend this place to families with children, teens, business people, visitors to the city, or people passing through as we usually are. Breakfast is cooked to order or there's always fruit salad, cereals and cheeses for those who are not keen on having a hot meal in the morning. You can get out for some really nice runs from here, and it's really not far to walk into the city - and it's a pleasant walk, past parks and a museum, or up to Baggot Street where there are some nice shops. 
The verdict: stay here!",5,2013,12,29
222,"Friendly, calm and good value for money!","Very friendly and small place, with good value for money and all things there that you need. I wouldn't necessarily call it luxury, but a very comfy bed and clean, and good service. The bath was also clean and fresh. We booked very late so got a room at the ground floor, so probably nicer higher up. A good 10 mins walk to the city center, or ~ 5-10 EUR with a cab.",4,2013,12,19
222,Amazing,"Just got back from an amazing break in the Roxford Lodge. We stayed in the suite which was just fantastic. The four poster bed was so comfortable and massive and the two person jacuzzi on the top floor was perfect. The have a wide range of things to eat for breakfast, though we only ate the full irish as it was delicious. Everything we could ask for in a hotel and more. Room service was very accommodating and brought us up whatever we needed, like ice or more wine. Cannot say nice enough things about this hotel and staff. We will be returning whenever we come back to Dublin",5,2013,12,18
222,A Gem,"Our 5 days stay at Roxford was quite memorable. We booked a suite at Roxford and really enjoyed the services of this lovely hotel. Our suite was really spacious. The hotel itself is magnificent so the room and its tasteful décor and setting weren’t a big surprise. What were really touching were the welcome gifts which included a bottle of delicious, classy wine and chocolates (Absolutely yummy). To be honest, with such a warm welcome, it was difficult not to fall in love with the hotel immediately. The Jacuzzi was nice. Our room also had a balcony so we enjoyed the view. There was even a coffee machine in the kitchette which was a relief for us coffee addicts. This was a very nice, quaint 3 star hotel that did not burn a hole in my pocket without compromising on the services.",4,2013,12,18
222,"Lovely stay, not quite luxury","This is a lovely B&B, kept to a very good standard. I was so looking forward to our stay since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary;however there were some small details that didn't quite do it for me.

The room was well presented with much more than you could expect (individual sauna and jacuzzi in room) but the hot water was not working in the morning to take a shower! This made us loose about an hour, but luckily by the next day it was fixed. When showering the water was leaking onto floor, also not so good. Bed was comfy but might need a change of mattress soon. Breakfast was fantastic, loads of choice big and small so well worth it, the full Irish was tasty!!

Location is good, about 20 min walk from city centre, in a lovely neighbourhood. Also transport to and from airport dead easy with air coach.

I asked for some wine to be ready for us and manager Lynssie was so helpful and friendly.

Don't get me wrong, I would definitely stay again, and it's great value for money; unfortunately there were a couple of things I wish didn't have to deal with whilst on holiday!",4,2013,12,08
222,Great location for visiting the RDS.,"We stayed here 6/12/13. The overall experience in the hotel was good, the staff were really friendly and helpful and the hotel is only a 10/15 minute walk from the RDS, lots of bars and restaurants nearby and secure parking. If I am to say anything negative it is that the hotel has slightly quirky features that could do with being looked at by the owners. Our room had a mini sauna in it which was really not fitting with the room, it was a wooden box thing plonked in the corner next to the tv. Not a huge problem but just seemed very random in such a small room. Although our bed was very clean and comfortable, and the toilet and bath were clean,  the bathroom had alot of mould on the ceiling.
Breakfast was ok, although I don't eat pork and tailoring the cooked breakfast options was limited. 
This hotel has lots of character, and any of the small 'misses' are easily overlooked because the staff were so nice.",3,2013,12,07
222,"Friendly, clean and relaxed","The hotel has extremely helpful staffing, personal service and a friendly atmosphere - from we arrived until we left. The room was clean and had that ""touch"" that made the stay very nice. The hotel is situated only a short 20 min walk from the city centre. Our room was very quiet and airconditioned. All in all - a nice stay!",4,2013,12,03
222,This is a real gem,"This hotel is somewhat modestly labelled a three start but from the moment we arrived and were offered tea or coffee and ensconced in a beautiful Georgian lounge with coal fire, we were hooked.

Bedroom quality was punching well above its weight and the hotel scores well for location -just 15 mins walk into the centre- no hardship. Very friendly and helpful staff throughout.

We were here to watch the rugby just 5 mins walk round the corner, and I'm writing this awaiting transport to the airport, after the game, again with tea/coffee, long after we checked out today.",5,2013,11,24
222,Excellent!,"We stayed in Roxford Lodge Hotel two days ago. Staff was very friendly and very helpful. We stayed in a suite, there was a bottle of wine and chocolates included in the room, we did not know that at time of booking so it was a great surprise! Room was clean and we absolutely loved it! 
The room was large the jacuzzi tub and in room sauna were great touch. Plus there was a extra room  with computer and printer.
Balcony was bonus!
There was small kitchen, with amazing coffee machine.
Breakfast  was great! Loads of choose of! 

FREE parking at the back of hotel!
I stayed the following night in a 5 star hotel in Dublin, it was over twice the price and the room was less the half the size. If I had to chose between the Roxford and that 5 star hotel, I would pick the Roxford. 

I'm looking forward to saying there on next trip to Dublin.",5,2013,11,17
222,Certainly NOT a boutique experience.,Staff friendly. Breakfast very expensive. Room clean but not as expected from website. TV poor picture quality. Shower leaked. View was awful looked over a builders yard. Too far from city centre. This was supposed to be our wedding anniversary treat and we were very disappointed. Not as described on website and certainly not a boutique hotel. Stayed in nicer bed and breakfast accomodation for half the price.,2,2013,11,09
222,Great location!,"This hotel is off the between path, but an easy jaunt into the city center.  It's only about a 20 to 30 min. walk or 5 to 10 min. by the num. 4 or 7 bus. The staff is friendly and helpful. They recommended a day trip that was very nice and answered all my questions. Stayed here a week,  Thursday to Thursday. Would stay here again! ",5,2013,11,05
222,"Clean, Comfortable, Convenient","I stayed 4 nights in a single room at this hotel in October,while visiting Ireland along with my brother and sister-in-law. The rooms are quite small, and I found the inclusion of an in-room sauna somewhat puzzling. However, the room was very clean, with comfortable bedding, good heating and sufficient amenities (soaps, shampoo, body lotion, a kettle, teabags and instant coffee). The shower is in a bathtub, and the shower screen isn't entirely effective. The water takes some time to heat up. These are only minor negatives, though. The hotel feels very secure, and there is free (albeit cramped) parking available - a huge bonus. The breakfast was hearty and well cooked. I found all of the staff to be helpful and friendly. It's about 15 minutes of brisk walking to the tourist centre (Trinity College, Temple Bar) - not a problem when I was there, as the weather was ""mild"" for that time of year, but it would be a less comfortable distance if it was wet and windy. At a rate of around AUD115 per night, I felt that this was a good value hotel.",4,2013,11,03
222,Very pleasant and enjoyable stay!,"We arrived early at this pleasant hotel and offered coffee and biscuits instantly, which was a nice touch! Our room was in the basement overlooking a court yard, the room was more than adequate although quite small, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds we have slept on in a hotel.  The hotel was very clean and staff very helpful and knowledgable.  Breakfast was huge, fresh and delicious.  Location ideal with a bus stop right outside the hotel, 4 or 7 takes you to O'Connell  Street. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",5,2013,11,03
222,Love this hotel!,"I've been making an annual trip to Ireland for the past 8 or 9 years and always look forward to staying at the Roxford Lodge.  The owners are constantly refurbishing and upgrading their rooms and they are doing a fine job.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and their linens are top quality.  I love that they offer free parking in their secured lot at the rear of the hotel.  They also offer a variety of options for the included breakfast and each one is delicious -- fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, full Irish breakfast, french toast, cheeses, just to name a few items.  Ballsbridge is a nice, quiet area of Dublin and the American Embassy is just down the road from the hotel.  Staff is super gracious and very helpful.  They offered great suggestions for restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel.  They have a computer w/printer in the lounge which guests are free to use and complimentary wi-fi is available throughout the hotel.  A short bus ride takes you very close to Trinity College and Grafton Street, and the bus stop is right across the street from the hotel (if you take the same bus back, the stop is right outside the front door).  I've stayed at 3 other hotels in Dublin as well, and this one is far and away my favorite one, and the rates are very reasonable.",5,2013,11,02
222,Everything was great!,We stayed here for about a week in October. From the moment we got in at 5:30 am to the time we left for the airport we felt completely at ease and taking care of. My friend got really the sick the first day and the staff manged to check us in early and always asked how she was feeling. The room was very nice and big for European rooms. Plenty of space for two people including a sauna. They even give you DVD's to watch! The hotel in is Ballsbridge and is a bout a 10-15 min walk to downtown area. It's all one road and very safe. The neighborhood is actually really pretty and I recommend walking around a bit. You also get a good nights sleep due to little street noise if any. I would recommend the hotel to anyone and would be sure to pick it when I return!,5,2013,10,31
222,Stayed here over the Dublin Marathon weekend. Excellent,"This is a very nice B&B. Outstanding breakfast with service to match. We had a room overlooking the back parking lot. Very quiet. 2 double beds. Not a lot of room to move around with 2 suitcases open but adequate room. Very clean linen and bathroom. Our friends arrived 2 hours early to meet us and were welcomed with tea in a large sitting room with a fire. Irish manners are the friendliest in the world. Cab drivers were extremely friendly and kept trying to round the fare DOWN as I was rounding it up! These were not wealthy men, just very caring and warm towards myself and my wife. We stayed 3 nights and had no complaints about anything here. They have an agreed price for taxis to the airport posted on the door for guests. (23 Euros approx, I think.) 
Walking to the center of Dublin was about 15 minutes and we walked it every day, walking home in the dark every night. Never felt uncomfortable in the neighborhood. Temple Bar is a bit of a hike if you're not used to walking but ok. I would not trade the Irish B&B experience here for a traditional hotel. Our friends were just a number at the downtown hotel, not a treasured guest. We had already driven ourselves down the West coast, staying at a different B&B every night so we expected and received the same warm welcome in the big city of Dulin at this place as we had in the rural coutryside of the West coast",5,2013,10,30
222,Excellent Hotel,"This is an excellent hotel away from the city center in a quieter area of Dublin.  It is only a short 15-20 minute walk to the city center.
The room was large and very comfortable and the jacuzzi tub and in room sauna were welcome additions.  The front desk staff was very helpful and their restaurant recommendations were exactly what we were looking for.
This is probably the best hotel we stayed in for the 2 weeks we were in Ireland.",5,2013,10,29
222,Good Place to Stay,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for our first two nights in Ireland. We were lucky enough to be able to check in early after an over night flight. The staff was friendly. The room was clean and had everything that we needed. The location was a little bit of a walk to the highlights of Dublin, but we did not mind it at all. The hotel is in a nice neighborhood. I would stay here again.",5,2013,10,28
222,Good spot - Excellent staff,"We arrived at the Roxford Lodge at 11:00, well ahead of when we would have expected to be able to check in.  The desk clerk took us to the ""living room"" and brought us some tea and cookies which we enjoyed for about twenty minutes while they finished our room.  We were then able to check in, allowing us several extra hours in downtown Dublin.  Over the course of the next four days, the staff bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable.  We loved the breakfast a couple of mornings, though tour commitments did not allow us to partake on the other two days.  The room was clean, with everything we needed, and the wifi connection was excellent (something that doesn't always happen in a lot of places we have been).  If there is one negative, it is the location of the property.  It is about a 15 minute walk to the Lansdowne Road Dart Station, which connects to other Dart stations downtown that are still about 15 minutes from the center of town.  It is about a 25 minute walk from the hotel to the center of Dublin.  We bought a 3 day pass on Dart, but only used it on the first day, because it was faster to walk from the hotel than to take Dart.  I guess our real point is that public transportation leaves much to be hoped for from a tourist point of view in Dublin.  The bus system could be an option, but we did not consider ourselves astute enough to navigate this option.  Needless to say we got plenty of exercise in Dublin (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but enjoyed our stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel",4,2013,10,27
222,"Fabulous Service, Charming Hotel, A Slight Bit Outside of Town","I stayed with two friends in a triple room at the Roxford Lodge.  We were delighted with the front desk staff, who were helpful and generous with their time.  For example, when we arrived at 8am at the hotel, the front desk attendant set us up in the lounge and brought us coffee from downstairs.  She took care to ensure that our bags were moved to our room when it was ready.  When we arrived back later in the day, the then-attending front desk clerk showed us to our room and was delightful.  Best of all, their kind service did not seem at all aimed at getting a tip.

Our room was interesting.  It had two twin beds and a double bed, a small sauna, and a jacuzzi tub.  It definitely did not feel like a large commercial hotel, but instead a room created in the nooks and crannies of an existing building.  For us, this just added to the charm of the hotel and our great experience there.  

As many other reviews explain, the hotel is slightly outside of the main tourist areas in Dublin.  We found the distance easily walkable.",5,2013,10,21
222,Such a rare find.,"I only picked the Roxford due to it's location to my work and price. I stayed in a single room that had every facility I could hope for, when coming home at night I was offered tea, the hospitality was wonderful. I will almost certainly stay again. Everything about the Roxford was great.",5,2013,10,21
222,Beautiful and comfortable,"My husband and I stayed here during our honeymoon last month and were extremely pleased. The hotel is beautiful, the neighborhood is quiet, and the room was stunning! And we couldn't believe how little we paid for it all! The service at the desk was excellent - the receptionist held out luggage when we arrived early and scheduled a taxi for us for the next morning. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,20
222,homely feel,"Myself and 2 friends decided to book this hotel as we were going to a concert in the o2 we got a great rate and we were extra pleased with the fact there was free secure parking.
A very friendly staff member, tall with dsrk hair and glasses, checked us in and showed us to our room. He was very professional and a credit to the hotel.
the room was fabulous. Very homely and cosy.  We had a double and two sijgle. Huge bathroom with a jacuzzi and a sauna in our room. There was also a flat screen tv wih a dvd player and a selection of dvds. Overall the room was perfect with very cofortable beds. We had a great nights sleep.
I would definitely stay here again and inwould recommend it to people of all ages.",5,2013,10,19
222,Wonderful,This hotel is located in a quaint neighborhood and is just short cab ride to tourist attractions.  The rooms are clean and beds are comfy.  The staff was helpful and eager to assist.  Wonderful Irish breakfast.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2013,10,19
222,Luxurious Hotel with odd extras!,"A quirky hotel within easy walking distance of the centre of the city. Our room had a sauna in the room which, in my past 40 years of travelling, I have never come across before. Doubled up with a jacuzzi in the bathroom too, this was indeed a unique room. The staff were very friendly, tea and coffee offered because our room was a little late in being ready. Nice little car park behind the hotel and a good breakfast place just up the road if you don't have breakfast in the hotel. If you don't fancy the walk into town the 4 and 7 stop right outside. I would stay here again.",5,2013,10,17
222,Great Dublin Location for Authentic Irish Encounters,"The Roxford Lodge Hotel is a nice B&B in a neighborhood just southeast of Dublin city center.  All the tourist activities are short bus ride or 15 minute walk away.  Though, we really enjoyed the neighborhood the Roxford is in: beautiful row houses, good restaurants, friendly people and great Guinness pours. The Roxford lodge rooms are very nice with modern bathrooms.  The Lodge is a bit compartmentalized for getting around, but the common rooms are nice.  The Irish breakfast was great and our hosts were very helpful.  We recommend the Roxford Lodge for those seeking more of a Irish neighborhood feel rather than tourist area.",4,2013,10,17
222,comfortable room,We spent two nights at the Rockford Lodge Hotel.  The room was very cozy with a comfortable bed and included both a sauna and jacuzzi as well as a large assortment of DVDs to watch.  The staff was both friendly and helpful.,5,2013,10,15
222,Nice owner and location,"After figuring out where to park (in the back of the facility), the owner was kind enough to explain how long it would take to see the sites and whether it was best to walk or cab. Nice street, on the edge of Ballsbridge so walking distance to the inner city (10 mins walking briskly). Never felt unsafe. Room was comfortable, bathroom interesting since they use the ""half glass panel thing"" to stop the shower water from hitting the floor, which it doesn't, but I guess i'm not the one cleaning up so no complaints. :) Didn't eat their breakfast since it wasn't included and could pick something up along the walk to the sites.",4,2013,10,14
222,Elegant setting and handy location,"Nice quiet location with secure parking.  The room was not large but was very luxurious with a lot of thoughtful extras such as a DVD player with a selection of movies, refrigerator, and a large jetted tub.  A good 20 minute walk to the downtown area but there were plenty of close restaurants in every direction.  A nice cross between a bed and breakfast and a hotel.",5,2013,10,13
222,Fantastic Irish Hospitality,"We used the Roxford Lodge as a base to stay for a wedding that was held at the Schoolhouse Hotel.It had better rate than the Schoolhouse & also included breakfast. Everything was fantastic. Thank you! 

      ",5,2013,10,13
222,"Cozy, friendly","Stayed here four nights. I booked a single room which was perfectly fine for me. It was a bit small but manageable. My room was facing the street and didn't have any noise that woke me up. My room had a jacuzzi and sauna in room which was a nice surprise. I did use the sauna once just to warm up for a bit because it was cold that day. In room fridge, fax machine, telephone, movies to watch and clock with an iPod Dock. Even though the room was small there w a closet to store your luggage in. The only thing I wished I could have changed was the restaurants in the area. There were few but good restaurants. If you were on a scheduled trip that got back late then it was hard to find food. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. There was a bus stop outside the hotel that would take you to the center city for £1.65 . Have lots of change because the bus doesn't give change back. You must take a voucher to the bus station to redeem the credit.
I would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2013,10,12
222,Charming hotel,"It's a nice hotel with updated rooms offering jacuzzi tubs and parking in the back. They have a nice parlor and also have tea that'll keep u warm on a cold day. 

They r a bit further from center but do have their fair share of pubs and rest in the neighborhood. 

It's a charming hotel with lots of unique architecture. Beautiful stain glass in rooms to admire and large windows.",4,2013,10,11
222,"Cozy, good location and wonderful staff!","After reading reviews and having Ballsbridge recommended by an Irish friend we decided to stay at the Roxford. Took a cab from the airlort and had a delightful driver. It's only 25 euro and was super convenient.  The hotel is a nice brick townhome style building. The room was quirky but very nice.
There were a few oddities, but we knew we chose a boutique, less expensive hotel instead of a Westin. There was visble repair work on the ceiling and the toilet wasn't always fond of flushing. Also, the space for the toilet, between the tub and towel warmer, is quite tight. This didn't matter except for when the towel warmer mysteriously turned on and got hot, in which case you easily burn your leg. The staff was just fantastic, letting us check in early and bringing tea and cookies to our room right away. 
The hotel is just a bit out from the ""City Center"" but it is really a fairly quick walk, and a good walk with many shops and pubs.
We would certainly consider staying here again!",4,2013,10,10
222,Great location and service!,"I enjoyed my stay at the Roxford over four nights in Dublin.  It is in a good location to the dowtown area, but still quiet in the evening.  The staff could not be more helpful.  Lindsey answered our many questions and helped guide us regarding the airport and local areas to visit.  She was very accommodating when we first arrived after a long flight tired and weary.  Desmond assisted us with travel arrangements and was also very professional.  My hats goes off to Agnes, who tirelessly worked into the night and provided an excellent breakfast.  I found the continental style breakfast to be huge and filling with delicious oatmeal and warm scones with jam and fruit.  There was even meat, tomatoes and cheese.  This was a great way to start the day and take a traveler into a late lunch.  My only complaint was I would prefer a larger room overall, but for two people this was manageable.",5,2013,10,07
222,Great and affordable,"We stayed at the Roxford for 3 nights and were very happy to be there. Close enough to the action without the noise. Desmond, his mother, and the rest of the staff make super efforts to ensure that guests are welcomed. We arrived around 7 AM and of course the room was not available but Desmond let us stash our luggage, gave us cookies and coffee and let us use the internet. We took off to explore and for a few hours and got our room by noon. A nice grocery store and also a nice pub around the corner. We had a room in the back so no road noise came our way. I'd stay there again,",4,2013,10,06
222,Very helpful Staff and decent location,"The most difficult thing about this place was getting to the parking lot around back, but once there, it was very nice.  The family room overlooked the parking lot out back, but it was a large room that included a jacuzzi tub (which was used) and a sauna in the corner of the room (which was not).  The location was about a 20 minute walk to downtown, but it was safe and easy.  The bathroom was large and clean; but could have used a bit more shelves and hooks (as most hotel bathrooms can).  The front desk helped us with bus tickets and recommendations for restaurants.  Very nice stay.",4,2013,10,01
222,"Great location, great staff, quirky room","Ok, I will not complain about the room, but if you ever rent the executive suite, you will see what I mean!  Other than a few, what were they thinking moments in the room, you cannot beat the location for the price.  You can walk to Grafton Street or the LIffey river area in just 10 minutes or so.

The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the setting was very nice.  The staff was great and wanted to ensure your stay was fantastic.  You can have tea or coffee brought to your room anytime of the day.  The go out of their way to make you happy.

There are plenty of eateries within a short walking distance.  They did serve breakfast in the morning starting around 7 am or so......and offered a wide range for continental and they offered eggs to order.  We would recommend this to our friends/family and will stay here again on our next trip.

Transportation around town is close, there is a bus stop just outside the front door the DART is just a few blocks away and just a little further up Bagger Street you can pick up one of the hop on hop off Dublin bus tours.  Parking is included, but rather tight.  With the location you will not need a car unless you are leaving the city.",4,2013,09,30
222,"Great service, nice location and decent rooms","The Lodge is really a refurbished townhouse located in a quiet neighborhood a short walking distance from downtown Dublin. The rooms are modern, with plenty of outlets (a pet peeve of mine is too few outlets). Our room had a sauna and whirlpool tub as well as a small balcony overlooking the gated parking in the back. The building itself has secured access too. The staff could not have been nicer, gave good recommendations and prepared eggs to order along with providing scones, brioche fruit and other goodies for a very good breakfast. The mainline bus stops right in front if you don't want to walk to town. Our only complaint was that the comforter on the bed is quite heavy so you are either too hot or too cold (we had to keep the window open as there is no AC. A simple blanket and top sheet would have been better. But otherwise, a great value.",4,2013,09,29
222,Highly recommended!,"We loved our two night stay at this beautiful property.  Our room was clean and comfortable with plenty of room, and a small balcony overlooking the rear of the building.  The staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful, even bringing us tea to our room when we checked in and offering to do the same each time we came back to the hotel.  They were always ready with recommendations and directions.  Breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  The location is quiet yet still very convenient, with a bus stop immediately out front.  There are plenty of pubs and restaurants within easy walking distance.",5,2013,09,28
222,"1st class service, great location","loved my stay here. . .we were treated so well by all staff, bedrooms were a little small but so comfortable and clean.  We slept very well.  Breakfast was lovely & cooked to order.  Would stay here again.",4,2013,09,27
222,"Clean, safe, nice neighborhood for your Dublin stay...","Great place to stay in Dublin in lieu of a big hotel.  Safe parking lot (located behind lodge, enter from the alley), clean rooms, friendly & helpful staff, great price!  The rooms even had a DVD player with movies to watch, bonus!  Bathroom had a nice bathtub, extra bonus!  Good location to get to airport in the morning also.",5,2013,09,22
222,"Huge room, great service","We stayed at Roxford  for 2 nights at the end of of our Ireland holiday. It certainly was an interesting room - a bit more than we expected! On booking I didn't realise that it was on 3 levels, and had- a sauna, spa bath, bathroom, bar, kitchen with washing machine, dishwasher, verandah, full computer.....etc. A bit over the top for us on our short and wish we could have done it justice by staying longer. Service was exceptional and front desk staff were available all hours even at 4am when we left for the airport and could not get out the gate. We were offered a tray of tea every time we came in and no request was too small. Easy access to the city centre on the bus which stops right at the door. A very good hotel and I would recommend it.",4,2013,09,12
222,Great Location,"One couple came from Dublin airport the other from Dun Laoghaire Port ferry. Easy to find away from the hectic one way city system, but handy to everything, by bus or walking. Very friendly and helpful staff. Lovely room with comfortable bedding. Best we had in our seven days in Ireland
We'll definitely recommend it to everyone . Very nice restaurant Roly's within walking distance.",5,2013,09,09
222,First Class Service - Roxford Lodge Hotel!,My friends and I were lucky enough to stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel in Dublin this past August. The hotel is well located and very charming & lovely - but the staff is really what makes it special. Front desk attendants did everything they could to make us comfortable from providing a beautiful suite of rooms to getting up very early and providing a made to order breakfast as we had to leave to make early plane connections.  This was the end of a very memorable trip to Ireland & our stay at the Roxford just left us with last & wonderful memories! Highly recommend!,5,2013,09,05
222,Excellent service!! A lovely stay,"We stayed 8 nights and wanted to extend but they were fully booked.  Reception assisted with finding another hotel in the area.   Lovely room, excellent staff and service, perfect location. Definitely recommend!!! A++++++",5,2013,09,03
222,Loved it!,"We stayed three nights at the Roxford B & B in Dublin recently, end of a 17 day Ireland trip, overall, we give it the very highest marks! Wonderful breakfast, thank Agnes for making our morning breakfast so great! Linsday at the front desk (from near our California hometown!) was amazing, friendly, very nice! Our first night was not good as a nearby dog woke us at 11.30 pm, 12.30 am and about 5 am - we asked to be moved as far away as possible from the back side, we were moved for our last two nights and didn't near the dog(s) - not the fault of Roxford, but visitors might need to put up with yapping dogs a few doors away. Again, overall, nothing but an A+ for Roxford, we walked 20 min to Trinity College area, awesome staff, loved the extra tea and cookies in our room after a long day sightseeing. We would highly recommend this historic, well-located B&B to all! thanks Agnes and Lindsay!",5,2013,08,24
222,Very nice return visit,"Spent one night with friends at this small boutique hotel.  The walk to Dublin Center is about 15-20 minutes, for those inclined, there is a bus stop across the street.  Our rooms were comfortable (refurbished since our last visit 5 years ago), and the bathroom was spacious by European standards.  The reception was small, but adequate.  Car park behind the lodge.  Breakfast was excellent, and promptly served.  All in all, this was a very nice stay, and I would recommend this small hotel highly.",4,2013,08,15
222,"Great small hotel, larger chains could learn a lot from this place","We stayed for one night following a 3 night stay in Galway for a friends wedding. We just wanted a launch pad to spend a afternoon early evening in Dublin have a few pints of Guinness and listen to some folk music. We arrived to a warm welcome, be warned the parking is round the back of hotel and you will need to get code as it is gated - which is excellent. The room (budget double) was tiny but packed with everything you want, and it had a comfortable double bed, high standard of furnishing, lots of sockets, iPod dock, quality wifi (not the rubbish stuff you get in most hotels) and was clean as a whistle. All in all a great small hotel at a great price and we took in most sights by walking (we are both fairly fit in our early 30's and after 3 nights of indulgence wanted to walk off some excess). Book it! ",5,2013,08,14
222,Great Hotel and Friendly Staff,"Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) stayed in the Roxford family room for three fabulous nights.  When we arrived tired and jet lagged, Lynnsie at the front desk, immediately welcomed us into the lovely parlor room and brought us tea, water and snacks. For the remainder of the three days she helped us organize some wonderful day tours and gave us great site seeing tips. The hotel is in a nice residential area, close enough to walk to all the main attractions but out of the direct center for a quiet night sleep. Our room package came with a complimentary breakfast which was impressive and delicious: a full ""cooked to order"" menu plus a large continental spread of juices, yogurt, cheese, fruit and cereal which kept us full of energy for hours.  I would highly recommend the Roxford Hotel for your stay in Dublin.",5,2013,08,14
222,More of a B&B than a hotel,"Had a 3 night break at the start of August 2013, took my mother with me & we had 2 double bed rooms, my room had the sauna which I did not use (the handle was broken on the sauna room door) & the Jacuzzi bath, which worked fine.

My mother’s room had a show only wet room (at our request) as she is disabled, however, she said she had nearly slipped on the floor of the shower room & there was no none slip floor or mat down.

On our arrival the very helpful lady on the front deck, showed us to our rooms but the lift door would try & close even if you were part way in the lift & would not re-open automatically, which the lady commented on that they need to fix the lift door (for me it was not a problem but for my mother or a young child it could have been a different story).

We asked if there were any small shops as we needed something to eat, the lady said about the restaurant or could make us a sandwich, however, the following day about 5 mins walk was the Spa shop that had I known I would have used. There is a bus stop outside or you could walk but it’s a far walk into the city centre.

We picked B&B when we stayed & the breakfast was a good spread & you could have a cooked breakfast at a small extra charge but we did not have this.

The rooms had LCD flat screen TV, a DVD player & some DVDs to play, however some of the TV channels did not work.

Overall it’s a nice B&B (more than a hotel), however, the cost is far too high for what is on offer (albeit this is in part due to the exchange rate) & I would not look to stay there again if I return to Dublin.",3,2013,08,11
222,Good place to stay in Dublin,"This small hotel was comfortable and charming, more like a B&B with perks. Staff was incredibly friendly, and offered us coffee and bisquits on our arrival. We stayed 4 nights and had continental breakfast every day, which was only 6 euros but with a lot to eat (the full Irish breakfast for 12 € would have been too big for us). The location is a bit off the city centre, but within walking distance (about 2 km) -- if you like walking I think it was better option than taking a taxi: driving in the city centre is really slow and the traffic is cramped. Extra luxury was that there was a small infrared-sauna in the room, which we used every day! The bathtub could also be used as a jacuzzi. The room was very clean and it was really quiet during the nights.",5,2013,08,04
222,Nice place to stay with the best porridge in Ireland!!,"Roxford Lodge is a quaint hotel/B&B which is a short cab ride from the airport and close to the sites in Dublin in a quiet residential type of neighborhood.  We were greeted by Lynnsie who was so welcoming and helpful and made our first day in Ireland a positive one.  The rooms have a certain charm to them as does the whole hotel.  Our kids stayed in a triple room which was spacious and comfortable.  Our double room met all of our needs and the beds were above average in comfort. The breakfast was delicious and their porridge (oatmeal) was the BEST I had in Ireland.  Give yourself a bit of extra time with breakfast as the ladies in the kitchen really like to take care of you and it may take a bit longer than expected!
Roxford is a quick 10 minute walk to Trinity College and the Book of Kells and Dublin Castle is just about 10 minutes further.  An enjoyable walk past a few places to grab a bit to eat and some pretty homes.
I would stay at Roxford Lodge again and recommend it as nice place to stay outside of the City Centre yet close enough to everything you would like to see/do.",4,2013,08,04
222,Charming,"This has been the most charming, most welcoming, and friendliest hotel I've ever stayed at so far.  They went way beyond all of my expectations.  Every body was easy to approach and talk to.  The hotel met all of my needs while going the extra mile in ways I didn't expect.  The entire hotel was clean, the room was very clean, comfortable, the bed was perfect, with the window open you could barely hear anything from outside, and the restaurant was great.  It was my first Irish breakfast which is pretty similar to an American breakfast but with the addition of black and white pudding.  I'm not talking about custard here but give it a try.  It's 15 minutes away from the airport and a 5 minute walk from the Chop house.  I highly recommend this hotel because from here on out this will be the only hotel I will be using when I return to Dublin.",5,2013,08,02
222,CHARM AND WELCOME,"This is much more a large B&B rather than a conventional hotel.  The room was so idiosyncratic, on three levels, with full kitchen, bar and work space, in addition to sauna and hot tub!  The staff couldn't try harder to accommodate us and assist with cabs and directions, especially Leslie.",4,2013,07,26
222,Revising my review,"My initial review of this small hotel was incorrect, and a reaction based on my own inexperience in traveling in Europe. Small ground floor room seemed at first a very poor choice, but a great staff and very clean room, coupled with great breakfasts won me over.  The staff (Averil and Lindsey) were extremely thoughtful and always asking to see if there was anything we needed.  The location turned out better than expected, with a healthy but manageable walk to Trinity College and Grafton St.  Overall, price, location , cleanliness and great service provided us with a most wonderful experience for our first time in Dublin.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,07,20
222,Perfect when in Dublin,"This was the perfect place for our first two nights in Dublin.  Rooms were immaculate and roomy.  The lodge is in Balls bridge, only a 15 minute safe walk from Trinity College or a €5 cab trip to Temple Bar, yet out of town enough to be quiet at night.  There is also a public bus stop right in front of the lodge.  The breakfast each morning was superb.  Staff was very helpful.  Stephanie at the front desk was a lifesaver in helping us to get around and Agnes was friendly at breakfast.  We will stay there again next time in Dublin.",5,2013,07,15
222,Great Stay,Roxford Lodge is within walking distance to the great attractions of Dublin or if you prefer on the bus route. Our stay was pleasant and breakfast delicious. The room was comfortable and well furnished.,4,2013,07,14
222,Awesome stay!,We really enjoyed staying in this hotel. It was in a good location. And the bus route was right out front. Literally when you go through their gate. And also if you want to walk it is not a long distance from a lot of the the tourist area's. Our bed was soft and comfy. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I absolutely recommend staying here.,5,2013,07,07
222,This place is a gem!,"We spent four nights at Roxford Lodge Hotel, and it was a wonderful experience. The room was spotlessly clean and had a jacuzzi tub and an infrared sauna, which was unexpected but kind of neat. The mattress was fantastic, and I slept like a baby. The best part, though, was the staff. Everyone we met was extremely courteous and helpful. They will bring tea or coffee free of charge on request, which was a great surprise. We had coffee and biscuits delivered every morning, and it was just delightful.

The hotel is not in the city center, which has two advantages: (1) it is quiet and (2) it is much less expensive. It is about a 20-minute walk to Trinity College, and the #4 and #7 buses stop in front of the hotel (the staff can help you figure it out). It is also very easy to get taxis in Dublin.

If we make it back to Dublin, we will definitely stay here again.",5,2013,07,06
222,Another great stay at the Roxford Lodge,"Title sums it all up. It's become our ""home"" in Dublin. Can't wait to go back again. As always nothing was too much trouble. We even have our ""own"" room at this stage!!! Breakfast again was superb. Great location also for City or heading out to Dundrum",5,2013,07,01
222,Great Breakfast,"Agnes who was in the dining room was wonderful and the breakfast delicious.  Ummmh!  The scones...nothing more said.  Great place to begin our 40 day trip.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and European small.  Great bathrooms and there is a lift.  Would recommend...",5,2013,06,28
222,Good Hotel with Excellent Service,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights. The hotel is not in the city centre, but a short walk will take you to the city centre.  We drove there and did not see a place to park our car. We left the car on the road and walked to the reception to learn the car park is at the back of the hotel. The car park is small, but we had a parking space. Later we got a security code to open the door any time we wanted to go out. The receptionist Janina came round and met us at the back entrance and took us to the reception.  She is a pleasant girl always with a smile on her face.  The hotel has a maze of corridors and doors.  There was a staircase and an elevator to go to the reception. The girl put us in the small elevator with our bags and said she will meet us on the first floor. She took the staircase and met us on the first floor where they had the reception. 

We took sometime to master the layout of the hotel. Our room was average size, not big, The advantage was there was a door to the outside paved area with a table and chairs.  Free WiFi was quite fast. Breakfast was good and we could order what we wanted. One important point was, that we were able to order tea or coffee any time.  It was free. We could buy tickets for the Hopon- Hopoff bus from the hotel reception. The receptionist had a good knowledge of the area. The best feature of this hotel is the great service and the effort the staff put into to make you comfortable. When we left the hotel, by mistake, I have left behind, my USB cable which I use to connect the camera to the laptop. The housekeeping has found it and I received an email saying they will post it free to my home address. This is a very good hotel with  excellent staff and good service.  I certainly prefer this hotel to the bigger city hotels and would come again.",5,2013,06,26
222,"Fantastic value, comfy beds, great location, DVDs, afternoon tea...loved it!","Wonderful hotel! We stayed at 7 hotels within 2 weeks and this was one of our absolute favorites. Comfy beds, perfect hosts, cute old building with small yet cozy rooms. We especially loved the afternoon tea that was included. Our room had a jacuzzi tub which was fantastic after walking around all day. The rooms were very nice and included little special touches like a good assortment of DVDs as well as nice toiletries. The location is in a very nice neighborhood in Dublin. Not too far of a walk from the city center, about 15 mins. We hung out at the pub behind the parking lot and made some friends. All in all a wonderful stay. I would highly recommend the Roxford lodge. ",5,2013,06,25
222,Great stay,"Host was super super nice and helpful.  Great recommendations for local food just down the street that was delicious.  
Room was tiny, but not surprising for Dublin.
Lounge area was very sunny and clean with complimentary tea, cookies, and candies served if you like.  
Free parking around back is extremely helpful in this city!",5,2013,06,25
222,"Great room, great service, great breakfast, good location","Once you park a car here (parking is included, which is great!) or get here from the airport, you really don't need a car for Dublin at all.  You just need to be willing to walk quite a bit.  The hotel is close to the city center, but still on the outside of town, so it takes some walking to get to/from.  As long as you're prepared for that, it is a great place to stay!  The room was very nice, complete with a jacuzzi bathtub and sauna in the room!  The people were all very nice and we had a great stay.",4,2013,06,19
222,Perfect Bed & Breakfast,"Nice hotel. Very friendly staff. Comfortable bed. Convenient, short walk to the center of town. Delicious breakfast too!  Another nice touch is the ""lounge.""  They'll fix you a cup of tea with biscuits while you sit in front of the fire.  We spent a good amount of time in this room.  Would stay again!",4,2013,06,18
222,Very nice stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights whilst attending a concert at the rds. 
Location; excellent 15 minute stroll to the city center, and 5 mins from the rds, plenty of pubs and eateries nearby.
Room; was quite large, the bed was very comfortable, we had a sauna in our room which I used and it was excellent. Only criticism would be the shower, the head of which was almost touching the top of my head (I'm only just over 5' 8"") and the water pressure wasn't great.
Breakfast; is the star here, it was absolutely delicious and there was plenty of it.
Staff; were friendly and helpful.
I would happily stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2013,06,17
222,Very Helpful!,Our room was lovely and very up to date in this 120 year old home.  It had all we needed.   Nice reception area and dining area which looked out on the beautiful front garden.  Everyone was kind and helpful as we made our plans to see Dublin - especially Avril and Stephanie.  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see in Dublin.  We took the DART - the station is close by - to see the surrounding areas of Dublin.   Breakfast was great.  We were so glad we booked this hotel.,5,2013,06,16
222,One night stay,"Nice looking room, bit small though. At 8pm there was a truck picking up rubble which was pretty noisy. No noise from other guests. Tap on bath was loose and bathroom sink pulled away from wall a little. Overall good stay",4,2013,06,15
222,Staff goes the extra mile,"We stayed here 2 nights to begin our 3 week trip in Ireland. Janina was very helpful when we arrived weary and jet lagged. She brought us tea in the pleasant sitting room while our room was made up ASAP so we could take a short nap. Comfy beds, soft linens and nice towels in the sparkling clean bathroom. So nice to do 20 minute walk on the lovely streets into Dublin. Merrion Square Park is a breath of green space in the city; even saw an urban red fox there! Breakfast was cooked to order and delicious. Agnes, the owner of the Lodge is a gracious, warm and friendly woman who makes sure that your cup is always filled with tea or coffee! We found the secure parking a real asset when we picked up our rental car. All in all, we were pleased with our stay so we booked again for the last 2 nights of our trip.",5,2013,06,11
222,Great breakfast and parking,"This is a charming boutique hotel in a good location, you can walk into the middle of Dublin and to main attractions from here,although public transport is at the door. The car parking in a welcome inclusion. The room was spacious and comfortable and clean.The breakfast in the morning was delicously home cooked and serviced in a beautifulroom. Thestaff were genuinely friendly and helpful.",4,2013,06,08
222,A wonderful hotel,"An excellent hotel. The staff are friendly, the breakfast is very good and the staff are extremely helpful. Our room was very spacious, extremely so. There was a lobby with the wardrobes (2), door to the bathroom and door to the room itself. Huge king size bed, lots of space to include a desk and chair, a round table in the middle, plus loads of room to move about. There was a sauna (!) in our room and a jacuzzi in the bathroom. Big, french doors to a small balcony. It could not have been better.

I think very fondly of this wonderful hotel.",5,2013,05,31
222,Charming Hospitality,"This was such a charming place. We drove from Adare Manor and arrived early. They immediately allowed us to park our car in their free parking lot and showed us to the lounge. We only had to wait for 15 minutes before our room was ready. We brought our luggage into the b&b on the ground floor and we were shown to the lift. The lady ran up all the flights of stairs to meet us at the top floor to show us to our room! I was very impressed by the rooms! They were cozy and we had a great view of the front entrance and street. There was a tv, dvds, and a sauna provided in our room. There were stairs in our room leading to our private bathroom! We loved it. Everyone was so helpful. We left for London and came back to Dublin for one more night and we stayed here again, before heading home. They called a taxi for us and showed us a way to take our bags out so we didn't have to take them down the front stairs. They also had very soft and comfortable beds! The only place on our entire trip that did! We could not wait to come back for our last night! I would definitely recommend. It has a great location. Its surrounded by embassies and it was a nice walk to Trinity College.",5,2013,05,30
222,Fantastic Hospitality,"We arrived around 8am and turned up at the hotel by chance, to get an idea when we could check in. The manager could not have been more helpful, he let us park our car immediately and offered to get us tea whilst they got our room ready. This level of service continued during our whole stay, it was so refreshing. 
The room we had was of such a high standard too, it had everything, including a small sauna and spa bath. The bed was just about the best bed we have slept on anywhere, so much so that we just had some of the best nights sleep (no it wasn't down to the Guinness either!) we've had in ages.
You can order as many trays of tea as you like and its free and there is no pressure from cleaners etc to get up at a ridiculously early hour (a pet hate of mine). In short they just value the customer and want you to enjoy your stay. Also its located ideally so that you can walk into Dublin and see all the sights easily without using the car.
We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, we have told all of our friends and we are definitely going back.",5,2013,05,28
222,Would stay again & Super Location,"Stayed in Family room x 4 persons for 2 nights ( Fri & Sat in late May 2013)  , I could ramble on but best to just bullet point it ! so…

Start with Down sides.. Not massive really and being a bit picky here 
•Parking is very secure but hard to get at as at rear of building and tight spaces for large vehicles 
•I have a VERY comfy bed at home so always find it difficult to get a  good sleep when away  large Dbl bed was OK but bit hard and sloped to middle so we kinda rolled together a bit 
•Some areas showing signs of wear and would benefit from as little tidy up 

On the PLUS side
•Great price ! (PARKING is Very secure at rear with coded gate, felt safe, not worried about car) 
•Food (breakfast) VERY good , lots of it and all FRESH , fruit salad was brilliant and well presented ,  Full Irish + Cereal + toast  kept us going all day 
•We where always offered T or Coffee at any time , we came back late from cinema and whilst had facilities in room desk staff offered to make fresh pot with biscuits ,  
•Kids only wanted scrambled eggs and bacon or sausage, was  not a problem getting a selection of what you really liked .
•Rooms clean and ample space, lovely quiet location , also had good TV + DVD WITH selection of DVDs ! 
•LOCTAION – easy walk to Board gais Theatre, short drive to Odeon at the  Point ( TIP - parking is 2 euro If you get ticket validated at cinema before returning to park when using underground car-park – EXCELLENT !) 
•Bust stop right outside and short walk about 10 mins to Grand canal stn for Dart train to City 
•Very close to AVIVA Stadium for any events there 
•STAFF – Very welcoming and friendly and helpful

Would we stay again    YES",4,2013,05,28
222,"Very comfortable, clean & friendly in top location",We booked in for 3 nights at beginning of our trip in April around Ireland and were so delighted with it that we booked for a further to nights on the way back in May.  The rooms are small but very well appointed and comfortable and the lounge is delightful.  It is situated in a lovely street with plenty of pubs and dining a short walk away.  It is a short walk to the city centre and there are lovely parks not far away. We caught the bus from the airport but got a taxi back to the airport as it was a very reasonable price.  The friendly efficient service is what makes the lodge really stand out.  Will definitely use it again next time in Dublin!,5,2013,05,28
222,A bit of balance!,"From reading the other reviews on TA I think readers may get a slightly over-inflated view of Roxford Lodge. It bills itself as a 'luxury boutique style hotel'. It isn't. It's a very serviceable, quite modest, hotel with some good and some less than good points. Good points are the location, which is excellent, particularly if you're in Dublin for the rugby, and the staff, who are very helpful. Less than good were our room, which was quite small and bizarrely had a small sauna stuck in the corner. The upshot being there was virtually no useable storage space in the room. In general, there didn't seem to have been much thought given to the useability of the room - there were no hooks for hanging things up, there were no flat surfaces in the bathroom to put ones spongebag. Not big issues but symptomatic of the general standards. The breakfasts were also rather ordinary - certainly not what one might expect from a' luxury boutique style hotel'. We paid over 200 euros a night and while I accept that Dublin is very pricey, and Dublin 4 in particular, I don't really think it was good value for money. We probably wouldn't choose to stay again.",3,2013,05,25
222,Georgian Neighborhood,"My wife, daughter and I stayed for three nights in Room 120, which room has a stocked kitchen, washing machine, sauna, jacuzzi tub, dvd player with a good selection of movies, and a glassed in office with a computer - free wifi too!  Easy access with ramps and a lift, in case you need them (I did after walking back from O'Connell Street - my choice, great walk, sick of shopping, 10 euro taxi ride if needed-but the walk was great). 

The property is located just outside of the heart of Dublin in a beautiful Georgian neighborhood, and sits on a main road with very easy bus service to the Trinity College area by bus #4 and bus #7, one of which stops every ten minutes right in front of the hotel. Around the corner two blocks away is everything a traveler needs - grocery store, laundry, ATM, and three or four great restaurants.  We ate at Juniors and had a fabulous rib eye!  The Chop House was great too!  

I saved the best for last.  The staff at the Roxford is fabulous!  Seriously!  Check in, check out, breakfast, everybody was so nice, very professional, and hard working.  They were always helpful - booked a discounted hop on hop off at the front desk, offered a 25 euro fixed taxi fare to the airport, helped us find a movie theater, loaned us an electrical adapter, etc., etc.  The full Irish breakfast was fabulous!!  Just an all around very pleasant experience at the Roxford Lodge.  We will be back.",5,2013,05,25
222,Excellent!,"Everything about this hotel was excellent. Located in a very quiet section of Dublin, it was a 10 min bus ride to the City Center.  The Staff were so accommodating, even letting us drop off our luggage at 6:30AM on our day of arrival.  The rooms were great, plenty of electrical outlets (to charge up all the phones and computers) and real WiFi that was free and it worked.  Breakfast was 'full Irish' and cooked to order.  This hotel is an excellent stay. On our next trip to Ireland, we will return to Roxford.
Frank & Sandie",5,2013,05,23
222,Really nice place to stay,"We stayed in the Roxford Lodge when going to a gig in the O2. The staff were exceptional - very welcoming and attentive. They brought fresh coffee to our room after our arrival and were really eager to please. The place is super quiet and we got a really good sleep. The location is fantastic, a leafy street with a nice 20 minute walk into the city centre, where we had lunch in KC Peaches - a great casual restaurant with everything you can imagine on display in a kind of pick-n-mix self serve way. Roxford Lodge is thoroughly recommended.",5,2013,05,13
222,Wonderful Stay!!,"The staff is soooo hospitable. the services are amazing!! we had a triple room (one double bed and a single bed) So could easily fit 3 people. There is a comfortable and clean shower and jacuzzi tub!! Has all the amenities you hope for but  can't always expect in europe (hair dryer, tv, coffeemaker). FREE wifi! FREE Parking! 

Walking distance from Merrion Square (10-15mins) and Trinity College (20-15mins). Has a cute little lounge right by the concierge on the first floor with a computer/printer that you can use for free! 

It is wonderfully clean, we got fresh towels/toiletries everyday. 

Services apart, the staff was also wonderful. Very helpful and knowledgeable (even helped me figure out my flights/details to my next destination). Had suggestions for tours/how to get around even when I would get back around 11pm!!

Overall, this was a wonderful experience! And so reasonably priced!",5,2013,05,08
222,Very Good and Reasonably Priced,"I chose this as a budget alternative for a long weekend in Dublin based on positive reviews, and had no regrets at all. The hotel is an attractive red brick town house, probably early Victorian, set well back from the main road from Trinity College to Ballsbridge. The hotel was quiet, and about a 20 minute walk, or local bus-ride, from the city centre. A short walk away from an intersection nearby were a couple of pubs, shops and restaurants. My small single room was very well appointed with a comfortable bed, fine TV and DVD player and safe. The bathroom was small, crammed with equipment, too much so if anything, and with a strong water supply and hot water. Breakfast was good and freshly prepared. Service throughout was friendly and helpful. While for my purposes I would have preferred a shorter regular walk into the city, there was ample compensation in the attractive Georgian terraces, wide streets and grass lined canal nearby or en route. ",5,2013,04,29
222,"Total bliss, not luxury in the upper scale.. But nothing can replace the luxury of mind... It is bliss","This hotel has something above all other hotels that I have stayed in .. An Irish mammy, who made my stay like a home , brought tea to my room at 11pm after a long journey  , it has all the extras ie jacuzzi bath, sauna in my room .. But those are frills , the welcome made it for me ... Customer care is priceless , large vast hotels should send there customer care agents here to see how it's done , a total joy .. Location is perfect, a lovely walk to city centre along the canal , only caution would to make sure when your booking that no matches are taking place in the stadium(very rare) ... I will be back !! ",5,2013,04,28
222,Wonderful Hotel for stay in Dublin,"The Roxford Lodge was perfect for our recent stay in Dublin.  On a quiet street yet close enough to walk to the many sites and activities in the city center.  The owner/staff were wonderful, kind, helpful and really made us feel at home.  The room was comfortable and very clean.  Looked forward to breakfast everyday.  And, extremely reasonable.  A great pick!",5,2013,04,18
222,Great location for walking enthusiast!,"Just outside the city center on a nice quite street. The walk to the city center is about 1500 meters, almost a mile. The walk is easy and there are plenty of coffee shops and pastry places to hit on your walk.  There are a few local pubs and a great pizza place within 300 meters of the B&B. Reception was easy and they have a room to place your luggage so you can explore Dublin if your early for your room check in.  Internet reception is excellent. Breakfast was outstanding. I would recommend getting the full Irish breakfast they have. We will be staying here on our next trip to Ireland.",5,2013,04,14
222,Nice hotel in great location,"Hotel was clean, comfortable and has good wifi reception. 

Some of the furniture is a little dated as are the bathrooms but it was fine especially for the price. 

Location is great, very nice neighborhood and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel that takes you into central Dublin. 

We would recommend this hotel if you want a reasonably priced hotel with good amenities.",4,2013,04,12
222,Excellent stay in Dublin,"The hotel is located in a quiet nice area of dublin, 20 min by foot from trinity college, very cosy and clean. Helpful staff. They gave us a small room, but even though it was a pleasant stay. Would stay there again and recommend.",4,2013,04,08
222,Great time to relax,"Stayed one night at this hotel. Found it very quite and relaxing, used its sauna and Jacuzzi. Great place to get rid of stress and relax after long day. Friendly staff, was allowed for late checkout free of charge.",5,2013,04,08
222,Excellent hotel for a stay in Dublin,"We stayed at Roxford Lodge for four nights at the end of March, and it is a very clean and welcoming hotel, well-located for seeing Dublin, and within easy walking distance of the centre, but there's a bus stop outside for those who don't fancy the 15 minute walk. Our room (118) had both sauna and a jacuzzi, and was really of a very good and unexpected size. Our double bed was very large - maybe superking - and deliciously comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly, professional and helpful, and the breakfast was excellent. The only real downside (hence only 4 stars) was that the room wasn't really warm enough - Dublin was very cold at the time (constant flurries of snow, near-freezing temperatures), and the radiator, although very hot, was really too small to effectively counter the icy temperatures outside. Despite this, I would highly recommend this hotel, and would certainly stay there if visiting Dublin again.",4,2013,04,06
222,Easter Weekend,"Superb!! Myself and my husband stayed at the Roxford Lodge for our 25th wedding anniversary.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  The staff were extremely kind and friendly, especially Desmond who made us feel so welcome when we arrived.  Our room was spotlessly clean.  The food was excellent with plenty of choice and nothing was too much trouble to any of the staff.  Tea and coffee was available throughout  the day and evening.  There was a coal fire in the lounge which was lovely when coming back after a long day out and especially as the weather was so cold.There was also a laptop for internet access.    It is about 15 minutes walk to the city centre, but the buses (4 and 7) are very frequent and stop right outside the door. The rooms are quiet and you get a very restful sleep.   We would definitely stay at the Roxford Lodge again if we return to Dublin.",5,2013,04,03
222,"Peaceful, great food, convenient location, fantastic staff- what more could you want?","We stayed at the Roxford for the first two nights of our honeymoon. We arrived before our room was ready and the staff (who I suppose could see the exhaustion from the long flight) offered us a MASSIVE breakfast downstairs and an alternative room to shower and nap in until ours was ready. That in itself meant so much to us! 
The rooms were really lovely, but the executive suite really is a sight to behold. The breakfast downstairs is phenomenal.

We actually wanted to cancel our last two days' stay at a different hotel and see if we could get back in at the Roxford.

The staff there really make you feel welcome and provided great suggestions.

I hope one day we can return to Ireland. If we do, we will definitely stay at the Roxford.",5,2013,04,03
222,Worth the last minute booking.,"My husband and I booked this hotel in the last minute as we had to change our travel plans due to the bad weather. This hotel turned out to be a great choice as it was in a lovely, quiet neighbourhood and yet, not at all far from the city centre. The staff lived up to the famous Irish hospitality and took good care of us. The breakfast room is pretty and faces a little garden filled with blooms. All the food served is fresh and quite tasty(I personally enjoyed the freshly baked brown toast). Our room was clean and had some gadgets that made our stay quite comfortable. The sauna inside the room and the jacuzzi in the bathroom were an amusing touch and so was the little music system with CD drive fitted into the sauna box! 
The biggest advantage of the hotel is that there are 2 bus stops right outside with frequent services that will take you to the heart of the city.
I would definitely recommend this place to any tourist who chooses to visit the beautiful city of Dublin.",4,2013,04,03
222,Manchester middle aged couple,"Wow wow wow. The executive room was amazing, the staff were friendly, breakfast lovely, rooms very clean and catered for everything we needed.we wouldn't go anywhere else in Dublin now we have found the roxford. Any couple looking for a romantic weekend away the executive room is definitely the place to be. Bus stop right outside that's takes you to the city centre (5mins). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,2013,04,02
222,friendly owners,This hotel was lovely although some of the rooms were a little small it was clean and quiet and the food was lovely. What really sold this hotel for us and the reason we will return is the friendly staff they could not do enough us they were very friendly and kind. Thanks Desmond !,4,2013,04,01
222,Charm and hospitality,We are so happy of our stay at this nice little hotel. The people are so kind  and helpful. The sitting-room with a open-fire allows to recover after a day of visit and you receive a cup of tea with some cookies. The breakfast is rich and served with attention. The room are confortable and everything is perfectly clean. There are two bus-stops in front of ther house and a train station at short distance. The quartier is nice and calm  and near down-town . So we did really appreciate our stay at the Roxford Lodge. Thanks ! Jean-Jacque Sanglier,5,2013,04,01
222,"Nice owners, good location, so-so hotel","The Roxford Lodge Hotel is fine enough.  The rooms are basic and generally clean. The family that owns it is delightful and incredibly helpful -- you won't stand still for long without a cup of tea in your hand! They can give all sorts of helpful advice and are very sweet.

They also have a parlor with a fire and books and a computer which was very nice.

But, we found the layout and bedrooms a bit odd verging on tacky.  The non-executive suite rooms are tiny and jammed full of lots of unnecessary furniture including a massive sauna which looks sort of like an upright coffin in the room and takes up what I think is rather valuable floor space. There are lots of stained glass skylights and such which let in morning light. Some of the walls have dings and areas that need a little repainting. The rooms in the lowest level have slightly grungy carpets and a slightly musty smell so I'd recommend a room higher than 109 (I think those higher number rooms are higher up and therefore less musty.) We asked to move and they moved us IMMEDIATELY, no questions asked.

Some of the rooms have these cheesy twinkly light things over the bed -- as if you look up while in bed and see the night sky. It all struck me as kind of random and hodge-podge from a decor standpoint. We were disappointed when we first walked in since it's billed as a ""luxury"" hotel.

It is located in a very nice, quiet part of Dublin with a bus stop right outside.  If you want to walk into Dublin, it will take about 25 minutes to get to St. Stephen's Green.

From what I can tell, Dublin hotels are all much more expensive than similar hotels elsewhere in Ireland so brace yourself.

PROS:
Charming and helpful owners
Good location
Clean
Comfortable beds

CONS
Rooms are a bit overstuffed with furniture
Some rooms need repainting and new carpets

BOTTOM LINE: If the price is right, take it. But don't expect luxury.",3,2013,03,31
222,Roxford Lodge Hotel,"We were delighted that the Roxford Lodge Hotels was so close to Dublin's City Center.  We were able to walk to Trinity College, all of the museums, catch the Hop On-Hop Off bus, and shop without wearing ourselves out.  The rooms at the Roxford are nicely appointed.  Our room was not large but included all of the amenities such as a jacuzzi tub and looked out over Northumberland Street.  This Hotel is right around the corner from the Irish Printing Museum and the Labor Museum.  It is near many fine restaurants.  We will definitely stay at the Roxford again.",5,2013,03,27
222,"Lovely location, wonderful people!","We were so happy with our choice to stay at Roxford. The rooms are beautiful and luxurious with a jacuzzi tub, large tv, sauna, and much more. We had been traveling for quite some time in Europe and this lodge was such a pleasant way to end our trip. We will definitely be back to stay a bit longer!",5,2013,03,25
222,best hotel ever.,"stayed for 3 nights in economic single room, which was about 50~60 euro per night. the room was bit small, however, enough for 1 people. there is a closet & spacious bathroom with a jacuzzi bathtub.
inside the bedroom, sauna is also available which I used everyday.
 all staff are very kind & friendly, breakfasts are wonderful, simple coffee & tea with few snacks were lovely. walkable distance to Trinity college & city tour bus stop. if you had a shopping you can take bus no.4 or 7 to the hotel front. 
 there is nothing bad to say at all. would definitely stay again, if my family or friend has a plan to visit Dublin, I'll recommend this hotel to everybody.",5,2013,03,05
222,Excellent stay :) Made my 30th birthday one to remember!!,"I stayed here for my 30th with 3 friends, very happy with the hotel and the staff - especially Desmond who could not do enough to make our stay excellent. Our room was equipped with a sauna (worked wonders to revitalise us all in the morning) :) Our room opened on to a little patio area and had a big and spacious bathroom. All round a brilliant hotel, 5 star treatment for very reasonable price. Would definitely book to stay again :)",5,2013,02,24
222,"Great value, lovely hotel","Myself and 5 others stayed here for one night and could not have been happier with the hotel. The staff were very friendly and the in room saunas and jacuzzi baths were a great hit with the younger members of our group. The breakfast was fabulous, the continental was very generous and again the staff were super friendly. An easy 10/15 minute walk into town and the surrounding area is quiet and clean. I have already recommended this hotel to my parents and would have no hesitation in returning.",5,2013,02,24
222,Brilliant,"Very good value in an very expensive city. Very friendly stuff. Excellent breakfast. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin.
The area is excellent also. Very close to the centre, without the noise and the trouble of Temple Bar",5,2013,02,21
222,One of the best value for money hotels in Dublin,This is a small hotel where you are made feel at home and not charged a fortune for it! I stayed as a solo traveller due to work commitments. There was a jaccuzi and sauna in my room! Breakfast was good. Staff were always trying to made my stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible. I highly recommend this hotel based on the experience I had.,5,2013,02,17
222,Great Hospitality. Fab quiet location,"The lodge is a mile from Dublin center on a very pleasent straight walk. If u dont feel like walking buses are in front and take less than 5m to reach downtown. 
I had a decent sized quiet single room. Breakfast was Very good!",5,2013,02,17
222,Great !,"Great location, price, building and went that little bit extra with service & free treats in room was a nice thought. Late check in & out not a problem. All other guests seemed happy to. Would recommend and hope to visit again.",5,2013,02,15
222,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"I had a great stay here for 4 nights at the end of January.  I found the location to be great.  Nice quiet neighborhood about 10 - 15 minute walk to city center.  It is less than a 5 minute walk to the drop off / pickup point for the Aircoach to the airport.  Also, not too far from a DART station (Grand Canal Station).  

My room was a good size, quiet, comfortable and clean.  I slept very well here every night, which is not common for me.  Remember to bring your plug adapter if travelling from the US.  Wifi was easy to access and always functioned for me when I needed it.

I arrived here very early in the morning on my flight from the US.  I was able to drop off my luggage and it was waiting in my room for me when I returned and checked in.  That was a nice touch.  The young man that was working that morning was the nicest and most helpful hotel employee I've ever talked to.  He got me nice cup of hot tea and we discussed the sites and things to do in Dublin.  I recommend Roxford Lodge Hotel and hopefully I can return to Dublin someday and stay here again.",5,2013,02,12
222,Optimum stay,"Hotel located in a very elegant and quiet part of Dublin. 10 minutes (walking) from Dublin city center, excellent walk. The room was spacious, quiet, equipped with every comfort including a sauna and a jacuzzi. Super breakfast!!! In quality and quantity. A special mention to Mrs. Agnes that made every breakfast special: great affability, kindness and ability  to make you feel at ""home"". Kindness and competence by all the staff of the hotel. What can I say? Optimum! Recommended.",5,2013,02,03
222,Good value for money.,"My sister and I stayed here in January 2012 to celebrate her 30th birthday and we had a lovely time. Our single rooms both had jacuzzi baths, infa-red saunas, flat screen TVs and a range of DVDs which made relaxing very easy! The rooms were also incredibly clean and bedding was good quality. Breakfast was also a plus point, with a range of options for all tastes - from porridge and fresh fruit to a full Irish. 

The only downside for us was the 20 minute walk to town which gets a bit tiresome if you do if a couple times of day - but this is a minor gripe!",4,2013,02,01
222,Best hotel in DUblin!!!,"Seriously,
i had an amazing time in this hotel! 
People were very helpful in every situation, the room was lovely and really quiet considering its situated in one of the nicest Dublin areas,just close to many embassies.
I could go on for hours,but just go...and try it yourself!

222,"Location, location, location","We had a wonderful stay at Roxford Lodge. The location was perfect, located in a quiet neighborhood of Dublin, but a close walk to everything, The rooms were a nice size and newly painted, the beds big and comfortable. The best part were the neighborhood cats who were always up for a cuddle.",5,2013,01,02
222,Good location,"We stayed for 2 nights last year (sorry for delay).  We were in Dublin the night of the big football game so accomodation was expensive and hard to fine.  We ended up in the executive room at the Roxford Lodge.  The room had a kitchen, spa, sauna, PC and printer...it was huge.  The room was very clean and comfortable and in a good location....a short stroll to town.

Only complaint is that if you have a kitchen then there should be cooking equipment, if you have a printer there should be paper, if you have a washing machine it should have instructions on how to use it....we found this really frustrating.  We had all these extras (which we paid for in our room rate) but couldn't really use it.  When we asked for a can opener it was a big drama, we also asked for instructions for the washing machine----we gave up waiting for that!  

The receptionist did orgainse a dentist appointment for me when I needed one urgently.",3,2013,01,01
222,Good value for money in Dublin!,"Stayed overnight at the Roxford Lodge Hotel as they were offering a good rate. First impressions were that the hotel looked a bit in need of updating and that the location was not easily accessible by car with no parking at front of the hotel. The car park was located at the rear without any obvious signs to direct you there. 

Inside the building had some modern features, although in need of much modernisation overall. Given the interior was still that of a townhouse and signs were no so clear, there was some manoeuvring required to locate the reception area from the rear car park and then the actual level for the room, given split corridors.

The room was relatively modern on the interior, with card entry and movement sensitive lighting in the hallway, plus a jacuzzi bath and infra-red sauna. The room was equipped with an LCD television, DVD player and satellite stations, although operating the devices was somewhat complex. The collection of DVD's in the room were also quite dated. The telephones in the room did not work either, so we had to call reception via our mobiles whilst staying when we could not get the DVD player to work etc. Clearly, instructions could have been left as to the correct AV channel or a demonstration given. The same applies with the sauna as a rushed explanation did not really register with us on arrival.

The hotel kindly gave a bottle of wine and some Butlers chocolates, which were a nice touch; but given the nice features that the room had, the owners really need to upgrade the whole hotel as other parts let them down.

The restaurant does not open on a Sunday so we had to eat in town, but as Dublin City has so many nice eateries, this was not a problem. Breakfast on the Monday morning was a very homely affair, like having your Mum cooking for you. There was a self-service display of fruit, juices, breads, cheeses, yoghurts and selection of nice teas including roobois and earl grey, which was delightful. I opted for a full Irish breakfast, which was well-presented and delicious. There was even white and black pudding which was a nice local touch. I did have an appointment in the City, but opted to stay and enjoy the breakfast which truly set me up for the day.

The car park seemed quite tiny, and was not so convenient as it involved navigating around the block. The road in which it is located is quite narrow, so a car approaching from the opposite direction was not impressed as it had to wait whilst I waited for the gates to be opened by reception.

The hotel staff were friendly, although the receptionist on our arrival could have been more helpful in explaining devices and problem-solving (like the in-room telephones not working). The hotel also offered payment in GBP and EUR which was also a handy feature.

I have to stay that given the low price, this hotel was value for money. It is located in Ballsbridge, and not too far from another hotel which remains my favourite in the area. However, I think I will reserve this hotel as a back-up if I need a cheaper option or my favourite location is full!",3,2013,01,01
222,Excellent Hotel!  LOVED IT!,"I have never been so pleasantly surprised as when we walked into our hotel room.  Spacious and bright with stained glass windows, a sauna and large bathroom with jacuzzi, what's not to love?  The people were very friendly.  I will always think of Ireland as friendly because of the people at this hotel.
The breakfast was excellent.  If we ever get to go back to Dublin, we will stay at this hotel again without a doubt.  It's a great value for all that you get.
Now stop wasting time, and book this hotel, you won't regret it!",5,2012,12,30
222,Very comfortable,"Stayed here for 1 night stayed in the economy single room 124 and it was just fine, place is clean warm and such a short distance from city, great transport options on your door. Would definitely stay again",4,2012,12,01
222,"Not really a hotel, more like a B&B.","I stayed for 4 nights in an Economy Single room. The room was very small, but well appointed. There was a sauna in the room that took up a lot of space. Would be much better value w/o the sauna in the room. The bathroom was nice. Not too small. Enjoyed the jacuzzi tub.

The hotel is located about a 20 minute walk/7 EUR cab ride/1.40 EUR bus ride from the city centre. Very safe, posh area. Bus stop right outside the hotel. Cabs everywhere.

They have free unsecured wifi which worked only part of the time I was there. But I found this to be a common occurrence in Dublin. Wifi was out everywhere.",4,2012,11,30
222,A great hotel for a great City,"I chose this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and I was not dissappointed.
Very friendly and helpful staff, I was offered tea or coffee on numerous occasions, served in the lounge.
My room was clean, comfortable, and even had a jacuzzi in the bathroom. It was cleaned every day.
The hotel is situated about 15 minutes walk from Trinity College 25 minutes from the Liffey.
There is a bus that runs past the hotel every 15-20 minutes to the City centre and back for 1€ each way.
I decided not to have breakfast at the Roxford as I like to eat out, and just down the road towards Trinity College is Kilkenny, a family homeware store that has a restuarnt on the first floor. For 5€ you can chose four breakfast items and for 7€ you can choose six items plus brown or white toast plus tea or coffee, and it was all really, really good quality, hot, with great service. The relish is a must to try!! It was so good I decided to have go back the next day and have the extra items. Kilkenny also have a lunch and evening menu changed daily!",4,2012,11,19
222,Will definitely be back!,"Booked this hotel for the location as we were attending a concert at the O2. (Within reasonable walking distance) Rooms were great, including a sauna and jacuzzi bath - unexpected! Breakfast was excellent - the lady serving (I think the owner) could not have been more attentive without being intrusive. Other staff were most helpful regarding buses, taxis and directions for the rest of our stay. Public bus from a stop just opposite the hotel took us right to centre for under 2 euros.
I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2012,11,18
222,Favourite Hotel in Ireland,"Stayed here on a midweek trip and it was absolutely fantastic. We had a gorgeous room with a high ceiling that just made it feel so spacious, the hotel oozes character but has all the amenities too. The high speed internet was excellent, which I needed for work. The parking is very secure and there are plenty of spaces.

The room had to be the cleanest and best maintained of any I have stayed in, the DVDs in the room are a really nice touch, and I found the desk with the fax/printer very useful. We didn't use the jacuzzi bath or steam room but they looked good.

The staff are excellent, very helpful, friendly and accommodating, I was able to use the hotel as a base even after I had checked out.

This will now be my default hotel when visiting Dublin. Very happy.",5,2012,11,14
222,Hospitality Plus,"A friend and I just completed four nights at the Roxford Lodge Hotel in Dublin's Ballsbridge District.  Close to Aviva Stadium where we enjoyed a rugby test match between South Africa and Ireland, the hotel is also within easy walking distance to the central part of the city [for spry Guiness-drinkers like ourselves] or an easy bus ride or taxi away.

From the airport, the AirCoach stops within 150 metres of the Roxford at School House Hotel.  Be warned, though, if you buy a return ticket in advance as I did leave plenty of time for your return journey.  Our bus was at least 25 minutes late so we ended up grabbing a cab anyway.

As for the Roxford, the rooms are clean; the hotel is quiet; and the prices are reasonable.  While ours did not come with the complimentary Irish Breakfast, we enjoyed the 6 Euro continental starter that was not only more than adequate, it was far more than either of us would eat in a typical day back home.

Of special note is the service.  Agnes, Desmond and Jennifer were terrific.  Every night when we returned to the hotel, Agnes was there to offer us a pot of tea or coffee and some cookies in our room -- the consummate hostess.  When we discovered a broken hanger rod in our closet, Desmond immediately appeared to fix it.  And Jennifer proved to be the ultimate guide, directing us to points of interest cultural and festive.  

If you want to be in the middle of the action, then the Roxford may not be for you.  If you like to be near the action in a quieter part of the city, and if exceptional service means anything to you, consider the Roxford for your next trip to Dublin.",5,2012,11,13
222,"Been there, done it and WILL DO IT AGAIN!","This hotel’s a gem. On arrival I was made to feel I was the most important customer it was ever going to have to stay within it.

Stephanie (the receptionist) made me feel very welcome and with an immediate offer of tea or coffee I was convinced I had made the right choice of hotel for my Dublin stay.

As an unaccompanied traveller I was delighted with my room. It was not big but it was of sufficient size and was spotlessly clean. It was well furnished and had a delightful bathroom. The Jacuzzi was the icing on the cake for me.
 
The hotel is in a nice area and if public transport is your means of getting about the bus stop is beside the hotel and a modest fare (1.4 euros) will get you into the city centre.

I had breakfast in the hotel. It was freshly prepared, tasted great and was well presented by a pleasant member of staff.

I hope to go to this hotel again. This was my first stay in the Roxford; having stayed in quite a few Dublin hotels in the past. Any future stays in the south side of Dublin will definitely be in this one.",5,2012,11,06
222,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for the weekend of the Dublin City Marathon and was very glad we did - fantastic hotel - probably the best Dublin hotel I've stayed in. Warm atmosphere, friendly staff, and good location. When we arrived we were told there was an error with our booking which meant we would be upgraded to the executive suite for no extra cost - I like those kinds of errors! Our room was excellent - even had a sauna and jacuzzi. We enjoyed every minute we spent here, and will definitely be back. Free secure parking. Very highly recommended.",5,2012,11,05
222,Great Hotel,"The hotel was lovely, clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful (especially Jen).
I had a double room and it was very spacious and the bed very comfortable.
The breakfast was very good, but it should have been included in the price of the room.
I would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,11,04
222,The Roxford Lodge is a gem!,"This lodge is a little gem in the city of Dublin. We arrived 5 hours prior to check in, but we were graciously greeted by the receptionist. They were able to give us our room right away and brought a lovely tray of coffee and cookies within 15 minutes. The room was very clean, cozy and filled with all of the nicities (flatscreen TV, nice bedding, complentary trays of coffee and tea, sauna, fluffy towels, etc) The room was a good size, bedroom and bath were completely separate which was nice, and there was a balcony in the back to get a bit of fresh air. We never heard any of the other guest in the rooms around us either. The morning breakfast was great. The breakfast room was nice and I loved enjoying my morning coffee there. The lounge was very cozy also. Lastly the staff was great. They were all incredibly friendly and accomodating. We loved this place and will return next time we are in Dublin.",4,2012,10,30
222,"Small room, average hotel","Cozy little Hotel in a quiet residential area on the fringe of central Dublin. It’s a 15 to 20 minutes walk to city centre or a short hop on the frequently running buses; the stop of the airport bus is just one block away. The economy room was in the basement with small overhead windows and some noise from the people entering the hotel from the car park (which is in the back of the hotel and insanely crowded). The room was very small with nothing more than a twin size bed, a desk, a closet and a bulky hot air cabin (which they call “sauna” ) in it. 

The receptionist was very brusque, she obviously didn’t feel like explaining the key locks to the front and rear door once again. Otherwise an average hotel with an average room for an average prize.",3,2012,10,28
222,Private Sauna !!!!,"This is a total gem. We arrived late afternoon, and were met with tea & biscuits. Our room has a sauna, and a spa, with its own little balcony. Absolutely gorgeous. A rabbit warren to find the room...I got lost a lot !! Car park out the back. Short, pleasant walk in to Dublin. Leafy suburb. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,10,25
222,One night stay,Stayed only one would have loved to have stayed longer. Hotel and staff were excellent.  Lovely bedroom with loads of extras breakfast was great.  Staff really welcoming and helpful as you can expect with the Irish.  Will definitely go back.,5,2012,10,21
222,Lovely place in a convenient location!,"We spent three nights in Dublin and this was the perfect homebase. The staff is friendly and helpful when needed. The location is a quick 15min walk to the city center but also has easy access to public transportation if desired. Our room had a jacuzzi tub which was great to soak in after a busy day of walking. The rooms are also stocked with DVDs to watch when needing to relax in the hotel. 

It's a great place to stay to get more of a local feel of Dublin while also having easy access to the hot spots.  

PS - The Chop House Gastro Pub (3min walk) is a must eat location! We did... twice.",4,2012,10,20
222,Expected Better,"Perhaps the problem with good tripadvisor ratings is that expectations are subsequently quite high.  I found myself staying at the Roxford Lodge Hotel recently and was quite dissappointed.  I was travelling alone and as sometimes happens, I was shoved into quite a dingy single room.  Indeed it had the 'sauna cabin' but at the expense of standing room.  All the facilities were there but it felt like a checklist for ""stars"" was being followed and were crammed in, for example the iron and trouserpress were attached to the door and it was quite difficult to use them given their location.  I would describe the Rosford Lodge as more or a well appointed guest house than a hotel.  In my opinion there are certainly much better hotels in the locality. Having said that, the staff was efficient and friendly and the breakfast was good with plenty of choice.",3,2012,10,17
222,Wonderful and lovely stay :),"Wonderful hotel in a nice area,bus stop at the front but I never used.
Not far from shopping and Train station to N. Ireland. (Taxi cost around 5 to 7 euro)
Room 111 stay for 4 nights,room is small but for one person is good enought.
 That room can be noisy at late night and early morning due to guest late night out and early check out.
 Window in room may not be open between 7 am to 10 am due to cooking at the breakfast room downstair in the morning.
Internet access is fast. Better than lots of hotels in UK and Ireland.
All the staff are very helpful :)",5,2012,10,15
222,Feeling at home once again,"After my first stay in 2011 I returned this October to the Roxford Lodge. I booked the same room as last time (economy room) and was delighted to find that they have picked up on some of the criticism by earlier guest and made some nice adjustments and improvements. 
This room is rather small - that's why it is also rather inexpensive. A great value for money really. 
Last year there was still a one-person infrared sauna installed in the room making the small space even more crowded. The television set was old and there was a rather worn ironing board attached to the wall. All these things have changed. They kicked out the pointless sauna to create a more spacious room. The TV was replaced by a modern flat screen with DVD player and ironing board has disappeared. Nice changes!
I haven't seen the other larger rooms by I suspect they also have undergone some improvements here and there. 
All in all this hotel is just incredible cosy and the friendly and welcoming staff creates a nice and warm atmosphere. The saloon room is so comfortable and nice to sit and read or have some complimentary tea or coffee that is offered virtually all day and night. When we were there this fall they had the fireplace going which was especially nice. 
The hotel is very clean and well kept. The breakfast room is comfortable and creates a relaxing atmosphere to start the day. Since breakfast is cooked freshly upon order for each guest, it takes a little while. If you are in a hurry to start your sightseeing tour or heading back to the airport, I recommend you grab something on the way. Offers are plenty in Dublin. 
But for a relaxed wonderful breakfast there is nothing better than that little room at the Roxford Lodge. 
The hotel is located in Ballsbridge which is a little south of the busy city centre close to the Aviva Stadium and the RDS. Nevertheless all the major attractions like Stephen's green, Trinity College, Dublin castle, Temple bar and Grafton street are just a pleasant 20-30min walk away. 
There is also a public bus stop directly in front of the hotel, but I wouldn't really recommend taking the bus. They just run at pretty irregular intervals and get stuck in traffic a lot. 
For trips to Howth or to the southern coast you can catch the DART train at Lansdowne Road - just a 10 minute walk away from the hotel. 
Transfer from the airport is easy and comfortable. I recommend you either take the aircoach service at 8€ per person running about 45-60mins which stops about 100yards from the hotel or grab a taxi at the airport which will cost about 25-35€ depending on traffic and travelling time. 
I am sure I will be back in the future.",5,2012,10,15
222,Fine Choice For a Dublin Visit,"We recently stayed 5 nights in Roxford Lodge and were very pleased.  Breakfast was excellent and the rooms were as nice as most upscale  B&Bs, but the nicest part was the extremely pleasant and helpful staff, every one we met.
The bus stops right in front for a short ride into the city center, or it is a 15 to 20 minute walk to Grafton St., Temple Bar, Trinity or O'Connell St.  And the walk is very safe.
Our room (executive suite) was spacious and well worth the extra cost since we were there 5 nights with a month's worth of luggage.  The room was quiet--never heard anything from other rooms and with the All-Ireland Football Championship on we were expecting some celebrating sounds.
It was a great place to stay and we will recommend Roxford Lodge to our friends heading to Dublin.",5,2012,10,14
222,Perfect place to start our trip,"We stayed here our first two nights in Ireland and it was just what we needed where we needed to be.  A pleasant and safe area of town, convenient to bus and DART, and even an nice walk to the center of the city.  Jennifer greeted us with a happy demeanor and coffee and snacks.  The room was small but had all we needed.  Around the corner is a wonderful neighborhood pub, Jack Ryans (next to Beggar's Bush barracks) where we ate one night and talked to locals until 1:00 AM!    Aircoach from/to the airport stops at the Schoolhouse Hotel up the street, a short walk.  The breakfast was very good.  Not as inexpensive as a B&B but worth the extra if you want the anonymity and conveniences of a hotel.  We would certainly stay here again.",4,2012,10,12
222,Little gem,"I've just returned from Dublin having stayed at the Roxford Lodge hotel and our entire stay was brilliant. 
We had an efficient but friendly check-in when we arrived and had a pot of tea brought to our room within five minutes. The room was spotlessly clean and well appointed. We had plenty of plug sockets for our electricals and these were in both the three and two pin styles. There was a tv with a good selection of English and Irish channels as well as a DVD player with a selection of DVDs (our room just so happened to have one of my favourite films available!). The bed was comfy and a good size as well as having a large duvet which was perfect now that the weather is getting cooler. 
In the morning my partner and I both had the full Irish breakfast - it tasted really lovely and was a generous portion which kept us going to dinner time. The lady serving the breakfast was really friendly and brought over everything we might need for our meal to save us having to get up.
When we checked out the young lady on reception was extremely helpful. She was chatty and interested in what we thought of our stay and gave us recommendations on things to do as the rain had spoiled our previous plans. When we agreed on visiting the Guinness Storehouse she was more than happy to book our tickets online which saved us a few euros and also allowed us to jump the extremely long queue. She even called our taxi for us. 
We're planning to return to Ireland next year and we will definitely be staying here again. The building itself is a beautiful old building which is kept spotless and I truly felt that the customer service and little touches make this hotel stand out.",5,2012,10,12
222,"Good location, good value","My wife and I highly enjoyed the Roxford. It's quite walkable to old Dublin (20"") or you can take the bus. Also very walkable to the O2 Arena. The hotel is located in an attractive and safe part of town. We found the room to be very functional and quirky (sauna cubicle in the corner with a car radio inserted on the outside), walk up a few step to a mid-level bathroom). The bed was very comfortable, similar to our upper end beds at home. Plenty of outlets were available for electronics. Breakfast was very good, but I would recommend the Irish Breakfast only once and if you take cholesterol medication! Would definitely stay there again.",4,2012,10,09
222,Very friendly staff,"Good location and very friendly staff. Our room was well apointed and comfortable. Perhaps a bit small but adequate for us, cosy even. We had the full Irish breakfast - the works, which was very nice with generous proportions.

There is bus stop to the airport and city center is only a few hundred yards away. Which is very handy. The staff were very pleasant and helpful with information about restraurants and things to see in the city. Excellent place to stay.",5,2012,10,09
222,Comfy beds,"The bed was comfy, the location a little out of the way but a nice walk. The infra-red sauna was just weird (and I have one at home). The space would be better used for a wardrobe (we used the sauna to store golf clubs). Don't see the point of a fax machine in the room either. The bathroom was small - could have been bigger without a sauna in the bedroom!

All in all, meh.",3,2012,10,07
222,Part hotel and part B&B,"I struggled with the rating on the Roxford Lodge Hotel.  I was very close to putting it at very good.  However, the main item that pushed me to drop it to average was price.  It's a fine place to stay if it fits your needs, but make sure you do the research.  I would stay there again.

Pros:
- Secure Gated parking (you must get a code before you can enter parking in the tight alley behind the Lodge).
- Location is about 15 min walk to the City Center of Dublin and there is a bus stop out front.
- Amenities: There were a lot of extras in the room which we didn't use: (a sauna, fax machine).
- Privacy & Noise: We had a room at the back facing the parking.  It was fairly private and we didn't have any noise issues.
- Cleanliness:  Everything seemed very clean in our room and common areas.
- Breakfast:  Great breakfast spread with good hot options.

Pro and Con:
- Staff:  We interacted with three people in the staff.  Two of them were extremely nice and helpful.  The other seemed almost bothered at our presence.

Cons:
- Our room was really small, but this was in Dublin near the city center.
- Price: It wasn't terrible, but more than you'd pay for other B&Bs.

Extras:  One girl on the staff (the really helpful one) assisted us in getting on-line discounted tickets to the Guinness Storehouse.",3,2012,10,04
222,Good Value,We found the hotel to be a little quirky but nice. The room was clean and quiet. We would have been unhappy if we had paid 160 euro for this room but for the  89 euro we paid it was a good value. We found the receptionist on duty when we checked in to be unfriendly and unhelpful. The receptionist on duty at checkout was very friendly and helpful. Ask for directions to the hotel parking before you arrive. The hotel seems to only want to recommend the Chop House restaurant but on the same street as the Chop House is a very good and less expensive restaurant called Junior's.,4,2012,10,01
222,Over priced B&B,"On arriving at the Roxford Lodge 'Hotel' I have to be honest and say I was extremely disappointed.

The Roxford Lodge is advertised on booking.com as a boutique hotel; it is nothing more than a B&B, a very poorly laid out B&B.

I booked this hotel based on the description and images - do not be fooled!!

It cost us £160 for one night, room only.  I have no issue with paying this price for a hotel if that is what you get, but we were presented with an almost basement room, with a small window, allowing no light and a clear view from the passing public outside, not to mention the fact that the bus stopped right outside the view of our window.  The room was dimly lit, the room lights themselves were very poor, there was a wooden box smack bang in the room that can only be described as a tardis, turns out this was the sauna that booking.com referred to??? a wooden boxed sauna in an already cramped bedroom?? I don't get it.

The room came with a jacuzzi bath; sounds luxurious . . . it wasn't!! the bath was nothing more than a small house tub with holes, it was like something from the 80's, the artificial lighting in the bathroom was also wooful and you couldn't swing a cat in it! 

On trying to navigate our way around the area to go for dinner, drinks, we got very poor directions, in fact the receptionist told us to just stop and ask someone!! God bless Google maps eh!

On leaving the hotel, the receptionist was rude and did not even ask how our stay was, which to me just show poor customer service and bad manners.

To be fair to the Roxford, it was clean, so certainly if you are looking for an over priced B&B, the roxford is most defianetly for you . . . All in all I can safely say we wont be back and would be very reluctant to book anything further through booking.com",2,2012,09,27
222,Nice clean on the city bus line.,We arrived at the Roxford Lodge early after an all night flight and were immediately taken to the nice living room for coffee and tea.  Our room was vacated as we sat and they cleaned and took us there directly.  Breakfast was very nice and filling.  We used a 3 day bus pass to tour Dublin.  Restaurants were close and great.,5,2012,09,26
222,Home away from Home,"Our 2nd time staying and we really enjoyed our stay yet again, can't wait for our next visit 
It's become our ""home"" in Dublin!! Rooms are lovely, location excellent, service brilliant and the Breakfast is to die for",5,2012,09,26
222,Great little hotel walking distance from downtown Dublin,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying 2 nights at the Roxford Lodge, in a lovely part of Dublin.  We could walk 2 blocks to one of the best Dublin restaurants, The Chop House, for lunch or dinner, as well as other restaurants within easy walking distance.  It's less than a mile from Trinity College and downtown Dublin, the Guinness Storehouse, etc.  
The full Irish breakfast served in a small dining room was fabulous, with many choices.  The staff were gracious and accommodating.  We had a very small room on the second floor, but we booked late and spent little time there.
We would stay there again anytime!",5,2012,09,24
222,"Good choice, good stay","We enjoyed our stay at what seemed more like a b&b than a hotel, with a quirky charm and a nice personalized feeling. The staff, as everyone has said, could not have been  more friendly and helpful, and the offer to serve coffee/tea any time they are requested was lovely. The living room, where we had our coffee, was charming in an old-fashioned style. While we had been concerned about not being in a more central location, in the end we were glad to be in Ballsbridge, which was such a pretty part of town and easily accessible to the center. I’d say about a 15-minute walk to Trinity and alternatively a bus right across the street, which we never took. We did feel a little squashed in the room, which would have been a fine size if the sauna had not been there--we would have rather had a closet or wardrobe in its place, as there was definitely not enough storage for our things. The bathroom and jacuzzi were nice, though. We were in a room overlooking the parking lot; there was never a noise problem, though; we were only sad that they turned off the bubbling fountain at night, when it would have been nice to hear it--just a personal quirk. We had breakfast there only once, as we didn’t want a full breakfast and one of the staff sent us to a really nice coffee shop nearby for scones and coffee. Having a computer and printer in the living room was a really nice touch to print out our boarding passes; not sure why you'd need the printer in the room in addition, though. The good restaurant advice was much appreciated.",4,2012,09,22
222,Nice place,"Rooms well appointed,clean and tidy but could do without the sauna.
Breakfast was very good with something for everyone.
Staff absolutely wonderful, very helpful, go out of their way to make your stay a very memorable one.",4,2012,09,21
222,"Great staff, generous breakfast, small room","We visited this hotel as we were going to a concert in the Aviva stadium, The hotel is ideally located for this with the added bonus of free, on site, secure parking which is a rarity in Dublin.

From entering the hotel until check out, the hotel staff were wonderful, very friendly and ever helpful.

We stayed in a double room for our visit and while it was very clean and quaint it was quite a tight squeeze. The bathroom could do with more venitlation but this too was squeaky clean.

The breakfast the next morning was very good. There was a good selection of fruits, cereals and juices. The full Irish breakfast was very generous and tasty. Again, staff were outstanding with their service.

Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is good value considering the free parking, inclusion of breakfast and proximity to the Aviva stadium.",4,2012,09,18
222,Very pleasant experience.,Excellent car parking and staff could not have been mre helpful. Room small but very well finished. Good breakfast and good service.,4,2012,09,18
222,Great for us,"We arrived here after a very long journey to be greeted with professionalism and friendliness. We were a little early so they offered to store our luggage and they gave us the name of a place to eat (The Chop House) which was fantastic.When we went back our room was ready and our luggage had been placed there for us. The room was absolutely lovely and the standard of cleanliness was excellent. My only issue with the bathroom was that the toilet seat did not have a lid, but because the room was wheelchair friendly we understood why there wasn't one. Maybe they could have a detachable one put in place? The room was a good size, but would have had more room if the infra red sauna wasn't there. Its not something we would ever use, but I'm sure others may.The staff were incredibly helpful and the breakfast were really well done and plentiful. Roxford Lodge is also in a very very nice area and an easy 15 minute walk into Dublin. We would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. Very reasonably priced as well.",5,2012,09,16
222,Good but why 4th hotel in Dublin?,"We stayed in this hotel 5 days last week. It was OK but we don't understand why this hotel is so highly rated? The room was large and clean, so was the bathroom. However, the staff wasn't that great, especially one girl who was rather cold. We didn't use the sauna and jacuzzi but yes: they were in our room. There was no mini-bar though, which might be instead. Besides there was very strange and loud noise coming from the draining in the bathroom. 
We ate a continental breakfast there once only (on the first day) and it certainly wasn't the best one: rather poor selection of cereals and yogurts, croissants ended but I must admit that the staff got some more in a few minutes. 
Also we were not given any new shampoo or showering gel when they ended. Although again: when we asked for them at the reception, they were brought to us. 
To sum up: a decent hotel but not we encountered some inconvenience there.",3,2012,09,13
222,One of the best hotels,"Stayed in the hotel last week. Receptionist extremely helpful, showed me to my room. Room was very clean, very comfortable, did not have time to use the sauna, (in my room). Free car parking. 15 minute walk into town. Check out was fast, different receptionist, equally as nice as her colleague. I will be back.",5,2012,09,10
222,The owners make this hotel a great place to stay,Desmond and his sister really bent over backward to assist us.  They helped us find a place to buy a specific t-shirt that a friend had requested.  They waited on us hand and foot really.  When we requested a room change it was made effortlessly.  It's a comfortable hotel with a very good breakfast but what makes it a great hotel are the owners.  Truly nice people.,5,2012,09,06
222,Very pleasant stay,"We spent two nights at the Roxford Lodge, and had a very pleasant stay.
We were happy with the location: it's not in the middle of town, but it's a pleasant walk in, and there's good bus service. I think any inconvenience is made up for by the more peaceful location.
Our room was fairly small, but well-appointed. It had a sliding door onto a patio area with a nice fountain, as well as an in-room sauna (which we never actually used). The most annoying part was the shower: there was no barrier between the shower and the rest of the bathroom, so water would spread across the entire floor. The room appeared to have some handicapped-accessible features, and this might have been one of those; other rooms might differ. We were quite happy with how quiet the room was.
We never had breakfast at the hotel, but each day we did take advantage of the complimentary in-room tea and coffee service, which came with a nice assortment of biscuits, and was a much-appreciated touch.
Service was always friendly and helpful. We appreciated the secure carpark.",5,2012,09,04
222,"Helpful, courteous staff!","We loved our stay at Roxford Lodge. It was comfortable, quiet, clean, and lovely. The layout of our room was very unique but that only added to its charm. The pictures on their website totally do it justice -- we were almost disappointed to only be staying there one night!

I also have to say that the staff at Roxford Lodge were the most helpful and friendly out of nearly every place we stayed in Ireland. One front desk worker helped us figure out the best and cheapest way to get all the way across town with our luggage to pick up our rental car. We also forgot to ask for a receipt when we paid for our room, emailed them, and had a response with a Word doc attached the very next day.

I highly recommend Roxford Lodge to anyone!",5,2012,09,02
222,Loved Roxford Lodge!,"We just returned from our Ireland/UK trip.  Roxford Lodge was the first of six places we stayed when we flew into Dublin.  It stands out as one of our favorites.  The hospitality we received there was wonderful.  As soon as we arrived we were brought tea and biscuits to our room, which was much needed after a long flight.  This continued all through our stay - tea and treats whenever we returned from a long day of sight seeing.  The breakfast was definitely the best of the whole trip -- huge and delicious and served with a smile.  

The location was really nice in Ballsbridge, Dublin.  It was a 10-15 minute walk to the city center and really beautiful on a tree-lined street with brick townhouses everywhere.  We loved it!  

The room was cozy and nice with a large selection of DVDs to watch.  We were sad to leave when it was time to drive to Galway!",5,2012,08,20
222,Lovely place,"Had a really enjoyable overnight stay in Roxford. Nice spacious room, very clean. An added feature I liked was a specific drinking water tap. We also had a small fridge, which with a baby is very useful.
I would definitely return there, it is in a beautiful part of Dublin. Secure car parking is also a bonus.

My only gripe is the directions from Dublin Airport on the website which we followed carefully but they were not clear at all...in saying that there were roadworks at the O2 but the stress of being lost in Dublin wasn't nice. When we finally found a landmark to telephone Roxford the guy on reception was very helpful. He brought us tea and biscuits on arrival too!",5,2012,08,09
222,An excellent base to explore Dublin!,"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved everything about it. There's a genuine concern from all of the management and staff and they work hard to service their guests. Our room was spacious, clean and well decorated. Breakfast did not come with our room package but we found it more than worth the price and enjoyed it every morning during our stay. The hotel is on a lovely street that we found convenient to a convenience store, restaurants and Dublin. We would definitely recommend and visit again if we find ourselves in Dublin again!",5,2012,08,07
222,Great stay!!!,"This is a great, quirky hotel and I can't fault a single thing.  Hotel is 20 minute walk from the City Centre which when the sun is shining is a lovely walk.  There is a bus stop right outside for the days when the weather isn't great.
Reception service was great,  Very polite and helpful.  We arrived very early (10am) and our room wasn't ready but they let us leave our bags in a secure room and on returning to the hotel later on in the day after exploring Dublin our bags had already been placed in the room for us.
Our room was on the ground floor and was gorgeous!!  It had a large, comfy, king size bed with jacuzzi and infrared sauna.  Bliss!!!  Not sure which rooms are meant to be noisy but our room was so quiet and peaceful.  We were located near the lift and I was worried we would hear it revving up every night but we didn't hear a sound!! Room was cleaned each day and fresh towels left.
All in all a great hotel and I would highly recommend it!  Can't wait to stay there again!",5,2012,08,07
222,Excellent place,"Wonderful experience. This small hotel is located in a quiet street close to the city center.The room was very comfortable and clean. We had even a sauna and a Jacuzzi  available.The breakfast was  really delicious and at very high standard. The hospitality was warm and very kind, It is more a b&b  than a hotel, the common space is confortable and with an internet point for the guests.  I definitely recommend this Hotel and I will stay again next time I’ll go to Dublin",5,2012,08,07
222,A well managed Hotel.,"We arrived after midnight,Agnes opened the back parking gates for our rented car,she showrd us the rooms and we slept like babies.very clean,feels like at home.we had two rooms for us and 3 boys, 18;16 and 10. DVD in each room with bunch of movies,Fax with papers,sawnna and a jacuzi tab also in the rooms.the brakfast was perfect with a personal touch.we got every thing and much more.i could keep write but no words to describe.Taxi cab will cost you 8 euro to the center (one way) ask the driver for his phone number and call him if you'll need him later or when ever u need him.for us it worked great,spacialy when we forgot our camera in the cab...we called the driver and he came back .Good luck with your trip,and drive safe.watch the left car mirror ;-)

222,One of Dublins hidden gems,"With all the 4 and 5 star hotels in Dublin city centre charging astronomical prices for snobbish service and rooms which are ultimately shined up to look better than they are, the Roxford Lodge, coming in with 3 stars, is one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The Hotel itself is small but it uses every last inch of that space to a high standard. There is a free securely gated private car park to the rear, which in Dublin is very rare. We were greated by a very friendly receptionist who brought us to the door of our room. She gave us a tour of the room, which was a little smaller than I expected. However, I soon saw that it did not need to be any bigger. As I said, this hotel uses every inch of space to a high standard. The room came with a large flat screen, HD TV. A dvd player, a large and good quality selection of dvds including some very recent releases, a good selection of TV channels, a large comfortable bed, a jacuzzi bathtub, and an infared sauna suitable for 2 people to use comfortably. There was also a writing/vanity desk and a small coffee table with 2 chairs. Perfect for the welcoming pot of tea and selection of biscuits the receptionist brought to our room. That was a lovely touch, especially since there were also tea making facilities and a fridge in the room. The final top marks for this hotel go to the amazing full irish breakfast we got the next morning.",5,2012,08,06
222,Fabulous,"I took the aircoach from the airport as it went to a stop very close to the hotel, about 7 mins walk.  There are steep steps up to the front through a lovely garden but it was worth the climb up those steps.  The receptionist was very welcoming and took me to my room straight after check in.  I was in heaven.  An excellent bed, a welcoming pot of tea (or coffee if preferred), a large bathroom, tv and the extra’s: jacussi and sauna.  I have stayed in many hotels on my 3 month trip and many have been more expensive but this was the one I remember for being the most luxurious.  It even had free car parking at the back.",5,2012,08,03
222,Terrific boutique hotel,"The Roxford Lodge Hotel is located in a residential neighborhood about a 15 minute walk from Grafton Street.  It's perfectly situated for a quiet and comfortable night's sleep.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, quiet and comfortable.  Did I mention that the hotel is quiet?  I emphasize this point because as you read many reviews, people complain that their rooms were noisy due to street traffic and bar activity.  The breakfast was yummy. The staff was attentive and helpful.  This hotel is a little off the beaten path but well worth the extra minutes of travel into town. The rooms are very well priced.  We were in a family room that was roomy and comfortable.  I highly recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel.",5,2012,08,03
222,Atmosphere of a B&B,"Although Roxford Lodge is a 20 room hotel, it has the atmosphere of a B&B, in terms of personal service and standard of facilities. 
The rooms do vary in size and comfort. We first had a tiny, cramped and noisy room, but when we asked for another room we were assigned a much more spacious and comfortable room next day. Everything is very clean and the beds are really good. The bathroom is OK, but water pressure is pretty low. We had a small infra red sauna in the room as well as a jacuzzi, but we did not use them. Free wifi works well.
Breakfast is served on order and is very good, but it takes time.
Service is great and staff is very helpful. On our return home we even got an e-mail that one of our party of 7 had left some belongings in the room and they wanted to send it to our home address; fantastic service!
Also the location is great, on walking distance of Dublin center and very near to Aviva Stadium.",4,2012,07,31
222,Alright hotel / Good location,"In it's favor, it's in a good location, and has secure car parking. The car parking is a bit tight though and may require some creative reversing. Other than that the room was ok, few surprises.. like there was a sauna for two in the corner of the bedroom, probably a plus for some people, but not for me.. would have been better if the air-con worked, and maybe the room could've been brought down to under 24degrees.",3,2012,07,29
222,5 Star Service,"From the moment we walked through the door, we were treated like rock stars.  We were a bit early for our stay, as our flight arrived at 7 AM, so they gladly took our bags to hold until our room was ready.  Desmond offered us water and any help we needed.

When the room was ready, we were more than pleased.  Large room, very spacious, excellent bathroom, clean, along with a TV, and a sauna!?!  Who needs a sauna?  I was still impressed that it was in the room, though we didn't opt to use it.

Excellent breakfast the following morning, though not included, it was still delicious.

More than happy with the stay and we'd stay again.  Only small issue was walking distance to city center.  Probably about 15 minutes walk, but at least you avoided the crowd.

There is a bus stop a block away which is very handy, and the pick up and drop off tourist busses stop about 3 blocks away.",5,2012,07,25
222,Nice surprise!,We were upgraded to The Executive Suite due to a 'blip' in the booking system. A very nice surprise with four poster bed and jacuzzi! Staff were all very helpful and lovely cooked breakfast served with fresh orange juice set us up for the day. Highly recommended.,4,2012,07,24
222,A great B&B!,The gal at the front was wonderful. The room was very nice and the parking was behind a locked gate so I didn't have to worry about my car. The food was great and I had a very enjoyable stay at the Roxford Lodge.,5,2012,07,21
222,Great Place to Stay(maybe we shouldnt recommended it as it might become too popular or expensive!),"We highly recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel. We stayed here twice, at the beginning and end of our first trip to Ireland and really enjoyed our stay. From the moment we checked in and were offered tea and coffee in the lovely lounge to when we checked out we really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were lovely and clean and the beds comfortable. A short bus ride into the city with the bus stop at the door made it easy to get into town, and the car park at the back very handy for the rental car.The staff were very friendly and helpful and were always ready to provide a cup of tea. 5 stars",5,2012,07,16
222,Excellent ending to our stay in Ireland,"Spent the last two nights of our two week trip at the Roxford Lodge.  While it is a bit of a walk to the center of Dublin, it's not that far.  We managed just fine with two adults and two kids (13 and 9).  The Roxford far exceeded my expectations and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The room was beautiful, very clean and we marveled at the inventive use of space.  From the cedar closet, the room's foyer and the in-room sauna, very impressive!  Lots of little interesting and eye catching details throughout.  The staff was very helpful.  Parking was a big plus too.  We tucked our car safely in the Roxford's lot and didn't touch it again till it was time to leave.  I feel like we didn't spend enough time in Dublin so our next trip will include more time in Dublin and will most definitely call for a return trip to the Roxford Lodge Hotel!",5,2012,07,15
222,Loved it,"We stayed for 3 nights here and thought it was great! We had never been to Dublin before and weren't sure of the best area to stay, but based on our time here we thoroughly recommend the Roxford. It is in a lovely tree lined street in a very nice area of the city, with buses right at the door. Having said that, we didn't need the bus as it was an easy flat 15 minute walk past some beautiful Georgian buildings into the heart of the city.

As soon as we arrived we were offered tea and biscuits in the lounge which was very welcome after a long drive. Our room had so many extras, sauna, en-suite, extremely well arranged, spotless and very comfortable. We were on the ground floor and we had a sliding door into the secure car park area at the back which made it very easy to get heavy luggage in and out.

In the room the bed was very comfortable, there was a DVD player with a great selection of DVDs, and the lighting in particular was strong and well placed for reading and working; a lot of hotels seem to be very keen on oddly placed mood lighting which can be frustrating. The bathroom was excellent though the shower screen wasn't quite long enough over the bath and the floor kept getting wet. Great shower with good pressure and lots of hot water.

Breakfast was great with a wide range of hot and cold food, newspapers to read, and very helpful and attentive staff.
Staff at reception were also very helpful; we were able to give them a bag of washing which they sent off with the daily laundry, and they gave us lots of information about buses and restaurants.

Excellent Internet (both wired and wireless) plus a small printer and fax in your room - superb !!

Overall, excellent to stay at and good value for money.

",5,2012,07,14
222,"Excellent service, clean, friendly and a little quirky.","Stayed here for a night going to a concert, very happy with service, location and room. Not sure that the Sauna in the room added to the experience but it didn't detract! Breakfast was lovely and we will certainly be back.",5,2012,07,13
222,Great location in Leafy Area,"Easy access from the airport via the Airport Bus allows you to stay in the lovely leafy suburb of Ballsbridge. It's an easy 20 minutes walk to the city cente, and 5 minutes walk to some great local pubs and restaurants. Roxford Lodge offers the best breakfast in Ireland - amazing choice from both the continental and full breakfast menus. The house itself is beautifully furnished, and the breakfast room charming. Our downstairs room had every piece of technology for the business traveller, but this took up valuable space. The bed was very comfy, the bathroom more than adequate, but the noise of water continually gushing down pipes from upstairs rooms, and the neighbour's barking dogs, was an annoying problem. Despite this, we had an enjoyable stay at Roxford Lodge.",4,2012,07,09
222,Ideal Hotel for exploring Dublin.,"A  week end break to Dublin, and 2 nights stay at the Ruxford Lodge. Friendly and helpful staff, nice warm comfortable rooms complete with jacucis. free tea and biscuits served in your room whenever you want ( 11.15 after returning from theatre ). free wifi too. TV and dvd player in room and a selection of up to date dvds to watch too. The full Irish breakfast is a must for setting you up for a days exploring in Dublin. The no 4 and 7 buses stop right outside front door so great for getting into the city in about 10 mins to see all the sights. Ideal for the tourist and businessman alike. Will be back.",4,2012,07,09
222,A nice place to stay,"We stayed four nights at the Roxford, two families in two rooms next to each other.  It was a great arrangement as our two rooms were on a wing that has no other rooms, so we could keep our doors open and go back and forth. We felt very welcomed - Desmond at the front desk was very friendly and patient, taking time to explain all the details of the rooms. The rooms were comfortable and very attractive, if a little over-the-top extravagant (didn't use the sauna or the fax machine, and the motion sensor lights were irritating.)  Location-wise, it was a bit off the beaten path but just a couple blocks from the Grand canal and only a 15-20 minute walk to St. Stephens Green, Trinity College, the museums, etc. and farther on for other attractions, but very walkable for people who like to walk, even in the rain.  Breakfast was great, and very civilized, with newspapers and self-serve coffee and tea and lots of choices.  There are several very good restaurants a block or two away.  The Chop House has awesome steaks, and Junior's Pizza is great for foodies traveling with kids. But it's best to make reservations for these - our first night in town all the local restaurants were packed and we had to walk quite a ways to find another place to eat.  We ended up at the Docklands for dinner, which took us about 45 minutes, but it was a great treat to see the lighted modern buildings and sculptures there by the water. All in all it was a nice place to stay, away from the hoards of tourists but close enough to most of the sights we came to Dublin to see.",5,2012,07,07
222,Not my idea of luxury!,"We stayed in the executive suite for our short honeymoon in Dublin, along with our young son.  The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, but a little shabby and in need of a fresh coat of paint.  We were disappointed to find on our arrival that the kitchen was not open for evening meals, and felt the hotel should have advised us of this in advance - although there are plenty of places to eat nearby, it's not easy to go out for dinner with a toddler in tow!  However, we did receive complementary drinks after raising this issue.  The manner of one of the receptionists was rather abrupt to say the least, and only one of the white wines listed on the menu was actually available.  On the plus side, the jacuzzi was great (we didn't use the sauna), and the breakfast delicious.  Overall, though, not worth the money in my opinion, and I wouldn't stay here again in a hurry.",3,2012,07,07
222,Well worth the Walk,"A friend and I stayed here on our recent trip to Ireland. Not only were the staff friendly and helpful, they were so kind. Nothing was better after a day of walking, touring and sightseeing to be greeted with a hello and would we like some tea and coffee. YES we would love the tea and coffee. the beds were very comfortable. And the location is definitely close enough to walk to all the attractions.  Thank you for making our stay so wonderful.",5,2012,07,04
222,Almost trying too hard!,"This hotel is well suited for tourists and visitors to Dublin, rather than business. I've used this hotel twice. It's like a labyrinth with more rooms than you'd think! On both stays at this hotel we were in different rooms both of which had a sauna and jucuzzi bath included. To be honest, this seems like overkill to me - in one room I'd rather have had the space! We never had time to use these facilities. The lack of space in that room is really my only complaint.
Having said that, each room is very well fitted out, with kettle, big flat screen TV with DVD, and some DVD's to play too (I watched ""A History of Ireland""!), safety deposit box and small fridge. The rooms got quite hot at night, and although there was some sort of temperature control on the wall it didn't seem to effect room temperature - there wasn't air conditioning as far as I could tell. There is free secure parking, and each entrance has security locks.
The staff are very attentive, helpful and smart. Breakfast is wonderful, with a huge selection of cooked and cold items. The hotel is spotlessly clean, if a little old, and the beds are comfortable. A screaming child in another room during the night was a small problem.
The hotel is within a mile of Dublin centre. Throughly recommended.",5,2012,07,03
222,Nice way to end Ireland trip,"We spent two nights at the Roxford Lodge (Jun 27 and 27, 2012). We loved the proximity to downtown Dublin. It was an easy, 15-minute walk. There were great pubs and restaurants located nearby as well.

Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Breakfast was delicious!",5,2012,07,01
222,A Not So Little Gem :),"The Roxford Lodge is a Gem of a place tucked not too far away from the centre of town, I would say a 15min walk and you're there, local bus stop outside with airport coach stop 5mins away. Staff especially Stephanie who I dealt with the most was great tea or coffee offered anytime whilst waiting in the beautifull lounge.  
The room we had (Executive Suite) was more than we expected ie; a seperate conservatory style lounge leading onto a balcony, the space was great, jacuzzi bath out of this world hope we did'nt make too much noise whilst singing in it and watching tv brill :) sperate bathroom/shower, kitchen with cooking facilities, dishwasher, washer/dryer, fridge, bar area with fridge. Large tv, cd, dvd, satelite tv everything you could wish for.

The owners have made great use of all the space and we will return soon as we never got round to using the sauna that was in the room. 

My only complaint and it's only for the sake of making one was to have a wooden spoon to use in the kitchen because I'm a sad person who likes to cook on holiday :)

10/10 for the Roxford. PERFECT",5,2012,06,30
222,Great service,"Thank you Desmond for being awesome!!  Rooms were great (jacuzzi bath, flat screen with selection of DVDs including kids flix, and only place we stayed in Ireland with mini fridge in room - great for kids who need milk!) but what made this stay extra special was Desmond (front desk guy) who spent his night morning and afternoon helping me call around town for my lost rental car key including multiple calls to hertz and locksmith. Super friendly staff with ornate and comfy rooms (my folks had a sauna in their room).  My 1.5 year-old son loved the huge park that was walking distance as well as the cats that hung around outside. Great for toddlers!",5,2012,06,30
222,Excellent!,"A beautifully decorated, small hotel on a quiet, tree-lined street in the Ballsbridge residential and embassy area. Very convenient access via bus to central Dublin. Breakfasts were outstanding.",5,2012,06,28
222,Great Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Roxford while in Dublin.  We were welcomed with tea and felt like Royalty.  Even though our room faced the street it was completely quiet.  The room was lovely, but a bit small.  Ours had an infrared sauna which didn't interest us - I would have preferred somewhere to put the second suitcase instead.  However we didn't spend much time in the room so it wasn't really an issue.  Our bathroom had a jet tub that we appreciated after a full day of walking around Dublin.  The bed was very comfortable.

The variety of food offered at breakfast was amazing - fresh croissants that were fabulous - more than anywhere else we stayed during our vacation.

There is a bus stop in front of the hotel or if you're ambitious, a 25-minute walk to St. Stephen's Green.  The Air Coach service lets you off less than two blocks away, when travelling to/from the airport, which was great.",5,2012,06,24
222,Absolutely wonderful!,"Our room was very clean, homey and accessible. The staff were extremely helpful and made us feel like valued relatives, not strangers. (Special kudos to Desmond.)  There was a variety of breakfast options, so we did not leave hungry. We loved every minute of our stay!",5,2012,06,17
222,Friendly staff and a great stay,"We began and ended our trip to Europe at this hotel and stayed in two different rooms here. The first room was in need of a decor update and felt pretty cramped; between two adults and two suitcases, there just wasn't a lot of room to maneuver. The second room was far more spacious and also featured a more modern-looking bathroom. 

Positive points about the Roxford Lodge:
* The staff was extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful with providing directions, information on area attractions, etc.
* The hotel and surrounding neighborhood were both quiet
* The breakfast was delicious

Neutral/not-so-positive observations (depending on your point of view):
* The clientele here is older. We're in our 30s and the vast majority of the people staying here were seniors. This wasn't necessarily a negative thing for us, but it may be for you if you are looking for a more youthful, energetic setting.
* There is a 15- to 20-minute walk to the main city. We personally enjoyed the exercise, and the OK weather combined with the late sunsets in June made for a pleasant walking experience. However, in foul weather, I'm sure the walk feels like an eternity.

Overall, we felt that the Roxford Lodge was an excellent value for the money and would recommend this place to people who aren't bothered about not being in the center of the action.",4,2012,06,17
222,"Quiet, upscale neighborhood!","I highly recommend this hotel. The service is superb. We had a room on lower level which included a patio with bubbling fountains, sauna (who takes a suana?), whirlpool and very clean!

",5,2012,06,16
222,Wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"During our visit to Ireland in May 2012, we stayed one night at the Foxford Lodge Hotel,  in Dublin Ireland.  We thought this was going to be a stay at a hotel like facility but was very pleasantly surprised to find it more like a bed and breakfast.  Our only regret was that we did not book a longer stay.
  
There were three of us traveling together and we stayed in the family suite, which consisted of 1 room with a double and a single bed, a full bath with a Jacuzzi bath, small sauna, as well as a small table and chairs.  The room was clean and bright.  There was a patio just outside our room.  

When we arrived we met Desmond.  He served us tea while we waited for our room and answered all of our questions with a smile and a genuine interest in making our stay memorable.

We opted for the continental breakfast which included a plate of ham and cheeses, fresh fruit and yogurts, porridge, cereals, croissants and Irish brown bread, tea, coffee and juice.  Agnes, our server, was very pleasant and delightful.  

I would highly recommend the Foxford Lodge to anyone planning a trip to Dublin.  Location is ideal to the buses and is within walking distance to many of the city's attractions.  We truly enjoyed the staff, the breakfast, and found the accommodations to be very pleasant.  Should we return to Dublin, we would definitely book our stay at Foxford Lodge.

Thank you Desmond and Agnes!",5,2012,06,12
222,"Despite the great reviews, we were not thrilled.","As we walked towards the door of the Roxford Lodge, we met other guests who raved about the place.  We had booked the last room available, the ‘Executive Suite.’  It was a small, fully equipped apartment.  We just wanted a room.  The price of the suite was reasonable for what it was, but more than double what we need to spend.  OK, I went in with my eyes open.
I have struggled for over 2 weeks about how to rate it.  So, here are the positives and negatives.
Pros:
•	The house has considerable charm, especially in its unique and personal decorative style.  Although it is not to everyone’s taste.  Some might call it a hodge-podge of kitsch.
•	On arrival, the owner presented us with a nice box of Butler chocolates and a mid-priced bottle of wine.  That eased the pain of the room charge a little.
•	The office space included a desktop computer, printer-copier, speakers and plenty of work-space.
•	The laundry room included a washer, dryer and ironing equipment.
•	There are closets galore.  
•	The hotel is a courteous, hospitable place.
•	There was adequate, secure parking behind the house.
•	The Executive Suite is well worth the cost for a large family that is staying for a week.
•	Decorations included an overdose of Tiffany-like furnishings (a chandelier, lamps too numerous to count, red velvet swan-arm settee, velvet arm-chairs, small tables, bar-stools and much more (telephones and TVs all over).  Yes, that is a lot of stuff, and I cannot think of anything that was not there.  It is like being at home.  
•	The bus stops in front of the hotel, so you need not walk.
Cons:
•	What annoyed me no end was the non-refundable 15 Euro booking charge.  I will grant that it cost us nothing since we stayed there.  I do not EVER recall such an unfriendly request in any hotel, in any country – and I have seen a few hundred hotels!
•	A few things were slightly worn on the edges (You expect that in such a large old house).  
•	The house is a good half-hour walk to the downtown.
•	The breakfast was NOT included in the room price – but I knew that.  We stayed in Ireland for two weeks.  The English breakfast (which I did not try) and the omelet (which I did try) were the most expensive we found in Ireland, and the omelet was second-least satisfying.  It was not bad; but, it was nothing special.
Neutral:
•	Our suite on the top floor was actually split on 3 levels.  The kitchen and bath were down a few steps; the Jacuzzi room (with flat-screen TV) was half a level up – over the kitchen and bath.
•	The restaurant recommendations were good in that the food was excellent and the directions perfect.  Roly’s had great food, but the service was unbelievably bad.
•	The staff were always helpful and treated us with courtesy.  What was missing was the warmth we felt in most other hotels and B&Bs in Ireland.",3,2012,06,12
222,Enjoyable stay in a very nice quiet location,"We had a very spacious room which included a small sauna and a jacuzzi bath. The staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful. They served complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and cold drinks (With packets of biscuits) all day either in your room or in the lovely lounge. There is also tea and coffee making facilities in your room. The continental breakfast was adequate for myself and my friends, although the full Irish breakfast looked very nice it cost 12 Euro's which we all felt was expensive. The hotel is in a quiet location, a 15/20 minute walk into the city of Dublin. We ate at the School house restaurant just up the road and the food was excellent. We would also recommend The Church, The Arlington hotel for the dinner and show (the one by the river) and the Seine cafe. Also look out for vouchers for 10% off prices and free coffees etc.",4,2012,06,11
222,Fantastic hotel and great staff,"Just got back from staying at the Roxford Lodge.  Room was great with usual ammenities such as hair dryer, tea and coffe making facilities etc.  Room also had sauna and jaqcuzzi bath facilities.  Room was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable.

Breakfast was a choice of full Irish or continental (veggie options available).  I had the full irish with white toast and bread and butter.  There was a lso a choice of croissants, cereals, fresh fruit and yogurts etc .  Tea and coffee with freshly squeezed juices available.  There was also a choice of newspapers to read.  

The staff were friendly, helpful and attentive giving advice on buese, trams and taxi's etc with estimated fares etc.

All in all a fantastic hotel in a great area for walking and transport (bus stop opposite into Dublin) and a great price for hotel £75 per night and £12.00 for the breakfast which set me up for the day.  Thank you for a great break and I will definately be staying again!!!",5,2012,06,09
222,Great place to stay.,"Our stay was fantastic.  The room was large and included a sauna, tea, comfortable beds and a sliding door that opened.  The breakfast was a pleasure to go to in the morning and got us off to a good start in for our day of touring.  There was secure parking included, and the hotel was in a good location for walking.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  I have already recommended it as a great place to stay in my travel blog.  If I every return to Dublin, I would stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel again.",5,2012,06,08
222,Great Stay,We arrived after a long flight to be met by our hosts. Room configuration was different with ensuite (containing spa) on slightly higher level to bedroom and a small sauna in the bedroom. Breakfast was sumptuous and the city was only a short walk away. Will definitely look to stay here again.,5,2012,06,08
222,Great venue. Great service,"We arrived early for our stay at Roxford. Unfortunately we could not get into our room however we very well catered for with hot cups of tea, generous morning tea, great hospitality and advice on what to do. The hotel is well placed so that the energetic can walk into town (about 20 mins but very flat) or the less inclined can take a bus from across the road. Taxis in Dublin are also aplenty and reasonablly priced compared to Australia anyway. The rooms were very good. Ours had the jacuzzi and a small sauna (yes a sauna). Breakfasts were excellent with very good variety. A highly recommended venue.
",5,2012,06,07
222,Fabulous Hotel in Dublin,My family and I stayed here had two rooms. Both were spacious and had great amenities. (There was a whirlpool tub in each room!) The owner was helpful and would do anything to make your stay comfortable. Breakfast variety was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.,5,2012,06,04
222,"Ideal, slightly out of town hotel","Very nice hotel, room retained some of the features of the original house while being very upto date. This is also true of the very pleasent lounge which is a lovely place to enjoy complimentry tea/coffee as/when requested. While it is a little way out of town (& therefore quieter than some close to town would be)  there are places to eat a short walk away in the local area.",5,2012,05,31
222,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for a total of three nights during our trip to Ireland and were very pleased with the hotel. It's small, charming and provides everything you need. The rooms were clean and adequate on space. The breakfast was delicious. Although we didn't have a car during our stay here, they do provide secured off-street parking. One word of caution to travelers - this is a small hotel with a very limited number of rooms, so if you arrive before check-in time, your room probably won't be ready. There's no bar at the hotel, but you can order drinks and have them in the ""lounge/reception"" area (also small) or have them delivered to your room. The location is not exactly in the middle of everything, but easy walking distance to Merrion Square. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here.",5,2012,05,30
222,Friendly small hotel in great location,"Small family run guest house, the layout inside it quirky with a labyrinth of small corridors, and odd angles in the rooms. Stayed in an economy room, had all mod cons and comfy bed, but a wee bit pokey - fine for one night. The breakfast is great value at 6 euro for continental. Overall the location and the friendly and helpful staff are what make this place stand out - would return",4,2012,05,28
222,Great hotel and location,"We had only one night to spend in Dublin and wanted to have off street parking, in a quiet safe area with upscale rooms but not in a chain hotel. Roxford Lodge was perfect. The clerk at the front desk could not have been more helpful and accommodating. She recommended great places to eat in the area.... The big bathtubs and the comfortable king size beds were a real treat!",5,2012,05,22
222,Great Hotel,"Our last two nights in Ireland were spent at the Roxford Lodge Hotel, and it was a perfect ending to our trip. It was early in the day when we arrived and our room not quite ready. Desi helpfully told us where to go for the tour bus. It was a short walk to catch it and is an even shorter walk for the air coach to the airport, so the hotel is very conveniently located. We even walked the next day from the General Post Office area to the hotel. 
    Our well appointed room overlooked the shady street of lovely Georgian homes. The breakfast was excellent and ample, and Agnes and Desi both gracious. Tea was always offered in the sitting room as well as being available in our room.
    Desi was helpful in recommending our dinner options.
    We highly recommend the Roxford Lodge Hotel for a Dublin stay.",5,2012,05,22
222,Girlies Night away,"Stayed for one night, excellent hotel.  Welcomed by receptionist.  Our room was 118 and was for me, my sister and my 18 year old daughter.  Room was spacious, spotless had a sauna and jacuzzi bath.  Tea and coffee provided in room.  Radio, television and several latest dvds to watch.  Secure parking at the back of hotel.  Dublin centre easily reached via bus right outside hotel number 4 or number 7 will bring you there and its appears to be a frequent service.  It is also handy to the dart.  Check out is noon which is great.  We didn't have breakfast so cannot comment.  We shopped in Dublin until 7 pm so great to get round Dublin without hassle of parking etc.  Thoroughly recommmend this hotel and can't wait until we return.  The lounge beside the reception was lovely inviting had free wi-fi and open fire, with our gorgeous spring weather this was gorgeous xx",5,2012,05,18
222,Great hospitality,"Charming little hotel in a lovely, beautifully refurbished Georgian townhouse about 20 mins walk from Grafton Street, with a local bus stop right outside. Staff very friendly and welcoming, good breakfast. Our room, 105, with one double bed and one single, was on the small side for a family room, but it was cleverly laid out so that both beds were in their own nooks providing a degree of privacy - they had even their own TVs. Beds were comfortable, with good quality linen, and also the bathroom was modern and clean. Highly recommended!",5,2012,05,13
222,Excellent hotel,"This hotel lives up to its reviews. It is charming, well run, in an excellent location and somewhere I would return and recommend to family and friends.",5,2012,05,10
222,Nice Hotel,"Staff was pleasant, furnishings plush, but our room was extremely small.  There were several mysteries in the room (like working the heater, 1/2 shower door, the hanging table over the bed & a big fax machine taking up the little space there was).  The sauna was nice & became our heater.  Breakfast excellent.  We did not choose to stay here on our way back into town.",3,2012,05,08
222,Jacuzzi Tub!,"This hotel is a good find!  The rooms, although a little small, were very cozy and the bed comfy.  I think my husband enjoyed the jacuzzi tub most, espeically after a long day of walking around Dublin.  This hotel is a great place to stay, but be prepared for the 20 min walk to the city center.  I enjoyed the walk, especially after a big dinner!  The breakfast wasn't too special, but tasty and everyone was friendly.",4,2012,05,01
222,Must stay here!,"We were in Dublin for 3 nights and stayed at the Roxford Lodge.  We stayed in a triple room and had no complaints at all.  The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the city center and is a straight shot.  It is in a great neighborhood and we felt safe walking there at night after listening to music in the pubs.  There is also a bus stop right across the street, we took the bus once.  We were welcomed with tea and shortbread, which was really nice. The service is great, there is free wifi, and breakfast is tasty and affordable.  If I ever go to Dublin again, I would stay here for sure. We started off in London, went to Edinburgh, and then to Dublin... this was our favorite place to stay.",5,2012,04,25
222,Perfect stay - home away from home,"We stayed for 2 nights and my father stayed for 3 and we couldnt have asked for better location, service and value. Agnus greeted us when we arrived at midnight with hot tea and met our every need - a service she continued to provide during our entire stay. Des was also wonderful in helping us make our plans, give us dinner recommendations and ensured we were looked after. Hot tea and coffee available any time, any day compliamentary is a lovely touch aftr a day of sight seeing. Parking was very convienent. Rooms spacious and all you - could ever want. Breakfast - delightful and excellent value. We ate full breakfasts before we went out everyday and it kept us going much for the day! Would definitely go back - thank you!",5,2012,04,22
222,Excellent hotel with top notch service,"Just stayed over one night at this hotel and enjoyed EVERY moment. The service was top notch, the amenities were great (FREE coffee, FREE parking, Sauna etc.). I actually had to book my next trip after as soon as i came back home. This was our 3rd Wedding Anniversary so the hotel also offered us free welcoming drinks.",5,2012,04,22
222,a jem of a hotel,lovely hotel staff and breakfast excellent will be back,5,2012,04,16
222,Awesome hotel,Stayed 2 nights with husband and teenage son. Loved this hotel. Staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. Breakfast was superb ! Would highly recommend!,5,2012,04,05
222,Friday Night Before St. Paddy's Day,"The Roxford Lodge Hotel is excellent. Front-desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, the wireless internet worked well, and the in-room sauna and jacuzzi tub were terrific (most rooms have these). It's about a 20-25 minute walk to the Temple Bar area of Dublin, but there's a bus stop close to the hotel as well. Though the number is limited, there are a few restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance of the hotel. I did not eat the hotel breakfast, so I can't comment on that. Overall, an excellent stay, with excellent service, and I would definitely stay here again in the future.",5,2012,04,04
222,Okay.. I loved it...,"First the cons:
- you are 10 minute Dublin walk (15-20 minute US walk) from the city center.  by no means horrible, you can catch a bus if you like.  my husband and i enjoyed the morning (sometimes late morning) walks/strolls into the city center.  by afternoon/evening we were pooped and took a bus back.. sometimes we waited 10 - 15 minutes for a city bus.  Not the end of the world.. you could take a taxi.  we got the freedom pass which let us use the hop on and hop off bus and city bus and the air linc (for the airport) for 3 days- 28 euro.. totally worth it.
- sometimes the toilet didnt flush/ or had trouble flushing.  may have been user.. might have gotten fixed.. we didnt complain.

Pros-
- Our room had a sauna (we didnt use it) and a jacuzzie tub (we did use it) great.
- Fridge 
- a blow dryer (nice touch)
-desk
- hot water to make some coffee in the room.. they would also bring you tea or coffee to the room if you went to the lobby.  this was great.. they even brought some cookies and biscits - which was nice because we had skipped lunch.
-we had a balcony, enough room to have tea on the balcony if you choose or a smoke.  no chairs.. but you can take the chair from the room.
- room size was smaller than the us.. but I think that is normal here
- small table enough to have tea on.
- fax machine (didnt try it)
- phones, didnt work.. but didnt ask
- closet
- a door seperating hallway from your bedroom (nice for noise control)
-bed- comfy.. no weird comforter
-breakfast.. now this is important: you have a choice of full irish, a couple of omletts, french toast; coffee, tea, various juices (3-4); milk, cereal, toast, irish bread, bacon, sausage, cheese, cereal, porrige, fresh fruite (good stuff, strawberries, grapes, berries), bananas. eggs fried, scrambled, boiled.   they are generous, if you want more ask.
the staff- very nice, helpful.  you need anything ask.  
-tv and dvd player and movies; about 20 or so movies are in your room.  very nice to just 
kick back and take a break.
-lounge area with fireplace room- this area has a pc with intenet and printer.  you can hang there it is lovely.  i suggest a tea or coffee there if you want to get out your room.

you wont regret staying here.  if i am in dublin again... i will be here.. amazing value for the price. we were here for 4 nights.  did not hear a peep from the neighbors.  the hotel staff even let us come down for breakfast early on our last night because we needed to make an early start!!! a plus.",5,2012,04,02
222,Perfect,"The roxford lodge was the cherry on the top our 3 day trip to Dublin.
Staff were brilliant, always happy to help.
Every time we walked through the door we were offered a cup of tea or coffee (which was free)
staff were very helpful in recommending the best things to do and see in Dublin.
The rooms were clean and designed brilliantly, lots of space for clothes and the jacuzzi bath was used by my girlfriend before we went out which she loved.
The sauna in the room was quite random but again we loved it, nice to step into before getting ready to go out.
Located in a lovely area just a 15 minuet walk to the city centre, or if your not keen on walking bus stops are just outside the door, but walking into the centre was great as your walking through a lovely part of Dublin.
I really can't find a fault with the roxford lodge.
The only negative was that we couldn't stay for longer.
And the very competitive price makes it even better.
I would and already have recommended it to family and friends.
I'll deffonitely be back.

222,Great Place,"We visit Dublin over Thanksgiving 2011 and stayed at this cute bed and breakfats. The place is so nice, clean, comfortable, breakfast was amazing and the service is excellent!!!. Hope to go back again soon",5,2012,03,29
222,Comfortable and accommodating,Very well priced small hotel. Comfortable beds. Our room came with a sauna/steam box in it - a lovely treat. The breakfast was simple and sufficient. It was easy to walk (15 minutes) or take a bus into Dublin. Fantastic pub right around the corner called Ryans Beggars Bush. There is parking. The staff was very nice.,5,2012,03,27
222,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for three nights in March 2012 to attend the rugby at the Aviva stadium and it was excellent.  The rooms were lovely and immaculately clean, the breakfasts were fantastic and the staff were extremely friendly.  The location of this hotel is great for visiting all of Dublin's great sights, and we will certainly use it again.",5,2012,03,19
222,Neat and Tidy,"Hotel staff was very friendly.    Rooms, while small, were clean with a comfortable bed (which is really all I care about).   The location is a short taxi (or bus) ride or an hour walk from the major for tourist attractions.  I sorta prefer that, as this helps make for a quiet night's sleep.     One of the airport buses has a stop just a three minute walk from the hotel, and actually dropped off right at the hotel.    Would stay again if I re-visit this lovely, friendly city.",5,2012,03,17
222,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights in March 2012. Hotel is in a lovely Georgian part of the city and convenient for local bars and restaurants. A 10/15 minute walk to Trinity College. Staff were very welcoming (coffee provided on arrival and on request throughout our stay), breakfast was excellent. Room (105) was very well equipped but a little cramped, largely because the sauna cubicle took up so much space and light. Recommend Roly's Bistro for evening meals and taking a Geen Bus open top bus tour of the city.",4,2012,03,17
222,Charming,"Excellent hotel  in terms of ambience and location.Very good value for money, would definitely reccommend it!",4,2012,03,15
222,Great value,"Overall it is excellent value for Dublin but a little out of the action, although there is a bus at the door, including the airport bus.  Very clean and well maintained rooms,  and if they did away with the sauna it would make for a better room.  Very strange having this big box of a sauna in the room.  Had every intention of using it but with only 3 days to check out Dublin we had no time! Service great and have no complaints.",4,2012,03,15
222,Great Hotel for a Rugby Weekend,"We were in Dublin for the Ireland Vs Scotland Rugby. This hotel is really close to the AVIVA Stadium and the City Centre is a short walk away. The Hotel is on the Route for the Airport Bus and there is a stop very nearby. Nice walks along the nearby Canal and lots of pubs and restaurants nearby.

The room was small but had just been refurbished and was lovely.

We will definatley use it again.",4,2012,03,13
222,had a great experience!,"Great stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel.  Will definitely stay here again.  A bit out of the city centre, but easy 10 minute bus ride, which picks up right outside the hotel.  A++",5,2012,03,08
222,"Lovely, Welcoming Hotel","Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights while going to watch the rugby. Perfect location for the Aviva Stadium! Very friendly and welcoming hotel. Room was very cosy and beds comfortable. Bathroom was slightly on the small side. Lovely touch and very much appreciated to be offered complimentary tea,coffee and biscuits each time we came back in to the hotel. Breakfast also very good and an excellent choice.
Highly recommend the hotel :)",5,2012,02,29
222,Wonderful Hospitality,"We just spent six days in Adare, Ireland on a Groupon.  We added a night in Dublin both at the start and at the end of the trip.   Both nights were spent at the Roxford.

You couldn't ask for a more hospitable innkeepers than Desmond and his family.  Whatever you needed Desmond would handle.  The rooms were very nice and the breakfast was wonderful.  

Our Groupon included a car and the Roxford was perfect with it's secure parking behind the building.  

The only thing I can come up with that is the least bit negative is the location.  It's a little bit far from Temple Bar and town centre.  It's definitely within walking distance (we walked it both days), just a little farther than I would like.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",4,2012,02,28
222,Pleasant stay,"Easy to arrive from airport as Aircoach stop is near the hotel. You just have to walk straight on about 200 meters. Staff is great, probably most friendliest and helpful we have ever seen. Our triple room was clean, it had two tv´s, jacuzzi and infrared sauna. We also had shared patio with two other ""zero floor"" rooms. Only negative issue in our room was limited storage space (and problems with wc but hotel is in an old building so these things happens). Full Irish breakfast was tasty and it kept hunger away several hours. 

We had a very pleasant stay. Every evening it was a pleasure to go back to hotel after long day sightseeing and have a quiet night in a comfy bed :)",4,2012,02,25
222,Fantastic accommodation and location a stone's throw from Grafton Street,A really lovely boutique hotel in Ballsbridge. Great for the Aviva stadium or O2 and only a 15 minute walk into Grafton Street. The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is outstanding!,5,2012,02,14
222,Excellent Place to Stay - Would stay again,"We stayed in the Economy Double room for the weekend (Friday 10th February until Monday 13th February).

The room was a little on the small side, but more than sufficient for our needs.

The hotel and rooms were very well maintained and kept very clean.

All members of staff that we came into contact with were extremely helpful and would go out of their way to help us.

We were recommended to 'Roly's Bistro' for an evening meal, and this was one of our favourite places to eat.  The food there was excellent in a relaxed atmosphere.  The staff at Roxford Lodge pointed out that it is better to go into the Cafe rather than the Restaurant - The food is identical but is cheaper in price.

We were shown to our room on check-in.

The breakfast was excellent - We tried both the Continental and the full irish - Excellent quality and quantity.  Plenty of selection in regards to Cereals, and the orange juice was freshly squeezed - you could really tell.

One of the bulbs in our room had gone but we pointed this out to the staff, and on our return to the hotel it has been promptly replaced.  Excellent service.

Free internet access (Wifi) is available in the room, which we made use of.  We also wanted to print out our boarding passes for a return flight and were shown to a computer in the lounge where we could access the internet and print off our passes.

There is a bus stop directly outside the hotel for coming back in from the city centre, and across the road is the stop to go to the city centre.  Extremely handy.  On the way back from the city centre it is the stop just after the Old School House.

All staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  We will definitely consider staying here again on our next visit to Dublin.

(Roxford Lodge Hotel - If you are reading this - Thank you very much for your hospitality)",5,2012,02,13
222,What a gem!!,"I stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for a short business trip to Dublin. The hotel had been booked by my company and I did not know what to expect. I checked in at circa 10:00pm after a busy day and was met by a very pleasent receptionist who showed me to my room. What a room! Incredibly comfortable and  spacious with an infrared sauna and whirlpool bath! The receptionist returned shortly afterwards with a tray of fresh coffe and biscuits.

I settled in for the night and after a sauna to get rid of the days stress i watched one of the DVDs in my room before a very restful nights sleep. 

The service continued in the morning with a great breakfast and a very pleasent and attentive waitress.  On departure I was asked if I enjoyed my stay and the answer was 'wonderful'! 

With a centre of Dublin location and near the Aviva stadium I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure. What a gem I will most definatley be going back.",5,2012,02,06
222,Worth its price,"The place is small, but quite nice. The price is very good, but the breakfast is a bit overpriced if you don't eat much. The staff are very nice! On the downside, the reception is closed from midnight to 7am.",4,2012,02,04
222,Very nice place and can't beat the price for Dublin,"We stayed here for 2 nights before meeting our tour group in Dublin. We wanted a place to get adjusted to the time change and see some sights. The price was great for somewhere in Dublin. 

The hotel is a bit of a distance from the city center. There is a bus which will take you to downtown but it can be a wait for it to arrive. We only took it once and walked the rest of the time we stayed there.

The room was a bit on the small side but like I said we were only staying for 2 nights. We barely had room to put our luggage. The desk was small but had enough place for our computer and to charge the rest of our electronics.

The hotel staff were very nice, providing us with tea and snacks when we arrived and also willing to give suggestions for dinner which were within walking distance. 

If I only had a day in Dublin, I'd want to be somewhere closer to the center of the city. But for our needs, it was absolutely perfect.",4,2012,02,03
222,very comfortable & great location,"situated in a leafy street just outside the city precint & buses, virtually, on the door step we have again picked another gem.
Rooms were very cosy, bath tub was a welcome surprise for the wife. service whilst non obtrusive, was always willingly offered & welcomingly recieved.
stayed here for several nights & would readily stay here again when returning to Ireland",5,2012,02,01
222,"Excellent hotel, wonderful staff","We stayed here for 2 nights and it was such a welcoming, warm and friendly place. It was a good 15 minutes stroll into Dublin, but easily accessible for public transport, and the airport shuttle stopped just a couple of hundred yards away.  The room was spotless, and the small sauna in the corner of the room was a terrific idea. Will most certainly return to The Roxford if we are back in Dublin.",5,2012,01,30
222,Great choice!,My wife and I stayed here for a couple nights in October of 2010 during a trip to Dublin.  It was a great little place and lived up to the reviews on tripadvisor.  It has a pretty good location and it is easy enough to get around the city from this spot.  We will be back!,5,2012,01,28
222,Excellent stay,"The room was gorgeous and the service 5 star
It is wonderful to be in my home town  enjoying the Irish hospitality.
Thank you very much",5,2012,01,26
222,Great B & B In Dublin,"Just returned from a 4 day stay at The Roxford Lodge and can honestly say it was excellent.The rooms are immaculate with everything you need for a great time ie Very friendly staff , fab full Irish breakfast well worth 12e,excellent rooms (we had a double) with jacuzzi bath,sauna,dvds,flat screen tv,firm bed and a very quiet location out of the centre.If i had a negative about the hotel room it would be that there is a very small wardrobe, and the room may have been better if the sauna was replaced with a large wardrobe( we did not use the sauna, too busy drinking and eating).The hotel was very easy to find if you go by Aircoach from the airport and get off at the Schoolhouse Hotel (approx 250m along road).The walk  into the Temple bar area from the hotel takes about 20  mins and is one straight road, or catch the bus from the stops directly outside the hotel but beware you need the exact fare as the drivers dont give change, you get a receipt for the change, to be cashed at the office in the city.I bought bus passes (freedom tickets for 72 hrs) at the tourist info on Suffolk street for 26 e each which also included the hop on hop off tour(green bus) for the full three days and the local dublin bus services.This ticket also gave a trip on the Airlink bus to the airport but this runs from the centre of Dublin whereas the Aircoach was closer to the Roxford lodge.Price of a pint approx 5e, Guinness cheaper at 4.5 e but the pints in Temple bar are the most expensive.Great food at O'Neills pub on Suffolk street try the JDaniels  toasted sandwich for 7e you wont be disappointed or the great carvery served all day.Lots of pubs do carveries( its not like the English one where the customer puts it on) the server puts the whole meal on while you pick the items youd like from the vast array.Another place worth a visit is The Bank on Dame st around the corner from o'neills which does beautiful food-try the sharing platter for 2 for 17e absolutely gorgeous,prawns,chicken fillets,cocktail sausages,garlic mushrooms,samosas, veggie parcels yum yum.Overall really nice people and loads of choice for food and drink at competitive prices. Loved it",5,2012,01,25
222,Superb small hotel - a real gem.,"Stayed for 3 nights with two friends in a family room. 2 singles and a double were great as we normally end up with one of us on a campbed. The room was spotless, had a good sized bathroom with a jacuzzi bath and our very own mini sauna in the room which looked like a tardis! Big flat screen tv too plus free wifi. 

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the breakfast was great (although we only made it down in time once due to the Guinness!) and the whole ambience of the place was perfect. 

Transfer from Dublin airport was easy - the aircoach stops very close by and was only 30/45 minutes. We walked each day into the centre of town as it was only 15 minutes to the top end Grafton Street. There are a few cafes and pubs only 5 minutes walk away though if you want to stay local and there are a few buses that would take you into town if you didn't fancy the walk. There are also plenty of taxis around.

All in all a great long weekend in a fantastic, vibrant city and Roxford Lodge was a great find. Will certainly return.",5,2012,01,21
222,Fantastic Experience!,"I stayed here for three days with a friend and we were blown away by the service and amenities. The staff were unbelievably helpful, always willing to recommend local restaurants, transport options and sights to see, directing us on a map exactly how we should go. All of their recommendations were great! Breakfast was delicious, even the smaller continental kept us full all day. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and inviting; they had our bags waiting for us in our room after we had checked in early and personally showed us our room and explained all of the amenities. When we came to pick up our bags before heading to the airport, they offered us tea and coffee. The room was lovely, a standard twin included a queen bed and a twin, an iPod dock, fridge, tea kettle, entrance into the garden area, jacuzzi tub, and private sauna and was spotlessly clean! With the friendliness of the staff, this hotel had all of the amenities of a big 5-star hotel with the warm local feeling of a B&B. My friend and I are students and the price was just right! I really cannot think of a single reason not to stay at this hotel!",5,2012,01,14
222,As advertised,We selected this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews and it was as advertised.  It was very nice and very affordable.,5,2012,01,05
222,"A very nice hotel with a ""B&B"" feel to it.",We stayed here in the last leg of our ireland trip and it was very nice.  The rooms are very well furnished and everyone is more than willing to assist with whatever you may need.  I would most definitely recommend.,5,2012,01,04
222,Best room! Great price! Good memories!,"Best room! Great price! Good memories! We stayed at Roxford Lodge in January 2012. There was a very friendly atmosphere, big beautiful double room, great bathroom and sauna, free car park, 2 plasma TVs and aromatic shower gels, shampoo and lotion... Best romantic hotel break for a great price!:) And a very delicious irish breakfast...",5,2012,01,03
222,Warm and inviting,"Loved this inn. We had 2 rooms and both were beautiful. The staff was very kind and welcoming. Breakfast was delicious. 

The inn is convenient as the airport bus and other busses stop out front. We walked to Chrisst's Church from here as well.",5,2012,01,03
222,Great place to stay in Dublin,"I was looking for somewhere central but atmospheric to stay in Dublin with my husband, toddler and mother-in-law. My family are Austrian, so I wanted somewhere with a little bit of personality. I certainly got it at the Roxford Lodge! The building is beautiful and the rooms are very well-appointed, though not huge. There is an infrared ""sauna"" in each room and the baths all have jacuzzi functions in them. More than I expected for the excellent price! The breakfast was good and the service was very friendly and low-key (typcially irish). The corridors are slanty and full of nooks and crannies, so if you like big, modern, open plan, this is not for you. Likewise, there is no late bar or other such services, although the drawing room is lovely to sit in. The parking is very useful for such a central location. Will definitely stay again.",5,2012,01,02
222,Room was nice,"We got there at check-in time, but the room was not ready until a few hours later.  We were a little dissapointed at this as we had just traveled from Belfast and needed a rest.  
The beauty of the room made up for the wait time.  It was beautifully decorated, clean and big with wonderful lighting.  Only issues were that there was a leak coming from somewhere in the bathroom - We thought the cleaner missed a spot or something, but when we'd dry it up it would refill again a few hours later.  We notified the front desk of this.  They didn't seem too concerned.
We were surprised to see a nice selection of DVD's and a DVD player provided.  We ended up throwing one in when there was nothing on TV to watch.  The TV was nice too, a flat-screen.
The beds were comfortable and we got a good nights sleep.
We were going to grab our continental breakfast around 7:30AM, but the diningroom was small and full.  We needed to head to the airport, so we just skipped it and left.
Overall, the service was friendly.  The elevator was not working at one point and a cleaning lady went above and beyond and helped us with our bags.
Parking was secure and free.
I'd say the room was impressive enough to outweigh the issues we had.  I probably would try another hotel though if we ever visited Dublin again.",4,2011,12,30
222,A little gem!,"I first stayed at Roxford Lodge in June 2011, whilst I was in Dublin on business, exibiting at an event at the RDS. Location wise it was ideal, just a short walk from the RDS, it's also conveniently located for the Aviva stadium, although admittedly not quite so ideal for the traditional tourist haunts like Temple Bar. Anyway, I booked a single room, but on arrival was infomed that I had been upgraded to a double. The receptionist was very welcoming, and led me to my room, which was very spacious and even came equipped with a sauna! It was clean and comfortable and had free wifi. A good nights sleep was followed by a hearty Irish breakfast and more incredibly friendly service from the waitress, who could not do enough. All in all I could not have hoped for a better start to my trip.

I then returned to the hotel a second time in October. No free upgrade this time, but the room was still adequately spacious, still had my own private sauna, and this time also a jacuzzi bath, whilst the service and the breakfast were again tip top. With a bit more free time on this trip I managed to see a bit more of the immediate neighbourhood and discovered Upper Baggot Street where there is a variety of decent restauants and bars.

For the price, Roxford Lodge is ideal for anyone working at the RDS, or indeed anyone who enjoys staying somewhere a little quieter than central Dublin.",5,2011,12,22
222,Very good stay apart from some issues,"We had a very comfortable and relaxing stay at Roxford Lodge. We had our own sauna and jacuzzi bath, which we made full use of! The hotel is about 15 minutes walk to town.

We did, however have a couple of issues. Firstly, the fire alarm was set off by someone having a shower at 2am. The alarm went off for at least 15 minutes, and although it was not the fault of the staff, they could have at least apologised to the guests who left the hotel thinking there was a fire, and were kept awake.

If you're booking through booking.com be careful as you have not paid for the hotel in advance, you will need to pay on departure, and breakfast is not included.

Overall a really pleasant and leisurely stay.",4,2011,12,20
222,Wonderful stay,"Went for a long weekend in Dublin, and I have mainly chosen the Roxford lodge based on reviews and reasonable room prices. We could check in early to a warm welcome by the male receptionist. The room was of a good size, spotlessly clean and featured a little sauna and a jacuzzi bath. The room looked out to the back of the hotel and we found it perfectly quiet. Not having done a lot of research beforehand, we found the receptionist to be extremely helpful on recommending what to see in Dublin. We had a great sleep in the very comfy beds, the linen were fresh and crisp. It was nice to find a dvd player with a selection of films in the room - something for every taste. 

Nothing was too much for the hosts, always frendly and offering complimentary tea/coffee at all times. on our last morning we had breakfast which would be the only point where I would raise constructive criticism. My partner ordered the platter of ham and cheeses, unfortunately this was a bit of a disappointment. What came to the table was 3 slices of one sort of ham and 3 slices of cheddar with a bit of tomato on the side. Although there are 2 more cheeses at the buffet, this continental platter does not make a big impression.

However we were very happy with our short stay and should we go back to Dublin we will know where to stay. I will also without a doubt recommend this to friends.",5,2011,12,18
222,great hotel,"stayed here with my husband as part of our anniversary celebrations, we had such a great time the staff were so friendly and the food was really good, great weekend. The rooms were so nice really comfy and although we had some noisy neighbours the problem was quickly resolved, thanks for a great time",5,2011,12,13
222,Quietest Hotel Ever!,"My husband and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for five nights on our first trip to Ireland in May 2011. We stayed in the large Suite, facing out over the back of the property.  It was spread out over three levels, so not suitable for anyone that struggles with stairs.  The room had more amenities than we could imagine uses for including a bar, sauna, kitchen, cupboards and closets, large soaker tub, separate office/sitting room/extra bedroom/porch, and oddly a great many light switches, lights, and plugs.  

The four-poster bed was incredibly comfortable, and we needed it with all the walking and sightseeing we did!  The best part was the absolute SILENCE in the room throughout our stay.  It was blissfully quiet, and by far the best sleep I had the whole trip.  We thought at one point we must be the only people staying in the hotel, because we didn't hear anyone else coming and going.  It wasn't until breakfast one morning that we saw evidence of other guests.

The decor is amusingly dated, but everything was extremely clean.  

So why four stars instead of five?  Well, just a few minor hiccups, and really not anything too serious.  The suite comes with a kitchen, but it isn't stocked with the typical basic utensils and kitchen gear, including washing up stuff.  This made for several awkward and annoying calls to the front desk.  The first was to find out where to find everything, only to be told that everything had to be brought up.  I had to quickly think of what I would want to use, tell the girl, and then she brought those things to the room.  It was a little bizarre. On one hand, I just wanted to be able to use the kitchen, and on the other I didn't want to have to put anyone out to do so.  We purposely booked this room because of the kitchen as my husband has dietary restrictions and we like to eat some meals in while on holiday, but they didn't make it very easy for us to do so.  SUGGESTION FOR THE HOTEL:  stock your kitchen with the basics.

The other minor thing was that the toilet in the room ran for about 10 minutes after every flush.  Not the end of the world, but distracting.  We were told that's how Irish toilets work.  OK.  When in Ireland, let the toilet run.

We got around by walking, cab, and bus.  The lovely thing is the Roxford has a bus stop right outside the door.  This made travel in and out of the centre of town much easier.  We were a little surprised to find that transit prices differ depending on where you get on the bus and where you get off, but once we figured that out, we were off to the races.  Oh, and we loved how everyone thanked the bus driver as they exited the bus.  Lovely!!

We did take advantage of the computer in the room, used the sauna (heavenly), and the large jacuzzi tub and all worked great.  No complaints at all.

All in all, a pleasant stay.  We would definitely return.",4,2011,12,11
222,Nice accommodating staff,"I booked one night at the Roxford. It is a small hotel where a couple of old Georgian houses were combined. The rooms are small but very clean and  all amenities are available. The bathroom had a small jaccuzzi, and the bathroom itself was spacious enough. The double bed was very comfortable, and there was a desk and for some reason one of those personal sauna's in the room? 

The staff though are really nice and very accommodating they are what made the hugest difference to the stay. I needed to checkout late which wasn't a problem and they were very accommodating about changing dates of stay. 

The area is really quiet and there is car parking as well as wifi available. The hotel is a walking distance from the aviva stadium and grand canal dock, but you can't really walk to Grafton street (about 40 min walk), you need a car or you can take a bus.",4,2011,12,10
222,excellent value - convenient location,"This B & B is very good value, with a bus stop located immediately outside and is only minutes from Dublin city. The rooms and premises are spotlessly clean with excellent bathroom facilities and the breakfast is excellent.  Tea and coffee is available throughout the day on request.  My only negative comment is that the rooms have a sauna built in which really is not needed and uses valuable space in the room.
Parking is available on site accessable via a back street

Highly reccommend and would book again.",4,2011,12,09
222,Good for the price,"Good Location for the RDS or Lansdowne Road and the Bus into town is just €1.20. There's a Car Park round the back. 

The rooms all have an InfraRed Sauna and a Whirl-pool bath which can be relaxing and if you have a laptop with you - free Wi-Fi

Rooms were very clean and there was a fridge and a safe and it even had a lift. 

I much prefer these small hotels to the big impersonal ones. The receptionist in the evenings was efficient and helpful, the one in the mornings was too and very friendly as well.

The famous Rolly's Restaurant was about 10 mins walk away 

Breakfast was as good as any I've had.  I took fresh fruit (Blueberrys, strawberrys and grapes) with a fruit yogurt, followed by a full Irish - with lots of Tea and toast etc. My lady wife had French Toast with bacon and maple syrup!

Come to think of it apart from the actual scale of the building this was just like a 4* hotel, without the cost!",4,2011,12,02
222,Fancy but super small room,"There was plenty of free parking, and there is free wifi.

Our room had a luxurious, large bath, and also a 1 person sauna. However, there was literally 1 foot of space between the bed and the wall on 2 sides. For couples who love each other, this is no problem sliding past one another (including on your way in the door), but if you are sharing and like your personal space, be wary! For us, it was no big deal, but...we are newlyweds. ;)

Although there was a table and a single chair, there isn't really space to lounge except on the bed.

For us, we were staying here just for sleeping, and we were out and about from waking until bed time, so this was a perfect hotel. They are walking distance from a variety of restaurants. The street and neighborhood is very nice, in fact, the US embassy is just a 5 minute walk!

The room was spotlessly clean, and the teapot, television, sauna and plumbing all operated as expected. Our sleep was not disturbed at any time during our 2 night stay.",5,2011,12,01
222,"""Hot water, great water pressure and a warming rack for towels:-)""","For whatever reason, I appreciate hot water and good water pressure at a hotel.  I did not expect this in Ireland, but was pleasantly surprised with the Roxford Lodge.  As icing for my cake, there was a warming rack for towels; such a treat after a cold day.
The breakfast was good, the room was very comfortable and very clean.  I am guessing sauna's in every room are a European thing...? I did not use the sauna or jacuzzi.  
The staff were welcoming and offered tea every time you returned.  I said yes once and they delivered it to my room on a lovely tray with 'biscuits.'  This is such a nice touch.
I also appreciated separate faucets: a 'drinking' faucet and 'sewage' faucets.  That makes me wonder about all of the other places I stay...
The room has a huge, flat-screen tv.  In addition, the lounge has a computer if you did not bring your own.  
My only negative is that the internet was a little slow and the plumbing was noisy.  However, plumbing seems to be an issue throughout the country.  I am still giving the lodge 5 stars.
I took the aircoach bus which was very convenient and reasonable at 8 euros each way.  I did not want to rent a car while in Dublin.  When I started out for the rest of the country, I went back to the airport and picked a car up (much cheaper as well).
I will definitely be back.  This time I came solo.  I know they have triple rooms now so next time I will stay with friends.",5,2011,11,30
222,Great hotel for our 3 nights stay in Dublin!,"We were for 3 days in Dublin beg of November. We chose through Tripadvisor Roxford Lodge and we're happy for that. Great hospitality thanks to Katherine and the lady in the breakfast room, large room with a king size bed, flat TV screen, CD player, fax machine, fast wi-fi and also sauna jacuzzi facilities. Located in Ballsbridge, a very nice area 15-20 min walk from downtown Dublin. The most impressive elements were breakfast and hospitality. Breakfast, especially Irish one were cooked on time and well prepared. Katherine in concierge was extremely helpfull and arranged for us an excellent, unforgotten one day tour to Wicklow, while she gave us all infomation we asked her with regards to the city.
One of the greatest value for money experiences we've ever had!!!",5,2011,11,30
222,Friendly and Welcoming,"I totally loved this hotel.  It was booked based on a great price and great reviews here on Tripadvisor and I was not disappointed.  I was in 111, a room for one person and while the room wasn't big, it was totally cozy.  The tub had jacuzzi jets but I didn't have time to use them.  The staff was so very friendly, always offering tea or coffee when I showed up, and whether there was anything they could do to help.  Didn't get a chance to try the breakfast but will next time!  The Aircoach stop is down the road, in front of the Schoolhouse hotel.  When you get out of the airport to the buses into town, go to the Aircoach stop and if they don't recognize Roxford Lodge (the person selling tix hadn't) just say Schoolhouse Hotel and it's around 250 metres down the street after the traffic lights.  From the Roxford, it takes around 25 mins to walk to Grafton, although there's a bus stop RIGHT in front of the hotel if you don't feel like walking",5,2011,11,23
222,Words can't describe how wonderful this place is..can't wait to come back!,"Never  having been to Dublin before I took the advice of trip advisor reviews and chose the Roxford Lodge as our accommodations for six nights.  We were not disappointed!  Our stay could not have been more enjoyable.  Miss Agnes and her staff made us feel as if we were family staying in her private home.  We arrived early morning and were told it would be a few hours before our room would be ready but we were offered a tray of tea/coffee and cookies in the parlor. 
We reserved a twin bedded room which was a nice size.  The room had a sitting area and a small balcony.  
We didn't choose the the breakfast plan as there were several mornings we were gone before breakfast was served. (730a - 1030a) However one morning when the staff found out we needed to be gone by 745 they told us to come down at 715a and they would be happy to make sure we were fed.  
The staff was so friendly and went above and beyond anything we have ever experienced before.  
The walk in to city center takes about 20 to 25 minutes.",5,2011,11,20
222,CHARMING & WELCOMING.,"My  wide and I just stayed there for one night recently but I can say the bedroom is one of the most comfortable we have had the pleasure to stay in. The bed is great, there's sauna, jacuzzi, sound system, DVD player (and a collection of movies for you to choose)... There's also tea and coffee in the room. We also had a welcoming afternoon tea prepared for us by the owner/manager, just perfect after a weary day. There is secure off street parking, and great restaurants nearby, about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. My wife has told me that this hotel was one of my most inspiring choices of hotels I have ever made.",5,2011,11,18
222,Convenient stay,Very comfortable hotel with everything needed. Only down side was that my room wasn't ready on arrival (though I was an early arrival so perhaps that was wishful thinking!). I also missed not having a bath - our room had a wet room but obviously can't comment as to whether this applies to all rooms. Staff friendly and helpful- free tea and coffee with a generous supply of biscuits always available! A pleasant walk into the city centre and in what seemed to be an affluent area. Really convenient for the airport bus. The room even had its own cabin sauna which I found a little odd. We didn't have breakfast here so can't comment on that but it smelt great!,4,2011,11,15
222,Great Find,"Booked a last minute hotel for a match at the nearby Aviva, ended up in the lap of luxury. The hotel is a re-fitted redbrick house. The rooms are excellent, clean, well appointed with all the mod cons. It looks to be owner managed which explains the free wifi, in room DVD secection and wonderful breakfast. Had stayed in one of the larger chain hotels just earlier that week, this place was better by a mile. Wholeheartly recommend it.",5,2011,11,14
222,We were enfolded in a gracious Irish welcome,"Lo, two weary travellers arrived at the Roxford Lodge Hotel after a 9-hour trans-Atlantic flight.  Desmond greeted us with great charm, invited us to go to bed and rest while he handled some issues for us with the car rental company.  The room, though small, had a deluxe bed, and even its own sauna.  The appointments in the room were all of the highest quality.  Suitably refreshed after our siesta, we ventured forth to explore the dining possibilities in the area, of which there are many.  Next morning, the hotel served an excellent cooked breakfast, guests were invited to choose what they wished to have cooked to order.  We were reluctant to leave but we had family in other parts of Ireland to which we were headed.  We fully intend to return to the Roxford Lodge for a more leisurely stay.  Thank you Desmond!",5,2011,11,09
222,First rate.,"Stayed for two nights, made to feel really welcome from the moment we arrived, was well worth paying that little bit extra.",5,2011,11,08
222,Will stay again!,"The Roxford was a great cozy hotel located about 10-15 min (walk) outside of the city center.  Everything was updated and modern.  Most rooms had a sauna, which was a huge bonus!",4,2011,11,07
222,Perfect small hotel,"If you, like me, are not looking to stay in a large, modern hotel but rather someplace where you can have a more personal, local experience - look no further.  About 5-10 min (bus) or 15- 20 min (very pleasant) walk to city center, this small hotel sits in an area of Georgian townhouses in an upscale area of south (below river LIffey) Dublin.  Room was spotless, included a sauna and a jacuzzi, and in our case, doors out to a private patio.  Desk staff extraordinarily helpful and pleasant (offering tea/coffee & cookies every time you enter...either in their beautiful lounge or in your room), including directions, and restaurant suggestions.  Full Irish breakfast included, which was fabulous and fueled you for a day of walking and sightseeing.  Linens, water pressure, TV, services - all were flawless.  Came here from a week in Tuscany, so the bar was high...but they surpassed expectations!  Thank you.",5,2011,11,06
222,Todo election,Great hotel and they have a great location in te city. A small and confortable hotel. Asap i Will come back!,5,2011,11,05
222,Amazing hotel,"I just stayed there for one night but I can say the bedroom is one of the most comfortable I ever been in my like. The bed is great, there's sauna, jacuzzi, sound system, DVD player (and a collection of movies for you to choose)... There's also tea and coffee in the room... Just great!",5,2011,11,04
222,Loved it,Great hotel with great amenities. Also great value for the rate. Centrally located without being too close to the hustle and bustle. Would come back.,4,2011,11,04
222,Fantastic small hotel near city centre,"A small wonderfully cosy hotel near the southern city centre of Dublin. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast with all you can possibly ask for. 
The rooms are a little on the small side, but absolutely clean and comfortable. They include a private infra-red sauna and jacuzzi-bath. 
The city centre is a pleasant stroll away which is great considering that buses tend to run on their own schedule in Dublin. 
Highly recommended!",5,2011,11,04
222,Excellent service and great location,"Most welcoming arrival by helpful male member of staff, met us at rear door from secure car park, and assisted with cases to room. Showed us around the room, and how to operate jacuzzi and sauna, Free wi fi within the hotel a bonus,well positioned modern
 tv and dvd with films in room. Nicely laid out even though we didnt need the additional 2 single beds in the room. Offered a tray of tea and biscuits on arrival which we took in the lounge. Assisted us by providing a map of Dublin to help us get our bearing and information about local transport, and the ideal bus stop outside the hotel, but the City centre is only 15 mins walk so a good location.
When we returned from shopping we were offered another tray of tea and biscuits in the room, which was brought to us. This was a very nice gesture after a long day.
The room itself was a good size. The room and it's bathroom was capable of accommodating wheelchair users. It was very clean, with good bedlinen & towels& toiletries, & well stocked tea & coffee. 
We had continental breakfast which included freshly made porridge and all the cereals, yoghurts ham, cheese & fresh juices. The full irish looked delicious - we only declined because we had been eating the full irish at other hotels durng the week & fancied a change. We certainly were not disappointed with the continental option. The service at breakfast was friendly and attentive, though it was very busy and everyone seemed to be down for breakfast at the same time that morning.
The only very slight negative was that the bathroom fan in the room seemed to stay on for a long time after using the bathroom. It may have been because the bathroom door wouldn't quite close properly, but we couldn't resolve it & if we were staying longer than one night we would have mentioned it to the staff.
The following day we were advised that our ferry home was 9 hours later than planned & the hotel staff kindly allowed us to leave the car & luggage in the secure car park. Then on our return we were offered the use of the hotel lounge to recover from  our day of sightseeing before our journey home.
The exceptional level of attentive, friendly customer service makes this hotel very highly recommended by us & we would definitely return if visiting Dublin again",5,2011,10,31
222,Excellent value for the lone traveller,"Good location- very near city centre and 10 minutes walk to Merion Square. I travelled alone for an exam.
Aircoach from Dublin airport stops 2 mins walk away saving cash on taxis.
Good deli cafes, restaurants  (must try Junior's, ideal for a quick really tasty lunch amongst the office workers.)and small supermarket nearby.
Nice choice of DVDs in room, comfortable bed and spacious bath. Safe and fridge in room. 
Only thing there was a motion sensor light near the doorway that comes on when I went to the loo which was annoying.
Would definitely recommend.",4,2011,10,27
222,Great value and warm & helpful owners and staff,"We very much enjoyed the relaxing time we spent at the Roxford Lodge before Christmas last year. 

It is located in an area where I used to live in Dublin, just around the corner fron Lower Baggot street where there are many pubs and places to eat. You can easily walk to Stephens green from here or just jump on the bus that passes on the street outside. 

We had just arrived from France with lots of luggage, wine & christmas presents so the secure parking was appreciated. This is very necessary in Dublin if you plan to leave anything at all in your car and would like it to still be there when you come back. 

The room we had was split over two levels with the bathroom up a short flight of stairs. The Jacuzzi bath was nice to have, we do not like hotels that only give you a shower. 

The bedroom was comfortable with nice linen and there was a library of DVDs to watch on the huge flat screen TV, a nice way to spend a lazy morning after a long drive. 

The owner who comes from the west of Ireland was super friendly and cooked the hearty Irish breakfast to our liking and offering extra's & lots of more tea and coffee, just like home. 

We were in Dublin for the coldest weather ever recorded and many houses and hotels were without water or limited water due to rationing (as people leave their taps to drip so that the pipes do not freeze and very quickly the reservoir goes dry). We did face a few problems with water when we first arrived but they were quickly resolved by the hotel owners and they let us use another room during the couple of hours until our bathroom hot water was fixed. 

In the evening it is very nice to sit with a cup of tea or a beer in front of the open fire in the lounge. 

In the past we used to always stay at the Clarence hotel, but in recently we found that it is no longer worth the high prices they charge for a hotel very much in need of a refurbishment and where you have to pay too much extra for basics like Wi-Fi, parking & breakfast. This year we plan to stay again at the Roxford whilst in Dublin to catch up with friends before Christmas.",5,2011,10,23
222,Excellent hotel with quality service.,Lovely hotel within 15 mins walk of Oscar Wilde's statue. Great room with a huge comfortable bed.  Secure parking and the brekkie smelt fab - shame we didn't have time to eat it!,4,2011,10,22
222,What hospitality is all about!,"A wonderful B&B with very comfortable accommodations,  a very friendly, helpful and hospitable staff, a great breakfast (loved the black pudding - worthwhile to taste for those who might not have ever tried it) and a very convenient location with a bus stop right in front.  Free wifi and a public computer + printer in the cozy lounge.
Also for for ""football"" lovers - within a few blocks of a fabulous stadium!  
Stay was arranged partly for business, partly for pleasure and worked very well for both!  Would go back any time!",5,2011,10,21
222,Pleasant Stay,"Great location.  Lovely room. Helpful staff.  Reasonably priced.  Only stayed one night, but wish we could have stayed longer.

An excellent home base for exploring Dublin.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2011,10,16
222,A gem close to the heart of Dublin,"What a great discovery! This hotel is one of those places you hope to stumble upon: a nice, friendly place that combines elegance, good location, at a reasonable price.
You are welcomed with complimentary tea or coffee, you get hassle-free wifi, and what is quite incredible is that you can have a jacuzzi and a sauna right inside your own room.
Only down sides I could see: rooms are quite small, and there might be a need for a better restaurant kitchen extractor.
Overall I was delighted by this discovery, and I highly recommend it for it's great overall value.",5,2011,10,12
222,little gem... Hotel and the staff,"I was going to Dublin for an interview and decided to stay the night before to prepare, it was in ballsbridge so I needed somewhere close by and I stumbled upon this little beauty I was expecting b&b style rooms and service but instead I got a fantastic room with a jacuzzi bath and spotless throughout, friendly helpful staff, a lovely breakfast and free parking!!! They even let me keep my car there while I went for the interview. Thanks for providing a stress free stay, I'll be back whenever I'm in Dublin! ",5,2011,10,11
222,Great little hotel close to all attractions,"Finding the hotel was a challenge... I read another review that said pick up your car on the way out of town and I would have to agree... Dublin is NOT easy to navigate. 
However, once here everyone was so nice and the hotel is lovely, on a quiet street & on the bus line. 10-15 minute walk to most attractions. Breakfast is not included but definitely worth the price for the full Irish breakfast. If you are gluten free this is the place for you! Had a couple of gluten free (no wheat or grains) options for breakfast for my Mom which was a very pleasant surprise for her.  The family room, one queen and two twin beds, was a good size, with jacuzzi tub.  We had a mishap with the toilet leaking & flooding the bathroom but this was fixed right away and had no additional issues with the room. Thanks for not charging for our ""water feature"" lol. 
Definitely will stay again.   ",5,2011,10,11
222,Great Stay,"Everyone at the Roxford were wonderful!
We were arriving from London via the train and ferry but due to adverse weather conditions our ferry was cancelled. We called the Roxford explained our situation to let it them know we wouldn't make it our first night. The gentleman on the phone was very sympathetic and said we wouldn't be charged. That was an unexpected but pleasant surprise!!

The room was delightful and available when we finally arrived at 7am the following morning.
Staff was helpful and kind!
I definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. In fact I hope I get the chance to!!!",5,2011,10,09
222,A good spot not far from attractions,"While the rooms were very small (claustrophobic was one term used) and the small amount of space crowded out by the totally pointless suana in the room, the other facilites were excellent.  A lovely lounge, a great breakfast, good parking off street and easy access to the city with buses right outside the front door, as well as free use of internet made it a very easy and convenient spot to stop.  Service at reception was a little 'cool'.  Close proximity (walking distance) to loads of good eateries.",4,2011,10,07
222,Great place to stay in Dublin.,"Roxford Lodge is a small hotel with modern facilities.  It is clean, well-run, in a great location and offers very good value for anyone visiting Dublin.  It is within walking distance to everything one would want to see in Dublin, but far enough from the really noisy bar strip.  The room rates do not include breakfast, but the ""Continental Breakfast"", complete with fresh fruit, yogurt, ham, cheese, cereals, bread and toast, and the best porridge we have ever had, is only 6Euros!!  We stayed at the Roxford when we first arrived in Ireland, and then again 7 days later when we returned from touring the countryside.  We received excellent service from everyone, the reception staff was friendly and helpful on both occasions, and the breakfast was consistently fresh and delicious.  We had requested spa rooms and they were clean, good-sized with a King bed, and a sauna.  The first one also had a jaccuzi tub, and the second one came with a very large ""walk-in"" shower.   When we first arrived, we had a sense of a bit of a warren as there are several hallways and corners, etc.  However, there is an elevator and a ramp making it accessible.  Our rooms were also equipped with a fridge, a fax machine, a fair-sized flat screen tv with a DVD player and several DVD movies.  The hotel also has its own off-street parking for those brave enough to have a car in Dublin. (Our advice is to only pick up your car rental when leaving the city if you intend to drive around the country.  The city is not an easy one to navigate through - and we have driven in several European capitals, including Paris!!)  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Roxford and definitely would stay again.",5,2011,10,01
222,A thoroughly enjoyable stay,"This hotel is very good! I stayed here with friends, and we all agreed. We chose the hotel because of its good reviews here on TripAdvisor, and we were not dissapointed. Modern and lots of cool details throughout the whole hotel. Service in reception flawless!",5,2011,09,26
222,Great little hotel near attractions,"At first, we had trouble deciding on where to stay in Dublin. We wanted to be near all of the attractions but found through trip advisor that the hotels in city center were way over priced or the noise level was so much that you could not get any sleep. It was a wonderful surprise to find out that we had made a good decision in picking the Roxford Lodge. Now this is a small hotel with a lobby the size of a walk-in closet but the staff is friendly and always willing to make sure your stay is wonderful (they even offered tea and cookies). The rooms (at least the one we had) was the size of a cruise ship cabin but was very quite with thick windows and a nice selection of DVD's to view with the included DVD player. What a great spot to pick-up the city bus as the small bus stop is right in front of the hotel and the air coach (Airport Bus) stops one block from the hotel. May sure to pre-purchase your air coach round trip tickets before you arrive and bring your confirmation e-mail as they will give you the return ticket (don't lose your ticket) at the airport before departing to city center (you will need to get off at the School House Hotel). It made it easy the day we departed as we walked 1/2 block to the air coach bus stop and walked right onto the bus (every 20 minutes) and boarded for the 40 minute trip to the airport. The hotel does not have AC but who needs it as Ireland is cool all year long. We walked 1/2 mile to all of the attractions through tree lined streets. If you should lose your passport, the American Embassey is almost next door. There is a beutiful park between the hotel and Trinity College. After eatting those large Irish meals, it was nice to walk off the pounds between City Center and the hotel. There is a small free car park behind the hotel and access to the front door is with a code for security. Above all, this is a really nice small hotel with a great staff that works hard to make your stay confortable.",5,2011,09,22
222,Compact and Charming,"This is a lovely spot, though a little off the beaten, which was fine with us!  It was a little challenging figuring out the bus system, as the walk to city centre was a little long for some in our group.  But we received a lot of help from the locals.  Our first day Dublin was a bit of a ghost town.  We found out later, it was the equivalent of the Super Bowl, with Dublin playing Kerry in the other ""football.""  The room was clean and lovely, the beds were very comfyand the staff was very helpful.  Being able to get tea brought to the room at any time is a wonderful luxury!",5,2011,09,19
222,"Excellent location, and love the jacuzzi & sauna in the room!","Beautiful converted townhouse in a fantastic location between RDS and city centre. We stayed for one night after I participated in the Dublin Marathon, and I tell you I REALLY loved the fact there was a jacuzzi bathtub in our room... not to speak of the sauna in our bedroom as well! Room was small but not cramped, bed quite comfortable, furniture of high quality & well presented, all extremely clean. The staff were very nice and couldn't be more helpful. Secure parking in at the back, and I was happy my car was ""locked in"" at night - didn't have to worry about it for a moment. Even better, it was good value! I will certainly be returning, and will recommend to my friends",5,2011,09,17
222,BEST HOTEL AT ANY PRICE !,"The best hotel I’ve ever stayed at for any price.   Converted Georgian town house on a leafy street.  Bus stop in front of hotel, airport bus stop a block away.  “Walking” distance from Trinity College / National Library / shopping streets but 5 minutes by bus.  Marvellous, helpful staff.  Practical shopping street and rental car agency a block away.  Ample parking behind the hotel.  Reasonable, convenient laundry service.  Amazing full Irish breakfast.  Complimentary tea/coffee any time.  My single room was small but so brilliantly laid out that it was a pleasure being in it.  Totally modern bathroom with Jacuzzi bathtub.   Bath tub was a bit slippery, and shower curtain too long.  115/220v bathroom plug for electric tooth brushes and razors.    Comfortable bed, quiet room kept immaculately clean.  Small fridge.  The complimentary wifi came on automatically and worked flawlessly.  FINALLY !!  I would love to stay here again.",5,2011,09,17
222,I would recommend this hotel to everyone!,"We stayed in the Roxford lodge for 4 nights in September 2011 and it was nearly the best hotel I've ever been to.
We had the executive suite, so I can't say anything about the regular rooms, but the suite was everything we hoped for and more. Our room (or you could call it an appartement) had: a fully equiped kitchen with microwave, electric cooktop, refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, washing machine (no pots and pans nor plates and cuttlery though), a satellite-tv, DVD-player, stereo, a bar with barstools and again a refrigerator, jacuzzi (with a second TV), large sauna, large sitting area, computer with printer and ofcourse internet access, small dining table, a big comfy bed for two (and a single bed in the sitting area), balcony with view over the carpark and gardens (no road), complementary bottle of wine and box of chocolates... The room was very silent, with no neighbouring rooms or street noise. The hotel staff was very friendly and flexibel: we had breakfast in the room every day (a great full Irish, but we could basically choose whatever we wanted) exactly on the time we ordered it, the staff searched a good Indian take-away for us, ordered the food we wanted and brought it to the room with plates, cuttlery and water. They helped us with bus timetables etcetera. 
The hotel is an easy 10minute walk from the city center and there is a bus stop in front, a railway-station (grand canal dock) in the vicinity. There's great dining facilities not too far away (the Shoolhouse pub or Rolly's bistro for instance). 

The only negative thing I can say about the Roxford (if I really have to say one thing), is that the room could use some ""refreshing"", but this is really only noticable in details;",5,2011,09,15
222,"Lovely stay, great service","Stephanie, Des, and all the folks at the hotel made sure we were taken care of even before we walked in the door.  I emailed asking if my 81-year old aunt could stay before check-in time, while we dropped our rental car at the airport.  They took care of her, served her tea & biscuits, and got her checked in by the time we returned.  Our luggage was already in our room as well.  Our room was small but very comfortable, and hi-tech.  Breakfasts were plentiful, great selection, cooked to order if we wanted.  My husband appreciated being able to ring to have a beer brought to the room.  He doesn't get that kind of service at home!  The lodge is convenient to the air coach stop, easy walking distance to near-by restaurants, as well as fairly convenient to city centre.  Highly recommended.",4,2011,09,14
222,Wonderful Return Visit,"We returned to Roxford Lodge with a group of 10.  The staff was very helpful and had everyone set up as promised with an excellent rate.  Laundry was available at a reasonable price and every special request we had was fulfilled.  Breakfast was always excellent and when we had questions about bus schedules, trains, taxis, etc, everyone was more than helpful. This is the only place I would prefer to stay at while in Dublin.",5,2011,09,14
222,Family Owned and Operated,"Not only was this hotel clean, comfortable, and convenient to Grafton Street, but it's also owned and operated by a family. They're incredibly accommodating and helpful, and taking a few extra minutes to sample their breakfast offerings is well worth your time. We stayed here on two separate occasions during our trip to Ireland: our first night and our last night. While our first room was somewhat small and cramped, the hotel is being remodeled, so the room on our last night was much roomier and luxurious.

All in all, it was a great experience, and if we find ourselves in Dublin again, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here.",4,2011,09,13
222,Great Dublin Hospitality,Conveniently located to most places to city center and tourist sights. This is a converted townhouse that's been expanded to a bed & breakfast. Rooms are cozy and clean. Delicious Irish breakfasts and excellent  service in the morning and throughout the day. They always ask if we want any beverages and they bring them out on a large serving tray and plenty of cookies.,4,2011,09,12
222,Lovely and convenient,"My girlfriend was doing a business trip. I was just tagging along. This lovely small hotel was professionally run by a family who took great efforts to make you comfortable. Our room was spotless and quiet. We had the continental breakfast on both mornings we were there, and were abosultely full. And, every time I turned around someone was either offering me, or delivering us, tea with a tray of biscuts.

I'm a walker, and the location was a perfect 15 minute stroll to most sites in downtown, and a short cab ride to other venues worth seeing. We also rented a car, and the off street parking out the back was a serious plus.

I also appreciate the sightseeing tips I received, as I had never been to Dublin before.

Would certainly return if my plans take me to Dublin.",4,2011,09,12
222,"Nice hotel, handy for Lansdowne Road/Aviva","I stayed here for one night as I was in Dublin for a football game at the Aviva. The hotel was of a good standard, the staff were very friendly and the location was good for the city centre and the stadium.

My room wasn't that large but as I was staying on my own it wasn't really an issue. The only problem was that the room was downstairs and the wifi didn't work in the room, I had to go out into the corridor to pick-up a signal.

Slightly strangely there was an in room sauna which was an interesting touch.",4,2011,09,10
222,Charming family feel to this hotel,"We (my parents, wife, and 10-month-old son) stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in late August.  I agree with the other reviewers on most of the positive details of the hotel, but I thought I could add a few things on the baby-friendliness of the hotel and it's surroundings.  

First, know that we liked it.  The staff especially stood out as feeling very professional and authentic.  Turns out the hotel is owned and run by a family for decades.  My only detraction was that the rooms are not air conditioned, and it was unusually warm for a couple of nights.  The hotel provided the travel cot for the baby, and he slept well.  Our bed was king-sized, and combined with the travel cot, sauna, and our large bags we were very snug, but it wasn't a problem.  

The restaurant had a highchair, and several breakfast foods that the baby could eat.  Just down the block is a great restaurant called The Chophouse that we ate at happily twice.  Almost next to the restaurant is a convenience store with a surprisingly large selection of organic baby-food.  The free car park at the hotel was also great for getting the baby in and out of his car-seat.

In all, we found the Roxford to be a nice transition from home to Dublin.  It felt more like we were staying with a rich relative than in a hotel!",5,2011,09,07
222,Two different rooms!,"I was fortunate enough to try two rooms at the hotel. First the executive suite and then a single. When I made the reservations on booking.com I could not get a double room for the two nights I needed. So instead I booked the available suite and then the available single. I must say both rooms were quite lovely. Of course the suite was huge with small kitchen area, bar, upstairs jacuzzi and a large steam room. There was also a separate area with computer work station (free internet access through out the hotel) and single bed. The suite also came with a bottle of wine and chocolates. The next night I moved to the single. Which in fact had a single bed. But it also had a jacuzzi bathtub and a small steam room. I agree with the previous review of the single that it would have been nice to have some extra room for my suitcase instead of the steam room......no wine and chocolates though!! All the rooms are nicely decorated with lots of tile work. Tea and coffee is offered in your room every evening. Breakfast is good. Bus stop right out front.",4,2011,09,07
222,One of the best stays we've ever experienced,"The service was excellent, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We booked an economy double room, which was just large enough to accommodate a couple. And we had a sauna and a jacuzzi! The room was very clean and so the hotel itself. The building is Victorian and is carefully maintained and beautifully decorated. The hotel is situated in a quiet neighborhood, so the nights were calm and we had a good rest. The breakfast was great and very tasty.
The only concern is the walking distance from the down town, however if a 20min walk is hard buses run just near the hotel. The advantages of the hotel's location are the proximity to the DART rail station and quiet nights. We used DART to go to Howth. Also just about 50m away on the same side a bus station to Dublin airport is located (""Aircoach""), so for 8 Euros each we got to the airport in about 45min. That was very comfortable, as we had quite a lot of luggage, but did not have to walk far from the hotel. 
Overall, we would recommend to stay in this hotel while visiting Dublin and we would like to thank Tripadvisor for helping us find it!",5,2011,09,05
222,overall good,"Stayed here in August for 2 nights. Lots of positive things: clean, good service, in a nice area just outside the centre with a bus stop in front. Free internet and printer in lounge. I was immediately offered a pot of tea when I arrived late evening. I would suggest to any solo traveller to book a double room. The single room I was in had a single size bed, not queen size as in most other (single room) places I stayed. It had the capsule sauna, but instead I would have preferred space to open my suitcase apart from on  the bed.  There was a cupboard to hang clothes. Lift to all floors.",4,2011,09,03
222,"Nice, Quiet Hotel on the Outskirts","We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for a few nights at the beginning of a road trip through Ireland. You can catch the Aircoach bus from the airport to less than two blocks from the hotel (“Schoolhouse Hotel” stop), which is convenient and was about a 40 minute ride. Once there, the front desk staff let us stow our bags at the hotel for the day when we arrived at 10AM or so. The staff is friendly (some individuals moreso than others), though do not expect the personal experience that you will at B&Bs because it is a hotel.

We booked and received the economy double which is smaller (as the name implies), does not have a sauna and leaves just enough room to walk around the bed, but again, this was perfectly fine for the small amount of time you will probably spend in the room since there is so much to see in the city! The bed was a comfortable double bed, not two twins pushed together as we encountered in some other places. The room was clean and bright, with wood floors and a large window looking onto the street. The bathroom is well-appointed, complete with a large shower/tub combo. The water pressure is a bit lacking, though this is certainly not unique to just this hotel in Ireland. Also, the hotel is very quiet for sleeping, as it is located in a nice neighborhood with the embassies, on the outskirts of the city. 

The only drawback of this hotel is that it is located on the outskirts and is a brisk 20 minute walk to the center of the tourist attractions in Dublin. During the day, it is really a nice walk. Just make sure you bring everything you need for the day (ie: layers!) with you when you leave in the morning, so you don’t have to make the trek back, though you can take the city bus to and from near the hotel pretty cheaply if need be. At night, however, this may mean spending some extra money on taxis if you plan to stay out at the pubs at night, though that just depends on how comfortable or familiar you are with Dublin. Something to consider, though I still think the hotel is a great deal  for the price and I would book here again.",4,2011,09,01
222,"Great hotel, staff and location!","Cosy, comfortable and clean with welcoming and charming staff and good breakfast selection.  We will return soon!",5,2011,08,12
222,Very pleasent people but a bit hard to find.,do not drive from the airport.  get a bus in and drive when leaving. public trans very good. but driving in dublin a nightmare.,5,2011,08,09
222,"Great hotel, great service",The hotel is nice and well-located (only 10-15 minutes walk from the city centre). Our room was a good size and had sauna and hot tub. The staff is friendly and always happy to help. And breakfasts are excellent. We stayed there 4 nights and would definitely recommend it! It's worth the price.,5,2011,08,07
222,Excellent Value and Service,"We stayed after a red eye from Canada and were very impressed with the service, food, and accommodations.  We stayed in the family room which included two single beds and a double.  The kids were also glad to go in the sauna as well!  We will be back in less than a week and we know it will be an excellent place to finish our tour of Ireland!",5,2011,08,03
222,Great Rates for Lovely Rooms,"This was our first trip to Ireland and the Roxford was the first of our Bed and Breakfasts experiences.  My husband and I both loved this place.  We were traveling with friends so we were given two rooms right next to each other in a part of the house that only had these two rooms so it was almost like our own little place.  The insuite bathrooms had a spa bathtub, and the room also had a dry heat sauna.  We used both and it was a wonderful way to relax after all the walking and siteseeing we had done each day.  
The hotel is situated in a very nice cozy neighborhood justly slightly away from downtown Dublin.  However, everything was within walking distance, and we only took a cab to the train station when we were leaving the city.
We opted not to have breakfast included, but we did eat at the hotel on two occasions.  The food is delicious with many options available.
If I were to be in Dublin again I would most likely stay here.",5,2011,07,31
222,What a find!  Great car park.,"In Dublin for four nights.  Wonderful bed in well fitted out room which would have been even better without the in-room sauna and the space saved available for storage.  Ensuite also well equipped.  Great Irish welcome with generous breakfast.  Best feature was the large secure car park at the rear, so left our car there all the time.  Frequent  buses (except on Sunday) from right outside and only 1.20 euro to the centre of the city which solved any parking or getting lost problems!",5,2011,07,30
222,Perfect!,"Stayed there for 3 nights - really good experience from start to finish! The receptionist was very friendly and helpful in giving us advice where to go out for having lunch etc. The hotel is not too far from the city centre, located in a quiet, nice area. 

What makes this hotel really worth staying? It's the really comfortable bed, good shower, refreshing jacuzzi bath, friendly welcome, check out at 12, complimentary parking, tidyness.",5,2011,07,30
222,"Clean, great breakfast and lovely decor. Loved it....","Roxford Lodge is super clean, has a carpark (very useful in Dublin) off the road, has great breakfasts and nice staff.  I travelled solo and stayed twice, once at the beginning of my Irish trip and then on the last day too.  The first time I was in an economy single but they upgraded me as they weren't busy, which was lovely.  I was in a room through the doors by reception which had a spa bath, a sauna, lovely linen and was very quiet.  All for less than 50 Euros - a real bargain.  The breakfast was great with the most creamy yoghurts I've ever had, lovely bread and a cooked breakfast if you want (I didn't). There was all sorts to choose from if I had wanted to eat lots.  The car park is gated and has automatic gates (very snazzy).  

On my return trip I was offered tea and biscuits on arrival, had booked an economy double as no singles were available and this too had a spa bath and sauna!  I was in room 122 at the top of the house which is quiet, again very clean and had a huge bed, leaving not a lot of room around it, but with free wireless internet too, I feel it's a very good place to stay.  Would definitely stay again!",5,2011,07,29
222,Great place to spend a night in Dublin,"We stayed at Roxford for one night in July 2011.  The place is an renovated Victorian house. The owners did a good job of preserving the original decor and modernizing the furnishings at the same time. The receptionist was very friendly and quite helpful in planning our only day in Dublin. The hotel is a bit of a walk from the City Centre (15-20 minutes), but the walk is pretty. The hotel also has complimentary parking which is hugely helpful for people doing a roadtrip vacation out of Dublin. 

The only issue I had with the hotel was somewhat questionable room design. We had two rooms and each had an UV sauna built in. Even though the idea is interesting, the saunas just don't fit into the old Victorian rooms and leave little space for movement. It's a minor flaw however and the one that some other people might find useful.",5,2011,07,24
222,Fantastic service!,"I spent the last four nights of a month-long trip at Roxford Lodge and it was a terrific place to rest and renew my energy. Roxford Lodge is in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin and it is a lovely neighborhood, just a 15-20 minute walk to the City Center. When I reserved my room, I opted to include the Irish Breakfast and that was a wise decision, because breakfast was amazing - fruit, several kinds of juice, brown bread, toast, coffee, bacon, sausage, and a fried egg. The free wireless internet at Roxford Lodge worked beautifully and the rooms are set up to serve the needs of business travelers with lots of electrical outlets. I arrived in Dublin after a 7 hour trip by train and ferry in the middle of a downpour and I was surprised and delighted to find out that I could have a tray of coffee or tea delivered to my room or the lovely lounge anytime I wanted it and believe me, I took advantage of that right away! Another great asset of Roxford Lodge is the easy transportation to and from the airport - there is a special airport coach that stops just a 2 minute walk away and it only costs 8 euros, much less expensive than a cab. Additionally, every person on staff that I encountered in the four nights I was there was friendly and willing to help me with anything I needed - I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there.",5,2011,07,22
222,Just OK,"We stayed in July 2011.  The hotel is okay, definitely not worth a 4.5* rating.  I booked this hotel for it's location but wonder if there was better.  I found the hotel like a rabbit warren - too many doors to get to your room.  The room was small and can't really understand  why a sauna is providedI There appeared to be too many things in the room and not enough space to walk around. I felt claustrophobic.  Perhaps other rooms were bigger.  The breakfast - we had a cereal and toast - was a bit pricey but I suppose for convenience it was OK.  The parking was secure.  The staff member when we arrived was a bit lack lustre, we didn't really feel comfortable.  Certainly within walking distance to city centre. It was adequate but probably wouldn't stay here again.  Good for the business traveller.",3,2011,07,19
222,"Great place, certainly recommend!","Myself & my Husband stayed here for a couple of nights & found it to be an excellent place to stay. We had a double room which had a lovely BIG comfortable bed, tv with a dvd player & a selection of dvds, 2 x telephones, fax machine, small table with 2 x chairs, dressing table/desk, a small sauna with built in radio, small balcony over looking the car park, a nice sized bathroom with a jacuzzi jet bath. Tea & coffee with biscuits was free through the day when required, breakfast was EXCELLENT, the full irish was lovely & there was so much choice of cereals, yogurts, fresh fruit, cheeses, toast, bread, orange juice, tea, coffee, water, etc! The staff were excellent too, very friendly & helpful, we were made to feel very welcome. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, not sure if there was any family rooms, but for couples it's defo recommendation. The only thing that I would say on the negative side, was that the walls were thin & you could hear next door, like coughing or moving about when it was quiet, but that's all. A big thank you again to everyone @ The Roxford Lodge, you made our trip a very special!!!",4,2011,07,18
222,Home from home,"This hotel is a fantastic place to stay when in Dublin. It is located in the upmarket embassy belt with lots of pubs, good restaurants nearby. It is also clse to the RDS, Aviva Stadium (landsdown road). The hotel is family run and the attention to detail shows.
The hotel does not really have a 'proper' bar, so is not a place to meet for a drink. But there are plenty of places nearby to do that. Good fast broadbnd is available which is great for business users.",5,2011,06,28
222,"A charming, tucked away retreat- exceptional !","This charming hotel is a gem tucked in the embassy area of Dublin among other gorgeous  historic brick homes.   The rooms are beautiful each with its own sauna and small fridge.  Lots of stained glass and character in the rooms and common areas.  This is a posh, smaller lodge- perfect in every way, quiet and peaceful but within easy walking distance of bustling downtown Dublin.  The staff is over the top delightful and the breakfast is the best in Ireland!  The staff who cooks your made-to-order breakfast are wonderful.  They came in early on our departure day to cook our breakfasts before we left.  I inquired about the wonderful porridge/oatmeal served and a delightful lady staff member offered me a entire package of it to take back to the US. (I couldn't accept as I feared my luggage would be overweight)  But that is the way they treat you here- more like their favorite family member over for a visit.  If you are looking for a quieter more relaxed area to stay but still want to be close to the city look no farther, this is it!  There is a wonderful restaurant and pub ""The School House"" nearby that cooks the best beef and Guinness pie.  It is to die for!  I cannot say enough wonderful things about Roxford Lodge and its staff!  I wish I could find accommodations of this quality and value everywhere I travel.",5,2011,06,23
222,Potentially a lovely hotel - but with problems,"My reason for choosing this hotel was due to the amazing reviews it has received; however I have to say in my honest opinion the hotel does not live up to the over the top reviews it has received.  Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t a bad hotel it just is not worth the outstanding reviews it has received.  

The plus points for me were; 
The customer service at the hotel is 1st class – there is nothing that is too much trouble
The hotel is exceptionally clean
Great  interior and design 
In a good location – just enough outside of the city to still make it a comfortable walk and a lovely area
Good value for money in a capital city that is quite expensive
Comfortable beds 

The minus points:
The bedrooms are incredibly small and are not helped by the fact that they have a sauna in them wish doesn’t help matters – we could not open the wardrobe door fully to look in the only full length mirror as it hit the end of the bed.
The shower pressure was virtually non existant – I didn’t feel any cleaner than before the shower! 
The cooked breakfasts are very disappointing – they cost 12Euros and this is 12 Euros for anything that is cooked not just the full Irish breakfast – I had 2 poached eggs on 1 toast and it cost 12 Euros!  You can get better value breakfasts in nearby restaurants and cafes.  The continental breakfast however is worth the 6 Euros.
The sauna in the room is just the strangest thing ever – I do not understand why it is there as they don’t work that well and take up so much room.
We could hear everything from the adjoining rooms; especially the bathroom fans and the cleaners walking up and down the stairs from 7.30am.

To sum our stay up; we paid for the double economy room through booking.com and it was good value for money with regards to the service and cleanliness but I would not have paid more than the 60Euros a room per night due to the minus points.  I probably wouldn’t stay here again – if the room was bigger and the noise elements were eradicated I probably would consider another stay.",3,2011,06,23
222,Lovely - Nicest staff I have ever encountered,"The staff alone is reason to come here. In all my years of travel, these people constituted the nicest hotel staff that I have ever come in contact with. They offer complimentary tea and coffee all day long to your door, even though there are already tea and instant coffee-making facilities in the room. The room and bathroom were spotless, and there was a lovely sauna in the room. The hotel is located an easy and pleasant 20-minute walk away from the city center, and within walking distance of many good pubs and restaurants. The full Irish breakfast was very tasty, and really filled you up for a day of sightseeing (though there were other substantial breakfast items available as well, such as french toast and omelets, in addition to the regular continental cereal and yogurt fare).

Very pleasant, budget-friendly stay, and we would gladly stay here again!",5,2011,06,22
222,"Charming room, helpful staff and Perfect location.",The room we stayed in was small but perfect for what we required.  Everyone was very helpful.  The cookies and tea/coffee when we arrived was a very nice touch.  It was just the right distance to downtown while being far enough that we could also see a few local pubs and places to eat.  We will definitely be back.,5,2011,06,14
222,Ok - but a few flaws...,"I stayed at the Roxford for 2 nights and was disappointed in the value for money. The claims about the sauna and jacuzzi are overstated. The jacuzzi is a basic bathtub with jets and the sauna is an infrared box that doesn't work well and just gets in the way in the room. The building and rooms are interesting and full of character. The service was very good and the breakfast (only had continental) was basic but fine. It cost 6 euros though. The cooked breakfast would have cost 12 euros; a rip off from what we observed other guests ordering. Cons: The toilet didn't flush consistently, the mattress was old and uncomfortable, we could hear other guests in the hallway (we had a family with loud children next door so we may simply have been unlucky).",3,2011,06,13
222,nice hotel for exploring Dublin,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, delicious Irish breakfast. The hotel is 15 min walking distance from Centre. If you need anything, just ask at the reception and they will help you. We stayed for 2 nights and we managed to see a lot of Dublin town, which is tourist- friendly. Also have great fun at Chris de Burgh (irish singer) concert at Grand Canal Theater.",4,2011,06,13
222,"Wonderful, wonderful hospitality","This is the 5th times I've stayed at the Roxford Lodge my Thanks to Agnes, Stephanie and Stephanie the hospitality is always superb.

A vreal famil hotel - you got not get a better welcome",5,2011,06,10
222,"Perfect Location, wonderful accommodation","Roxford Lodge was a fabulous place to stay. The friend I was going with booked it, having stayed here a number of times before. I was a bit sceptical as I wouldn't normally stay in a B+B- preferring the anonymity of a hotel. How wrong I was! This was better than almost any hotel I've ever stayed in.
We came up from Cork and it was extremely easy to find by car, and you don't have to navigate through the centre of the city. There's also free secure gated parking at the back which is a rarity in Dublin. 
The service is great- very friendly staff. We had a twin room, with the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. There was a sauna in the room, which was a great way to detox before bed and again in the morn. The room was a good size with a small balcony and a decent size bathroom, with a lovely rainwater style shower. There's also a big flat screen tv with a large number of channels and a dvd player. A selection of DVDs is also provided. 
We had a room only rate and so I can't comment on the breakfast- but next time I go I'll def stay for it- if the standard of the hotel is anything to go by the breakfast will be great. 
There's also a bus stop directly across the road that goes into O'Connell St and the dart is also nearby. We could see the Aviva from our balcony so I imagine it's very convenient for matches/gigs here. 
We also asked to see their executive suite which was incredible. You would never need to leave the hotel if you stayed in this. It comes complete with a kitchen, hot tub, sauna, bar, 4 poster bed and a large balcony. Would be great as a romantic treat!",5,2011,06,07
222,Great bed and breakfast! Extremely helpful and kind customer service! Would definitely return!,"The hotel itself is about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College, but the bus stop is literally directly in front of the hotel, and is easy to use to get to the center of town and back. Breakfast is delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful with any questions. The jacuzzi tub was a nice treat! The rooms are smaller, but definitely work just fine. We had a mini fridge in the room, which was very nice. No complaints. We would definitely stay here again!",4,2011,06,06
222,"Great location, nice area in Dublin.","This was a great place to stay. From the airport we took the airport bus and dart and were within a 10 minute walk to the hotel. The room was small but had everything we needed, including a comfortable bed, jacuzzi tub and sauna! 

The hotel was only a 10-15 minute walk from the main city centre where you could find everything including the stops for the hop-on-hop-off bus. This is a great way to see the city. 

The Roxford Lodge was clean and comfortable and we would difinitely stay here again. The staff was friendly and the free internet was very helpful. The only thing is we had booked breakfast ahead of time and didn't remember we did! It would have been nice to be reminded about this when we arrived because we didn't eat breakfast at all.",4,2011,06,04
222,Good value,"Roxford Lodge is in Ballsbridge, about a 15-20 minute easy walk to City Centre.  You are also one block away from the airport bus.  

When we arrived, I ran up the steps and rang in.  The hostess came out and directed us to a door on the ground floor (into the kitchen area) so we didn't have to lug our suitcases up the stairs.  Check-in was easy and we were in our room in a few minutes; coffee was delivered to our room in less than 10 minutes.

The room is a good size; but the sauna does take up space that crowds the table and chairs.  Our room door opened into a hallway, bathroom on the right and plenty of closet space for clothes and suitcases.  The bathroom is bright and feels new.   Also, we had a balcony that opened onto the car park.  Not a great view, but it was quiet and calm.

The neighborhood was fine; we walked everywhere and never felt uncomfortable.  It's a little out of the way, but the price was certainly worth it!    We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment.",4,2011,06,03
222,"Great Hotel, Very comfortbale with excellent service","Hotel was very comfortable with small but very clean, well appointed rooms. The service is excellent with all the staff ready to help out in any way possible. The breakfast is excellent and we looked forward to it each morning. 
Am easy 20 min walk into the city and temple bar which we enjoyed.
Highly recommend staying at Roxford.",5,2011,06,01
222,excellent large quiet guesthouse/hotel in leafy suburbs near town,"beautiful old victorian townhouse now run as small hotel/ luxury guesthouse on Nortumberland road, Dublin 4. just up the road 5 mins walk from US embassy, 10 mins walk to RDS and Aviva stadium. Very safe leafy suburban neifghbourhood. Bus stop right outside brings you into the city centre (4/5 stops) - Pearse St or O'Connell st. 
Safe walled car park in the rear, free but space for only about 10 cars. Very friendly desk staff, lovely breakfast, nice rooms with comfy beds, whirlpool bath and small sauna cabin (!). Could walk into town in about 20-30 mins via Leeson St, Merrion Square and Nassau St to Grafton St / Temple Bar / O'Connell  bridge. Safe walk by day, a taxi will cost 10 euro at night. Perfect for short stays, weekends etc. Not suitable for people who want to party all night at the bar, but ideal for quiet relaxed break. Very recommended.",5,2011,05,24
222,We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone!,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for 2 nights and had 2 rooms, a double and a triple. They were excellent. The quality of the beds, bedlinen, fixtures and fittlings was great. We all enjoyed the jacuzzi baths and mini saunas. The breakfasts were lovely and the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. We will hopefully be back very soon.",5,2011,05,18
222,Best service we have ever received....,"Stayed here for 2 nights over the Easter break and we really couldn't have asked for a better B&B whilst we enjoyed our first trip to Dublin.
The hotel reception were incredibly helpful upon arrival, taking our cases as we had arrived early, and additionally going out of their way to assist us with our sightseeing plans for the day ahead. 
We we went to our room, I was impressed on the size it, more like a mini suite than a room.  The bed was confortable and a good size, nice TV with a selection of DVD's, jacuzzi bath and sauna which came in handy after a day of exploring.  Nothing was too much for the staff and they frequently bought us free tea and coffee to our room whilst we were there.
The full Irish breakfast was wonderful, there was no pressure to eat fast as there are in other places, which meant we could eat whilst leisurely reading the paper and planning our day.
The B&B is about a 15 minute walk to the city centre, but this was actually a fantastic location as it meant that you got to see the different sides of Dublin.  The B&B is very well linked to public transport and the air coach stop is only up the road for transfers back to the airport.  all I would say is that the B&B did not appear to be well catered for the less able.  Although it had lifts installed, there are several steps to the front of the building which you need to use to access it.  
All in all we had a fantastic time in Dublin, and we would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to our friends.",4,2011,05,12
222,"Ok, nothing amazing though","Stayed here for one night during our trip to Dublin. Has a nice homely feel to it, but the rooms are shockingly small for the price and given its not in the middle of the city. Good bathroom with a big bath, and fun having a 1 person sauna in the room, but a bit unsual as it takes up so much space it is cramped trying to get around the room.Also walls a quite thin. Location is a 15-20min walk out of the city centre which is fine and good to get away. Free tea and coffee service is  nice touch.",3,2011,04,30
222,Perfect Start to our Irish honeymoon,"My husband and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for two nights at the start of our 10 day honeymoon trip to Ireland. The Roxford Lodge was the nicest of the B&Bs that we stayed in for our entire trip. We were greated by a friendly gentleman at the desk. We had arrived several hours before the regular check-in time, but only needed to wait 15-20 minutes for our room to be ready. While the room was quite small, it was tidy and clean. The bed was soft, and there were several luxuries that aren't typical in a B&B that were welcomed: a room safe, a nice sized table and chairs, a towel warmer in the bathroom, a generous HD TV and DVD player, and a small selection of DVDs to watch in the evening. Best of all, our room had a generously sized jacuzzi tub, which we gratefully enjoyed after a long day of touring Dublin.

We arrived for breakfast early, and were quickly served. We enjoyed the full hot Irish breakfast both days, however a small selection of continental items were also available, which included fruits, juices, cereal, yogurts, and cheeses. 

The hotel does show some small signs of wear. Some light maintenance would help it to appear more polished. In our bathroom for example, some of the grout could benefit from some bleach to remove mildew stains.

The hotel is a residential part of town, so it is quiet at night. It is 15-20 minute walk to the Grafton Street shopping area, or to a Hop On Hop Off bus tour. There is also a Dublin Bus stop right outside the front door, and an Aircoach bus stop to the airport just two blocks away. Pembroke Lane, just a few blocks away, also has a shopping area that includes some convenience stores, coffee shops and restaurants.

Overall, we had a pleasant stay at the Roxford Lodge, would stay there again, and would definitely recommend it to friends.",5,2011,04,22
222,"Had to wait an hour to get a table for breakfast, bad customer service","Stayed here for one night last weekend on the Friday.  Hotel itself is fine although a little shabby in places such as the lounge.  Room was nice, had a balcony which overlooked the car park at the back.  Room also had a jacuzzi and sauna, although we never got to use either.    Had been planning on using these in the morning after breakfast but didn't have time in the end.  Breakfast was very disappointing.  Went down at 9am on the Saturday morning.  As there were no free tables we were asked to wait in the lounge.  After 20 mins the receptionist came in to advise us that there was a free table now.  When we went down another couple had come in and taken the table.  Rather then the new couple being told they would have to wait for the next table, they were left have the table and we were told we have to go back to the lounge to wait again.  There isn't so much as a newspaper or a radio in the lounge or anything, never mind a tv.  So after being in the lounge for an hour we eventually got to go down and have breakfast.  Having worked in top hotels for many years myself, I don't think an hour wait for a table for breakfast in a small hotel is really acceptable.  There were only 5 tables in the breakfast room with 2 people at each.  It would've been nice if our orders had been taken in the lounge instead, and our food etc brought to us there.  Or even if they'd offered to bring our breakfast to the room we would've been delighted with that.  Staff apologised, but didn't seem to care really, didn't do anything to try and make up for this.",3,2011,04,20
222,"Efficient, well-run and very well-placed","This hotel is 20-25 minutes from the very centre of Dublin- a pleasant enough walk- but has a bus stop right outside and it's E1.20 to get to O'Connell Bridge. It's only 10 mins or so walk to Meriion Square. what we didn't realise when we booked it is that there are bars and restaurants only 5-10 mins walk away, e.g. a handily placed Milano, the Irish name for Pizza Express. There's plenty of parking round the back, too. Rooms were fairly spacious- even with the sauna about which so many others have written! No, we didn't use it. Breakfast was excellent- really good porridge, nice home-made bread etc. Dining room a bit small if you have a large party all going in at the same time maybe. Staff all seemed helpful and knowledgeable. Free internet accees in the lounge made it easy to check in for the flights home online. I would return here if visiting Dublin again",5,2011,04,18
222,Excellent Boutiuqe Hotel,"4 Night stay, the position of this Hotel is perfect, quite, just out of the centre, on a bus route. Breakfast was excellent, such a good choice,fresh orange juice!!! the service was execptional every time you came into the hotel you were offered tea or coffee and biscuits at no extra costs, The rooms were spotless clean this hotel is a credit to the family who own it.",5,2011,04,18
222,Nice Hotel with Great Amenities away from City Center,"I chose this hotel based on reviews and being recommended in Rick Steves' Ireland guide.  I thought being away from the city center over St. Paddy's would be helpful for noise control.  We stayed 3 nights as part of our 16 day trip.

Our flight came into Dublin at 6am.  By the time we got our rental car and drove to the hotel, we arrived around 8am.  We knew it would be too early to check in, so we parked the car in the gated lot behind the hotel, left our bags with the front desk and went off to explore.  They let us use the downstairs bathroom to freshen up before we left and told us to check back around 1:30pm.  

We didn't end up coming back to the room until about 5pm and our room (104) was ready and our bags were inside.  The room was a little on the smaller side, but plenty comfortable.  We had a double bed, desk and fax machine, bathroom with jetted tub and warming towel rack, a table and 2 chairs, flat screen TV mounted on the wall, and a sauna room.  We never tried out the sauna or tub.  There is a hair dryer in the room also.   And of course, we had a tea pot and tea fixings (all our rooms had tea).  There was also free wi-fi, which worked fine.  My husband was able to watch a basketball game online one evening.

We reserved our room without breakfast, but we did have breakfast at the hotel twice during our 3 nights.  The breakfast room was nice and bright with 5 or 6 tables.  The lady serving breakfast was always really nice and asking if you wanted this or that.  They definitely had the best OJ, fresh squeezed.  Since our rate didn't include breakfast, the charge was 12 Eu pp for a cooked breakfast (6 Eu for continental).  We got a full breakfast and cappuccino at the Bean Scene down the street for 7 Eu pp.  Both were comparable in taste.

The front desk was really helpful.  We'd asked for a recommendation on dinner and went to Roly's Bistro, which was very good although expensive.  They showed us the bus route to get to the city center, which we never took.  We walked the whole time.  It takes about 25 minutes to get to Trinity College.  We did end up taking a taxi once and it was 9 Eu from just a little north of O'Connell St.

The walls in the hotel are a little thin as they are most hotels.  I heard our neighbors next door come home once at 1am and couldn't get back to sleep.  I heard the neighbors above us taking baths late at night as their bum slid across the tub every so often.  You know that sound?  Part of the problem of being woken up so easily was that we were still adjusting to the time difference.  We are PST in the US.  There was also someone in the neighborhood that would leave their dog outside to bark for hours on end.

Overall, it was a nice hotel away from the city center.  If you aren't into walking a bit or taking public transportation, it might be a little too far away.  For someone going to Dublin for the first time, I would recommend looking for something closer to the city center.  It's always nice being city center when you are out sightseeing or having drinks and want to go to your room real quick.  But, I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",4,2011,04,16
222,great place in convenient location in Dublin4,"Very good hotel in Dublin 4, on the bus route, aircoach route and close to DART. Very spacious rooms, clean and cosy. Extremely good atmosphere and serrvice. 
Definitely a place to return.",5,2011,04,13
222,Wonderful Experience,"Really enjoy staying this hotel. Staffs are helpful, room is clean enough but their is a crevice on the toilet seat lid which is a little bit bothering. Tranquil neighborhood and comfort bed make high sleeping quality.",5,2011,04,10
222,Not bad but not amazing either,"This place is not a hotel but a B&B in a big town house. Its crammed and has a homely feel which is nice but then again not when you can hear all the knocks and bumps around and from above. The rooms are well kitted out (who uses faxes these days?!) and liked the stack of DVDs. The Jacuzzi is the bath with air pumps and the infra-red sauna is a weird time travel capsule machine which can't be good for the environment. The single bedroom is tiny...the toilet was bigger! And it really had a single bed - yes the sort of thing you fall out of in the middle of the night. 

I figure this hotel wins because its competitively priced and is full of gismos. You'll stay in better, you'll stay in worse. Its a safe bet if you want to watch the pennies.",3,2011,04,09
222,The high ratings are 100% justified,"Our stay here was simply perfect.  Location-wise it's ideal since it's far enough from downtown to be affordable, but walking to downtown would take only 15-20 minutes (the #7 bus also stops right outside, which will take you downtown).  The hotel is within short walking distance of pubs and restaurants (Baggot Lane has the most choices), as well as the train station.  

The staff were top-notch, genuinely friendly & welcoming and always offering tea/coffee whenever we came back from our day's activities.  They even arranged for a cab to pick us up on their last day.  The breakfasts are lovely and very generous--we had the Full Irish both mornings which kept us going past lunchtime.  Our room was also very charming, with plenty of power outlets (something that some hotels/B&Bs sorely lack) and even a jacuzzi bathtub.  I was a tad mystified by the need for a sauna right there in the room as it takes up a fair chunk of space, but I guess can see where it might be just the thing on cold and rainy days.  Oddly, it didn't rain a drop during our entire 10-day stay in Ireland!  

Two big bonuses:  free wifi (something we always look for when traveling) and laundry service.  It cost around 13 Euros to have two bags of laundry washed...we just dropped them off in the morning and they were ready by that evening.  Nice!

So in a nutshell we would definitely stay here again the next time we visit Dublin.  They're a class act and well worth a try.",5,2011,04,08
222,Sauna and jacuzzi in the room,"I stayed here at spring in 2010 and found it a very good accomodation. The building is situated in a nice and calm surrounding  and the bus stop is just at the entrance.
 
My room was very nice and clean, but very small, too. It was in the ground floor with one double bed, a writing table, a chair, TV and sauna. The bathroom was also small, but nice with a jacuzzi bathtub and complimentary shower gel, soap and shampoo. The window offered a view to the garden.

The staff was very nice and helpful. Each day on arrival I was offered a complimentary tray of tea and biscuits. The rooms are cleaned on a daily basis. I asked for breakfast which was quite good as well, and such a big portion that it was enough until late afternoon.",4,2011,04,05
222,"Fantastic stay, service given to perfection, must stay!","This hotel is one of the best in Dublin and an absolute joy to stay in. We stayed for 4 nights in the executive suite which was amazing. We could easily have made it our home. 

On the first day we were offered drinks and room service was excellent with a phone in every room in the suite. We were offered to have the room cleaned everyday.  Since we were mainly staying indoors during our 4 nights, we enjoyed the rooms to the max. The rooms were delightfully peaceful and quiet. Me and my friend enjoyed the sauna and jacuzzi together everyday. TV and music in the jacuzzi and bedroom were top quality. 

We had a minor problem with the jacuzzi which was immediately sorted out without questions. This is the only minor glitch we had, which wasnt even a hassle since it was all sorted out professionally and very quickly. I wouldnt even consider this a downside since the staff were extremely kind and generous. 

The executive suite has a kitchen which i would recommend to use since it has cooker, oven, microwave, dishwasher, washing machine all packed together for a pleasant cooking experience. 

Everyroom has subtle features which make it stand out such as the colourful lighting, intimate atmosphere and beautiful decor. The beds are amazingly comfortable and moving around the suite is always pleasant and peaceful.

Anyone planning to stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel should also consider relaxing in the guest room next to the reception. This is a delightful room to enjoy a good conversation and relax.

This is a must stay hotel of you are going to Dublin.",5,2011,04,02
222,"On the whole, it is ok","My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights.

The staff are extremely friendly, approachable and helpful. On one occassion, after we had asked a question about directions from a staff member, he came running down the street after us to check on a minor detail which could have made the information he gave us incorrect-really outstanding.

The hotel is in an excellent location, only a short walk from Aviva stadium and surrounding pubs and eateries. It is a comfortable, flat 15 minute walk from the city centre. 
 
The hotel has a secure carpark which is easily accessed from the hotel. The hotel is fairly secure as well. 

It has a lot of character and the rooms reflect this. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfortably furnished. 

The rooms (well the one we were in anyway) were extremely small. In fact, I would say this is the smallest room I have ever stayed in (apart from a ship's cabin). There is furniture and cupboards to keep bags out of the way, but it was very difficult for two people to move around. The bed is a double. The room was stuffy and there was no airconditiong but we were able to open the window - a little chilly for March in Dublin but we survived. I would suggest if you do drive, leave what you can in the car and just take up to the room what you need. 

This was very expensive, though it was St Pat's week and the weekend of the Ireland V England rugby game. The breakfast was not included but it was generous, fresh and well prepared. 

I think if you are not staying here for long and need to be near the Aviva stadium and not too far out of the CBD, it is worth considering.",3,2011,03,30
222,"Really lovely stay in a clean, characterful hotel with amazing room facilities and plumbing that worked!","I stayed overnight whilst on business. The room was compact, but included both a sauna and jacuzzi bath. The staff were fuss-free and got me a complementary tray of tea and biscuits. It was a great welcome after a day at work. The hotel seems to have a warren of rooms that are full of good stuff and meant a great stay. I spent some time in the lounge which is very beautiful and full of sofas.
Great stuff thanks.",5,2011,03,23
222,Wonderful stay!,"My sister and I spent two nights at the Roxford Lodge Hotel. Quiet, lovely neighborhood. Short walk to City Centre . Bus stop right outside. The rooms are beautiful, clean with very comfortable beds. The breakfast was very good. Fresh fruits, cereals, breads or Irish breakfast. The owners could not have been nicer or more accommodating.  I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone that is planning a trip to Dublin.",5,2011,03,19
222,Wonderful Stay,"Roxford Lodge Hotel is a gem. My husband and I spent only one night and wish we had simply booked our entire stay with them. Charm, very comfortable room, great people. What more could you ask. We're going back on 26 and 27 March.",5,2011,03,15
222,"Lovely hotel, fabulous service and great breakfast","Roxford Lodge is a lovely hotel, minutes from local transport networks and also has free parking if you arrive by car. The service from staff, especially the two Stephanies at the front desk and the lady who served breakfast, was top class. The breakfast itself was fabulous, plenty of choice and nice food. The room was comfortable and, as a solo travller, a bonus was the large flat screen TV with DVD player and selection of films. A fine experience, good value for money.",5,2011,03,10
222,Perfect hotel,"My 2-night stay with my girlfriend at Roxford Lodge was brilliant! It made our holiday and was just perfect.

The staff could not do enough for you, from offering you tea and coffee even when walking in at midnight to just general politeness, the staff were unbelievably helpful. The minute we arrived we were offered a complimentary drink as it was my girlfriend's birthday, and when we left our bags were stored away allowing us to walk around town bag-free, from start to finish the staff were great.

We had a continental breakfast booked both mornings and the lady in charge of waiting on tables was lovely, always offering juice and if she could get anything for you, it just really allowed you to relax and enjoy the holiday.

The location is about a 15-minute walk from Dublin city centre, but this does mean that there is minimal noise and with the massive comfy beds getting to sleep was no problem. 

With a sauna and jacuzzi in the room we could not believe how much we had got for our money, and it was incredibly good value.

Overall, this was possibly the best hotel I have stayed in. The staff were incredible- every one of them from first to last allowing you to really relax- and the hotel was clean, the room a great size and the breakfast was very tasty. 100% recommend this hotel, and will definitely stay here again in the near future!",5,2011,02,27
222,Not what I had expected...,"I definitely use TripAdvisor before booking any hotels when I travel, and I was fairly confident with my choice when I picked the Roxford Lodge Hotel, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed.

I definitely have mixed feelings about staying at Roxford Lodge Hotel...one the one hand it was a nice looking hotel from the outside, however my room was quite small (which I could get over), and the jacuzzi for which I booked the room, did not work. 

It was too late in the evening to call the front desk. The young girl at the front desk that evening when I had checked it wasn't very friendly at all. She showed me to my room and was already walking towards the door to leave while she asked me if I had any questions. She wasn't particularly pleasant when I had called to ask if I could order a soda saying that they close the lounge at 11:30pm (it was 11:40pm at this point) which is fine but it didn't say anywhere on the paper that there was a close time to getting a soda. 

When I went to the front desk that evening as well, I needed change for the bus (I only had a 5 euro), she said that she couldn't give me any change and looked back down at her computer and ignored me even though I was still standing there. Perhaps the safe locks itself at a certain point in the evening, but I had no trouble in the morning getting change after paying for my accommodations the night before. 

The lady at the front desk in the morning was MUCH more helpful and very pleasant and I liked her very much. She helped me check out and mailed some items for me because she noticed my hands were full of suitcases and bags and I wouldn't be able to drop it in the mailbox. Overall, the location is ok, and the breakfast was lovely, but I don't know if I'd stay here again...it would be a toss up. 

Also, please note, that the directions on the website from heuston train station are incorrect. After getting off the DART at the station by Aviva Stadium, you need to go LEFT when you exit and not RIGHT. I had to walk several blocks with my luggage only to realize I was walking in the wrong direction. Perhaps including a bit of a map would help some.

I think first impressions are extremely important, and while I appreciated the amenities and free wi-fi, it was the young lady at the front desk the evening I checked in that really set the disappointing tone.",3,2011,02,22
222,Simply Excellent!,"I have stayed in this wonderful, family owned hotel for both business and pleasure.  Each time the greeting, service and room standard has been absolutely superb.  The rooms are a good size and have excellent facilities.  The staff cannot do enough for you, day or night and the position; a short walk from the City Centre, the DART and some fatastic local restaurants makes the Roxford Lodge an absolute gem!",5,2011,01,31
222,Great find in upscale neighborhood,"Found this hotel courtesy of Tripadvisor. I couldn't agree more with the glowing reviews given to the place.
The Roxford is a well-kept hotel in an upscale neighborhood close to downtown Dublin (airport travellers take note- Ballsbridge is not easily accessible from Dublin Airport, and those renting a car should have a strong spirit of adventure or at the very least a good GPS unit). 
The staff couldn't have been more accomodating, and were readily accessible for questions. 
Beautifully appointed rooms with sauna and jacuzzi. Parking available, and close to mass transit.",4,2011,01,29
222,I've stayed in five star hotels all over the world and The Roxford Lodge Hotel was better than them all.,Excellent staff. Beautiful hotel. Jacuzzi and sauna very romantic. Lovely restaurant down the road called The Chop House. Staff showed us how to use everything. Helped with luggage. Tea and coffee and biscuits when you arrive in. Five stars. 10/10,5,2011,01,29
222,Excelent Value and Cleanliness,"I cant find anything negative to say about the Roxford Hotel.  Three nights in Dublin in January 2011 before we went home to Australia. Bustop outside of door. Aircoach to Dublin airport 100 meters away.  Rooms excellent and very clean. Had a sauna in the room and enjoyed that everynight as well as Jacquzzi.  The breakfasts were to die for, not greasy well cooked and tasty. Fruit, cereal, porridge,full irish breakfast. The staff were very supportive. came in after a long day and were offered tea and buscuits in the lounge.  To me hotels are about a balance of comfort, good food and value, well this hotel wins hands down. we will return possibly next year. The girls will look after you here.
Thank you Steve and Joanna Sullivan",5,2011,01,27
222,Great little find!,"I stayed here last weekend as I am attending college in the IPA on Landsdowne Road - brilliant location for the college & a facility park the car there while at lectures which is some advantage!
Great hotel - so welcoming on arrival. My room was a double and was really comfortable and warm on a cold January night after a long drive. The lad that booked me in brought me a pot of tea and some biscuits just after I checked in which was greatly received (even though there is a kettle in the room) - all the amenities are there with a great shower & jacuzzi bath. There was even a sauna in my room!! I have booked a return stay already.",5,2011,01,24
222,"Wonderful Hotel, would highly recommend!","We stayed here for two nights. The staff were incredible and couldn't help us enough. Breakfast was well worth the money. The walk into town took about 15 minutes, which personally we really liked. Tea & coffee offered all day. The rooms were amazing TV, DVD player with a selection of DVD's supplied. The sauna was wonderful. As an added bonus we were upgraded to the executive suite for the second night which was out of this world.",5,2011,01,23
222,what a find!,"Having just visited Dublin and stayed at the Roxford Lodge we could not believed what a fantastic find it was.  From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were spotless, staff helpful and courteous, breakfast excellent.  We were bowled  over by the hospitatlity and service.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2011,01,12
222,Great alternative to chain hotels,"The hotel is a converted old Victorian house. It has a good bus service to the city centre and is a short walk from the DART station (local Dublin suburban train). There are no services as such like you'd find in a big hotel - restaurant, bar, leisure facilities - but the room was lovely (reasonable size, big TV, tea/coffee, clean and a decent size bathroom). The manager who welcomed us could not do enough for us when we arrived. All in all a great option when visiting Dublin. Also close to the international football stadium at Lansdowne Road.",5,2011,01,01
222,terrible hotel,"Internet not working on rooms, not hot water all the time. Randoms switch off electric power, fun on the WC never stop and some noise sounds in the rooms.

Can understand good reviews of this hotel, is absolutely really bad.",1,2010,12,30
222,Very enjoyable and affordable luxurious hotel,"I and my boyfriend were looking for a city break in Dublin and wanted to stay somewhere more unique and more like B&B. But what we found exceeded our all expectations! We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and had very good deal, was worth every penny! 
The hotel is really in a great location. First, it was very easy to get a transfer from/to air port (we took aircoach) - the bus stop is about 2-3 minutes walk from the hotel. The distance to the centre is also good as we could walk there, though it took us about 30-40 minutes, but we were not in a hurry anyway :-) Taxi cost us 10-12 euros. It is located near the canal, so nice place for a romantic walk. 
From the outside this hotel doesn't look as big as it really is. In the inside it looks nice, cozy and very luxurious but all done tasty (or depends on the taste). Our room had a big bed, which was very comfortable, a sauna (it works, but takes time to heat up) and a clean nice bathroom with bath where you could have a water massage. We had to ask one of the staff to show us how to use the heating control, as there is no air conditioning. However, as we were at the end of October it was ok and the room was nice and warm, but had to open the window for it to cool down for the night, so maybe air conditioner would help with that better. All in all the room had everything in it that a normal room should have. The views from our window were not the greatest (the inner yard, where you could park the car), but we chose the location not for it's views anyway.
All the staff was great and very helpful. We had bed and continental breakfast option, but one of the mornings we asked for warm breakfast and it was no trouble at all (had to pay extra, but we knew that). The food was really good quality and they always asked if we would like tea or coffee with biscuits even when we were in the lounge room, where you could enjoy sitting near fireplace or use PC with free interent. There is free wi-fi in the room as well.
All in all our experience with our city break has been excellent and this hotel had played a big role in it.  We will definitely stay there again and already recommended it for our friends.",5,2010,12,29
222,Fantastic hospitality,"Being back in Europe for business, I as I often do, take my left behind girlfriend for a weekend trip. This time we went to Dublin as none of us ha been there before. 
On the advice from fellow Tripadvisor readers and writers I choose the Roxford Lodge as our place of accommodation.
And it did not disappoint.

Right from the arrival, there was a friendly, family like atmosphere and friendliness.
We came very early and did not expect rooms to be available, which they not were much to regret of the lady in the reception. We off cause did not mind and told her we just walked to the city center as this had been our intentions all the time. 
The hotel is in Ballsbridge a 20 minute walk from the central shopping streets around Trinity College. In the afternoon we came back and the lady greeted us when we came back and told us everything was ready now and they had put our back in our room. She showed us the room and shortly after brought us tea and cookies to the room. The room is a bit on the small side especially as they have put in a infrared sauna in the rooms. However, my girlfriend who loves saunas was off casue very happy to discover this so it did not matter to us at all.
In the evening we went out again and when we came back a male person greeted us in the reception and shortly after brought us tea and cookies for the evening.
The bed was nice and the Jacuzzi and sauna did not subtract anything from the experience..
We had the Full Irish breakfast which was good and plentiful and the buffet was overwhelming. 
The hotel décor was what my girlfriend, being Chinese of origin, described as how she imagined an English house looked like (not to offend the Irish here).

Checkout and advice for the Sunday travels were accompanied by a nice chat on Asia as the man in the reception was an avid traveller himself so we could shared some experiences.

All in all a lovely place that hit the mark based on very personal and friendly service which was in sharp contrast to our experience the previous day at a restaurant in Copenhagen. Highly recommendable if you do not mind the short distance to the center and especially to couples like us.",5,2010,12,11
222,Should have 6 stars!,"Amazing!  After a long drive from Galway, we were warmly welcomed and brought up to our magnificent room.  Secure parking, a room with a whirlpool tub and sauna!  We stayed here the night before returning home to the US and were very sorry we only stayed 1 night. Next time we plan to stay at least 2 nights!  Love this place!!",5,2010,11,30
222,Amazing Rooms & service,"The hotel is easy to find and is 5 minutes walk from the airport bus stop at School House. We were warmly welcomed at reception and shown our amazing room. The room had everything you could want for a weekend away, sauna, jacuzzi, dvd player and a selection of dvd's, tea & coffee, complimentary toiletries, fax machine & printer.  The staff were incredibly friendly and went a long way to make your stay enjoyable. It's about a 20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin. I would definately recommend people to stay at this hotel.",5,2010,11,22
222,Blown away by the room,"We were greeted by a very friendly male member of staff who was very helpful. ( I forgot to get his name before he finished work ) He walked us through the use of Sauna an the in- room entertainment, before supplying us with complementary wine and chocolates. The suite was huge and good value for the money. Our suite had a big Jacuzzi on a separate level to the rest of the room. It also had a small kitchen but it had everything you need. You could seriously live in the suite for months. We are planning a longer return trip to the Roxford Lodge this summer.",5,2010,11,17
222,Luxury accommodation in gorgeous Georgian building,"I stayed here for 4 nights and absolutely loved it. It is situated away from the noise of central Dublin, in the inner suburb of Ballsbridge, which is quite posh, and very safe. It is a bit of a hike to get into Central Dublin (a good 20 mins or so) if you walk but there is a bus stop at the front gate and the buses are regular. Taxis are also going past all the time. 
Roxford Lodge is in a beautiful row of Georgian buildings. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Tea/coffee is a phone call away, beautifully presented. The breakfast was fantastic, a good range of items to choose from and staff very attentive. You can also request a drink to be brought to your room if you don’t feel like walking to one of the many local pubs in the area which looked inviting. My room was not huge but it was perfect for me, being one person. Might be a bit of a squish for two, but I believe not all the rooms are the same size so it might be worth enquiring if this might be an issue. The bathroom was lovely with a great spa in it, and of course there is the much-talked about sauna. I would love to know why they ended up putting these in the rooms, but I have to confess did use it when I felt a bit unwell. 
There are little touches with this place which take it up a notch and justify the expense and location. The building is beautiful, and inside my room there was a beautiful stained glass window and also, outside my main window, on the wall, there was a beautiful mural painted, that really only I could see. Roxford has definitely got the quirk factor happening, in a good way. 
I paid about $120 AUS per night including breakfast. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,11,07
222,Sauna surplus to requirements,"This is a perfectly acceptable little hotel, not too far from the centre of Dublin and close to some spectacularly good restaurants. It was clean, the beds were comfortable, the free wi-fi and car parking were very welcome, the staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast truly excellent. But the sauna in every room is just silly - and annoying. I did find a good use for it - the perfect place to park your suitcase. But in my very small single room it took up a good third of the space. Would stay there again- but would request a room without absurd gimmicks.",3,2010,11,01
222,Great Boutique Hotel,"What a wonderful place to stay in Dublin!  The Roxford Lodge Hotel is a lovely alternative from the mainstream hotels, which often look the same everywhere in the world, and where their staff is not always focused on good service.  From the moment you enter this boutique hotel in Ballsbridge, everyone is smiling and giving top-notch service.  Our flight from the States arrived early in the morning thus we were at the hotel by 11:00 in the morning.  We were asked if we would like a cup of tea or coffee, which we gladly accepted.  While our room was being made up, we sipped some soothing Irish Tea, and munched on some sweets and biscuits in their spacious living room.
The Roxford Lodge Hotel is a great choice for Dublin if you do not want to stay in the middle of things.  It is situated in a beautiful and safe neighborhood.  Taxi drivers have no clue where it is (we had to guide one of them in), and it is a bit of a walk to the center of Dublin.  Bus service in the area is great.  One can catch Aircoach at the airport, and be dropped off two minutes from the boutique hotel.  City bus service to Trinity College and the center of city is literally at the front door.
While our room is not the biggest, there was plenty of room to move about.  We did not expect anything bigger as we are in Europe.  Our bed was very comfortable.  Even with a street-facing room, noise was minimal.  Their Full Irish breakfast was amazing!  It is so big and delicious that my husband skipped lunch – something he usually does not do.  There are various cereals, yogurts, cheeses, fruit salad, juices, coffee, teas, and two kinds of toast - all included in our room rate.  
If you want a hotel that is quiet and peaceful, Roxford Lodge Hotel is exactly for you. It is definitely a top-five hotel for Dublin.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin thus when we are back in Ireland, we will be staying at the Roxford Lodge Hotel.",5,2010,10,25
222,A Wonderful Place to Stay in Dublin,"From the time you enter and you're asked if you would like a cup to tea or coffee, to your amazing room, close proximity to downtown Dublin, to the amazing breakfasts and incredible personable service....we wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin! Thank you Roxford Lodge for making our Dublin stay most memorable and we can't wait to return!!",5,2010,10,21
222,nice peacefull clean hotel,"just come back from stayin at the roxford lodge hotel,
what a pleasent stay me and my wife had,
the hotel is in a nice quiet location about 15 mins walk from the centre but buses stop outside the hotel so its easy to jump on a bus
you can order free tea or coffee anytime of the day which we did and it arrived within 5 mins everytime we ordered a realy nice touch by the hotel
the rooms are good quality and the sauna in the rooms are so relaxing also the bathroom had a jacuzzi bath ,the rooms were cleaned everyday ,
i cant realy moan about this hotel we had a great time in dublin",4,2010,10,18
222,Great place to stay,"On arrival we were met by a very friendly and helpful lady who showed us to our room. The free parking was also a major plus and the room had everything we needed and more including a fax machine, fridge, large tv., a safe, dvd's, a sauna and a large comfortable bed. The next morning we had a wonderful breakfast and the lady serving it was very friendly. I would wait here again.",5,2010,10,14
222,Fine place to stay,"The Roxford Lodge is a great choice for Dublin is you do not want to stay in the middle of things.  It is a bit out of the center of Dublin, but the bus to Trinity and the center of town literally stop at the front door.  Desmond, the manager, is as helpful as anyone could be, the room was spotless and the Irish breakfast was one of the best.  The one downer is the large box of a sauna that occupied one corner of the room.  It is big enough for two so it takes up a fair amount of space that otherwise might be useful.  Still, I would stay there again without any hesitation.",5,2010,10,11
222,great place to stay,"we stayed here last week for 4 days would  recommend this hotel it was are anniversary and they left wine and chocolates in the room lovely surprise the rooms are  lovey and a good size and the sauna was great, very quite  at night there is also very secure parking at the back there is a bus stop in front but because the weather was so good we walked in to the town  is about 10 minuets and a lovely safe area to walk we did not have breakfast here but we could have tea brought to the room any time there is a local bar round the corner called beggars bush which is very friendly and the drinks is reasonably priced  would stay here again next time in dublin",5,2010,10,10
222,Perfect Hotel in Dublin,"I researched a ton of hotels in Dublin and realized that staying outside of city centre is the BEST idea.  It is way too loud to stay right in the heart of Dublin...and trust me, you want a hotel that is quiet and peaceful.  Roxford Lodge is exactly that.  It is situated in a beautiful and safe neighborhood (Ballsbridge)  just 20 minutes (walk) or 10 minutes (bus) outside of city centre.  The bus stop is literally right outside the hotel!  Agnes and Desmond are wonderful hosts.  They were always there to give us directions (which bus to take to city centre, etc.) as well as recommend restaurants in the area.  Eat at Roly's Bistro Cafe if you have a chance.  It is about a 7 minute walk from Roxford Lodge -- just go LEFT outside the hotel and you'll find it!  It's right by the US Embassy.  The rooms were SPOTLESS and the beds SUPER COMFY (which isn't always easy to find).  The showers had great water pressure and the breakfasts were yummy.  Agnes always made sure our coffee/tea was overflowing and the toast warm and toasty!  We stayed here a total of 4 nights -- 2 in the beginning of our trip and 2 at the end.  Enjoy your stay!",5,2010,10,08
222,Great hotel in a Great location - Friendly staff!,"We stayed at the Roxford lodge for only one night but we were very happy with this hotel. The hotel had a very homey feel to it, and the staff did their best to make you feel as comfortable as possible. They let us park at the free private parking way before check in time and we could walk into town center in about 20 minutes.
Our room was not very big but it was very comfortable, especially the jet-stream bath after a long day of walking! Breakfast was very good as well.",5,2010,10,05
222,Absolutely everything you need in one room,"This hotel has everything you can think of in one room - incredible.  We only stayed overnight so cant comment on food etc, but we were very comfortable, about 20 min walk to the centre of Dublin, and a 10 min drive to Dublin port.",5,2010,10,02
222,"Cosy, clean, friendly Hotel.","I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It was a lovely warm, clean and cosy hotel. The staff were so friendly and the breakfast was lovely. The bus into town was just across the road and the bus back was on O'Connell Bridge not Supermacs like i was told at the hotel. It used to be across from Supermacs but its moved now.I would stay at this hotel again if I was going to a concert at the aviva stadium. We didn't use the Sauna but did use the jacuuzi bath, which was fab.",5,2010,09,29
222,"Roxford Lodge Hotel in Dublin offers one of the best combinations of price, service and comfort.","Personal, chique, not too far from center, staff is very polite and helpful. We felt welcome and respected. Ideal when looking for a quiet and comfortable place to rest when returning from a busy trip during the day. Prices are not expensive.",4,2010,09,27
222,"Very clean and comfortable, lovely staff.","We stayed in 3 single rooms, all spotlessly clean with all facilities necessary, e.g. fridge, fax, kettle, flat-screen tv.  Each room has an individual sauna, which takes up a bit of room, and probably a bit unnecessary, and each bathroom had a jacuzzi bath.  Good selection at breakfast - lovely fresh home-made brown bread  -  definitely won't go hungry! Will stay here again no problem and would definitely recommend to friends.",5,2010,09,26
222,Wonderful place to stay in Dublin.  Perfect area and perfect hostesses.,"This is a WONDERFUL place to stay while in Dublin.  Highly, highly recommend it.  The area is nice.  We felt safe walking all around the area. There are many good eating places within walking distances.  Also, the bus stops right in front of the hotel.
 The hostesses are OUTSTANDING. The breakfast is great.  I found absolutely nothing negative about this place.  Stay here...........you will be pleased!!",5,2010,09,17
222,Great hotel near city attractions but in quiet area,My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for two nights and were very pleased with the location (it's quite a walk to the city center BUT there is a bus stop right out front if you choose) and the cleanliness!  We only ate breakfast here (room service was GREAT!) and the Full Irish breakfast was amazing!  The only gripe I have is that the girl at the front all 3 days we were there was professional but not friendly.  We also did not use the sauna since the hotel has no air conditioning and it was warm during our stay.,4,2010,09,15
222,Wonderful stay with children at Roxford Lodge,"This is a lovely small hotel.  I'm going to start with the only minor annoyance - barking dogs.  Someone in the neighborhood has one or two yappers.  During the day we barely noticed the occasional small barking fit, but the few times it occurred at night it was annoying - I am a light sleeper.  Hope the Lodge purchases the dogs and gives them to a farmer far, far away.

Other than that, the Lodge is a delight - a bargain in Dublin, clean, pleasant, and with helpful, friendly staff, especially the proprietor, Des.
  
Transport:  Our children are both under age 10, and we had no trouble taking the bus to and from downtown (the bus stop is right out in front of the hotel!) for daily tourism.  This was very inexpensive, about 3 euros for our family of four, I believe.  Also, the airport coach (bus) lets off and picks up about a block away.  Sometimes, after a long day of walking around the main tourist areas, our little ones got tired and we took taxis back to the hotel.  The taxi trip from downtown to the lodge was about 10 or 12 euros with tip, I believe.  

Bedrooms:  very nice; clean, comfortable.  We had the ""family room"" and the room was a good size even by American standards, with one large bed and two twin beds, and a sauna and a bathroom with two sinks and a jacuzzi tub/shower.  Wow!   Also a sturdy desk and a small table with chairs.  Perfect.  The decor was pleasant, and there was a stained glass inset in the door to the bathroom...  
Comfortable pillows were provided (probably there were also some featherdown ones amongst the many on the beds, but I seized a synthetic-fill one) - good for allergy sufferers.  The bedding was very comfortable as well.

Free wifi!  We downloaded email on our mobile phones each morning and evening.

Food:  super.  This was the most sumptuous ""continental"" breakfast we've ever had - various cereals, yogurts, cheeses, fruit salad, juices, coffee, teas, two kinds of toast -  and it was included in our room rate.  One can also order the ""full Irish breakfast"" - a cooked breakfast - for additional amounts, but we are not big eaters and did not.  The dining room, by the way, has a beautiful round painted ceiling inset with tiny ""stars"" that change colors - I don't know how to describe this, but it fascinated my children and kept them occupied at times so my husband and I could converse.

Laundry:  laundry!  The Roxford Lodge will send out your laundry for a very small amount and send it back laundered and folded - they did a huge bag of laundry for us, for about seven euros total (approximately) (this is about what a large hotel chain in London would have charged me to wash a single dress) - I was glad to take the Lodge up on this option.

All in all, this was the perfect option for us.  The price was right, a lovely breakfast was included, our children could sleep in a room with us, the amenities were luxurious, and the location, in what is apparently a nice, safe neighborhood of old houses, was very close to city center.  I would stay here again.",5,2010,09,05
222,Wonderful hotel,"I was traveling to Ireland with my husband and my parents. I had read the reviews on TripAdvisor and decided to book here.  I am so glad we did!  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  My father smokes a pipe and they gave him a room with access to a patio. The breakfasts were great.  We only had the continental option but it was plentiful. The showers were hot and had good pressure.  The sauna in the room was a neat addition but we didn't use it so I can't really comment on it.
It is several blocks from city center but worth the walk.  Having the parking area behind the building was a great plus as well.
All in all, it was a great experience.",5,2010,08,31
222,Wow! Executive Suite blew us away!,"We were hoping for something special from the Roxford Lodge, based on other Trip Advisor Reviews and the hotel web site itself …and we weren’t disappointed.

The hotel is easy to find and about 20 minutes walk from the Molly Malone statue in Dublin city centre. If you don’t fancy walking, there are frequent buses which stop right outside the hotel, and the Aircoaches which run to and from Dublin International Airport (single trip 8 euros, return 14 euros) stop just 100 yards up the street.

Throughout our stay the hotel staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.

We booked for 4 nights in the Executive Suite at the top of the hotel, which was wonderfully equipped and even better than we’d expected. On the lower level was a main bathroom (bath/shower, toilet, bidet, sink) and kitchen (sink, oven and hob, microwave, dishwasher, washing machine, etc.). There isn’t any crockery, cutlery, pans, etc. in the kitchen by default, but anything can easily be borrowed from the hotel kitchens on request.

Up a few steps was the main room, where a king size four-poster bed faced a large flat screen TV, with sound system and DVD player (with a selection of DVDs to watch). This room also included two built-in wardrobes, a roomy sauna, and a drinks bar complete with bar stools, fridge and sink.

A separate room contained a single bed and the office area, with its free-to-use computer, printer/copier, and wi-fi connection. Beyond that was a small balcony.

Up some stairs from the main room was the Jacuzzi, with a second flat screen TV. Spread throughout the suite were 6 telephone handsets.

When we arrived we found a bouquet of fresh lilies, a box of Belgian chocolates and a bottle of wine waiting for us – a really nice touch and much appreciated.

The Full Irish breakfast was very tasty and plenty to keep us going for the day. Also included in the price of our stay was unlimited tea, coffee and bisuits brought to the room whenever requested!

Our only (small) gripe was that the room was very hot at night, with no way to cool it down – although to be fair we did manage to visit during some of the hottest weather they’ve had in recent years.

All in all an excellent stay in a friendly and great value hotel. Definitely hope to visit the Roxford Lodge again in the future.",5,2010,08,30
222,Great Value in Dublin,"After reading other reviews, decided to book in for one night. The hotel was small and comfortable. We arrived mid morning and asked to leave baggage prior to checking in as too early we thought to get rooms, however we were lucky and both the single and double room were ready for us straight away. Only complaint was not very welcoming staff member on arrival. However other staff more than made up for this later in the stay. Beds very comfortable. Rooms which were on the lower floor were  bright and clean and most important ly we had a very quiet night without disturbances. 
Breakfast was one of the best I've had in a hotel and as much as you could eat. Service at breakfast was also friendly and efficient. Again when we checked out the hotel were happy to hold luggage till later in the day .
Approx 15 minutes walk to St Stephens Green and Trinity College. We used the buses which stopped almost outside the hotel and also local taxis to save our feet all the extra walking.  Will definately stay here again as very reasonable prices for Dublin.",5,2010,08,26
222,"Pleasant, convenient hotel","We stayed at the Roxford Lodge twice, at the beginning and end of our holiday in Ireland.  On both occasions we were very happy.  On the first occasion we had a small room with an unnecessary electric sauna (without it the room would have been less cramped) and on our return a palatial suite on the top floor complete with PC, a fabulous proper sauna and whirlpool bath.  Apparently the last room had been allocated to us!  Both rooms were clean, well appointed but slightly dated.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Note that breakfasts are charged extra - the continental was generous and very good value.  Note also that free parking is available, not always the case in a city.
The hotel is on the edge of the centre, south east of the canal.  There are lots of buses running past the door - it takes about 10 mins into the city centre.  If you have time, do walk but avoid the main road.  Once past the canal you are into splendid Regency terraces, squares, gardens and grand goverment buildings. A gentle walk, allowing time to be distracted and explore, will take about 30 mins into the centre.  You will have seen much of interest on the way.",4,2010,08,24
222,"Comfortable, quiet luxurious b&b with friendly staff","Stayed here 13-16th August and couldn't fault the room cleanliness. 
The hotel is about 10 mins walking to Merrion Sq. Park and about 15 to Trinity College, which means it is very quiet: GREAT for a good night's rest, which we value.
The younger members of staff were especially friendly and helpful and appeared to be genuinely interested in our customer satisfaction.
We found our room comfortable and did use the sauna,which we thought quite unusual . We didn't have a jacuzzi and the shower (more like a driblle- no water pressure) was NOT encased in a normal shower cubicle and ran straight onto the tiled floor.Since the water would not go down the drain (unless you happened to have brought a mop with you) this meant wet feet whenever you popped into the bathroom. We asked for extra towels to keep soaking up the wet floor., which were provied, but they really need to sort this bathroom out.
We ate breakfast out, as we thought the hotel breakfast expensive at  at 12€ per person. 
WE WOULD DEFINITELY stay here again but NOT in room 109.",4,2010,08,19
222,A complete let down,"My partner and I stayed here last weekend on a well needed break away and after seeing the reviews on here I thought it simply couldn't go wrong! How wrong was I! 

We arrived at 4pm and the room wasn't cleaned yet (even though check in states after 12pm). On arrival in the room I have to say I was more than a little disappointed, everything about the hotel states luxury and this room clearly wasn't. It was a small pokey room (119) which clearly hadn't been any part of the refurbishment of the hotel and looked more like a room from a 1970's coaching inn. It clearly looked like a single room. There is a big sauna in the room that serves no purpose other than to make the room look even more pokey and small. The bathroom is up some marble/tiled steps which we nicknamed the death steps as once you had got out of the shower walking down them became near impossible without thinking you were going to break your neck. The jacuzzi bath was tiny and would fit one person sitting up. We were hungry so we left the bags and went off. When we returned later that evening I walked around the room and found that the carpet hadn't been hoovered, and the bathroom looked like it had just had a customary wipe around, there was hair dotted around. 

By this point I was past caring and exhausted and so we just went to bed. 

The next day we went sightseeing and upon return we were please to find that someone had cleaned the room properly finally.

We didn't eat breakfast there so I can't comment on how good it was. 

We hated this hotel so much that we were going to move to another hotel however after getting a bit to into the Jameson's factory we had left it too late to tell the hotel. Had I been able to afford it I would have just happily paid again for a better hotel.

Overall this hotel (glorified B&B) certainly didn't live up to the trip advisor ratings. I was very disappointed with this hotel so much so that we searched for an alternative. My partner became equally disappointed more so because as he had seen how much searching I had done online for a perfect hotel for our getaway.

Clearly this hotel has excellent rooms however I never saw them in full (A quick glance into one that was being cleaned the day we left added insult to injury!) I won't be recommending this hotel to anyone and feel completely let down, if I had been on my own and booked a single room then that would have been fine however they clearly put us in a single room and allowed us to pay for a double.",2,2010,08,16
222,Terrific place to stay while visiting Dublin,"My family (husband, and two kids, ages 8 and 10) and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge for four nights. It is a perfect place to stay while visiting Dublin, especially for a family. We were given their largest room (Room 115) and it was fine for the four of us. A queen bed and two twins. The room was comfortable and the staff were very accommodating. The location is great. It's in an upscale neighborhood (Ballsbridge) where many of the embassies are located. It is a nice 10 - 15 minute walk from the center of Dublin. Considering how crowded the center of the city can be, we found this location to be perfect. The room price included a full Irish breakfast, served in the their dining room each morning. A great way to start a day full of sight seeing.",5,2010,08,15
222,"Great location, clean & well equiped rooms and warm welcome","Stayed here for a brief visit to Dublin. Just outside the city centre, the Roxford Lodge is located at a beautifull street ,a pleasant walk away from the busy city centre. The modern rooms are very well equiped and clean. The beds are good, small balcony, nice tv-set (with DVD player and DVD's to choose from), bubble bath and sauna in the room. The building is beautifully restored. 
It is a family run hotel, which makes the service excellent. Breakfast is good, you can give your order and the kitchen will prepare your choice of breakfast. 
Pricing is fine. The Roxford Lodge is a lovely alternative for the mainstream hotels (which often look the same and where staff is not always service-focused). Don't focus on being in the city centre, the Roxford Lodge is just 15-20 minutes walk away from the city centre.",5,2010,07,25
222,Great hotel,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at the Roxford Lodge immensely. We chose it based on the reviews here and we weren't disappointed. Our room was on the basement, but totally unlike the typical basement rooms: we had a small terrace outside, so the room had enough light, and we could come and go through the terrace instead of using the hotel's main entrance. 

We were given a triple room, although we were paying for a double. Each bed had its own TV, and we also had a sauna, a printer and a fax in the room. The room and bathroom were very clean, although the room was a bit crammed. The bathroom wasn't very big, but it wasn't small, either. Everything looked new.

The breakfast quality was good and the Irish breakfast and the toasts were prepared as we ordered them.

The hotel is located in one of the best neighbourhoods in Dublin, it was a 20-minute walk from the hotel to the city centre. We never took the bus. 

The staff were very nice and extremely helpful. They even checked and printed some bus timetables for us one day we wanted to go to the outskirts of the city.

If we ever go back to Dublin, we would probably stay there again.",5,2010,07,22
222,Wonderfull Hotel- A little gem,"I stayed here for a weekend trip with my other half. From start to finish I was very impressed with the quality of service and attention to detail. We where lucky enough to get a lovely upgrade to Room 120. What a nice surprise that was. 3 stories, little kitchen, big jacuzzi with a tele, and a lovely sauna. On top of that there was a computor with working internet, fax and printer. 
The room was spacious, clean and very practical. Breakfast in the morning was exellent and cooked to order. What a difference to chain hotel groggy breakfasts. 
The staff where extremely friendly, and helpfull and coffee and tea complementary as much as you want.
Its about 10 minutes from the city centre, but easy accesible walking and a bus stop right in front of their door. Very quiete at night which is a good thing as city hotels can be noisy.
I would defenitly use and reccommend this hotel!!!!",5,2010,07,21
222,Great value - so much for so little!,"The room was everything we could have asked for and more - thought we had been given the wrong room at first as there was so much included for a very reasonable price - sauna, spa, computer, printer, kitchenette 4 poster bed etc etc. Breakfast was fantastic too as were the friendly staff and service. Found a great little pub around the corner. Will definitely (and have already) reccomend it friends and family.",5,2010,07,08
222,"Friendly, relaxed and beautifully low key hotel","Stayed here for one night with my wife and 9 year old son in a triple room. The duty manager Des could not do enough and was incredibly helpful, knowledgable and professional. We have visited Dublin many times for short breaks and have been tired of the noise and formality of larger chain hotels. This hotel is a beautiful 4 story old Georgian propert located 15 minutes stroll from the city centre in the upmarket Ballsbridge area. There is a practically direct bus from the airport and a regular bus service right outside the hotel if required. The Dart rail network is 10 minutes walk as is the new national stadium. The area is quiet and classy. close enough to the city but far enough away to enjoy a relaxing time. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The 3rd bed was a full size single and easily fit in the room. The sauna in the room is a nice touch although we did not use it. The breakfast is outstanding and little benefits as in the free use of the internet, wi-fi and tean and coffee make the difference. We are seasoned Dublin travellers and you will not get better value, better staff (Des - top bloke!) and better location. First class!!",5,2010,07,04
222,Clean and Accommodating,"We stayed there twice. On our first arrival the room was quite small for three people. Since we only stayed for two nights, it was bearable. The room was clean and the hosts were friendly and accommodating. The breakfasts were wonderful. Plenty of on-site parking. Easy walking distance to downtown.

On our second return, we were upgraded without requesting it. To our pleasant surprise, we stayed in their penthouse room, which actually was an apartment. Very comfortable for long term stays. Sadly for us, we were staying for only one night. We arrived by taxi from the airport. It was a tight fit with all our luggage and three people in a small car with small trunk space. However, the driver was pleasant and even set-up a taxi van to take us to the airport the next morning. That driver was pleasant as well and full of information. He made a wonderful tour guide for our ride from the hotel to the airport.",5,2010,06,29
222,Very nice choice for a Dublin Stay,"My wife, teenage daughter and I just came back from a trip to Europe that included a 5-night stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel (RL).  I decided to stay at the RL due to the good reviews here at TripAdvisor, the problem of finding a triple downtown at a reasonable cost, and the fact that it was reportedly quiet - I'm a light sleeper.

At first I was hesitant when told we'd be on the ground floor - I always think people walking by will be looking in - but the very nice patio that the room looked out on made up for it, even if the patio was shared by other rooms and indeed we sometimes had to keep the curtains closed for privacy.

The room was L-shaped and quite large - my wife and I of course took the double bed while my delighted daughter slept 'around the corner' in a bed with her own TV.  The fact that the room was large was offset by the fact that there was a big sauna in the room - I'd read about it but really think the RL should consider removing them - without them the hotel would lose some quirkiness but gain a lot more useable room.

The staff was great - coffee and/or tea w/cookies offered pretty much every time you return, and delivered to your room.  I had trouble connecting to their free wi-fi and was very happy when offered a network cable to connect with instead, free of charge.  The breakfast was a la carte or cooked to order, with french toast my favorite.

My only caveat was that the hotel is a ways from the town center.  While only 15-20 minutes the walk itself passes very safe but fairly drab buildings - kind of makes the walk a drag instead of fun exercise, especially after walking all day in the town center.  On the other hand Dublin seems to have a vast bus system, and if you want to ride you won't walk far or wait long.

Lastly, if you go here, be sure to take a left out of the hotel and eat at the nearby restaurants in the direction away from the town center.  The first day there was no one at the desk to ask and we ended up going on the long walk towards the city mentioned above just to find something to eat - we learned the next day to take a left vs a right for nearby dining.",4,2010,06,24
222,love love loved it!!,"just so amazing!! me and  my boyfriend are from Dublin and we just stayed here one weekend for a bit of luxery!! we loved it!! sauna is great!! there was a jaccuzi bath too and the bed was possibly the comfyest and cosyest iv ever been in!! nice then my own!! 
iv already recommended it to loads of my friends!!",5,2010,06,09
222,Roxford lodge is the jewel of Dublin,"Just returned from 2 weeks in Ireland and stayed with our adult daughters at Roxford lodge What a jewel to be found! Near city center but out of the noise. Our daughters shared a room but it was L shaped and each had their own privacy. We both had the lovely little patio outside to sit with morning coffee. Bus stop in front if you do not want to walk, restaurants nearby and excellent service. Very friendly staff, always welcoming and willing to accomodate needs. We would return from seeing Dublin in the afternoon and need ice/water/sodas and they were in our room within minutes. Lovely tea to be had at all times. Rooms were lovely and very comfortable. Breakfast was extraordinary- do not miss it.  Dinner nearby at  Old Schoolhouse hotel/pub was outstanding. Cannot say enough good things about Roxford Lodge. and the wonderful staff",5,2010,06,08
222,"Very nice room, located in a quiet area","We chose the hotel because of the good ratings and the free car parking (we drove with a rental car). The hotel is in a quiet residential area, not in the centre of Dublin. It's about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College (pretty much walk straight NW on the road in front of the hotel). There is also a bus stop right in front of the hotel. By the way, there is a very nice bar/pub in the street behind the hotel.

We were very happy with our stay. We had a triple room, with 3 beds, a large bathroom (with jacuzzi), and a sauna in the corner of the room (very unique). The beds were comfortable although not as long (if you are 6 feet/180 cm or taller, your feet will be outside of the bed). 

The service (by the owner) was great, she provided us with tea, coffee and cookies and all the information we needed (and a map). The continental breakfast (6 Euro per person) was good, liked the fresh fruit and juice, and well-cooked scrambled eggs.",4,2010,05,29
222,As good as it gets!,"My girlfriend and I stayed there during my visit to Dublin. I booked my first night there, found it to be the gem I've read it up to be, traveled other parts of Ireland, then ended a 10 day great trip with my last 2 nights, once again, at Roxford Lodge. I think that in itself says a lot. But to add, the rooms are clean, modern, and well kept. The service and hospitality was genuine and more than I could ask for - she, likely the owner, helped with taxis, airport buses, local restaurants (Roly's bistro is classy and tasty), and the like. She also ran the kitchen and personally served us our delicious, full-Irish breakfasts! Parking was easy since my girlfriend, from Ireland, had a car (this is one of the initial reasons why i chose this place, in addition to her being scared to drive in Dublin!) I'm definitely coming back here! Thanks for a wonderful stay...twice!!!",5,2010,04,26
222,Good hotel with a few flaws,"I stayed together with 5 family members at the Roxford Lodge recently. When we arrived by bus from Galway we almost thought we'd come to the wrong place. Situated in a quiet almost suburban street we were a little surprised, since we expected at least a few restaurants and stores in the area. Nevertheless we were greated with a nice complimentary tea and biscuits in front of the fire place in the lounge. Since we arrived at 10 pm there were nothing to eat, and we got really good help ordering pizza assisted by the nice woman in the reception.

The rooms are quite nice with large lcd-tv with both good quality picture and a good amount of both Irish and International channels. Bed was very comfy and we slept well. Internet is available both wired and wireless and was free, fast and worked well. There's also the the slightly weird sauna and a jacuzzi bath-tub. We tried them both and whilst the sauna felt a little weird using in your own room, the jacuzzi were great after a day of walking around Dublin.

We had breakfast at the hotel most of the days and the continental breakfast at 6 euros were in our opinion great value with freshly made fruit salad, freshly squeezed juice and cold cuts, cereal, cheeses and bread. The full Irish breakfast was good, but not really worth 12 euros.

As to location, the Roxford Lodge is about 15-20 minutes walk from Grafton Street (city center), and 10 minutes from Merrion Park. The bus to and from the city stops right outside the hotel, and it was 1,15 euros one way.

We used the lounge a coupled of times, having a beer after getting back to the hotel at night. The prices were good but there were no bar, you just ordered a drink from the reception-staff. It did'nt seem to be used that much as beer wasn't replenished during our four-day stay and there was a little limited selection to choose from.

The feel of the hotel is in my opinion a little to stay in someones home. It's a quite nice difference from busier 'business hotels' and we enjoyed our stay at the Roxford Lodge. It could be a little cleaner, our bath room lock for instance wasn't working, it's a bit far from the city center, and there's not much party going on. But it was a really good value for the about 90 euros we paid per night. A quite strong four star rating. Would stay again.",4,2010,04,12
222,stay anywhere else in Dublin,"The Roxford Lodge was extremely disappointing. The staff were cold and unhelpful. The rooms were marginal -- not nearly the ""luxury"" accommodations they claim. The bizarre sauna-in-every-room gimmick was just that -- a bizarre gimmick. My husband and I are very laid back travelers. We stayed at seven different B & Bs and hotels on our trip to Ireland. All of them were dramatically better than the Roxford Lodge. At each one, we received better service, more charming, clean, and welcoming rooms, and far better value than we experienced at the Roxford Lodge. Our advice: stay anywhere else in Dublin.",1,2010,04,11
222,Sweet gem of a hotel,"Spent Easter holiday weekend at the Roxford Lodge. The room was very comfortable and extremely clean!  We had a great jacuzzi tub and a sauna to enjoy. Even though the room faced the street, we did not notice any road noise and as this was a very quiet residential street is was very pleasant. The walk to the city center was slightly longer than anticipated, but it was quite walkable. The Hop-On-Hop-Off Bus was very conveniently located at Merrion Square so we used that for our transportation for two days. The tea and biscuits served to our room was such a nice touch and the breakfast was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2010,04,07
222,Fine - but room for improvement,"We were slightly disappointed with this hotel after reading all the excellent reviews on this site. Spotlessly clean, yes, but our basement room was rather small (it felt as if the sauna and fax machine were taking up much-needed space) and had french doors out onto the car park, which made it feel rather overlooked. It was also down past the kitchens, and a smell of cooking fat seemed to constantly hang around the corridors, although this wasn't noticeable in the room itself.

Some nice touches. Free wi-fi, and the tea and biscuits on arrival were much appreciated, as were the selection of DVDs in the room (although I had some difficultly getting a good picture). 

Other good points seemed to be undermined by small problems. Great to have a jacuzzi bath, but the water pressure was so low it took a long time to fill. Good choice at breakfast, but let down by some cheap ingredients, chiefly the white sliced bread used for the toast and french toast; an odd contrast with the lovely brown soda bread they bring you.

Nothing worth complaining about, though. Overall, we had a good stay, and I would recommend it, with minor reservations. Perhaps ask for an upstairs room.",4,2010,04,03
222,"Excellent, if they could only improve …","Fabulous & well-maintained rooms. Our room had its own infra-red heated sauna; fax machine was there; electric kettle with generous selection of hot drinks. All that for Euro 95/night with breakfast. In short, it would be really unfair to complain about the hardware standard. Price 

However, there was something fundamental lacking. The young lady working on that night did promptly and attentively what she was supposed to do – stone-faced. She was so impression-less that believe me placing a robot there would have made little difference. Remember, in hospitality branch, guests must feel welcome and comfortable. If she could only add a smile while serving guests, the overall experience of this property would have enhanced manifold. 

We checked-in on Sunday 7/2.",4,2010,03,28
222,Must stay here,"Arrived to be greeted with the offer of tea or coffee. We had two doubles and one single. Rooms had everything including sauna and jacuzzi bath.  Spotless. All had back views to car park and small water feature.  Very pleasant and very quiet. 
We were in Dublin for the rugby and had it been at Landsdowne Road then this would be an ideal location.
Bus stops (including airport bus) are all within easy walking distance. We walked everywhere. Probably a good 15 minutes to the centre. Shops and restaurants are all within a 15 minute walk and our favourites were Roly's Bistro and Bloom Brasserie.
The breakfasts were eagerly looked forward to! Excellent. We loved them and the service.
Liked least - Wardrobe space was limited in the rooms.
Full marks to all the staff. This is a ""must stay"" hotel.",5,2010,03,23
222,Excellent choice of hotel,"The hotel was excellent, well placed for getting into town where you can shop till you drop. The service was fantastic, having tea/coffee brought to your room for no extra charge was a welcoming touch. Breakfast was very good and the fact that the staff got up early to cook it for us as we had an early flight was very much appreciated. The room was lovely and clean however the beds were a little too hard for our liking. The sauna and jacuzzi bath are a great addition and after a full day shopping or sightseeing aching muscles are well catered for.",5,2010,03,01
222,An inner city haven!,"Recently stopped at the delightful Roxford Lodge and simply couldnt falt it. It is situated in a quiet area on the outskirts of the city centre. On arrival we were greated by a friendly lady who made us feel instantly at home, offering us tea and coffee delivered straight to our room. The room was spottless and very well equipped (including a jacuzzi bath and sauna & big flatscreen tv on the wall). There is a bus stop right outisde so it is easy to get to and from the city centre. After our 2 night stay we just didnt want to leave. This is a hotel that I can confidently recommend to anyone and I can guarentee that I would stay here again myself!",5,2010,01,28
222,Great Service,"My family and I had the pleasureof staying at The Roxford Lodge for 3 nights. All I can say is the rooms were spottless, the service was great and they serve the best breakfest in Ireland! Thenafter I left and was out of the country I realized I had forgotten my wedding ring. When I called they said they had found it and put it in the mail. Our whole expereince during and after has been great!.",5,2010,01,18
222,"what a dream, wish I was still there","As soon as we arrived we were made to feel so welcome, the check in stage was easy and quick and we were taken to our room and what a room!, a sauna, a flat screen tv with dvd player and dvds! a music system for inside the sauna! a little balcony, a jacuzzi bath one of the most comfortable beds ever! a table with two chairs space to hang your clothes basically everything you need and more!

The staff at the hotel were just brilliant and were always happy to help we even got a tray of biscuits and extra coffee bought to our room, we didnt have the breakfast though if we come again we more than likely will do. 

The location was brilliant away from the city centre so very queit yet close enough to walk it took us about 10-15 mins to get to to the main shopping street. 

If you do get a bus please beware that they dont give change you need to have the exact money. 

The bus service from the airport was simple and easy straight through the doors you buy your ticket there, returns are much cheaper and you get dropped off two mins down the road at the school house hotel.

For eating and drinking we mainly went to temple bar, this street is packed with restraunts and pubs however it is expensive in dublin so always worth taking a bit extra out with you. We spent about 17 euros on a steak and it was around 13 euros to 16 euros for anything like pizza pastas extra obviously depending on where you go., for two bottles of beer it cost around 11 euros. 

The wax museum is a must we really enjoyed our visit there it was really fun and had some amazing features. 

We will return to roxford lodge hotel hopefully for my birthday in September, I would not like to stay anywhere other than this hotel now as it has everything we needed and great service.",5,2010,01,11
222,Best place to stay if you want to be out of the city centre!,"We stayed here with friends, had two rooms.  They assigned us a room originally which was too hot and was TINY.  We asked to move, and for the remaining four nights, we were in a great room that had all of the amenities and plenty of space.  The service at the Roxford cannot be beat.  The family is so nice and helpful and the constant offer of tea and coffee was very welcome because it was very cold throughout our stay.  The breakfast is great.  It is about 15-20 minutes to walk into the city centre and other sites, but worth it.  It's very quiet and serene.  Also, there are great restaurants (The Chophouse and Roly's) and pubs (Bellamy's) nearby, so you only have to go five minutes to get to the some of Dublin's best.  I highly recommend the Roxford to anyone going to Dublin!",4,2010,01,10
222,Great little place with great service,"Very nice place to stay while in Dublin.  Quiet, not far from the city,very helpful,  and great service.  We will be staying there again!!!
Nothing like the full Irish breakfast..",4,2010,01,09
222,Charming and close to city center,"I very much enjoyed my stay here. Stayed for 2 nights and was impressed with the staff - very friendly and helpful. If you're traveling to the lodge via the airport shuttle, the stop is about a block walk away. The lodge itself is pretty walk to downtown (15-20mins), or there is a city bus stop right outside which will take you to sightseeing and shopping. Our stay was very comfortable and the free internet was a bonus! The is a lift available (although tucked away) but not too many stairs inside. Outside there are some vertical steps that almost killed me with my oversized suitcase, but that wouldn't stop me from staying again!",4,2009,12,09
222,A five-star place if they fix a few problems,"First off, I am not sorry we stayed here.  This hotel is beautifully situated with central Dublin just ten minutes' walk in one direction and a charming array of bistros five minutes' away in the opposite direction.  The entire establishment's been remodeled and upgraded; the rooms are GORGEOUS; the bathrooms are spacious; the breakfasts were fabulous with a wonderful array of choices; and the staff is first-rate.  For example, we had a flat tire that needed fixing on a weekend but couldn't find anyone in town to help.  The receptionist arranged for one of their own to change the flat out--who came in on his own time and refused any kind of payment.  Each and every staff member went out of his or her way to make us feel pampered and welcome.
I have only two complaints.  A) The lights work on motion detectors which is cool until someone gets up in the middle of the night to go the bathroom and the hall light switches on.  This needs to be changed; I never got a full night's sleep.  B) You can't call yourself a proper hotel if the hot water runs out early in the evening.  I can understand running out of hot water in my house, but if you're a hotel, then you need to plan for your guests probably taking showers at roughly the same time.
Other than those minor quibbles, though, this is a fabulous find.",4,2009,12,06
222,Satisfying travellers needs,"Had a great time, rooms were spacious and comfortable, no doubt about the cleanliness, absolutely marvellous breakfast and last but not least very helpful and friendly personnel. Finnish or Swedish travellers will have their absolute delight with the Saunas.",5,2009,11,23
222,Nice but saunas in the way,"As previous reviewers said, very clean, excellent staff, always offering tea and cookies.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom nicely done. Our son had a very small single on the bottom floor at the back of the hotel.  It was charming and perfect for him.  Our room (and we did get a very cheap rate) was quite small, which would have been ok except that the sauna was really in the way and made it hard to get around in the room.  I imagine the larger rooms here are lovely, but didn't actually see one.",4,2009,11,16
222,Clean,"I was prepared not to like this hotel because I arrived in Dublin early in the morning, unexpectedly, and the hotel was closed so I had to wait an hour out in the cold for someone to open up.  But, then I had no problems checking in early and the room itself was great. It was very clean and had a nouveau rustic feel to it. There is also free internet in the lodge and the location is good - outside is a bus stop that takes you to the city center. Thought breakfast was included but learned differently at checkout. Overall a good stay.",4,2009,11,14
222,Great hotel but avoid the room downstairs,We were given the room downstairs next to the kitchen when we showed up.  This room was so small our luggage barely fit.  The bathroom door had to be closed to see the TV.  The exterior floodlight that lights up the hotel was right outside the window.  Not worth the money at all.  To their credit they moved us the next night and the room was great (and much bigger). Recommended but don't stay in that room!!!!!!!!!,4,2009,10,27
222,Great location and service,"Great value, away from the congestion and noise of Temple Bar, a small b&b-like hotel in a very nice part of town.  We bought a bus pass and used it the 3 days we were there – a bus stop to the 4a, 7 and several other buses is literally on the doorstep (coming from the center of town, signal for a stop right after you cross a small canal.  One main4a/7bus stop out to the hotel is right in the middle of the O'Connell Bridge.  It's about a 10 minute ride.)  Our room was upgraded (I'm thinking it was  #118).  We didn't eat breakfast there, which would have been extra, but it smelled good.  There's a computer/internet available to use in the sitting room.  Definitely would recommend it.",5,2009,10,17
222,many pleasant surprises from the stay,"I would say that I had many pleasant surprises from my stay at this hotel. It is a very good one if you are into boutique hotels that focus on delicacy. Tea and cookies are available upon request. The staff is very sincere. There is a sauna box in the room and jacuzzi in the bathroom. Other than the room being a little small (given that there is a sauna box in the room and many other furnitures which made the room exceptionally cosy), everything made the experience heavenly.",5,2009,10,04
222,Best Service Ever,"I stayed on Dublin 4 days on September 2009 and picked the Roxford for his value andthe good review here on tripadvisor, i'm happy to say that this hotel exceded my expectations, i had been on several five stars hotels, and never saw the kind of service that they offered, was really personalized and cozy 

the hotel is an quiet place and also at 15 min walk from city center and right close to the air coach ""navette"" to the airport..and the value unbeatable.

they have really do a great thing with this hotel
the only suggestion for them..please install wi-fi in the rooms ;)",5,2009,10,03
222,Well run small hotel in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Roxford Lodge, with our two girls along with us. All of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. (I offered a tip on my way out...They wouldn't accept it.) Food was good and plentiful. The rooms were recently remodeled and very clean.  The room layout left something to be desired; So much space was consumed by the sauna and bathroom, it did cut into the living area, particularly with 4 of us in one room. Our kids got a big kick out of the sauna though.  The location is close enough to walk to tourist sites.",5,2009,10,01
222,Unbeatable Value,"Really great, rooms a little bit small but with all convenience (radio/cd/DVD/TV-Flatscreen,fax,sauna,""whirlpool""). Modern, trendy but also comfortable. Breakfast great, eat as much as you can.All day over free coffee and tea (served in room too). We had room 104 which had a direct exit to a small ""garden"" ideal even for smokers.
servants very friendly and helpfull. 15 minutes walk to temple bar etc. We will come back !",5,2009,09,25
222,"Lovely room, great price (for Dublin), very good","Just stayed here for 3 nights in room 118. We'd had a disaster by turning up at an appalling hotel in Rathmines and I remembered that Roxford had good reviews. We called with our sob story and got the last double room -- and it made our trip! The room was big, had a small balcony, was spotlessly clean, fluffy duvet and comfy mattress. The sauna and  the whirlpool bath were nice extras. Can't fault anything, especially since as you come back from touring around the desk clerk immediately asks if you'd like tea or coffee and brings it and biscuits up to your room. Excellent touch. Good breakfast, though avoid the 'French toast' and opt for the oatmeal instead. 
It's about a 20 minute walk to Trinity with some nice scenary along the way, including Oscar Wilde's statue (don't miss it!) and there are several buses running through town that are immediately across the street from the lodge (maybe 5-6 minutes on the buses to Trinity). Heartily recommend, and in the off season they may even negotiate your room price (though they may not like me saying so).",5,2009,09,21
222,Hidden Gem in Dublin,"The staff was super-duper helpful.  The manager ( I wish I remembered his name!) seemed to be everywhere at any time - he was at the front desk to help us arrange a pub crawl reservation, he was walking the hallways to help us answer some questions about Dublin - he was even in the kitchen cooking when I wanted to thank him the morning we left!  Awesome location, room had a sauna AND hot-tub bathtub, INCREDIBLE value for being in downtown Dublin.  Would not even think about looking for another place to stay when we return, I would book Roxford Lodge instantly.",5,2009,09,20
222,Great room at a great price,"The Roxford Lodge is a 15-minute walk from the center of Dublin, in a quiet part of town - a outstanding place for the value.  The room was large and clean, and the clerk on duty was friendly and very helpful.  After a day of sightseeing in Dublin, it was a welcome and restful place to retire for the night.",5,2009,09,12
222,Very good indeed,"Very good all round as per previous reviews. Quiet, clean good-sized room with a good bathroom. Very good breakfast and the offers of tea / coffee with biscuits (free) virtually every time we walked in were particularly welcome. It's about 15 mins walk to town but there is a bus-stop right outside if you need it.
Although Dublin is quite expensive generally, this hotel is very good value and we would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
If you want a trip out of town, the DART railway is very good - only €5 for an all day ticket. The closest station is about 5 mins from the hotel and you can use it to get into town or up and down the coast",5,2009,09,10
222,A nice place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed for one night at the Roxford Lodge.  The hotel is situated on the outskirts of central Dublin - about 20 minutes walk to Temple Bar.

The rooms were clean, tidy and reasonably large.  My only complaint was that the bathroom had a shower curtain - a pet peeve of mine.  However, it was clean, tidy and large.

The breakfast was quite good, with a wide variety of cereal available, as well as a traditional Irish cooked breakfast.

The staff were friendly and very helpful.

I would recommend the the Roxford Lodge as a good place to stay in Dublin.",4,2009,09,08
222,Wonderful stay.  A home away from home.,"I was in Dublin for a conference at UCD and stayed at the Roxford Lodge for 6 wonderful nights.  The staff are very friendly and personable, the hotel is clean and tidy, the beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is delicious.  It was quite a good value considering what you're getting.  I paid 79 euro/night (single with breakfast) and got a comfy bed in a clean and quite setting just a short walk into town, free high speed internet access, free car parking, in-room flat screen TV's with DVD player and a wide assortment of movies, free computer usage and printing services, the list goes on. I easily would have paid double this price had I been staying at a ‘business’ hotel and it wouldn’t have been as nice.  The breakfast was quite hearty with a wide selection of juices (including fresh squeezed orange juice), breads, whole and sliced fruits, cheeses, yogurt, french toast, omelets, and even a full Irish Breakfast.  

This hotel should really be classified as a B&B rather than a hotel, but it certainly made my trip much more enjoyable than staying at a business hotel.  The corridors and rooms are a little cramped when navigating with your luggage, but it wasn't too bad.  All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.  Since the location was not in the city center I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars for location.  However, it is an easy walk into town and there are several bus lines that run throughout the city from the bus stop right in front of the hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay here for your next visit to Dublin!  You won't regret it!   It felt like you're staying at your favorite aunt's house rather than at a business hotel and that makes it all the better.",5,2009,08,30
222,"Great staff, location & beautiful rooms.","Would recommend this hotel highly. The location is great, only about a 20 minute walk into Dublin, close to bus stops & the airport bus. The staff were exceptionally friendly & could not do enough for us. As soon as we walked in the door after being out for the day, we were asked if we wanted food or drinks & the breakfast was like a huge home cooked meal. Rooms were spacious & clean & we were made to feel so like home. More like a B&B atmosphere. Great to have our own little passageway with only our 2 rooms coming off it. Nice comfortable sitting room with computer access also.",5,2009,08,27
222,Beyond Expectations,"We booked the Roxford online after Googling for hotels in Dublin. It was beyond my expectations! It is a small, intimate hotel about a 15 minute walk from Trinity College located in a neighborhood of Georgian buildings near the American Embassy. The inside has been completely updated in a very classy way. It is super quiet! The rooms have a sauna and jetted tub. The sauna seems like overkill but they're trying to add amenities. There is a guest lounge with a computer and internet access. The breakfast is fantastic! You can order the full Irish breakfast, omelets, French toast, oatmeal, etc. The table is stylished set with linens and china. The staff was genuinely friendly and hospitable. We needed to leave for the airport at 6:00 AM (breakfast starts at 7:30), and a staff member opened the dining room, prepared coffee, toast, cereal, juice, and fruit for us. We loved the Roxford and enjoyed being out of the hubbub in the center of town. We found neighborhood restaurants within a few blocks for dinner. If I ever go back to Dublin, I'll be staying at the Roxford Lodge!",5,2009,08,24
222,Absolutely Lovely.  Incredible Staff.,"My husband and I returned from Dublin this morning.  We stayed at the Roxford for 3 nights.  We had a lovely stay.  The staff were fabulous.  They did everything they could to make our stay more comfortable.  We were close enough to walk most everywhere.  The rooms were quiet and plush, though a bit small.  I could have done without the sauna, which I didn't use, in exchange for a little more room.  The huge bathtub was nice.

Breakfast was very good.  We will Definitely be back.",5,2009,08,24
222,You're crazy if you stay anywhere else,"Great, great place to stay!! The room was amazing-jacuzzi, sauna, flat screen..etc. The location is nice but a little out of the way ( but many of the best hotels are in the same area- you pay for the walk with quiet ). Breakfast-superb! The owner- do you ever sleep??? She was there all the time and anything I asked for or wanted she was able to work out. Make sure you ask her about the grocery store and pubs around the corner, they are so much less than nearer town. For the price we paid and the luxury and service we had, you are crazy not to book here first!!!",5,2009,08,22
222,Delightful place to stay in Dublin,Roxford Lodge was an amazing experience. The room was exceptionally clean and spacious. Neighborhood is gorgeous. The walk to the City Center was pleasant. Breakfast was fantastic. The owner is a very sweet lady and made my granddaughter and me feel more like friends than hotel guests. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2009,07,28
222,Best Place to Stay in Dublin,"The Roxford Lodge Hotel is the perfect place to stay in Dublin. My husband, sister and I stayed there the weekend of the U2 Concert in Dublin.  Their website is extremely informative and up-to-date. For example, getting from the Airport couldn't have been easier. Their instructions to catch the Air Coach and take it to the Schoolhouse Hotel were perfect.  This boutique hotel welcomes us with a lovely tea service before we checked into our rooms. The staff is exceptionally friendly. The rooms were spotless and very luxurious. Considering the fact that we were there on one of the busiest weekends (U2), we were exceptionally pleased at the hotel's affordable rates. It is a gem of a find! And you will be happy you are away from the hectic Temple bar. A quick 10 minute bus ride (on the 4, 7, or 46 bus) will drop you off right in front of the hotel - literally.",5,2009,07,27
222,Terrific Hospitality in a great location!,"We stayed three nights at the Roxford.  The staff was always available and did not hesitate to ask if we needed anything.  The breakfast had the typical fixings that the other lodgings had, but they personally cooked whatever you liked for breakfast.  The location was also terrific for it was in a quiet area, but reasonable walking distance to all the locations.  One should note that not all the taxi drivers know of the Roxford, but all you have to say is that it is a block down from the Schoolhouse Inn.  If we return to Dublin, then we will certainly stay again.  They also have a sitting room with a computer, internet and printer.  It was very nice to be able to do planning for our later travels through Ireland in a comfortable and free setting - no internet cafe needed.",5,2009,07,21
222,absolutely fabulous,We were a party of 6 in two triple rooms. The place was enchanting. Thoughtfully equiped. And the service was brilliant especially at breakfast. More boutique hotel than luxury b&b. Thoroughly recommend it. Excellent value for money.,5,2009,06,30
222,Excellent--very good value too,"Six of us stayed for three nights at the Roxford in May, 2009.  It exceeded my expectations--the price was very reasonable and the Roxford was exceptionally nice.

This is a former house (??) that has been converted into a small inn.  Sitting room is very comfortable with computer access (high speed internet).

This is a very nice place but there are some things that I found unusual (but did not present any negatives):  sauna in the room; handicap bathrooms (but the bedroom was not accessable for wheelchairs)

Breakfast was good:  6 Euro continental (cold buffet).  We did not try the 15 E full Irish breakfast.

Hospitality was surprisingly good--we were usually offered tea/coffee when we came in.

Location--30 minute walk to Tourist Info (Suffolk St.).  Walk is nice and safe.  It looks closer on a map, but traffic is heavy and stop lights are frequent.  Roxford is across the canal in Ballsbridge.",5,2009,05,31
222,"Beautiful room, wonderful breakfast","The Roxford Lodge Hotel is very nice. We had a large room (115), great jacuzzi tub, sauna,  high ceilings, very nice flat screen TV.  The beds were very comfortable and have no negatives at all with the room.  The breakfast had a good variety and everything was served promptly and fresh.  The front desk personnel were always available and very helpful with any request. I would not hesitate to return.  It is a litle walk to the city center but is manageable (about six blocks).  The location is a safe area and we experienced no difficulties.",5,2009,05,15
222,Peaceful and comfortable,"We loved this place. I was a little wary after reading some negative reviews, but we found this place to be a good value in expensive Dublin. You definitely want to ask for a room in the back. While the view is of a parking lot and dumpster, it is very quiet in the rear of the building. The king bed was very comfortable -firm, but not hard, and the room we were in offered a variety of bed pillows. I usually travel with my own pillow because I hate being perched on top of monstrously huge ones, but I was able to find a pillow that worked----no mean feat. 
We also liked the sauna. We used it both nights we were there, and it was great. The bathroom was also clean and well-appointed, and I liked the jacuzzi tub.
The walk into town was about fifteen minutes, but it is a pleasant and safe walk and we were able to get to everything on foot. You need to take the bus to and from the airport. The bus drops you down the street in front of the ""schoolhouse inn"". Please tell your bus driver that stop-not the hotel stop. We were dropped blocks away and were rescued by a grad student who walked us all the way to the hotel. She was extremely kind and friendly, as are all the people we met in Dublin. 
All in all, t was a great visit and a peaceful retreat. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2009,04,19
222,"Wonderful stay, would definitely stay again.","Started our Ireland vacation with a stay at Roxford Lodge.  Had flown in overnight and arrived around 9:30am.  Room was not ready so we walked into town (about a 15 minute walk straight up the road).  When we returned around 12:30 the room was still not available but Agnes (probably feeling very sorry for our weary selves) upgraded us to the suite so we could get some rest.  The suite was spectacular-it had a balcony overlooking the alley in the back, a loft area with jacuzzi tub, a sauna, a kitchenette.  Coffee and tea was offered every time we walked through and the breakfast was great.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",5,2009,04,14
222,"This room had it all--sauna, jacuzzi tub, sound system, flatscreen TV","We had a really wonderful room with a sauna, jacuzzi tub, sound system, flat screen TV, etc.  We got a discount for getting a package without breakfast, however, the cost listed for breakfast was about $20/person, so it would have been cheaper without the package (if we wanted breakfast).  They delivered us tea to the room, with shortbread cookies, and that was a special treat.  The renovated old house had a never ending series of doors.  Not sure if they were for fire safety or privacy, but it was quiet.  Free parking was available in a lot accessed by an alley street behind the hotel.  It was about a 20 minute walk into the beginning of the touristy part of Dublin, so it made for a lot of walking.",5,2009,04,01
222,"Comfortable, clean, great location","The Roxford Lodge Hotel was a delightful find in Dublin.  Located a few blocks south of Trinity College and just a few yards from the bus from the airport, the hotel was easy to reach, central enough to downtown sights, yet still providing a neighborhood atmosphere.  The service was friendly and prompt -- our room wasn't not quite ready when we arrived at 11a.m. but was ready soon afterward.  

The room featured a very comfortable bed and a good sized bathroom.  The inroom sauna was an interesting feature, but we found it took up far too much space, particularly since we didn't make use of it during our stay.  We had a bit of trouble regulating hot water in the shower but that appeared to be due to some maintenance work being done in the hotel midday.  It worked well later that evening.

Breakfast was a traditional full Irish breakfast -- quite delicious and a good way to start a long day of sightseeing.",4,2009,02,25
222,Great hotel in great location,I cannot say more than the previous posters.  This hotel went above and beyond in every category.,5,2009,01,29
222,Loved the executive suite!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Roxford Lodge. When we arrived there, we were greeted my Agnes, who showed us to our room, which was more like an appartment! We stayed in the Executive suite, which had a kitchen i.e cooker, oven,fridge, microwave, washing machine. Up a few steps was our 4 poster bed, flat screen telly on the wall, Dvd player, Cd player with built surround sound speakers, sauna. Up the steps again was the jacuzzi- wow! Which also had another flat screen telly on the wall! And not to forgot across from the bed was a bar! Out through the patio door was a computer room and balcony! There was chocolates waiting for us in our room and then later we received a complimentary bottle of wine! Brekkie the next morning was also fab! We loved our stay here and can not wait to come back again! Staff are also very friendly and there is tea/coffee available free of charge all day!",5,2009,01,18
222,Enjoyed my stay,"Breakfast was excellent.  The room is ""interrsting"" with an infrared sauna box and LED fairy lights above the bed.  I tried the sauna, it was fun and worked well, but the room isn't really big enough for it.  The hotel is very easy to find from the airport bus stop (Ballsbridge Air Coach).  I would say this hotel is more of a B & B but still we enjoyed our stay and have no complaints.",4,2009,01,14
222,Excellent value and recommended,"1st time in Dublin, saw this hotel on Tripadvisor and saw that it was good value which does seem difficult to find in Dublin.
The room was clean and well presented, the staff were pleasant and helpful, the hotel is not in the centre of Dublin which is what we needed but only a short walk takes you to an area with great bars and restaurants (although expensive), I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay somewhere that is way above average but at a reasonable cost for this part of Ireland.",5,2008,11,29
222,Roxford Lodge rocks!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge, along with my parents (lucky him) from the 8th to 10th November 2008.

Having spent two nights in Bray (in an awful hotel) visiting relatives, we wanted to spend some time in Dublin before heading back to London and were not disappointed. The Roxford Lodge is full of character (and characters!), quirkiness and charm. Having travelled from Bray on the DART, we arrived at Lansdowne Road station and had to endure a 10 minute walk with luggage in pouring rain. However, we were warmly welcomed by Agnes (the owner) and offered tea and biscuits on arrival. We were shown through to the splendid resident's lounge and sat by the roaring fire to dry off. Admittedly the tea was a little slow to arrive, but why rush when you're on holiday?! The tea is not only free-flowing but free of charge and available at pretty much any time of the day.

Two pots of tea and copious amounts of biccies later, we were ready to be shown to our rooms, which Agnes did personally. I must say that the customer service provided by all staff throughout our short stay was excellent; they were friendly and only too willing to help - everything was ""no problem"". Agnes is certainly the hostess with the mostess!

The labyrinth of floors and corridors was a little confusing and the door access fairly tight - but made the adventure all the more fun! The infamous free-standing saunas in every room just add to the character and if you don't fancy using it, simply ignore it or use for storing shoes as I did as the wardrobe space is pretty minimal!

My boyfriend and I had a lovely double room, with wall-mounted plasma screen, jet-stream bath and a gorgeously comfy king-sized bed. The only teeny initial disappointment we had was discovering that the Roxford Lodge does not have a bar. You can, however, order drinks to your room or receive them in the lounge but be prepared to wait! We soon got over that though, as when you're in Dublin there are plenty of places to sup a pint!

My mum and dad's room was a little bizarre - their en suite took the form of a ""wet room"" complete with padded disabled toilet and shower - and they had a little twinkling star light display above their bed, but these details simply add to the quirkiness of the hotel.

Location-wise, as others have said, it's a 15 minute straight walk (turn right out of the hotel) and you hit Trinity College - but there are plenty of buses on route, with stops right outside the hotel on both sides of the road. Situated in an upmarket, leafy residential part of the city, we were happy to be slightly removed from the hustle, bustle and hen-nights in central Dublin of an evening. An elegant Victorian townhouse, it wouldn't have been out of place in down town New York, SATC style!

Breakfast is included in the rate and was simply amazing. Lovely home-made bread is on offer and freshly squeezed orange juice. I went for the traditional full Irish both mornings which included black pudding, white pudding (yum - don't care what it's made from), bacon, sausages, mushrooms, beans, tomatoes and eggs done whichever way you choose. The toast tasted divine. You can also have the (slightly healthier but just as huge) continental breakfast, or freestyle between the two - either option certainly set you up for the day!

My party of four - with ages ranging from 28 to 69 - all thoroughly enjoyed our stay. All rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable and offered extremely good value when compared to the rest of Dublin - which, like the rest of Ireland, is shockingly expensive. We were all sad to leave and agreed - without hesitation - that Agnes' hard work and welcoming charm made our stay so special and we'd certainly like to pay a return visit in the near future.",5,2008,11,21
222,Cannot wait to return,"I came here with my parents, it was our first stop in Ireland.  I had read about the hotel on trip advisor, but I was still a little nervous.  The hotel was incredible, the staff there was so nice, and it had just the right amount of quirkiness (ie; sauna in the middle of our bedroom).  We met lots of fun people in the lobby, and who doesn't love a hotel that brings you complimentary tea and chocolate biscuits.  The breakfast was fantastic, seriously I cannot say enough for the staff.  It was a great way to begin our trip around Ireland.  The location is good, right by many bus stops and walking distance to plenty of pubs.",5,2008,10,28
222,Good value,"Just back from 2 1/2 weeks in Ireland and many stays in B+B's. The Roxford Lodge was one of the better ones. Ireland - and especially Dublin - are very expensive, so Roxford was all in all, good value. It's not in the heart of downtown (a plus in our books), so be prepared for a walk to see the sights. It's really only 15 minutes to Trinity College, Temple Bar and the main shopping area - following one main road - so the walking was moderate. The host was friendly and accommodating. Tea - along with biscuits - was always available and served on a pretty tray in the lounge. The room was clean and adequate. The only odd thing was the sauna (others have mentioned this, too). While a source of pride for the owner, the sauna takes up a huge amount of space in a tiny room. As a sauna has never been on our list of ""must haves"" in a B+B, it just seemed a curious addition. There was no chest of drawers and only a miniscule closet to hang a few items, but the looming presence of the sauna was more a source of amusement than irritation. Breakfast was tasty and selection good.",4,2008,10,20
222,Posh & quirky too!,"This hotel was in a quiet residential neighbourhood in the most expensive, posh area of Dublin (according to the cab driver).  It's at the southeast corner of the city, at a walkable distance to get to the city centre (although about 20-30 mins from Temple Bar & everything north of the Liffey, etc.)  But it's really comfortable & quiet (you can actually sleep in if you want to without early morning breakfast & guest noise!)  I agree with another reviewer that you shouldn't automatically expect a room that looks all slick, modern & pretty as per the photos on the website.  I think we were in a not-yet-renovated room, so we had floor-to-ceiling wood paneling, a strange-looking stained glass ceiling over the bed (with light behind it no less!), and an entire wall of marble where the desk was.  Unlike some reviewers, my husband was thrilled with the in-room sauna.  Our favourite part was the complimentary tea (or coffee) that they bring to your room at any time of the day (up to 1am or something like that), complete with chocolate biscuits, which we found charmingly civilized at the end of a busy day of non-stop walking around the city.  And at E105-115/night, it was a great rate by Dublin standards (pls note breakfast costs extra).  Although we were there for our honeymoon, I think anyone (incl older travelers, groups of travelers, etc.) would like it.  We'd definitely stay there again.",5,2008,10,10
222,Great place to stay!,"A lovely area. Quiet and just a short bus ride to city (although is walkable!) or to the port. The staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were lovely and unlike some comments, we actually used our sauna and enjoyed it!! The staff gave us pots of tea and biscuits on request - none of which were charged for! The rooms were lovely and l would certainly use this hotel again when we next come to Dublin. Highly recommended for a comfortable and quiet place to stay. Excellent staff!",5,2008,10,07
222,Only OK,"This hotel is quiet and in a pretty part of Dublin, and its location on  bus routes 4 and 7 makes it convenient to access the heart of the city (about a 10-minute ride away).

However, don't be fooled by the photos on their website! It sounds like some of the rooms have been renovated; unfortunately we did not get to stay in one of those and instead had an extremely cramped, dated room with a strange wooden sauna in the corner.

I'm not sure what the deal was with breakfast; it appears to be available but it was never offered to us, either at the time of booking or when we checked in.

The attendants are friendly enough but service is a little slow - and if you are checking before 9 a.m., be sure to settle your bill the day before (we had to hunt someone down to check out and the delay almost made us miss our plane). Overall, it was OK but not outstanding.

Dublin is great, though; be sure to check out the Guinness Storehouse and take the DART out to Howth... and try the restaurants Gruel and Crush near Temple Bar.",3,2008,09,07
222,Great place to stay,"We stayed at the Roxford Lodge for 2 nights in August 2008. 
On arrival we were greeted by a friendly lady who  showed us to our rooms, which were very nice and clean. Our room was at the back and was very quiet,  even at the front the road outside does not seem very busy at night. The only strange thing was the rather bizarre-looking sauna in the corner of the room. But you can just ignore it, as we did. The breakfasts were superb, plentiful and tasty food, and efficient service. Also free tea and coffee, (with biscuits !) was available throughout the day, (why can't all hotels do that ?).  Another nice touch was the complimentary wine served after we mentioned it was our 20th Wedding Anniversary. 
The hotel is in a nice quiet area, some 20 minutes walk from St Stephens Green, with its many pubs and restaurants. From there you can also catch one of the many open-top tour buses which are great for getting to all the sites. Some have live commentary from drivers who put their own amusing slant on the script. (15 euros well-spent).  The St Stephens Green area seems to be thankfully off-limits for the stag/hen parties which  frequent Temple Bar and around O'Connell Street. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, it really seems to be a cut above the average if you don't mind being a little bit out from the centre.",5,2008,08,25
222,"Excellent service, very reasonably priced","I stayed for one night as I was visiting Dublin to go to a family wedding. I found the hotel staff very helpful and polite. I had asked beforehand to have early access to my room (checkout is at noon). I arrived at 11 and I was able to get into my room immediately (as I needed to change clothes before the wedding). I twice asked the staff to book me taxis which they did on both occasions very efficiently- there was no waiting around or nagging. The room was a little small but spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was very good and, again, service excellent. I felt the hotel gave very good value when compared to what some of the competition are charging!",5,2008,08,17
222,Great hotel walking distance to downtown,"Although we found the sauna in the room to be a little odd and took up valuable space in such a small room, we really enjoyed our stay.  Everything was extremely clean, the room was quiet, and the breakfast was very good.  A good value for a hotel so close to all of the sites downtown.",5,2008,08,02
222,Dirty and in need of refurbishment,"There are a flight of steps leading to the property so make sure you can carry your own bag, there is no-one to help you.  Check in was slow, we waited 20 mins for our coffee to be delivered to our room on arrival.  It was the consistency of sludge so we walked the 20 mins into town to find something drinkable.

We had booked a triple room with a single and double bed.  It was overfurnished with a table and chairs, vanity table/chair and one of the weird wooden tardis saunas that so many previous reviewers have complained about.  The room was FILTHY!  There were brown stains on the walls, I dread to think what they were.  The light fixture above the single bed was broken in half, hanging down, with no bulb.  We didn't touch it in case it was live.  The bedding was awful, all torn and stained.  I wouldn't have used it to wipe my car down with.  Ugh.  The view was of a skip and parked cars.  
Oddly enough the bathroom was cleaner that the bedroom, perhaps because it is easier to clean tiles than repaint a wall.  Just as well as after sleeping in that bedroom you really want a shower to feel clean again!
On a brighter note the Irish breakfast was nice, the only saving grace of the establishment.  
Would I stay again?  NO! Not unless they overhauled the property with a complete refurbishment and got commercial cleaners in.",2,2008,07,24
222,Felt like a fancy hotel,"My two sisters and I stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for three nights in June. We found it online after looking at many other properties in Dublin that were either very expensive or in a noisy bar district or booked far ahead of time. We were thrilled with our choice! The lovely receptionists were very easy to coordinate with over the internet and happily worked with us to change our reservation as well as give us information about transportation and tours. The room was on the smaller side (about normal for the European rooms I've stayed in) but VERY nice and updated. We enjoyed the very comfortable linens, two TVs, jacuzzi tub, and sauna right in our room.  The hotel was very quiet and an easy 20 minute walk outside of the city center.  There was reliable internet access in the lobby and breakfast was really fantastic (we recommend the full Irish!). Thanks to the friendly staff for a lovely stay!",5,2008,07,04
222,"They Can Fit You In Here, Literally at a Squeeze.","You know when you read a number of good reports about a hotel then there’s a whingeing one in the middle? – Well here goes:

Currently in the process of a remodel leaves the rooms at the rear with a view of a skip.  The redesign criteria is clearly based  on a target of room numbers, leaving a hotchpotch of corridors and doors in awkward places that make getting bags in and out quit comical – at first anyway.  The room we had was too small with too much furniture, and best suited to one person.  Unusually, in the corner of the room is a wooden box - a sauna.  We moved the tiny, useless sofa to the door to give a little more space.  The rooms are being finished in contemporary design with too much light from down lighters.  The fit and finish of all the fixtures is very poor.  The plumbing is noisy.  The wardrobe is so small as to be near useless.  There is a clearly marked tap for drinking water and a useful fridge.  The wall socket for internet access didn’t work and couldn’t be fixed, there is a fax machine gathering dust in the corner of the room .  The location, just south of the city, is very good for local restaurants and on a main bus route to the city centre.  Lansdowne Road station is 10min walk to get the Dart Train into the city centre.  Secure parking at the rear and an excellent breakfast don’t redeem an otherwise poor show.",2,2008,05,29
222,Lovely friendly hotel,"We are tow old friends who meet up every 2 years and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. On arrival we were offered complementary tea/coffee which was brought to our room within minutes. Biscuits were a nice touch. Breakfast was plentiful and we cannot fault the service. We stayed in a ground floor room at the back of the hotel with sauna and jacuzzi bath! Little tight for space as result of the sauna which we did not use but still it was a lovely clean and bright room.
Easy walk to the city centre (10-15 mins). We bought a 24 hour hop on hop off bus ticket from the Green bus co which takes you to all the sights. They have live commentary which is hilarious, every driver has a different story to tell and some sing along the way! Well worth the 12 Euros.
We got the train from Connelly Station to Howth which was great, train arrives along the harbour and it is a 5 min walk to the harbour itself. Great Dublin Bay prawns to be had which are delicious. Nothing like the prawns we are used to. You can buy sardines from the fresh fish shops and feed the seals which are very friendly.
In all a great break, highly recommended hotel and very friendly people.
June and Linda",5,2008,05,24
222,lived up to its reputation,"This very nice hotel lived up to its fine reputation.  We arrived mid morning after an overnight flight from JFK and the woman at the desk was friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't ready, but she served us coffee in the sitting room while we waited.  The location is fine - a 15 minute walk into the center of the city, or the bus stops right outside the door (which is great when returning late at night - although be forewarned - the last bus is at 11:30.  Our room was quiet, comfortable and nicely furnished.  Internet access is provided free.  Tea served whenever you would like it, and the breakfasts were wonderful.   I highly recommend this as a very nice, but reasonably priced place to say in Dublin!",4,2008,04,30
222,Great Stay,"Stayed at the Roxford for two nights and loved it.  We were lucky enough to be the first individuals to stay in a newly renovated room.  Room was nicely appointed with flat screen tv and sauna ensuite!  The jacuzzi tub was also a nice touch.  

Free car parking in the back of the hotel was also useful.  About a 15 - 20 minute walk to Temple Bar/Trinity area.  Hotel is located in a nice area with a handful of restaurants a 5 - 10 minute walk away. 

Reception was friendly and assisted with all our requests.  They also provided tea upon checking in which was a nice touch.  

Will stay here again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2008,04,23
222,Excellent hotel,"We stayed in the Rochford Lodge hotel for one night recently. In comparsion to some of the bigger hotels, this one was very reasonably priced and going by the previous reviews on this website, we decided to stay here. 100% glad we picked this hotel, we got a nice quiet room at the back of the hotel with two flat screen tvs, ensuite with bubble bath, sauna, tea/coffee facilities, broadband internet access etc. Very impressed, definitely the best hotel I've stayed in in Dublin. Head and shoulders above the rest of them. The fry the next morning was delicious and the service for the stay was second to none. Plenty of fresh fruit / cereal / juices and morning papers to compliment the fryup too! Secure carparking out the back also.",5,2008,03,03
222,This hotel is a MUST STAY for local Irish people as well as Visitors,"Fabulous hidden gem in convenient ""posh"" location a short distance from Dublin City centre/business/shopping/nightlife/etc.

Attention to detail befits a 5* hotel but there is no way you would get the special attention; the welcome and Breakfast at a 5* hotel...this has it all without the spa, fussy impersonal staff or the ""sir/madam"" routine!  You can even get secure FREE parking - no first come first served nonsense!  

Your every need will be seen to if possible.  Fresh Tea/coffee .. to your room if you wish.  Don't expect a noisy bar with dried up food always on tap.  It's a 5* upgraded guest house with personal attention; beautiful decor and you don't have to use the sauna if you don't want to...but why not pamper yourself when you get the chance without having to pay a fortune in a trumped-up leisure facility!

Don't tell anyone else about this...there might be no room for you if they find out!!!",5,2007,12,17
222,Lovely Art Deco style Bed and Breakfast.,We arrived and were  upgraded to a suite of rooms.,5,2007,10,28
222,Great Location - Smaill but Clean Updated room,"The location is a 15 minute walk from the very heart of Dublin.  The staff (Stephanie et al) were very very helpful and accomodating.  We travelled with friends who had a much inferior room to our own, so you need to ask for one of the updated rooms.  

The breakfast was wonderful, and the hospitality tea or coffee was always available.  Although we didn't have dinner there, the menu seemed very pricey compared to the great meals we had on Temple Bar, so we chose to take our meals out.  Hence, I am not able to comment on the meals.  The neighborhood was relatively quiet and made a very nice ""home base"" for discovering the beautiful gem of Dublin.",5,2007,10,22
222,great hotel...very nice people--huzzah!!,"what a gem of a hotel in dublin...and sucha lovely neighborhood.  this hotel was a short 15 minute walk to city center....the walk takes one over the canal...many great sites along the way.  if you cannot make the walk--the number 7 bus stops right in front of the hotel...you cant beat that!!  

the folks running the hotel are lovely people.  they could not have been better to work with.  

take rick steves advice and stay here.  you really haveta be a great place to make it into a rick steves book.  cool beans!!

we got a wonderful rate as there were 3 of us...so with it being ""off"" season...we got a full irish breakfast as well as a very nice room with three beds for 50 euros a piece.  after our stay in london...this was an amazing deal.

if i knew how to post photos i have great ones of this hotel.  not hip enough with the internet...figures... any way....enjoy your stay in dublin with the roxford lodge as a base.",5,2007,10,18
222,Variable quality rooms,"Quality of your stay depends upon the room you receive.  Initially, we had an upstairs room that was 'tiny', overlooking the main road, (Northumberland).  The room was hot, and we could not open the window secondary to road noise. Our friends that we were travelling with were give a downstairs room, much larger, quieter and cooler.   We expressed our desire for the same, and we were moved to a much nicer downstairs room after one night, and had a much larger sized room, which was much quieter, and cooler.

The breakfasts are great, and the staff helpful.  Location to town is an easy walk.  

Overall, a nice hotel, in a nice location.  Make sure you ask for one of the larger rooms, on the 'quiet side' of the hotel, so you can open your window!",4,2007,10,13
222,Would recommend,"Stayed here many times for business and pleasure. Very reasonably priced hotel with comfortable room, nice breakfast and ample parking.

Location is good 15 mins walk into town centre or very near Ballsbridge - some nice restaurants and bars there - would recommend.",4,2007,10,12
222,Location/ price make it great!,"Great value for money on the edge of town. It’s a good 20 minute walk to the green/ centre, but regular bus service also available.

Rooms very comfortable – Executive Suite is a real treat (jacuzzi) for a special occasion.

Breakfast was excellent.

Welcome is warm – the staff are nicely discrete, but always ready and able to help.
",4,2007,09,19
222,overall very positive experience,"In late August, my husband and I shared a room for 2 nights, and a friend traveling with us had another.   Like other reviewers, we all found the sauna quite strange; that I used it for my luggage storage/dressing room is an indication of its utility and the small room size.  However, the rooms are all undergoing renovation, so this problem should be resolved soon.    The bathroom was very clearn and new, the bed was comfortable with good lighting for reading (by no means universal in European hotels).  

The staff was lovely and helpful at every opportunity, the breakfast was very good, and the location is convenient to the city center and to getting out of town.  Having a car park is also  convenient and a little unusual.     We enjoyed sitting in the lounge chatting with other guests.  We liked having the computer available.  

From the prices we saw when researching Dublin hotels and B & Bs, Roxford Lodge seems to be a good value.  We would stay there again without hesitation.

222,Excellent - Roxford Lodge,"We stopped in the Roxford Lodge for a short break in Dublin for 3 nights in late August.

I booked the hotel after reading the reviews on TA, and when I booked Roxford was ranked 3 in the whole of Dublin, But now its seems to be lower (11ish I think).

We found the hotel to be perfect in every way, the room was beautiful with everything we could ever ask for, and the staffs were amazing, nothing was too much trouble, and they helped us with recommending places to eat and go. 

The location of the hotel is about 10 minute walk to trinity college, and we found this to be a nice walk, on the Sunday you walk past a park where local people are displaying there paintings (well worth the walk in the sun)

All in all we found it to be amazing, and I would highly recommend the Roxford and Dublin for a city break – we will be back!

222,Brilliant Staff.,"My husband and myself stayed in this hotel recently. We were in Dublin attending a Damien Rice concert in Marlay Park. Like other contributors on this website I found the presence of a sauna totally unecessary in the room. However in general I found this accommodation to be comfortable, safe and central. The bathroom was a bit of a problem, the water from the shower sprayed out on to the floor and drowned the place. The hotel itself is on Northumberland Road and one can walk from it to the Trinity College/Grafton Street area in approximately ten to fifteen minutes. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was lovely, more than enough food and tea/coffee. We would stay in this hotel again.

222,Roxford Lodge Resonablely Priced Gem in Dublin,"While the hotel rooms were small, they were clean and comfortable.   Having a sauna and whirlpool tub available after a marathon day of walking, touring, walking, etc. was wonderful.

The hotel staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.   We had locked ourselves out of the room one night, not only did they get  us into our room, but gave us lovely large cups of hot chocolate.

We would definately stay here again.   Ballsbridge is a great place to stay,  a little less frenetic than other areas of Dublin.

222,what we expected in Dublin,"Our first stop in Ireland was the Roxford.  Very nice hosts! Our room was adequate in size.  Yes, there was a sauna in the room, but what did we care.  For 4 people, we had plenty of room.  Half our luggage arrived late and the hosts were gracious enough to not only help us track it down, but put it in our room.  Service was great!  

The location was down below the museums and bustle of the tourist area.  We walked a few times into the center,  but found it very easy to catch the bus across the street to take us close enough to where we needed to be.  

The restuarants around us were not what we were looking for.  Priced for the business traveler not the family of four.  So, we hopped  on that bus and went into town.  

Dublin is overall more expensive than any where we traveled in Ireland. If you accept this, you will appreciate all that you are getting for your money.  

Yes, we would stay there again.

One photo we attached was a great dinner (touristy menu, but very good food!)

222,Give this one a miss,"Stayed in this hotel at the beginning of August. The hotel is not what as described on the numerous websites it is advertised on.

First of all the rooms are not what i call 'luxury' they are quite dated and bcause of this look a little dirty.

We did not have a Jucuzzi bath, instead a shower which made the bathroom into a 'wet room' so for the rest of the day everytime I went into the bathrom the bottom of my trousers would get soaking wet.

The hotel is a good 25 minute walk from the Temple Bar/O'Connell area.

There was no chocolates, wine etc on arrival.

On a positive note:
The breaksfast was superb
The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much problem for them.

The hotel is in a good location if you wanted to go to the Shelbourne Park greyhound stadium, only a 10 minute walk - we had a great night there.

Over all this hotel should be described as a guesthouse - not a a luxury hotel. It is way overpriced.

222,Sweet and charming hotel in a lovely neighbourhood,"Me and my son (15) stayed at Roxford Lodge from July 17th to July 21th.  We booked it because of the nice reviews on TA.  And I really understand both people just loving it, and people that cannot understand their style. Because it was a great mixture of styles, but for me that was exactly what made it so absolutely cute and charming. Our room was spacious, and included both sauna and jacussi (which we didn't use. )

The beds were quite comfy, the breakfast really great, and the staff and the owner were just as nice, polite and friendly as others describe here. They were always offering tea or coffe, and even brought it to our room, on a nice ""silver""-tray.

The room and bathroom was very clean, with clean towels everyday. There was plent y of water, but we had a bit problems with making the water leaving the wahsbasin, it was taking it's time, and we had to wait very long between each time we could flush the toilet, and for me that's the only negative remarks on this hotel.  
But if you are expecting luxury, this is not the right hotel anyway, a fact most people probably already have understood because of the price. I think we really received very much for our money, paying 120 euro/night.

We found the location great, so nice an quiet and so many beautiful houses and gardens around. And all people we met were so friendly. 
The citybusses passed the hotel all time, and it was not a very long walk to the citycenter either.  
One night at 01.00 am we took a taxi home after having waited for the launch of the last Harry Potter book at Waterstones in Dawson street, and we paid 6 euro, cheap I would say.
Another night we ate at the Miller Pizza Restaurant in Upper Baggot Road (I think) quite near the hotel. It was just an experience which we heartly reccomend, but you have to make a table reservation, cause the place is really popular.
All in all we found Dublin a really nice city, and Roxford Lodge a perfect place to stay
",4,2007,07,26
222,Gem of a hotel!,"Loved the place.  We stayed in the 2nd floor room that looks out to the street in front of the hotel.  Great view - not noisy!  The staff were great - very friendly and attentive.  They bring tea and cookies whenever you need, were very helpful with directions and dinner reservations!  The secure parking was free, which was nice.  There is a bus stop directly out front which made it nice to bus home after exploring Dublin for the day.  The room was comfortable and charming.  
Internet access was 10 euro per day, which seemed a bit expensive, but at least they offered the service.  Breakfast was tasty!  We ate dinner at Roly's bistro a few blocks away and enjoyed a great meal there one night, and at one of the local pubs the other night.

222,Roxford Lodge Very Nice Place INDEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My favourite town is Dublin. I was here three times before, but this place was far the best so far. It is in Ballbridge, which is a very beautiful area of Dublin with nice houses, hotels and ambassies. TGhe building is vety nice, immacuteley spotless. It is very safe. We had a warm welcome, with tea, coffe a cookis, no extra charges. The rooms are weel equipped, with jacussi and sauna and so on. The lounge is frendly, the breakfast room is nice, clear. By the way, the full irish breakfast  can turn You up for the whole day. Alltogether it is not dump, it is nap B&B. It is nice, little hotel, with helpful and smart staff. The location is perfect. So Can I recommend Roxford Lodge??? Absoluteley!!!!!!!!!

222,Mixed review,"I have a very mixed review for the Roxford Lodge, and can absolutely see what both positive and negative reviewers have had to say about it.  My husband and I booked this B&B after researching this website, and we spent six nights there.

The building is impeccably clean, as was our room and bathroom.  Breakfast was wonderful, maybe the best we've had in Europe, with plenty of fresh fruit and cereals for those who choose not to eat the more substantive egg breakfast.  The breakfast room was extremely small though, and did not accommodate all guests at the same time, so that could be an inconvenience when visitors are on a specific time frame or schedule.

It is also very convenient if you rent a car, as the parking lot is secure, and free!  The parking lot is also, however, very small and tucked in a narrow alleyway, and fills up easily, so if you are unaccustomed to driving the British/Irish way, that can make for a lot of difficult maneuvering getting in and out (believe me!).

For the staff itself, I have mixed reviews.  They were efficient, and one or two were rather friendly, but they weren't as warm or as willing to go out of their way for guests as I would have expected after reading reviews on this site.  We were indeed offered cookies, etc. upon arrival, almost every  time, but that seemed more routine than anything else.  It was fine since we did not require much help, but it was still noticeable.

Perhaps my biggest complaint has to do with the location, and the room itself.  Location: it was not bad at all for getting to the Dublin city center, once you understand that you need to walk a good 20 minutes (we are both moderately fit and able to walk quickly and easily) or take a bus.  This made dining something of a problem.  There was no option to just step out of the hotel and find a place for dinner (except for the one pub around the corner) or even buy a bottle of water.  Given how rainy a city Dublin can be, this really became a bother after the first day.  On the positive side, it did help to be a bit far from the city center, because it was a lot easier to get on some of the freeways or major roads when we took day trips.

The room: Well, I just don't get the sauna in each room either.  It didn't make any sense to me or my husband, and it took up so much room!  It made the room rather small, and the decor--as another reviewer mentioned--was bizarre.  A sauna and bizarre decoration in each room does not equal luxury accommodation in my book, unfortunately!  Besides that, the bed was extremely uncomfortable, and the room was rather cold with no option for turning on the heater.  There was some painting and remodeling work going on outside the building, which made for very loud mornings and afternoons, and we didn't even spend much time there.

So, it was an adequate stay in a very clean B&B outside the city with certain conveniences and a very good breakfast.  No major complaints, no major disasters.  But I also find myself unable to rave about this place the way others have, and probably have to agree that it should not be ranked in the top 10 places to stay in Dublin.

We did, however, love Ireland, and thoroughly enjoyed our week there, what a beautiful and fun country!
",3,2007,07,17
222,Good B&B,"I stayed with my girlfriend at the Roxford Lodge in May for her birthday weekend.

The Roxford is essentially a B&B/Hotel situated just on the outskirts of Dublin - probably a 15 minute walk to the centre.  We booked it on the basis of price and the reviews on Trip Advisor.

This is not a 5-star hotel, but is a clean, well presented B&B/hotel, which seems to be good value for money in comparison to the other options at this price.  We had a room with a small sauna and a Jacuzzi bath, but didn't really use either.

The breakfast was excellent and the whole hotel was spotless.  I would consider staying again, but might try to find somewhere a bit close to the centre - as we prefer to be a short stroll from everywhere.
",4,2007,07,17
222,"Very nice, and surprisingly quiet","My inlaws and my  husband and I stayed here our first night in Dublin. The location was close to town and had a secure car park for our rental. Breakfast was lovely and the porridge was fantastic! Our room was quite small, and with our two large suitcases (two week trip) it was tight maneuvering around to the sauna. The jacuzzi in the bath was delightful after trekking a lot of miles in the UK the previous days. Our hostess was warm and helpful in getting us a cab to our restaurant and also met a few people from Scotland in the parlor. It was clean, had drinking-friendly tap water (otherwise icky), and internet connection. We'd stay there again!
",4,2007,07,16
222,Wonderful Dublin Experience,"This was our first stop in Ireland and we weren't disappointed. We had six people and took two rooms (115, the handicapped equipped room, and 118). 115 had a double and two twin beds. 118 was a double bed.  Both rooms had jacuzzis and saunas. The rooms were clean, comfortable and blessedly quiet. The breakfasts were excellent. But the best part was the service. You can ask for tea any time of the day or night.  We had an overnight flight and arrived at 9:30 am, expecting to have to leave our luggage and walk around the town until our rooms were ready in the afternoon. Instead, we were warmly greeted by Agnes with tea, cookies, toast, jam, cream etc. They had us in the rooms by 10:15. Roxford is in Ballsbridge, a nice, quiet, tree-lined area of Georgian buildings. It's about a 10 minute walk to Trinity College, 15 minutes from Grafton Street, and if you don't want to walk there's a bus stop right in front of the hotel. The DART is one block down and two blocks over (a five minute walk). On the day we left we had a flat tire (and the spare was flat as well). We had already checked out, but Agnes helped us get hold of the Auto Club to get the tire fixed. Altogether a great experience.

222,Not Much Good To Report About  THE ROXFORD!!!!,"WE ENCOUNTERED THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS DURING OUR RECENT STAY OF TWO DAYS/NIGHTS:
  1. Very tiny room.
  2. Toilet broken
  3. Upon arrival we failed to receive: (as per your letter)
         bottle of wine
         fresh flowers
         box of chocolates
  4. Loud continous music from adjoining room on the second 
       night.

222,I don't get it,"I don't see what people are raving about.  This is a dumpy little B&B not far from the center of Dublin, but really!, the fourth best place to stay in the entire city?  Our room was dark and claustrophobic and the combination portable sauna/radio (I'm not joking) took up at least 1/4 of the available floor space.  I don't usually take much notice of the decor in a hotel room but this place was so bizarrely decorated even I was amazed.  Instead of being ""a short stroll"" from the center of Dublin, it was a 20-minute brisk walk along a very busy road.

On the positive side, the breakfast was substantial and, if you are driving a car, the free parking makes this place really economical.

We wanted a place that we could easily retreat to after a couple of hours of museum-going, walking, shopping, whatever, so we checked out after one night and moved to the Westbury.  It was 2.5 times as expensive as the Roxford but, in my opinion, well worth it.
",3,2007,06,24
222,Who are you really?,"The Roxford does not know what it wants to be?  To support its claim that it is a ""luxury"" accommodation, our room had an enormous sauna that took up 60% of the living space.  So, you could take a sauna or open your luggage.  Guess which one we chose?  There are also Jacuzzi bathtubs that make for a life threatening climb in to the bath.  With all this luxury they forgot to ventilate the bathroom.  So, there is the added effect of an unwanted steam room.  On the other hand, it looks like a bed and breakfast. Sadly, it lacks the helpfulness and charm of a friendly staff (with the exception of one lovely desk clerk) and has no hospitality to speak of. We arrived at 10:45am after flying all night from New York . Despite being told in advance that we could have breakfast even if we were not able to check in, we were rudely informed that he kitchen closed at ""half ten"" and the city center was a 15 minute walk.  Not exactly the charming hospitality of some of the less expensive but more cordial B&Bs.  So, what does the Roxford want to be?  A luxury accommodation or a B&B?  Now it fails at both.  We checked into the Westin for the second night.  It is a luxury accommodation with no false pretenses.  Skip the Roxford.

222,Great Find,"Just returned. Great find in a expensive city. 
Everything promised on the web site was delivered..and then some. Wonderful room with sauna and jacuzzi, comfortable bed and lovely amenities...felt like home. 
Great selections for breakfast at your pace in a very pleasant setting. 
Tourists better book early as we met many business travelers at breakfast. They know a good value!
Agnes is a joy,  with her warm and friendly personality, sparkle in her eye and more than willing to recommend restaurants, etc.
Pleasant walk to the city centre via beautiful neighborhoods and parks.
Wonderful experience...highly recommended.

222,A Pleasant Hotel!,"The hotel was warm and welcoming on arrival, although the room wasn't ready (our fault because we forgot to check) However the receptionist made us feel very relaxed with tea, coffee and biscuits. The room was lovely, modern and airy and felt very clean as we entered. The sauna was a great touch and even better being free! We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as it was a little dear but the breakfasts were very good and would definitely get you through till lunch time - both continental and cooked (although it was an either or choice). The hotel was around a ten minute walk from the city centre and there is a bus stop outside so it's perfect if you don't want to be in the thick of the city. If we went back to Dublin we would definitely visit this hotel again.!

222,Lap of luxury...,"I have just come back from 3 amazing days in Dublin. We booked the Roxford Lodge Hotel after reading the great reviews on here and we were not disappointed! I booked the hotel over the phone to make sure we’d get a room with 3 beds in it rather than the double and one single most other hotels offered. 

We got to the hotel and were escorted to the Executive suite and our jaws dropped when we saw the room. It had a 4 poster bed, 2 single beds, balcony, kitchen, office, plasma screen TV and best of all a Jacuzzi and steam room! We spent a lot of time in the room rather than trawling the city in the rain as we would usually have done! 

If you’re coming to Dublin then I recommend you stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel – it’s great value and in an ideal location – close enough to the city without the madness of places like Temple bar. The hotel is also close to the Shelbourne Park greyhound races where we had a wonderful evening  winning and loosing our Euros. We'll definitely be going back again.

222,Great Hotel,"Our family recently stayed at the Roxford Lodge Hotel for three nights.  Four adults (2parents,2college students) stayed in the family quad room.  Our accommidations were great.  Nice large room with 2 twins and a double bed, large bathroom with with tub and even a sauna (which we did not use). A full Irish breakfast was included each morning which was very good.  I booked this room online after some  e-mails with Stepanie at the hotel.  Upon our arrival we were greeted and given coffee, tea and cookies to snack on while our room was being completed. The walk to town central (i.e. Trinity College ) was straight down the road aproximately 15-20 minute walk.  There is a bus stop right outside the hotel door,but we walked each day.  I would advise having a good city map as the names of the streets in Dublin change frequently!!!
Dublin is a great city to explore on foot..lots to do in a easily walkable area.  We did take a city bus tour to Guinness and Jameson....that does help you get your orientation about the city.
We used a taxi service to and from the airport ...very nice and helpful cabbies!!  Dublin can be an expensive city to stay in , but our room at the Roxford was wonderful and not so pricey!!! I highly recommend it.  Do visit the Dublin tourist center in town.  It is full of helpful info and free city maps...has to be on of the nicest tourist centers I have seen.

222,Fantastic,"It took us a long time to decide where to sleep in Dublin: too many difficulties, too many differences in the small group of friends. it was six of us, two single men in their old thirties, my husband and I, his father, and our gorgeous 10-months baby. 
We took our time to read carefully through your reviews, could not be wrong this time with small Ginevra at her first trip abroad!
Absolutely fantastic.. could not have chosen a better place to stay. Very quiet at night since far enough from Temple Bar, very good location to walk to the centre, restaurants and pubs since near enough to Trinity College (20 mins on foot), very easy to move from and to, since the bus stop just in front of the hotel, very very clean as I've never seen around the world (lounge, kitchen, rooms, stairs, windows).
Best of all, people are nice as never ever expected, helped us a lot with our baby (by the way, supplied the biggest cot I've ever seen - thank you she was delighted), showed us what we needed, from where-to-find water to how-to-get to Malahide, always with that incredible smile (Ms Stephanie, thank-you we all remember you with love). I cannot tell you all what they did for us,  just have not enough space! But trust, you won't be disappointed.
What more.. breakfast is great, with the same fantastic kindness we were asked to chose from full Irish and other delicious dishes. No worries.. chose whatever, everything is fresh, well-cooked, nice and... it's a lot!
Definitely a place that we recommend and where would stay again!

222,4 Nights in May 07,"At first glance I was alittle disappointed but all that went away. The rooms are small but you don't spend much time in them. I would definitely recommend this B & B and Agnes is wonderful!! Here are the pros and cons:
Pros
-Quite location with bus right outside your door & 10 min from city center
-Rooms are clean and cozy
-Hospitality is like being at Grandma's house
-Full breakfast and you order whatever you want
-Jacuzzi bath and sauna are great
-Walking distance to Jury's to catch all tour buses
-We came home late one night and Agnes even made us a midnight snack. We also left very early one morning for a tour and Agnes opened the kitchen and said to help ourselves. Where else are you going to find that?

Cons
-Bring washcloth
-Beds are a bit hard but not horrible
-Pillows rather flat
-You can hear neighbor if their TV is loud, but everyone seemed very respectful of each other
-There are other hotels at a lower price but considering the pros, it's worth it

We enjoyed our stay!!

222,Great place to stay,"We booked a three night stay at the Roxford Lodge after reading the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Now that we've visited we can only agree with everything we read.
The hotel is clean, the sauna and jacuzzi are nice touches and the people really are very friendly. We were asked if we wanted coffee and biscuits every time we returned to the hotel.
Getting to the hotel is easy enough. The AirCoach stops just down the road.
You'll probably want to catch the bus to get into the city and back but that's not much of a problem as the bus stop is right outside.
We bought a three day rambler ticket which allows you unlimited travel for 10 Euros each. You can get these from the bus depot or quite a few newsagents.
Hope you enjoy it as much as we did !!!

222,A Very Good Small Hotel,"A city centre hotel for one night.... always a risk. Just for once I have a glowing experience for one.

The Roxford Lodge is obscured by a bus sign at the front and the car park at the back is not easy to find but once you overcome these minor matters then it's all good news. Reception was friendly and made us coffee and gave us chocolate biscuits whilst they finished the rooms (we did arrive at noon....).

The rooms were clean, spacious, well equipped and everything worked. What more could you ask for? And I slept the whole night in a very comfortable bed.

Breakfast was reasonable and if only the price was a bit more sensible then it would have got 5 stars. 

Although about 15-20 minute walk from Temple Bar I would recommend it to anyone going for a short stay in Dublin.

222,Roxford stay,"Roxford Lodge is a good value and farily close the the city center.  Staff is great, rooms were very nice and clean.  Both my sons loved the saunas. Quiet area of the city. Great restaurant down the street--Rolys Bistro.  Good Pub around the corner--Beggars Bush, large patio and the host Michael is great.  Bus service to the airport is easy, right down the block.  I would contact the hotel directly to book as I found out I could have recieved a better rate.

222,Great Stay!,"Just came back from a stay at the Roxford Lodge and I was very impressed. The AirCoach stops at the SchoolHouse Hotel a block away and there is a bus stop right outside the door. The hotel is about a 20-25 minute minute walk into the town center. The rooms are very clean, but I could do without the sauna. Breakfast in the morning was
delicious. Most importantly, the staff was extremely helpful and courteous.  

If you're looking for a place close to the action with a modern touches, then this isn't the place for you. If you would like a quiet, pleasant get away, then the RoxfordLodge is PERFECT! My husband and I are will definitely being staying there again.",5,2007,04,06
222,Great hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel for a reasonable price.  I think we payed around $150 for a triple room.  Our room had one double bed and two twin beds.

The room was very large and unique.  They crown moldings were intricate and looked original to the propery.  Our room had double doors, so it was extremely quiet.  The bathroom was enourmous and had a jacuzzi tub.  We also had a small sauna in the room, but we were too busy exploring Dublin to try it.

The staff were very friendly.  They offered us cookies and coffee/tea every time we entered the hotel.  When I didn't feel like drinking coffee or tea, I asked for orange juice and they brought it without a problem.  The breakfast (included in the price) was OK and kept me feeling full for a few hours.

This hotel is very accomodating.  When I called to reserve the room, I told them we would be arriving at 10am and asked if we could store our bags until check in time.  To my surprise, the woman told me that there was no set check out time and our room would be ready by 10am!  True to her word, we arrived around 10am and our room was ready for us!  After a long flight, we really appreciated this.

The Roxford Lodge is more like a B&B than a hotel.  I recommend it to everyone.

222,Another fan of the Roxford,"You really can't find a better place than this - lovely staff, incredible food and the best hotel room I've stayed in for years. We are a family of four who were easily accommodated by the incredible executive suite - an oasis with a four-person sauna, jacuzzi tub, two TVs, in-room business center (free), full kitchen, wonderful beds - the list goes on and on. The kids never wanted to leave the room!  Staff were as kind and helpful as could be and the breakfast was absolutely spectacular. The location was great for us, as it was easily accessible to central Dublin by several buses or walking, but enough out of town to be extremely quiet. Airport coach stop just a block away. Dublin is a great town - I'd like to see in the summer, as we were there in January and it was awfully cold! - but the Roxford Lodge kept us warm, fed and supremely comfortable.

222,"Fabulous Hotel, Perfect Location","This is a wonderful hotel only 10mins stroll from Stephens Green.  The staff are very efficient and friendly.  Even when I rang to book, they didn't have a room, but after chatting to the lady, she managed to jiggle a few things and we got a lovely room.  Yes, the previous reviews which say the rooms have a sauna and jacuzzi bath are true.  When I arrived, I was brought coffee and some biscuits (complimentary).  It is the little touches like this that make the place special.  The cost is also a factor!  It was €120 for a double room, bed and breakfast.  Only minor fault would be the breakfast.  Compared with the standard of everything else it is nothing great.  Mind you it would not be enough to stop me raving about the place.  If you want somewhere nice to stay in Dublin - Stay in Roxford Lodge Hotel!!!

222,Couldn't ask for more,"Hi, just arrived back from a superb stay at the Roxford Lodge. It was my wifes 40th birthday, which we happened to mention to the very polite receptionist, and before we knew it we had been upgraded to the executive suite for the second night of our two night stay. It was probably the best hotel room we have stayed in and they only charged us the price of a regular room. It had a fully integrated kitchen with all appliances,  a bathroom, a very comfortable four poster bed looking onto a large flat screen tv, a separate dining area, a study with a  broadband computer and printer, a balcony overlooking Dublin, a huge steam room/ sauna and a large open plan area overlooking the room comprising a two person jaccuzzi and another flat screen tv. We have been to so many faceless , unfeeling hotels but this was different. Situated in a very affluent residential area of Dublin, it was a nice 20 minute walk to Grafton Street and Temple Bar, and we took in the National Gallery on the way (free entry, some good exhibits) and the Natural History Museum which is the next door along (free entry again but we didnt go in), then we strolled through St Stephens Green before the hustle and bustle of a very Christmas focussed Grafton Street. Then back to the hotel, and another welcome offer of  free tea and biscuits in the room. Thoroughly recommend this hotel, the staff, the rooms, the location and the price are probably unbeatable in this area of Dublin.

222,Exellent hotel,"Booked this hotel based on the reviews on here and not dissapointed. Walking distance to Grafton St ect, there is a bus stop in front of the hotel, or use the Dublin tour bus, get on/off at stop 5 and you are a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. Rooms are spacious and well maintained with large well equiped bathrooms, with the novelty of the small sauna as others have mentioned. It was our wedding anniversary during our stay and the owner upgraded us to the executive suite for 1 night, a very nice gesture, if you stay, ask to view, it is well worth the extra for that special night. If you do not want to travel into Dublin at night, can recommend the Schoolhouse just down the road,(turn right out of the hotel and just a few minutes walk) exellent food and drink. Will definately use again when in the Dublin area.

222,"Perfect little hotel, especially for the rugby!","The wife and i stayed here recently for the SA v Ireland game. What more can i say, it's a great little hotel, perfect if you don't like bumping into loads of other guests. 

Rooms are well decorated, breakfast was fantastic and staff we're very helpful and extremely friendly.

The surrounding area is quite upmarket, lovely big houses and tree-lined roads, and you can walk to Lansdown Rd for the rugby in about 5 minutes. Some good restaurants also a 5 minute walk away.

The city centre is about a 15 to 20 minute walk, but is very pleasant and worth doing at least once, or you can also catch the bus from right outside.

I would certainly recomend this hotel and would definitely stay again!

222,Fantastic Hotel,"Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a weekend stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel.  We really enjoyed staying at this hotel and enjoyed using the mini sauna and jacuzza that is available in most rooms.  The breakfast was lovely and plentiful. Staff were friendly and very helpful.

It would maybe be about a 15-20 min walk into town but we never actually walked because the bus service is so good, the bus stop is right outside the hotel which was very convenient.

Would definately recommend staying here.

222,Wonderful,"This hotel was excellent.  It is in a very good neighborhood in Dublin -- nice, quiet street.  It is walking distance from city centre, but if you get tired of walking there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel.   

We booked a triple room.  The room was very spacious -- 2 twin beds and 1 double bed (which were all very comfortable).  We were on the first floor.  Our bathroom was enormous.  We had a giant jacuzzi tub with a shower as well --  there was also another shower just outside of the tub area at floor level -- although it would have made the bathroom floor all wet, if you are unable to step into a tub this would be nice to have.   Our room also had a tiny sauna in it! I will attach a picture of it. They had a stereo built into the sauna, so you could sit in there and listen to music.  We didn't test the stereo, so I don't know if it plays everywhere, or just inside the sauna.

The staff was very friendly and accomodating.  Breakfast was included and was more than adequate.  Checking in was easy -- we arrived around 10am and they had our room ready for us already.   

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2006,10,28
222,Highly Recommend,"The staff in this hotel could not of been more helpful. Excellent rooms, ours had a Jacuzzi and Sauna in it as well as a balcony. Tray of pot of tea and biscuits free of charge brought to our room or the lounge whenever we wanted was a big plus to make us feel very welcome. Secure car park, (wouldn't advise driving in Dublin). Great breakfasts with friendly attentive staff who could not do enough for us.  We felt very comfortable and relaxed there. 10 mins walk from city Centre and loads of nearby eating places.

Money saving tip in Dublin: Buy your souvenirs from the Tourist Information centre, they are the same but cheaper than most other places.
",5,2006,10,22
222,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"After a long day and night of travelling, we were very happy to arrive at the Roxford Lodge Hotel. As we arrived early in the morning the room was not yet available but we stored our luggage. The staff was super friendly and they assured us a room would be prepared as soon as someone checked out. We left to explore Dublin and came back around noon and our room was available. The room was small but cozy and with very eclectic decor. Although it was small it had a sauna, jacuzzi tub, iron w/ board, and coffee/tea making facililties. We were very happy with the room and had a great night's sleep. Breakfast the next morning was plentiful and delicious. 

The hotel is located about a 10-15 minute walk from Trinity College, and there is a bus stop right outside of the hotel where buses go right to the city center. If we go back to Dublin we will certainly stay at the Roxford Lodge Hotel!
",5,2006,10,14
222,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed here in March 2006 and May 2006..Excellent service..Felt like a home from home..The staff could not do enough to help you. Rooms were great and had a sauna and jacuzzi bath in the room for each stay. Excellent breakfast, great irish fry up.  Both times we stayed were for matches in Lansdowne Road and its only a 4-5 min walk to there..Also the bus stop is right outside the door..Hotel is also around the corner from Baggot Street where there is cracking nightlife. Am going back to this hotel again next week with friends for another stay and we are all looking forward to the warm welcome from the staff and the relaxing comfort of a great quaint hotel.

222,Fantastic anniversary break!,"What a wonderful stay in Dublin and all down to The Roxford Lodge.  My husband and I stayed in the executive suite, with our own sauna, jacuzzi, kitchen and four-poster bed.  Breakfast was served in our room by one of the very attentive staff.  They were so helful and really couldn't do anything more to help make our stay any nicer, including recommending great restaurants and bars.  If we return to Dublin we will definately stay here again, excellent value for money!!
",5,2006,07,30
222,Highly recommend,"Aggie, the innkeeper, was hands down the nicest we met in Ireland.  We traveled with a one year old baby, and her hospitality was wonderful.  This is a great place to stay if you have an infant - our one year old slept in the pack n'play the hotel had arranged, ate in their comfortable high chair at breakfast, and Aggie allowed access to her refigerator to refill the baby's milk and store her food.  The great location of the hotel, comfortable rooms, and reasonable price make this a safe bet even for the pickiest traveler.  Would definitely stay here again.

222,fantastic stay,"My wife, myself and our two kids 5 and 2yrs recently stayed at the roxford lodge during our stay in ireland. What a great hotel! The service was great, the facilities were good- we even had a spa and sauna in our large room! The breakfast was extensive, and the staff couldn't do enough to make our stay more comfortable. Free internet access in the lounge was also a nice feature. The staff provided tea and coffee in the room, but also offered to bring a fresh pot of tea or coffee up to us or to be served in the lounge which was nice. The only gripe was that the directions to the hotel given on the website were hard to follow. It was a refreshing stay,very well priced and we absolutely loved it. Thankyou again roxford lodge. We used 'trip advisor' to find this hotel and we found the previous reccomendations very helpful.
",5,2005,10,30
222,Sorry -- Not That Great!,"Although the desk staff was very friendly and helpful, I thought this place was a bit weird.  From the outside, it is very impressive.  And the location was great for us, we didn't mind the walk into the main area of Dublin.  The free secure parking was very convenient.  Our room itself was kind of ""off"".  The decor was quirky and outdated.  There was a huge tacky sauna taking up a big space in the room.  Our room was overlooking the parking lot.  There was just a strange vibe at this place.  Breakfast was average.  I couldn't recommend it.  Plus, some related advice:  we tried to drive in Dublin and it was the biggest mistake we made on our 2 wk trip around Ireland.  We're city drivers and we thought we could handle it -- but it was terrible!!!  I know there's someone out there like us thinking it probably isn't THAT bad, but it is!!!  Trust us!  Most things you'd want to see are within walking distance, but take a cab or bus to the Guinness Brewery, Kilmainham Gaol, and the Cemetary and Botanical Gardens.  We loved Dublin but almost didn't survive it because of the horrible traffic and confusing roads!
",3,2005,09,11
222,"Great value, great breakfast, convenient location!","Stayed here with 3 girlfriends on our 2nd visit to Dublin.  Staff very friendly - we were offered a cup of tea or coffee every time we walked in the door no matter the hour!  The rooms were fine - including a highly amusing and crazy box of a small 2 person sauna in each clean room.  Quiet location and very easy to walk into St Stephens in 15 minutes.

The breakfast was great - full Irish but you could have a healthy alternative with fruit or yoghurt.  So all round a good value hotel choice for Dublin city.

We liked the School House bar along the road for a first of last drink of the evening.
",4,2005,09,02
222,Great hotel - will stay here again!,"I had to spend a week in Dublin on business but as I'd never been before I was nervous about finding a decent hotel. Thanks to the TripAdvisor reviews, I selected this place and was very glad I did! OK, so my room was a little 'over-decorated' (patterned stained glass over the bed, for starters) but it was scrupulously clean, with a good bed, well designed, and where else will you get a sauna, a jacuzzi and FREE broadband in your room for 80 euros per night?! The staff are wonderfully friendly - every time they see you they ask whether you'd like a cup of tea - and breakfast was very decent (whether you want a full Irish or just a bowl of cereal). 

The hotel is located in the leafy residential area of Ballsbridge to the south-east of the city centre, just over the canal; it took no more than 15 minutes to walk to the Georgian centre of town (Trinity College, etc), and you get to walk past one of the oddest statutes of Oscar Wilde that you're ever likely to see. There is also a bus-stop right outside that will take you direct into the city centre. The Aircoach bus (from the airport) drops off and picks up at a stop about 200 m from the hotel.

I will come back!",5,2005,05,14
222,Great for families,"We found the Roxford Lodge to be ideal for our small family--the family room had two singles and one double bed, and the staff was very friendly and helpful to us.  The location is a bit of a walk from the major tourist sites, but not bad--it gives you a chance to stroll through Merrion Square, which was beautiful in the Spring.
",5,2005,04,04
222,Excellant service,"Myself and my boyfriend arrived in Dublin on a wing and a prayer with nowhere to spend the night hoping to find a half decent room, somewhere to rest our weary heads. What we got instead was excellant hospitality, wonderful service and a lovely holiday. Both the day and night staff were helpful and friendly, doing their best to cater our every need with a warm smile. We had both a sauna and a jacuzzi in our room, a T.V and a large bed, all for a reasonable price. It was the best nights sleep I've had in a long time and I can't wait to stay again.
",5,2004,11,10
222,A comfortable night's sleep,"A small hotel not far from the city centre, so the car could be left in the secure car park. The receptionist was helpful and friendly. Our room was at the back and it was quiet at night so we had a good night's sleep. Rooms and garden clean and well presented.
",4,2004,08,18
222,Fantastic Hospitality!  Lovely B&B!,"Our favorite night's stay during our 11 days in Ireland was at the Roxford. After a long train ride from Galway, we were greeted with incredible hospitality by Lynne who directed us to a beautiful room with a sauna and jacuzzi tub (and she helpfully showed us how everything works). Then we warmed up in the lovely sitting room by a fire and were brought tea and biscuits. Lynne recommended a nice park for a little walk and a very good restaurant. The hotel is well kept, in a great neighborhood (close to downtown but far enough out to be quiet) and is a very good value. When I return to Dublin I will definitely stay at the Roxford!",5,2004,04,28
222,A wonderful welcome - no problem,"We were made wonderfully welcome at this excellent small hotel. Agnes and her staff simply said 'No problem' to anything we asked or even hinted at. On arrival, exhausted and stressed, we were brought a wonderful pot of tea and chocolate biscuits. My wife and I were fortunate enough to enjoy the executive suite. In addition to the four poster bed we enjoyed our own sauna, jacuzzi and kitchen facilities. If you wish to enjoy very clean and comfortable facilities, close to the city centre, and value courtesy and care then visit the Roxford Lodge. I recommend it warmly.",5,2003,02,18
222,Small hotel with a feel-good atmosphere,"Very nice little place, good beds and a perfect varied breakfast, made with lots of love. The location is also very good, the bus stop right in front of the house. In addition, the city center is also within walking distance.",4,2024,10,07
222,Comfortable stay near the center,"Room quite large and clean, with
hairdryer, coffee maker and kettle.
Clean bathroom with bath/shower and clean towels daily. Proximity to the bus station that in 10min leads to downtown and 15min from the DART station. Possibility of secure luggage storage after check out.

Negative side: Carpet in the room, cost a bit 'excessive and breakfast for a fee",5,2024,08,26
222,"Wonderful hotel in quiet suburb of Dublin, with very good value for money","Roxford Lodge was our final stop after a two-week trip through Ireland, and we have to admit we slept nowhere as well as here, in a spacious, quiet room in a very appealing, unexcited residential area of Dublin, with even a free upgrade to a room with hot tub from which we could reach everything either by bus or on foot (about 25 minutes ib the city). The secure parking we gladly used (10€ parking fee), the charging of our e-car was included. We had no time for breakfast because of our early return flight, but it sounded promising :-).",5,2024,08,22
222,Nice cozy hotel,Very nice furnished rooms with lots of comfort. Everything you need for a Dublin trip. There is a bus station right in front of the hotel. In a few minutes you are in the city center. We highly recommend the hotel.,5,2024,08,20
222,Amazing!,"Congratulations!! Very helpful and nice staff, very comfortable room, generally an experience to repeat.
The only flaw is perhaps breakfast but even on this the staff was clear.

222,Recommended,"Nice, well-kept little hotel - well located, within walking distance of the center and right next to an Aircoach stop.
Recommended continental breakfast and very friendly service.
There was a room upgrade - highly recommended.",5,2024,04,15
222,A great stay,"I can't even describe how lucky we were: when we checked in we got a free upgrade to the executive suite. We had a jacuzzi and a sauna, a sofa corner and a balcony. The skylights made the main room incredibly large. It was beautiful, we really enjoyed our stay. That's why I don't really want to say anything about the breakfast, but to be fair: it was good for the (relatively low) price. However, the cold cuts were in a fridge and you could take something from there, some things were apparently no longer there and scrumbled eggs or something similar would have been great. A lady came after a few minutes and was very friendly. I ordered porridge that was freshly prepared and we got toast.
I've had better breakfasts, but it was quite good.
We really liked the Roxford Lodge and it was a 20-25 minute walk to the center of the city.",5,2024,03,29
222,I would definitely go back,"everything perfect, ok clean bathroom friendly staff, I had a problem, but at the reception we solved it immediately. good breakfast, nothing to say, with a twenty minute walk you are in the centre. I would go back",5,2023,11,23

222,From 10,"Small hotel very close to the center (25 minutes walk, 10 by bus). Very friendly staff, very clean and quiet rooms and facilities (the photos are an exact reflection of the room). Simple but complete breakfast, well above its cost. Without a doubt, where I will look first on our next visit to Dublin, it will be at Roxford Lodge Hotel. I would like to once again highlight the cleanliness of the rooms and facilities and the kindness of all the staff we deal with.",5,2023,11,04

Beautiful room, complete with all comforts.

Clean bathroom and a nice big shower.
There is air conditioning if you want!
Very nice furniture in my opinion, modern and of excellent taste.

222,Super kleines Zimmer und altes Interieur,"Ich habe direkt über die Seite des Hotels gebucht, wo mit luxuriösen Zimmern und tollen Bädern geworben wird. Das Zimmer was uns dann gezeigt wurde war aber super klein, sodass wir nichtmal unsere Koffer öffnen konnten und das Bad war auch super winzig. Es war zwar alles sauber, aber es war einfach nur ein Kampf jeden Tag an seinen Kofferinhalt zu kommen. Auch optisch war ich sehr enttäuscht. Optisch war man eher in einer Pension gelandet, als in einem Hotel. Glücklicherweise waren wir ganz oben und hatten es immerhin relativ ruhig. Die Lage war ok, wobei die Busse, die direkt vor dem Hotel gehalten haben, nie in die Richtung zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten gefahren sind. Im Endeffekt sind wir immer zu Fuß gegangen - was meist 1,5km pro Weg bedeutete. Buchen würde ich auf keinen Fall nochmal. In Dublin würde ich mich für ein paar Euro mehr lieber für ein 4-Sterne-Hotel entscheiden. Den Preis fand ich für das Zimmer auf keinen Fall angemessen.",2,2019,06,02

Die Lage ist auch gut. Zu Fuss 25 Minuten in die Innenstadt. Vor dem Hotel fährt auch ein Bus.

222,Otra decepción en Dublin. Qué pasa con los hoteles ??,"Soy entusiasta seguidor de Trip Advisor. No me ha fallado nunca. O, casi nunca. Sólo en un lugar, en una ciudad, las opiniones no se corresponden a la realidad. Esta ciudad es Dublin. Qué pasa con los hoteles ?. Caros, incomprensiblemente caros por la relación de calidad. Qué pasa con las opiniones ?. No lo entiendo. Francamente no lo entiendo. Ya he visitado 3 hoteles en tres años, los tres entre los diez primeros de Trip Advisor. Y ninguno de ellos, votados por los clientes, merece estar en el Top Ten. 
Esta vez se trata de un hotel familiar, correcto, con un parking en la parte trasera, gratuito, privado y directo al hotel, que es un punto muy positivo dada la carencia de parkings en Dublin, y una estructura típica de las casas victorianas de la capital.
Primero. Hay más habitaciones que espacio en a sala de desayunos. Puede existir cola para encontrar mesa. Es probable. La señora que, muy atentamente sirve las mesas, cumple su servicio, pero no es suficiente. No puede atender la demanda por mucho cariño que ponga. Que es mucho, dada la edad que tiene. 
Segundo. La habitación es pequeña, con una sauna que ocupa mucho espacio y en cambio faltan armarios para guardar la ropa y las maletas. El baño es anticuado y con estructuras rotas en la parte baja de la bañera. 
Tercero. En todos los viajes, y son muchos, realizados por el mundo, nunca, nunca, me habian cargado la cuenta el dia de la llegada. Lo encuentro feo, poco ético y una demostración de desconfianza hacia el cliente. Que verifiquen la tarjeta de crédito, que pidan informes, que pidan un adelanto al hacer la reserva, pero jamás carguen el importe de la cuenta al llegar al hotel. 
Por lo demás, puertas y más puertas, pasillos y pasillos, en un pequeño hotel familiar a media hora andando del centro, caro, caro, como todos los hoteles de la activa ciudad, de la viva ciudad de Dublin. .
Una encantadora recepcionista nos alegró la estancia. Florencia. Esta mujer argentina, con cultura, presencia y cortesía, es un toque de alegria en el hotel. Florencia, muchas gracias por tu atención y recomendaciones.
Por lo demás, ustedes mismos.",3,2018,07,10
222,sehr gutes Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt 10 Busminuten ausserhalb des Stadtzentrums. Die Haltestelle ist direkt vor dem Hotel. Es hat einen Parkplatz, aber wie in jeder Grossstadt ist das Fahren mit dem Auto so eine Sache. Wir empfehlen die Anreise mit ÖV oder Taxi.

Wir hatten das Zimmer 104. Es hat eine ausreichende Grösse, auch wenn das Layout gewöhnungsbedürftig sein kann (trapezförmig). Die Ausstattung mit einer Sauna ist unserer Meinung nach überflüssig. Ablageflächen wären praktischer. Der leere Kühlschrank im Zimmer hilft gekaufte Getränke kühl zu halten. Am Fernseher ist eine DVD-Player angeschlossen. Etwa ein Dutzend Filme sind im Zimmer vorhanden.

Das Bad hat auch eine gute Grösse und genügend Ablageflächen. Die Badewanne mit Dusche verfügt über eine stationäre und eine Brause an einem Schlauch. Somit kann sicher jeder  seine bevorzugte Version finden.

Das Frühstück haben wir nicht gebucht. In der Stadt gibt es genügend Möglichkeiten zum Frühstücken.",5,2018,06,29

222,Den irische Chrame perfekt eingfangen,"Ich war mit einem Freund bereits im August 2016 in diesem Hotel und komme leider erst jetzt dazu diese schöne Hotel zu bewerten.

In ca. 20 bis 30 Minuten ( je nach Kondition ) erreicht mein über eine schöne Strecke an div. Parks vorbeiführend den Kern der Dubliner Innenstadt.  Für Leute, die jedoch eher auf einen Bs zurückgreifen möchten, befindet sich direkt eine Bushaltestelle vor dem Hotel. Eine ""DART"" ( Regionalbahn von Dublin) Station befindet sich ebenfalls fußläufig vom Hotel. Von dort aus lassen sich schöne Ausflüge ins Umland von Dublin unternehmen.

Die Zimmer war insgesamt gut. Die Ausstattung varierte wohl je nach Zimmer ( z.B. war in meinem Zimmer eine Sauna, in dem meines Mitreisenden nicht.)

Besonders hervorzuheben, ist der gute Service und die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter. Ebenfalls kann ich nur jedem raten, das irische Frühstück mitzubuchen. Geschmacklich waren die frisch zubereiteten Gerichte, das beste Hotelfrühstück was ich bis jetzt erlebt habe.

Jeder, der also eine Dublin Reise plant, kann hier bedenkenlos buchen.",5,2017,08,14
222,Todo muy bien . Algo caro,"Delicioso lodge en la parte sur de Dublin, limpio, cálido y acogedor.  Las habitaciones son cómodas aunque algo pequeñas al menos las que nos dieron.  A parte contratamos el continental breakfast por 6 euros que merece mucho la pena. 
No le doy puntuación máxima porqué opino due 160 euros la noche por una doble sin desayuno es excesivo.  Cobran por adelantado.  Servicio muy amable",4,2017,07,29
222,Nettes kleines Hotel mit Charme und lustigen Details,"Wir hatten ein Zimmer im untersten Geschoss, ich weiß leider die Nummer nicht mehr. Es war nicht groß, aber ausreichend. Was man hier alles untergebracht hat auf ein paar Quadratmetern ist schon erstaunlich: Einbauschrank, Infrarotsauna, Kühlschrank, Doppelbett, Bad mit Badewanne und Whirlpool, Schreibtisch, Tisch mit 2 Stühlen/Sesseln. Stilsicher ist es nicht, es sieht ein bisschen zusammengewürfelt aus, hat aber seinen Charme. In noch keinemHotelzimmer habe ich soviele Schalter für irgendwas gesehen. Bei manchen blieb uns die Funktion verborgen. Die Lage in Ballsbridge ist toll und mit dem Aircoach leicht zu erreichen. Zu Fuß ist man in maximal 30 Minuten in der Innenstadt. Das Frühstück war auch sehr gut. Hier kriegt man wirklich irischen Käse, sehr lecker und die ältere Dame, die sichtbarem kümmert, vermittelt eine familiäre Atmosphäre.",3,2017,06,09
222,OTTIMO HOTEL,"A15 minuti dal centro citta'. Buon rapporto prezzo/qualità. Camere spaziose eravamo in 4. Viaggiavo in famiglia e la camera era spaziosa. Molto caratteristico in stile vittoriano, avevamo la camera anche con sauna.
La colazione era a parte ma noi non l'abbiamo fatta.",4,2017,06,08
222,Tolles Hotel & sehr freundliches Personal ,"Wirklich sehr zu empfehlen: schön eingerichtete Zimmer, sehr gepflegt und sauber!

Tolle Lage, in ca. 15 Minuten waren wir zu Fuß im Stadtzentrum! Das Hotel liegt in einem Wohnviertel und ist daher auch eher ruhig!

Für einen Städtetrip sehr zu empfehlen!

",5,2017,05,12
222,Caffè molto carino,"In visita al Print Museum ci siamo fermati a bere qualcosa...Caffè molto carino, con personale gentile e disponibile.
Ottimo il cappuccino e la cheesecake al caramello salato e popcorn. I dolci e le bevande sono anche presentati molto bene.",5,2017,04,06
222,Super Hotel für Stadterkundungen,"Ein kleines verwinkeltes Hotel, das sehr zentral gelegen ist und daher super für Stadterkundungen. Besonders schön ist, dass es nicht nur 15 min von der Stadt liegt sondern auch direkt am Kanal. Tolle Lage",5,2017,04,05
222,Quantita'non qualita',"Molto deludente.
purtroppo come spesso succede,fotografie e recensioni,possono essere forvianti.
La. Casa d'epoca doveva essere stupenda,prima di essere converttita in albergo .
Moltiplicandone le stanze,gli spazi si sono ridotti notevolmente e il fascino antico del palazzo e'stato malamente sostituito da camere prive di charme.
Senza entrare nei minimi dettagli,la casa necessita di manutenzione,soffitti con infiltrazioni,serramenti dal quale entrano spifferi d'aria di notevole entita',bagno piccolissimo e poco funzionale.
Materassi da cambiare,ormai ridotti alle molle..piumini con odore sgradevole,cosi come i cuscini...
Le piante di plastiica fanno da cornice a tutto il resto.
Costo elevato x cio che offre.
Nota positiva,personale molto carino e disponibile",2,2016,11,24
222,Ideal für nostalgische Ekzentriker ...  ;-),"Vorteile: Parkplatz im Hinterhof, wenn auch beengt, und Fußnähe zur Innenstadt.
Sehr liebenswürdiges Personal und insgesamt sauberes Ambiente.

Wir bekamen netterweise als Upgrade die nach hinten liegende, hochkuriose ""Suite"" mit 3 Halbetagen, Bad, Küchenecke, Baldachin-Bett, Sauna (!), Büroecke/Salon mit PC/Drucker, Balkönchen, Jacuzzi-Bad und Art Déco-Deckenlichtern - ein eklektischer Mix aus 20er-Jahren und niemals renovierten 70er-Jahren.

Nachteile: Das Bett war hart und unbequem, das Wasser tropfte bei Regen durchs Dach, der Jacuzzi war nicht fully functional. Das Frühstück war so làlà und ohne erkennbare Mühe um Frische, Angebotsbreite und Besonderheit.

Insgesamt bleibt die Erinnerung an ein eher skurriles, aber sympathisches Hotel mit Charakter!",3,2016,10,06
222,"Nettes Hotel, ab vom Trubel, aber in Fußnähe der Innenstadt","Wir waren 4 Tage in diesem Hotel. Unser Zimmer lag im Hinterhaus, das man über einen Parkplatz erreichte. Das Hinterhaus selbst sieht aus wie eine Garage, ich war erst entsetzt. Von innen ist es aber modern und sauber, verfügt über nur 2 Zimmer und ist sehr ruhig. Das Zimmer war im Verhältnis zu denen im ""Haupthaus"" wohl ziemlich groß. Wir hatten 2 getrennte Betten, ein großes Bad, Schrank, TV, DVD-Player, Nespresso-Maschine, Sauna, Badewanne mir Whirlpool... Von der Ausstattung her kann man nicht motzen. 
Es dauerte etwas, bis warmes Wasser aus der Dusche kam. Danach konnte man die Wassertemperatur schwer einstellen (habe mir an einem Tag die Füße verbrüht). 
Frühstück war gut: man hat die Wahl zwischen Full Irish Breakfast (Bohnen, Speck, Würstchen, Spiegelei... lecker) oder Continental Breakfast (überschaubar: Kochschinken und Käse). 
Die Lage ist gut: in die Innenstadt läuft man circa 20 Minuten zu Fuß. 
Insgesamt finde ich es etwas teuer, auf einen Großteil der Ausstattung, die sicherlich den Preis mitbestimmen, hätte ich verzichten können",4,2016,09,28
222,Tolles Stadthotel mit eher kleinen Zimmern,"Es handelt sich um ein kleines Stadthotel in Laufweite zum Zentrum (ca. 15 Minuten) und somit für uns sehr gut gelegen, direkt vor der Haustür ist aber auch eine Busstation. Unser Zimmer war recht klein, aber sauber und mit allem ausgestattet, u.a. mit einer kleinen (Infrarot-?) Sauna. Das Personal war freundlich und das Frühstück fanden wir super. Sehr gut ist auch der kostenlose Parkplatz hinter dem Hotel für Gäste mit einem Mietwagen.",4,2016,09,14
222,A 15 min a piedi dal centro ..,"Ottimo hotel Irish style, situato in una villa poco fuori dal centro in una zona tranquilla, verde .... Si raggiunge il centro con una camminata di circa 15/20 minuti, avevamo con il nostro piccolo di neanche 3 anni, camminava con noi fino al Trinyti College ...
Hotel curato, pulito, personale gentilissimo, una signora parlava anche un buon italiano, camera spaziosa, noi eravamo in quattro 2 adulti, un ragazzo di 15 anni e il cucciolo di 2 anni e mezzo .... Colazione all' inglese eccezionale.... X gli amanti del cappuccino e brioche come me ..... Né uno né l'altro ... Mi sono rifatto con ottime fette biscottate,marmellata e burro ....
Lo consiglio X tutti ... Veramente un ottimo hotel ....",4,2016,08,29
222,Nur für kurzen Aufenthalt ok,"Im Internet präsentiert sich die Oxford Lodge als warmherzig geführtes Familienhotel, welches Wert auf schön dekorierte Zimmer legt. Die Realität präsentierte sich uns etwas anders. Zum einen finde ich es wenig kundenfreundlich, dass der Übernachtungspreis zwei Tage vor Ankunft in voller Höhe von der Kreditkarte abgebucht wird. Eine anteilige Kaution wäre ok. Aber die volle Summe? Und auch vor Ort war von der Freundlichkeit, die in den anderen Beurteilungen hier gelobt wird, nichts zu spüren. Wir wurden z.B. nie gefragt, wie unser Tag war, Tipps fürs Abendessen gab es nur unwillig auf Nachfrage und  als am vorletzten Tag meine Zimmerkarte gesperrt war, wartet ich vergebens auf ein ""Tut uns leid"". Einzig der Service beim Frühstück war wirklich ausgesprochen nett und zuvorkommend.
Das sehr kleine (!) Zimmer präsentierte sich in einer eigenwilligen Mischung aus restaurierten und abgewohnten Teilen. Der Bereich um das Betthaupt war neu gestaltet (dieser wird einem auch auf den Fotos präsentiert) aber das restliche Mobiliar ist alt und wenig attraktiv. Im Bad weiß man nicht, wohin mit seinen Utensilien, da es nur eine ganz kleine Ablagemöglichkeit gibt.
Zwei Koffer zu öffnen, war fast unmöglich. Dafür war eine Sauna etwa in der Größe eines Kleiderschrankes iim Zimmer. Warum auch immer. Ich frage mich ob diese jemals benutzt wurde...
Um mit etwas Positivem abzuschließen: Das Zimmer war sauber und die Lage der Hotels ist trotz der großen Straße Nachts recht ruhig und auch gut. Das Zentrum von Dublin erreicht man zu Fuß in etwa 20 Minuten. Man kann aber auch den Bus nehmen, der direkt vor dem Haus hält. Auch diverse Restaurants sind in der Nähe.",3,2016,06,11
222,Ruhiges Hotel mit phantastischem Frühstück,"Unser Doppelzimmer lag auf der Gartenseite im Untergeschoss, sehr ruhig, mit einem Terassenausgang auf einen kleinen, abgetrennten Hof. Das Zimmer war klein und sehr voll gestellt, hatte alles was man braucht und vieles, was wir nicht brauchten, z.B. eine klitzekleine Sauna. Das Frühstück war sehr gut; neben den üblichen Zutaten des Irish Breakfast gab es einen tollen Obstsalat, Müsli, Joghurt, Käse, Marmeladen, Cerealien, Säfte...die Lage ist nichts für kurze abendliche Abstecher in die City.",4,2016,05,18
222,"Nettes, ruhig gelegenes Hotel","Die Roxford Lodge liegt in „Posh Area“ von Dublin also in der Gegend der eher wohlhabenden Dubliner.
Wir hatten ein Zimmer für 1 Woche welches etwas klein war – vielleicht sollte man wenn man länger als ein Wochenende bleibt darauf achten ein größeres Zimmer zu buchen.
Das Zimmer war sauber hatte aber leider einen dicken Teppich verlegt was wir aus hygienischen Gründen nicht so mögen.
Es gibt aber auch Zimmer mit Holzboden welche z.B. für Allergiker besser geeignet sind.
Das Zimmerfenster  war zum Hinterhof des Gebäudes gerichtet und daher war es nachts sehr ruhig.
Kostenloses WLAN gibt es in jedem Zimmer welches auch gut funktionierte.
Einziger Kritikpunkt war das Badezimmer welches leider zu wenige Ablagemöglichkeiten bot und die Decke war schimmelig.
Das sollte so nicht sein und dewegen gibt es 1 Punktabzug bei der Sauberkeit.

Die tägliche wechselnde Hotelcrew war immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit!
In der Lounge des Hotels steht ein PC samt Drucker 24/7 bereit. Sehr praktisch.
Weiters gibt es eine Busstation zum City-Center vis-a-vis vom Hotel.
Man sollte immer den passenden Ticketpreis (in Münzen!) parat haben da die Busfahrer kein Wechselgeld geben!
Eine Fahrt vom Hotel ins Zentrum kostet EUR 2,- pro Person…das nur zur Info.

In der näheren Umgebung sind einige Pubs für das leibliche Wohl.

Fazit: Gute und ruhige Lage, freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal, wir kommen gerne wieder!",4,2016,05,06
222,"freundliches, ruhiges Hotel abseits des Temple Bar Trubels","Wer nicht unbedingt downtown im Temple Bar District nächtigen möchte und es etwas gemütlicher mag, dem sei das Roxford Lodge Hotel empfohlen. Zu Fuss ist das Zentrum in rund 20 Minuten zu erreichen, die Buslinien 4, 7 und 8 halten direkt vor der Haustüre, und auch die DART Stationen Lansdowne Road und Grand Canal Dock sind zu Fuss in weniger als 10 Minuten zu erreichen. Auch der Flughafenbus Aircoach (702) hält nur wenige Schritte vom Hotel entfernt.
Das Hotel liegt in Ballsbridge Dublin 4, einem ruhigen und gut situierten Stadtteil.
Das Gebäude stammt aus der viktorianischen Epoche, wo die Leute wohl etwas kleiner gebaut waren. Wer also etwas grösser gebaut ist (>1.80m) tut gut daran bei der Buchung dies anzugeben; das Hotel hält ein paar Zimmer mit etwas grösseren Betten bereit. Ansonsten ist halt alles ein bisschen knapp und eng. Nichtsdestotrotz ist alles sauber und intakt, man fühlt sich absolut wohl. Kaffee und Tee wird nachmittags serviert. Manche Zimmer hätten sogar eine kleine Sauna im Raum, Zimmer 123 jedenfalls nicht.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und gibt hilfreiche Tipps über do's und don'ts.
Wifi ist kostenfrei, mitunter aber nicht besonders schnell. Sollte aber für Feriengebrauch dennoch ausreichend sein. 
Zum Frühstück wird auch irish breakfast angeboten, neben kontinentaler Auswahl wie Joghurt, Flakes, Obst und Säfte.
Auf jeden Fall eine Empfehlung wert.",4,2016,03,28
222,A good weekend,Un hotel perfecto para una estancia como visitante en el que la ayuda de los empleados del hotel ha sido excelente. La habitación suficiente para dos personas. El desayuno continental suficiente también. Muy bien comunicado con el centro de la ciudad.,5,2016,02,15
222,Muy bien,"La ubicacion a 20-25 minutos del centro pero aceptable. 

La habitacion muy bien, con muchas comodidades (cama perfecta, bano mas que suficiente con ducha, banera con hidromasaje y sauna, enchufes adaptados). 

El personal muy amable y atento. 

Wifi gratis y funcionando de maravilla. 

Autobus directo desde el aeropuerto practicamente a la puerta del hotel.",4,2016,02,01
222,Gemütliches Hotel mit familiären Service,"Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend und das Hotelpersonal war sehr freundlich und versuchte alles um uns einen angenehmen Aufenthalt zu ermöglichen. Zur Begrüßung brachte man uns Tee und Kekse und wir wurden sogar persönlich ins Hotelzimmer begleitet, damit man uns mit der Einrichtung vertraut macht. Unser Zimmer war zwar recht klein, aber für die drei Nächte reichte es vollkommen aus. Die Ausstattung war sehr liebevoll, so dass wir unter anderem zahlreiche DVDs zur Verfügung hatten. Ebenfalls war der Jacuzzi im Bad eine tolle Sache. Das Stadtzentrum von Dublin konnten wir immer bequem zu Fuß erreichen. 
Insgesamt fühlten wir uns tatsächlich nicht wie in einem Hotel, sondern wie in einem richtigen irischen Haushalt.",4,2016,01,03
222,Atmosfera unica a 2 passi dal centro,"Hotel situato a 10 minuti a piedi dal centro di Dublino, è munito di parcheggio privato incluso nel prezzo.

222,Sauberes und ruhiges Hotel,"Ein sehr sauberes und ruhig gelegenes Hotel! Wir haben uns absolut wohl gefühlt und würden jederzeit wieder dort übernachten. 
Da das Hotel sich in einer Wohngegend befindet, ist es sehr ruhig gelegen. Die Innenstadt kann man dennoch gut zu Fuß in ca. 15 Minuten erreichen.
Die Atmosphäre ist absolut familiär und man fühlt sich nicht wie in einem Hotel.
Der Personal ist ebenso sehr freundlich. Absolute Empfehlung!",5,2015,11,04
222,Tolle Lage in Ballsbridge!,"Das Beste an diesem Hotel ist sicherlich die Lage! Ballsbridge ist ein wunderschönes Viertel mit tollen Häusern, man kann gut zu Fuß ins Zentrum von Dublin laufen und es ist nachts absolut ruhig, sodass man gut schlafen kann.
Das Hotel ist nett eingerichtet, für unseren Geschmack ein bisschen zuviel Pomp und Blümchen und zum Teil etwas angestaubt. Das Zimmer war geräumig, groß genug für uns vier mit schönem Bad. Das Frühstück fanden wir eher durchschnittlich, wir fühlten uns zum Teil etwas durch die Dame bedrängt, die uns sehr beharrlich bedienen wollte. 
Für zwei Nächte in Dublin aber sicher eine gute Wahl, wenn man eher den persönlicheren Stil eines B&B schätzt als ein anonymes Hotel.",3,2015,07,29
222,Un po' fuori dal centro,"Hotel piacevole e curato in un'area tranquilla di Dublino, stanza pulita e con wifi gratuito.  
Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione ma non è stato difficile trovare locali aperti di mattina presto nelle vicinanze.

Es ist sehr sauber.Jeden Tag gab es frische Handtücher und Seife und die Betten haben sehr frisch gerochen
Der Service war klasse.Jederzeit konnten wir Kaffee oder Tee bestellen und auch beim Frühstück wurden wir gut umsorgt.
Alle sind freundlich und dezent und man hat das Gefühl,dass sich noch Gedanken gemacht werden,dass sich die Gäste wohlfühlen

222,Very irish style,"Siamo tornati a Dublino per festeggiare l'anniversario di 20 anni di matrimonio. Abbiamo scelto questo hotel sia per le ottime valutazioni sia per il tipico stile irlandese che sembrava avere. 
E non siamo rimasti delusi. Bellissimo all'esterno e all'interno molto curato e pulito. 
Il personale molto gentile e disponibile e un apprezzamento speciale anche per la colazione, ottima e servita da una signora ""molto irish"". 
L'hotel è in una zona residenziale molto bella e il centro è facilmente raggiungibile con una passeggiata. ",5,2014,10,13
222,Piacevole soggiorno ,"Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti. Camera non grande ma comoda pulita e silenziosa. In due settimane di vacanza irlandesi per noi é stata una delle colazioni migliori.

222,Romantico Saint-Valentin,"Este hotel lo escogimos para pasar nuestro primer saint-valentin como casados. El cual fue una excelente experiencia! El personal de la reception es muy agradable, cuando el chico supo que estabamos de luna de miel, nos regalo una 1/2 botella de vino, y nos dieron  una habitacion de una categoria superior,  el cual nos parecio una super atencion de su parte. 
La habitacion tenia un sauna y el cual nos permitio relajarnos despues de todo un dia de turismo por Dublin (si quieren sauna en la habitacion pidanlo en cuanto hagan su reserva). 
Durante nuestra estancia decidimos  tomar el desayuno en el hotel, ya que este hotel esta situado a unos 20 minutos a pie del centro de la ciudad y era mucho mas practico tomarlo en el el mismo hotel que perder tiempo buscando en el centro de la ciudad . El desayuno es muy completo y los precios son razonables!, y la senora que sirve el desayuno es muy serviable! 
Un excelente hotel y una excelente experiencia!! 100% satisfechos!!",4,2014,05,11
222,Schöne Tage in Dublin,"Wir waren für fünf Nächte in Dublin und haben in der Roxford Lodge übernachtet. An sich hat uns nichts gefehlt und da wir eh den Tag über unterwegs waren, nutzten wir unser Zimmer vorranging zum Schlafen. Das Zimmer war klein,sauber und vorallem gemütlich eingerichtet. Schade war nur, dass wir ein Zimmer mit Aussicht auf den Hinterhof mit angeschlossenem Baunuternehmen hatten. Beim Frühstück wurden uns alle Wünsche von den Augen abgelesen.
Insgesamt hatten wir eine gute Zeit und würden wieder kommen.",4,2014,04,21
222,"Buen servicio, buena ubicación, buena atención","Lindo hotel, con una buena ubicación, aunque no está en pleno centro. Esta aproximadamente a 15 cuadras de los lugares de interés turistico, pero son bonitas cuadras para caminarlas.
Es un edificio antiguo, que debe haber sido reciclado hace varios años.
Me costo un poco encontrarlo el día que llegue.
Quizas reserve una habitacion standard, pero mi habitacion era super pequeña, sin espacio casi para el equipaje, obviamente sin hidromasaje, por lo cual mi habitacion deber haber sido la peor de todas.
La atención de las recepcionistas fue muy buena. El desayuno regular. El servicio de wi fi bueno.",4,2013,09,14
222,Strategica posizione,"Abbiamo scelto questo hotel vedendo le ottime recensioni. Arrivati siamo rimasti perplessi dall'esterno e dalla piccola hall. tale perplessità si é diradata subito con la squisita gentilezza dello staff, pronto ad elencare tutti i servizi offerti e accompagnandoci in camera. ottima pulizia e la possibilità di parcheggiare l'auto nel parcheggio interno. l'hotel dista 2 km dal centro di Dublino, ma ha una fermata bus davanti all'uscita che vi porterà in centro Zona Trinity College in 4 min.( costo  biglietto1,65 eur ). lo consiglierei ad amici",5,2013,09,02
222,knapp befriedigend!,"Durchschnittshotel ohne Ansprüche. Unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss war sehr klein und funktional. Gefehlt hats an nichts, zum schlafen völlig ok, mehr aber auch nicht! An einem Tag haben wir das Zimmer Vormittags verlassen und als wir Abend zurückgekommen sind war die Türe komplett offen und blockiert. Gemäss Auskunft des Empfangs hat wohl die Putzfrau vergessen haben (am Morgen!!) die Türe wieder zu schliessen. Die Türöffnungskarte der Putzfrau steckte im Zimmer im Stromslot. Unsere Koffer und alles stand somit den ganzen Tag frei für jeden zugänglich! Nach meiner sofortigen Reklamation kam nicht mal jemand mit zum Zimmer um es sich näher anzuschauen, die einzige Reaktion ""oh, das sollte nicht passieren, melden sie sich falls etwas fehlt""....! 
Das Morgenessen war ok, die ältere Dame aber völlig überfordert da auch gleichzeit für das Auschecken verantwortlich. Zudem wurde uns beim einchecken nicht gesagt, dass es ein international und ein full irish breakfast gibt, natürlich mit ziemlich unterschiedlichem Preis! Die Überraschung kam dann beim auschecken. 
Ich empfehle das Roxford nicht und würde auch nicht wieder dort hin gehen.",3,2013,08,08
222,Luxuriöse Suite,"Wir hatten die Executive Suite! Hervorragendes Himmelbett und perfektes Jacuzzi! Sehr zu empfehlen! Etwas außerhalb des Zentrums, ca. 10-15 Minuten zu Fuß, daher sehr ruhig! Das Frühstück war sehr gut und für jeden Geschmack das richtige dabei!",5,2013,07,22
222,Wunderschönes Ambiente mit kleinen technischen Mängeln,"Das Roxford-Lodge ist ein sehr schönes und auch relativ ruhig in der Nähe des Grand Canal gelegenes Hotel. Am Grand Canal entlang kann man wunderschöne Lauftouren machen. Zimmer sehr sauber und gepflegt (einschließlich einer Infrarot-Saunakabine), Frühstück großartig, Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Sowohl Tee als auch Wein wird auf Verlangen sofort im Zimmer serviert. Einziger Kritikpunkt ist das Bad, wo die Armaturen vorsintflutlich sind und (in unserem Zimmer) das Warmwasser sehr schlecht funktioniert hat.",4,2013,06,05
222,Una grata sorpresa.,Hermoso hotel cerca del nuevo estdio de Dublin. Nuestra estancia fue muy agradable y el personal muy atento y amable. Mi vuelo salia varias horas después del checkout y al preguntar yo en la recepción  por un café cercano con wifi muy amablemente el personal del hotel me sugirió quedarme en su salón de negocios y me obsequiaron un café de cortesía que me trajeron con galletitas de varios tipos. Da gusto ver que hay personas que se esmeran en dar un trato amable con detalles tan agradables.,5,2013,03,03
222,discreto,"Siamo stai in questo hotel nel mese di novembre 2012, dalle recensioni lette mi aspettavo una posizione più centrale, invece per raggiungere il centro a piedi occorrevano più di 20-25 minuti e con le temperature dublinesi il tragitto non era affatto piacevole. 
Nel complesso l'hotel è carino, le stanze molto piccole ma confortevoli ed il personale cortese.
Consigliato per il buon rapporto qualità prezzo ma ...con riserva (per la posizione).
Se tornassi a Dublino sceglierei un hotel nei pressi del Trinity college.",3,2013,01,28
222,volveria a este hotel sin dudarlo!,"El hotel es tal cual se ve en las fotos muy limpio y acogedor - Las habitaciones  incluyen- sauna y jacuzzi . Estas son muy luminosas -  El hotel no se encuentra en el centro pero el barrio es muy bonito y seguro para caminar de noche. Hay  dos lineas de autobuses  en la puerta del hotel y el aircoach te deja a unos pocos pasos. Con respecto al desayuno- Este es muy rico y abundante. 
Por ultimo, el personal del hotel es muy amable -siempre dispuesto a ayudarte.",5,2013,01,24

C'è la possibilita di farsi portare il te in camera quando rientri la sera, tutte le camere comunque sono dotate di boiler per farsi il te quando si vuole! La colazione (da scegliere al momento della prenotazione può essere standard o Irish breakfast) sono molto abbondanti e ci si può permettere di saltare il pasto a mezzogiorno.

222,Sehr angenehmes Hotel in ruhiger Lage,"Das Roxford Lodge Hotel ist ein sehr angenehmes Hotel im eher gehobenen Viertel Ballsbridge. Die Lage ist gut, der Bus vom Flughafen hält fast vor der Tür (aircoach.ie, beim Old School Hotel aussteigen, von da zwei Minuten zu Fuß). Der Fußmarsch in die Stadt dauert 20 Minuten. Das Viertel selbst ist sehr ruhig, abends bekommt man praktisch nichts mehr hier.

Die Zimmer sind sauber, schön gestaltet - ich hatte ein Faxgerät (!), eine Auswahl an Videos und eine Infrarot-Sauna - und man fühlt sich sehr wohl. Das kontinentale Frühstück für 6 Euro war für mich völlig ausreichend, zumal man sich zu Toast & Cheese/Ham auch Obst, Fruchtsalat und Müsli nehmen kann, soviel man möchte. Irish Breakfast kostet 12 Euro, das ist im Vergleich teurer als an zahlreichen Orten im Zentrum. Die Bewirtung ist allerdings persönlich und zuvorkommend, die Gäste werden gut betreut.

WLAN ist kostenfrei nutzbar, ein privater Parkplatz befindet sich hinterm Haus. Die Besitzer geben gerne hilfreiche Tipps zu Dublin, Infomaterial ist auch reichlich vorhanden.",4,2012,09,15
222,Un gioiellino...a pochi passi dal centro di Dublino!,"In tutta onestà devo dire che sono andato con i piedi di piombo nella scelta dell'albergo a Dublino, date le innumerrevoli recensioni positive che l'albergo già aveva...ma posso dire di mio che esserci dal vivo è un'altra cosa!
Sin dall'arrivo lo staff è sempre stato molto cordiale e disponibile sia nel mostrarci le camere e i servizi dell'hotel,sia nell'offrirci tè e caffè nella lounge room (cosa che si è ripetuta ogni pomeriggio al nostro rientro in albergo)...
La posizione dell'albergo è molto buona,in una zona residenziale a circa 15 minuti massimo di passseggiata dal centro di Dublino (Grafton Street) e devo dire che la zona stessa è di per sè molto tranquilla e ospitale...
La camera è pulita e sufficientemente grande,con un bagno piccolo ma più che agibile e con il vezzo della vasca idromassaggio...unica pecca lo spazio guardaroba un pò risicato per chi eventualmente vuole disfare i bagagli!
La colazione è a pagamento extra,ma è davvero riccha e appagante e la signora che ti serve ricorda tantissimo una nonna o una zia premurosa che quasi se la prende a male quando rifiuti l'Irish breakfast o le omelette e preferisci la classica colazione all' ""italiana"" con solo cereali,latte e croissant!
Devo dire 3 notti davvero eccellenti in tutto!",5,2012,08,27
222,Executive Suite,"Abbiamo alloggiato in questa struttura nella suite che offrono. Davvero eccellente con vasca jacuzzi per due pax, vino e cioccolatini di benvenuto. La stanza è anche dotata di cucina ed elettrodomestici vari, computer privato utilizzabile persino per stampare documenti.

Skurril ist die Einrichtung mit einer Infrarot-Minisauna auf dem Zimmer, dafür ist die Badewanne mit Whirlpoolfunktion allerdings ganz nützlich. Im Großen und Ganzen ist das Hotel nachts ruhig und man schläft gut.
Ein kostenloser gesicherter Parkplatz ist im Hinterhof vorhanden und eine Bushaltestelle direkt vor dem Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich.",5,2012,05,28
222,Ottimo servizio,"Albergo piccolo in una casa georgiana ben ristrutturata. Personale molto gentile e cordiale. Colazione buona, con possibilità di farsi preparare porridge, pane tostato, bacon, e tutto quello che contraddistingue le colazioni di tipo britannico. Non c'era molta scelta su dolci, yogurt, formaggi, come succede negli alberghi di questa dimensione.
Posizione tranquilla, con fermate degli autobus vicinissime (incluso aircoach da e per l'aeroporto). Si trova giusto a sud del Grand Canal, seguendo la strada si arriva in 20 minuti a piedi al Trinity College, ancora più vicina la Pearse station per la Dart.",5,2012,04,26
222,Buen hotel pero un poco alejado del centro,"El hotel está perfectamente cuidado al detalle y el personal es muy amable y atento, pendiente en todo momento de cualquier necesidad que se pueda tener.
Las habitaciones tienen jaccuzi, pero el estractor del baño es algo ruidoso.
La ubicación es buena, en cuanto a que está bien comunicado del centro por varios autobuses, pero si la intención es ir andando, el paseo es de 30 min. a buen paso.
Con respecto al aeropuerto está muy bien comunicado con el aircoach, que te deja a escasos 100 m. del hotel.",4,2012,04,10
222,Relación calidad precio,Precio ajustado a la habitación. Los colchones necesitan un cambio ruido horrible del extractor del baño que no se apagaba en ningun momento y las cortinas no tapaban bien la luz del exterior. Necesitaría algunos arreglos. La sauna si te da tiempo a utilizarla es un buen detalle ,3,2012,04,05
222,Perfektes Hotel für die Stadterkundung,"Wir waren für 4 Nächte im Roxford Lodge und hatten das Glück ein Zimmer mit Sauna und Jacuzzi zu erwischen. Beides waren nette Zugaben in einem wirklich schönen und empfehlenswerten Hotel. Der Empfang war sehr herzlich ( es gab immer Tee oder Kaffee + Kekse aufs Zimmer, egal wann man ""heim"" kam ), das Zimmer war zwar etwas klein, aber sauber und schön eingerichtet. Es gab Wasserkocher für Tee-/ Kaffeezubereitung, einen DVD-Player mit DVD's und kostenloses WIFI. In der Lounge mit Kamin konnte man seinen Tee ebenfalls genießen und den PC nutzen für Internet und drucken. Das irische Frühstück war super schmackhaft und so umfangreich, dass es für den folgenden Stadtbummel ausgereicht hat. Das Hotel war ca. 20min zu Fuß von der City entfernt. Es gibt direkt vor der Haustür aber eine Bushaltstelle. Vom Airport empfiehlt sich der Aircoach ( nicht Airlink ), da dieser auch 300m vor dem Hotel hält. Ingesamt das perfekte Hotel fr Sightseeing in Dublin. Da es ein eher kleines Hotel ist, wirkt alles viel persönlicher. Sämtliche Mitarbeiter sind freundlich und hilfsbereit. Daher werden wir es ür unseren nächsten Dublinaufenthalt wieder buchen.",5,2012,02,05
222,Cortesia e stile,"Abbiamo dormito due notti al Roxford Lodge, e i punti di forza dell'albergo sono: lo stile (casa vittoriana), la gentilezza di tutto lo staff sia in sala colazione che alla reception, la posizione molto tranquilla a 20 minuti dal centro di Dublino e la colazione.
La nostra camera (numero 123) era piccola con letto double (140 cm) , ma con tutti i servizi (Wifi gratuito, teiera/coffee maker, lettore DVD in camera).
La colazione e' veramente ottima in quanto e' possibile scegliere a' la carte tra Full Irish Breakfast, diversi tipi di omelette o colazione continentale e tutto e' veramente molto gustoso e preparato al momento.",5,2011,10,13
222,"Sehr nett, aber ein bisschen teuer","Das Hotel bietet sehr viel, man hat in den Zimmern eine 1 Personen Infrarot Sauna, eine normal große Badewanne mit Sprudel, wir einem als Jacuzzi angeboten, aber darunter versteh ich was anderes als ne Badewanne, Flachbildschirm mit DVD Player und diversen DVDs.
Also die Ausstattung ist super, varriert aber stark von Zimmer zu Zimmer, daher rate ich beim Buchen nachzufragen was alles drin ist.
Auch die Preise varrieren sehr, wir hatten 5 Doppelzimmer gebucht zu unterschiedlicher Zeit und haben zwischen 69 und 100 Euro die Nacht gezahlt. Auch dafür lohnt sein ein Anruf.
Die Lage ist ganz ok, 15 Minuten laufen und man ist in der Stadt, zum Flughafen kostet es mit dem Taxi bisschen mehr als 30 €, unbedingt durch den Tunnel fahren, spar Zeit und Nerven, Fahrt dauert 30 Minuten.
Das Frühstück für 6 € (kalt) bzw. 12 € (warm) haben wir nicht in Anspruch genommen, es gibt einige Pubs in der Nähe, allerdings sah es sehr gut aus.",4,2011,10,10
222,"Gutes , preiswertes Hotel mit guter Busanbindung","Dieses im Süden von Dublin gelegene Hotel war eine preiswerte und gute Unterkunft wärend meines 11-tägigen Aufenthalt in Dublin. Durch die gute Anbindung an den Nahverkehr (der Dublinbus hält direkt vor der Tür), war es kein Problrm in das ca. 2 km entfernte Zentrum von  Dublin zu gelangen. 
Das Zimmer war ruhig und sauber, und enthielt sogar eine Sana (wer es mag!!).
Beim Frühstück sollte man unbedingt auf das sehr üppige und schmackhafte ""Irish Breakfast"" zugreifen. 
Insgesamt ist dieses in georganischen Stil errichtet Hotel wärmsten weiter zu empfehlen.",5,2011,09,22
222,Molto bello e tranquillo,"Hotel/B&b situato in posizione molto tranquilla e residenziale a 15 minuti a piedi dal centro.
Lo staff è stato estremamente cordiale dall'arrivo al check out dando suggerimenti sulla visita della città.
La camera era molto spaziosa con dvd, sistema the/caffè, tv satellitare, sauna (non utilizzata) e con un bel bagno.
Colazione buona; nel complesso da consigliare vivamente.",5,2011,08,08
222,wow - just perfect for honeymoon,"Richtig schönes und ruhiges Hotel. Liegt zwar etwas ausserhalb des Zentrums (ca. 15 min) zu Fuss aber der Weg lohnt sich. Ein riesen Whirlpool, eine eigene Sauna und sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Die Zimmer sind super clean, auch wenn die letzte Renovation wohl schon ein paar Jahre her ist - aber dafür findet man alles was das Herz begehrt. Würde jederzeit wieder dort einchecken!",5,2011,07,18
222,Ingannevoli recensioni e hotel,"Fidandoci delle recensioni, anche noi siamo andati al Roxford. All'arrivo la reception lascia perplessi. Anche se c'è da dire che il personale è meraviglioso e gentilissimo. Per il resto: ci hanno dato una camera pseudo matrimoniale così piccola che non entravano neppure le valigie. Per andare in bagno dovevo aspettare che il mio compagno si mettesse sdraiato o chiudere qualche porta. C'era un piccolo ripostiglio adibito ad armadio con una ragnatela enorme. Pulizia molto sommaria e carente, solo apparenza: angoli sporchi, lenzuola sporche con presenza di orribili peli, odore nella camera di muffa insopportabile. Zero insonorizzazione, il tizio della camera sopra mi ha svegliata con i passi alle 4 di mattina e tutti i rumori entravano in camera a tutte le ore non aessendoci finestre o porte di spessore. Mancanza di doccia ma presenza di vasca con pseudo idromassaggio inutile!! La sauna in camera è solo un ulteriore perdita di spazio inutile. Abbiamo dormito vestiti e solo a pensare all'odore in camera mi sento male. Se vi capita quindi la stanza 122/124 è meglio NON PRENOTARE!!!  Inoltre dicevano che vi era INTERNET wireless ma non è così perchè la connessione era così evanescente da non consentire l'accesso.",2,2011,04,22
222,sembrava di essere a casa,"Abbiamo prenotato fidandosi dei consigli dei tripadvisored ed e' stato tutto perfetto. La camera e' piacevole, con sauna all'interno, appena usata ma carina.
la posizione dell'hotel e' a pochi passi dal centro, dieci minuti a piedi, abbiamo avuto la fortuna di trovare tre belle giornate di piu' o meno sole, per cui abbiamo camminato molto a piedi. Comodo per arrivre col pulman dall'aeroporto.
il personale e' simpatico, super gentile.
La colazione piu' che abbondante.",4,2011,03,27
222,Preis/Leistung o.k.,"Aufgrund einiger Berichte über die Roxford Lodge buchten wir ein Zimmer in diesem Hotel. Vorab: Es ist hier über die neuen Zimmer oder die Sauna im Zimmer zu lesen - das stimmt nur bedingt! Ich würde dem nur halb zustimmen, denn nur ca. die Hälfte der Zimmer sind auf neuem Niveau!!
Mein Zimmer war noch ein ""altes"", sprich mit kleinem Fernseher und ohne Infrarotkabine. Das Zimmer meiner Kollegen war bereits ""renoviert"" und mit allen beschriebenen Goodies ausgestattet.
Vom Hotel aus sind es wie bereits beschrieben ca. 15-20 Gehminuten zum Zentrum, der Linienbus (ca. 1,50 EUR) hält allerdings direkt vor dem Hotel.
Alles in allem war der Aufenthalt ok, das Personal (=die Inhaber) sehr bemüht und die Zimmer auch einigermaßen sauber. Trotzdem würde ich das nächste Mal wohl eher etwas zentraleres zum gleichen Preis vorziehen...",4,2010,08,02
222,Sehr gutes Hotel nahe der Stadtmitte,"Ein bisschen klein sind die Räume schon, dafür allerdings üppig ausgestattet. Zum Zentrum sind es 10 Gehminuten, aber wem das zuviel ist, für den hält der Bus auch vor dem Haus (auf der anderen Straßenseite natürlich wegen des Linksverkehrs).

Ansonsten ist die Lage sehr ruhig, von den Nachbarn war nichts zu hören. Wir können das Roxford Lodge nur empfehlen.",5,2010,07,29
222,Sensationell,"Wow. Wo ein üppiges Zimmer habe ich für diesen Preis noch nie gehabt und ich reise oft...Klar, nicht alles war auf dem absolut letzten Stand der hypermodernen Technik (man wird wohl demnächst ein wenig renovieren), aber wo hat man schon Sauna, Whirlpool, Himmelbett, 2 Flatscreens, 6 Telefona uvm. in einem Zimmer (eigentlich kleine Wohnung) für diesen Preis? Ein 20 min Fussweg ins Dubliner Zentrum oder mit dem (etwas unüberschaubares System) Bus...",5,2009,11,02
222,io mi sono trovato bene,"Ma avendo visto le vostre recensioni mi sono preoccupato di riservare una stanza ristrutturarta. Che dire ci hanno accontentato, anzi la prima sera eravamo in una stanza al piano terra piccola ma aveva tutto pure sta famosa sauna. Il giorno dopo ci hanno dato una stanza al 1p molto grande e sempre ristrutturata. Ottime le colazioni, perfetto il parcheggio se andate in macchina soprattutto nel we (perchè la sosta a dublino si paga dal lun a l ven fino alle 19), le stanze (le nuove) sono eccellenti e dotate di tutto, praticamente un 4 stelle. Se siete appiedati calcolate un 15 minuti di camminata per il centro.
Noi abbiamo quindi riscontrato un eccellente rapporto qualità prezzo.",4,2009,09,01
222,Hotel delizioso,"Bellissimo Hotel a neanche 15 min dal centro città. Le camere sono pulite, spaziose e arredate con un gusto tipicamente irlandese. 
Noi avevamo una camera da 4 con letti enormi, una sauna nella stanza, bagno molto grande con doccia e jacuzzi! Il servizio è sempre stato eccellente e le ragazze alla reception sempre gentili e disponibili a ogni nostra richiesta. Il quartiere in cui è situato è molto carino, a 5 min dalla National Gallery e dalla stazione della Dart. Davanti all'hotel c'è una fermata del tram e a pochi metri quella dell'Aircoach...più comodo di così.... 
Martina",5,2009,03,14
222,Adecuacion perfecta a las expectativas creadas,"Nos gustó mucho. El hotel está muy bien comunicado, el autobús del aeropuerto nos dejó en la puerta y hay una parada enfrente del hotel con  varios autobuses que te llevan al centro de Dublín. Reservamos una habitación familiar paa cuatro, Ibamos con 2 niñas de 8 y 11 años que quedaron encantadas con la habitación, y el baño amplio, limpio, con jacuzzi y unas camas muy cómodas también.Además disponía de una pequeña mesa con su servicio de té muy agradable. A unos 7-10 minutos caminando del hotel hay una zona comercial con algunos restaurantes,  a la que llegamosel día de nuestra llegada por la noche para cenar.El hotel se ajustó a nuestras expectativas y a lo que  habíamos visto en las fotos.El precio después de mirar otros nos pareció el más adecuado para un presupuesto familiar.Sin duda, lo recomiendo.",4,2008,11,06
222,Andateci,"E' un albergo senza dubbio piacevole e tranquillo. Le signore che si alternavano alla reception sono state sempre gentili, accoglienti e simpatiche. La prima sera abbiamo avuto una camera evidentemente non ancora rinnovata ma subito ci è stato proposto, senza alcuna richiesta da parte nostra, di cambiarla il giorno dopo. Quella vecchia non era niente male, quella nuova decisamente ottima. L'arredamento è sobrio, funzionale. Le cose per farsi tè e caffè in camera fanno sempre piacere, soprattutto quando si ritorna da una lunga giornata in giro. La sauna in camera ci è piaciuta, non abbiamo trovato che togliesse troppo spazio al resto, e in più la camera aveva la porta finestra che dava direttamente all'esterno, molto comoda. L'albergo non è in pieno centro ma la passeggiata di un quarto d'ora è piacevole e la zona ci è sembrata molto sicura, a qualsiasi ora. Direi che in totale il rapporto qualità-prezzo è molto alto. 
Unico difetto: abbiamo chiesto se potevamo tornare insieme al nostro cane e purtroppo abbiamo scoperto che l'albergo non accetta cani. Peccato.",5,2008,06,21
