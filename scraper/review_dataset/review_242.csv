242,Do not book this hotel,No experience booking cancelled at last minute due to taking in refugee for what I’m sure is a fortune. Do not support this hotel when they start taking bookings again as they obviously do not value their customers. Had to rebook elsewhere at extra expense,1,2022,09,04
242,Terrible,I had a booking for 16 people booked here for the upcoming bank holiday weekend. They emailed me this week requesting I cancel the booking because they could no longer accommodate it because the owner has decided to take in Ukrainian refugees (they didn’t mention the massive grant they’d be given to do this). I requested a copy of their cancellation policy on multiple occasions but they refused to provide it.,1,2022,04,16
242,Very Bad Customer Service!!,"I had made a booking for March 27th but on the morning I had to cancel within the 24 hours due to Covid, I have a genetic lung disease so could not take any risks. I am also a stroke survivor and it would have been my appointment with my professor I was travelling for but because of the spike in numbers I was advised not to travel to the hospital. I emailed and assumed due to the pandemic there would be some leniency afforded to guests. To my horror the full amount of €89 was taken from my card without even a phone call. I had emailed before and after cancellation to plead my case but unfortunately you have been very unprofessional in getting back to me in any form. I have complained to IHF, the Ombudsman, Failte Ireland and Booking.com. I would appreciate a reply from the manager at her earliest convenience. 

And also just a note when I called today I was informed that the General Mangers name was Sharon and that she did not have an email even though on LinkedIn if says the GM is Megan Donohoe.

I would appreciate some feedback and definitely some consideration for the Pandemic we are going through and that not everyone has €90 to throw around especially as I am on Invalidity Pension due to my illness'

I have also forwarded a copy of this to Megan on LinkedIn as the receptionist on duty was very wary of giving me the Gmail address which I found quite perplexing for a business in this day and age. also just a note when I called today I was informed that the General Mangers name was Sharon and that she did not have an email even though on LinkedIn if says the GM is Megan Donohoe.

242,Money Stolen Out of Suitcase in Locked Room,"Arrived on Friday afternoon with a group of 9 other lads for a friend's stag weekend. No issues at all initially.  Went out for breakfast, leaving a wallet INSIDE MY SUITCASE containing my entire spending money for the weekend -approximately €185.00 

After breakfast we returned to the hotel  and I found that my wallet of money has disappeared. Did not panic initially as I thought I might have put it somewhere else.  After we came back to the hotel in the afternoon, the two friends I was sharing the room with and I turned the room inside out. No sign of missing cash. Both men let me look in their bags [I would not even entertain the idea] despite them both being out of the room with me at breakfast that morning when the cash went missing. Nothing. 

Reported this initially to the hotel staff as non-accusingly as possible before heading out for the Saturday night. Was told THERE IS NO CCTV IN THE HALLWAYS AND STAIRWELL. Convenient. None of my personal details were taken down (phone #, e-mail address). 

After returning to Scotland on the Sunday, I phoned the hotel on Tuesday and spoke to the assistant manager who, after I insisted, finally took my contact details and tells me this is the first she's heard of it. Six days pass, contacted the hotel again to be told that management had been informed and all they suggested was going to the police. Not before having the brass neck to accuse me of my ""stories not lining up"" mind you. (If I was chancing my luck I would try for more than €185, don't you think?) They also insisted that no cleaners had been in any of our party's rooms, despite them having visited my friend's a floor down. How utterly reassuring that was. 

The 'no CCTV in hallways' factor should be red flag enough to drive you away, but the hotel staff's horrendous handling of a very blatant theft makes this entire establishment suspect. 

Fair to say this ruined the weekend for myself. Draw your own conclusions from the above. I feel it only points in one direction. Otherwise Dublin is a fantastic city full of hospitable, friendly people, making this entire fiasco that much more sad. Hope whoever completely violated myself by rifling through a suitcase to steal money is proud. Writing this as a student, €185.00 is not exactly an ignorable amount. 

If you are looking for a place to stay in Dublin; spend a little more, go anywhere else. You may end up saving yourself cash.",1,2022,03,19
242,Poor,"Staff were ok. Location was great. 

Our room you can tell not much care was given into cleaning it. One of the pillowcases had a stain on it. Bathroom air filter was very dirty and the bath tub overflowing holes were dirty. No hand soap. Asked for an extra pillow but they didn’t have any.",2,2022,02,20
242,Filthy,"Great location - right in the centre of everything.

They have a deal with Arnotts car park that offer secure parking for €12 overnight
Staff were friendly.
 
The hotel wasn’t clearly signed, it’s a door to the left side of the Plunkett bar.

Room wasn’t very clean - some surfaces were filthy and sticky, cups were dirty. Rubbish on floor next to bedside table. Floor was only vacuumed in some places. Bed sheets were clean but the cushion cover and throw were stained. My phone fell down behind the bed and when I moved the bed to pick it up the wall was destroyed.

The toilet hadn’t been cleaned properly and there was pubic hair on the toilet seat.
The windows were dirty and there was a mountain of rubbish dumped outside them.

One bedside lamp didn’t work in the room and the other was missing a shade.
Bath panel in bathroom was cracked.
 
Has the potential to be a great hotel but needs a lot of work and attention.",1,2021,11,23
242,Ok base for night in Dublin,We stayed here for one night on a recent trip to Dublin. Room was comfortable with plenty of space. The hotel is a little dated but this didn’t bother us. Facilities to make hot drinks were also available alongside a tv in the room. The hotel is situated above a bar however we did not hear any noise from below. Location is perfect just walking distance to all the pubs/restaurants/shops. Overall a good base and we would stay again.,4,2021,10,07
242,Astonishingly Rude Reception Staff (Sophie),"Good location not bad value for money but when I specifically request a quiet room I do not expect to be put directly above the A/C unit. When I complained they said we are full we will not refund you.
The little witch on reception who’s face might fall off if she smiled refused to fetch the manager for me. I was eventually told the A/C would be turned off at 9pm.
Great way to encourage customers to come back.",1,2021,09,10
242,Very enjoyable,"Hi, I stayed in The Abbey Hotel, Middle Abbey St Dublin last Tuesday night, it was my second stay in 2 weeks. Although the hotel is not as luxurious as other city centre hotels I can not find fault with it. The lady at reception who told me she is the manager was very nice, helpful and polite. The 2 different rooms I stayed in were clean, had comfortable beds and a good sized bathroom. The best part of the hotel for me is the bar down stairs, the staff, especially Darragh are very helpful and up for a chat and a laugh. The Stout is first class and always flowing. Overall the Abbey is excellent Value for money, for what it is, it is excellent, clean and very customer friendly, it will be getting to see plenty of me and my friends in the future... Keep up the good work folks.",5,2020,08,17
242,Location ,"Great little hotel, perfect location, luas stops a feet away. Very close to shops and bars, all walking distance. Very good value for money, staff very friendly also. Bar downstairs but didn’t get time to try it but will check it out nxt time. ",5,2020,02,20
242,"Really poor, avoid unless no other option","Room was really basic & stank of paint, a single bed and 2 single beds pushed together to form a double which you fell down the middle of if you rolled over in the night. There was no fridge. There was a chair and a small table that had a kettle on it with coffee/tea. There was no cups to use though. TV was small but at least there was a virgin box all be it the picture quality was terrible. Bathroom was a decent size, shower was ok but the bath panel was hanging off and it looked minging behind it.

Main door of the hotel doesn’t close properly so anyone can wander in at all hours. Had some guy at my door at 4am while I was staying there looking for a grinder hookup. Room walls were also paper thin so you can hear everything going on in the surrounding rooms.

Restaurant was also closed for refurb and was unusable so although we booked the room with breakfast we were told it wasn’t available although the pub would give us a small discount if we paid to use that. No refund was offered.

Personal opinion, look elsewhere. There are much better options around the same area for the same price. I won’t be returning here as you can possibly imagine.",2,2020,02,01
242,Excellent hotel,We stayed there 2 adults 2 kids great hotel rooms were lovely bar and restaurant good very close to o connell street and the luas staff very friendly would recommend it it is just accross from arrnotts ,5,2020,01,31
242,Excellent Budget Hotel,Good fast friendly check in and out. Had a lovely warm clean room. Nice bathroom with electric shower. A flat screen tv with a great choice of channels. Stayed one  night and had a lovely stay. Asked for a quite room and got one. Will definitely stay there again.,5,2020,01,17
242,Non responsive,We stayed here in august 2019 for one night. That night a fire alarm went off at 6am due to construction (which was never mentioned to us). We proceeded to head out to reception as we did not know if false alarm or real. There was noone at reception to explain or reassure guests. Once they eventually arrived they just said oh it's not a real one. There was no apology or explanation to any guests. I have since emailed them 5 times to follow up and noone has replied to me once. Do not reccomend as non responsive customer support is ridiculous.,1,2020,01,15
242,Family dinner,"Booked in for dinner on recommendation by a friend. The menu choice is excellent, very Irish and something for everyone. The setting is cozy and comfortable. Staff are friendly and service was great. We loved it and we will be back.",5,2019,12,29
242,Old school hotel in excellent location,"I was getting a little concerned about the range of reviews this place was getting but have to say I saw little of the negatives some folks were reporting

The location is excellent, it can be hard to spot the door in to the hotel as its seems shared with the Plunket Bar... once found, you enter a narrow corridor and go up the stairs to a tiny little reception akin to a takeaway hatch! I got room 203 and it was facing on to the dreaded roof with air con units. The room itself was a handy size, spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Given the time of year I guess, there was no air con noise or foot traffic and I slept like a log! The wifi worked fine.

It's an old building, that's a fact. That won't suit everyone but I paid €80 for a single night and the location was 5 minutes walk from an exam centre I needed to be at. 5 mins walk would have you in Temple Bar, in 2-3 minutes you can be on the Luas, O'Connell Street and a couple of shopping centres... also some Spar shops for grabbing snacks as needed. I did see a door for what looked like a drug treatment centre like some people pointed out but I never felt unsafe, there's a lot of people around.

It was perfect for what I needed, great location!",4,2019,11,13
242,Pleasant stay!,"I was actually dreading coming to stay at this hotel due to the reviews I’ve read by some people on Trip Advisor. And, their reviews couldn’t be more... WRONG. The hotel is a little difficult to find, but the hotel itself is nice and our room was clean, comfortable, spacious and everything was working. The bed was big and had a bouncy and comfortable mattress. The bathroom was clean, tidy with clean towels provided as well as shampoo and soap. And, we had Virgin Media TV in our room. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and the location of the hotel is ideal. The bar underneath the hotel was closed for refurbishment during my stay. Me and my partner only stayed for one night, but we’d stay at this hotel for longer, the next time we visit Dublin. P.S. Don’t believe the reviews that give this hotel a bad review, they’re very exaggerated! ",4,2019,11,10
242,Appointments in Dublin ,"I stayed at the abbey hotel last night with my disabled daughter as we had a late hospital appointment yesterday and an early hospital appointment this morn, it was the worst hotel iv ever stayed in , the tv was broke and I was informed it wouldn’t be fixed , the window wouldn’t close properly and there was cold coming into the room all night , the room was dirty, the bathroom was actually filthy dirty and the shower rail was encrusted with rust and dirt, there was a check in slip from the last guest in the room so it’s doubtful it was cleaned, I barely slept as I didn’t feel safe and then they started drilling at 7.10 this morning so we checked out at 8 this morning so we could go into town to eat before our next hospital appointment , when I complained the guy on reception which was a hatch in the wall smiled and said I know so sorry , it was vile I felt dirty leaving this hotel and have requested a refund tru booking .com",1,2019,11,07
242,Disappointed ,"We stayed three nights and were very disappointed. We did really love the location and the bed wasn’t bad to sleep on. However the toilet barely worked, area noise was a nuisance, checking in was weird as the reception desk was tucked in a closet on the second level, and the bar/restaurant was closed due to renovation.",2,2019,09,28
242,Noisy,"Well located but very noisy with a train/tram our the front and lots of late night revellers passing by until around 5am (on three of the four nights we were there). Hot and stuffy, bathroom very average",2,2019,08,28
242,2 day annual trip,"We’ve just returned from a 2 day stay, this hotel is in an excellent location, the 2 reception staff were friendly throughout, there was a crack in the toilet seat, and the shower was poor, but I don’t go to Dublin to sit in the room!!, I’ve stayed in worse places, all in all next Time I’m in Dublin I will look to book the abbey.",4,2019,08,12
242,Avoid if you want some sleep ,"Arrived in our room to the noise of a jet engine. It was created by huge pipe works from an air condition outside. I asked could I please move room as speaking was impossible over the noise and I couldn’t bear trying to sleep through it. I was told not to worry as it was for a restaurant downstairs and it was switched off at 7. We went out for dinner and returned at 9.30pm and the noise was still going. It finally shut off after 10pm but then the noise of music and revellers could be heard clearly. All went quiet at about 4am. At 5am the sun came up and the seagulls started. The worst night I have ever had in a hotel. If you plan to go out and not come back until 4am drunk, it is fine. Otherwise please avoid. ",1,2019,08,04
242,Dooable,We were only here for one night so it was fine.   If it had been more it would have not been fine.   It has a very central location to the Temple Bar Area.   It is a tiny door to enter but not really a storefront so we walked right past it a few times.  The gal at the tiny desk in the hallway was pleasant and trying hard.    We were allowed to leave our bags as we arrived at noon.   We came back later to check in.    The rooms were mostly clean.    There was a breakfast of an assortment of cereal and rolls which was nice.    The area is boarderline dicey.,3,2019,07,30
242,Amazing location..poor hotel,"The hotel was bad for the price of €240 for one night. The toilet seat was broke, no wardrobe and outdated room. The reception area is a narrow hall. The location was amazing and the staff were very friendly. It was grand for one night for the location but I would not stay for a longer period.",2,2019,07,29
242,Awful ,"The only positive point I have to say about this hotel is the central location. Everything else was a disaster. The receptionist was not at all welcoming and couldn’t count the €305 (ridiculous price for the quality) that we handed her straight away. She said that we hadn’t given her the right amount and kept swapping money back and forth (extremely strenuous and confusing). The rooms were average at best, with marks on the walls and a dirty bath. However the beds were comfortable. The Luas runs outside the door late into the night and the nearby bars are also loud. We had to go into the bar at half 11 to get buzzed into the hotel (24 hour reception they said). We assumed that 12pm is checkout (as is normal in hotels), however at half 11 the maid burst into their room without knocking and starting shouting at us that it was €25 extra for every half an hour we stayed. Would really not recommend!!",2,2019,07,07
242,Things I wish I knew before booking...,The hotel is next to some Meth rehab centers and drug deals and usage happened publicly in the streets on regular occasion at all hours. The breakfast was pitiful at best for a continental breakfast. And the metro runs outside the window at all hours of the night.,2,2019,07,06
242,Feedback from a business person,"As a seasoned traveller and a single person on their own, this hotel is great location for buses, food and shopping. It is clean and staff are lovely. Breakfast is good. This hotel offers very good value for money, highly recommend.",5,2019,06,19
242,Great location,"Stayed for one night on the way to other adventures and it was a comfortable easy stay. The location is close to Temple bar area, restaurants and shopping.  The breakfast was very good. Rooms are clean and comfortable.  The O'Connell Bridge bus stop is nearby for aircoach  to or from the airport...also many other public transit options in the area as well. The following day I took a taxi from the main street nearest to the hotel to the airport and it was reasonable at 23 euros. ",4,2019,05,26
242,Avoid at all costs,"Two days before I was due to stay here I received a message on booking.com from the hotel to say the hotel had been sold and I had been issued a refund for my reservation (€201). I was asked to pay again. I rang the hotel after checking my bank account and told the receptionist that I had not received my refund yet and didn’t feel comfortable paying again. I asked her to send me proof that I would receive my refund, she emailed me a picture of a receipt which showed that my refund had been processed on the 16th of May. It is now the 25th of May and I have not received my refund. When I arrived at the hotel on the 18th of May I was reassured that I would receive the refund so I paid for the room again! I now wish I had not done this. I only stayed here for one night and it was absolutely not worth the €201 I spent. The hotel is run down, grim and dirty! The staff are unhelpful and uninviting. The room I stayed in was quite dirty and there was hair all over the bathroom floor. A short while before I checked out of the hotel, a cleaner barged into my room without knocking or asking could she come in!
Over the past 5 days myself and my father have contacted the hotel several times and have asked them why I haven’t received my refund yet. I was firstly told it would take 5 working days to go through, I was then told by a different receptionist that it would take 15 days to go through. I’m beginning to think I have been scammed so I would recommend steering clear of this hotel!!",1,2019,05,24
242,Nice staff...that's it.,"The staff were very kind and helpful, although they would not allow for an early check in. They brought our delivery right to our room as there was no room service. That being said, everything else seemed to fall flat. The building didn't seem very cleanly, our view was of a cement wall with a pipe, the phone didn't work, and you had to squeeze past the bed to get to the tiny table in the corner of the room. The taps in the bathroom made absolutely no sense to me, as one was hot and one was cold, so there really was no balance.",2,2019,05,20
242,Terrible ,"This has got to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. It’s not even worth £25 per night let alone the disgusting rate they charge! I am sure a hostel is probably far more better and more comfortable. 
As soon as we were allocated our room we seriously wanted to check straight  out. We asked to be moved as a constant very loud noise from the very old generators on a scruffy roof that came from just below us. The view was absolutely disgusting, bins etc plus old horrible buildings directly facing us. No wardrobe? Chipped glasses. Can this get any worse? No valves on radiator to turn down the ridiculous heat coming from them. We had to close the windows to at least try and blank some of the noise out. We then had to go out and buy ear plugs to try and blank some of the noise. When we reported it the staff they said it stops at 9pm????? Yer right I am writing this at 10.00pm  and it is still going full blast. Seriously do not waste your money on this hotel. We have managed to book in at the Jurys Hotel up the road for following night at €185, a little bit more expensive but I am sure a hell of a lot better. We were in room 303 but believe you me I think any room will be as bad? We should have realised when we approached this hotel it was going to be bad. So needs an update, so tired looking. Shabby reception area. That was just like a hatch. I seriously thought for €150 per night we might at least have walked into a reception area? . Be aware the Bar underneath is open to ridiculous hours of the morning extremely loud.Honestly don’t waste your money!!! Get another hotel. If I was to give this a rating from 1-10 it would be -1",1,2019,05,15
242,Very unwelcoming staff ,"We reached hotel 15mins before checkin time and were denied the room as it was not checkin time yet and not even offered to sit and wait in a restaurant or anywhere else,instead we were told to go out and hang around somewhere and come back after 3pm, and also while checking out time they came and were knocking all the rooms who needed checking out..very very unusual practice i came across first time  in all my travels...apart from that the hotel and room was clean and continental breakfast was OK nothing wow about it.  ",3,2019,04,29
242,"Good Value, lovely staff","Stay for one night, lovely hotel, staff were nice, food in pub was fab. good location will be back again. great value. center location to shops. clean hotel, parked car acrossed the road in arnotts which was so handy",5,2019,04,13
242,Good value budget accommodation ,"Perfect location if exploring Dublin for the first time. Located just off O'Connell Street and across the river from Temple Bar this hotel is perfect for shopping, restaurants and pubs.

Just down the street from the Academy and a short walk to the Olympia Theatre you don't have to walk far for entertainment. 

There was a breakfast included in our price and it was continental but more than adequate. 

Rooms were clean and tidy and staff were helpful and friendly. ",5,2019,04,12
242,Dissapointing,"Rooms seem clean but very basic. Disappointing cos on a very cold night, there was no heating at all. We had earlier informed them that there was no heating in the room and had been told that they would either fix it or give us portable heating. When we came in from a night out back to our room, nothing had been done about the heating. We had to go down to reception to ask for any form of heating. After quite some time, we were informed that there would be no heating. We had to beg for a portable heater. Eventually we got one and though we appreciated it, the heater provided was very dirty n damaged. Surely the provision of heating is a basic requirement for a hotel during the cold months! The soap dispensers were broken too and the water pressure was weak. Lucky we only booked for 1 night.",1,2019,04,09
242,Disappointing :(,"Just returned from a long weekend in Dublin and three nights in the hotel. On first appearance everything seemed as expected for a budget hotel but that feeling didn't last long. We noticed when first checking in that the heating was on full and there was no way of turning it down as the radiators had been tampered so that guests couldn't adjust it. We therefore asked reception if someone could come in and turn them off, we were told at this point someone would be up, nothing, we asked again the next morning, that evening, the following morning and again the following evening, each time being told someone would be right up but no-one ever showed. The room was a little dated as expected but little things like the bed side light bulbs were gone, half the plug sockets weren't working all of which we notified reception in case they wanted to do something about it. On our last evening we were offered a new room but this seemed hassle as we only had one night left and would need to pack up everything and haul it to another room for our final night. With regards to location it is within walking distance of pretty much everything, I would be hesitant if you are travelling as a family however as there was a stabbing 50m around the corner on the Saturday evening, about 2 hours after we had discussed it feeling a little rough. All in all it would probably suffice if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in but for anything more I'd look elsewhere.",1,2019,02,25
242,Great location,"This hotel was booked last minute, we saw the location and thought this would suit us perfectly. The hotel does exactly what it says it will on the booking site. Comfortable room, clean and breakfast (toast and cereals) provided all within walking distance of the main attractions and all for a reasonable price. The staff are very friendly, the attached bar is great and they will also store your luggage if you have a late flight.
The down side for us was that our shower did not work properly, we either had to have an adequate flow of water at an unbearably cold temperature or a bearable temperature that barely spat out any water.
All in all I’d say on a budget this hotel is fab but if you’re expecting anything grand it’s not for you. ",4,2019,02,04
242,Great location for coulpes or singles but not for families,"I stayed here with my husband and two children as we were heading to the gaeity panto. The location is excellent and only a short walking distance from all the main tourist attractions and shopping streets. However I paid for 2 adults and two children but when we arrived to the room there was only 3 single beds so the children who are 8 and 11 had to share a single bed. The noise from the streets into the small hours was terrible and made it hard to sleep. Having said that, the beds were clean and comfy and the staff are lovely. I would not recccomend this hotel for families but I would definatly recccomend it for couples or friends without children who want to hit Dublin for a night out or shopping because the location really is brilliant. There is parking available in arnotts which is literally straight across the street and will cost you 12 euro a night. This is also a great location for anyone going to a gig in the academy as it is only a few doors down the street",3,2018,12,30
242,Perfect for a gig and on budget!,"Stayed here for a single night, did not realise that it was a literal stone's throw from The Academy where our concert was! Amazing central location just off Of Connells street and perfect for those on a cheaper budget. Stayed in a triple room on the third floor. Room was clean and exactly as expected. Will definitely be staying again when we have have more concerts at the academy! ",5,2018,12,14
242,Great hotel!,"Only stayed here for the one night & I can definitely vouch for it being a fantastic place for a short stay!
Friendly staff & nice clean rooms too.
Perfect location too, being next to O’Connell street!
We went to a concert in The Academy too, which is literally just 2 doors down so couldn’t be happier with location.",4,2018,12,13
242,Visa ,"We came up for a over night to sort out out visas for China and Xmas shopping, fantastic location for shopping and everything stone throw away, hotel was brilliant staff were lovely and helpful esp the lad behind the bar made killer cocktails will definitely be returning ",5,2018,12,05
242,Nice hotel and staff,The shower in the 4th floor had really low waterpressure. Taking a shower took ages. Nice staff. There was a simple breakfast :) Just take into account that the bar and street noises are really loud but it's the city center so 🤷🏻‍♀️,3,2018,11,25
242,Dirty.,"I hate writing negative reviews, as I think you can find positive everywhere. But besides the awesome location of this hotel, there is absolutely nothing positive to say. This hotel could be so cute - if it was ever cleaned!!! It is FILTHY. And I’m not talking, “oops we forgot to vacuum” filthy, I’m talking months of grime on the bathroom doors, mold on the bathroom ceiling, enough dust on the radiator to fill a shopping bag, receipts from a previous guest on the desk, a dirty tub, etc etc. The travel crib they gave us to put my daughter in was gross - I had to scrub the grime off the sides before I could even consider putting her in it. Every mirror in our room was cracked, the shower leaked so bad that the bathroom floor flooded when we showered and it’s LOUD (that I can forgive given the area and it’s close proximity to so many bars). I wouldn’t at all consider what I paid “cheap”, so I certainly didn’t by any means get what I paid for. This is by far the dirtiest hotel I’ve ever stayed in throughout my European travels.",2,2018,11,25
242,Basic b&b,"Poor hotel for the price it’s as simple as that! Great location (for a stag night).The entrance to the place is a bit hostel looking with a kiosk to check inn at that backs on to the bar next door. Hallways not very clean and for me first impressions last! 
Basic bedrooms,basic bathroom which needs work! No hot water or very limited,poor double glazing that does nothing to keep noise out! And the bar underneath plays loud music till very late! 
I didn’t take breakfast so can’t comment on food but with so much around I wouldn’t bother eating here! Enough said! If this was £50 a night i would recommend it if your in Dublin for a party! But I paid £111 which is not a good price for this hotel, Town centre or not! ",2,2018,11,20
242,A mixed bag,"Based on location, I should rate this hotel excellent, but there are some basic that take away from that score.The Adelphi Bar attached to the hotel is excellent and priced fairly. The menu is limited but the food is well prepared and presented. The rooms are adequate, but there is very little hanging room and no dresser, so our One week stay was a logistics challenge.The mattresses offer minimal back support.  House cleaning is not exceptional (like not cleaning the tub). The bathroom is spacious but had very little shelving for putting out our toiletries. There is little to no control of the temperature. As far as I can tell, there is no air conditioning, so warm weather visits may be a challenge. The continental breakfast is adequate but not exceptional. The staff is friendly and respond quickly to requests.",3,2018,11,12
242,Very good location,"The Abbey hotel is located in the heart of the city centre, surrounded by shops, cafes and restaurants,  just a  short walk from Ha'penny bridge.Very  friendly and helpful staff. Spacious and clean rooms. Good value for the money.",4,2018,11,06
242,Great!!,"Perfect location. Right off the main road, but not much traffic, sometimes the club next door has loud guests outside but it didn’t bother us at all. Staff is super nice!! Our shower had ice cold water, someone came to look at it but they didn’t do anything which was a shame. Had to stick my head under the faucet to wash my hair. Again, inconvenient but didn’t bother me because hey, I was in Ireland. Bar downstairs was great. Location was the best part. Price was great. I would stay here again if I was to return to Dublin.",4,2018,10,08
242,"Cheap, comfy,  central. You get what you pay for.","Excellent location. Cheap, comfortable clean room. Noise wasnt a problem for us, amd we stayed on a Saturday night. Breakfast was included in the price which was a surprise... but we didn't make it down so can't comment. The only negative was the entrance. It's a small door and the bell didn't work so we stood there a while, but had to go into the bar next door to get someone's attention. While checking in, a guy ran out after some bar guests who (I'm guessing) left without paying. Asian guy I believe. He almost knocked me down, but stayed going without even a ""sorry!"" Apart from that, all was good. Don't be put off by the reception. Excellent friendly bar staff. I wish I got the name of the young guy working there last night...we came back about 1 so, you know who you are. Keep up the great service. To finish,  or 5star by a long shot, but clean and comfy. Happy enough,  thanks!",4,2018,09,30
242,Not what I paid for....,"I booked two rooms for September, paying $150 more for my room at $253, than the other room I booked.  When opening the door to our room we were greeted with a tiny room overlooking a rooftop with a noisy air conditioner running.  I went down to reception to complain and the woman at the desk said I was welcome to check out if I wanted. She did not care that I was upset.  The other room that I booked for my inlaws was exactly the same as mine. Go figure.  Breakfast the next day was laughable! The room it is served in, looks like an old storage room.  We were afraid to eat anything. The only good thing about this hotel is the location.",1,2018,09,25
242,"Clean, Comfortable and Convenient for a short stay in Dublin","Although we could not check in till 3 we were ablle to leave our luggage in reception from 10. Check out was quite late at 12 but again able to leave luggage till 5 when receptionist called us a taxi. Receptionists (I think 24 hours) very polite, pleasant and helpful. Room very clean and comfortable for a short stay. Hardly and storage so a longer stay would be difficult. Some noise from bars and air con in bar below so take ear plugs if bothered. Good TV and Wi Fi. Toiletries and in room refreshments a little disapponting but plenty of hot water.",4,2018,09,25
242,Abbey Hotel,"Abbey Hotel is located just off O'Connell street and a short walk to most major attractions.  If you're used to a 4 or 5 star hotel, this isn't for you.  However, if you're just looking for a comfortable bed at a good rate, then consider Abbey.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We needed to book a cab to the airport at 1:00 a.m., and the girl working the front desk took care of that for us. 
Other reviewers commented on the noise, but we didn't experience a problem with noise.  Our room was on the street, but closing the window took care of any noise.  The beds were very comfortable, the room clean, there is TV and WiFi.",3,2018,09,22
242,Fine for a short stay!,"We spent the last two nights of our eleven day trip to Ireland here. The rest of our accommodations were AirBnb’s, and although we prefer that, this hotel serves the purpose as a clean place to sleep after a long day. It is just no way luxurious or 5 star, but for the location it’s great!",3,2018,09,20
242,"Cool little place, but not for everyone.","We found The Abbey on ID90 (airline employee travel site) and the location and price were right so decided what the hell? This type of hotel way outside our comfort zone and rolling up in the cab had us questioning our decision. It’s not luxurious, it’s very nondescript - you need to know where to look for the entry, and it’s small. 

All in all, we really had no complaints about The Abbey. It’s pretty basic, but it’s been updated and very clean. The bar downstairs wasn’t loud at all but on one night there was a lot of street noise until 5:00 am. That happens in many big cities so didn’t bother us at all. A big plus is it’s close to Temple Bar but not in it so you can partake in the craziness and retreat across the Liffey to a more relaxing vibe. The Luas is close by which is another big plus.

The bottom line is The Abbey is a clean little hotel, priced right, and close to everything. If you’re looking for luxury it’s not for you. But with so much to do in Dublin, you won’t be in the room much making it a good option. 

",3,2018,09,16
242,Amazing Location,"This hotel is in an amazing location! We were able to walk everywhere within minutes! Also the second best thing about this hotel was they had 3 single beds for those traveling with friends. After 24 hours of traveling you don't really wanna share your space anymore. The staff was fun and helpful. They have a little bar downstairs that was great. The one thing I'd say for this hotel is it is kind of noisy. With the bar downstairs and the dance club next door, it got loud in the early hours when the drunk people started to go home. The windows do a great job of keeping the sound out but if you want them open it may get loud. But for us we thought it was worth it! Definitely would stay here again!",5,2018,08,27
242,Abbey Hotel,What a fun little Hotel! Landed in Dublin early in morning and made Our way to The Abbey Hotel. The girl was very helpful and allowed us to store Our luggage so we could go explore the City! The Abbey has a wonderful little pub on the first floor where you can sit back and relax or play games. Room was clean. All in all it was a great experience!,4,2018,08,14
242,Perfect hotel for our needs,"Three of us were sharing a room and the room was more than big enough to accomodate us comfortably and very clean. Bathroom was also very clean, only slight complaint being that the shower was not very powerful. We were right above Adelphi's bar so there was a lot of noise at night but we managed to get sleep. Fine and central too. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,08,12
242,Charming ,"Great location for tourists. Why so great? Close to the nearest breakfast restaurants, Starbucks etc.. in between of Guinness brewery and Jameson distillery. 

I give it an average rating because we asked for our luggages and carryons to store. The host had told us to leave our things out in the skinny hallway and that he will take care of it. When we got back a few hours from our tour, our belongings were still out in the hallway right were we left it. 

So, I was under the impression that the host would at least bring our items in to a secluded secured room. Mind you, this hallway was a high volume traffic area were someone can just easily snatch your bag. 

Fortunately, everything nothing was missing. Mr. host please advise your guests, Thank you. 

",3,2018,08,10
242,One night stay in Dublin with work,"Absolutely appalled by the management. After leaving my iPad in the room after check out, I call two hours later to collect it and find it gone. Not only that I am called a liar by the manager. The hotel was okay for a city centre hotel, but by no means ""refurbished"", quiet, nor does it look like the images suggest. 

For £130 a night you don't expect this level of service.",1,2018,07,27
242,Not Ideal,"Beds are clean and comfy. But hotel is badly run down. Leaking roof in dining area. Breakfast is a bit of a bad joke. 
Super noisy from bar and nightclub downstairs. Hard to sleep. Very hot rooms. No fan. Constant cigarette smoke wafting through the place. Good access to dublin city. ",2,2018,07,21
242,Ideally located. ,"This hotel was fantastic. It's by no means a luxury hotel but the beds were comfy, there is a bar/restaurant right downstairs and it's in such a handy location. Stayed with friends as we attended a concert in the city and it was perfect for us. Our room faced the street so was quite noisy but for a hotel in Dublin city centre I think noise is a given. Would stay again if I had something on in the city. Reasonable prices considering high season (July) ",4,2018,07,15
242,Good Location,"Wish I could rate this hotel more, as we had a Wonderful time in Dublin, but wouldn't stay here again. The beds were very clean and bathroom too, with plenty of towels, but the room for 3 adults (3 single beds) was very cramped and claustrophobic and hardly any storage. Very noisy with window open as trams pass by often. I think more for  young people not 3 older ladies. Staff were helpful and friendly too and hotel location was very central . We loved Dublin .",3,2018,07,08
242,"Well located, basic","Nothing special, basic and conveniently located. The room service was poor, since on the second day we were in the hotel the beds had been made poorly. It was also impossible to make the shower change temperature, which meant it was either very cold or very hot. But other than that, it did the job.",3,2018,06,29
242,"Nice room, but can be noisy","The hotel was a little hard to find as it is only a doorway wide at street level, and the attached pub has a different name. The rooms are nice, and well-maintained. My room overlooked the street, and there was considerable noise from the pub downstairs as a result. The level of noise may vary as I was there only one night on a weekend. Easy walking distance to Trinity College, Ha'penny Bridge, Connell Street shopping, and more.",3,2018,06,25
242,"Very poor, not suitable for families","We had booked for a family of four for a one night stay. €242 in total. My wife had rang ahead to check the bed situation a couple of days before we arrived but was told they only did three beds but for an additional fee they could provide a pop up bed. Not ideal but given that it was a busy weekend in Dublin we went with it. They don’t have a car park but have a deal with Arnotts shopping centre car park. It was €12 for over 24hrs and wasn’t bad. 

Upon arrival at the location, it was really well located at the heart of everything but that was the only positive thing about the hotel. We found three single beds in a fairly cramped room with a fold out bed. The room was tired looking with signs of damage all over the place. The bathroom was a reasonable size but again needed refreshed. There was broken pictures which bizarrely had been put back on the wall. The wall had been repainted in patches to cover I assume stains etc but looked like a lazy effort on their part. The ceiling was cracked and looked dirty with lots of collected dust in the vent. The bath was stained. 

To be fair they never in the end charged us for the fold out bed but I would have been better sleeping on the floor as it was rock hard!

The hotel may suit hen and stag parties as its connected to a decent pub but with the levels of nightlife does not suit families. Overall we found it a cramped, rundown room and at the price was not worth it",2,2018,06,17
242,Three nights in Dublin ,"Myself and my friend stayed at the Abbey hotel last week during a trip to Dublin. I had recently stayed in Dublin at another hotel and I must say that this place was a BILLION times better than anywhere else I'd stayed in the city. 

The staff were super helpful and even let us check in early (1pm instead of 3pm). Check out is 12pm which is handy. The rooms are clean, stylish and comfortable. All with teas and coffees and hairdryers. 

The hotel is in the Temple Bar area so no key places are more than a 10 minute walk away. It's in a great central spot, but not so much that it's noisy. 

Would definitely stay here again if I go back to Dublin! ",5,2018,05,19
242,Mr. Michael Villers,"Excellent hotel, reception is on the ground floor, a boon for anyone with limited mobility, four floors of rooms with lift access. Excellent room for our visit, double and single  beds, en suite, clean and comfortable, kettle and tea and coffee available in the room as part of the price. Breakfast extra about 10 Euro's per person, available in the hotel restaurant, 24 hour bar available to residents. Superb service including looking after luggage in reception while waiting for the rooms, about 2.00pm, and looking after luggage again if you have a late flight so that you don't have to drag your luggage everywhere while killing time.",5,2018,05,07
242,Value for Money,Me and Friend were going to a concert in Dublin so decided to look at hotels close to the concert venue and came across the Abbey Hotel! Location was unbelievable less than a 10 minute walk to where we needed to go but also in close proximity to shopping centers and restaurants. The room itself was bigger than we expected with a double bed and single bed. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean as was the accompanying bathroom. The room was also very warm. Also the lighting in the bathroom is A1 for those of you wanting to get ready before a night out or dinner. The staff at reception were all very friendly and accommodating and the check in and out process is very fast which is good if you are in a rush! Will definitely be staying here again and will recommend to others.,5,2018,04,11
242,Good budget hotel,It wasn't a room with a view by any means but the hotel location and price point are excellent. Room was clean and comfortable no real gripes. Service was pleasant. Good hotel bar. Just round the corner from hapenny bridge great for the pubs and restaurants. Only reason didn't get 5 star was room was very warm and the furniture a bit in need of updating. Good comfy bed though and good bathroom.,4,2018,04,11
242,DO NOT STAY HERE!!! WORST HOTEL/SERVICE EVER!!!,"This was hands down the worst hotel we have ever stayed at!  We reserved a room for 2 adults (Husband/Wife) and 2 children (14/9).  When we arrived at the room, there were only 2 beds, a double and a twin.  We asked for a third bed and were told no. When we showed our receipt that proved we had reserved a room for 4 people, we were told that was impossible since the most there rooms accommodate is 3?  The person behind the counter made a very comical way of pretending she was calling the manager while updating her FB.  She then promised she would have another bed delivered to the room, so we relented and went off to our dinner reservation for the evening, assuming a third bed was being delivered.  It never was, and when we returned we asked the new desk clerk where it was and they told us they were out of beds, and they were very sorry.  We were also informed we should of requested a room for 4 people!  
  Now for the rest of the drama.  They advertise that they have parking on site, when in fact they have parking across the street in a public parking garage.  OBTW they do not validate parking and parking our car for the night cost 51 euro.  There was ZERO hot water, the entire hotel smells like stale cigarettes, homeless people are all around the hotel, and the constant noise level from both the streets and the accompanying rooms was way too loud for any of us to sleep soundly.  

This was hands down the worst hotel/service we have every experienced in any of our travels!",1,2018,04,08
242,Perfectly adequate for our needs,"We normally stay a little more upmarket when in Dublin, but happened to find a great deal on this hotel and decided to take a chance. So glad we did! The hotel could not be any better located, right near O’Connell Street and the GPO. On arrival our room wasn’t ready as we were too early. No problem as the hotel kindly offered to look after our bags. On returning we were presented with the bill (a little unusual?) and our room keys. The room itself was a little tired and in need of a spruce up, but considering I am really fussy I was delighted overall as it was perfectly clean and functional and the location and price more than made up for it. More € for spending!  Our room had an awful view but couldn’t have cared less about that - not a problem. We used the bar several times and found the staff to be friendly and accommodating. Drinks appeared mid-range prices. Not the cheapest and not the dearest. Overall a very positive experience and I would book again in a heartbeat. ",4,2018,04,07
242,Very comfortable stay,"I didn't really know what to expect from the Abbey Hotel. My colleague Gina and I were booked in by our host. As I drove into the car park in front of the hotel entrance I recognised the place from a previous visit many years ago: the mock gothic entrance is quite distinctive. The building is jumble of extensions and styles of decor. However, there are some very impressive pieces of furniture on display in the various corridors and quite an eclectic  collection of prints and pictures on the walls. 
We were checked in very efficiently by the receptionist, who also booked our table for dinner in the restaurant. My bedroom was very comfortable and spotlessly clean, but I couldn't find the remote control for the TV. I didn't bother checking with reception though. 
We had dinner in the restaurant. It wasn't too busy. I enjoyed my duck and Gina was impressed with her steak. The service was very attentive. The only disappointing feature was the dessert. Supposedly an apricot creme brulee, the creme was murky! I had to leave it. The raspberry ice served with it was quite tasty. 
Breakfast the next morning was fine but I would suggest they offer cafetieres.
Overall, a comfortable stay and very obliging staff.",4,2018,03,13
242,"Close to Everything! Friendly, Helpful Staff!","Stayed here for 5 nights in late January for a Girls Getaway! Friday and Saturday it was loud as there is a night club next door but it did not bother us. A block in the other direction is a great gin bar, our favorite of the trip! Temple bar, shops and the sights are not to far from the hotel. Hotel was decent for the price (I was not expecting 5 stars and read the reviews before hand) and would stay here again!  Staff was very friendly and helpful...",4,2018,03,12
242,Absolutely horrific communication. ,"I booked a room via booking.com, however needed the room cancelled. I rang the hotel and expressed my worries that my card details had been given and asked was there a possibility I may still be charged. The host explained that this wouldn’t happen and that the booking had been cancelled. Did not explain once that I had to cancel the booking online, so I took it that they were able to do so on their end. Turns out the money was still taken from my account after all, and when I rang to express my worries I have honestly never been spoken to with less manners in my life- not something you’d ever expect within this industry. She was adamant she told me over the phone to do this, but she one hundred percent did not. I definitely would have done so myself had she expressed this information and explained that the money would come out anyway! Obviously a way to catch people out and get their hard earned money. Wouldn’t even dream of availing of the service again and will not be quiet about my experience! ",1,2018,03,06
242,Great Stay!,"Not much to report on but would recommend for the price we paid.

3 girls for our annual Dublin weekend away. The price was right. The receptionist was friendly.

There is a bar next door/underneath which also served breakfast should you need something first thing.

To be honest; a lot of people that go to Dublin don't spend too much time in the rooms. The rooms are spacious, clean and had plenty of plug sockets and mirrors for us to get ready - Perfect!

Would definitely stay again. The photos online are a good representation so no surprises,",4,2018,02,26
242,Loud Music and No Sleep Make Us Crazy,"Have you ever seen Fight Club? Or The Machinist? Great films - both about guys who go mental from insomnia. Well that's how we felt after a weekend of no sleep. 

I'm pretty sure the ceilings were made of Jacobs crackers they were so thin (we were on the first floor). We would have had a better night sleep if we'd taken the duvets downstairs and cuddled up to the massive speakers that blasted music until the early hours of the morning. 

On Friday, as I lay in bed, vibrating from the music from the bar downstairs I thought 'Ah it's the centre of Dublin, they'll turn the music of at midnight.' The hours passed. One o'clock. Two o'clock. Three o'clock. I was rocking in the corner. Four o'clock. Five o'clock... they turn the music down. Not OFF but down. 

So if you're deaf, have a hearing impediment, insomnia or take a shed load of drugs regularly - this is the place for you! 

I will say it is very central, so that's one positive. We also heard the bloke at reception threaten someone on the phone so I think maybe their customer service could be improved? ",2,2018,02,11
242,Horrible ,"Host was a joke! Apartments are cold noisey and disgusting smell. 1 shower wasn't working and every time we used the other one the water was coming through the walls in the room. Not sure what the view looked like from the window as they were so dirty!! It's £500 They hold while you stay or screen shot your card details which is a joke. It's fair to say I will not be back.
Yuk!!

242,Weekend ,Our2 nd. Visit to the abbey  a great stay over in Dublin very city centre location clean and nice room at a great price the downstairs bar is open till 4am so great for a late pint the shopping street is only minutes away ,5,2018,02,05
242,So much noise !!!,"Really nice hotel, very conveniently located in a very central local. But barely slept due to the crazy high level of noise coming in from the street. I had assumed a window had been left open because of how clear the noise from the street was heard but it wasn’t. And we were on the third floor!",4,2018,01,26
242,Useful location,"Used this hotel to stay the night when we were at a gig in the nearby Academy. It is ideal for this, make sure you have water with you, though there is coffee making facilities in the room.
No view, a little in need of modernisation upgrades, not sparkling but not dirty. A perfectly good lift and with bars next door on either side, it has all you could need. A spa weekend you won`t get, adequate accommodation you will at a very sensible city centre price.",3,2018,01,18
242,Mr ,"Had a great night in the abbey hotel  very clean hotel and great value for money  walking distance to all attractions in Dublin city center ... special mention of Richie the night porter and true Dublin gentle man...
",5,2017,12,13
242,"Great price, great room, super location","Stayed here with wife and adult daughter. Room was clean, bathroom large and modern. Lobby is non-existent as such, but it's connected to the bar next door, which is super convenient. Best of all is that the hotel is on the Luas line which makes city traveling so easy. 10 minute walk from Temple Bar if that's your thing (it was for us). Staff was great. Noise from the street was loud in the early morning, but that's what you get when you stay in the city center anywhere. If you're looking for a nice no-frills place to stay, this is it. We'll stay here again.",5,2017,12,09
242,Cheap with awful hygiene ,"The hotel had good placement, we could just walk to Temple Bar and loads of restaurants and shops. It had a nice looking bar attached and the price for the night was low. The room had a standard according to the price. Actually a little bigger than expected, but the view was horrible. Looked straight into another room or down a messy and dirty backyard. However, we were not staying for the view, so that was really no biggie. 

What gave this hotel our low opinion was the (lack of) cleaning. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned for months, there was hair and dust and dirt all over. We actually felt like and did clean the bathtub before we intended to use it, but after cleaning the hope for a nice and warm bath quickly died when firstly the water was only luke warm at it's hottest, and secondly, but most importantly, it was filled with brown dirt floating around in the water! 

The cleaning staff looked more interested in taking cigarette brakes than doing their job, smoking often and for long periods on time just outside the hotel windows, throwing their cigarettes down on the ground below. 

We will not return to this hotel ever again.",1,2017,12,05
242,Cheap and cheerful,"The Abbey Hotel is the sort of hotel I choose when I'm paying out of my own pocket: inexpensive, clean, and well-located. 

My room appeared newly renovated and I had no complaints (except that the toilet paper holder was on the opposite side of the bathroom from the toilet, which made for some fun in the middle of the night.) There was also some noise from a ventilation unit on a rooftop outside, but I always bring earplugs.

The hotel recommended the Gin Palace pub a few steps away, and I liked it so much I went there for both lunch and dinner.",4,2017,11,26
242,Very average. ,"In our first visit to Dublin as a couple we didn't exactly need somewhere too fancy to stay so that's why we decided to book the Abbey Hotel. However upon arrival the room itself was not as good as it looked in the photos and honestly we both felt a bit disappointed. The room just looked shabby and was in need of redecorating, especially the bathroom. The bed and furniture was fine and was actually quite comfortable during the night but as I said before it is very average and for the price we paid expected something a little better.
The receptionist was welcoming and helpful and the cleaners did a good job during the day so no complaints there!
The location of the hotel is good, right in the centre of the city. Just a short walk from transport links and the Temple Bar district and other attractions and shopping areas.
All in all a good hotel but made average by the fact it just looks rather shabby and definitely in need of the rooms having some decorating work done to them. We would stay again if this happened. ",3,2017,11,23
242,Basic but very good accomodation,"Stayed in this hotel recently while visiting Dublin for a gig in the 3Arena. It's basic, we paid for room only (no dinner/breakfast offered but it's within walking distance of a multitude of cafes/restaurants) & could not have been happier. Great value, room was warm & spotlessly clean and staff were really helpful & friendly. Also within walking distance of the city centre & Temple Bar. The 3Arena is about 6 Luas stops away & there's a stop a few minutes walk from the hotel. I've stayed in basic accommodation in Dublin in the past & been happy but will definitely stay here the next time I need an overnight stay in the city, the best by far. Didn't get to properly check out the bar downstairs but it looked really nice, maybe next time!",5,2017,11,17
242,This hotel is a joke,"We paid the equivalent of over $200 per night for a room that would have failed a Motel 6 inspection in the USA.  There is no lobby, just a blonde in a booth at the front door...which you get buzzed into.  The hotel is accessible directly from the bar ...no security there.  Our room was modern enough but had cracked mirrors, crushed room door, and peeling bathroom wallpaper.  Abbey is on a slightly seedy street but close to Temple Bar, its main redeeming value.  For what we paid this is a joke.",2,2017,11,06
242,"Basic, functional and in a great location","My family and I recently spend a night at the Abbey Hotel, Dublin before flying back to the US.  The hotel is in a great location, well priced and much better than I had expected.  We paid 111 Euro for the night for a room with a king and single bed.  We were at the back of the hotel so the room was nice and quiet.  There was no remote in the room so we had to call down to reception to get one, also no hairdryer which was a little strange.  This hotel seems to be well used and busy.  It was handy having the bar downstairs.  Overall this place is great for an overnight when in Dublin as its located right in the center of the city and around the corner from the GPO and O’Connell Street where all the bus tours stop.  It isn’t a luxury hotel but has the basics needed but nothing else.  I would stay here again.",3,2017,10,24
242,Best place in Dublin for a night away,"Me and my friends went to Dublin for my friends 40th birthday!

Firstly the staff here are very helpful and kind! They were very happy to help us!

Secondly the location is great! A very short walk away from temple bar and the Guinness factory! 

The rooms were clean and perfect for a night or short stay!

We really enjoyed our stay here, the staff were very helpful - they were able to get us wine after 11pm :)",5,2017,10,08
242,Great location and friendly staff,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location of the hotel was great, with only a few minutes walk to temple bar. There were also plenty of shopping and restaurants in the nearby area. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The room was cleaned every day with fresh towels and sheets and tea refill. 

What keeps the grade low is that the room didn't quite meet up to a good standard. The pressure in the shower was so bad, I had to wash my hair in the washbasin. The shower also only had two temperatures, freezing cold and boiling hot. 
We had no remote to our tv. The staff did find us one after searching around their drawers for a while, but it turned out to be broken. The tv didn't have any buttons, so we couldn't turn it on manually either. One of the bedside lamps was broken too and sometimes the toilet didn't flush. Our keycards stopped working at one time too, but that was immediately fixed. There was also a lack of power outlets next to the bed. 
We did, however, enjoy our stay at abbey hotel, mostly because of the staff. ",3,2017,10,07
242,Fantastic Location,We booked this hotel for its location. The rooms were clean and the staff were accommodating with holding our luggage until our rooms were ready. We travelled with 11 people (family) and were glad to all be together. The staff were lovely but double check the directions they may give you to different landmarks. The parking is an issue and if you are unfortunate enough to need to park a car in Dublin you will need to use Arontts or Jarvis...$$. On-foot this location if ideal! We were happy taking taxis to/from Guinness but everything else is a walk.,4,2017,09,29
242,Great Location but basic,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Its nothing flash but at about €140 per night its not what Id call real value but its comfortable, friendly and right in the  heart of the action.
I suppose my biggest gripe would be the lack of water pressure in the shower as I love a nice hot, strong shower.
Theres no breakfast served but theres a plethora of places within easy walking distance with cost around €10 pp.
Theres a bar downstairs and I had my first Guinness in Ireland there. It went down well.
Theres trams at the door, buses and trains in easy walking distance.  This is imperative as you dont want a car in Dublin. Theres nowhere to park and traffic is horrendous.
We stopped here as our first stop and then hired a car on leaving to travel around the rest of the country",3,2017,09,19
242,Top class accommodation ,"Had a fantastic experience in the Abbey Hotel! Staff were exceptionally friendly. The atmosphere is brilliant no request is to large or impossible!  It was by far the highest level of customer service I have received from as hotel in a long time!! I will definitely be back! Great location central to everywhere with a choice of numerous luas stops a stone's throw away! Would definitely recommend this hotel when looking for a place to stay in Dublin, I know I will be recommending it to all. I have to give a special mention to Richie who endured a fantastic night was had by all ",5,2017,09,11
242,Not sure where the pictures were taken,"Our experience with the Abbey Hotel didn't match the photos shown here.  This is a very average collection of rooms in an old building.  Nothing terrible.  It's clean and VERY conveniently located.  But, the rooms are quite small, the lift is slow and it's not that cheap.
I repeat, there is nothing really wrong with this place, but there is nothing special either.  The bar downstairs is fun.  And, I repeat, the location is very convenient for visiting Dublin.  Easy walking to all the main downtown attractions.
Tip, don't pay the hotel 10 Euro for breakfast.  They send you to a cafe down the road, where the most expensive item on the breakfast menu is 9 Euro.",3,2017,08,19
242,not a hotel,"This is not a hotel, it is a selection of clean bedrooms. No restaurant at all, no breakfast facilities. The reception is very hit and miss, if you get the girl and ask her something [ train times etc ] she is very helpful, however if you get the young man just forget it and ask somewhere else. It is very central but too far to go for breakfast, the best is Annes Bakery two streets away. Would not use it again.",3,2017,08,11
242,Convenient-average rooms.,"Didn't know what to expect-never been to Ireland. Seemed expensive for the size of the room, but I think that's just Dublin. Pluses: we could walk everywhere, beds were fairly comfortable, rooms were clean. Minuses: staff not very friendly, room was so hot we couldn't sleep-one fan that couldn't be moved very easily. Some oddities...our house phone was not connected-chord severed. When we asked to have it fixed-no one ever came up.",3,2017,08,02
242,Really good location but pricey for what you get,"This is not an easy review because there are pros about this place although I wouldn't choose to stay here again. It is dated but clean. It is in a very convenient area where you can walk to most everything with the farthest location being 20-30 minutes  (Guinness Tour, St Stephens, Zoo, Graftin Street, Trinity College, etc). I felt like it was too expensive for the room. We had a triple room (two adults and two kids) and it was small, a bit hot and right above the bar. The tram goes by on Abbey St which wasn't too bad but in the end, it isn't worth what we paid.",2,2017,07,26
242,Wonderful area,"We chanced upon this hotel after our original hotel failed to meet our expectations. Sharon the Manager, warmly greeted us and immediately went to work finding 2 rooms for us for the week at a very resonable price. We had the best stay in a fabulous area because of the hospitality of Sharonville and Richie D. They made our Vist enjoyable. Of course having the pub downstairs was very convenient for food and drink, mostly drink...lol. Clean comfortable rooms with fans and windows that open for a nice Dublin breeze. We honestly did not experience noise from the pub downstairs at any time. We were on the 3rd of 4 floors. They offered us umbrellas when it rained, converter outlets so we didn't need to buy any which by the way they have in the lobby if you wish to buy along with lots of brochures so you can find many many things to do, and they were always interested in your day when you came back. Such nice people. Bagel shop with great sandwiches and coffee on the corner as well as a Marks and Spencer(wonderful food store)across the street. 5-7 min walk to Temple bar area. 1-2 min walk to O'Connell street and the Hop on Hop off yellow bus stop. Everything was close by. The best part about our stay was the staff, we'll definitely be back. Thank you.",5,2017,07,22
242,Great location,"We stayed at the Abbey hotel as a family. Rooms good and clean. Fantastic location, friendly staff. Full Irish breakfast at the cafe down the road was solid. Some noise from a bar down the road on the Saturday night. Overall a good place to stay and well priced.",4,2017,06,13
242,Not good,"There is nothing redeeming about this place. I did not pick this but for the price it's shocking. No breakfast, noisy fans. A room above a pub basically. Key cards did not work, shower poor, area not great.",1,2017,06,08
242,My Second Stay -- Even Better,"We stayed in the Abbey Hotel last year (2016) and thought it was a great spot, but it appears that the hotel has gone through some renovations and is that much better. Again, it is not an Hilton or Hyatt, but it is very quaint, very clean, with great people working there. It also has a fantastic location close to Temple Bar and across the street from a shopping center (if that is your thing). It is walking distance to almost everything to see in Dublin, and, of course, it is adjacent to a bar and restaurant ... if you don't even want to leave the premises. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this place for visits to Dublin.",5,2017,06,04
242,Very central and friendly ,"We stayed here when we came to a gig at the academy only a few doors down. I was rather concerned at the proximity and noise but was pleasantly surprised I heard nothing from the venue at all. The location is perfect - so close to everything, particularly temple bar which is only a minute or so away (ideal in the wee hours of the morning). 
The bar attached is lovely, really cosy and welcoming. The staff were also all very helpful and friendly, the receptionist held our luggage after check out so we could look round Dublin a bit more until our bus to the airport. The only small down side was the size of the room but it was extremely clean and modern and had everything we needed.

I would recommend to anyone, thanks for a great stay! ",5,2017,05,25
242,"Cozy hotel, great staff","The room was small but clean and comfortable. Being in the center of a city I wasn't expecting a large room anyways. Staff was very friendly and held our bags for us when we arrived at 10am the day of our check in so we could walk around. 

We were on the fourth floor so noise from the street wasn't an issue and we were within a good walking distances from restaurants, shops and public transportation.",5,2017,05,22
242,Cute and dainty ,"We arrived from the airport at half 11 so we needed to stay overnight in Dublin. It was the cheapest hotel on booking.com but actually delighted when we landed! It didn't look like a hotel but by god it was simple out which I love! I think there was only 9 rooms but the place was cool. The bar was open to residents til 4. The bar was so adorable, it had fluffy rugs and fluffy covers over the chair. The guy running the bar was walking round in his socks, made it all the more chilled. Deffo would return!!",5,2017,05,20
242,Pleasant but noisy,"We visited Dublin as we were going to a concert. It just so happened that the rugby was on so accommodation prices were astronomical as such, we paid 240.00 a night  
 room only for this hotel (even Hostels were 140.00) , which is probably why I wasn't blown away by it. Having said that, the pub downstairs is lovely, the staff were lovely, the room was clean and up to date. Location was excellent.  If the room had been £80 a night I would have said it was  very good - it just wasn't worth £240!.  The problem and boy is this a big problem is actually not the hotels fault. Its located right next to an O2 Academy type place and the noise is almost unbearable and goes on throughout the night. Don't get me wrong you expect a bit of noise, but this was insane. Didn't sleep a wink on the Saturday night and I can sleep through just about anything.   If you do stay, then ask for a room at the back!!",3,2017,05,19
242,Not a good experience!,"The staff was friendly but the room was lacking.  Someone had attempted to knock the door in so there were large chunks out of the door.  The bathroom mirror was missing, the vanity glass shelf was missing, and the large mirror in the room had been damaged.  They said there was a hair dryer in the room but we could not find it.  We mentioned the lack of a bathroom mirror and were told one had been ordered.",1,2017,05,13
242,Central location and comfortable rooms,"The Abbey Hotel was a great place in central Dublin.  Once you find it, as it's only a door-front wide, the folks at the front desk were personable and helpful.  The rooms are clean and well maintained.  It's location is the best aspect as it's only footsteps away from the Ha'penny Bridge, the Temple Bar area and O'Connell Street.",5,2017,05,04
242,Great stay,"We stayed here in a large group for 4 days and had a great time. Good location with everything in walking distance, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Will be coming back again and thanks for a enjoyable stay ",5,2017,05,03
242,Great central hotel!,"This hotel is great in many ways. Easy check in, easy check out, and friendly and helpful staff. The room is perhaps not very spacious, but it was fresh and clean and comfortable. The best thing, in my opinion; our window faced a backyard - which meant it was quite! There was however a ventilation pipe just outside, but I found the humming more comforting than disturbing. No problem sleeping at all. The hotel is central, just two blocks down you hit the Ha'penny bridge which leads you straight up to the Temple Bar area. And if you walk one block the other way, you land on the main shopping street. The bar was very cozy. Only tried lunch there, but it was great.  There's just one downside: no breakfast served here (althogh it says so on the information note given with the key card to the room). Apart from that,this is a perfect hotel if you're just out for a great, quite place to sleep.",4,2017,04,27
242,Fantastic,Fantastic hotel been there 3 times and each time its blew me away food excellent rooms modern and clean the staff there friendly nothing to much trouble the entertainment is excellent bar staff and waiters and waitresses are great love this hotel x,4,2017,04,18
242,Great base,"Hotel booked for the Welsh  footy match. Great base from where to reach all the main areas.
Clean rooms, easy check in and had no issues at all.
Would I recommend - Yes, would probably look at this hotel next time I am in Dublin.",4,2017,03,27
242,Heather not working,"Room is cold.rang reception,he say heather on timer but we can feel pipe is hot just the rad is cold.cant turn on the rad cuz the radiator value is missing.bathroom ceiling the paint is feel off.beside table lamp bulb is blow up.very hard to in and out..need some at the reception all the time to open the ent.door.only this about this hotel good location.",1,2017,03,09
242,Friendly and clean hotel,"This was a friendly hotel away from the tourist part of Dublin but close to it all. The hotel was clean, and well taken care of. The host/bar keeps we're extremely friendly, helpful, and personal, like we'd known each other for years. 

However, the bathroom shower was less than desirable...it has this water pump/heater that takes a bit to warm up and only puts out a trickle. It was my first time in Ireland so maybe they're common.  

Also, the hotel was near a big night club. We didn't hear the music on the club, but all the young adults waiting in line to get in was pretty irritating. But it was only during Friday and Saturday night. 

Overall a good deal for the location. The friendly staff really made the best impression for our stay. 

",3,2017,02,21
242,Weekend. Visit,Great little clean place  right in the heart of Dublin 2 minutes walk to the centre  probably better than you would expect for the low price.  Clean friendly rooms towels and bathroom nice little bar downstairs and  very close to the main shopping street ,4,2017,02,20
242,Overnight stay for concert,"Was not expecting much for the price we paid , but was pleasantly surprised room was clean and comfortable, and a big enough flat screen on the wall with plenty of channels if you want to watch a bit of tv. Staff were very hospitable there was no iron or hair dryer in our room within 5-10 minutes of notifying reception we had one in our room. Very central if you are doing a bit of sight seeing around the city, we were at a gig in vicor street which was a 15-20 minute walk which was fine all in all I would recommend this hotel for value and location.",5,2017,02,16
242,Great!,"Lovely atmosphere, great staff. Very clean, bar downstairs was lively + not too noisy. Looked after us very well, provided useful information about the area. Would recommend for both small and large groups, reasonably priced and very central",5,2017,02,06
242,Great location ,"Stayed here in January and I don't have anything to complain about. Beds were comfy, room was a good size and the shower pressure was great. Great location if you want to go to temple bar! We couldn't hear any noise at night at all. ",5,2017,01,31
242,Perfect for a short break,Had a lovely time here with friends. The rooms were affordable and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was just ok but it's definitely a great option for a short break in Dublin. Perfect location too!,5,2017,01,30
242,"Good location, friendly staff","We had a great two day stay at this hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and big enough. Only complaint - and this is only if you are looking for something to complain about - is the water pressure in the bathroom.The elevator is a plus. We loved the location. It is very close to a Main Street and a short walk to the city center. It was great to get out of the extreme hustle and bustle, but still have all the convenient shops around at the end of the day. Loved the street view in the morning and the sound of seagulls. Would return happy customers.",5,2017,01,27
242,Very friendly staff,"The lovely staff at reception made our stay unforgettable. They were always eager for a chat and happy to help out and ensure we had everything we needed. Great central location, rooms were clean and comfortable, not a lot of space tho and the shower was a little out dated. Overall a great hotel for a short stay in Dublin. ",5,2017,01,11
242,An irresponsible hotel,"I booked a night in The Abby Hotel in Dublin for a night on 26 Dec 2016 through booking.com on 4 July 2016. My boyfriend phoned in advance on 25 Dec to confirm but it directed to a full phone message box. We arrived at around 1:30pm 26 Dec 2016 and the front door of hotel was closed. No one answered the call bell in the front door. I thought the check-in time was 3pm and so stayed in a nearby Startbucks till 3:10pm. We then phoned the hotel twice again but it directed to the full phone message box again. Then we came to the Abbey Hotel, and kept ringing the door bell, and no one answered. This really made me frustrated and unhappy. Finally, I decided to find another hotel for my stay. I were very worried that I could not find a hotel to stay in late afternoon. Luckily, We walked in to a nearby hotel, Wynns' Hotel, with cheaper price and better services. 
It's my first time to have such a bad experience through the website. I made a compliant email to booking.com and they responded to my email immediately. I also forwarded the complaint email to that bad Abbey Hotel. It's surprised that I got the feedback ""We wish you all a Happy Christmas.  We are currently closed for the Christmas Holiday's and will re-open on 30th December at 9am."" I think this Abbey Hotel is very irresponsible. They should inform me if they know that they will close their hotel during Christmas. But they didn't. Please don's trust them!",1,2017,01,10
242,Value for money,"The staff is friendly and the location is very convenient for visiting the city, however it is not worth the money they ask for as the hotel is old with old and not too clean bedroom. The new hotels nearby cost the same and provide much more. I would not recommend it",2,2017,01,03
242,Quite bad,"Stayed in Abbey hotel over a long weekend. The room was extremely warm, and the radiator could not be turned down. If you opened a window you could not sleep due to the horrid nois the airconditioners made right outside the window. The rooms walls were full of stains and shoe/luggage marks. The bathroom seemed clean at first but after a better look that too was a huge dissapontment. The shower did not work, there was dark moldlooking stains around the bathtub and the bathroom allaround felt dirty. Only reason i dont give this place 1 star, is the location. ",2,2016,12,28
242,“I will be back so very soon”,The staff at the Abbey are by far their selling point for me. Shout out to Richie for making us our Hot Whiskeys. The bar downstairs is so lovely and a great atmosphere. The location of where the hotel is situated is amazing. Temple Bar is minutes away. Room was lovely and I was really impressed with what we paid for it. All in all one of my best stays. So close to the bus station and everything really. Planning my next trip back as I type,5,2016,12,16
242,"No frills, no thrills, just pure basic","Best is the location, just a five minute walk from the Liffey, cross the bridge and you're in Temple Bar. The hotel reception is minor, a hole in the wall essentially, but we were met by a nice young lady there, check-in was quick and efficient. Our rooms were on the 1st and 2nd floor, and they have an elevator. Rooms were clean, clearly renovated not too long ago. Baths ok, but the shower in the other room produced only cold. Breakfast, in addition to the normal coffee, tea, cereals is the Irish, full or half, and to most I'd say the half is more than sufficient. All tasty and good. Then, the bad: especially on the 1st floor you're actually more or less next and on top of the bar, and the house was built before insulation became the thing. So, on Saturday there was a Christmas party going on, and the noise was horrible. Otherwise, all-in-all, a good basic hotel conveniently located, brilliant for exploring central Dublin. ",4,2016,12,12
242,Perfect for concerts,I stayed in this hotel when in Dublin for a concert in the Academy. You could see the line from our window! Great location for us and for shopping before the concert. It can be a bit noisy with the Luas but you can't complain with such a central location. ,4,2016,11,26
242,Great Location and Friendly Staff,"Great location with easy access to top attractions, nightlife and bars. 

The rooms are basic but I was here on a stag weekend and we had no intentions on staying in our rooms when you're in this vibrant city! 

The full Irish breakfast in the morning is fantastic! ",5,2016,11,06
242,Fits only for night owls,"Staff very friendly, room clean but we couldn't change the temperature of the heating, therefore the room was  too hot. As in the nearby Academy is nearly every night a concert or two, there are hundreds of people in the street talking, shouting, bawling, fighting until 5 o clock  in the morning, much too noisy for a quiet sleep.",2,2016,11,01
242,Good location,"Booked the Abbey Hotel based on positive reviews on here about a friendly welcome and good Irish breakfast. Thought the price was good for the location and the fact that it included breakfast was a plus. Upon checking in we were told our room number, given our key and asked if we had any questions. Friendly welcome obviously not from the guy that served us on that day. Room was okay, mould in the bathroom but clean and warm. When we went down for breakfast we were told we were room only and would have to pay 10 euros each. I showed our booking to say that it said ""free breakfast"", to be fair the waitress at the aldephi was lovely and said she'd check. Sharon the manager just kept repeating that the ""free"" breakfast meant fruit and juice only. It put a bit of a dampener on things as we could have had a much better hotel for the same price and still gone out and paid for our breakfast. Only positive is the location. Spend your money elsewhere. No friendly words on check out either",3,2016,10,26
242,OK for one night,"I stayed here for one night in October with my mum. The photos on the website look really nice and the hotel was alright but not exactly what I was expecting. I knew the hotel was above a pub but I don't think it can call itself a 4-star. The room was fine but the radiator wasn't working, I asked the staff to look at it, which they did, but they gave me no immediate solution. We decided to have dinner in the pub, the menu on the website has nothing to do with what was offered to us downstairs - hamburgers and nachos basically. The staff were nice and friendly and the breakfast was very good but I don't think I will be going back.",3,2016,10,22
242,Worn Dirty Noisy Overpriced,The walls are filthy. The baseboards are rotted. The carpets are matted with dirt. No sheets on the bed between comforter and bottom - and they do not replace comforter covers between stays. Noise from adjoining bars and clubs is abominable. Staff is indifferent. The only way it seems to survive is by preying on uninformed newcomers to Dublin who want to be near O'Connell street and those who do not want to sleep. Type of hotel that NYC removed from Times Square thirty years ago. ,1,2016,10,21
242,Brilliant location,"Stayed here for a few days with friends, this hotel is in an amazing location being less than a 5 minute walk from O'Connell street, for shopping and less than 10 minutes from Temple Bar. 
The rooms were basic, but a good size and clean. 
Breakfast was included in the price, but we didn't go down in the mornings. The only downside of the hotel I could mention, was that you have to ""buzz in"" at the main door. Although reception staff were there 24 hours, they could take some time opening the door. An main access key or an access code would prevent this. But apart from that, I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again on my next trip to Dublin. 
",5,2016,10,17
242,Great central location,"This was a quaint hotel. You can easily walk past it, not knowing it was there since it's tucked between shops and pubs. The room was nothing special, but it was nice to have a king sized bed. It was located in a great location, short walk from everywhere we wanted to go, including the Temple Bar area. ",3,2016,10,11
242,Hen weekend ,"What a gem of a hotel! Very authentic, clean, cozy and friendly! There were 11 of us for a hen weekend and it couldn't of been more central! Perfect location, VERY reasonably priced. The Irish breakfast was always quick and delicious, very accommodating staff. Will definitely be staying again!",5,2016,10,04
242,Perfect for a visit of Dublin …,"We visited Dublin with a club of 27 persons. We stayed for three nights in the Abbey Hotel. The location of the Hotel is perfect. It can’t be better. It’s very close (less then 5 minutes walk) to Trinity College, Temple Bar and so on. And nevertheless silent in the night. OK, it’s in the middle of a city but for this very silent.

The rooms are clean and all what you need is in also in the bathroom. The space is OK and the beds are good. All what you need for a short trip to a city.

The full Irish breakfast is good and the stuff friendly and uncomplicated. Beside the Hotel is a pub which is a part of the Hotel and where you have the breakfast. You can also eat something or only drink a pint. It’s open till late and perfect if you come back from Temple Bar to have a last drink for bed .

In our group are 9 ladies and all told me the Hotel is very good, so we all can recommend it. We got what we expected.  If we come back to Dublin the of course to the Abbey Hotel.

Best regards from Patrik",4,2016,09,28
242,"Excellent location, room and service.","Stayed for one night in room 406 on the fourth floor of the hotel in a luxury double room.
The room was at the back of the building and was very quiet,  it was spotlessly  clean,  a good size with a comfortable king size bed and also a single bed. The en suite was also a good size with a power shower. 
We didn't use the in- house bar and restaurant  so I can'tcomment on that.
The breakfast was well cooked and presented well and the waiting on staff were effecient and pleasant. The reception staff were excellent and very helpful,  we were able to drop off our bags on arrival until check in and also on departure which was a big help.
Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,09,22
242,Great location in heart of Dublin,"The Abbey Hotel was great for our family of 3. The staff were very friendly and helpful, allowing us to store bags there, and then to check in early. They offered a very roomy 1-bedroom apartment down the street. Breakfast was phenomenal -traditional Irish style. We could easily walk to all of the main attractions, including the GPO, Trinity College, St Patrick's cathedral, and the Guinness storehouse.",4,2016,09,15
242,"Lovely hotel, Fantastic service. ","I had such a lovely stay at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised considering it is only a two star on trip advisor. Rooms were clean, not too small, bathroom was lovely and clean too. Wifi was very good. It's location is fantastic, especially if you are a tourist. I hadn't a single fault with my stay. 

The service was without a doubt it's best asset for me. Megan, in particular, went above and beyond for me. Photocopying, getting me an iron & thanks to my stupidity, is now posting my phone charger out to me as I left it behind. She was so pleasant, friendly and helpful and it really went a long way as I was stressed and preparing for an interview. 

I will definitely be recommending this hotel to others looking for a stay in Dublin city :-)",4,2016,09,08
242,Don't go There,"We stayed there one night as we were passing through Dublin, and I wouldn't have stayed another one, if you want to sleep your head against the fan of the a/c it's the perfect place to go!!!
The room was ok, but the noise of the a/c outside was terrible and it must affect not only the room we were staying in but all the rooms on this courtyard.",1,2016,09,05
242,Horrible Experience,"After trying to contact management twice and being ignored both times I'm forced to write this review. I went up to Dublin with the intent of visiting a concert and unfortunately last minute it was cancelled (I understand this is not the hotels fault). Aware that the hotel was expecting us we decided to let them know we wouldn't be staying the night and hoped to work out a compromise that would benefit us both with the circumstances. Upon arriving we were greeted by a nice secretary that in fairness, tried to help by approaching her supervisor multiple times trying to explain the situation. While they spoke in another room, my friend and I could hear her talking. She was being extremely blunt and even called us stupid. They reminded us that on the website that it says you need to give 48 hours notification to cancel as there is a fee that must be paid to the third party booking site. However we booked directly through the website which means they wouldn't have paid any third party site. While I completely understand the need for rule like this in a business I just wanted to reorganize or happily would have paid a fee that was more fair not €170 for a room i did not use. As the manager was not there that day I called the following two days and both times I was ignored. As a student every cent counts and if you don't agree with this behavior I'd suggest giving this hotel a miss.",1,2016,08,27
242,Fantastic location ,Just off O'Connell street - you could not get any more central. Tram stops just a few yards away. Rooms are clean & comfortable. Breakfast is huge and very yummy!! Staff are all really helpful and friendly and nothing was a problem. They booked us a taxi for the airport and kept our cases all day. Definitely stay here when we visit again. ,4,2016,08,19
242,"Mostly great, but....","This hotel is in a great location, close to temple bar just over the ha'penny bridge. There is a night club next door but we didn't hear it in the hotel. The staff are friendly and happily stored our bags the day we arrived and left. The rooms are spacious and even with 3 girls staying in a room we had plenty of space. BUT the one thing that really let the hotel down was the very dirty bathroom, I am fairly certain it had not been cleaned with lots of hairs on the walls, in the bath and sink. Brown stains in the bath and sink, and a radiator that looked like it was covered in mud. The floor was also dirty with bits and marks. In hind sight we should have complained but as we were only there over the weekend it didn't seem worth the hassle.  ",3,2016,08,15
242,Lovely hotel in Central Dublin,"From someone who has been born and raised in Dublin, going to hotels in Dublin isn't usually my thing. I had no idea where to book when my friends from the USA came to visit so I did some research. I came across this hotel and decided to book it for it's location. When my friends and I arrived at the hotel, we were really unsure as to what to expect. To my delight however, the hotel turned out to be a real treat. The staff were lovely and very accommodating. The rooms are bigger than you'd expect, very clean and decent layout. The location is just perfect, right in the middle of everything and right next to a good pub for a pint. Overall, I'd definitely book and recommend this hotel to friends and family in the future. Really great value for money.",5,2016,08,10
242,Central Hotel,"Very central hotel which is ideal for night out  or shopping. Rooms are quite small but very clean. Although the staff are very pleasant and friendly there isn't enough of them, we were waiting at reception 20 minutes after ringing the bell 3 times before someone came to check us in.  And again at Breakfast there was just one waitress covering the breakfast area the poor girl was run off her feet, she did her best too look after everyone and she should be highly commended for it but it's not good enough when you have a breakfast room full of people. Breakfast is cooked fresh per guest which is fantastic but with one waitress you will be waiting.",3,2016,08,10
242,Great Hotel for Central Dublin.,I recently stayed here with my daughter for one night.  Very comfortable and safe.  Spacious room and very clean.  Staff very friendly and welcoming.  The night porter was excellent.  He made our breakfast early for us and made sure we got our tour bus outside the front door in the early morning.. Ideal if you are travelling with pab tours.  The collection point is just next door.,4,2016,08,06
242,Lovely little hotel.,"This hotel is right in the centre of town and within walking distance of most attractions, it was a very friendly place with staff who were very helpful too.
On the downside, our room was on a busy main road with traffic noises all through the night, if we kept the window closed the room was airless with no air conditioning only a fan, this was the only fault we could find.
 The Irish breakfast was delicious and really set us up for the day.",4,2016,07,28
242,Nice hotel,The hotel is well located for all the local nightlife and restaurants. The breakfast is fantastic with really good quality ingredients. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was clean enough tho could be cleaner. On a very busy road so lots of traffic and tram noise tho we still managed a good nights sleep as beds really comfortable. Would definitely recommend ,4,2016,07,25
242,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location and only a few minutes from O'Connell Street.  Its a bit hard to find as it is only a single door leading onto a corridor where the reception area is.  The reception staff were very helpful and offered to look after our cases as our rooms were not quite ready.  Our room (405) was on the top floor facing the back of the hotel.  This was lucky as it was very warm and we were able to keep our windows open at night.  The other part of our family had room 101 which faced the main road and they had to keep the windows shut as the noise from the trams and people was too much with the windows open.  The rooms were very clean and up to date and the beds very comfortable.  For breakfast we had the choice of a full Irish or half Irish.  The food was brought to us by a waitress as there was only self service for tea, coffee and cereal.  I felt the staff were a bit mean with the breakfast.  Only gave us one sachet of butter each and failed to bring extra when asked.  All in all a good hotel though.",4,2016,07,25
242,Best place to stay,Highly recommend this place prices are very affordable rooms are lovely and close to everything. staff are great very friendly especially Richie part of the bar staff made everyone very welcome one of the funniest men you will ever meet. ,5,2016,07,23
242,Close quarters - but hey - you're only here to sleep!,"Cosy but clean room. Staff was AWESOME! Safe location and handy to everything important in downtown Dublin.  And just in case you need another pint after a night at Temple Bar, the cheerful staff will happy pour you another..or two!",4,2016,07,21
242,"Perfect Location, Lovely Staff","We booked this hotel last minute as our original booking fell through- it was fate! staff were so friendly and funny from start to finish. Extremely clean, beds comfy (could of done with extra pillow), breakfast okay, hotel bar fab! loved it",5,2016,07,19
242,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here in a family room for 3 nights is July 2016. The location is wonderful just a 5 minute walk from Temple Bar making it close enough to wonder too but further away so you aren't disturb by it. 

The room itself was nice, big kingsize and single bed were comfy and everything was clean.",4,2016,07,13
242,Nice play to stay,"me and my friends stayed here last weekend during a stag do in Dublin and the hotel was great. location was excellent, not too far from O'Connell street which is near all the main bus stops to and from the airport. Near all the main shopping areas too. Its a short walk to all the main pub and club areas. If I was going back to Dublin I'd certainly stay there again. The only drawback is that there seems to be a rather popular nightclub a few doors down at the noise was quite loud on the Saturday night until around 4am. Breakfast was excellent however",4,2016,07,09
242,Value for money,"In the sea of eye wateringly expensive hotels that is Dublin, this one is reasonably priced and value for money, although you get exactly what you pay for.  Pros:  central location, clean and comfortable room, well functioning bathroom, friendly staff.  Cons: no air con so front rooms extremely noisy if you need the windows open (really noisy air con unit somewhere adjacent, and the luas trams are currently turning outside so go ding all the time); full breakfast service only from 8am, with very basic 'continental' left out for you if you need to eat before then; didn't give me the wifi code on checking in, forgot to ask for it on my return later in evening but too far to go back downstairs to get it.  If you can get a good rate, OK for a one night stay.",4,2016,07,02
242,Way too expensive for what it has to offer,"The hotel doors are not well marked and you can easily walk past them not noticing there is a hotel there. The entrance could be renovated and a bit more spacious. The rooms are ok, however some of them open directly to the main walking plaza. There could be at least blurry windows there, so you don't have to close the curtains in the middle of the day for some privacy.

The cleaniness was ok, but could be better. Everything else was good. The brakfast was big and good.

All in all way to pricy for what it has to offer.",3,2016,06,29
242,clean and central,"Central locaion ,good pub next door
 Poor breakfast ; no choce in a room that is in great need of renovation
 nice people
Do ot take a room on the main street, the isolation is bad and the air conditionning unit of the hudge building opposite ver noisy all time",3,2016,06,26
242,"Average hotel, very good location.","If you're looking for a one night stay in a central location and you book in advance to get a good rate then this is probably ideal. The reception area is a corridor with a hatch on the right as you walk in the main door, check in from 3pm no earlier and they will look after your baggage. 

Location was brilliant- just around the corner from Temple Bar, very central.

The rooms are basic but the main thing is they're clean. The shower is very weak and I do think this was the only fault within the room. 

The downstairs adjoining bar was nice, staff behind the bar cheerful and the night receptionist on the 12th June was a lovely, friendly, helpful chap!!",3,2016,06,15
242,Hen do! ,"For a '2 star' hotel, I think it was defiantly more 4 stars! Beds were so comfy, breakfast was perfect (could have done with a larger plate full) and it's central to the heart of Dublin! Will defiantly be back. They accommodated all 14 of us to perfectly! Pictures on their website don't do it justice! ",5,2016,06,12
242,Lovely spot! ,Great little hotel just off O Connell street and five minutes walk from the Jervis Street Luas stop. Clean and modern hotel rooms and friendly efficient staff. Will definitely stay here again :) check in is not until 3pm but staff will take any luggage no problem. ,4,2016,05,31
242,Basic hotel in a good location,"As the title says, this is a basic hotel in a good location. Within walking distance of the temple bar area and main attractions. There is a tram stop which is just outside which was ideal for us as we were going to the Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol.

Reception staff were very helpful when needed. Good free WIFI connection from the rooms. We didn't have the breakfast included so cannot comment on that. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a short stay in Dublin.",3,2016,05,28
242,Nice hotel in center,"We were a bit put back when we found the entrance, but getting inside we were surprised to find a real nice room. Nice and quiet with spacious bathroom and plenty hot water. Breakfast included in our room rate, and a great choice with full Irish breakfast (which could be halved to avoid waste of good food). 
The hotel is few minutes walk from Connell bridge and Temple Bar, so everything is easy to get to. Will highly recommend!",4,2016,05,25
242,Perfect Location for Dublin,"Super quaint hotel, with new owners (as of the writing of this). In an older building, so the ambiance is outstanding. Rooms are comfortable and clean, and the service is great. It is adjacent to a great restaurant/pub, which is open just for hotel guests on Monday. The owners are super nice, and they will go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. Most important, it is located smack-dab in the middle of Dublin, with easy access to bus and tram lines, and a very short walk to all of the pubs and restaurants.  If you would rather be away from the bustle of the city, then choose someplace else ... but if you want to be in the middle, and have a nice place, then this is your hotel.",5,2016,05,22
242,Well located average hotel,"Older hotel but nice clean room (#306). A bit tight for 3 people i.e. not much room for 3 pieces of luggage. Well located: could walk to all major attractions. Good Irish breakfast but limited choices. Burnt light bulb replaced quickly. Friendly staff - printed boarding pass for us.
Low water pressure for shower. Slow service at breakfast time. No jams the first 2 days even if mentioned to staff (weekend staff?) - Corrected right away on Monday morning when mentioned to staff; went out and bought some right away.",3,2016,05,22
242,A bit overpriced & bordering a seedy area ,"Accommodations aren't bad but were pricey for what it is. Nice people at the reception when they are present. It says 24 hour reception desk, but at least 3 times over 10 hours we tried to contact someone there but couldn't. 

The hotel is close to many things but it borders on an area that is a little seedy. The closest 24 hour carpark is across the river--not too far, but a ways if you have suitcases. Be sure to note this and the reception desk if you have an early morning flight out of Dublin. ",3,2016,05,14
242,Loved this place!,"I surprised my fiancé to a night away and tickets to a concert so I was looking for somewhere not to expensive but in the city centre. This place was perfect! Right in The middle of everything and the Luas stops just a minute away. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable & staff were brilliant! A big shout out to barman Richie, we had a great laugh with him when we came back from the concert. (Remember if it's a boy Richie or a girl Regina! Our joke on the night) We will recommend this hotel to everyone and will be back again. Much better than we expected!",5,2016,05,04

242,Good but needs a bit of an overhaul,"Nice people, cosy hotel, but the plumbing needs fixing and the breakfast process is a bit chaotic.

Great location though - 5 minutes from all the main stuff.",3,2016,04,23

Very close to old city centre ""Temple Bar"" and big room .

242,Great location and lovely staff!,"This hotel is so central to all the main attractions in Dublin, everything is within walking distance.

Great value for money and would highly recommend it.",4,2016,04,01
242,Weekend visit,"The Abbey hotel is perfectly situated for all the attractions of Dublin being within walking distance of the Temple bar area, various museums and the Guinness Brewery.

242,"Great Location, No Frills hotel","If you get this hotel at a good price it will be a value if not you will feel ripped off. There is no real lobby, i's like a youth hostel reception ares. I had no heating in my room for 2 nights though they did supply a portable heater. Upper 2 floors were without hot water when I arrived. No extra blankets for the beds, no toiletries in the bathroom,hairdryer was broken but they did replace. If  I had paid full price I would have been very disappointed. The deal, the location and the staff redeemed the overall experience.",3,2016,03,26
242,Miss Bates 30th,"After getting off the aircoach and walking down the street a few times we finally found the hotel 😀.
The guy at reception was really friendly and helpful.
We had a triple room with 3 single beds in, tea coffee facilities, hairdryer and TV.
Enough space to move around in and it was very clean.
Bathroom big and clean shower easy enough to use.
Really enjoyed our stay here as it is very central.
Would highly recommend ",4,2016,03,26

242,"Lack of care, service and overall bad stay (plus a late night visit - dangerous)...","I am writing this review to give a rightful insight to our stay for a situation that we felt needed to be addressed. Not with the want of trying to get an answer from the hotel manager and, despite the email apology, it has not really been resolved. So we arrived at this hotel Friday 26th Feb and for two out of three of us it was our first time in Dublin. We booked this hotel for a special treat and were allowed to check in early - great start! Room was brilliant, location was fab, but soon after, our trip started to go downhill.

NO WORKING SHOWER.
To start off with we were planning a night out and all needed to shower... apart from there was no hot water coming out of it. Fantastic. We called down to reception from our room and was told someone would come up to look at the shower, we apologised because we thought we were not using it correctly. Wrong. A lady came up to the room and told us that someone might have turned the hot water off by accident because our room was on the same level as the restaurant. She was going to send up their handy man to sort it out. Eventually, he came to our room, twisted the shower knob a couple of times and told us it was broken and that they needed to get a plumber to sort it out, which would have to be tomorrow morning at half 8... A little inconvenient when we had wasted so much time already before going out and needed to shower in a different room AND get up early to let in a plumber. No problem, we agreed to take the room key from downstairs and use the shower and did not make a fuss at all. Quite frankly, the thought of walking around the hotel just showered, making the transition in the lift from the 1st floor to our room on the 3rd floor was embarrassing. We came across other members of staff and visitors who would look at us strangely, wondering why we were showering in a different room. Humiliating.

SOME RANDOM PERON IN OUR ROOM.
After our fab night out in Dublin one of our friends went back to our room around 1am, whilst two of us arrived back at 2am. Drifting off to sleep, I heard someone trying to get into our room at about 2.30am. Ignoring the key in the door, I realised that there was a beam of light coming through and I looked up to see a dark figure peering around the corner where our beds were. Panicking, I woke up my friend (who was also asleep) telling her that somebody had come in to our room. She could hardly believe it and, although we were scared, we opened the door on a young lady who could not apologise enough. HOW LUCKY WERE WE THAT IT WAS HER?! All I could think of was if we had been out and our belongings had been stolen? Or it was a child in the room? Or our friend was still alone? Absolutely terrifying and a poor lack of service from whoever gave this young girl our room key and number! The girl was already confused where her room was, having already been given the wrong room earlier. The gentleman downstairs offered her a free weekend at the hotel, but we got offered ""free drinks"", which did not seem fair considering the distress of having someone else in our private space. Not kicking up much of a fuss, understanding that mistakes do happen, my friend returned to our room.

The next day arrived and unfortunately the plumber did not. When making the staff aware of this, they ""apparently"" had no clue that a plumber was meant to fix our shower. Are you kidding me? A hotel with no communication, giving out wrong room keys and not even bothering to tell each other that we needed a shower, when we had to get up early for their terrible mistakes. Not on. 

Still having to travel down two floors for the shower, the second evening I rang down to reception and asked whether we would be entitled to our free drinks. They also had no recollection of this and proceeded to tell us that the night staff had no obligation to give us free drinks because the bar is separate to the hotel. Also, they said we had free breakfast, which was a complete and utter lie... we had asked for toast simply because the breakfast options were so awful that we needed to eat something! Included in the room, we had continental breakfast, which I would have thought would have meant exactly that.  Actually, there were three choices of bland cereal, browned fruit in a bowl and (on the first day only) a couple of tiny pastries slung in a bowl. There were also no plates, which I found quite strange and the toast made a mess on the table because of this. To be fair, the full Irish breakfast was beautiful, but you are expected to pay extra for this, despite paying a fair bit for the hotel.

After spending another evening on the phone to reception and explaining to them the circumstances (wasting more time of our holiday), they sent up their bar manager Matt. What a lovely man?! He had so much empathy and could not believe what had happened to us and how calm we were being under these ghastly circumstances. He made sure that the shower was to be fixed the next day at our convenience and sent us up a bottle of bucks fizz, which was very thoughtful of him and we thanked him. After our night out, the night man gave us a free drink from the bar and was great chatting to us and making sure we were alright. Why did this not happen before?! However, we did get the impression that the hotel were desperate for us not to write a bad review on trip advisor, unfortunately this has become necessary under the way we were treated.

Finally, our shower was fixed! But we were still wanting to speak to the manager asking for an explanation. When we finally got to see the manager on the reception desk, we did not get an apology and asked to speak to her later on after our day out. When we got back we had been told she had waited until 3.30pm and had gone home - put it this way we were not wasting any more of our holiday waiting for the hotel, so of course we were still out exploring at 3.30pm and arrived back about 5pm! At this point, although we were left with her email address to email her, we knew it was going to be a lost cause to get some sort of money back for the inconvenience caused. However, we did receive just 20 euro each there and then, which was a nice gesture. Still, we would rather have them kept the 20 euro and given us great service.

Since coming home, my friend has emailed the manager and we even had to email them again several times, when they had promised to email us back on the 29th Feb, after they had spoken to members of staff. Still we had to chase them. No such luck with compensation, although they agreed that we would deserve it because of the poor service. With our several emails, they seemed to reluctantly offer us a free night if we were to return to Dublin again. What made us laugh the most was the fact that the offer of a ""free night"" was subject to availability!! Now really, would we return again? Before now we might have done, but unfortunately now we definitely would not. If we travel to Dublin from Southern England again, then we would go somewhere with an equally great location, read trip advisor reviews and choose somewhere with much better value for money. I wish the hotel the best for the future, but things do need to change if, by treating their customers right,  they want the customers to return the favour by coming back to stay with them again. We will not and not recommend anyone else to.",1,2016,03,15
242,Perfect for a weekend in Dublin,Very glad we stumbled across this hidden gem. 2 minutes walk to the Ha'penny Bridge so very central hotel. Rooms were quite small but very clean and just what we were looking for. Beds were comfortable and bathroom had everything we needed. Prices weren't as low as we'd liked but I think this goes for all hotels in the City Centre. Staff were very friendly and breakfast the next morning was spot on. Would definitely stay here again if we returned to Dublin.,4,2016,03,15
242,Great stay!,"Overall the hotel was great value for money and we enjoyed our stay! Rooms are basic but comfortable, and the breakfast is good.

Nearly 5 months later we have today received an email (Feb 28th 2016) advising that our reservation is now cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances! I also noticed the hotel is still being advertised with available rooms for those dates! What a joke! ... Now we have flights booked and no hotel with weeks to go, no sympathy or alternative accommodation given from the hotel or hotels.com! Not worth booking and wouldn't recommend the hassle to anyone! We haven't even got chance to stay at the hotel and already we've received terrible service! ",1,2016,02,28
242,Great location,"Rooms were comfortable, breakfast excellent and location is very central and convenient. Not noisy ( weekday) though our rooms were on the Main Street.

242,Disappointed ,"After a warm welcome it was downhill all the way. From untrained bar staff to a special offer that wasn't, the final straw was no hot water at 8.00 in the morning. So no shower or bath. There are many hotels in Dublin, this is one to avoid. ",1,2015,11,28
242,Great location poor hotel,"Excellent location (across the road from Arnett's department store)
that's all that's good about it. 
The hotel can charge what they like because of the central location, We paid €368 for 2 nights B&B. 
The place is in a bad state of repair, the room smelt musty, carpet was dirty, (my wife didn't take off her socks even in bed) cold tap didn't work, behind lockers have never been painted, the place felt dirty and in need of a total makeover. (Need the Brennan brothers!) 
Breakfast : the guy serving didn't seem to have a clue, nor did the chef! I won't go into everything just everything seemed wrong and don't order an omelette!
The staff were all very friendly and that's the only nice thing I can say.
1/2 the price is all that it's worth.",2,2015,11,15
242,Fantastic stay!,"The hotel is in a great location with easy transport links. Rooms were sizeable, very clean and maid service was daily.

242,Disappointing stay,"I had stayed at the Abbey a few years back and decided to stay again during a recent trip to Dublin. The hotel has gone down hill significantly in the intervening years. The walls in the room were quite battered, especially by the desk chair. The mirror was broken. The water pressure in the shower was dismal. The door handle came off in my hand when I pulled the door closed behind me. Even the beds weren't properly equipped. There was just a sheet on top of the mattress, no mattress pad. The king-size bed was actually two twins together and I woke up every time I rolled over the seam. The only positive aspect of my stay was that the breakfast that came with my room was quite delicious. When I checked out of the hotel and shared these issues with the receptionist, she wasn't particularly concerned that I had an unsatisfactory stay -- which just affirmed for me that I will not be returning. I had a second reservation to return in October that I cancelled while still on the premises. There are better options for €125/night in Dublin.",1,2015,09,24
242,Location!,"The location of this hotel is great, in walking distance to almost everything and the trams and bus stops right down the street! 
Staff seemed friendly, although at breakfast getting coffee and toast was a little bit of a task..
When you look at the pictures of rooms online I expected a little more when my sister and I arrived.. Maybe it was just our room/floor.. but as soon as you walked onto(I believe it was) the 3rd floor all I could smell was a musty, wet odour. 
And of course when we looked out our bedroom window there is standing water on a rooftop/landing right outside. It looked like some kind of exhaust or air conditioner was there as well. Im unsure if this is something they could have helped or not but it made for a terrible sleep and breathing at times felt difficult.  I asked if we could change rooms and unfortunately all the rooms were booked as there was a big game going on that week.(Scotland vs Ireland) .",3,2015,09,24

242,Worst experience with a hotel,"When we got in the front of the hotel, there was NO Portor at all! Then when we checked in, a women was the RUDEST person ever! She was giving my family and myself attitude,  and she was ignoring us too! We didn't like the room we had when we came there, so we went back to the front desk, we had the same women we had at the beginning, she was giving us more attitude!  How rude is it that she was giving us attitude and she was like ""can you give me a second, I'm looking for the room, can you give me a few minutes?"" Then, later we went back to the front desk and got a nicer women that was actually helping! We switched rooms into where people are smoking and there's no air conditioning! At All!

When we left the hotel, we went to the women we had giving us attitude at the beginning. When my mom was checking us out, she was talking about my family while my mom was standing in front of her.... I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AT ALL! ",2,2015,08,22
242,"Friendly, clean and great value","This hotel is great value.  We paid £93 for a room with three beds in the centre of Dublin. The room and bathroom were excellent; beautifully clean linen and spotless bathroom. Room also had tea and coffee making facilities and toiletries in bathroom.  Receptionists were friendly and helpful, and we were able to leave our luggage at reception on the last day, after checking out.  Highly recommended",5,2015,08,19
242,"First visit, good impression","I chose this hotel for practical reasons, it was the least expensive accommodation that I could find in Dublin City Centre on the night. As a first visit to the property I didn't know what to expect. I was very satisfied with the staff and facilities. The bedroom was very confortable although a little sparse of furniture. The free WIfi in the room was excellent.",4,2015,08,19
242,Holiday,"The key is that tho hotel is near the city centre, it was clean and has good service.  The breakfast was simpel but did its work, could absolute been better.  The room was large, we were to but there were beds for three.",4,2015,08,12
242,Hen party,"Had so much fun staying at this hotel last night! Staff where very friendly and welcoming. The bar stayed open as long as we wanted. Rooms where comfy and clean. Basic hotel, not super fancy.. But warm clean and welcoming. I deff want to go back! ",5,2015,08,09
242,No sleep......,Checked and had to pay for room before viewing it.We were given room 204 a big room i admit but poorly laid out.Directly outside our window was an extremely noisy air con unit that even with the windows closed sounded like a plane taking off.The shower curtain was badly stained on the bottom and you had to stand on the side of the bath to put the shower head in place which I feel is a little dangerous.The breakfast wasn't much better and le bistro area as they call it felt grubby to the point where your feet where sticking to the floor. Check out in the morning was abrupt no asking if all was OK just takes the key and turns away.I like Dublin but will never again stay here .,2,2015,08,08
242,Excellent location,"Stayed in triple room (single beds...lovely and comfy) on top floor. Nice, clean room with ensuite.

Unlike other comments,  we didnt find it that noisey and we had window open. 

Nice cooked breakfast. Breakfast room has no windows so was a bit dark and depressing. 

Location is super and 140e for b&b we wld definitely stay here again. 

Oh...nothing happening in the bar...we were the only ones in it(but it was a tues night)  ",4,2015,08,04
242,Worst breakfast ever,"Hotel room was clean and comfortable but when we went to the dining room it was shocking. When I went to sit down the seat was drinched, next morning there was a bucket on top of the seat. The service was appalling. We asked for 2 full Irish breakfast one with the egg very well done. The result is what u see in the photo. When the breakfast came out the eggs were soft when I asked her to take them to the cook to cook them she told me the cook don't do hard eggs. The receptionist was very unhelpful and hadn't a clue what she was doing I know it was the August weekend but for 327.60e for 2 nights I would expect something better for breakfast. On a positive note it is very central",2,2015,08,03
242,excellent location,dont let the exterior put you off...smashing little hotel dublin...were put in room which overlooked centre of hotel and air con units very noisy when windows open so  asked tobe moved and where .. great beakfast and very cheap,5,2015,07,29
242,My point of view,"4 days in Dublin.We made rezervation on Booking,and when we arrived at the Abbey Hotel, the reception guy asked us kindly to pay for the room,because the hotel policy says so.
After 15 minutes of nonsense communication my husband paid for the unseen room.
The room was not clean,as I found a forgotten mineral water bottle on the bedside table.
Breakfast the same every day,the lady from the kitchen was very humorous and kind.
The important things to see and to do are very close to Abbey Hotel,we walked.
After all, we didn't spend too much time in the hotel,so if you walk all day long and you are tired by night,it's not so bad.",3,2015,07,23
242,Fair and Fair,"we stayed here on a last minute booking, was apprehensive as previous reviews didn't fill me with confidence.  This place is ace, the receptionist was great, helpful and enthusiastic, the location is ideal to central Dublin.  The only thing I found odd was paying at check-in as it's something I'd expect from a hostel.  The room was clean albeit without a bin.  All in all we would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,20
242,Good location but sooo noisy,"Stayed two nights in abbey hotel and got rooms facing the street. The room was ok, breakfast terrible and the trams outside together with happy people made it impossible to sleep. If you book here make sure you get a room facing the yard.",2,2015,07,12
242,would stay again,"Visited Dublin on 1 may for 2 nights with 4 friends, after a little mix up with the rooms, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay a the Abbey Hotel,  the staff were lovely and friendly,  the rooms were very very clean and the beds extremely comfortable,  only a few minutes walk over the bridge to temple bar, and plenty of shops and restaurants near by,  the breakfast was lovley and I had more than 1 cup of coffee and 1 slice of toast,  I would recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,07,09
242,Average,"I was traveling with my two teenage kids (13 and 17) I will just give you a candid list of pros and cons and you can decide what's important to you...

Location...great. Central to Temple Bar etc.. The street is a bit sketchy, but we didn't feel unsafe.
Room size...small (to be expected in the city center?)
Cleanliness...clean, white linens (scratchy), rooms are new/modern.
Hotel front desk...not helpful.
Breakfast staff...prompt and accommodating.
Food...fine. Typical Irish breakfast. Same every day; beans, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, canned peaches, toast, cold cereal.
Payment requested up front.
Elevator broken, we were on the 4th floor. They did leave a note under our door that we could request help with luggage if necessary.

All in all it was fine. Not up to the level of friendliness/service that we received at other B&B's around Ireland, but not awful either. If you get a good deal on the price it's fine.",3,2015,06,25
242,Abbey hotel,Booked this hotel asked was there a lift and restaurant in the hotel we where told yes I and a 3 year old child with a disability and can not walk very far! On arrival the lady took the payment first which was 300euro for two nights and then decided to tell us the lift was out of order and we where on the 3rd floor we asked was there no other rooms closer to the ground floor she said no. She got someone to help us up with the luggage and my 3 year olds special needs buggy which is quite heavy I had to carry my daughter in the mean time the man carrying the luggage was passing us and saw there was something rong! We went on up and asked if someone would be available to carry the buggy down wen we wanted to come back downstairs they said yes just ring down. About 15 min later the same lady that told us there was no other rooms knocked on our door and told us there was a room available on the second floor if we wanted to change we of course said yes. That evening we went down for dinner and wer told they don't do food during the week! The breakfast the next morning I wouldn't give to a dog. We also realised during our stay there are only 9 rooms 3 on each floor there is only 1 person behind reception and bar so u wer waiting a long time to get served and to be honest it's more like a glorified B&B I would never stay here again and for that price I could have stayed somewhere far far nicer. 😢,1,2015,06,23
242,So friendly,"My husband was in Dublin on business and was coming and going through the night but the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  The room was clean and very comfortable, we had a lovely time. We would go back there anytime.",5,2015,06,18
242,Weekend in Dublin,The Abbey Hotel was a great find for our long weekend in Dublin. Located just over the River Liffey from Temple Bar which is where we spent most of our time. It was a great price that included a nice breakfast. Though the rooms were a bit small we made due. It was a little noisy in the back due to the close proximity to several late nite clubs. But if you closed the window it was fine. The staff were extremely hospitable and knowledgeable about the area's sights and modes of transportation. I loved the ease of walking to and from the Temple Bar areas as well as other local sights. I would definitely stay there again.,4,2015,06,15
242,"OK, but not much more than that","We were in Dublin for a city trip, for which the hotel was ideally placed: mostly everything was in walking distance! Unfortunately, the room was less good: when we arrived, our triple room (as confirmed by the man who welcomed us) appeared to be a double: only two single beds were available. This was not ideal, as there were three of us. After some discussion, a third bed was placed inside the room, but by that time it was already well past midnight.
The day after, our hotel key cards didn't work anymore (they were replaced, but no one ever wondered why the cards didn't work anymore when we'd been able to use them previously without any problems) and the curtains came crashing down in the evening (when we were closing them). To show how far we'd gone past 'we're very pleased about the service', we decided to fix the curtains back up on our own for the night and just mention something the morning afterwards. They were fixed by the next evening, but we made sure not to put a bed too close, just in case.

While we slept relatively well (a lot of commotion outside every evening until around 2AM) and the hotel was placed strategically well, I don't think we'll be booking this again.",3,2015,06,02
242,"fresh, quiet and overall a lovely stay","Just back from an overnight stay in this newly refurbished hotel bang smack in the middle of the city. The staff were lovely,Very efficient and the whole experience was so pleasant. The bed was gorgeous, the room pristine and it was so quiet we slept like logs! Apart from a few finishing touches the room needs like a mirror/dressing table near a socket, it couldn't be faulted. top notch, well done all :)",4,2015,05,28
242,Comfy,"Stayed in the hotel for one night while touring Ireland, the room was spacious for two of us who shared the room. Nice big bathroom.  The hotel was quiet and the free breakfast in the morning was good.",4,2015,05,26
242,Central location,"We stayed at this hotel over May bank holiday weekend for my daughters hen party
It was in a great location just at the Luas stop and five minutes walking to Temple Bar Dublin's 
entertainment hub. We were well looked after and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Would recommend this hotel to any one who wanted a central location and a comfortable stay",5,2015,05,05
242,"Nice room, bad breakfast and builders in","Hotel was hard to find as not clearly signposted until you double check address and back pedal. Builders in and desk on landing for reception. Staff very nice and looked after luggage at beginning and end of the holiday. Room was clean, tidy but no wardrobe just a hanging rail over the small tea making area and kettle. Recommend having a shower early as no hot water by 10 am. Breakfast was 1 cup of coffee supplied by waitress and 1 slice of toast. self service cereal, apple juice, scrambled egg ( very dry) hash brownsm bacon and sausages. Black pudding ine day, white the next. only 2 plates out at a time you have to ask for more. only a couple of jams out as well. The impression is very low budget and tight costing. On day 2 i asked for 4 slices of bread as i wanted to make sausage and bacon sandwiches ( best option i felt) that took three attempts, 1st was given 4 slices of toast, 2nd attempt i got three slices of bread including the end crust. I went to the kitchen door and explained again and was told they had no more bread! finally got two slices of brown to go with the two of the three pieces previously given. No decaf cofee and no sweetners. service was very bad. Had to step over buckets of plaster once the Builders started again for the day. No tv control in room even though tv, so couldnt put it on when we were briefly in the room freshening up. Position of hotel very good. Maybe when the work is finished and if they sort out breakfast the rating would be better .",3,2015,04,24
242,Great stay,I recently stayed at the hotel for two nights. My experience of this hotel was very positive. The location is great and its only a short walk to places like temple bar where there are loads of pubs and restaurants.  The room itself was very clean and looked like it had been decorated recently.  Overall a great stay and I would definitely return. ,5,2015,04,18
242,"Clean room but a bit noisy, great location","I was a bit worried about booking a stay in this hotel just because some of the other reviews were not too good.The lack of signage outside the hotel means you would walk by it and not even notice it was there. Also the reception area is literally just a desk beside the bar. In saying that the double room that we booked was spotless on arrival and had obviously been recently redone. The double bed was massive and very comfortable. A negative however was the noise from a nightclub nearby, we stayed on a Wednesday night and the loud music didnt stop until around 3 am.....and we could hear it pretty clear from our 3rd floor room. I would definaly stay in this hotel again, the room was cheap yet spotless and confortable. Although the check in could involve a bit more information as after paying we were simply handed the key and had to ask where the room was, wifi password, check out times etc. Normally that is explained to all guests upon check in and we shouldnt have had to ask.",3,2015,04,17
242,Top Class Abbey Hotel,"Stayed on sat Night this is a great hotel ,location,staff,rooms were fantastic could not have asked for better.
Hotel has been refurbished to a high standard and is right in heart of dublin with parking and shopping nearby ,breakfast was great .",5,2015,04,16
242,Good value and great location,"We stayed in a room with 4 single beds on the third floor which were very comfy, the room was airy and clean. It was evident that the room and bathroom had recently been refurbished as they were modern and very clean.

Reception is very small, just a small table beside the bar but the staff which we saw there, and at the bar are very helpful. 
Our room was at the front of the hotel on the third floor so it was nice and bright however early in the morning you can hear the Luas. There is also a nightclub beside the hotel and on Wednesday night we could hear some noise but nothing major. 

On our last night we ate in the hotel, the food is AMAZING. It is a great price and great quality, would definitely recommend the chicken wings with BBQ sauce! Great chef!!
The hotel is in close proximity to most places and usually takes between a 5-10 minute walk.

However, the lift made strange noises when we first arrived and we didn't feel comfortable in it! the next day, the lift had broken down which was a slight inconvenience as we were on the third floor but great exercise! 
It was also quite hard to know whether someone worked in the hotel or not as the receptionist and bar staff were not wearing a uniform or name tag. 

Overall, I would stay here again as I think the hotel is just getting to its feet, good so far, would stay again!",4,2015,04,05
242,Weekend City Break,"Stayed at the Abbey Hotel during March 2015 for 2 nights (Friday to Sunday).

The hotel staff are very pleasant, from the receptionist, cleaning staff, management and bar staff... all accommodated our needs,  very friendly, chatty, helpful with directions and things to do and made our stay very pleasant.

The hotel is clean, spacious, quiet at night and secure. Rooms are basic. 

As we were two gay lads, the hotel was very gay friendly and situated in the heart of Dublin. Had such a laugh with all guests and employees. O'connell street is a stones throw away, as is Temple Square, The George and all the main attractions. -Perfect location.

The hotel offers food services at reasonable prices to save looking around for food, althou a Food Court / Hall is literally next door with foods from around the world. 

Price was ideal for the location comparable to all hotels near by.

Highly recommend The Abbey and shall certainly book this hotel again when ever in Dublin.

Thanks for an amazing stay!

242,Unforgettable Paddys Week!!,"Stayed here my girlfriend and I for are 10 year anniversary, couldnt get more central Paddys festival at the top of are road. When I was booking hotel felt very worried as the pictures on this website are not great to say the least but on booking.com it looked new and for the price felt it was worth the risk. Turned out to be a gem spoke to nice bar staff for a late drink on are return from the festival said it's new management and all new refit as on Booking thank god as couldn't listen to the GF if I was wrong :-). We had a great time nice breakfast and we stayed in to watched the football one of the nights. We had great hearty bar food at a great price steak sandwich and chips 5 euro and the chicken wings stew was also great. A few early day issues with t.v in the Bar but they gave us a irish coffee to make up for it :-).  I will 100 percent return best value for money and location 2 minutes from temble bar no taxi or transport needed just taxi to train station home ....",5,2015,03,22
242,very nice and cheap hotel,"The Abbey Hotel is in a great location in the centre of Dublin. The service team is really friendly and the rooms were very modern and newly equipped. One could easily see that the whole hotel was redecorated lately.
I can recommend a stay in this hotel.",5,2015,03,16
242,Good and comfortable. ,"Hotel is good and comfortable. Simple but good.

242,Un hotel improponible,"Realmente un asco!!! Estructura vieja, que se cae a pedazos, sucio, muebles viejos, absurdos, que nada tiene que ver uno con otro, cables por todos lados en exposición,  la calefacción no funcionaba en la pieza, las ventanas obsoletas, ruidoso, ningún control del hotel, conserjería inexistente.Cualquiera puede entrar y salir del hotel sin que nadie se de cuenta, la puerta de entrada asquerosa y siempre abierta...
El baño, sin palabras... ni siquiera hay mezclador de agua fría y caliente...
Te ofrecen un desayuno con cafe instantáneo y tres o cuatro asquerosidades mas que hay que ser muy valiente para comer.
Lo mas lindo es que la pieza se llamaba ""luxury room"" y costaba ca. 200 euros por noche.
Una experiencia muy negativa que non arruino las vacaciones.",1,2019,12,02

242,Muy bueno,"Excelente hotel en pleno centro de Dublin, conectado con todo. Limpieza excelente, camas comodas. Personal amable. Desayuno en el bar del mismo muy completo. Funciono todo perfecto. Para mejorar puede ser el ingreso al mismo que debe anunciarse en cada ingreso.",4,2019,02,09
242,Non ci tornerò.,"Un posto tattico per gli spostamenti, si trova su una traversa di O'Connell street, perfetto per il turista che si sposta con i mezzi. La reception ti accoglie davvero ad ogni ora, i ragazzi sono disponibili per ogni richiesta. Abbiamo alloggiato in una stanza con bagno privato al primo piano(c'è l'ascensore), c'è un set di cortesia per il te pomeridiano, asciugamani e tv.
Detto ciò passiamo alle sorprese: non è la prima volta che veniamo a Dublino, ma il disservizio prestato in questa struttura è stato un grande disagio. Nella nostra stanza c'erano 4 prese della corrente, due erano bloccate e non si riusciva ad infilare una spina, una presa aveva rotto il pulsante che attivava la corrente e l'ultima presa era difettosa e per ricaricare un qualsiasi dispositivo (fondamentali per qualsiasi tipo di viaggio, dalla macchina fotografica al tablet al cellulare al bollitore!) bisognava tenere premuta la presa al muro, ma questo non ne garantiva il corretto funzionamento. Per non rischiare di bruciare i nostri dispositivi abbiamo segnalato la cosa in reception, dove i ragazzi si sono correttamente prodigati nel segnalare la cosa al manager, a al nostro giro pomeridiano non abbiamo trovato nessun miglioria e anzi, l'unica presa difettosa non funzionava nemmeno più. Abbiamo dovuto portare le nostre power bank e i cellulari in reception, dove i ragazzi ce li hanno caricati. La nostra tv non funzionava, il decoder non riceveva segnale, e anche questo è stato segnalato alla reception. 
La mattina dopo, su indicazione della ragazza che ci ha accolto il giorno precedente, ci siamo recati verso le 9:15 a fare colazione come indicato nel foglio al momento del check-in dalle 8 alle 10, ma inspiegabilmente alle 9:30 la signora in cucina ha ritirato tutto e ci siamo ritrovati a dover chiedere un bicchiere di latte insieme ad altri ospiti. 
Sarebbe un'ottima struttura, ma purtroppo, sorvolando sull'orario della colazione, la situazione delle prese della corrente, a noi ha creato un enorme disagio, ovviato solo dalle power bank di scorta.
Sconsiglio vivamente le stanze al primo piano, si trovano sopra il bar e se avete camminato per tutto il giorno, avreste un fastidioso sottofondo musicale fino a notte inoltrata che non concilia il sonno.
Consiglio al manager della struttura di averne più cura, soprattutto se il cliente si lamenta e lo fa presente al momento della sua permanenza, come abbiamo fatto noi.",1,2018,12,13
242,Nn male,"Albergo in zona centralissima,ad un passo da le più importanti attrazioni di Dublino, vicinissimo alle varie fermate bus . personale molto gentile,camere spaziose ed abbastanza pulite,riscaldate.prezzi ottimi.unico neo,la colazione compresa nel prezzo,da consumarsi nel pub sottostante,ma il locale sempre chiuso sino a tarda mattinata.",4,2018,11,30
242,Cercherei altri hotel,"Posizione ottima vicino al centro e soprattutto alla fermata del bus airlink da/per l'aereoporto (motivo per cui l'ho scelto). Ma finisce quì. Hotel che manca di manutenzione. Nella mia camera il lavabo del bagno non scaricava, l'areatore del bagno cieco non funzionava; sempre nel bagno la vasca/doccia con tenda di plastica e doccia che perdeva, l'ingresso dove c'era l'armadio non ha luce ed era veramente buio, c'era una sola abat jour, ed infine un  buco enorme dietro la maniglia della porta. Io posso capire tutto ma rimane difficile credere che nessuno prima di me abbia fatto notare queste mancanze alla direzione, neanche chi si occupa delle pulizie. Essendo dublino molto piccola allo stesso prezzo conviene cercare altri hotel.",2,2018,08,03
242,Bel soggiorno ,"Hotel in pieno centro , a 5 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar è vicino alle principali fermate di bus.

Consigliato",4,2018,05,24
242,Comodo e conveniente,"A due passi dal centro, dai negozi e dalle affollatissime strade.. A Grafton Street e al quartiere dei pub. Il proprietario è davvero gentile. Consigliato per chi non vuole fare troppo passi, anche se poi in realtà Dublino la si gira abbastanza in fretta...",3,2018,04,18

Gerade zum Wochenende kann es vom Pub aus dem Erdgeschoss etwas lauter werden - Ohrstöpsel sind da sehr hilfreich.
Personal variierte von freundlich bis desinteressiert, kam auf den jeweiligen Tagesabschnitt an.

La vasca è stata dotata di una doccia (fissa al muso)  con una sorta di miscelatore a parete. Probabilmente per ovviare al grosso problema dei rubinetti separati.

La musica se oia sin llegar a ser molesta, pero al ser entre semana a las 12 se acababa. Al hotel se entra por una puerta pegada a la del pub, pero una vez entras y pasas , la pequeña recepcion ya es un hotel al uso. En la primera planta dan los desayunos de 8 a 11, abundantes y al gusto, incluido el desayuno irlandés,  tostadas etc. La habitación era amplia, se veia renovada de hace poco y el baño estaba reformado y era muy amplioy luminoso. El precio es caro, pero ojo, en esa zona es lo normal, siquieres algo mas economico debes ir a las afueras o ir a un hostel. La ubicacion perfecta, justo al lado de la zona comercial y al lado de la pasarela que lleva temple bar. Sibuscas un hotel decente, bien  situado y por unos 150€/noche es una buena opción",3,2016,07,07
242,Muy céntrico. Personal muy agradable. Todo renovado.,"Estuve con la familia en el puente de Mayo. Aunque habíamos visto algún comentario negativo supongo que el hotel ha mejorado mucho en los últimos meses. El precio para una habitación triple está muy correcto, la habitación aunque no tiene mueble armario por falta de espacio está bien, hay un espacio suficiente para maletas y una barra con perchas. No es un hotel de un gran lujo pero si es todo moderno, está todo nuevo, la moqueta las camas, recién pintado, hay estufas de agua caliente instaladas que tu las puedes regular. Muy muy céntrico al lado de las paradas de bus que te llevan al aeropuerto y a dos pasos de temple bar. En la misma calle hay pubs y clubs y una sala de conciertos que los sabados puede ser un poco ruidosa pero se puede soportar, en todos los lugares céntricos esto se da. La calidad precio está muy bien además nosotros cogimos la opción de desayuno incluido y cada día te ofrecían el desayuno irlandés muy completo. Eso sí, tienes que hablar con el personal/camarero para pedirlo a cocina y para pedir todas las cosas que falten en la mesa. El desayuno se sirve en el pub contiguo que también pertenece a los dueños del hotel, el pub está muy limpio y los servicios del pub también. Tiene la iluminación de cualquier pub que no suelen tener muchas ventanas, no es ni frio ni un tugurio como he visto en algunos comentarios, solo que en España no hay bares de este tipo. Para poder comer el desayuno más tranquilo es mejor ir de 8.30 a 9.30. Desayunos son de 8.30 a 10 pero si te tienen que cocinar no vayas al final porque ya están a punto de quitarlo. Si no quieres pedir nada de cocina están los básicos allí en una mesa, panes, tostadora, mantequilla y mermelada, fruta y zumos. Nosotros estamos muy contentos con nuestra estancia.
Aspectos a mejorar (aunque todo fue genial): la presión del agua y camarero que entienda español.",4,2016,05,05
242,piacevole sorpresa,"avevamo scelto questo hotel solo per la posizione anche se le recensioni non erano un granche. invece, nonostante il primo impatto (piccolissima entrata ed assenza di hall) ci siamo decisamente ricreduti. camera ampia, luminosa e pulita. letti comodi e bagno con vasca di dimensioni più ampie di quanto capita di solito. la colazione (full irish breakfat) servita nel pub confinante (ci si accede direttamente anche dall'hotel) servita al tavolo ottima e abbondante. la posizione si e' verificata fantastica, centralissima, con la possibilità di fare tutto a piedi e ben raggiungibile con i mezzi pubblici da e per l'aereoporto (bus 41 a soli 3,30 euro a testa). se proprio vogliamo trovare un neo il check non prima delle 15,00 e camera al secondo piano sul davanti un po rumorosa al mattino presto per l'inizio del passaggio della red line... comunque se dovessimo tornare a Dublino lo risceglieremmo.",4,2016,04,08
242,Desayuno en un congelador y desastroso,"La situación dentro de la ciudad, magnífica. El personal, salvo un señor joven de barba larga y rubia, distante. La habitación, para tres, pequeña, sin calefacción (tuvieron que instalar un radiador eléctrico), dando atrás, no demasiado silenciosa y sin un solo armario: colocar la ropa de tres para una estancia de una semana era muy  complicado. El baño sin bidet, con el water en incómodo sitio y con una bañera que no usamos, en la que la ducha era fija y cuyo mezclador algo deficiente. Los desayunos, en general, mal organizados, con pocas cosas para servirte y teniendo que pedir lo que te ibas a tomar: cuando se juntaban 6 o 10 personas, el único chico o chica que atendía, no daba abasto. La sala donde se servía era un congelador sin apenas luz, bastante desagradabble. Uno de los desayunos fue desastroso: tras pedirlo, el chico oriental que atendía, se hizo un lío o no tomó bien nota, nos sirvió tarde y lo que no habíamos pedido y, al hacerselo saber, nos viene con que la cocina ya estaba cerrada: ello no le impidió seguir sirviendo a dos familias que llegaron más tarde. 
Como al pedir, lo que queríamos era menos cosas o cantidades, lo mejor es pedirlo completo y, lo que no quieras, te lo dejas; es una lástima, pero qué le vas a hacer.
En fin, que siete noches por 1049 € en la mitad del mes de febrero, es algo caro y con una relación calidad/precio, baja.",2,2016,02,24
242,"Excelente ubicación, rara la entrada","El hotel está perfectamente ubicado, cerca de la zona de pubs (Temple Bar) es muy céntrico. La entrada es un poco pintoresca porque se entra por un bar pero las habitaciones son cómodas y el personal muy amable. Por su ubicación puede ser un poco ruidoso.",4,2015,11,03
242,BUENISIMA SITUACION.,"El Hotel esta en una calle de lomas transitada, al lado de O ´connell Street , calle principal de compras de Dublín.
Tienes cerca la parada del Aircoach que te lleva directamente al Aeropuerto, a unos trescientos metros, en O´Connell.
La pega que tiene es que los desayunos no son tipo buffet y tienes que pedir selo a la camarera , café , tostdas o fruta Y TE LO PONEN EN EL PUB QUE HAY ABAJO , CON MUY POCA LUZ.
Tienen cinco tipos de desayunos y tu eliges el que te parezca. La ropa limpia pero pedimos una habitación para cuatro , reservada desde hace meses y al final era una triple con supletoria , que me hicieron pagar aparte, y que estábamos justísimos en la habitación. Esto no me gustó nada .El pago se efectúa nada mas llegar. No tiene armarios , cuelgas la ropa donde se puede por que en el baño tampoco hay perchas.
En fin ...la situación estupenda pero ""peros"" unos cuantos...",3,2015,09,22
242,CONSIGLIATISSIMO!!!!!!!!,"Ho alloggiato in questo hotel un anno fa, ma data la posizione e date l'accoglienza e la carineria dei receptionist, non posso che dire che rialloggerei qui se tornassi a dublino! l'hotel è inserito in una struttura datata, è privo di ascensore e le stanze sono molto semplici e secondo me purtroppo non indicate se si soffre di allergia alla polvere, giacchè i pavimenti sono ricoperti di moquette! per il resto è veramente silenzioso e pulito :) se non si vuole una suite a 5 stelle, è perfetto! ",4,2015,09,19
242,"Muy bueno, calidad precio","Esta muy cerca de todo, si bien Dublin es chico, se suele llegar medio DOBLADO de tantos bares copados que hay, asi que la cercanía empieza a pesar bastante, tuvimos un problema con la cama, el colchón específicamente, y nos lo cambiaron sin ningún problema, la gente es super atenta, hay lugares muy cerca para comer, fue muy buena nuestra estancia, lo recomiendo 100%.",4,2015,09,17
242,Mai più!!!,"Abbiamo soggiornato io e la mia famiglia in questo hotel di Dublino per  2 notti e purtroppo la scelta non è stata delle migliori. Appena arrivati dopo il buongiorno e nonostante avessero già i dati della nostra carta di credito ci hanno fatto pagare immediatamente  la stanza per le due notti  e sino a qui  ci siamo detti ...vabbè' lo faranno per precauzione....La nostra camera  posta all'ultimo piano aveva come sonoro un forte rumore che proveniva dal tetto (condizionatori????).  In bagno nella vasca giacevano capelli non di nostra proprietà ...ci siamo detti ...pazienza può capitare....Scendiamo per chiedere spiegazioni in merito al rumore nella stanza e l'impiegata  pur avendoci visto ha continuato beatamente a chiacchierare con il barista dell'hotel(....ci siamo detti pazienza ...forse sono  cose importanti) e, alle nostre rimostranze in merito alla stanza rumorosa  ci ha risposto che dovevamo aver pazienza (...ancora????). Della colazione meglio non parlarne....i tavoli erano poco illuminati per mancanza di due luci rotte..nella irish breakfast scelta da mio marito non c'era bacon perché finito , il toast o il pane non era contemplato nel menù quindi non di competenza .Per quanto concerne la colazione continentale scelta da me e da mia figlia pessima per qualità e quantità. Ho voluto scrivere una recensione pessima e non ""non classificabile"" perché l'hotel e' centralissimo a due passi dalle attrazioni principali e dal bus che porta all'aeroporto, anche se questo però' non è per merito dell'organizzazione dell'hotel.",1,2015,09,04
242,Scarso,"Sono stata ospite della struttura per una notte, tra il 25 e il 26 agosto 2015. La camera è spaziosa, ma l'organizzazione e la struttura dell'hotel lasciano a desiderare. Camera tripla e solo un asciugamano a disposizione. Ho dovuto chiedere per avere gli altri insieme all'asciugacapelli che non era presente in camera a differenza di quanto specificato. Bagno piccolo e cieco e soffione della doccia pieno di calcare, cosa che impediva l'ottimale discesa dell'acqua (nemmeno del tutto calda). 
In più c'è stato uno spiacevole incidente: il personale dell'hotel ha effettuato due volte il pagamento della camera dalla mia carta di credito, così da costringermi a chiedere un rimborso. 
Unico aspetto positivo la posizione, molto centrale.",2,2015,09,02
242,"Hotel centralissimo, a pochi passi da Temple Bar","Esemplari la cortesia e disponibilità dello staff. Per chi viaggia in auto, è importante sapere che l'hotel è convenzionato con i parcheggi nelle vicinanze, per cui è possibile ottenere un notevole sconto sul prezzo del parcheggio. Ottima posizione per visitare la città, anche a piedi.
Camera piccola e *troppo* rumorosa. L'impianto di climatizzazione appena fuori dalla finestra faceva un rumore insopportabile.
Il letto matrimoniale era particolarmente piccolo. E' vero che nella camera era disponibile un secondo letto, ma non era ciò di cui avevamo bisogno",3,2015,08,17
242,Prima tappa del viaggio in Irlanda,"La posizione è buona sia perché vicina ad una fermata del bus dall'aeroporto sia perché vicinissima, basta attraversare un ponte pedonale, a Temple Bar. Camere piccole e suggerisco di evitare quelle che guardano sul retro perché più rimorse (impianto di condizionamento dell'aria). Colazioni appena decenti. La pulizia del bagno era incerta ed approssimativa.",3,2015,07,09
242,proprio no,"Sono stato ospite di questa struttura per 2 notti , il 29 ed  il 30 giugno 2015.
La camera era situata sopra un grosso impianto di aspirazione perciò rumorosa giorno e notte.
La vasca da bagno presentava dei capelli.
Il bagno era cieco, senza aspirazione e con una lamapada al neon che si accendava e si spegneva ad intermittenza con notevole fastidio di chi usufruiva il servizio.
Ho avvisato 4 volte il personale alla Reception che ha scritto sul monitor i guasti lamentati ma secondo me, fingevano di scrivere perchè la situazione è rimasta la stessa per tutti 2 i giorni.
Il lavandino del bagno non aveva miscelatore ma invece il rubinetto di acqua fredda e di quella bollente; per cui ci si doveva lavare solo con quella fredda.
La posizione, invece, è molto comodo per avvecinarsi alla zona di Temple Bar.",2,2015,07,08
242,Posizione comodissima,"Sono stata in questo hotel durante il weekend di Pasqua con il mio fidanzato e devo dire che tutto è stato perfetto. Innanzi tutto la posizione dell'hotel è ottima: a due passi da temple bar, comodo per il trasferimento all'aeroporto, per gite fuori Dublino.

A differenza di altri utenti, la mia camera era pulita, nuova e ordinata. Piccola, per carità, ma per dormirci e basta era perfetta. Dava sulla strada e sulla discoteca nominata in altre recensioni, ma non ho avuto nessuna difficoltà a dormire e nessun problema di ordine pubblico (ed era pure un weekend di festa). Onestamente non ho trovato alcun difetto che non me lo faccia consigliare. Unica pecca, forse, la colazione che era un po' monotona e povera...si può fare di più. Per quello che ho pagato non mi posso lamentare.",3,2015,06,17
242,Un'ottima posizione a buon prezzo!,"Ho prenotato le mie vacanze in Irlanda tramite Booking.com ed ho scelto questo Hotel proprio in base alla sua ottima posizione.
Praticamente centralissimo!!! Davanti all'Hotel ci sono i grandi magazzini, ed a pochi passi il quartiere Temple Bar. L'autobus dall'aeroporto di Dublino, ferma proprio in O'Connel street... a circa 100 metri dalla via laterale in cui si trova l'hotel.
La pulizia è discreta.
Alla reception sono molto ospitali!
Ci tornerei sicuramente per la comodità!!!",4,2015,06,12
242,Perfetto,"Comodissimo, pulitissimo sia nei locali che per la biancheria, silenzioso (forse dipende dall'ubicazione delle camere), economico...se ci fossero stati l'ascensore e la colazione compresa, semplicemente l'ideale!",4,2015,05,14
242,Céntrico ,"El hotel está recién reformado, las habitaciones son justas, pero adecuadas. Con nosotros no acertaron, pedimos cuádruple y nos dieron una triple( aunque la ofrecían como cuádruple) alegando que uno de los niños tiene que dormir con los padres. El desayuno horrible....lo mejor es que estas a dos pasos de Temple Bar
",3,2015,04,09
242,"No, No...assolutamente no!","Leggendo le altre recensioni su altri siti mi chiedo come facciano gli utenti a dare ottimo a questo hotel.. è agghiacciante, da film horror....posizione ottima, per carità, ma solo quello perché del resto potrei elencare un'infinità di difetti tra i quali: palazzetto fatiscente sopra pub/discoteca soggetta a frequentazioni poco raccomandabili e soggetti iracondi, peggiori di dublino... camere sporche e vecchie; la camera di un mio amico aveva come carta da parati dietro al letto una coltre di muffa e quando gli abbiamo fatto notare che forse non era il caso di farci dormire li (per carità in modo gentile si, ma sbalordito, tipo cascando dalle nuvole..) ci hanno cambiato subito camera...  Tra l'altro credo che anche il personale della reception fosse a disagio nel giustificare tale situazione..un altro amico aveva i vetri della finestra rotti... i bagni non so se risalivano tipo agli anni '30, mattonelle rotte e la doccia non funzionante....
Per favore siate obiettivi nei giudizi...Questo hotel è solo comodo e perfetto di posizione...io mi ci sono imbattuta a causa di recensioni false positive, che mi hanno ingannato...perché al mio arrivo volevo solo scappare!!!!",1,2015,03,26
