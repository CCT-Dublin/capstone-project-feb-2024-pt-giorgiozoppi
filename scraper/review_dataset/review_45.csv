45,Not a 5 star hotel!,"This should not be a 5 star hotel!  Great restaurant & nice looking property, but 80% of the attention is given to the restaurant and not the hotel.  EXAMPLES: 
1- They offer room service (as expected at any 5 star hotel) but frequently tell you the kitchen staff is too busy with the restaurant to be able to provide room service.  So there really is no reliable room service. 
2- One arrives at the hotel and there is no one to help you with your luggage! 
3- Front desk staff and reception staff members are clueless regarding what great service means.",2,2024,07,23
45,"Nice hotel, not 5* to me","Generally a very nice hotel. Especially the bathtub area was great. It is in a residential area, very safe. It is a small hotel, only 15 rooms,  The entire staff was very friendly. The main general criticism was that it seemed to be a restaurant first, hotel 2nd. Also, the only dinner restaurant was a prix-fix menu, more than $300 per person. Would expect more choices. The specific criticism: I asked front desk if there was English speaking news channel on TV.   Now, we generally go to bed early. The gentleman at the front desk offered to come to our room to set it up. It was about 9:30 pm and my wife was in bed already. After 15 to 20 minutes, he couldn't figure out how to get any channel, English or Spanish, on the tv. He said he was sending someone else up, and about 15 minutes later, a woman came up. After about 10 minutes, she called someone else who came up about 10 minutes later, and got the TV channels on after about 15 minutes. They immediately left, with a Spanish speaking station on. We scrolled through about 70 to 80 channels, and while there were two or three channels playing movies in English, we found no news stations. ",4,2023,09,22
45,Hidden gem behind the wall,"This hotel is quite amazing. We were only able to spend one night here but it was a fantastic experience.
It is an ultra modern hotel with superb fixtures and fittings. It was all so very comfortable. The suite was huge and a further huge outdoor terrace.
It is in a lovely area of Barcelona . The excellent breakfast was served on a delightful terrace. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. A thoroughly first class, 5 star experience.",5,2023,08,23
45,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel with great staff.
The experience is amazing already from the  moment you walk in the lobby.
the staff is friendly and professional.
The lobby is beautiful.
The room is just amazing.
I love the breakfast and i love the restaurant abac",5,2022,08,04
45,Superb expérience,"Thanks to a family event and also the Formula 1 Grand Prix of Barcelona , we decided to stay at ABaC with my wife and our two sons .

Located in a very quiet  and charming area of Barcelona, this “Boutique hotel “is very elegant.

And let’s start by mentioning how much the staff is extremely kind, professional,efficient with a lot of empathy for guests.

From the moment you arrive at the hotel,you feel privileged and cared..
We selected Deluxe rooms, very wide, well-equipped, with a modern design.All details are really very well anticipated.…
The Spa is very elegant ,and we experienced very good relaxing massages.

We previously booked the dinner at the 3 Stars Michelin restaurant of the hotel.
A fantastic epicurean experience,with surprising mixed flavors, a deep attention to cooking,and the use of unique local ingredients.

So everything was fabulous and far beyond our most optimistic expectations !

It took me time to find out some points to improve and really thinking about it I would just mention that the restaurant should adopt a dress code policy for guests.

Even if the key point is what you discover in your plates ,which in this case was really unbelievable, having dinner with some ( only some ) other tables where people come in blue jeans,sneakers, « Hawaiian » short sleeves style shirts is not what I expect in a 3 stars hotels.

Usually at this level, Business casual, or jackets are required…I’m not stating that suits and ties should be mandatory , but there should be a minimum ,specified in advance to guests…If there is not a minimum of respect for the other guests and employees, what can we expect in the future? People coming to dinner in Bermuda’s?

Once again, it took me a lot of efforts to highlight a point of improvement but I believe that this should be considered by the restaurant owners …

If you have the chance to visit this fantastic city of Barcelona, DO NOT miss the opportunity to stay at ABaC, enjoy the dinner and …relax..

We will do our best to be back again and again….

P.S: quite sad to have seen Charles Leclerc stopped while leading a  fantastic race on the Ferrari ,because of an unexpected engine failure….But He will be back stronger ! 💪",5,2022,05,24
45,Good times at ABaC Hotel,"We can definitely recommend this hotel. The Deluxe room ist really nice, there‘s enough space, has a samsung speaker, smart tv, a shower, a bathtub… We also really liked Irene from the reception, she showed us the hotel and gave all the necessery information.
Spa is small but nice. The gym was somewhat disappointing though.",4,2022,03,01
45,A VERY special place,Our reception was efficient and welcoming. The room and the spa facilities are superb.  There is excellent attention to detail. Covid precautions were properly adhered to and public areas were exceptionally clean.  The  patio restaurant had limited options and the staff there less attentive than elsewhere in the hotel.  Parking facilities were also very welcome as there is no easily accessible parking nearby.  ,4,2022,01,12
45,A beautiful stay,"Super happy with the hotel. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. They were great with organising tickets to attractions in Barcelona and recommending some sights that are not the usual tourist traps. 

Nice and quiet rooms and far enough from the hustle and bustle. 

On the first night we did have a slight issue with the airconditioning, however on notifying them the following morning the issue was promptly remedied. 

Bed was very comfortable, rooms well appointed. Clean and tidy every day. 

Would like to thank the staff for making out Christmas stay a memorable one. 

Just a note... please be sure to make a booking at the ABaC restaurant 10/10.

Thank you. ",5,2019,12,26
45,"Tough review to write: Great hotel, but ""accessible"" room isn't.","This might be the hardest review I've ever written. So much about this place is fantastic. Warm, welcoming staff; interesting hotel in good location; included breakfast is not to be missed. (We chose the hotel because we were having dinner at the restaurant, which I'll review separately, but in short the restaurant really is as fantastic as advertised.) An easy 5/5 if you don't need an accessible room... but I did.

It's a trek, but you can get to the room from the lobby in a wheelchair. Inside the (admittedly quite lovely room) my very undersized wheelchair could get to most places but not others. There was zero chance at showering while seated. (They brought a stool, but the shower door opens the wrong way so there's no way to transfer.) So i had to wash up at the sink after a transatlantic flight, before and after a stunning meal, and in the morning.

I'll stay here again if I don't need my wheelchair by next year, but otherwise, the false advertising of an accessible room is an absolute crusher. Disabled traveler, beware.",2,2019,12,24
45,"Service is more than perfect, Hotel is beautiful, perfectly located","After being in Barcelona for several times, staying at ABaC hotel was by far the best hotel experience I've ever had in the city.
The Hotel is perfectly connected with the city centre. The metro stops right in front of the hotel and with a max 10 mins ride and only 5 stops you can get to Gracia and plaza Catalunya.
The rooms are much more spatious compared to 5* hotels in Barcelona and the ABaC hotel has a nice little garden surrounded by trees which gives to every room a very relaxing view.  
The interior design is very accurate and modern, favouring a very comfortable stay also for longer periods. Also bathrooms are designed to be relaxing but at the same time very practical.
The rooms are equipped with coffee machine, tea boiler, sat TV with all the main channels in every language and a bluetooth loudspeaker for listening to music.
The staff speaks very well all the main european languages and is always ready to help with any need that a guest might have (from revervation in restaurants, to extra services). Furthermore, the room is always in perfect conditions thanks to the perfect job done by cleaners. You don't see them around and the cleaning service never bothers, but they are always present, morning, day and eve (turndown service)
Special mention goes to the really delightful breakfast with premium ingredients and perfect service thanks to very experienced and empathetic personnel.",5,2019,10,31
45,"Nice hotel, fabulous restaurant, needs a little maintenance for the prices ","I really wanted to rate this 5, but some nagging details prevented me from doing so. That’s a shame because it is a very nice place and certainly expensive enough. 

Our penthouse room was spacious and provided an outstanding roof top terrace to enjoy breakfast or wine at the end of the day. Staff was super helpful, friendly and tried very hard to please. Check in takes a bit of time if you arrive at the same time as others.  The restaurant on site was a fabulous experience - reviewed separately. 

What we continued to notice were the little things. The faucet handles were loose on the bathroom sink. One door handle to the roof terrace was falling apart, no instructions for the complicated lighting system (which we figured out after a day), worn furniture and scuffed floors, and a confusing terrace door system that allows the top of the doors to fall partially into the room. This last item surprised the crap out of us as we thought it was falling out of the frame onto us. More instruction at check in or written placards would have made some of these moot points. If these details had been attended to, this would have been a solid 5 rating. 

The neighborhood is quiet so if you want a nice place out of the city with a master culinary restaurant on site, this is the place. Cheers",4,2019,10,27
45,Amazing,"Amazing hotel, so beautiful and so friendly staff. They will take care of you like a king and queen. Really nice spa and all the services you can think of. The restaurant is fantastic and to visit this place is a must.",5,2019,09,25
45,Fantastic,"Stayed in here at the start of they year for a week and the place was just wow. Food was amazing same with staff. Really comfy beds. Near a tube so you could get about the city no problem. Beautiful city, would highly advice to stay here.",5,2019,08,11
45,Fantastico Hotel in the Fantastico City of Barcelona,"Our  stay was a fabulous experience, from Roberto's assistance via e-mail before we arrived to the kind attentions of elegant Maite and others at the front desk and in the breakfast room.  The property is serene inside and out, with many areas to lounge in the sun or shaded gardens and staff who go out of their way to see to your every need.  Our spacious, sunny room (with 5 or 6 huge, breezy windows) was in a section of the building which necessitated us to walk through the 3 Star ABaC Restaurant kitchens, as we came and left.  It was like a brief glimpse of greatness and fun to see the chefs doing their quiet, precise choreography, as we passed through the gleaming kitchens.  (The hotel is designed this way on purpose, with the intent of making the guests feel ""at home"" and part of the family.)  
   Our room was spacious, with high ceilings and many, many tall windows and bright and/or serene lighting, with many control switches at convenient locations.  The air conditioning was perfect, quiet and easy to control and very precise.  The beds were like sleeping on a fluffy cloud, with feather-light duvets and pillows of the gods.   An alcove was created by three large windows jutting out from the room, which had a wall to wall lounge sofa (about 9 feet long) filling the space and topped with many pillows.  The views were of the leafy grounds and gardens up to the estates at the top of the Tibidabo mountain in the distance.   The rooms have the latest flat screen television, blue tooth speakers, remote controlled drapes and shades, nespresso machines and refrigerator.   The luxurious bath has a glass shower with rain showerhead, a gigantic jetted tub with mood lights and separate toilet and bidet room.  The towels and Bulgari toiletries add to the pampering.  Drapes create a private dressing room, with two enormous, lighted closets and many useful drawers and luggage counters.  Two hints: It took us many days to realize that we could change the language on the tv to English, by hitting the icon of the global world on the keyboard, so that we could search, etc.   The electronic key works with ease on all the gates and doors.  What a pleasure and a contrast to the electronic keys in the USA, which seem to loss their viability after a few hours in your pocket.   
 The Spa area was glamorous yet relaxing, with every possible facility from pool to sauna, steam room and sauna was available. 
Forgot to mention: Breakfast was in a lovely library-like room with the most outstanding croissants ever!  A variety of cereals and egg dishes are offered, as well as a variety of meat.  Ask for the Iberian ham sandwich.  Fabulous!  And the juice and fruit which is served is absolutely perfect everyday.  Also, you can arrive for breakfast up to 11 a.m.   Talk about civilized!  I loved this place.
I believe wheelchair access would be easy from the garage, but you need to check.  Also, the beds are very high, which could be an issue.  Entrances are softly lighted (would not have been bright enough for my Mom with glaucoma issues) and the pathway is large squares of pavers,  separated by a two inch border of velvet cut grass.  It is lovely and  attractive, but someone with vision issues, may want assistance.  

 Barcelona is an exquisite and intriguing city and I hope to be able to return for another visit, but only if I can book my stay at the ABaC Hotel.  Gracias por una visita maravillosa!",5,2019,06,12
45,"Fabulous, well-priced, small luxury hotel","Loved this wonderful small luxury hotel that was a 12 minute metro ride to the heart of Barcelona. We started each day with a gourmet breakfast (included with our room) overlooking the hotel's private garden. Then we literally walked across the street to catch the metro for our day's adventure. Upon our return, we went to the spa to be massaged by jets of water in the Jacuzzi and relaxed in the wet/dry saunas. While the hotel boasts a Michelin 3 star restaurant, we were not able to take advantage of it. We loved being pampered by the staff in this artfully, decorated hotel in a local neighborhood.",5,2019,05,22
45,Very tasteful,"Recently we stayed a couple of nights in the Abac. We have stayed here before, and again it was a most pleasant stay. The rooms are large and very stylish, one of the most tasteful I have ever stayed in. Great bathrooms. We feel at home. Excellent housekeeping: the rooms are always tidy and in order but you never see them work. Friendly and helpful staff overall. Location is nice: outside of the centre's business but close enough and with a metro (L7, Tibidabo) right in front of the hotel (only 8 minutes to Placa Catalunya).

Room for improvement? I do have a few suggestions. The area at -1 is not balanced in my view. The lounge is not frequently used as far as I can see but covers quite some space, whilst the gym is really to small and poorly equipped to actually work out. The pool is small and may in fact be used by 2 persons at the time if you want to swim seriously. Ventilation may be improved. Then again, we never saw anybody at the pool and our kids enjoyed so it wasn't really an issue. Staff is friendly to our kids, but there are not many kids around. In my opinion this hotel is less suited for small children (< 3 years).

Breakfast offers a small supply, but is of high quality. The quality of service is dependent on the lady that is in charge that day. Let's say there is difference between the efficiency of staff. But also here: friendly staff.

Abac is obviously not cheap, but for the high quality it offers I would say it is not expensive either. We had a very pleasant stay and certainly hope to return some day!",5,2019,05,04
45,Luxury that is well priced,"Its a gorgeous smaller hotel, right in the Sarria-Sant Gervasi that we really liked. From the start, reception staff were warm and inviting, and very quick, and we were given an upgrade, thanks! Excellent location and facilities and service, made good use of the minibar in our room, the room was just gorgeous, all beige, pastels, very bright and inviting. Overall, total luxury at an affordable price.",5,2019,02,26
45,Abac Restaurant: an out of this world experience,"For her birthday, I invited my girlfriend there...but it was also a gift for me :-) The experience is not limited to sit at the table and being served. You get to begin your journey in the kitchen and see where the magic gets done. And then, you go from surprise to surprise. I suggest the wine pairing for an augmented experience. We got wines from 1970 and tried also a Jerez 2 palmas. Of course it comes with a price, but once in a lifetime it totally worth it because we are not going to forget it. The service was excellent and we appreciated discussing with the people serving the delights. It is not stilted but rather cool and we had some good laugh and that is also very appreciable. All in all, an unforgettable experience full of incredible and rich tastes. We weren't hosted at the hotel.",5,2018,12,22
45,a delight,"We have chosen the Hotel because we wanted to dine in their Restaurant. ( see sep. review) and also we wanted not to be directly in the centre but with a good connection to it.
The Hotel has a good connection to a sub-way station as well as to bus stops incl. the hop on-hop off. It is not in the city centre but in a great small area with some Restaurants, Bars and Cafes and easy to get to the centre.
Also a little park is just beside the Hotel and our room, No. 821, did have a view towards it. The room was spacious and had a large bathroom with sep. shower.
The breakfast was included and the value for money was great. Just one small issue in regards to breakfast, the service was slow.
We would stay there again.",5,2018,10,23
45,Almost Perfect,"I got the gourmet package for a night in this fabulous hotel. The service was excellent, room was fantastic, and the food at AbaC was amazing. I recommend doing a massage in their spa, it is a great way to relax and chill out before the long dinner.

The only issue I had with my room was late night noise from some kitchen maintenance downstairs. This needs to be addressed, otherwise, it was almost perfect.",5,2018,10,14
45,"Private atmosphere, world-class restaurant, needs some repairs for a perfect score.","I always choose this hotel when I visit Barcelona. It is a luxury boutique hotel, offering a three-Michelin star restaurant which alone is worth the travel.

The hotel is enclosed in a private property only accessible for guests, which allows for a private, exclusive feeling.

Rooms are modern and bright. The penthouse is nice, featuring a very spacious outdoor terrace with a private whirlpool which makes a bit of a worn impression though.

The location within the city is rather noisy, which you do not hear within your room, though, but on the terrace. I therefore prefer the suites which are more spacious inside and also seem lees ""used"" than the penthouse. The furniture in some rooms really needs to be replaced.

One tricky issue: the LED lighting in the rooms sometimes leads to cracking noises, probably due to the heat-related expansion of some materials, so if you're sensitive to that, don't worry, it will stop some minutes after the lights were switched off and have cooled down.

Water pressure in the shower of the penthouse was annoyingly low.

Expect for some these minor flaws, I'll surely return.",4,2018,10,09
45,Nice hotel,"Friendly staff, efficient check in and great service at breakfast.Nice large room, comfy bed so a good night's sleep.my family enjoyed lot service they provide is very good and behavior of staff is so good.",4,2018,10,01
45,Luxurious and relaxing,"We stayed at the hotel as we were eating at the restaurant that night. We booked the gourmet package and stayed in the 'penthouse' as we got a good deal. The penthouse was basically the top floor of the building, accessible by a lift, with a large terrace outside with a table where we ate a wonderful breakfast and a jacuzzi, which although the bubbles weren't working (there were lots of gifts to apologize) it was still hot and relaxing to sit in.

The room was very modern, and with the most amazingly comfortable bed, and a huge curved TV with lots of channels and netflix all enabled. There was also a jacuzzi bath and large bathroom area. Of course, it also had an amazing view from both inside the room and all parts of the terrace. It's in a quiet part of Barcelona too, you could hear the traffic from outside, but it was actually soothing.

We also had use of the hotel Spa, and at 9am, after our breakfast, we had it to ourselves. There was a jacuzzi pool, a steam room, a sauna and an ice cold pool which even I couldn't stay in for long. So relaxing and top quality luxury. 

Of course it wasn't cheap, but for a special night, to go with our amazing meal, it couldn't be beaten.",5,2018,08,31
45,A Foodie Dream Hotel,"I loved staying at the hotel at ABaC.  I bought the food lovers package, not worded that way, but basically that is what it is.  The hotel staff was very nice and pleasant. I was assuming it may be a little snooty being a 3 Star Michelin restaurant.  Not the case at all.  They gave me a “handy” phone which is local cell phone so I could walk around the city and be connected. The best thing about it was no extra charge to use. To get to my room I had to walk through the kitchen to get to the room. I felt like I was in the center of the action.  I got the room with the big balcony.  I went to the spa and then laid out on the chases on my private HUGE patio.  The dining experience was everything I hoped it to be. The wait staff where very informative but also had a sense of humor. I would recommend staying here. It is about 7-11€ cab ride to the center of downtown. Honesty, it was nice to be staying on the outskirts of chaos. ",5,2018,08,25
45,"A Hidden Gem with a 3*** Michelin Restaurant, Perfect for a Romantic Getaway","My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in Abac as part of their Gourmet experience package.  It’s a boutique hotel tucked away in a posh residential area in Barcelona, about 10 minutes cab ride from the city center.  The hotel is a converted property from an old embassy with a 3 michelin stars restaurant and a little gym, spa and indoor pool.

The first night we were staying in the Superior Room. The room itself is on the “smaller” scale BUT it has its own private outdoor patio that wrapped around the corner, which is a super plus to us.  You can easily sunbath here in the sun with a view of the park behind (so rather peaceful) - with partial leafy shade roof.  We eat our gourmet breakfast at the table on the private terrace.  You get to choose items from a menu, be sure to choose as many as you’d like.  The slow cooked eggs is by far, the best breakfast eggs we ever have had, period - definitely worth a revisit just for the egg itself.  I would say this is the best value room for the hotel.

The second night, we stayed in the Penthouse, which I believe it to be one of the best rooms in a city hotel.  You get the lift up to your room, which you have to yourself for the entire floor.  The room is big, spacious and modern.  But the real icing is in its terrace - it’s massive.  There are 3 proper “corner” spaces to lounge, sit, eat, drink and a private hot tub.  We even have 2 of our friends who live in the area came to enjoy a bottle of champagne with us in the evening.  Another noteworthy mentioning is from the penthouse lift, you can go down to the spa/gym/pool directly.  While we were there, we have never met any other guests in the entire stay even though the hotel was full.  It feels more like staying in your own “luxury” house in Barcelona than a hotel.  We had a 22-courses tasting menu at the restaurant and it was excellent.   You also get to go through Abac restaurant kitchen, every time you go from reception to lift (should you choose to - there is another private entrance should you rather be discreet).  

We will definitely revisit the hotel.",5,2018,07,30
45,Fantastic hotel,"The ABaC is a quiet, charming luxury hotel located in the heart of Barcelona.  The staff was wonderful, the room was large and extremely well equipped, the restaurant looks incredible (though sadly I did not have time to eat there), and the grounds are immaculate.  I can't wait to return.",5,2018,07,17
45,Beautiful and not to be missed ,"This place was a real gem - the staff are fantastic, the rooms are stunning with automatic blinds, crazy comfy beds, a lush spa area, a stunning terrace and a fab restaurant! Can’t fault it!!! We spent our honeymoon here ",5,2018,06,17
45,Amazing value for money,"We stayed for three nights in a suite and had the dining package including 3star abac and 1star angel. 

The suite was beautiful, the 30 courses of food over two nights was incredible 

We cannot get over how inexpensive it all was - even the wine flight each night was reasonably priced

Whilst the hotel is really a taxi Into the ramblas and active part of the city - budget €40 a day for that, it was incredible. 

We normally stay at hotel arts but never again 

Congratulations.",5,2018,05,22
45,Very unique and nice!,Forgot to review ABAC last year. My wife and I stayed there for 5 nights and truly loved the place. It is a unique hotel experience. Very private and away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona. We would be thrilled to stay with them again. Wish we had booked a room with a balcony. Regardless our room was fantastic.,5,2018,05,10
45,Perfect!,"Such an amazing hotel. The best hotel we have ever stayed in. As soon as we got there the staff were extremely friendly in getting us settled in to our rooms. We had a tour around the hotel were we got to also see the spa area. Such lovely and modern rooms, it almost has a futuristic vibe to it with the glass elevator and open views. 

Also located in a lovely area, quite a lot of restaurants near by and the metro just outside. The beds were unbelievably comfy if we didn't have so much to do in the city we would have loved to have just stayed in the room all day and enjoyed the rooms comforts. The television was a massive added bonus absolutely huge! Amazing! The bathroom was beautiful a rainfall shower in the centre and a jet tub. Lovely added extras like chocolates on the pillows once we got back to the room. 

Wish we didn't have to leave! Can definately say we will be returning soon!",5,2018,04,15
45,Small Luxury Hotel,"This is a small (only 15 rooms) modern hotel in a good location. Originally it was a private residence and therefore doesn't flow like hotel should, I suppose you could call it quirky!
Our suite was large, very comfortable and spotlessly clean with a lovely bathroom.
The pool and spa was very pleasant for a small hotel.
There was an underground car park which was very handy as it would have been very difficult to park nearby.

Unfortunately we found the staff to be rather surly, a little bit like they were doing you a favour!

We stayed four nights and on one of the nights we dined in the ABaC's 2 Michelin Star Restaurant (now 3 star) and had the 18 course tasting menu. 
The meal was very good but unfortunately the restaurant lacked atmosphere due to other guests spending most of the evening starring at their iPhones! 
Again the staff didn't smile and came across rather cold!

We arrived the day after the Catalan regional election and the following day Barcelona was on strike, so perhaps this may have an impact on the staff.",4,2018,04,02
45,Luxury hotel lacks 5 star service,"This is a beautiful boutique hotel situated in Tibidabo at the end of one of the Metro lines. Although looking tired in places (chipped paint, etc), the room was spacious and very comfortable with a large bathroom with whirlpool bath and separate shower. The hotel has just 15 rooms which is both a strength and a weakness. On the down side, when ringing for room service, it could take several minutes for the ‘phone to be answered. At breakfast, there was only ever one member of staff on duty. Coping with one or two tables was no problem but, when other guests arrived, the level of service decreased and it took a long time to be served. Surely it should be possible for a hotel of this quality to provide additional members of staff when required. Although this is, in so many ways, a wonderful hotel, we’ll probably look to stay elsewhere next time we’re in Barcelona.",4,2018,01,06
45,Beautiful and Quiet Hotel,"The ABaC Hotel is a wonderfully intimate and luxurious boutique hotel. We booked the penthouse and absolutely love the coziness and decor of the room. The beautiful deck isn't the most useful during winter but the private jacuzzi is lovely and a wonderful way to wind down after a day of sightseeing. The rooms are advertised as soundproof and that's mostly true. You don't hear the traffic or noise from the streets but occasionally sounds from the elevator and downstairs can be heard (though to note, I'm supersensitive to sound). 

The service at ABaC is mostly to notch. Irene, who checked us in and helped us ought train tickets and find local sights to see was particularly helpful. However, another front desk person told us it was impossible to get train tickets without going to the station first and seemed completely uninterested in helping us (thank you Irene for making things easy!) 

The restaurant, which was just awarded its third Michelin star, is a MUST if you're here. It is an experience from beginning to end and worth every penny. 

While its not within walking distance of most tourist attractions, ABaC is right across the street from the very convenient and easy to use subway which is only a 10 minute ride to the main square. 

If you're looking for a quiet hotel a bit off the beaten path, this is it!",5,2017,12,13
45,Private Escape in Barcelona.,"ABac was the last stop on our multi city tour of Spain. We wanted to relax and get ready for an early flight back to the states. 
When we arrived to the Hotel it is more of a coumpound in the city. It is very much a boutique hotel behind a large gate. We were buzzed in and in awe as we walked through the courtyard. As you walk through you can tell that time and attention is paid the the exterior of the hotel with well manicured plants and shrubbery. We entered the lobby and were checked in and shown to our room, we booked the Deluxe Suite. The room (and hotel) is very modern in design, the room was pristine with a chase lounge and oversized bed that was incredibly comfortable. Mood lighting illumates tge room as you enter and the minibar is full of delicious snacks. Although this hotel is out of the city center it is close to the theme park and other things to do. We ventured in the city and found great food and beverages and were ready to retire for the evening. The room has an amazing shower with privacy glass so you can see in the room as you shower but if anyone is in the room they can’t see you. With a great waterfall shower and great smelling shower gels. Once we cozied into the comfortable bed we turned on the large Samsung 4K curved tv (I remember this because I wanted one) we were pleasantly surprised to find that Netflix was available. We watched a great movie and relaxed, also the rooms are soundproof which is great because you can turn up the volume and not worry. We woke up enjoyed coffee from the nespresso, packed and were ready to go. We didn’t have much contact with the staff, but what when we did they were all polite and very courteous. I would definitely return to the 5+ star hotel, next time longer!",5,2017,12,07
45,Great location and well appointed,"ABaC hotel is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Barcelona. The perfect distance from the thick of things, just a short metro ride to whatever you want, located in a quiet neighborhood setting. Walking distance to excellent restaurants and shopping. very comfortable beds, excellent shower with rainfall shower head. Michelin restaurant located on premises. Right next door to a nice outside space. A short ride to the airport. i cant think of a single negative. It's all good.",5,2017,11,15
45,Luxury hotel,"Located in the north part of Barcelona, this isn't a luxury hotel with very attentive staff. Rooms clean and is located in a quieter part of Barcelona. The tour bus stops right outside the hotel, metro is easy too.  Spa is amazing. Las ramblas is about 45 minutes walk. Ideal hotel and would recommend highly.",5,2017,10,22
45,great restaurant and great hotel,"what an amazing hotel. staff is absolutely superb, go out of their way to help you. room are splendid, well worth your money. location is great as it is near to a metro station and Barcelona has a good network of metro,so you visit the city cheap and fast. restaurant there is just superb,outstanding. stay there if you can afford it. amazing.",5,2017,10,12
45,Superb Experience,"We were met after our cruise and taken to the hotel where upon arriving were met by the receptionist where the check in was prompt,efficient and very helpful. Our room was exceptional as were the spa facilities.  Breakfast was delicious.  This really is an exceptional member of the SLH,  to date our favourite I honestly don't think there is any area that could be improved on.  Keep up the excellent work look forward to seeing you again.",5,2017,10,12
45,Lovely boutique hotel,"Rooms are excellent. Staff go out of their way to help. The restaurant is an experience. The food was nice and the wine outstanding. Lots of money to spend on one meal, but as I said it's an experience.",5,2017,10,08
45,One of the World's Best Restaurants,"My wife and I have been fortunate to travel extensively throughout Europe and the U.S. and our experience at ABaC restaurant was one of the best that we have had anywhere---a truly memorable experience. 
Even before we got there, whenever we mentioned the restaurant to anyone working in our hotel (The Arts), there was an automatic smile and raised eyebrows because they knew the experience we were about to have. 
One is initially greeted at the door in this very cool, very chic hotel/restaurant and brought by elevator to the restaurant level. One is then brought to an outdoor comfortable table where you are offered drinks and then brought the menu and absolutely huge wine list to make your choices. This takes about 15-20 minutes of total relaxation. Then you are brought into the kitchen where your guide presents the various areas of where the various dishes will be prepared.  Then while in the kitchen two different bites of starters are given to you. You are also given the opportunity to have your picture taken with Chef Jordi who is now regarded as one of the best chefs in the World. 
You are then led to your beautiful table in a beautifully designed modern dining area.  One then is pampered with the next 12-16 courses of foods depending whether you chose the 14 or 18 course selection.  That was the initial meal choice one had to make when you were initially brought into the restaurant. 

Although there are many courses, the portion sizes are just right so that one is not ""stuffed"" by the end of the meal. 
I'm a wine lover and their selection was outstanding. The sommelier is very knowledgeable and helpful as you would expect. We had a delicious 2006 Alion from Ribera Del Duero. 

Of course, this is one of those rare experiences that caries with it a rarified cost. But it is absolutely worth every penny. 
You will need to make a reservation directly with the restaurant, not through a concierge and you will need to make your reservation well in advance, preferably 2 months in advance. 

This is a unique dining experience and one of the best that you can have anywhere in the World. 

This is not listed as Trip Adviser's number one recommendation but that has to be because of the cost. 
BUT THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RESTAURANT IN BARCELONA. ",5,2017,09,29
45,Amazing stay second time around!,"The only hotel we will ever stay at in Barcelona, and they did it again! Awesome stay at a top hotel. Second time in Barcelona, second time we stayed here, first time was 2 years ago. The place is just as good as before with some improvements. Staying here is like being at home, it is our home away from home. The TV and sound system I think was a improvement from last time, its really nice! Wi-fi is fast as well.

Last time we had breakfast included in the stay, this time we didn't, but only cuz we didn't book the hotel far enough in advance where it was a reasonable cost for us, so we skipped it this time, we booked this in Canadian dollars, so it gets expensive. The rooms are worth the price, the room is amazing! 2 years ago we got the room at a really good price, so got the breakfast included, and it was amazing and I highly recommend the breakfast here as it is better than anything we found in Barcelona.
We wanted to order room service for dinner, but we didn't get to it because we ate at our favorite restaurant everyday in Barcelona :). But we heard amazing stuff about the restaurant food!

Tips for travel: So close to the metro (L7) which goes straight to Placa de Catalunya. Perfect and metro is cheap when you get the T-10 metro card (can be shared).
The location is perfect, anywhere in Barcelona you need to metro it anyways, so this is at least one straight line to the main city center. Fast and easy, we would go back and fourth 2 times a day.",5,2017,09,01
45,Amazing dinner!!  Top 5 of our life so far. ,The kitchen visit to the excellent delivery and amazing courses make this one of the best meals you can have.  Ever!!!  You must go to this great restaurant and enjoy some of the best food with a fine wine.    A must visit.  ,5,2017,08,28
45,Changing dates- mission impossible,"The worst experience with the hotel manager over the phone. We have booked the hotel on Chase Reserve Card awards for five nights in  September. Unfortunately my brother passed and we needed to changed the dates for August. We were aware that once we book the hotel with awards we cannot make changes on the reservation. Considering that this is an extraordinary circumstances, I was hoping that this hotel of supposedly five stars would understand and change the dates. I wasn't trying to be reimbursed, simply reschedule. Rooms were available of course. The hotel manager was the most insensitive person I ever spoken to. Rude and abrasive, he should be fired, person like this does not belong in the service industry. Mind you, we have made a different reservation also with awards, same restrictions for September as well, at Chateau Valmer. Amazing handling and understanding of our situation from their front desk over the phone, our reservation was modified without any problems.
The bottom line, ABaC lost not just two customers, we will make sure all of our friends and family never stay at this five stars establishment with zero stars customer service and experience!
In addition, the location is not good at all. Too far away from everything.",1,2017,08,25
45,ABaC Hotel Is A True FIND!!!,"We looked for a 5 star hotel in Barcelona for 2 nights prior to our cruise.  Experience in past travel has proven that that rating doesn't jive in all countries.  When we booked our stay at ABaC, I knew immediately that we made the right choice.  We immediately received a personal email thanking us for the booking & assuring us that we could ask anything that would make our stay better.  I use medical oxygen that needs electricity of recharge.  With only 15 guest rooms, it was a difficult promise to make, but they did have the room ready for us early.  They warmly greeted us & even afforded us a tour of the chef's very busy kitchen.  The room was amazing!  The grounds are amazing!  The service...superb.  This is not a 5 Star hotel, but instead a 6 Star in our books!
We'd recommend this hotel to EVERY ONE looking for being treated in a luxurious style!  Thank you ABaC staff!  You're the BEST of the BEST!",5,2017,08,16
45,Excellent and Unique Stay,"I really enjoyed this hotel, I can't thank the reception and dining service enough! Mateo and Irene at the reception desk really helped me with suggestions and itineraries. I also dined at the restaurant which was fantastic and such a great experience. Every single one of the restaurant staff were tremendous and friendly as well. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience something different then a large chain hotel, I can't stress enough what a fantastic experience this was!",5,2017,08,16
45,"Every town has got it's own pearl, ABaC is Barcelona's one.","Writing this review make's me feel like Anton Ego, the famous recensist from Disney's masterpiece animated movie ""Ratatouille"", in which he quoted that taste is purely personal. Located near the ""Ronda de Dalt"" in a hilly neighborhood surrounded by beautiful single old houses, ABaC lies at a corner of the street where you can see the old tram moving up slowly towards the top of the hills. City center can be reached in a couple of minutes in one of the many available taxi's. 
The hotel has got all the ingredients which you're looking for as a guest. Staff which connect friendliness with professionality and empathy, rooms with all the comfort from calming beds to stunning bathrooms. All of this, including breakfast the way you want, gave us the extraordinary feeling of always coming back when visiting Catalunya.
And we didn't even had dinner in their 2 star restaurant. Can you imagine what a combination this is? We certainly can and will be back as soon as possible.",5,2017,08,04
45,Amazing experience ,This is a awesome hotel with great amenities. There aren't many units so it's always an ease to get in and out. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and would love to stay again. It's close to the subway station so you can pretty much get anywhere.  ,5,2017,08,04
45,wonderful way to spend time in barcelona,"great service with transport to hotel, very quiet facility and wonderful spa. Dinner was a evening to remember. Wish I had the recipe for the desert that was served on a pillow.  It was a sphere of spun sugar filled with icecream and chocolate. The hotel is  spotless and cant wait to return.",5,2017,08,02
45,Great hotel,Fabulous small hotel in Barcelona. A little out of the heart of the city but well worth it. Taxi service and metro are available. Spotless. Restaurant is outstanding. Would not hesitate to stay there again. ,4,2017,07,31
45,Classy Boutique Hotel,"We arrived at the hotel and while checking in, the front desk staff member, offered us a welcome drink while she finished up the paperwork.  We sat outside in a beautiful garden area and had a glass of red wine.  We were then escorted to our room.  We got a corner room which was nice and spacious.  The only issue we had was the room smelt of cigarette smoke.  The staff member insisted that all rooms were non smoking and there was no way that anyone would nave smoked.  She seemed immune to the smell of smoke.  The room was modern and sound proofed.  The bed was extremely comfortable.
The next night we made a reservation at the AbaC restaurant which was rated 2 Michelin star.  It was highly recommended and we were excited.  We were there at 8pm and had a glass of wine while relaxing in the courtyard garden.  They had an array of well dressed staff ready to start dinner service.  One staff member brought out the menu and asked us to select between 18 course or 15 course menu.  We picked the 18 course menu.  We were shown to our table.  
Once seated the waiter told us that the first 2 appetizers would be served in the kitchen with a tour of the kitchen area.  The first 2 appetizers were refreshing and quite good.  We went back to our table.  The dishes kept coming but the girl who explained each dish was not well trained and was hard to understand - she spoke too fast as if she had memorized each description !!  The dishes were quite bland even though the presentation were beautiful.  There were not enough hot dished - quite disappointing.  This is no ""French Laundry'.
After 2 nights in the smoke room we asked to be moved to another room.  This time the girl who came to make the switch could clearly smell the smoke.  We were moved to a smaller room which was annoying.  
The location of Abac was quite far to the main city- 15 euro taxi ride.  
Overall the hotel was quite nice for our first visit to Barcelona.  The front desk staff were very helpful in planning day trips and making dinner reservations.",4,2017,07,22
45,Fabulous Hotel,"A beautiful, calm oasis in a relatively ""untouristy"" area of the city but still just a short taxi ride to the city center.  Rooms are quiet and have an elegant simplicity.  Staff is very helpful and most speak excellent English.  As we had an early am flight, could not take advantage of the Michelin starred restaurant, but the continental breakfast served en suite was delicious. The exercise room, spa and swimming pool were also pleasant surprises. Will definitely return when next in Barcelona.",5,2017,07,20
45,Unique experience with taste of exlusivity,"My wife have booked us there as my birthday gift ... the best one I ever got in my life

ABAC is unique experience for those who love top class kitchen and service.
Booking needs to be made well in advance, few months ahead.

Hard to explain all the details and experience, but the word unique describes is best, from the first moment, during entire stay there that took us few hours to go through entire large degustation menu and enjoying  it fully, till leaving the place... and the mood, taste and absolute enjoyment lasts for weeks ...

",5,2017,07,17
45,"Expensive but beautiful, quiet property","A very small, intimate and well kept property located several km from the city center but just a few meters from a subway station that will bring you there in minutes. Our room was large, unusually comfortable and equipped with electronically operated black out drapes.  The staff was attentive but not obtrusive.  We chose not to eat in its famed restaurant and we were directed by helpful staff to several options nearby. We found this property a slight bit overpriced but not outrageously so; the quiet and care made it a reasonable value.",5,2017,07,16
45,Supreme Service,"The rooms, staff, and service were 5 star hands down. 
Houses a 2 michelin star restaurant. 
Staff gave us a tour of the room and went through everything - including how to work the shower! 

Would stay there again in a heartbeat. 

Parking was 40$ /day - i think this should be a courtesty to their guests, especially since its such a small hotel.",5,2017,07,15
45,Brilliant Stay,An awesome hotel and restaurant experience.  The hotel itself lives up to its promise of s unique boutique hotel with very friendly service and all possible amenities.  The restaurant was simply brilliant - every dish a work of art!,5,2017,07,15
45,Escher Design but Superb ,"This is a very modern style of hotel with a somewhat confusing layout having two elevators and clear sides to the building. This caused some confusion in our party. The rooms are lovely and well apportioned and our terrace was fantastic. 

We ate dinner in the restaurant which was amazing and I'll review elsewhere. 

All in all a little eclectic but rather wonderful",5,2017,07,14
45,Great Boutique hotel!  Fabulous service!,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the ABAC hotel before departing our cruise. Wonderful  personal service, beautiful room and charming property. $15 cab ride or subway to city center from this hotel located in a close-in upscale neighborhood. There is also a 2 star Michelin  restaurant here. However, we were not able to dine at the restaurant during our short stay. Would definitely stay here again. My only negative is that I wish the lighting in the bathroom was better. ",5,2017,07,11
45,give it a miss,"This up market hotel is not centrally located and although aspires to be a 5 star hotel, is far from the mark.

The onsite Michelin restaurant certainly  has the priority here (in terms of staff availability, access, and room service).  This leaves the hotel somewhat wanting.

For instance, during our stay we called on room service from the hotel staff on 4 occasions; 3 out of 4 failed to deliver in a timely fashion. In fairness, they acknowledged the 1 hour plus response time and gave us the items for free.  While that is responsible, it did not meet our needs, and I would rather get adequate service than not pay for what is requested. 

The room (a junior suite) was nice.  The bed was comfortable, the rain shower luxurious, internet speed fantastic and sound and vision very modern. It is a pity that more time is not spent on making this hotel great rather than as an after-thought.

.In summary, the house staff are very pretentious ( I wanted  a bottle of red wine with our evening room service meal (ordered because the restaurant was not available to house guests unless booked months in advance, and I was offered a 1200 euro bottle as the first choice: we settled on a 200 euro wine that met our purposes),  I was advised prior to arrival by the front desk, while trying to orgainse a restaurant dinner that I could not wear shorts or flip-flops.  Really, perhaps I should have asked whether I could wear my room bathrobe and underwear  instead?

I could not, in good conscience, recommend this hotel.  The service was the worst experienced in our 4 week trip to Europe. We were made to feel uncomfortable and not wanted and I have experienced much better options (try El Palace in Barcelona if you want a good hotel).

The 2 star Michelin restaurant may be great but I could not get in to try, and the hotel is very much less than adequate.",1,2017,07,10
45,PERFECTION!,"The best hotel experience I've ever had! This was the first stop on our honeymoon, and it was worth every penny. The customer service and concierge was top notch, any/everything we needed they got us asap. Wonderful with the language barrier as well, as we only knew some Spanish. The breakfast was delicious and the 17 course dinner was absolutely phenomenal! And the spa, WOW! Best massage I've ever had, and the cold pool and hot tub was so tranquil and relaxing. We love ABaC!!!! Couldn't say more wonderful things about this hotel, wish we could have stayed longer and hope to come back one day! Thank you for making our honeymoon so memorable.",5,2017,06,22
45,High standard and elegant ,"This hotel is really 5stars as it has the most wonderful architecture, a fantastic spa with jacuzzi chairs and everything you can imagine! There is a fabulous terrace in which you can eat breakfast out in and it overlooks the charming gardens. They were all so Helpful and professional! We can't wait to come back! Thank you for making our honeymoon so lovely! Emily and Chris humphrey xx",5,2017,06,21

The staff and management : excellent 

Room : excellent 

Service :  excellent 

Breakfast : excellent 

Restaurant 2 star Michelin : an experience not to be missed .

Spa : outstanding .

Would definitely come back to abac hotel .",5,2017,06,10
45,Attention to detail,"It was an excellent experience. The attention to detail that Jordi Cruz' crew had for us throughout the evening was flawless. They made sure we felt comfortable at all times and everything went perfectly. Furthermore, the meal was incredible. Each dish surprised us with exotic flavours and bold combinations we would have never imagined. Congratulations to Jordi Cruz and everyone working there!",5,2017,06,04
45,Beautiful resort,"A beautifully crafted boutique resort. A lovely located away from the busy city life. The staff are generously nice. The cage is lovely. The rooms are nice, clean and fitted with all modern amenities. Beautifully crafted resort. ",5,2017,06,02
45,Wonderful Botuque Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here before going to a wedding in Mallorca.  This is a wonderful small boutique hotel located in an upscale residential part of Barcelona.  The hotel is extremely modern (which may be a good thing or a bad thing), very clean with well appointed, quiet guest rooms.  The staff was extremely friendly and mostly helpful.  This hotel is not located in the center of town, so if you are looking to stay at a hotel that is in the middle of it all, this is probably not the place.  However, there is a bus stop and metro station right outside of the hotel and transportation to the various sites by public transportation is relatively easy.  The Hop-On, Hop-Off Bus also stops at the hotel.  The ""front desk/concierge"" staff tries to be helpful with sightseeing and restaurant recommendations but sometimes falls short of the mark.  One reason for this is that the staff at the desk in the mornings and during the day are extremely busy (answering two phones, buzzing guests into the hotel, working on two computers, having discussions with other hotel staff ) and are often distracted.  Accordingly, sometimes the advise you get is not 100% accurate (e.g., inaccurate travel times, sending you to restaurants that are indeed closed, etc.).  That is the only reason I gave this hotel a four instead of a five star rating.  If you don't mind not being in the center of town, you really can't go wrong with a stay at this hotel.",4,2017,05,30
45,60th birthday lunch,"This is one of our favourite places in the world and whilst now living in New Zealand when deciding on a place to celebrate my 60th birthday there was no where else I wanted to go.
There was a massive welcome from the staff when we arrived and when we got to our room there were 60 birthday balloons and a bottle of wine in the room.",5,2017,05,30
45,"Oh, That Bed!!","We had a very short (unfortunately) stay at ABaC, but I will return just to sleep in that bed again!  It was the most luxurious evening we've ever spent in a hotel.  The rooms are sound-proof, a Nespresso machine is provided, and it had one of the coolest bathrooms.  The staff were thoughtful and helpful, and gave us some great trips for exploring the area.  Although the hotel is located on a busy intersection, inside the beautiful garden it feels so tranquil. Can't wait to return and spend a few nights at this delightful property.",5,2017,05,29
45,This is not just a dinner,"Dinner at this restaurant is a fabulous experience not just somewhere nice to eat.   Go with an open mind, try  everything and experience probably the best cooking in Barcelona. The place is lovely but I was expecting that.   The service is brilliant and probably better than I expected.  The effort that goes into the food is amazing and I couldn't have picked a better place for the celebration I wanted.  They cope very well with dietary requirements (not that I had any) but theses guys know what they are doing so try and let them give you a dinner you won't forget. ",5,2017,05,28
45,I don't even know where to start ...,"A pure moment of bliss and ""rafinement"" as french would say.
The staff, The penthouse room, The spa, The room service  were perfect.
The cherry on the cake was the dinner at the 2 Michelin award winning Jordi Cruz restaurant a pure moment of heaven.
I would say Congratulations to all we will come back.",5,2017,05,03
45,Lovely little property in the middle of the city but rude service,"The property itself is very cute and I enjoyed our balcony overlooking the garden very much. Our room was clean and quite spacious. We ate dinner at the Abac restaurant and the service was appalling we ate at 8 other michelin starred restaurants during our week in Spain; Abac and one other restaurant both had terrible, rude service. There was one memorable dish but not good enough to go back for.",3,2017,05,01
45,Not quite there,On arrival you press a button for entry and in you go to see lovely kept gardens the pavement leading to the main  entrance however is not great for suitcases on wheels be prepared to carry your bags .the staff are friendly and  polite we were taken to our room the penthouse and I have to say first  impressions WOW well worth the extra cost until the tv stopt working and the taps in the sink on the 2nd day one of the staff came up to have a look and said they would get it sorted that was the last I herd (not very good  customer service )I was still there for another 3 days only had my iPad to watch instead of one of the biggest TVs I have ever seen a big selling point for this room I would think!!having said that if these things were sorted out then it would have been perfect the terrace out side was  Beautiful with a  jacuzzi lovely eating area sunbeds and somewhere to have breakfast in the morning overlooking the city .getting down to  las  ramblas was €15 each way in a cab not to bad or about 40min walk.,4,2017,04,14
45,Beautiful experience ,"We finished our 10 day tour of Spain with a lovely stay, spa treatments and dinner at ABaC. The room was very comfortable with nice linens, bath products. Dinner was decadent and delicious, starting with appetizers in the lounge, then a tour of the wine cellar and kitchen before dinner in the dining room. Sommelier was very knowledgable and helpful, staff were accommodating all around. Spa was great treat with multiple baths, sauna, steam room before our treatments. A great treat to finish our trip. ",5,2017,04,01
45,Honeymoon Heaven,"My husband and I chose the AbAc for our honeymoon. We were only in Barcelona for 3 nights but wanted 3 nights of luxury and that is what we got!! 
Champagne on arrival and a free upgrade to the suite! Bonus! 
The hotel is stunning, stylish, fresh and pristine! 
The rooms are spacious with incredible showers/baths and toiletries! The bed is 100% the comfiest bed we have slept in! The sheets and the pillows were out of this world! We are tempted to get in touch with the hotel to see where we can get the pillows from!!! 
We had a meal in the hotel restaurant the first night! The experience was out of this world! So professional and the food was to die for!!! 
We walked to the city centre once, it is literally straight down for 40 minutes and you are in the city centre! We got the tour bus for 2 days and there is a stop right outside the hotel so that was our transport sorted! 
If you don't have breakfast at the hotel there is a lovely little cafe opposite the hotel that do gorgeous sandwiches and coffee and pastries! 
I really can't emphasise how wonderful the hotel was and the staff! I would recommend this hotel to anyone wether it's a stay with friends or a romantic getaway! 
Thank you AbAc for making our honeymoon memorable and spectacular!! 
P.s Barcelona is pretty cool too!! ",5,2017,03,21
45,Great hotel and restaurant ,"We stayed in a large group mostly couples.
 What an amazing hotel and very modern.
The room we stayed very white and a great layout. glass wall to shower and a full wet room so make sure you don't turn the taps if your not ready...
Well situated for what we wanted. Would highly recommend and the restaurant is amazing you can walk through the kitchen it's not every day you can see the team at work.",5,2017,03,19
45,"Location, perfect - quality, assured.","This hotel ticked all our boxes and had none of the things we always seek to avoid. From the moment we were picked up at Barcelona airport the staff could not have been more helpful and attentive. We were fortunate enough to have booked the Penthouse room and, even at the end of February, this was a real bonus (we were also lucky with the weather, in fairness) as we could sit out in the sunshine and enjoy the feeling of seclusion. The hot-tub was also a lovely way of starting and ending busy days sightseeing. The room itself was light, spacious, very well appointed and we never heard another guest (something very rare these days). The novelty of walking through the kitchen to reach reception and the restaurant never wore off, particularly as the kitchen team were always keen to show their workplace off. Such is the ease of using the Metro in Barcelona that the ABaC is perfectly located just a short stroll across the road to the last stop on the L7 which goes straight through the heart of the city and thereby making all the main sights very accessible - just buy a T10 ticket and you'll be surprised at just how good value the Metro is, even though we also walked the equivalent of a marathon in 3 days enjoying as much of the city as we could. The real bonus of the hotel was being able to explore the city among all the crowds and then we could retreat to our haven of serenity and peace away from all the hustle and bustle of city life. We spent four nights there and just wanted it to be longer. Thank you to all of the staff at the ABaC - we will definitely be returning.",5,2017,02,26
45,Fantastic hotel with great staff,"I read many reviews before choosing a hotel in Barcelona and I chose this one based on the good reviews. I wasn't wrong, from the moment you arrive you feel welcome and looked after and the staff are so helpful and pleasant. This is without doubt the best hotel we stayed in and can't wait to return and it goes without saying the food is fantastic too. ",5,2017,02,22
45,Can't speak highly enough About Hotel,"Beautiful boutique hotel, with a great location.  Not in the centre of everything, located in the older part of the town, but this suited us fine.  The hotel is literally a historical building surrounded by gardens.    Very minimalistic, modern, clean and staff could not have been more helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them, they seemed to get everything right.  Loved the bar, loved the cocktails, loved the people.  I can't speak highly enough about this hotel, and would definitely recommend.",5,2016,12,19
45,Luxurious and serene and want to live in this hotel!!!,"This boutique hotel nestled near the top of the mountain was without a doubt one of the most beautiful boutique hotels.  The staff, without any hesitation are nothing short of service excellence.You need anything and in a blink of an eye it is taken care of. The rooms are large, the bathroom modern and so much attention to detail and design. And the bed- I could fall asleep! Barcelona is a magical city- the location of the hotel made me think of Montreal. Do yourself a favour and stay here - it won\t disappoint.",5,2016,11,02
45,Amazing stay,"Stayed here in 2015 August. It was fantastic. Staff was so friendly and inviting, rooms were amazing. They don't have a gym or pool, but they have a partnership with someone so you can leave the hotel and use that. I have no idea where it is because I never used it, but great to have that option. Right next to transit so it's so easy to get anywhere. Loved it. Will be back one day, won't stay any where else in Barcelona!",5,2016,10,28
45,"Stunning food, excellent service","Another wonderful short stay. Can't recommend the restaurant dining experience highly enough. Hotel modern and cosy, service attentive. Check the prices of the airport transfers, particularly out of hours, but otherwise outstanding. ",5,2016,10,23
45,Sanctuary,"The Abac hotel, whilst being about a 10 minute taxi ride to La Rambla was the perfect style of hotel to call home after spending all day touring this busy city. 
The decor is stylish, the rooms luxurious, the staff friendly and the ambience one of a secluded spa resort. We will definitely return. ",5,2016,10,09
45,Amazing,"This was really absolutely amazing. The room was fantastic ( had a suite) and the service excellent yet I had the feeling of intimacy. If you want a treat, that's the place! I also tried the restaurant! A dream! ",5,2016,10,03
45,Great Neighborhood,The ABAC is in an older part of town but has all the amenities of a 5-star hotel. Very minimalistic. Dinner is quite nice and the breakfast is too.  Very nice reception. The room we had was quite small but had a huge curved HDTV.,5,2016,09,23
45,"Trying to be the Ritz and Four Seasons, but not there.","Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights for business.  Very small hotel with 15 rooms.  Grounds are lovely and well maintained in a chaotic busy town. It felt like you were in a different world. The spa and lounge are very small, but nice. No pool or workout area, which I found odd given the caliber of hotel this is trying to project.  I had to walk 5 minutes from the hotel to exercise at a gym, which they had an agreement with.  The room was nice, however there were odd moldy smells from the shower and sink. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were very quite. They forgot to perform turn down service twice during my stay. The room was tiled with a throw rug which was filthy.  The front desk personal were nice, however during check out I had to wait approximately 20 minutes, because it was unattended. The service was poor compared to the Ritz or Four seasons.

The gourmet breakfast was included.  I ordered this three times, because I was not notified 2 other times because of the turn down service.  I requested 7AM in room one day and it arrived on time.  Second day I requested 7:15AM and it arrived at 8AM.  Third time I requested 7:15 and it arrived at 7:30 this is not appropriate for a high end hotel.

The first gourmet breakfast was very good and enjoyable.  However this was not consistent.  Second gourmet breakfast did not have the orange juice order, the ham order, or the pastry basket found this very odd.  Third gourmet breakfast the omelet was under cooked and runny, the shoulder ham was ordered all three times and was serviced differently all times.  I found the lack of consistency to be inappropriate again staying in a hotel of this supposed caliber. Another small touch that was missing was a bottle of water during turn down, again you expect this like this in this type of hotel.

For the money, overpriced for what you get.  I should have looked into staying at the Ritz",4,2016,09,15
45,An incredible gem of a hotel!,"This was our second stay at the ABaC hotel having enjoyed 4 nights there previously in the penthouse room celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.  We said at the time it was a 'once in a lifetime' experience. We were wrong.  Within 12 months we were back in the same room for 3 nights and the hotel didn't disappoint again.  So what makes it so special to us?  Firstly, the amazing private balcony that when you out enjoying the sun, it feels like a sanctuary in the city.  Add outdoor dining and a hot tub and things do not get much better!  Inside the room, the most comfortable bed (it's huge too!) along with understated décor make it a great place to relax. 
Between our stays, the hotel have improved a few things we noticed were looking dated (a new TV and replaced wooden flooring) so it was good to see that they are investing in keeping the room up to scratch. Other things that need investment are the rain shower needs replacing as it doesn't work very well and water leaks out from under the bathroom floor when it is on and it could do with a paint.  However, I must stress these are minor points and would not stop us returning to this stunning hotel.",5,2016,08,26
45,"A lovely hotel, but the restaurant is disgusting","The ABaC Hotel, from the outside, does not look like a hotel, rather more like a modernist mansion of glass, steel, and wood, hidden behind towering wooden gates in a leafy suburb of Barcelona. Once inside the modern-minimalist ethic continues, shaded on the sumptuous side, with electric curtains, B&O televisions, a shower that imitates a torrential rainstorm, and many other dazzling accoutrements. Our experience of the hotel was generally excellent, save for the receptionist bizarrely suggesting that we take the train to Figueres on a day of the week when no such train was scheduled.

Dinner in the hotel´s restaurant, on the other hand, was a terrifying disaster. Months prior to our trip we had sent my wife´s stringent dietary requirements to the hotel reception, asking if the restaurant would be able to accommodate her concerns. We received comforting assurances that the restaurant would be so inclined. When we sat down for dinner, however, after confirming his awareness of my wife´s dietary concerns and promising to adjust the menu accordingly, the waiter refused to disclose the list of courses he had selected, declaring summarily “That will not be necessary. All of the courses I will bring to you will be fine for you to eat.” However, as each successive plate arrived, it was clear that the waiter had simply ignored my wife´s requirements and delivered the standard menu without any adjustments. Here are a few examples:

•	My wife had requested that everything be cooked well done, nothing raw or rare. In fact, she was served nearly-raw mussels, squid, shrimp, and eggs, all of which turned her stomach and would not even sample.
•	My wife had requested that nothing be fried, yet, in fact, was served fried bread and fried seaweed.
•	My wife found the shrimp dish to be disgustingly offensive, as we were instructed to suck the raw intestines, full of fecal matter, from the head of the shrimp.

In contrast to my wife, I sampled everything that was served. Unfortunately, I found all of the dishes to be extraordinarily bland and lifeless, as though all of the flavor had been surgically removed. Many of the dishes´ decorative affectations were simply juvenile, uniformly detracting from the experience. Amid our obvious dissatisfaction the servers became tense and lifeless, repeating their memorized descriptions on automatic pilot.

At the end of our meal, my wife spoke to the waiter about her feelings of betrayal and abuse. In response, the waiter became immediately caustic and defensive, suggesting that we never should have come to the ABaC restaurant, because “this is what we do here.”

I suggest strongly that the hotel management must reinvent their restaurant, invest in all new staff, and create a new culture that starts with respect and kindness toward the client, not to mention delivering wonderful meals with vividly identifiable flavors, honest ingredients, and satisfyingly delicious outcomes. 

In summary, the ABaC hotel itself is very nice, but if you choose to stay there you would be well advised to plan to have all your meals at some other place in Barcelona, at least until the hotel fixes their reprehensible kitchen situation.",5,2016,08,24
45,Great service and very clean hotel,"We stayed at this facility for 2 nights and it was one of the most amazing hotels I have ever been to. The facility is very clean and the staff is amazing . We also had dinner at the restaurant , we had the 15 course menu. It was wonderful .",5,2016,08,23
45,"Upscale,Romantic and very clean",This was our last hotel out off 3 we stayed here for 3 days Saturday and Sunday this hotel has only 15 rooms it's very private. The hotel itself is great there is gardens everywhere and it's made for couples. They also have a spa area down stairs with a humman and also 2 beds In the water with jets. The rooms really pretty big and the beds are sooo comfy. They also have a bath tube and also in the same area have a rain shower which is really neat. We paided 630 for 2 days with breakfast include( there breakfast was very good with a fruit cup also) The gentlemen at the front desk we did not get his name was great he was very helpful and easy to work with. We also ordered tea to the room and the service was great came right away. Thy have some channels in English a lot more than the princess hotel and Olivia balmace which only had 2. There is also a restaurant on site but it only has 2 options a 13course meal(133) or a 16 course meal(170 at 3 hours) I mean it was neat to try but very long. The hotel is a little bit north Off the man area I would say 10 to 15 min ride or the beach around 25 mins. But if you are looking for a quite place to relax with your other and have a upscale hotel this is the one I would highly recommend it. If you have any questions feel free to email me,5,2016,08,21
45,"Restaurant Michelin 2, excellent good price point. ",I had the tasting menu 16 course with wine pairing.  My favorite dish was the quail egg with risotto. It was succulent.  2 dishes out of the 16 I wasn't a fan of.  One was a squid with black ink coated rice.  It didn't sit well on my pallet.  The sommelier was knowledgable.  Overall incredible experience.  I have friends coming next week and told them they must eat here.  ,5,2016,08,20
45,"Fantastic Service, Amazing Room!","What a wonderful experience at this hotel!  We were looking for a nice hotel to stay in for a few days for my young daughter to recuperate from unexpected emergency surgery.  The penthouse suite happened to be available for those days.  Totally private, beautiful view, spacious deck with dining table, loungers and hot tub.  Bed was wonderfully comfortable and the entire staff was so helpful and kind to us.  We were not able to eat in the restaurant, but the room service meals we had were fantastic.  Truly an unexpected delight!",5,2016,08,13
45,Amazing experience !! ,A must ! The staff are out of this world !! Wine list world class !! The beautiful outside seating is class. Each course and wine described beautifully. Thank you so much for this experience. The main thing was that my wife was happy at the end of the evening. ,5,2016,08,08
45,Just great!,"Class and comfort join in this amazing place. In ABaC they care every single detail! It is an experience not just an stay!
Most comfortable bed you can sleep on!
And the service is all the time trying to make you feel relaxed and very helpful if need any assistance. 
Congratulations!

45,👌🏼,"My partner and I enjoyed 7 nights with the team at ABaC. Below are the highlights. 

The bed: Ridiculously comfortable and extremely hard to leave. 

Rain shower: 10/10. 

Metro: The metro stop in 200m away from the hotel, thus making trips into the city a breeze. It's the final stop on the line and only takes 12 minutes to find is way into the city. 

Room service: We were unable to book a reservation in the restaurant which was the only disappointing part of our stay, however the room service is restaurant quality. ",5,2016,07,29
45,"Great room, quiet but distant location, a few glitches","Room amazing, very comfortable and spacious and we had long windows on 3 sides, good shower. Quiet residential location but 10 minute walk to nearest metro or 20 minute taxi ride into the center which was ok but disruptive if you wanted to go back to the room during the day. Good spa although jacuzzi water lukewarm. Only food option is Michelin star abac restaurant, breakfast is €31 per head! Would go back but for a 5 star it has some glitches",4,2016,07,23
45,nice for couples,"this hotel is great. lovely staff with excellent service, clean hotel which is the thing I look out for the most. good for couples, blackout curtains for the huge windows. would recommend. only thing is bottom floors smell heavily like food because of the restaraunt. ",4,2016,07,18
45,Outstanding,We stayed at this hotel on the way to our holiday destination T Costa Brava. This boutique hotel was amazing. The rooms (more like a suit) were very clean. The beds were comfortable. Glass shower amazing. We even visited the restaurant which was top also class.,5,2016,07,06
45,Amazing food,"Simplify exceptional. We went for the more extensive tasting menu as it was my husband's 40th birthday and was blown away with the quality of the food and the service of the staff. We got to meet the chef Jordi Cruz at the end which was lovely. 

Not cheap but worth the money and would definitely return.",5,2016,07,04
45,Great place,We stayed 3 nights at ABaC and we loved this place. The room was superb with a great bathroom and superb facilities. The staff was excellent and everything was perfect. The breakfast in the garden was excellent with great food and excellent service. The hotel is a bit out of town (which we enjoyed!) but the city centre can be easily reached by Metro (10 minutes). Overall an amazing boutique hotel and clearly our first choice for our next visit to Barcelona.,5,2016,06,28
45,Maravilloso,"We stayed here for two nights on our journey from the UK to Murcia and had such a wonderful time we decided to book again for the return trip. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant, nothing was too much trouble. We had dinner in the restaurant and although our dislike of fish can be somewhat challenging with tasting menus, the chefs came up with some wonderful replacement dishes. The wine pairings were just perfect and really complemented each course. We would highly recommend the hotel and restaurant and will certainly be returning.",5,2016,06,12
45,A quiet oasis in a great location,"Absolutely loved the rooms!!! From the large bed with softest sheets to the fluffiest pillows and the nightly turn down service with delicious chocolates! 
Our trip was made memorable by the smiling friendly staff. The check-in included a tour of the amenities in the property and even the kitchen!! 
Our room tariff included the breakfast that was a delicious start to the day with fresh fruits and a selection of breads, meat and an egg dish that is simply out of this world. We were served by an attentive and friendly staff (who is from Chile- sorry forgot his name!). 
The hotel is ideally located away from the tourist crowds but next to all connections for public transport. During our 5day stay we needed the taxi only to and from the airport. 10-12 minutes ride on the metro took you to Plaza Catalunya. From there connections were easy with the Barcelona card. Do not miss the guided walking tour of Park Guell. 
At the hotel restaurant we also enjoyed a special dinner one the eve of our departure. We chose the 16 course meal with wine pairing. They accommodated our dietary requirements to create some delicious dishes! Highly recommend the wine pairing as the sommelier's selection complemented each dish beautifully!! The wine pairing with the dessert was a revelation!! The meal ended with an option to smoke cigars and enjoy coffee after some very creative desserts. Special mention to their wonderful staff for the evening- Ammar! 

What could have been different? 
The entry- The first time you go in, the entry to the hotel is confusing. Make sure you get clear instructions. 
Housekeeping- forgot to replenish toiletries a couple of times- not a big deal though! 
The shower- beautiful and large rain head shower in a tiny cubicle that was not easy to maneuver in and out! 

Overall a great experience that made the trip even more memorable!! 
Highly recommend it for a couples retreat. ",5,2016,06,02
45,"We felt tucked away, at this quiet, romantic, retreat in Barcelona...","We had a suite of some sort, all very beige and white.  Calming and zen like.  The bathroom was fabulous, the living room was nice to have, and the bed was nice and firm.  The room was well appointed, and had terrific lighting.

The check-in/Front Desk staff are terrific, welcoming, and have your best interests at heart.  They helped me with a variety of questions and recommendations, they were all very good at what they did, and how they helped me and my husband.

Of course, the main reason we stayed at ABaC was for the restaurant.  I admit we had been dying to stay at your hotel, so check that one off the bucket list.  But we also LOVE Jordi Cruz restaurant at ABaC!  The service, superb!  The waitstaff knows almost everything about the food, the wine, the preparations, herbs and spices, to the seasoning and cooking of each dish.  Very professional and well trained, friendly as well.  You can also feel the joy the servers and expeditors have in working in such a fine restaurant.  It's easy to tell they are happy, which makes the experience that much more memorable.
I recommend having one of the tasting menus, that way you can really experience the mastery of the kitchen that Jordi has instilled into each dish.  Each a work of art, and full of inspiration!!  Delicious to boot, it's a win, win!!!",5,2016,06,02
45,Beautiful ,"It was all that l expected ,beautiful and serene.Loved the reception ,service and the  food was great.Good location easy access by car or hop-in-tour bus.I loved the glass walled shower room where you can still watch the TV whilst having a shower (or draw the curtains if you wish).A must stay again when in Barcelona and would recommend.",5,2016,04,26
45,Top Ten Epic Experience,"16 courses over 4.5 hours with wine pairing.  Each dish carefully crafted and presented with precision.   All four of us agreed that this restaurant had the qualities of an easy top ten experience for us.  Attentive staff, excellent overall service and amazingly created chef.  Only comments from the two women were that they found a couple of the dishes a little too fishy for their liking.   But we are in Barcelona and the other parties found the fish dishes to be excellent.  The decor is contemporary and could be interpreted as sterile, but that was the vibe at ABaC.  Sleek and detailed.   So a definite thumbs up for a special night out!",5,2016,04,19
45,Awesome!,"We went this April to the Abac-restaurant in Barcelona and were very satisfied. 

Pros:
- Friendly/Professional staff
- Cuisine at a very high level but not through the whole menu
- Nice interior 
- Rather ""private"" tables, with enough spacing between 

Cons:
- One or two courses weren't as creative as they need to be in my opinion

",5,2016,04,16
45,Amazing... Plan to go back,"The staff were amazing, responsive to our every need, many great suggestions to explore the city and super friendly. The hotel is very stylish with great decor. We enjoyed the tasting menu dinner with wine pairings... Heavenly. 

Probably the most comfortable bed we have slept in. ",5,2016,04,09
45,I would love to eat here every week because the food is delicious and surprising.,"The food is so delicious and surprising that I would like to eat here every week. The service is impeccable and de sommelier was able to recommend a very good cava based on our preferences. We had a great evening out and came home late but happy. The restaurant is based north of the centre of Barcelona, just a taxi ride away from our house / your hotel. You do have to make a reservation well in advance.",5,2016,04,01
45,Your Luxury Home in the City,"From the very first moment of booking, to the very last moments of farewell, this hotel was a complete joy. The location is excellent with easy access to the city's public transport system and so to its great sights and attractions. It is also secluded, set in its gardens and grounds, a world away from the hubbub of one of Europe's most dynamic cities. The rooms are superbly equipped and furnished, offering the highest level of comfort and amenity. The hotel's facilities are comprehensive and impressive. The staff are super-helpful - nothing is too much trouble. You will feel safe and well looked after here.",5,2016,03,09
45,"Amazing hotel, excellent staff and customer service","I stayed at Abac Hotel for 3 nights during my Europe trip and it is an experience I truly recommend.

45,Spanish Auberge,"Staying at ABaC  in Barcelona on Jan.18, 2015. I felt comfortable like my home during staying at my room in ABaC with  good hospitality by the young staffs.  I enjoyred sleep on the huge bed. From 9pm, the dinner at 2 michelin restaurant, by the very famous chef, Jordi Cruz. Marvelous dinner. 人気のミシュランシェフ、Jordi CruzのレストランとHotel。少し部屋の扉が重いですが、居心地いいHotelでした。",5,2016,01,25
45,Speechless,"I will never forget my experience in ABaC! I am simply in love. If I could I would repeat it everyday! From the design of the hotel, the food, the Chef(omg) till the service everything was taught about to perfection! The elaborated cuisine that was served was beyond my expectation , every dish was taking us to another level of cuisine. Every dish is well explained, the waiters are these to serve you with a smile on their faces. The amazing chef Jordi Cruz is always there to make sure that we had a great experience and to share with us our special dinner. Honestly I cannot add more because as I said I am speechless. You have to visit and see for yourself! Enjoy   ",5,2016,01,14
45,Could have been better.,"After a 3 night stay in the hustle and bustle of city centre Barcelona we decided to spend our final evening at ABaC for my birthday.  We were very glad that we did this as this small boutique type establishment is well away from the city centre in a rather nice leafy suburb.  It is a rather blocky modern building which is not entirely easy to navigate but that was neither here not there.  Check in was a bit long and drawn out but a welcome glass of iced water followed by a cool glass of Cava in our room was most acceptable. The room was a fair size with large and very comfortable bed, mini bar, espresso machine and well designed bathroom with spa tub, seperate toilet and bidet and rain shower. The shower however, was not great because the taps were on the far wall and you had to get completely soaked in very cold water to turn it on and then adjust the temperature....I got in the tub instead while my husband persevered...successfully in the end.  We took our glasses of Cava to the outside terrace by the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon sunshine for an hour or so.  We had been anticipating dinner, for which they have achieved 2 Michelin stars, and had the longer tasting menu.  We also opted for the wine pairing and at 85 euros per person we had high expectations.  Perhaps we were a little jaded having eaten at 2 one star and one 3 star restaurant in the previous 3 days but we thought it just lacked a beat.  The service was acceptable but completely without passion or enthusiasm and as we rate all our significant restaurant outings we certainly thought that there were one or two things that should not have been on the menu, like the sea lettuce & oysters in aspic...needs improvement.  The wine pairing in general was quite good but I did not think the sake was a great choice though my husband disagrees and the 2 dessert wines were a little over sweet. The wine flight was also by far the most expensive we had so our expectation was for better.  My advice would be to stick with a bottle of white, perhaps an Albarino or Godello to go with all the fish & a glass of red for main course, with a glass of port or dessert wine for the sweet things.  The Chinese bread, Thai Coral, Roasted onion juices & Pigeon however were all excellent. We would come back again, perhaps staying here first instead of last.",4,2016,01,13
45,In serious need of improvement,"This hotel is well past its prime time. We spent one night looking for exquisite comfort and surroundings and found a dated place (its glory might've been 2009!) in serious need of some TLC. We were left under the impression that either the place is going to be sold soon, a refurbishment is already planned (therefore the decor oversights and the lack of a good management) or else it's just plain average. Doesn't deserve the current 5 start GL hotel rating whatsoever.",3,2016,01,11
45,Bitterly Disappointing,"We spent many hours trawling TA for the perfect place to stay in Barcelona for our New Year mini break and finally opted for ABAC. Having now stayed there for three nights, its position, number 10, is either unjustified or the competition must be quite dreadful.

The hotel has good transport links and is only a few metres away from the Avenue Tibidabo Metro Station, at the top of Line 7. The journey to the city centre, Catalunya, is approximately 10 minutes by Metro (2 Euros 15 cents) or 15 minutes in a taxi (approximately 12 Euros). There is also a taxi rank opposite the hotel.

I understood that the hotel was in a quiet suburb, however, it is in fact located on a busy main junction. 

Upon our arrival, in the early hours of the morning, we were escorted to our room, via a working kitchen which had a foul smell of cooked fish. The short experience made me and my partner feel quite sick and made our clothes smell. Whilst the hub of the hotel is undoubtedly the restaurant, and some may be impressed at the sight of the inside of a kitchen, others, like us, would prefer to avoid such an experience.

As we entered the room, it was unbearably hot and it would appear the heating controls of the room are operated remotely as it took many hours for the temperature to fall to an acceptable level. The receptionist made the necessary adjustment without attending our room.

The tap in the bathroom dripped all night and we were woken at 07:00, just a few hours after our arrival and a very long journey, with sunshine streaming into the room because the automatic blinds were defective and would not close. Further, there was an extremely loud revving noise. We reported these matters repeatedly to reception and at one stage it was necessary for me to get dressed and walk to reception as no one was answering the hotel telephone. At no stage did the hotel offer an apology and simply said words to the effect that ""maintenance would look at the problems later."" The blind was shut with Velcro the following day but the dripping tap was never fixed so we ended up putting a towel under the tap to stop the noise.

The bedroom was cleaned twice every day to an immaculate standard. The bed is a good size and fairly comfortable with the mattress topper provided. The lighting is excellent in the room. One strange feature, as other members have commented upon, is the absence of complimentary water in the room. All the more so when mineral water and fruit juices are complimentary in the spa.

The bathroom had a large walk in rainfall shower but unfortunately the bathroom floor flooded each time one had a shower. It was clear from the state of the door frame that this had been a problem for some time. The smashed floor tiles in front of the shower ought to have been repaired, however, again they had clearly been in that state for some time. The toilet and bidet were set within a sleek mirror glass cube room. The jet bath was far too small and ridiculously narrow and so it was impossible to have a relaxing soak.

The spa had a tiny warm pool with metal spa beds, a steam room and two loungers. Fortunately when we went to the area there were no other guests present, however, if more guests had arrived the area would have felt very crowded and claustrophobic.  

Upon check out, the hotel announced that it was closing its doors for a week as they were aware of the problems, such as the flooding of the showers. We made no further comments as Agoda, who have excellent customer service, had given us a goodwill gesture as a result of the problems we had had at the hotel. As others have commented, the reception team are entirely disinterested and fairly arrogant.",2,2016,01,03
45,Fabulous boutique hotel,"A real find ,personal service,well appointed rooms,world class restaurant, all within the heart of Barcelona! We arrived in time for lunch.They had a beautiful garden ,serving lunch outside ,   service and the meal were outstanding.
Dinner in their fine dining restaurant was also amazing as was their wine list!",5,2015,11,02
45,Birthday Surprise!,"My husband treated me to lunch and a night's stay at ABaC hotel for my birthday. Though we live in Barcelona, our stay felt as if we were in a different city. I was in bliss after we arrived and were so attentively treated by all the waitstaff and hotel management. The lunch cuisine was phenomenal, and the presentation stunning. The restaurant atmosphere has a tranquil sophistication, so you feel really comfortable savoring the dishes brought to you in such a spectacular style. These waitstaff are uber chic in their black suits. Our suite was very comfortable and fell into deep slumber after enjoying the spa downstairs. I recommend ladies make an appointment for the Debra Mitchell facial. My face was glowing and rejuvenated after my facial massage with bee venom. This hotel is highly recommended for couples who want exquisite cuisine and and pampering.",4,2015,10,17
45,A nice stay,We stayed at the ABaC hotel for 1 night after a cruise. The hotel is quite a bit out from the city centre so be prepared to use taxis or buses to get around as it's too far to walk to the main hub. The rooms are beautiful and are well equipped and are extremely comfortable. We didn't get an opportunity to eat at the restaurant but did have drinks in the outside garden area. I feel the drinks menu is quite limited and after a long day sightseeing we thought we would try room service but after looking at the menu the options were limited. The staff were helpful but I don't think I would return as would prefer to go for a hotel nearer to the city centre.,3,2015,10,16
45,One of my best experiences!,"At first, it was to enjoy the food. Then once I realised that I will be transported by the tasting menu to another level that I decided to stay in not to carry my tummy. Best decision that I did for my BCN days!",4,2015,10,12
45,"Wonderful Penthouse, great staff but does need a refresh !","We arrived to a very warm greeting and afterwards a tour of the hotel ! 
Its a bit bizarre having to walk through the kitchen to get to your room especially when they are in full service and the kitchen smells in the lift ...especially when there is fish on the menu

That aside the Penthouse is a great suite ...stunning views and the terrace is amazing - the furniture is modern & minimalistic ...nice but is showing signs of wear and tear including in the bathroom which should not be the case when you are paying these tariffs - however we still really enjoyed it but I would suggest a touch up is in required !!!...oopps how could I forget to mention the bed ....total BLISS! best nights sleep ever    

Breakfast is great and the lady who serves is just the most wonderful lady you could ever wish to meet!...even for those who don't like mornings she could make them smile - I'm sure ! 

Its really easy to get in top Barcelona centre, out of the front gate and onto the underground and the tickets of 10 - which you can legitimately share too are great value - it takes 10 minutes 

All in all a nice stay! Thank you",4,2015,09,15
45,A Quality Stay,"We received a warm welcome, a tour of the hotel and facilities and finally a helpful indication of places to visit. The room (Deluxe) was spacious and comfortable. Great ""rainwater"" style shower and jacuzzi tub. Mirrors and glass walls everywhere. Nice B&O TV but pretty useless if you only speak english (fortunately the free wifi is fast enough to support Sky Go/Netflix if like us, you need an occasional fix). I've read previous reviews that mention the great breakfast. There is no doubt  the food was quality, but I do like my full english ..and that wasn't an option. The eggs were fabulous and there is still plenty to eat.  The hotel is very quiet. Only 15 rooms and we only ever saw the occasional couple at breakfast. A very quiet hotel. Very secure and good location; the metro is across the street and runs into Rambles every 7 minutes. The tram and buses are outside the hotel gate. We didn't eat in the restaurant. It's very expensive and I have a limited taste for food so wouldn't appreciate it i'm sure. We couldn't find a decent restaurant in the area but go to Province just 6 minutes away on the Metro and there are some excellent ones to choose from.
So overall, a lovely hotel. We stayed 7 nights but I think this is more suited to 2 or 3 nights. My wife missed an outdoor pool for early evening relaxation with her book. Would recommend it though, just don't expect to meet many people.",5,2015,09,14
45,Lovely,"Great rooms,lovely setting,helpful staff,peaceful but with easy access to everything and the crowning glory of a well deserved 2 star michelin restaurant.........hard to beat
For what is delivered the price is very reasonable.",5,2015,09,14
45,Wonderful stay,"I could not rate this hotel highly enough.  From the beginning correspondence with the concierge was easy and they were most helpful.  Check in was a breeze and they kindly let us check in early.  The room was perfect, spacious and very quiet. Being a boutique hotel, we never ran into other guests, which made our stay feel very private. The hotel is so close to train station and would only take 10mins to get to the centre of town. All staff were lovely to deal with, even when there was a problem with our room key they kindly offered us a glass of wine of their deck while it got sorted. The only thing would be was we wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2015,09,13
45,Just perfect :),"Excellent customer service, spoke very good English with good spacious room and facilities. 
We were greeted by smiling faces readily to help us with our bags on our way in and an excellent staff member who gave us a good background on Barcelona must see spots, followed by an introduction of the hotel and our room. 
We only stayed for a night as it is our last destination of our trip but will definitely be back on our next trip to Barcelona. 
Our only comment to the hotel is to provide bottled water and free minibar. 
This is rather common practice for most other boutique hotels we have stayed IN and will only top off the wonderful experience you have already provided.",5,2015,09,01
45,Amazing ABaC,"My husband and I spent the UK August Bank Holiday weekend here and just loved it.  Our bedroom was lovely and well supplied with premium toiletries and nice touches such as a free hairbrush.  The bed was supremely comfortable and everying was very clean.  The hotel is very well situated.  Its out of the centre of town but the open top tour buses stop right outside and there is a metro station directly across the road.  The metro from Tibidabo runs every 15 minutes and its 5 stops straight into Placa de Catalunya.  There is also a little open air bar over the top of the metro station which turned out to be a lot nicer than we first thought it would be for an evening cava.  Breakfast was not included in the price of our room and, althought it was nice, its a fairly expensive €28 a head so you may wish to head into town and grab a Starbucks.",5,2015,09,01
45,Excellent,"The hotel is secluded and private: you almost may not notice it upon first approach. Our room was spacious and decorate nicely. Also a nice lounge bed inside the patio. A good size bathroom with rain shower and separate bath as well as nice products rounded everything off. The location feels more remote than it in fact is, the metro/suburb stops literally across the street and there is a frequent service to Placa Catalunya (15 minutes), although later in the evening the services becomes rather infrequent (3x per hour). We enjoyed a great breakfast in the garden as well as a wonderful dinner in the restaurant. The hotel staff could be a bit more “out there” – it is very possible to not meet anyone apart from check-in/out and sometimes one feels a little bit like an intruder rather than a guest, especially when taking the needed walk from the hotel side to the restaurant through the kitchen and literally none of the kitchen staff responds to your “good morning” or “good evening” (the same with the room maid). Overall a very pleasant stay but they could do more to be as good of a hotel as a restaurant.",5,2015,08,31
45,"Beautiful hotel, fabulous food","I stayed here four nights, and it was so luxurious and comfortable! Large room, facing beautiful garden, plus very fancy bathroom with rainfall shower and jetted tub. The breakfast, which came with the room, was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute metro ride from La Rambla and all the tourist activities, but I found it nice to come back to a quieter area. The only downside is there are not as many restaurants in the area, and the hotel restaurant is very fancy, not for everyday dinners. Highly recommend though!",5,2015,08,25
45,"Excellent, and slightly peculiar hotel.","Having been to Barcelona in the past, and having camped in the usual luxury hotels, I decided to book my anniversary trip somewhere special, and after some research I decided that the Penthouse Suite at the ABaC Barcelona would be a fantastic idea.
And so it was.

When making the reservation online I was already offered the possibility of adding fresh fruit, flowers, and champagne (all of it at a fair enough cost), so there was less to worry about later on.
The only two requests I had before my arrival, swiftly resolved by email with outstanding professionalism and courtesy, were the prepayment of the room (to avoid possible issues with credit cards being flagged for fraud), and a reservation at the amazing ABaC restaurant, which is part of the hotel (and an aboslute must if you stay there. The chef is a young gentleman named Jordi Cruz who recently won some sort of MasterChef Spain programme, and the property has deservedly received a 2** Michelin rating).

The hotel is located in the northernmost area of Barcelona, along an avenue full of expansive mansions, some new, some old.
Transportation to the centre of the city is very easy through a light-train (similar to the subway) barely 100 years from the hotel, a bus that stops on the very corner of the hotel, or taking a cab at the taxi stand that's at the other side of the roundabout (barely around 10 euros, usually less).

The property is very interesting. It looks like it was designed to resemble a modern mansion designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (I'm guessing... my knowledge of modern architecture is scant). With only 7 or 8 rooms, it could perfectly pass for a huge private house.
Access to the wooden-gated grounds is first achieved through a camera-doorbell (after check-in, an RFID card is given that'll open your room door and the huge gate).
The Front Desk is one floor below, but a friendly smiling woman came up to greet us to the grounds and take us down to the elevator and introduce us to our Front Desk agent, another friendly and excellently mannered woman whom, after the check-in, guided us through a small tour of the hotel to our room, and showed us the room itself.
The design of the hotel allows for guests (I don't know if only the ones staying in the Penthouse Suite or all, sincerely) to walk right through the kitchen to get outside. It's an interesting and mouth-watering experience.

Our room was spacious but not specially big (for a Suite). In fact, the design was more like Junior Suite: King sized bed, and large living space with a couch, coffee table, working desk, and large flatscreen TV in the same room (as usual, we didn't even turn it on, so can't say a word about the cable options). The bathroom was modern and large, with a separate shower and a jetted bathtub (though both enclosed in the same glass structure) with very nice gender-personalised amenities and toiletry kits, and separate WC enclosure. All the furniture was new and impeccable.
One whole side of the room was floor-to-ceiling glass panes (which can be partially or totally blacked-out by motorised curtains)... and then came the room's jewel: the terrace. Or, rather The Terrace.
That has to be a 850sqmt terrace at the very least, and I'm probably underestimating it by 50%. It has two large wicker padded chairs, a beautiful dining table, raised, under an enormous parasol, two recliners for sunbathing, and a very large jacuzzi. We spent more awake time outside in that terrace than we did inside the actual room.

This hotel was just a perfect choice for me: small and personalised, luxurious, extraordinary service, great room, and with awesome restaurant (even if you don't dine there, try their breakfast... I'm usually lukewarm about hotel breakfasts but this was mindblowing). Even the free wifi worked flawlessly (which is most hotels' daemon).

I very definitely recommend it.",5,2015,08,21
45,5 star's accommodation ,"Perfect place for us to spend 4 night's in Barcelona
Very high quality of accommodation,  we were really impressed,  the room was perfect, small , cozy and with a very good wiew on the main street.
We wiil be back again
Its the best place to stay ",5,2015,08,14
45,Good quality ,"Perfect accommodation, we spend 2 night's at Barcelona at ABaC hotel, very close to all main visit point, good price and good quality 
If we decide to visit again Barcelona we gonna choose the same accommodation ",5,2015,08,14
45,Review ,Stayed at hotel and had lunch with reservations at restaurant. Hotel was lovely. Out of the way and just perfect. Reception upgraded us and provided two glasses of a very nice cava. Room was nice and bed was super comfy. Though no pool they have a great spa/sauna area. Only complaint was that there were additional taxes other hotels did not seem to have or charge. For lunch we had the mushroom gnocchi and though we ordered it as starter to be split they decided to give and charge for two portions vs one. One would be hard to split though. Had sea bass and pigeon. Presentation excellent and taste was even better. Worth the experience! ,5,2015,08,13
45,LUXURY LIES IN THE DETAILS,"A critical and negative review as the Abac has potential, is a beautiful boutique hotel, staff is lovely, but can’t be considered a top luxury hotel at all. 
I took the time to list all “details” that weren't quite right, and speak with staff and manager. This email went unanswered and nothing was taken into account aside from putting an ethernet cable (creating a working Wifi network was surely too much trouble). 

I first stayed at the Abac after opening 4 years ago, was impressed at the time ; they have since focused on the restaurant, led by a star Chef and likely more profitable. Much fewer staff was assigned to the hotel than at the time. 
Although hotels in Barcelona set the bar very low for such a popular destination, and have increased prices due to the fall of the Euro, the ranking of the Abac is very surprising. 
If you travel as a group, don’t need flexibility, can plan ahead, apartments are a much better option than hotels in this city, and many hotels are a better option than the Abac. 

You could still consider it if: 
you plan a short stay and don’t need Wifi 
you don’t need to come back often to your room (location is out of the way) 
you can afford a suite (rooms are small)
you aren’t fussy at all about details and don’t expect a 5*L experience à la Mandarin, Four Seasons etc. 

GENERAL 

Staff is efficient, smart, friendly and tries their best. 
Hotel was not sold out unlike most during this busiest season of the year, although their website gave no availability, you could always find rooms on 3rd party websites, which I think is not good practice. And despite “discounted rates”. 
There are reasons for that. 

Location is definitely out of the way and there is nothing around except the metro station going to the center. Yes, it’s only 15-30 min to Catalunya by metro (it runs every 15 min), but you think twice if you want to come back, esp at night. It's a 10-15€ taxi ride every time. 
The Abac could have made up for that by having maybe not a pool, but at least lounge chairs on the grounds. My terrace had none, which made it rather useless. 

The Abac should have a clear parking spot for taxis, and a bellboy. 
First impression upon arrival can be terrible, as you have no idea where to go - and although I’m a big boy, it felt awkward carrying all my luggage. Even coming to the restaurant gave a bad first impression to my guests, as they are lost between the several doors to get in what looks a bit like a fortress. 

ROOMS & SUITES
Very quiet (rare in Barcelona - no banging doors from 7AM as at the Mandarin). Great bed.
 
The largest, the Deluxe varies in size depending on the website, it is actually 31m2 and definitely not the 40m2 advertised by the hotel. Just one small closet… you will feel cramped as a couple and won’t be able to unpack. 
The superior with a terrace are the nicest for the outdoor space. 
I liked the Junior Suite I changed for, although the terrace is on a busy street, so it just works out for late night drinks. 
I was staying for 8 nights, so I would have appreciated a free (and spontaneous) upgrade since they had availability, and I had contacted SLH (which actually offer the upgrade) many times about that. 

REAL PROBLEMS
Main issue is Wifi was mostly not just slow, but non existent. They kindly offered to have a direct line installed to my room, which took 2 hours on the 3rd day; but their whole infrastructure needs to be revamped. Then, I had to go buy an adaptor myself and there was no actual Wifi, just an ethernet wire. Can’t move your laptop (desk was tiny) nor use Wifi on your phone. I explained, insisted about roaming charges, no one acted on it - or responded. 
Likewise, most hasn’t been replaced in 5 years and shows signs of wear and tear.  
The rain shower would flood the bathroom, started randomly at night sometimes, and both pressure and temperature changed dramatically. No one ever bothered to come back to me on this (very important) point. 
Bottled water is sorely missing (plan to buy some outside), minibar not replenished. 
Again, given the location, snacks should be offered during the day. 

FOOD
Breakfast is underwhelming, not on par with luxury hotels. It is brought to your table and doesn’t have enough choices. Served in the room, fresh orange juice was replaced by concentrated. I would write my choices by email, and they never got it perfectly right in 8 days. 
Room service menu is too limited. 
The restaurant: locals consider it very overpriced - the chef is the star of a TV Show. They all recommended to pass.

AMENITIES
There are none, except for a pricey spa. The gym they partnered with is awesome, 10 min walk, huge and clean. 
They charge 41€/day for parking, including scooters, which is absurd. 

INVOICE 
As expected, many undue charges. Not only did they charge my upgrade for more nights than I actually benefited from it (while I insisted it should be free with SLH), but breakfasts were randomly added. 
I would have come back as I like the ""privacy"" and boutique feel, but ... 
although I stayed for 8 nights, was one of the few guests, they never seemed to get what I liked ""right"", and I didn't appreciate having to ask all the time for anything, like getting glasses replaced, a pen, paper…  

Being nice isn't enough to run a luxury hotel, and 5*L guests come to these hotels precisely not have to bother about Wifi or the shower not working.",2,2015,08,11
45,Thank You Barcelona,"Well...good morning to every single reader. I'm reducing my text to a short conclusion: my favorite hotel in Europe! This place went beyond my expectations...congratulations. It worth every penny, no more innuendos, if you want not just a quiet luxury place, nisi a somewhere closer to 'home', just booking here...this is my second post of ABaC because I decided to be anew a guest very soon =D",5,2015,07,30
45,Excellence is what you will get,"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.  With only 15 rooms you will get top notch treatment and experience a truly phenomenal hotel with maybe the best restaurant in Barcelona!  This is a great location as well and close to the mountains where you will have spectacular views.
      ",5,2015,07,27
45,Great Stay!,"Our stay was outstanding.  The location is perfect in a quiet residential area.  The staff, Javier, Irene, Mar, Caroline, Pinar were fabulous.  Loved the room with the curtain and separate seating area.  We had dinner and it was extraordinary and so was the price.  Every dish of our 18 course meal was exquisite, for us, a once in a lifetime experience.  We loved the spa, with the lounges in the water and heated beds.  Breakfast was fabulous!

There are a couple opportunities for improvement, however, mostly mechanical or maintenance related.  The lighting in the hallway (where closets, drawers and safe were located) was insufficient at best and would automatically shut off while working in the area.  These details did not detract from our overall experience, but seemed contrary to the high level of service and execution in every other area.  

It occured to me that perhaps a better experience for the romantic rose petal whirlpool bath might be to schedule some private time in the spa.  It was extremely enjoyable and appeared to be underutilized.

In summary, our stay at ABaC was outstanding and a highlight of our trip.",5,2015,06,30
45,"Second time to stay at ABAC, and looking forward to go back again.","This is our second time to stay at ABAC, I have to say compared with 2 years ago, they have improved a lot, the housekeeping was flawless, very pleasant and cosy stay, very quiet and away from the crowd, but just 2 mins walk to metro station, takes 10- 15 mins to the city centre. Can't wait to go back again.",5,2015,06,04
45,Luxury Hotel,"ABaC Hotel in Barcelona is one of those hotels where you don't have to worry about anything going wrong or being out of place. It's furnishings are beautiful and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. 
The rooms are amazing and the beds were massive, plus use of the spa which is nice. 

It is situated perfectly to either catch bus, underground or taxi all 3 are a matter of 1 minute walk from the gate and can take you all over the city for reasonably small amount. 
If you are looking for luxury in Barcelona this is seriously one to consider. ",5,2015,06,03
45,Private slice of paradise,We have now stayed twice at the ABaC. Barcelona is a wonderful city to visit and the ABaC has provided us with a quiet and private respite.  The staff are helpful and friendly.  The rooms beautifully appointed and quiet.  Ours had a large terrace overlooking the adjacent park and lower lawn of the restaurant.  The restaurant is fantastic and we had one of our best meals there.  It is located at the end of metro line 7. A direct route to down town.,5,2015,05,25
45,A Perfect Stay!!,"The hotel was wonderful & in a great location for the hop on/hop off bus. There was a supermarket within walking distance & the neighborhood felt safe & removed from the typical tourist traffic. The staff was more than accommodating & catered to our every need. The room was comfortable, the terrace gorgeous & the food (for both breakfast & from the room service menu) was delicious! Will definitely stay again & would recommend without hesitation.",5,2015,05,25
45,Quintessential Boutique Hotel Experience,"We stayed at ABaC for two nights. The place is fantastic from a design, furnishing, and amenities perspective. The restaurant (reviewed separately) was nothing short of amazing. We also made use of the spa, which was okay.

The whole experience epitomizes the small luxury hotel experience. That said, ABaC's location is a little isolated, with very few restaurants within walking distance, so you need to take the Metro to access everything else Barcelona has to offer.",5,2015,05,19
45,"Very beautyfool,  Excellent !!!","Very beautyfool,  Excellent !!! I have seen many beautiful hotels in the world. This hotel is one of the best! almost all admirable! I thank the owners and staff for a memorable location in their beautiful paradise! I will definitely recommend it to friends, and more than once he beats them!",5,2015,05,15
45,NO Wow Factor !,"To be fair to this hotel the welcome was friendly, (we were offered drinks on arrival) - although a little unusual as we had to use an intercom to get inside the premises.  It is located on the corner of two very busy roads which initially worried me but sound proofing in the hotel was good. We disliked having to walk through the busy kitchen to reach our room, and thought this was inappropriate for a five star hotel. The room was of a high standard but small. Fixtures and fittings modern as expected it was nice to have a nespresso machine. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we went into Barcelona for the three evenings we were there.  The distance into Barcelona is about 20 minutes by taxi, (approx 10 euros)  - so don't book this hotel expecting to walk straight into the  center of Barcelona. Breakfast was included but we found it to be inconsistent, first morning no menu, no eggs, just fruit and pastries, second morning we were offered eggs, third morning, we had a menu and eggs. Service adequate but not particularly personable.  Disaster with parking - hotel charges 41 Euros, per night, we were told it was OK to park in street, but we were towed from outside the hotel. On departure the hotel contributed 100 euros towards our 200 euro recovery cost.  The whole experience was disappointing.",3,2015,05,07
45,Family vacation,Though small it is an amazing hotel very clean and its restaurant has the best food I have every eaten in my life and one of the most friendly people that you will ever come across I had the most amazing Time can't wait to go back,5,2015,05,03
45,Must get the room with the Garden Terrace!,"Neighborhood:  beautiful, leafy, stately neighborhood just outside the center of the city.  But just a 10 minute metro ride to Placa Catalunya, so extremely convenient to almost anything.

Terrace: We had one of the rooms with an outdoor garden terrace.  This absolutely made the trip.  The terrace garden was larger than the room itself and it was absolutely gorgeous and full of flowers.

Shower: rainfall shower was outstanding, and strong pressure.

Restaurant: See separate review but absolutely outstanding. Interestingly, when you get out of the elevator on the main floor, you walk directly through the kitchen (of a two star Michelin restaurant) on your way to the lobby!

Service: Very helpful staff.",5,2015,04,18
45,VIP treatment is a free beer with terrible service ,"The good:  beautifully designed hotel, very quite, amazing food and good location if you like to be a bit removed from the center a nice SPA and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in
The bad: too many sacrifices of functionality for design, bathroom is beautiful but the sink does not fully empty, the shower has little pressure and will drizzle for hours after usage, furniture slowly falling apart, the iPad is the first edition and there fore useless as the browser is from 5 years ago, and it is poorly cleaned.
The ugly: service is terrible from all points of view not even close to a five star. To date I have refrained from reviewing hotels as I travel a lot also for work thought it could become a full time job.... But this time I really felt poorly treated.  Started with the emails to organize the week end with awful customer service. I was initially told that I could only have dinner at the Michelin starred restaurant at a ridiculous time.  Only after explaining with decisive tones that I had chosen the hotel for the restaurant was I given a choice.  Minimal help in getting things organized in Barcelona and most time not even done right.  On Friday there was no booking at the restaurant we where sent to.  My wife asked for a hairdresser and was quoted 136€ when she got there there was no reservation and was charged 46€!  Pick up was late at the airport and 3 times the cost of taxi. And to top it off I got an email promising a VIP treatment that resulted in a free beer at a restaurant belonging to the same people!!!! Being a patron does not even come close to paying off, we had booked 4 massages, had booked both restaurante and an airport pick up and had breakfast in room everyday... Well all we got is terrible is terrible service.  And there is more examples like breakfast never served at the requested time, taxis called from far away (they do not tell you that they can be graves from in front of the hotel, calls in the room to claim back the breakfast tray, no newspapers etc..). To think that I took the time to drop the man email explaining it was my wedding anniversary...What a pity because with professionals this would be a fantastic hotel.  If they had on tenth of the passion in the hotel service as in the food of the restaurant this would be perfect
I am never coming back and SLH should be ware!!!  And I waited 48hrs to cool off before writing the review...
And of course when we left no one bothered to ask how our stay was.... Maybe Easter week end they had the good staff on holiday?",2,2015,04,07
45,Amazing Stay in Barcelona,"We have been for two nights in Abac Hotel for the first time. We have been in many hotels in Barcelona and we can say that is the Best Hotel in Barcelona. The rooms are gorgeous, we have been in two diferent rooms and the decoration and the materials are very nice.One of the rooms had a great balcony.The rooms smells amazing. The bed is the most confortable of the other hotels, it seems like in heaven. The linen are from very high quality.The pillows are the best ones. The bathrooms are plain of Hermés amenities. There is all very clean: tables, floor, night tables, bath, shower, windows...The curtains are moderns, and there are no walls with the street, but you can not hear any noise neither from the street nor from other rooms. People who work there are extreamly friendly, a very great staff. There is a huge spa that offer different treatments. The breakfast is incredible, we have had the best orange juice ever and the pastry is home made. We strongly recommend to stay in Abac Hotel to have a nice stay and dont fail with the election.",5,2015,03,31
45,Wow from start to finish,"Had an amazing stay at the ABaC Barcelona hotel (as well as an amazing meal at the restaurant). We had a deluxe room and it had floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides (with wood slats outside and drapes for privacy) but the amount of natural light during the daytime was outstanding. In addition breakfast (definitely opt in) was a treat with personalized service and order options. Then there was the relaxing spa facility that was also complimentary. And in terms of location it was at a great spot right across the street from both a metro station and a taxi stand. The staff was lovely, the beds were comfortable, and the rainshower and heated towel racks were perfect. Can't say enough nice things about this hotel!",5,2015,03,23
45,Faultless luxury !!,"this has to be honestly one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in.
The decor is beautiful and very tastefully blended with the old buildings.
The bed is superb and loving the jacuzzi, shower cube what a great idea for a wet room.
Staff were hugely helpful, very polite.
Business trip this time but definitely returning with the wife
Very much top end class about the whole place

45,"When dining at ABaC, stay the night","The rooms are superb. They are beautifully furnished, the bed is divine, and the bathroom is top. The cleaning and the turn down service are excellent. The breakfast (no buffet) is abundant and delicious. The spa is great. The metro station Tibidabo is close to the hotel and it takes 12 minutes to get to Las Ramblas. 
The bar of the hotel is beautiful but cold and without staff or guests. You don’t have the impression of staying in a hotel. At check-in you get your key card; at check-out you pay the bill. 
I would recommend this hotel to stay overnight when dining in Abac restaurant, not for a longer stay. For 350 €/night  you have plenty of choices in Barcelona.",5,2015,02,23
45,Contemporaray elegance,"ABaC Hotel is a small, contemporary elegant hotel located in a park setting.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable with a full terrace with no perceptible street noise.  Fantastic breakfast!",5,2015,02,17
45,amazing 5 stars hotel,"this fabulous hotel is near the famous tibidabo district but not so far from the city, surrounded by a beautiful garden, you will not hear any noise in the spacious modern suites and you should try at least the restaurant one time which is one of the best of barcelona",5,2015,01,31
45,A hidden gem,"I was visiting Barcelona to collect my wedding dress from Sabadell and needed somewhere convenient to stay so I could have my final dress fitting and then collect the dress the following day. I have visited Barcelona several times before and love the city, however I chose ABaC due to it's convenient location rather than as a tourist... plus, I wanted to enjoy my stay and it seemed much nicer than most of the hotels located nearer to Sabadell.

ABaC offers luxury in a modern setting. This boutique-hotel felt much more like staying at a friend's (super impressive, well designed) house, than at a ""hotel"", especially when walking through the Michelin-kitchen to access my room! From the private gate access, to the receptionist greeting me as soon as I'd parked my car, the entire stay was very personal and felt well-tailored to suit each guest's needs. The entire place just felt tranquil and calm.

Staying in the Superior room, with its elongated balcony is highly recommended as this was a very enjoyable space for quietly reading my book and using my laptop. The room itself was a little small, but perfectly comfortable. The bed was incredibly comfortable for a peaceful night's sleep and the bathroom was great too, especially when trying the Hermes toiletries. Everything appeared suitably clean, except when I accidentally dropped a piece of jewellery behind the dresser and so I noticed it was rather grim and dusty in the hidden areas.

Staff were consistently very friendly and professional. I did have one small issue upon calling to request a socket adapter, as after an hour's wait I ended up having to call again to follow-up, and subsequently one was swiftly brought to my room.

I did not get the chance to enjoy the apparently magnificent restaurant at the hotel during my stay simply because I'm not well accustomed to dining alone in public, especially if enjoying such an impressive meal. I did however get to enjoy a fantastic room service dinner, which I found to be surprisingly affordable, considering the restaurant it was served by (again, the balcony was the ideal space for enjoying the meal). Breakfast was also as good as expected with a small menu selection to choose from.

All in all, an incredibly comfortable and enjoyable stay. I would certainly consider staying at ABaC again.",5,2015,01,29
45,Feeling smart?,"Away from the crowds, yet easily accessible, the ABaC Barcelona can leave you feeling very pleased with yourself. It is undeniably chic but understated and friendly. You enter an oasis of calm through a door from the street on a busy intersection. All is calm. Our room was modern and (but) comfortable with nice touches and treats. Oh and if you don't fancy any of the generously given recommendations from the front desk, well it is also home to a Michelin two starred restaurant. Who said hotel food always disappoints?!",5,2015,01,27
45,Amazing,"Fantastic service, amazing food, sublime rooms / beds and beautiful facial and massage. I cannot fault ABaC. It was heaven. From the minute I was asked at the check in desk if I would like a glass of cava I knew I would not want to leave and I didn't. I was so relaxed and happy when I left - it was worth every cent. The staff make this place even more spectacular - nothing was too much trouble and there manner was gentle and efficient. Excellent!",5,2015,01,19
45,Beautiful hotel ,"My only regret about staying at the ABAC hotel was that it was for only one night. The reservation process was made simple by Roberto who was very helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the service was incredible you rarely see places like this in Europe where you have immaculate service, rooms and facilities all in one place. Our room was a deluxe room which was beautifully furnished very modern and sleek. Loved the black out blinds and all the B&O equipment. The bathroom and amenities were fantastic a fabulous rain shower with a jacuzzi bath tub as well. The bed is very comfortable and made for a great sleep. The hotel is close to all attractions in barcelona took us about 10/15 minutes to get to most sites. Along with hermes toiletries which was a fantastic touch. Truly a gem of a hotel. We didn't have an opportunity to dine at the hotels restaurant as they were fully booked but we were given a tour of the kitchen the smell and food did look amazing. The spa at the hotel is amazing as well. Definitely will be staying for longer next time. Absolutely amazing hotel. ",5,2015,01,19
45,"Amazing food, super slick operation","We stayed for 2 nights in Jan 15 taking the Gourmet Experience on offer which included the larger tasting menu at the restaurant.  We also opted for the wines to accompany each course.

The food was outstanding and very interesting, just about all the dishes were a hit with both of us and the wines were perfect.  The staff too were great, nothing too much trouble and the service was very very slick and professional.

Room (standard double) was quite big actually and had everything you needed.  Would've liked one or two UK channels on the TV, even just BBC News, but it was nice not to watch TV at all for a few days to be honest.  Shower very good and LED lighting in the jacuzzi bath as well as remote control blinds and decent A/C.

Breakfast was really excellent, the fruit salad with basil sorbet so fresh and def try the egg cooked at low temp with pomme puree - delicious.  Coffee and pastries and hams if you like - you won't go hungry!

Location is just to the NW of the city and only 10E from the city centre in a cab.  We jumped on the tourist bus right outside to get a feel for the whole city which was great.  Also a station right outside but we didn't use it.

Airport is about 20 mins away and cost around 35E in taxi.

All in all would go back in a heartbeat if staying in Barcelona.  Thank you ABaC.",5,2015,01,12
45,Unique and One of a Kind Hotel,My wife and I stayed at ABaC and we were quite impressed with just about everything!  Very friendly and professionally trained staff settle you in from the moment you arrive at the premise.  The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was extra comfy compared to the other hotels we stayed in Barcelona.  It's well known restaurant did not disappoint as we were quite impressed with food and we cannot wait to go back for another experience very soon!,5,2015,01,11
45,"Wonderful Hotel, Outstanding Service","We recently completed our third stay at ABaC and plan to visit again next year. Obviously, we have had good experiences and have enjoyed the hotel, the restaurant, and Barcelona. Our first visit was for just a couple nights and mainly was to give us a place to stay while dining in the restaurant. On our arrival we were greeted warmly and efficiently. After a glass of cava, we were shown to our room (very nice, modern, and comfortable in the new building) and napped for a few hours (after an overnight flight from Washington, DC). As it was Sunday and most restaurants were close, the staff suggested several tapas places, which turned out to be great. We had reservations at a couple restaurants, which the hotel confirmed. In addition, they suggested sightseeing activities and made reservations for us. We had dinner in the restaurant, which completely lives up to the Michelin stars. (If you do the tasting menu, be prepared for many courses of avante guarde cooking. We found some more to our taste than others, but that is what we expect when we dine with a young, creative chef.) This visit was wonderful and we decided to return the next year.

On our second visit we were welcomed as warmly as on our first. We were given a room in the older building that was very nice and had a lot of character. However, this visit showed a lot about the hotel staff’s character. On the third (of seven) days my wife became quite ill. I spoke with the person at reception and within about an hour a doctor arrived. He turned out to be fantastic (Barcelonadoctors.com). He suggested hospitalization, but we decided to wait the night, which turned out fine. However, I then became sick. Thus most of the time we were in our room. The staff was genuinely concerned. We were able to get a special menu that the doctor suggested and they went out for prescriptions that the doctor ordered. As far as I could tell we were only charged for the price of the prescriptions. Certainly this is over and beyond what one could expect. 

A year later (in late November) we returned hoping to see and do things we had not been able to do because of our illnesses. We were greeted as old friends and treated as family. What a great time. However, this visit showed something more about the hotel. During our stay they were having some painting done. This resulted in an odor in our room. When I mentioned this at reception, our room was immediately changed. What more can one ask? 

The hotel is located in a residential area, but a subway is almost at their front door and easily connects to downtown. After staying in ABaC I cannot imagine a more peaceful and convenient location. We particularly enjoyed a small park that is right next door. In addition there is a taxi stand just across the street, so we never worried about transportation. 

The web site accurately portrays the hotel and restaurant. We have stayed in both the new and the older buildings and have enjoyed both. Believe the pictures and description on the web.",5,2014,12,29
45,Wonderfull stay in charming hotel with great cuisine,"We had one night away with à gourmetmenu by chef Jordi Cruz. We were received very personally by nice staf and got à tour of the spa and kitchen. The room in the new part was spacious, modern with à good rainshower. They take good care of all details, discrete and attentive. Dinner at the restaurant was special, so many amazing tastes and good wine. We had à wonderfull and relaxend night away.",5,2014,12,27
45,Excellent,"Wow, I went there on the 19th of December. I stayed there for one night, I wish I would have stayed longer. I didn't know it was going to be such a pleasant stay. From the very start staff were extremely kind and helpful. They showed me around the hotel and they gave me an excellent room with a huge beautiful terrace thanks to the manager. She was really kind. Wonderful. The receptionist too. They take good care of every detail. I forgot my hairbrush and I was thinking about going out to buy one when I saw there was one in the bathroom! There is also a magnificent spa that you can use if you need to relax and the atmosphere is nice and quiet. The restaurant is wonderful too, great service, excellent food and a unique experience worth having. I was able to congratulate the great chef Jordi Cruz and I will be back there soon, no doubt. Even though I had dinner alone I didn't feel strange at all. They know what they are doing and I can only congratulate them. Honestly, if you ever visit Barcelona, don't miss it. A 5 star stay. I will also rate the restaurant.",5,2014,12,21
45,AMAZING AND UNFORGETTABLE,"The room was very harmonious,peaceful and soundproofed.Wide spaces allow you to move easily even if you have 2 luggages. The bathroom in just amazing. Very clean, big shower and with a ""woman kit"" or ""man kit"" with toothbrush, smoother and even a brush! In the closet you have all you need if you want to go in the SPA of the hotel ( RECCOMENDED!!!) 
High leveled staff wich help you at every time of the day or night. The breakfast is delicious!!! 
If you stay at this hotel you HAVE TO TRY the restaurant and the SPA! The restaurant is lead by the famous chef Jordy Cruz wich can offer an unforgettable tasty-experience in the city.
The hotel is well located. Subway and bus stop in front of it allow you to get to the center easy and in few minutes.
I hope to come back soon in Barcelona for staying in this amazing place!",5,2014,12,15
45,Excellent time at a great boutique hotel,"A great hotel to stay at in Barcelona.  The restaurant has excellent service, great wines and unique food.  The hotel rooms are well appointed, spacious, and very comfortable to stay in. Oasis/spa like environment throughout the hotel.  All staff truly cared about the guest's experience.  It is a bit out of the city but close to Carretera de les Aigües where there is excellent mountain biking for all levels and great views of the city.",5,2014,12,04
45,Neighborhood Gem!,"Perfect service, room had plenty of space to spread out, and the chef on hand is AMAZING!  If you are wanting to stay in a boutique hotel, somewhere you can retreat too after your wonderful day in the city, away from the noise, this is perfect for you!!  5 star service all around!  best price you will find in barcelona for most amount of space in your hotel room!  Cab ride away from everything.  Absolutely try out the Spa, bring some wine, and enjoy while you are there!",5,2014,11,27
45,The most amazing hotel experience!,"My husband and I celebrated his 41st birthday by staying in this hotel and dining at the restaurant. The room and service experience here, was flawlessly perfect. We were far enough from the city center to relax and close enough to get the full Barcelona experience. This was our second trip to Barcelona and too bad we didn't discover this place earlier. I cannot wait to return and stay here again. Words cannot express the hotel's perfection.",5,2014,11,24
45,ABaC is first class,"From the moment you approach ABaC this is a hotel apart. Helpful staff see you being dropped off at the entrance and meet you to take your bags. You sit at reception in comfortable chairs, you don't stand. The rooms are beautifully designed and appointed. Sit in the garden and enjoy a genuine oasis in the city. Breakfast is to die for. If you can find a reason to visit ABaC you must go.",5,2014,11,20
45,Abac hotel,"Loved our little boutique hotel. There are only 15 rooms so everyone on staff knows you personally during your stay. The concierge provides excellent service and recommendations for sights...AND THE FOOD AT ABAC IS AMAZING. One of top two meals we've ever had! Also, check out the spa and massage if you get a chance. It is very small so it is more like a private area for you only.",5,2014,11,12
45,First class,"I've just been checking my contributions and realised I never reviewed this hotel.  I stayed here a while ago so will keep it brief.

Hotel is located in a lovely upmarket area of Barcelona.  Not particularly central but very close to a metro stop and it takes no time to get to the centre.

Room was outstanding. Very spacious with quality bed linen and furnishings.  Lovely to have a separate dressing room.  Bathroom fully equipped with excellent rain shower and Hermes toiletries.  Rooms were also very quiet, our room had a corridor separating it from others.

My partner was unwell while we stayed and management did everything they could to help us.  They arranged a doctor and asked at regular intervals if there was anything we needed brought to the room.

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel as a base for Barcelona.",5,2014,11,07
45,Oasis in the city,"I have stayed at other nice properties in Barcelona, but after eating at ABaC restaurant, I was intrigued by the hotel.  It is fabulous!  The rooms, like rest of the hotel, are sleek and modern.  They have remote controls to open and close the curtains ....from bed!  The service is flawless, and breakfasts in the garden are just idyllic.  It is not centrally located, but it is not difficult to get anywhere in Barcelona from the hotel.  The spa is also a treat... Had one of the best facials during our stay.  We loved it and cannot wait to go back to ABaC!",5,2014,10,25
45,"Great hotel, Great Location and fantastic staff","We have just completed a 4 night stay in the penthouse. On our arrival to the hotel we were early for check in by 3 hours. Luckily our room was ready and we had no issues checking in. We were greeted in reception by a very helpful lady who went through the map of Barcelona, highlighting which areas were worth checking out. Our bags were taken to our room and we were shown around the hotel, given a guided tour showing us the spa, the eating areas and even walking us through the kitchen to go to our part of the building.

Seeing the kitchen with a massive selection of chefs on hand was an experience and it had a real buzz to it. Once shown to our room, we were then show how to operate all lights, tv, shower etc which again was nice to have.

The room was lovely and had a great terrace area with an outdoor jacuzzi. We only had a free little niggles from the room which didn't overly affect our stay but based on the price paid and the 5 star status, really these should have been looked at. the taps in the bathroom were loose, the wiring cupboard didn't shut properly, the curtain were broken slightly at the top which we had to try and prop up to stop the light coming in. The outdoor table and parasol only had one chair so we had to take out on each night from the room and take back indoor each night. The first night the tv didn't work, we called down to reception and housekeeping came up immediately to try and fix, then maintenance tried too. The TV was fixed the next day and on the night it didn't work management sent us up a free bottle of wine for the inconvenience. This we thought was a lovely gesture and just one area where the staff went the extra mile.

Each night housekeeping came up to the room with a chocolate each and turned over the corners of the bed and provided a towel for by our bed. Asking if we needed anything extra e.g towels.This was another example of adding extra luxury to the experience.

We were provided with swipe cards to get into our room, this also was used to get into the gates of the hotel and the building of the hotel. This added extra security to the guests stopping which was nice. 

We didn't try the breakfast because 31 euros each is quite expensive so we went across to the pastry shop each day which cost no more than 5 euros each. We didn't try the restaurant either for dinner so we cannot comment on the food.

The penthouse suite was sound proofed and was a blessing as sometimes you can hear the traffic and busses outside. The hotel is situated near a train station and also 2 sightseeing busses which is very handy. 

The room and hotel was very clean and every day we awaited a set of towels on our sun loungers in addition to the ones in the bathroom. These towels came in handy when using the jacuzzi. 

If we visited Barcelona again we would stop in the hotel again as it was a lovely place to stay and the friendly and helpful staff make the experience an enjoyable one. I would love to give 5 stars for the hotel and it was very close to 5 stars but just those few minor things need to be fixed and then it would be perfect.",4,2014,10,19
45,A luxury hotel in every aspect,"Having seen this hotel was rated as one of the best in Barcelona on Tripadvisor I was sceptical that it would live up to expectations, but it really was quite superb. There is a gated entry on arrival whereby you are required to buzz to enter (on subsequent trips you can use a keycard which is also the one which is used to access the other sections of the hotel like rooms and spa). This instantly gives the hotel a very private feel, secluded from the busy streets outside. 

The hotel is not located in the city centre however there is a metro station right outside whereby you can easily access everywhere you need to go. The metro system is straightforward when you become used to it, but slightly confusing to begin with. You need to buy the ticket named 't-10' which is better value than the single tickets as it offers you 10 trips. Ask any of the hotel staff or station staff they are very helpful.

We booked the hotel through SLH and reserved a deluxe room in hope we would be upgraded to their suite. On arrival we learned that they had two different types of suite, large and small. The large suits where unavailable so we asked to view their small suite and compare it to the deluxe room which they had no problem in accommodating. We chose the suite as it had a more spacious feel, with two living areas. 

The beds are amazing. Full stop. The room was well presented, very quiet, with good contemporary design.

We didn't eat at the restaurant apart from at breakfast but even then we could understand the reasons why this restaurant is so talked about. Breakfast consisted of orange juice, yoghurt and a selection of fresh fruit with basil sorbet, any you can pick any extras from their menu like pasty selections or eggs. 

As for the hotel's staff: They were extremely helpful, polite, calm and professional with excellent knowledge of the city. It seemed like they were eager to go the extra mile to please you. The lady who served us breakfast both mornings was very friendly and treated us like family rather than hotel guests. I believe her name was Pilar.

The spa was superb, as was the steam room and the massage beds in the water. The whole hotel has such a upmarket feel but this really was the icing on the cake.

One thing which became slightly tedious was having to keep walking through the kitchen to reach downstairs unless you wanted to go directly outside however it was nice to see the food being prepared in what was clearly a top class kitchen.

Overall, an amazing experience in a hotel truly worthy of it's reputation. A good way to experience Barcelona.",5,2014,10,18
45,Luxuriously Comfortable in an Elegant Neighborhood,"My disabled mother and my two sisters and I stayed at ABaC in September. We had two lovely suites, each generously sized with its own sitting area and luxury bath. The layout of the hotel is rather like a maze because it is retro-fitted from an old mansion. However, we managed to get around even with my mother's electric scooter. The staff is outstanding. My mother's walker was lost during our flights. When I asked about where to find one to purchase, I was personally escorted by a delightful gentleman across the street to the Farmacia where I was able to find a replacement. Sadly, the restaurant was closed on the Monday we were there, but we enjoyed cocktails, coffee and a delightful breakfast in a dining room overlooking the garden area. We did not take advantage of the spa services, but the soaking pool looked and smelled decadent. I highly recommend and hope to stay here again.",5,2014,10,15
45,"Great people, nice location","We stayed for three nights at the end of September.  The staff is wonderful - particularly the woman who worked breakfast each of the mornings we were there.  The location is great - it is nice to be able to get away from the crazy of downtown.

While I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again and I do strongly recommend it, there are some minor negatives to point out.  We stayed in room 814 - there was a fair amount of noise each night (we think from the kitchen just below us) every night until between 12 and 1.  The sink is a modern design that doesn't really drain; the shower can't be turned on without getting wet; the sitting room and bedroom TVs respond to the same remote, so if you do something in one room it changes the setting in the other.  It isn't like we were really there for TV, so it wasn't a big deal - but things should work.

Do stay there - you will love it - but be prepared for it to be a bit short of perfect - or be better at asking for help than we were!",5,2014,09,29
45,They made the most important day of our life perfect,"Got married in Barcelona on the 31 of July 2014.
We stayed in the penthouse-suite for the night and had our weddingparty in the restaurant.
Will not even bother to go in to details about the meal. We had great expectations but this went beyond all of them. The room was A+. Not the normal ""5star"" with the cheap solutions as you often see in this range of hotels. This was 5 star in a way that most hotels should not dear dream of.

But what stands out is the service and the dedication from the staff. We can not thank you enough.
You dont get to test your flow in the kitchen and waitstaff before you serve a halfdrunk norwegian wedding with 10 speaches that mess up your routine. 

Thank you Jordi Cruz for the perfect meal,
but most of all THANK YOU CRISTINA.
You made our wedding!",5,2014,09,22
45,"Beautiful property, pleasant stay","My wife and I stayed here for three nights and were in a room with a large outdoor patio. The room was extremely nice, including the bathroom, and the patio was a  huge plus, as we ate breakfast out there every morning.   The staff was extremely engaged and helpful.  The location is great, as it is a quick ride on the L7 line into the center of town, but it is quiet up the hill at the hotel.   We used room service many times and it worked great.   We did book well ahead and that seemed to give us a great price on a room -- just an observation.  The airport is about 20 minutes by taxi.  Definitely a great choice for a Barcelona stay!",5,2014,09,07
45,Oasis in Barcelona,"I real gem in a busy city, the Abac really delivers on its promise of a boutique hotel. Set outside the city centre the staff recommended the metro for getting around, with a very nearby station it proved a great way of getting around. The room was very spacious and luxurious with an amazing bathroom. The hotel feels very intimate and quiet with the restaurant something really special and well worth a visit.",5,2014,08,30
45,"Pulled all the right faces, but forgot to sweat","The title of our review is a saying that means that someone put in the appearance of doing something, but with no real care or effort - this was our experience at ABaC. Here is the list of things that were sub-standard for a luxury hotel:
In our room, the front door lock, curtains and tv were all malfunctioning - none of which were fixed during our three day stay (in fact staff simply said ""we know"" as if nothing could be done).
In our room the shower walls and ceiling had mould growing on them as did the hand basin; the backing was peeling off the curtains, some of which were partially hanging off the rails.
The door to our corridor was chocked open as the locking mechanism was broken (and had been for some time).
The ""concierge"" had no tourist information, recommendations for restaurants outside the hotel and could not supply a map of Barcelona.
When asked if we could get more milk for the coffee machine (two small pods were supplied) - we were told ""no"" as it is ""complementary"". We purchased our own at a local store at 12 for 60 cents.
On the last day there was mould on my brioche at breakfast.

We cannot recommend this hotel and would not stay again.",2,2014,08,19
45,our stay at the ABaC Barcelona,"We stayed in ABaC restaurant & Hotel for 3 nights.  Our stay at this hotel was excellent from the time of check-in; when Roberto welcomed us and explained all about the hotel and about some of the tourist attractions in the city, right up to the time we left the hotel.  We would recommend the full breakfast which was excellent and the lady that served was very helpful, unfortunately the restaurant was closed while were staying. Although on the outskirts of the city the hotel was adjacent to the metro which took you into the city centre in a matter of minutes, beside a tour-bus stopping point and beside the ""Blue Tram"" stop which took you to the funicular railway  We would definitely come back and we would make sure it was at a time the restaurant was open. thank-you to all at ABaC",5,2014,08,17
45,Great place,"Very modern and comfortable place to stay, a block away from the train station to La Rambla. In a busy area, but the rooms are quiet. Shower was amazing. My wife and her parents enjoyed massages in the spa. There is no lap pool, just a wading pool in the spa. The main focus of the hotel is the restaurant which has two Michelin stars and is fantastic. Hotel, facility, and restaurant staff were all very pleasant and helpful.",5,2014,08,11
45,First Impression,"Dear Hotel Manager, 

Hope you are doing well. 

We have just checked in to our room and looking forward to experience ABaC services for our last destination for this summer trip. 

We are in wedding & event planning industry for the pass ten years in Asia and would like to share a little feedback about our experience with your team. 

Upon our arrival at hotel, we are trying to intercom with your team about that we got 6pcs luggage. One of your team member come and help out but i do not think that she are able to handle it as all luggages are heavy. We are offering whether there is a trolley or male colleague could help. At the end, both us need to handle another 2 luggage and some paper bags. One of the luggage fall down and knock on my feet, im standing there and non of your team members offer any help to ease the situation. Im really disappointed with this.

When we checking in at the reception desk, receptionist would like to get our passport and we have mentioned that could we do it later after i have unpack my luggage. The receptionist insist us to present the passport. One of your team member saw the situation and offer us to do it after we check into our room.

The receptionist didn't get my name correct on the check in form. Its appear Steven and there is not even my email address. I have received several email from your hotel and keep remind me that we are one of your important guests. Your team will give us all help whenever we ask, but it seem like i didn't experienced any VIP treatment since my check in. 

When im at your front desk and ask for whether hotel provide any complimentary bottle water and the respond that i got is a word"" NO "" . We have work with luxurious hotel around the world and always understand that hotel policy may vary. But customer services should be equal to your hotel standard when handling customer inquiries. 

One last thing, we didn't receive any welcome gift in our room. Through our event experiences for the pass few years, customer commitment should be the core value in every hotel. 

Hope our feedback will bring up a discussions in your team and looking forward to the rest of our staty.",3,2014,08,05
45,Beautiful,".My partner and I arrived at the ABaC hotel looking forward to a fantastic holiday in this wonderful hotel. We weren't disappointed. It is truly amazing. Staff who are attentive without being pretentious. Our check in was a relaxing and very welcoming experience..Thankyou Christina for making us feel so special.. our room was beautiful with the most amazing Tv I have ever seen. We were greeted each morning by the lady serving breakfast (Pilar) I think was her name. Sooo friendly .We had the pleasure of eating in the restaurant on Tuesday evening. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE.  The most spectacular food I have ever tasted. Thank you to (Mar) who waited on us the entire evening.  The only down side and its a very small down side was the fact that I had booked us in for 4days with a continental breakfast. This meant for 4 mornings we had fruit,orange juice and a selection of breads. If we wanted cooked food it meant we paid another 31 euro each every day. A liitle steep. The hotel is very convenient to the tourist bus stop and also the tram which takes you up to the most amazing views over Barcelona.  All in all we had the most relaxing break we could have wished for and hope to return, Thankyou team ABac.",5,2014,07,03
45,Very Special Place,"My daughter and I only spent one night (sadly) at this marvelous gem of a hotel in Barcelona. 
It is located in a lovely neighborhood; we were so pleased the moment our taxi pulled up and we discovered this perfect spot. As we had just flown in and it was a bit late, we immediately got seated in their smaller dining room and had a very special dinner. Most original food presentation and very tasty. Then we were escorted to our room, which was beautifully designed, immaculate, and very fashionable. I would love to design my own bathroom at home like this. Latest (it seemed to me) European modern elegant design, materials, great shower, beautiful sink, tub, etc. Just a lovely place. We also had a nice breakfast in a pretty enclosed garden in the morning. Want to go back!!",5,2014,07,02
45,A small jewel in a beautiful city,"I spent one night (only unfortunately) at ABaC and it was a great experience. This small hotel has great rooms, services, and the quality of the food is outstanding. I did not have the opportunity to enjoy the restaurant because it was the weekly day close, but I experienced the room service with great aperitiv and snacks and breakfast in the morning.
The room is really nice with outstanding bathroom and high quality furnitures.
The personnel is keen to protect the privacy as well as the location and the way to access the hotel makes it a perfect choice for persons want to keep a low-profile and defend the its own privacy.
Service is accurate and gentle.
The only negative note is about the price that is in the high-range for such class of hotels.",5,2014,06,30
45,the best experience of my life,"this hotel when you arrive its in the best location, but it looks very much hidden behind a high fence, exclusive is the definitely  the word. inside is perfection. the staff how ever are polite and highest service with out being snooty.
the famous chef Jordi cruz you will see sitting with guests, his food is the best you will ever try in your life.

the cost is totally within reach and so much worth every single penny. will i go back, too right i will
the best place to visit for a short break or long. the spa is award winning.",5,2014,06,27
45,Incredible,"I was taken here for my birthday recently as a surprise. The treat was the 16 course menus with the wine pairings and a night at the hotel. Wow. 

The room was very well decorated with a separate bedroom, amazing bathroom with a giant tub and a phenomenal shower that was like standing in a hot rain storm. The bed was incredibly comfortable (especially after the 4 hour lunch) and the living room very comfortable.  I loved the whole experience. 

The hotel is in a very quiet posh neighbourhood with a trolley in front that runs up to the funicular railway to the top of Tibidabo. There are some fun bars near the top but very little else around though the Metro is close by.",5,2014,06,20
45,Wonderful boutique hotel,"This small boutique hotel was wonderful.  From the minute we checked in, everyone made sure our stay was perfect.  They made reservations of us at local restaurants, arranged tours and site seeing, and helped us as we checked out and discovered the rental car agency had no more cars even though we had a confirmation of reservation..  They went above and beyond to get us to our next location.  The rooms were wonderful and very quiet and luxurious! The restaurant was fabulous and it was our highlight meal while in Barcelona.  We are so happy we spent 5 days enjoying this hotel!",5,2014,06,16
45,Best ever experience,"We stayed for just one night , wish so much we booked for longer . I can not recommend  the hotel and restraunt more .
We had the grand ABaC , a 16 course meal , it was incredible , my taste buds were taken to places I have never experienced . The service is impecible ever thing is done to military precision in a very relaxed atmosphere . Be prepared to give the meal at least 4 hours , it will not be shorter but you will savour every minute 
The bedrooms  are very comfortable , with everything you could wish for .
Thank you Paul",5,2014,06,11
45,Fabulous Boutique hotel,"So pleased we picked this amazing hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Everyone was really helpful, polite, friendly and welcoming. Breakfasts were amazing . Hotel as stated is sound proof. A secluded hotel with first class service. Great views. We stayed in room 812 with a fantastic terrace. 
the Metro was literally across the road and so this was really easy to get to the centre of Barcelona, the beach etc etc.
We would highly recommend this beautiful hotel. 
Thank you to everyone at the ABaC",5,2014,05,26
45,Wowee wow wow wow!!!!,"Talk about living in the lap of luxury. My husband found this hotel on Trip Advisor and we had high expectations with the excellent ratings. We were definitely not disappointed. We loved everything. The room had fun electronic blinds, the most absolutely comfortable bedding and bed, a super modern bathroom complete with an LED lighted spa. The spa downstairs was AMAZING!! The pools, steam room, heated stone loungers were great. My only regret was not staying longer! ",5,2014,05,26
45,Fantastic Stay,"Truly relaxed and great staff - with Jordi's food, made an exellent weekend.
The area is a little in the back of Barcelona, but great to get away from the hectic center.
Just top nuch and I would recommend it at all times.

45,Wonderful hotel with an amazing Restaurant,"This luxury hotel in Barcelona is like an oasis of calm with first class, friendly service for the duration of the stay.
We booked the hotel because we wanted to eat in the restaurant. The service, the food, the atmosphere are first class. Considering the quality of room, service etc. this place is good value for money.",5,2014,04,30
45,ABaC never disappoints!,"This was our fourth stay at ABaC, and this stay only confirmed why this is our favorite hotel in Barcelona (and possibly the world!)

We again stayed in the room on the top floor because we love the deck, the view and the hot tub after a long day of walking in the city.  We had a remarkable lunch at the incredible restaurant on the first floor -- an experience not to be missed.  They were filming B roll of Jordi Cruz, the Michelin starred chef, for his judging position on the Spanish version of Master Chef.  The grounds are beautifully maintained and so peaceful away from the rush of the central city.  Although the streets surrounding the hotel are reasonably busy, you don't hear a sound in your room.

But it is the staff of the hotel that really make this hotel extraordinary.  They are attentive and personal.  They arranged tickets for an FC Barcelona game at Camp Nou for us without any fuss (much simpler than us trying to do it from the US on short notice).   They helped us figure timing and transportation for several of the things we were doing on this trip.

But our favorite staff member is the lovely woman who serves the fabulous breakfast in the morning.  She has been there since our very first visit and she is just a delight!  By your second breakfast, she knows your beverage choice and brings it to the table.  She even sent us off to the airport with a bag of the amazing fresh baked pastries on our last morning.  I feel dreadful that I do not remember her name, but it is that kind of person and personality that can make a wonderful hotel so memorable!

We will keep coming back to ABaC!",5,2014,04,10
45,Lovely hotel. Fantastic staff.,"My husband and I spent a long weekend at this fantastic hotel and could not recommend it more. The meal we had in the restaurant was the best meal we have ever eaten. Absolutely superb!
The hotel is a little out of the centre, but very close to a tube stop, so this isn't a problem at all. Our room was fantastic. There was an extremely comfortable and spacious bed and we had modern furnishings throughout our suite. 
My husband was involved in a road accident the evening before we were due to return home and I cannot thank the hotel staff enough for their help, thoughtfulness and kindness. They truly went out of their way to make things as easy as possible for me.",5,2014,03,09
45,Wonderful stay at this very beautiful hotel,"Absolutely fantastic stay at this beautiful and very stylish hotel.  The room was one of the nicest we've ever stayed in, and although expensive it was worth it. Very warm welcome (and glass of cava) from the staff who cannot do enough for you. 

The rooms are beautiful and have everything you could want - if you are into modern style and architecture then this is the place for you. Superb bed and bathroom and plenty gadgets to keep you happy! 

We enjoyed lovely drinks and cheese on the terrace for a light lunch, before heading out for a stroll around the surrounding area which although not in the central tourist belt (this is a good thing!) is a lovely residential area.  The metro is a few meters away and is very easy and cheap to use to transport you around Barcelona. 

We enjoyed an hour in the small spa which was lovely and almost like your own private spa as no one else was in it. The heated beds are a must for weary tourist legs! 

Dinner in the evening was absolutely superb, not to be missed. 

Similarly breakfast in the morning was one of the best I've ever had, very high quality and local ingredients imaginatively served by a charming lady who looked after us so well.  

Overall superb experience and a place I would love to return to.",5,2014,03,02
45,Amazing Stay,"If you are looking for the perfect boutique hotel to stay in, in Barcelona look no further. The only problem with this place is that the bed is cozy and amazing, it's hard to get up and get ready to tackle the city sights! Enjoy your stay.",5,2014,01,30
45,Great hotel - perfect service,"My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and the hotel is amazing, exactly how the website describes. It's very clean, we had a lovely room and, although slightly out of town, it's in a great location. Being slightly out of town allowed us to go for a really nice walk up the Tibidabo mountain (hill?) Which I think we'd have missed if we were in a more central location.

The service at the hotel was second to none. Greeted late when we arrived after midnight, with a glass of cava and the staff were immediately willing to show us the best locations to go in Barcelona. Also as we were staying for an anniversary, we chose to book a table at the hotel restaurant in advance (mainly because another review mentioned it was difficult to book in advance - thank you!) We had an awesome meal, 13 courses of some of the most amazing food ever, and the staff were brilliant all the way through, giving advice for wine and describing each course in English perfectly. We even had an additional course of chocolates and sweets that we definitely were not expecting.

Lastly, my wife was ill on our last night (not due to the hotel) and the staff in attendance (David and Paloma?) were brilliant - helping us get an earlier flight and being exceptionally understanding.

Despite the illness, we had a great time here and would highly recommend anyone consider this hotel. It's not cheap, but with every penny...",5,2014,01,12
45,Relaxing post Christmas get away...,"Spent a week in the ABac hotel over the post Christmas/New Years period. On arrival staff came out to help take our luggage from the taxi and the glass of Cava as soon as we sat down to check in was most welcome. Staff were friendly and accommodating, one member in particular took significant time to outline the various sights and hotspots in Barcelona on a map and provided details on how best to get around the city, in addition to showing us how to use the various amenities in the bedroom and bathroom. The rooms are very modern and chic, yet comfortable and cosy. Rooms have all the nice touches including bathrobes & slippers, comfortable couches and beautiful linens. My only gripe was the hair dryer which you had to hold the button down on permanently - a tad out of kilter with the standard of the rest of the amenities and the lack of any face cloths. We ordered room service on a couple of occasions (always omelettes) which was tasty and nicely presented. Breakfast is lovely...my favourite had to be the basil sorbet served with the fresh fruit salad. The bar downstairs is a cool spot for pre dinner drinks too. This place is pricey but is very well run...rooms should probably be a bit bigger however given the price.",4,2014,01,02
45,Birthday trip made very special December 2013,"Would highly recommend this hotel, the room was very clean, very well appointed , king size bed extremely comfortable and bathroom included both a rain shower and  jacuzzi bath. The staff were friendly, very polite and could not do enough for us. I received complimentary fresh fruit with a birthday card sent to the room which was a lovely touch to the very personal service we enjoyed throughout our stay. The breakfast was absolutely scrumptious, and the restaurant taster menu was a gastronomic delight. It is located in a quite area but with easy access to places of interest. The open top bus route and the metro all within 2 min walk of the hotel. The spa was an added bonus though small if hotel full. R Ince Lancashire UK",5,2013,12,18
45,Fantastic Hotel. Faultless Service,"My wife and I recently returned from a weekend in Barcelona having been recommended to stay at the ABaC Hotel.

On arrival, the staff could not have been more polite and could not have been more helpful. After a brief check in, and a quick tour of the hotel, including the kitchen, we were taken to our 'Deluxe' room which was perfect for our 2 night stay. The facilities in the room included high speed wi-fi, a B&O TV, and Nespresso machine. The bed as other reviewer's have also said, was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. 

The hotel has a luxury spa with complimentary refreshments. Needless to say, we used the spa every day during our stay and found that we were in fact the only guests to use the facility.

The hotel is situated across the road from the subway which is the headstop for the L7 (Brown line). Within 10 minutes you are walking down La Rambla.

We didn't dine in the restaurant so can't comment, but if you want to stay in a small luxury hotel away from the hustle and bustle of central Barcelona, stay here. You can't go wrong.

We can't wait to return to the ABaC.",5,2013,11,27
45,Top notch gastronomic experience,"This is a place to take someone you really want to treat and enjoy a great dining night out. Ambience and atmosphere are very nice and create a warm, modern feeling. The chef prepares a couple of small welcome surprises for everyone to taste followed y in house baked bread. Wine list is extensive (especially in Spanish wines as one would have expected) and sommelier has done an excellent job in combining wines with food. We went for the degustation menu which involved several small plates. Highlights of these were the beef tartare done in 2 separate ways and the egg. These are ABAC signature dishes and i would go back again and again to taste these. Main dishes and deserts also at similar gastronomic levels with the starters. Service was very attentive by extremely profesional people. It is a joy and pleasure to see people like ABAC staff that take great joy and pride in what they do, this feeling is passed to the client in the utmost professional/friendly/discreet sort of manner, my deepest congratulations on the service.",5,2013,11,21
45,Lovely hotel with excellent restaurant !,"This hotel was a bit away from the centre of Barcelona, but it was in a nice and lovely neighborhood. We had a suite and even though we were next to the road, we couldnt hear any noises from the roads outside. The Subway is just a cross the street and takes you straight down to La Rambla. The bed was very big and With the best cushions I have ever had in a hotel. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful. We celebrated our proposal there and while we ate at the restaurant the staff made a very romantic setting in our room With candles and flowers in the bath. 
The restaurant itself is worth the stay. The placement of our room made us walk through the Kitchen and what an experience. Wathcing twenty cooks create dinner was an Incredible sight. We went for the Grande menu with sixteen tastings. This sounds much, but is well worth it. Explosions of great taste in our mouth for every bite. The staff at the restaurant were very helpful and knew exactly when to serve and how to do it. Well worth a two star Michelin rating!!! If you are going for a romantic trip to Barcelona and want to celebrate something special, this is the place for you !
All in all, I couldnt get more satisfied With ABaV and their staff :)",5,2013,11,07
45,Top gourmet palace in Barcelona,"Quite a taxi journey from the port to the gates of food mecca ABaC at the foot of the mountains, but well worth it. Buzz the door at the gate, which swings open to a revel beautiful gardens and discreet luxury palisander architecture. This elegant two star restaurant also houses a hotel with 15 rooms. We were set for lunch, and had three starters. Large round tables generously spaced in a kool dining room on the minimalistic side, Zalto champagne glasses taking care of texture and bouquet. The sommelier were informed of our lacking competence on white Spanish wine, and with a hint of preference pointing to the Ramonet chassagne at €140, he recommended priorat wine Mas d´en compte 2008 from Cal Pla. Lovely elegant wine, mineral and rich almost without oak. The kitchen impressed from beginning to end, the servuce was considerate, friendly and as loose as possible at this level of fine dining - but never stiff. It seemed they took their pride in knowledge and presentation, and we felt immensely taken care of in a friendly and relaxed way by our Argentinian maitre and his MMA-looking sommelier. They and their staff of waiters did their best to secure not our luxurious lunch, but also were helpful making reservations and recommendations at similar restaurants for the rest of our stay. Mixed crowd, relaxed dressed catalan intellectual couple, the omnipresent plastically surgery of Americans discussing their favorite topic (themselves) and local beauties from the Catalan capitol, elegantly dressed. The dining hours are quite a challenge, having 7-12 course lunch at 4 and then dinner at...11? 12? But this food and wine temple is a must when visiting Barcelona for the food experiences. Nitro cocktails, gazpacho as sorbet, tiny gnocchi filled with liquid (!) parmesan, yuzu desserts, the meal is a gem from start to finish, well worth the bill just short of €380 including a well deserved although generous tip. The compositions are a delight for the eye, fun to eat, impressively considerate and intelligently manufactured. With the horribly stressed frenetic dishes fast-food delivered at well reputed Dos Palillos the night before, the perfect timing of each dish at ABaC was an  academic pleasure of epic fine dining in our new favorite fine dining country. ABaC, we salute you!",5,2013,10,30
45,Out of the way but worth it,"We stayed at the ABAC hotel in Barcelona for 4 nights. The location was away from the main touristy part of town which made it very quiet pleasant. However, It was close to an easy to use metro so we had no problem getting to the main attractions.The service was wonderful; the staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms were very modern and comfortable. Our only complaint was the bathrooms were a little too modern - the shower was unusual - one room for both the shower and tub even though they were separate.",4,2013,10,29
45,Never coming Abac!,"I stayed two nights in September, and the stay was a disaster from start to finish. To be honest, I just want to forget the experience, but I’m going to put it up here anyways. While there were several issues – the main one involved a “he said, she said” situation. When I left the room one night, I returned to find my IPAD on the bedside table, with the screen smashed in. I went down, met with management, and was advised that the cleaning lady left a report that she had found it that way when she entered the room. I didn’t take this news particularly well, given that I know the IPAD was fine when I left the room. I was promised another meeting the next day after the manager had talked to the cleaning lady. 

The next day the manager tried to avoid me, despite repeated attempts to talk to her. Finally I got her at reception. She gave me every excuse in the book – “perhaps it fell off the table when I left the room.” I’m told I should have left it in the safe. I’m given a story about cameras.  I’m told that the cleaning lady is a valued employee, who has been at the hotel since it opened, and they believe her.  The bill for my two night stay ended up being close to 2000 Euros – and I’m being told fairly rudely, that I’m a liar.  

I’m not somebody that deals with confrontation, I avoid it all costs – and the last place I expect it is at a five star hotel, when I’m paying almost 2000 Euros for a two day escape. Anyways – despite telling me she is the manager, eventually she sends me up the food chain to Hector – who I guess is the real manager. Hector’s not at the hotel, so I send him an email, explaining the situation, and tell him, that I’m not particularly thrilled to be charged 1,958 Euro’s for two nights, a lunch, and two massages – and then be told by the manager that they believe the cleaning lady over the customer.  

The response from Hector only makes thing worse. He tells me that the previous person I dealt with handled the situation exactly the way she should, claims she never called me a liar, and tells me that while the price I paid for their services was considerable, I should consider the quality of the services.

Well Hector, in considering both the quality of the services, and the fact that your employee effectively called me a liar – I believe your hotel is lousy. 

Your spa is terrible.  It’s tiny – there’s one small change room for both sexes – without a shower in it. The reception/sitting area is in the same room as the Jacuzzi – so it’s about 85 degrees and humid in there. The air conditioning was broken the day I was there. I was told by the masseuse that they were supposed to fix it, but hadn’t gotten around to it.  You have two massage rooms – only one of them has a tatami mat – so when my wife and I both requested Thai Massages – we were told we’d start off in one room, then half way thru, we’d switch rooms. In other words, half way thru the massage, we have to leave the room, wait ten minutes for them to clean the rooms, then we switch rooms and finish the massage. Not exactly relaxing – especially when we’re paying 135 Euros for the massage. 

At lunch at your hotel, I told the server I didn’t like mushrooms, and asked if he could substitute a dish – I was told no, I couldn’t – and in addition to that dish, three other dishes came with a mushroom broth. At the same lunch, I said I’d like to try a local white wine, and was rudely given three choices by a hurried waiter – oaky, not oaky, or a little oaky – as if they were the only considerations in white wine.

And management is appalling. If you have any kind of issue, expect a poor response. 

I’ve got a couple of young kids – I don’t get away as much as I’d like, or as much as I used to. The point of staying at expensive five-star hotels, is the notion that you will be taken care. Instead, I had my ipad smashed, dealt with confrontation, lost sleep, and had, what should have been a nice two day vacation ruined.  

Anybody staying at this hotel should reconsider – there are plenty of other nice places, with much better locations, that I’m sure take care of their guests. Avoid this place at all costs.",1,2013,10,22
45,Spa is a joke,"We booked two Thai fusion massages at th Abac spa. When we arrived at the spa, you re told to change outside in a washroom. There is a tiny pool with two chairs in it, but they are right beside reception. Not exactly relaxing, and we didn't bring swimsuits. The steam room, which is a larger version of the personal shower ones, is also right beside reception with no walls in the extremely tiny place. The air conditioning was broken when we were there, so the room was extremely hot. nothing better than being covered in sweat for a massage. Then the masseuse, who was also the person at reception, told us there is only one room they can do Thai fusion in, so they made us have half the massage, get dressed, sit outside in the steamy hot room, and then finish the massage. Not an enjoyable or relaxing experience.",1,2013,10,22
45,Chic boutique hôtel,"A very nice 4 night stay here. Situated away from the main downtown areas near where the tram stars its climb to Tibidabo. Opposite taxi ranks, bus stops and underground links so travel easy. 2euro gets you a tube ride to central Barcelona, or about 8 or 9 euro by taxi. You can hop on/ off
the open top tourist bus which is a great way to get a perspective of the city's layout.
We stayed in the penthouse which was fun. You have to go through the kitchen to take the direct
route to the restaurant which affords a glimpse of the smooth running professionalism of the chefs, cooks and staff. No shouting here! We had the very simple continental breakfast served by
a charming lady who was very kind to us, and the receptionists, particularly Paloma were friendly and helpful with recommendations and bookings of various museums etc.
Just great",5,2013,10,20
45,Nice modern small hotel.,Rooms were large and modern. Staff very friendly and helpful. Beds are a little firm for my taste. Great coffee shop and bakery across the street. They would exchange Dollars for Euros at fair price with no service charge.,4,2013,10,16
45,"If you want a little peace and quiet but still be close to the heart of Barcelona, this is the place","ABac Barcelona is a very modern hotel located a little outside of the crazy hustle and bustle of the city. The staff is great and the rooms are large and comfy.  There is a wonderful bar and restaurant in ABaC for you to enjoy and head back upstairs.

This is the perfect place to stay if you want to go walk the Ramblas, but enjoy quiet most of the time",4,2013,10,02
45,very nice,"All the reviews are right: perfect hotel, fantastic location, staff helpful...
comfortable room, very clean, not so near from the center but near to the tram and bus station, also you can reach easily the airport.
highly recommended,",5,2013,09,24
45,A quiet place conveniently central in Barcelona,"On a recent stay in Barcelona we had five very comfortable nights at the ABaC.
Its location is just far enough from the inner city of Barcelona its airport and cruise terminal for some real peace and quiet.
Our room was open to natural light with electric curtains,extremely comfortable, clean and quiet.
The free wifi was fast and easy to connect with.
The hotel is right on the underground rail line, on a red hop on/off bus stop and the yellow one as well and across the road from a frequently utilised taxi stand.
All the staff were extremely helpful and spoke good English
The concierge managed to get us tickets to an FC Barcelona game during our stay which was an experience in itself - not to be missed on any visit to Barcelona
There are many small cafes within walking distance as well as a small quiet park adjacent to the hotel itself.
The included breakfast was sufficient and tasty.
We are unable to comment on the restaurant or spa as we did not utilise either during our stay however the restaurant was busy on all nights during our stay.",5,2013,09,22
45,"Stunning, modern, perfect hotel.","I stayed at the ABaC for a week with my fiance. The ABaC was and is the most modern and amazing hotels I've ever stayed in, and I have stayed at some amazing places. There are only a few rooms, making this place very exclusive. From the moment you enter your room, you feel like royalty, with 2 huge flat screens, a massive couch, the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in and a bathroom that will impress the pickiest travelers. It is a stones throw form the metro making getting around Barcelona a breeze. I would not even think about staying anywhere else. And the restaurant is in my top 3.",5,2013,09,03
45,Luxury,"We stayed for one night in a junior suite this summer. We knew the hotel from visiting their fantastic Michelin restaurant a few years back and were looking forward to a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, the restaurant is closed on Sundays, so we didn't get to enjoy it, but we were not disappointed with the rest of the hotel. The suite was 45 sqm of luxurious interior! The breakfast was as fantastic as expected (so was the room service). A quite expensive experience, but totally worth it - if not for the food or the interior, then maybe just to sleep in the best beds in Barcelona...",5,2013,08,25
45,A fabulous 5 star boutique hotel !,"I don't know where to start from when I arrived it was an experience, I was offered a glass of cava with a hibiscus flower inside already I was in love , than brought to my room the room was spotless and absolutely beautiful from window treatments to the amazing bathroom , it's a open room concept and the shower was the best part it was a huge rainfall shower head , now it's only has 19 rooms so very small if you want loud and party central this is not for you , if your looking for romantic quite and the best food in Barcelona than this is your spot !!! 
The Resturant has 2 Michelin chefs need a say more ! Ugh from start to finish everyday the breakfast was the best thing ever the poached eggs to die for !!!!! Than the dinner hands done the best I've had thus far we did the tasting menu well worth the price is a once in a life opportunity the staff is wonderful and made us feel the whole 5 days like royalty I recommend this for couples and singles also small families with older children , I will be back for sure next year !!!!",5,2013,08,09
45,Gorgeous Hotel!,"I stayed at ABaC for 2 nights. It's a gorgeous place with all the amenities. The rooms are beautiful and modern. Each room comes with its own iPad, excellent wireless connection, refrigerator and mini bar. The beds are extremely comfortable with fine linens. The restaurant, although good, is expensive. Across the street is a delicious bakery with every type of croissant and baked good, fresh juices, etc. The location is good, but to get to main sites a taxi is needed.",5,2013,07,22
45,Fantastic Boutique Modern Hotel,"Staying here second time on our return trip to Barcelona, super friendly staff! Large spacious suites with all the modern conveniences, with beautiful shady terrace! Did not try the restaurant but have heard from numerous people that it is fantastic.",5,2013,07,21
45,Wonderful boutique hotel away from summer hoards,"I'm staying here at the moment, sitting in a supremely comfortable bed. The rooms are huge, the bathroom is larger than my college room. When we arrived here at 3.30am the other night, Roberto welcomed us very kindly. We slept like logs and groggily trudged downstairs to the outdoor deck within their discreet and verdant garden, and were welcomed with a beautiful breakfast. The pain au chocolat and other pastries were delights, the orange juice better than any I've tasted since I was in the south of france, the coffee perfect. The outlook from our room is onto the tibidabo hills. Had dinner at the 2-michelin starred restaurant last night and it was incredible, 155 euros pp - great value. A bit further from town than other joints, 10mins on the metro, but not at all a big deal. I will be back!",5,2013,07,14
45,Best hotel of our entire honeymoon,"Sitting here trying to write this review it becomes obvious that it's hard to fully describe how wonderful everything is at ABaC. The hotel staff is warm and friendly, the grounds are absolutely gorgeous and the room is phenomenal. We booked the biggest suite they have and it is absolutely stunning. A rooftop room with a huge patio, an enormous bedroom and an awesome design. The room was comfortable, beautifully appointed and very romantic. We were extremely happy with it.

However, the room and service were dwarfed by the accomplishments of the kitchen. ABaC houses a 2 star Michelin restaurant and, needless to say, it is absolutely fantastic. The food is phenomenal, the service wonderful and having such an exceptional restaurant right in your hotel is a great experience. Even the in room dining is the best we've ever had. 

ABaC is fantastic overall. There are really no downsides to this place - it's small, it's beautiful, it's well appointed and the food is great. If you're in Barcelona I seriously cannot imagine another hotel competing on any front.",5,2013,06,28
45,Great experience!,"We stayed at ABaC for one night at both the first and  last leg of our trip to Southern France. ABaC sits on a very pretty street of beautiful homes and business establishments. Although the street is busy, our room was remarkably quiet. The subway was conveniently across the street. Our room was minimally but beautifully appointed, in keeping with the feeling of the spa services offered on the hotel's lower level. Quality mattress, pillows, and linens made for a good night's sleep. The bathroom was sleek and ultra-modern, with marble, and one-way mirrored doors separating the toilet and shower areas from the rest of the bathroom. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. We'll happily stay here again if a return visit to Barcelona is in the cards for us.",5,2013,06,27
45,What a fantastic little hotel,"The ABaC Hotel was fantastic.  It is right in the city, but in a fairly quiet area, and it is secluded behind a nice fence.  Once you get inside the gate, you are in a beautiful, quiet little world full of greenery outside.  The greeting when you check in is very nice, and then you are taken to your room.  Wow.  Great room with plenty of space, places to sit, a walk-in closet for your clothes and luggage, and everything is very modern, European style.  We asked for help in finding a small, simple local place for dinner and Christina was super-helpful in making some suggestions, then making a reservation for us, and giving us directions.  The included breakfast was extremely good, and was plenty to eat.  All of the help was excellent.  What an idyllic little spot!",5,2013,06,27
45,Elegant,"At first, I was disoriented by the gate for the hotel at the base of Avenida Tibidabo. When buzzed in, I entered a garden and a contemporary hotel. The service was outstanding. The room was one of the most tastefully designed hotel rooms I ever stayed in. You can take cabs to get around the city, but I suggest learning the Barcelona Metro system. The entrance is across the street from the hotel. This is a wonderful part of the city with many restaurants and stores. It is a great getaway from the bustle of La Rambla. This was a business trip - next time I'll go with my wife.",5,2013,06,19
45,A perfect getaway... Brilliant hotel,"My wife and I rarely have any holidays, due to the hectic lives we have. We therefore only have one or two moments to briefly escape and disconnect from the family and business life. 

After researching hotels in Barcelona, I came across the ABAC Hotel and I loved the concept. I booked the Penthouse suite and, although we had a little administrative scare upon check-in (where we almost were moved to another smaller room) we utterly enjoyed our 3-day stay. 

The room is not the best feature of the Penthouse: the terrace is! A beautiful and private modern terrace with views to a public park and a great open air jacuzzi. The hotel staff is marvelous and attentive: breakfasts at our terrace became glorious and relaxing moments for us to unwind. For those techies, the AV of the room is marvelous, with a huge Bang & Olufsen system. 

The two-Michelin star restaurant deserves a separate review: it was a true jewel of gastronomy. Chef Jordi Cruz marveled us with unique dishes. 

Bravo to the ABAC Hotel, you deserve a standing ovation! We will make sure to recommend this venue to all of our friends travelling to Barcelona and we will see you again in the near future.",5,2013,06,10
45,Sophisticated retreat with designed ambiente,"Although away from Barcelonas busy center area this elegantly designed retreat gives you the perfect starting point to discover barcelona as taxi and bus station and metro are located around the corner. We enjoyed very much our personal terrace with stunning views at the Hotel and Hotel garden. Our room had elegantly designed furniture and bath, sometimes though not made for every-day use (dull light in shower and toilet).  The staff was friendly and open, the breakfeast is expensive but worth it -  although we preferred to enyou all sorts of pastry and a cortado in the bakeries in the center. We did not use pool nor the gym and did also not try the restaurant because it was fully booked. All in all, the ABaC is a sophisticated place to stay for couples who like to relax in a luxurious ambiente after a inspiring day in barcelona !",4,2013,06,09
45,Awesome,"Located away from the obvious spots in Barcelona, but with the convenience of public transport, taxi at the door and lots of small shops and markets around. This boutique hotel makes you feel like home with nice garden around and extremely courteous staff helping you all the time. The breakfast is expensive but worths try. The room is very contemporaneous decorated and surrounded with noise proof windows so you can stay longer pleasant time.",5,2013,06,05
45,Fantastic trip,"The staff were fantastic, the rooms were great and the pools were fantastic, Im a bit of a morning person and i love to get up and use the gym then go for a swim and quite often this can be a problem but not here, I had free reign to do exactly as a please at 6am which was great i could not recommend this more",5,2013,06,03
45,Book this 5 Star for a taste of Luxury,"From the moment of our arrival, we knew this was something very special. We were greeted with a warm welcome and immediately given a tour of this splendid hotel. We were made to feel very much at home, made all the more so by walking through the open kitchen to get to our lift - this might at first seem unusual, however seeing how wonderfully the team worked and to be greeted every day, it is a lovely touch.

When we got to our suite we were speechless, the rain shower, Jacuzzi, kingsize bed (which had one of the most comfortable mattresses I have ever slept in - really), Nespresso coffee machine ... I could go on.  All wonderful.  

To top things off, we ate in the ABaC 2-star Michelin restaurant - we have experienced fine dining in the past, but boy, this knocks the spots off anything we've eaten before.  A culinary delight, with wonderful friendly staff who are so attentive.  Each course left us thinking ""you can't do better than this"" and, every time, the chefs managed to deliver on quality, excellence and mouth-watering flavors. 

Am currently sat on the sunny terrace with an aroma-filled coffee writing this review.  There's so much more I could add - the location is perfect, the hotel is within a stones throw of the tube and I'd highly recommend jumping on the tourist bus for the day, which you can book at reception and hop on just outside the hotel entrance. 

We also treated ourselves to a spa treatment - a 90 minute massage was a lovely stress buster to end our 4 night stay. Oh, and not forgetting to strongly recommend you try a Cava with a hibiscus flower, a first for me and won't be my last! 

All in all - I can't rate ABaC highly enough. If you're in Barcelona, this is the place to stay.",5,2013,06,02
45,2 Star resturant 5 star service.,"We travelled to Barcelona for a special occasion and werwe delighted with the service we recieved from this hotel. 

The meal was exceptional and facilities throughout this small and friendly hotel were very enjoyable.

For gin and tonic lovers they have 32 types of gin in the bar.

The open kitchen was a great touch and we enjoyed seeing service in full swing!",5,2013,05,14
45,Very nice hotel but a little pricey..,"We stayed in the ABAC for a long weekend. The hotel itself is fabulous, situated in one of Barcelona's most affluent neighbourhoods and removed from the madness of downtown Barcelona. The building is beautiful as are the rooms, service is world class, the staff are very friendly and helpful.The only gripe we had was with the charges for the minibar and the restaurant. While I have no problem paying a premium for a nice hotel, somewhere in the region of 6euros for a snail bottle of water is a bit much. Dinner for 2 in the restaurant came to 417 euro (although this did include a 100 euro bottle of wine). If it was in Paris I might be more forgiving but Barcelona is by no means an expensive city and having to check the price of things took the enjoyment away a little from what was an otherwise great hotel.",4,2013,04,19
45,"AbaC Barcelona , Excellent Service, Fantastic Food , Very Personalised!","Great Location!!! Excellent Food and Service (Personalised). Well worth the visit. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, room overlooking garden (peaceful). Easy to hop on Bus Turistic (Tour) stops at hotel door! hotel would be amazing if it had outdoor pool (pool is indoors). Staff go out of their way to please you. Well worth the visit.",4,2013,04,08
45,Exclusive stay in Barcelona,"We stayed one night at ABaC and decided also to have dinner there in the evening. Both decisions turned out to be perfect for our short stay in Barcelona. The hotel is amazing and likely one of the best ones we ever stayed at. The personal are friendly, helpful and great. As we arrived by car, the fact that we could park in the underground garage and then walk straight up to the reception, was a nice feature too :-) We both like good food, and the standard at ABaC are really high, including the breakfast.
It is definitely a place we will return to.",5,2013,04,04
45,Friendly comfort and style with amazing food,"We stayed in one of the suites for 4 nights.  It gave us somewhere to lounge about at the end of a long day in the city itself. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom,with huge shower and jacuzzi bath, was a pleasure to use.  Great soundproofing from the traffic noise.  
The staff were extremely helpful , booking tickets ahead to avoid queues, recommending other places to eat, pointing us in the right direction.
The tasting menu in the restaurant was a true experience.  Very innovative and we enjoyed sampling the Spanish produce.  The sommelier was very good and introduced us to a rather different form of pudding wine!
An extra touch is the spa  - a good massage was a must after tramping the streets.
ABaC is not bang in the centre but the underground is easy to use, taxis are plentiful and we did walk back from the centre in about 45 minutes.  
Overall a high quality oasis with fabulous staff and amazing food.",5,2013,03,30
45,"Amazing comfort, great food, superb location","I stayed at the ABaC for 5 nights in January 2013, and loved it there. The hotel is amazing--it is small and so guests are well-looked after, and the rooms are so comfortable. The beds are like lying in a nest of feathers, and the black-out curtains ensured I woke up when I wanted to. The shower and bath are great too-- the shower is a rain drop shower, and the bath has chromatherapy (it changes colors of lights). 

Breakfast is a real treat-- I made sure to leave a couple hours to try every thing on the menu and feel relaxed through the process. 

There is a spa as well. I didn't have any of the treatments, but loved lounging in the jacuzzi and on the heated sun loungers, while drinking herbal tea. 

The hotel is located across the street from a train station, so getting into the city center is very easy and quick. The area itself is quiet and upscale, so you don't feel like you're right in the middle of it, but you're very close to everything you'd want to see while you were visiting Barcelona.",5,2013,03,25
45,Be prepared to have all your senses pampered,The food is just beyond belief. The wine list is amazing and the wine expert is a real expert. The service is flawless. Go and Enjoy a real Gourmet experience. One of my top 3 ever. I reccomend you without any hesitation. All of this with such a young chef,5,2013,03,17
45,Hotel perfection,"A long weekend in Barcelona - best city brand in the world so very high expectations! The AbAC is a mix of old and new beautifully combined. The largest and most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Room with a view of trees, lots of light, perfect decor. Rain shower, bath all good. Wonderfully helpful and friendly staff. Great advice from reception on where to go - even got us two old fogies in to city's trendiest cocktail and tapas bar. AbAC is an oasis of tranquility in this bustling city. It's about 50 metres from the Ave Tibidabo metro station so 10 mins from centre of town. A brilliant place to start from and it come back to. Also has bonus of being right next to the tram stop to go up to Mt Tibidabo for walks and views over the city. Outstanding hotel, brilliant location, great staff. Faultless.",5,2013,03,11
45,In a great neighborhood but overpriced,"We recently stayed here while visiting family in Barcelona. While it is a nice facility, very well kept and in a quiet part of Barcelona, it is overpriced for what you get.
I would have to say the highlight of staying here is the rain shower in the bathroom which is unique to say the least. Staff is very friendly. We did not eat at the restaurant so I cannot know if the meal was worth the prices they post.
All in all there are hotels in downtown Barcelona that we have stayed at that are just as pricey but a better value all around.",4,2013,03,08
45,wonderful stay at ABAC Barcelona,"romantic and cozy location.metro 30 m , great restaurant Jordi Cruz , amazing sommelier and service.You can rent a bike and give a ride around the region or give a run at serra de coliserola.I will come back",5,2013,03,01
45,fantastic restaurant with excellent rooms,"My family and I recently stayed for four nights at the ABaC and would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel and restaurant. The food was superb, having eaten the previous day at the Cellar can Rocca there was little to choose between the two in terms of quality, they were both lasting experiences.

The staff could not have been more helpful (football tackets arranged, advice as to sights to see and avoid!).

The rooms were equipped with all that one would need and were well soundproofed.

We are already looking forward to a return visit.

45,Quite corner in City Break...,"It was very nice, cute, romantic boutique hotel with a great restaurant and outside sitting area. We had an amazing food experience. Room we stayed was 208. Room was clean, bed is very comfy..(it was bad cos we didn't want to wake up:)  Points for feedback are:
* Lights in the room : Goes off or goes too bright altogether...control panels needs to be changed.
* TV :  TV quality was great but we had only 2 English Channels  and both were news.
*Bathroom : Water didn't drain totally..Water kept bursting hot and cold during the shower.",4,2013,01,19
45,perfect city escape for couples,"subway 20 meters, best sleep ever, ever didn't want to leave your hotel bed? roberto's city map stabilo instruction top notch, very charming staff, stylish and super quite rooms, barcelona for ever, properly the best escape ever.",5,2013,01,06
45,Some of the best food in Europe,"We did not stay at ABaC but ate at their signature restaraunt.

Without a doubt; some of the best food Europe has to offer.   Exception in every sense of the word; the tastes are inspired, the delicacy of each dish does not go unnoticed and even with the hefty price tag I would go back again if I ever return to Barcelona.

This is a 'once in a lifetime' dinner.   Make sure you do it once in your lifetime.",5,2013,01,01
45,A Hidden Gem,"This luxurious boutique hotel is easy to overlook because it is located in a quiet residential neighborhood rather than in the center of the city, which turns out to be a big plus. The neighborhood is utterly charming and only a quick taxi or metro ride (taxi stand and metro station both across the street) to all the main attractions. Our king room was very spacious and included a separate seating area easily closed off with pocket doors, double closets and a plush bathroom, although I agree with a previous reviewer, it's way too dimly lit. Everyone on the staff, was attentive, very helpful and extremely professional. Special thanks to hotel manager, Marien, and Roberto.You met our every need, and promptly at that.  We recommend this excellent hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona, whether for a 1st trip or return visit.",5,2012,12,02
45,Excelent but not perfect.,"The idea of an ipad at the room was very good. The arrival was not excelent. Our luggage was not picked up at the entrance and the service level was not as good as other same level hotels.
The restaurant was excellent and deserves the 2 stars.

The Lady at breakfast was a little strange. Trying to be friendly but a little professionalism more should improve overall quality.

The room was very confortable and silent. A enormous giratory Bang & Olufsen tv is opulent but not very user friendly. The remote control is confusing as well as the tv's software.

The toilet zone at the bathroom has extremely low light.

The material used in the bathroom construction or lighting when cooling makes some sound (a little disturbing cliks)

As you can see my comments are small things which are easily solved. Anyway the hotel was excellent.",5,2012,10,03
45,The evening was a culinary gold medal winning marathon of Olympic standards,"We were in the Restaurant in a party of 50 for a pre wedding dinner.
From the moment we arrived the understated service confidence and professionalism of all involved was immediately apparent. We loved the stylish garden and enjoyed a per dinner drink.
The restaurant itself is a joy with well spaced tables allowing plenty of space for audible conversation.
The meal was an absolute delight with culinary surprises, tastes that challenged and lifted the pallet. Course upon course served quietly, efficiently and professionally.
I have no idea of cost. Style confidence and stunning food and service. Highly recommended, the only other restaurant where i have dined that could hold a candle to it is Le Petit Nice in Marseilles. Both well worth visiting.",5,2012,09,28
45,Gastronomical Luxury,"We chose this hotel because of the reputation of it's restaurant. We were not disappointed. The 14 course tasting dinner was phenomenal. The wait staff were so attentive. Ratio of staff to guests is nearly 1:1. Front desk staff knew who we were by name and were very helpful at all times. There was a fire in the hotel 48 hrs before our arrival. The smell of smoke was noticeable in our room, but the hotel provided us with a filter which worked exceptionally well.
Bathroom was a bit of a disappointment. Shower was small with unusual drain which did leak onto the bathroom floor, however the rooms are well appointed and soundproof.",5,2012,09,26
45,"Yes, Yes, Yes...","Excellent hotel, location, staff, spa, and service! Oh, and Jordi Cruz runs the restaurant! We will return to Barcelona and when we do, we will return to the ABaC. Our meal at the restaurant was a memory, indeed. Go there and do that!",5,2012,09,13
45,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 5 days in September, and was extremely impressed; great staff, rooms, and food.

Stayed in a deluxe room, spacious, quiet and modern. Excellent huge bathroom, with great rain shower. Very impressed that manager showed us to our room, and explained all the quirks of the lighting, curtains etc.

Staff overall were exceptional, great attention to detail. On check in, we were given a map, and guided through all the sites of the city and how to get there. Really impressed also by the lady in charge of breakfast. She was very warm, and almost motherly, and i have to say she served the best breakfast/brunch i have had in a long time. The egg speciality is pretty impressive.

Ate in the restaurant one of the nights, and it was spectacular, well worth a detour! Again, great personal service, explanation of the courses and good wine. Chef here worth at least two stars.

Location is ideal if you want a hotel in city centre, but slightly away from crowds of tourists. It's about 10-15 mins by metro/rail to placa de catalunya. Also there are some great eateries near the hotel, and some unusual ones! 

Overall, i couldn't recommend this hotel enough, ideal for short to long breaks, and you should definitely eat at the restaurant once. It is an experience not to be missed",5,2012,09,10
45,Have to aCT,"Well, we had chosen this hotel because we thought we wanted to have a treat before to head back home,with it's michelin fame,it's location,and it's sleek design,it's sounded perfect,but
A.
A Gourmet Treat
With it's 12courses ABaC menu,seem like a joke,it's all served in what we called a spirit house portion,too small of a portion,and not so good of what you've expected as for the level of the restaurant of this fame and categories.
The waiter are not very professional,I mean ,they just slide  the dishes on to your table just like they did when they return the empty dishes back to the kitchen,perhaps it's  a sunday night and they wanted to get it done as soon as possible.
B.
Being born as a restaurant 
They seem to understand also the need of accommodation,but on doing so,it should be automatically  give a priority to the guests who've booked the room there,doesn't matter if they going to spend the evening there or not,but considered the fact that it's some distance from the centre and the michelin fame,it would be enough to underline the fact that 's why we've chosen to stay there.
For us ,it's been a few hours before the table is confirmed,and only in the outside terrace,which perhaps is supposed to be for the waiting listed or un important guested?Of the way the waiter treated us,we guess it is.
aC
I must say the breakfast is very good(my husband got sicked,after the famous 12courses menu,and taking only immodium in the next 2 days,so it's only me for breakfast)and as well as the club sandwich,it's the most delicious I ever had,So,you started to think it could be a mistake or  sadly a mis management ? I mean,the room are  comfortable and functional,as well as the sleek designed,well located,for someone who look for a tranquility, the restaurant  have to aCt differently in order to keep up with the good reviews that they've got and with them good intention and understanding they will reach only to the top!!!",3,2012,08,26
45,"Wonderful foodie experience, luxurious rooms","I stayed here for my 40th birthday and loved every minute of it. Friendly staff, michelin restaurant, wonderful room equiped with the latest high tech, amazing bedding slept like a princess. We had breakfast just across the street (bakery) with lovely bread, cakes, ,,,, sweet and savoury.  Bus stop in front of the door. If you like strolling around during the night time there is little to see ... So we combined this hotel with hotel ohm .... Location ohm hotel but overall comfort and food experience 10/10 for Abac.",5,2012,08,22
45,"Beautiful, Elegant Hotel with Amazing Food","We stayed at the ABaC in August 2012 for two nights.  From the moment we arrived, the staff was enormously helpful and kind.  We arrived from the airport very early in the morning, yet they were still able to check us into our room right away.  Christina at the front desk was a huge help in getting us settled and providing tips on where to travel around the city.  Everyone - across the board - was incredibly friendly.  Overall, it was a lovely experience and we highly recommend staying at the ABaC.  Some details:

The Room
Our hotel room was situated in the ""new"" section of the ABaC building. Not too big and not too small, it was beautifully appointed and outfitted with luxury amenities.  The best way to describe the aesthetic is calming, quiet and comfortably (not cold) modern.  The hotel itself is very peaceful and quiet. I never saw any other guests, but the hotel was fully booked.  If you're looking for something more active, this is not the place for you.  However, if you're looking for a peaceful sanctuary, this is the perfect retreat.  

The Location
While the hotel is not in the traditional center of the city, we found it very easy to navigate to areas like Las Ramblas, Bari Gothic, the Born and the waterfront by using the Barcelona subway, which was located less than two blocks from the hotel. Truthfully, we liked escaping the hectic, touristy areas to retreat back to the hotel.  We didn't see this as a disadvantage, but for those who want action right outside their hotel - ABaC would not be the right choice.

The Restaurant
Amazing.  Really, not much more to say than that.  You will pay handsomely for your 14-course meal, but it will be worth every euro.  We loved our experience - and it was an experience from the moment you sat down to the moment you left.  Attentive, charming service and food that genuinely knocks your socks off. We loved it.

We chose originally chose ABaC for its small size and for the restaurant.  We wanted a unique experience in a small boutique hotel and ABaC delivered that for us.  We had a wonderful time and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2012,08,20
45,Best design & service hotel.,"From the moment you are welcomed to the hotel, the amazing room complimented by the personal service. Look out for Pillar who serves the best breakfast with a genuine smile, just like your mum. The rooms are very well designed for comfort as well and functionality. The front desk are some of the most helpful staff I have met, especially as I lost my I phone and they pulled out all the stops to help me find it",5,2012,08,12
45,Loved it!,"We spent 3 nights here in January- it was perfect from start to finish.
I booked a car transfer with the hotel and a smart uniformed driver was waiting for us at the airport. The check in was very efficient and Marien showed us around the hotel and explained all the gadgets in our suite. 
We were in room 824- fabulous room, it was the best few nights sleep we have ever had!
The restaurant was amazing- relaxed, friendly, great sommelier, food was out of this world. Without doubt the best restaurant we have ever eaten in. And being able to watch the chefs at work in the kitchen was a wonderful experience. 
Breakfast was innovative and different, and a relaxing experience, which is often not the case.
Marien and the team could not do enough for us- they were so friendly and helpful.  
The hotel is just across the road from a metro station, taxi rank and tourist bus stop- very good links to the city centre. 
Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2012,08,07
45,my dream urban hotel,My second time at Abac and again everything was perfect!! If all chic urban hotels could be this outstanding by making me feel like the star in my 'own home'. Their names have been mentioned in other reviews but that is for a reason! Marien and Pilar really really make your stay so incredibly enjoyable. I was upgraded to a gorgeous suite and Pilar took care of my lovely breakfast. This exceptionally designed hotel is in a beautiful green area of Barcelona and not near the main attractions but taxis are always around the corner and the metro (stop across the street from the Abac) takes you to Placa Catalunya in 10 mins flat. On my third visit I plan to eat in their fabulous restaurant. See you soon Marien and Pilar!!,5,2012,07,27
45,Best urban hotel in Spain,"We came back to Abac, after three years, and we found everything perfect. Again we stayed at room 812, which enjoys a beatiful terrace. My wife also enjoyed the spa, which is small but really chic. Special greetings to Pilar, the women in charge of breakfast, who makes you feel like at home. And the rest of the staff is simply fantastic. In my view, Abac is the best urban hotel in Spain.",5,2012,07,24
45,Outstanding service,"Most enjoyable stay, great room and all the staffs in the hotel are very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended to try the restaurant in the hotel - it will be one of the best meals you ever had.",5,2012,07,23
45,A Memorable Luxurious Stay,"My husband and I were looking for a quiet but conveniently located hotel with luxurious amenities to spend our week in Barcelona. ABaC a luxury boutique hotel far exceeded our expectations. The hotel staff were very friendly and looked into all our needs promptly by booking tickets for popular sights, recommending places to visit, dine and chill. Our room overlooked lush greenery which was very soothing to wake up to in the mornings. I just loved the bed and bedding the best. You could just sink into the bed after a long day out and have a very restful and peaceful night. The shower and mood lighting was also amazing and modern. 
And finally I would like to recommend the ABaC Restaurant. You should go for the degustation menu. We were serenaded with the most exotic flavours throughout the evening, and cava and  wines to match. It was indeed a very memorable experience. Thanks to the very professional and friendly staff.",5,2012,07,02
45,"Outstanding, no words","My best experience in an hotel from all the trips i have done, Little but comfortable  spa ( the two times we used it there was all of it for us, prívate spa jajaj, I suppose because there are very few rooms) as far as I remember the spa has vapor sauna, cold water pool, jacuzzi hot water( sort of beds inside the jacuzzi, very nice) and great massages, spa out of charge fOr all guests. U got to try the restaurant, its expensive but it totally worths it, creative and delicious food. It is located in residential zone, u have very near tibidabo and it is like u where living in barcelona and just at the entrance of the hotel u got underground starion and taxi station and u will be in the city center in máximum 10 minutes. Absolutely  recommendable",5,2012,06,28
45,A great new year's eve to remember,"We went there to celebrate New Year's eve and my son's birthday and that was an unforgettable night. The staff was most helpful and courteous, food and drinks were far beyond anything that one could wish, so were the music and the decorations. The hotel is far from the crowded centre and provides an ultimate intimacy and enough space for feeling at home.",5,2012,06,18
45,"Quality, luxury and comfort","This ultra modern hotel is conveniently located near a metro station (just across the street). Located in a neighborhood, away from the main tourist area which was not a big deal for us since we had a car and with the metro being so close. The neighborhood does not have many restaurants, but there is a nice bakery/cafe across the street that makes excellent cappuccinos, bread, croissants, pastries, and ready made sandwiches.  Although the hotel offers breakfast with a nice selection of breakfast items, we preferred the cafe across the street for having coffee, croissants and fresh squeezed OJ every morning. There are also several small markets within a 5 minute walk for picking up fruit, wine, gourmet goodies, etc. I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation for dinner at the hotel restaurant. It's a bit pricey, but well worth the experience.  There is seating available inside or outside on the garden patio. Although the patio garden is a beautiful setting, I would advise sitting inside due to loud traffic noise that somewhat distracted from the whole culinary experience. Also, we did get surprised by a rain shower later in the evening and had to be moved inside to finish our dessert course. Our room was very quiet despite the fact it was facing a busy street.  The accommodations are quite modern with tastefully appointed, generously sized rooms and bathrooms. The bed and down filled pillows were very comfortable and dressed in quality bed linens. The hotel is very private and secure with several gated entrances and a gated underground garage. Most importantly the staff was extremely nice and very helpful.",5,2012,06,16
45,Amazing in every way possible,"Booked 2 rooms, the deluxe and the superior. Superior had a nice size terrace. Upon arrival, we were met by 2 bellmen who took our baggage and escorted us upstairs to check-in. This hotel has only 15 rooms. The staff were personable and worked hard to make sure that we were taken care of. The hotel is housed in the former location of the United States embassy, which is why the location is so secluded. The hotel is not in the center of Barcelona, but Plaça Catalunya and the city center are a 5 minute metro or taxi ride away. Rooms were stylish and neat and the hotel is very contemporary. Breakfast does not have a huge variety, but it does suffice. Everything that comes out of that kitchen is handmade from scratch. Make sure to have dinner at the Restaurant. Having been to Barcelona three times, this hotel has been one the best I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Their website has many pictures and information that helped us choose it. Amazing Amazing Amazing!",5,2012,06,16
45,Worth it if you've got the money,"Let's get two things out of the way. 1. This hotel is not, by any stretch of the imagination, cheap. 2. It is not in the centre of Barcelona. If you can cope with the short tube or taxi journey, and want to support the Spanish economy, it's a great, stylish choice.

The hotel is in a modern, apparently purpose-built building, in 2 distinct blocks, and also houses a Michelin starred restaurant. This review refers to the hotel only and not the restaurant. We had a warm welcome from the staff (who appeared slightly amazed we didn't need help with our luggae; clearly we were under-baggaged by their well-heeled standards, but really, who needs more than a rucksack for a sunny weekend away?). There was a welcome glass of Cava while they explained a little about the city and gave us a map, making recommendations about where we should go when they heard it was our first time in Barcelona. All of their recommendations that we had time to try, e.g. where to get good paella, were worthwhile. One especially good piece of service was that they recommended booking online for La Sagrada Familia (i.e. the Gaudi church) and even booked online for us and printed out the tickets at no cost. We were able to waltz past the enormous queue and go straight in. It would have beenworth going just for the pleasure of walking past the queue!

We were walked up to our room and the lighting system was explained to us (valuable; saved us that game of ""hunt the lightswitch"" which you often end up having to play at bedtime in hotels). The room was spacious, stylish and comfortable, with lovely Hermes toiletries and a funky square sink that was actually functional. The one-way mirrored glass in the toilet door was a bit disconcerting, mind. Although the hotel is in quite a noisy location, by a major roundabout, the glazing and curtains were effective, giving us a quiet, dark room and a very comfortable two night's sleep.

Breakfast was delicious; we got fresh orange juice, a really nice bowl of fruit with basil granita, posh yoghurts, breads & pastries, a Jamon Iberico sandwich and a wonderful slow-poached egg (with a tiny bit of parmesan-y mashed potato; cheffy, but nicer for breakfast than you'd think). It did seem to be one of those hotels where you worry they are fattening you up for medical experimentation - two full-sized chocolate bars each placed on the pillow wasn't quite what I was after as a bed time snack after the 7 course tasting menu (we took 'em home though).

There is a cavernous bar in the basement where they do a good range of cocktails and spirits; there's also a walled garden area for drinks or breakfast, which is a luxury, albeit a traffic-noise-disturbed luxury, in a city hotel.",5,2012,05,30
45,Brilliant little gem,"We visited this beautiful boutique hotel last Sept and I am sorry this review was not written sooner. We arrived around 8.00am and we were upgraded to a larger room than we had booked and our room was ready for us straight away and no need to wait around for checkin so this was greatly appreciated. Staff were friendly and helpful in explaining the features of the hotel. The hotel was quiet and we did not experience any noise with regards to traffic or within the hotel itself. The wow factor for us was the rainshower, bathroom, bang &olfsen and in general everything about the room. Breakfast was amazingly good with handmade breads, sweet pastries and an unusual take on bacon and eggs. No one does hams and bacon better than the Spanish. Location was perfect for us as the tourist bus stop was right out the front and we used this everyday while in Barcelona. Taxis are always available but beware as we were stung with an excessive taxi fare from the port to the hotel. If in doubt about the fare ask for a reciept! We did not use the spa as we were limited to only a few days here. The only big disppointment for us was that coming all the way from Australia we missed out on dining at the main restaurant as this was closed on both our nights there. We would have loved to see that restaurant open 7 nights a week, but we had the meal of our lives at Montiels Restaurant located very close to the Picasso museum. The grounds at the ABAC are beautiful and a serene place to sit and sip a glass of very good Spanish wines after the maddening crowds at La Rambla. Overall we loved our a time at this brilliant little gem and the fantastic staff and for a good price too made our trip to Barcelona memorable.",5,2012,05,27
45,A design hotel with lots of good features,"We spent 2 nighs and were upgrated to a room with a terrace. very nice room very quiet inside but no way to spend time in the lovelly terrace...far too noisy because of cars. The hotel is a bit far from the center but in Barcelona you find taxis anytime everywhere. worst thing was the breakfeast. in a hotel with a 2 michelin restaurant you expect more than some terrible Danish pastries and croissants obviously industrial. the service was extremely helpfull very nice decoration and confortanle bed and a top diner at the restaurant.
 ",4,2012,05,26
45,A gastronomic delight,"Wow. I stayed here with some colleagues for 1 night on a business trip, and we were simply amazed.

The staff were polite, attentive, and personable, the rooms contemporary, comfortable, and well equipped (bang & olufson tv's, rain shower, jacuzzi tub), and the restaurant simply amazing.

I cannot say enough good things about the restaurant.  I am fortunate enough to have eaten in quite a few Michelin starred restaurants over the years, and so have a reasonable sense of what to expect; but the meal here was off the chart, simply the best dining experience I've ever had, anywhere, and that is saying something.

If I was to try and be super critical and find faults, then I'd maybe say that the corridors approaching the bedrooms are not to the standard of the rest of the hotel, the bedroom doors lack privacy locks or ""do not disturbe"" signs, and it could do with a gym.  But these did not take away from this being a fantastic experience for me.",5,2012,05,11
45,Fantastic,"I came here with my partner as part of a special long weekend break with friends. The location is out of the way and therefore secluded & peaceful. Had we been coming just for sightseeing we would have stayed more centrally but this was not the point of the trip.

We were greeted warmly on arrival by a lovely concierge/manager who was a warm & friendly Spanish lady - with a glass of lovely cava. Our room was not massive but very well appointed with a massive balcony overlooking the park. 

From the hotel it is easy to access taxis to all the sights - Parc Guell is nearby.

The breakfast was fantastic and included in our rate ( with American Express) - served by a lovely, kind and genuine lady - Pilar. 

We had the tasting menu for lunch with our group on Saturday lunchime - 14 courses inc appetizers - and 4 hours of very upmarket courses with carefully matched wine in great company - a really unusual and fun experience.

Reception were very helpful in checking us in online for our onward flight - the service throughout was absolutely impeccable.

This was a very unusual experience for me - totally intimate & luxurious - this is an expensive location but it is justified by the whole ambiance",5,2012,05,02
45,Great retreat,"I spent two nights at AbaC during my recent trip to Barcelona after 3 nights at the Mandarin Oriental. Got a good rate from a hotel site, hence decided to give it a try.  Besides, I knew the restaurant is top rate.  Must say that I am glad I did.  The hotel is in a quiet residential area at Av Tibidabo.  So no shops around, but if you want to get away noise of the city, it's a good retreat.  Rooms are comfortable and nicely designed.  The bathroom is really cool:  a jacuzzi tub with mood lighting and separate showers and a one way glass mirror through which one can look into the bedroom (but not the other way).  Service is friendly and personal.  Although she speaks little English, the lady who serves breakfast every morning is so sweet.  Food is superb:  both creative and tasty. I suggest going for the tasting menu.

I probably wouldn't recommend this to someone who's in Barcelona for the first time because of the location.  But if you know Barcelona a fair bit and love food, this is the place.",5,2012,04,09
45,Not worth it,"Just arrived from a 4 night stay. It is a very good hotel, but other 5 star hotels are better. We were the only couple there, on the 2nd day another couple arrived. There is no fitness area, so there's nothing to do except use the spa. The prices of food are ridiculously expensive so I suggest you take a cab and find a good restaurant. It's a very small hotel, away from the city centre. I booked this hotel because all the other 5 star hotels were fully booked. It's nothing compared to El palace hotel, which is in the centre. Once you've experienced El Palace, you cannot enjoy your stay anywhere else. 

The staff was excellent at ABaC, very professional especially the breakfast blonde lady. She's amazingly genuine. Wherever you go you need to take a cab, it's 10 minutes away from the centre. ",3,2012,04,05
45,Celebrating BD =)))),"I agree with the reviews above about the hotel and accommodation and just want to add that its a really nice place I have found near the hotel - its a night disco called as Atlantic Disco.
I made surprise for my couple to celebrate her Birthday with our friends))) She was extremely happy and liked the evening there! Everything was amazing! We do love it!",5,2012,03,29
45,The perfect relaxing weekend retreat in Barcelona,"My wife and I had the pleasure of being looked after by the team at ABaC in March 2012. Everything about our stay was absolutely perfect, from the warmest of welcomes, through pampering spa treatments to the exquisite food.
ABac really is an oasis of calm and relaxation to which we found ourselves retreating several times a day from the hustle and bustle of the city. 
Oh, and Marien ... you are an angel!
The Norwegians.",5,2012,03,18
45,The best you can do in Europe trousers on!,"ABaC is a really good hotel, if you like ambient, relaxing atmosphere and good food since it is also two Michelin stars restaurant. It must be the best hotel in Barcelona, and one of the best in Europe.

ABaC is actually a villa located in Avenguida Tibidabo where the most prestigious houses in Barcelona are. This is far from where tourists typically flock. On the other hand hop-on & hop-off bus stops just in front of the hotel, if you want to join. Tibidabo mountain and church visible for all Barcelona is tram and funicular trip away. You can get to Plaza Catalonia by metro, which station is 50 meters from hotel.

Rooms are big, well-equipped (Bang&Olufssen LCD-screen and DVD, remote controlled curtains, remote controlled lights, both jacuzzi and shower in bathroom, etc.) and stylish. Since there are not so many rooms, it's very quiet. Public spaces are extremely comfortable, and service is the absolute best you can get in Europe. I consider it extreme good value for money.

If you are looking for romantic weekend in relaxing atmosphere, take a room and book a table in the restaurant. This is the best thing you can do in Europe trousers on!",5,2012,03,18
45,Wonderfully accurate reviews!,"I rely heavily on the opinions of trip advisor to plan my stays. When I saw all of the positive feedback on this small boutique hotel I knew I had to try it. The reviews were accurate, to say the least. 

The small hotel (15 rooms) is wonderfully appointed, in a really lovely neighborhood, steps away from public transportation but a really nice walk to many places. The staff members focus on the guests, showing the details of the hotel and making sure your needs are met - even before you arrive. They know who you are (including the bar tender whom I had never seen before!) and they take pride in making sure you want for nothing.

I was there on a Monday so I knew I would not be able to try the restaurant, but I plan to return with my husband and we will make a reservation. 

I travel a lot, and stay in many hotels. When I returned, I told my husband that ABaC was one of the nicest hotel experiences I have had. It was a combination of the really lovely hotel, the service, the amenities....  I really liked the rain shower, although it is a little challenging (in the room type I as in) to open the shower, turn on the water to get warm and not get the water all of the floor. Not an issue for me, but I thought I would point that out.

Barcelona is one of my favorite cities and I love to visit. I am so glad that I have found the right hotel, and will go back again. 

This hotel deserves each of the 5 stars.",5,2012,03,18
45,Wonderful setting and very relaxing.,"As a frequent visitor to Barcelona on business and pleasure I try to stay at different hotels and Abac is one of the best. During my recent stay I was very impressed with the service, the rooms were outstanding and the restaurant was excellent. They have an extensive wine list and the setting is very relaxing. Despite the fact that it is not in the heart of Barcelona, it was not a problem as there is a subway stop across the street and cabs go by frequently. Highly recommend Abac for business or pleasure.",5,2012,03,13
45,I like this place,"For those of you who already know Barcelona, or/and don't need/ want to be right in the centre, this is a first class choice.

It's a 10 minute taxi ride down to the centre, say 15 minutes to Barceloneletta.

Well run and comfortable, apart from some late night room service problems, we had no complaints at all.",4,2012,03,02
45,Interesting design hotel at the top of Barcelona,"We loved being at the top of the city, right at a subway stop, at this beautiful hotel.  We had the Penthouse Suite and a regular room for our kids.  The Penthouse was very beautiful and perfectly appointed with expansive bath, outdoor jacuzzi and hughe terrace with multiple sitting areas.

We stay in many fine hotels, but the price of food here took your breath away.  Perhaps better for couples as oppose to a family with two teenage boys.

That being said, the food was amazing, the staff friendly and helpful and the location great.",4,2012,02,24
45,"Wonderful, private ABaC; perfect weekend away","From being buzzed in to our departure we were treated to exemplary service in stunningly contemporary and private surroundings.  The staff took time to explain everything and even gave us a detailed itinerary of the best places to visit and the best times to go.  There are only 15 rooms in this boutique style hotel, so personal service is second nature to everyone involved.  You are assured of your privacy as the lifts work by your key and access to the bedroom levels are denied to anyone not having a key.  Our room (we had a suite) had two Bang & Olufsen tvs, an iPad, a jacuzzi bath and rainfall shower.  Rooms were spotlessly clean and the turndown service offered wonderful bars of chocolate each night. All the rooms are totally soundproof and provided an excellent night's sleep. The 2* Michelin restaurant was out of this world (I will write a separate review) but accommodates guests and locals choose to visit as well.

The tiny, intimate spa provided me with a wonderful Elemis massage and facial, and prices consistent with a top hotel.  Highly recommended.

The hotel is situated at the end of Line 7, and the metro is clean, fast (11 minutes to the centre of Barcelona) and ran to time throughout our stay.  Buy a T10 ticket and share it between the two of you; this is perfect for a weekend and works out cheaper than individual tickets. Taxis are prolific just outside the metro station, which is a one minute walk from the hotel.

This is not a cheap hotel (member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World) but it is worth every penny.  It certainly suited us as a quieter romantic base, yet within touching distance of the bright lights of Barcelona.",5,2012,01,23
45,"Wonderful out of the way romantic getaway, but IN Barcelona!","We stayed at the ABaC Hotel from shortly after Christmas through the early New Year (Jan 4, 2012), and found the staff sincerely happy about where they work, extremely hardworking, and all willing go out of their way to please their guests (and indeed made our stay as comfortable and restful as possible).  From their AWESOME manager, Marien Inigo-Schneider (she is ALL about aiming to please, will not put up with incompetence and, I suspect, never sleeps!), to their front desk staff (Christina and other very capable and helpful colleagues), to the young, 2-Michelin Star chef, Jordi Cruz (a guest hallway runs right through the ABaC kitchen where you can witness this amazing restaurant in action and say hello to Jordi himself!), THIS is the hotel to stay in Barcelona.  

While this place is a short cab ride away from downtown Barcelona, take the Metro -- it is cheap, clean, safe, quick and enjoyable.  Both the taxi stand and station are right across the street from the hotel.  As for noise, there is none: ALL the windows are soundproof at the hotel, and you don't hear a sound from a minimal amount of traffic that runs by the hotel (the hotel itself is located in a nice, residential area of Barcelona).

While there were some issues with the hotel being a bit too modern for its own sake (limited individual light controls, slightly complicated TV system, and some suite layouts have the bedroom before the living room area such that room service becomes somewhat awkward if you want to stay in the ""privacy"" of your own bed), this hotel is excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking to stay in Barcelona.  LOTS of hidden and well placed closet and drawer space so as not to leave you stressing over having a room with luggage laying around.  NOTE:  you must ask for ""hand towels"" if you want washcloths (it's a language issue, I think), and for a full pot of coffee (not hot water to dilute the strong coffee provided) if you are a big coffee drinker.  

In short, they were GREAT at meeting our many requests and attempting to understand ""American"" oddities (such as the large pots of strong coffee). 

We will definitely go there again!!!  :-)",5,2012,01,14
45,A perfect stay at Abac !,"Just had a perfect 2 night stay,smiling and efficient staff  during all our stay, penthouse was fabulous with huge terrace with a lot of outside furniture and outside shower , room was full of light, with a view from everywhere, including the  shower,+ enjoying sunrise from the bed at the touch of a button commanding the curtains, very clever design in bathroom + dressing.
A minor problem was efficiently solved by the Guest Manager Marien, breakfast was good (not exceptional ) but the lady in charge of the breakfast took excellent care of us .
We had Room service once and both (simple) dishes were perfect.
The Spa is very relaxing and the massage was simply the best ever (by Lucie or Lucy ?) , and I had Banyan, Aman and Como before. 
When you ge back to the Hotel you can either pass through reception , or via another entrance directly to the room, you fell like if you are living in Barcelona.
I didn't like the rainshower in the bathroom, I think it is nice as an addition to a ""real "" shower , but it can't replace the feeling of a "" power shower "".
  Can't wait to go back to Abac Barcelona !",5,2012,01,10
45,Restaurant visit and Service of staff,"Unfortunately my family and I could not stay at the property due to needing to cater for our 15 month old son, however we had lunch in the restaurant.
There was an initial error made by the hotel for the booking, but it was later corrected in a manner that exceptional.
Once given the opportunity to correct their mistake, I can only say that the service and standards that this hotel displays is literally second to none. The elegance of the staff and overall property is a benchmark that other hotels should look to.
The restaurant has recently earned 2 stars from Michelin. This is without a doubt the best food experience my wife and I have ever had. We dined exactly 3 weeks after eating in Daniel, a 3 star restaurant in New York. There was no comparison. Whilst Daniel was amazing, the service, imagination of the chef and everything that the restaurant surparsed Daniel.
The flavours and imagination of the dishes are extrodonary. The food was art in every sense of the word. The chef...a genius. He will soon be recognised as one of the worlds best - I am certain of it.
There are other words I am sure to describe this restaurant, but still a few days after visiting, I am lost for them.
Make one of your afternoons or evenings a visit to this restaurant - treat it as an attraction and experience that you can rarely get in other places around the world.",5,2012,01,07
45,Gorgeous Boutique Hotel with Excellent Service,"A super modern hotel with luxurious touches such as Bang and Olufsen electronics, Hermes products, and there even is a cartridge coffee maker in the room. Since the hotel premise was locked, we actually had difficulty checking in at 1300. This was due to a malfunction of the doorbell at both entrances. The staff were super apologetic about the incident and from there our stay was good. We stayed in the Superior Room with our own large private balcony. The balcony square footage might have been bigger than the room itself. The bathroom had a separate bath with rain shower. And when I say rain shower I mean a 2 ft x 2 ft gush of water coming down from the ceiling! We did have some difficulty figuring out how to adjust the temperature, but once that was resolved it was heaven.

We ate at the newly upgraded 2 Michelin star restaurant and it was absolutely divine. I have eaten at many Michelin rated restaurants, including the 3 star Per Se in New York and the ABAC restaurant might have been out best dining experience ever. In addition to the whimsical delicious food, the restaurant was able to fully accommodate my girlfriend's dietary restrictions.

We only had one minor gripe that ironically has to do with the heavy sound-proofing of the hotel. The heavy and numerous doors that it takes to get to your room really isolate the sound well, however, they slam and make a loud noise after each one is opened. This means that when another guest leaves their room, especially with at an adjacent floor, we hear every door slam on their way out. I don't know how much the hotel can do to fix this but again it's just a minor detail.

All in all we had a wonderful stay and we will definitely be back to the ABAC for both the stay, the warm, friendly, excellent staff, and the food.",5,2012,01,07
45,Excellent hotel. Awesome staff.,"I stayed at ABACat the end of September for 6 days and although this review is a little late I think it is worth mentioning how wondering the experience of staying there was. I left thinking that, service is excellent, hotel is unique, small but comfortable, luxurious, quiet and location, convenient and peaceful. Truly a modern boutique hotel with an excellent restaurant and awesome and attentive staff.

SERVICE

I have to praise Marien and her team. She made us feel so welcomed from the moment we stepped foot into ABAC. We really appreciate the awesome restuarant recommendations that was provided as the suggested places for local food were excellent choices. Also, they will highlight all the `must visit' places for which I found 6 days was not enough. For information, you can approach anyone of their staff and rest assured, they will try their best to accede to your request.

Turn down service is always prompt and housekeeping is had been consistent throughout the 6 days spent. Hermes amenities are used and for added touch of detail, his and hers amenity boxes are provided.

ROOMS

The deluxe room we had was spacious. Had separate walk in closets and bath areas. Lighting is automated so if there is movement in the room, you will have lights on. Best part of it, there are four types of lighting to choose from. The rain bath is awesome (so huge, you could call is a rain thunderstorm bath). The glass used for toilet walls are all one way mirrors. They also have choices of DVDs if you cannot find anything exciting to do in Barcelona (which is highly unlikely).

LOCATION

As other reviewers have mentioned, the location is 7 train stations away (approximately 7 to 10 minutes) and the train station is just outside the hotel. There is also the Tourist Buses that take you around different routes right outside the hotel's main entrance. On Sundays (or was in Saturdays - check with the hotel) the funicular train up to one of the peaks overlooking Barcelona runs and this is also located just outside the hotel. 

The neighbourhood the hotel is nice is clean and nice. There are lots of eateries around the hotel that open very early in the morning so you won't starve. If you don't want to stay in the noise around Passag then this is an awesome location. Very convenient, quiet and safe. 

Security at the hotel is tight so you need not worry.

SPA and LOUNGE AREAS

The hotel has a spa and lounge area that is both relaxed and comfortable. Massages are also available. I tried the steam room and pools, which is open 24hours. Wished the steam bath was a little hotter though.

RESTAURANT

Well, they did not earn a michelin star for no reason. They also have an impressive wine list. Do give it a try.

Do consider ABAC as you will not be dissapointed. Barcelona as a whole truly amazing!",5,2011,11,28
45,Incredible hotel and a fabulos restaurant !,Wonderful hotel!  The dinner was a very special experience ! Congratulations for everything.,5,2011,11,08
45,Absolutely outstanding,"We chose this hotel because of it's membership of the Small Luxury Hotels group.  The hotel has modern decor, friendly and efficient staff, a cool lounge and a small and excellent Michelin-starred restaurant. 

The breakfasts are fantastic, served by a wonderful lady - Pila(?) of Pamplona is one of those true gems that you can strike in a small hotel - and we unreservedly recommend the lightly poached egg on a base of cheese, bread crumb and potato gratin.  Coffee was served without request and always as preferred - another sign of a great hotel and staff.

The ABaC is not perfect - not enough towels in the room, the lounge / bar was a bit disorganized, the spa is just average and the room shower and toilet are a bit too trendy / gloomy.  That said, this is one of the best small hotel experiences we have had.

ABaC is located slightly out of town, although don't let this put you off - the tourist bus and Metro leave from right outside the gated walls of the hotel.  Despite the busy roads surrounding the hotel, the rooms are brillliantly quiet due to good double glazing and the ultra modern appliances (B&O tv and Nespresso machine) really suit the decor.  The rain-shower is a nice touch in the bathroom.  

Dinner in the hotel was excellent - not cheap of course, although not ridiculous - a must do experience.  We left the wine selections to the sommelier and he produced some great and unusual wines by the glass.

Overall the ABaC is well worth experiencing.  Don't choose if it you prefer cheap, large and impersonal hotels - this is one for those seeking luxury, personal attention, great food and wine - and realistic enough to know that perfection does not come along very often.",5,2011,11,08
45,Not a five and not memorable,"ABAC hotel has a very nice property and restaurant going for it, but as it happens so many times with hotels these days, it fails to give a 5 stars experiences or a true boutique experience. 

To start with the more positive side of ABAC, i can tell you that it is a pretty property, and it really feels exclusive due to it having only 15 rooms and a very posh restaurant. We had 2 rooms and they were both beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast was very very good. It is served every morning by the same non English speaker lady, but she is so nice and attentive it doesnt really matter.

We had dinner at the restaurant one evening to celebrate my birthday and the tasting meal was excellent and very creative and the service was also excellent, as it should be for a EUR150 per person meal, not including alcohol.

For the less positive side, The showers in both our rooms had a far from good water pressure and they have a design error that makes the water leak from the shower inside the bathroom. 

They don't have a policy of a bell boy in the entrance.  When you arrive - no one is there to welcome you and to help with your bags / shopping bags.

The location is not central at all and you need a 10 min taxi drive to go to or back to the hotel.

But to top it all, were these two service related incidents that really showed me the true colors of this hotel and  its dissapointing service. The hotel did not acknoledge that it was my birthday in any way  and did nothing at all to make this special day memorable for me. Our party had two rooms booked for 3 nights each, we spent over a EUR1000 at the restaurant and nothing at all. 

And when i checked in i asked the lady to charge a different card then the one i made the reservation with. She took the new card number and assured me it was done. Of course at check out i found out that this was not done and that the wrong card was charged. This took way too much time - and attitude - to correct.  The dealing with Marien the hotel manager was not pleasant, and she didn't take responsibility for  their error.

So this is not a true class act.  Next time i'll try the new and amazingly-looking Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.",4,2011,11,03
45,"Great, quiet",Wonderful small hotel off the beaten track.  A Greta refuge from the masses and mobs in central Barcelona. We just returned and loved it.  The dinner was magical! The hosts were wonderful. It's refreshing to order ice and have it delivered in minutes. Free wi-fi also.  About a 10 minute ride to central Barcelona.  I would go back.,5,2011,10,06
45,Great place wonderfull view,"This is a very nice hotel, the kitchen is open so you can walk through it,
we didn't eat there as the res is closed sun mon
the location is a 10m drive from major atractions.
reception was very helpfull and pointed great places to eat as
bar mut .",4,2011,09,22
45,First class stylish hotel,"Took my wife here for her birthday and we stayed in the fantastic penthouse suite which came complete with it's own private terrace overlooking the mountains and outdoor jacuzzi.
Staff are excellent and we were welcomed in from the heat of Barcelona with a glass of Cava whilst we checked in. We were given a full and detailed tour of the hotel and it's facilities as well as getting help booking tickets for the sagrada familia and printing our boarding passes.
We ate in the restaurant on the first night which is a great experience and the service was faultless. 
One good tip is to sign up to the small luxury hotels of the world club (this is free) and then book the hotel room through there as you get free breakfast every morning with the membership. Ours was brought to our terrace complete with table linen and everything we needed.
Taxis are surprisingly reasonable in Barca and the trip to the airport is €25 (although beware the hotel's transfer service is around €80 as it's limousine service).
Rooms have iPads and B&O TVs but it would be nice if they could include an iPod dock or AppleTV to allow music and films to be played through the system.
Mini-bar is predictably expensive and as has been commented previously, the room service menu is abysmal for a hotel of this standard. We used it once - had two chicken burgers which arrived with no bun and were of the quality you would expect from a Lidl freezer cabinet. Still, none of this is enough to detract from what is a fantastic hotel.
Park Guell is a 20min walk, the old tram stops right outside to go to Mt Tibidabo and the Av Tibidabo metro station is right opposite and takes 15mins into the centre of town (although it only runs every 15mins or so)

45,Perfect for us,"My wife and I stayed 7 nights at the ABaC and loved it. We stayed in the standard room, which felt better than standard. 

The location is away from the hustle and bustle of the central city, but only an 8 minute metro ride way. The trains come every 6-7 minutes or so. There is a tourist bus stop right outside the hotel. The Plaza Kennedy neighborhood is nice to walk around. We found a local pizza/tapas that we couldn't resist going back to multiple times.

The hotel has a very intimate feel. The breakfast is great and served by a lovely lady. The staff were very helpful. Marien in particular was great. They happily arranged tickets to the theatre and La Sagrada Familia - and gave us some great tips along the way.",5,2011,08,19
45,"""Sublime""","Having experienced four nights at the ABaC, being looked after by Marien and her team, we would not consider staying anywhere else on our return to Barcelona. 

The tasting menu exceeded all expectations as did the whole experience of this unique establishment. 

Faultless!",5,2011,08,18
45,"Nice modern hotel, little out of the centre","We stayed in one of the standard rooms, it was gorgeous so id love to see the more expensive rooms. Very modern, had a huge walk in shower and jacuzzi bath in room. We were met with a cocktail and shown around the hotel which is a nice change to being herded in to check in. The spa area was really nice too.
The restaurant was expensive (as expected) and all night of a job (lots of little dishes & matching of wines etc), nice for a treat but wouldnt want to do it every night as it took hours. Food was good.

The hotel is a bit out of the way from the centre but there is a tourist bus stop outside, worth getting the hop on/off tourist bus. There isnt much around there in the way of other restaurants or bars which is what we like, however there is a little cafe type place across the road which sells beer, cocktails, snacks etc

Loved the hotel - My only complaint would be we wanted drinks in the bar area and waited for ages but no one came to serve (it wasnt manned) & wasnt keen on having to keep walking through the kitchen area to get out, although there was nothing wrong with the kitchen, feels a bit strange keep walking through a hectic busy kitchen.",4,2011,08,12
45,Intimate. Luxurious. 1st Class Michelin starred Restaurant.,"Small hotel. North of main city. Easy access via metro 100m away from hotel. Quiet residential area. Interesting building. Stayed 3 nights in a suite at 30% of quoted ""rack rate""... Would not have paid the full price! Very luxurious and comfortable room; air conditioned etc. Quirky design works most of the time. Calming environment. Superb restaurant. Well worth considering but not cheap.!",4,2011,08,10
45,Magnificient small luxury hotel,"We stayed at Abac for a long weekend, and we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a suite room. 
The room was more than fantastic, very modern, very fashionable, all-white, with an understated luxury all around. The best thing, by far, is the bed. Absolutely unforgetteable. 
Breakfast is also very special, with all sorts of different possbilities, all very personalized. Abolutely brilliant.
Couple of not-so-possitive comments: entrance to the rooms is made through the kitchen, not a good idea for a 5star hotel (even if different from any other hotel, but...). The other thing is that the hotel is far away from the city center, which is good for relax but it takes some long trip in a taxi to get into downtown.",5,2011,08,02
45,"Lovely, intimate boutique hotel and fantastic restaurant","Loved:  Stayed for my honeymoon for 2 nights. Service was fantastic, felt very welcomed from the start to the end, the romantic getaway package came with a rose petal drawn bath with a bottle of  cava, Michelin restaurant was fabulous (I took a picture of each dish) and i was pleasantly surprised by the presentation of each dish.  Definitely worth the splurge.   A stone's throw from the train station and yet in a nice quiet spot (good neighbourhood - no safety concerns even when we came back past 11pm), tram to Tibidablo is just the street next the hotel.  Do spend sometime in the spa area for some R&R (steam bath and jacuzzi).  Quality furnishing and bright room when blinds are drawn up.   Luxurious Hermes toiletries (they are not stingy with providing).  Beautiful bath and separate shower area. Definitely recommend 

Dislikes: None.",5,2011,07,29

45,Great 5 star hotel with the 3 star service!,"I was in my anniversary when I spent a night in ABAC. The restaurant was closed (as it was Sunday). So we wanted to go to a romantic restaurant. I asked the concierge to get us a booking in a Michelin star restaurant, they got me in the worst restaurants in Barcelona (thanks to my knowledge of the city's restaurants). so we decided to order room service. The menu was too limited to 10-15 dishes and when i called to order they ran out of food, so I only had 2 choices! 
summary, the rooms are great but the service sucks!",2,2011,06,27
45,"Beautiful, Luxurious Hotel","Our room at the ABaC was spectacular. The design was gorgeous, the bed linens incredible and the shower was fabulous. The room also had a lovely window seat that could be enclosed by curtains and looked out into the garden. The room was incredibly quiet and we looked out on a wall of green (we were concerned when we arrived because the street is quite busy). It was like having our own private apartment in Barcelona. The staff was wonderful and recommended fabulous restaurants and tapas bars. Our only issue was that it is a bit far from the Gothic quarter--we would have liked to be in walking distance.",5,2011,06,22
45,Luxury 5* deluxe retreat in Barcelona,"The ABaC Hotel is an oasis of luxury, calm, hospitality and perfection in one of the prettiest areas of Barcelona. An incredible and beautiful hotel that delivers on every level. We were met by a team of staff that are there to meet every one of your needs and more...nothing is too much trouble for Maria and her staff. We stayed in the penthouse suite with an outdoor hot-tub overlooking Mount Tibidabo. What an absolutely beautiful and romantic setting. We had this room booked for half our stay and to make it even more perfect, Maria offered us an upgrade to this room as it was simply available for the rest of our visit. You feel simply relaxed and spoilt here. After a day of shopping, sight-seeing, eating and drinking there is a tranquil thermal spa to return to and unwind at no extra cost...you feel a million miles from the hustle of the city. The hotel, rooms and bathrooms are a design success and part of the city's architectural genius.

The Michelin starred restaurant at the ABaC was a master piece and definitely worth a visit if staying here or not. Some of the best food we have experienced and reminiscent of Ramsays Royal Hospital Road in London.

If looking for a luxury hotel... the ABaC is a must!!",5,2011,06,20
45,Absolutely Wonderful!,"We stayed at ABaC for 4 nights in March 2011 and had an amazing experience.  We booked the hotel based upon the fabulous reviews that we read here on TripAdvisor.com and were not disappointed.  We appreciated that the hotel was conveniently located to the metro and bus lines, making sight-seeing very easy!  We also appreciated that the hotel was outside the busy city center and we did not have to contend with the busy city traffic and noise -- yet found restaurants, transporation and markets within easy walking distance.

We booked our Penthouse Suite room through SLH.com and were able to take advantage of a off-peak rate + a 4th night free.  Our accomodation surpassed all of our expectations and the staff of the ABaC was absolutely excellent!!!!  We thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay -- from the comfortable king size bed, to the lovely roof-top deck and jaccuzi, as well as the sun-deck chairs, outdoor table/chairs, waterfall shower and spa tub.  We also enjoyed a room service meal -- delivered promptly to our room for our enjoyment on the roof-top deck/patio by moonlight.  Our only regret, was that we had not allowed more days to stay at the ABaC and enjoy the spa + roof-top breakfast.  The staff made wonderful recommendations for dinner, like Dos Palillos, and were able to book events, such as a Spanish Guitar concert, with ease.  We also enjoyed dinner in the ABaC restaurant on our final night of our stay -- which exceeded all of our expectations and was a wonderful gastronomic experience ... service, food and wine were all absolutely fabulous!!  Thank you ABaC for making our stay in Barcelona one that we will never forget.  We hope to return in the very near future!!",5,2011,06,16
45,Beautiful little boutique hotel with an amazing restaurant,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in May. What an amazing experience! Quirky layout in two buildings which makes sense when explained it used to be the US embassy and ambassadors residence and that they are linked through the basement. Room very high tech. and functional. The very best pillows that I have ever encountered. But all this is just a bonus, the real reason to visit the Abac is the amazing restaurant. Words cannot describe the experience.",5,2011,06,13
45,Did not want to leave,"My husband and I stayed here for one night and had dinner at the restaurant. We could not fault one thing during our stay.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and make you feel like the hotel's your own home. The rooms are lovely and the bed is just wonderful.  The food was just fantastic (we had the taster menu) and the wine that was recommended to us was also very good. I would most definitely return to ABaC.",5,2011,06,10
45,Will keep coming back!,"My fiance and I love this hotel.  This past February was our second visit to the hotel in two years, and it will definitely not be our last.  The rooms are great - spacious with great contemporary bathrooms - and the beds are glorious!  

The staff is fabulous - friendly and helpful.  

The restaurant on the first floor is terrific.   We have tried it under both of its chefs and have enjoyed it both times.  The location is great, because after your meal you will be so stuffed, you will not want to do anything but take the elevator to your room to revel in your experience.

Best room in the hotel is the attic room.  The room itself is not huge, but the outside deck overlooking the city with a table for intimate meals and the hot tub for late night lounging is absolutely romantic!  The room is the one pictured in most of their promos and it is even better in person.",5,2011,04,30
45,Fantastic Honeymoon,"We stayed at ABaC the past week.  I can't say enough about how great it is.  The overall feel is very welcoming but intimate.  It's in a residential part of the city, but there are enough cafes around to find a bite to eat and a great cup of coffee!  Also, the metro stop is literally steps away.  The ride to La Rambla is ~7 minutes.  We rode it multiple times per day.   The hotel is a great retreat from the action downtown.  The staff is amazing from the front desk to the cleaning crew - very wonderful people.  We couldn't have found a better place for our honeymoon!",5,2011,04,26
45,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff and amazing food","We stayed at the hotel ABaC for our honeymoon. 4 nights of pure bliss, the rooms were gorgeous, stylishly designed with your extreme comfort in mind. The Hermes products in the bathroom were a lovely bonus.

The hotel felt like a perfect haven, set a little way back from the chaotic touristy center of Barca in Av. Tibidabo which is a refined suburb with wide leafy streets and gorgeous townhouses. 

The restaurant is beyond fantastic, 2 michelin stars are well deserved. Though for me the best thing about the hotel was the wonderful staff who were charming, considerate, never intrusive and supremely helpful. I can't recommend this place enough.",5,2011,04,11
45,We'll be back,"ABaC is by far the best hotel we've ever stayed in, by some margin.  The location is perfect, the quiet leafy suburbs of barcelona.  The staff are lovely, attentive but discrete, nothing was ever a problem.  The food was amazing, one of the best meals we've ever had at the restaurants, and the breakfasts, as well as the incidental meals will b e talked about for many more years.  The rooms are very well designed, refined, simple and elegant, they are not like bog standard hotel rooms; small and boxy, but light, airy and spacious. If you can afford to stay here, then you definitely should.  We imagined it's what life would be like if you're Richard Branson.

The hotel smells lovely, which is a minor point, but something worth mentioning.

By our third day, we'd decided that it wasn't just the best hotel in Barcelona, it's probably the best place in the world.",5,2011,04,10
45,You want to move in!!,"I stayed in this beautiful hotel for 4 x nights. I travel about 50% throughout the year, so I've stayed in lots of hotel. ABAc is one of the best. The service is excellent, the quality, colour of the furniture so warm and welcoming. In most hotels, you know you are passing by, at ABAc, you want to move in, I didn't want to leave this place. The breakfast very tasty, the spa wonderful, and I didn't really see other guests, so it's very intimate and relaxing. Not far at all from the centre, about 7 mins by metro who is just across the hotel. I want to say thanks to all the staff that truly made this stay memorable and will definitely be back. 
So do not look further, this is the boutique hotel you want to stay in or Move in!!!!!",5,2011,04,07
45,Simply AMAZING!,"I can not say enough about this particular hotel.  Having been to many 5 star hotels, ABAC may in fact be my one of my highest rated.  The premises is an old embassy converted to a hotel space.  There was no detail skipped in terms of design...very zen and sophisticated.  The service was BAR none!!  We felt royalty through out our stay.  The rooms are well appointed and the layout is perfect.  I felt like we were in our own very little BCN apt.  It is very ergonomic in terms the use of the space.  The location is also very convenient as it is right across the street from the train. 

My boyfriend and I were in Barcelona for El Clasico and since I am not a huge fan of massive crowds, I was concerned that we would end up needing a vacation from this vacation.  I was wrong.  The staff and service and accommodations at the ABAC truly made our trip feel luxurious and relaxing as well.

THANK YOU!  Eva at the ABAC was esp amazing! :)  We will be back for sure.",5,2011,04,06
45,Superb Hotel!!,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and wish it could have been more.  There is almost a Zen like calm in the hotel grounds compared to the bustle of the streets outside. 

I have to say the the service we received was the best in any hotel, ever!!
As the spa was unavailable we were 'compensated' with a room upgrade to a deluxe room and given complimentary breakfast which was a nice touch.  Although we did not eat in the hotel restaurant (michelin star**) it looked excellent.

The hotel is located very near a metro and there is a direct line to the city centre. A taxi takes about 10min but beware the driving standards are very poor and we had a few few near misses + ripped off on fares!!",5,2011,04,02
45,ABaC just gets so many things right its Perfect!,"What to say...some hotels have a signature feature and the rest is just adequate at best; not ABaC. So few architects are able to apply Le Corbusier design while creating an exquisite space for people to enjoy; whoever designed this hotel was an able individual!

The staff were simply excellent and so professional (especially Pilar) while at the same time friendly and engaging; If possible i would contact Marien Inigo-Schneider the Hotel Manager directly especially if you are going to stay for 5 to 7 days. Get a Chauffeur to and from the Airport arranged by the hotel; some Spanish taxi drivers think they are Alonso...

The Room:
Sound proofed...
Aircon that works effortlessly...
Huge comfortable bed...
Electric remote control curtains...
B&O integrated TV, DVD et al; take some DVD's & CD's to make the most of this when you are chilling out...
Wifi in the rooms as well as throughout the hotel take your iPad...
A bathroom / shower room that is just fantastic...
Lots of storage / hanging space...
Sensible amounts of bottled water in the rooms (still and sparkling); no hotels seem to do this i am still mystified why they don't; how can 5* be 5* if you are thirsty?

Breakfast:
So often i miss breakfast because it finishes ""too early"" at ABaC you only had to make it down before 11am i made it once and then never missed it. Everyday we finished off our breakfast / brunch having coffee & water on the terrace / garden outside enjoying the sun.

Lunch / Room Service Menu:
Even the room service food was fantastic but i suppose when you think it though the kitchen is run by a 2* chef.

Dinner 2*:
Make sure you book in for two evenings during your stay the first night you arrive (if you are not too tired) & the second last night of your stay. It is a fabulous dinning experience. I recommend Cava - Torre De L'Homenatge 1999 from the wine list.

You now you are dinning somewhere special when you can walk thru the centre of the kitchen during service and it is spotless!

Spa:
A lovely space but Marien was saying she was not happy with it and further work was being planned.

Barcelona:
What a great city lots to do, for me though the Sagrada Familia stole the show. I actually went to see it twice; you can feel the genius. I also tried to get up the huge telecommunication tower designed by Sir Norman Foster overlooking the city but sadly it is restricted access.

We can't wait to go back i may even have my 40th there...",5,2011,03,28
45,A cozy boutique hotel out of the hustle bustle,"A very nice hotel. Friendly staff, lovely rooms, architecturally interesting, romantic. I liked the location at the north end of the city, near the hiking trails up onto the hillsides above the city, and in a luxury home neighborhood of Barcelona, and yet a quick cab or subway ride into the heart of the city. 

Definitely deserving of the star rating, and very classy. Very small and personal feeling. Modern designs and layout.

I was traveling solo, and found the bar, restaurant, and general activity level to be low in the hotel, so it was hard to meet others. I went to the spa four times and was the only person each time. I never saw others in the bar. So, unlike the other hotel I stayed in during my visit (Villa Emilia), this was better for a private, quiet, romantic visit. Villa Emilia had more action in its restaurant, bar, and rooftop area.

For the price, one might have expected a workout facility attached to the spa (there is none), but there are ten euro workout options not too distant from the hotel. Also, one might have expected a pool. There is an indoor spa, but no actual swimming pool or outdoor pool options.",4,2011,03,14
45,Standards Slipping,"I chose this hotel due to the good reviews, and the fact my wife is a chef, and we noted its Michelin rating.  This was a special treat for Valentines.  A few items are worth noting, especially as the hotel rates can be as much as 1000 Euros per night.  At this level you expect impeccable service, and faultless attention to detail.  In this instance I have to say it was not perfect.  

The room was very nice, and at the special rate of 300 Euros a night was ok value.  The mini bar prices are very high, 4.50 for a coke!  The hotel did a great welcome job, and showed us everything, but neglected to explain the digital option on the TV that gave even more channels on top of the usual fair of 3 English news channels.  A minor niggle that we didn’t discover until the day we checked out!  

The initial disappointments however came from the restaurant service.  This was a 2 star establishment, but recently lost a star due to the change of Chef.  The service however, was not 2 star.  Several times glasses were not replenished with water until we attracted the attention of the waiter, and once the meal was over we were simply ignored, and despite telling one waiter we were ready to leave, we were left to sit.  Eventually we got up to leave and had to walk to the cloakroom to retrieve a jacket, and only at this point did people come running to help us.  

This is not 5 star hotel, or multi starred Michelin levels, as anyone who eats/stays at this level will agree.  Breakfast on the 2nd day went well down hill.  When we arrived at the breakfast room, there were many uncleared tables, and we chose the only clean table in the room.  After a 10 minute wait we were initially approached for our order.  Eggs were overcooked, and the overall service was very poor, due mainly to the fact they had 1 girl waiting 10 tables.  Several guests had to complain and go in search of the waiter to get tables cleared, and to get their orders I for breakfast.  At this point the reception got involved in clearing dirty dishes.  

Perhaps the hotel may be struggling a bit, hence the cheaper rates, and less than perfect service?

When we checked in, we were told we could keep the room for the whole day on the day of checkout.  When we left for the days exploring on our final day, we again discussed this with reception, and all was OK’d.  However, when we returned we found our access to the hotel had been revoked, and our baggage had been removed from the room rather unceremoniously, and we had to resort to sorting it out in the lobby!  At some insistence the staff member on duty called the manager, who incidentally was the lady who had checked us in and made the offer of the room use on the day of checkout.  She was very apologetic, and did indeed make a 200 Euro refund (about 20%), and provided complimentary tea and coffee, and the use of a room to freshen up.  

Finally, during our stay, we had asked several questions which were diligently noted down by reception, but alas they never got back to us.  

So all in all, some disappointments at this level, and ones that should be addressed by the hotel.  Not  reasons to stay away, but maybe a consideration when picking an expensive room, and if you have high expectations at this level of accomodation and dining.  Guy Savroy it is not!",4,2011,03,01
45,"state of the art, the best shower ever seen!","staid for 3 nights hotel only.

I used to stay in 5 stars hotel and by all mean I can say this hotel has the best shower/tub ever seen....you would linger for hours under the shower!

everything was perfect apart breakfast that despite being good was nothing of exceptional compared to the hotel.

definetively a win choice if you look for boutique hotel and like quiteness.",5,2011,02,02
45,Dreaming of Going Back. Absolutely Great Hotel.,"We just returned from a 6 day stay in Barcelona and the Hotel Abac. Previous reviews on Tripadvisor convinced us of our choice, but even then our high expectations were exceeded.
We were greeted by the hotel manager (Marien Inigo Schneider) who, despite our very early arrival (10:30 AM) had our room ready. Very welcome after a long overnight flight. After the checkin Marien gave us a very detailed synopsis of Barcelona which included sights, transportation,museums, shopping and restaurants (earlier she had e-mailed us a list of top restaurants that SHE recommended and then had made reservations for us). All I can say is that Marien is a highly knowledgeable and sophisticated person with impeccable taste. We quickly learned to seek out her advice for anything.
The hotel was modern and beautifully appointed. The rooms were large with abundant drawer and closet space, a large and Extremely Comfortable bed and a huge bathroom. The rooms were cleaned at least twice a day and the chocolate bar on our pillow was a huge plus (excellent),
The hotel restaurant (2 star Michelen) was an excellent choice. The tasting menu was not only delicious but also entertaining (restrained molecular with a leaning towards local foods and respect with Catalan cuisine). The wine list and sommelier were both excellent and the overall service matched he two star rating. However the highlight and most enjoyable moments at Hotel Abac was the breakfast. Abundant (too much actually)  and beautifully prepared and served by the delightful Pilar (who I wanted to kidnap and bring back home with us).  Our only concern was that the hotel was 3 Km. from the center. This turned out to be and advantage as the subway entrance, taxi stand and bus stop were all at the hotel entrance and the center of town less than ten minutes away....even late at night. 
 I, for one, cannot wait to come back to Barcelona and the Hotel Abac. P.S. If you have the opportunity take the train and go to Sant Pol de Mar for lunch at Restaurant Sant Pau. Once in a lifetime experience.",5,2010,10,30
45,ABaC - wonderful restaurant and hotel,"The ABaC Hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Fantastic design, clean and modern with friendly staff. The beds were probably the most comfortable we have ever slept on and the children were delighted to find the room came equipped with iPad and the most enormous TV in the world! Our only slight disappointment was we couldn't find anywhere to dock iPod to listen to music in the room. Spa is lovely. Staff very friendly and helpful.

The ABaC Restaurant is quite fantastic. Other people on the site have said that it is stuffy - it is not stuffy in a pompous way but smart as befits a restaurant at these prices and this type of cooking. We had two teenagers with us who absolutely loved it and did not feel over awed.  Wonderful meal - flavours that defy belief - basil sorbet - theatrical smoke filled domes - de-constructed cappuccino -  friendly sommelier too.",5,2010,10,25
45,"Amazing hotel, very peaceful and extremely relaxing","I visited the Abac hotel for 2 nights and was not disappointed at all. We were greeted by the lovely Maria who made us feel very special. We were upgraded to a deluxe room which was to die for! The beds were so comfortable and the rain shower was truly spectacular. The bedroom felt like no oen else had ever slept there before.
We ate in the hotel on our first night, the food was delicious though a little pricey, however we did get treated very well. This was a fantastic experience and I highly reccommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a peaceful holiday, not in the touristy part like Las Ramblas, and those who want to indulge a little.",5,2010,10,19
45,What hotels should aspire to,"The personal attention by Maria was unsurpassed in my experience anywhere else in the world. She is the perfect example of what makes this hotel great: dedication to customer satsifaction, and dedication to the hotel itself, since she worked three shifts in a row filling in for a key restaurant person in between her regular duties in the hotel. Only a great hotel can get a professional like her to agree to those hours...

The hotel is beautiful, with every amenity including remotely controlled curtains, rainfall shower heads, a private spa, etc.  

Highly recommended.",5,2010,10,18
45,What an incredible find: 5* hotel with 2* Michelin restaurant!,"Just returned from 4 days in the lap of ABaC luxury! This hotel is truly something else. Just 15 rooms and all of them equipped with topnotch facilities and amenities. A very friendly and personal welcome was just a taste of what was yet to come. The hotel is located about 3 km away from the bustling city center but, that is easily overcome by a short taxi ride or a slightly longer ride by hop-on/hop-off bus that stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel's own parking garage means you can leave your car safely while you are off exploring Barcelona. The building itself is wonderful; lots of wood on the outside and very secure. The inside is a marvel of modern design; lots of glass, granite, marble and stainless steel but, it all fits wonderfully and really comes together. Our Deluxe room was spacious and was equipped with a big Bang & Olufsen tv-set (!). Everything you can possibly think of was in the room and it left absolutely nothing to be desired. The bed was very, very comfortable and the bathroom deserves special mentioning: separate toilet with bidet, jacuzzi bath and a shower coming out of a 40x40 cm shower head in the ceiling. Separated by one-way mirrors from the rest of the room, the overall effect was light, roomy and very, very comfortable. Food at the hotel was truly excellent and it is rightly a 2* Michelin restaurant. Both à la carte as well as the Grand ABaC tasting menu are culinary experiences never to be forgotten: the presentation, combination of flavors and subtle, surprising accents are the mark of a exceptional restaurant and the ABaC Restaurant certainly fits that bill. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and the sommelier came up with some amazing wines to accompany our choice of food. Well done! Breakfast was also amazing: sitting outside in the garden (weather permitting, of course) with so many delicious items served to you at the table. It was also very well presented, made to order and certainly in line with the restaurant. For those seeking a small but very luxurious hotel with excellent dining facilities and truly personal service by amazing staff, you need to look no further.",5,2010,10,11
45,This is the place to stay in Barcelona,"We truly felt like guests at ABaC - the personal attention and friendliness of the staff were remarkable.  I highly recommend a room with a patio - they are quite spacious and a great way to relax and hear the city.

The area around ABac is residential and a welcome break from the tourist areas south towards the ocean.  Also, Tibidabo is immediatey accessible - run up the hill, follow the trails, and see Barcelona from an amazing vantage point.

I must mention the absolutely wonderful manager - we arrived very early on a Sunday morning, well in advance of our reservation time, worn out from an overnight train ride.  We were greeted by her as friends (!), offered delicious coffee, a tour of the hotel... and swiftly accommodated.  I'm convinced my lingering fondness for Barcelona was significantly shaped by these gestures - this wasn't mere ""service"" or ""hospitality"" - it was kindness!",5,2010,09,30
45,True 5 Star Experience - Fantastic!,"From check-in to check-out this hotel experience was superb.  They truly get what it means to deliver a 5 star experience.  Upon arrival we were welcomed with a champagne cocktail and cold towel - nice touch!  We were made to feel like a valued guest from the moment we entered.  Every employee we encountered was helpful and pleasant.  

We booked the stay via the Infinite Visa Concierge Program and they were fully versed in the upgrades and benefits.  

Our room was absolutely stunning.  Bed was excellent as was the shower facilities.  Hermes toiletries were a nice touch.  

The breakfast, which was included, was outstanding - a real feast and not to be missed.  The spa facilities - also included - were serene and worth the visit.  

The restaurants kitchen is open concept and you can walk through it which is neat to see.  

I wouldn't change a single thing about this hotel or the experience!  We stayed at another boutique style hotel in Barcelona during our trip and it didn't come close to the ABaC experience.  It would be my first pick when I'm next in Barcelona.",5,2010,09,14
45,Treated like royalty...,"We had previously eaten at the wonderful 2 Michelin Star restaurant and wondered what it would be like to stay at the hotel. Therefore, for my girlfriend's birthday this year, I decided to book 3 nights at the hotel and I managed to reserve the Attic Suite at a not ridiculous price.

The room was sumptious and although not huge, the terrace made up for it with a hot tub, sun loungers, dining table and coffee table & chairs plus, sun all day round.

The service was excellent from the manager to the delightful lady who served us breakfast each morning (she made the table on the terrace each morning as well). They booked restaurants for us at other locations in the city and also arranged the executive cars to pick us up and drop us at the airport.

Breakfast was lovely, the restaurant as usual was superb and the overall ambience of the hotel was relaxed, but you knew that nothing was left to chance. 

I have never stayed at a better hotel and the location is also good, as you are right by a Metro station.

Basically, if you are thinking of treating yourself and want to have a great base to enjoy the delights of Barcelona, try Abac, you won;t be disappointed.",5,2010,07,31
45,absolutely fantastic!,"I had an absolute wonderful stay. The location of the hotel is outside of the busy Barcelona Center, but there is a Metro station right outside the door of the hotel that takes you to the center in less than 10 minutes.  The rooms are large and very comfortable with Hermes toiletries, however the automatic lighting system is a bit confusion. But...what makes this hotel very special is the PERSONAL service from Marianne, Maite and Pilar!!! You feel like staying at a luxurious home. Unfortunately I didn't eat in the restaurant, and since it is fully booked every night, I'm sure I will reserve it well in advance on my next, hopefully soon, stay at ABAC!",5,2010,07,03
45,Perfect luxury refuge for couples,"This is hotel is truly a jewel in between all the other hotels in Barcelona and if I had to choose the best hotel in Europe, ABaC Hotel would definitely be in my Top10. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable and designed for having a quiet sleep- big and tall windows can be covered completely, so that no light disturbs your sleep. The relaxing rainforest shower and Givenchy treats let you indulge even in the bathroom. Spa can be booked per room, which means, that the small pool, sauna/hamam, drinks and snacks are there exclusively for you and your partner. I have never enjoyed a stay more than this one and I am still seeking for a comparable hotel in Europe, that gives you relaxation in the midst of a city's rushed daily routine. Everything can be reached via the near-by metro station, too.",5,2010,03,24
45,Gorgeous hotel well located away from tourist town,"My fiancee and I just returned from two nights at the Abac Hotel (Sunday/Monday). Sadly the restaurant was closed both nights and the bar didn't seem to be open either - bad timing on our part. We could have tried breakfast but at 30 euros a pop we couldn't quite bring ourselves to, especially with a lovely bustly cafe just across the road at a fraction of the price.
And so to the hotel. We booked a deluxe room which on first sight was disappointing size wise but more than made up for in quirky features. Loved the lighting which was easy to negotiate. loved the electric curtains, loved the two way mirrored bathroom doors, and super loved the wet room complete with jacuzzi bath and huge rain shower.
Also the bed was as comfy as either me or my partner could remember, and the doors are so thick we didn't hear a thing from elsewhere. Throw in huge plasma tv but sadly no dvd player in our room so we made do with spanish tv or the one english channel bbc world.
It's a nice relaxed place to hang out, i was brought coffee on the terrace in the morning, and the location is great if you're not bothered about being on the Ramblas. The train is right there or a taxi to the city is around 10 euros. 
Our only disappointment was finding good places to eat. Sunday night so much closes and the friendly staff weren't exactly full of suggestions. Monday night again it was up to us to come up with something. 
Marian in particular we found incredibly helpful, especially when i couldn't get my laptop to connect to the hotels super fast wireless.
I didn't mention the spa: small, lovely, but the jacuzzi and steam room could have been a lot hotter for me.
Overall, sad we missed out on the restaurant but loved it, and so we should at the price.",4,2010,03,03
45,Wonderful hotel and amazing restaurant!,"My wife and I stayed at ABaC for three nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   The location is perfect to explore Barcelona - at the end of a metro line (Tibidabo) with a very frequent service and only 8 minutes from the city centre, yet quiet enough to escape from the bustle of the city, so do not let the fact it is not located in the centre on on the waterfront put you off staying here.  The staff were fantastic and simply couldn't do enough to help us, from making my initial enquiries through to their courteous through to friendly manner in suggesting where we should visit.  The whole atmosphere was warm, freindly, inviting and relaxing - exactly what a good hotel should be.  Our room (junior suite) was not quite as big as I had hoped for, but was stunning in fixtures and fittings, so we were happy!  The hotel layout is a bit quirky, coming from the fact is is set in an old house which has had a wonderful extension added, but the fact you are encouraged to walk through the kitchen says how proud of their food they are and they have every reason to be so!  Unless you have had your taste buds surgically removed you have to eat here if you can - it was sensational and again, the staff went the extra mile when they made a menu just for us on the night due to my wife's dietary requirements; astonishing in a Michelin-starred establishment.  But even breakfast was a treat - fruit salad with basil sorbet just one example of the superb food served here.  Moving on, the bar was an experience in itself and you simply have to ask for one of their gin and tonics - better than any we have had before or since.  The spa was also great - small but lovely.  All in all, we will definitely be going back, as much to visit this hotel as to visit Barcelona, the highest complement I can give in a city with so much to offer.",5,2009,10,13
45,Great Barcelona hotel with a superb restaurant,"This is a superb hotel and restaurant.  All the staff, especially the Manager Marien, were very friendly and helpful.  She quickly realised that food was an important part of our trip and suggested some alternative restaurants to ones we had booked - all were excellent.  Their own restaurant is superb (I am not sure what the reviewer expecting 'more from a 2* Michelin restaurant' was looking for – during our trip to Catalonia we ate in two 3*, two 2” and three 1* Michelin restaurants and ABaC definitely stood up there with the 3s & 2s).  The food (tasting menu), service and wine were all excellent.  We had dinner in the garden, which is a little oasis.  Breakfasts were also great…and al fresco.  ABaC is a little out of the centre but, I think, better for that.  It is on two open-top bus and the blue tram routes, if you want to be a tourist.  It is also close to a Metro stop and the hotel will order taxis for you.  We stayed in a junior suite, which was very comfortable.  Although ABaC is modern, form does not outweigh function.  Even down to the chocolate bars (by Xaviermor, which unfortunately does not appear to be available in the UK) left on our pillows at night!  We would definitely recommend ABaC to anybody staying in Barcelona.",5,2009,06,14
45,Discovering ABAC Hotel,"We spent four nights at the ABAC during the December long weekend and I have to say that it was a very pleasant experience. The hotel is an oasis of peace in the upper area of Barcelona; The rooms are spacious, bright and perfectly equipped; breakfast - of the highest quality - is served in the wonderful library, etc.
But the best of all is the great professionalism and kindness of all the staff, attentive to every detail, with that Barcelona courtesy, which pleases but does not invade.
Anyway, we will return as soon as we can.",5,2023,12,08
45,Fin de semana de lujo,Nos encantó. La habitación era espectacular y la atención del personal exquisita. Nos pareció un privilegio el hecho de tener que atravesar la cocina para acceder a la habitación. En un hotel tan vinculado a la gastronomía es un lujo!!,5,2022,12,15
45,Una estancia agradable,"La semana pasada hicimos un viaje de cuatro días a Barcelona mi marido, mi hijo (bebe de un año) y yo. Viajamos mucho a Barcelona porque toda la familia de mi marido es de ahí y por tanto lo conocemos bien.

No necesitábamos estar en el centro turístico porque no era el plan visitarlo, además de que la zona es perfecta para poder comunicarse y moverse con facilidad por Barcelona. Tenia bastantes expectativas en el hotel.

La ultima vez que me aloje en Barcelona fue en el Mandarín, pero esta vez queria algo mas ""local"" y autentico y había reservado en tres hoteles para esta visita: (1) Hotel Casa Fuster 5* GL, (2) ABaC Hotel y (3) Hotel Casa Sagnier. Finalmente nos decantamos por este ya que nos apetecía mucho ver el concepto y la localización nos atrajo mucho (nuestra familia vive por la zona). Además, dado que viajamos tanto a Barcelona, queríamos encontrar EL hotel al que recurrir siempre.
Tengo que decir que suelo viajar a hoteles muy buenos, y puede que mi criterio sea algo exigente.

Dejo aquí mi valoración a cerca de todo:

HOTEL
El hotel es precioso - la verdad es que el edificio es ideal, está muy bien pensado, muy cómodo, muy bien localizado. La recepción es muy bonita, la terraza es muy agradable, el parking es cómodo, y en sí todo está muy bien. Hay dos edificios, uno más antiguo que otro, aunque el antiguo es el más ""auténtico"". Nosotros nos alojamos en el antiguo, aunque creo que por eso había algún que otro fallo que después redactaré

HABITACIÓN
La verdad es que la habitación que escogimos fue la Deluxe (que es la sencilla). Nosotros casi no estamos en el hotel y la verdad es que no nos merecía la pena haber escogido otra más grande. La habitación en si era muy bonita, muy bien decorada, y el baño muy bonito y cómodo. La cama era perfecta. Super comoda y super limpia. Hemos dormido genial estos dias.
Sin embargo si que había fallos de detalles / fallos que pienso que en un hotel de categoría 5* GL no deberían tener:
1. La alfombra estaba manchada - normalmente no me suelo fijar, pero al ir con un bebe que siempre está por el suelo, no me gustaba ver ciertas manchas en la alfombra que te recuerden que otros huéspedes han estado ahí y han manchado con vete tú a saber qué. Me daba sensación de suciedad.
2. Las pareces estaban muy manchadas también de nuevo son cosas que requieren cuidados, y lógicamente con tanta gente yendo y viniendo las paredes se ensucian, pero tienes que mantenerlas limpias porque da sensación de poco cuidado - y de nuevo es un hotel 5*GL
3. Las puertas de la habitación - el peor sistema que he visto nunca. Puertas super super pesadas, muy complicadas de abrir, excesivo esfuerzo y nada cómodas

SERVICIOS

TODO EL PERSONAL DEL HOTEL FUE SUPER AMABLE CON NOSOTROS EN TODO MOMENTO Y LAS FACILIDADES QUE NOS DIRON FUERON INCREIBLES. No puedo sacar ninguna pega por nada, porque todo estaba fenomenal, simplemente dos fallos:

1. Nosotros no nos quedamos a comer o cenar en el ABaC porque ya habíamos estado anteriormente, sin embargo si que quisimos uno de los días aprovechar y desayunar ahí. El desayuno fueron 27€ por persona, y la verdad es que no mereció nada la pena. Además de muy lento el servicio, la variedad no es mucha. Les pedí unos crepes y como no tenían (ni nutella ni nata tampoco), muy muy amablemente me los hicieron pero tuvieron que buscar la receta... y la verdad es que salieron bastante regular (por no decir malos). Tengo que decir que fueron SUPER amables, pero sorprende que un sitio donde el corazón del negocio es la cocina, no sepan hacer una crepe en condiciones. Repito, agradezco muchísimo la amabilidad, pero me sorprendió mucho. Por lo demás el desayuno estuvo muy muy bueno, y las tortillas y huevos espectaculares.

2. Servicio de habitaciones - hubo una de las noches que no nos hicieron la habitación por la noche, y esto si que es algo que me enfadó bastante porque al ir con un bebe, que la habitación estuviera hecha y perfecta era un gran must. Cuando llegamos no solo no estaba hecha sino que por casualidad pasaba un hombre que nos preguntó si necesitábamos toallas - lo cual también me sorprendió porque nunca había tenido que recoger las toallas en la puerta... Además avisamos de ello pero ni si quiera tuvieron un detalle con nosotros... lo cuál sorprende también, porque cuando pagas 255€ por noche, esperas que todos los servicios se lleven a cabo, y si no los estás cumpliendo al menos tener un detalle con nosotros... porque el servicio de habitaciones es muy importante cuando pagas tanto dinero por una habitación.

LOCALIZACIÓN
Esta en la mejor zona de Barcelona, pero solo la apreciarás si eres local o conoces mucho la ciudad. No está en el centro turístico aunque tiene muy buen acceso a todos lados. Si se viene por la experiencia y la cena y todo, la verdad es que es zoma prime y es perfecto.

PERSONAL
Creo que es de las cosas más importantes a destacar aquí. Porque fueron tremendamente encantadores y amables y siempre queriendo hacer sentir comodo al huesped. A mi personalmente me ayudaron en todo momento, y además fueron encantadores con el bebé, que también salió encantado.

Dicho todo esto, estos son los únicos fallos que encontré al hotel, siendo el ultimo el que más me molesto. Pero por lo demás tengo que hacer una valoración muy buena porque el hotel es muy muy bonito, el ambiente super agradable, el parking muy cómodo, la zona preciosa, el personal ENCANTADOR.

Sin duda, repetiré y puede que se convierta en mi hotel de referencia de Barcelona cuando tenga que ir.",4,2022,10,24
45,Fantástico,"Hemos hecho una escapada mi marido y yo, después de mucho tiempo, esperando encontrar un buen sitio dónde descansar y disfrutar de una nueva experiencia culinaria.  Pocas veces hacemos reseñas de los sitios a los que vamos, pero en esta ocasión no podíamos dejar de hacerlo puesto que tanto la estancia en el hotel como la desgustacion del menú superó nuestras expectativas. Espacio y enclave fantástico, y el menú toda una obra de arte para los cinco sentidos.
Calidad, familiaridad y profesionalidad hacen que todo resulte perfecto.",5,2022,08,21
45,Un aniversario de bodas decepcionante,"Para cenar, salvo que reserves noche y cena por 800€, sin plazas. Optamos por dormir con desayuno. Habitación mal ventilada y olor a rancio y el desayuno es a la carta sin opciones dulces, tan solo bollería industrial. Fruta de mala calidad.",3,2022,07,28
45,Fantástico ,"Fantástica experiencia en Hotel Abac. Excelente trato por parte de todo el equipo haciéndote sentir mimado desde el inicio.

45,Felices 40,"Fuimos a celebrar nuestros 40 regalo de nuestros familiares. La experiència genial desde que entras hasta que sales. La habitación suite està muy bien. baño genial. Solo pondria suelo radiante en la zona wc-bañera para evitar el contraste del frio. La cena una experiencia tanto de comida; bebida y compañia del personal de sala excepcional. La ubicación de la mesa perfecta. Solo nos ha fallado el spa; poco calor; me han faltado chorros de agua y una tumbona de hidromasaje no funcionaba. Recordad coger gorro piscina pq incluyen albornoz y zapatillas pero el gorro se paga.

En conclusión es una experiencia a vivir.",5,2022,04,24
45,Como en casa,"Disfrutamos de un paquete romántico en una suite del hotel ABaC, que resultó en que el día de nuestra partida se nos saltasen las lágrimas por tenernos que ir. 

Llegamos un sábado y antes de registrarnos ya estaba todo preparado. Gran detalle la invitación a una consumición mientras esperábamos en la terraza a que pudieran atendernos en recepción. El hotel es muy coqueto, con una ubicación tranquila alejada del centro. El Spa para nosotros solos al haberlo reservado para la mañana del domingo, perfecto para desconectar del estrés del día a día. El personal atento sin agobios, detallista (nos sorprendió que mientras saliéramos a cenar, entrasen a limpiar el baño después de un romántico baño con espuma y sales incluido en el paquete contratado.

De cara a la salida, no hubo problema alguno en dejar un equipaje repleto de maletas y retornar a media tarde al hotel donde nos esperaba un taxi amplio para desplazarnos al aeropuerto. Volveremos seguro, a disfrutar de un tranquilo fin de semana. El restaurante, del que solo pudimos visitar las cocinas, merece la pena una mejor planificación que permita poder realizar reserva en él, algo imposible improvisando las fechas.",5,2022,03,02

45,Maravillosa estancia ,"He comprado el pack Gourmet que incluía estancia, circuito spa y cena en el restaurante de 3 estrellas michelin ABAC. La atención de este tranquilo y espectacular palacete transformado en Hotel, no ha podido ser mejor. La amabilidad y saber hacer por parte de Irene, en recepción, ha hecho que la estancia sea muy agradable y acogedora. Habitaciones muy confortables y detalles de 5 estrellas. El equipo, excepcional. Consiguen hacen sentir a los huéspedes como en casa. El spa, tiene todo lo necesario para relajarte y hacerte olvidar de la rutina. Y el menú degustación del Chef Cruz, es magistral. No defrauda ni uno solo de los platos (eso sí, hay que venir con hambre o hacer hueco antes...;-)). Qué decir de un Chef que ha preparado, en mi opinión, de los mejores menús de estrellas Michelin, que he probado. Tiene la amabilidad de pasarse por las mesas, saludando de forma totalmente profesional, educada y aunque en la televisión pueda parecer cortante es muy simpático. Desde luego que si se lo cree tiene todos los motivos para hacerlo porque este restaurante no es de 10, sino de Matrícula de Honor. 
Volvería con los ojos cerrados!. ",5,2020,09,20

45,Para repetir,"Inolvidable, trato muy humano. Todo ha sido correcto, muy amables.

El Spa muy limpio y muy tranquilo. El personal del Spa muy profesional.

Llegamos antes de la hora prevista, y como nuestra habitación estaba preparada subimos antes a descansar, antes nos ofrecieron café, cava o agua.

El restaurante mágico, disfrutamos a lo grande, el café nos lo tomamos en la terraza, que también se estaba fenomenal 

Cuando subimos de comer nos habían  arreglado la habitación.

El desayuno excelente.

El coche lo dejamos en el parking y no tuvimos ningún problema en dejarlo unas horas más tarde que la habitación.

En general la experiencia ha sido buena aunque tengo la sensación de que podría haber sido magnifica si cuidarán más pequeños detalles. En 4 días nos han puesto una botella de agua sin cargo, muy escaso. La habitación es muy bonita pero para la categoría del hotel necesita un repaso; desconchados en los muebles, armario desajustado, grifería en mal estado. Una noche al volver a la habitación nos encontramos un palo de escoba en el suelo, otro día no pusieron alfombra de baño. Alguna toalla muy desgastada. El desayuno es bueno pero un poco justo en calidad y variedad. En fin la experiencia aunque buena no ha sido capaz de convencernos para repetir, creo que hay mejores ofertas hoteleras en Barcelona por este precio.",4,2019,11,24

La verdad es que no les falto un detalle.

Llegamos sobre las 10:00 de la mañana al hotel, porque nos habian adelantado un vuelo.

Y aunque el checking era a las 15:00, como tenian la habitacion disponible nos la arreglaron y nos dejaron pasar a descansar.

A parte del detalle de la invitación al cafe con un bocadillito de paleta iberica.

La Habitación genial, la cama super confortable.

El hotel nos encanto, el spa acogedor.
El poder acceder a cocinas para ir a recepción (tmb teniamos una ruta alternativa), a nosotros amantes de la cocina nos gusto mucho.

La verdad que no falto detalle. Cuando bajamos a cenar, nos volvieron arreglar la
Habitación, nos dejaron unos bombones y nos la acomodaron para dormir.

45,Necesita mejorar los detalles y mantenimiento,"Acabo de llegar de pasar una noche en este hotel. No suelo escribir opiniones en caliente, pero aunque ya le he transmitido mi opinión a ellos, creo que es necesario hacerlo público ya que veo que no soy el único que piensa igual. les voy a relatar la experiencia tal como la he sentido desde la reserva hasta la salida.

Reservé el penthouse con unos 5 meses de antelación para celebrar el aniversario de mi pareja. Ya habíamos estado en el restaurante para su aniversario hace 2 años y nos encantó y nos quedamos con las ganas de visitar el hotel.

Al reservar pregunté si tenían cargador de coche eléctrico y me respondieron que solo era de tesla. Ellos me pidieron que confirmara la reserva al menos con 48h y que especificara cuando llegaría.

Les dije que no sabia exactamente cuando llegaría, pero que confirmaría unos días antes de la visita. Les llamé 3 días antes, tal y como pedían con la intención de confirmar la llegada y todo. La sorpresa fue que me dijeron que yo ya había confirmado todo. me sorprendió un poco, pero no le di más importancia. les insistí en el cumpleaños mis alergias, etc. la sensación de la llamada fue, cuelga rápido que ya tenemos toda la info y tenemos mucho trabajo ahora. al menos esa fue mi sensación...pensé... tal vez es algo puntual y que las críticas al servicio que lees por aquí siempre son exageradas...

total que llega el día, y vine con otro coche, por lo del cargador eléctrico, no es un problema hacer eso, pero me sorprendió ver que si que tenían el típico cargador para tesla y también para otros eléctricos y al comentarlo en recepción me dicen que si que tienen esos dos tipos. por lo que ya no empezamos bien...por cierto las plazas ocupadas por una moto y un coche de gasolina...

En el check in nos explican todo, cobran, solventamos dudas y nos acompañan a la habitación. la verdad que no tengo queja.

ya en la habitación, a pesar de comentar que era el aniversario de mi pareja. No había ningún tipo de detalle por parte del hotel. no es algo que exija, pero habiendo estado en varios hoteles de la ciudad del mismo nivel (en teoría), celebrando aniversarios, cumpleaños y eventos importantes, siempre han tenido algún tipo de detalle...que te hacen sentir mucho mejor y la verdad, creo que son cosas que no se piden pero se deben hacer en hoteles 5* GL.

En cuanto la habitación, el diseño, es muy bonito, y también es muy tranquila. Se nota que tiene cierto tiempo y bastante desgaste. Los muebles y las paredes se notan desgastadas y la ducha como dice una crítica del diciembre pasado, tienen que arreglarla, ya que los chorros salen por desigual, aunque para mi no es algo grave, pero si lo es, ver que ya se quejaron hace mes y medio y no lo han arreglado. por lo que te da la sensación de dejadez y falta mantenimiento y volviendo a lo de siempre en esta categoría y siendo un hotel pequeño estas cosas no deberían pasar.

en cuanto al restaurante, solo comentar que tuve la misma sensación de descontrol y dejadez en los detalles, y tampoco tuvieron ningún detalle por ser el cumpleaños. pusieron una vela cuando, al pedir la cuenta, les comenté que no habían traído ninguna vela de cumpleaños. de todas formas en breve haré la crítica del restaurante y detallaré como fue todo, ya que merece un capitulo aparte.

volviendo a la habitación, la cama es de 2*2m diría que es un colchón de muelles ensacados con un topper. el topper se nota poco mullido por lo que se nota que tiene uso, tal vez deberían revisarlo, de todas formas el descanso fue excelente y muy tranquilo el hotel, tal vez el mejor punto que tiene.

Pedimos el desayuno en la terraza del hotel. nos lo trajeron con 20 min de retraso y tuvimos que pedir que nos ayudaran a ponerlo en la terraza, cosa que en el check in nos dijeron que se encargaban ellos. como mínimo tal vez preguntar si lo queremos dentro o fuera no? teniendo en cuenta que estas en el penthouse...detalles...

en cuanto al desayuno en si, a mi me ha gustado, pero sinceramente, hay de mucho mejores. un poco más de variedad tal vez. eso si el carrito que lo han traído, el mantel muy limpio, pero lo que son las patas de la silla de ruedas se veían como manchadas de café y polvo. muy sucias...más detalles...

en el check out nos volvieron a pedir disculpas por lo de la cena y no nos han cobrado el parking, un detalle, pero el pescado ya estaba vendido por así decirlo.

en resumen, por lo que pagas, yo escogería otras cosas en Barcelona, con mejor servicio y calidad de habitación. Es una lastima por que el edificio y el diseño de la habitación muy buena, y además la comida de Jordi Cruz excelente, pero si no cuidan los detalles, todo esto queda en agua de borraja y la experiencia pierde mucho. Le pongo 3 estrellas por que no todo es malo, pero he salido muy disgustado, sobretodo por lo que pasó en el restaurante.",3,2019,01,27
45,EXCELENTE HABITACION,"Excelente hotel, solo aconsejable si vas a cenar en el restaurante. Combina diseño y funcionalidad. Todo cuidado al mínimo detalle. Lo mas gustito por su tamaño es el spa. El desayuno una maravilla, todavía recuerdo el huevo poché. ",5,2019,01,15
45,La atención al cliente es pésima.,"Nos alojamos dos días y al llegar, tuvimos que esperar más de 20 minutos para ser atendidos, solo una persona en recepción y no precisamente muy agradable. 
Las plazas de aparcamiento no están reservadas a pesar de alojarte, y si tienes la mala suerte de llegar en un día dónde el restaurante sirve cena/comida, no consigues aparcar a pesar de haber pagado tu reserva de parking, esto está muy mal organizado, así que, un toque de atención. En general las instalaciones son buenas, aunque reconozco que esperaba más. El desayuno es muy amplio y muy bueno.",3,2018,12,23
45,Luces y sombras,"En general tuvimos una estadía muy buena en ABaC. Sin embargo, en comparación a otros hoteles, por ejemplo Atrio y Akelarre, ABaC simplemente no se encuentra en la misma liga por el momento. Se puede ver un poco que ABaC no es un hotel privado, donde el manager/chef es el propietario, y como en muchos espacios similares, sin duda se beneficiará de una presencia más frecuente del manager. Son cosas pequeñas que hacen la diferencia entre un hotel verdaderamente de 5 estrellas, y, por lo menos por el moment, el ABaC:

- la recepción pueda ser más acogedor y caliente. El espacio presente no invita mucho a entrar. Si, es un problema de espacio, pero indica que la prioridad esta en el restaurante, y el hotel solo se queda como adición

- No es cosa mayor, pero está un poco incomodo de pasar cada vez por la cocina cuando se quiere ir o venir de la algunas habitaciones. 

- las habitaciones muy bonitas y suficientemente amplias. La terraza del penthouse especular. El internet fantástico, la tecnología excelente. Sin embargo, por lo menos en el penthouse si se necesitan unos arreglos. Lo más importante: La ducha está casi no se pudo usar porque la cabeza (de un tamaño impresionante, eso si) ha perdido unos puntos de salida de agua, y así el agua chorreaba en media docena de lugares muy fuerte, y en el resto muy poco. Este significa que la temperatura también estaba muy desigual. De veras fue mucho mejor la ducha afuera cerca del whirlpool. El area de baño en general bonito, pero no muy funcional, dado que la parte mas amplia del mesón de lavamanos es - el lavamanos, y no hay mucho espacio para dejar cosas.

- Solo se entregaba una botella de agua al inicio de una estadía de 3 días. Sí, había por supuesto agua en el minibar, pero señores, dando a los huéspedes un pco de agua gratuita cada día no cuesta nada, y da una impresión mucho mejor.

- Lo peor: El desayuno. Sin ninguna duda de una calidad muy inferior en comparación a otros hoteles de esta categoría. Yoghurts industriales como elección y bollería y pan con apariencia industrial?? Un bowl de frutas sin mucho sabor? En un hotel con restaurante de 3 estrellas Michelin? Serio??? Esperábamos una calidad mucho mejor del desayuno.

- el equipo muy bueno y amable. Sin embargo, se tiene la impresión que falta personal en el hotel. Por fin - tienen 15 habitaciones y así pocos huéspedes. Qué difícil será de ver el manager de vez en cuando en la recepción para saludar a los huéspedes? Así la estadía se se sentirá mucho más personalizada.

De modo cómo se encuentra el hotel ABaC por el momento, definitivo hay lugares mejores para quedarse en Barcelona. Si queremos comer en el Restaurante ABaC en el futuro, sin duda buscaremos otro lugar para quedarnos.",4,2018,12,14
45,Difícil mejorar....,"He estado un fin de semana con mi mujer, decidimos ir al ABaC y probar, he de decir, que desde que entramos por la puerta, ha sido increíble!, el trato de Cristina en recepción y de sus compañeros, es magnífico, te hacen sentirte como en casa desde el minuto 1, no ponen una mala cara, no existen los problemas, te ayudan en todo lo que necesites, vamos, inmejorable.
La habitación es amplia y con todo lo necesario y más, tv enorme y con todos los canales de ahora, hidromasaje, ducha enorme, cama alta y muy cómoda, servicio de habitaciones fuera de lo común....
Tiene un spa que no es muy grande pero es acogedor y completo, además de tranquilo.
En fin, un hotel que es verdad que no es barato, pero es de ensueño....., y si visitas ya el restaurante, alucinas en colores!!!!
Nosotros cenamos y elegimos el menú vanguardia, simplemente espectacular, la comida y el trato, además que tuvimos la suerte de ver a Jordi Cruz, que por cierto es muy simpático.

Resumiendo, lo recomiendo 100%, es una escapada perfecta!!!!",5,2018,11,22
45,Bueno pero muy caro para lo que es,"Hotel de 5 estrellas en la zona alta de Barcelona. El hotel forma parte de un recinto en el que está el conocido restaurante Abac del cocinero Jordi Cruz.

El Hotel, arquitectónicamente, es complicado. No es el típico hotel de un edificio con diferentes plantas y pasillos claros, si no que es algo complicado moverse por él; en especial por la ubicación del restaurante. Como curiosidad, es fácil acabar en pleno restaurante al intentar llegar a tu habitación.

Las habitaciones son cómodas y espaciosas, y en general el hotel es bueno. Sin embargo, para los servicios que ofrece el hotel, ubicación, etc. el precio es tremendamente ELEVADO. Hay hoteles de 5 estrellas en BArcelona que por centenares de euros menos te ofrecen desayuno, sala lounge, cena, etc. 

Es un hotel que, obviamente, la mayoría de gente jamás podrá permitirse alojarse en él. 
Tienen un spa en el hotel bastante bonito.",4,2018,11,08

45,Un hotel a la altura del restaurante,"Después de cenar en el restaurante Abac, pasar una noche en el mismo hotel es toda una experiencia y un placer! Las habitaciones son espectaculares! No muy grandes, pero con espacio suficiente y todos los detalles imaginables, a la altura de un 5*. La cama alta y muy cómoda! Y el baño con ducha y bañera hidromasaje. Con amenities de calidad y detalles que no están en todos los hoteles. La terraza de la habitación también muy agradable, un pequeño oasis dentro de Barcelona, dado que hay mucha vegetación y da mucha paz y tranquilidad.
El servicio de habitaciones muy atento, te explican todas las comodidades del hotel. El spa muy relajante y tranquilo. 
El desayuno también muy rico. Quizás la única pega es que no fuera de bufet. Uno puede pensar que es un poco vulgar para un hotel de 5*, pero por otro lado cuando encuentras un buen bufet, bien presentado y con productos de calidad (como es el caso), también es muy apetitoso. Hay una carta con los productos que tienen disponibles para el desayuno y le puedes pedir al camarero todo lo que quieras. 
Una gran combinación, una cena exquisita al restaurante y alojarse una noche en el hotel. El regalo perfecto para cualquier pareja, familia o amigos!",5,2018,08,10
45,Un hotel a la altura del Restaurante ,"El enclave del hotel ya promete mucho...en medio de una de las mejores zonas de Barcelona y dentro de un jardín que resulta un remanso de paz en medio de la ciudad. 
El hotel está decorado de manera muy zen, transmite mucha paz con sus tonos blancos y crema...yo me he alojado tres veces, dos en suite y otra en suite del ático que es sencillamente espectacular, con una terraza muy amplia donde incluso puedes cenar y un jacuzzi gigante donde puedes disfrutar del cielo barcelonés.  
Las habitaciones cuidan el máximo detalle, con amenities muy completas y los baños tremendamente originales, con bañera cerrada y ducha incorporada para ducharte o bañarte dentro de la misma estancia a modo de SPA. 
El desayuno es cosa aparte, a la carta y a la altura de un Rte 3 estrellas.

45,CUANDO TODO SUPERA TUS EXPECTATIVAS,"Uno de nuestros grandes aciertos ha sido pasar la noche en el hotel , disfrutar de la cena, y no hay que obviar, disfrutar del desayuno, el spa y los masajes.
El hotel es pequeño, ideal para parejas, tranquilo, preparado para el mejor de los descansos: calidad de la cama, baño, servicio habitaciones...todo de un 5 estrellas GL
Del restaurante...que voy a decir yo, MARAVILLOSO. Al acabar el excelente menú y comentar la experiencia con mi pareja utilicé un adjetivo: delicado!. Eso es, me pareció muy delicado. Pero esta vez es que no quiero pararme a comentar las excelencias de la cocina, esto ya lo sabe todo el mundo pero sí quiero hacer hincapié en el personal del hotel y de la sala. Perfectos!, si, perfectos todos. Una especial mención a Fran. Es maravilloso encontrar un personal tan profesional y tan sumamente joven!. 
Terminamos el fin de semana con ópera, ¿que más se puede pedir?.....REPETIR",5,2018,06,18
45,La mejor cena de mi vida,"Compré un vale regalo para celebrar Sant Jordi con mi pareja. La idea era comer y alojarnos en el hotel, pero hice la reserva del alojamiento y no la del restaurante (cuidado con eso, no queda muy claro que hay que hacerlas a parte). 
Llegó el día anterior y los del restaurante me llamaron para decir que no encontraban mi reserva para la comida y casi me da algo. Era error mío y evidentemente el restaurante estaba lleno y no se podía reservar.
Por suerte, el metre nos pudo hacer un hueco para la cena. Muchas gracias por eso, no es nada fácil en un restaurante con 3*Michelín.

Todo salió perfecto. La habitación era una superior con terraza, la mejor para mi gusto. No es la más cara pero puedes disfrutar de la terraza si hace buen día y desayunar en ella.
El spa es estupendo, muy limpio, tranquilo (estuvimos solas todo el rato) y muy moderno.

Teníamos hora a las 21h. El chef Jordi Cruz estaba en la terraza tranquilamente, los camareros súper gentiles, el ambiente tranquilo y romántico y la comida...la mejor cena de mi vida.

Todo muy recomendable. Es muy caro, pero se te olvida cuánto cuesta si disfrutas de cada detalle y entiendes todo el trabajo que hay detrás.

Un fin de semana de placeres inolvidables. 

Gràcies a tot l'equip de l'ABaC!!

Jordi Cruz, vindrem un dia a fer-nos una foto amb tu. Treballes massa!!",5,2018,04,24
45,Una gran experiencia gastronómica ,"Mi madre cumplía 69 añitos y qué mejor celebrarloen este restaurante ;-) Mis padres ya habían comido en este restaurante cuando tenía una estrella michelín y tenían muy buen recuerdo... y siguen teniéndolo. La experiencia fue muy buena para lis tres. 

Era un día lluvioso así que el aperitivo (los tres primeros platos del menú) los degusamos en la cocina y la verdad es que ese detalle está muy bien (casi mejor que el jardín) ya que puedes ver como funciona por dentro. El camarero nos fue explicando cuantos empleados trabajan en cada lugar. Todo muy entretenido. 

Luego pasas a la mesa y eliges el menú. Tienen dos: el tradicional 155€ y el de la temperada por 185€. Elegimos el primero porque nos gustaban más los platos (15). Si no sabes qué vino elegir te lo sugiere una etnóloga muy amable que acertó por completo.

Todo el proceso es toda una experiencia. Cada plato te lo explican aunque me perdí algunas explicaciones al estar embobada con los platos. Acabas los 15 platos bien, sin estar a tope y se agradece. 

Como era el cumple de mi mami, le trajeron sorpresa un mini pastel con una vela.. ¡un gran detalle! Nos hubiese gustado saludar al chef Jordi Cruz pero no pudo ser aunque lo vimos al salir del párking ;-( ",5,2018,04,12
45,Impresionante se queda corto,"Desde el primer momento, tu estancia se convierte en una experiencia diferente a lo vivido hasta ese momento y tanto en el hotel como en el restaurante.
Es una experiencia que si te la puedes permitir y te gustan este tipo de vivencias, merece la pena vivirlo.",5,2018,04,09
45,Buena experiencia,"Pasamos tres días en el Abac Hotel y puedo decir que el servicio, atención, instalaciones y todo en general fue Excelente. Las habitaciones geniales y totalmente insonorizadas, no se oye nada y se descansa de categoría. En cuanto al restaurante correcto. Elegimos el menú largo con maridaje que duró unas tres horas. Camareros atentos y la cena y selección de vinos buena. Desayuno completo y de calidad. Aunque pasamos tres días en el Abac solo vimos el primer dia y unos segundos al Chef Jordi Cruz. Posteriormente aunque solicitamos poder saludarle, nos comentaron que no se personó por el Hotel durante todos estos días. El Chef tendría que ser más cercano a sus clientes tal y como hacen otros profesionales también con ⭐️⭐️⭐️.",4,2018,04,02
45,Meraviglioso,"Tre stelle Michelin.. si vedono tutte. Esperienza unica, servizio eccellente, piatti eccezionali. 
Ottima location per festeggiare il nostro primo anniversario di matrimonio.
Un percorso lungo sapori da noi non conosciuti.
Unico appunto che ci ha fatto sorridere è stato un cameriere che nel descrivere i piatti indicava i singoli ingredienti con il dito, portandolo a 1 cm dal piatto, allungandoci il braccio davanti al viso.
Ma questo aspetto non ha influito sul nostro giudizio. MERAVIGLIOSO",5,2018,03,30
45,¿Cuando repetimos?,"Mi pareja me invitó a pasar un fin de semana en ABaC y he quedado enamorada.
El hotel pequeñito pero con encanto. Muy divertido tener que pasar por la cocina para acceder a ls habitaciones.
El servicio de habitaciones muy correcto. Fuimos al spa, pequeñito pero ideal y al volver de cenar nos habían cambiado las toallas y albornoces.
La cena impresionante. Empezamos bien con 4 tapas dentro de la cocina y acabamos contentísimos con el maridaje.
El gintonic en la terraza culminó la noche.
El desayuno del día siguiente no nos dejó indiferentes, las pastitas, el huevo y el bocadillo ibérico.
Contando los días para volver.",5,2018,03,19
45,Merecida 3a estrella,"Fuimos con mi pareja a disfrutar del menú degustación y la experiencia fue fenomenal.
El chef, Jordi, muy atento y el menú es accesible para ser un 3 estrellas.
Sin duda repetiría y lo recomendaría a todo el mundo",5,2018,03,15
45,Im-presionante,"Aunque ya había ido en una ocasión, la tercera estrella Michelin y el tercer aniversario con mi pareja lo merecían. Menú degustación a un precio normal para un tres estrellas, creo que es de los mas económicos de su nivel. Cocina de otro nivel en el que se demuestra el buen hacer de Jordi Cruz y su evolución desde la anterior visita, menú completisimo, el diseño de los platos excelente y sabores diferentes a cualquier otros platos que uno haya probado.
Cuidan todos los detalles al maximo, el inicio con el aperitivo en la cocina es una gran idea.
Gracias a Jordi y a Cristina por la atención recibida desde el inicio.",5,2018,03,14
45,... und wieder war es ausgezeichnet,"waren im Dezember auf einen Kurztrip in Barcelona und wieder mal im ABaC. Wie immer ausgzeichnet - Qualität und Service stimmen einfach. Nicht billig - aber jeden Cent wert.

Klare Empfehlung!

Waren 15 Minuten zu früh - sie hatten gerade Briefing - wurden in eine lässige Lounge im Keller begleitet mit einem Glas Champagner ""bewaffnet"" - coole Loungemusik - genau so stellt man sich das vor",5,2018,03,04
45,Uno de los mejores fines de semana con mi pareja,excelente restaurante con un hotel a su altura. Todo gira alrededor del restaurante y esto  es lo que lo hace distinto de los demás. Nivel altísimo de trato y de calidades en servicio y productos. Repetiríamos sin duda y lo aconsejaríamos porque te permite valorar un hotel y sus restaurante del más alto nivel,5,2018,02,26
45,Noche idílica,"Pasamos una noche con el pack romántico y cenamos en el restaurante.
Comida excelentísima, a la altura de las estrellas que tiene. Los platos súper bien elaborados, equilibrados y originales. El trato excelente y el ambiente muy agradable. Las instalaciones del hotel están bien, el spa no es muy grande pero suficiente si hay poca gente.
Única pega para mi gusto, que te cobren extra la copa de cava de bienvenida, el agua y el té en la cena, en mi opinión debería estar incluído en el menú (185 euros por el menú).",5,2018,02,06
45,Excelente,"Estuvimos una noche para cenar al ABaC, todo muy bien, la atención previa a la llegada, la llegada, las explicaciones de la habitación, la atención del personal.
Como anectdota, estábamos en una zona del hotel que para acceder o salir debíamos pasar por la cocina, en este caso es una anécdota buena.
Detalles a mejorar, iluminación de algunas zonas del baño, y simplificar mando cortinas o nota de uso, detalles que no empañan la excelente opinión con la que salimos.
Desayuno excelente, únicamente como detalle faltaban variedades de azúcar para el café, solo había azúcar blanco y debería haber también moreno y sacarina",5,2018,01,28
45,Fin de semana romàntico,"Mis hijos nos regalaron una cena y una noche en el hotel ABaC, una experiencia difícil de olvidar empezando por la visita a las instalaciones cocina spah i jardines donde nos obsequiaron con una copa de cava. Después el fantástico menú degustación de Toni Cruz , el baño romántico en nuestra  magnífica habitación , y al despertar llamamos para pedir el desayuno a la carta que nos subieron en una mesita de lo más chic.",5,2018,01,24
45,Una noche excelente,"El servicio fue muy amable y en todo momento se preocupa para que tu estancia sea lo mejor posible. La habitación es espaciosa, bonita y muy comoda y silenciosa. Solo una noche pero fue realmente bonita. ",5,2018,01,21
45,Excelente,"El local muy acogedor, los platos sorpremdemtes.....una mezcla de nuevos sabores con una presentación espectacular.

Muy recomendable.....el precio alto.",5,2018,01,21
45,Excelente,"Estuvimos en una habitacion superior con terraza, como anteriormente habíamos utilizado. Muy confortable y super limpia. El personal de la recepcion muy amables.

45,Tranquilidad y exquisitez,"Magnifica experiecia en todos los sentidos. El restaurante es excepcional los menús son perfectamente equilibrados y el servicio y la atencion están a la altura. El hotel es un remanso de paz, de tranquilidad y de magnifica decoración y gran número de detalles pensados en la comodidad del húesped y que hacen de la estancia un completo placer.",5,2018,01,10
45,Buenísimo hotel ,"Cogimos el combo habitación más comida en el restaurante. La habitación que elegimos fue la que tenía terraza. Decoración y confort excepcionales. El hotel es muy pequeñito pero desprende serenidad. Está cerca del barrio de gracia. Como punto curioso, para entrar y salir de las habitaciones se pasa por las cocinas. Muy amables Jordi Cruz y equipo. ",4,2018,01,05
45,Extraordinario,"Es lo que mejor define este gran restaurante, un gran tres estrellas, sin duda tiene algunas cosillas a mejorar , pero quien no, el servicio extraordinario té hace sentir bien , olvidándote de que es un tres estrellas, y sintiéndote muy a gusto. Sin duda muy bien dada la tercera Michelin , felicidades ",5,2018,01,04
45,10 sobre 10,"Comer y disfrutar o al revés, no sabría decirlo.

Todo, todo, sin ningún ‘pero’.

Por algo será lo de la tercera * !!!

A veces lo breve, si bueno, dos veces bueno. En ABaC se cumple la frase a la perfección.

Gracias Jordi y equipo por la experiencia!

45,"Remanso de paz, calidad y servicio.","Hotel fantástico, y Restaurante sublime, muy recomendable para una escapada. Las habitaciones son muy confortables. El Restaurante es de un nivel y calidad máxima. Se observa el nivel de exigencia del equipo. El menú es una experiencia de sabores, olores y colores increíble. El mejor Bloody Mary que he bebido en mi vida.",5,2017,12,05
45,Genial,"Un sitio acorde a las espectadoras, elegancia, gusto y profesionalidad, un lugar donde vale la pena volver y digno de recomendar, precio asequible si se tiene en referencia la calidad, tanto del producto como del servicio
",5,2017,12,04
45,ABac,"Iba con una expectativa muy elevada y realizamos pack Gourmet (menú Gourmet y habitación hotel). Encontré de muy alto nivel la ejecución de los platos y las instalaciones, a pesar de no estar el chef, Jordi Cruz. Pero me pareció excesivo poner tres platos de caldos, a partir del lenguado mejoró y encontré algún postre flojo y con abuso del azúcar. En general la experiencia y como celebración de mi aniversario muy bien",4,2017,12,03
45,Todo estupendo,"El hotel es pequeño, pero esta impecable, muy moderno, acogedor, muy cuidado, con todos los detalles que se pueden esperar.
El servicio es exquisito y en  el restaurante impresionante la presentación y la calidad de los platos.",5,2017,11,06
45,Alucinante,"Vale cada euro que cuesta, es mas, cuando acabé lo encontre hasta barato. 16 platos mas cinco postres y nueve vinos. Recomiendo ir mejor al mediodia. El servicio es buenisimo y muy bien instruido y el sitio es un pequeño vergel a los pies del tibidabo.",5,2017,10,02
45,Wunderbares Mittagessen,"Hätten einen Tip von einem Freund erhalten und sind sogleich losgezogen. Das Ambiente, die Bedienung und vor allem das Essen war äußerst überzeugend!! Jedermann der ein außergewöhnliches Restauranterlebnis sucht muss im Abac gewesen sein. ",5,2017,09,29
45,Con los 5 sentidos !!!,"La combinación cena más alojamiento es perfecta!!!
No os perdáis un rato de descanso en el Spa.
Toda una experiencia para lo sentidos, con un gusto insuperable.
El hotel merece la calificación.
La cocina es pura técnica aplicada para conseguir una explosión de sabores que se combinan exquisitamente.",5,2017,09,24
45,ARTE Y COMIDA FUNDIDOS EN SABORES,"Arte de los cinco sentidos convertido en comida, realmente fantástico, disfrutaba viendo esas presentaciones y elaboraciones in situ de platos, los aromas que desprendían,  disfrutaban mis oídos en esas elaboraciones con esos contrastes de infusión a estado sólido a través del nitrógeno líquido y con la amabilidad y trato del personal, disfrute con el tacto ya que te invitan a utilizar las propias manos para coger algún producto del plato y disfrute sin duda de los espectaculares sabores de todos los platos.
Pueden decir que es  minimalista pero es mucha variedad con distintos sabores y texturas, son cuadros esculturas comestibles, y  verdaderamente muy satisfecho.
Enhorabuena a todo el equipo y chef",5,2017,09,17
45,Sobresaliente!,"El sábado pasado fuimos a comer, una gran experiencia de principio a fin.
El servicio perfecto, el entorno muy agradable, especialmente la terraza/jardín, y la comida sobresaliente!  
Algún día repetiremos...",5,2017,09,04
45,Un restaurante excepcional,"Sólo hablaré del restaurante y de las zonas del hotel que pude ver. En resumen ESPECTACULAR. 
Teníamos el menú degustación, y puedo decir que la experiencia fue increíble. Cada plato, para llorar... Qué bueno todo, cada plato una sorpresa, un sabor distinto. 
No es barato, pero si te lo puedes permitir, lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados.
En resumen, sensacional.",5,2017,09,01
45,Hotel fabuloso. Rte.exquisito,"Sin duda tenéis que alojaros en este hotel del que siempre recordaré su cama. Creo que es la más cómoda que he dormido nunca.
Además spa correcto para relajarse previo a que hagáis la obligatoria visita al restaurante.
Jordi, enhorabuena por tu creatividad. Exquisito.
Acceso por las cocinas muy original

Y remato con una última sorpresa ya que tras el alojamiento y la cena....el desayuno es brutal. Riquísimo. Disfrutas hasta el minuto final.",5,2017,08,15
45,Sensacional !!!,"Dos estrellas Michelín no se consiguen por casualidad. Realmente es un espectáculo disfrutar de La Cocina del Abac. Desde que llegas el sitio te hipnotiza por lo bien diseñado y pensado que está todo. Los aperitivos te los tomas en la cocina. Si, dentro de la cocina!! Hay que tenerlos bien puestos para meter a los comensales dentro de la cocina a enseñar los fogones. Impresiona ver a todo el equipo trabajando en una coreografía perfecta. 
 Disfrutamos del menú grande y cada plato te deja claro que hay horas de trabajo y años de rodaje en cada uno. 
 En los postres te hacen un helado en directo... flipante!!! 
 Por poner un pero diré que los descorches son bastante caros. Pero en estos sitios ya se sabe...
 En global, una experiencia única. Merece la pena. ",5,2017,08,14
45,Mucho más que un hotel,"A la hermosa ciudad de Barcelona, hay que sumarle la experiencia de alojarse en este hotel. Todo es excelente: las habitaciones, la atención, sus espacios comunes, la prolijidad.
A demás su restaurante de dos estrellas Michelin es increíble, reserven con anticipación y se acordarán por siempre de la experiencia de comer allí.",5,2017,08,11
45,Exquisito,Precioso restaurante situado en la zona alta de Barcelona. Los platos están muy elaborados. Los primeros aperitivos los comimos en la cocina y nos hicimos una foto con Jordi Cruz. Muy buen servicio. Recomendable 100%,5,2017,08,05
45,Gaumenschmaus in stilvoll unkompliziertem Ambiente,"Der Aperitif wurde uns im schönen, gepflegten Garten serviert. Währenddessen konnten wir uns zw 2 Menues entscheiden. Pro Tisch muss einheitlich gewählt werden. Wir entschieden uns mir zuliebe aufgrund des Zeitfaktors für das "" Kleine"" zu 140 Euro( mit Weinbegleitung, glaube ca 70 Euro kamen dazu) , da dies mit 2,5 h angesetzt war, das Große ( 170 Euro) hätte noch 1 Stunde mehr in Anspruch genommen. 
Es war auch für unseren Sohn mengenmäßig ( diese Befürchtung bestand im Vorfeld)ausreichend! 
Danach wurde  man in die Küche gebeten, was uns sehr gut gefiel( viel Personal, gelassene Stimmung unter den Köchen) - dort wurde uns ein Appetizer kredenzt, der eine himmlische Einstimmung war! 
Nun durften wir unseren Platz im eigentlichen Restaurant einnehmen( 45 Min waren da ca auch schon vergangen) , welches modern, hell schlicht- elegant eingerichtet ist. 
Ein ausgesprochen versiertes, unaufdringliches,  junges Team stand uns zur Seite! 
Das Essen war sowohl geschmacklich, als auch von der Anrichtung  hervorragend! Teils wurde am Tisch schon eine "" Kleine Überraschung"" für den nächsten Gang vorbereitet- mehr möchte ich nicht vorwegnehmen, da es eine Freude ist, es selber zu erleben! 
Ein , für diesen Aufwand , angemessenes Preis- Leistungs- Verhältnis! ",5,2017,08,04
45,Impresionante cocina,"Sin lugar a duda un lugar increíble, una cocina impresionante y productos de primerísima calidad...todo lo que se diga sobre el es correcto, acertado y puede que se quede corto.
Servicio atento, profesional y servicial",4,2017,07,25
45,Una gran experiencia,"Este hotel es una maravilla, la limpieza de las habitaciones, comodidad, amenidades y tranquilidad en general es de primer nivel, el restaurante obviamente también te ofrece una experiencia culinaria perfecta, de preferencia se tiene que reservar con antelación, creo que la mayoría de las ventanas son dobles lo cual te permite estar aislado por completo del ruido del exterior, tal vez lo único que no es lo mas óptimo (todo depende desde que ángulo lo veamos) es la ubicación, está un poco retirado de las típicas zonas turísticas de Barcelona aunque tienes una estación de metro justo cruzando la calle, ahora, estar ubicado acá también te da una sensación de tranquilidad que se disfruta...",5,2017,07,24
45,Muy bueno aunque esperaba algo más ,"Quizás mi opinión está sugestionada porque hemos visto demasiado al chef del restaurante en tv y claro cuando uno viene espera ese algo más que no está porque a lo mejor no debe estar. El restaurante es excelente, los platos espectaculares como la materia prima, el servicio impecable...con algún detalle incluido, posiblemente si Jordi Cruz no saliese en tv se le valoraría mucho más ",5,2017,07,23
45,Esperaba algo más,"Como restaurante que opta a la tercera estrella esperaba ese salto, tal y como he visto en otros. Menú correcto, mucha técnica, sabor y riesgo en algún plato, pero le falta un punto más. Destaco la parpatana de atún, excelente sabor y ejecución. Servicio atento y moderno. Lounge agradable y comedor excelente, quizá innecesaria la excursión por pasillos y cocina, aunque ahí vi al chef que por cierto, no sale a la sala, como sí hacen la mayoría. Pan y café de mucho nivel. Como notas negativas, demasiado tiempo de espera entre algunos platos y el precio de los vinos, no es normal triplicar o cuadriplicar el precio de tienda. Nunca había visto algo así en España.",4,2017,07,20
45,Hotel de primera en Barcelona. ,"Pasamos una noche en este hotel, aprovechando para cenar en el restaurante del mismo nombre. Pequeño y súper moderno, no decepciona y cumple con las expectativas. Habitaciones muy bien equipadas, merece mencionar la comodidad de las camas, enormes y mullidas. El desayuno, en el jardín, merece la pena. Para repetir. ",5,2017,07,02
45,Grande 2 stelle,"Fantastica degustazione di 10 portate con piatti che spaziano dal pesce alla carne, combinando sapori anche molto contrastanti. Ottima carta dei vini, splendida location in uno dei quartieri più prestigiosi di Barcellona. 
Da provare!",5,2017,06,17
45,Genial,"Nos hemos quedado 2 noches en otro hotel en el Centre de Barcelona(ver otra review)que no ha deufradado y 2 Noches en el Abac. Toda una experiencia el abac. JOrdi cruz está llevando un hotel maraviloso, nos han pasado sin coste a una habitación con terraza, paz y tranquilidad, habitaciones hermosas, muy limpias y verdaderamente nuevas y impecable. Desayuno increíble",5,2017,06,12
45,Falta cuidar los detalles.,"El hotel ABaC Barcelona es un 5 estrellas gran lujo y por lo tanto de este hotel se espera lo mejor. Tiene unas habitaciones espaciosas, unas camas comodísimas, y unos acabados de diseño.

En mi caso, la cisterna del wc perdía agua constantemente, y la placa que hace de fondo de la pica de las manos estaba rota en una de sus esquinas. Cualquier cosa del minibar tiene un precio escandaloso y para poner la guinda al pastel el parking no es gratuito. 
Todo esto reservando una habitación DELUXE, con dos menús El Gran ABaC, con un coste de aproximadamente 700€.

En el apartado del restaurante, la cena estaba deliciosa, los platos eran sorprendentes, quizás el único pero es que las mesas estaban tan juntas que escuchaba la explicación del plato de la mesa de al lado y para cuando me llegaba a la mesa ya sabía lo que me iban a servir.

Comenté todos estos aspectos en su encuesta de satisfacción, y su respuesta fue:
""...es por ello que en breve se pondrá en contacto con Ud. una persona de nuestro departamento de calidad."" 
Por supuesto, nadie de su departamento de calidad se ha puesto en contacto con nosotros.",4,2017,06,08
45,FUE UNA CENA IMPRESIONANTE,"Excelente el lugar. Exquisita la decoración y el cuidado del hotel boutique. El chef SUPER AMABLE Y MUY TALENTOSO .
Buena carta de vinos acorde a todo.

UN TALENTOSO DE VERDAD",5,2017,05,23
45,Fantástico ,"Fantástico hotel, habitaciones amplias, de las mejores camas que e provado de hotel,el personal fantástico todos al 100%, y la cena con menú degustación maravillosa,, me faltó un poquito más de minutos en nuestro paso por La Cocina y ver al xef jordi cruz dirigiendo al equipo, pero entiendo que en pleno servicio es complicado... la cena de lujo de principio a fin con unos camareros súper enrollados.. disfrute como un niño en un parque!!! FELICIDADES equipo del ABAC!!!",5,2017,05,22
45,El desayuno es espectacular,"Se duerme de maravilla, las habitaciones son amplias y con un gusto espectacular. El spa es sencillamente fantástico y el restaurante lounge de abajo sin palabras. El desayuno es de lo mejor que he probado propio de Jordi Cruz. El paso a las habitaciones por la zona de la cocina ideal porque ves lo que es un restaurante con tanta emoción y pasión. El restaurante Michelin sin duda de los mejores que he estado. Un nueve en servicio y en atención.",4,2017,05,12
45,El magnífico Abac,"Una vez más mi reconocimiento a una labor que comienza en la dirección y se extiende la resto de personals del hotel. Un lugar discreto, elegante, confortable vamos que desde la habitación pasando por al comedor haste el spa es dificil encontrar algo de su categoría. No haré más halagos pero sinceramente estamos en hablando de un hotel de autético  ""lujo"", sin estridencias",5,2017,05,03
45,Alucinante!!!!,"Grandioso, espectacular. Dos estrellas michelin totalmente merecidas. Califas impresionante. Y para darle un plus más, el hecho que esté el chef y tengas la opción de saludarle ya es la leche. Volveremos ",5,2017,04,22
45,Gran EXPERIENCIA!,"Hotel situado al norte de la ciudad, en un barrio tranquilo pero muy bien comunicado. Quién diría que en una ciudad como Barcelona se podría disfrutar de una experiencia tan relajante.

Tan sólo estuvimos una noche pero disfrutamos como enanos... cocina de 2 estrellas michelin, el spa renovado y acogedor donde pasamos parte de nuestra estancia, una terraza ajardinada donde pudimos degustar un gran cócktail. 

En cuanto a las habitaciones, estas son acogedoras, con una gran televisión y una cama de ensueño. No llegamos a probar el room service. 

Cabe destacar la amabilidad y buen hacer del personal de todo el hotel (recepción, sala, cocina, las chicas de la limpieza...). Me gustaría mencionar los nombres de quienes nos atendieron pero no los recuerdo. 

Gracias a ellos esta estancia ha sido realmente placentera. 

Volveremos seguro!!",5,2017,04,18
45,SUBLIME,"Estuvimos disfrutando en él de nuestro aniversario.
Unos días inolvidables gracias a ABAC y a todo su equipo el cual consiguió que tras mucho tiempo consiguiéramos preocuparnos únicamente de disfrutar.
Con una ubicación inmejorable y un entorno idílico en pleno pulmón de Barcelona, con estupendas comunicaciones y servicios. Un lugar donde poder pasar el día sin necesidad de salir, ya sea por sus instalaciones empezando por el spa y zona de masajes hasta llegar a su inmejorable gastronomía y su zona jardín donde tomar una copa tras un día de relax.
Por último y no menos importante; agradecer al staff toda la amabilidad y atención recibida a lo largo de nuestros días.
¡una gran recomendación en todos los sentidos!",5,2017,04,18
45,COMIDA MAGNIFICA,"Comida de aniversario espectacular. Platos exquisitamente presentados, y cada uno superando al anterior. Materia prima cuidada hasta el ultimo detalle, vino delicioso, champagne sublime 
Sala perfecta, pero al tomar el café en el jardín , aun mejoró toda nuestra maravillosa comida, con el café y sus pequeños chocolates.

Es un placer poder comer en ABAC, es sin duda un lugar de extasis.",5,2017,04,17
45,UNA CENA UNICA Y EMOCIONANTE,"Fui con una amiga y una pareja...era la primera vez que iba a un restaurante de estas características y en cada plato se me erizaba la piel...
Emocionada con la presentación de cada delicatessen y enamorada del trato de todo el personal.
Deseando que llegue verano para llevar a mi pareja y alucine con el ambiente en la terraza...con tanta amabilidad..con tan gustosos platos y de una bonita noche.",5,2017,04,15
45,Un capricho que vale la pena!!!!!!!!,"Qué locura coger un avión para ir a cenar, se puede pensar; pero ha sido la mejor locura que he cometido. Desde que llegas al hotel te siente ""especial"". El hotel es tan maravilloso, que por momentos no sabía si cancelar la cena y quedarme en la habitación; pero por qué, si podía hacer las dos. Es la primera vez que viajo y no tengo pegas con la cama, que comodidad!! El baño integrado en la habitación era de ensueño, ya que te permite estar en la ducha al mismo tiempo que puedes ver, sin perder tu intimidad, toda la habitación. La limpieza fue exquisita. En todo momento estaban pendientes de que estuviese preparada para cada ocasión y sin molestar. La cena, simplemente, supero mis expectativas. Fue perfecto el servicio y la calidad de cada plato. Lo único a lo que pondría una pequeña queja es a la hora de elegir el vino que acompañaría la cena. En mi caso, nos sirvieron los entrantes en una salón perfecto para tal fin: luz tenue, ambiente relajado ... pero para mi no fue el mejor momento para hacer la elección, ya que no pude disfrutar como me hubiese gustado de ese momento. Estaba más pendiente de la elección que de disfrutar la primera parte de la cena. Todo fue maravilloso y para culminar la experiencia, pequeño encuentro con el Chef que nos trató, junto a todo su gran equipo, de lujo.",5,2017,04,05
45,Xavier y Natasha,Excelente. Excelencia en todo lo que hacen. La gastronomía el servicio los vinos y los champagne. Una experiencia 10 en Barcelona. El jardín exterior realmente exquisito . Muy recomendable. Xavier y Natasha.,5,2017,04,02
45,UNA EXPERIENCIA CUM LAUDE,"La experiencia en ABaC ha sido estupenda: personal muy atento y pendiente de cualquier necesidad, instalaciones modernas y muy cuidadas, habitaciones espaciosas, con agradable decoración y confortables, el spa y el servicio de masajes excelentes y la experiencia gourment en el restaurante sorprendente y exquisita.",5,2017,03,27
45,"habitación y cena de lujo, en todos los sentidos","Reservamos el paquete Gourmet.
La habitación era enorme y preciosa. En lugar de armario había vestidor. Super-luminosa. También es verdad que nos tocó la del final, que tenía 3 fachadas, o sea que veíamos 2 calles y el jardín.
La cena fué una sorpresa contínua; no sólo por el aspecto o la forma en que los camareros acababan de preparar los platos, si no por la intensidad del sabor que te quedaba en la boca, al paladear cada uno de ellos.
Todo delicioso. El camarero muy joven pero muy profesional. Super-atento.
En el hotel todos eran más que serviciales. No estabas nunca sólo. Siempre había alguien para ayudarte, acompañarte, guiarte o servirte lo que pidieras.
El jardín muy bonito y acogedor. El desayuno perfecto.",5,2017,03,15
45,Algunos inconvenientes,"Nos alojamos en fin de semana para celebrar mi cumpleaños y probar el menú degustación el domingo. El restaurante es excelente pero esta opinión es sobre el hotel. 

Hicimos el check in y una chica de recepción (Irene) nos acompaño a la habitación para explicarnos cómo funcionaban el altavoz, las luces etc. Hasta aquí todo perfecto pero cuando se fue quise ir al lavabo y me encontré con un manchurrón de sangre en el retrete que indicaba que no lo habían limpiado. Me dio asco, lógicamente, y bajamos a la recepción a decirlo. Nos pidieron disculpas y mandaron a alguien a limpiarlo. No soy nada tiquismiquis con la limpieza pero en un hotel de lujo me parece increíble que no limpien el wc cuando la habitación se va a ocupar por nuevos huéspedes. El resto de la limpieza era correcto, ni poco ni a fondo. 

La habitación era cómoda, era una Deluxe (815) pero el wifi iba fatal (los vídeos de YouTube en la tele se cortaban constantemente), la luz de lectura de un lado y los mandos del resto de luces no funcionaban. 

La cama era comodísima pero en la web pone que es de 2x2 y no lo era. Para nosotros no era un inconveniente pero es engañoso. También indican en su web que las habitaciones eran insonorizadas y no lo pongo en duda pero lo que sí se oía muchísimo eran las puertas de salida de las habitaciones colindantes. Tanto como para sobresaltarte en plena noche si alguien volvía tarde. 

El bar con terracita para tomar algo está genial y el spa también (es pequeño pero está muy bien pensado y muy cuidado).

El desayuno es increíble y te lo sirven, si quieres, en la habitación lo que es un punto a favor. 

La atención del personal también es correcta pero ya que sabían que era mi cumpleaños y siendo un pequeño hotel de tan sólo 15 habitaciones, habríamos agradecido algún detalle. Ellos dicen que no hay más habitaciones para que el trato sea personal pero nosotros no sentimos nada personalizado, aunque sí cordial. 

Como conclusión, me parece caro por no ser personalizado y la limpieza debería controlarse para evitar detalles desagradables.",3,2017,03,15
45,simplemente increible,"todo el personal increíble, un spa de categoría una atención desde que entras hasta la salida todo es amabilidad, al ser la primera vez que visitamos este tipo de establecimiento estábamos la verdad sea dicha los nervios los teníamos nosotros, mas cuando te quedas sorprendido que para acceder a las habitaciones te hacen pasar por medio de la cocina, con toda la normalidad del mundo.-

en fin INCREIBLE. para recomendar y volver",5,2017,03,10
45,Buena experiencia ,"Nuestra visita a este restaurante a sido muy buena y nos gustó mucho. Para empezar nos dieron un aperitivo, luego nos enseñaron la bodega y La Cocina, y finalmente nos acompañaron a la mesa para continuar con la cena. Los trabajadores muy agradables y la comida muy buena. Muy recomendable si te gusta experimentar nuevas comidas. ",5,2017,03,05
45,Viaggio di coppia,"Hotel 5 stelle gran lusso, tutte meritate. Impeccabile lo staff, la reception, il servizio e la cura dei dettagli. Soggiornato in camera standard, colazione a letto per tutti con possibilità di scelta il giorno prima, cambio di asciugamani e sistemazione camera piu volte al  giorno, che dire , incantevole.",5,2017,02,20

45,Obtienes lo que pagas,"Es un hotel realmente estupendo. Por que no le doy entonces los 5 puntos? Pues porque cuesta un mínimo de 300€ la noche, y con ese precio lo lógico es que todo sea perfecto y nos encontramos algunos detalles que hicieron un poco de sombra a la experiencia.",4,2017,01,18
45,Espectacular,"Increíble decoración, servicio, habitaciones... un ambiente muy acogedor y familiar pero con todo el lujo y servicios. Muy recomendable el restaurante, vale la pena la experiencia, sobretodo por la calidad de la comida.",5,2017,01,08
45,Espectacular ,"Reservamos una oferta de una noche en el hotel , en la suite con terraza, que incluía visita al spa cena y desayuno Gourmet. El hotel sencilllamente espectacular, una maravilla el trato , la habitacion, la terraza... todo. Visitamos el spa que aunque es pequeño sirve para relajarse un rato . Por la noche fuimos a cenar y cumplió las expectativas. Dos estrellas michelin muy merecidas. Todos los platos espectaculares. En especial la viera, la lubina, el huevo de codorniz etc... brutales . No falló nada en ningún momento de la cena. El detalle de subir a las habitaciones entrando por La Cocina y viendo a toda la gente cocinando también nos encanto. También vimos a Jordi cruz. Al día siguiente nos trajeron el desayuno a la habitación y lo tomamos en la terraza en un día espectacular. Solo puedo daros la enhorabuena porque estos sitios ya sabes que son caros pero lo hemos pagado todo con mucho gusto ",5,2017,01,04
45,Maravillosa Experiencia para Repetir,"Estuvimos durante una noche, en habitación con terraza. Mucha comodidad y lujo en la habitación y una terraza para perderse soñando, Si podemos, repetiremos.

Encantados",5,2017,01,04
45,Una experiencia soñada!,"Alojar en el ABaC y cenar en su premiado restaurant es una experiencia que hay que vivir al menos una vez en la vida. La atención está orientada al detalle y a hacer sentir que uno está en casa. Partiendo por la casona en sí, y luego llegando a la habitación, todo es bonito y cuidado. En la habitación me esperaba un saludo adelantado por mi cumpleaños que me alegró muchísimo.
Difícil expresar con palabras lo que fue la cena esa noche. Creo que lo que mejor la describe es ""experiencia"" porque no es sólo comer, es descubrir nuevos sabores, texturas, colores.
Espero volver!",5,2016,12,18
45,Increible!,"Me alojé en una suite que pedí para celebrar mi noche de bodas así como las fotos previas con el fotógrafo. Para elegir la suite el hotel con mucha amabilidad nos enseñó las que tenía disponibles. Nada más llegar me trataron fenomenal, fueron muy cuidadosos con los detalles y atentos a lo que necesitábamos. A todo ello tengo que añadir que la habitación estaba genial y el desayuno del día siguiente delicioso. Sin duda repetiremos. Gracias a todo el equipo del Hotel Abac.",5,2016,12,16

45,El paraíso en Bcn,"No tengo palabras para describir este fantástico hotel situado en la parte noble de Barcelona. Ya solo llegar te das cuenta del lujo y confort q tiene el lugar: acceso directo del parking a la recepción, maravillosa bienvenida por parte del personal y copas de cava y fruta como detalle. 
La habitación era un paraíso: la cama más cómoda donde he dormido, gran vestidor, baño con una ducha y una bañera de hidromasaje espectacular... No se puede pedir más... Aún así los espejos q la rodean, la gran tv de plasma y lo moderno de los controles terminan de darle el toque de lujo y modernidad que a mí me gusta.
Su restaurante es el complemento perfecto para este maravilloso hotel. La experiencia gastronómica q allí te ofrecen es espectacular: un cuidado menú con platos originales y de exquisitos sabores, vinos q ofrecen el maridaje perfecto y un personal experimentado y muy atento son sus puntos fuertes. 
Tienen cuidado hasta el más mínimo detalle y eso es de agradecer. 
Sin duda, recomiendo este hotel para una visita a la ciudad de Barcelona. 
Espero volver muy pronto al hotel Abac!!",5,2016,11,22

45,Dinning by Design,"Obwohl das Hotel an einem Verkehrsknotenpunkt liegt, bietet es eine Oase an Erholung. Im Inneren ist es von einem von aussen kaum vorstellbaren schönen Garten umgeben. Die Anlage ist sehr geschmackvoll, mein Zimmer war Top-Modern aber dennoch sehr stilvoll und mit einer vornehmen Eleganz versehen. Richtig zum Wohlfühlen. Wie immer in dieser Kategorie der Small Luxurary Hotels of the World kompetenter, freundlichen und in allen Belange professioneller Service. 

Einzigartig das Erlebnis im mit 2 Michelin Sternen ausgezeichnetem Restaurant. Ich habe ein 12-Gang-Menu vom Feinsten, innovativ und hervorragend komponiert genossen. Schon das Essen war die Uebernachtung und auch Reise wert.

Das einzige was mich gestört hat, aber dadurch die Leistung des Hotels nicht mit 4 Punkten schmälern möchte, ist dass das Hotel doch an einem Verkehrsknotenpunkt liegt und trotz schallisolierten Fenster der Verkehrslärm auf mich sehr störend wirkte. 
Ist man Verkehrslärm gewohnt oder darin nicht heikel, ist das eine Nebenbemerkung wert.",5,2016,10,16

45,Espectacular,"Pequeño, recogido, con amplias y espaciosas habitaciones inmaculadas y con vistas preciosas. Servicio de alta escuela y detalles de bienvenida y a lo largo de la estancia.

Excelente en mayúsculas!!! Cocina de altura para deleitar y saborear. Me quede demasiadas veces sin palabras, por esto recomiendo encarecidamente probarlo. ",5,2016,08,06
45,Fuegos artificiales ,"Cenar un menú de Abac supone una  explosión de sensaciones.
Desde los aperitivos a los postres, el maestro no deja de sorprender con una cascada de provocaciones al paladar, que van desde el helado de pepino, a las burbujas de tónica, por cierto de impactante presentación.
Espectacular el maridaje de vinos, con regalos como el tinto joven de 28 años; casi un licoroso, pero sublime, o el Rioja blanco mezcla de cinco cosechas.
Se echa en falta, para mi gusto, algún tinto más.
Cada uno de los 15 platos del menú, son una sorpresa para los paladares más entrenados, porque, no nos engañemos, cenar aquí es para personas que tengan una sensibilidad especial y un bolsillo en consonancia ",5,2016,08,04
45,EXCELENTE COMIDA,"Estuvimos el sabado comiendo y probamos el menu de 16 platos, primero queria comentar que el lugar es muy agradable, tanto el comedor como la terraza.
Lo importante , la comida, muy bien quiza algun plato no tenia esa fuerza que esperabamos (los calsots, y los postres) pero el resto genial, nos encanto la sopa de cebolla, el pato, el rodaballo , la gamba , las almejas.... pero claro clavar 16 platos al gusto de todo el mundo es imposible.
Super recomendable el restaurante.
Al final de la comida salio Jordi Cruz a saludar a la personas que estabamos comiendo, fue encantador, se fotografio con nosotros y aun hablamos un poquito con el.
Seguir asi y seguro que conseguis la tercera estrella, buen trabajo.",5,2016,06,16
45,EXCELENTE MENU GRAN ABAC,"Excelente Menú Gran Abac. Degustamos 16 platos elaborados por el Chef Jordi Cruz, a cual más delicioso. Calidad del emplatado y servicio en mesa Excelente.

45,Increible,"Fuimos para Sant Jordi y cogimos el paquete romántico el cual incluía un ramo de 5 rosas y nos prepararon la habitación con pétalos y sales de baño.

En definitiva fue una experiencia inolvidable. 
Está claro que volveremos. ",5,2016,05,21
45,Tolles SLH in Barcelona,"Das ABaC ist ein schönes, SL-Hotel am Rande Barcelonas Zentrum. Es liegt nicht zentral in der Innenstadt, aber auch nicht weit von Sehenswürdigkeiten und City entfernt. Mit der Linie L7 gegenüber vom Hotel dem Bus 22 oder Metro-Train ist man ruck zuck am Plaça Catalunya (etwa 10-15 Minuten oder etwa 20 Minuten mit dem Taxi für 10-12 Euro). 
Bar und Spa sehen ansprechend aus, haben wir aber nicht weiter besucht und Erfahrungen gesammelt. Design und Atmosphäre sind optisch sehr ansprechend und toll gestaltet - abgestimmtes Lichtkonzept. Der Garten ist eine kleine Oase und sehr gepflegt, perfekt zum Relaxen bei Getränken mit einem Buch oder das kostenfreie Internet nutzend (guter WLAN-Empfang im ganzen Hotel und Restaurant).
Gutes Frühstück à la Carte",5,2016,05,09
45,Como siempre el Abac sigue funcionando extraordinariamente.,"Lo visito todos los años, está vez por 3 días.
Sencillamente fenomenal como siempre, Cristina sigue en la dirección de una nave que navega a las mil maravillas.

45,Sentirse el protagonista,"Mi gran sueño era ir al Abac restaurant ya que soy una fanática de la cocina. Esta semana coincidiendo mis vacaciones con mi cumpleaños, mi mujer y yo nos fuimos cuatro dias a Irlanda y al volver me encontre que un hombre trajeado nos esperaba en la puerta del aeropuerto con su nombre. Me había preparado la sorpresa de pasar una noche en el Abac hotel con desayuno. A sido toda una experiencia. En todo momento estan pendientes de cada mínimo detalle. He conseguido relajarme más que con los cuatro dias en Irlanda. La luz, la decoración, el jardin, el lounge(un gintonic espectacular), el spa (me, myself and I)donde me he quitado 5 años de estress laboral. La habitación , eramos dos niños curiosos investigando y descubriendo cosas que en nuestra cotidianidad no son alcanzables.
 La gran sorpresa es que pasas por delante de la cocina para acceder a las habitaciones y formas parte, torpemente, del staff de cocineros(artistas) disfrutando del arte en vivo.
 Por la mañana un excelente desayuno donde te pueden sorprender hasta en la elaboración de un huevo.
 Agradecer a Cristina y a todo el equipo del hotel por su amabilidad y dedicación, porque gracias a que se respira profesionalidad y dedicación, yo he tenido una gran experiencia en mi vida.
Estoy segura que repetiremos.",5,2016,03,12

45,Mejor imposible,"Suelo decantarme por hoteles de pequeño formato y he de decir que Abac ha superado con creces mis expectativas. El servicio de recepción estuvo atento a todas mis necesitades con una amabilidad que aún recuerdo, la habitación a todo confort y muy luminosa, el spa con sus productos Heaven una experiencia de lo mejor y totalmente recomendables sus masajes.
En definitiva, volveré sin dudarlo.",5,2016,03,06
45,Maravillosa Experiencia,"Habíamos estado anteriormente en el Restaurante y decidimos pasar un fin de semana. Nos alojamos en una suite con terraza privada. Experiencia maravillosa, disfrutamos de una habitación llena de detalles de lujo y de la amabilidad del personal ( en especial Irene) que nos colmaron de atenciones y nos aconsejaron convenientemente. Situado en la parte alta de la ciudad se goza de gran tranquilidad tanto en el hotel como sus habitaciones. Volveremos en nuestra próxima visita.",5,2016,03,01

45,5GLujo? Dónde?,"Tuvimos la ocasión de comer en el restaurante ABaC y fue una experiencia de 10. No obstante, No puedo decir lo mismo del hotel.Desde el primer instante vimos una falta de atención impropia de un hotel GLujo.
La habitación a primera vista y si no tocas nada es bonita, pero las cosas no funcionan y las que funcionan no son funcionales.
La domótica está bien cuando las cortinas se abren o la televisión se enciende.
La ducha de lluvia es genial siempre y cuando no te encuentras con el baño inundado a la salida y tienes que andar tirando toallas por el suelo para no romperte la crisma.
La falta de coordinación del personal y su falta de experiencia en el trato para un GLujo queda patente a cada minuto. En nuestra salida no tuvimos a nadie que nos ayudara a trasladar el equipaje al parking donde teniamos el coche. Ni siquiera nos despidió nadie. Vergonzoso..
Entiendo que un GLujo es ""excelencia"" al menos cobrar, cobran ""excelencia"". Me pareció una tomadura de pelo.No lo aconsejaré como hotel. Sí como restaurante.
Creo que el GLujo no lo tiene y le sobran 2 estrellas",2,2016,02,08
45,inolvidable,"llegamos con tiempo una hora antes de la reserva y eso nos sirvió para descubrir en la planta de abajo, una sala bar todo en piedra precioso, muy acogedor y tranquilo

45,Mágico ,"Anoche vivimos una de las mejores experiencias gastronómicas que recordamos. Todo espectacular, sabores tan intensos que jamás imaginamos, show cooking y servicio muy por encima de nuestras expectativas. Greatest experience in Barcelona!",5,2015,12,16
45,casi perfecto,"Cuando vas a comer al ABaC donde se tiene una experiencia perfecta esperas que el hotel siga la misma pauta y no es así. Esto no significa que no sea un lugar increíble pero está lejos de la perfección del restaurante. Tiene unos pequeños errores que para su categoría y precio no son perdonables como por ejemplo:
•	Teníamos contratado un pack denominado gourmet que constaba de una recepción gourmet, una noche en habitación deluxe, cena gran ABaC, acceso al spa y desayuno gourmet. Pues ya en la cena preguntamos por la recepción gourmet y nos dijeron que era cava en la entrada al ABaC, cosa que no tuvimos.
•	La tele no funcionaba bien y tuvo que venir un técnico a arreglarla, eso sí, en menos de cinco minutos ya estaba arreglada.
•	Una de las cortinas tampoco abría del todo pero no resultaba molesto por lo que no llamamos para solucionarlo.
•	Te entregan una llave de acceso pero para acceder a la habitación, en el pasillo que da acceso a la misma, también hace falta la llave, por lo que el que sale de la habitación debe llevarla consigo para poder acceder a la misma. Con una llave por persona se solucionaría este inconveniente.
A parte de estos pequeños errores el resto de la experiencia es increíble.",4,2015,12,08
45,Hotel de alta calidad,"Desde la llegada al hotel, nunca te sientes, por decirlo de alguna manera, ""abandonado"", desde el primer momento, perfectamente atendido por el personal del hotel, muy amable y atento. La habitación, que decir, perfecta. Insonorizada completamente (cosa rara en otros hoteles), excelente calefacción, quizás algo fuerte, pero la puedes bajar de grados. Baño con ducha de lluvia y bañera con hidromasaje. Televisión Bang & Olufsen. Pedí hacerme un masaje y fue un acierto, la terapeuta me aconsejo y acertó con lo realizado, igualmente al resto de personal, persona sencilla, profesional, amable y atenta. El desayuno, completo, sin excesos, aunque si querías algo mas te lo ofrecen, tortillas, revueltos, etc. En fin, para lo alargarme en el comentario, una estancia excelente.",5,2015,11,27
45,"Una estancia ""casi"" perfecta","Hace aproximadamente 1 año que he sido cliente de este hotel. En la pasada ocasión me pareció una estancia perfecta. En esta ocasión ha sido ""casi"" perfecta.

Parte del personal que nos atendió fue el mismo que hace 1 año atrás. Su trato, al igual que en la pasada ocasión, fue muy atento con nosotros. Solicitamos estar alojados en la misma habitación, pues tenía un significado especial para nosotros. El hotel respetó nuestra petición, y ya tenían la habitación preparada a nuestra llegada.

Hemos visitado este hotel con el pack de Escapada Romántica, el cual incluye copa de Champagne de bienvenida, baño de sales y espuma relajante, y un Desayuno Gourmet. Al igual que en la pasada ocasión, solicitamos las copas a nuestra llegada, así como el baño. Nos lo prepararon todo en unos pocos minutos, así que sin problema.

Solicitamos la cena en la habitación: 2 raciones de pasta (rigattone salteados a la mantequilla), uno con salsa pesto y otro con salsa bolognesa. Lamentablemente, la ""teja crujiente de queso Parmesano Reggiano"" no parecia ser una ""teja"" sino queso por encima. En la pasada ocasión, esta presentación nos gustó mucho más.

En relación al Desayuno Gourmet (compuesto por: te o café, zumo de naranja natural, huevos, bollería, fruta, salchichas, bocadillos, Actimel y yogur), el Hotel se olvidó de traernos las salchichas y el Actimel. Solicitamos ambos productos a recepción: las salchichas llegaron sin problema alguno, y el Actimel resultó ser un Danacol.

En general, muy buena experiencia (salvo los pequeños detalles), aunque no son un impedimento para volver a ser clientes del hotel.

Gracias por sus servicios,",5,2015,11,20
45,Impresionante,Celebramos el cumpleaños de una amiga y pudimos disfrutar de un fin de semana en un hotel impresionante con unas habitaciones espectaculares. En un enclave de la viudas magnífico el ABaC es un hotel con mucho encanto. El personal muy amable y con un concepto diferente del hotel típico. Una recepción personalizada. Las instalaciones del hotel cuidan hasta el más mínimo detalle. El restaurante con Jordi Cruz como chef es espectacular. ,5,2015,11,14
45,Lujo y comodidad!,"Tuve la oportunidad de visitar el hotel la semana pasada y la verdad que no me defraudó. El servicio excelente, a la hora del check in copa de cava, atención muy rapida... La habitación, moderna, muy cómoda, sin ruidos... 
El desayuno, buena calidad, y tuve la suerte de desayunar en la terraza gracias al buen tiempo del cual disfruté. 

El SPA, muy intimo y relajante, lo disfrute con mi pareja, tiene sauna, piscina de agua fria, y la caliente... me dejo totalmente relajado y desconectado de todo, algo que necesitaba. 

En definitiva, una muy buena experiencia la cual, repetiria sin dudar. Lo recomiendo abiertamente.",5,2015,11,14
45,Serata SPECIALE,"Tutto curato nel minimo dettaglio, gentilezza,  cortesia e tante golosità dall'inizio alla fine. Tutte le portate sono descritte e curare nello stile personale  dello Chef. BRAVO Jordi e tutto il suo staff. Bellissima serata in ottima compagnia.",5,2015,11,10
45,"Cuando la palabra ""lujo"" cobra un nuevo y absoluto sentido","Detalles cuidados con especial dedicación, una atención personal y exclusiva, y todo un ambiente preparado para adelantarse a tus deseos.
La habitación superior muy amplia, las chaise-longues perfectas, y toda la decoración muy suave y  delicada, de gran elegancia. Mención especial merece el baño, pensado no solo en su sentido funcional  si no como una parte activa del lujo que se busca.
Totalmente insonorizada, es un detalle que no se valora en otros hoteles por su inexistencia, pero que cuando se cuida,se aprecia realmente el gusto y el cuidado del hotel en los detalles.
El hotel cuenta con la mejor carta de servicio de habitaciones que he visto: caviar iraní, ostras, ensalada de lollo rosso, foie y carpaccio, tomates en diferentes texturas... simplemente espectacular.
Además, reservamos en el restaurante ABaC por la noche, y no fue una experiencia única, en todos los sentidos.
Reservamos también el  desayuno gourmet del hotel, y quizá fue lo único que defraudó un poco: no nos ofrecieron todo lo que presentaba la carta del desayuno, y la atención  del camarero fue solo regular...

Sin duda, un lugar especial al que hay que ir no solo una vez en la vida, si no todas las que se pueda, y así disfrutar del ambiente único que el personal crea a tu alrededor para que no quieras dejarlo nunca!

45,Relax y comida muy rica,"Un fin de semana estupendo con una cena muy copiosa y sorprendente. La habitación es muy grande y estilo moderno. El servicio maravilloso, tanto del hotel como del restaurante, son super atentos. Un gran detalle que dejen ver su cocina cuando lo desees. ",5,2015,11,03
45,HOTEL ENCANTADOR,"El hotel se encuentra fuertemente vinculado al restaurante del mismo nombre regentado por el chef Jordi Cruz, con dos estrellas michelin.

Se trata de un pequeño hotel con gran encanto, situado en la zona norte de la ciudad de Barcelona. 

Nos alojamos en una habitación standart, que destaca por la comodidad y amplitud de la cama y la luminosidad, a lo que ayuda los colores claros de la habitación.

La habitación está llena de detalles de lujo que te hace sentirte casi mejor que en tu casa. También destaca por la calidad de los productos (amenities) del baño.

El personal muy atento y servicial, pendiente de cualquier detalle para hacerte la estancia más agradable. El trato es muy personal, a lo que ayuda las pocas habitaciones existentes en el hotel.

Las zonas comunes lo forman esencialmente los dos comedores, ambos con gran encanto, una terraza y un jardín muy acogedor situado en el centro. Naturalmente, la estancia se debe completar con el disfrute (nunca mejor dicho) de un menú degustación.  Es una mezcla de sabores, olores y presentación excepcional que no te puede dejar indiferente, y que termina con una sobremesa en la que amablemente te invitan a pasar a la terraza del jardín para seguir disfrutando de las instalaciones del hotel.

Por último, destacar el desayuno, que se sirve en la mesa con la misma profesionalidad que el servicio del restaurante, aunque, según mi parecer, con unos productos no tan especiales, a excepción de los huevos revueltos, que si llevaban el sello de la casa. 

En definitiva, un pequeño lujo que se debe disfrutar (al menos) una vez en la vida. Es un lugar que no dejará indiferente a nadie.",5,2015,11,01
45,un hotel unico,"Es un hotel con mucho encanto en la bonita ciudad de Barcelona. La ubicación es perfecta porque esta en la misma ciudad pero lo suficientemente protegida/aislada para dar la sensación de paz tan reconfortante que transmite. En el momento en que accedes al hotel ya todo es agradable con la recepción del personal amable y correcto. La decoración, tanto del hotel en general como la de las habitaciones es moderna y agradable, con mucho gusto. Lo mejor la gran cama con las sabanas tan suaves...la ducha...la televisión...es que todo ha sido elegido con mucho gusto!! es como un sueño y un pequeño oasis de la ciudad. Enhorabuena!!   ",5,2015,11,01
45,Un lugar espectacular,"Desde el mismo momento de nuestra llegada la hospitalidad estuvo presente. Una amabilidad muy familiar.
El espacio, las comodidades, la cena... todo gira permitiendo una completa relajación, pensando únicamente en disfrutar.
La paciencia que tuvieron con algunos de nuestros cambios de horario también facilitó que todo nos resultara perfecto y que solo tenga palabras de agradecimiento. 
Sin lugar a dudas un maravilloso lugar donde regresar una y otra vez.

45,Extraordinaria experiencia gastronómica,"Fui a Barcelona expresamente a conocer este restaurante y reservé la cena (menú degustación largo con maridaje), una noche de hotel y desayuno. Fue la mejor experiencia gastronómica de mi vida y he estado en varios restaurantes con estrellas. La cena resultó perfecta, ni una pega, ni la elaboración, ni los productos, ni el servicio, ni la sala... todo en un ambiente elegante, sofisticado pero sin abrumar, sin ostentación. El desayuno cálido, agradable  y con una atención en mesa como no he conocido. En definitiva,  quienes disfruten de la comida no se lo pueden perder. ",4,2015,10,26

45,Sencillamente genial!,"Hemos ido a pasar este fin de semana a Barcelona y hemos estado 2 días hospedados en el hotel. Es un hotel pequeño y acogedor en una excelente ubicación de la ciudad. 
La habitación impecable y con todos los detalles cuidados (Deluxe). La cama inmejorable y super cómoda. Una terraza enorme y muy bien amueblada. Un hotel casi diría que familiar e íntimo, en el que casi no ves ni oyes al resto de huéspedes salvo que hagas por verlos.
El trato super agradable. Nada más entrar te hacen un ""tour"" para enseñarte las instalaciones. Todo el personal muy amable y accesible (incluyendo aquí al chef del restaurante Jordi Cruz que incluso nos firmó un autógrafo para nuestra hija, fan del programa de cocina en que participa).
Una cosa muy sorprendente es que una de las opciones para ir de las habitaciones a la recepción es atravesar la cocina. La verdad es que es impresionante que la cocina de un restaurante que tiene 2 estrellas michelin se muestre tan cercana y accesible al público. Un lujo y un placer! (hay que decir que hay otras opciones para ir a la recepción si se prefiere). 
Qué decir del restaurante... Cenamos una noche, el menú Gran Abac: todo un espectáculo de 16 platos para los sentidos; el gusto, el olfato, la vista e incluso el tacto. Está claro que los sabores son impresionantes, las diferentes técnicas, combinaciones y sabores que no sabías ni que existían. Además, una puesta en escena muy original, con platos que se ultiman en la propia mesa del cliente. Antes de que empiece el espectáculo (la cena en este caso) no sabes que te van a servir (sólo te preguntan por alergias, intolerancias o cosas que no te gusten o no quieras que te sirvan) con lo cuál se juega también con el ""factor sorpresa"" que es muy agradable para los que nos gusta comer bien, de todo, probar cosas nuevas... En fin, que yo creo que la tercera estrella no debe estar lejos! Finalmente el chef salió a saludar a los comensales, lástima que nosotros estábamos ya en la terraza tomando el café y no pudimos saludarle y felicitarle en ese momento. El personal durante la cena te va explicando cada plato con todo detalle, muy atentos y cercanos.
El desayuno gourmet también exquisito, merece la pena probar el huevo a baja temperatura.
Del precio no voy a hablar. Me parece justo para lo que estás consumiendo.
En fin, una gran experiencia que, si Dios quiere, seguro que repetiremos!",5,2015,10,12
45,Sorprendente,"Ha sido mi primera experiencia con el ABaC, disfrutamos de 16 extraordinarias obras de arte servidas con mucho mimo.

Il bagno è moderno e di design, si trovano i prodotti di terre d'hermes, vasca idromassaggio con cromoterapia e doccia spaziosa con soffione a pioggia...bellissimo!! Si può accedere alla spa molto carina ed elegante. Il ristorante è qualcosa di magnifico, chef stellato, cena che lascia senza fiato, piatti che oltre ad offrire la qualità sono dei capolavori...spettacolare!!!

45,Aniversario inolvidable,"Desde el momento que entramos se respira relax y placer, parece que estés entrando a tu casa. 
Nos cuidaron como a su familia, desde la chica de recepción hasta nuestro ya amigo camarero de nuestra cena inolvidable y finalizando con nuestra ""mami"" en el desayuno. VOLVEREMOS! 

Nos encantó e",5,2015,09,21
45,muy contentos con la estancia,"Recepcion muy buena, calidad en las habitaciones, ducha y zona de baños muy buena, el spa cuidado y limpio. En general de los hoteles de barcelona de lo mejor que hemos estado. Ademas el tour que te hacen por el hotel es espectacular.",5,2015,09,13
45,Una experiencia sublime,"Mi pareja y yo pudimos disfrutar de un Pack Gourmet como regalo de aniversario por parte de mi pareja. No voy a poder añadir más comentarios positivos de los que se pueden leer en otros post ya que el hotel es acorde a su categoría de 5 estrellas gran lujo. Un hotel que destaca por su confort y exquisitez. Todas las instalaciones del hotel son increíbles, un pequeño spa que pudimos disfrutar al estar absolutamente solos, los jardines en los que pudimos degustar de una copa de cava de bienvenida.

Pero lo que sin duda debo destacar es el trato y la amabilidad del personal. Tuvimos la gran suerte de ser obsequiados por un gran detalle cómo fue ofrecernos alojarnos en una de sus suites con terraza. Que se puede decir de tener la oportunidad de vivir una experiencia de este tipo, no tengo palabras para mostrar nuestro agradecimiento. Mi pareja y yo disfrutamos de una celebración de aniversario mágica  y que jamos olvidaremos.

Moltissimes gràcies per tot!",5,2015,09,08
45,EXQUISITO,"Mi primera impresión, al ver el exterior del hotel, fue muy buena pero al entrar al hotel esa primera impresión fue todavía mejor. El trato del personal (desde el primero hasta el último)  es encomiable. La cocina es realmente espectacular y especial. Las habitaciones están insonorizadas y ésto es un gran acierto. Por mi parte lo recomendaría y en un futuro volveré a ir ya que la estancia fue breve pero intensa. 
Grandes profesionales¡¡¡¡
Gracias¡¡¡¡¡",5,2015,09,07
45,Guau,"El hotel se encuentra no muy céntrico, pero sí en una zona muy señorial de la ciudad y con fácil acceso en coche a cualquier lugar.

Aunque esté delante de una calle, nuestra suite era muy tranquila y sin ruidos, bien aislada y con una decoración cuidada al detalle.

Al principio el personal me pareció frío o distante, pero después de la segunda noche, entendí que era amable y dispuesto, sin querer pasarse...muy bien!

Del restaurante, ni hablemos...otro nivel.",5,2015,08,25
45,Un sueño. Un placer.,"El mejor hotel de Bcn. El servicio, las instalaciones, el restaurante y el SPA son un sueño hecho realidad. Hotel con encanto donde la excelencia y el lujo son su buque insignia. Lo recomiendo!!!!!!!!

45,"Excepcional experiencia, tanto el hotel como el restaurante. Es un lugar perfecto y altamente recomendable.","Sin duda es uno de esos lugares que conviene visitar de vez en cuando. Todo es armonía y es una experiencia que merece mucho la pena. El hotel es maravilloso y el restaurante, además de su calidad, esta llevado por personas que te hacen especialmente agradable la cena. Mi enhorabuena a todo el equipo y gracias. ",5,2015,08,14
45,Lujo en cada rincon,"Me acabo de ir y ya estoy deseando volver. Es un hotel en el que estes donde estes se respira tranquilidad y lujo. Consigue que llegues a un estado de relajacion absoluta.

Las instalaciones del hotel son increibles, probamos el spa, aunque es pequeño es perfecto porque estabamos solos y ademas tienes a tu disposicion gran variedad de bebidas para disfrutar durante el spa.

La habitacion es perfecta, la cama es grande y muy comoda, la decoracion es increible y todo controlado de forma domitica. Estuvimos en la habitacion con terraza, muy recomendada, pero lastima que lloviese y no la pudisesemos disfrutar del todo.

No disfrutamos del restaurante, aunque la experiencia de poder pasar a traves de la cocina y ver como trabajan y poder ver al chef Jordi Cruz es espectacular. Lo que si hicimos es disfrutar del desayuno gourmet, muy rico y abundante, ademas Pilar te atiende de forma muy simpatica, es encantadora.

Por ultimo, si vais en pareja como yo recomiendo que os cojais el paquete romantico, en el que ademas de incluir el desayuno incluye un baño de rosas y sales de baño y una copa de champan con oro.

Increible hotel.",5,2015,08,09
45,Nivel de confort y exquisitez de las habitaciones muy elevado,"Las habitaciones destacan por su confort y exquisitez: tanto por su estado y decoración, como por los detalles que marcan la diferencia:ropa de cama, productos de baño..
Tranquilidad y lugar con encanto en la ciudad.Trato correcto.",4,2015,08,04
45,Una experiencia fascinante,"Sin ningún genero de dudas mi experiencia en el Abac se puede calificar de excelente.
Desde que llegamos todo fuerón detalles y atenciones.
Las habitaciones magnificas, sobre todo las camas tipo americano, grandes y mullidas, nada frecuentes en los hoteles españoles, el spá una coquetería y exquisito el desayuno.
El personal un encanto y el menú de 18 platos con sus correspondientes maridajes fué una autentica delicia, nos sorprendió que el tiempo de espera entre cada plato resultó inexistente, un servicio cuidado al milimetro.
Ver la elaboración de muchos de ellos en la propia mesa fué elgo espectacular.
Nos encantarón sobre todo los platos de pescado y marisco que por cierto fueron la mayoría.
Al final de la comida muy buén detalle de el chef Jordi Cruz, pasó por todas las mesas interesandodese por como había resultado todo, encantador y siempre dispuesto a fotografiarse con el que lo pidiera.
Y para finalizar el copioso almuerzo nada mejor que una reconfortante siesta en las magnificas habitaciones con las que cuenta el establecimiento.
Una experiencia para recordar. 
Sin duda este establecimiento merece las estrellas Michelín y demás galardones con los que cuenta.
Atentamente.
Ramón.",5,2015,08,03
45,UN HOTEL EN EL QUE TODO ES AGRADABLEMENTE DIFERENTE,"Cierto, cuando entras, te despistan tantos pasadizos, ascensores y escaleras. No menos cierto, a la media hora, te diviertes como un niño jugando al escondite y descubrir, al abrir una puerta, si has encontrado la salida que buscabas. Al fin, en la Recepción. Nada de barras largas y  mugrientas. La mesa de un despacho, limpia, funcional.La oficina de un directivo. Una silla en la que descansar mientras bebes un sorbo del agua que acaban de ofrecerte: el mejor tónico para restablecerte del viaje. Formalidades legales de rutina. Un paseo por las instalaciones, incluida la cocina, que deseabas ver ¿cómo no?. La visita finaliza en tu habitación, donde ya se encuentran tus maletas. Sensación de familiaridad. Tanto que caí en la tentación de coger el cuadernillo de notas y apuntar los detalles que hasta ahora no había encontrado en hotel alguno: cama matrimonial tipo king, nada de nombres del hotel en las sábanas, porque es tu casa por el tiempo que residas en ella,. Sábanas amplias,holor a limpoio,  un edredón de la más alta calidad de plumón. Dos amplios ventanales que inundan de luz la habitación (perdón, tu salón de estar).  No te  preocupes por tirar y tirar y no terminar de eliminar por completo la luz que pueda despertarte por la mañana. Aquí todo es mecánico y con mando a distancia. Muebles de diseño nórdico ( los conozco bien y sé lo que significan). Para muestra un botón: todo un equipo de música Bang & Olufsen. Abres los armarios y son de doble bisagra: sus puertas se abren hasta formar parte de la pared, dejándote todo el espacio para colocar y elegir; no se necesita el codo para retener esa molesta hoja de armario que, en todo hotel, te incomoda en el momento de colocar o elegir la ropa que has elegido para el momento. Tras la habitación viene el cuarto de baño. Sin duda  lo que mejor define la calidad de un hotel. No hay nada que me moleste más que esos cubos  colocados debajo de los lavabos para echar, por ejemplo, las cápsulas de las pastillas que el médico te ha prescrito; nunca se cierran debido al plástico que agarrota su pedal.  No lo busques aquí: sólo verás una ranura  en un mueble para depositar ""la carta"" que envías al reciclaje.Si eres de los que lees en el ""trono"", te sentirás como un ""rey"": colocado en un compartimento separado del resto del lavabo y de la ducha, y con una luz led auxiliar, a la altura de tus hombros, sujeta a un brazo flexible, que permite acomodarla a tu capricho. La ducha , en compartimento a parte, te da la sensación de  estar bajo una cascada: el diseño del suelo vierte el agua por los laterales sin que tengas que pisar sumideros que desaguan con dificultad (lo mismo que hicieron con quien te precedió). Otro tanto sucede con los lavabos. Querido amigo que hayas llegado leyendo hasta aquí, espero que la carcoma de la curiosidad  no deje de roerte hasta descubrir por tí mismo estas y otras excelencias que convierten a este hotel en único.¡Sólo una vez en la vida!. Lo merece, y si, además, es el regalo de Reyes de tus hijos, lo disfrutarás doblemente. Uno espera encontrar excelencia, pero no tanta.",5,2015,07,31
45,Excelente,"Celebramos nuestro aniversario de boda y cumpleaños de mi mujer,, fue la mejor experiencia de nuestros aniversarios ,,, normalmente nos gusta celebrarlo con buena gastronomia y buenos hoteles ,,,  y esta a sido la mejor con diferencia ,,, repiteremos.

45,Un hotel único!!! ,"Es la segunda vez q visitamis el hotel. Quién dijo q segundas partes nunca fueron buenas? Pues pueden ser mejores!!! La habitación es moderna, amplia y con dimótica. Hay eifi super correcta. La cama es super cómoda y las almohadas muy cómidas. Pero lo mejor, lo mejor, los desayunos de Pilar: estratosféricos!!!!! Bollería de calidad, fruta fresca, bocadillitos riquísimos, zumo de naranja recién exprimido, salsichas en salsa d ternera ( buenisimas!!!!) y huevos a baja temperatura. Todo con el cariño y mimo de la casa y de Pilar. El barrio es tranquilo y elegante, residencial, lleno de bonitas casas. El hotel tiene un restaurante con dos estrellas q probamos la primera vez. Esta vez fuimos al Ten's, en el Born, tapas d autor del mismo Jordi Cruz. Extraordinario!!!",5,2015,07,13
45,BRUTAL!,"Cuando todo es perfecto no se puede pedir más!!! El precio alto... pero como regalo/escapada alucinante!! Cualquier necesidad que tengan se la aclararán!!! Disfruten del desayuno en la terraza, en el servicio de desayuno nos atendió una mujer maravillosa!!

45,Una experiencia única!,"Desde el primer momento en que entras en el hotel, todo el personal es amable, atento y con gran profesionalidad. Se nota el buen gusto y el gran diseño en cada esquina, desde las habitaciones hasta el restaurante y la zona del jardín. Mención especial a todo el staff por hacer de la cena una experiencia única. No sólo la comida es de una calidad excelente sino que la presentación de cada uno de los platos y los vinos es única e innovadora. Para rematarlo, las habitaciones son todo un lujo, con camas muy cómodas, amplios sofás y grandes televisiones. Y todo cuidado y limpio hasta el más mínimo detalle!",5,2015,06,15

45,Increíble experiencia,"Hace unos días celebramos en ABaC nuestros 10 años de casados. La experiencia fue increíble. Desde la llegada la atención fue exquisita, el hotel espectacular. Pero lo mejor fue disfrutar del menú Gran ABaC par cenar: una delicia para los sentidos, nuestra mejor experiencia gastronómica hasta la fecha, complementada con un trato perfecto, visita a las cocinas y la posibilidad de saludar al chef Jordi Cruz.
Totalmente recomendable.
Begoña y Javi",5,2015,06,05
45,Sencillamente magnífico !,"Gracias a la dirección del hotel, Cristina es la culpable, puedes disfrutar de un hotel magnífico, en el amplio sentido. Enumerar el trato, las instalaciones, la tranquilidad, la discrección, la elegancia en fin algo especial...
El restaurante en manos de Jordi, insuperable, pero como es superconocido no haré más alardes, su cocina muy atrevida y de altísima calidad, sus estrellas son merecidísimas...
No me canso de repetir, cada vez que visito Barcelona visito el Abac, creo que es lo mejor que se puede decir de un sitio.
Por otro lado destacar a  Pilar en el desayuno amable y de magnífico trato, al igual que las chicas de recepción, lamento haber olvidado su nombre, son educadas, correctas y grandes profesionales, como debe ser.
Resumiendo, magnifico lugar, tranquilo y discreto y sobre todo su personal, seguir así...",5,2015,06,04
45,Sublime,"Habíamos reservado mesa a las 14.00 y llegamos a las 15.00 (avisamos del retraso), el trato recibido supero nuestras expectativas y la comida resulto sorprendente, una vez en la habitación te sientes muy confortable y puedes apreciar que todo se cuida al detalle, es un sitio para quedarse. ",5,2015,05,25
45,Oase in der City,"Das ABaC habe ich mir als letzte Übernachtung in Barcelona gebucht. Es liegt nicht zentral aber auch nicht weit von allen Sehenswürdigkeiten entfernt. Mit der Linie L7 gegenüber vom Hotel oder dem Bus 22 ist man ruck zuck am Plaça Catalunya. Bereits beim Betreten des Hotels ist erstmals WOW angesagt. Eine wirkliche TOP Location......sozusagen ein Hideaway im Verbund von Small Luxury Hotels.
Als SLH Club Member bekamen wir ein kostenfreies doppeltes upgrade in das Deluxe Zimmer 826. Ein schöner Ausblick in den ruhigen Innenhof und recht kurzen Wegen innerhalb des Hotels. Die Bar ist wirklich ein optischer Leckerbissen mit schönen Lichtspielen. Und mit Abstand der beste Sangria, noch vor dem Le Meridien wenn auch ohne Nüsse. Das Reklamationshandling war perfekt und einfühlsam, und am nächsten Tag war alles zur vollsten Zufriedenheit. Besonders das Frühstück a la Carte war schön angerichtet und sehr gut von der Qualität. Wenn auch der Nespresso Hype nicht mein Fall ist, und ich mehr Illy Qualität in einer richtigen Italienischen Maschine bevorzuge, war es in Ordnung. Für den nächsten Aufenthalt könnte ich ja eine mitbringen.....Scherz!
Auch ein Blick in die Küche ist nett, die Crew beim Handling mit den Speisen zu beobachten.
Das I Tüpfelchen, ist einfach der Garten als Oase in der City. Perfekt zum Relaxen und bei Getränken ein Buch oder das kostenfreie Internet zum surfen nutzen. Fast vergessen, die wahre Perle ist die Reinigungskraft welche für das Housekeeping und für das komplette Hotel Areal zuständig ist. Immer mit guter Laune bewaffnet und fleissig unter Dauerstrom. Kein Staubkorn oder Blatt vor dem Hotel bleibt unentdeckt. Hut ab.....ich hoffe das Management weiß es zu schätzen!
Eine klare Empfehlung und mit Sicherheit das beste SLH der Stadt.
Herzlichen Dank",5,2015,04,30
45,Uno de mis favoritos ,"Hemos estado en varias ocasiones, el hotel es muy bonito y acogedor, el trato excelente y familiar, te hacen sentir muy agusto y la suite de las mas bonitas y acogedoras que he estado, cenamos en el Restaurante y la cocina de Jordi Cruz, fue espectacular ,volveremos siempre que estemos en Barcelona, un hotel a recomendar.",5,2015,04,17
45,Un hotel y entorno exclusivo,El hotel se encuentra en una zona exclusiva de Barcelona con buenas conexiones al centro de la ciudad. La habitación es muy cómoda y grande y al haber pocas habitaciones el ambiente es muy relajante. El servicio además muy atento y servicial. Comimos muy bien en el restaurante y fue un privilegio poder entrar en la cocina y conocer al chef. El Spa es pequeño pero agradable.,5,2015,04,07
45,Mejor Hotel de Barcelona,"Estuvimos dos días en el Hotel Abac.Puedo recomendarlo sin dudarlo, ya que hemos estado en muchos hoteles de Barcelona. Es sorprendente encontrar hoy en día, un 5*G.L. que corresponda a esta categoría. El diseño moderno del Hotel y la arquitectura cuidada, acompañan al interiorismo. Sólo llegar se llevaron las maletas y nos enseñaron el Hotel y sus instalaciones. El personal fue muy atento y detallista en todo momento, y el servicio de habitaciones muy rápido. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y con mucha luz natural. La insonorización con la calle y con el resto de las habitaciones es excelente, no se oye absolutamente nada. Las camas, las almohadas y la ropa de cama, son de calidad máxima, el descanso está asegurado. La limpieza de las habitaciones es perfecta (mesitas de noche, cristaleras, suelos...) La televisión es de gran tamaño y el equipo de audio óptimo. Los baños amplios, disponen de ducha y bañera y las amenities de Hermés son abundantes. En las habitaciones hay un olor fresco muy agradable. El desayuno espectacular: la bollería, el zumo de naranja, la macedonia...todo de primera calidad.La terraza y el jardín en pleno centro de la ciudad es un tesoro! Hay un Spa espectacular que por falta de tiempo no pudimos utilizar. Sólo tengo buenos recuerdos de una estancia tan perfecta!da gusto ir a un Hotel y que te traten con tanta amabilidad y con una sonrisa siempre. Nos quedamos con ganas de volver y poder disfrutar de una gran cena en el Restaurante (coincidimos con Jordi Cruz un par de veces, encantador) y de probar el Spa. Lo recomendamos absolutamente si quieres acertar al 100%.",5,2015,04,02
45,Increible experiencia,"Experiencia más que recomendable. El hotel es espectacular, la habitación sumamente confortable y el trato recibido por el personal maravilloso. Es un sitio tranquilo y relajante. A destacar también la zona de spa y sin duda, la comida, deliciosa y de magnífica calidad.",5,2015,04,02
45,Muy cómoda estancia,"Nos encantó el diseño exquisito y funcional de todo el hotel. Un ambiente muy agradable, servicio muy eficiente, amable y dedicado. El hotel dispone de un Spa donde pudimos relajarnos tranquilamente rodeados de un ambiente ideal. Y fue un privilegio ver la cocina del AbAC por dentro! Muy recomendable también el desayuno.",5,2015,03,30
45,Pequeño Gran Hotel,"Pasamos una noche con mi pareja. La habitación con una terraza muy grande, cama comodisima, wc con todo lo necesario, poca luz en el baño ,eso sí.  Servicio de desayuno en la habitación magnífico, lástima del mal tiempo.   Muy tranquilo, el servicio de 10 en todos sus campos, recepción, restaurante, habitaciones, etc... Para poner algún ""pero"", en el Spa no funcionaban los jets hidromasaje, los masajes quizá un poco caros , comparado con por ejemplo el Hermitage de Soldeu, y allí eran de mejor calidad.  Pero , cómo digo, todo en general estupendo, sin duda es un hotel para repetir.",5,2015,03,22
45,Sencillament...espléndido!!,"Fue un regalo de cumpleaños para mi marido y, de verdad, os lo recomiendo a todos. El lugar es bonito y elegante, la cena espectacular y el trato exquisito.
Desde que llegamos todo el personal nos trató genial, pero sin excepción, haciéndonos sentir a gusto en todo momento: la gente del hotel, los camareros, el somelier...y el chef!!! Por la mañana, la señora que nos trajo el desayuno le cantó el cumpleaños feliz a mi marido...un encanto!!
La habitación donde nos alojamos era muy bonita y con todas las comodidades y el SPA ideal para relajarse. 

Si estais buscando un hotel para pasar un/unos día/días fantásticos no lo dudeis, venir a l'ABAC.",5,2015,03,16
45,Espectacular,Se siente uno en su casa tanto el trato de todo el personal del hotel y la suite del ático es un  paraiso y como es mi segunda vez y como se dice que no hay 2 sin 3 en abril volvemos a celebrar mi cumpleaños ,5,2015,03,01
45,"Simplemente, perfecto","Regalé a mi esposa Gemma, un paquete gourmet para pasar una noche en este increíble espacio de Barcelona.
Desde el primer momento el trato fué exquisito.Las instalaciones espectaculares, funcionales, pero con muchísimo gusto. El hecho de tener que atravesar la cocina para acceder al ascensor de las habitaciones, aún redondea más la experiencia. Ver a Jordi Cruz y su equipo concentrados en su trabajo nos dejó boquiabiertos.
En la habitación (Deluxe) todo estaba perfectamente orquestado y cuidado.Desde los jabones (de una prestigiosa marca francesa), hasta la lencería, y sobre todo, la luminosidad y las increíbles vistas sobre las montañas que rodean a Barcelona. La cama.....sin palabras....la noche se hace corta!!!
Llegó el momento especial que esperábamos a las 8 y media empezamos a cenar. No quiero entrar en los detalles culinarios, que son acordes a la categoría del sitio y que sorprenden plato a plato, sino destacar al personal de la sala. El trato fue excelente, profesional, cercano en su justa medida, y te hacen sentir como en tu casa. Se agradeció mucho la conversación que tuvimos con Ladislao sobre el funcionamiento del restaurante, mientras tomábamos la última copa en la terraza. también nos facilitó el acceso a la cocina para saludar a Jordi Cruz, que en todo momento fue encantador y amable, a pesar de que, imagino, el peso de la fama , a veces tiene que ser difícil de soportar. 
Impagables, las bromas con Jordi y Ladislao, sobre quienes son más importantes, los cocineros o el personal de la sala.....nosotros tenemos la respuesta ...TODOS!!!

Muchas gracias por hacernos sentir tan bien durante estos dos días. Esperamos verles pronto de nuevo!",5,2015,02,21
45,Mucho más que perfecto,"No tengo palabras para describir el fin de semana que hemos pasado en ABaC. 
A los 2 minutos de haber llegado, Cristina y su equipo del Hotel ya nos habían ganado. Su trato fue más que excepcional y nuestra estancia en el hotel, inmejorable. El hotel es pequeño y tranquilo y la habitación (estuvimos en una Deluxe) está equipada con todo y más: productos de belleza de calidad, secador, cafetera Nespresso... 
El Spa es pequeñito pero perfecto para relajarse y desconectar y si como yo, tenéis la suerte de poder haceros un tratamiento de belleza... ¡es lo más! Montse es encantadora y los productos que utiliza y sus consejos son inmejorables.
Si ya estábamos encantados con nuestro día en el Hotel, la guinda final fue la cena: ESPECTACULAR! Jordi es un artista en potenciar los sabores de los platos y disfrutamos como nunca.
A la mañana siguiente, disfrutamos de un desayuno gourmet con vistas al jardín que acabó de hacer redondo el fin de semana.
Acabamos de ir pero ya estamos buscando fin de semana para repetir con unos amigos!",5,2015,02,16
45,Experiencia gourmet inmejorable,"Regalé a mi pareja la experiencia gourmet para su cumpleaños y fue un acierto. El hotel tiene pocas habitaciones lo que les permite un trato personalizado y mucha atención. Nos alojamos en la habitación Superior y mejor incluso que en las fotos. Todo estaba cuidado a la perfección. Por la tarde estubimos un rato en el Spa, no es muy grande, pero tubimos la suerte de disfrutarlo solos. La bañera de hidromasaje y la ducha de la habitacion, muy bien. 
La cena, tomamos el menu Gran Abac, sin palabras, Jordi Cruz es un gran chef y las dos estrellas merecidisimas, un 10 la atención de nuestros camareros.
A la mañana disfrutamos del desayuno en la terraza de la habitación, que es muy espaciosa, un final redondo para nuestra estancia.
Repetiremos sin duda.",5,2015,02,15
45,Mejor que bueno,"Fue una escapada en pareja, con la idea de combinar una experiencia gastronómica con el descanso en un hotel tranquilo y con una atención cercana. El resultado ha sido mejor incluso del que imaginábamos. Un servicio muy amable y discreto al tiempo, una experiencia tanto en el restaurante como en el desayuno fantásticos, y un nivel de confort en la habitación y spa que nos permitió descansar y quedarnos con ganas de una estancia más prolongada.",5,2015,02,05
45,Fantastico,"Han superado mis expectativas!!! Y mira que eran altas!!!  La cena con el Menu de Degustación, insuperable. La habitación, llena de tecnologia, magnífica. El desayuno super Bueno, y el personal muy amable. Sin duda nos quedamos con ganas de volver.",5,2015,02,03
45,No encuentro la palabra para definirlo...... PERFECTO,"He estado es muchos hoteles de 5 estrellas y al final en todos acabas siendo uno más, un número.... bien tratados sin duda, pero el Hotel ABAC es totalmente diferente. Fuí a celebrar mi 30 aniversario de boda. El hecho de ser un hotel de sólo 15 habitaciones (hotel-boutique) permite que te den una atención muy personalizada que sumado al conjunto del edificio hace que lo considere el MEJOR HOTEL DE BARCELONA. Aunque creo que mi habitación era de las más sencillas, no quiero ni pensar como deben ser las suites....!!!!! Adjunto algunas fotos de la mia, perfecta sin duda. Me encantó que al llegar te enseñen todo el hotel a la vez que vas degustando una copa de cava, nunca antes me había pasado.... la cocina a tope de cocineros, el spa maravilloso, el entorno.... todo una pasada. No pude ir al spa porqué me resfrié y eso me hizo no acabar de disfrutar al completo el hotel. Usamos el servicio de habitaciones y fué perfecto. La Comida en el Abac Restaurant, SIN PALABRAS y el menú Gran Abad con maridaje, lo mejor de lo mejor. Jordi Cruz, encantador y Pilar del desayuno una maravilla, profesional, atenta.... un 10. No tengo nada negativo del hotel, la pena es no poder ir más a menudo, es caro pero lo vale !!!!!",5,2015,01,30
45,Gratamente contento,"Mi novia y yo estuvimos el fin de semana pasado y la experiencia fue bastante buena pero el servicio por lo que sea nos dejo un sabor agrio que no malo, seria por lo que fuera pero no esperábamos ese trato aunque prometemos volver!!",5,2015,01,22
45,Excelencia al máximo nivel,"El hotel es de lo mejor que he visto; un oasis en una gran ciudad como Barcelona, bien comunicado, súper cómodo, el servicio fantástico; ademas del alojamiento, cenamos de lujo en su restaurante. Recomendamos el menú Gran Abac y su maridaje de vinos, maravilloso. Gran servicio en sala, sumiller de diez y equipo de cocina fantástico, con su chef Jordi Cruz, súper amable y cercano. Volveremos en cuanto podamos.",5,2015,01,19
45,Magnífico es poco!!,"El mejor regalo de mi vida. Mi pareja me regaló una noche con desayuno, pack romántico y menú gran abac. La verdad estaba muy ilusionado pero lo que me encontré supero con creces todas mis expectativas. La atención por parte del personal es increíblemente buena y atenta, nos hicieron sentir como reyes. Las instalaciones del hotel son muy, pero que muy bonitas y cuidadas hasta el último detalle. Sólo tengo palabras de agradecimiento para todos,todos los que forman parte del equipo abac. Felicidades sois unos craks. Y GRACIAS por haber hecho realidad un sueño.",5,2015,01,15

Verdaeramente una experiencia inolvidable, un cumpleaños muy especial y que seguro en otra ocasión repetiremos",5,2015,01,15
45,Experiencia inolvidable ,"Abac es un lugar muy especial. La decoración está muy cuidada y crea un ambiente que te hace sentir como en casa con un servicio de cinco estrellas. Imprescindible comer en el restaurante, el entorno, la cocina y la sala son exquisitos. Está un poco alejado del centro pero la experiencia es muy recomendable.",5,2015,01,08
45,Que les voy a contar......,"Gran experiencia, un lugar unico y especial para visitar con calma y en compañia, seria muy egoista visitarlo solo, es algo digno de compartir , sabores, sensaciones,olores , sorpresas son unas des las tantas cosas que me hicieron salir tan feliz de esta cena ......muchas gracias.",5,2015,01,07
45,Hotel de gran lujo.,"Estuvimos mi pareja y yo el fin de semana del 3-4 de enero.

Al llegar vienen a recibirte en el parking y te suben las maletas a la habitación mientras vas a la recepción,  y después te enseñan el hotel (entiendo que no en todos los hoteles se pueda hacer, este sí por ser pequeño, pero te ayuda mucho a ubicarte y no tener que “explorar”).

La habitación simplemente de 10, esa cama, esos sofás, esa bañera, esa ducha, esa tele enorme (perfecto para los hombres que deben esperar a las mujeres…). 

El spa pequeño, pero funcional y tranquilísimo. Estuvimos dos horas solos. Que paz. 

En cuanto al desayuno, me llevaba la camarera a casa. Encantadora. Y la comida extraordinaria, delicioso bocata de jamón ibérico, el huevo campesino, la bollería, etc.

Si hay que poner un pero, se lo pondría a que no hubiera una agua de cortesía en la habitación, y los precios del minibar excesivos (¿alguien normal consume con esos precios?). 

Hotel muy recomendable, eso sí, tiene su precio.",5,2015,01,05
45,Wir haben den Jahreswechsel 2014/2015 in Barcelona genossen �� ABaC Restaurant & Hotel,"ABaC Hotel

Das Hotel liegt im nördlichen Teil von Barcelona am Fusse des Tibidabo und hat fünf Sterne. Es zählt zu den SMALL LUXURY HOTELS OF THE WORLD. Ein schönes Haus, ein ehemaliger Wohnsitz der Bourgeoisie. Das Haus besitzt 15 Zimmer, die in einem neueren und einem historischen Gebäude untergebracht sind. Zudem hat es auch eine sehr charmante Gartenterasse. 24 Stunden Serviceleistungen, sowie ein Spa Angebot runden das Angebot ab. Gemäss diversen medialen Berichten beherbergt das Hotel eine der besten Gastronomien, international renommiert; das ABaC Restaurant. In der Nähe des Hotels liegen Busstationen, Taxistände und die Tramvia Blau die zum Tibidabo fährt. 

Von der Endstation der Tramvia Blau geht es das letzte Stück mit der Zahnradbahn dem Tibidabo hinauf. In den Wintermonaten fährt die Tramvia Blau nur am Freitag bis Sonntag. Aber nur wenige Meter oberhalb der Haltestelle der Tramvia Blau befindet sich eine Bushaltestelle (Linie 196), der Bus fährt das ganze Jahr über. Ab der Bergstation der Tramvia Blau muss in die Standseilbahn (Funicular) umgestiegen werden. Auch der Bus fährt bis zur Talstation der Funicular.

Mit der Metro L7 (wie geschrieben, liegt dies vor der Tür) kommt man direkt an die Plaça Catalunya. Von dort aus kann man diverse Einkaufsstrassen gut erreichen:

Der Prachtboulevard Paseo de Gracia ist die wahrscheinlich bekannteste Einkaufsstrasse Barcelonas. Sie beherbergt viele bekannte Marken und reicht vom Plaza Catalunya bis zur U Bahn Station Diagonal. In der gleichen Strasse befindet sich die Casa Mila und die Casa Batllo (berühmte Bauwerke von Gaudi).

Porta de L‘ Angel – Einkaufen im Zentrum Barcelonas. Diese Einkaufsstrasse im Zentrum von Barcelona spricht eher junge Leute, Shopaholics an – auch die Auswahl der Shops spiegelt dies wieder. 

Die Rambla, für sie wird oft auch der Plural ""Las Ramblas"" verwendet, ist eines der Wahrzeichen von Barcelona, welche diese Metropole so einzigartig macht. Die etwa 1,3 Kilometer lange Strasse - in der Mitte eine Fußgängerzone - reicht vom Plaça Catalunya, bis zum Hafen. Den Abschluss bildet die weithin sichtbare Kolumbus-Säule. Danach führt die Rambla del Mar als Verlängerung der historischen Ramblas bis zum Maremagnum, einem Einkaufszentrum im Hafen. Die Rambla gliedert sich in mehrere Abschnitte, die alle ihren eigenen Charakter haben. Sie teilt die Altstadt in das Barri Gòtic und das Barri Raval.

Wir sind mit der SWISS am 31.12.2014 in Barcelona (19:05 Uhr) gelandet und am 04.01.2015 (14:40 Uhr) abgeflogen. Wir haben unser Deluxe Zimmer direkt über die Homepage vom Hotel gebucht, inkl. Frühstück und Abhol-/Bringservice von/zum Flughafen.

Anbei die ein Auszug aus der original Buchungsbestätigung:
Room details:
1   Deluxe  (2 Adults) /  Early booking with gourmet breakfast included
Room equipment:
Air conditioning
Hermès amenities
Jacuzzi with cromotherapy
Safety box

Rain efect shower head 40x40 cm.
Sound proof room
Hairdryer
Bang Olufsen TV 32` 40` 50`

Der Abhol-/Bringservice hat gut und sehr pünktlich geklappt. Der Chauffeur war ein junger, gepflegter Mann. Das Auto war innen sehr sauber. Beim ""Abholen"" hatten wir ein Flasche Wasser zur Verfügung, beim ""Bringen"" zwei. Wir denken hier ist beim ""Abholen"" eine Flasche vergessen gegangen. Beim ""Bringen"" ist uns aufgefallen, dass man die Seitenfenster sicher etwas sauberer kriegt. Alles in Allem ist der Service empfehlenswert.

Wir hatten ein Zimmer im historischen Trackt (Zimmer 821). Wenn wir über den Haupteingang der Rezeption ins Zimmer wollten, mussten wir direkt durch die Küche. Ein mit LED-Leuchten gekennzeichneter Weg führt Gäste hindurch, ohne dass sie den Ablauf stören. Speziell, sympathisch, fast wie zu Hause, gefällt.

Der erste Eindruck ist sehr gut und wirkt familiär, wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt!

Das Zimmer hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Gute Grösse, genügend Ablageflächen und zwei Kleiderschränke. Das Badezimmer hatte eine Badewanne, eine Dusche und ein Bidet, einfach super! Beim duschen muss man jedoch Acht geben, es ist sehr rutschig und der ""Boden"" etwas unstabil! Die Wasserarmatur beim Lavabo ist schön, jedoch nicht sehr funktional. Was auch sehr gefallen hat ist die Lichttastatur, wo man direkt diverse Programme (hell, dunkel, etc.) wählen konnte. Die schweren Vorhänge für die Nacht konnten elektrisch bedient werden. Ein sehr grosses Sofa zum chillen, Platz wohin das Auge reicht. Aus dem Zimmerfenster sahen wir direkt auf den Tibidabo. Das Bett war himmlisch und wir konnten traumhaft gut schlafen. Genügend Kissen vorhanden in sehr guter Qualität (nicht zu weich und nicht zu hart). Jeden Abend hatten wir eine Süssigkeit auf den Kissen. Sauberkeit sehr gut!

Gratis WLAN im Zimmer, sehr leistungsfähig, einfach genial!

Das ganze Haus ist sehr sauber gehalten.

Optimierungspunkte:
- wir denken eine grosse Flasche Mineralwasser auf dem Zimmer sollte jeden Tag zur Verfügung stehen
- bei den zwei Schränken im Flur draussen, sollten die Schiebetüren so gerichtet sein, dass egal auf welcher Seite man ""parkiert"", alle zugänglichen Schubladen geöffnet werden können 

Frühstück: Sehr herzliche, persönliche Bedienung, gute Qualität und Quantität. Für uns das erste Mal, dass wir nicht einem Frühstücksbuffet gegen überstanden, sondern alles frisch zubereitet aus der Küche kam. Im ersten Augenblick für uns etwas Gewöhnungsbedürftig, jedoch genial! Unsere kulinarischen Frühstückswünsche wurden allesamt erfüllt, Freude herrscht! Die Frühstückskellnerin war ein echt herzensguter Mensch.

Das Spa und die angebotenen Behandlungen haben wir selbst nicht benutzt.

Wir können das Hotel nur empfehlen, wir werden es sicher wieder beim nächsten Barcelona Aufenthalt buchen.

ABaC Restaurant 

Wir hatten das Glück (jemand hatte kurzfristig abgesagt), zwei Plätze im hoteleigenen Restaurant zu erhalten, dass ansonsten immer sehr gut gebucht ist. Wir hatten ein 16 gängiges Menü, optimal portioniert, wir waren satt. Die Kreativität der diversen Speisen ist ausserordentlich gelungen und es hat sehr gut geschmeckt! Qualität der Speisen Top, die Liebe zum Detail und der Dekoration sichtbar. Wir haben die dazugehörende Weinempfehlung mit bestellt, dies war sensationell. Kombination der Getränke, Weisswein, Rotwein, Bier, Sake, Dessertwein war super! Auch konnte alles (fast ausnahmslos) was serviert wurde gegessen werden. Wir meinen damit die diversen Dekorationen, wie zum Bespiel eingepackte Schokoladenkugeln (zum Kaffee), eingepackt in ""Gelatineplastik""! Das Servicepersonal ist in genügender Anzahl vorhanden, sehr aufmerksam und schnell. Das Preisniveau ist eher im oberen Bereich an zu siedeln, jedoch unserer Meinung nach fair! Auch hier sehr gut.

Folgendes könnte aus unserer Sicht optimiert werden:
- keine Wiederholung von Knoblauchsauce bei den Gängen
- keine Wiederholung von Erdbeeren bei den Dessertvarianten
- der Hauptgang war lauwarm
- Küche schickte die Gerichte bereits, bevor andere Gäste einen Gang fertig hatten
- zum Espresso sollten Espressolöffelchen serviert werden und nicht Kaffeelöffel
- Servicepersonal könnte mit mehr Charme punkten, den so essen macht Spass und ist ein Erlebnis und nicht nur ein Arbeitsakt

Wir werden jedoch wieder kommen, den Barcelona, Gaudi, unsere Frühstückskellnerin und das ABaC Restaurant & Hotel haben unsere Herzen erobert.",4,2015,01,04
45,Mejor imposible,"Decidí darle una sorpresa de aniversario a mi pareja, reservando la suite ático con desayuno incluido y una cena en el restaurante Abac. Desde el primer momento que llegamos la atención fue máxima. Nada más llegar al parking nos recogieron el equipaje, y nos dirigimos a la recepción donde nos esperaba una copa de bienvenida. Después de hacer el check-in nos enseñaron todo el hotel. En primer lugar la cocina. Nos sorprendio que todo estuviera pulcro e impoluto, a pesar de toda la gente que había trabajando. Al entrar nos ofrecieron conocer al chef, quien a pesar de estar trabajando se acercó para darnos la bienvenida. Nos enseñaron el spa con todos sus servicios, el lounge club, el funcionamiento de las tarjetas ...y asi llegó el momento de ver nuestra suite. Nada más llegar comprobamos que superaba las expectativas, que ya eran muy altas. Todo está cuidado, hasta el ultimo detalle. Lo mejor, y por lo que recomiendo esa habitación, fue la terraza y su jacuzzi climatizado. 
Por la tarde disfrutamos del spa, con unas instalaciones limpias y muy tranquilas. Más tarde pasamos al yacuzzi de la habitación. Cabe destacar que el agua estaba muy limpia a pesar de estar al aire libre. Ya en la noche nos dirijimos a cenar. Desde el primer momento que entras en la sala, la atención es máxima. Nos sentamos y empezó el espectáculo. Decidimos coger el menú gran abac y maridaje de vinos, fue una experiencia que merece la pena vivir. Sin duda salimos encantados, y si podemos repetiremos lo antes posible.",5,2014,12,28
45,El paraiso urbano,"Tanto el trato como las instalaciones fueron magnificas, la cena más que excelente, tuvimos la suerte de coincidir con el Chef Jordi Cruz quien muy amablemente de acercó a saludar a la mesa. La señora que nos atendió en el desayuno muy detallista y atenta. En resumen una joya escondida en en el bullicio de la ciudad que recomendamos sin duda! ",5,2014,12,27
45,Es el mejor hotel en el que me hospedé en 2014,"Hola! Me encantaría compartir mi experiencia en ABaC Barcelona. Cómo escoges un hotel cuando viajas a una ciudad desconocida? Yo tengo una lista de condiciones breves...
Ubicacion, Seguridad, Calidad de Atención, Tipo de Habitaciones::: mucha gente elige los hoteles más céntricos que les permitan un desplazamiento rápido a los sitios turísticos y no los culpo, sin embargo yo prefiero una ubicación periférica con rápido acceso al transporte y en este caso no me equivoqué. ABaC tiene autobuses, metro y un sitio de taxis inmediato a su salida. Aparte de ello la zona en donde se encuentra es sumamente segura y es algo que siempre se busca cuando no se conoce el sitio. Al llegar nos ofrecieron un tour por todo el hotel...en lo personal prefiero los lugares pequeños que vuelven más acogedora la estancia. Una de las características que más adoré fue la privacidad de las habitaciones no escuchas en absoluto a los de la habitación contigua!!! Y debo comentar que se preocupan por todo, yo viajaba con mi prima y enfermó de la garganta, no sé si fue coincidencia pero al llegar a la habitación tenía la temperatura exacta para evitar que empeorara su estado de salud. Debo aplaudir la actitud de todo el personal en particular de la persona que nos recibió ;)
Si les preocupa el precio entiendo que opten por otra opción pero cuando de viajar se trata yo prefiero invertir en mi confort, y por cierto al llegar nos ofrecieron un mapa de la ciudad y algunas recomendaciones de los lugares más visitados por turistas. Vale la pena hospedarse. Para mi próxima visita a Barcelona ya sé cual será mi cubil de alojamiento. Felicidades por la maravillosa estancia que nos hicieron pasar, por satisfacer al cliente y por su calidad humana. Felices Fiestas!!!

La habitación fenomenal, la suite 825, muy limpia  y moderna.
El spa pequeñito, pero suficiente para relajarse y desconectar. 
En definitiva todo un lujo!!! Recomiendo ir aunque sea una vez pero preparar bien el bolsillo!!!",5,2014,12,13

Es un hotel tranquilo en un lugar privilegiado donde descansar, relajarse y sentirse como en casa está asegurado.
Una atención personalizada que hizo que la estancia fuera todavía más agradable, no faltó ningún detalle.
A todo esto, hay que añadir la cena en el fantástico restaurante. Ir a este magnifico hotel y no pasar por el Restaurante del Chef es como comerte una paella sin arroz.

45,Un ambiente de diseño actual que transmite estilo lujo y sobretodo confort,"Nuestra última experiencia en el Abac hotel es un extraordinario fin de semana compartido en pareja.
Fantástico. Había disfrutado ya de estas maravillosas instalaciones en otras ocasiones en viajes de negocios, pero quizás  en estas escapadas del estrés semanal  cuando buscas momentos más especiales, sentirte a gusto junto a la persona que quieres, es cuando más valoras el trato recibido y la categoria de las instalaciones que tienes a tu disposición.
Trato con el cliente exquisito, mezcla de gran nivel profesional con una proximidad casi familiar.
Habitaciones decoradas con elegancia actual, lujo y confort conseguidos con detalles de última generación.
Las dependencias comunes del hotel invitan a disfrutarlas, tanto la relajante zona del spa, o el lounge bar o la terraza donde tomar la última copa del dia.
Capitulo aparte y mención especial merece, sobretodo para los que somos entusiastas de la gastronomia, el restaurante del hotel, dirigido con maestria por el chef Jordi Cruz y distinguido con dos estrellas Michelin.
La ubicación de este restaurante, sin duda de primer nivel mundial, dentro de las dependencias del hotel en que te alojas, te permite disfrutar tanto de aquella cena tan especial con la pareja, como disponer del entorno adecuado para sorprender en qualquier comida de negocios.
En mi opinión hotel altamente recomendable con una relación de nivel de instalacion-precio
de lo más interesante de la ciudad.",5,2014,09,23

45,Sin palabras,"Llegamos al hotel y no pudimos tener mejor recibimiento! Nos vinieron a buscar hasta la puerta de entrada, llevándonos a través del magnífico jardín hasta la recepción donde nos esperaba Irene y  la directora.

Nos ofrecieron una copa de cava, cosa que agradecimos ya que era una ocasión especial para nosotros.

Nos mostraron todo el hotel! Desde la cocina, pasando por el spa, la  zona de bar (poco aprovechada bajo mi punto de vista) hasta llegar a la habitación.

Habitación luminosa, silenciosa y que, por algún motivo, nos transmitía una sensación de paz, y eso que aún no habíamos probado la cama! Espectacular, sin palabras, que maravilla de cama!!!

No teníamos reserva de mesa en el restaurante y gracias a la ayuda de Cristina conseguimos una mesa.

Fue una cena que no podremos olvidar en mucho tiempo, todos y cada uno de los detalles de los platos, los sabores, las texturas… Gracias Pablo y Amar por vuestro trato. 

No tenemos palabras para agradecer a todo el equipo de ABaC su amabilidad. No podemos mas que dar un 10 al conjunto de ABaC Restaurante Hotel.",5,2014,09,03

Nos vinieron a recoger al garage para subirnos a una recepción poco habitual.
Allí nos esperaba Cristina y su equipo quien nos hizo sentir especiales. Nos acompañaron a la terraza y nos invitaron a un cocktail de bienvenida.
Habitación luminosa y con una terraza espectacular donde tomamos el desayuno al día siguiente.
Servicio de habitación un poco lento pero valió la pena.
Nos faltó probar el restaurante del tal conocido Chef! La próxima sin duda.

45,No cumplio nuestras expectativas,"Este hotel no ha superado nuestras expectativas en absoluto.

Cristina ha creado un ambiente excepcional, preocupada siempre por todos los detalles, haciéndote sentir como en casa .
El restaurante magnífico -Jordi se sentirá orgulloso- discreto y muy elegante, por cierto el desayuno SUPER. Si quieres darte un placer el menú degustación merece la pena...
Hace unos meses invité a mi hija y su novio a pasar en el Abac 3 ò 4 dias, para mi fue muy especial invitarles y ellos estuvieron encantados, lo recordarán siempre...En resumen un gran equipo humano en un gran hotel...no defrauda...",5,2014,05,01

Situado en la parte alta de Barcelona, sorprende encontrar un entorno tan tranquilo dentro de la ciudad.

Todo el personal muestra una profesionalidad y amabilidad acorde con la categoría del hotel.

45,Una estancia perfecta,"Tras algunos días intercambiando eMails con el hotel, para así poder resolver todas las dudas y analizar todas las opciones posibles, finalmente nos hemos alojado en la Habitación Deluxe con su paquete de Escapada Romántica.

Bañera con hidromasaje, ducha muy amplia, cama muy grande, equipamiento de la habitación (electrónica, domótica, etc.), elegancia y detalles han conseguido hacer de nuestra estancia un recuerdo que tardaremos tiempo en olvidar.

En nuestra reserva había incluido unas copas de Champagne con polvo de oro, así como un baño con sales y jabón espumoso, decorado con pétalos de rosas y velas. Estos detalles han resultado ser de lo más románticos y relajantes.

No hemos sido clientes de su restaurante. No obstante, tanto los platos solicitados para cenar como el Desayuno Gourmet (ambos servidos en la habitación), han resultado ser muy completos y sabrosos, acompañados con detalles que le daban un toque de elegancia.

El personal del hotel que nos atendió desde nuestra llegada hasta nuestra partida ha sido muy atento y comprensible, atendiendo todas nuestras preguntas, haciéndonos un Tour por toda la habitación, explicándonos todas las características, llevando nuestro equipaje y preparando todos los detalles que he descrito anteriormente.

El menú gran Abac, que fue el que cogimos, delicioso y más que una experiencia gastronómica, todo un espectáculo (no pudimos terminar la totalidad de 15 platos eso sí porqué estábamos llenísimos). 

Estuvimos en la habitación Penthouse, perfecta para una noche romántica. Tanto el hotel como el restaurante preciosos.

45,Wochenendausflug,"Das ABaC liegt nördlich der Innenstadt von Barcelona. Es ist ein relativ kleines Hotel mit grünem Garten und moderner Architektur. Besonders das Restaurant ist erwähnenswert und spielt die Hauptrolle im Konzept. So ist die Küche zum Beispiel für die Gäste zu jeder Zeit frei zu betreten.

Zimmer:
Das ""Deluxe Zimmer"" ist sehr schön gestaltet mit tollem Licht und sehr bequemen Möbeln. Auch das Bad hat uns sehr gut gefallen, auch wenn es manchen vielleicht zu modern wäre. Es ist so ziemlich alles vorhanden, was man von einem Hotel dieser Kategorie erwartet. Zwei Dinge müssten allerdings verbessert werden, damit alles perfekt funktioniert: Der Schrank im Flur ist zumindest in unserem Zimmer schlecht zu öffnen gewesen, da eine Schiebetür aus Platzmangel viele Schubladen schwer erreichbar gemacht hat. Zudem war die Badschiebetür schwergängig.

Personal:
Das Personal ist rundweg freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Vor allem die Kellnerin beim Frühstück (übrigens außerordentlich gut) ist uns positiv in Erinnerung geblieben. Sie ist ein wirklich herzensguter Mensch.

Spa und Lounge:
Der Spa ist relativ klein, aber sehr schön gestaltet. Durch die geringe Anzahl der Gäste im November waren wir immer alleine dort. Besonders die erwärmten Hamamliegen haben uns gefallen.
Die Lounge ist in die Fundamente des Altbaus eingebettet, auf denen der jetzige Neubau steht. Dadurch entsteht eine sehr angenehme Stimmung und moderne Lichteffekte werten das noch auf. Die Bar ist klein, aber fein und der Barkeeper kennt alle möglichen Rezepte. Unsere Cocktails gingen zudem aufs Haus.

Lage:
Auf den ersten Blick scheint das Hotel etwas dezentral zu liegen. Allerdings kann man in Barcelona fast alles gut zu Fuß erledigen. Der Park Güell ist in 20 Minuten zu erreichen und die Innenstadt in 30. Zudem kann man auch die U Bahn benutzen oder auf den Fahrservice vom Hotel zurückgreifen. Selbst Auto zu fahren sollte man schon aufgrund der Parksituation vermeiden.

Alles in allem waren die zwei Tage im ABaC sehr erholend und wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder buchen, wenn wir nach Barcelona kommen.",5,2013,11,21
45,La perfección llevada a la máxima expresión,"Comimos el menú degustación de 15 pasos y fue simplemente un placer sin parangón. Hemos comido en otros grandes restaurantes de todo el mundo, y posiblemente sea del que hemos salido con mejor sabor de boca. Cada plato es un mundo de sabores, olores y texturas. Todo ello con un grandísimo servicio, una atención exquisita y un sumiller excelente. Al finalizar, nos invitaron a visitar la cocina y conocer al Chef, Jordi Cruz, que recientemente ha adquirido gran fama por un concurso televisivo. Si eres un gourmet, sin duda, no te lo puedes perder.",5,2013,11,19
45,"Buen hotel, restaurante muy lento.","La habitación es excelente y no le falta ningún detalle. La chica de la recepción es encantadora.

En el restaurante la comida es buena aunque el servicio es tremendamente lento. Fue un error comer ahí porque perdimos dos horas y media largas para y ya no nos quedó tiempo para otras cosas.",3,2013,11,05
45,imprescindible,"Hotel extraordinario en una zona preciosa de Barcelona. Recomendable en todos los sentidos. Nosotros hicimos el completo: estancia y cena. El hotel es muy bonito, de nivel, detalles en todos los sentidos, además cómodo, extremadamente limpio y confortable. Con todo lo mejor fue la cena. Un menú degustación de gran nivel, muy completo y a un precio ajustado. Máxima profesionalidad, si se tiene la capacidad económica en mi opinión es imprescindible.",5,2013,11,04
45,La mejor experiencia gastronómica de mi vida!,"No hay palabras para describir la experiencia de poder disfrutar de un menú degustación con maridaje. Todos los detalles están muy cuidados, además el equipo de Abac se esfuerza al máximo para que te sientas muy especial. Muy recomendable a los gourmets.",5,2013,10,12
45,Im-pre-sio-nan-te!!,"No se trata de una cena, se trata de una experiencia vital! Comida perfecta, original, alucinante...todo un espectáculo
Trato insuperable, decoración vanguardista,amabilidad extrema
Se puede visitar la cocina, que está a la última
Evidentemente, el precio es alto, pero no deja de ser un lujo alcanzable
Muy recomendable
(Aprox 150-200 euros/cabeza)",5,2013,09,28
45,Hotel Abac de Barcelona,"Hotel donde la atención al cliente es prioritaria. Personal profesional y encantador . Un ambiente relajante y muy cuidado como corresponde a su categoria.Una cocina excelente. Todo de primerisima calidad. Yo lo recomiendo a todas aquellas personas que busquen algo especial. Saldran encantadas.Mi marido y yo llevamos visitandolo periodicamente desde su inaguración y esperamos seguir hacindolo durante muchos años.Sus habitaciones son espaciosas y tranquilas. Todo esta cuidado al minimo detalle.Todo un lujo poder desayunar en el jardin o incluso en el comedor,servido por personal atento a cualquier petición y por supuesto con productos excelentes. Pero donde se aprecia la verdadera gastronomía es a la hora de comer o cenar. Solo hay una palabra que lo defina:Impresionante.Pero creo que lo mejor es que se acerquen a este maravilloso hotel y comprueben por si mismos todo lo que yo les he comentado",5,2013,09,04
45,Impresionante por todo,"Impresionante por todo, se merece esa calificacion porque esta todo cuidado al detalle, ademas el restaurante es un lujo al alcance de todos, pues tiene un menu asequible y muy original. Los platos con nitro son un espectaculo que merece la visita.
Las habitacion son modernas, con todos los detalles, y reservando con tiempo se puede conseguir a buen precio.
En Barcelona, volveremos a repertir.",5,2013,08,28
45,La técnica al servicio del gusto.,"En algunos ""estrellados"" hemos apreciado técnica culinaria pero poco ""sabor"" en la comida. En Abac lo que más me impactó es que se aprecia una gran técnica, que es el medio para conseguir una comida sabrosa y gustosa. Cada plato del menú degustación (el Gran Abac) te impacta por su sabor, gustosísimo. Empezando por un nitro cocktail montado en la mesa, espectacular, y luego una focaccia de foie gras, unos ñoquis de parmesano o unos pequeños lomos de bacalao impresionantes, pasando por un tártar diferente a todos los que he probado, todo magnífico. Quizás solo el último plato con presa ibérica y gamba estaba a un nivel algo inferior. 
En definitiva magnífico restaurante y gran cocinero Jordi Cruz, directo al estrellato.",5,2013,08,15
45,no hay palabras suficientes...,"Nos hemos alojado en dos ocasiones, ambas una sola noche y todo está a la altura de su clasificación como 5 estrellas gran lujo; las habitaciones son realmente impresionantes, la tranquilidad...  el spa privado,  el desayuno en el jardín ya no te cuento... es sin duda el mejor hotel en el que hemos estado, todo diseño y sofisticación. Un once.",5,2013,06,09
45,TRANQUILIDAD EN PLENO BARCELONA,"Un remanso de paz y tranquilidad en este hotel, alejado del céntrico, pero bien comunicado. Acogedor, moderno, con todos los servicios y con excelente restaurante. A destacar las suites con terraza. Vale la pena.",5,2013,06,04
45,De lo mejor,"Soy amante de Barcelona y de la naturaleza, por eso os recomiendo este espectacular Hotel situado en el centro de Barcelona, un lugar donde te puedes relajar estando mismo en la zona cero de Barcelona. Mi experiencia en este Hotel fue maravillosa. Os lo recomiendo al 100%.",5,2013,03,22
45,Splendido,"Super hotel. Ho soggiornato li per qualche notte durante il soggiorno a Barcellona. Camera molto bella e curata, grande accoglienza e disponibilità della reception.
Comodissimo per raggiungere il centro in breve tempo

45,Excelente !!!,"Disfrutamos de un fin de semana y quedamos encantados. Es un hotel moderno,intimo, muy acogedor. La habitación muy amplia y elegante. La cama es comodísima. Dispone de dos televisores Bang & olufsen, un iPad, el baño también es muy agradable, tiene bañera hidromasaje com ilumicación y detalles de la firma Hermes.
El servicio fantástico, muy atento y servicial.
El restaurante muy elegante y tranquilo. Disfrutamos de una cena con el chef Jordi Cruz, sencillamente espectacular, Tomamos el menú degustación, los vinos, nos dejamos aconsejar por el sumiller, sencillamente nos parecieron exquisitos, servidos a su temperatura correcta El menú nos pareció perfecto desde el principio hasta los postres. Estuvimos 3 horas comiendo. El personal que nos atendió nos pareció muy profesional y nos guiaron dándonos las explicaciones en cada plato. 
Terminada la cena pudimos disfrutar del Abac Lounge donde pudimos tomar una copa en un ambiente muy acogedor.
El hotel también dispone de una zona Spa donde relajarnos.
Simplemente excelente !!!",5,2013,01,29
45,Sobrenatural,"No tengo palabras para describur lo bien que comimos allí, el servicio brutal, la comida increible, la fusion de sabores, la elasticidad de tecnicas en un mismo plato, nos dejaron anonadados. Vajilla versace, cristaleria scott zwietzel, casi nada  el hotel es un lujazo  vale la pena.",5,2013,01,25
45,"Un auténtico ""delicatessen""","Todas las Grandes ciudades del Mundo tienen algún establecimiento exclusivo, y Barcelona no podía ser una excepción. El hotel es un diamante (qué bien sentaría una pequeña piscina). Habitaciones con todas las comodidades y más. Insonorización extraordinaria. 
La restauración muy buena. Inauguraramos el nuevo menú degustación y le otorgamos la más alta puntuación. Muy trabajado, de gran calidad y presentación perfecta. Raciones justas como para no sentirse lleno antes de terminar. Servicio impecable. Un verdadero placer. Desayuno continental algo justo, pero de óptima calidad. Quedaría mejor con un plato ""caliente"" Spa pequeño pero agradable con tranquilas instalaciones. El servicio mejorable
En definitiva: una experiencia plus",5,2012,12,03
45,"Excellentes, sehr guenstig gelegenes Hotel mit fantastischer Kueche","Excellentes, sehr guenstig gelegenes Hotel mit fantastischer Kueche im Norden von Barcelona. Wenige Zimmer, wunderschoene Suiten, eine mit Jacuzzi. Abholservice ab/zum Flughafen moeglich (nicht inkludiert). Sehr freundliche, vielsprachige Damen an der Rezeption. SPA Bereich vorhanden. Zimmer sehr schoen und hell, B&O und IPAD vorhanden. Kueche auf sehr gehobenem Niveau - 2 Michelin Sterne - mit excellentem Sommelier. Service oberer Durchschnitt. Fruehstueck sehr fein - einmal kein Buffet. 
Grossartig gelegen in einem Villenviertel im Norden Barcelonas, direkt vor dem Hoteleingang Endstation einer Metro, Station der lokalen Tram und Haltestellen mehrerer Jump on/off Busse.",5,2012,11,25
45,Barcelona mit Trubel am Tag und Ruhe in der Nacht ...,"Für unseren 3-Tages-Besuch von Barcelona wählten wir das ABaC. Vorrangig wegen der ruhigen Lage abseits des Trubels - ca. 10 Minuten mit der Metro ins Zentrum der Metropole. Das ""Deluxe Zimmer"" war modern eingerichtet, anfangs interessant sich mit den ""Lichtspielen"" zurechtzufinden da vieles automatisch an, auf und zu (... Vorhänge) geht. Getrenntes WC, allerdings auch im Sanitärbereich viel Design was nicht immer besonders praktisch ist. Das Bett war gemütlich, sodass wir jeden Tag erholt zur Besichtigung starten konnten. Der Empfang im Hotel war sehr nett, die Mitarbeiter sind freundlich. Als Frühstück wurde uns jeden Tag Obst, frischer Orangensaft, Croissants  und Cappuccino serviert. Klein, fein, für uns ausreichend aber für den doch stolzen Zimmerpreis wäre ein bisschen Abwechslung schön.  Als Stadthotel ist das ABaC auf jeden Fall weiterzuempfehlen, obgleich - wie in dieser Kategorie Hotel leider sehr häufig - der persönliche Charme abgeht.
Besuch im ABaC Restaurant: Schönes Ambiente, nette Tischkultur und aufmerksame Kellner ... und natürlich ein ausgezeichneter Koch (2 Michelin-Sterne). Das Menü war raffiniert und bot ein paar kulinarische Höhepunkte. Ein toller Abend und zu empfehlen! Einzig im Service wäre noch ein wenig Spielraum nach oben.",4,2012,09,13
45,Abseits des Trubels...,"... verbrachten wir hier 3 ruhige Nächte. Wir wählten dieses Hotel, weil
1. in einer ruhigen Gegend und dennoch
2. Metro/Bus vor der Haustüre
3. modern und
4. preisgekrönte Küche.
Gebucht hatten wir ein ""deluxe Zimmer"", das im Wesentlichen dem Prospekt entsprach: modern, hell, ruhig. Als in dieser Preisklasse eher unterdurchschnittlich empfanden wir das Vorhandensein von nur einem Waschbecken (und das im Schlafzimmer), die dunkle Dusche/Bad (nur Dämmerlicht) und die unpraktikable Schranklösung. Toll hingegen die Regendusche (ebenso im Dunklen), das Bett an sich, Nespressomaschine. Den grossen B&O Fernseher brauchten wir nicht.
Das Package beinhaltete ein continental breakfast, das wir drei mal ""genossen"". Gut waren geschnittenes Obst - der Rest bestand aus croissant und Kuchen, Butter und Marmelade. Für unseren Geschmack zu fetthältig. Und jeden Tag genau das selbe. Keine Abwechslung. Daher ein Minuspunkt.
Das Personal war überaus hilfreich und nett. Das Diner im Zweisterne Restaurant ausgezeichnet, wenngleich nicht überragend, die Bedienung gut, aber nicht Spitze.
Innsgesamt überwog der freundliche und nette Eindruck, sodass wir gerne eine Empfehlung aussprechen.",4,2012,09,12
45,"Fabuloso Hotel, Fabulosa Habitación, Fabulosa Atención, Fabulosa Estancia...","Para mí, fue igual que lo vi en la web, no me llevé ningún desengaño, la habitación amplia, la cama fabulosa, la terraza espectacular... Habíamos llegado de viaje por Praga-Viena-Budapest, mi pareja no sabía nada, y cuando me vio entrar, se quedó alucinada, ya que se suponía que íbamos en busca de la estación para irnos a Valencia. A partir de ahí el personal del hotel fué determinante para que todo saliese bien, nos atendieron magníficamente desde el primer minuto, nos invitaron a una copa de cava mientras hacíamos el check in, nos enseñaron todo el hotel, y nos llevaron a la habitación, donde tenían preparada la cubitera con la botella de cava que había pedido. Todo fue a las mil maravillas, le hice cerrar los ojos, le puse un video, y le regalé un anillo de compromiso... Volveremos a celebrar ese día, en sin duda uno de los mejores hoteles en Barcelona, además nos quedó pendiente la cena en su magnífico restaurante que cierra Domingos y Lunes.",5,2012,08,14
45,I N C R E I B L E,"He tenido la oportunidad de dormir dos noches en este maravilloso hotel durante el año pasado, una de ellas mi noche de bodas, y no tengo palabras para describir la maravilla de hotel que es. La decoracion, el servicio, la intimidad, el confort, los detalles, el personal, mmmmhhhhh todo excelente! Felicidades! Seguid asi!!",5,2012,05,12
45,Excelente estancia,"Hotel maravilloso, cerca del tranvía que sube al tibiado, buena comunicación con ferrocarril, parada de taxi. Baño magnifico con productos de vermes, habitación con buena iluminación natural y artificial, camas y almohadasuy cómodas, trato del personal maravilloso y lo mejor las amas calientes y el te del spa. Muy recomendable",4,2012,01,18
45,Indiscutiblemente 5* GL,"Sensacional.

Es como un cubo de cristal en medio de un jardín, curiosamente situado en un barrio residencial de Barcelona. Estas características ya hacen que sea un lugar exclusivo pero hay que añadir: 
1. Habitación : perfectamente insonorizada aún teniendo 3 paredes de cristal. La cama superconfortable, el diseño moderno funcional y cálido.  Es una gozada despertar y poder ver todos los árboles del jardín y detrás de ellos el bullicio de la ciudad (verlo no oírlo).
2.Spa: la zona de aguas también está muy bien diseñada y resulta acogedora. Por cierto tienen bañadores disponible para los clientes que se los han olvidado.
3.Desayuno a la carta buenísimo. Con vistas al jardín o si el tiempo lo permite el porche. 
4.Servicio: La atención del personal impecable.

Es sin duda alguna una experiencia inolvidable, es un hotel 5* gran lujo con una peculiaridad, estar en medio de un jardín, difícil de encontrar en una ciudad como Barcelona.",5,2011,11,23
45,Distinción!!!,"Si se trata de ser objetivo, podríamos catalogar al ABaC Barcelona como 5 estrellas de Gran Lujo pero además, este maravilloso lugar detenta una cualidad que muy pocos establecimientos pueden conseguir.... "" La Excelencia"", palabra mágica que muchos buscan y muy pocos consiguen. Aseguro que el ABaC Barcelona consiguió esa excelencia amalgamando lo superlativo en cuanto a servicios con la calidad humana de su staff.
Mucho te podría decir de este hotel en cuanto a sus servicios, a su gastronomía exquisita, a su personal, lo único que pienso decirte es que traspases el umbral de Avenida Tibidabo 1 y te prepares a experimentar una experiencia incomparable.",5,2011,10,05
45,Buon Hotel vicino la metro,"Camera standard, carina e in linea di massima pulita
Buona la colazione tra dolce e salato. mI hanno permesso di usufruire del servizio anche dopo l'orario di chiusura.
Non vicinissimo al centro ma in compenso vicino alla metro e alla fermata degli autobus (quindi è molto facile raggiungere l'aeroporto)
ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo potrebbe essere scelto di nuovo per una visita a Barcellona",4,2011,09,18
45,Un eden en el centro de Barcelona.,"Este hotel es sin duda un lugar que supera las expectativas de cualquiera. Es ideal para ir solo o acompañado ya que el personal de todo el hotel aparte de su excelente profesionalidad te hacen sentir como en casa, con un trato muy familiar pero con el servicio impecable de 5*GL.
Alucinante las duchas y lo mejor de todo la insonorización de las habitaciones.",5,2011,08,22
45,inusual calidad pero con pequeños fallos,"sorpresa a la llegada: ¡ el hotel no se ve ! ningún letrero en la calle advierte de su existencia. escogido detrás de un portal de madera, que se abre después de identificarse el viajero, se encuentra el edificio principal de poca altura en medio de frondosos arboles. la recepción es un despacho elegante donde el recepcionista, sumamente amable,  te ofrece una copa de cava mientras que toma tus datos. te acompaña a tu habitación a la cual se accede..... ....cruzando literalmente la cocina del hotel ! Eso si, impecable y brillando. En el recuero queda la sensación que un buen amigo te enseño su casa.
la habitación esta equipada con un gusto refinado, la tv enorme es de la marca mas exclusiva pero en el baño molestan dos detalles: la puerta de la ducha de lluvia deja escapar el agua y en vez de la caja de kleenex hay tres pañuelos entre los artículos de acogida, estos si, de primera marca.
En el desayuno servido a la mesa falta una carta y desentonan unos paquetes de 
cereales en un rincón.
El hotel alberga el restaurante del mismo nombre,  de cocina creativa y espectacular aunque evidentemente no para todos los gustos. 
al pedir un aperitivo antes del almuerzo llama la atención que el camarero lo trae  ya servido en el vaso y sin mostrar la botella.
Aun así el hotel es recomendable y toda una experiencia positiva.",4,2011,08,13
45,Como en casa,"Un boutique hotel moderno y con un trato excepciónal a los clientes.
Si lo que quieres es poder descansar bien después de un día de ajetreo, esta es la mejor opción. Es el único hotel de Barcelona en el que nos hemos alojado y no nos ha molestado ningún ruido, realmente está bien insonorizado . Habitaciones muy completas y con un cuarto de baño extraordinario. Disponen de un pequeño spa donde puedes relajarte un rato. No tuvimos ocasión de probar su cocina. Supongo que otra vez será.
Agradecer a Marien sus detalles y atenciones.
Atendiendo a sus buenas ofertas, probablemente la mejor opciones en Barcelona.",5,2010,08,30
