150,Amazing Hotel,"My first time in London I decided to stay at the Hyatt regency Churchill, I was not disappointed. From check in to in room service was amazing. The hotel had everything I could need and want, from the adult lounge to the full breakfast in the morning. The only issue I had was they had forgotten me one day in terms of my breakfasts, I ended up waiting 35 minutes and no food was ever brought out. Other than that, the bellmen were very helpful with places to go and things to do. Would definitely recommend this hotel and return.",4,2024,10,18
150,Short holiday break,"Beautiful home in a fantastic location. Breakfast was amazing and the service at the hotel was also fabulous. There was a wide variety on the menu for breakfast. They catered for all needs. The ambience was lovely. The hotel smelt amazing. Check in process was a bit slow but other than that, a perfect hotel !",5,2024,10,18
150,5 Wonderful Days,"From check-in to check-out, The Churchill was fabulous. Everything was wonderful. The front desk service was great, the concierge was wonderful, the staff in the restaurant were on top of things and housekeeping was perfect. I can’t wait to go back!",5,2024,10,15
150,"Clean room, scratchy towels","The was kept quite clean. Overall it was a satisfactory stay, but I've stayed at better Hyatts. The staff was a little dismissive as we booked with points. The water they left each day was very appreciated. The towels and robes need to be replaced.",4,2024,10,13
150,Great location good rooms but need more attention to  detail. The staff reaching out for tips was quite overbearing and.,"It’s a good hotel but needs a lot of improvement in some areas like in room facilities, check in and storage management. The toiletries provided are average and need to be refreshed more often.. The room is good and spacious.. The restaurant service can be erratic. The concierge restaurant recommendations need to get better",3,2024,10,12
150,Very welcoming team,This is the 7th stay for me in less than 2 years. Every time i arrive very early in the morning and i immediately receive my room. This thing let me think of staying with them whenever i’m in London especially this is not something easy to got in london.,4,2024,10,12
150,Excellent choice for a hotel,"Excellent location for seeing various sites in London. 

Excellent service by everyone at the hotel - front desk, concierge bell man, etc. There were always taxis available for guests to use. The rooms were clean and the housekeeprs were happy to accomodate any special needs. I hope to return.",5,2024,10,06
150,"I am regularly visit london and discoverist member of Hyatt, today check at hotel was extremely bad ans staff was rude",Extremely poor service at check in and being Hyatt discoverist member extremely disappointed with service behaviour of staff.they must improve bankers how to deal with customers being 5 star hotel and at least should take care of regular customers,1,2024,09,27
150,"Not Bad, but Also Not Memorable","The check-in process was smooth, and when my room was ready, the staff notified me in a timely manner while I was sightseeing. They always asked how I was enjoying my stay whenever I encountered the check-in staff. However, there were some downsides with breakfast. Nothing stood out as memorable; there were no special local dishes, not even scones. Additionally, the hotel’s location wasn’t very favorable for tourists.",3,2024,09,26
150,Great Location and great Staff,My first time at the churchill’s what great Location and what a great hospitality by the staff i would come again if i find agood offer like this time .,5,2024,09,26
150,Wonderful hotel!,"great location, friendly staff and overall wonderful experience. we spent a few nights here at the end of our honeymoon",5,2024,09,25
150,Thank you,I have never had as much urgent need of help as I did in this trip. The concierge and housekeeping went out of their way to help us.,5,2024,09,24
150,Professional staff and excellent services,We had wonderful stays for my partner retirement celebration.   This hotel has outstanding classic services.  Good location to access Oxford St and Hide Park.  Highly recommend!!,5,2024,09,23
150,You pay for 5 stars but will get a conference hotel,"This is not a 5 star hotel. It feels like 4 star conference center with all the usual trappings: Small and not very clean rooms. Thin walls. Dated and cheap furnishings. Not great room service. Fine for a one to two night work trip but something that makes you excited about getting home.

Some odd things: no coffee machines in the room, a fridge in the night stand (odd design?) with no drinks, a Toto bidet that was broken… Also, our room looked nothing like the images online? 

Finally, I asked about arranging a nail service and was told it would be 160 pounds. That’s like 280 CAD. Good grief.",2,2024,09,20
150,This is The Place!,"From the front desk help, concierge, wait staff, doormen, and housekeeping...What a wonderful stay here! I booked this hotel for a business trip and am sure to return again and again, professionally and personally.  The room was clean, comfortable, and a nice size. Be sure to sign up for their buffet breakfast; it was the best I've had in London. There are many flavorful and fresh food stations and cooked-to-order eggs. This hotel is right around the corner to the Tube and a short walk to Hyde Park. This is definitely one of my new favorite places to stay in London!",5,2024,09,19
150,Great hotel,"Large well appointed rooms with comfortable beds with down comforters,  Attentive staff.  Helpful concierge.  Taxis always available with out having to wait.",5,2024,09,17
150,Fantastic Hotel in a Fantastic loaction,"This hotel has been my favorite for several years now.  For me the location is perfect.  A few minutes walk in either direction gives you the feeling of living in London's most amazing neighborhood. The hotel itself is wonderful.  Great food, staff, and rooms.  Special thanks to Mr. Tomas Vieitos and his team for always taking care great care of us.  Thank you!",5,2024,09,13
150,Simply Excellent,"This is simply an excellent hotel, excellent in every respect.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Bathrooms, at least some of them, are equipped with bidet toilet seats, which I welcome (and apparently make the hotel a big hit with Muslim patrons).  Breakfast buffet is generous, with a wide variety of dishes.  But it's service where this hotel absolutely shines.  This is our second visit to the Churchill and I would hope to use it in the future should be travel to London again.",5,2024,09,10
150,A great base to start UK Vacation,"Great location, friendly staff and we were able to get in early due to a red eye from the States.  The staff surprised us with a bottle of wine and cookies since it was out anniversary trip.",5,2024,09,10
150,Too expensive to stay,"A few days before arrival I received an email asking me if I wanted any dinners reserved, transportation arranged, or needed any last minute requests and if so respond to the email. I responded, and the email said that if I wanted any of these things to call. Seemed odd they would ask and then add another step, but I was still excited about my stay here.

The lobby is great. Mr. Rama is great. My issue was thta as soon as I checked in the girl and the desk didn't seem to know anything. I assumed it was her first day and went to concierge, who sent me to ask another department (which I thought was their job). The restaurant does not accomadate their 24 hour reservation policy for their guests which I thought was odd, but it was fine because there are many eateries in the area. We upgraded to club to have access to snacks and the people there were great. 
Room was dirty and had stains everywhere. Extremely small, the airport hotel we stayed in was much better and a fraction of the price (Sofiltel). You'll also be charged hotel fees per night in addition to the extremely pricey rooms. Do not stay here",1,2024,09,09
150,Fantastic Pillows,What you expect plus the most comfortable pillows ever. Shower over bath needed more headroom and room was lacking natural light. ,4,2024,09,06
150,Solid Hyatt Product,"We stayed 3 nights as part of a vacation and the hotel was fine. Everything was up to Hyatt’s standards; clean, excellent staff & fantastic location. But, the hotel is beginning to show a bit of wear (hallway carpets are near the end of their life). We used points so, it was a decent deal for us but, not sure I’d pay cash (depending on the rate). I’d stay here again if the opportunity arises. ",4,2024,09,05
150,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill Exceeded Expectations!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel twice within a week's time, and both times everything was perfect including location (within walking distance to Marble Arch & Bond Street stations), accommodations, food, and exemplary service.  Hence, we zealously recommend and endorse staying at this lovely hotel.",5,2024,09,05
150,"Great location for walking, impressed with housekeeping","Great hotel, although you can tell the hotel is old from small things like the elevator and hallways, it didn't affect my stay at all as everything in the room was clean and modern. Rather, it added a bit historic flavour to it, especially with the Churchill bust on the first floor. Location is great for shopping but also easily walkable to quieter neighbourhoods with more local shops. 

Check-in and out service were great, front desk was attentive and proactively asked whether I wanted to change my room from twin to king since I was traveling alone (when I booked twin was the only option). 

I was extra impressed by the housekeeping staff. I usually keep the ""do not disturb"" card on my door for most of my stays, as I don't spend that much time in my room to require cleaning. I was walking to my room at 9pm on my third night, and ran into the housekeeping lady (I didn't get her name, but she said she was in charge of the section with my room, 612) who was returning from checking whether the ""do not disturb"" card was still on my door. When she realized that was my room, she kept double checking whether I needed cleaning or bottled water, since I haven't had any housekeeping in the past few days. I really appreciated the offer, and was impressed that they are still checking up this late at night just in case I needed anything.",5,2024,09,04
150,"TERRIBLE  service, pretentious, save your money and stay elsewhere!!","I don't mind paying a premium for comfort and luxury, but this hotel fell short in a big way. As a Hyatt Globalist member, I was never acknowledged as such. The check-in process on the 8th floor was chaotic, and I had to wait an hour for my luggage to be brought to my room. The staff was incredibly cold and dismissive—it felt like the hotel only caters to returning guests who stay for extended periods. I noticed how kind and attentive they were to those guests, which starkly contrasted with the treatment I received as a first-time guest staying for just two nights.

The rooms are tiny, and the bathroom is incredibly small, uncomfortable, and outdated. The Regency Lounge was a waste of time with a poor selection of food and drinks—if you're a Globalist, I recommend opting for breakfast on the ground floor instead. To top it off, when I checked out, no one even asked how my stay was, and when I inquired about the charges on my card, the front desk clerk spoke to me in a patronizing and rude manner.

The only positive aspect of this hotel is its location, but I strongly recommend spending your money elsewhere. Given the high cost, the hotel delivers far below expectations. Having stayed over 70 nights at Hyatt properties this year alone, I find this experience to be a major disappointment. I will never, EVER return. With so many excellent options in London, there's no reason to stay at a place where you're treated poorly, the rooms are mediocre, and the bad experience is the only thing you remember after your vacation.",1,2024,09,04
150,Less than average for a Hyatt brand,"The hotel and its facilities are old. Not sure when it was last refurbished, but definitely could’ve been better. ",2,2024,09,03
150,Fine hotel in a perfect location,"Hotel is very clean, rooms are comfortable and breakfast was fine. Has many small perks that make the experience feel more upscale than the price.",5,2024,09,03
150,Used to be a great hotel.,After covis and the resulting cost cutting Churchill Hyatt compares to Hyatt PLace. ITs a shame considering it was one of the best hotels in London once upon a time.,1,2024,08,28
150,Could have been better.,"The overall cleanliness of the hotel was great. Location was great however hotel management was rude, and the spa facilities were not as expected for a 5 star hotel - the massage was expensive £160 which I do not mind paying however, the room was freezing cold, the oil used was cold and the bed was cold. Very much an in and out scenario. Rushed and didn’t feel relaxing. Have had much better experiences elsewhere. 
Hotel management was rude when I asked to have the breakfast fee refunded off my bill as I had not eaten in the hotel either day I was there. ",3,2024,08,27
150,London vacation with kids,"Excellent hotel! Really enjoyed our stay and the breakfast in the morning.Good location, not too far from the underground and plenty of bus stops nearby. ",5,2024,08,26
150,Great Hotel - Great Location,"What a great hotel.  The room was great; we loved the club lounge and the breakfast was fantastic.  Great location!  Room was large and comfortable.  Housekeeping was excellent.  Easy walk to Selfridges and Marks and Spencer.   Concierge was very helpful in assisting us with changing ""old"" pounds from a previous trip.",5,2024,08,26
150,good london hotel,perfect location for a london hotel.. great room but  overpriced for what you get. The staff all exceptional and the regency club lounge was one of the best in a hyatt i have experienced. our room was at the rear of the hotel so no view as such but was quiet at least. Hotel restaurant was very good and a reasonable price.,4,2024,08,26
150,Great Stay at Hyatt Regency Churchill,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The breakfast was fanatastic and the facilities were superb. Rooms clean and stylish and functioned well.,5,2024,08,25
150,Best spot in London,One of the best hotels ever! Terrific staff. Hotel amenities are amazing. Rooms are luxurious and comfortable.  Hotel location couldn’t be better!,5,2024,08,20
150,Excellent location. New rooms are excellent,"Excellent location 
Tess and Rocio excellent staff members made my stay better
Rooms in 4th floor are excellent
",3,2024,08,20
150,"Our home away from home, the luxurious yet understated elegance of The Churchill",No finer hotel in London with incomparable staff and comfortable rooms with exceptional bedding.  The location is also as god as it gets for West end shopping and attractions.  Portman Square is peaceful and just far enough off Oxford Street to be secluded enough.,5,2024,08,17
150,Great stay! Highly recommended,"Had a quick 1 night stay at this Hyatt for a concert. Every person we encountered during the stay were so nice and kind, and were proactive at making sure we had everything we needed. Quick 10min train ride to Wembley with a 15min walk that is pretty straightforward. The rooms and amenities were top notch. Enjoyed everything.",5,2024,08,17
150,Very Bad,"Never stay  there you will not be appreciated. You are throwing your money away.
Very unlikely that I will stay there again.",1,2024,08,16
150,Perfect location and outstanding service,"First of all the location is perfect - close enough to walk to all the attractions, dining, and shopping areas in Mayfair, Marylebone, Kensington, Soho, Covent Garden and even Westminster. And within easy walking distance to the Tube and Elizabeth line, all of London can be conveniently visited from this hotel. More importantly, the staff and guest relations team at this hotel is the friendliest and most helpful I've ever experienced. They go out of their way to ensure that you have a comfortable stay and make a genuine effort to earn your business so that you come back to this hotel for your next stay. Hyatt Churchill has been my first choice whenever I visit London. And the hotel has a fantastic Club Lounge and a great cocktail bar. Hyatt Globalists are always well taken care of.",5,2024,08,04
150,Chaotic grubby breakfast service. Annoying buzzing sound in room.,"Oh dear. Was a disappointing experience. Came here on points. The breakfast service was chaos, at one point there were 10+ tables full of dirty plates that hadnt been cleaned. Food crumbs all over the floor and chairs. When the watress was getting our table ready just sweeped crumbs onto the floor adding to the problem. My girldfriend had to clear crumbs off her seat before sitting down. Was honestly like a zoo.

The room was ok but very noise air conditioning. Even when off there was an irritating buzzing noise all night that eventually turned into white noise but could be bothersome to others.

I was expecting a lot more and left disappointed.",2,2024,08,04
150,Location,"A well located hotel close to tube,shopping area,restaurants and parks.Lovely reception area, well maintained comfortable bedroom and bathroom.Check in and check out efficient.Door staff most pleasant.We would certainly stay at this hotel again.",4,2024,07,31
150,I will be back to this great hotel.,"We stayed here mid June. We have stayed before so knew what to expect and our expectations were met and exceeded. Easy check in and out, excellent staff, good beds showers etc and a hearty breakfast.
We were on an 8 week holiday and I had left some important medication at home. Joe the concierge rang a pharmacy for me and arranged a replacement in less than an hour. Brilliant service. 
Located just off Oxford street we did a lot of walking.
We will be back.",5,2024,07,29
150,Luxury accomodations!,"Our family loved staying here! Excellent location, beautiful hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. ",5,2024,07,28
150,Perfect location. Perfect hotel,"It doesn't get much better than The Churchill Hotel at Portman Square. The rooms are cozy and immaculate. The staff are friendly and responsive. The room service food is simply outstanding. As for the location, shopping on New Bond Street or a walk over to Harrods are on your doorstep. Despite being in such a busy spot, the rooms are silent. What more could you want!",5,2024,07,28
150,Outstanding location and excellent service!,"We just got back from a week long stay with my wife and our teenage children at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill. To start, the location is excellent! Close enough to walk all the way to main tourist attractions (we walked all the way to the London Eye, walked back from our show in SoHo one night, etc) and the tube is nearby too. Taxis always lined up outside the hotel too. The hotel itself is excellent, very nice, high end finishes, well maintained, and most of all some of the most friendly and helpful Hyatt staff we have experienced. Lounge access is well worth the added cost. We had a Regency King Suite and a separate King bed room for our kids. Both were well maintained and comfortable. The Regency King Suite has a pull out sleeper sofa (even though that is not listed on the room description). We had a second room for the kids, so we didn’t need it, but it is there. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone coming to London. It is just a block away from the hustle and bustle so you get this peaceful hotel in a quiet block of the city and can still get to the action very quickly.",5,2024,07,23
150,Poor experience,"This hotel is overpriced and has many negative things. First, the doorman never opened any doors nor helped with the luggage. This is very weird and was if the hotel had no doormen at all! The check in staff was very robotic, creating an unpleasant experience (no thanks to Jonathan). Upon entering my room I was surprised because it was very outdated and smelly due to the old carpet and bathroom drains. After complaining, I was given another room but sadly had the same problem. Breakfast was below average. The only good thing was the gym.
Overall I paid way too much money for such a poor experience.",2,2024,07,20
150,BST Hyde Park 2024,"We enjoyed our extended weekend break at the Hyatt Churchill, the hotel being conveniently located relative Hyde Park BST.
Staff were really friendly and accommodating making our stay enjoyable.
Housekeeping was excellent and timely.
The room whilst compact was comfortable and clean.
We took advantage at the booking stage to include Club Access. However, we were disappointed with the offering at both breakfast and canapes, there being little or no change to the offering. For example, in the adult room cereal offering was two bowls of cornflakes and one bowl of chocopops. Our experience witnessed little or no take up of the cereal in this area and I would have thought either granola or meusli would be a better alternative for adults - chocopops for children yes, adults not really!
Compared with alternative hotels offering Club Access privaleges I would rate Hyatt at the very bottom.
Whilst we would stay at the hotel in the future the added cost for Club Access is not worth the it. 
",4,2024,07,17
150,great hotel and really nice atmosphere and service,"we have been one night and we felt really well treated.
thanks for the experience; we will repeat in other occasions. 
The service has been exceptional.",5,2024,07,16
150,Bhavesh,Great location but not good value for money. Dated rooms and poor food options. For a prime London location like this there needs to be better food options. Service in the restaurant is very slow.,3,2024,07,16
150,London trip- Churchill,"What a great property, clean, great food, great suit upgrade. Excellent lounge. The gym is average but all else is next level. ",5,2024,07,15
150,Great Stay,"We traveled to London with our two teenage children. This hotel was exactly what we needed- it was beautiful, comfortable, clean, quiet, and situated in a good area near great shopping and dining options.",5,2024,07,13
150,Excellent ,"Finishing up an excellent 6 night stay here. The club lounge is quaint and comfortable - a great place to relax and drink a coffee all day. Only weakness of CL is they don't offer ice tea. When I asked, they told me to make my own hot tea and gave me ice cubes. But aside from that, the CL is well stocked and nicely decorated

The breakfast for globalists is a choice in CL or in restaurant. The restaurant breakfast is a highlight and excellent. It's more like an Asian buffet than an American one, well stocked with lots of choice. Two thumbs up

I'm in a regency suite which I consider more like a junior suite as disappointingly there's no door between the bedroom and living room. This makes it tough as one of us sleeps late and one wakes up early - hence ample use of club lounge. Suite is on the smallish side but perfectly acceptable 

There was a terrible terrible terrible smell in the bathroom but housekeeping and maintenance fixed it and the hotel gave an unexpected but very appreciated service recovery 

Location is awesome in March Arch, just near Mayfair. Perfect for walking to Mayfair, Bond Street and Oxford street.

I'll definitely stay here again and recommend this place. If they invested a little more into hardware and software, I'd consider this a GH or potentially even a Park Hyatt. This will definitely be my go to in London from now on. ",5,2024,07,12
150,Best hotel ever,My daughter and I went to London to enjoy our favourite city. I have been to London many times. This hotel is by far my absolute favourite. The bed was extremely cozy and as I was a bit under the weather I was able to enjoy my rest and the city. The staff went out of their way to be kind. The bathroom was spectacular.  ,5,2024,07,10
150,Lovely old hotel,"What a beautiful hotel! The staff was so friendly and helpful especially the staff at the front desk and concierge desk. The rooms were so comfortable and clean. The clientele was very diverse and it seemed like a lot of business people. We were a family traveling together to London for a vacation. The morning breakfast at the hotel was so varied and delicious. Juices were hand squeezed and all fruit seemed fresh cut. The staff in the restaurant were all lovely. We had to grab breakfast to go one morning and they were so helpful in getting us packed up and out for our tour!
Great experience!",5,2024,07,07
150,Horrible in every possible way…avoid if possible,"So we stayed in this hotel from 28june - 2july.
The rooms were dated and not what has been potrayed on website.
The service has been horrible.
No body bothers even if you complaint about the same.
We had told at front desk to Mr. Julian that the rooms are not same as shown in website and our travel agent also mailed them multiple times but no one even bothered checking upon us. What we received from the front desk was just “i know what you mean “ and then no action was taken regarding the same.
The breakfast buffet spread was nothing special.
Many glitches and slow service there also.
They broke our baby’s bottle too.
The only highlight was the hotel housekeeping staff was little sensitive and when complained about the cleanliness they made sure room was clean enough and had sent flowers and body products as gesture.
We had family room connected together with kids.
Attaching pictures of what dated room it was",2,2024,07,07
150,Summer holiday,Beautiful property and ambiance. The staff are phenomenal and we all had the best of time. Cannot wait to visit again! ,5,2024,07,03
150,Pleasant and relaxing stay,"Our rooms were comfortable and recently updated.  Staff were all very helpful from checkin, concierge, housekeeping, door, restaurant to checkout.  A wonderful place to stay and would return on our future plans to London.",5,2024,06,30
150,Disappointing front desk experience at Hyatt Regency London -The Churchill,"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency London Churchill and, unfortunately, my experience with the front desk staff left much to be desired.
My family and I enjoyed London so much that we decided to extend  our stay for one more night before heading to Paris. I called the reservation desk to confirm the one night extension in the same room. When I approached the front desk , I was told that I had to change my room for the additional night due to high occupancy.  I politely requested that we stay in the same room since it was for one more night after having stayed 7 nights. The  duty manager was rude and insisted I was inflexible. He then walked away without a resolution.  My wife and I were shocked at his rude remarks.  The overall demeanor of the front desk staff lacked the professionalism and courtesy one would expect from a Hyatt property. 

While the Hyatt Regency London Churchill offers a prime location and comfortable accommodation, the poor service at the front desk significantly impacted my stay. I hope that the management will address these issues to ensure future guests receive the level of service expected from a hotel of this standing. Unfortunately, based on my recent experience, I cannot recommend this hotel until improvements are made.",2,2024,06,30
150,Excellent,"Excellent property
Excellent staff
Excellent location.
Breakfast was great but very busy.
Club lounge was very nice.",5,2024,06,29
150,London family trip,Booked the “ family “ room for 5 . Was told can accommodate family of 5. The family room turns out to be 2 simple connecting rooms with two double beds linked together that can be separated into four beds but had to have a small rollaway. The rooms were also in front of elevator bay and very loud. Overall expensive as well as it was inferred to me that this was a larger 2 rooms for a family and it is definitely not.,4,2024,06,29
150,Disappointing Experience with Poor Service and Billing Issues,"I recently stayed at Hyatt Regency London The Churchill and had a very disappointing experience.

Upon arriving at the hotel, my family and I had three large suitcases and several smaller bags. Despite this, no one, including the bellboys, offered to assist us. Even when we carried our luggage into the lobby, several staff members near the concierge did not offer any help.

Furthermore, despite arriving at the designated check-in time of 3 PM, our room was not ready. After a long journey of over 15 hours with my 10-year-old child, I was eager to get to our room and rest. However, it was not until nearly 5 PM that we were finally able to check-in. The reason given was that a guest with the highest membership level, Globalist, from the Hyatt hotel's membership program had not yet checked out. This explanation was unacceptable and did not justify the significant delay. I was not the only one facing this issue; another family from LA also experienced a similar delay. This suggests a systemic problem with the hotel’s operations.

Additionally, upon reviewing my credit card statement after my stay, I discovered a charge that was nearly £200 more than the amount I confirmed at checkout. I cannot understand how such discrepancies occur. Although I discussed these issues with the hotel manager during my stay, having to address the credit card problem even after returning home is an experience no guest should have to endure.

These problems, coupled with other issues I faced during my stay, have left a very negative impression. I hope the hotel management will address these concerns seriously and take the necessary steps to prevent such incidents from happening to future guests.

Given this experience, I cannot recommend this hotel to others.",1,2024,06,26
150,"Pricey for the rooms, but an excellent hotel in a terrific location.","The hotel is in such a great location directly across from the lovely Portman Square and just a few blocks from Oxford Street and Marble Arch.  The buffet breakfast is one of the best we have ever experienced and the dining staff were incredibly nice and helpful.  The rooms are adequate and clean, and the cleaning and service staff were quite efficient.",5,2024,06,24
150,"Good Service, Room was ""Worn""","We were looking forward to our stay at the 5-star Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill. The lobby was very nice (although a bit of an awkward layout). Check-in was good, but the room was in poor condition -- dinged and scratched furniture, cracked caulk in the bathroom, stain on floor -- not what we would expect from a 5-star Hyatt property. We brought this to the attention of the staff, and they acknowledged the issues and explained that rooms are going through an upgrading process. They offered an upgraded room on the second day, but we chose not to move to a new room. They offered other compensation for the inconvenience and we were satisfied. A special shoutout to Divya, who handled our issue. She was a true professional and did everything she could to make our stay comfortable. Concierge lounge meals and service were excellent. Staff were overall friendly and helpful. Would recommend the hotel based on the service we received, but the room itself was average (although the bed was VERY comfortable). The upgraded rooms are better, and I assume all rooms will eventually be upgraded.",4,2024,06,22
150,Superb hotel & great location in London's Mayfair,"We stayed at the hotel, after reading endless reviews and having stayed at several other hotels in the past in London, most falling short of expectations. This hotel made us swoon.  From our room to the club-level amenities to the unique offering by the mixologist, we were truly delighted.",5,2024,06,22
150,One of the best hotel rooms in a great location,"One of the best hotel rooms from visiting many cities. Very spacious and cozy. Staff were helpful and very professional. The hotel is in one of the best locations in London close to shopping, and lifestyle experiences. And Hyde Park is only a minute away. ",5,2024,06,19
150,Perfect EVERYTHING,"Everything was great - Location - Staff - Food, but more important, the way they treat you, always professional and considerate of your needs!! ",5,2024,06,17
150,Early breakfast hours,"This hotel is nice but my biggest complaint about it remains early end to breakfast in the hotel restaurant. I don't why they end the breakfast so early! The most disappointing part of our stay was the very early breakfast hours. There is always a line of people waiting to get in before it closes. They should start the breakfast an hour later and extended to be an hour later - especially during the busy summer travel season! Everyone that stays at this hotel is on holiday and most people enjoy sleeping in. Management should take note of their customer preferences and extend the breakfast hours. The breakfast area gets packed at the end when everyone rushes in to get something to eat before they start taking down the buffet. Other than that, the hotel is in a great location and service is pleasant.",3,2024,06,15

150,Great location,This was a great place to stay. Everyone was welcoming and accommodating. Great service and polite staff. The lounge was great for afternoon snack. ,5,2024,06,12
150,Good hotel,"The hotel was really good. The room was nice with clean bed, a clean fridge and a clean microwave. The breakfast was good with eggs and waffles that you can make in waffle makers that they provide. They also have hot sausages. Would recommend this hotel.",5,2024,06,05
150,Good Experience @Hyatt Regency  London The Churchill,"I am still experiencing but so far we are happy with Tess at the reception she was fine at the check-in and Ashok at the breakfast was very polite and careful and the bellboy at the entrance was fine too 

The bathroom at the rooms could be larger and the bucket set is not good enough for this hotel otherwise the comfort of the beds and pillows are good",5,2024,06,05
150,Great Location for mixing Business/Shopping purposes,The Rooms are spacious and kept well mantained whilst offering an excellent location to access different parts of London  ,4,2024,06,04
150,High style hotel,"High style hotel with good location in front of Portman square, also the hotel is nearby Oxford street and Hyde park ",5,2024,05,31
150,Worst Hotel In Marlybone,"The Churchill exemplifies everything travelers do not have to put up with anymore in London. The food is terrible, the bathrooms badly outdated, the air conditioning does not work--there is no changing temperature--and the lounge overcrowded and poorly set up, making the overcrowding seem even worse. I have stayed in every hotel in Marble Arch/Marlybone area and ALL are better, especially as regards value, than Churchill. The owner--and Hyatt needs to get on board-- needs to bite the bullet and upgrade to 2020's level accomodations.",1,2024,05,31
150,"very pleasant stay, as always before","we would like to thank the entire staff for their kindness and friendliness, especially Mr. Renato Cecini and his front desk team. I hope we will have the opportunity to stay at your hotel again soon",5,2024,05,28

150,London Vacation,Our visit to London for our 30th Anniversary and vacation was fabulous.  The Hyatt Regency London Churchill is a great place to stay.  The Regency Club is also a terrific place to relax and grab some light food and drink.  Thank you.,5,2024,05,25
150,Great location - could do with some renovations,"Stayed here during a quick weekend trip - was given a room at 9am which was highly appreciated as a Globalist. 

The rooms were in good condition but can definitely use some touch ups - my room (211) had some incorrect curtain installation such that they cannot close completely to block out the sun - which is quite weird given I surely wasn't the first guest to stay there

The Regency Club on the 8th floor was decent - extremely crowded during breakfast time with a very limited offering - staff were friendly but clearly overwhelmed by the number of guests there. I revisited during the evening hours and it was much more civilised, quiet and great to hang out after a long day out

The breakfast on ground floor was equally busy - with queues forming in the early morning (8-ish am). Food offering was ostensibly stronger than the Club and was not bad at all

Overall not a bad hotel given it's superior location - will return for the right price in the future",4,2024,05,21
150,Enjoyed our stay!,"Fantastic location - so close to great restaurants, shopping and the tube. Service was amazing - particularly the concierges who went out of their way to book theatre tickets, spa appointments and provided helpful tips on navigating London. We booked a suite and it was helpful to have a separate area from our bedroom  but it was very compartmentalized so it still felt like a small space.  Overall we very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend.",4,2024,05,20
150,A return after 11 years proves disappointing,"In general, hotels aren't what they used to be and there's no better example of this condition than The Churchill. After 11 years since my list visit, was eager for a two night stay after sailing to Europe. However, like other hotels were I have used points during the past year, the room we were provided was dark, the window faced an exhaust vent, the request for a quiet room was met with being placed next to a laundry service area where the staff let the door bang throughout the morning, there was no room service offered, we were charged 15 pounds for one and a half cups of coffee, double the price for larger servings at Shot, down the street. The bar has restrictions on using a laptop even though we weren't using sound and wanted to make reservations for Brussels. On the positive side, the experience at the restaurant for dinner was quite impressive in terms of quantity and quality of the food, the concierge desk is top notch and exceeded expectations, and Rama, the door man, is a treasure. He directed us to a little breakfast shop around the corner that became our regular morning routine.",3,2024,05,19
150,Really poor - nowhere near a 5 star experience,"Rooms are very outdated. Not a 5 star experience in any way. Quality of food at breakfast was very poor. Doormen operating but not sure why they are there. They certainly don’t open doors. Staff generally seem under qualified and incapable. I have previously been a platinum Hyatt card holder, and used to feel like I was treated like royalty. Now it feels like a travel lodge.

However, my biggest complaint is then the outrageous “discretionary service charge” that was added at the end of my stay. I tried to check out online and there was no way to remove this totally unwarranted extra charge. Daylight robbery. It forced me to check out at the desk and enter into an embarrassing conversation with the receptionist. These charges should be illegal in my opinion, and are nothing more than an unofficial tax. 

I made my feelings quite clear at checkout and asked him to pass my complaint on to management. Whilst he was polite, I am sure this will not have happened.

I will not, nor any of my business employees, be staying at the Churchill again.",1,2024,05,19
150,Beautiful and convenient,Wonderful hotel centrally located near the Marble Arch. Walking distance or short train ride to many point of interests. Hotel Staff and service was excellent and they were able to anticipate our needs. The garden green space across the street is a beautiful space to enjoy a calming green space outside in the middle of the city. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2024,05,17
150,Great Family-friendly hotel and Amazing Club Lounge,"We stayed here during Spring Break 2024 with my husband and 3 kids. This is one of the best Hyatts we have ever stayed at. From the moment we checked-in, we received such great service from Tomas and Divya. Our rooms were close to the Club lounge and they brought us a rollaway bed before we even asked for one. My kids loved stopping by the lounge for candy and drinks. On the first day, they left coloring books for the kids, as well as bathrobes and slippers for the kids. They also sent some snacks to the room.

We visited the Club nightly for drinks and heavy snacks - on a few nights, that was our dinner. We also loved the downstairs buffed breakfast and there was a huge selection. My kids have food allergies and the staff was very helpful with checking ingredients.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to London who wants a central location. The staff couldn't have been better, the Globalist benefits were amazing and we really felt like the Churchill was our home away from home. We will gladly stay there on future trips.",5,2024,05,16
150,A pleasant stay at the Churchill Hyatt Regency in London,"Amazing staff members and great location. Many places within walking distance to visit near the hotel. My family and I were greeted with a warm welcome. Overall, my stay was amazing and I am sure I will be back again.",5,2024,05,15

150,Sisters trip!,"3 of us traveled from New York for a 4 day trip to london. location of this hotel was excellent, taxis available right outside. we stayed in the suite and that was great! pullout couch could have been more comfortable- I slept on it twice in a row and that backfired, we would’ve been better off rotating who sleeps on that nightly. otherwise an excellent hotel and trip! canapés and breakfast at the club definitely saved us time and money!",5,2024,05,13
150,24 hour room service!,"Checked in late after a late flight and was starving - only to be told that there’s 24 hour room service! Food was very good and selection is good too. Not just hot dogs and finger food - I got a started, proper main and desert last midnight within 20 minutes to my room. Very impressed. Hotel is also very clean and much much nicer than similar priced hotels without a 10 minute radius. Highly recommend.",5,2024,05,09
150,Great Hotel and Great location to Oxford street and surround restaurants and attractions.Two close tube stations,"Staff and service levels here are great from the doorman to the restaurants always helpful and friendly. At breakfast their is something for everyone. Close to the tube,taxi rank outside plus walking distance to Oxford street and Marble Arch. Great place to stay.",5,2024,05,06
150,Wonderful Stay,"Perfect location (5 min walk to Selfridges, 10 min walk to Hyde Park or the center of Mayfair) and also walkable (about half an hour walk) to Buckingham Palace.

The staff at this property took pride in catering to the needs of the guest. From the moment I arrived at the property’s driveway, I was greeted by the courteous bellman. A special thank you to Joana and Olga from the Front Office for their professionalism and assistance. 

A quiet Club Room in the corner was assigned which offered tranquility. The guest room was not large by American standards but spacious enough for one. The bed was comfortable and amenities were great - esp the Molton Brown bath amenities. 

The Club Lounge was on the same floor as the guest room and offered a great assortment of drinks, light food to afternoon desserts. Overall, it was a wonderful stay.",5,2024,05,05
150,Cigarette smoke,"We stayed here in May 2023 and did not have an issue, but cigarette smoke was a negative factor this year.  The room that we were originally given had a strong smell of cigarette smoke originating from another room.  We were moved to a different room and floor, but could smell smoke from the adjoining room throughout our stay.  Evidentially, the no smoking rule is not enforced, or the penalty is not large enough to dissuade smokers.",2,2024,05,05
150,"Short one night visit, using reward points","One night stay
What I liked 
1. Near Paddington station, a 30 minute walk if you are up to it
2. Nice lounge.  In fact , two lounges, one of which is adult only
3. Great breakfast and dinner.  The chia pudding at breakfast is really nice
4. As a globalist, I was upgraded to a suite, which was nice
5. Minibar is half full, leaving you space to put your own items in the mini fridge 
6. Nice coffee machine in the room
7. The staff were generally friendly and competent.  They have additional front desk people on the 8th floor were the lounge is
8. Plenty of taxis are always waiting upfront

What I did not like
1. I only received my upgrade after I asked for it",5,2024,05,05
150,Great Place To Stay,This is a great hotel in a really nice area of London plus it's walking to all the sights. Staying at the Hyatt Churchill feels like your in a London storybook. Its a wonderful experience/ hotel.  ,5,2024,05,01

Staff were welcoming all the time with a smile.
Loopy needs more innovation and redesign to give further value.",4,2024,04,30
150,Tad bit expensive but worth it,"I had to book a hotel for some urgent matter and hotel prices were appalling. I found this place as a ‘getaway deal’ but still expensive for a night. I’d say for the location, service provided, cleanliness and (personal situation on this occasion) it was worth the price. I felt safe, amazing ambience, witnessed appropriate clientele. Thanks ",5,2024,04,25
150,Wonderful!,"My cousin and I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill for 9 nights . We are world travelers who have stayed at the finest hotels . The Hyatt Churchill ranks with the best. Every staff member went above and beyond for us. At check in our requests were accommodated by the friendly front desk staff. Our 7th floor room was spacious, quiet, and kept immaculate by the wonderful housekeeping staff. Breakfast was delicious, plentiful and varied and the staff there was always attentive and pleasant.  The bellmen always greeted us warmly and asked if we needed a taxi, etc.  Marco and his colleagues at the Churchill Bar were  lovely and kept us hydrated after our long days exploring the sites around London.

Finally, many thanks to Frank, Ricardo, Cezary, Jose, Claudio, and Paulo from the Concierge team.  They organized our day trips , provided directions, and reserved theater and dinners at various restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

We look forward to returning to the Hyatt Regency Churchill in the near future.",5,2024,04,24
150,Clean and central hotel in London.,Very clean hotel with wonderful comfortable beds. The bathroom was very good but all too easy for the shower to leak water onto the floor no matter how much care was taken.  Perhaps some hot chocolate sachets rather than more powdered coffee would have been appreciated.  Rooms were very quiet. ,5,2024,04,24
150,Nice hotel but pricey,"The hotel was very nice and clean. The staff were friendly and professional. However, for overall value it was extremely overpriced. ",4,2024,04,21
150,Amazing hotel and location,"This hotel was top shelf.  The hotel was in a great location. Not in the central part of the city but still close enough. It was wonderful from cleanliness, location and the entire staff was welcoming and friendly. ",5,2024,04,20
150,Excellent Stay at Churchill,I stayed 6 nights at the Churchill. The experience was excellent overall. Cannot find fault with anything right from check in till check out.

150,Excellent value for Hyatt member,"As a Hyatt Globalist the hotel staff treat you very well.  Early arrival and late checkouts are accommodated.  Club floor has excellent beverages and food early evening and breakfast.  Passing out unique hors d’oeuvres was a nice touch too. No need to use restaurant, but it was great too.  Our room was very quiet with extra glass.  Attentive service without asking.",5,2024,04,12
150,Great location!,"Will stay here again! The hotel is super centric with Marble Arch tube station just around the corner, the room was very comfortable and with a beautiful view of the park (loved this!), breakfast was delicious and had everything you might think of, the staff was friendly and diligent.",5,2024,03,30
150,Fantastic as always,I’ve been staying at the Churchill since 1976 -  yes almost 50 years - the renovations have been fantastic.  I’ve stayed with and without kids … and almost every stay is great.  Room good.  Location great.  Staff always helpful.  Only let down is breakfast can be a bit of a zoo during the peak period. ,5,2024,03,26
150,How is this 5*?,"Really not impressed. The price per room is crazy for that you get. 
Some children got a little Paddington bear on arrival and a welcome. My child got nothing. 

I reached out to the hotel before I arrived to ensure I had a cot in my room. On three separate occasions they confirmed this. Despite all of this, when I arrived, no cot. 
I dropped my luggage off 2 hours before I checked in. This was not in my room when I did check in.
I had to call them to bring it up along with the cot, twice. 

I left early in the morning as I had some business nearby. I left my wife and child in the hotel and they were checking themselves out a little later and heading to another hotel. I went and told concierge to ensure they are helped to their car and luggage is collected. 
They had to wait ages for the luggage then one of the staff said to my wife “”wow I can’t believe he is leaving you, that is not loyal”. 

It’s meant to be a 5* hotel. Why can’t my adult wife and child be left there without me? 
Very poor for the money. Average hotel.",2,2024,03,23
150,Great Hotel in the heart of London.,"My family of 4 people spent 5 wonderful days at the Hyatt Regency Churchill in London. The accommodation was lovely, we had a beautiful garden-view room.  The bed mattress was very comfortable. The rooms were spacious, clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, and quiet. The restaurant and lounge downstairs offered a great selection of delicious food. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The location of the hotel is perfect.  It is close to major tourist attractions and several bus/ tube stations. Definitely a five star hotel!!",5,2024,03,21

150,Nice hotel,Walking distance to Hyde Park with excellent customer service and very friendly staff.   Can use a little bit more variety in the breakfast but otherwise all good.   There is a lovely Italian restaurant below as well.,5,2024,03,09
150,Excellent location!,"1st time in London. The hotel is in a great location. Easily walkable to Oxford and Regent street. The staff could not have been more professional and friendly. Special shout-out to the doorman who greeted me everyday.

Rooms are standard for a European hotel, but extremely clean and comfortable. There are TONS of ports and sockets to plug in your devices everywhere in the room. One interesting thing to note is that the lighting controls in the room were great - you could turn off all the lights in the room from the side of the bed. I also found the hotel to be extremely quiet.

If my travels were to take me back to London, I would definitely consider staying here again.",5,2024,03,09
150,Very Good Hotel in Excellent Location,"The Churchill is an excellent hotel with warm and hospitable staff who go out of their way to make guests feel welcomed and valued. It is in a fantastic location, within walking distance of many of London's major attractions and a major underground tube station. I was upgraded to a room with a view of Portman Square Garden, which was wonderful, but the room lacked a desk, making it rather difficult to work on my laptop. However, aside from that, the room was very comfortable. I definitely plan to return to the property.",5,2024,03,06

150,It has tooo bad staff 😖,THE WOREST .. This hotel was my first choice in London for more than 10 years until Covid time. but it seems that the staff has changed. to be today this hotel is one of the WOREST hotels in London. and is no an option at all. I am now on my second day of 14 days booked BUT I am thinking about (not to not come again) ..!! to Cancel the remaining days to leave this hotel ASAP.,1,2024,02,24

150,GREAT TEMPORARY HOME AWAY FROM HOME,"The Hyatt Churchill exceeded all of our expectations. Location, emenities, service, comfort and a great bar. This was the perfect home for us this week. We were walking distance to many great pubs and restaurants. Short cab ride to all the hot London locations like the EYE, Palace, The Tower and many more. World class shopping was also right around the corner. Price was very competitive. 

We travel to Europe at least twice a year, this hotel ranks right up there with our favorites.

Love it!",5,2024,02,18
150,Great Hotel!! Fantastic stay!!,"Great staff. Delicious food. Amazingly central location. We love the Churchill. 
This is my 4th stay in 2 years and they upgraded us to a suite (for our wedding anniversary). They provided us the convenience of a late check out (4pm) which was wonderful for us. 
Oh yes, the sheets were soft and luxurious. After a 9-hour flight we felt welcome and “loved” (as much as a hotel can love you). ",5,2024,02,12

150,Energy and tranquility,"This is my fourth stay at this hotel on work trips to London. It’s an excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I really appreciate when you are in the guestroom of a hotel, and you have silence. It bothers me when you hear the elevator, or the neighbors, or the opening and closing of doors in the corridor. But this is a nice quality and quiet hotel. That doesn’t mean that there’s not a bustling lobby, and wonderful attached restaurant. The bar - The Churchill Bar - that is at the end of the lobby is an elegant and classic London bar. The hotel is very close to the Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations and near a collection of excellent restaurants. So the location is really, wonderful.",5,2024,01,30
150,Simply the best,"From the time we entered the hotel until the time we left, we were treated like kings.  Staff were amazing, really lovely, polite and helpful.  Room was clean and well equipped, Churchills cocktail bar and staff were amazing.  Easily the best hotel I’ve been to in London.",5,2024,01,21
150,"Comfortable stay, but a bit expensive","Stayed 6 nights in the King Suite or Balcony Suite ($1,100/night)

Room was nice but there was a smell in the hallway to the room, I’m not sure what it is but it smells like old food. Bed was probably one of the most comfortable bed and pillow that we’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Whole suite was a bit smaller than what I imagined for $1,100/night but I guess London is just that expensive

PROS:
-very comfortable bed & pillow
-delicious breakfast
-shoutout to Joao (assistant restaurant manager) who made us feel special during our whole stay
-club lounge food was decent
-gym was decent
-toiletries smell good

CONS:
-expensive for the size of the room you get
-there is an “old food” smell in the hallway to our suite (9th floor)",5,2024,01,21
150,room size is small,Excellent overall but the room is small comparing with the nearest hotels prices you must review the sale price so we can stay more or at least to have fare price again all things it is perfect other thing your elevators must modified because it is so old and also take long time if you need to use it  ,4,2024,01,19
150,Overall the quality is quite good,"same as my previous experience from Hyatt, quite good experence visiting & stay here, but as remember, there is no turn down service. as a Cat 5 hotel, I expected there is a turn down service in my stay. ",4,2024,01,11

Rooms very nice, welcome drink and snacks. Nice touch.

150,Fantastic Service!,"I have spent the best time at the hotel as it one of the best hotels in London.
Further, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the security guard Leon! For being so supportive, helpful and kind. 
I lost my mobile phone, he helped me call my network provider and block my phone, He absolutely turned a completely stressful moment to a more positive one. 
He also informed me to visit the Apple Store and when I buy a new phone they would restore my contents. He is really amazing! It’s such a pleasure to come to Hyatt with staff like this that go the extra mile to help and support.",5,2024,01,04

150,Home away from home !,Very nice hotel … one of the best locations in London.. as always it has very high standards and make you feel at home… gym is renovated and made bigger .. area is quite and in close proximity to   Oxford street which is the best shopping street in town,5,2024,01,01
150,Great Location,I truly loved the location and I wish I remembered the doorman’s name but he was so delightful to my daughter but the rest of the staff barely even spoke. The price wasn’t worth the room size and the atmosphere.,3,2023,12,28

150,"Great location, great stay.","Excellent stay! The Churchill is located near Hyde Park. It is close enough to the tourist attractions but far enough away from the crowds. There was always a cab available in front of the hotel and we never had to wait. 

I am a light sleeper so we asked for a quiet room and they delivered. A huge bonus was our room had double pane windows so we didn’t hear any outside noise at all. The heater ran steadily, quietly and kept the room at a consistently comfortable temperature. 

The bed was very comfortable There was a minor problem with a broken appliance but they came up right away and fixed it and then replaced the item the next day while we were out. 

Staff were wonderful. Special thanks to Olga for going the extra mile to make our stay special.",5,2023,12,27

150,Cutting corners,"Cheap freeze dried coffee and cheap tea in the rooms - a small saving for the hotel in return for a terrible customer experience in a relatively expensive room price per night of £500+ . Breakfast was mediocre at best, again it is clear the hotel is pinching pennies but unfortunately it just doesn’t go unnoticed in central London. Otherwise room was clean and comfortable  and staff were friendly. But overall I wouldn’t stay again. ",3,2023,12,21

150,Very Dissappointing !,"This is our 4th stay in London churchill . It’s the first ever time we experience such a bad service and experience overall !
Rooms weren’t cleaned properly and things were scattered around , you will only notice that the bed is done , and worst among all , bed Linens not being changed , it’s a five star hotel , what am I paying for ?!
If you don’t have the sign for privacy on your door , staff will open the door and say “ Room service “ , seriously ?!
One of the ridiculous things that I’ve never experienced in any 5 star hotels around the world , when you order from room service , they charge you for the tray 7 pounds ?! I’ve called and asked why ? You will take back the tray , the answer was “ this is the hire policy , on every order , we charge 7 pounds non refundable for the tray even though we will take it back .
After all this , upon check out , I’ve noticed few charges “ ………..” I’ve asked the receptionist, what is this charge for , she answered it’s for staff service and it’s optional , if you want to take it out , you may “ why do you even add a charge , what if someone didn’t check the final bill !! This is truly unprofessional for a well known 5 star hotel ! .
Very disappointing!",1,2023,12,17

150,Hyatt Regency Churchill London: Mixed Experience with Room for Improvement  During my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency C,"During my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill London, I had a mixed experience, highlighting both positives and areas in need of improvement. While the hotel had an upscale ambiance and cleanliness, there were notable issues with regular maintenance, quality of amenities, and the delivery of benefits for Hyatt program members.

Firstly, I encountered problems with the bathroom bidet, which were not resolved despite repeated stays. The air conditioning system also had issues during one stay, resulting in discomfort at night. These maintenance issues should be given priority for a more seamless guest experience.

Furthermore, the quality of provided soap and shampoo fell below expectations for a hotel of this caliber. Upgrading these amenities would enhance the overall luxurious experience.

Lastly, as a Hyatt program member, I did not receive a warm welcome or a room upgrade during my stay. Improving the recognition and fulfillment of benefits for program members would create a more personalized and valued experience.

In conclusion, the Hyatt Regency Churchill London offers a mixed experience. Addressing maintenance issues, upgrading amenities, and improving benefits for Hyatt program members would greatly enhance guest satisfaction.",3,2023,12,06
150,Disappointed and certainly not a 5*hotel,"ts location is superb, but having said that, it certainly isn't a 5* hotel as advertised.  Upon making the reservation I requested an early check-in as the flight arrived very early in the morning.  And per my request also, the concierge made private transportation arrangements.
When we arrived the driver was nowhere to be found.  It took 20 minutes and a call to the transportation company to finally locate him.  Furthermore, when we got to the hotel. we were informed that our room would NOT be ready for a few hours.  When we asked if they had a bag room where we could leave our bags or a lounge where we could wait, they said NO!  This after an almost 10 hr flight!
The hotel needs to be brought up to the 21 century.  New light switches, new rugs, new digital coffeemakers, new check-out systems.  Having the guest make the check-out at the front desk nowadays is preposterous!   The email we received of a supposedly 'express check-out' without a bill attached to it is honestly, laughable.  
The rooms and bathrooms are tiny.

150,Go for the breakfast,"Stayed at this property several times. It’s clean and well run with a nice club lounge that serves food and drinks. The location is near Marble Arch tube station. Edgeware road and Oxford street, hence lots of shopping nearby. Rooms are not large but the suites can be. Mine was nice sized and had the most incredible bed. Best I’ve ever slept on. The real star here is the breakfast buffet. Delicious and fresh. The full English breakfast will make you glad you chose the hotel. Very, very good.",5,2023,11,29

We look forward to coming again soon!",5,2023,11,28
150,Unacceptable Experience,"Hotel thinks they are better than any other Hyatt in the world. In fact they are the worst. All promises that they gave prior to check in never came true. For a hotel not to care about  flight delays, being the highest Hyatt status and family needs is really sad. Will never recommend this property to anyone and recommend you be very careful when booking here. ",1,2023,11,23
150,Best 5 star near Oxford street,"The rooms are a bit small, especially the bathroom, but it’s nicely renovated. The bed is very comfy. The breakfast is very good.

150,A hotel that feels like home,"By the second night, when our group talked about going back to the hotel for the evening, we were saying “let’s go home”. For a very frequent traveler who has stayed at hotels all across the world, it’s very rare to refer to my hotel as home. But that is exactly how the Churchill felt. The staff is very friendly and professional. When we first arrived they were warm and attentive and thought about all of our needs. Our room was beautiful, classy, and clean. It was a welcome retreat every evening coming in from the London rain and cold. The breakfast buffet each morning was delicious and had plenty of items to choose from. The club was one of the best I have seen. 

Staying at the Churchill was one of the highlights of our trip and I highly recommend it to any traveler looking for an amazing hotel experience in a very convenient location in the great city of London.",5,2023,11,14

150,What a great hotel in London,Great hotel. Excellent air-air conditioning; Best buffet breakfast ever. Great lounges. Fantastic front desk services. Unlimited supply of bottle water. Good location. Totally worthy of its high fare. Highly recommended.,5,2023,11,04
150,All Quiet in London,"Being Australians, we know we live in the centre of the world.  Yes, we’re 24 hours from anywhere.  So, after such a lengthy flight, one needs rest and quiet to shake-off jetlag.  And The Churchill delivered that in spades!

We stayed in a Regency Suite King which had Club Lounge access.

As with all good hotels it comes down to the staff to make it great.  And the great staff in the Club Lounge were - Zareen, Viktoria, Nabell & Teni

And one mustn’t leave out the great staff of the Churchill Bar - Marco & Daphne
Then there was the ever helpful and friendly Doorman - Abdel

150,A very average stay at best!,"There are far better 5 star hotels in London than the Hyatt Regency Churchill.
Travelling with my wife and 16 year old daughter. When booking it clearly states that any person over the age of 13 is considered an adult by the hotel and full adult price for the room applies which we paid. However on entering the bar in the evening my 16 year old daughter who was accompanying us was asked for id to have a Diet Coke. The bar staff advised that the bar is for over 18's only and we were asked to leave. (9.30pm) 
Having stayed in many hotels in and around London this is a new one for me. I spoke to the hotel Manager who confirmed the rule and directed me to their website where she stated it was clear for all guests to see. I don't think so!
The Breakfast was possibly the worst I've had in any Hotel anywhere. The selection of food, the choice, the quality, the service and the location which is like a walk through foyer to the toilets and rear exit of the hotel. 
If you would like a genuine 4/5 star hotel stay in London I would highly recommend you consider the Rosewood Holborn or Chesterfield Mayfair for a far superior stay for the similar cost. ",2,2023,10,31
150,My worst stay in London,The worst place to stay in London. The front desk are extremely rude and unfriendly rooms are dark small and smelly. Used to be a nice place to stay many years ago. It’s run down and old service is non existent. I stayed there on July of 2022 for 4 days I arrived early in the morning and had requested an early check in but upon my arrival the rude women at front desk totally ignored my request had to wait 5 hours for my room to be ready. They gave me a very small room at the end of the hallway. The room service was terrible and I always had to call to have my room cleaned or get clean towels. Please avoid staying at this overpriced dirty hotel,1,2023,10,30

150,A Mixed but Memorable Stay in the Heart of London,"My recent stay at the Hyatt Regency The Churcil in downtown London was a mixed experience, but there were definitely some highlights worth mentioning. First and foremost, the hotel's location is fantastic – it's incredibly well-situated for exploring the heart of London. The convenience of this prime location made it easy to travel around the downtown area and access many of the city's attractions.

One of the minor drawbacks of my stay was the room size. Admittedly, it was somewhat small, but I understand that space comes at a premium in a bustling city like London. Considering the urban setting, the room size was acceptable and didn't significantly detract from my overall experience.

The hotel's facilities, on the other hand, left a bit to be desired. Some areas appeared a little shabby and could benefit from renovation or maintenance. Notably, the water pressure in the shower was disappointingly weak, which was reminiscent of my college dormitory days. This aspect certainly didn't meet the expectations one might have for a 5-star establishment.

However, the standout feature of my stay was the exceptional service provided by the Club Lounge staff and the bell desk staff. Their friendliness and attentiveness added a positive dimension to my visit, making me feel valued as a guest. The dedication of these staff members truly set The Churcil apart and made my stay more enjoyable.

Moreover, the dining experience at the hotel was outstanding. The breakfast restaurant and the Club Lounge both offered an array of amazing food choices. I was consistently impressed by the quality and variety of dishes available. These culinary offerings were a delightful highlight of my stay and a testament to the hotel's commitment to providing a memorable dining experience.

Additionally, I appreciated the hotel's approach to amenities, with bulk-sized products in the rooms. This eco-friendly choice aligns with the current ESG trends, demonstrating the hotel's commitment to sustainability and reducing waste. It's heartening to see an establishment of this caliber making conscious efforts to be environmentally responsible.

In conclusion, while there were some areas of improvement, such as the room size, dated facilities, and weak shower water pressure, the Hyatt Regency The Churcil managed to leave a positive impression. This was largely due to the outstanding service from the Club Lounge and bell desk staff and the remarkable dining options. The hotel's consideration of ESG trends in its amenities also contributed to a somewhat positive overall experience.",4,2023,10,24
150,Excellent,"Amazing hotel, everything was very nice, location is perfect, quality of breakfast was very very nice with a lot of varieties. Housekeeping was always up to the standard, staff was very welcoming and helpful all the time.  ",5,2023,10,24

150,London not so 5 star ,"We were on the second floor. We could hear music from the wedding below, people on this floor were very loud, too many slamming doors. 
If you stay, ask for a higher floor so you don’t hear the cars below. The hotel was ok but not a 5 star. Imagine a note saying they would change your towels every 3 days??? That’s not 5 star! ",2,2023,10,21

The staff have been gracious, warm, professional, welcoming and kind. 

We misplaced a wallet and the hotel went up a security person to come chat with us and help look for the wallet. I’m speaking with him it helped us figure out where we may have lost it.

Everyone is so friendly and we feel that this is our home away from home. We will be back and recommend to all of our friends and family whom plan on visiting London to stay here! ",5,2023,10,21
150,Amazing birth trip,"What a fantastic stay, made special by Olga who arranged birthday balloons, cake and an upgrade for the occasion.

Only negative was breakfast in the restaurant as it was too busy.  Would love to stay again.",5,2023,10,18
150,Disappointed,"Nice location
Clean rooms

Absolutely aweful view; can't even open the window for a fresh air because of the loud noises of this machine (no noise if the window is kept closed though) 
And kept the curtain closed at all times because of the crappy view

I love Churchill hotel and my family and I are regular guests at the hotel, but my last stay was very disappointing, spaces with such views shall be kept for services/kitchen/laundry: store etc.. and not as rooms for hotel residents.. what waste of money",2,2023,10,16

150,Couldn't sleep all night,"During my stay in the room, I encountered a significant disturbance due to loud pipe noises that persisted throughout the night. Unfortunately, this noise disruption was so severe that it prevented me from getting any sleep, leaving me exhausted and frustrated.

In the morning, I reported the issue to the reception as a courtesy. However, I was disappointed by the response I received. The receptionist did not seem concerned about the discomfort I experienced and even made a dismissive comment, stating, ""At least one of you slept.""

This response left me feeling unheard and dissatisfied with the level of service I received. I expected a more attentive and accommodating approach to addressing my concerns.",2,2023,09,30
150,Overrated and uneven service,"Booked here three nights for business trip. The first night I wasn't there due to the red eye flight, and considering the £1000+ nightly price tag, and a generally speaking run of the mill Hyatt Regency experience, I was hoping service was that mystery ingredient that could address the gap between a Hyatt Regency brand and the price tag. 
Not at the reception desk.  Checked in at the world of Hyatt desk with a guy called Daniel who had a trainee in tow.  Daniel doesn't mince words, not even simple greetings. He has a chip on both shoulders and never looks away from his screen. He took very long in the check in process for a room that was ready yesterday and checked in online already. I must have been standing there for ten minutes an die had no idea what he was busy typing away, no communication. If I asked I was met with, not eye contact, but a sharp remark that he is working on it.  I had a deep worry that Daniel shipped my personal information on dark web and couldn't meet my eyes. The next desk was lucky to be staffed with a much more pleasant lady, smiling, greeting and chatting up guests and not slowing down because she is delivering joy.
The second day I went to the front desk with something else, another guy was also less pleasant. 
In comparison I would commend the housekeeping on 7th floor, attentive and complete, amazing. The doorman were mostly nice and ready to help. Breakfast staff and Club lounge staff as well.
We stayed at the Regency suite on the 7th, and it is a good size. I would be worried if it is a regular room.  The window has double pane, noise insulation is superb.
Similar to other reviews, the hotel does attract a very large proportion of middle eastern guests.  It could at times feel overwhelming.
The club lounge is OK size and does get crowded during the afternoon hours for canopies.
Even as a loyal Hyatt member living and dying by Hyatt points, it will take a lot to come back to this one again.  Who would want to pay that kind of silly money and be chilled with a front desk staff, or asked for a 3pm check out and be offered a negotiated favor of ""how about 2:30?""
",2,2023,09,30
150,Nice hotel - let down by the unacceptable breakfast service.,"Day after day the breakfast service at this hotel is totally chaotic. They don’t have items. They don’t bring you items you’ve requested. They clear away your things while you’re up getting new items. The staff are all grumpy and no one seems in charge. 

Put someone in charge who knows what they are doing. Train the staff. Let the staff with poor attitudes leave. This shouldn’t be this hard. 

For a 5 star hotel the level of service is truly shocking and it taints the whole stay.",1,2023,09,21
150,The Churchill - Older Building,"The staff, club lounge, and complimentary full English breakfast were all amazing.

I had requested months ago for early check in if possible(arrived london 7am) and called up upon arrival if it was possible which the frontdesk said yes. But when I arrived they wanted to charge for the early check in which was a shock. She said rooms are unavailable, but if you pay its a available?! 

Fortunately for me, the supervisor on duty John made an intervention and allowed me the early check in. That is rewarding loyalty!",4,2023,09,19

150,Beautiful hotel in prime neighborhood,"I stayed with my family of 4 adults and 1 toddler for 5 nights. 

**HOTEL**
This charming hotel is in a very prime location. Lots to walk to and the tube is very close. Taxis are always out waiting. Our suites were very large, clean, comfortable, and more than adequate for us. The executive king was perfect for my wife, 16monther, and myself. My parents very much enjoyed the private balcony on their balcony suite. 
The hotel itself is beautiful with a large, open concept breakfast space serving delicious buffet style English breakfast, pastries, fruit, juices, grains, and fresh made eggs to order. There is also a modestly sized gym with up to date Technogym equipment, a club lounge with ample options to eat and drink, and, to my surprise, a spa which we unfortunately had no time to use on this trip.

**SERVICE**
From even before we arrived, Jose (especially) and Ricardo were in constant contact with me via email regarding restaurant reservations, things to do, transportation options with toddler, etc. This was our first international trip with our little one, so anxiety was high. These two gentleman eased our stress from the very beginning. Huge hats off to them. 
Upon arrival, Joshua greeted me at the front desk and he was extremely professional, patient, and kind. He looked into our microwave request (as my wife needed one to sterilize her breast pump parts) and was able to provide one for the duration of our trip. Thank you so much, Joshua! We did order room service a couple of times for the little one and, both times, the staff member was patient in answering my questions regarding allergens and prompt in delivering the order. The food was delicious and our son loved it (sea bass, broccoli)!
One misstep, if any, would have to be the airport pick up. Be prompt (which sometimes is out of your hands as was our situation) or be charged extra. 
 
Overall, a very pleasant stay at The Churchill. Travelling with a little one was incredibly hard, but the staff here made every attempt to make things easier for us. I truly appreciate every staff member I met, be it directly or in passing. I definitely will stay again if ever in the area.",5,2023,09,13

150,Pleasant light dinner and cigar in the terrace,"Came for a cigar in the terrace, followed by dinner at the bar. Terrace is pleasant and service is polite if a bit stiff. Their collection of cigars is quite limited though. Food at the bar is also limited, I had a trio of mini hamburgers (GBP 22) which was pretty good and paired with fried sweet potatoes was sufficient for dinner. Only 2 beers available! In a bar in central London? MMMhhh Food selection is more complete at the restaurant of the hotel.",4,2023,08,26

150,Worse Hyatt customer service EVER,"I set up my brother and his wife and two little kids there. On arrival the front desk AND the assistant manager were rude and unhelpful. My brother had to call me from London to fix the situation. They did NOTHING to help as they were asking my brother to pay for an extra room for his 1 year old daughter. IT defies any logic and breaks every rule of good customer service. I will never go to this hotel. I will share with as many globalist elite members the treatment of my family. Policy is one thing. Treating people based on policy is completely different and the most important. They do not care about families there.

Asked for housekeeping to bring us something and it came to our door in minutes. Every single staff person was approachable and displayed exemplary commitment to service.

Absolutely no complaints and in fact, can’t wait to come back to Hyatt Regency Churchill again and again!!",5,2023,08,16
150,London at its best,We are satisfied returning guests to Churchill Hyatt. We stayed in a lovely room overlooking Portman Square. We had breakfast in Montagu restaurant where friendly and helpful staff attended to our every need. A wide selection of foods and beverages was served. We travelled with lounge access to the Regency Club on the 8th floor. A stylish tranquil lounge where we had drinks and canapés. As expected of a 5 star establishment everything held the highest standard. What made our stay truly special was Churchills outstanding members of staff! They are the hotells greatest asset!,5,2023,08,15
150,Impeccable Service with a smile !,"We’ve been staying at the Hyatt Churchill for a few weeks each time  since a few years now and everytime our experience is better than the previous one.   Besides having a great location, the hotel and the rooms are well maintained and well kept.  The staff as usual are very friendly and truly deliver service with a smile !  From the doorman,  to the concierge, to the Front desk attendants, and in addition even  the guest relations manager…all went out of their way to accommodate us. Thanks you Hyatt Churchill. See you again soon ",5,2023,08,09
150,Fantastic!,"Excellent location, 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street and the tube station. All the staff were friendly and approachable.
Room was clean and spacious. The beds were very comfortable. Loved every minute!",5,2023,08,06
150,Excellent,"Its amazing hotel, in perfect location. Staff are so friendly. The room is very good compare to other hotels in London. The foods were amazing. The bathroom have Shattaf which its very important for Muslims ",5,2023,08,05
150,Non existent customer service ,Called in here and tried to get coffees  in the lobby. Staff unhelpful and unfriendly. No hospitality at all. Manager refused. They are in the wrong trade! Don’t use this hotel would be my recommendation,1,2023,08,05
150,Great location and Great condition to stay,We stayed for 6days. Room is always cleaned perpectly they gave us the house keeping service twice a day. Especially I like the pillows on a bed.. I would like to stay here again for my next visit in london.,5,2023,08,04
150,Hyatt Churchill,"We stayed for three nights in July. It was my first time in London
We booked a room to accommodate three, which, in hindsight was probably not great as it was perfect for two only 
No one offered to take our luggage into storage, although we didn’t ask, so we also had a luggage in our room coming from the other side of the world 
Enough with negatives, facilities both in the room and the hotel were exquisite 
We booked a room and had access to the club lounge in the afternoon. That was very handy and very pleasant. 
We enjoyed our stay  in enjoyed the  service from the friendly people, both at the hotel and in general in the UK,well done 
Black Cans were a highlight for us, and it felt like home being from Australia 

Don’t leave anything in the black cabs as they cannot trace you and get the item back to you

Breakfast was very good,dinner on the other hand, hit and miss
I think it depends on your expectations and food that you’re used to 
Expensive prices for average food, better restaurants close by

The position of the hotel was also handy, and we had access to some beautiful parts of London

In summary, high-quality rooms, service levels, exceptional and general ambience very very pleasant I would stay again I would recommend",4,2023,07,24
150,Wonderful stay at the Hyatt Churchill,"The staff are very helpful. In spite of being busy because the hotel was full They went out of there way to make you comfortable. The check in and check out was very smooth.
The location is superb. Just a stone throw from Oxford Street.
 ",5,2023,07,20
150,Always a comfortable and safe place to stay in London.,"The Churchill continues to be my first choice in London, since 2008. They have an incredibly trained staff, which are always looking to attend to what we need. It is a place you can always trust on every single issue you may have. I must say  Mr Cesary, one of the concierges, is a fantastic person, a true concierge that gives you all the tips, takes care of all the details in every single request. There is TV (pairing devices) issue; which couldn’t make it work with my iPhone. I let them know, they are aware, they tried their best, but it seems like they must have to replace its system, to manage this issue; every other hotel I stayed, I could pair my device easily so it is just something the hotel should adjust. They don’t loose at all their brilliant service because of it, as a frequent guest of them, I wish this could be heard as an advice.   And I’ll continue staying with them.",5,2023,07,19
150,Fantastic in every way,Loved our stay here. The rooms are comfortable updated and quiet. The staff is outstanding. Helpful and accommodating in every way. The location is tucked away behind selfridges and Oxford St. Easy access to all tourist points of interest.,5,2023,07,19
150,Hyatt Churchill - outstanding value in a prime location,"- solid property all around
- recent renovation gives a clean freshness to the rooms
- location as good as it gets
- front desk manager Asja Samperi was quite thoughtful and helpful, going out of the way to make the stay feel like home, outstanding service particularly in regards to my breakfast request.  
- The bellman named Yam deserves recognition for his patience, helpfulness, and wonderful service.  
- Paulo Villar and the concierge team were quite helpful
- Guest relations department is helpful and makes the experience even better
- Many thanks also to Olga Saveljeva and Tomas Vieitos - outstanding leadership and preparation in advance of the stay

150,Hyatt Regency - The Churchill 👌,"The hotel is well placed for getting around London.The staff are exceptionally kind and helpful.The hotel offers great food, service and the rooms are modern, comfortable and welcoming. The bed was excellent, and fresh clean crisp bedding added to the experience of a great nights sleep. Would not hesitate to return. The Churchill Bar is a great place to sip a G&T and relax with a cigar, even in the winter. My wife loves having a glass of Billecart Salmon champagne as she does not smoke. This hotel caters well for everyone. Thank you ",5,2023,07,16
150,Wonderful stay,"Everything was good, the staff is very nice and very helpful. Room is very clean and comfortable.the location is very convenient.Nothing else i can think of but all good. Recomended for who wants to do the shopping trips also. ",5,2023,07,15

150,Great hotel in a perfect location in London,"This hotel was spectacular!  The staff members were courteous and friendly, and we felt very pampered.  The room was clean, the breakfast was delicious, and everyone greeted us very warmly, from the time we checked in until the day we left.",5,2023,07,07
150,The sad demise of an institution - due to nothing other than staff.,"This hotel has - historically- been wonderful.

Solid and respectful service.

Familiar faces.

It, of course, has not changed location and remains close to many highlights of London.

However, ego and arrogance has replaced the service level.

The familiar faces have changed replaced by people way out of their depth.

Actually offensive.

It is now a cash cow for the owners - and that is all that matters.

There are some far better alternatives nearby.

Never again.",2,2023,07,06
150,"Excellent location, high-priced, good service. Not ideal for a restful sojourn!","The staff are professional friendly and helpful. The food & drink is somewhat overpriced but given the ideal location there are plenty of options in the neighbourhood, should you wish for more basic food options. Given its ideal location, it's extremely busy. Expect late night doors banging with families or arrivals which interrupts sleep (not drunk revellers at least). The service, cleanliness & location outweighs the issues of noise. Not recommended for a relaxing restful sojourn. ",4,2023,07,04
150,"Good location, good service....rooms very small, and expensive.","London is a great place to visit with the family...but plan your trip well ahead in advance, as prices this summer are very expensive.
The rooms are very small, but that was expected....and b/c we booked late, the prices were extremely expensive. The rooms were clean, but there was a leak in the bathroom sink drain which was not discovered until the day we were checking out.  They built a shelf underneath the seak, for you to put your things, so beware of any leaks.",4,2023,07,03
150,First class all the way,"Everything was first class. The location is very central to the entire city. You can walk everywhere or have access to public transportation very conveniently. The hotel has very well trained staff . They don’t answer back like at some hotels I’ve stayed at. They go above and beyond to satisfy every need and we have. The security at the hotel is excellent that wa very important to me being in the middle of London. They are very vigilant always having several staff on alert inside and outside of the hotel at all times of the day. This was a very important feature for me.The staff is very courteous. Another very important feature. They truly go above and beyond not letting any of your requests be ignored or minimized. The room we had was quiet and had a huge king size bed with all the amenities you would expect from a first class hotel room . The bed was super comfortable I actually would like to purchase one . The linens super soft and very clean, the entire room spotless. Turndown service was always done and our time was respected in the room. We sometimes didn’t leave the room until 8.30pm for dinner and turndown service was still performed afterwards. The bathroom was equipped with a Toto washlet , a walk in shower and a huge stone vanity. The professional workmanship of the renovation did not go unnoticed. I was looking at the finishes which are all first class. No haphazard renovations here. As previously said the bed was huge and very comfortable and the linens were so soft and clean . The housekeeping service is amazing. They really pay attention to details. The furniture placement in the room and the amenities provided to the white bone china mugs with the hotel name inscribed on them just made the whole trip one of the most memorable and enjoyable. ",5,2023,06,27
150,Would stay again,I stayed on a recently renovated floor and then one not yet renovated. The main difference was the renovated  floor had a step through shower and fancy one unit bidet. The bed also seem more soft which was nice after a long journey. Staff were very pleasant.,4,2023,06,25
150,Great stay at The Churchill,Another great stay at The Churchill.  Made to feel really welcome.  Perfect location and really welcoming staff.  The upgrade to a garden room and access to the business lounge was really appreciated.  Thank you,5,2023,06,23
150,Top tier hyatt property,"couldn't have been happier with my stay. This was probably one of my top hyatt experiences, especially for a regency, and i've been to thompsons as well as grand and park hyatts before. the staff were all warm and friendly, the regency club was the best i've been to. the little touches from house keeping were delightful, they noticed i liked sparkling water and left those in my room in addition to still. there were fresh orchids in our room. i'll gladly stay at the churchill again before considering another property. ",5,2023,06,22
150,Grand Experience,"For six nights this exceptional hotel exceeded my expectations. Located close to Oxford St shops, restaurants, and only minutes away from the Bond St. subway provided access to everything we needed. The staff were friendly and really helped me navigate London. ",5,2023,06,21
150,Nice hotel well located,"Hotel with good location near to Oxford street, we stayed here during winter and were able to go to Winter Wonderland next to the hotel (hyde park). Hotel is huge and has a lot of rooms which means waiting time at front desk and for the elevators. The hotel's restaurant was good offering plenty of options and the breakfast buffet was good. Staff were available and nice to us.",3,2023,06,20
150,Business conference stay,Nice hotel in a convenient area of London.  Easy to walk to several areas and close to the underground system.  Service was very good.  The only drawback to this upscale hotel is the bathrooms are way to small.,4,2023,06,19
150,Great stay. Highly recommended!,"Loved this property. The location is excellent and the rooms are well appointed. Being a Globalist, we were upgraded to a suite. We had minor issues during the stay but the hotel took care of them promptly. I love that they have a really nice lounge which is open till late night. The breakfast spread is fairly good even though the service can be a bit slow. All in all, we had a great time and would definitely recommend this property",5,2023,06,17
150,Wonderful Stay,"Great location. Walking distance to stores, parks, and restaurants.  The rooms were spacious and clean. Staff were helpful and friendly. The club room was small but it all worked out. My favorite was the breakfast downstairs.  I was surprised when I checked out that there were two charges for phone calls, which I didn’t make. They were also asking for a 5% service charge for the hotel staff- something that I have never heard of before.  Thought that was weird.  I would come back.",5,2023,06,15
150,Great Location & wondereful Hotel,"The Churchill has a exceptional & central location to enjoy all that this wonderful city  has to offer.The staff are super friendly & the service is impeccable. You cant go wrong with a stay at this lovely property.
",5,2023,06,13
150,Exceptional Hotel,Absolutely stunning hotel.  The staff were so helpful.  They booked us for High Tea when we were unable to get any reservations.  They went above and beyond to make our stay perfect.  The location is the best.  Close to everything. ,5,2023,06,12
150,Excellent Place To Stay,We enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Churchhill. The rooms were well decorated and appointed and the staff were friendly with a good service orientation. The amenities on site met our needs and we could walk to many restaurants and sites from the property,5,2023,06,12
150,Great rooms.  Perfect location,"Perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are super duper clean. Beds were really comfortable. The location to the subway and nearby dining could not have been any better. I would love, love to stay here again in the future.",5,2023,06,11
150,Fabulous London hotel experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill.  Gorgeous hotel, fantastic staff, top notch service and beautiful rooms.  From the moment you arrive, it's obvious the hotel staff care very much about the guest experience.",5,2023,06,10
150,Average due to Room Size,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights, using points. 

The folks at the check in desk were friendly and allowed an early check in. 

Our room, 252, was nice, but quite small. The bathroom is tiny and can be likened to those on cruise ships. It was very difficult to use the bathtub and I can’t imagine a larger person using the restroom with ease. The bathroom is suitable for one person, but difficult if 2 or more are staying in the room. 

The bed is very comfortable. We asked for housekeeping service and it was provided. Extra towels were dropped off as well. 

The Churchill Bar is nice but extremely expensive. Two espresso martinis cost $51 USD. A rip off. Avoid if you can. 

The hotel is in a nice area. Check out Oxford Street just a couple of blocks away. Use the Underground. It’s close and convenient (Circle Line). 

For nice restaurants, go behind the hotel to New Quebec Street. Great bars and restaurants!",3,2023,06,10
150,Perfect ,"This hotel definitely lives up to its reputation. One of the most elegant and classy hotels of London. 
1) Best location: Private garden, nearby coffee shops and restaurants, direct access to Oxford Street. 
2) Amazing guest treatment: Staff are incredibly well mannered and friendly, and concierge are very attentive and helpful to guests. 
3) Rooms: Clean, comfy beds (the comfiest bed and pillows i've tried in a hotel and i've tried many). The regular rooms are a bit cramped so i decided on a suite which was TERRIFIC. A living room and bedroom with a beautiful balcony overlooking the garden. 
4) Breakfast: Delicious breakfast and staff are very responsive and friendly. I had access to the private lounge which had a separate breakfast and I loved the quiet environment of the lounge. Perfect for using your laptop and reading newspapers. 

No notes. This is an amazing hotel. ",5,2023,06,09
150,Amazing Stay!,"Great stay at the Hyatt Regency - The Churchill. Beautiful hotel with great amenities and nice comfortable rooms. The staff was very attentive in the lobby, restaurant and bar. The location is wonderful as well. I would certainly stay here again the next time we return to London for a visit! ",5,2023,06,04
150,"Decent hotel, lacking 5* service","The hotel itself is fine, and located in a good location. However check-in service was a mess. I arrived early, so my room was not ready (fine, not a problem). I was promised a phone call once my room was ready. The attendant offered to store my bags for me until I got my keys. 

After 3 hours, and no phone call, I went back to the hotel, and my room was ready, however that was never communicated to me. And when I asked for my bags, a) the front desk attendant let me know the bags were already in my room. After I entered my room, my bags were not there. So I had to go back down to the front and let them know my bags are not in my room, as they had indicated. then after 5-10 minutes of them searching, the attendant said she could not locate my bags, and asked that I come to the storage area to see if I could spot them. So I went back to the storage area and had to find the bags myself (which I did). 

Not the service or experience I'd expect at a hotel of this caliber.",3,2023,05,30
150,Very Good!,"The Churchill's rooms, location, customer service, and food were outstanding. The rooms were clean, spacious, and had large windows, and we used a connecting door that enhanced our experience. Would stay again!",5,2023,05,29
150,Average hotel and very overpriced,"This used to be my favorite and go to London hotel. Customer service, helpful staff, location and customer focus excelled. It was a 5 star experience. Today, hotel is somewhat tired, impersonal, very pricey, and just average. They have really lost their mojo. I know because I have stated here over 200 nights over the past 10 years. But the location is great!",3,2023,05,26
150,Excellent Luxury Hotel and Great Location,"I highly recommend the Hyatt - Churchill, this was my second visit to the hotel and it was fabulous. The English breakfast and lounges were great. The location across from Hyde Park is perfect and we could walk everywhere. The staff is very professional and  attentive.",5,2023,05,26
150,Great service!,"Landed on an early flight, hotel was fully booked so I could not do an early check-in.

Hotel staff was very nice to offer me the lounge access, when I requested for somewhere to freshen up.

The location is very convenient and the breakfast buffet is decent too.",5,2023,05,26
150,Very expensive hotel for a poor service,"I was surprised with the attitude of the stuff in the hotel as you are dealing with someone who is not interested, neither willing to cooperate in any dimension, this is the first and the last time I will use such a facility and on top of that it is extremely expensive hotel, and this is for watt?",1,2023,05,24
150,Great location,"Very welcoming staff. Great location near marble arch and oxford street. Nice rooms. Clean and spacious. Somewhat outdated. 
Minibar was empty and there was a little shop where you could buy some drinks and snacks. That was not 5 star!
Breakfast was very good with a good selection, and you can order eggs etc to your taste.
Overall very nice hotell, but lacking the full 5 star experience.",4,2023,05,24
150,"Excellent, Too-Notch Service at the Churchill!","From the front desk staff, to the concierge, to the food and drink servers, this was a top-notch experience! Alexia at the front desk and Hank the concierge really took time to help us, Boris at the Churchill cigar and cocktail bar, and the staff at the breakfast buffet were all so helpful and knowledgeable. We were also pleasantly surprised at how soundproof the windows were for our rooms facing Portman Square.",5,2023,05,15
150,Only nice rooms and location,"Nice room and location, but the there is no lobby, I wasn’t expecting a 5 star hotel with no lobby. And my room was next the exit door so I was so annoyed by the noise employees do while I’m sleeping. ",4,2023,05,13
150,A six star hotel,"High standard luxury hotel. Well-kept rooms and the atmosphere is like sleeping at home. The team is very kind and welcomes you with a smile from the moment you enter the hotel to the moment you leave it. Excellent breakfast, amazing stay.

150,Great Hotel in a great location,"Truly enjoyed our visit to the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill.  Property is very nice, and location can not be beat.  Close to Marble Arch/Hyde Park, Shopping, and tube stations.  Breakfast was quite good, and the Bar & Terrace was a lot of fun. ",5,2023,05,05
150,Our stay,"Excellent service and amenities. We especially enjoyed the cocktails and snacks at the Churchill Bar and restaurant. The gym needs improvement in terms of size and equipment. In all other respects, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are planning to come back in October",5,2023,05,04
150,Very hot rooms,"We booked 3 rooms, all of them were very hot. We contacted the hotel multiple time to fix the air conditioner but it remained the same, the solution was to bring a ""FAN"", which was very loud and noisy. Couldn't even sleep properly for the whole week.",2,2023,05,02
150,"Great location, but rather underwhelming","The rooms were very underwhelming, not what I expected for 400$ a night. The concierge staff was sometimes really nice, other times they were pretty indifferent. Breakfast was rather chaotic, with pretty slow service. Kudos for the doormen, which were always helpful and courteous. The location was very convenient. ",3,2023,04,28
150,Jim,A wonderful hotel and located close to transit and shopping. Wonderful staff. A really quiet hotel. We were able to sleep in until 1030 without hearing any noisr The showers compared to American hotels is wonderful. The beds are great. The concierge lounge is a bargain with the food and staff great..,5,2023,04,25
150,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Excellent location, easy to reach from the airports. Nice rooms with modern fittings. An excellent breakfast! Cleanliness was well maintained, and the staff was helpful. The meeting room was disturbance free.",5,2023,04,22
150,Another good stay,"Second time at this hotel and it's always a good choice.  Located within a 5 minute walk to all the Oxford St. shopping,  the hotel is still quietly tucked away closer to residences.

The thing I loved most about this hotel are the Japanese toilets which are all automatic.  Room was great but the pillows could be better. If you like big fluffy pillows maybe you can request.

The breakfast was extensive but ordering coffee almost always took forever.  Plus it was blah,  so don't bother.  ",5,2023,04,20
150,London 2023,Truly amazing visit for my family of 4. The connecting Family room was perfect.  Staff was super friendly + professional. Food at Churchills was great. The Buffett at breakfast was best we’ve ever had. ,5,2023,04,20
150,This hotel is filled with great people,"You will not be disappointed with the level of service at this property. The staff goes above and beyond to meet your every need, my only regret is that I didn’t stay longer. 5 stars!!! From the doorman, to the bell hop and concierge I felt as though no small touch was missed. I was treated like royalty during my stay. The staff at breakfast was Excellent and the food was superb",5,2023,04,18
150,Standards not in line with high prices,"It's been a couple of years since we last visited this hotel. Our room was decent enough but we forgot how small the bathrooms were (albeit well equipped). We found the standards of service out of sync with the high prices. As an example, a bowl of soup was £13 and when we asked for some bread - which really should be complimentary with soup - we were charged a further £7. Breakfast was pretty poor too, with just a very limited buffet and cooked-to-order eggs as an option. 

We also didn't like that a 13.5% daily discretionary service charge was added to our bill at check-out without checking with us first. It's mentioned somewhere in their booking terms but they really should ask at checkout before simply just adding it to your total. 

All things considered, it was not the best experience and we have definitely stayed at better '5-star' hotels in London.",3,2023,04,17
150,Sliding to a 4 Star,"I used to stay here lots years ago in the early 2000’s. It was my ‘go-to’ hotel in London. 
Oh how times have changed and work-wise my visits to London are much fewer and stay-overs much less.

So, the opportunity to do a Friday night with my wife seemed a great idea. We wanted to go to Locanda Locatelli so why not stay at the Churchill - price seemed decent on a London scale?

Check-in was fine but no help with bags.
Room was ok if basic with comfy bed but small bathroom.
Weird thing - vacant sockets by bed are European as UK sockets occupied by phone on one side and clock on the other so phone charging has to be at the desk.
Tea/coffee facilities very ‘B&B’ - basic. No coffee machine.

I had breakfast and it was a bit of a ‘zoo’ (kids running round) with buffet presentation poor at best - bacon was undercooked and fried eggs piled into a pan four-deep and therefore overcooked.
Coffee was warm and bland.
Waiting staff started to clear my table before I’d finished and the whole experience was nowhere near 5 Star.

You just get the feeling that budget’s are tight and standards are suffering according. It’s ok but it’s anything but memorable.

Shame really, I really used to love it here.",3,2023,04,15
150,Exceptional,"Do not hesitate to choose this hotel when staying in London. Convenient location, excellent amenities, and simply elegant. The hotel staff are eager to help and very friendly. We will certainly book here again next time we are in London!",5,2023,04,14
150,One of the best i've been to,"Above all, a lovely staff, who helped us with everything we needed and much more, professionally and warmly.  Exclusive hotel, in an excellent and central location, large rooms.  One of the places where I enjoyed the hospitality the most.",5,2023,04,13
150,Hyatt Regency London The Churchill saved our vacation,We had a horrible experience at a neighboring hotel so we switched to The Churchill. From the moment we walked in we felt like we were on vacation and where we were supposed to be. Paulina at the front desk was awesome! The doorman were friendly and helpful in getting us cabs. The staff as a whole were fantastic.,5,2023,04,13
150,Excellent property with wonderful staff,"The room was very comfortable with a fantastic bed and tv and mini fridge.  The breakfast buffet and staff was of the highest quality/engagement.  The only single aspect that I would highly encourage the hotel ownership to consider would be changing out the tall/narrow bathtubs, even with the wonderful overhead rainfall shower, to a shower staff.  For anyone but especially for folks approaching 60 or beyond it really isn't worth the risk and concern about getting in and out of a tub anymore even with ample handles.....and with periods of drought and energy costs taking a bath is just not the best option going forward.  A spa experience is much more appropriate for that.  But other than that the experience was fantastic.",5,2023,04,09
150,Spectacular Hotel,Elegance personified. Magnificent surroundings with all you expect and more. Senior staff could not be more helpful. Would definitely consider returning if for nothing more than the spectacular Saturday tea.,5,2023,04,07
150,Impressive stay at Hyatt Regency Churchill,"Its location is outstanding, room of decent size, very welcoming staff. Staff at the front door and reception were outstanding and hotel layout was decent. Breakfast was comprehensive and good quality. Highly recommended",5,2023,04,05
150,High quality accommodations in central London location,"Good business hotel in a perfect Marylebone location. Rooms are modern, relatively spacious with super comfortable beds and modern upgraded showers.  The  breakfast is excellent, lots of traditional as well as healthy options, even coffee was good.
Concierge and bellboys are super helpful.
The hotel is Churchill themed, there are some artifacts and art pieces.
The hotel has a well known cigar bar downstairs.
The location is very central, walking distance to many attractions, shopping and sightseeing, there is also a taxi stand just outside and tube station 3 min away.
Could not give 5 stars only because we had to wait for the rooms after our check in time, and check in was a bit slow,  otherwise very good hotel and stay.",4,2023,03,31
150,Outstanding hotel,"One of my favorite hotels to stay overnight when I pass by the kids. Amazing service, comfortable parking and overall very stylish atmosphere. The breakfasts are outstanding! you don't feel hungry till the evening :)",5,2023,03,29
150,Weekend away,"The expected standards received on previous occasions was maintained and all staff very professional and helpful. I would always recommend it as a place to stay in London.
Unfortunately my partner and I had to leave earlier than expected due to a family crisis. The Concierge was able to get me a flight to Canada in time for me to see my sister before she passed. ",5,2023,03,28
150,Gorgeous Property and Impeccable Service,"Lovely balcony suite overlooking the park.  Club was great.  Service was perfect. 
Shower drain was the only negative, but it was slow, not broken.  Best mattress ever.  Every detail considered by management.  Can’t wait to come back. ",5,2023,03,22
150,The Churchill did not disappoint!,Our three nights were amazing! The location is superb to many areas of interest in London! Restaurants were delicious. Servers were attentive. Our room was perfect! Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London!,5,2023,03,19
150,Great Location and well maintained.,The Hotel is well mainained and at a great location. Its just a few steps from amenities and the tube station.  Rooms are big and comfortable.  Breakfast is good.  There is also a club lounge.  Recommended.,5,2023,03,13
150,Not organized and not friendly,"I have arrived to the hotel me and my family at 12:30 pm we have been told that the rooms are not yet ready but it will be ready in an hour our less. Whoever, we went back to the hotel around 2:15 pm and they said the room was not yet ready so that made me very nervous I have told them that my kids are really tired and they need to get some rest but the staff are not helpful nor friendly at all and they put me on the waiting till 2:50 pm. I had my rooms but not as it spouses to be, the rooms wasn’t prepared to accommodate me and my family there was missing the extra bed as it was very clear in my reservation.

Now it’s 4:00 pm and I’m still waiting for the extra bed. For sure I will never recommend this hotel to anybody traveling with their children.

Also, I think that not only me who is facing problems because when I arrive there were a lady arguing with the staff at the reception and she wasn’t satisfied at all.",1,2023,03,12
150,High quality stay,"Stayed here for one night as part of a birthday celebration.  Had a room overlooking the square which was very pleasant.  Sound insulation superb, so no issue with road noise.  Room and bed extremely comfortable and all internal finishes are to a very high standard as would be expected for a hotel in this price bracket.  Service was efficient, although perhaps lacking slightly in the personal touch.",5,2023,03,07
150,Memorable experience at The Churchill,"The Hotel is well located with view on a park
Excellent breakfast with very good personnel
Cleaned rooms
We enjoy the neighbourhood and the calm of the rooms
lot of restaurants and shopping very close",5,2023,03,06
150,Excellent location,"Excellent central London hotel in a perfect location for Oxford Street, Mayfair, Marble Arch etc.   Reasonably sized room for central London with nice bathroom and comfortable bed.  Staff attentive, helpful and add the thr experience.  Lots of choice at this end of the market but this well worth a look.",5,2023,03,01
150,Home away from Home.,"This was my 28th stay at the Churchill. Feels like coming home as the staff always greet me and welcome me back with so much warmth. The location of the hotel, the beautiful rooms and the ambience make it my favorite hotel and go to hotel in London. I shall be back. Love the Churchill.",5,2023,02,28
150,Great location and high-end rooms,"Stayed here one night for first time with wife and 14 yo daughter - was impressed by overall service and standard of accommodation. Booked a suite and was delighted with the space, looked fairly recently refurbished, and high-end bedding/decor overall. Wooden floors, muted tones, lovely bookshelf display wall in room and great amenities overall. Bathroom was large, walk-in shower (but no rain shower head which is pretty much standard in high end hotels now) and lots of molton brown toiletries. Was a huge space on one side with a counter but needed a mirror for wife/daughter to do their make up - something that could easily be fixed as wasn't really anywhere else could do this (and is a bug-bear for my family).

Lounge was ok - we were out for early dinner but didn't get a chance to try with full food offering - it's huge over two sides of one floor, but we didn't see any staff mid-afternoon so just helped ourselves to drinks. We didn't get any amenity letter or explanation on checkin of what worked as our room wasn't originally ready early (which was expected) so had to check on breakfast arrangements.

Breakfast was included in the lobby restaurant - was good quality overall, but service was disappointing - very busy, too few staff and too slow for drinks. Food arrived before tea for example. Buffet is spread far over the space so you are walking around tables to get to things - quality was good, but the overall experience wasn't as high-end as you would hope. We had drinks there the night before and was fine - inexperienced bar staff, asked for a passion-fruit martini (to be polite) only for them to take ages to confirm they could do it. Later another waiter stopped to ""inform"" us to ask for a Porn Star Martini next time - was a little condescending.

Overall though great room and location is right on doorstep of west end/Selfidges/Oxford Street",5,2023,02,25
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill,"Once a great hotel turned into a place not to go near. Location is the only good thing about this hotel. Short staffed, I was checked into an already occupied room, had to wait almost 2 hours to be given another room. Rooms need major upgradation. Breakfast was just normal. Lifts were partially working so long wait there too. Not happy and would avoid going there again. ",1,2023,02,24
150,Amazing wedding venue! Outstanding customer service and wonderful tasty food! Thank you team from the depth of our heart,"We should have posted this review a while ago so please excuse us but we have been caught in an hurricane of bad sad events and happy ones. 

After a long planning and researches we couldn’t choose better place than London Hyatt Churchill. 2022 has been between planning between Italy and UK but for good & bad reasons we had to keep going in London. 
Luckly we have met the most wonderful and helpful team to listen and to prepare at the best details our day of joy surrounded by family and friends. 
Initially we had started our journey with Victoria, then Gigi and finally we met the lovely Aureline who carefully listened us for our desire and preparation details. Together we tailored an offer with a lot of precise details that go from setup, menu, timings etc 
This has been a quite exciting journey! Merci❤️

23rd July 2022 was a wonderful wedding day, me & David will never forget! 

Thank you again Aureline for the attentiveness to all preparation

Grazie Chef Gianluca for the most amazing food (all our guests complimented for the menu quality, Italian and English premium delicacies) 

Grazie beautiful Francesca for your  assistance and most wonderful customer service 

Thank you to all events, food & beverages team. 

We will treasure in our heart the wonderful decorated Chartwell and Library room, magical chandeliers, soft music and atmosfere! 
I can’t believe we make it real confettata which was prepared as kindly requested and all guests were super happy to see Italian traditions over abroad, kids had fun and the keys to the wonderful secret garden were highlights of the day we will never forget. 

We can’t wait to celebrate our anniversaries soon at your hotel and to see you again soon! We have used some points with Hyatt in America for our honeymoon and this is definitely I will keep going because the level of loyalty and customer service is out of this world! Thank you very much! 

Cristina & David",5,2023,02,23
150,"Very Nice Hotel, Good Service, Good Location","This stay was for four nights with my wife and 12 year old daughter.  I used points for the stay along with an suite upgrade from the Hyatt loyalty program.  We were assigned a Regency Suite with Balcony.

I used the app to check in when we landed at Heathrow around 8:00 in the morning.  About a half hour later I received an alert letting me know the room was ready for check in when we arrived at the hotel; that's awesome!

Check in was efficient.  They explained that we would have access to the Regency Club lounge on the 8th floor along with free breakfast each day in the restaurant.  I requested a rollaway for my daughter upon check in as well.

The room was clean, recently updated and had enough room for all of us.  The club lounge was nice and we used it multiple times each day.  There is light continental breakfast each morning (breads, coffee machine, cold meats, cereals, pastries, cheeses).  Throughout the day, you can pop in and grab some bottled water, sodas and even some bottled beer.  In the evening, starting at 5:30, they roll out a small selection of liquors, mixers, wines (red, white, rose, sparkling) along with a good selection of food to eat.  During this time, they also walk around and pass olives, hummus, and other plated small appetizers.  One could easily make a meal out of this service and we saw several people doing exactly that.

The bathroom was about the only drawback to our room.  It was on the small side with just one sink and the shower was tight.  The shower only had a soap dish which made it difficult to find a place to put shampoos, razors, etc.  The shower head was one of those that doubles as a hand held wand and it would not stay in place...just pointed straight down at the floor.  But, we called it in to engineering and they fixed it promptly.  The toiletries were Molton Brown; very high quality.

The location of the hotel is convenient to the Oxford tube stop.  It is about a three block walk and we used the tube to get almost everywhere in London.

The work out room is nice for a hotel.  It has several treadmills, bikes, etc. and a rack of free weights.  When I used the workout room it was never crowded.

The staff was always very helpful from getting the rollaway in the room and set up, to printing boarding passes, to addressing the minor service issues that we encountered.  WiFi was speedy throughout the hotel.

The only thing I didn't care for was not the hotel's fault, but more of a widespread thing in London:  discretionary service charges on everything food related.  Go to the bar to get a glass of wine:  13.5% service charge.  Bottle of water:  same.  Meal:  same.  Not their fault; they're just following the trend throughout London.

We picked this hotel to change up from the JW Grosvenor House.  Overall, this hotel felt more personal and quaint.  We are pleased with the stay and would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone that wants a very nice hotel in a good part of London.",4,2023,02,21
150,Weekend business stay,The stay was as expected and enjoyable. I had a slight issue with my room when checking in but was resolved very quickly and efficiently. The service was great. Breakfast was enjoyable and nice and teh rooms very clean and tidy.,4,2023,02,21
150,Stay to remember in London,I had a very nice stay in the hotel which had a Perfect Location. Services were above my expectations. Almost all the staff who I dealt with in this stay were very welcoming and ready to provide the maximum possible. Good Breakfast experience - ,5,2023,02,17
150,Fab service and wonderful bar,Had an amazing stay with a newly refurbished room (huge shower and heated toilet seat!)  and drinks at the Churchill bar - what a great atmosphere. Thanks again to Mr Moura and his wonderful team at the Hyatt.,5,2023,02,14
150,Welcoming and understated opulence,"Only went to use the beautiful bar and savour a cigar at the Churchill Terrace on a busy Friday evening.

The elongated bar was stunning and tranquil, served with a smile and polite conversation by the delightful Mimi.

Then the wondrous Churchill Terrace, complete with a life-sized statue with the infamous cigar smoker Winston Churchill seated, was a joy to visit. Heaters, blankets to cope with the traditional nippy English winter, very good service by a personable Greek waiter and the sumptuous aroma of a range of cigars as well as my prized Cubans.

A real find, with a remarkable selection of quite unique cocktails that include many of the former British PM, make this a real treasure.",5,2023,02,05
150,Nice hotel in the Centre of London,"I think this is a lovely hotel but you pay for the location. I stayed for one night and was upgraded to a lovely suite by virtue of my Globalist status with Hyatt. Check in was nice and quick and the staff were super friendly. I was soon off to my room which had a nice lounge area, a balcony overlooking Portland Square and the BT tower. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath - although the bath was quite small - not a ‘luxurious suite’ kind of bath!  However the amenities were by Molton Brown so very good quality, the hairdryer was of a good standard and the water pressure was fine. 

The bed was very comfortable and had plugs by the bedside. I found the room very quiet to sleep in and had a good night sleep. While I never really used the lounge, I had to take the hairdryer in there to get a mirror with a plug next to it. 

I had access to the executive lounge and it was nicely decorated - quite high end looking. The evening spread was a little disappointing although the canapés that came round regularly were a nice touch. There was french bread, cheese and ham etc out, plus some crudities and a chocolate cake.  It felt a little light but maybe that is so you go an eat elsewhere! There was a white, red and Prosecco available, plus lots of spirits.  I also went to the Churchill bar which was lovely decor, but the clientele had a lot to be desired. I had to complain about an aggressive individual in the bar - and while the staff were sympathetic - there was nothing much they were going to do about it. I left in the end and went to bed! Breakfast was in the lounge and the spread was a little better than the evening stuff - and you could get a nice continental breakfast - nothing hot.

Overall the stay was lovely - I just felt it missed the mark a little at the high end stuff - especially for the price compared to other Hyatt hotels in the area. Perhaps I am being a little picky but it just didn’t have much of a wow factor despite everything being very nice.",4,2023,02,05
150,Not the best choice in London,"Staff and the service was terrible, breakfast was underwhelming, very slow service, cold coffee. I had a pretty bad experience from check in to check out. Hotel staff lacks training and they are borderline rude. I never stayed at such a poorly managed Hyatt hotel before. You can stay at a much better place for the money spent here.",1,2023,01,30
150,Hyatt in the heart of London,In London for week-long business planning meeting with oir global team. Great location. Beautiful hotel and facilities. Staff was top-notch and went above and beyond to provide the best customer service. Such a pleasant experience at Hyatt Regency - The Churchill.,5,2023,01,20
150,Excellent hotel,I very much enjoyed my stay at this hotel..  I highly recommend this place.  Friendly and professional staff.  The restaurant is excellent.  I am a Hyatt Globalist and appreciated the warm welcome I received. Definitely will stay here again. ,5,2023,01,18
150,Amazing Stay!,"Simply wonderful! Always a pleasure staying with Hyatt! We loved the Regency club and breakfast was delicious, got great sleep with a lovely view! The staff were wonderful and caring, already looking forward to coming back next time!",5,2023,01,15
150,One of the best bars in London 5* service,"Beautiful hotel and very attentive staff. Great location as all the shops and restaurants are in walking distance.
The bar is excellent and special thanks to Boris who was very friendly and welcoming,  recommended some good cocktails to finish off a busy week. Highly recommended! ",5,2023,01,13
150,Fair hotel. Food was not fresh.,"Had a family trip in January.  We got the standard lunge and free breakfast as a globalist. However the food in the longe and breakfast was very average. 
If you taste the nuts and cookies in both lounges ( this one has two ) they are all stale like they’ve been sitting out for weeks. Even my kids refused to eat the cookies. Lol. Because they were stale. Canapés was available but after the first day we stopped coming for them  as I would rather pay for the food at a nearby bar or sandwich shop. Lounge was still convenient for sodas after a day out but not any foods. 
   
I also stopped eating at breakfast opting for just some fruit which was good. Everything else including their coffee/cafe was mediocre. 

Overall : staff were kind and professional. The gym, which was temporary , was smaller than 90% of gyms. Facilities and furniture are a bit dated and will need an update soon.",4,2023,01,11
150,Excellent location Excellent hotel Very clean and excellent service The bar is one of the best in London,In walking there are all major shops and slot of restaurants Very easy to get transportation and the people working there are very helpful to help you The concierge people are always willing to help you The hotel is very clean and during the night you can sleep ,5,2023,01,11
150,Grand Hyatt Churchill - Excellent,"As per usual the grand Hyatt exceeds expectations. Rooms are clean, they upgraded us due to my membership and organised something special for my engagement - highly recommended - this is the 6th grant Hyatt property I’ve been to worldwide and I would highly recommend for business or pleasure",5,2023,01,01
150,Good business hotel in central London,"I spent 9 nights during a business trip in December. I liked the room on the 5th floor, it was rather spacious for London standards and in very good shape. With the windows facing backwards, I could enjoy a sound sleep. I liked the breakfast, a good selection of fruits, hot dishes, as well as bread and pastries, with fresh orange juice and a very good cappuccino. I agree with previous reviewers that fresh pancakes would be better than the dry ones on the buffet, but apart from this, there is not much more to wish for. Perhaps a spa, something I feel a five star should have.

I used in-room dining once, it came quickly, but was relatively expensive. Same applies to the Churchill bar which serves small, but good cocktails, at GBP 20 each. I ended up using a dry cleaner one street down from the hotel, not wanting to clean a shirt for GBP 12 at the hotel - they charged the same, but for four shirts. 

The reception staff was very friendly, and handled my complaint about errors on the bill very professionally and in a courteous manner. 

The location is excellent, close to the shops, to subway stations, and Hyde Park. ",4,2022,12,30
150,"Hope to be honest with guests, I always book at hotel more than 10 nights but unfortunately if this going on I will hote","Bad service at the bar special with the manager as he said this table is reserved and for 3 hrs no one was there and I am regular customer and every nights I am her, so please give some much respect to regular customers……………………… …………………………………..",1,2022,12,29
150,Christmas in London,The Hyatt Regency Churchill went out of its way to make the Holiday Season very very festive. And the staff is very professional but also extremely pleasant and efficient - they can’t do enough to make your stay there exceptional.,5,2022,12,28
150,Expensive but not Calm,"Good room. Quiet . Everything works.
Location is perfectly between Self ridges and Marylebone.
Common areas thronged with large families and unruly children.
Dining room was like a motorway service station at breakfast. ",3,2022,12,27
150,two days with faily three rooms - disappointed,"1/3 Room not ready till 4.30  PM to check in.
B/fast was v poor - quality and service
Safe did not work. repairs never fixed things 
Staff were polite, nice ambience and space 
Will never stay again at this property. very poor value for money
",2,2022,12,24
150,Could be better,Their hotel is nice and was very busy when we stayed. Had a few issues with the room where stickers didn’t work and the air conditioning was poor. Mattress definitely needs to be changed. Sagging in a few places. Breakfast was nice but could do with a greater selection with the pancakes being made to order rather than stale cold ones. ,3,2022,12,23
150,How standards have slipped,"We have enjoyed a two night stay in December each year for many years (excluding the kitchen fire and Covid restrictions) in a Club room that comes with some nice extra facilities that are part of the package.
For Club guests the breakfast is not now available in the Club Lounge on the 8th floor but on the ground floor in the main restaurant. We didn’t mind waiting for a table to be available both mornings, or that some tables suffered icy blasts from the main door, what spoilt the visit was cold food. Cold bacon, fried eggs, sausage and tomatoes served on a cold plate. I don’t mean warm or even tepid, I mean stone cold both mornings. We raised the matter and nothing was done.
There is a lot of competition in central London for executive accommodation and we will not be returning to this establishment again.",1,2022,12,21
150,Fabulous location and service at the Churchill,"One of the best regency’s I have ever stayed at.. service is exceptional at this property. As a globalist was upgraded, water bottles delivered within minutes, accidentally dropped wallet during buffet and was delivered to room even before I realized. I had read reviewes about how great the service is here but staying here for 7nights I had an excellent stay and would repeat again. Plus the location is fab, bus stops and train stations all within 5 mins and lots and lots to just walk around. Keep up the great work ",5,2022,12,20
150,Pre Christmas stay,"I stayed at the Churchill for 5 nights. It is a large hotel with very nice public areas. Everything was decorated for the holiday and was very nice. As a Globalist, I wasn’t upgraded to a suite, but my room was large enough, clean and comfortable. The hallways are a bit worn but clean. There are cold breakfast offerings and coffee or tea in the lounge. If you want the free full hot breakfast, you have to go to the main restaurant. In the evening is a very nice canapé and drinks reception if you have lounge access. The staff in the lounge are great. All the people at the door, reception and bell stand are polite, efficient and professional. The only drawback for me is the location near Oxford street which can be raucous and loud. But it is the main shopping area so to be expected. I did have a hard time getting a taxi around the dinner hour. There were plenty at check out time tho. A 9 out of 10 for me. I would stay again.  ",4,2022,12,19
150,Great experience,"The Churchill was a good experience with all my needs satisfied. Centrally located hotel with friendly and profetional Staff. I can recommend the hotel for all purposes of travel, business and pleasure included.",5,2022,12,19
150,Easy and comfortable hotel in an excellent location,We needed to stay in central London so as to be in time for a hospital appointment. Staff at the Hyatt were very welcoming and ready to help with my elderly mother-in-law. The room was immaculate and we enjoyed a delicious dinner at The Montagu Kitchen.,5,2022,12,17
150,Property in decline,"Prior to COVID I had a lovely stay at the Churchill. Attentive service, wonderful amenities, smack dab in a perfect location, clean rooms, and stylish furnishings. I have no idea what happened to that hotel, because The Churchill is worse for wear.

I'm a Globalist and this year have stayed in hotels more than 100 nights. The check-in experience at The Churchill is madness. Queues are impossible to make sense of and even with all of the appropriate documents it took the agent more than 10 minutes to check me in following a wait of over 15 minutes. That start should have worried me.

My suite wasn't ready so I returned two hours after they said it would be ready, and again it was still pending. While I fully understand rooms can take a while to turnover, this was well past check-in time. The front desk staff also did something I've never experienced, they blamed me for booking a suite. 

While waiting they gave me access to the Concierge Lounge. Unattended with stale snacks and limited drinks, it was at least quiet. When I returned the next morning for breakfast, I was surprised that what used to be a buffet with warm options was a cold and unappetizing set of options.

The room, while comfortable was very basic. For an American hotel chain, only one outlet in the entire room was usable without an adapter I found the bed lumpy and the pillows almost non-existent. 

Thankfully this was only one night stay, but if a top floor suite is supposed to be their best, I could not recommend The Churchill. ",3,2022,12,15
150,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Speechless. The staff were above and beyond! I’ve stayed in a many of Hyatt and overall, service is always excellent, but was taken to another level. From the moment I arrived, until the moment we left, all of the staff loved their jobs and it shows!",5,2022,12,13
150,Great Business Hotel,"Great location for Central London meetings. Perfect location around Christmas.  Hotel staff are excellent,  restaurant and bar are great, nice food and drinks and superior service by the staff. Rooms are spacious and clean,  all the hotel staff are there to ensure you have a pleasant stay.",5,2022,12,12
150,Nice centrally located hotel,"I enjoyed staying at this hotel. The rooms are good, the bed comfy and the bathroom had all that one needs. It is clean throughout. 
The breakfast buffet offers a wide selection and they have tasty and exotic fruit based juices. The croissants are to point. 
We had lunch at the main restaurant a couple of times and it was really impressive. The food quality and presentation is excellent. 
I like the fact that one can walk to many of London’s famous places very easily.",5,2022,12,11
150,Deserves every star,"As a frequent traveler, I wondered whether The Churchill deserved its 5 star rating.  Looking online, it looked like a good, not great property in a great location.  But staying there for a week, I can say this hotel is not opulent but it has it where it counts: facilities, outstanding service, location, fine restaurant fir breakfast and a decent bar, plus very quiet in the heart of the city. Highly recommend.",5,2022,12,10
150,london trip,"excelent  location very clean and pleasent i suggest the Bar , very nice decorated , we sayed 4 nights without any problem  , the only problem was that they do serve any food even a snack from 11.00 till 12.00",4,2022,12,06
150,Perfect stay in the heart of London,"We spend four nights at the hotel. Staff was very helpfull, facilities impeccable and room according to our expectations. We travelled with our young daughter and cleanliness and comfort were a priority. We were also offered a quiet room with absolutelly no noise bothering us. All was delivered by the hotel flawlessly. The breakfast atmosphere was also nice, the location emanating a proper London club vibe. The hotel is very close to Oxford street and Hyde Park but yet isolated from the crowds and busy atmosphere. We’ll definetly return.",5,2022,12,05
150,Watch out for construction on the second floor.,"Hammering and drilling before 8AM everyday.  DO NOT STAY ON 2nd Floor.  However, the noise reverberates through nearby floors as well. Forget about relaxing in your room. Noise continues until 5PM. Very unfortunate management decides to place guests on this floor where the construction noise and paint and glue smell are simply awful.",3,2022,12,03
150,Hyatt Churchill,"Beautiful Hotel.  Nice staff, great restaurant and bar.  Highly recommend Club Level.  Very busy hotel, but excellent location.  Rooms have small bathrooms for comparable hotels, and the gym is extremely hot, and small with very low ceilings.  However, it was a great stay overall. I generally stay at IHG hotels and Hyatt bought the Blackfriar that I normally stay at when in the UK.  This was a nice change of area to be in and very close to the tube.  ",4,2022,12,01
150,Great stay at the Churchill,"I made a last minute booking after the hotel I was supposed to stay at was filthy and old and had a telephone in it that was from 1980.  Upon arrival we were quickly checked in and a room was ready immediately even though the hotel was quite busy.  The room was spacious, clean and modern.  WiFi worked great in the hotel.  I had a walk in shower which was nice.   The water pressure was ok it great but the bathroom was very clean and updated as was everything else in the room. The Beds and pillows were amazing as well.   I would definitely stay here again without question and it’s only a 5 minute walk to the Marble Arch underground station which was very convenient and same walk to Hyde Park. Even room service was decently priced for a hotel.  Found this gem after checking in and right out of the Marriott Marble arch.  That was a 0 star hotel that would’ve not been cheap.  ",5,2022,11,28
150,Very disappointing,"Very slow check in and check out and little acknowledgement to any needs one might expect as a minimum. Absolutely totally disappointed overall.  I've travelled globally across geographies for years with work and hoped to have a truly luxury experience staying at a so called 5 star rated hotel in my own city.  Staff were totally negligent to assist from the minute I arrived in my car . I stopped on the forecourt awaiting a porter to help take items from my car whilst I went to park the car and absolutely no one paid any attention. Eventually I went into the hotel to find a security guard to assist me. The other porters were at the desk.  Then check took over 20 mins . Standing waiting - exactly the same for check out.   My husband had paid for the room in advance at an extortionate rate for what in the end was a small room and the tiniest of bathrooms, I requested coffee and croissant in my room in the morning.  This was charged additionally. Spoiled a special family weekend and at such inflated charges.",1,2022,11,28
150,"Good location but fairly worn, not quite up to Hyat standards"," The basic room was fair sized for the city, but the bathroom had a shower splash guard mis-installed so that it always dumped water on the floor.  The bathroom counter had permanent stains and the varnish had well worn off the stone a long time ago.  The property was high traffic oandthe furnishings were somewhat worn.  The checkin/dusk staff was busy and tired, and it was not possible to upgrade a room on points, despite broad availability.   The staff did offer to upgrade the room for and additional 600 pounds per night, but given the condition of the room we had, the hotel did not seem to warrant anywhere near that kind of luxury premium.   I made the mistake of making a brief local call from the room phone and was charged 11 pounds for that.   I think that we’ll try somewhere different on our next trip to London.  ",3,2022,11,27
150,Memorable stay,"We had a warm welcome and good bye from Garfield, also very warm welcome and checkin by Natalia. Our room was upgraded to KING we also had a cake ready  in the room on my daughter’s birthday. The staff in the restaurant was helpful with friendly atmosphere. The breakfast was a treat for us. Me and husband enjoyed the stay.

The only thing disappointed me was cleanliness of the room. I am also working for Hyatt. As a staff I would like to get to the managers notice so that this is not been faced by the other guests. I have already spoken to Pedro from Housekeeping and I am sure he will not let this happen to any other guests.

WE CARE FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE THIER BEST

150,Howard’s Visit to the Hyatt Regency The Churchill ,"Impressive entrance to the hotel. Staff were efficient and we were given access to the executive lounge, while we waited 2 hours before our suite was ready. The executive lounge only had bare minimum things on offer- biscuits, cake, coffee and soft drinks. We went back at 5.30 when the food and bar opened, plenty of drinks available but the food was disappointing for an executive lounge, only cold meats, cheeses and some nibbles. The suite was good, clean, lovely bed and good sized bathroom.",4,2022,11,14

150,Dell excellent doorman,Dell was such a pleasure to speak with and always made my day by welcoming me to London. He was so helpful and answered any questions I had. He always greeted me with a smile and was a great part of the Hotel.,5,2022,11,03
150,"Wonderful, Thanks for everything…","That is my hotel from now on, whenever I go to London…. Everything was great. That is a family hotel for sure. The Breakfast was amazing and the cleanliness of rooms are amazing. I suggest to everyone.",5,2022,11,03
150,Chilled at the London Churchill,"Easy stay at the Churchill!  Amazing location, excellent service & the perfect breakfast.   Standard rooms are on the smaller side, but a great stay!  Everything worked as expected.   A very welcoming service from the moment you enter. 

Paddington Station about a 10 min uber away if you are catching the Heathrow express ",5,2022,11,03
150,"Great service, staff and location!",Had a great time in the hotel made so by the fantastic staff. Location is very central and just a short cab ride to the theatre and all the shops are on your doorstep. Lovely view of the park across the road!,5,2022,11,02
150,Good Comfy and near to Tube Station,Fantastic location and very comfortable room for business meeting. Room condition is perfect and breakfast is of good quality. Definitely will come back again next time whether for business or holidays. ,4,2022,11,01
150,Incredible service and location,"The Hyatt Churchill never fails!  The staff is unbelievably helpful on just the ordinary things such as check-in, getting rooms for colleagues, luggage, etc.  However, why I come back (on each trip) is the added luxuries such as the staff knowing my name and saying hi even if I'm walking through the lobby, the club lounge which has delicious canapes (it's becoming quite the scene) and a quiet good nights sleep.  Thank you Churchill!",5,2022,11,01
150,superb location for moving around,"The Hotel has great location for Shopping , dining and traveling around . The service team is very friendly and helpful . Only disappointment was the Club lounge as there was shortage of space due to renovation . ",4,2022,11,01
150,First time back after 3 years,"It was our first international trip since the pandemic and we were so excited to return to the Churchill. 

This trip exceeded our expectations. The concierge, front desk, managers in the Montagu and the staff in the regency club hall made our trip spectacular. 

We will be back. ",5,2022,10,31
150,24/7 gym on the second floor,"If you want to sleep well make sure you ask that your room is on any floor except the 2nd floor one because there is a 24/7 gym that operates there. The hotel made no effort to compensate even with a gesture for the awful night I spent, they just changed my room as if nothing happened. my put me in a room for starters with a wall to wall (litteraly) gym ",3,2022,10,31
150,Restaurant  meal fiasco,"In the area so thought the Montague restaurant in the hotel would provide an acceptable meal being a 5 star hotel. First impressions ok - smart public and restaurant areas.  Unfortunate accident when one dish was dropped on the floor - expected to be moved to another table - no chance - put up with staff cleaning round the table for 10 minutes - even though the place was 80% empty with dozens of unused tables. The second guest was served while the first guest sat with part of the course on the table waiting for the rest to be re cooked. The obvious sensible course would have been to take all the food away - moved to a new table and have both meals served together.  Asked for the prawns, which had been left getting cold for 10 minutes, to be re cooked and they simply re heated and re served them. We're talking here about courses costing in excess of £40 plus service! The 'baby chicken' ordered by the second guest consisted of a burnt chicken piece hammered flat. Told them to take the service charge off the bill and the female maitre d informed us that they had supplied 2 cakes in compensation - these obviously came from the remains of the afternoon tea and one had a nibble taken from it. The maitre d was surly, uncommunicative and dismissive after a badly cooked, inefficiently served, overpriced meal and obviously has no control over the waiting staff as the server who dropped the tray was giggling about it with a co worker! One has to wonder if the management of these hotels actually visit the restuarant and eat its offerings. Place was busy with tourists and it is embarrassing to think they are being given this level of service and poor cooking in a 5 star hotel in London at a cost of £180 (without the service charge)",1,2022,10,31
150,Excellent location for the west end!,"We stayed here for one night whilst in London for a shopping trip with my daughter. We arrived at the hotel around lunch time and was able to check in straight away. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was so comfortable, so much so that we woke up late the next morning!

Situated just behind Selfridges, Oxford Street, this is a fantastic base if you are in London shopping and exploring for the weekend.",5,2022,10,30
150,Business meetings,"Arrived early Sat morning and was able to get a room in advance of the normal check in time,  Service for the entire week was excellent.  Food options and drink selections were exceptional. I will be back to London and will select this hotel again.
",5,2022,10,29
150,Excellent welcoming stay,"My wife and I stayed at The Churchill for one night for our Anniversary. Everything about the stay was perfect. 

The welcome given at reception/check in was truly exceptional service, especially by John who checked us in. We felt like a VIP from the moment we arrived. 

The hotel is very well kept, the rooms very spacious for central London and in excellent condition. Everything was exactly as we wanted it to be.",5,2022,10,29
150,This Hotel's King Beds Are Not Always What They should Be  ,"I have stayed here many times and the location is great. Hotel rates are so high in London these days and this hotel was no exception. I used points to stay and the cost using points was one of the most expensive of staying in any Hyatt property. Unfortunately the management didn't like my criticism of the two twin beds joined together to make a king. I have no problem with this and this is often the case, however no guest should be able to feel the join when sleeping at night. Most good quality hotels provide a mattress topper thick enough that the guest cannot feel the join, but not at this hotel. They had a very thin topper, I could feel the join, at 11.30pm I have to get out of bed to ask them to sort of the bed. They wanted to move me to another room which would have meant delaying the sleep even further so I asked them to bring a thick topper which they did. Problem solved, however when I asked why they dont put thick toppers on all beds in a quality hotel like this, they simply said 'we have noted your preference and will make sure you get a topper in future' - be careful if you book this hotel and make sure you get the sleep experience you are entitled to - again, no one should feel the join of the twin beds zipped together and no one should have to deal with this at 11.30pm at night after going to bed. The hotel refused to compensate me. !!          ",3,2022,10,27
150,The daily discretionary service charge,"I am not happy with this , not informed about it on check in - I decide if and how much I tip. 25 GBP each day ! The girl hid behind her monitor looking a little embarrassed.I’ll be aware on this one next time - otherwise a nice stay .",3,2022,10,22
150,Great Location,"The hotel location is great. Two blocks off of Oxford Street and great shopping. The hotel itself is a bit dated. Rooms were a bit smallish, but clean. It was comfortable for one and probably two. The Regency room was nice, with free beer and wine for Hyatt members. The restaurant was delicious, though there are a few decent pubs nearby. Service was great…staff was attentive and friendly. Overall a very nice place to stay but rather overpriced.",4,2022,10,21
150,Quintessential Hotel at the Heart of London,"I stayed here for five nights on a business trip. There are so many excellent features provided by this quintessential hotel which is a stone throw from Oxford Street and Hyde Park. Among others, is the comfort that the hotel provided. From the most comfortable bed and pillows I ever had, the shower, the space, the breakfast and also the excellent English style club lounge. 

I would also like to commend the excellent services from the hotel staff which look very dedicated in maintaining the establishment as prestige as its name. The breakfast was also very good with good varieties. Although the breakfast hours were very busy but the staff have serve us very well.

I also have the opportunity the hang out at the Churchill Bar & Terrace and was amazed by the extensive cigar menu they have. It was a cozy and busy bar that I miss so much. 

Hope to come back to this hotel again one day.",5,2022,10,21
150,Amazing Hotel,"This Hotel is located walking distance of Oxford Street. The all experience was really fantastic, the food the room & the staff, amazing hotel, we enjoyed our visite and look forward to come back to this hotel.",5,2022,10,20

150,The Ideal Place to Stay in London,"We had a lovely five-night stay at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill, one of our favorite Hyatt properties. The hotel is beautiful; the location on Portman Square is pretty and convenient to London's restaurants, museums, and attractions; our suite was spacious and well-appointed; the delicious breakfast had a wide range of hot and cold options; the staff was friendly and always attentive; and we valued the Regency Club lounge, The Churchill Bar, and other hotel amenities. I cannot think of a better place to stay in London. ",5,2022,10,20
150,Great hotel in a great location with exceptional staff.,The Hyatt Churchill is an amazing property that went above and beyond to make our stay there as welcoming as possible.  It is conveniently located to many attractions and underground stations so getting across London was a breeze. ,5,2022,10,18
150,It's always nice to come back.,"In April, I was here together with my nephews,

And then my sister joined us. We had such a 

wonderful time. That I've decided, that although 

I'm back  just for 1 night in London. It has to be the

Churchill. I am so glad that I did. I got here real

early, after a long way from Liverpool. Right 

About 10:30 am. I got the room straight away.

It's super comfy!!!! And also a late checkout, 'till 

2pm, completely free. Thanks a lot😊 As

I'm coming  back many times to Liverpool and 

London. I'll for sure will come to this place, again 

And again.",5,2022,10,16
150,Execellent stay.,"Nice room, Clean and everything works. The Breakfast is plentiful. Meeting room is rather small and a bit old, but still good. Restaurants and bars are within walking distance. Just off Oxford street easy for shopping. 10 minutes walk to London Marylebone station, from there a hour away from Biscester Village Outlet Malls.",5,2022,10,15
150,Great hotel with great service,"The Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill is not a big hotel, but it's lavishly decorated and has excellent service. Everyone, from the doorman to the front desk to the housekeep was extremely friendly and polite. The rooms are small compared to American standards, but more than adequate for two adults. It was clean and has all the amenities you would expect. Despite the fact that the hotel said there would be no daily housekeeping, they did provide it which was a pleasant surprise. The only real issue that we had was with the bathroom. The bathtub was way too deep, and you have to be careful when coming out of it to not slip and fall. Also, there is a lack of racks from which to hang used towels and there is no socket for the hairdryer in the bathroom.

Location-wise, this hotel is very close to the Marble Arch Tube station and the bus stations nearby. It's also about a twenty-minute walk to Paddington Station and about fifteen minutes by car to King's Cross. You are also just minutes away from Hyde Park. There are plenty of good restaurants and cafes around. Would definitely stay here again if I come back to London.",5,2022,10,14
150,bad experience for couples,the hotel service and staff was not professional from the reception to housekeeping . the room was dirty when we come ... reception and the manager doesn't know what to do i had to pay another time because the card machine doesn't work .. and waiting for the bank to release the money on hold .,1,2022,10,14
150,Great hotel-  perfect for everything,Perfect location.  Close to shops and underground.  Felt safe walking at night.  Breakfast was really good.  Huge selection-  attentive staff.  Rooms are smaller size as most European rooms are.  Staff was friendly.  ,5,2022,10,12
150,Business meeting success,"An amazing venue to host any business meeting, great hotel along with the most nicest staff who literally go above and beyond to cater for every need. I couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough as well as their event team, fantastic and will be booking again soon! Thank you to all. ",5,2022,10,07
150,An amazing place to stay.,"We stayed for 3 nights in October using World of Hyatt points. All the staff were helpful and friendly, the room was perfect and plenty of hot water in a deep bath. Getting an egg for breakfast was a bit chaotic but got it eventually. Would gladly stay again.",5,2022,10,07
150,Great service,"From the bellman who always was helpful and smiling, two the girls on the 8th floor reception, who appreciated we were in hurry late for a show, they got the paperwork done in record time and got me a much needed coffee. Breakfast the next was great. ",5,2022,10,07
150,Great stay at the Churchill,"We had a really nice stay at The Churchill.  I found the rooms to be comfortable, well equipped and very clean.  Great location within easy walking distance of restaurants and shopping.  The breakfast buffet was delicious as well.  We will return!",5,2022,10,07
150,Warm welcome in London,The Hyatt Churchill is a walk out location where you will receive a warm welcome. The rooms are good size for London. You will be made to feel special because the team cares. We did have a challenge with an impolite server in the breakfast restaurant but this was addressed and we were very satisfied with how it was handled. Against other London premier properties this The Churchill is excellent value. ,5,2022,10,04
150,"Turned into a ""mass production"" hotel","Been staying here for quite some time. This time all was not so personal, we were told to wait until 16./00 to check into the room with no space to sit on lobby cause so many people were already there waiting. The girl at the desk was new, took her 20 mins to check us in when we had already filled everything on the Booking site. The room was the same since many years ago meaning the floor carpet never changed. The rest was ok. Bar hotel didn't allow our 11 year old inside , so we ended up in the restaurant / didnt know families were not welcome after 5pm generally... ",3,2022,10,04
150,excellent stay especially for business,"Friendly staff, clean safe room, fantastic full breakfast included if you have the proper level of Hyatt membership, top location, safe and fun to walk around. 5 min walk from major tube (subway). I would stay here again.",5,2022,10,01
150,Excellent Hotel,"Our stay at the Hyatt Regency London The Churchill exceeded our expectations.  We arrived at the hotel shortly after 9 am, and although check in was not until 3 pm, we were in our room by 11:15am. Guest Services was very acomodating during our entire stay.The breakfast buffet  offered an excellent variety of hot and cold choices including  made to order eggs. The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the hotel was very conveniently located and walkable to historical sites. We would definitely stay here again when in London and recommend this hotel highly.",5,2022,10,01
150,Very good experience,"I was not so happy with this hotel before, but it seems they got their act together very very well. I am a courtesy member of Hyatt, and I had asked them to not upgrade me as I wanted my booked balcony suite as I wanted to smoke. Instead, they upgrade my friend to a simliar suite :) -- late check out was offered, all emenities were very nice. Room service, I am sorry, is British food quality, but you can survive it :) -- All people in the hotel were really nice and professionel. This time I could not go to the bar of which I know from a former stay that it was outstanding. If I am in London, I will always go to the Hyatt Churchill. Very good sleeping quality in their beds!",5,2022,09,28
150,Classical hotel,a great stylish hotel in a good location.  friendly and competent staff.  delicious and varied breakfast.  good dinner food too.  the conference facilities and servings are modest. Many good wines and drinks in bar,4,2022,09,23
150,Not a 5 star experience.,"Booked a family room for a few nights on two seperate occasions in September 2022. We had issues here. 

Check in process took over 30 mins at our second visit. Not sure what they we’re doing.   

Connecting door in our family room was not open and was stuck. Rang reception and it took them 40 mins to open the door. This was after a long trip from Australia with 3 tired children. Second visit again the connection door was not opened and it took us about 10 mins to do it ourselves. I think if a family room is booked, it would be good to just have this door opened and ready when guests come to the room. Either that or repair the door so it can be easily opened. 

We asked for an extra bed. On our second visit, extra bed was not in the room. When we rang and asked reception, they advised us that they could send one up but that it was not on the booking. This was despite the extra bed being requested and confirmed on our booking. 

For a 5 star hotel, the experience certainly was not that. If you are booking this hotel as a family, look elsewhere first. ",2,2022,09,22
150,Unbelievabe experience with this hotel!!,We loved coming back to the room every day.. They cleaned the room in the morning and even checked on us in the afternoon.. Room was perfect and clean. never needed for anything our whole trip.  TY Hyatt!! ,5,2022,09,18
150,Great place to stay,"This was our 4th visit to the Churchill hotel never disappointed friendly and efficient staff very good rooms great breakfast and a great location for shopping would not stay anywhere else when visiting London 
",5,2022,09,13
150,Overnight stay,"Really excellent and efficient service in all areas. Delicious food, with interesting presentation. The signature sticky toffee pudding is worth coming back for. Rooms ample size and beds very comfortable. Rooms are quiet despite the hotel being in the heart of busy London.",5,2022,09,13
150,Beautiful stay,"We loved our stay at the Churchill and would come back in a heartbeat. The staff was SO accommodating and met every expectation and exceeded others. It was also perfectly located, just a little off the busiest parts of the city but close enough to everything we wanted to see.  The rooms were SO quiet also and the blackout curtains were so helpful - everything was so conducive to us getting much needed rest after long travel (and jet-lagged) days. ",5,2022,09,12
150,Disappointing room with high water and power waste.,"The room was awful- very crowded, no armchair, awful view of a wall less than 3 feet away and a flat roof. The water flow was very wasteful taking an age to deliver hot water. The Japanese toilet seat controls did not work so the seat remained burning hot. The room thermostat was very bright which wasted energy and disturbed sleep. Overall a huge waste of energy and water.",1,2022,09,11
150,Scam and poor customer service,"First and foremost, I had used a total of 175k Hyatt points for my stay which was deducted from my account at booking (March 2022). Upon check out, they had also charged my credit card in actual dollar without my authorization for total of 7 nights. In fact, I did confirm during my check-in that no fee (other than accidental fee) would be charge on my card as my room had already been paid for (by points).
I only found out about a week later when I was going through my statement. Travelers, please be aware and ALWYAS check your statement at each stay. This was my mistake for trusting Hyatt.

From customer service standpoint, this was not what I had expected from a fine establishment like Hyatt, particularly with its In-Room dining service. There seems to be confusion what you can, or cannot order via In-Room dining or the actual restaurant on the first floor. All I wanted was an order of scone and a pot of tea, the restaurant sent me up and requested that I should order room service (which is fine), then room service denied my order and stated that I should order in person only (okay?), then I went back down to place my order (and they told me to go back up). At this point, I just gave up...

Come on, this is what you can expect from a Hyatt now?! Go figure.",1,2022,09,06
150,really wanted to give it 5 stars,"very close to great.  supurb location, excellent breakfast buffet, decent sized rooms and most importantly, an extremely friendly staff.  connected family rooms are great with two bathrooms.  Montague Street restaurant is exceptional, especially for the cost.

small but pretty annoying things - housekeeping came into our room despite 'do not disturb' signs hanging (connected rooms).  stupid open showers that leak on to bathroom floor no matter how careful you are - wouldn't you just like a shower curtain rather than having to be super careful anyway??  could use some 110 outlets or converters.  would be nice to have some parking option, even if valeted.

so overall, maybe it's 4.5 stars, but can't give it 5 since it's not exactly cheap.  i'd recommend but set expecations.",4,2022,09,06
150,Wonderful stay,"The check was perfect, needed to change our bed from a queen to a king and it was done with no problems.  Our floor was quiet, soundproof rooms helped. Bathroom was a little small, but best things was we had a wash jet toilet.  Thank you so much. Love this invention.  Food was wonderful…had the tasting menu the first night.  Breakfast was had everything you can think of.  Our housekeepers were lovely ladies.  Always ready with extra soaps, towels and water. All the doorman were overly friendly and helpful. We were greeted every time with a cheerful hello. We stayed 9 days so can honestly say thank you for a wonderful stay.  We will be back. The location is the best.  Close to major stores and Buckingham and train station, oh let’s not forget Selfridges one block away. ",5,2022,09,04
150,Bad,Very bad services and really discounted from the way they deal with us and with several follow I raised a complain and no action  I was following up till date with new result !!!!!! I had borrowed money from friends to be able to complete my vacation as your team applied hold on the accounts two times and debited once !!!!,2,2022,09,02
150,Nothing special to come back,"Small room, bad cleaning and superficial cleaning by housekeeping despite tips every day. No special welcome also if I was diamond member for several years… nothing. … just a bad to sleep. Unbelievable that the famous bar was closed Sunday and Monday… should be a 5 stars…",2,2022,08,26
150,This Hyatt Regency is more a cross between a Grand Hyatt & a Park Hyatt,"I've stayed in many Hyatt Regency hotels, but this one excels in every way.  The service was great and the rooms were large by London standards.  We especially enjoyed the breakfast in the restaurant each morning.  There was so much to pick from and it was all excellent.  The fish & chips in their restaurant are excellent as well.  We enjoyed having beers in the lounge in the evenings.  The staff would come around with the most delicious hors d'oeuvres as a special treat to go along with the meats, cheeses, breads & desserts.",5,2022,08,18
150,Very good hotel central in London,"Rooms are clean and quiet located near mayfair. The bed is perfect (king size 183x200cm) and the bathroom is well
Equipped with shower and bath.
Breakfast is a perfect big buffet With pastries and sausage eggs bacon fruits cheeses meats salmon yoghurt donuts …
It is a bit noisy for breakfast but this is the only drawback I see",5,2022,08,17
150,Fraud activity by the front desk rep,"I had a confirmed reservation with a clear rate of 833 per night and they charged me 1559 per night at the check out taking advantage that I was in a rush to catch my flight!
The confirmation from Hotels.com clearly say the price includes all taxes and fees and they still charged me 59 fee per night.",1,2022,08,14
150,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel and rooms. Great attention to detail. The concierge staff were very helpful!
It was very warm in the room. 
 The only cover was a down comforter and not a separate sheet under it  so was very hot during the night. Had to keep turning down the temperature but still too warm. ",5,2022,08,10
150,Quick London Visit,"Great stay overall. The breakfast had delicious food and a good variety. When there was a miscommunication during our stay, the staff was quick to remedy the situation.

150,Big Hyatt Churchill fan,"Been traveling to same area for over 10 years and was a Marriott devotee until this year.  After 4 trips to the hotel this year, the Hyatt Churchill converted me!

Thank you to the Hyatt Churchill Staff!!!",5,2022,08,08
150,Perfect Location for shoppers and friendly services you ever imagine!,"Very good location to shop till you drop, Breakfast foods are variety not too bad but not international need to add some zinc on the various foods. Staff are nice and friendly and a very good services that other hotels should try to match it.

150,Ideal location,"Ideally located, just few meters away from oxford street
Staff are very welcoming.. 
Great food and the lobby is nice and cozy.
Rooms are clean and newly renovated (we were there in February and not all the rooms were renovated at that time, so make sure you ask for a room in the newly renovated section just in case renovation wasn’t complete yet), and toilets have a bidet sprayer 👏🏻👏🏻
Major downside of the hotel is how small the rooms are + quite pricy",4,2022,07,29
150,CLASS,"This hotel is in the center of everything!! From shopping to restaurants to bar hopping. 
The breakfast was on top! The service is impeccable! Nice smell all over the hotel. The guys on Churchill bar were very accommodating too! We will definitely come back :)",5,2022,07,27
150,Excellent home away from home,"My 7 days stay at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill was quite refreshing and I would recommend anyone wishing to spend some nights in London to give it a try ….my stay was rewarding…bed was very comfortable, excellent gym and functional amenities to make one’s stay relaxing ",4,2022,07,25
150,"Excellent location, spacious rooms & great service","We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a fantastic location for walking to the beautiful Marylebone High St shopping precinct, Mayfair, Hyde/St James/Green parks, or the tube. Our rooms were spacious and quiet, and enjoyed a very pleasant view over the square. The breakfast buffet was extensive and we particularly appreciated the level of attention to allergies. Most of all though, we had fantastic service, particularly from Thomas who looked after us so attentively and went ""above and beyond"" our expectations to make us comfortable despite our 7am arrival. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2022,07,21
150,"Classic, Warm Hospitality in London","The Hyatt Regency London-The Churchill provided everything we needed and more for our stay in London recently.  The excellent hospitality, accommodations, graciousness and efficiency of the staff provided us with the perfect environment for our visit.  The food in the restaurant and club lounge was tasty and varied, room service was convenient with a well-rounded menu, and the staff paid attention to details which isn't always typical of large-city properties.  The location was near transportation and shopping, sight-seeing, and whatever we needed.  It's a lovely property with a well-managed staff.  We will definitely return there! ",5,2022,07,21
150,Not a good experience,"It was not a good experience at Hyatt Churchill, despite exchange with a guest coordinator the day before, a 3 pm check in-in and a reminder at 6pm, the room was not ready for sleeping at almost 11pm. One star for the breakfast and another one for the location.",2,2022,07,18
150,Classic yet modern and large hotel in terrific area of Central London,"We stayed here for seven nights as tourists, just after the Queen's Jubilee Celebration, and had a wonderful stay.  The hotel is conveniently located across from Portman's Square and is near the Tube locations on Bond Street and also Marble Arch as well, so it makes getting around London quite easy.  The location of the hotel is in a residential type neighborhood and is very walkable, safe, and easy to remember your location due to the large footprint of the hotel and 9 stories as well.

We upgraded via Hyatt Globalist to a standard suite, which while not huge, was still large for a hotel room in London.  It really did make for a much more comfortable visit during our one week stay there.

As Globalist we received a couple nice perks including access to the Concierge Lounge and daily breakfast in the main dining room.  As this was most likely peak season (early June) the hotel was quite busy, seemingly with mostly tourists, mixed in with some business people.

The one downside for us was the busy breakfast restaurant from about 9:30pm on as it was flooded with families getting ready to start their day.  We had the breakfast Buffett each day which offered a full English Breakfast, as well as a couple other buffet stations throughout the large room for pastries, yogurts, cheese/deli meats/ fruit etc.  While the food was fine, the restaurant after 9:30am or so was so bustling with people, servers etc, you really had to watch out for people coming and going, it wasn't very relaxing at the busy hours and sometimes we would have a wait getting seated for breakfast.

Alternatively, if you get there early which we did for two days, once at 7am when they open, and another time around 8am, the restaurant is a much more leisurely pace and much more enjoyable.  Early risers definitely have the advantage here, at least in the busy summer tourist season.

The room itself was comfortable king size bed and bedding.  We brought our American power adapter and extension cord and had no trouble charging our multiple electronic devices. 

Housekeeping services were excellent throughout our stay.

The Concierge Lounge was a bit small for hosting that many people, but they did offer some nice  hors d'oeuvres and complimentary wine, beer, and spirits from 5:30pm to 7:30pm. A couple nights there was not enough seating for everyone during these peak hours.

We did not use the restaurant except for breakfast, but it definitely wasn't crowded in the evening for dinner from looking in as we went out for dinner. The restaurant was pricey, but the menu wasn't particularly appealing to us, especially after long days of sightseeing.  We did enjoy a couple of the nearby pubs for dinner which was easy, fun, good food and offered a more local feel to it.

We also did not utilize Churchill's Bar, mainly out of time and because we enjoyed the pubs, but it looked a bit more formal, and the busy outdoor section (separate entrance from the indoor section) allowed cigar smoking which you could smell strongly when walking by; again not for us, but others seemed to enjoy it from the crowds.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay here with it's wonderful location, and are looking forward to our next stay when we return to London in November.",5,2022,07,17
150,Wonderful stay! Definitely will return,"I had such a wonderful stay at Hyatt Regency The Churchill . I applaud their efforts in pleasing their customers. Despite being understaff (after Covid phenomena) , they all try so hard to please.  I will definitely return to this hotel again and again
Location is perfect 
",5,2022,07,16
150,Much Better,"Visited recently with my family. We had two rooms for two nights.
I must say. I was not impressed at all.
There are lots of better places in the area. Very slow service. Literally took 45 minutes or more to check in, and I have high Hyatt status. I called and asked for wine but never got it. Much of the space needs an upgrade too. 
Comfy beds though. Good location for Bond St shopping.",1,2022,07,12
150,The best,"Staff are very helpful and nice, very clean hotel and the location is just perfect.. the room was super clean and the whole experience was just perfect, Natalia the front desk is very helpful and professional ",5,2022,07,09
150,Great hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and we were very happy with everything while we were there. It’s close to the Marble Arch tube stop, Hyde Park, Mayfair, marylebone and other great locations. Easy ride on the tube to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, etc. our room was great and the receptionist when we checked in was amazing. We definitely recommend staying here.",5,2022,07,08
150,"Great place, great staff!","Great staff, everything goes smoothly there. Access to the lounge is wonderful, during the checkin, the person proposed us to wait there until the room was ready.I will definitely recommend this hotel. Clean, large room, professional team. ",5,2022,07,08
150,Nice hotel easy location amazing food,Lovely hotel. Very comfortable beds. Great location. Concierge was helpful in suggesting places for dinner. The hotel restaurant was amazing. Not your average hotel restaurant.  Elevators were quick. Overall excellent hotel and would recommend.,4,2022,07,06
150,Don't bother...dated and dirty,"Don't listen to the reviews with five stars...this is closer to an old Holiday Inn or Best Western. Very dated rooms. Housekeeping was in such a rush to clean our room, they just left the old linen on it. There were hairs on the linen when we pulled back the covers and the linen was wrinkled and used. The bathrooms were also not clean. The hotel's solution was to send a cleaning crew right away but by this time, we were already completed disgusted. It made us wonder about the hygiene of the kitchen and buffet. The executive lounge is dated and not special. It didn't appear to be staffed. The whole hotel needs a major facelift. Definitely not worth the money. Don't bother...even the location isn't so great. There are far better hotels and locations in London. I'm sorry we wasted our Member's points on this filthy hotel for one of the nights. When we complained to the management, their solution was to restore a portion of our points. This was useless to us. Most decent hotels would have been horrified to hear about the lack of cleanliness and given one night complimentary. ",1,2022,07,06
150,Simple is the best..,"High standard of fundamental services, no excessives gave me fabulous comfort. It was fun to jog around in near-by Hyde Park in the morning! It was also comvinient to go shopping as almost walking distance.",4,2022,07,04
150,Classy Hotel In The Heart of London,"Nice clean hotel, within walking distance to many tourist attractions including Buckingham Palace and Big Ben.  My family always felt safe in the area even at night. The free bottled waters provided in the room was a nice touch. We were greeting each morning and afternoon by friendly hotel staff as we came and went.",5,2022,07,04
150,Every Employee we met was the Best!,"We stayed at the Churchill for two nights with Club Access and loved every minute of it. Every employee we encountered was cheerful and professional. I will say MOST of the fellow guests we encountered were some of the worst human beings I have EVER encountered. In my few days at the Churchill I witnessed some of the RUDEST behavior I have seen in my 56 years of life! Seriously Unbelievable. All of the employees at this hotel ALWAYS responded with such professionalism! We retreated often to the Club Lounge where again we were treated like royalty by the Lounge staff. One person I'd like to especially mention was Garfield, one of the Front Door Staff, he made me laugh and smile every time we saw him...he had that door open before I even thought about going through it!",5,2022,07,03
150,Great stay,"Lovely hotel. Have stayed here a couple of times. Never disappointed. Good welcome, clean rooms. Close to many nice restaurants in the area. Stayed over a weekend. The in house restaurant is also very nice.",5,2022,07,01
150,Wonderful stay,"Wonderful stay in quiet, we’ll appointed rooms yet still in a fantastic, walkable area. The beds were amazing. The staff was helpful and kind. It is close to public transport and taxis are readily available in front of the hotel. ",5,2022,06,30
150,Revenge Travel Central,"Had a quick two day turnaround for meetings in London and hotels are over the top in rates. Had to pay over $1000 a night for a Regency which used to be $500 at the absolute peak of weekends or events. Not to blame the Hyatt, it's all of London, they are all milking this summer for everything they can. However, one would expect, perhaps as a a Lifetime and Annual Globalist, that they might offer something in return for those regular guests before and in the future? Investing in those that are the long haul guests from before and will be later? Nothing, no welcome amenity, no upgrade, no care.

Further, the hotel is so understaffed and completely booked so as to be chaos half the time. They had security staff working as bellman and it seemed most employees were completely overwhelmed. I get that, times are tough getting staff. But at $1000 a night at a Regency you think they could offer one basic thing in return, a Globalist breakfast as room service. Wanting to avoid the mess of trying to get my Globalist breakfast in the over crowded and understaffed restaurant I ordered room service. This Regency property was actually so cheap as to not even offer me a partial Globalist credit towards it. Not like I was looking for a complete write off, I just asked for some sort of credit towards it. They refused. Anything. Not even a token gesture.

That's fine, when revenge travel is over and the global recession sets in and properties like this are saying, ""Uh oh, now what"" I will happily reside elsewhere.  I don't forget easily.",2,2022,06,29
150,"Hairs in bath tub, sink , WC and glasses in room","It take a long time in reception to make change because of computer service. Need more communication between staff. Hotel in a great location. Breakfast good, gluten free options.  Good attention in Restaurant by Chef Carlo and Ela in breakfast service, Julien at reception and Attu very helpful by find locations near from hotel and luggage.",2,2022,06,29
150,"Good location, not much else","Good location, good food, medium quality service, very small and unconfortable bathrooms, even in suites, bad sanitation In rooms. No authority from managers innorder to solve problems. Worst experience on a Hyatt in many years of being a loyal member. ",2,2022,06,29
150,"6-night stay in this lovely, comfortable hotel in a quiet London location...","We had a very nice stay at this lovely hotel June 2022. The room was well maintained and offered us a view overlooking the private Portman Square. We were delighted with the location, the air conditioning in the hotel and the breakfast buffet. The bed was very comfortable and housekeeping was fine. There are many hotels that have flashy location and names, but we prefer understated luxury and the Churchill gave us what we love in a hotel. We will plan to return when we next visit London.",5,2022,06,29
150,"A nice, but dated hotel in need refreshing","Step back into the 70s in this hotel, old fashioned tub shower with plexiglass shield, dated furnishing and room decor and a dining buffet in part a hallway, plus really loud. Very nice, helpful staff.",3,2022,06,22
150,Poor experience from a Hyatt fan,"I have been a Hyatt globalist since 2015. Which means I go out of my way to stay at their hotels. Even when their foot print is small. Which means I expect to be treated well when I stay with them. And for the most part, they have great hotels and amazing employees. Until I met Waris Darshan, this hotel's extremely poorly trained Guest Relations Manager. 
To say I was treated poorly is an understatement. Pretty humiliating experience. 
Loyalty is hard to earn, and once you have it, its hard to lose. Waris Darshan was single handedly able to convince me that I should not try and maintain my loyalty with Hyatt any more. Shameful.",1,2022,06,22
150,Problems at Breakfast and Room,"We had to queue for breakfast on June 17. Also, we left our room at 8:30 am and came back by 6:00 pm and room was not cleaned yet. Thinking that these problems should not occur in a 5 stars Hyatt Regency hotel.",3,2022,06,21
150,What a disappointment,You pay £500 for an OK room with no view (it was room 318). The air conditioning wasn’t working and it was hot. You can’t open the windows beyond 6 inches because they are blocked. The engineers did their best but the air conditioning was still worse than useless. They gave us a fan… it’s supposed to be a 5 star hotel and we end up in a sweaty room with a fan… absolutely awful experience ,2,2022,06,21
150,Great Stay!,"Our family of 3 stayed here for 3 nights and had an enjoyable stay.  The room was quiet and comfortable (a little small but that was expected).  It was a King Room (with an American King, not a European King which is closer to an American Queen) and we had a rollaway bed which the 13 year old said was comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay here!",5,2022,06,19
150,"Excellent location, excellent stay","IT is an excellent hotel with a fabulous location a few steps from Oxford street and New Bond street. Superb service, very tasteful breakfast.

Rooms with lounge access is a very good selection to add some special advantages to the stay.

Thank you all the team.",5,2022,06,17
150,Churchill Hotel,"Excellent location just off Oxford Street. Walkable to many parts of London but also easy access to underground. Hotel in good condition and outstanding breakfast although priced at £25, I think worth it for the amount of time we spent relaxing over breakfast.",5,2022,06,15
150,Another excellent stay at our favorite hotel in London,"The Hyatt London Churchill is my family's favorite hotel in London due to the location, good condition of the hotel and the friendly staff lead by the head concierge, Joe.  On the most recent trip, my wife and 7 year old daughter had to make the visit without me, but ended up having a smooth trip thanks to the head concierge Joe, who answered all their questions and gave valuable advice to enjoy their day along with arranging some details on their behalf.  It was really nice that my family were able to have such a smooth trip around London as a result and they also enjoyed returning to the hotel each evening to relax in the lounge.  We're looking forward to returning to the Hyatt London Churchill as we have enjoyed many prior stays.  I especially want to personally thank Joe for all that he did for my family on their most recent visit!",5,2022,06,13
150,Amazing location.,A wonderful hotel on Portman square walking distance to all that is great in London.  Truly enjoyed. The   service was great and the room modern and very comfortable   A definite favourite to return to next time we visit London.  ,5,2022,06,12
150,Great hotel,"Amazing hotel perfect location 
A little very expensive though in summers 
Felt like staying ina 5 star hotel minus swimming pool facility. 
Breakfast was pretty average
They got bidet in thei washrooms which is a big plus.",4,2022,06,12
150,Worth a visit,"Stay at hyatt regency was great..staff is very cooperative..front of desk representative was highly responsible and took care of all our needs..Cakes and cookies were awesome...overall ,a perfect place to stay...",5,2022,06,10
150,City center hotel with excellent upgrade for globalist,Location right in city center. Reception are kind and helpful. Globalist get good upgrade to suite in my case executive suite which is very kind. Breakfast options were good. Restaurant offer good food too. Stayed here during Covid period and hopefully will try again,5,2022,06,05
150,Enjoyable place to stay in London,"A very well located hotel nearby the city center and Paddington station. Friendly staff and clean rooms make your day. A quality breakfast in the morning downstairs starts your engine nicely. If you need a taxi, you just grab one in front of the hotel. Very convinient.",5,2022,06,04
150,Spoil yourself!,"Absolute treat. Beautiful hotel, very helpful and courteous staff.

Room service breakfast was fabulous. Room.restocked with complimentary tea, coffee and water every day. Definitely recommend room overlooking Portman Square as well.",5,2022,06,03
150,Excellent,"Excellent hotel which is very centrally located. The service was friendly and very helpful at reception, Conceirge & house keeping. The downer was parking which was close by but not very safe. Overall a must stay hotel.",5,2022,06,02
150,Not worth the hype,"Stayed at the Churchill for three nights on a quick trip to London for a friend's birthday. If you're anything like me, you prefer your reviews quick and easy, so let me get to the point: 

Pros: 

- The Churchill Bar - absolutely phenomenal! Great atmosphere and vibes. Drinks and food delicious and staff incredibly professional and fun. 

- Location - you really can't beat it. Its walking distance to some incredible sites and easily accessible. 

- Room was spacious - there were three of us in the room, each sleeping on twin bed. There was plenty of space for our beds, luggage, and lounging around. I was expected an NYC style room (very small), so this exceeded my expectations. 

- History - Great exhibits throughout detailing some of Winston Churchill's life along with the life of the Royals. Nice touch. 

Cons: 

- Incredibly rude customer service - If you stay here, avoid the concierge desk at all costs. They were rude, unprofessional, and just utterly useless. If you need help with anything, you might as well just ""google"". 

- Poor check-in process - As many Americans traveling to London, we arrived in the morning. We weren't surprised when our rooms weren't ready, but we asked them to call us when they were. We arrived back at the hotel 20 minutes prior to check-in. Despite them handing out keys to other guests, we were told our room was not ready. That didn't sit well. 45 minutes later our room was available. They insisted the bellmen bring up our luggage, which was a nice touch but the bags didn't arrive for another 45 minutes after that. I know this sounds petty, but having flown all night then spend a full day in London on no sleep, it would have been nice to get into our room and shower/ freshen up immediately. Not wait even longer for our basic necessities. 

Overall - not worth the hype and really not sure how they received five stars. I've stayed at a Hyatt at the DFW airport with better customer service.",2,2022,06,01
150,Fantastic Hotel,"One of the best Hyatt hotels we have stayed at fantastic comfortable large king beds in very nicely appointed bedrooms, bathrooms were super. Very helpful and  friendly staff. Great location ideal for shopping. ",5,2022,05,31
150,Not a great experience,"We arrived early at 8am assuming we would not be able to check in yet but dropped our bags off. We returned at 2pm hoping the room would be ready, but alas it wasn't. So we thought waiting another hour to the posted 3pm check in time would be fine and we could still make our reservation for a tea we had pre-booked. We waited in the lounge. 3pm came and went. We went to check again at 3:30. Still not ready. Then finally after checking twice the room was finally ready at 4:30 an hour and a half past check in and we missed our tea that we had to put a deposit down for. The front desk was unapologetic and slightly rude.
After getting to the room someone knocked and opened the door at the same time without waiting for an answer. Could have been a very embarrassing intrusion had someone been changing. A women came in, saw us and then just said ""sorry, sorry, sorry"" and left...... Then ten minutes later another knock. Someone coming in to ask if there were any socks left on the table, now we are generally confused to what is going on and irritated by the disturbance.
 For breakfast were seated on a tiny table in a hallway next to a utility closet where servers kept coming in to get chairs and the door slamming behind them. The food was inedible. I ordered tea and was forgotten about. Way too many people being served at once, half of the dishes were empty. The whole thing seemed crowded and unsanitary. 
Reason for three stars instead of one is because this is obviously a lovely property, unfortunately we did not have a great experience.",3,2022,05,31
150,Not Quite Sure,"First all, do NOT book this on an airline website as a package, you will be treated pretty shabbily by front desk. Messaged hotel several days in advance, which was acknowledged, that we’d arrive early morning, and if room available it would be appreciated, especially as staying over a week. Nope, arrived told to check back at 3pm, as room ‘allocated’ to us still occupied, so set off on our day, and had to put up a fuss at 4pm for a room which ended up being a different room anyway with no “sorry” or “thank you for your patience” or anything else. Hall carpeting off elevators looks pretty dirty, seems as if it would benefit from a good shampooing, makes you want to run out of hotel. Room housekeeping very good. Afternoon hostess at restaurant was  lovely and apologized that the actual bar, didn’t open until later.  Concierge gentlemen also lovely and helpful as are the doormen. Front desk gets a thumbs downs from me. Long family history staying here years ago, not sure I’d want to book again though. Beds are comfortable but pillows are like rocks.",3,2022,05,31
150,An agreable stay,"The suite was very agreable and convenient. The extra-bed required was forgotten but was settled very fast after demand. The breakfast was fantastic and the service friendly. I recommend this hotel which is near Hyde Park. If you come with your car, you can park outside the congestion zone and you can drive more easily.",5,2022,05,30
150,great location!,"The hotel is located in an area that is easily walkable to plenty of shopping and restaurants. The breakfast buffet was pricey and just alright.My husband also said the coffee was not very good. Overall, it is avery nice hotel and wewould stay there again.  ",5,2022,05,30
150,Top notch staff,This hotel has a great location and staff that goes above and beyond to be helpful. We stayed here during the month of May to attend the Chelsea Flower Show. Proximity to Marble Arch Underground station and excellent local shopping and dining made Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill a great choice for our vacation. ,5,2022,05,30
150,Wonderful,"Outstanding hotel . Despite being quite a large , busy hotel, service is personalised and outstanding. 
Rooms spacious. Linen wonderful. Milton brown amenities great. Breakfast and restaurants superb.
Location great. Best to get on the club floor",5,2022,05,29
150,Another amazing stay,Another  truly wonderful weekend at this hotel. From arriving to departing everything was perfect. We would like to say a big thank you to Waris for making our stay very special. The breakfast was great and although the staff were extremely busy they could not do enough for you. The lattes at breakfast are wonderful. The club lounge was great although I do think there needs to be a bit more of a staff presence in there. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of booking. All the staff are amazing and what make this hotel special. Thank you x,5,2022,05,29
150,Very busy hotel but excellent location,"The staff are very accommodating and really try to assist where possible.  The breakfast is a bit of a nightmare but staff are exceptionally friendly however coffees are often late and cold, buffet isnt really worth it except for the fruit and cold meat.  A la Carte great but when its busy your food is delivered cold.",4,2022,05,28
150,"Great location, but not up to previous standards.","We stayed at the Churchill for six nights in May. We have been staying at the Churchill since the early 90s when it was an Intercontinental, so we knew what to expect as far as service and amenities were concerned, and we are World of Hyatt members. The hotel is expensive, but we have always thought that the quality of the place, and the location, merited the money we spent.
Our room, on the Club Floor, was a good size, by London standards, but was very tired. Heated toilet seat, stand-up shower? not in our room. And the carpet was stained. The bed was comfortable and, once we got the hang of the heating system, the room was, also.
As mentioned by many, the breakfast buffet was generous, and I was surprised by the way the staff was able to handle the crush every morning. We had a family reunion lunch in the Montagu Kitchen that was delicious and with good service. In most cases, the hotel staff were efficient, pleasant and polite.

Two incidents impacted our stay. On the second evening, as we were getting changed to go out, someone tried to force open the door to our room, and actually ripped the security chain from the door. We didn't see who it was as by the time we managed to open the door, the corridor was empty (we were near the service room and also the club lounge). The security staff sent a very nice young man to repair the door (I didn't get his name, but I know he is Polish), however, it was rather unsettling to have this happen. The hotel didn't offer anything in compensation for this event.
The second incident happened at check-out. The hotel has a ""stay six nights and get the sixth night free"" program. As we had stayed six nights, we expected to receive this (esp. as we are World of Hyatt, etc). However, the person behind the desk said that as we had not specifically asked for that program we didn't qualify.  Given everything, we thought this very unfair. We were told to take the issue up with the management. We were leaving for Heathrow and our Express Covid tests, we didn't have the time or inclination for this. So, our departure was on a rather sour note.

In all, we were disappointed. This was not quite the Churchill experience we expected.",3,2022,05,27
150,Excellent Hotel,"One of the best hotels in London and I will repeat my experience many times and I want a special discount for the room rate if possible in the future Also, I will encourage friends to stay in this hotel. The hotel is also characterized by being classic and tidy, as well as welcoming and conveying information properly from the reception staff.",5,2022,05,26
150,Another great stay at Hyatt Churchill London,This is my 4th stay at this wonderful place ! The Staff are excellent as usually and the rooms are very comfortable and clean. One of the main attractions is that the hotel sits in one of the best locations in London. It takes only 5 mins to walk to Oxford Street and about 35 mins to Leicester square. ,5,2022,05,25
150,"Good location, but the room was tired. and and had dreadful Aircon, despite raising this with reception nothing!"," A special occasion we chose this hotel for it's location. But the rooms are tired, the Aircon in ours was too noisy and it was too warm to not have on, we did not sleep,the only high was breakfast as the staff were terrific.",3,2022,05,23
150,Wonderful stylish hotel convenient to everything,"Outstanding hotel in a very convenient location to several Underground stops, Paddington Station just 2-3 stops away if you take the Paddington Wxpress from Heathrow, streets with numerous restaurants, and a wonderful and attentive staff.

The rooms are large by London standards and our room had an electronic bidet toilet with heated seat and a large standing shower, a refrigerator, ironing board and iron, blow dryer, plenty of space for storage etc.  

The restaurant seems lovely but we did not eat there as hotel prices were fairly steep.  

Recommend eating at Grazing Goat a block away for great English pub  food including the Sunday Roast.  Another good pub a block away is The Three Tuns which has a good after work pub beer scene.

For great Indian nearby try Chourangi, especially the Tandoor Lamb Chops.

Front door servicemen are excellent.",4,2022,05,22
150,The Hyatt Churchill was perfect!,"The Hyatt Churchill was a perfect stay in the perfect location and provided an memorable experience for my family and I during our week long holiday. The entire staff was welcoming and accommodating. From check in to checkout, our stay was amazing and we look forward to returning.",5,2022,05,18
150,Expert service,A corporate vacation for a large group and the handles it wonderfully. Concierge was beyond helpful to make sure we felt comfortable and welcome in the hotel and the city. Breakfast was a perfect variety of choices and excellent service as well.,5,2022,05,17
150,Excellent and classy hotel,"All staff were professional, friendly and very helpful.  The Regency Club was outstanding.  The service staff were quick to open a door or hail a taxi.  The restaurant staff were friendly and prompt, even when busy. ",5,2022,05,14
150,Great location and lovely hotel,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill hotel in May 2022. Firstly, the hotel is very spacious with a large lobby and lot's of staff at hand to help with luggage, getting a taxi etc. Secondly, check-in was easy (we are Hyatt members so everything was already registred) and friendly. The room was clean and we had a nice view over a rood terrace. The bathroom was quite small but we didn't see it as a problem. 
We had the Buffet breakfast which was great with lot's of options. The hotel seems to cater for guests from the Middle East since there were foul madames and tabbouleh on the buffet, but also more European dishes. The only minus was that waffles and some egg dishes were extra. 
We didin't eat in the restaurant at night but we tried to get a drink in the bar and were turned away because of our daughter. The claimed children weren't allowed in the bar because of smoke (but smoking was only allowed on the terrace so that made no sense!). Very strange for a 5 star hotel.

But the best thing about the hotel was the location!! Right behind Selfridges meant that we could walk everywhere without a taxi and it was still a quiet street. And the staff were very friendly. 
",5,2022,05,10
150,"Great location, nice hotel.","It’s a great location, right next to Baker Street and Oxford St a short walk to Marble Arch. The hotel is nice, rooms are clean and some have updated bathrooms with walk-in showers. Staff are friendly but not overly attentive. Breakfast food is good, it’s busy though at peak times and getting tea/coffee can be hit and miss. ",4,2022,05,08
150,Fire evacuation of the hotel,"Good location, welcoming staff.
We've been asked to evacuate the hotel early morning because of possible fire.
stayed outside in a cold environment, the hotel can plan it a better way to keep guests in the receptions of nearby hotel rather than outdoor in a cold environment. especially there are a lot of kids. ",4,2022,05,08
150,Wonderful Experience at the HY Regency London - The Churchill,"Outstanding venue, staff, and amenities!!!  Everything was the best of the best at this hotel.  Great location as well.  My team and I especially appreciated the staff who were all amazing.  I would highly recommend staying here while in London! ",5,2022,05,06
150,Tired hotel,"The staff are friendly, but the hotel is in desperate need of a remodel and the rooms were small (though not terribly small for London). Maybe my standards for a regency are too high? 

We left and went to the JW which we preferred, but until this hotel gets remodeled, the better option is probably the Scotland Yard Unbound Collection. 

Globalist member; not upgraded. Don't think it would have made a huge difference if they had though. We were happy to switch to the JW, and happier still at the Scotland Yard.",2,2022,05,03
150,Hyatt Excellency,"Very good service and always very clean and nice rooms.Excellent place for conducting business in London. I havek not stayed here for 2 years due to the pandemic, but nothing has changed. Is the same good hotel.
",5,2022,04,30
150,"Wonderful hotel, exceptional service","Excellent service across the board.  When I checked in, the front desk arranged to have a coffee maker in my room, as there were no suite upgrades available.  The staff in the restaurant was very friendly - even went out of their way to ask the kitchen to make us an omelette after the buffet had closed.  The room service staff and housekeeping were all extremely friendly. I get the feeling that everyone working there simply loves their job.  Truly exceptional management.  Well done.",5,2022,04,30
150,"Fantastic 7 night stay at the Hyatt Regency, The Churchill","We had a wonderful 7 night stay at the Hyatt Regency, The Churchill. Every staff member were particularly kind & helpful; special call out to the doormen (great conversations as we waited for taxis) & to the kind cleaning lady who cleaned our rooms on the 4th floor. The location of the hotel was just perfect for sightseeing; lots of taxis, very close to the Marble Arch & Bond Street tube stations & to great shopping on Oxford St. We had a family suite which was convenient given that we were traveling with 3 kids. The rooms & bathrooms were a bit small, but, super clean & well-equipped. We had a great stay here & this hotel will be on the top of our list when we return to London.",5,2022,04,25
150,Excellent,"Very clean room, perfect breakfast with anything you could think of.. check in staff very pleasant, concierge booked for us tickets for theatre
Bed was so big and soft
We enjoyed our stay.
Will be back for sure",5,2022,04,25
150,Stay for a hospital appointment,"We stayed here as my partner had to have a back operation at harley street 
The staff were amazing especially behind check in  and 
remembering our names and
 that my partner had had an operation and making the effort to ask if both he and i were ok and if there was anything they could help us with 
The resteraunt staff were also really excellent making sure we were seated promptly and ensuring he didnt have to stand to long to wait for a table
We felt really looked after and cared about
I cannot thank them enough and will certainly return here again 10 star hotel in my opinion",5,2022,04,24
150,bring back the Exec Lounge for breakfast.,my wife and i courted in this hotel over 20 years ago. we have lolved this place for decades. Some old soldiers have retired like Solie from the Exec Lounge reception a wonderful man who would sort put any issue for guests. The gentleman with the very deep voice in the kitchen is also gone. Naturally these things have to happen but on top of the inconvenience created by new process is makes a significant difference.

150,"Stylish Renovation, Huge Rooms","Was really surprised at the style and size of the rooms here, Hyatt have done a great job revamping this property. great location for shopping on Oxford Street. Really large rooms which is a rare find in London.",5,2022,04,23
150,Gone to the dogs,Filthy rooms. Poor service. Zero accountability. Zero training. Suite falling apart with huge stains on the sofa and carpet that looked like candle wax or uncleaned sex residue. Paint was peeling in the bathroom. Bathroom amenities were only changed upon request. Filthy windows which were cleaned on request. Polite housekeeping staff despite incompetence but exceptionally impolite staff otherwise.,1,2022,04,21
150,Absolutely wonderful Hotel!!! Our second home in London!,"An absolutely wonderful hotel - meanwhile really our second home in London! The location (near to Selfridges) is perfect and the amazing staff makes every single stay great! Special thanks to the concierge team and especially to Ricardo, who always makes the impossible possible…to the reception team, thank you very much Andrea for helping to create my lovely birthday room…and a very warm Thank You to Jose and also to the wonderful, lovely and great breakfast team…the lovely ladies are making every day special from the beginning with their kindness…we will for sure come back! Thank you all for making our time in London every time so lovely!!!",5,2022,04,20
150,An oasis in a hectic city,"I am so grateful to have chosen this hotel. It is on a quiet street surrounded by restaurants, close to Marble Arch underground and all the fun shops and restaurants of Marylbone area as well as Hyde Park and The Italian Gardens . Do not under any circumstance get a room near the service elevator that makes a huge racket all day and night. Outside of that one issue the hotel is lovely, clean, high end linens, comfortable bed and a refrigerator in room. There is a doorman but the 2 times I needed a taxi I could not find one. Taxis are lined up right outside the door and Marble Arch underground is a few blocks away. ",5,2022,04,16
150,Welcoming hotel! Comfortable stay,"I had a wonderful ten day stay at the hotel visiting my daughter who lives close by. The doormen, Abdel and the other gentleman from Cayman Islands- both genuine and just lovely. They are both major assets as front line to the hotel. Housekeeping kept my room perfectly spotless and organized. Very consistent and accommodated my changing schedule for housekeeping. Room service was above par, excellent food. The only thing I would say is that chips and vegetables should be covered as they were slightly cold. Otherwise excellent. 
Breakfast is consistent and quite good. They could use a few more servers to take hot drink orders and offer poached eggs. The bed was very comfortable also and nice linens. I would like to see larger bathrobes. Not all women are super small. Wasn’t even an average size. Overall I loved the hotel. I would happily return.",4,2022,04,16
150,"Terrible experience - first room wrong, second room still dirty from last guest, third time lucky","Probably the worst check in experience we have ever had at a hotel. We booked a Queen double room but were given a room with twin beds. We then had to wait to be moved to another room. The next room we were given had not been cleaned from the previous occupants, see photos - this is unacceptable. We then had to go back down to Reception and wait for another room. Nearly an hour after checking in we were finally given an acceptable room. We were offered complimentary access to the lounge which we declined - we just wanted the room we had booked and for it to be clean, not much to ask for. I have since found out two of my colleagues were also checked into dirty rooms. Such a poor experience for £429 a night room at a supposedly 5* hotel.",2,2022,04,14
150,Great hotel in excellent location with easy access to Oxford Street,"Still retains the spledour of traditional England.  Warm reception, easy access to the West End shopping comfortable rooms with quality beds and friendly staff.  Will visit the Churchill again in the future",5,2022,04,05
150,"Bizarre ""5 star""","This is a strange, strange hotel.  The staff are awkward, say all kinds of weird things and seem ill at ease.  It used to be a charming haven (including under the Intercontinental chain in the 1990s).  It's now very grey, and this sombre tone (walls & carpets), is reflected by its inept staff.  When checking out, a smirking Receptionist informed us that a ""service charge"" had been applied to our bill, and when questioned about it said it was optional.  Is this Hyatt policy?  I don't think I'll bother with this place again.  There are much nicer places in London for this price.  Shame, as it's a brilliant location.    ",2,2022,04,04
150,Reliable Comfort,"Enjoyable weekend stay at this traditional but stylish hotel in a very convenient area. Really comfortable beds with wonderfully luxurious bedding and pillows. Only disappointment was poor food menus with very little choice. We arrived back from a show and because it was 3 mins after 11pm we had only three choices for a main course from the room service menu. We asked if we could at least order a club sandwich but were refused, extremely disappointed at service and choice for a 5 * hotel. Overall would stay again due to comfort and location.",4,2022,03,31
150,"Ultra noisy, lost its quality","Hi
I am currently staying at Hyatt the Churchill in London. I am very disappointed in the quality and. Service. Since I arrived there was almost every night loud music coming to my room (5th floor) from the lobby.
I complained several times but it seems that no one really cares! I was just told the music will stop at midnight and it never really did.
My advice is to stay away from this hotel unless you want to lack sleep.
Best regards",1,2022,03,24
150,Good One Week Stay,God stay overall. Rooms are large by London standards but expensive. Hotel starting to feel slightly dated and could use a refresh. Heated toilet seats were nice to have. 5% tip to front desk unusual. Regency lounge food needs more variety.,4,2022,03,21
150,Good Experience at Hyatt Regency London - Churchill,"Second time stay at the hotel which is well furnished & the choice of food & drinks is excellent.

150,5 Star that never fails to deliver,"After many, many visits, The Churchill never fails to impress.

Breakfast great buffet and chefs, table service too. Room service quick and efficient bthough again unfortunately seem tired and not customer oriented, pity.",4,2022,03,14
150,Beautiful hotel but staff need a retrain!,"Room was wonderful, bed was so comfortable I could have stayed in it for the weekend, but, when I needed help to arrange a restaurant the concierge on desk was simply not interested....I had to pretty much force him to assist me or give me a number so I could do it myself, and he really didn't want to do it. Likewise the head guy in Churchills Bar must have had a bad night. Rude and unhelpful. We all have bad days but when working in hospitality, you cant take it to work with you. This was a special birthday weekend for my husband and I was truly disappointed with the abrasive manner shown by some of the staff - We've stayed in the best hotels in the world and we'll probably give it another go, but I do hope the management take these reviews on board before we visit again!",4,2022,03,13
150,Really elegant Hotel,"Simply nice place to stay during your visit in London

150,PERFECTION! No room for improvement,Lately I find myself choosing Hyatt more often because they have managed every detail so very well. This property exceeded my expectations on every level. I am surprised at the consistency of absolute perfection. I didn't think such dedicated and well-trained staff existed at this level.  ,5,2022,02,27
150,Very comfortable stay. Room 836 with view of Portman Square.,"What’s to like about this hotel:  great neighborhood for sightseeing and shopping. Oxford Street shops (Marble Arch end); three blocks from Marbke Arch Tube stop; great comfortable bed; very quiet with double windows; my room had a view of Portman Square including a tennis court; on the club floor with access to one of the lounges fir coffee and snacks; compact and well equipped bathroom including a rapid fill bathtub: never had to wait for an elevator and elevators are controlled access-must use room key to go upstairs; concierge directed me to a good Covid Fit to Fly testing facility that a a few blocks away.

What could be better:  no newspapers available in the lounge or breakfast restaurant-this indicates the guests must mostly leisure travelers; the food at the £33 breakfast buffet was lukewarm vs hot-if you want hot food, must order a la carte; no black pudding with the English breakast; and hotel adds an automatic £17 a day “service charge” that is murky.  Not sure if the staff actually receives any of these funds.   Restaurant tacks on an automatic 10 percent service charge.",4,2022,02,24
150,Amazing Food Benefit,"The Churchill not only has my favorite bar in town, but if you upgrade to the club level (by straight purchase or point combo) you now get a fabulous breakfast in the downstairs restaurant.  The breakfast has everything you could want, instead of an abbreviated club breakfast.  The icing on the cake was the vastly improved canape offering for happy hour.  The selections were varied and tasted fantastic. Way to go Churchill!!! ",5,2022,02,22
150,Lovely London stay,"Booked this as special occasion treat. We live in London but it’s nice to have a stay every now and then. 

Excellent located with incredibly lovely and helpful staff.

We enjoyed cocktails at The Churchill bar which had a great atmosphere and incredibly friendly server (when we walked past later that evening it looked very busy and a great vibe) 

The bottomless brunch was so delicious and just so much food! We did have to prompt for refills a couple of times (not drinking particularly quick) but not a big issue. The 6pm check out is a really nice touch so you can relax after a big meal. 

The gym is compact but everything you need for a quick workout. 

Overall 9/10 

",5,2022,02,22
150,A little updating needed maybe but very special,A huge thank you to every single member of the team who made us feel special from the moment we walked in. If you want to know what it's like being part of World Of Hyatt look no further than The Churchill. They work so hard and the centre of their day is the guest.  Maybe some small bits could do with a hard refurb but the soft refurbs looked good and made it feel every bit luxurious. Great stay and look forward to being back ,4,2022,02,22

150,"Hyatt Regency ,The Churchill Hotel ","I have stayed here several times before due to location a few steps away from Oxford street the rooms are a bit small out of all my visit never had a room with a decent view,this visit might be the last time I choose Churchill due to the recent request I ask for which is late check out just a few couple of hours and they asks for 150 GBP which is insane I could get a full night at a nearby Hilton hotel for less these small requests by a returning customer would make me not choosing this hotel for any visit to London.",3,2022,02,20
150,"Good choice, especially at this price point.","Excellent value, lovely hotel. The location was quiet, away from the center, only a few blocks to the underground. Best value for a suite in London. No room service, but that's a temporary interruption due to COVID. Early evening canapés in the 8th floor lounge compensated nicely.",4,2022,02,18
150,"Amazing staff, great location and excellent Bar",Location is great and staff extremely helpful and friendly. Walking distance to Mayfair and Marylebone is short. Transport you order from Heathrow is too expensive - GBP 160 - and should be reduced if you spend GBP 500 per night. ,5,2022,02,08
150,Great hotel,"Loved the retro themed bar- good ambience and great service and even though bar menu seemed pricey it turned out good value
Rooms adequate- although personally found a heated toilet seat rather odd!
Breakfast fab, great service and good selection
Not sure though compared to others in London why this gets a 5star",5,2022,02,06
150,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at the Churchill last month while visiting family. The service was excellent and it has a great location (I was able to walk to Madame Tussaud’s from the hotel as well as our COVID test location without issue). The staff were thoroughly professional and we had a clean, spacious room. My only complaint is that the breakfast was lacking in options.",5,2022,01,24

150,Wonderful stay,I travelled with my family and  booked a family room since we had kids with us. We arrived in the morning and were welcomed by their staff. They did their best to give us our rooms earlier. One of their staff in particular Snejana worked especially hard to get us our room making us feel so welcomed. As well as the room services and cleaning staff were both really good. In the end we had a wonderful stay and would definitely go again.,5,2022,01,13
150,Special occasion!,"From check-in to departure, my wife and I were made to feel very special. We received complimentary breakfast as a returning guest and staff throughout the hotel were brilliant. Our room was excellent and very clean on arrival and the housekeeping staff were very helpful and supportive throughout our stay despite these difficult times. ",5,2022,01,11
150,Superb stay at the Churchill and dinner in its restaurant,"Just returned from a 2 night London break and this was our second visit to the Churchill. This Hyatt property has an excellent location just off Oxford Street but in a quiet mostly residential neighbourhood. Check in was very efficient and all the staff we came across were very professional and friendly. Our room was very comfortable and had all the amenities you would expect in a Hyatt Regency hotel. In fact our room had recently been refurbished and in the bathroom was one of those curious Japanese style toilets with some rather interesting cleaning features.My wife was really impressed and now wants one for our house. In common with most hotels the staff didn't service the room in these Covid times but left a supply of towels etc on a trolley in the corridor which was a useful touch. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant,the Montagu Kitchen and the food was superb. We were well looked after by Angela who deserves a mention for her impeccable service. We've stayed in quite a few hotels in London over the years but this one is  our favourite and next time we're visiting London we'll just book a room here.",5,2022,01,10
150,Beyond expectations,"My stay was on New year's eve.  The hotel was quiet over the New year holiday.  Comparing to the othe Hyatt Regency in Birmingham, the Churchill provided much much better services to the guests.  The staff are warm and professional here.  The choices of buffet breakfast is also more than those in Birmingham one.  One drawback for the stay in Churchill is that the pillows are not firm enough.  All of my family members felt neck pain after the sleep.   The other drawback is lack of choice of TV channels.  The signal for some channels such as Sky Sports are always breaking.",5,2022,01,05
150,A good stay,"Hyatt, the most consistently reliable of the larger hotel chains in my view.
This hotel was as expected, and I have stayed before. Clean and comfortable. Great location for Marylebone and West End shopping.  

The Churchill Bar is a good bar, pleasant staff and a good collection of cocktails. The restaurant had a great menu, service was very slow that night (for us and everyone else), not sure why, it was the regular menu. 

Hyatt status and various profile notes not recognised but it was dealt with in a good way and we left happy with the resolution.

I’d recommend a room with a view of Portman Square. The rooms themselves are comfortable and clean.

I’d recommend this hotel to anyone
seeking a base in the west end of London.",4,2021,12,30

150,Disappointing,"We have visited for brunch previously and had the most amazing time, great buffet , unlimited champagne and a great atmosphere, and whilst I appreciate COVID has had a massive impact within hospitality and how restaurants operate, today was extremely disappointing . 
The service was mediocre as was the food (which was also limited) and after spending over £600  (as we were celebrating) it was really disappointing to be told we could only have a drink in the terrace bar if we spent another £30 per  person.- baring in mind  what we had just spent I found this ridiculous. Personally I was disgusted, as a table of 4 we just wanted to have a final drink before we left and to finish the day.
I now wouldn’t recommend this hotel/restaurant/venue to anyone as it has disappointed On so many levels and your custom is obviously not valued.",1,2021,11,28

Now things are normalising with COVID, I was very disappointed with the lukewarm and limited breakfast buffet. Canape hour at the club lounge was dire, little effort was made beyond ham and cheese slices, hummus and crudités, not worth the upgrade.
Be prepared for noisy weddings all day during the weekend in the reception area.",3,2021,11,16
150,Excellent,"Excellent quality, food, service, location, amenities, cleanliness and overall experience. Highly recommended. The club on the 8th floor is worth the additional cost of staying for a short time. The cooked breakfast was excellent. ",5,2021,11,16

Finally found a room with no connecting door. On checkout was told the other guess thought it was the bathroom. A bathroom in the middle of the room and tried for 3 minutes to open the door.

unfortunately, I had an issue which is not related to the hotel but rather than to a single staff misleading which I did not appreciate but decided to let it go. 

Nevertheless, the hotel is excellent and especially if you meet Cristina Turcanu which is the best I have seen in this hotel. she is a hard worker and always seeks customer satisfaction by going beyond her way to meet your requests. I wish her all the best in career development in the hotel. I hope that she is going to be appreciated against her hard work as she is a great asset within the entire staff I dealt with during my stay there.",4,2021,10,25
150,Friendly and quiet - good breakfast,"The room was very comfortable - definitely an upper end property worthy of the Hyatt Brand and Churchill name.  The breakfast was very good - they managed a hot breakfast buffet that was a combination of self-serve and ""handed-over"" plates which worked fine in the time of the pandemic.  We appreciated the abundant outlets including some North American ones in the room.  Comfortable bed.

The room wasn't serviced daily but this was perfect for us. We could get towels, toiletries, coffee supplies when ever we needed them.

",5,2021,10,10
150,Major slipping in quality,"I have stayed at the Churchill many times, but the quality of the hotel has worsened since recent renovations. For example - the key rarely works and you’ll need to body slam the door to open it; bed linens were replaced once during 8-day stay; toiletries were not replaced consistently and we had to ask for lotion; the shower does not drain and the glass shower door leaks; flickering desk light; the room quality is worse since renovations (double beds replaced with twin beds); we had to call for cleaning or room was not serviced (returned to uncleaned room in late afternoon on two occasions when we didn’t call for cleaning).

150,Great stay!,"This hotel is well located in the center of London, has great customer service, and excellent amenities (although I never made it to the gym). There was a special when we stayed - third night free - which helped make the stay very reasonable. I would highly recommend it. 
",5,2021,09,25
150,London Hotel on Business,"I found the location to be excellent for my needs, check-in was swift and the staff very attentive.  Staff respected social distancing and all wore masks which was very assuring, could recommend the hotel highly enough.",5,2021,09,24
150,Amazing,My husband surprised me with a 1 night stay at this hotel for our wedding anniversary. The room was fabulous and overlooked a pretty square. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was wonderful. We had a wonderful stay and the hotel is perfect for sightseeing and shopping in Central London. As it was still very covid restricted when we visited the hotel was quiet and sadly we were unable to book the bar at the hotel but i would love to visit again.,5,2021,09,22
150,Overall wonderful stay,Great location and amenities - especially if you’re coming from the US. Had USB ports and a two prong for my laptop which I desperately needed. Service was amazing. Would stay here again. Lots of great restaurants nearby.,5,2021,09,19
150,Horrible experience,Had no hot water in the shower for full 2 days. I called housekeeping for a coffee it never arrived. I complained about my shower but nothing was done regarding it. The rooms are very old and not worth the price. The hari hotel is a much better option if you are looking for a hotel to stay in.,2,2021,09,19
150,"Incredible stay, will be back!","I have to say the staff here are truly exception and really make your stay go from nice to incredible. 

They are so accommodating. Anything you need, they’re there. If you stay longer than one night they remember you and preempt what you need. Always looking to improve the experience. 

The options for coffee at breakfast is such a nice little treat and also having a takeaway breakfast option is brilliant for anyone travelling onward. Good options for me were perfect. 

Conference & banqueting staff are the best I have ever experienced. They could not do enough for us. 

All the staff still wear face masks which I very much appreciated given they are still the law where I live. 

I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London and very much hope to be back again soon. ",5,2021,09,17
150,The Churchill - Great Experience,Enjoyed staying at The Churchill which is a world-class hotel with all modern amenities & very well located in the city of London. Just 2 minutes walk from the Oxford Street & the famous Hyde Park is 5 minutes by foot.,5,2021,09,16
150,Another great Hyatt,As excellent as you would expect. Incredibly clean. Great service and classic Hyatt Regency rooms in a central location. Hot and cold breakfast buffet options and a la carte. Good Globalist recognition. Unfortunately the Club is closed due to COVID but there are hors d'oevres offered in the evening and meeting space can be opened up on request for Globlists. ,5,2021,09,15
150,Absolutely Fabulous,"We loved the hotel the minute we walked in. The staff were lovely, everywhere was spotless and the food was fabulous. The room was very well equipped with the most comfortable bed ever! We ate in the Churchill Bar and that was superb. Breakfast was excellent. We had the most amazing time and were blown away by the card and cake left in our room to celebrate our anniversary. Thank you so much for a truly wonderful experience.",5,2021,09,13
150,Excellent stay at the Churchill Hotel,"Very well run hotel having excellent food and service in its restaurants. Excellent location in a relatively quiet part of London, yet only a short walk from Oxford Street, Marble Arch underground station and Hyde Park",5,2021,09,10
150,Excellent Hotel and Great location,I am also a Titanium Member with Bonvoy besides a Globalist with Hyatt.  This has been my first trip to the UK since December 2019.  The Churchill is officially my new favorite hotel in London.  Thank you!,5,2021,09,09
150,Faultless stay at The Churchill.,"A beautifully designed hotel, in a fantastic central location. Every member of staff was welcoming and helpful. Delicious breakfast with lots of freshly prepared pastries. We look forward to returning! ",5,2021,09,06
150,Excellent Hotel,"Really excellent hotel in a great location just off Bond street a javelin throw from Selfridges. No faults at all in our stay, friendly, efficient staff. Din't dine there so don't know about the food but everything else top notch. Would heartily recommend.",5,2021,08,31
150,Excellent city centre hotel,This hotel is typical of the Hyatt range and the staff do their best to extend good hospitality to their guests.  I have stayed here many times and hope to continue using it in the future. Great location for downtown and ease of getting on to the A40 for travelling. Very smart bar called Churchills for night cap.,5,2021,08,22
150,My families first experience staying at this 5 star London Hotel,"My family have just had a vacation at the Hyatt Regency London - Churchill, it was our first stay at a 5 Star London hotel, the stay was fantastic and I thoroughly recommend this for a city vacation, the front of house team made us very welcome, the guests of many nationalities were very friendly, this hotel is perfectly located, a 3 minute walk to Oxford Street, great shopping and tourism, also great hotel for fine dining.

The Jackson family",5,2021,08,20
150,Good location with decaying condition.,Hotel is located at the best possible location in an old building. Staff is great but hotel needs improvements in all departments from banging lift doors to whistling alarm system speakers. Bar and the restaurant are great. ,3,2021,08,18
150,Family fun,"Great location for family days out 
Staff welcoming and service excellent 
Our grandchildren thoroughly enjoyed their visit and that made our enjoyment so much more
Family rooms perfect for our daughter and her 2 girls",5,2021,08,15
150,Lovely family experience,Warm and welcoming and extremely relaxing after all the Covid chaos it was a much needed family experience.  The hotel is superbly located for a trip to the west end and shopping and the staff are very attentive.,5,2021,08,14
150,Excellent service,"The first thing you notice when staying here is that the hotel's namesake, Sir Winston Churchill, pops up everywhere - pictures, statues, etc. The lobby area leading to the lounge is very nice, as is the terrace bar (highly recommended in the evenings). 

Our room was a good size with a very large comfy bed, but the bathroom on the other hand was quite small. 

There is a small gym on-site with some free weights and a  few Life Fitness machines, which was very quiet when we visited. 

Breakfast was an interesting affair due to COVID but ultimately quite good. 

The main factor which helped enhance our stay was the excellent level of service we received...especially at reception.",4,2021,08,12
150,Excellent stay,"We had a lovely stay at the hotel - check-in was efficient and friendly. Room was lovely - very comfortable bed/pillows etc. 
Breakfast was reasonably priced and our orders were recalled after the first day. Excellent area and close to everything you’d need. ",5,2021,08,11
150,Lovely stay for a 2 night family city break,"Stayed two nights at the Hyatt in Portman Square having booked a family suite (essentially two interconnecting rooms) for our family of five. We had a wonderful stay. We were able to check in early on our arrival day (1000hrs) and spontaneously offered a late check out on our departure day (1500hrs) so were able to maximise our time in the hotel. The 4th floor rooms themselves were spacious and immaculate with lovely views of Portman Square Gardens and with comfortable beds and well equipped bathrooms with showers. The air-conditioning functioned very well (which was a relief as we had stayed in a hotel in the Midlands a few days earlier where it was totally ineffective) and this made for a great night’s sleep. 
We didn’t eat in the hotel as the menu was inevitably quite pricy, but given the location we had no problems finding some lovely local coffee shops for breakfast and restaurants for dinner. 
All the staff were very professional and accommodating and always willing to help. Overall a great stay and highly recommended.",5,2021,08,06
150,Fantastic hotel and great service,"Me and my son spent a night in the hotel it was absolutely amazing very helpful and attentive. I would advise about the menu be increased and also offer just normal
Pizza and other options for food would be great. The fish & chips were amazing ",5,2021,08,05
150,Excellent,"Very friendly and helpful staff, Delighted with out stay, very comfortable and spacious. Nice and clean through out, We will definitely book again, did not try the food this time but perhaps on our next visit.  ",5,2021,08,04
150,Two thumbs up,"This is a very well located property in excellent condition even though its a bit older. The staff is friendly and helpful and the overall appearance is spacious and elegant. Our room was large, clean and comfortable. There is no question that I would stay here again on my next visit to London.  ",5,2021,08,02
150,Recent stay,Had a great experience at the hotel. It was a great location. Staff were very attentive and really enjoyed the lounge facilities we booked. There was a wide selection at breakfast. Would definitely come again. ,5,2021,07,26
150,Terrible,"Room lock on the door was broken (could easily see it had been pulled off). Eyehole in the door had been tampered with. Had to call security at 2.30am to try & fix the issue. In room telephone was out of order. Had to physically go to the reception to first order breakfast menus then place the order again. Had booked a breakfast deal but this wasn’t honoured at chk out, I was told it’s room only. Had phoned beforehand to ask about onsite car parking & was told yes. On reaching I was told I had to use the nearest car park!
After speaking to manager about all issues she knocked of £30!!!! Initially hotel was trying to fob me off with a £12 discount. I told her you may aswell keep the £30",1,2021,07,26
150,Weekend Birthday Stay,"All in all an excellent stay at The Churchill.

Check in was friendly and efficient, we didn't use the concierge service for our bags although it was offered.

The hotel reception is very grand and well designed, the reception area was spotlessly clean.

The lifts were prompt, you need your key card to request them.

Access to the room easy, just tap your key card, the room was lovely, just like you see on the website, again the room was spotless, lots of tv stations, really nice view out onto Portman Sq. Bathroom was lovely, very modern, good shower, even the toilet seat was heated!.

Breakfast in the morning was really nice, lots of choice, I had some fruit and a full cooked English, really tasty, piping hot, coffee was really nice too, as were the fruit juices, polite efficient service from all of the staff.

My only disappointment is with the minimum spend at the hotel bar The Churchill, I pre booked this and in fairness I was advised of the minimum spend of £30.00 per head after 16:00 when I booked, given I had spent hundreds of pounds for a room I don't think guests should be made to adhere to the minimum spend rules, it's as if residents are being told we want you to stay the night with us but drink elsewhere unless you spend a minimum of £30.00 each, the money isn't the principle here its just a bit much to ask I think to guests who are staying. This could easily be rectified by residents showing there key card when they enter the bar and again when they pay.
",5,2021,07,25
150,5 Star Stay!,"Balcony suite on top floor, spacious, very well presented and modern, Lovely welcome card from the team! one of the top hotels in London, and its clear see on arrival, food was amazing in restaurant. Will be staying here again in the future",5,2021,07,20
150,"Not the best 5* hotel, by far.","My husband is registered blind, which reception were informed about, yet we were placed into a room as far from the lifts as possible. The hotel was at a very low occupation level with many more suitable room options. We were also made to feel inferior as we used pre-paid vouchers, even after paying an extra payment of £ 270.",3,2021,07,20
150,Short break,"Excellent service from all members of staff. The hotel was immaculate as was our room. 
I would highly recommend this hotel due to it cleanliness and location. 
The staff went over and above to accommodate. ",5,2021,07,16
150,Perfect hotel experience and great location,Bearing in mind we are/were still under covid restrictions Hyatt made the very best of this situation. Everything looked spotlessly clean all of the time. The staff were so friendly too. The Montague bar was excellent for pre dinner cocktails and the breakfast was also excellent. we don't normally do hotel breakfast but we looked/shown around the breakfast offering when we checked in and then added it to our stay. We booked a King size room. Plenty of space and very peaceful ambience. A very short stroll and you're on Oxford Street so good location. This will probably be our hotel of choice now when visiting London.,5,2021,07,13
150,Weekend away,We stayed here whilst in London for our anniversary.  The hotel was lovely.  I have stayed in numerous 5 star hotels and this is certainly among the best.  The staff were very polite and helpful. Food and drinks were lovely. ,5,2021,07,13
150,An unparalleled level of Service,"I stay in London hotels pretty much on a weekly basis. Due to lack of availability at my usual spot, i decide to give Hyatt Regency a try, a decision i didn't regret,
Paul and Eddie at reception set the tone for our visit by making us feel very welcome. The building has been modernised to some degree but still holds a certain charm. Walls are plastered with Churchills paintings, sculptures etc. 

We had a family room, interconnecting. 1 superking bed and two singles. We had also asked for a travel cot which was placed in the room. On arrival the room had a personalised message on the table with some mini cheesecakes, i think. The kids also had a 'party bag' with activities and the baby cot had organic natural baby shampoo etc. The room was clean, comfortable and the kids enjoyed using the bidet mate!!!

We needed some medicine for our youngest who was teething. Patrick one of the managers, organised a pharmacy visit and brought us the medicine. 

I was amazed at how helpful  the staff were. 

You get what you pay for. Definitely staying here again.",5,2021,07,13
150,Weird experience - bad staff training maybe !,"Decent stay ruined by one experience.
We have stayed at this Hyatt many times and pop in every few weeks for a drink in the lobby.
Generally everyone is extremely friendly and the whole hotel is run without fault.
This time however we were having tea in the lobby and my son decided to eat a biscuit from his bag, he had brought from elsewhere  whilst drinking his tea, there was only one other couple in the whole lobby who could not see him.
The waiter took it upon himself to tell my son off “don’t eat food that you have not purchased here as I’ve been watching you”. This was just plain weird and not acceptable. Nobody could see him, the place was empty and it was a small cookie in his bag.

This person ruined our experience and we are in London again in a couple of weeks and are staying elsewhere.",3,2021,07,11
150,Business trip,My business trip to London since 4 till 8 July. Stay at The Churchill Hyatt was as usual nice and relaxing. The breakfasts were amazing and good to prepare for busy days. Room was good prepared and clean.,5,2021,07,09
150,Superb 30th anniversary Treat,Every member of staff made it their business to make us feel welcome. This was a treat we gave ourselves to mark our 30th wedding anniversary. The buffet breakfast was superb and the staff extremely attentive. ,5,2021,07,09
150,Best accommodation in London,"The Churchill Hotel is is a renowned establishment that keeps its excellent standards for decades yet is also up to date. The interior design and furnishings are classic, pretty and comfortable. Attention is given to the smallest Of details. The location is unbeatable super central yet pleasant and quiet. The service very good indeed. ",5,2021,06,29
150,Let down by terrible housekeeping,"A special weekend in London for our anniversary and to be guests at a friends wedding. Upon arrival and good check in we went to our room to find soiled bedsheets ( human !!) and hairs on the pillows.
We reported it and upon return from shopping we found the room and been cleaned to a good standard. Many apologies and some bathroom gifts and wine…however we didn’t feel comfortable afterwards, even though the management did make every effort to sort it.     Very sad given my prior visits to this hotel and Hyatt’s in the far east we’re always an exceptional experience.",3,2021,06,28
150,Staff...,"Seek soothing surrounds for breakfast with lovely yogurt, chilled and freshly squeezed orange juice, good coffee and unobtrusive but responsive service?

Look no further.

Happily, the Hyatt Regency in London not only provides the above with ease, but seeks the same in response to all requests.

A weekend trip to see friends in London began with doorman Vincent springing to help and happily serving as valet to look after car as long as I cared for.

First impressions were good despite the lounge yet to reopen.

More than one member of staff professed to be new - one at front desk and one on the terrace in the evening - not to excuse shortcomings, but simply to express a happy anticipatory mild nervousness at joining the team.

Micaela helped me check in and help to navigate the Hyatt app and tend to my waning iPhone battery immediately to hand whilst I held the first of a couple of scheduled meetings.

Hyatt hotels have a smaller footprint than Hilton and IHG and so I have never been tempted to build up a number of stays. After deciding earlier however to cancel an  InterCon Park Lane a Weekend Ambassador certificate booking for the weekend, and eschewing a tempting deal at the lovely Conrad in St James, I thought to try Hyatt for a mixed purpose stay after positively reading again about the group.

Might the gym be a little larger and with more varied equipment? Perhaps, although as deserted when used that a minority opinion possibly. Is the King room a little cosy as regards size? For London, no. Comfortable and designed to feel airy and exuding quiet quality. Certainly not cramped in comparison to awful examples at decent hotels in the near vicinity.

And, really, those examples of nitpicking.

Cristina at the front desk is a supernova. Marshaled the troops as needed,  effortlessly seemed to appear in multiple locations, attentive to requests, creative and took it upon herself to solve rather than simply advise. Elegant and funny to boot. If (when) she climbs up the ladder, I hope that she is able to maintain some contact with customers. Hyatt would be foolish to lose her and all she brings.

To her colleagues in the Montagu Kitchen, Churchill Bar Terrace, Housekeeping, Concierge and elsewhere, I similarly found an attention to detail, high level of competence and reassuring demeanour.

I may have to apply that InterCon Ambassador Weekend certificate somewhere else in the world once travel opens up.. My preferences for central London have changed.",5,2021,06,27
150,Staff were excellent!! ,"We had a rather brief encounter with the Hyatt Regency......unfortunately the night we were due to check in, our car was broken into in the neighbouring NCP car park and all our luggage taken (not linked to the hotel). The staff were extremely kind and compassionate - they gave us a huge basket of toiletries and replacement cuddly toys for the children. When we decided we didn’t actually want to stay, around 9.30pm (the car couldn’t be secured and our weekend ruined, so just wanted to go home), the lady on reception (Judy), was very kind to us and agreed to refund us for the night we had booked. They couldn’t do enough for us and we felt very looked after. We were disappointed not to be staying (the family adjoining rooms were very nice!), but will definitely return in the future.....minus the car next time!!",5,2021,06,27
150,Wonderful 2 night stay,"What a wonderful way to celebrate a special birthday ! My sister booked a two night stay as a surprise present. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are incredible, so friendly and accommodating. The food in the restaurant was delicious, the breakfast even better !  The rooms are luxurious and extremely comfortable. 

Thank you to everyone at the Churchill for making my birthday so memorable.",5,2021,06,24
150,Excellent Service,"One of the best customer service i have recently experienced. Room a bit small (I guess because of the location) and super clean and tidy. Overall experience: excellent. We  went for a quick weekend to London. We forgot a dress from my wife after check-out, we called them up and they went and pick it up from the room and delivered to us (after our long day in London) with a cover and hanger. Top professionals",5,2021,06,12
150,Short City Stay,"Immaculate city centre hotel in the world’s second greatest city. Very clean, comfortable and quiet rooms. Nice bar and restaurant. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, especially the doorman. I will definitely go again. ",5,2021,06,07
150,Amazing London stay,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional service a very memorable trip. Cocktails on the terrace were exquisite and the cleanliness of the room and public areas was very impressive. Highly recommend this hotel for a special occasion ",5,2021,06,06
150,A fantastic hotel,"My room was spacious and luxurious, the staff where all fantastic and the COVID protocol made me feel extremely safe.
The Bar was welcoming with a great atmosphere,
Breakfast was good with a great variety.
Above all the staff where fantastic",5,2021,06,02
150,"Fantastic stay, excellent breakfast and superb staff",My girlfriend and I spent 2 nights at The Churchill over Bank Holiday weekend and it was brilliant. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with all requests. The breakfast buffet was absolutely great and the proximity of the hotel to Oxford Street and Hyde Park whilst being quiet and private was second to none. We will definitely be returning. ,5,2021,06,01
150,Fabulous,"Great hotel, fabulous location and lovely staff... I recommend anyone to stay here, the hotel is so so close to great shopping and restaurants. It’s also only 10 minutes taxi drive from
Paddington station.
",5,2021,05,31
150,Great Service,"Of all the hotels I have stayed at in London, the Hyatt Regency London has by far the most helpful, accommodating and genuinely kind staff I have ever experienced. They went out of their way to make our stay the best it could be, was very impressed!",5,2021,05,31
150,Lovely Stay at a wonderful hotel.,"Hotel was extremely welcoming.  Check in was very fast, we did have an issue with our room key and was unable to access the room at first but staff sorted issue out soon enough and was able to get inside the room.  Room was very clean and spacious, everything was working and in excellent condition. All staff was very kind and helpful to all requests and resolved any problems quickly. Fantastic location. Definitely recommend.",5,2021,05,24
150,Three Days in London,"Spent a couple of nights at the Churchill just after lockdown restrictions were eased as I wanted to see my daughter who lives in London and had a birthday this week. Stayed in a standard room on a deal with Travelzoo. Room was comfortable, reasonably spacious with a good shower room. I had not noticed that that on the reservation the hotel stated that they only clean the room every three days. I assume this is because of the pandemic?
The hotel was very quiet as there are virtually no tourists in London so not sure my experience was 'normal'. I had the gym to myself in the morning and there very few people eating the good breakfast in the Montague Kitchen.
 The staff were uniformly lovely, a real credit to their hotel only blemish was a hotel guest losing his temper with them in the bar one night. His constant shouting made the atmosphere quite unpleasant for a while and security were slow to get him out.. Other than that the stay was very good.",4,2021,05,21
150,Decent Hyatt with a spacious lounge,"During this business trip I gave Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill a try.  My room was in a standard Hyatt style I expected.  The club lounge was very spacious, which gave me some room to take a rest and also to enjoy the food!  I will keep this hotel in my shortlist for my next London trip.",5,2021,01,31
150,Pauline B,"Went for a Christmas weekend treat with my husband. The service at the hotel was exemplary, we  ate at their pop up Apres Ski restaurant which was lovely. They offered us a late check out on Sunday to 6pm which made it a full weekend. The breakfast was first class I Would highly recommend was good value for money ",5,2020,12,18
150,Christmas break - at last!,"Our seventh year staying at the Churchill. As fantastic as ever, despite the restrictions in place, expertly done by the Hotel - clean,  safe and secure. Breakfast was absolutely stunning and service was as ever exemplary. The only real change I noticed was in the Churchill bar - the outside seating was much more functional then previously - but I suspect down to fact that you have to serve meals with all drinks now. The pop up ski lodge was brilliant - great innovation. We had the family suite and it was absolutely superb. As always, if anyone ever asks, I always recommend the Churchill (and we stayed at the Shard in the summer)!",5,2020,12,17
150,Amazing,"I am blogger,( Mohamed Alosimi Kuwaiti live in Leeds UK) visiting different hotels to make my opinion.
Everything was good 
Helpful staff , quality and service 
I hoped to be able to see other rooms , but couldn’t get agreement from the hotel because coronavirus. Hope can do it in future",5,2020,11,07
150,Outstanding service and a warm welcome,"Great staycation at the Churchill. The location is excellent for Shopping in London. 
The staff were superb, friendly, courteous and very helpful. Nothing was too much trouble 
Well done 👍🏻 Particularly in these difficult times. ",5,2020,11,02
150,High quality Hyatt,"From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional, such a warm welcome and could see instantly how the hotel was COVID secure with hand sanitiser stations at the entrance and a digital temperature check as such we felt very safe here. 

The hotel has a glorious scent throughout the lobby, lifts and communal areas

Even before arriving my expectations were high as I had been contacted by the concierge with a really clear detailed email regarding my time at the hotel (including measures to explain how the hotel was COVID safe), as such as I was able to advise the time of arrival and to my utmost delight the room was ready when we arrived and I was also able to make dinner and drinks reservations at the Churchill bar and terrace

The rooms are beautifully decorated and throughout the hotel there are nods to Churchill which was really tastefully done.

We had a king room with garden view (I recommend this) view was pretty and autumnal and despite being on a main road was incredibly peaceful thanks to the triple glazed windows. The bed and the linen was sumptuous and we both slept incredibly well.

Bathroom is small but has everything you need with the gorgeous pharmacology amenities that Hyatt offers, we were particularly amused by the toilet that has all sorts of settings including the ability to make the seat warm.

Plenty of storage, good quality iron and ironing board and hairdryer provided. 

Due to COVID the tea tray was somewhat limited    but was able to phone down for more tea bags and milk which arrived quickly and in plentiful supply.

The tv remote had been sanitised but the tv was a bit fiddly to work (we got there eventually!)

We had lunch in the Montague restaurant which was nice but the menu was incredibly limited in terms of choice for vegetarians and or pescatarians (we assume this is because of COVID) in the evening the menu was exactly the same when we ate at the Churchill bar and terrace so with hindsight we should have eaten somewhere else. What I would recommend are the cocktails at the bar, great choice and lovely ambiance.

Breakfast was excellent- really good choice of hot and cold foods.

This hotel is perfect if you are popping to Selfridges or in fact any of the shops on Oxford street as it’s just round the corner. There are plenty of great restaurants and bars nearby too.

We absolutely loved our stay here and can’t wait to come back!",5,2020,11,01
150,Anniversary celebration,Very impressive COVID arrangements. The cleanliness was very good and we felt all appropriate measures were taken. The staff were excellent and the hotel played a big part in us having a fantastic anniversary celebration. ,5,2020,10,16
150,Great hotel and expectional staff,"The hotel is finished to a high quality, the restaurants and bars are great as well. The location is perfect as its quiet and a nice garden infant of the hotel. The staff are by the far the best thing, very professional and caring at the same time.",5,2020,10,06
150,Get the basics right !!,"Tv did not work and temp in shower lukewarm at best. Not really interested in whether Covid secure if you can't get basics right in a 5 star hotel. Food was good, check in efficient and staff couteous. Room very stylish but in a 5 star hotel the basics need to be spot on.",2,2020,10,01
150,Beautiful stay in London at the Hyatt,"Great position, friendly staff, everything was fine although some restrictions due to Covid-19 emergency limited the services that the hotel could offre. Anyway we enjoyed our time spent at the Hyatt Regency and we’ll come back",5,2020,09,26
150,Lovely Nights Sleep,"Haven't been to this hotel for years and things are definitely things have changed. What hasn't is the welcome and quality of service here. During covid all the hotels have had to change their operations. What they have done here is brilliant, the visors worn by staff are great as you can actually see people's faces is a really nice touch. 
The room while compact was lovely, very clean and ultra tidy and the beds are super comfy. Its a great location for all London sights. One of the nicer hotels in London and definitely worth a visit. 
Thanks to all the staff for making us feel very safe and extremely welcome. ",5,2020,09,20
150,Excellent Hotel,"This was our second stay at Hyatt Churchill and we enjoyed it again. 

It is a busy hotel in an excellent location close to Regent st and many shops and Marylebone.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff are friendly and professional. 

We will stay at this hotel again.",4,2020,04,30
150,Hyatt Regency the Churchill March 2020,"The staff overall was amazing from communication to doing everything in their power to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a very difficult time. My family had to change their plans last minute due to travel restrictions. We had to cancel our plans to meet up with my mom and her husband in Italy and instead had them fly to London. I was allowed to book a cash rate room for them and still gift my globalist benefits. They were booked in a balcony suite immediately next to mine to keep us together. Asja provided amazing communication and really made us feel taken care of during the whole process. Beata & Magdalena, from the regency club lounge, took such great care of my entire family. I can’t thank them enough. Wether we were at the regency lounge or downstairs in the restaurant, they both went above and beyond to ensure we felt safe, welcome and taken care of. We hope to see them all again. I’ve had great experiences at many Hyatt properties. This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to make a return trip somewhere solely due to the staff. I’m missing some names of people we only encountered a time or two. Everyone we came in contact with from the doormen, to front desk, to the servers, and housing staff were amazing. We can wait to come visit you again as soon as the world allows us to. Thank you so much. The Bird Family.",5,2020,03,20
150,we really enjoyed our time here,from the outside it did not look like much..  but inside it becomes a great hyatt. we got lucky with our son using his hyatt status to book us a suite with a balcony.... so cool !!! service is top notch here and real orchids in room. very clean all over here. we walked to Buckingham Palace...,5,2020,03,14
150,Great,"The hotel is just some blocks away from a Oxford avenue and 4 blocks away from the underground. 
Rooms are small, which can be expected on European hotels of this type, but they are comfortable and have everything that is necessary.",5,2020,03,08
150,English Elegance,We had the most amazing time!  Our accommodations were well appointed.  Breakfast was extra special and the staff was well... professional and amazing!  I highly recommend this property for anyone who wants to be totally spoiled! ,5,2020,03,07

150,Best Hotel in London," Thinking where to stay in London ? If you like a hotel with great location and outstanding service then the Churchill is your choice.
A very welcoming staff from checking in till the check out, the offer an upgrade to my room free of charge once they knew I was celebrating two different occasions and they surprised me on both occasions with great gifts .
These kinds of things makes an establishment rise above all other hotels.
Thanks a million to all Hyatt Regency the Churchill staff for being such a wonderful staff especially the Guest Relations team and now I'm a member of world of Hyatt .
Thanks",5,2020,03,02
150,A comprehensive review comparing three different Hyatt hotels in London from a Hyatt Globalist's perspective,"I am writing this review to compare three different Hyatt brands in London that I have stayed last week. This was my third stay at Hyatt London Churchill and I love the high class quality and the consistency of the service here.

Location: (9/10)
Located next to Oxford street, 5 mins walk from Marble Arch tube station. Walking:  distance to Hyde park and Parklane.

Room: (10/10)
Huge suite offered as a perk for Hyatt Globalist upon check-in. The room was huge with large sitting area, spacious bedroom and a decent size bathroom. Bed was comfortable.

Service: (9/10)
Attentive staffs at Club lounge. Our suite wasnt available at the time when we check in, as we did prefer the better room category. We were given keys for Club lounge access. 

Dining / Breakfast (9/10)
Very good afternoon tea and evening drink service at Club lounge. Nice spread of canapes with ham, cheese and hot bites etc. Breakfast at Club lounge offered ordinary English breakfast on buffet table.
Food were nicely prepared.

Facilities (8/10)
Very good club lounge with two wings, spacious enough to accommodate large number or business travellers. Gym was releatively small but still adequately equipped. There was no sauna, steam or spa etc.

Overall 45/50 (Best of the three London Hyatt hotels that I have stayed last week - Hyatt regency, Andaz Liverpool Street and Great Scotland Yard)

Very good and centrally located hotel, will definitely stay in Hyatt Regency London Churchill again when I visit London this Autumn.",5,2020,03,01
150,Charming and perfect,"This hotel which has variously been an independent, and Intercontinental and now a Hyatt is delightful.  It has old-world charm with completely up to date services.  The staff is very cordial and attentive.  I highly recommend it.",5,2020,03,01
150,Very Pleased with Churchill London,Recently stayed at The Hyatt Churchill in London.  Very nice property in great location.  I would recommend the property to anyone visiting London and especially if they are hosting a small business meeting in one of the conference rooms.,5,2020,02,28
150,Short break,"Great hotel & locayed near Hyde Park and Marble Arch tube station was handy. The staff are always willing to assist in any way. The food was excellent and the club lounge was good.Will 100% return on our next visit.
",5,2020,02,24
150,Business Trip to London,"Very pleasant and helpful.  Made a last minute request for private dining for 7 people and Hyatt management were able to accommodate it.  Overall very pleased with the service.  The only suggestion I would have is to have the driveway to the main entrance to be open more often.  The last three trips to the Hyatt, my service had to park on the main road to drop me off which can be a challenge depending on the traffic and weather",5,2020,02,24
150,Back to Churchill ... once again,"I've been staying in this hotel for many years (25?), when I want to be close to Marble Arch. Always has a high standard of service. One of the best in London. Breakfast is always on of the best I ever had in a 5star hotel. And the Churchill bar is a must, at least for one night.",5,2020,02,22
150,Feels like Home,"The location is unbeatable. Reception was easy and friendly. the room was clean and very well equipped and appointed. No problem whatsoever, a small leaking hose in the bathroom was fixed immediately. In 3 minutes after it was reported!!!
The Montague Kitchen (the Hotel's main restaurant) has turned into a gourmet restaurant which some may find a little bit out of their taste.",5,2020,02,22
150,Great location and great staff,"We decided to take a couple of nights in London even though we live close by, great location for tube, shopping and the park. Due to the weather we couldn’t use the park which had a tennis court and kids play area which was a shame but looked great. Some reviews have talked about the hotel not being amazing for families, we travelled with our lively 4 year old and everyone was great with him, engaging and playful, sticker book etc. Food and drink is expensive but the going rate for the area, hence the very good value rating. Thank you to the team and look forward to returning the next time we want a few nights in the city. ",5,2020,02,21
150,Great Experience in UK,"This Trips I have stayed in two different hotel( JW Marriott Grosvenor , Hyatt Regency Churchill), I would recommend to stay in Hyatt Regency Churchil as better location and friendly staff. All staffs handle my inquiry and question so professional and efficient ",5,2020,02,15
150,Outstanding Hotel,Outstanding hotel in terms of quality in all aspects plus the prime location in the center of London. Lounge was perfect place to spend evening time with plenty of varieties of drinks and food. Definitely will come back and recommend it to others. ,5,2020,02,15
150,Our favorite hotel in a London ,"This is our favorite hotel in London. It has everything you need for a good stay - super clean, comfortable, great service, convenient location, very good breakfast and selection of on-site restaurants! Really the best in its class! Thank you! ",5,2020,02,13
150,First one night stay on our excursion,"We were on the eight floor and has a view of the nearby gardens. The room was adequate and it had all the normal facilities expected, The king sized bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was on the ground floor and offered many choices although the hot heavy ceramic dishes were difficult to lift the heavy lids. the level of waiter/waitress service was not universal",5,2020,02,10
150,Too expensive for what it is,"Very good service and good quality of food but too expensive with hidden fees (the service is not included and side dish is very expensive)
In my room I did not had a simple desk for working... I ask for one they give me a table for putting my glass of wine + I had no cupboard but an open hanger tray",2,2020,02,09
150,Great location and great value!,This is a lovely property in a great location in London. The price is very reasonable considering all other properties around and the location. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Service was very good.  Highly recommend!,5,2020,02,09
150,Best choice at Marylebone,"I’m kind of suspect as I stay at The Churchill every time I am
In London since 15 years ago, so what could I add is that since then it is the vest choice, best service, best accommodations, near Oxford St, Selfridge’s, Marble Arch Subway, Restaurants and Theaters. I can’t think about a better place to stay.",5,2020,02,05
150,Classy and Understated Hotel,"This bustling hotel near Oxford street celebrates all things Churchill in an understated manner (his silhouette as the logo, his quotes in the gym).  My room was surprisingly spacious and quiet with a perfectly soft king sized bed to sleep away the jet lag.  Bathroom amenities (and shower were also top notch, with a high tech toilet/bidet).  The restaurant was solid with mostly hits (salmon, seafood pie) and a few misses (vegan macaron, cauliflower soup).  The service was impeccable and I would definite stay again.",4,2020,02,01
150,Wonderful experience,"Nice place, easy to shop around, you will find a variety places to shop around and a variety of restaurants and cafes of your choice. Staff were friendly and welcoming, a lovely place to stay in.

Thank you all for your services! Specially Aziz:)
",4,2020,01,27
150,King room not in a good area of the hotel and not so nice as the King room for 2 people,"I have stayed many times at the Churchill mostly with my husband and once with my kid. We booked a bigger room since we were mostly 2 and needed space. I paid 475£ for a King room
now and i was only 1 person so i expected the room to be with floors. I expected also to have a window with light not the half window closed by a brick wall. The area in which the room was situated was very crowded with single rooms possibly and it was very noisy in the night with 6 doors in the small area corridor. I thought all rooms had flooring but this one had carpet. Apart from these the staff were very helpful, checkin at 15:00 was very quick, the room was super clean with the latest and most fashionable toilet items. the bed was very comfortable and the sheets very clean and silky! The breakfast experience was a bit difficult because the 2 employees went up and down all the time trying to charge the people who came with rooms but without breakfast im their rate so she was very nervous and i waiting for some time to fulfill these transactions while i was hungry. But the breakfast was amazing!",4,2020,01,27
150,My stay at the Churchill,"
I love London and I love staying at the Churchill.  It is beautiful and elegant.  The staff is courteous and professional.  The location is great for everything.  The Club for is well stocked and the food is very very good.  My room was absolutely perfect...well appointed and very clean.   I will definitely come back and bring my coworkers!!!",5,2020,01,25
150,GREAT VISIT ,"Review is for the cocktail bar only 
Very pleasant and as you would expect upmarket 
Helpful staff
My gin and tonic forgot which gin was superb 
Complimentary nibbles 
Reminded it was the Oxley gin
Great visit ",4,2020,01,25
150,"Great location, warm and family oriented","Churchill is a great hotel, in a great location. Newly renovated rooms are very comfortable and bathrooms are super. One of the few hotels in London with a bidet and/or water shower for the toilet. Very important for some. ",4,2020,01,24
150,Bad,"Terribly overpriced. The room was really expensive, not a plug in the bathroom for hair dryer, bathroom barely clean and staff was quite unpleasant. I will not stay in this hotel again, so many better and cheaper options in London.",1,2020,01,20
150,Pleasant Enough,"Hyatt Regency Churchill

Pro’s

1.	 Full -Service  Hotel in a chic and trend  location central to most of what London has to offer . 
2.	While the hotel can use a refresh, its hallway’s and rooms are kept clean and tidy.
3.	AC and Heat can be well adjusted to suite your comfort level and/or be regulated via maintenance with a phone call.

Con’s

1.	There is no lobby to speak of, and the hotel has perhaps a total of four small uncomfortable sofas to sit.  A bus depot waiting room comes to mind.  The hotel can use a refresh.
2.	While the Churchill Bar remains an outstanding place for drinks and a light bite,  the other eatery - Montagu Kitchen - offers just ok food that reminds one of that bus depot mentioned above.
3.	Rooms can be small, and room rates can creep up to the cost of more posh establishments while bed pillows are not supportive. 

Due to a disappointing stay last May, the hotel graciously extended an offer to upgrade out next stat to an executive one -bedroom suite which we accepted.  

With some caveats,  we consistently find the Hyatt Churchill to be one of the most useful, non-pretentious hotels’ in London.  We appreciate the no nonsense of the experience and further appreciate that the  hotel product as a whole is carried out without spectacle.  London hotels can be extremely pretentious – as Prince William once said, “No-one does pomp like the Brits” – and he is exactly right.  Still, our mouths fall on the floor when we enter hotels such as the Ritz to watch suburban Americans fully dressed in gowns and suits at 11am so they can enjoy “tea” service.  We scratch our heads at the doormen from The Connaught who delight in passing judgement on you as you enter the hotel as if they are paying for your stay. Then there is the 12,563 glasses and cutlery presented at your table for use with your breakfast at the Savoy.   

None of that silliness exists here.  What you will find are very small rooms,  or suites that are larger but not the most luxurious with prices that can be high – at times.  There is the usual problem with the English language as is in many hotels across London,  but by and large the staff aims to please without all the fuss.

Before booking, read room descriptions – its important. Note the size of the rooms (which can be smaller than size given) and note there are renovated and non- renovated rooms that are not indicated in the Hyatt reservation system.  Also note the hotel participates in the Hyatt Privy Program which gives you such upgrades as breakfast for two, a hotel credit for the duration of your stay, and a POSSIBLE upgrade.  The program must be booked through a travel agent but nonetheless rates are often very similar if not the same as the quoted rate you would find on your web site.

Also note this is not an UBER luxury hotel.  This is a hotel for people that want services in a very clean and neat space.  It is a hotel that does not provide much hand holding – the concierge staff can be helpful but may not be as knowledgeable as you would like.  Still, it ain’t a Holiday Inn.  

Check In 

Unlike our last check in experience when we were greeted by a funeral director from some other European nation, our check in was a delight with a young Frenchman who was communicative, pleasant and welcoming.  Our room was not yet ready, so we left our luggage with the delightful young man and went out to have a bite to eat.  Soon after we received a phone call that our room was ready, and luggage had already been brought to the room.  There were no hundred questions, no “How are you doing today” and no “we have a lovely room and restaurant here on premises” and we were thrilled and ever so happy about that.  It was an efficient pleasant check in.  

Room

To be clear we were graciously upgraded to an executive one-bedroom suite.  Waiting for us was a lovely welcome gift basket with a tin of cookies, tea, a book of Winston’s Quotes and a candle.  It was a lovely gift to be sure,  although when we opened the tin of shortbread cookies, we discovered that they had been opened already and half eaten!  Still the gestures was warm and welcoming.  We also received a lovely “Happy Birthday” desert as we were celebrating a birthday , and a lovely bottle of prosecco.  

The most remarkable feature of these suites is the space .  As you enter there is a very tight half bath with a counter and toilet, although the toilet is  squeezed into the space.  Then there is a large space with a sofa, desk with a bench that can certainly double as an eating area and built in cabinetry that had a ton on storage space.  Also is a large enough coffee table and two end tables.  A large TV sits on one of the cabinets and also has the modestly stocked mini bar minus the booze.  

There are “French” doors (kinda -sorta) that lead to the bedroom which featured ample draw storage but a smallish closet.  The king size bed was firm as is mostly the case in all Hyatt’s but can be inconsistent at this hotel. We have had beds at this hotel that have seen better days.  Pillows are not as supportive as should be.  If that is an issue, ask for more .  

The en-suite bathroom was large enough and featured a make up area, shower and bathtub as well as the Japanese Toilet (always fun to use) and a single sink.  The shower proved to be way too tiny with little space to maneuver. Still, housekeeping kept the toiletries refreshed (Molton Brown) and had the basic necessities such as q-tips and cotton balls.  It should be noted that there are additional items you can request via housekeeping such as dental kits.

In general, we were satisfied with the space with a few notes.  The space was furnished amply, but I wouldn’t say luxuriously.  To be fair it is an “executive room” and I’d rather basic furnishings.  Some hotels such as the Ritz furnishings can make you feel like you are in an old age home- for triple the price.  

Perhaps the greatest criticism I have is that the room was way too dark.  The room we were given had no view and that was perfectly fine with us.  We don’t spend time looking out the window pondering life – we go out and live it.  But the room felt dark because the lightbulbs used were too dim for the space.  It’s a silly way to save money.  

Executive Lounge

The one-bedroom executive suites come with access to the executive lounge on the 8th floor.  This lounge has two rooms – one is for adults only and the other for families.  This is the space those with access can have breakfast, light bites during the day (beverages, cookies and a cake) and in the evening light bits and some self- serve liquor.  Breakfast was varied enough with eggs to order and the buffet offered scrambled eggs, bangers, bacon, smoked salmon, types of breads, cereals, beans, type of potato, extensive beverage and juice selection and some other daily surprise foods.  

In the past we found the executive lounge to be inconsistent and unacceptable.  Service was always spotty, tables left with dirty dishes, Adult room restriction never enforced, and other oddities.  

This time, the executive lounge was spot on – from the buffet area kept neat, clean and filled to the restriction of children being allowed to enter and romp around to the friendly and much improved service.  We cannot say if the hotel was lightly filled or if just fewer people booked lounge access accommodations, but the atmosphere was certainly more enjoyable and peaceful.  It was a pleasure to stop by in the evening and have a proper drink.  The buffet spread was fine although I’m not sure about the selections.  I wouldn’t necessary think to have a plate of smoked salmon with my gin and tonic but that is one of the offerings.  Perhaps more light bites would be in order – something like a pizza cut into bite portions, small finger sandwiches, or just more canapes.  Still there was enough of the offering to satisfy everyone.  As far as lounge offerings go, we thought the Conrad Hilton was a tad better.  At the Conrad, while there is a small buffet of items your server will actually bring you warm canapes to your table.  They do so to prevent people touching the food. The Conrad also offered a modified English tea in the lounge complete with scones and clotted cream.  

Food/Restaurants/Bars

The Churchill Bar Is always an amazing place to socialize and enjoy crafted cocktails.  We also find the food to be fine and the selection ideal for a cocktail bar.  As is the case in London, pours are teeny, tiny (think one ounce).  

Montagu Kitchen

This is perhaps the greatest disappointment.  The food itself and service is fine – it’s not that you’re getting low quality or ill prepared food.  We just found the selection to be boring.  This hotel has a large middle eastern/Indian following and we would have LOVED Indian or middle eastern food over the offerings at Montagu.  The hotel does make some of those offerings available but in small print on menus very discretely as if this kind of cuisine is somehow a secret.  I remember having an AMAZING Arabic breakfast – clearly marked as an offering choice on the menu – at the Savoy.  Middle eastern food is amazing and should be a clear offering to guests.  

One night we sat at a table near the cooking stations (it has an open kitchen) and we saw the cooks make a spaghetti dish for room service (it was whisked off).  I indeed had ordered this dish one night from room service.  While there were some pasta dishes on the menu there was no spaghetti so we asked the server if we could order it.  She explained that the food “is for the other side of the restaurant” (whatever that meant) and that she could not bring that food to our table? Perplexed, it occurred to me that the lack of her basic understanding of English was again the culprit.  We excused ourselves and walked a few blocks into central Marlyborn and had amazing food.  

Locanda Locatelli

Good but way overpriced Italian Food.  Not necessarily the first restaurant that comes to mind when thinking about Italian food in London.  Interestingly, every time we encounter Italian staff at the hotel and ask where a good Italian restaurant is,  they recommend Locanda Locatelli. 

  General Notes

The hotel is located in such a vibrant, hip neighborhood but first-time visitors might be fixated on walking to nearby Oxford street thinking that’s the neighborhood.  That’s a great option, but for a more local vibe simple go outside, face straight (ish) and walk a few blocks.  Within a five-minute stroll you will have a supermarket (Waitrose), many restaurants, bakeries, clothing shops, dry cleaners, laundromat, and more.  The area has an English “Village” feel to it and should not be missed. 
This is not the most fabulous in London,  but it is probably one of the most functional for visitors.  It’s a property that is clean and offers basic services without all the fuss and pretense other properties highlight.",4,2020,01,20
150,"Exquisite property, excellent location, close to shopping and tube","stayed in a suite 7h flr with club access facing roadway. Wasnt noisy at all. The room was a great size spacious with 2 bathrooms. The bed was incredibly comfortable I slept right thru my alarm  :)   a few times.  The lobby is elegant , great restaurants and amazing cocktails in the bar downstairs. I also loved the location, minutes from Oxford street positioned between Marble Arch and Bond Street Station. Great all round, Ill be back. ",5,2020,01,18
150,Fantastic in every way,"On my first visit to London this year, my husband & I had the pleasure of staying at the Hyatt Regency London Churchill.  I can’t imagine a better place to stay and enjoy that amazing city.  

Every facet of our stay was top notch, and there wasn’t a single issue or problem during our 5 night stay.  The location is ideal, both for walking around or catching the Tube.  The staff was the most attentive I’ve ever experienced, and the room was perfect (not tiny or cramped, as can be the case in large cities).  If you can, secure Club Access.  Not only did we have great breakfast options daily but we had cocktails & really outstanding hors d'oeuvres in the evenings.

We were originally booked at another Hyatt property (The Great Scotland Yard), but it was not ready in time to honor our reservation.  The Hyatt handled the situation superbly - kudos to their team who had to rebook everyone who had reservations at GSY.  While it would have been great to stay at the new Hyatt property, there was nothing less than stellar at the Churchill.  The only thing I would do next time is take advantage of the access to the private park across the way.  This is a truly fantastic hotel, and we’d return in a heartbeat.",5,2020,01,18
150,Excellent,"The more we stay here the more we like it. Noise free- this is indispensable to us- and it measures up. It is spotlessly clean and well maintained and the housekeeping staff perform. You can control your air conditioning. Barker Street is round the corner with restaurants, cinema, a Fitness First gym (that in the hotel is small and under-resourced). Plus Oxford Street, and the restaurants of Mayfair beyond. Reasonable packages and smart concierge staff. ",5,2020,01,14
150,"Great service, but bring your own snacks/drinks","Amazing service by all staff and a lovely clean room with all the amenities. However, don’t even think about touching the mini fridge or snack, for they are priced as if they are the last stock on earth. £4 for a regular Kit Kat and £6 for a small glass bottle of Coke. They are ridiculous prices and quite frankly a joke. ",4,2020,01,13
150,This location does not care about loyalty.,"I am World of Hyatt Explorist. From refusal to allow me to use points for an available upgrade to letting the family in the two rooms next to me make all the noise they wanted, it is clear this property has zero regard for Hyatt’s most loyal. ",1,2020,01,10
150,Great Experience,"Very pleased with the accommodations and staff -- excellent service and quality rooms. The only ""con"" I would mention is that the dining hours weren't very convenient for me. Breakfast not early enough and dinner started too late. I guess I just like to eat at off times! lol 

Enjoyed the Churchill and would stay there again. The Concierge team was especially wonderful!",4,2020,01,08
150,Just location ,"We’ve been to this hotel some years ago and our stay was really good one, this time we’ve booked a room with view and unfortunately we found the room in need of serious renovations as everything it’s so dull.. I understand the fact that  hotel wants to be friendly environmental and you have to ask for changing bedsheets before 3 nights of stay but what about general hygiene...  
Good breakfast.. Good Italian restaurant, we had dinner with guests, service was excellent even one of main dishes was wrong understand they fixed fast and was no fuss about..
Hotel has a great location but should not be just all about it... ",3,2020,01,08
150,Rooms in Excellent Location,"I like the hotel very much. The only drawback is that it can be very noisy within the sleeping quarters. Other than this minor complaint, the hotel is excellent, very well located and the staff are truly well trained.",4,2020,01,06
150,Great Stay,"The hotel is great and very well located on Oxford street. Everything is within reach; Regent St., Covent Garden, Hyde Park and even Knightsbridge. Very hospitable staff especially the concierge William. However breakfast was limited and the same was served for full week. Otherwise 5 Star. ",5,2020,01,05
150,Great Hotel!the hotel!,"Great Hotel! We enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The location is soo perfect no need to take a taxi to reach Selfridges and the other known shops. 
The rooms were soo clean and the employees was friendly too!",5,2020,01,04
150,Unremarkable and worn out hotel.  Nice location,"Unimpressed with this hotel and probably won’t be going back anytime soon. Very basic accommodations and nothing special other than the location and the great city it’s in. For the amount of money we spent (Over a grand a night) for a very basic room and experience, I’m sure there are better places to stay in this wonderful city. ",3,2020,01,03
150,Impeccable hospitality!,"We stayed at this hotel for a wedding anniversary and felt so well taken care of. We actually stayed the first night at a nearby hotel that was more expensive, but it did not feel that way. Switching to this Hyatt truly made our trip! From the concierge service to the front desk reception to the housekeeping, everyone was kind and welcoming, going above and beyond. With our room reservation we didn't realize we were getting the club lounge, but that became a highlight as well, with nightly hors d'oeuvres and dessert and an ideal breakfast spread. King bed was comfortable and 8th floor room was very quiet. Shower water pressure was fantastic. Between the Hyatt Churchill in London and the Hyatt Manchester in San Diego, we are now loyal Hyatt members forever!",5,2020,01,02
150,Favourite London Hotel,"Always stay here when I’m in London and have never been disappointed.  Great location, consistent  service - nothing is too much trouble for them. Am a Hyatt diamond member and this is right up there with their best properties I have stayed at.  Will be back in February. ",5,2020,01,02
150,Always the best in London,"One of the best luxury and distinctive hotels in London, yes a very special hotel, and this is the sixth time that I stay her , the room size is excellent, the services provided are distinct, and the food is varied and delicious, it is close to Oxford Street, Hyde Park and many important areas in London",5,2020,01,02
150,Love this Hotel,Everyone and everything was wonderful. The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  This was our second visit to the Hyatt Regency -  The Churchill and both times have been very pleased and satisfied with the staff.,5,2020,01,01
150,Great Hotel,"If you are looking for a nice place to sleep with a friendly and professional staff, look no further. Hyatt Regency Churchill gets 5 out of 5 stars on all of that. Comfy bed, nice bathroom amenities with heated toilet seats.

If you also have access to the club area it is worth it. Eggs made to order for breakfast with a wide selections of meats and amazing croissants.

The hotel is also in the middle of everything. Nothing is too far to get to. Great location for tourists. 

The food in the hotel however leaves a lot to be desired. The service is still exceptional but the food is just not good. It is bland and lacks seasoning. ",4,2020,01,01
150,Great hotel,"Rooms size is perfect and very convenient also the hotel is amazing, japanese toilets make my stay so special.. specially for us arab people we appreciate this input at this hotel.. 

Location is not very far from Selfridges department store  ",5,2020,01,01
150,Amazing location,We stayed here for one night and were overall very pleased. It is near Oxford street in Mayfair so it is very convenient. There are several tube and bus stops nearby. Very polite staff and decent sized rooms for London. Due to the cost I probably would not return.,5,2019,12,28
150,Fabulous Location and great staff,"We love coming to the Churchill we are treated well and we love the location and amenities...
We value the staff at the Regency Club and at the Montague restaurant...

Thanks to Chu the manager, Ibriham, Marianna and all those who made our stay amazing .... the Conseirge Toby was knowledgeable and helpful planning events... the staff at the Montague is amazing - great staff",5,2019,12,27
150,3 days on a work conference - only the food let it down,"Nice location, good clean rooms and facilities - including the conference rooms. The only negative was the food arranged over lunch, not a lot of variety (unless you were a vegetarian!) Still a solid hotel, but would not make it into my Top 3 choices for that part of town (let alone the whole city!)",4,2019,12,19
150,Rooms in need of a lot of care and attention,"Stayed on 9th floor in upgraded room, in which lots of things were tired, broken and just not great.  Hotel public area’s were fine.
Things not working - shower leaked, shaving plugs broken, sink and bathroom clean but old and tired, silicone needs doing again for example",3,2019,12,18
150,Beautiful Hyatt in Central London,"This is our 2nd time staying at this property. It is beyond beautiful and the staff is simply superb. We feel calm and taken care of here and the location could not be more perfect. Marble Arch is a few steps away, as is the tube station. Great shopping, the bar is amazing, and the lounge is great !",5,2019,12,17
150,Christmas Afternoon Tea,My boss booked afternoon tea for everyone.  The setting is beautiful but the service was shocking which was really disappointing.  People getting served at different times - some not even having their sandwiches when others were being served their scones/cake.  One waitress for 12 adults and 5 children was slightly hectic for her to be fair.  Would go back with a much smaller party or with a couple of people but no more.,3,2019,12,17
150,Nice hotel in central London,"The Hyatt regency is located at Portman square and just 10 mins walk away from oxford street and marble arch tube station. Rooms are nice and standard size. Towels are fluffy and bed comfortable. One small thing that irritated me is the toilet flush which is hidden behind the lid. So each time you want to flush, you need to put down the lid. Otherwise, a delightful hotel in the heart of London.",5,2019,12,16
150,Really excellent quality hotel ,"This is the nicest hotel I’ve ever stayed at in central London. It’s not the most expensive either. The staff are just amazing and the rooms are spotlessly clean, and vert comfortable. I don’t think we will stay anywhere else in future ",5,2019,12,14
150,Nice hotel for business trip,"This hotel is very conveniently located close to Marble Arch and Oxford Street, within easy walking distance to Regent Street and Soho. 
Some rooms face a nice garden. 
The main restaurant is pretty decent and so are the rooms that are cosy but on the small side. 
Only weak point is the service as I had to drag my suitcase in the lobby then to my room as no one offered to assist. 
I would also recommend this hotel more for business than for a personal trip as it lacks of charm and authenticity, and is always extremely busy lacking of quiet places in the lobby that feels most of the time like a train station during the rush hour. 
",4,2019,12,13
150,A nice hotel in London’s business area,"I have stayed at most hotels London is known for and have been to Hyatt Churchill at Portman Sq more often often than all other hotels. Because for prices similar to all other more prominent hotels, Hyatt Churchill offers more of everything..",5,2019,12,11
150,Just average.  Tired rooms. Lots of rules,"The best thing about this hotel is the location.  The rooms are very tired and are in desperate need of an update.  The bathrooms are tiny.  Room service is super expensive and very average.  The hotel vacuums twice a day and it is quite annoying to hear them vacuum outside your room at 6 or 7 pm.  I don't get all the glowing reviews because the hotel was very average.  If you question anything, they simply tell you it is their policy and they will not change it,  they have no idea of what customer service really is.
My tip:  get food delivered via Deliveroo and avoid room service.",3,2019,12,10
150,Excellent Hotel,"Our stay at The Churchill was excellent and could not have been better - a really good experience from start to finish.   Great location,  terrific service, lovely room and wonderful breakfast.  We have stayed before and will definitely stay again.",5,2019,12,10
150,Hotel Stay at the Churchill Hyatt Regency at Portman Square London,The Churchill Hyatt Regency at Portman Square is a great hotel in a great location just a short stroll from Oxford St and just down from Marble Arch tube station which conveniently is the Central Line. Great access to Hyde Park and Park Lane.,5,2019,12,07
150,Excellent location and comfortable rooms,"I enjoyed my stay at The Churchill very much. I found my room very comfortable indeed (large feather pillows; fancy Japanese toilet; American, UK, and French outlets), and the location very convenient to get to SoHo and train stations. The continental breakfast was fantastic. I would recommend to others.",5,2019,12,07
150,Great customer service from Front Desk,"Initially checked in by Tatiana - all very smooth - friendly - professional.

Decided to stay one more night (two in total) and dealt with Cristina at the front desk the following day.  Her customer service skills were amazing - she did every thing she could to help and accommodate our needs.  She went above and beyond.  Extremely satisfied with the service we received from her.  Her efforts made our weekend in London extra special.  ",5,2019,12,06
150,Personal Vacation,"Amazing Hotel , perfect Location and service . My special thanks to Mecael on the front desk for her amazing service. For sure we will come back to this hotel in our next visit to London. Thanks for the superb service Hyatt team. ",5,2019,12,04
150,Great Hotel and Fantastic Service,"The Churchill is truly one of the few hotels left in the world that provides service at an old world style and pace.  The staff are always courteous and helpful and the rooms clean, spacious and nicely decorated.  I truly enjoy all my stays at the Hyatt Regency London.",5,2019,12,03
150,Great hotel very small room,"Over priced for this kind of room in terms of size, but the location is superb! 
Was expecting to have bath rather than as shower for this kind of price tag.
Not enough information from the receptionist regards the breakfast location or what is the ‏facility available ",4,2019,12,03
150,Very nice 3-days visit,I stayed for 3 nights. The room was very comfortable and everything was excellent. The concierge was very helpful. The location being Judy beside oxford street and the marble arch was of great value. The breakfast buffet had some traditional arabic food too. ,5,2019,12,03
150,Relatively good,"The quality of staying in this hotel was average to consider the price. The room was clean,but less spacious. The lobby did not have enough seating area. The facility is not great.However, the staff was great.",3,2019,12,02
150,Vacation trip,Stayed here as an alternative to Great Scotland Yard which was not yet opened.  Very convenient proximity to Marble Arch tube station.  Very friendly staff and received recognition as a globalist with a suite upgrade.  Would stay here again. Recommended.,5,2019,12,02
150,Great location,"The hotel is located in London with walkable distance from shops, restaurants etc. The rooms were small for the price though the stay was comfortable.
Check in and check out process was quick and other facilities at the hotel were on par.",4,2019,12,02
150,A nice located luxury Hotel,"On a business trip for 4 days in London . Booked a club room . Arrived early 9:30 am . Room was not ready , however i went to the lounge to have breakfast & a few minutes later they brought me the keys. Check in was pleasent & Federica was very helpful , filled me with all the details on the room , access & facility of the lounge .

Price of course is expensive almost Sterling 600 per night including breakfast , lounge snacks , drinks & taxes. Location is great next to the shopping area. The only comment is not finding a good place to conduct small buisness meetings. Their bar is amust try a great hang out that i will review seperately :) .",4,2019,12,01
150,Amazing hotel!,"Possibly the best hotel stay we’ve ever had! This was our first Hyatt stay since becoming Globalist and WOW!!!! The staff was amazing, especially Babacar and Daniele! The Club lounge was great as was the location. We will definitely be back! ",5,2019,11,27
150,"Comfortable, High Quality Services, Nice Location","Quite satisfied with overall experience because it was comfortable due to the good service, clean room and nice location. I could sleep well because of its high quality of the bed. In addition, it was really silent in the room so felt comfortable to stay.",4,2019,11,22
150,Luxury with excellent service and perfect location,"The service level is excellent...right from the start when greeted by the doorman, then the porter...and all the way to the check-in process. We were pleasantly surprised to be allocated a room on the Regency Floor (top floor).  Our room was spacious compared to other hotels we have stayed in London.  We flew into London from Singapore, and we had planned 2 weeks in Europe thus we had big luggage among the 3 of us.  On our first day in London, our itinerary was to fly straight out to Amsterdam for 3 days then back to London.  We requested with Hyatt Regency The Churchill if we could leave our big bags with them for 3 days before we come back to check-in.  Without any hesitation, they said yes and ""processed"" our bags seamlessly within a few minutes.
The location of this hotel is perfect (well to us).  So convenient.  Just 3-4 mins walk to Oxford Street for all the shopping and restaurants.  Marble Arch underground station is also just around the corner. Overall, we were glad to have choose The Churchill for our stay in London.",5,2019,11,21
150,Excellent Hotel in Perfect Location,"Having previously stayed in several areas closer to Paddington, we decided to try Hyatt Churchill and loved it. The hotel is situated close to Marylebone for nice cafes, restaurants and shops and Oxford st for all the sights. 

From the hotel we walked to Mayfair, Soho, Covent Garden and Neal's Yard with an easy tube option back if raining. 

The rooms were spacious, comfortable and homely. The linen and towels were new and high quality, as was the toiletries. 

We are returning again in a couple of months and plan to stay here again.",5,2019,11,18
150,Fantastic hotel in a superb location,"We stayed here a few times recently each time was a delight. Check in is painless, the rooms are clean and spacious. I suggest upgrading to a room with club access so you can avail of the complimentary breakfast and snacks. The hotel is easy to get to by taxi, tube (it's a short walk from Marble Arch station) or car (valet parking is £40/day which isn't bad for central London) it is inside the ULEZ and congestion zones so make sure you're exempt or pay the fee before driving. With it being a few streets away from the main high street it's a very quiet hotel the quietest we've ever stayed at in London which is a blessing. The amenities are nearby with Selfridge's being around the corner. The restaurant downstairs has a fine menu with plenty of choice. All in all no complaints and will happily stay here again and again!",5,2019,11,17
150,Terrific Hotel,"I stayed 3 nights on a business trip and the hotel was very comfortable and accommodating. The room was large with a very comfortable bed and a large and luxurious shower. The lobby tea was terrific as was the buffet breakfast with a wide selection of high quality food. The location is great for meetings in Mayfair, Marleybone, South Ken and the city. The staff was always available and helpful. I would happily stay here again.",5,2019,11,14
150,A very fine Trip to London.,Outstanding hotel in an outstanding location. Excellent service from a very caring and friendly staff. All food was excellent.  If you want to be in the center of London this has to be the place to stay.,5,2019,11,13
150,Nice start to our trip,"We decided to have a day in London before we flew out for our honeymoon and chose to stay here. It didn’t disappoint. The location is spot on, so much to do around the hotel a small walk away. Staff are friendly and there if you need any help with anything. The prices for drinks in the bar aren’t too expensive and it is a great place to sit and have a drink even if you’re not staying at the hotel. Rooms are a decent size and clean. We ordered room service for breakfast and it was reasonably priced too. Would definitely go back. ",4,2019,11,10
150,Good hotel but not a good experience,"Check in if staff were great and the room was clean as well as the staff collecting our luggage from main door to the room were great however 
We had bad experience with one of the concierge staff who attended to a simple inquiry from us in a disrespectful manner that ruined the whole experience with this hotel ",2,2019,11,09
150,"Great stay, good location","Visited London for a business conference and stated at the Hyatt for it's great location, which is undoubtedly it's strong suit. I had read a previous review about snobbish service but in my experience this is very far from the truth. Staff is really professional but actually quite friendly too, and we noticed that both in the reception and the restaurant staff. Rooms need a bit of renovations, I stayed in a standard double room, definitely not like the rooms in resorts you find in Greece or Turkey. But for what I offers I think the price is relatively reasonable and I would choose it again should I visit London in the future. Shout-out to John for the exceptional and attentive service!",5,2019,11,07
150,A wonderful hotel to stay during vacation!,"This was our 4th trip to the Hyatt Churchill. It was a perfect 4 night stay after visiting Cornwall/Penzance.

We were graciously welcomed and checked into a newly renovated room, I was so happy to see a bath tub.  The rooms are nicely appointed, beds are very comfortable, and attentive maid service.

The lounge is a must have while staying at the hotel, it is good to come in for cups of tea/coffee between shopping and eating. The staff are all extremely helpful, pleasant and professional. It also has a continental breakfast and canapés during the evening.It is definitely worth paying for the use of the lounge. For your convenience rooms do have kettles with tea, coffee and milk.

It is conveniently located and many restaurants and shops surrounding the area. The Wallace Museum is down the street as well as Oxford street,

There is a small room that display Churchill items that can be purchased. The bar is a lovely room and so is the restaurant. 

Thank you for another great stay at the Hyatt Churchill Hotel!",5,2019,11,04
150,Service and customer satisfaction is their last priority ,"This hotel is extremely snobbish with bad service and dated small rooms. The only thing good is their location and they know this so they use this to their advantage. I am definitely not staying here again, its frankly not worth the frustration of having to fight with reception and club lounge staff every day. 1) The hotel refused to give me a suite upgrade even though they had suites available. I even called the world of hyatt supervisor and they stepped in and said yes they can do the upgrade for me but then the hotel over-rode head office and said NO. 2) then I told the hotel I will use points for my suite upgrade and then they said because u are using Corp rate, you have to pay the difference with the rack rate first. I was like WTF, the reason we have Corp rate is because our company spends a lot with Hyatt each year already. Corp rate is no different from bulk buying. Does Hyatt want guaranteed business in size or just random customers coming in and paying the rack rate? Frankly, no one pays rack rate for their hotels just as very few people buy Y class air tickets but they can still use their upgrade certificate on discounted fares 3) Club floor said on multiple occasions they would get back to me of my upgrade via email but it never happened until I had to chase each time. 4) There is a sign in the regency club lounge saying food and drinks can’t leave the room. Really, we are now going to now count pennies and dimes with ur globalist members? Getting a few bottles of water to the room is pretty normal. ",2,2019,10,30
150,Family Birthday celebration,"Very helpful and friendly staff. Good service in the Club lounge. Good food for both adults and children in the Montague restaurant and good service. 
Very disappointed in the Italien restaurant ..... So will not recommend that.",5,2019,10,30
150,London,"The stay in this hotel was very pleasant, we were satisfied with all aspects of service. Hotel is very charming and you can feel British spirit. It is very close to Oxford street and we bearly used public transportation because we could walk evrywhere",5,2019,10,29
150,Wonderful 5-day business stay,"I stayed at this hotel, as it was the location of a training session I attended. The location was wonderful—in a very quiet neighborhood, yet close enough to Hyde Park that I was able to take a nice long walk and do a little shopping. The room was very tastefully decorated (not too ""corporate"" or institutional...a bit more on the boutique side) and I felt quite comfortable all week. The staff was extremely gracious and the food was very good (both in the restaurant and from room service).",5,2019,10,26
150,Wonderful hotel with great Staff,"We recently stayed here for 4 nights as part of a Europe vacation.  The hotel itself if gorgeous, and centrally located to lots of great sights.  Jacopo at the front desk checked us in and out and was personable and professional.  Matt at the Churchill Bar was without a doubt one of the best employees I've had the pleasure of interacting with.  You could tell he genuinely cared about his job and the experience of every guest who walked in to his bar.  We got drinks there on our first night but came back for dinner a few nights later.  Matt was there both nights and took incredible care of us, even when on the second night some of his associates didnt.  It  seemed he was running the bar himself and killing it! He deserves every praise and a raise while you're at it.",5,2019,10,23
150,Well Located,"A conveniently located West End hotel, within walking distance of Hyde Park, together with dining and shopping options nearby. Clean, reasonably sized rooms. Courteous, efficient service. A good hotel within the £300+ per night range.",4,2019,10,22
150,excellent hotel with friendly staff,"expected tooth brush and paste, razor blade and sewing small kit to be in the room. I they used to be but do not find them for last few stays at the hotel. thanks , I enjoy having a meal at the lobby . The idea of the shared seats at the lobby is not practical ,say you are 2 persons sitting on a sofa and a chair .when 2 other persons come and share with you the sofa ,both of you will have no privacy.Separate chairs are better.",5,2019,10,22
150,Brilliant as Always,Thanks for the upgrade to a Regency suite for a single night stay. Great room and friendly staff. Always a pleasure at Portman Square. Easy and secure checkin in a fabulous location in London where everything is in easy reach. ,5,2019,10,17
150,Truly superb!,This hotel is the best! It is a must stay if you are in London. The staff truly makes the experience wonderful! There are not enough compliments that I can pay this hotel and the staff! They made my stay so lovely! You must stay here!,5,2019,10,16
150,Comfort & convenience,"Our recent six night stay at the Churchill was most enjoyable.  The room was larger than normal, bedding and towels first rate, bath well appointed and exceptionally clean.  The Churchill is an easy walk to the Bond Street or Marble Arch tube stations.  Very nice area with Portman Square directly across from the entrance.  Staff were first rate and never failed to offer a friendly greeting when encountered.  Numerous dining options within a few blocks including several neighborhood gems.  Close to Selfridges and M&S.  ",5,2019,10,15
150,Not at level of the standard,"Room ok . Far from being new but at least clean ... personal is useless helpful - could not sort out keys not working and had to go down 3 times for getting my jacket ..... a joke .... 
I took me almost 20mn to just pick it up ..... personal just did not care apart saying the famous - sorry about that ...... ",1,2019,10,13
150,Review of Hyatt,"Hotel is good , very nice location , rooms are average sized but not bad, Breakfast is nothing great we expect more variety from Hyatt, Value for money not so great , we paid 500 pounds per nioght which was too much.",4,2019,10,09
150,Wonderful across the board!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Churchill for 9 days. We were immensely pleased with everything. I’ll start with the room . We had a nice king bed room with chairs , a table a decent tv and two closets. One was primarily for clothes you would hang and the other had the safe, a shelf and 4 drawers. The bathroom had a wonderful heated seat/ bidet combination that was quite lovely! The shower had a hand held and a rain shower head.
There was construction right across from our room and we heard absolutely nothing!! I can honestly say it’s one of the quietest hotels I have had the pleasure to stay at.
As for the guest services, the restaurant had an a la carte and buffet breakfast choice and the food was all very good. You can get tea of coffee there all day and they serve lunch and dinner as well. Although we did not partake in that. 
There is an additional bar that serves wonderful and unique cocktails and you can order good as well. The bartenders were very skilled and extremely friendly. 
As a matter of fact, the entire staff was exceedingly nice and it made our stay one we truly enjoyed.
 I do need to particularly point out that I had an issue where my phone had fallen out of my pocket in a taxi. Needless to say I was devastated! The concierges, Akram in particular, and security went way out of their way with suggestions , trying to help. They even checked security footage and got the license plate of that particular taxi!
To make a very long story short, the phone was recovered, thanks to a kind driver who brought it back to me!!! 
I have to say that this hotel is just wonderful!!!",5,2019,10,09
150,A farewell to remember,"We dropped our daughter off to University and were staying in the Churchill. Peter and his team were amazing. They were so kind with my family, knowing this was a special occasion and I cannot thank them enough. Its so rare a hotel gets it perfect and these guys did for us.",5,2019,10,08
150,Classy Digs in Marylebone,"After the long trip across the pond, how lovely to be greeted into an opulent lobby by an attentive doorman and friendly receptionist (all while being watched over by this great portrait of Winny himself).  We booked our room for the day before so we could get some sleep upon our early arrival and, even though the room was not ready due to a housekeeping glitch, I still give this beautiful hotel 5 stars because of the way they handled the problem - we were whisked away to the Concierge Lounge where they serve a full breakfast, and our room was ready within 30 minutes.  This hotel is in a lovely residential area, and is just a short walk to world class shopping and Michelin starred restaurants; highly recommended for a visit to London.",5,2019,10,07
150,Perfect and wonderful hotel to stay,"Very clean. The staff very helpful , close to marble arch station , excellent location 
The food was excellent either in breakfast restaurant or room service
Will be recommend it to my friends  
Thank you  ",1,2019,10,05
150,Beautiful hotel. Room was not satisfactory as i was with a baby,Perfecty located. Beautiful property. Room was not good for staying with baby and stroller. Too small. No closet just open shelves near the bed and the television. Bathroom had no place at all to put personal things i needed for the baby. Staff was not helpful for request to late checkout,3,2019,10,05
150,I hop you can have more professional staff at the restaurant,I can’t say all pad but if there is one that’s mean to us all are not good but as I see all are good but there is one manager at the restaurant he is so unprofessional and I hop you understand the level of the quality and how to speaks with the gust so that I hop you follow up ,1,2019,10,04
150,Exceptional Housekeeping Service,"My wife and I had a very enjoyable stay at The Hyatt Churchill, from September 21st to 25th, 2019. All amenities and services were excellent, and the location was ideal.

What we found particularly outstanding was the housekeeping service. While the standard of daily upkeep was indeed very good, we felt exceptionally well cared for by the gentleman in charge of our room (room 517) Mr. Aziz. He went the extra mile in his attention to detail, and in ensuring that all our requests were quickly fulfilled.

Mr. Aziz was instrumental in ensuring that we will be making The Hyatt Churchill our go-to hotel for future visits to London.",5,2019,10,03
150,The Churchill - home away from home,"Excellent location and very friendly and helpful staffs. When in London, Hyatt Churchill is my preferred home. It is very conveniently located near Oxford St and Marble Arch station. Be it business or leisure, The Churchill has never disappoint me. ",5,2019,10,03
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill,"I have been staying here for last 5 years and I think this place is best if you want to stay in Central London, a little heavy on the pocket but worth it. Waris was very helpful in making sure that I check-in properly and I think he is an asset to the property. Overall good experience. ",5,2019,10,02
150,European vacation with final stop London,This hotel is first class and was the best stop on our entire trip during a month excursion.  Wish we could have stayed longer.  Plan to go back when in London.  It is centrally located to shopping and excellent for walking as well as for tours and restaurants.  ,5,2019,10,01
150,Room of a second home,"Dear Guest
if you are coming for the very first time, when you checkin in the hotel, Ask from house keeping what is free, before ordering at room service. i had to pay for water at room service while it was served for free by house keeping.",3,2019,09,30
150,Good stay as always.,The stay was very pleasant as always. Would love to come back all times. Excellent service and very good location. My favorite hotel. The staff is very courteous and accommodating. No complaints at all. ,5,2019,09,28
150,Incredibly remarkable hotel,"I had a remarkable stay at the Hyatt Regency in London! Absolutely fantastic. Most importantly, the shower was phenomenal. The bathroom had a built-in overhead shower with great pressure and full body coverage. The water was hot and the shampoo/conditioner worked well. And there were full body-length towels! I have rarely seen those anymore with most hotels pushing towards energy efficiency and water usage reduction, but I sure did appreciate the ability to wrap my entire body in a luxuriously soft large towel.

Most remarkably, during my entire 6 night stay, I only saw the front desk staff once at check-in (as it should be!). The last time I was in London staying in a different hotel, I was at the front desk almost every day with some sort of issue.

I was nervous about the location being so central in London that the rooms would be loud, but my room faced a courtyard and it was a very quiet at night. I had great sleep during my stay. Next time I'm in London, I will definitely stay here again!",5,2019,09,27
150,Beautiful hotel ,"This beautiful hotel is located in a great location very close to Oxford St and Marble Arch. All staff are amazing,professional, friendly, accommodating and made our stay in London a great experience. They were also efficient in delivering on any request made. The cocktails at the Churchill bar were amazing! I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,09,26
150,The Churchill defines '5 Star Hotel',"The Churchill combines modern comfortable surroundings with old world 5 star service. Whether it's the concierge, bar staff, or housekeeping, their response is courteous and polite. The bedrooms have everything you need for a short stay, and I have to say that the beds were the most comfortable I have every experienced in a hotel - I would like to know the make and model of the bed/mattress and would buy on for my home. The bathrooms are well appointed, if a little on the small side, but not to the point of it being a problem. ",5,2019,09,24
150,Great Service,Our fourth stay at this hotel.  Feels like home.  Great service and one of the most comfortable beds anywhere.  It's really hard to imagine stayng aywhere else when visiting London partly because of the lcoation close to Oxford Street and Marble Arch Tube.  ,5,2019,09,22
150,"best location, amazing service and expirience","we have bounced all over London until we found this hotel. its big for Europe, always clean, love the remodel because you have plenty of plugs for your gadgets. we go to shop and are just around the corner from some amazing shopping. there service from everyone is amazing. food and tea in the Montague are also outstanding. ",5,2019,09,20
150,Great hotel and service,"Excellent service in every department. Staff was very helpful. Location is good for shopping, and most sights are a short cab ride away. This was my first time staying here, and I will be back. The only down size is the rooms are on the small side.",5,2019,09,17
150,Aging showers,"I had a bad experience with the shower and drain in my room, and the staff seemingly couldn’t care less. At checkout no apology or anything. The shower faucet had fallen into the tub!  On top of that the drain was so clogged both days with I have no idea what that the water was almost to the top in a 5 min shower.  Not a good way to get clean. ",4,2019,09,16
150,Excellent staff,"Our recent stay at the hotel was made all the better by the excellent service from all of the hotel staff that we came in contact with. We chose the hotel as it’s location suited our needs, but our overall experience would make the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill our first choice on a return to London. Special mention to Paul who looked after our check in and was most sympathetic to an unfortunate travel incident that we had on our journey.",5,2019,09,15
150,Wouldn't stay here again,"We wouldn't choose the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill again.  The check-in experience was cold, unpleasant, and pretty much set the negative tone for our entire stay. We were not offered any room upgrades, despite the fact that there are many rooms available on the hotel website during our 2-night stay. We were not offered any late check-out either.  It would be nice if Solhy (the check-in person) spare a small welcoming smile or even thank us for being Globalist members.  If I were the manager of the hotel, I wouldn't assign him to greet incoming guests.
Overall, I would recommend better services and customer interaction by the people who work at the club lounge level.  When we left with our luggage, we were waiting for a few minutes at the elevator.  Neither people sitting at the desk looked up to say hello or goodbye.  They just simply ignored us and kept looking at their computer screen.  Who would want to return?? 
I also want to add that the people who worked in the club lounge were friendly. However, they seem not to know the answers to simply questions such as ""do you have any salt and pepper?"" ",2,2019,09,15
150,3 Night Stay @ Hyatt - The Churchill,Another great stay at the Hyatt - The Churchill.  Special mention goes out to the wonderful staff at the restaurant seving breakfast.  They were very attentive and friendly despite how busy the restaurant was for breakfast.  Food selection and quality was also very good.  ,4,2019,09,14
150,Great location and thats is all,"Great location but unfortunately I cannot say anything nice beyond that. I was given a room overlooking a wall with poor lighting.  Bathroom amenities, at best, are minimal. The staff in the ground floor restaurant pretty much ignored me after seating me for breakfast This happened every day I stayed there. I had to get their attention to serve me coffee or water. I ended up going out for my coffee since the room did not have a coffee machine, They did have instant coffee but I expected better. Not likely to stay there again. ",2,2019,09,14
150,We' ll be backk!,"We were on the top floor - looking down into the courtyard. Not a big room but very comfortable and stylish, and remarkably quiet despite the fact that the bar area downstairs was heaving on a Friday night. Extremely helpful front desk, quite good food (Soho-house style) and really friendly staff. Marcel is a real asset to the Hsk team and to Hyatt The Churchill in general. Our friends stayed in the room opposite on the second night - considerably bigger. I'd ask for a room on this side next time. Would recommend the Hyatt to anyone - excellent value if you book well in advance.",5,2019,09,14
150,Family Weekend,"This year we choose the Regency Suite King and it was perfect !!
Very comfortable, enough room and well equipped with extra services.
Also the breakfast at the club is much improved vs last year.
Service is always very good.",5,2019,09,11
150,vey comfortable beds,"I think this hotels has one of the most comfortable beds that i have ever slept in. Very good location. Spacious rooms if you book an upper category, i don't know about the standart rooms though. Very friendly staff .",5,2019,09,09

150,GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY in LONDON,"picked this hotel over some more expensive ones with the hope of getting an upgrade as globalist which did happen.  rooms are a bit tired but overall the place is still holding up, the bar is a classic.  gym could use an upgrade but it was adequate.  service friendly and professional",4,2019,09,08
150,Amazing guest service!,Lighthning fast check-in and -out process. Very attentive staff. Well appointed rooms and all the amenities one can wisch for. Have been staying at this Hotel for yours and truly outstanding. Keep up the amazing work!,5,2019,09,08
150,So So but the Churchill Bar and the Locatelli are exceptional,"So So but the Churchill Bar and the Locatelli are exceptional.  Other than these two businesses, I would not recommend this hotel.  For our 1 week stay, only 2/3 elevators were functioning.  This caused serious delay's getting up to your room after a hard days work.",3,2019,09,08
150,My Sunday Brunch experience.,"For several years now I have been going with friends for Sunday Brunch . On our most recent visit I noticed changes to the way it was served. The buffet starters are very good but the main course used to be self service, so you chose what you wanted. Now you choose off a limited menu and the portions are very small. I had sea bass which was one very small piece and hardly any vegetables. . The deserts that follow are hardly worth mentioning and the cheese and biscuits that used to follow are very limited and no grapes as used to be. Even the champagne glasses are smaller so you have to drink quickly to get value for money. I do hope things improve as I’m going back at Xmas for a girls get together .",3,2019,09,04
150,Nice Hotel,I loved it. It was so nice. the rooms so clean and nice and staff was amazing. Marcel is a real asset to the Hsk team and to Hyatt The Churchill in general. i will definitely stay again when i will have a chance!,5,2019,09,04
150,A superb hotel,"Everything about the Hyatt Regency London was superb--the professionalism and courteousness of the very international staff, the room furnishings and size (we stayed in a Regency suite), the top quality food items and ambiance in the Regency club, and the excellent location.",5,2019,09,03
150,"Safe, convenient location - room up to Hyatt's highest standards","The location was in a safe and convenient location.  We booked a standard room for a short two day stay.  Room had most comfortable beds, desk working area, place for luggage, amble closet, safe and soft chair.  In room tea and coffee.   The bathroom had a high tub, kept water from floor but a little hard to get into.  The toilet included a bidet, a perk not found in many hotels.  Friendly, helpful staff.",5,2019,09,02
150,Business trip,"Great location inside the heart of London. Club lounge was great. Impressive amenities in the rooms with great views. Staff were friendly included the doorman, Garfield to be precise. Overall excellent choice",5,2019,08,30
150,Lovely suite,"We booked a balcony suite for two nights as a special treat and the room, 946, was gorgeous. Neutral and light decor with dual aspects as it went the full width of the hotel. The balcony overlooking Portman Square was large enough to have a table and chairs and great views. There was a large bedroom with views the other way, a bathroom with a decent shower over the bath, a second WC and a large living room with a sofa, soft chair, desk, fridge-style minibar, kettle and mugs. There were lots of Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom.
The WiFi was free and fast enough but there were charging points only on one side of the enormous bed. 
Club Lounge access came with the room. The Lounges got busy at times but offered a good buffet in the evening and an excellent breakfast. Service was also very good.
One of the three lifts broke down during our stay which made getting around slow as there didn’t appear to be stairs from our floor, 9, to the Lounge on 8.
The location is perfect, behind Oxford Street but on a quiet square.  There is a club opposite which played loud music both nights, but our bedroom was at the back, so unaffected, although you could hear it in our lounge.",4,2019,08,27
150,Mediocre on its good days,"First visit July 2019.  The Hyatt Churchill feels absolutely cavernous.  Despite this, only two of the three lifts was in service causing lengthy waits and crowded, hot elevators.  The room was OK, nothing special about it at all, and the bathroom rather small.  The cursed duvet was a disaster for temperature control when sleeping, as always.  The rude, self absorbed clientele obviated the entire point of escaping Mayfair where such boorish behavior prevails.  Noise from the room next door was abundant at 2am on a Tuesday night...  The staff, happily, was uniformly good.  Not really recommended.",3,2019,08,27
150,Very Nice Hotel,"Our family of 3 stayed at the Churchill for a very reasonable cost. We had difficulty even finding a hotel that would allow 3 in a room. We arrived before the check in time, but the staff was very helpful and let us know that they would text us when our room was ready. By the time we finished a couple cups of coffee in the lounge area our room was ready. We were on the club level, which had a very nice breakfast. The room was an average size, with a smallish but fully equipped bathroom with tub. All the amenities worked properly, there were plenty of power outlets for charging all of our mobile devices, and the room was quiet despite being near the busy club level lounge.",5,2019,08,20
150,A historic landmark,"A beautiful and invited lobby welcomes the guest with grandeur. Although the hotel is big, you still get the help of an attentive and efficient staff at all times. Placed in the heart of busy London, at proximity of bustling Oxford Street, The Churchill offers you an oasis of luxurious comfort.",4,2019,08,14
150,Robison family from California,"Would highly recommend. Many Islamic people completely covered in burka’s exposing skits for eyes. Do not feel threatened they are safe and enjoying their free time. 

I will definitely be returning to the Hyatt. Safe with central location. Bidet’s in every room. ",1,2019,08,13
150,Needs A Facelift ,"While the location is great and the lobby is okay, the halls and rooms need a major facelift. Room smells moldy and bathroom is filthy (hair and dirt in tub). We are Hyatt Passport members and so it’s disappointing when you try to be loyal to the brand but the hotels are not up to par.",1,2019,08,13
150,Beautiful hotel; excellent location,"Lovely hotel in the Westminster section of London, (West London).  2 excellent restauants.  In a great walking neighborhood close to Hyde Park and the Oxford street shopping district.  The service was spectaular.",5,2019,08,07
150,"Great location, high standards","The hotel has very high standards - can be seen in quality of rooms, food and service.  I had to ask for some medical equipment advice and on three occasions three different staff at the concierge did a lot of digging and research to help me. 

Didn’t try the bar but seems like a must do. 

There seemed to be many regulars there as well, some on first name basis with staff ",5,2019,08,07
150,Extremely comfortable stay with excellent staff and great rooms,"I can't rave enough about what a wonderful hotel this is. It was my first time staying in this hotel.  The location is extremely good close to Hyde Park and Marble Arch.  Very convenient to shopping, Tube, bus lines, etc.   

I'm a Globalist and stay in Hyatt rooms over 70 nights each year and this was one of the best stays.   Upon check-in the agent downstairs personally escorted me up to the 6th floor where they have special check-in for Globalists.   The gentleman helping me.  I forget his name but I believe it was Mr. Sullah (spelling?).  He was very pleasant and throughout the stay he greeted me by my name every time he saw me.

We had a room on the 6th floor and we had a connecting room which was spacious.  Both rooms were great facing the park in front of the hotel.  The room was quiet.  My Globalist benefit included being able to use the Club Lounge on the 8th floor.   It had a nice breakfast and every night from 5 PM to 7 PM a nice spread.  The staff in the Club Lounge was always so friendly.  

The beds were so comfortable.  We had a King bed in each room and they set up a twin bed in one of the rooms.  We had 3 young children with us and having the connecting room was very comfortable.

We ordered room service a few nights for the kids and the food was very good. I imagine it was from the restaurant below.  The restaurant off the lobby was very good. The food was good and the service excellent.  The hotel was absolutely packed during our stay.   I believe if you're not Globalist or staying in a Club room you can pay £125 per day and enter.   That might sound like a lot but they had many drinks including alcohol in them.   If you have several kids you can probably come out ahead if you come for breakfast and at the end of the day.

They had a Club Lounge for adults only and one for family with kids.  I can't recommend this hotel enough.   One of my best stays in London in coming here many years.   You can use the Citymapper App and easily find the best buses to take. It was very convenient and beats taking the Tube.

Great shopping on Oxford Street and Selfridges mall is right around the corner.  Tons of buses to all of the attractions to London is very quick and easy.   Now it's very convenient that you don't have to even buy an Oyster card if you have a Contactless credit card.

I will definitely stay here on my next trip to London.",5,2019,08,06
150,Beautiful location,"We recently stayed one night in London at the Churchill. Beautiful location, a quiet spot in a busy city. Yet you felt close to all activities, shopping an dining.  Room was very clean and comfortable. All employees we talked with were helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,03
150,nice,"very clean hotel and good room space near by the attractions , friendly staff.

The Churchill always been my choice for my London visits and, Hyatt Regency the Churchill is part of my habits and tradition , i dont think that can be changed.",4,2019,07,30
150,Big bed!,"We were three people family so I ordered extra bed and it was really comfortable like a real bed. And the size of the main bed is bigger than king size, we loved it so much. We also applied for club access which really worth it since we can get quick breakfast there and we even got light meal as dinner after all the walking and shopping. ",4,2019,07,30
150,Right place,Better than any other Hyatt property i have ever visited. People and service was excellent. Great location. Speedy check in.  We had a minor complication on the first night.  It was taken care off immediately and offered a nights stay. Really central to London without crowds and traffic ,5,2019,07,28
150,STAY AWAY NOT 5 stars,"I booked online and requested early check in. I knew I would be arriving around 2pm and 3pm is usual check in time. Fredrica was the front desk agent I dealt with. They informed me I would be upgraded to a room with a view and the room would be ready at 3pm. So I waited in the lobby since there weren’t any available rooms that I could check in to. Okay fine. 3PM rolls by and they inform me I would have to wait another 30-40 minutes. I was furious at this point, there is absolutely no way I would wait beyond regular check in time. Another lady looked in the system and gave me a room that was available however I have no idea if that’s the type of room I was supposed to even get. 

We were assigned room 739, the drain in tub is terrible. It was constantly flooded. The safe was broken, however, we didn’t even bother calling to get it fixed. I didn’t want to wait and deal with it while I can be out enjoying London. One of the elevators were down and there was over crowding. Worst experience ever. Take your money and book elsewhere. This Hyatt should be ashamed to claim they’re a 4 or 5 star hotel. It’s more like a 3.",1,2019,07,27
150,Great Stay at Hyatt Regency London The Churchill,Great staff and amazing hotel; one of the few hotel in that matches the quality of their counterpart hotels in Asia (not all Hyatt hotels in Europe/UK are great unfortunately); and a very good location too!,5,2019,07,23
150,Excellent,We went to the Hyatt for afternoon tea and had a very enjoyable time. The food was excellent with a large selection of teas to choose from and we were in no way hurried. We spend three hours in their restaurant and the tables were well spaced out so you could talk without the next table hearing your conversation.. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Highly recommended.,4,2019,07,20
150,Mid Range Hyatt,"Third time was not a charm at the Churchill.  As a Hyatt Globalist, I’ve seen many Hyatt’s including this one.  It’s gone down hill some.  First, only one of three elevators was working at times.  Second, I reached out in advance re: early check-in but is was not arranged.  I know early checkin can be challenging, but it seemed to take quite a while to find a room for us.  We ended up without an upgrade into a rather small room.  I guess it’s just luck, but it wasn’t good this time.  Room was adequate but dated.  Toiletries nothing special.  Average amenities.  Welcome gift was a small bottle of cheap wine.  

Lounge buffet breakfast is okay, but nothing special.  Hotel still has a great location, and is clean.  Service is decent, although the front desk and concierge always seem busy.  Taxi service is good from the hotel.  I’d stay here again, but just lower my expectations some - it’s not anywhere close to a Park Hyatt or an Andaz.  A solid 3 out of 5 rating.",3,2019,07,18
150,"Oh Dear, not to the Hyatt standard","I'm a lifetime globalist and booked the Hyatt Regency Churchill for a 2 day visit to London with my son. We stayed in a Regency Balcony Suite. The suite was the worst I have ever experienced at a Hyatt. No cushions on the sofa. No artwork on the walls. The decor was worn out, bordering on dirty. Nothing like the photos on the website. Furthermore, at 4pm the room was not prepared properly (no welcome amenities) and there was a misunderstanding over complimentary parking for lifetime globalists (I now have to pay an additional 40 pounds per day). So not a great first impression. I've asked to speak with the Duty Manager but have not heard from him at the time of writing.",1,2019,07,17
150,It used to be better,"I always found the Churchill one of the most consistent  places to stay in terms of “you know what you get “. I must admit though that my 2 last visits were not as good as before. Attention to detail dropped, evening dressing down stopped, you feel the fact that they try to save money which is not a good feeling when you pay the price of a luxury hotel",3,2019,07,17
150,Lovely Hotel,"Had a lovely weekend stay at the Churchill which continued to provide it's usual excellent service and quality.  Room was very comfortable and quiet and overlooked the leafy square which was an added bonus.  Very varied breakfast to cater for all requirements, ideal location for the London sites.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful, all in all a very enjoyable couple of days.",5,2019,07,16
150,Broken elevators ,"I rarely post such negative reviews for a five star hotel but several negative experiences have culminated to this review. We stayed for 5 days 4 nights. We tried to check in around 2 pm on a Friday. No rooms were available and we waited until 3:30 pm. Still no rooms available. Standard check in time should be 3 pm. It was only until I complained to the front desk that they finally gave me a room!

Next few days the elevators were broken. At one point all three of the elevators were broken and people had to go on the freight elevator. 

Another day, they didn’t even bother cleaning our room and there was a fire drill that almost woke up our sleeping baby.

For $800/night, we did not even receive the standard service of a three star hotel.",1,2019,07,15
150,Poor experience at Hyatt Churchill,"I was very disappointed in my stay at this particular Hyatt. One of the elevators was down the entire duration of my stay (9 days). This resulted in very long waits for the elevator and severe overcrowding during popular times. Also, they have no convenient stair access, so even though I was on the 2nd floor, I was forced to always use the elevator.

Second, there were multiple days that housekeeping did not even bother to show up to my room to tidy up, despite me never using a privacy sign and me always being out of the room by 7am every day.

Last, the most frustrating part, the housekeeping lost one of my possessions that I left on the bed. The hotel refused any responsibility and told me there is no proof and to call the police if I am not satisfied with their findings.

Hyatt has just lost a dedicated Rewards member. I will certainly take my business elsewhere for all future travels.",1,2019,07,15
150,"Overpriced, poor service","Had high hopes, given the location (close to Marble Arch), the Hyatt brand and the “Churchill” affiliation, but oh dear what a disgrace.  

As Globalist customers, we can say with confidence this property is a brand anomaly.   After queuing for 20 mins to check in, standing amongst only 2 other customers but 12(!) black dressed employees that do nothing.  We were told we could have checked in on the 8th floor but glad we didn’t try for reasons I’ll get to.   Our young receptionist was seemingly incapable of doing much but running off to consult with a supervisor in the back room...  Once dispatched from reception, we herded to the single working lift ( 2 of 3 out of service) and waited at least 15 mins to pack in like animals with our luggage to finally get to our room, which was wonderfully decorated with flowers and card to welcome a different couple(!).  

Our keys stopped working three times during a 48 hour stay.  

The lounge was overrun by huge families with badly behaved children - breakfast was an ordeal.   The poor single attendant struggling to keep order.

Given the 8th floor transitions and the lift situation, it meant stairs were needed to be used to keep sane...the great back of house experience of dirty unclean stairwells with bare concrete stairs reminiscent of bad secondary schools rather than a Hyatt charging > 500 a night!!  The stairs naturally dump you in the 2nd class citizen area with the smokers where you have to dodge the valet drivers running you over.   

With less than 50% of the lifts in use, the visiting reception to re-enable key nonsense was a horrible 30 min ordeal..the receptionist kindly told me we could call and they would run up with new keys - she looked bewildered when I asked how we would do that if we couldn’t open the room to use the phone?!

On no less than 3 occasions did a black dressed person in the lobby welcome us back and hoped we were enjoying our stay...even when we quipped ‘not really’, no-one even blinked.  

I feel strongly that firing a couple of them, saving the salaries and using the budget for a lift maintenance contract would be better hotel operations.

The room was modernized and not at all bad except the usability of the bathroom, that was frankly smaller than an aircraft toilet, but well decorated nonetheless. 

Thankfully the location of the hotel meant it was easy to stay outside of it for 12 hours at a time.  Marble Arch is super close.

Hyatt should be embarrassed.   We thought we could feel Churchill spinning in his grave but that was just the thunder of kids running up the halls.

We will not return...too many nice hotels in London to repeat this nonsense.

",1,2019,07,15
150,Small room high prices,The staff is absolutely fabulous. Checkin took a long time. Elevators where not working. Room is extremely small and not top clean (bathroom). No coffee machine in the room. The hotel is located in a nice area. ,3,2019,07,14
150,Churchill Hyatt,Great location; easy access to the Tube and walking distance to Hyde Park. If you’re shopping Oxford Street is your street and it is a 1 minute walk from the hotel. Nice rooms and good breakfast!  Edward Road is around the corner where you will find middle eastern food 24/7.,5,2019,07,14
150,Special place for a cigar,Great place to have a cigar. Very nice selection of expensive cigars. They have a 40 pound minimum spend per person but you can smoke your own cigar and just get a few of their great cocktails and it is covered. A nice patio that is very cigar friendly. They seem to put out reserved signs randomly to allow them to decide who can sit where. This allows them to ensure regulars or cigar smokers get preference on the patio. A pleasant experience that I will repeat.,4,2019,07,13
150,beautiful hotel,We had a lovely time at this well appointed excellently situated hotel. The concierge staff were extremely helpful in accessing tickets and reservations to suit the needs of our large family group. With their help we go to see sold out exhibits and sporting events.,5,2019,07,11
150,An oasis in central London,"The classic elegance of The Churchill and the welcoming staff, combine to make this our favorite hotel in London. We are welcomed back so warmly that it feels like coming home. The peaceful ambience makes a wonderful contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city outside the front doors.",5,2019,07,07
150,Great Hotel in London,"The Hyatt - The Churchill is a very nice hotel where you can based yourself when exploring London.  Nice location near Marble Arch / Hyde Park. That is a great positive for me since I am a runner.  Tube station is a short 5 minute walk from the hotel. The staff is very friendly, the room are nice, the internet is fast and good food. Totally recommended.  It can be pricey, especially during high season.",5,2019,07,06
150,Great London Option,"Just returned from a stay at The Churchill with my husband and 2 adult sons. The hotel is in a great location, and has lovely rooms and terrific service. We found the breakfast in The Regency Club to be fresh and varied, and really appreciated the overflow room for those of us that want a bit more quiet. Though our room was on the small side (to be expected in a city like London), it was beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. The lobby restaurant was outstanding. All in all an excellent choice and a well run hotel. ",5,2019,07,05
150,Exceptional Stay,"A very enjoyable stay. Well organized staff, and very efficient operation. The breakfast buffet was varied and well presented. The hotel location was very close to the tube and taxi’s were always available at the front entrance. I would recommend!",5,2019,07,05
150,good location small room,small room no desk and chair however great location and nice breakfast menu.  the bathroom though small was quite good with a heated toilet seat and great rain shower. the special reading light is a welcome addition that i loved ,3,2019,07,02
150,Exceptional Experience!!!,"We recently stayed here, and had a truly exceptional experience!  The hotel is in a perfect location with wonderful amenities, and is well appointed.  The staff are truly exceptional, and provided us with such a wonderful experience, making our trip to London incredibly memorable, and an experience we won't forget.

In particular, Mr. Schauder, and his team (especially Maria), are exceptional, and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit!",5,2019,06,29
150,Great hotel in excellent location.,This is the second time we've stayed here and it reinforced our positive view of the hotel.  Excellent location. Staff welcoming and helpful. Room was spotless.  Bed large and super comfortable. Extensive breakfast in the Regency Club.,5,2019,06,28
150,Wonderful as always,"Typical Hyatt Regency, wonderful staff, brilliant bed and comfy pillows and always a warm welcome.
Spotlessly clean and a great location,
Used my points and unlike some other hotels was treated as if I were a paying guest",5,2019,06,27
150,"Great hotel, most comfortable and in a very good location.","A very pleasant stay. Very friendly and helpful staff. They took care of parking our car at a very reasonable cost for Central London. The hotel has an excellent and vibrant bar, very useful as the London pubs closed soon after the show we had gone to see ended. Looking forward to going back again.  ",5,2019,06,26
150,Service should not be this hard. ,"This was probably our worst stay at a Hyatt worldwide and we have stayed at quite a few. For starters I was there for over two weeks due to work. Had my Husband and Son visit for a few days on the front end and a day at the end. Was charge a fee of £80 a night for a rollaway! £80?!?! I asked the front desk if there was any adjustment that could be done as I was staying for two weeks and spending a good amount of money. Not looking for free, but something reasonable. I was called later in the room and told no adjustment would be made. 
Then we asked if we could store 3 bags while we went to Paris for 2 nights. Was told no as we were not checking back in, though we had stayed for 2 weeks? Would have been ok if we went in the middle of our stay?? Literally had to argue with him to hold them for us, really? At a five star hotel? I could go on. Towel smelled like paint or turpentine, no idea why?? 
The only good thing was the breakfast food and the crew. They were great. Don’t think we will be back. ",1,2019,06,25
150,Very Nice Stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill,"After arriving after an overnight flight, I was hopeful that I could be allowed to check in early.I was not disappointed as I was allowed to without even asking. The gentleman at the reception must have recognized that I was struggling. The hotel is well situated, close to Oxford Street with its many cafes and stores. It's an easy-ish walk (with wheeled luggage) from Paddington Station, but it's about 0.9 miles. Just pace yourself. The hotel is lovely, but some of the basic guest room walls and furniture could use some updating/refreshing. This is just a minor observation and not a complaint. My room and bathroom were immaculate. Check out was a breeze.",5,2019,06,25
150,Traditional. Too Traditional. ,"There is nothing wrong with this hotel. Stylistically, though, it is pretty bland for such a dynamic city. It’s very traditional, that’s its thing, and it may be yours too. For me, I’d rather spend the same money to stay somewhere more imaginative in architecture or decor. The club room breakfast was very nice with standard breakfast fare. Excellent staff and service. ",4,2019,06,24
150,Very attentive staff,The people who work here are great - very attentive and caring - and they keep the hotel immaculate.  It's also in a great location in a quiet area that's only two blocks from Oxford Street shopping and three blocks from an Underground station.  I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,06,23
150,The best London choice in Marylebone.,"Hyatt The Churchill has been my top choice when in London for more than 10 years and it certainly continues to be.
The rooms are always, always exceptionally clean. The Housekeeping are incredible. It has always been and continues to be.
The food is amazing. And I mean it. If you need to eat anytime 24/7 for any reason in the hotel, it will be amazing, from the burger to the caviar. 
As I come here too often and for a long time I have had the opportunity to know some of the staff and every time I arrive, Mohammed certainly is the most welcoming man I have ever met and I must say the experience is outstanding since the beggining just because of him.
The proximity to Oxford st, Selfridge’s, Marble Arch Subway station, Hyde Park and many others makes it the most complete hotel to stay when in London.
Congratulation to the new GM, which I don’t know yet, just knew Mr Gray. I can say the service continues to be incredible. My Regards.",5,2019,06,23
150,"Great location, newly renovated ","I have stayed at the Churchill many times. This time I stayed in room 618, which looks like it was recently renovated. The room is very well laid out, the bathroom has a shower and the room is set up very well for business travel, lots of outlets, USB ports, etc. The breakfast is excellent as is the bar, which also has outdoor seating. Only downside I found was to borrow an iPhone charger from the concierge comes with the threat of a GBP 100 fine if it not returned. I understand the concept but maybe a bit too dramatic. Overall, I love the location and the hotel. ",5,2019,06,22
150,FABULOUS!!!!,"My stay at the hotel was  from June 14th - June 19th 2019.
All my pre-requests at the time of booking were met. Early check in as my flight arrived in the morning , a walk in shower and a late check out. Through out the stay it was pleasant to notice how the staff ( each and every one at all levels) was attentive and very accommodating. 
The service at Breakfast area on lobby level was excellent. the hotel had 100% occupancy and all the staff serving breakfast had great attitude and always with a smile. Lovely to see that early in the morning. All 5 days I had breakfast and I was not bored. Lovely presentation. Close proximity to all the shopping , Marble arch or Bond street tube stations easily accessible.  Kensington palace 30 minutes walk which you do not feel at all. All in all , a fabulous and very satisfying stay.  Thank you Hyatt .",5,2019,06,22
150,Great Restaurant Horrendous Hotel Experience,"My trip began well, fast check in combined with an excellent dinner. Things were good. However, I got 3 hours sleep due to the huge amount of noise both around 2am and later on at 4am - 5am due to a huge argument near my room. I was exhausted and drained for my conference. I wanted to pass on this to the customer service team but there was absolute no interest from them and honestly I just wanted out of there. Simply not worth the money.",2,2019,06,20
150,Nice stay all around.,"This was a great place to stay on points in London. Everything was very good. The room, the service, the location were very nice, but I would not rave about them. This might be a city to not use points for hotel stays, and save them for a more spectacular choice in another city.",4,2019,06,20
150,Fabulous ambiance and service - approaches Park Hyatt level,"Love this hotel! We have stayed here several times when in London. Chu Vo Dam Manager in the Regency Club provides ""over the top"" service! Thanks!

Also thanks for great service to the rooms manager (sorry forgot her name) who helped us get a great room before we checked in.

This is a luxury hotel with fabulous ambiance and service - approaches Park Hyatt level...
Be careful about fragrances - we noticed heavy perfume in hotel and had to switch ",5,2019,06,19
150,Great location but slightly above average for others,Need to pay more attention to the finer details. A housekeeping staff by the name of Andrea kept knocking on the door and before having a chance to answer he had forcef entry a couple of times. It interrupted our rest for a couple of days. ,4,2019,06,18
150,Wonderful stay,"My best stay in London. Close to everything and just off Oxford Street, subway, major tourist spots.Perfect room and all super solicitous, coffee in the wonderful club. For sure returning to London I will choose the Hyatt Regency Churchill.",5,2019,06,17
150,Exceptional in every way,"This hotel is one of the best I’ve stayed in globally. Standard room had the following: Toto toilet with heated seat/bidet features, tea kettle, tub in the remodeled wing (had to ask), both EU and UK outlets, makeup mirror in bath and non-fog mirror on wall, and a window to crack open for fresh air. No conditioner for the hair, sadly.

Quiet with pleasant service, and just a short two block walk to the Marble Arch tube, Hyde Park, and world-class shopping on Oxford and Regent Streets and restaurants. You really can’t go wrong here.",5,2019,06,16
150,A stay at Hyatt,"
Initially we liked almost everything at the hotel and were enjoying ourselves. However after a day or two the number of water glasses started reducing in our room-???  Every day there was one less😑. On calling housekeeping, it was sorted out. 
What really annoyed and insulted me was that one day they emptied out the mini bar. Without my knowledge or consent! On calling room service I was told that it was done because I hadn’t given a credit card number on check in. Yes, I hadn’t, because I had instead deposited 500 GBP in cash for incidentals when I had checked in. 
What utter rubbish!
Not expected from a Hyatt.

150,The Only Place to Stay in Marble Arch Area,"The Hyatt Regency London - Churchill is the only place to stay in the Marble Arch area.  They consistently provide excellent customer service and always ensure your needs are met.  The terrace bar in the hotel is great for relaxing at the end of the night as it stays open later than other establishments.  In addition, the hotel is conveniently located close to the Marble Arch station. ",5,2019,06,13
150,Not proper rooms,"(1) The breakfast items were the same. No variety. 

(2) Rooms are really terrible.

(3) Staff were not helpful especially at the breakfast lounge. 

(4) Value for money, the rooms are not worth, even when upgraded. The WC in room 406 was stuck to wash basin, wherein you can barely sit.

150,"Good location, clean, great staff.","Great location, good food & bar. Close to Oxford street shopping and dining. I had a standard King room, over looking the park.

The breakfast was outstanding and terrific service.",5,2019,06,09
150,Excellent Customer Service,This hotel is in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to many of the sites. I requested a renovated room with a view of the garden and early check-in. When I arrived the hotel had noted my request and was able to grant them. The twin bedroom was spotless and comfortable. My only criticism is that the windows need  a good washing.  ,5,2019,06,09
150,"Excellent Hotel, location and Spacious rooms !","We stayed here for 4 nights in May. It was a very comfortable stay. Location is excellent with about 0.2 miles from train station and bus stop. It is walkable to all the high end shopping on regent and oxford  street. Despite being so close to everything hotel, itself is on a quiet street which is a plus. 
Room was big enough that even with a crib it didn’t feel crowded. Bathroom had rain shower and hand shower which we value a lot. King bed was huge and very comfortable. We had club access which we thoroughly enjoyed. Breakfast options were enough for us for 4 days and we didn’t feel bored. Evening snacks are decent as well with access to free drinks. 
Would highly recommend this hotel if you plan to stay around Marylebone or Mayfair area.",5,2019,06,08
150,Reiterate “must visit” status.,"I have reviewed this property in the past, but feel constrained to reiterate my recommendation as a great, central locale. 
I am a Londoner by birth and recognize the need to be close to diverse forms of transport, shopping, ambiance etc. This property ticks all the boxes, located on Portman Square, close to Selfridges and Oxford St. easy access to Hyde Park, Knightsbridge (Harrods) and Kensington, but also easy reach to museums, St James and art galleries, and the incomparable Cafe Murano!!
The people are wonderful, the Regency Club is excellent and pricing/value for money, far outstrips the Andaz Hyatt brand at Liverpool St. 
Please give it a try and ask for Souly and Daniele to help you through the experience.",5,2019,06,05
150,Nice Hotel in Marylebone,"Overall, my 6-night stay was quiet and pleasant.  I chose this hotel for its amenities, location and because it’s part of a major hotel chain (I tend to lean towards familiar brands when traveling abroad).  I booked a room with Regency Club lounge access because I enjoy the personalized service and wanted the ability to go to a dedicated lounge to write, read and grab refreshments throughout the day.  As a whole, the hotel staff were friendly and attentive.  That being said, there were two interactions with staff members that left me wondering if they’re unaccustomed to African-American patrons.  On one occasion I had a question for the front desk, but the check-in line was long, so I stayed in the foyer looking at the artwork waiting for the line to dispel.  In doing so, a white male staff member followed me into the foyer a few paces.  He didn’t smile or say ‘hello’, nor did he greet me with a ‘Miss’ or ‘Madame’, he just ‘sized me up’ and stared.  I was dressed well and had my room key in hand, so my presence in the foyer shouldn’t have been cause for concern, but apparently, he felt otherwise.  I patiently waited in the foyer until the front desk was available and simply smiled back at him as I passed by.  On another occasion, I was abruptly stopped by a white female staff member before heading into the Regency Club Lounge.  She asked for my room number, wrote it down on her clipboard, then thanked me as I entered the lounge with my room key.  While I’m not surprised she asked for my room, the way she did it could have been more polite (it felt accusatory).  Furthermore, it made me question how consistently the hotel staff asked all patrons for their room numbers when visiting the lounge, because there were plenty of occasions where I was asked for my room, but other patrons who entered the lounge at the same time as me were not.  I didn’t let either of these instances ruin my stay, nevertheless I think it’s important to bring them to someone’s attention, because it’s seemingly mundane interactions like these that hospitality staff need to remain mindful of.  There is a difference between being looked after and being surveilled so I hope management takes my experiences to heart and strive to ensure that all their patrons feel the former and not the latter throughout the entirety of their stay.",4,2019,06,04
150,Great service,"We had a great stay at Hyatt London The Churchill. Check-in was smooth, just as check-out and the rooms were very clean. Housekeeping provided a great service checking our room and replacing whatever was necessary throughout the day.
We had a fantastic afternoon tea, where the waitress was very generous, unfortunately we forgot to ask for her name. Furthermore, the staff (especially Vicky) in the lounge was very attentive during breakfast.",5,2019,06,04
150,Good Option for Marble Arch,"Being the only premium Hyatt option in London, I was incentivesed to stay here from my membership and was to expectations. however, if it wasn't for it, int is still a good option for a weekend commute.",4,2019,06,04
150,"Less than 5"" walk to Marble Arch subway station","The staff is outstanding, they went above and beyond to make sure that I had a comfortable and pleasant stay.  I would absolutely stay here again.  Good location.  Less than 5"" walk to Marble Arch subway station (red line)",5,2019,06,03
150,"Great Location, Horrible Valet Service","We stayed six nights at this property.  Clean rooms, comfortable beds and fantastic location.  However, beware... the valets are terrible and will keep you waiting longer than necessary for a taxi because they are getting kickbacks from their friends.  Room rates are pretty high, so I would have to think very hard before staying here again, despite being a loyal Hyatt customer.",4,2019,06,03
150,Worth It!,TERRIFIC Staff; Great location; Lovely accomodations; Surprising bar; A brand you can count on. There was an intimacy about the property that you don't find at a lot of Hyatt Regencys.  My wife and I highly recommend it!,5,2019,06,02
150,Comfortable and well located felt like home,"Located off Oxford Street within easy walking distance of the Tube and Bus lines we checked into a standard King room with an interior view for a more quiet experience. We had executive privileges and enjoyed breakfast in the private club room each morning. We did not use the fitness center because we didn't have any time! The staff was consistently professional and helpful although the concierge desk was always busy. The room was comfortable and the bed and pillows felt just like home! We requested a Nespresso machine but had to remind the housekeeping staff to keep us stocked. That would be my only recommendation is that the housekeeping staff keep the toiletries and amenities well stocked. They would forget to leave shampoo, conditioner and creamer. The room has a refrigerator so we stocked it with milk, and the room also has a safe. The building is well maintained although the shower did overflow once on me! Overall I loved the location and had a comfortable stay.",5,2019,06,02
150,Elegant,"My mom and I got to the hotel from the airport at 11am, this is after a long flight from Seattle, so we were kinna tired and didn't really felt like going around the city before we check in and take a little nap. Although the check in is not until 3pm, the front desk got us in by noon. Everyone in the staff was very accommodating and very pleasant right when you walk in the door. The food was great, we really enjoyed eating in the hotel instead of eating out. The room was comfortable. Location is good too, walking distance from a lot of shops. We really enjoyed our experience.",5,2019,06,01
150,"Elegant homely comfort, posh locale","I enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Regency.  The room is very clean, and decor is very elegant.  It is located in a quiet posh locale with lots of restaurants of different price points.  Only a 5 minutes walk to Oxford St with a lot of great shops.  Close to many main bus lines as well as the tube.",5,2019,06,01
150,Winston is Turning Over in His Grave,"The Grand Hyatt Churchill London:  Winston is turning in his Grave

Pros:

1.	 Great Location in Marylebone not too far from the major sites and amazing restaurants and bars in a highly residential neighborhood.
2.	Full services offered such as room service, laundry, Wi-Fi and hotel staff are well intentioned and generally efficient but may not speak the best of English.
3.	Rooms have the creature comforts you expect such as upscale bath products (or they look like) and a mini bar.

Cons:

1.	 With the exception of suites, standard rooms are cruise ship sized with teeny tiny bathrooms to match.  It is highly possible and likely that the room you reserve is not the room you will be given at check in. Be aware you might be told “You booked an unrenovated room” when Hyatt WEB SITE OR CALL CENTERS have no such room description or choice. While more spacious accommodations are available, prices are similar to better quality hotels such as The Savoy or The Rosewood might charge. At that point, services at the former hotels as well as food selections would be higher in quality for the same price.
2.	While food in the general restaurant and the Churchill bar was good, food in the executive lounge was depressing and downright horrible.  You would get better food served to you at Attica or Sing-Sing.
3.	Front office desk has an army of indifferent, rude and obnoxious staff while the concierge can barely tell you were the nearest ATM is.  

While this is our third stay at The Churchill, we noted a marked decline in general services that can best be described as indifferent.  The hotel has its following, as the location is fabulous. A steady stream of tourists from the Middle East, Far East and Asia keep the hotel a popular choice.  

Booking

We decided to book a double twin room and use Hyatt points for access to the executive lounge. Upon arrival in the evening, we were told that we had booked a non-renovated double room.  It is sad that a hotel in this age still has unrenovated rooms and disturbing that management arbitrarily decides who gets them.  Mind you, no place on the HYATT web site suggests for a moment that they have a class of “non renovated” rooms or that your booking one.  Our front desk clerk, who could barely speak English, was unhelpful, inhospitable, surly, and rude.  If she had worked in a morgue the dead would get up and demand to be waked elsewhere.  We were told that we could “upgrade” for another 275 GBP to a suite if we wanted to.  
Room

Our twin double room for 25-28 square feet turned out to be two single beds at roughly 18-20 square feet – see pictures.  The bathroom was so tiny you have to position yourself just right in order to use the toilet.  The “NON-RENOVATED” rooms – that are most probably given to Americans – do not include a walk-in shower.  However, the tub is very steep and climbing in and out can be a safety or comfort issue for some when wanting to shower.  Still, the teeny tiny cruise ship room had all of the comforts that one expects from a moderate hotel like the Hyatt.

Of course, the Hyatt Churchill has other room configurations and for persons requiring far largest space in that fabulous neighborhood you should indeed book one. However, it is important to note that those larger room prices creep up to the prices of far better hotels that offer higher degrees of services and creature comforts such as The Savoy, Mandarin Oriental and Brown Hotel just to name a few.  

We found daily housekeeping to be excellent.  

Food

The Hotel’s main restaurant, The Montagu Kitchen offered fresh selection for lunch and dinner with prices you would expect from a hotel. Baked goods all tasted the same and were simply disgusting.  The hotel’s apple pie tastes like pits of apple mixed with lots of flour to fill your tummy.  It should be noted a far better option is the 108 Brasserie at the very walkable Hotel Marylebone and has a much more diverse and interesting menu.  

We do continue to find The Churchill Bar and Terrace a remarkably undervalued hotel bar that holds its own having incredible selections of cocktails made by remarkably talented bartenders.  Sit at the bar and watch them execute style and detail on every single drink they make.  We would stop in for “A tip of the Admiral” as they say after theater and ordered hot sandwiches with some drink selections.  Be warned the bar can get packed at times and rightly so.  

We find the executive lounge slipping and sliding with quality and presentation unbelievably low.  Breakfast was ok with the usual beans, sausages, bacon, cereals juices, breads and yogurts.  The selections never appeared to change during our 6 nigh stay and after day three food was monotonous and boring.  Once more, the friendly and well-intentioned staff were just too slow to handle the influx of “I paid for this so I’m eating as much as I can” crowd that the executive lounge.  

Staff in the lounge were again, well-intentioned but were laughably inefficient.  One lady not from the UK would see a dirty plate and disappear into the kitchen with it – for five minutes.  She would then go over to the buffet and slightly move cutlery around while people waiting for coffee cups to be filled.  She would then ask people what they wanted, and then she would walk over to the other end of the buffet, place a coffee cup on the table, then walk to the other end to get the coffee, walk back to the table and pour the coffee.  She would disappear.  GOD FORBID you needed cream for the coffee as that would create a larger dance step.  Those that ordered omelets could have a nearly thirty-minute wait while the staff continued to dance around the lounge doing nothing. I’m not saying the staff was lazy because they were clearly working, but the focus on throwing away a bottle cap, or finding a cup to pour coffee into is insane.  It’s morning, so cups should be placed on the tables and someone should simply walk around every so often pouring coffee or tea. It’s not that hard.  The obvious cost cutting of not placing coffee cups on the table for fear one would have to wash any unused coffee cup is ridiculous.  Why not really save money and stop offering coffee?   I honestly have to say I dare think the Queen’s staff would not take so much attention to rather mundane things.  One morning even though we asked for a cheddar cheese omelet we were given another type of cheese and it was because the lady taking the order simply did not speak English. To be fair, I’m not sure if the staff had to cook the omelets themselves or there was a chef in the back kitchen, but rest assured you will wait for what is unremarkable food.   

We visited the lounge for cocktails for one evening and while the offerings resembled left over from a dogs breakfast, we could not believe the behavior of people that gathered at the 5 pm hour to absolutely make what is supposed to be simple appetizers with a drink into a daily meal.  People piled on plates of small sandwiches, cakes, dollops of humus and whatever they could shovel on a plate – even if they didn’t like the selections - and by 510pm the offerings were gone.  This has nothing at all to do with the hotel and one cannot fault them.  The food is not meant to be a meal replacement, but scavengers exist in every corner of the world.  We never went back, and we sadly would never book an executive lounge stay when better options are available steps away from the hotel.

Other Notes

Room service was fast and efficient as was laundry service – yes you pay dearly but that is to be expected.  It should also be noted that security was omnipresent at the entrances of the hotel and that is a good thing.  The hotel is located in a very residential and what appears to be a safe area.  Still it was comforting to know that guests and others were being monitored and it was much appreciated.  

Thoughts

You could do far worse than book a room at The Hyatt Churchill.  And, if room size, reservations or food is not so important to you than you should have a fairly good stay.  Still, it’s hard to book a reservation for rooms that the hotel staff admit do not exist.  It’s even harder to stay at a hotel that lacks hospitality.  With limited food options and an unattractive executive lounge, you may do better at another hotel that has a better reputation and interest in hospitality for the same price.",3,2019,06,01
150,Great location; claustrophobic rooms.,"Rooms very small, shower dangerous, coffee awful, concierge was great.  Would not stay there again and I love Hyatt hotels.  Location in middle of city.  Bar was attractive but drinks over $20 US.  Staff excellent.",3,2019,05,31
150,Churchill a Fine Place,"Nice place -- not cheap, but quite upscale and nice.  What can I say, you can stroll through Hyde park or go jogging in the morning or evening.  The shops on the street behind the hotel are very nice and convenient, not too upscale but Harrods is only a mile away if one must indulge.  ",5,2019,05,30
150,Overpriced for What It Is,"If service were the only criteria for reviewing the Churchill, this would be a a five star review.

If location were the only criteria, this would be a five star review.

But with very small rooms and one of the tiniest bathrooms in a modern hotel, the Churchill falls short, especially in comparison with comparably (and lesser) priced five star hotels in London.

The Churchill holds much nostalgia for me, but in a city with so many excellent properties, it is not sufficient to look past the hotel's obvious shortcomings.  I am surprised they can continue to command the pricing they do.",4,2019,05,29
150,Nice experience for the honeymoon!,My wife and I spent 3 nights of our honeymoon in London. The Hyatt Churchill was a pleasant stay in a great location. The rooms were a bit outdated but the service was great from the hotel and staff. We had an upgrade to use the executive/club lounge which provided a nice place to have breakfast and evening cocktails although beware it gets crowded in the evening. Overall a fun visit and we’d stay here again.,4,2019,05,29
150,Classic and thoughtful but tired,"The Doormen are well trained and smart enough to make a very good start and the refreshing drinks in the lobby are awesome. However, one of the three lifts remained out of order throughout our stay and the situation was exacerbated on our second night when a second lift stopped working as well. 
The quality of the hangers and amenities are quite high, but the design of the drawers in the closet is really quite problematic as the soft closing mechanism gave them resistance to being opened and the handles failed to provide any substantial grip. The handheld shower also leaked where it connected to the hose, though we enjoyed the massage function. There was also a lack of lighting that shone horizontally in the washroom which drastically reduced the usefulness of the magnifying mirror.
We were grateful that the hotel provided a humidifier for us as requested, and that the room was clean enough that our respiratory allergies failed to act up despite the lack of an air purifier. Cleaning up water from refilling the humidifier led us to discover that the desk left wide black streaks on the towels, however - the dye may be coming off and we were lucky we didn't stain anything by placing them on the desk.
The pillows are fluffy without much substance which made them rather uncomfortable as I do not enjoy feeling like I’m about to be suffocated from sinking too far into my pillow. They also don’t provide enough support for my neck. A pillow menu where guests could choose alternative pillows would have been much appreciated. 
The air-conditioning is also far too loud. There were times where one of us mistook it for the sound of a running shower.  ",5,2019,05,29
150,Wonderful stay,"Sohley the concierge on the club floors was pleasant, extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  Godfrey at the doors always made me smile and was helpful and engaging and made me feel welcome at the start or the end of the day. ",5,2019,05,29
150,Lovely hotel,"The staff in this hotel are just wonderful,polite and efficient. The room was superb and perfectly clean. The hotel was so very well situated for shopping,Hyde Park and for the tube stations to other parts of London.
We only had one very small problem in that the hot food on the breakfast buffet was rather cold by the time we returned to our table, We mentioned this to the waiter who immediately cancelled the bill and offered to get the chef to cook fresh food. Excellent customer service !! We will be back.",5,2019,05,29

150,Churchill is a good hotel,"Stayed at three London locations in recent times, Churchill with Hyatt chain, and Waldorf with Hilton chain, and Conrad a year before, with Hilton chain.  All three are good, all three bring different things to the equation.  All three are usually similar in price, with Conrad generally moving a little ahead of the other two, a little higher.  The waldorf (which is not a Waldorf Astoria, but a grade lower) is the best by far if your goal is theatre.  It is smack dab in the middle of the theatre district, its staff knows the area, with Diamond card you get unlimited access to both the order menu in the nice breakfast room, for free, and the club room which is reasonably decent.  They moved us up after a few days when they weren't free.  The staff has been there since before it was a Hilton Brand, and they are accommodating, friendly, and fun.

The Churchill is a little distance (not too far) from the theatre district, but right across the street from the magnificent Hyde Park... they have a decent club room, and a remodeled side and a non-remodeled side.  We upgraded to a remodeled suite because of business needs and the price was reasonable, an extra hundred pounds at check in.  Globalist got you a free breakfast in the very nice and well attended club room... but not in the restaurant with personal selection.  You could order off the menu.  If it is a theatre trip I'd pick Waldorf; if its business, Churchill, but it is dependent on the price.  Churchill seemed a little pricer.  We did not buy food or use room service.  The Waldorf has a full service health club.  The Churchill, not much.  We checked out of the Churchill on route to another business meeting and nearly missed it because the cab gave us the run around and the marathon was coming up.  I think the front desk should have warned us of the traffic.

The third, back to the Hilton chain, the Conrad.  It is more expensive (usually, prices vary a lot on all three) but a solid full level ahead of either Churchill or Waldorf ... good location, and the best rooms and best club room by far.

Using points is much easier at Hyatt chain than at Hilton chain.  Hyatt top categories are 30,000 points and with Globalist you can get upgraded to a suite in the old section (but have to pay to move to the new section.)  There are no Hyatt's comparable to the Conrad in over all beauty, in London, no park hyatts... and since the Park Hyatt is 30,000 points in most cities (Paris and New York and Milan for example) feels like Churchill should be 25,000 points instead of 30,000...",4,2019,05,15

150,Two decades of Churchill !!,"I have been a guest at the Churchill Hotel for the past 2 plus decades!!! Its an excellent place to stay, right in the heart of the city. Albeit a little pricy its a good place to stay when you are on business!",5,2019,05,08
150,"Great location, comfortable clean bed makes a wonderful trip","Terrific safe location, close to shops and easy walking to parks, Marble Arch, Hyde Park. We easily enjoyed 30,000 steps a day using this as our central hub. The bed was fabulously comfortable and I love the crisp Url we sheets. The room was perfect for our mother daughter weekend together in london. I’d definitely recommend this to anyone and would come back.",5,2019,05,03
150,Enjoyed our stay,Checkin was easy.  We enjoyed the concierge floor for breakfast and cocktails and snacks later in the day.  The business /eighth floor concierge was most helpful.   Most importantly the room was well appointed and clean. Service was excellent.,5,2019,05,02

150,Rude and incompetent service,"We checked in and went to the Churchill bar for a drink after a long flight. Ordered a gunner but the waiter didn’t even know what a gunner is. Instead he kept condescendingly flipped the menu open and told us to only order what’s in the menu. This was not the kind of service we were expecting from a Hyatt hotel, albeit in their Churchill bar.",1,2019,05,01

150,Brilliant ,"Stayed here after a while. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, partly due the great upgrade I was given. It remains in my view the Most convenient hotel in London for both business and tourism. The lounge was well supplied and good selection. Only area for improvement is the fitness centre. Small for size of hotel and Lacked enough equipment ",5,2019,04,13

It was the worst hotel ever
The room service is extremely bad",1,2019,04,08
150,Lovely hotel - bar even better!,"There are lots of 5 star hotels in London and they all have something to commend them. This one is especially well located for me - I love Marylebone, it has the sort of shops you don’t find on oxford street and you don’t have to go far to find yourself in a community setting complete with local pub and restaurants that rely on locals.
The rooms here are really good but make sure you try to get one of the renovated ones - if you ask before you arrive you stand a better chance.
The best things about the hotel are the  the staff (Asya has always been helpful and paid me the compliment of recognising me last time I checked in) the bar(which has some of the most accomplished and knowledgeable bar tenders I have ever come across) and the proximity of my favourite restaurant Locanda Locatelli which has its own entrance near the bar -perfection!",5,2019,04,08
150,Everything was perfect,"Everything was perfect, the location was superb, facilities were very nice and the room service was quick and very good, Laundry with a fair price and reasonable time. TV channels and the tea room was perfect. Cleaning lady was very nice with us.",5,2019,04,08

150,Great hotel!,"This was our first time in London (for a week). The hotel was in a great location, not far from anything, and always had black cabs waiting outside so we could get wherever we needed to go. We had a double room on floor 2. The bathroom was quite spacious but the tub was a bit odd as it was extremely high off the ground and there was not a full door on the shower. The beds were comfortable and the room was cleaned daily. House keeping even came by at night to ask us if we needed anything extra before evening. The gym was literally down the hall, and it looked quite spacious with many machines... though I didn’t have the chance to use any of them. The hotel was modern and very clean. Check in and check out was extremely easy. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I am glad we stayed here.

I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the restaurant and bar downstairs, while beautiful, seemed a little over priced. There wasn't really a “causal” dining option available. Also we did experience 2 “scheduled” blackouts at about midnight due to work being done in the hotel so nothing worked in the room for a while (in regards to chargers, lights, the tv) and we were in total darkness for a bit. Also the mini fridge in the room was not really a refrigerator as it did not keep anything “cold.” Not really sure what the point of having that in the room is if beverages are not cool.

In total I would recommend this hotel as it is modern, clean, and friendly toward tourists. It is a good/safe location. It was about 40 minutes away from Heathrow airport. Staying here made our stay very easy and comfortable.",4,2019,04,05
150,Superb,"This is the best hotel we have stayed in in London. It is well placed for Oxford Street and underground stations. The room was large, comfortable and well appointed. Ours had a lovely view over the square and despite being on the front of the building was quiet and tranquil. The bathroom was superbly appointed.  Everything was where it should be and spotlessly clean. We had a problem with a leaking iron and consequently a fuse that blew which was fixed in minutes. The staff are clearly well trained and it shows. They are helpful, knowledgeable and all have excellent interpersonal skills. The concierges were extremely helpful and efficient. We had delicious food and excellent wine.  It would be an ideal spot to catch up with friends. We will be back.",5,2019,04,05
150,Amazing hotel and location,Overall the hotel is excellent and the location is just superb. Wifi connection was always strong. Reception and concierge always ready to help. The hotel is very clean. Location is a five minutes walk to Oxford st.,5,2019,04,03

150,"Good Price, Great Location","We usually stay at the London Marriott Grosvenor Square which is walking minutes from Selfridges but decided to consider Hyatt Churchill this time which is also walking minutes away, albeit from a different direction.WELL WORTH the GBP100 savings per night!

Just as luxurious and with friendly competent service. It also faces the Portman Square so you get some greenery nearby. An absolute gem of a breakfast place - Daisy Green - just steps away too

2 complaints:
1) Inconsistent Housekeeping - Our rooms were sometimes made up as late as late late afternoon
2) Gym - Tiny with machines placed practically inches from each other",4,2019,01,21
150,Another Great Hyatt,"Second stay at the Churchill and planning to return.  The hotel is not perfect, but the sum of all the pluses outweighs the negatives. 

My room faced the park with plenty of light, a lovely view, a very comfortable king size bed and plenty of space to move around, which is often a challenge in London hotels.  

I had access to the lounges on the 8th floor and breakfast was available at no cost, a good perk, most hotels in London charge £ 35-40 for breakfast.  

The gym is small, but appropriate with weights, treadmills and eliptical machines. 

The service is friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. 

The location is central and very convenient for shoppers, two minutes from Oxford Street and quite close to Paddington Station. ",4,2019,01,20

150,I had a terrible experience at churchill hotel ,"Well lets start at the day we arrived, our first night sitting in a single room and we’ve booked with 19 days with them there hospitality was poor espicially the tall lady with brown curly hair was such a rude with us ! (Not a good start) the staff did nothing to reassure if we feel comfortable , so for a bigger room they’ve let us pay more than 2000£ to transfer to a twin garden room view , we are a very old guests since 2009 a long history and stay with them , i will never advise my friends & family , im really upset & shocked from the way talking to us in very rude and they think we dont understand english or we’re idiots , will avoid hyatt’s in the future based on the experience at this hotel . My rate as three star hotel with five star prices and thar sums it up perfectly . The cleaning is sloppy , the staff is in attentive the manager is arrogant and if you ask for anything wait an hour before receiving it ! The best of all the breakfast and my favorite staff and brother (stevene) so kind and always smiling 💙 other then that the last stay with them this year . They charged me a room phone call and i never used the phone & mini bar we are muslims they said some of the beer are missing how could it be !                                                  This property must be one of the least well managed, because that is the only way can safely conclude that the staff could be allowed to be continuoslt uncaring and indifferent , this review could readily run pages counting everything done wrong , so we can only hit the high lights here. Check -in & the check out staff impolite to us . ",1,2019,01,16
150,Pride Weekend Stay,Great hotel. Very busy. Doesn’t look so grand externally but internally it does. Staff are excellent. Rooms are very comfortable but quite small and packed in - we had the cheapest room but it was still above the average price of a nice hotel in London.,4,2019,01,15
150,Great location for a mediocre hotel,"The hotel is in an excellent location in that it is close to a wide variety of restaurants and shopping experiences. The rooms and common areas are spacious and comfortable but ""tired"". It is far too expensive for an ordinary chain property. The service level is mediocre.",2,2019,01,15
150,Great London hotel,"I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill multiple times recently for business and have enjoyed staying there very much. I always feel at home here. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the staff is very helpful and kind, the restaurant is great and the Churchill Bar is excellent.",5,2019,01,14
150,Very comfortable stay.  Excellent for business travelers.,"Had a great stay at the Hyatt Regency London-The Churchill in December, just before the holidays.  The hotel is conveniently located to the Northeast side of Hyde Park and many shopping destinations such as Selfridge's, Bond St. and Oxford St.  There is close and easy access to the tube right around the corner, making it very easy to see the sights.  The hotel itself is quite large and definitely caters to the business-traveler set.  The rooms are comfortable, thoughtful, and spacious enough for a longer stay.  We had a room facing a small park and the windows were double-paned to keep the noise to a minimum.  I am a very light sleeper and had no issues.  The bathroom was adequate in size.  There is a large restaurant in the lobby that bleeds over into a lounge area (which should be noted has a separate menu), and these areas were fairly busy at all hours.  There is another restaurant facing the exterior that we did not try.  And there is a smaller bar tucked away in one corner of the building that was also very busy every day of our stay - we had to go to the lounge for food & drinks one night because the bar was packed.  My drink was excellent and inventive (can't remember the name but it had clementine vodka).   I had a Hyatt Club Lounge pass that made the stay even more enjoyable, as we were able to have a good, free breakfast each morning before heading out.  They have two club lounges (one for families and one for adults-only) and the food and beverage offerings for breakfast and the evening social hours were generous.  The lounge was also a life-saver on the day of arrival, as they had toothbrushes/toothpaste, mouthwash, etc., for freshening up while we waited for our room to be available.  This helped me feel refreshed without having to dig through my bags for toiletries in a public bathroom.  They even have a shower in the family lounge which was a nice touch.  It would be well-worth paying for the club lounge rooms/access, if you don't already have those passes through the Hyatt loyalty program, when staying at this hotel as this was one of the best club lounges I've seen.  My only quibble is that the hotel was unwilling to negotiate on the rate when we wanted to extend our stay.  They would only quote what was showing on their website, which was ridiculously high even for London.  Many hotels are willing to offer in-house rates to keep people for additional days but no one here seemed interested or able to negotiate the rate.  I waited until the last day before departure before re-booking another hotel and they had plenty of availability on-line (every room and suite type showed available), but no one was empowered to offer a better rate to keep a guest.  Instead, they let us walk and lost that revenue, which is baffling.  And of course the rate went down after we departed and were committed elsewhere - they could have kept that room filled and we would have likely used the bar & restaurant(s) again.  It felt like a wasted opportunity on their part and is an area where they could improve.  Otherwise, the stay was very good and the hotel itself is quite nice.  I would stay here again.",5,2019,01,14
150,King room with lounch access,"Climate issue (freezing the first 2 days) and never offered for a room change or an upgrade.....However, hotel offer high standards of service and quality of stay.

One room recieved complimentary fruit and Molton Brown products didn't. 
I did make the club staff aware, they did provide the bathroom products but not the fruit. I find this very odd as I payed the same rate, and service was very different. 
The other issue I had was the Club Lounge.
Meagre breakfast offering.
Preference given to Arab guests, offering if tea and coffee etc.
The evenings are like a fish market. It's noisy and kids are allowed to run around. The second lounge is only open until 9pm.
I was happy to leave this hotel. Eventhough it is convenient. The staff were always polite, I will not return.
",3,2019,01,03
150,A great and affordable place,A very good place to sleep. But room service food is not so great. That is why when I get hungry I prefered to use Uber eats. The location is great because it is very close to Oxfords street and close to Selfridges place. ,3,2019,01,02
150,Ok,Cigarette smoke in hallways was the major problem staying at this hotel. If it was just one night I would have it the responsibility on an impolite guest but this happened 4 nights in a row so the hotel needs to better enforce the rules,3,2019,01,01
150,Wonderful hotel with great staffs,"Beautiful hotel situated in the heart of shopping street with lots of wonderful restaurant in the area. Awesome Churchill bar with good vibe & wonderful staffs, special thx to Mr. Daniel from Sicily for the wonderful assistance & memorable night. We will definitely come back to Hyatt again. ",5,2019,01,01
150,Love this place,"We had a wonderful stay and we can thank those who were of great assistance to us very much!!Amanda at the Regency Club is always smiling and goes above and beyond helping, thank you so much.Adriana at the Montague was a delight, harding working and enjoyed speaking with her.Abdelaziz in Housekeeping was AMAZING, he helped us beyond what we would have expected and even came back to make sure everything was well with us, we chatted for a bit and really appreciated his hard work, making our room fabulous, he is to be well commended.All the workers in the Regency Club are quite nice, working hard, pleasing everyone - Thank you!!!",5,2018,12,31
150,Avoid. High Price. Small rooms. Run down. ,"Will avoid Hyatt’s in the future based on the experience at this hotel. I read one review (too late) that describes this as a three star hotel with five star prices and that sums it up perfectly.

Also note that the hotel and surrounding area caters almost entirely to people from the Middle East. If you want to feel and smell like you’re in Doha, go right ahead and stay here (it’s a bit like booking a trip to Nashville and getting there only to find out you’re in Tijuana). If you want a more traditional English experience I would pick another district of London.",1,2018,12,31
150,4 nights,great hotel- wonderful location - staff truly tries to treat you as a guest - I spend 75 daysayear inhotelsand thisis by farone of  the  best hotels -only negative  I found is  that the  rooms require  more  lighting if one plans to read IF -  easly solved by requesting some lamps  ,5,2018,12,29
150,Terrible service,I stayed in the hotel for a month already I can tell u that the cleaning is sloppy and the breakfast is bad. The service in the breakfast is horrible . The staff is in attentive the manger is arrogant and if u ask for anything wait an hr before receiving it . I paid  for the remainder of my stay am kinda  stuck. Go to Grosvenor house hotel instead ,2,2018,12,26
150,Excellent location,"It was my second stay with the hotel concerned. The location is really nice as it is close to Oxford Street, Marble Arch underground station etc. Therefore it is quite attractive. The only thing that might influence on perception is that it has been long time since its last refurbishment.",4,2018,12,25
150,Amazing Hotel and Staff," Beautiful hotel and location. The reception team was amazing but I want to mention Waris that he put special care towards us. It was my 1st time in the hotel and they upgrade me to the park view room. ",5,2018,12,23
150,Quiet location ,"
We spent 8 days at the Churchill. The room was clean, modern, well appointed and the bed was comfortable. Sadly no Nespresso machine, coffee singles were pretty bad. Front desk was friendly and professional, the room service was very good and a great alternative to dining out. The location is adequate, about 3 block to Marble station, there is a small grocery store across the park and some restaurants. I would like to stay closer to Bond street or Piccadilly next time. But this hotel is a great alternative. ",4,2018,12,20
150,"Great location, updated, elegant rooms and terrific bed! Staying again with the whole family, and booked a club room!","First time staying in Portman Square and boy was this hotel a terrific find. It's large but somehow feels like an intimate hotel. The location is perfect - it's near everything (quick walk to the parks, palaces, shopping streets) but also feels quiet and tucked away, which was perfect given how overwhelming London, and any city, can often be.  So, my take-aways:

Goods:
1. The room: it's not enormous, but they are newly renovated, elegant, well appointed and cozy. The bed is amazing (those pillows!), and the bathroom is super elegant.  I loved the closets, and the fact that they would treat you with lovely amenities like a kit to help you sleep.

2. The location: as I've said before, I think the location is tops. We stayed at the Savoy last time and while that was old world charm, this location is way better. It's close to everything, which I loved.

3. The Churchill statue in the lobby is a hoot.

The Not-so-Goods:

1. I'm being picky since there really isn't much to criticize: the gym is ok. Not huge, and no real free weights.  

2. The breakfast was a tiny bit irritating: I ordered the ""pancakes"" for 12 pounds, and got one oily pancake.  I did let the manager know this seems outrageous and he was very polite and agreed that they should correct this.

Anyway, Loved this place and am taking my whole family back for our trip to London in March. We booked a club room so will report back on how that compares, but I'm excited!",5,2018,12,17
150,ALANOUD,Very nice & amazing hotel clean room the bed was comfortable & the room service excellent Also the location of the hotel perfect & the foid very delicious I will recommend this hotel to all my family & friendsI wish the best for the hotel,5,2018,12,16
150,Great location for xmas shopping!,"Wife and myself wanted a central hotel to do some xmas shopping. Located in Portman Square we were on 100 yards away fro Oxford Street and the extensive shopping experience we needed. Front desk checked us in early (11.30am) so we could drop our suitcases and start shopping. As our allocated room was not ready they also added free breakfasts for our stay, a very nice touch and well appreciated.",5,2018,12,14
150,VACATION STAY,"The bar is now excellent. The hotel bathrooms are very small for a five star hotel. The porter service during arrival and departure regarding baggades was very bad. Buffet breakfast is good, but not what it used to be. The price of each night was very high, comparing to past stay.",3,2018,12,13
150,Poor upkeep,Poor quality rooms and lounges. In great need of a renovation. Would not stay there again. Lounge chairs were filthy and overall sense was a 3 star hotel and not a 5 star by any means.  Food was fair.. ,2,2018,12,10
150,Very nice hotel,"I stayed three nights beginning of dec , check in and check out fast, am been given room and told refurbished floor, presumably there are floors which are not , I really don’t know. Restaurant down stairs very nice and the service across the hotel is excellent with greetings from all staff.",5,2018,12,10
150,Perfect London hotel,"The Hyatt Churchill is a wonderful choice for either business or holiday travel to London.  Portman Square is nestled between Mayfair and Knightsbridge, close to the most vibrant business and shopping areas.  The Churchill offers impeccable service, excellent food, and a lovely setting. ",5,2018,12,09
150,Highly secured and amazing location,Not only the front desk but all staff are very helpful the hotel is really nice it meets my expectations will always go back to it. The beds are very comfortable the hotel is focusing on the wellbeing and mindful messages.,5,2018,12,07
150,"Sunday Champagne Brunch at The Montagu Restaurant, Hyatt Regency London","We attended Sunday Champagne Brunch in The Montagu Restaurant at the Hyatt Regency and had a fabulous time. The food is excellent and beautifully displayed, the service outstanding and the ambiance relaxing and luxurious. Food choices for brunch include starters, breakfast options, main course, desserts, cheese, coffee and endless champagne topped up throughout. This is the fifth time I have attended this brunch for a special occasion as the restaurant caters for small gatherings or large groups. I can highly recommend this experience and will return again and again.",5,2018,12,07
150,Wonderful Experience,"My husband and I just spent four nights in the Churchill Hyatt in London.  From check-in to check-out our experience was wonderful.  We arrived early after an all night flight and were pleased to hear our room was ready so we could freshen up before heading out.  Our room was spacious by city standards (and much larger than hotel room my husband had to move to for the business part of his trip).  The room was on the second floor and overlooked the park.  There was some traffic noise on Friday and Saturday night but it was muffled and didn't keep us up.  Everything was clean, the bathrooms were luxury with heated toiled seats and non-steam mirrors.  We didn't eat there because we were focused on seeing as much of London as we could in 3 days.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We were able to walk through Hyde Park to Kensington and walked to Buckingham Palace (about a mile each).  It is close to the shopping on Oxford Street which I wouldn't recommend.  We enjoyed the shopping at Covent Garden much more.  Overall a wonderful experience.",5,2018,12,06
150,Best experience,Everything was really good except the shower. The floor in the shower was a little bit dangerous due to the fact the the floor was slippery. This is not very good for a five stars hotel and in particular for a presidential room.,5,2018,12,05
150,Experience in Hyatt,Overall experience in the hotel was great. Friendly staff who ensure you have a seamless experience from checking in to departing. Great atmosphere in the hotel and an ideal location very near to Oxford street.,5,2018,12,04
150,Best Hotel In London,"Just off Oxford Street / Marble Arch. Premium Hotel with Family feel. Food and drinks excellent, super staff and caring attitude from the moment you arrive to the second you leave   . Will definitely stay again. ",5,2018,12,04
150,Home away from home while in London,"Loved my stay at the Hyatt Regency London, a hotel that I've come to consider as my home away from home.  The location is outstanding and so to is the service for World of Hyatt members.  The rooms are very comfortable and private.  You are within walking distance to the most popular sites in London and easy access to the underground subway, buses and the Heathrow Express train in Paddington Station.  The staff is service oriented and World of Hyatt members are recognized and well received at this hotel.  Others can sometimes tend to be matter of fact about welcoming a frequent guest, but this doesn't happen at the Hyatt Regency London.",5,2018,12,03
150,Perfect Experience ,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights on a business trip and the experience was perfect. Can’t think of any negatives- great location, very good rooms, amazing staff and food. Would definitely like to visit again and recommend to everyone.",5,2018,12,02
150,Very disappointed,"Hello
I am currently staying at the Hyatt the churchill and I am highly disappointed.
First of all I advise anyone going there to take a lamp or a candle because the rooms are so dark I had to use my Iphone torch to look for stuff in my suitcase.
Secondly, I asked for a bed linen change after 2 nights in and of course the linen were not changed. They kept saying they did it and I am sure they did not as I put some evidences to check.
At last they charged for a rollway bed that they did not bring. i had to call 10 times and look for people in the hall way to find someone to speak to.
The staff keeps pretending that the services are outstanding but dont get fooled: they keep saying “we are a 5 star hotel in Mayfair” while the services are way way below standards.
I  used to be a hyatt Gold member and I stopped using their hotels because of issues I faced before but I was definelty expecting more from this kind of hotel especially given what they charge.

Thanks",1,2018,12,01
150,Superb,"Having had a disaster at another hotel, we moved here, and so glad we did. Exceptional welcome from Nicky at the check in, great room, wonderful service throughout our stay. Very impressed, recommended",5,2018,11,30
150,Classy Churchill ,"We had a weekend break in the Churchill and it is the best hotel that we have ever stayed in - in London. Staff are attentive and excellent and the rooms are very spacious. We checked in early and were allowed access to the club lounge on our last day right up until we left for the airport (circa 6pm). 
Food in the club lounge is very good (breakfast was our highlight) and canapés and drinks in the early evening (5.30pm-7.30pm) were an excellent way to prepare for a night out. The hotel itself is beautiful and location (near Marble Arch) is perfect. If you want a relaxing break in a high-end hotel you must stay here. 
",5,2018,11,29
150,Good hotel for business.,Stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a night during a business trip to London.  Hotel is centrally located in Mayfair.  The lobby and the rooms and very tastefully remodeled.  Bed was comfortable.  Room service was fast and good. Only complaint is that my bathroom wasn’t particularly clean.  I think this was just a isolated incident but it was disappointing.  Would stay here again in London in business.  ,3,2018,11,29
150,Fabulous Thanksgiving Holiday in London,"The Hyatt Churchill has consistently been a great place to stay when we are in London. Their service is exceptional, very well-trained, professional staff. The hotel is very clean, rooms are comfortable and quiet. Location is wonderful- close to Oxford St. and Hyde Park. Easy walk across Hyde Park to Harrods area...The Churchill Bar is a great place to end the day with a nightcap or two! Cheers!",5,2018,11,27
150,"Minimal space, minimal service -- far below expectations; rooms are terribly small not good for business or pleasure","This was nothing short of one of the most disappointing experiences one could imagine. Think of everything a hotel can do wrong or poorly and this location met that expectation. If service is important, stay elsewhere. Brand loyalty, which brought us here, meant nothing to this hotel or its staff. This is not Hyatt Regency standards, from physical accommodations to staff. The ONLY reason we did not leave was our stay was only 3 nights, with a late first night and early departure. Since we had two rooms, we thought it best not to try a full move. 
This property must be one of the least well managed, because that is the only way one can safely conclude that the staff could be allowed to be continuously uncaring and indifferent. This review could readily run pages counting everything done wrong, so we can only hit the highlights here. 
Check-in. The check-in staff ranged from impolite to generally indifferent. Interestingly, they shared one thing--not one staff member offered information, asked about or offered club service (I had to ask about everything), suggested any benefits of Hyatt membership (so I can only imagine that there are none at the property), or otherwise seemed really to care. As a bonus, we paid almost 30% above the online rack rate. The check-in staff stated that we had a ""refurbished"" room. My goodness, I thought, how bad must the ""unrefurbished rooms"" be? Throughout, the staff was uninterested in doing more than the minimum, but this was in keeping with the hotel itself. Our ""view"" was of piping and air conditioning units on the building next door. Just what one hopes to see on a 3-night stay in London. The king bed took up 70% or more of the room. The closet barely fit one person's items (we had to keep clothes in the suitcases) and the chairs in these ""refurbished"" rooms were dirty (whether they have already become so or they just did not refurbish the chairs?). Though asking twice to have a manager to speak with, none ever made themselves available.  Instead, we were told at check out that the ""manager"" ""wanted"" to speak with us but they were in a meeting.  Apparently a 72-hour meeting.  We received an email afterwards from the ""assistant guest service manager"" apologizing for not being available throughout our stay, and attempting to explain the room rate--the least of our worry, given the poor service all around.  This confirmed the management has no idea, or no care, for what is happening.  So, based on other reviews you might get lucky and get good service, or you might not.  But to count on it would be a mistake.",1,2018,11,25
150,A good business hotel for a 1 night stay,Things to improve:  Is it me?  Or are all hotel rooms in London getting smaller?  Like Airline seats in economy class?  I guess so.  We chose an upgraded room and it was pretty small - I must be getting more fussy.The Pluses: The Staff were ALL excellent and went out of their way to be helpful and meet our every need.  The property is in excellent condition and looks  nicely decorated,4,2018,11,25
150,Always great,Another wonderful stay and the Hyatt Churchill.  The 8th floor rooms and the club lounge make for a peaceful stay.  The perfect way to start and finish your day.  Room spacious and bedding extremely comfortable.  Very quiet.,5,2018,11,24
150,Excellent Stay,"Excellent hotel and service,
I have stayed other Hyatt hotels in different countries , always guarantied the top quality service and hotel rooms and facilities .
Nice peaceful rooms and good quality breakfast .
Friendly professional staf .
Definitely will visit again .",5,2018,11,24
150,Will be coming back ,"Overall, a very enjoyable stay at The Churchill. The hotel delivered on various levels for us, a couple without any accompanying kids. 

We like the ability to sleep soundly in a hotel (no small challenge in many hotels nowadays) and that’s where hotel absolutely made our night: mattress, cushions, duvets all great, leading to nights of great rest. The only thing missing was the ability to turn down the A/C to a more comfortable level during the night as windows were not to be opened due to traffic noise on Portman Square.

Staying at the executive floor, we had the benefit to access the club lounge with very friendly staff and great service plus amble food and drink. The only observation: Why on earth do all chairs and tables need to be that low; to shorten the stay of patrons?

We also enjoyed the Churchill Bar with its great atmosphere. I don’t know but I expected the cocktail selection a bit more extensive.",4,2018,11,21
150,Received great help from Hyatt Regency London team,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency London The Churchill for 3 nights in November. When I arrived I was quite panicked because I realized my wallet was stolen in the tube. I found that my hotel room card was also missing so I spoke to Joe and Raul at concierge. They were very concerned for me and assisted me with all the help I needed.

I am glad I decided to stay at Hyatt Regency London during this trip because of the kindness and caring staff that kept me not too stressed. 

Thank you, Joe, Raul and the rest of the Hyatt Regency London team!",5,2018,11,20
150,The organic breakfast,I wish to find this kind of breakfast where ever I stay! Excellent selection of organic food to start your day. All the comfort in luxury room + very good location. Well I always love Churchill and now have another reason!,5,2018,11,19
150,Extremely comfy beds and very helpful staff,The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were super clean. Will certainly stay here again given the cleanliness of the rooms and how helpful the hotel staff were throughout our stay (shutout to the manager Judy),5,2018,11,19
150,Superb Afternoon Tea,We had a delightful birthday celebration in the Montagu Kitchen at this hotel; the staff were attentive without being intrusive and we were not rushed in the slightest. The menu for vegetarian sandwiches provided for half our group had been emailed in advance.  The surroundings are elegant and comfortable.,5,2018,11,17
150,Elegant and comfortable hotel,"I stayed four nights on business in a room with lounge access.  The room was newly refurbished, elegant and very comfortable.  The bathroom was small but fully functional.  The lounge was absolutely worth it, as it provided an ample choices of breakfast items, evening appetizers, and a welcoming place to work or relax during the day.  Staff was everywhere and extremely attentive.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,11,15
150,"Lovely hotel, ideally situated for the West End",This was our first stay at the Churchill and we will certainly be back. Our room was very nice; very well decorated and appointed. It was our wedding anniversary and we were sent a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and a cake. It is touches like this that make the difference,5,2018,11,13
150,Keeps Improving,"I was back at this hotel for a couple of days and was impressed by the renovations. ( See May 2017 for my initial review). I was unable to get a larger room however I was given a newly renovated one. The room was average size, a king size bed, a desk, and a chair. The bathroom was small but I appreciated the stand up shower versus the tub because it felt more spacious. They did not have a Nespresso machine however they had all the other amenities. The lobby area was spacious and ideal for hanging out with friends and having an afternoon tea. Their gluten free items were limited and they even ran out of gluten free bread at some point. Breakfast buffet was good, plenty of options, again low on gluten. Overall, this is a great hotel with proximity to Oxford street and high end shopping.  I give it my GoldnAdvice seal of approval.",4,2018,11,12
150,Great,"Great location, service and accommodation. Staff always welcoming and eager to assist. Overall perfect hotel for business and holiday trips. Breakfast is amazing as is the Churchill terrace with great variety of snacks and drinks.",5,2018,11,12
150,Great location and staff,"Decide to try something different and we’re very pleased with this hotel.  We will stay here again.  The hotel is very nice condition, staff are excellent and the location is convenient for Oxford St and the parks.  Our room faced the street but was very quiet.  A good choice.",5,2018,11,11
150,"Beautiful, well kept hotel that treated us very well.",The hotel requires the use of keys to use the elevator which was nice and made us feel secure.  The floor we were on had a private World of Hyatt concierge to use as we needed as well as a computer and printer we could use. We needed to print off paper tickets for an event we wanted to attend and it was perfect.  Location was close to Marble Arch and Tube station.,5,2018,11,09
150,Great stay in the heart of London,"Wonderful gem in the heart of London. It is my 10th visit to the hotel and The Churchill Hyatt lives to my expectations all the way through. The atmosphere, the service and the food are of high quality.",5,2018,11,08
150,The best place to stay in London without a doubt,"The though of staying at a hotel room for 15 days was a little daunting and monotonous, me being a Hyatt man wanted to stay at the Hyatt. So my children had arranged for a posh Airbnb flat in Mayfair to split our stay .
But once we checked in and stayed a few days there was no way I was gonna leave this hotel. The location of the hotel is just perfect it’s very close to Marble Arch/ Oxford street but surprisingly quiet and residential. We were given a suite on the 9th floor with a terrace overlooking the lovely Portman square park . The suite was very well  laid out and the bathroom had a toilet shower( it was a God sent !)The terrace was not huge but good enough to sit and enjoy coffee in the crisp London mornings or having a drink in the evening before a night out .The service of the hotel was just outstanding, it was very English slightly formal but extremely friendly . 
I specially want to mention Ms Alice Orru who seemed perfect for her position , she really become our personal friend at the hotel and was an email or phone call away with any help we needed . Take a bow Alice you did your hotel proud ,
The rooms were meticulously serviced twice a day by the very efficient house keeping staff , Being a Hyatt Globalist we had breakfast at the lounge every day and the only thing I would like to comment is that the food is exactly the same everyday and the menu needs variation . We stay at the Grand and Park Hyatt’s specially in Asia and lounge food is a little more varied and better .
There are numerous pubs and restaurants close to the hotel . Public transport is right at the hotel doorstep,The location is without a doubt probably the best in London , we had stayed at some of the well known hotels on park lane on previous visits but they have nothing on the Hyatt Churchill, be it service and specially location . Needless to stay we never moved to our Airbnb apt. 
We plan to visit London next summer again and my wife keeps reminding me to make our reservation early and if possible get the same room ( I think it was 902).

If one plans to visit London be it for a night or 15 , there is no point looking beyond this hotel,

Well done Hyatt Churchill and hope to see you next summer! ",5,2018,11,08
150,Nice family dinner at Montague Churchill Hyatt Regency,"Busy Saturday evening, where we are going to dine?
Excellent restaurant- relaxing atmosphere!
Superb service, rich wine list!
After the dinner- whisky and cigar/ who likes/ at perfect Churchill bar! Outstanding end of a really busy week!",5,2018,11,06
150,Beautiful hotel centrally located,Great location for access to most if not all the terrific sites have to offer.  It houses a beautiful bar that you can sit for hours and watch the human traffic.  Good drinks and a nice but short menu of food.  Every staff person was helpful and pleasant.,5,2018,11,03
150,Located Near Shopping,"My husband and I spent five nights last week at the Hyatt Regency Churchill. 

Positives: Friendly check-in staff. Location within short walking distance to Oxford Street shopping. Really nice “garden”-themed restaurant in the lobby with exquisite menu and outstanding service. Helpful gentleman at concierge desk. Very clean rooms and common areas, with outstanding housekeeping staff. Food quality and selection in the Regency Club. 

Neutral: Room size, decor. Value for price. Doorman.

Negative: Just my impression, but the hotel appears to cater largely to a Middle Eastern clientele. In the Club Lounge, they were often loud (on speakerphone), demanding of the attendants, and smelled strongly of perfume. The gentleman who was the Club concierge appeared to go out of his way to fulfill their requests, but when we asked if he could store our bags for one day while we took a trip out to Bath, he refused. These cons made us feel uncomfortable and we will find a different hotel when we return to London.",4,2018,11,02
150,A 5 star stay- again!,"We have stayed in high end properties all over London for 3 decades. Last year we tried the Churchill after a poor Marriott Park Lane experience. What a difference.
We returned this year for an 8 day stay that was as excellent as last year .
Laurent, the general manager, has his team 
working together to provide top notch service throughout.
Combine a great hotel with an interesting neighborhood and excellent public transport nearby - you have the perfect place to stay in central London.
We certainly hope to return next year.",5,2018,10,30
150,A one of a kind experience,"It was my first stay at The Churchill. I was impressed by the efficiency and friendliness at the check in desk however, when I mentioned that my daughter would be joining me, to my surprise and appreciation, chocolates were delivered to my room with a card that wished us a great father and daughter time! It is such personalised experience that sets The Churchill apart from the others! Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2018,10,30
150,Montagu Restaurant Sunday Brunch,"The service was absolutely excellent.  Thank you to Ella who was so attentive.  Food was very good although we have noticed that there is much less choice on the Brunch than previously.  However, presentation and quality were very good.  Excellent value for money.",4,2018,10,28
150,Stay at the Churchill,"The Churchill is a wonderful place to stay, my wife and I have just returned from a 15 day vacation spent in London at the Churchill. Everything about this hotel gets a rating of 10 on a 10 scale, the staff really not themselves out to make our visit a pleasant one.The food in both the restaurant and in their club the room was top-of-the-line. The room itself was great,the only potentially negative was the combination tub and shower was not easy to get in and out of.",5,2018,10,26
150,Good location for shopping  But very snobby staff,"Not good but not bad,  I am a very loyal Hyatt customer.  Multiple stays around the world.  This one I felt really dropped the ball.  I just did not feel welcome at the property.  Check in was cumbersome, and I was never acknowledged as a Hyatt elite member",3,2018,10,25
150,Exceeded Expectations,"Our recent experience during a seven night stay exceeded the expectations I had formed after reading the glowing reviews of this hotel.

Best features---large comfortable rooms so quiet we didn't hear people in the halls or in adjacent rooms, no noise from the street or from the heating/cooling system, housekeeping that worked to our schedule, a great location near Oxford Street shopping and Marble Arch and Bond Street underground stations, an excellent restaurant and very helpful front desk staff, housekeeping staff and bellmen.

For balance, here are the biggest negatives we found:  The men at the concierge desk proved singularly unhelpful on several occasions.  The electrical system is goofy---we brought UK adapters and a power converter but could not power up in the bathroom. The fitness room is relatively small and gets hot without good ventilation.  There are three treadmills, two bikes, a couple of ellipticals and free weights.   Plenty of towels, water and wipe down tissues.

Overall, we would return here in a minute if ever back in London.  Its pricey, but we found that we got value for our money.
",5,2018,10,24
150,Best hotel in London,"We visit London regularly and know London and it’s hotels well. We have been to many London hotels but his was by far the best.
The staff were extremely friendly and nothing was any trouble. Breakfast is wonderful. Walking distance to he main shopping areas. The room was very modern and comfortable. There are reminders of Churchill everywhere which make one smile. Great food, wine and staff to take care for your every need. My wife left driving licence in the safe. It arrived at our home a few days later with no fuss.
This is the one London hotel I could really recommend. Cannot wait to return.
",5,2018,10,23
150,Delectable Brunch,"The Hyatt Regency London serves and amazing brunch with wonderful service and an eclectic food variety in a friendly, comfortable atmosphere.  Bottomless drinks with live music in central location.  I highly recommend this establishment and will definitely return again upon my next visit to London. ",5,2018,10,21
150,"Great Location, Great Hotel","Hotel has be totally updated and all modern conveniences.  Only a five minute walk to the Marble Arch Tub on the central line (that is very important becasue the traffic in Lonodon is impossible and even the Taxis don't want to take you to certain tourist places.  If you like shopping, the hotel is in a perfect location.  Also, many restaurants in the area.",5,2018,10,18
150,The Hyatt never fails and my stay at the The Churchill made it even better.,"This Hyatt is located in a perfect area for shopping, walking and access to all types of transportation.  I am already planning a return to London and will definitely stay at The Churchill again.  The staff was generous with their time and attentiveness with great sincerity.",5,2018,10,18
150,Best place relax in London,Convenient location in the center of London. Close to underground Marble Arch. Walking distance to Hyde Park and Oxford Circus. Old traditional building with modern equipment. It was my first experience where washlet was placed. Restaurant serves British specialities as well as Italian cooking style food. Enjoy stat at Hyatt Regency Churchill.,5,2018,10,17
150,One choice,It is always hard to pick your hotel in London due to the high competion in all segments so usually location becames a first choice. Hyatt falls into this strategy which means that if want to be in this area it us a choice but I will not booked on other purposes. It is a fair property but no thrills.,4,2018,10,17
150,"Outstanding first class property, could be a park hyatt","Delightful 4 nights tourist visit.  On par with experiences at Park Hyatt Beaver Creek & Aviara, this is a flagship property for the Regency brand.

Property is lovely & every interaction with staff was top notch.",5,2018,10,16
150,Overall nice stay with some small issues,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 5 nights, travelling with as 3 couples.
Pros:
- The location is really really fantastic. We've stayed in other hotels in London, and I am a big fan of the Marylebone and Mayfair areas, mostly because they are well located. The Hyatt Regency was one of the best positioned hotels we've stayed in. It's a 4 min walk to Hyde Park, a one minute walk to Oxford street and there is a bus stop and tube station within 3 mins walk.

- The room itself is very large for London standards. Our room had been recently refurbished and we had a Kind Bed with Park views. Our bed was extremely comfortable, the rain shower was lovely (no bath, but that was fine for us), the toilet was one with a seat heater and other gadgets if you were so inclined, and there was a blue tooth speaker in the room to play music on. The amenities are from Pharmacopia and were really nice.

- We had lunch at The Churchill Bar on one day, beautiful setting and in this particular bar the service was really good. The food was also of a high quality, but unfortunately the prices are ridiculous.

CONS:
- Our room was only serviced once a day. Personally, in a hotel of this standard, I feel a turndown service is a must. Also, our room was only serviced after lunch which is also really late in my opinion. 

- My husband and I felt there was a lack of cupboard space - we struggled to unpack all of our clothing for 5 days in what we were provided with. (No, we didn't pack an unreasonable amount of clothing either :) 

- The service in the restaurant is a disaster. Unbelievably slow, to the point where after two attempts to have a drink/ coffee there, we gave up entirely and didn't go back for the rest of the stay.

- We had lunch in The Churchill bar as mentioned above, and whilst it is a lovely setting, it's certainly not value for money - our cocktails were being charged at 17GBP per glass.

- We didn't get breakfast in our package as we felt it was particularly expensive. We had a look at the breakfast offering on one morning, thinking we may just add it on, and I'm glad we decided against the breakfast. It looked alright, but we certainly found better quality and value for money at a host of cafe's and restaurants around us.

- I'm a bit of a stickler for the details. Not one person greeted us by name during our stay, and whilst we always had a smile from the staff, I've had better, more personal service from a number of other hotels in London. I wouldn't say the service was remarkable, just the bare minimum for us not to be unhappy.

- Its very much a business hotel. This wont be an issue for some, and may be for others. If you're looking for a hotel whilst you're in London on business, this is the place. If like us you are visiting for leisure, its a good hotel, but just be aware that there will most likely be conferences happening in the hotel which makes it very busy.

Overall, I'd go back for the location and the rooms, but I'd need to adjust my expectations on service and their hotel pricing for drinks and food.",4,2018,10,14
150,Nightmare service,I was there for 2 nights with my fiancé on our way to Spain. After traveling for 14 hours from San Francisco. I wanted to get my suit pressed because during travel it be became wrinkled. The promised 4 hour turn around time for pressing of my suit. after about 9 hours I called the front desk for my suit to be returned to me. After about 4 call and back and fourth they came to my door. The handed me some other poor guys pants and tie (I didn’t give them a tie). Then they proceded to tell me that the vallet does remember me givin her a suit at all!! So about an hour later I get a know on my door and there is the suit. The tag had 2 different room numbers on it. At this point I didn’t care we were just waiting for the suit so I could wear the jacket out to dinner. When I took the paper wrapping off I noticed 3 holes in the collar! I immediately call the front desk and someone came to look at it. They stated the super visor would call me about it after 2 more Calls to them I got a hold of some one...when stated the manager would call me in the Morin’s and there was nothing they could so about it now. At this point I made it apparent that my suit was purchased for 1000 usd an was new. The offered us dinner which was a nice gesture but was by no means a resolution to the problem at hand. At this point it was almost midnight so we missed our reservation and we decided to stay in. In the morning when we were leaving the manager of laundry came by and gave me a fake story about how she personally pressed the suit and allthough she didn’t see the holes inn them she doesn’t know how they got there but states there was no way she could have made them. And then proceeds to try to tell me the jacket was wrinkled??? Like some how a wrinkled jacket must have holes in them? From this point we went to check out and requested to speak to the manager about my suit jacket. he basically told us well we gave you a free dinner!! It wasn’t free we had a 75 credit that came with our booking so we actually paid for it with our credit!! The just denied any wrong doing refused to let us speak to the hotel manager and basically forced out the hotel!! I would suggest you avoid this hotel if you want a place that is professional and will take accountability when they make a mistake. They ruin what was supposed to be a fun night out in London! I’m still waiting for that call from the hotel manager that they promised me(it’s been a month).,2,2018,10,14
150,Exceptional London Experience,Hyatt Churchill was a fantastic experience - this busy hotel still managed to make me feel welcome.  I booked a Regency level room and it did not disappoint - newly renovated and quite lovely - bed was so comfy and bath beautiful - with a view of the London cityscape... perfect.  The Regency lounge was large and the food excellent - the folks in charge were diligent about keeping the food fresh and hot where needed.  Breakfast options included hot and cold items - all good especially the eggs and pastries... the evening fare is literally a meal plus the staff brings out hot small bites and walk the room to serve them.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will return!,5,2018,10,14
150,"Will come back, hope the hotel remember their loyal customer :-)","Breakfast good, the bell staff very friendly. The gym is superb but a bit small. Location is the best as it is near Oxford Street and easy to find a good restaurant nearby. The only issue is that sometimes the reception staff didn't remember me. i have been staying at the Hotel more than 10 times already and the Hotel still not remember me. During check in they simply said they cant find my booking. Hope they can improve on that",5,2018,10,13
150,20th Wedding Anniversary - Stop 3 - London,"The third stop on an around the world trip for 20th wedding anniversary and catching up with the original wedding party.  

Hotel booked using Hyatt frequent Traveller points and this is second visit to the hotel - last in 2014 when we got upgraded to a Club Room - so they told me on check in.  

Arrived super early before 7am and checked in.  Room was not ready and housekeeping did not start until 7am so they said they would call - we freshened up and went out for breakfast.  No phone call at 11am so made way back to hotel and room was ready when we checked again with Front Desk.  

Front desk told us bags were already in room - not the case and required two phone calls and a trip downstairs to track them down.  

Rooms are generous for London and we had a room facing the street but despite this no traffic noise.  Location is the primary driver and ability to walk to major shopping and attractions.

We didn't get any room service or use the lobby bar downstairs though it was often busy both day and night.

Front desk staff good but parking/concierge staff feel more like security than hotel customer service - they could smile a bit more and welcome guests back in the evening.

Different trip to last time, quality of room and hotel good but given not a Club Room felt no particular difference being a long time Hyatt member and a normal person who booked for the first time.",4,2018,10,09
150,Excellent Location,"Hyatt Churchill good and comfortable place to stay, close to Museums, Hyde Park, Bond Street and Gallery Zone, only oneblock away from the famous Selfridges & Co. Department Store and Oxford Street.and Restaurants and Galleries Mayfair Area",5,2018,10,08

150,Superb location,Great location. Super super friendly staff. Very helpful concierge and actually everyone in the reception. . Rooms are a bit small and the bathroom is quite outdated. I liked the lobby but the interior of the rooms are not impressive at all. The TV didn't work they offered to fix it  but we just didn't have time to follow up with the house keeping and the AC was soooo cold even when it was off.in general it's quite over priced as the facilities are not functioning very well which made me think that it's time for renovation.,4,2018,10,07
150,Amazing luxury,I have never stayed in a hotel so plush! The rooms were comfortable and the service was outstanding. The breakfast buffet was quite extensive and the food was great. There was a park across the street for airing my service dog.,5,2018,10,07
150,"Perfect stay - Good Location, Service and Value","The service at this Hyatt Regency is exactly the kind of service that keeps one loyal to the brand.  

Booked an executive club access room.

Arrived extremely early, was greeted immediately and made to feel welcome.  My room was not ready yet, which was no surprise since it was hours until time for guest to even check out.  My luggage was quickly stored and I was given access to the executive lounge to get refreshed and organized for the day.  

I had a full day of activities returning to the hotel mid-afternoon. Reception staff recognized me by name and delivered my key. My luggage had already been delivered to my room.  The room size is on the compact side, but very efficiently arranged.  Very clean, quite and comfortable.

Executive lounge staff were welcoming and efficient.  

The location of the hotel is perfect for site seeing and shopping and in a safe neighborhood for walking. Very convenient to Paddington Station for onward travel as well.",5,2018,10,07

150,Great for Selfridges Shopping trips,A practical and central hotel for London shopping trips which is clean and efficient.  We stay often as close to many sites and beautiful walking all in close proximity. You can ask for a key to the green park it overlooks and get a taste of classic London green blocks which is great for some time out with children and morning yoga stretches. ,4,2018,10,05
150,Terrible room,"As soon as we arrived to the room I just could not believe it. It is so small that there is no place to put the luggage , and they call this a king room!!
Besides, the carpet is in terrible shape ... this is not a 5 star hotel! 
I call the manager, Mr Vincent , who very kindly said that he was very sorry, but there is nothing he can do for me, because the hotel was full.... that he will try to find another room tomorrow! But when you are in London for two nights you don’t want to loose your time changing from one room to the other!!!!
The solution they gave us is to adjust the price of the room....
And they will change us tomorrow!!! This means that if you don’t complain you will be charge the price of a larger room for this mini room

What a lucky break with my booking though! 

Fantastic location, extremely friendly and attentive staff from all areas, lovely room (a little small but very nicely decorated) and not a peep of noise from any adjacent rooms or the corridor.

I will 100% stay here again and recommend to friends and family.

150,Location is Great...the rest...not so much,"Staying at the Churchill Hyatt which has a great location on the Central Line near Marble Arch. The basic rooms are good...nice shower and heated toilet. While here one of the elevators has been out of service so getting to the room floors (elevators required for safety purposes) was a chore...long wait lines in the evenings was constant as many people where returning from a day of city happenings. The staff was great, but the food in the restaurant is just ok, and for the price not the best value.",3,2018,09,23
150,Wake up call ...be careful,"Hotel is good, location is very nice. The bar is very nice and the bar people are super in making your drink. The staffs are very friendly in the bar & in restaurant and you wont be too happy with the reception staff. They are not well experience (at least some of them). I have bad experience with wake up call request. Staff won't brief the hotel amenities or your booking facilities etc. very well at the time of check-in, so remember to ask what you need to know. If you have strict schedule in the morning, please make sure to have more option to get up on time, don't 100% depend  reception staff  to wake you up or wake up call request to call you, it may or may not work for you.",4,2018,09,22

150,A Welcoming Upscale Experience,The Hyatt Regency Churchill is our favorite luxury hotel in London for the simple fact that the staff welcome us back as if we were family.

150,Nice stay,A good hotel that is very centrally located.  Housekeeping was excellent. The bar well stocked with an exceptional range of cocktails and very accomplished bar staff. Reception was efficient and helpfully.,5,2018,09,18
150,Unremarkable stay,"I was expecting a lot from this property considering its location and prices. Instead, what I got was a completely impersonal and unremarkable stay. The Executive Regency Club was closed and only the Club that allowed families was open. Changed to another hotel.",2,2018,09,18

150,Convenient Location,"I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Marble Arch and Oxford St.  The hotel itself is quite nice with friendly, professional staff.  I appreciated having 2 complimentary bottles of water in the room each day.  

We had the continental breakfast in the restaurant off of the lobby.  Nice selection of pastries, fruits and juices.  The coffee was bitter, but a little sugar and cream fixed that.",4,2018,09,16
150,Beautiful Hotel Situated Near Hyde Park,"This hotel just screamed elegance and class. We stayed at The Churchill for two days and we enjoyed each night. 

Our hotel room had a lovely view of Hyde Park. The staff was more than pleasant and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was a positive one. The room itself was clean and pristine, and the beds and pillows were perfect to sink into after a long day of exploring the city of London. 

The location of the hotel itself is enough to stay there, only being a couple blocks from shops and restaurants and city landmarks such as the Marble Arch (which is also a stop on several lines of the Hop On Hop Off). 

I will certainly stay here again the next time I visit my home-away-from-home of London!",5,2018,09,11
150,Love everything about this hotel,"I love the location of this hotel. Not far from the tube or Hyde Park.   And my room was on the second floor which was recently renovated.  They did a great job. I have stayed here before would defintely stay here again.  Breakfast was marvelous.  Great variety of different choices.  The concierge, who was of Indian descent, gave me a great tip on an Indian restaurant. Best Indian food I’ve ever had.  You can’t go wrong staying here.",5,2018,09,11
150,Great week end,"Great hotel, short walk from Seldfridges and Marble Arch, 2 steps to Oxford St. You,ll really feel welcome, as from the doorman to the room maid, everybody is helpful beyond expectations. Nice Club Lounge too.",5,2018,09,11
150,This place was awesome!,We visited London for a show in Hyde Park and the location of this hotel could not have been better.  The underground is very close for destinations that are not within a quick walk from this hotel.  The rooms and halls are very modern and clean.  We were very pleased with the size of our room.,5,2018,09,09
150,Nice location,Stayed here for 4 nights with tour group so did not choose this particular hotel.  Checked in very early after overnight flight. As expected room was not ready but we were assured that they would call us as soon as room became available.  We went to brunch around the corner and did some site seeing. Never received said call. Finally checked with hotel late afternoon. Room was standard. Bathroom had shower only.  Beds were very comfortable. Had a roll away bed which was also very comfortable even for an adult. Breakfast buffet was included for our group and was extensive but they had the same items every day. Service was excellent. The only negatives were the large amount of families staying in hotel and kids on our floor running up and down the hall and slamming doors and people talking in the hall on cell phones. Also it was very hot while we were there and AC seemed to be turned off at night no matter what temp we set it on. (It was cold during the day) Hotel is in nice location for site seeing. Easy to access tube and many stores and restaurants.,4,2018,09,05

150,It’s 7-Star Service on a 5-star scale!,"The Hyatt Regency London Churchill was our home base for 4-nights in London & is exactly what you would expect from Hyatt. 

Great room, small bathroom with heated toilet seat 😊 a desk and great staff. 

It’s a great location just 2-3 blocks from Hyde Park’s Marble Arch surrounded by restaurants and shops. 

We were fortunate to have access to their Regency Lounge offering breakfast 7-11, beverages & snacks 11:30-5:00 and Canapés from 5:30-7:30 PM. We had access based on our Hyatt Rewards standing but it is available for a fee to all guests, I believe. The evening offering was more than sufficient as our evening meal. 

When making our reservation I asked for suggestions for sight seeing & mentioned it was our 1st trip to London and that this was a celebration of our anniversary. I did not receive any feedback on sights but we were very pleasantly surprised to find a bottle on ice, glasses & a Happy Anniversary Dessert in our room the first evening when we returned to our room. Very, very thoughtful! ",5,2018,08,31
150,"Nice room, good location, friendly staff, but mildew in the shower","Nice hotel in a great location. Room was recently renovated. Received complementary roll-away bed for our six year old child. Organic shampoos were wonderful. On the downside, our bathroom shower had mildew. Manager offered lounge access for free on next visit. But probably won't be able to use because this was a one time holiday vacation. Also there is no swimming pool and no business center, so I had no way to work after our son went to sleep.",4,2018,08,30
150,Nice and Cozy at the heart of Oxford Street,"We stayed here for six days during the second leg of our London trip. And boy! We loved the hotel so much that can’t wait to visit again. 
The location steals the show. A stone’s throw from the Marble arch and just a couple of blocks from the buzzing Oxford Street, the Churchill is quietly tucked away in a nice and cozy corner just across the Portman Square. A number of underground stations (nearest being the Marble Arch) provide ease of access to every part of London. 
We loved the family room, which were close to 300 sq ft and good enough to relax after spending the day time in the famed neighbourhood.
Strongly recommend for people who just want to soak up the atmosphere and energy around Oxford Street, Hyde Park and Mayfair neighbourhood.

150,Below expectations,"Room was good
Bathroom was tight and small
Shower drain was not working well with some molds at the edges

AC was hot.. I called and after 5 visits from the engineer it was ok

Had a fire alarm and call for evacuation then reassured that it was false then another two alarms and call for evacuation !! .. it was very confusing to everybody. We ask the reception to clarify and send a second message to assure people that the two following alarms were also false but never happened !! As I understood supervisor refused!! 

View was bad .. you only see the roof of other buildings. They call it standard room view!

Staff were nice and very welcoming. Need to increase the number of experienced staff at the reception as I noticed them getting tense and panic with regular situations. They have to call the supervisor for minor issues. 

expensive

150,First Trip to London !,Concierge is exceptional with excellent guidance and advice. Staff is very pleasing and tries to meet your every need. Meals are wonderful and you are treated with the upmost respect.  Room maids are very understanding of all your needs. Only negative is the lack of a full glass tub enclosure and the safety for seniors. ,4,2018,08,27
150,Hostile Environment,"The Hyatt is a very nice hotel with an exceptional staff.  The Regency Club is well appointed with very good food and a very nice staff.  However my stay was a nightmare due to the majority of other guests staying in the hotel. It was overrun with loud, ill mannered and self absorbed adults.  Children were permitted to run, scream, act out and even ride scooters in the lobby.  There are 2 separate Regency Club areas.  One is supposedly a business lounge with a nobody under age 12 policy.  The other is a family lounge.  The family lounge was out of the question due to the constant presence of large family groups who had no interest in acting in a polite and civil manner.  The business lounge was often occupied by groups of men shouting on cell phones which were constantly ringing.  Often there were children in the business lounge.  The Regency Club lounge staff were terrific but simply cowered in the face of a seemingly impossible situation. Elevators were frequently held on floors by guests who were waiting for other family members to arrive.  At check in times the Regency Club lobby sometimes had 30 people with piles of luggage and children running amok.  While I loved the hotel itself as well as its terrific location I would never stay there again.",3,2018,08,24

150,Nice hotel in a great location,"The hotel is well maintained; though the room was quite small.  The excellent location, near Oxford Street shopping and restaurants, Marble Arch and the tube, made up for this.  The daily breakfast buffet was great offering fresh fruit, and a good variety of hot and cold food options.  Room amenities including toiletries, ironing board / iron and hair dryer were good to have.",4,2018,08,21
150,The place I love to stay,"I always stay in it due to its location, friendly staff, and high class room. What I like is the continuous improvement of the hotel facilities. Comparing the price of the room with the value of it, it seems reasonable The only negative things is the size of the rooms",4,2018,08,21
150,Wonderful property & staff - but flawed execution,"The Churchill has been my hotel of choice for at least a dozen of my trips to London; there are many factors that bring me back each time including the fantastic location, the reasonable price and the excellent staff.  And that final point - the staff - is really a major contributing factor.  The staff, especially those in the Regency Club, are always friendly, accommodating and incredibly helpful.  So thank you to the staff there who always do a fantastic job!  Cheers!

The rooms at the hotel haven't changed much since I started frequenting the hotel back in 2012.  I believe that the hotel was undergoing a renovation of all rooms, however, I don't think I've ever stayed in a room that has been renovated.  Having said that, on this most recent visit - I stayed in a Balcony Suite.  Unfortunately, the suite had some shortcomings - these are trivial items, but worth mentioning.  The balcony - while lovely and features a nice view of Portman Square and the BT Tower - really wasn't a balcony where a couple could enjoy a cocktail.  The balcony features a walled edge that's too high to see over if you're sitting down.  And if you're sitting down, there isn't much space as the balcony is too narrow.  So the additional expense for the balcony really wasn't worth the upgrade.  Additionally, the closet was just too small - and hidden behind the bathroom door.  Meaning if you want to access the closet, you have to close the bathroom - and even then, each side of the closet is so small, there is barely room for a week's worth of clothing.  Finally, the mattress was just terrible.  I don't know when it was last replaced, but both sides were sunken in.  The middle of the mattress (where clearly no one has even slept) was just fine - but thus created a pyramid like shape to the bed, where each of us would slip off the side if we weren't holding onto each other in the middle. 

But the issue that was most disappointing was the experience in the Regency Club lounge.  I do want to make it clear that the food, the beverages, the staff - all were absolutely wonderful.  It was the atmosphere created by other guests that were the issue - and it's something that hotel management should address.  Every time I visited the club during the evening service hours, the club was overrun by the same 8-10 male guests.  Each of them had multiple cell phones - and all of them had their ringers on and at full volume.  And every single one of these men would take loud phone calls over and over in the lounge.  Additionally, each of these men would take over tables and areas meant for 4 or more people.  They would then fix themselves 6-8 FULL plates of food and leave them for guests they would host in the lounge for business meetings.  They were absolutely obnoxious - so loud, toxic, insulting and rude to the staff and compulsively unaware of ruining the lounge experience for anyone else.  I travel the globe, professionally and personally, and have never been in a lounge that was so inhospitable.  I do not know why the hotel doesn't institute even the most basic of guidelines including ""turn off your cell phone, take your calls outside the lounge, and the lounge is for guests only - if you need a space for business meetings, please use a conference room.""  By the 4th night, I stopped going to the lounge.  It was so awful, I would rather buy food & drinks elsewhere and waste the money I had spent to receive lounge access.  I don't know that I would return to the hotel unless some basic guidelines to ensure that ALL lounge guests are able to enjoy a relaxing glass of wine in peace and quiet.

One other side note ... there was a large family that was staying in a room on our floor.  They propped open their hotel room door every day, all day.  Their room smelled, and there were always people in and out of the room. They had multiple children, who were allowed to run up and down the halls of the 9th floor.  Sometimes, the patriarchs of the family would just sit out in the lobby area and stare at guests as they come and go.  I don't know if the hotel staff was aware and cared - but it was creepy and weird.  I felt very unsettled having to walk by them staring at me each time I came and went from my room.",4,2018,08,20
150,Regular stop when in London,When we are travelling through London we always stay here.   The service is excellent and the staff always remember us.   Great location for Oxfors Street shopping and taxis readily available and not far from Weste End theatres.,4,2018,08,16
150,Awesome location/perfect for business ,Blocks away from hyde park and the regency club is amazing. All the staffs are warm and professional. Breakfast at the club is not that good. Overall is a great hotel for business travellers. Concierge staffs are super efficient.,4,2018,08,14
150,"Always my favourite hotel in London, Hyatt Regency the Churchill","Hyatt Regency the Churchill has been my favourite hotel in London for seven years now. I stayed at the Churchill several times, and I have been happy with my stay each single time. I was there for 4 nights in August 2018. Great staff, great room (King Portman Square View), good breakfast (nice continental breakfast and very attentive staff). Special thanks go to Davis, who was so kind to adjust the temperature in the gym, so I could have good workouts very early in the mornings. I didn't have dinners at the restaurant, but I tried it last time I was there, and it was delicious. Italian chefs are always the best! Thank you Hayatt for making my stays in London so good. And see you soon!",5,2018,08,13
150,Great London Trip,"Great London stay.  The hotel is located with easy access to all the sites.  Easy to access the metro and bus lines.  In a nice walkable neighborhood and good eating establishments close by.  Very friendly staff.  Clean, exceptional rooms and quiet.",5,2018,08,12
150,In professional staff.,Overall a bad experience bad staff quality I guess cheaper staff hired due to ncreasing cost issues. If anyone is genuinely bothered can call me post 15th August on +971506545570. Regards Manish Agarwal ,1,2018,08,07
150,Modern and Beautiful Hotel with real Style,Great location and service. I love staying here - rooms excellent and the service great. It was too short a visit however and would love to return. This hotel had a massive asset in terms of its management previously and it seems to have continued in his absence.,5,2018,08,07
150,4 stays in 6 months all were excellent,"The Churchill is not the newest and it is worn in parts in the rooms. However the location is great for London and the service is always first rate. Over the years we have stayed here many times, four times since January alone and usually for a week or longer at a time. It has become something of our London home, the club lounge makes it so and the club’s staff are all wonderful. Other hotel s might or newer or swankier but I doubt any other hotel could perform so well so consistently.",5,2018,08,06
150,Excellent,"My family of 6 stayed here in two separate rooms.  Although we weren't next door to each other, we were separated by one room.  Which was a bit annoying.  The hotel is super clean and beautiful.  Its location is very close to Oxford Street as well as easy access to the Underground.  Breakfast was amazing every morning and the staff extremely attentive.  But the biggest stand out was the gentleman that greeted us as we arrived in our taxi.  My youngest has thrown up (got car sick) on the way from the airport.  He was so kind to her and empathic of my frustration and embarrassment.  The whole time we were there he would always ask ""How is the princess feeling today?""  I would stay here again and highly recommend.",5,2018,08,06
150,Polite and professional staff... clean and nice hotel,"The hotel was very nice and the staff was very polite and professional.   I will return to this hotel the next time I am in London.  The location was very convenient.  Walking distance to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and all the big tourist attractions, but also convenient to the tube.   ",5,2018,08,05
150,Thank you very much,It was very nice hotel in London every thing is very nice clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful and very good food and very good service and very good place . I will come again to this hotel ,5,2018,08,03
150,Great Hotel- Location and Staff both Exceptional!!!!,"My husband and I visited London, along with our 20 month old son, back in April. We were so glad to have selected this hotel. It surpassed our expectations. After traveling overnight, we arrived at the hotel in the morning around 8am. Exhausted, hungry, and in need of both a nap and a shower, the hotel staff check us in, and did everything they could to help us get settled quickly. Especially traveling with a small child, they saw to it that we had a crib delivered right away, and got him some milk as well. This hotel is in a great locatio- near many attractions, within walking distance. From this hotel we walked to the London Zoo by way of Regents Park. We were able to spend some time just enjoying a beautiful little oasis in the middle of the city. We would definitely stay here again!
",5,2018,08,03
150,Brilliant,"A brilliant hotel, luxurious and it sytlish, very friendly and police helpful staff, great food and huge breakfast selection, ideally located behind oxford street, walking distance to selfridges and all the other outlets and restaurants.",5,2018,07,27
150,Great hotel ,We stayed here in 2015 while the hotel was being renovated.  Place is beautiful.  Location is excellent.   Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Rooms are well appointed and spacious.  Walking distance to shopping and food.,5,2018,07,24
150,A great hotel but could be so much more,"Hyatt Churchill is a great hotel and it’s location is close to all the major tourist venues. Onsite bar and restaurants are superb.  It’s my favorite hotel in central London.  

Rooms are well appointed and hotel staff are very helpful.  Housekeeping is fast and do an amazing job.  Guest room windows open up to allow fresh air in!  An added plus, the hotel is very quiet at night time and you never hear the guests in the rooms next door.

Now the bad news, if you upgrade or book for the Regency Club, you will be greatly disappointed.  It’s small and offers a meger selection of breakfast items and even smaller choice of snacks in the night.   Several occasions we found only empty food platters as the staff could not keep up with demand.  

Also, club staff needs to do a much (much) better job at managing guests who have noisy children that are left to run and shout...would be nice to ban children from the club altogether.

If not for the poor experience in the Regency Club, the hotel would have received an “excellent” rating but alas when spending £600 per night I expect better, so they earned an “average”.",3,2018,07,19
150,Great location,"The hotel's location may be one of the best things about it for me, a walk away from Oxford Street and many other wonderful historical sites. Service is excellent and the staff are especially courteous and helpful. Overall good experience.",4,2018,07,18
150,Well known Brand Name Hotel with poor management,"I have checked in At HYATT REGENCY LONDON- THE CHURCHILL on July 02, 2018 at approximately 1700hrs.
I had given a room No. 414 at the fourth floor.
At 2300hrs on the same arrival day I discovered that the room I was given is twin beds combined together with a top cover to become one single bed(photos taken). At the same time, I communicated the issue with the reception and I was promised that the issue to be solved next day. On July 03, 2018 around 1600hrs I talked to the hotel management again concerning the issue that I have trying to get the room category that I booked for with no success. They insist that this is the right room categorized by the hotel management as king size bed room. During this time the hotel management, Mr. MARCIN BIELINSKI hotel guest service manager, is trying to push me to accept the present situation as it’s giving no further options. Finally, After long term annoying discussion with everyone, they changed the room to king size bed(room 825).
During the whole above situation Hotel management was dealing with my issue very notability and without even courtesy. It’s a very strange feelings to receive such negative attitude from a such WELL KNOWN BRAND NAME (HYATT).
The Churchill London ",2,2018,07,16
150,"High quality, good serice, breakfast can feel crowded and rushed","The staff provides good service, the location is excellent and the quality is about what I'd expect.  My only complaint is how crowded breakfast is and how rushed you feel to eat something and get out of there.  It's not what you'd expect for the price.  I usually eat elsewhere, like a local coffee shop, for a fraction of the price and a more relaxed environment.  ",4,2018,07,16
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill,"Centrally located, cordial staff, clean place, Jacopo and Waris were very helpful throughout our stay. For me concierge plays an important role and this hotel has one of the best concierge. Highly recommended",5,2018,07,15
150,Excellent Home Base in London,"Close to all you need to be a tourist in London!  Marble Arch Underground is a few blocks away.  Shopping and Selfridges within a couple minutes from hotel.  Taxi and Uber almost instantly there when needed.  
Hotel staff extremely helpful and friendly.  Rooms were clean and well kept.  Housekeeping comes late morning and leaves plenty of amenities that are needed.  
Rooms are smaller than what you expect in the US, but more than enough room for our family of three. 
Good food options at hotel, and many others all within walking distance from hotel as well.  
In the Hyatt family, definitely on the upper end of the better/best Hyatts!",5,2018,07,15
150,regular customer,"I cannot resist the attraction to this hotel, always come back, even though I have tried others in London, the location is superb, vary close to almost every things(oxford St, marble arch, Hyde park and tube)
I will come back again",5,2018,07,14
150,2nd trip back to London,"The Hyatt Regency Churchill once again knocks it out of the park.  This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this location and cannot say enough great things about this property.  We brought our younger daughter with us this time and the hotel made accomadations for us.  It was very busy this time of year but still quiet and a great location.  We were able to walk, catch the Tube, and make our way around the city with this as our base point.  Only sorry we weren't able to stay a few days longer.  Can't wait to return!!",5,2018,07,12
150,Lovely but room service disappointing,"The room was lovely and clean and the location was perfect for shopping and walking around in a beautiful neighborhood. 

We ordered room service both mornings for breakfast as we usually do and found that the second day our bread basket was half the size without the croissants, jams were not served, The tobasco we asked twice for was forgotten, salt and peppar were not served and for £75 2 omellettes, a selection of fruit, a bread basket and some juice and a coffee we could have had slightly better service.  Considering that the first day we ordered the same food and had a perfect meal we were very dissapointed with the next meal.

Would recommend the hotel but the room service was a let down. I will be staying there again but I wont be ordering breakfast next time.",3,2018,07,12
150,A gem in quiet residential neighborhood,"This was a special graduation trip for our daughter.  This property is so close to so much (Oxford Street, Hyde Park, etc.), but set in a peaceful upscale residential neighborhood, with easy walk to great local restaurants and Selfridge's/shopping.",5,2018,07,12
150,"Fantastic staff, great food and service","My mom and I stayed in mid June and had a great 5 days.  At first I looked at the instant coffee with doubt... but it was pretty darn good.  The rooms are fine, the location is so close to Hyde Park and other restaurants!  We just walked a few blocks and located great places to eat and shop.  Cabs and Uber were always available.  However, I found the service to be top notch!  From the door man, waiter, front desk etc.  It was my Mom's 80th birthday and we had booked the brunch.  She was not feeling up to par that am so we cancelled.  An hour later, a beautiful platter of sweets with Happy Birthday Paris was delivered to our room.   Mom was in bed.... but I do believe chocolate cured her!  I found the door men went out of their way to help us out and make suggestion what to see and where to go.  One tired night we went to the restaurant and just didn't want a full dinner.  ""No problem""  the earlier bar menu appeared and I got the club sandwich I wanted.  These little things make the difference to me.  The rooms were nice, not 5 star, but i will take 5 star service any time !!  Yes, I will be back and thank you so much for making London my new fav city!!!!",5,2018,07,10
150,"Excellent Location, Service, Food","This hotel is in a fantastic location in a lovely neighborhood that has many shops and restaurants. The Marble Arch tube station is less than a ten minute walk. The staff was efficient and cordial. We ordered room service twice and our meals (sandwiches) arrived in less than 30 minutes. We also enjoyed the Churchill Terrace bar, dinner at Montagu, and the amazing breakfast buffet. Another lovely detail is the infused water (with ice!) that is available in the lobby in the afternoon. Very refreshing after walking around the city on a warm day.The only reason that I did not rate the hotel 5 stars is because the upholstery on one chair in our room was worn and the carpet needed to be stretched b/c there was a bump in the middle of the room. I know that is super picky, but it is the difference between 4.5 stars and 5.0 stars. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2018,07,10
150,Family Vacations,"Very centrally located, 2 mins walk from Selfridges, nice clean rooms, amazing bar, cordial staff. Mr. Jocopo checked us in and it as as swift as it can be, we were there 06:30 am to check-in, other hotels make you wait but he didn't waist a minute. Mr. Waris was there to help us with everything. Everything is just at 5-10 minutes walk, from shopping to food. Highly recommended
",5,2018,07,09
150,Beautiful Hotel/Great Location!,"Stayed here on the first part of a long Europe trip and it was a great way to kick off the trip. It is a very beautiful high-end hotel. The lobby is lovely and the rooms were spotless with a lot of amenities (even heated toilets, ha)

The front desk staff weren’t overly friendly, but they got the job done. 

It’s in a very nice location and close to anything you want to do in London! The breakfast was also really amazing (best I’ve had in London) - tons of options and you can order from the menu as well as have the buffet. Very impressive!",4,2018,07,08
150,"Pleasant stay, great location","We spent four nights here. Rooms appeared to have been recently refurbed in a pleasant neutral palette, were stylish and clean. Bathrooms are very small though. Reception staff were helpful and efficient. Water bottles provided daily were appreciated. Really great location a stone’s throw from M&S and Selfridges and the long Oxford Street shopping strip. Marble Arch tube station around the corner. However be prepared to pay for all that, it is a relatively expensive hotel. Restaurant cluster in Soho about a 20 minute walk. Great breakfast spot two minutes from the hotel worth trying called Daisy Green.",4,2018,07,06
150,Same procedure as every year,"It's already a kind o tradition to stay here, enjoy the location, enjoy the service as Globalist. Previous stays always great, what happend this time: To busy to recognize a returning guest? 
Reception, like always, takes care on your needs, fully booked, some trouble with the original room , a heated toilet seat is the solution. Checking in on 3rd it's not the same like executive 8th floor. You still have free access but elevators are busy too.
In the evening the Bar is closed for privat event so the Pub across the street is the alternative. same procedure? maybe next time...",4,2018,07,05
150,Great hotel in Central London,"The location is great. A fairly quiet square just off Oxford St, and only a few minutes' walk to Marble Arch tube station.

The hotel itself is very modern and well-maintained. Friendly staff. Food and bars are very good, and there's a decent gym.",5,2018,07,03
150,"Excellent customer service and location, reliable and good value","As always The Churchill delivers class and comfort in an overall package that leaves one feeling good about making the choice of staying here.  Breakfast is really nice and the staff in the busy restaurant go out of their way to make one feel looked after. Housekeeping is efficient but needs small reminders to address slightly threadbare towels in the bathroom etc. But once asked, they always ensure your requests are fulfilled. 
Th hotel needs refurbishment, Its a great property sitting in an ideal location and with such excellent service it would be even more of an attraction for travellers if it was redone. The carpets in the corridors had some stains despite the grey and brown colour of the decor, which is a bit depressing as well. The fitting of shower cubicles would be a good idea as I often find the sliding door of tubs with dual shower very risky.
Overall the Churchill is a good spot to stay and does offer  some value for money given the high seasonal rates in London. ",4,2018,07,02
150,I wouldn't stay there again,"the hotel was too old and so are the furniture so it does not deserve the high cost for it. also I have lived a terrifying situation where a ghost was involved where I could not sleep at all and left the room for the whole day , the size of the room I did not like at all  ",1,2018,07,01
150,Location Location Location (and more),"I'm loyal to the Hyatt brand, but even if I wasn't, I would come stay here again!  The location is superb.  You're right in the premier shopping/hotel area and everything is walking or via easy subway access.  The city's nicest hotels are within a few blocks which means you're in the heart of the area with the best restaurants, shops and sites.  

The hotel is very nice and understated.  Rooms are a tad small and I wasn't a huge fan of the shower stall only (no tub), but that is all very common in Europe, so not unusual or a reason not to stay here.  Everything is newer and nicely appointed.  Hotel has a good vibe, even though we didn't spend too much time in the room since we were out and about.  

Hotel staff was great.  Loved the Regency Club - nice breakfast and evening spread  NOTE:  they have things in the back room available upon request only, such as hard boiled eggs.  Staff very accommodating and excellent service in the club.  

Overall, great stay and wouldn't 100% return.  For anyone traveling with kids, they officially limit rooms to only 2-3 people so a family of 4 is unable to book and/or would require a second room which is silly.  We have 4 people, including 2 younger kids with us and we booked the standard King room as 1 adult, 1 child.  The trick was only 2 of us checked in and the others joined us later.  The room worked just fine and we were comfortable.  Bummer they won't allow you to just confirm 2 adults, 2 kids, but we found a way around it if you're discreet and the kids are younger.  This was an issue throughout Europe and we figured out booking as 2 and having the other 2 join a few minutes later worked fine and we had no problems.  I get the need for a suite or 2 rooms if you have teenagers but with young kids, it makes no sense, especially for a shorter stay and if you're traveling light without a ton of bags.  We were hoping for the Hyatt loyalist upgrade which didn't happen (hotel was high occupancy), but they did allow us to check in quite early in the morning upon our arrival following an overnight flight.  

Great hotel and again, location is the best!",5,2018,06,30
150,Very nice,"This hotel has an amazing location ( close to Hyde Park, Oxford Street, London Zoo .. etc) all within 30 min walk, very friendly staff and the family did enjoy that experience, the only down side it was a bit expensive but to be fair it really worth it.",5,2018,06,29
150,Awesome !!,"Had a great stay here for 3 nights end of may................clean spacious comfortable room overlooking Portman Square and all those green trees; great view to wake up to..........staff here was extremely friendly and helpful, especially with getting us around and where we needed to be, always a nice greeting extended to us.............had some excellent lunch at the Montagu so do try if you get the chance (great tomato soup mmmm ) washed down later with a cold beer or 2 out on the patio at the bar...........all in all we had such a great time at this hotel we eagerly anticipate our next visit.......and the location makes it easy to get around town.........",5,2018,06,29
150,Top notch hotel in an excellent location,"The Churchill is a gorgeous hotel in a convenient, yet reasonably low key location.  The staff are excellent, the rooms are gorgeous and if you get a room that includes lounge access, the food and service there are absolutely brilliant.  Also love the Molton Brown toiletries in the bathrooms.",5,2018,06,29
150,Excellent Choice for London,"Attended a small conference held at the Churchill, and the hotel delivered in every respect. Rooms are clean and modern without losing charm; staff is helpful and friendly; and the food and facilities make for a great  meeting space. 
",5,2018,06,29
150,Hyatt Regency- what a waste,"This hotel appears very beautiful. Unfortunately,  that is just a facade. Hospitality is severely lacking in the staff.  If you end to waste your money and get poor service then stay here.  There are much better hotels in London",2,2018,06,28
150,First class service and wonderful place,I spend 2 days in London and have had the pleasure to stay in the Hyatt Regency Churchill. From the first moment until we checked out and left the service was spectacular. I enjoyed every minute in a wonderful place. ,5,2018,06,27
150,Great London Hotel,For a chain hotel it is very well run and very efficient on check in and check out with all done electronically ( apart from picking up and dropping off key!) the rooms are lovely and for London it is great that they have some rooms with balconies. The outside terrace is fantastic and overall service is friendly and efficient including room service,5,2018,06,25
150,Actually a three star hotel,Location wise its one of the best if u have shopping addiction otherwise not worth it. Kept me n my family on diffrent floors for the entire period of my stay. Not value for money......nobody cares for u as this hotel sells because of location n i promisedmyself not to stay here again..........believe me if I compare it to my stay at The Lalit london I will give it 2 star out of 10. Felt foolish for paying double the price.,1,2018,06,24
150,Quality event place,We have organised our board meeting dinner at this hotel. It was a very good choice that we made. Staff and event department was very helpful. We have contacted with them just 5 days before the organisation and they managed to arranged everything according to our needs. Library Suite room is very good for business meetings and events. I highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2018,06,24
150,One of Worst stay of this my trip.,"I went with my family and stayed for three days...
We were allotted room no 514 and 843 almost three floors difference.
I requested them to give us interconnecting rooms or rooms wich were close to each other and kept on waiting for three days and nothing hapnd.
I even asked for rooms on same floor but they did nothing .
Room 843 was old and bathroom was not up to hyatt standard.
Location was ok 
Actually its a three star hotel charging five star rates.
Before this I stayed at The Lalit and my experience for that is ☆☆☆☆☆.",1,2018,06,23

Rooms excellent , Bedding great and comfortable , Easy to Rest Up at the Churchill . The Customer Service is Friendly and so helpful at all times . Breakfast offer as great especially the traditional English Brekky . I would highly recommend the Churchill , close to shopping and it makes you feel like a true Londoner .",5,2018,06,23
150,Perfect,"Recently stayed in the Churchill Hyatt and had an amazing stay. Staff were brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us whether it be in bar/executive lounge or reception. Beds were very comfortable and huge!

150,"SUPERB, STYLISH, CLASSIC, & an AMBIANCE ALL YOU EXPECT FROM HYATT","W only had a day and a half in London for the end of our Scotland Anniversary trip to see friends and work and we choose the Churchill and what a wonderful surprise of a Suite with Concierge, Champagne, an Anniversary cake and card,  after a long day of travel and the most amazing beds and baths, toiletries, bidet, huge soaking tub and so much more. The staff was so very friendly, this is why we choose and have come to love from HYATT hotels. Thank you, thank you, thank you, we will definitely be back and will stay longer and I really love to stay in that room again, it makes having to work while away much nicer as we did order room service and loved the Concierge food and drink, I highly recommend this Hyatt Regency London by Hyde Park!

150,"Great location, customer service and comforatle beds","Stayed at the Hyatt Regency - The Churchill and had a wonderful stay.  Loved the location on a quiet street away from all the congestion.  The customer service was tops from start to finish.  The rooms were plenty big and the beds were soooo comfortable.  The bathrooms were a bit small but totally updated (including Toto Washlet toilets).  The only thing that was bothersome was that there was a musty smell in the room the entire time. I'm sure if I would have mentioned it to the front desk they would have moved us but we were already settled in. Although a little pricey, the breakfast buffet had a good assortment of quality food.  We also ate at the Montagu Restaurant and had a fabulous meal.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,18
150,A terrific hotel choice,"I spent eight nights recently at the Hyatt Regency in London-the Churchill. From beginning to end, I enjoyed my stay. I was prepared for a ""reserved"" British response to my requests and inquiries. To the contrary, I found the staff to be warm and caring. A special shout out to Simona Battista, the Guest Relations Manager. She went out of her way to make me feel welcome. My room was comfortable and quiet. The air conditioning system worked quietly and efficiently, in contrast to many hotel systems that wake you up when they cycle on and off (while blowing hot or cold air directly at you). The Club Lounge enhanced my stay. This is my go to London hotel from now on.",5,2018,06,18
150,Great place to stay,"A perfect West End location. Close to everything but, for us, not in the middle of Piccadilly. Had fish and chips for a quick dinner one night and it was terrific. Fish was light and almost fluffy, not oily and chips were well seasoned. Rooms are bright and well appointed. Looks recently redone. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,06,16
150,Super service,"Had a great stay at this beautiful hotel. Stayed on the 8th floor and had access to the Club lounge. The concierge on that floor at all times was terrific. Breakfast was continental ish cause the chef happily made me a delicious omelette to go with all the toast, croissants and fresh fruit. Beautiful cheeses and meats were laid out as well. Help yourself to lattes and cappuccinos all day, beer and soft drinks. They had a separate club lounge for adults away from the families so everyone was happy and we felt comfortable. The team even gave my husband a bottle of fizzy wine and a beautiful little cake (so yummy) for his birthday. We didn’t have enough time to eat dinner at the Churchill but with the chefs we had on the 8th floor we will definitely have to try next time we are there. Thanks to all the staff for the great service. Nothing seemed to be too difficult or bothersome to help us with. Even bringing up 2 toothbrushes to our room late at night after I discovered my teens had not brought theirs from home!! Thanks Churchill for a great stay! We will be back!!!",5,2018,06,15
150,Small “European” rooms but amazing service,"This is not “downtown” which makes tours a mild challenge to get to and back.  The service and staff were Outstanding and trained by the best.  The breakfast (included in our package) was very well worth it!   The staff went out of their way to help and make our stay excellent.  
They exchanged dollars for pounds at the front desk at very good rates.  
The “underground”  and shopping were a block away which is a must to get a complete London experience.  
The refrigerator is not overly filled with “sellable items” giving room for local drinks etc....

150,Terrible hotel,The hotel was extremely terrible in service. Never experienced such horrible and careless service from guests. Especially the door man who was least intrested in doing his job or the bell boys who were also horrible in service.,1,2018,06,14
150,deluxe experieince,"Stayed 3 nights as couple, excellent location near Oxford street, multiple good restaurants nearby.  Faces quiet Portman Square.  Room spacious, very comfortable bed, bathrobe and slippers provided, good bathroom, absorbant towels.  Toilet multifunctional.  Breakfast expensive- 20 pounds but excellent.  Gave us late checkout.",5,2018,06,14
150,Terrible Hotel,"I had very high expectations of the hotel due the brand as i have stayed at many hyatts across the world and I'm a Member swell. But this property was a very big disappointment. Right from the start when i entered, the doorman was least bothered to take my bags while check in. The receptionist was very mediocre, room size was extremely small i had booked a queen room only good part it was newly renovated.WIFI was so bad that it did not even connect to my mobile phone. While Checking out the bell boy was least interested in taking my bags to the car which was right outside.
The staff of the hotel is least interested in serving the guests.
WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE.",1,2018,06,14
150,Excellent stay at the Haytt,"Great stay at the Hyatt, welcoming staff, good suite, albeit on the small side, great location, near shops and Hyde park
Staff in general very helpful but uneven
+ Great reception staff
+ Friendly housekeeping
- Member of staff opens doors of taxi see prams lives us standing there and moves to next car, another one helps us get the pram and baby out.
- Trying to call reception, housekeeping, operator etc at some times impossible to get anyone to pick up

Minor hiccup at the time of check in which took over 45 mins was promptly addressed by the manager, sweet of her .
From then on the location ,room ,cleanliness of the property ,service by staff including concierge all simply outstanding!

Hotel is central location and walkable to restaurants ,Oxford street, Hyde park to name a few . Easy cab ride many other tourist spots 

We stayed at a Regency level room –breakfast had a good spread and we totally enjoyed it .Most Staff at regency level were friendly , Geeta was one person who simply did not seem to like us –still don’t’ understand why ?

We are family of 3 no small kids – did nothing out of ordinary for her to turn her face away from us even when we attempted to say “hi”
We once found it hard to open the door ,she was standing right there and turned her face away from us !!! ,some other staff came running to open it for us ,never understood why the behavior all the four days but we ignored since everything else was great .

Definitely look forward visiting the property again .

Many Thanks for making our stay pleasant !",5,2018,06,12
150,Amazing experience at the Hyatt Regency Churchill,"I cannot express how much we enjoyed our extended stay at the Hyatt.  The quality of the staff and amenities were 2nd to none.  Their attention to the special needs of my family made our experience our forgettable.  We will definitely stay again when we return to London. 
",5,2018,06,11
150,Theatre Weekend In London,"Fantastic weekend in London. Booked the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill. It was a superb location for our stay to take in a couple of Westend Shows. The hotel facilities and staff were exceptional. Bedroom was recently renovated and was very high end. We will definitely return to this hotel. Suggestion ..... book a room that gets you access to the executive lounges, they are great. Service here was fantastic, as was the main bar, reception, et-all. Well done the full team at The Churchill!",5,2018,06,11
150,Disappointing Decline!,"I’ve visited the Montague restaurant many times over the last ten years and this visit was without doubt the worst - whether this was due to new management, the lowest ever number of guests I have ever encountered (only 4 tables occupied), understaffed tables or cold food. Staff were friendly and helpful but at over £90 per head this on its own isn’t good enough. My eggs florentine was cold, chicken very dry and vegetable soup tasteless. The choice was not as extensive as in the past, especially the desserts although oysters were an addition that were previously not offered. There was a singer but she would often disappear for lengthy periods. I did mention all of this to the restaurant manager (who didn’t seem very concerned) and was offered 15% off my bill - pretty poor for a regular visitor for more than ten years.
So, overall, very disappointing. Maybe I’ll try the Landmark for my next brunch.",2,2018,06,10
150,Disappointed!,I have been here before and been impressed....but not today. Service was slow due to understaffing and on more than one occasion food was cold i.e. Mussels and egg florentine. Too many times staff had to be reminded to provide the correct silverwear. Considering the price staff should be more attentive...there was only one member of staff for the whole room and the manager only consulted us once despite attempts to attract attention and didn't seem particularly interested. Food choices were clearly depleted from my last visit although there were one or two good additions. Musicians were present but disappeared for long periods. Not what you would expect...certain not what Izvestia experienced in the past. Would have to think carefully about a) whether Id come back here again b) whether Id recommend this experience to anyone else!,2,2018,06,10
150,Excellent Property!,"Flawless, renovated rooms. Rooms are tasteful and high-end. The details are perfected, bed extremely comfortable. Check-in was quick and friendly. Phone interactions a bit cold. I will probably stay here next time I'm in town.",5,2018,06,08
150,Gm,Payed way too much for very bad rooms no view all you see is the hotel wall and the rooms called Presediantial suites . What a joke for the price I paid . Reseptiion manager disck was total unprofessional and did absolutely nothing to solve it because those suits was old and should been off the market until they do renovations,1,2018,06,08
150,Sad Really,"With excellent location (near Marble Arch), beautiful interior decor, comfy bed, lovely buffet breakfast, this maybe all you want from a hotel. BUT, when we pay this amount of money we like to be greeted in a warm and friendly manner.  We were in a large group but the reception staff of 3 men were ill equipped to handle the check in for that many people. It was a fiasco and they ( not the tour guide) forgot to take our credit card details. The next day we received a letter curtly explaining to present our credit card to the front desk. We rang immediately and said we would be down in the morning to do so, which we did. Next day after a very warm and tiring day of sightseeing, I went to get a cold bottle of water from the bar fridge and it was empty. When we rang reception, they said we hadn't left credit card details, we explained that we had, so we were reassured that the fridge would be refilled the next day. Next day still empty fridge. On check out we explained to a rather arrogant reception man what had occurred, so to his distain, he offered that the bottle of water used on our first night would be free. What we expected was some empathy, courtesy and an apology for the inconvenience. Not a lot to ask.
We were at this hotel for 4 nights and during that time only 4 staff members greeted us with a smile. The English concierge, the female receptionist, the lady in the foyer and one cleaner. What an unhappy hotel! We would never return.",3,2018,06,05
150,A truly special oasis,"Just three blocks off bustling Oxford Street and four blocks away from the Marble Arch Underground Station, this hotel provides a restful and calm oasis for both businesspeople and tourists.  We emailed the management about a week before to see if we could be accommodated for an early check-in. (Regular check-in is 3pm, we requested 1pm).  They promptly responded that, while they could not promise this, they would make every effort to make it possible.  Happily, they did accommodate us and, being Hyatt members, they also offered us a Regency Club upgrade.  We loved this upgrade and enjoyed their “enhanced” continental breakfast every morning of our 6-night stay.  

Our room was generously-sized for a European hotel room.  Our king bed was comfortable, clean, the duvet/blanket was warm, and the pillow choices were terrific.  There are reading lights on both sides of the bed and there is a nice selection of news channels on the flat screen.  The only possible downer is there are few drawers for your clothes which, for us, meant we lived out of our suitcases.  Not a big deal.  There is one US-100-volt outlet by the desk in case you forget your converter which is a nice plus.  There is a kettle to boil water for your tea and a fridge which we never opened.  

The bathroom is small with shower, toilet, and sink in the single room.  The shower had handheld and overhead rain shower options.  Huge blanket-sized thirsty towels and a fog-free mirror were much appreciated.  The Toto toilet/bidet was great!  The usual Hyatt amenities were all there and just high class all the way.

Concierge service was friendly and seemingly all-knowing.  We did not eat at the restaurant but heard very fine things.  There is also a work-out facility but we did not visit this so I cannot comment responsibly on this.  All in all, this is a hotel that takes care of you very, very well.

150,$500 British Pound a Night and Sleeping in a Foldaway Bed,"Just checked in yesterday.  On a 1 week Tauck tour of London and Paris as a college graduation gift to daughter.  The reservation clearly stated 3 adults.  Was assigned a room with 2 single beds.  The room can barely fit these 2 single beds.  Asked about 3rd bed for 3rd adult and a foldable bed was rolled into the room,  Now only about 1 feet of space to walk.  The chair for the desk can’t be pulled out to sit in as the rollaway bed is now in the way.   Unreasonable and unacceptable when charging room rates at luxury prices!",1,2018,06,04
150,An Excellent Property!!,"We spent 2 days in London before starting our vacation and were fortunate to stay at this property. 

We arrived late and received a warm welcome upon our arrival and were directed to the front desk where the reception was warm and friendly. We had a great room overlooking the park across the street. The room was beautiful and definitely met the Hyatt Standard! The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful and modern. 

Our stay was magical due to the staff and We would like to thank Melissa in the Restaurant, Mohammed and Daniel the bellmen, Ricardo & Sahil at the concierge desk who gave us wonderful restaurant selections and great sight-seeing tips. 

In the evening, we ""hung out"" at the Churchill Bar, the bartenders were fantastic and entertaining and the waitresses were friendly and attentive. We tried a variety of specialty drinks and they were all top notch.

We hope to return to London in the future for a longer visit and look forward to returning to The Churchill!!",5,2018,06,01
150,A delightful wonder!,"Talk about an amazing place! THIS HOTEL ROCKS! It is clean, quiet, comfortable and hospitable. Before we even arrived the concierge went above and beyond to ensure we would enjoy our first yet short stay in london. 

As you can see from the first pictures, a HAND WRITTEN note with personal drawings from the concierge desk! The champagne and treats were extra extra icing on the cake! 

The breakfast the following morning was fresh and delicious! I felt like I was enjoying it on a farm somewhere. We will definitely return to The Churchill! 5 stars! ",5,2018,05,30
150,Magnificent!,"This hotel was spectacular from the outset. From the opposing first impression with marble and wood, this hotel offered a sense of history with elegance and charm. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. They were very helpful, giving advice on all things such as good restaurants, attractions to visit and places to shop. ",5,2018,05,30
150,Very pleasant stay,"I always recommend Hyatt, anywhere in the world, and this one makes no exception. Very trendy place, great staff, feeling to be a privileged customer. Great experience, as usual. I definitely recommend this hotel.

",5,2018,05,30
150,The Churchill is Great!," We have stayed for a week every fall and every spring now tof the last few years.  We love the luxury, the service, the tranquility of this hotel.  It is our favourite one in London, and we have stayed at approximately 10 other hotels.  the location is great with buses running close by and cabs always available.  the staff are wonderful and will help in any way they can if you have a problem.  Not stuffiness there!  they are eager to please and will do anything possible to help you if you are in a jam!  the rooms are immacul",5,2018,05,29
150,We Loved It!,"We stayed for 5 nights while on tour with Tauck. We were on the second floor which we were told were refurbished recently. The rooms were in excellent condition, very upscale, modern and comfortable. As a family we appreciate when the hotel can provide connecting rooms, it makes a stay so much nicer to avoid the hallway to go to the other room. Breakfast buffet in the morning was good and we enjoyed a fine dinner one night in the main restaurant. We liked it and I’d stay there again!",5,2018,05,29
150,Worth a try!!,"This hotel is conviniently located to the metro. There are nice shops close by and also nice restaurants and coffee shops.  We were able to locate a laundromat also close by.  The beds are comfortable compared to other hotels we were at (eg. the W hotel).  The rooms are cleaned well everyday. One treat you get  is a warm toilet seat after walking all day! The staff are very friendly, helpful and sincere when you talk to them.",5,2018,05,28
150,Past it’s best,The rooms are a bit tired and the place needs a refurb. The black and grey decor is a bit drab and tatty in some places. The breakfast in the executive restaurant was mediocre and the supply of food to the buffet area was poor. We had to keep asking for things to be replenished. The ambience and atmosphere in the bar at night was very good and the location was very convenient for Oxford Street. However the pluses do not outweigh the minuses and even though we have stayed a few times over the years we will not go back.,3,2018,05,27
150,Stay anywhere else... even a park bench would be better ,"Globalist member here. Was given a room on the 8th floor which was not renovated. I specifically asked for a newly renovated room but was told that wasn’t possible... even as a globalist. The carpet in the room was bubbling up all over the room to the point where one of us physically tripped on it and fell. It was filthy, dangerous and disgusting. The couch was so over used the cushion was as thin as a piece of paper and there were more stains on the couch then on the carpet which was covered in what looked like human made mayonnaise.

I went and spoke to an agent who assured me there was nothing that could be done. So I called corporate and they had to step in, why does it have to be this way? Why wouldn’t the hotel do the right thing without making anyone no matter what tier status they hold be in an unsafe room?

We were ‘upgraded’ to a suite on the third floor which looked much nicer until you actually paid attention. The photos of mold attached are from the bathroom. I believe there may be life forming in these photos.

Staff was cold and uninterested. Called and asked if I could change pounds into euros for our next destination and was told yes absolutely. When I arrived the desk a total of 2 minutes later I was told that was not possible. So they changed their minds or the rules pretty quickly!!

I asked for turn down service and it never happened.... I called each day to confirm and was promised it would happen. It did not. I w then asked for a manager to reach out to me, that did not happen. It’s been days now since our stay and nothing. The bedding stunk so badly when we first laid down on it, I asked for it to be changed but it wasn’t the first evening because why would anyone listen? They didn’t change it the next morning either so I had to tell them it needed to be changed and finally on our last night it was changed. I would venture to bet it wasn’t cleaned before us.

This was by far the worse Hyatt experience I’ve ever been a part of. It would have been cleaner and safer to sleep on a park bench. What a disappointment. Save your money and go anywhere but here if your looking for cleanliness or friendliness.",1,2018,05,27
150,Excellent as always,"Night away at one of our favourite hotels. Excellent as always. Great service, good food and lovely staff. Room was spacious and equipoise to a high standard. The Club Lounge is quiet and relaxing. Great location for shopping and eating out. Definitely will go again.",5,2018,05,27
150,Good stay,"This was a good stay- comfortable clean room, good food. I will say we were not recognized for our world of Hyatt explorist status which we’ve worked hard to achieve but otherwise we had a good experience. ",4,2018,05,26
150,Excellent in all respects,"Extremely comfortable short stay at the Churchill.  Tastefully decorated spacious room, recently refurbished. Room overlooking the street but I was not troubled by traffic noise at all. Indeed the view over the park across the road is very pleasant.

Well-equipped bathroom and excellent walk in shower with fluffy towels – a real plus. 

 I did this using my Hyatt reward points so excellent value for the use of them.

The hotel is just off Oxford Street so easy to access from anywhere within London’s West End or city.",5,2018,05,26
150,"Initial Stumble, Couldn't Recover ...","As a Hyatt Globalist, I expect some recognition for my hard earned $'s.

I contacted the hotel in advance to request a suite upgrade, which I understand is subject to availability.

Upon arrival I was informed there was no availability for a suite upgrade, as the class of suite I receive complimentary was fully booked. However, I was offered a suite upgrade for the 'small' sum of 250 pounds per night for each of my three night stay. Yes, 750++ extra, JUST to upgrade the room.

I decided to accept the room that had been allocated to me and then reach out via email to see if the suite upgrade options were actually as described. First I did a quick room search for purchase and was presented with multiple suites being available for purchase that night and for the length of my stay ! Of course, the hotel always has a ready made answer that the suite is not the same class as I'm entitled to for a complimentary upgrade. This is normally due to the hotel creating a 'fake' suite classification that is only served by one or two rooms in the entire hotel, ensuring they are rarely available.

Anyway, the hotel responded to my email promptly and confirmed a suite upgrade without charge was indeed available (A case of being lucky that my email found the right person). Something the front desk were unable to do.

My frustration is why does it have to be this way ? why must frequent stayers ""play the game"" to get what the terms & conditions say we'll get ?

The upgraded room was perfect. A very comfortable bed, very clean and provided an excellent nights sleep.

The breakfast provided in the lounge and the evening 'Canape hour' were both good, providing a good choice and acceptable quality.

As a guest who had access to the lounge, I found it interesting that the hotel provides a letter confirming what charges will be levied should I wish to take a non-resident guest in to the lounge....... ONE HUNDRED TWENTY(120) pounds per day. Yes, that's for breakfast, afternoon snacks & drinks, and and evening happy hour with finger food....... WOW. I wonder how many takers they've had ?

I think my impression of this hotel was scarred as a result of my check in experience. And whilst I could not find fault once I was assigned my upgraded room, I leave feeling that obtaining my Hyatt Globalist benefits was just too much hassle.",3,2018,05,21
150,Great experience,"Very quiet room overlooking the Park, excellent food at both restaurants, pricey but no more than other high end hotels in the city.  Flexible to allow late checkout late breakfast and a very early check in",5,2018,05,21
150,Charity Dinner,"We attended a charity dinner event here in the large ground floor function room.
There must have been at least 200 guests but despite this challenging number the 4 course meal was superb quality and the service matched it with friendly, attentive service - well done to the function team.
Beautiful venue too. We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.",5,2018,05,19
150,Wonderful stay!,"Having read a few average reviews from April I was apprehensive about staying here, but as I was traveling with some friends I decided to stay with the group.

So glad I did!
I arrived at the hotel at 9.30 am and having advised of early arrival was given a room by 1030.
The room I requested having read the trip advisor reports was a renovated one facing the Portman square gardens with club lounge access.

The room while being small was super comfortable, quiet and fresh. Loved getting up in the mornings with the sunshine and looking into the garden of Portman square.

The staff in the club lounge were just lovely. Breakfast and canapés in the evenings just super. The breakfast sausages to die for.

The staff in the dining area downstairs were also just so accommodating and kind.

The only down side was they need to get the outside of their windows cleaned as the dirt does distract from the view!

Keep it up guys!",5,2018,05,19
150,Relaxing stay ,"Easy access Near Marble Arch tube station and across from Portman square. Peaceful, quiet stay. Near shopping on Oxford  street. (Two blocks to Selfridges).
Room ok size but bathroom small. 
Nice fitness gym, treadmills, weights. Staff very helpful, courteous and cheerful from front desk to housekeeping.
Comfortable beds(as most all hyatt beds are). Would stay here again. ",4,2018,05,17
150,Best hotel in London,Great location. Extremely courtious staff. Superb food. Best place to stay for Mayfair and shopping. Easy to get around. Hotel is modern and the rooms are a good size. Great value for money. A must place to stay,5,2018,05,17
150,"A gorgeous, professional, and bustling property","This is a luxury property in the heart of London.  The staff who greeted us at the door included Reginald (forgive me if this is innacurate) and he was a bright smiling face and a real personable character that immediately made us like him.  Jacopo at the front desk was quick with getting us checked in and made to feel most welcome.  And Sahill, the concierge, who really took the time to give personal advice on locales to eat and where to walk nearby...they were all amazing.
The staff really made an impression on what was only a one night stay, and that's saying something.",5,2018,05,17
150,Great stay,"Enjoy my stay. Great location. The lounge was great with very helpful,friendly staff. The suite we stayed in was 5 star quality. Excellent location to great restaurants, transportation and famous sites. The front desk staff very knowledgeable. Overall a great experience!",5,2018,05,16
150,The Montagu,I frequent this restaurant they time I'm in London. Never a bad experience. Angie and Stephen are the ever smiling professional service staff ready to greet and provide that top class service that only a Hyatt guest deserve. Well done guys. Keep up the good work. ,4,2018,05,14
150,Wonderful way to close out a 2 week trop,"Staff were very professional and they made sure no request was too difficult, and all guests were important. 
Rooms were lovy, beds were comfortable. Loved their bathrooms and their heated mirrors are always a fantastic touch. It was a fantastic stay.",5,2018,05,13
150,A consistent 5-star Experience,"After a long week in the South of France, we booked into a nearby 'boutique' hotel just a block from Hyatt. Regretted not booking here for a marginal difference. Last night in London, we moved to Hyatt and what a pleasant surprise it was for our weary souls. We had a most pleasant (despite short) stay and it is consistent. Would definitely consider coming here again whenever I visit London next.

To friends considering a good place, don't save 30 pounds and risking a good night's sleep. Get a room in Hyatt and have a blissful London experience!

Love from KL.",5,2018,05,08
150,Great weekend in London,"Stayed here at the end of a 7 night cruise. Tour operator selected the hotel but could no have been more satisfied. Rooms were extemely clean, quiet and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would return when in London. ",5,2018,05,07
150,Fantastic experience!,"My wife and I spent a weekend at the Churchill and we had the most amazing time there. The staff is absolutely fabulous and treated us as VIPs every single second of our stay. We had a fantastic dinner in the Montagu Restaurant where Jose and Gianluca looked after us. The food was beyond delicious and the service was absolutely great. Harry in the Churchill Bar made our stay even more special - fantastic service and the best cocktails in the area! 
The rooms were brilliantly decorated, extremely clean and welcoming. Receptionist Mihai and Doorman Garfield enabled a fantastic arrival and departure. 
Overall, a brilliant experience that completely exceeded our expectations.",5,2018,05,07
150,Just love it!!!,"Excellent staff, great food, cooked to perfection with flexibility,  beautiful atmosphere, fun outdoor bar, and the host of the bar is wonderful!! Afternoon tea is always lovely at the Churchill too! What more can you ask for when dinning out ? Perfection .",5,2018,05,02
150,Great Location and Service,"Hotel is in a really nice area, close to restaurants, shopping and metro.  Staff is extremely helpful.  Rooms are comfortable and clean.  Gym is fine.  We didn't dine at the hotel so I can't comment on the food.  I would stay here again.",4,2018,05,01
150,Perfect Location!,"The hotel is perfectly situated near Hyde park and the Marble Arch underground stop. There is lots of shopping nearby along with many wonderful sites to see.

150,Convenient location for Oxford Street Shopping,"Pricey rooms- expected from a London, close to Selfridges and M&S. 2 mins walk to Oxford St. good variety for breakfast. Rooms are small but comfortable bed. Check in could be improved. Lobby is noisy in the evenings. Service was good- more for those who want to be in Central London ",4,2018,04,29
150,Comfortable hotel,"Nice comfortable rooms. Huge bed very nice quite rooms. Great breakfast.
Given 3 stars as check in and check out takes a very long time. The girl at the check out counter doesn’t seem to know much and had to always get help from her colleague. Had to wait a long time to get the car . The staff at the check out counter and the concierge was not very warm
And welcoming.

150,An old favorite has improved,"We have stayed at The Churchill over 100 times in the last 15 years.  It was always a favorite, but this last stay was the first since the 2015 renovations to the club and rooms demonstrably improved their condition.  Still, it has always been the staff that has always made The Churchill our favorite.  We were sad to hear that our old friend Solhi, the Club icon, would retire before our next visit.  We will definitely miss him, but expect that newer members will step up to fill his very big shoes.  ",5,2018,04,28
150,Relaxing stay," We stayed for two nights after staying at a different hotel in London for a business conference. The Churchhill was above and beyond our expectations! We have stayed at many Hyatt Regency hotels in many different cities and this one was wonderful!  Close to great shopping and restaurants. The hotel room was clean, comfortable, and large.  The staff was friendly and very helpful. ",5,2018,04,27
150,Fantastic Property!,"From the minute I stepped out of my cab, I was greeted warmly and the staff was inviting.  My room was beautifully appointed! I recommend that anyone visiting London look to the Hyatt Regency as a choice hotel!",5,2018,04,27
150,Amazing,"Well what can I say, this was a great stay, I’m so glad we stayed in the great Hyatt regency,
We went for my sister birthday, we received so many tasty treats, cake, macaroons, wine and porseco.
Th launch was good, great service, and the roome amazing.
Defenitly a great stay",5,2018,04,24
150,"Had a wonderful time a couple of years ago, but not this trip...","We chose The Churchill to spend our wedding anniversary as we were here a couple of years ago and the hotel made us feel so special. They upgraded up to the Regency club, sent a bottle of proseco and overall treated to feel special and welcomed to the hotel.

This time upon check in we were barely acknowledged to be long time globalist/Gold members nor welcomed back.

We were given a very small room, not upgraded, no warm or gracious greeting (s) and only left us feeling that we made a huge mistake by choose to come back to The Churchill.

We are disappointed as we live in the USA and it is a long trip for us and we were excited to celebrate at the hotel that gave us such great memories a couple of years ago. Only now we will be left feeling unappreciated and cold.

It's really sad that even if a hotel is busy they cannot treat their customers with a welcoming smile or notice on their reservation that they are returning customer from over seas. I guess sadly they really don't care...",2,2018,04,22
150,Very disappointed,"There are many hotels to choose from when in London and in thus trip we definitely made the WRONG choice. We had stayed here a couple of years ago and had the complete opposite experience to this trip. It appeared that they did not care or value gold members of many years nor be treated with respect or professionalism. 

From the check in process to not being upgraded for use in the regency club we were disappointed all around. 

The service was OK. Rooms are average. We will definitely not be returning.",2,2018,04,22
150,great experience,"My first time in this hotel and won't be the last! Their service is fab and loved the concept of the lounge. The room service is excellent their meat is halal too which was brilliant.
The location is perfect everything is close by. Only downside is their decor and furniture which were plain where I expected more considering I stayed in a little suite but all in all it was perfect",5,2018,04,19
150,Home away from home,Always a fan of the Hyatt hotels. Great location in Marylebone. Always being looked after. Housed the best italian restaurant in town. Room and view are both amazing. Nice staffs and a home away from home.,5,2018,04,19
150,Really great stay,"I stay here for two nights with my friends. Our stay was amaizing, really helpful staff and reception desk. I want to say big thank you for your warm welcome. I will be back deenayley!)) Thanks a lot)",5,2018,04,18
150,Montagu Restaurant has lost its mojo,"While I love the Churchill in Portland Square, the quality of food in the Montagu restaurant has significantly deteriorated since my last visit. A concentration on appearance rather than substance, on being filling rather than nutritious, catering to every taste rather than being succulent and fresh. 
For me the biggest disappointment was the  coffee.  The one cup I had was terrible - bitter, weak, watery rather than creamy, aromatic and flavoursome. Scones were like rocks, cakes were pretty but overly sweet and empty of flavour and seafood pasta was bland with 'king prawns' the size of shrimps. Altogether not what I have enjoyed at this restaurant before. It just seems tired.  I thought it might be that the chefs were uninterested in western style food. I thought I might do better with eastern food. Also disappointing - chicken tikka serving was minimal and the taste was bland -one could have been chewing plastic. Naan bread had none of the delicious buttery freshness that I had experienced in the humblest Indian restaurant during a recent visit to Mumbai. Please Montagu - recover your old mojo!",3,2018,04,16
150,"Great staff, Very enjoyable stay overlooking a Park","We went here for business. Great food, staff were friendly and very helpful. We had a beautiful view of the park from our room. Fantastic location close to Hyde Park. Lots of great shops to go to. The room was very comfortable.",5,2018,04,15
150,Very good hotel ,"I stayed there for 15 nights , the location was good  as well as the room with view was nice although it was small , the staff were very friendly and professional ... but I think the hotel needs renovation as soon as possible , compared to other 5 stars hotel I will consider it in the lower levels , you can see its old hotel !

Anyway and In general I will come back for sure if I found an opportunity .",4,2018,04,15
150,Excellent hotel in central London,This hotel is one of the best Hyatt's I have stayed at. The service was exemplary and the location is super if you are visiting London. The rooms were good and comfortable. The bar and cafe area on the ground floor is excellent. The club member facilities are poor compared with other Hyatt clubs.,4,2018,04,14
150,"Warm, welcoming and lovely. Good Value too.","This was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency Churchill, and it probably will not be my last. I really enjoyed everything about my stay... well, except for the crazy toilet that has a dashboard of buttons and a heated seat. Too weird for my taste.  The staff were all great, especially the front desk, the concierge and the breakfast staff. All friendly, attentive, welcoming and professional. The room was excellent. Loved the warm colors and the really comfortable bed. Lots of outlets, great shower and nice amenities.  Had room service a few times and it was very prompt. Breakfast was amazing and one of the best breakfast buffets I can recall. Also enjoyed the bar. Great vibe and great bartenders. And, I thought the price was very reasonable for the property. Good location too. I liked the quiet street.",5,2018,04,11
150,Nice hotel,Great location. Very near departmental store Selfridges and shopping areas like Oxford Street and Bond Street. Many eateries nearby too. Hotel staff were polite and helpful. Stayed in the Regency Suite King room which allows access to the Regency Club. Room was big and comfortable. ,5,2018,04,11
150,Flawless as usual!,"The Churchill continues always to exceed expectations, even after so many visits.  Their flawless execution and consistency in service standards never cease to amaze me!  Look forward to my next stay.....",5,2018,04,09
150,Location can’t be beat,"As other reviewers said, this is a great location. It was close to the tube and walkable to other popular areas live Covent Garden. Breakfast was great and the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. The room (we had a suite) was large, comfortable and well appointed. We will stay here again when we return to London. ",5,2018,04,08
150,Perfect Location!,"What an amazing location...right by Oxford street! 

It's quite an expensive hotel (what isn't in Central London?), but we found it to be well worth it for a short stay, as we were limited on time, and wanted to see as much of the city as possible. It was a great place to base ourselves for 3 days in the city.

We didn't try the breakfast or any other dining at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. But the front desk staff was friendly and always helpful. We enjoyed our stay and would likely book this hotel again next time we are in London!",5,2018,04,06
150,Great location - and access to tennis!,"Close to Hyde Park and Oxford Street, the Hyatt Regency Churchill is a very convenient location, but overlooking Portman Square makes it a very tranquil location.    Plus, if you enjoy tennis, playing on the court in Portman Square is a marvelous treat, available to guests of the hotel.",5,2018,04,05
150,Lunch for two,"Food was very good, but the final bill for 2 people and 2 courses was over £70 which we thought excessive, especially as one meal was the value set meal for £20.
Service was attentive, but food took ages to come to the table, even accepting it was all cooked freshly.",4,2018,04,04
150,solid business hotel with no suprises (and no views),everything is well organised here if you stay for business. messages to tell you when the roon is ready and electronic check out are just examples of what you will find. rooms are typical hyatt with no surprises and now view in this case (heated toilette has a Tokyo style touch). the hotel bar has some atmosphere including the outside space with the Churchill statue. it is your typical big city business hotel which is a bit anonymous but has everything you need if you stay for business. location is a plus.,5,2018,04,02
150,"Good Hotel, but Bad Experience with Check Credit Card Charges","First, let me state that this is a beautiful hotel, centrally located in London.  This is my second trip to the UK in a month and I stayed here both times. My first experience was amazing! As a Hyatt Globalist, I was taken to the 8th floor/lounge area to check in, and received the best service! My stay yesterday and today, not at all the same! First, I was checked in at the front desk and my card charged more than normal. So, with a pretty hefty charge hanging on my credit card during holiday, I was not pleased.  But, I knew it would drop off the next day so I was not worried...that is until the next day. I checked out this morning and was then charged the ACTUAL amount of the room ON TOP of the charge from yesterday. I thought something was off when she asked to see my card again to close the room out even though I already had the pending charge. I explained that i already had the charge and did not want to be charged again.  She assured me I wouldn’t and then 10 seconds later I received a notification from credit card company showing she did! Needless to say, I was not pleased.  The supervisor came out, apologized and said he would reverse the first payment immediately, but that it was bank holiday so it would take about 2 days to see it.  Honestly, that does nothing for me while I’m on vacation.  I’ve NEVER had that problem at any Hyatt I’ve stayed at, and just want anyone staying here to know to be very careful in reviewing your charges.  Overall, I would still recommend this hotel for people traveling to London, as the beds are super comfortable, the doormen remember your name, and it is really well designed.  Close walk to the arches, and they will even try to accommodate their Globalist members with a temporary room if their suite is not ready, so that you can shower before going out. They actually did this for us, but we ended up just keeping the room instead of moving to our suite because we didn’t want to have staff have to clean two rooms for us when we were only staying one night.  I just wish that the experience would have been the same as my first trip, and want anyone traveling there for the first time to CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD CHARGES!",3,2018,04,02
150,Great place to stay!,"Worth the money paid. The rooms are very nicely arranged with high-end toilet facilities.
Lots of beverages in the fridge too, with good channels to watch as well.
Bed are comfortable to sleep on and the queen size is rather large for 2 person too.
",5,2018,03,30
150,A short break,"We only stayed one night, so didn’t expect too much as we were getting big to be out and about most of the time. But it wasperfect . The room was lovely and clean, the staff were brilliant. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,27
150,Charming if somewhatef dated,Service standards are not what one would expect at that price point. Rooms are little small - not terrible by London standards though. Excellent food at Montague. Excellent location right on Portman Square. ,3,2018,03,18
150,Great choice for London,"Globalist treatment was very good. Their Regency Club was above average.  Make sure to request the renovated room or suite, big difference.  Rooms are small but comfortable. Service from all was excellent. 

Great location...walking distance to tube station, British Museum, Hyde Park and Palaces.  £15 cab ride to The Strand area. 

Room service Sticky Toffee Pudding was the best we found. ",4,2018,03,18
150,Quiet stay in the Capital,Great place to stay for visiting London. Easy walk to London's top shopping and the sights. We walked to the West End to see a show and walked back. If you don't fancy walking the tube is nearby. Our rooms quiet and in excellent decor.  We overlooked the gardens opposite the hotel. Staff were very helpful.,5,2018,03,18
150,Amazing Hotel With Top Notch Service & Amenities,"I spent 6 nights at the Hyatt Regency Winston Churchill to explore London and the surrounding cities. The luxurious hotel is very well situated with easy access to numerous shopping, restaurants and the underground subway. The breakfast each morning was spectacular with everything you can ask for. The famous Churchill Bar is a hot spot in the evenings where they make and create cocktails that are worthy of royalty. Black Cab Taxis are always waiting out front to take you where you want and the concierge is always available to answer your questions and make any necessary arrangements.The rooms are super clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,03,16
150,Great to be back ... Home at Hyatt,"We were visiting London to celebrate our daughters 21st Birthday , she's been studying and performing in London for the past year .. .. We had originally booked a hotel closer to her accommodation but after 4 terrible days with another brand moved to the Hyatt Regency-Churchill on Portman Square ... A delightful welcome a wonderful stay , close to Oxford street , shops restaurants and turned what could have been a horrible visit to a wonderful stay ... This was our 4th visit to London in the past 7 months and one over maybe 30 over the years ... Thank goodness for the Hyatt Regency -Churchill ... just fantastic to be back Home .. Thank you HYATT ..!!",4,2018,03,12
150,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for two nights in March for a theatre break. Check in staff were extremely welcoming and we received a free upgrade as this was our first stay in this Hyatt. The room was large, bright and clean. As a (very) minor criticism we would have liked a mirror in the main room rather that in the wardrobe but was not a problem. 

We did not have the breakfast as we felt this was quite pricey so cannot comment on that.

The location was fantastic 5 minute walk from the Marble Arch tube station and about a 10 minute walk from Oxford Street. 

We would definitely return.",4,2018,03,12
150,Always the best,"Definitely my favorite hotel property in London.  Great location outside the hustle and bustle, yet convenient.  Outstanding club level with excellent offerings and service.  Highly recommend for Hyatt Globalist level members.",5,2018,03,11
150,"Terrific location, big enough rooms for a price","The hotel is very elegant, perfectly situated for business as well as leisure travel, and even the simplest room is of a decent size, for a relatively fair price... We have to bear in mind that this is still London.
The breakfast is very good, the restaurants on site are nice, and Regent Park, Oxford Street and Bond Street, as well as Marble Arch are all within a few minutes walk.",4,2018,03,11
150,Nice hotel,"So my wife and I arrived Wednesday night late, on the first stop of our honeymoon. The hotel is in a great location, (and close to a Shul and a kosher eaterie. See Reubens). I found the room to be quite small as we had a lot of luggage, and while there is a blow dryer in the room, it does not fit in the bathroom outlet. There was a man at the check-in desk at night, Jacob something who was particularly nice and helpful. Overall a nice place to stay.",4,2018,03,11
150,My Favourite Hotel,"From the moment you check in you are treated to a wonderful experience.  Location is central so all areas of London are easily accessible.  We stayed in a suite on the 8th floor and wow everything was first class. There are two lounges on the 8th floor, one for accompanied children and another for those without.  I cannot rate this hotel highly enough.",5,2018,03,05
150,Take a look at the little shop,"It is about details. Although location is wonderful and The Churchill is a very good hotel, there are details missing. Rooms are a little bit old and bathrooms very small. But restaurant and bar are great and the little shop is a jewel.",4,2018,03,05
150,Can’t beat it,"I love this place.  Not too big and not too small. Great location just off Oxford St. with a view over Portman Square Park. I got in early from an overnight flight and was able to check into my room before noon.  Nice!

Large rooms and bathrooms, including walk in showers.  The Regency Club is one of the nicer ones I’ve experienced. 

Not to be repetitive, but the location is great.  Just a few short blocks from two Underground stations and from the Mayfair shopping on Bond and Regent Streets. 

Hotel staff is helpful and remembers your name.  ",5,2018,03,04
150,Short stay!,"Love the Hyatt beds and pillows - always very well rested following a stay with this group. It's like sleeping on a cloud!

It was our first stay in this particular property however, and our expectations were high.  The decor is as expected of a five star London establishment - warm and comfortable.  The staff were attentive and very welcoming, although we did have a hiccup upon checking in that the desk were unsure of how to handle, but sorted out after a fashion!
The room was smaller than expected as was the bathroom but provided all that was required (iron and board, hairdryer, shower gel etc) and were spotlessly clean.

Tea and coffee making facilities were lacking in quality.  Nescafe instant sachets! 
The bathrobes were somewhat threadbare and tatty.

The bar staff in the evening were very pleasant, but service was rather slow.

Breakfast was substantial and well cooked.  If someone from The Churchill is reading this - get rid of the pots in the hot buffet section.  You can't hold a plate, lift the lid from the serving pots and serve yourself at the same time! We only have two hands. There's nowhere to put the lids - just doesn't work!

Apart from the slight negatives, a very comfortable stay.",4,2018,03,04
150,One of my favourite in London! ,"This hotel is always one of my favourite hotel in London! Why? Very good location and only 10 mins walk to Selfridges, many shops within 5 mins walk.

The hotel made me feel so warm when I stayed every time. The newly renovated room was very spacious and the bed was very comfy. Love the citrus scent bathroom amenities. 

As my room came with club lounge access, I enjoyed my late night tea in the lounge ... as breakfast was included, I went to Montagu restaurant on lobby floor which offers more choices of food. My favourite there was pastries! Love the freshly made croissant and pain au chocolat.... so flakey and buttery! The hot items were delicious ... cold items were massive! 

Always recommended this hotel to everyone! ",5,2018,03,04
150,"Good location, very clean, excellent breakfast","I spent two days in the hotel for business meetings. It was a standard room in February, which gave a good value for a moderate price. One should always look at prices in London! The room was spacious for London and very clean, the shower was very strong, the breakfast very varied and tasty. 
We extensively used business facilities and can say they are ok, but way too expensive (1.5 GBP for a minute of telephone call, for instance). Room service is ok, but I would not call it really tasty, it all looks and feels a bit bland.",4,2018,03,01
150,Legendary hotel,"A legendary, luxurious five-star hotel with exceptionally clean rooms, a big choice of foods and drinks for the room service, great location. My room had also a toilet with heating, which was a surprisingly good thing. :) 

Another hotel to recommend in Central London!",5,2018,02,28
150,Sunday Brunch,"We were a party of six and booked the Montagu restaurant for Sunday Brunch.
We were warmly welcomed by the staff and shown to a lovely and spacious oval table.
We were served champagne throughout our meal by extremely attentive staff.
The food was buffet style with a choice of breakfast and / or lunch courses. Starters were extensive and even included oysters. There was also a great selection of roast meats and desserts.
There was also a great two-piece band playing and singing in the background.
This was the second time we have been for weekend brunch and it is a fabulous experience which we will repeat when we are next in London.",5,2018,02,26
150,An ideal venue for short or long stay,"A great location for Bond and South Malton Street shopping and then for the theater in the evening.
We enjoy the Regency floor with its dedicated quiet places to relax, take a snack and have breakfast. The south east facing room was clean and bright and captured the morning sun. The large double was comfortable.",4,2018,02,19
150,Most memorable stay for birthday trip,"Very pleasant and memorable stay with cheery and helpful staff for wife's birthday trip.

Before arriving to hotel, we got contacted by the room manager asking for our preferences. I let them know our preference and also mentioned the reason for our trip and arrival time. As a wonderful surprise, hotel manager had arranged us an upgrade to an executive suite, and there was champagne and a birthday cake waiting for us on the living room table! The suite was naturally excellent, with plenty of room and comfy king bed. Bathroom had a tub and separate shower and plenty of space as well. Room was fairly quiet, but as a corner room, there was some street car noise coming in despite being in seventh floor, but overall, nothing disturbing.

I also used my club awards for the Club access, where we had excellent extended continental breakfasts each morning, served with cheery and very polite staff. Club would also offer drinks and snacks throughout the day and canape hour at night, which we had once, and it was ok, but not an splendid as expected. Two other nights we didn't make back to the hotel in time, but we're busy sightseeing and shopping in the city. 

Hotel is located in very good location. Oxford street is two blocks away, Marble Arch tube station is also two blocks away for Central line access, and there is a line of taxi always waiting outside the hotel if you need a taxi. Hyde park is almost around the corner for a morning run, and hotel offers access to the small park across the street for tennis and running as well.

Wifi was complimentary and fast, almost always providing the promised 20Mb/s.

Overall, we had very memorable and awesome trip, and I would recommend the hotel, and will stay again in future visits in London.",5,2018,02,19
150,Great venue for conference ,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in early February for a 3 day Conference. I have often stayed in this part of London for over 20 years, however this is the best yet. Why you might ask, in a nutshell it has everything including a great location just 2 minutes walk from Oxford street. The rooms were quiet,opulent and clean, also had the biggest beds I had ever seen. On top of this the staff were very friendly and efficient and the food was lovely. My only complaint would be breakfast, the restaurant is not big enough and you had to sit in the reception area to eat breakfast. ",4,2018,02,18
150,First time and more to come,"London is a popular destination for me and my family that we visit several times every year and we do have some hotels that we like and usually book directly but this time I tried the Churchill hotel for 5 nights, very nice hotel, very friendly staff , rooms are clean and comfortable, food is excellent and location is perfect, what more do I need , I will definitely stay there next time ",5,2018,02,17
150,One of my best times in London,"The location is strategic to oxford ,Bond and all the delicious restaurants on Bakers street.we stayed for 7nights .quick check in,very friendly staff especially the porters upon entry and exit of the hotel ,everyday.the room was spacious,clean and had room service twice daily. Strong wifi connection,comfy beds ,ATM on premises and a beautiful lobby.Definitely recommended",5,2018,02,17

150,Very Comfortable!,"We splurged on a couple of nights at the Churchill. 

We booked a basic King bedded room and asked for it to be feather-free because of my allergies. We arrived earlier than anticipated and the room they had planned to give us wasn't ready yet. They offered us an upgrade to a room overlooking the garden in Portman Square, if we were happy for them to come and change the bedding while we were in the room. Housekeeping were very efficient and immediately came to the room and removed everything that had feathers.

The room was very spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom was modern and clean with nice toiletries and good thick towels.

All the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful.

We didn't eat in the hotel, but we had a couple of drinks in the bar off the reception. Wine choices were good and the service was excellent.

Very nice hotel.",5,2018,02,10
150,Cozy but super expensive,"We didn’t stay in the hotel, we live in London and we were just looking for a bar open after midnight during week days in central London (and apparently the hotel bar was one of the few).
The minimum spending for guests not in the hotel is £30 each at the bar, which in my opinion is ridiculous. The drinks were good and the location is cozy and warm.",3,2018,02,10
150,Sunday brunch special treat.But at a price!,"We took our son to this restaurant for his birthday. Starts at 12.30 till 3.00. Pre-booking is a must.
Basically you eat and drink as much as you can!. The room is laid out with lots of tempting dishes from oysters, prawns, salads, sauces,cold meats,right through to eggs bacon and full roast.Followed by delicious sweets.  
The waiters serve champagne non stop or any other wine if you choose, whilst you graze through the food.
It's very decadent and relaxing.",5,2018,02,09
150,Perfect for businesses,"Hello, I went to London in a business trip, I stayed at the hotel and I have to say the personal is very attentive, the rooms are very clean and ordered, the bath is very clean as well, the hotel is located close to Primark store among others famous store's. The food at the restaurant is perfect!!!! Very good! I love it. I do recommend the hotel.",5,2018,02,06
150,It is a remarkable  hotel all aspects for business and leisure,"The hotel is marvellous and fancy. The rooms were very clean, cosy and warm. The beds were very clean and comfotable. The bathroom was very clean and the toiletry provided was excellent. The staff were very receptive to comments and requests. The food was very delicious and has a lot of variety.",5,2018,02,04
150,Great Location and friendly staff,Stayed for two days - great location for Oxford St and Marylebone Village. Interiors are OK but though staff were very friendly and helpful. Not luxury by London standards but good for business and shopping needs in the West End.,4,2018,02,04
150,STAY HERE,"This was by far one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.  3 day whirlwind trip to London. Friendly driver picked us up at the airport (£144), he was very knowledgeable of the city, told us things to see and do, as well as places to eat.  Arriving at the hotel the bellman retrieved our luggage, while we checked in,  we were escorted to the right floor where we were checked in to our suite.  The room was quaint and lovely.  One small problem we didn’t have electricity.  They said it would be restored around 12 noon, we were fine with it, because we were headed out anyhow.  They apologized many times for the inconvenience.  Upon our return to the room there was a bottle wine.  Check out was simple, and easy.  Will DEFINITELY stay there again.  Lovely staff, beautiful room, lovely park to sit in.  ",5,2018,02,04
150,Great hotel in the middle of London,"We stayed in this hotel 2 nights and had a lovely stay. Staff is lovely in general, bed is incredibly comfortable, room is clean and quite big for London !
Restaurant is delicious. The bar's terrace is very enjoyable, cocktails are delicious and waiters/waitress are very nice and professional. 
Housekeeping is great as well. 
Regency club is quite big with a lot of choice for breakfast and evening starters. 
The hotel is central located, in a nice neighborough.
Would definitely recommend this hotel !",5,2018,01,29
150,Lovely quick trip to London,I stayed with my husband and daughter in a Club King room. We had a wonderful stay with a comfortable room and every attentive staff. The club lounge was really good with a terrific variety of breakfast options. The hotel is quite centrally located and walking distance to shopping.,5,2018,01,28
150,Top class hotel in great location in London,"Booked one night as a good place to stay after a show in London.  I am a regular at Hyatt hotels, and used a free night for this stay. It definitely warrants its 5* status.  As a top tier Hyatt member I get club access, and this is one of the best clubs I have visited - good food, excellent service, everything is top notch without being too snooty.",5,2018,01,26
150,Excellent hotel but prices seem to be rising,"Still a great hotel with wonderful service, however, the prices seem to be getting higher and higher.  The breakfast buffet is excellent.  Central location.  If price is not a concern then the hotel is well worth a visit.",4,2018,01,23
150,In the Churchill for one week,"The Churchill Hayat is an excellent hotel in regard to location and service staff. It , however is not the best in regards to room quality and food. It’s also overpriced. I still like it’s proxim to the shopping area and Resturants around . ",4,2018,01,21

150,The Unpretentious Hotel,"The Churchill

Pro’s

1.	A clean, functional corporate style hotel in a very good central area of London.
2.	A functional and pleasant staff that aim to please and can direct you to basic services such as the doorman hailing a taxi or the front desk recommending a restaurant.
3.	The hotel offers food and drink options that are both pleasant and diverse.

Con’s

1.	While the hotel offers a concierge desk and they are pleasant enough, they are limited in the scope of knowledge or services offered.  This is not the polished staff one would receive at The Savoy or Carides.  
2.	The popularity of the hotel means rooms are well occupied for the majority of the year While the rooms are generally in good condition, you may find signs of wear and tear.
3.	It’s hard to get around the corporate hotel feel of the place.  Room rates can suspiciously climb to those hotels that are more polished.

Hotel is best suited for:

Seasoned travelers who want a clean, comfortable hotel with services in a highly desired neighborhood and don’t necessarily require hand holding from staff.  Business people. 

Hotel is least suited for:

The uber critical traveler.  Those seeking an uber luxury travel experience. Those wanting to pretend they are the Queen’s guests at Buckingham Palace.

We were surprised at how much we enjoyed our stay at The Churchill and would not hesitate to book another stay.  We found staff pleasant, well intentioned, focused and appreciated the array of services offered as well as the food and drink offerings.  We appreciated the Omni-present security throughout the lobby and felt safe and secure. 

Check In

While there was a line for check in, the hotel does have a separate line for those that have frequent stay status.  We used the Hyatt Discoveries line and were immediately taken care of by a very nice and professional young man.  As we arrived after our flight from Miami, our room was not ready yet.  The customer service representative brought us to the executive lounge on the 8th floor where we enjoyed some coffee for about 30 minutes while the room was being prepared.  Our representative came back with keys and escorted us to our one bedroom executive suite with a balcony. 

Room

The Hyatt has basic configurations of room types ranging from basic hotel style rooms with double or king beds to elaborate suites.  

Our one bedroom, 1.5-bathroom suite was nicely appointed – but not luxuriously so.  It featured a living area with a large TV, minibar, fully functional desk, coffee table and side chairs and table.  The two bathrooms were next to each other in a hallway, and the bedroom featured a king size bed, large closet space.  The bed was comfortable and well dressed and in short while not the most modern, the business-like décor worked well.  We found the furniture ever so slightly worn – but certainly nothing to shed a tear over.  
The climate controls – a big concern in London – worked very well and kept the temperature of the living area and the bedrooms the temperature we preferred.  
Housekeeping did a great job in keeping the room neat and tidy.  

As is usual with large corporate hotels, we found the room in general to be decently appointed and truly did not find fault.  We did have an issue with the bathtub.  There was an area that was chipped, and indeed we only had a tub with a shower and getting into and out of the tub to take a shower was a challenge.  The Shower had a drainage problem and water would not drain out of the tub fast enough so we were ankle deep in water after three minutes of a shower. These are the issues that are routine in hotels these days – but not inexcusable.  Still, while these issues should be addressed they were not cause for us to storm out of the hotel in a tizzy and seek shelter elsewhere.  

Although we did not see other rooms in the hotel one thing that seems to be repeated among reporters is the various degree of rehabilitation the rooms have undergone.  If you feel your room was not recently renovated, ask if there is another more modern rom.   

Executive Lounge – The Largest Disappointment

Our room granted us access to the executive lounge on the 8th floor where breakfast is served daily as well as drinks and light bites in the afternoon.  The hotel features two lounges – one for those traveling with families and one for adults only.  I have had access to dozens of lounges over the years and I have to say this one was one of the saddest I ever experienced.  It was very clean, and the tables and chairs were very comfortable.  We just felt that the two rooms seemed like an afterthought and did not seem to have enough display area to feature the breakfast and snakes that would be offered throughout the day.   The breakfast spread was varied enough with eggs, meats, cheeses, breads, yogurts, juices and the usual suspects.  We found the breakfast food however to be inconsistent. One day our omelets were light and fluffy and the next was drenched in canola oil and looked like a sad rag. It could be a chef thing, but nonetheless the executive lounge should be more inviting.  
We visited the lounge during cocktail hour and while the hotel does have spate rooms for adults versus those with children, we were disappointed to see the separation cannot always be accommodated.  Many families consider the finger sandwiches dinner, and thus when the children’s room is fully occupied spillage occurs.  
We also didn’t understand how the liquor was displayed.    While there is a full assortment of liquor beer, and wine to choose from, it was displayed as if it were at your uncles outdoor bbq – with ice and glasses a distance away making the entire experience of having a drink before dinner a real chore.  While the room Is too small to install any sort of bar, it might be better to jut to order drink from wait staff and have them served to you.   

General Comments

We found elevators readily available and hardly ever had to wait but three minutes for one to appear.  Hallways were clean and quiet.  Our room service was always quick and completely correct.  Oddly, although the hotel appeared fairly full there was always availability in the restaurant and was very much appreciated.  The menu was diverse enough that a stay of 5 or 6 days would easily be accommodated without having to order the same dish.  Taxi service was readily available with plenty of taxi’s lining up outside.  We have been to more posh hotels and had to wait ten minutes for a taxi.  The Churchill bar was a gem with a very nice menu.  The cheese plate was a nice accompaniment to our drinks during cocktail hour.  

Internet service was extremely responsive and worked without issue.  

The Churchill can be a hotel anywhere – Idaho, Singapore, or New Delhi – there is really nothing so British about it.  However, that can be a very good thing.  Sometimes when traveling, you want to turn off the visitor space and just be.  The Churchill allows you to do that well. London is at your feet and all you need to do is step outside.  This is a big deal especially in London.  Many so-called luxury brand hotels are in fringe.  While I would not necessarily call The Churchill LUXURY, the area makes up for some slight issues.  

In many ways, The Churchill delivered all the services we needed for our London stay without the unnecessary ceremonies and extras.  We found the hotel to be enough.",4,2018,01,20
150,"Great hotel, great location ...","Went there for a short shopping trip and the location really paid off as the main high streets and shops are all in walking distance. On top of that, access to the tube system is around the corner with 2 stations close to the hotel.

The hotel itself is what you would expect from a Hyatt in London and just a little bit more. We had a good size room and it was extremely quiet throughout the hotel, even though it was full and you are somewhat in the center of London. The room was clean and modern in its design and there was literally nothing we missed.

For the purpose of our trip it was an excellent choice and I can see myself going back there, even on business.",5,2018,01,19
150,Terrific hotel,"Great hotel.  Terrific service, great restaurant that stays open late.  Remodeled rooms with good view of the park. I always stay here when in London because it has top notch service and I always feel welcome.",5,2018,01,18
150,Great Hotel,"Location in Good, very close to the famous Oxford shopping street and Edgware road. Many international restaurants are few minutes away. They have two executive lounges (one is alcohol-free suitable for children). ",4,2018,01,18
150,Overcharged for phone call,Charged GBP 15 per minute for 12 minute phone call which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. The staff just shrugged their shoulders and didn’t care. My advice would be to avoid using the phone at all costs!,2,2018,01,17
150,My home in London🇬🇧,"During the last 20 years I visit London regularly at least 4 times a year. During this period the Churchill became my real home in London. The quality of the service, the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff and surely the location- all of these factors make this hotel my best and only preference. ",5,2018,01,17
150,retrain / replace the check in staff.,the check in staff do they understand the meaning of the word customer service.?my answer to this is no they dont. my wife and i have just spent  a night here (we have been to this hotel a lot in the past year.while we find the hotel and other staff members quite good i feel that the front desk check in staff let the hotel down.  and we shall not be going back .,2,2018,01,17
150,Likely one of the best in the Hyatt Regency brand,"Just returned from a week long stay at the Churchill.  I stay here about 3-4 times a year as hotel is very close to my office when in London.  Hotel is ideally located (within 10 minute walk) of Hyde Park, shopping on Oxford Street, and Marble Arch/Bond Street Tube stations.  

For a mid tier brand, the service levels, room quality, and amenities feel like a higher end hotel (perhaps with some updates it could pass for a Park Hyatt).  It is a full service hotel with multiple onsite restaurants (Locanda Locatelli in particular is very good), bar, concierge, 24 hour room service, etc.  Over the years, I have especially enjoyed seeing the same staff (especially the room service staff), who are always wonderful and friendly.  

The rooms are not that large but decent for London and very modern.  The bathrooms are always spotless with good bath products.  Tip - you can request Molten Brown bath products by just calling reception, which are better than the standard stuff they provide.  

I have always found this hotel to be very comfortable - relaxed luxury while avoiding being stuffiness of some of the marquee properties in Mayfair.  It attracts a diverse crowd of business people and families and seems to be a preferred choice for Americans and Middle Eastern families.  I recommend this hotel as a good alternative for families who desire excellent hotel services but don't want to break the bank.",4,2018,01,13
150,An amazing experience,"The staff, management and location of the hotel are the best in the central London area. The staff members are so friendly and would do their best to accommodate your needs. The hotel quality is great. I had multiple experience during the past couple of years and they all were beyond expectation.",5,2018,01,11
150,Excellent hotel,"The location can't be better if you want to stay in Central London. The hotel standard is of high quality all through. The rooms are rather spacious. The staff were very friendly and professional. The breakfast was OK, but at a rather high price. The choices of cold items could have been better but the hot items were plentiful and very good. This will be our favourite hotel for future stays in London.",5,2018,01,11
150,Single night - very happy,"Really nice hotel in excellent location. Only moments from Oxford and Bond street, yet tranquil and peaceful. Huge bed and luxuriously appointed room, although minor criticism; the king room was kind of smaller than expected. Would still recommend a stay here, nonetheless.",5,2018,01,09
150,"Excellent location, another fine Hyatt establishment","The staff was generally great, especially at breakfast and the concierge. We stayed on the second floor and the bathroom was great. The Toyo WC is an awesome luxury. 
I did think breakfast was not consistent in quality over our stay of at least nine nights. 
I wasn't very happy about the unsecure Wi-Fi connection. They should do more and take cybersecurity seriously. A password-protected secure connection to the Wi-Fi network is a must in this day and age.
I also think they should do away with the carpet in the room and replace it with more hygienic flooring. Housekeeping could have been better but generally the entire experience is what you would expect of a Hyatt establishment so we're happy to be there. Nothing beats a Hyatt bed (and bathroom, apparently).",4,2018,01,09
150,"Great Location, Lovely Hotel",Spent three nights here and it was lovely.  The Public areas and the rooms are well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and my status offered me a late checkout which was much appreciated.   It's location on Portman Square made it very easy to shop on Oxford Street and it was just a short taxi from Paddington Station. Loved it and would go back.,5,2018,01,08
150,Perfect gem in the city,"I was absolutely delighted by the accommodations, decor, service, and food. The rooms are nice and big, very clean, and the bed is exceptionally comfortable. Its location is perfect for access to Hyde park, the tube, bus lines, and Oxford St. for shopping. Overall, wonderful value. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit London.",5,2018,01,08
150,Good intercity hotel,The Hyatt Churchill (London) is a very nice hotel in a wonderful area of London.  Breakfast offerings (ala carte and buffet) are plentiful.  Housekeeping requests are promptly responded to but had a few (minor) issues.  Electrical outlets and mirrors are not placed in the most convenient locations however these issues were overcome.  Closet and drawer space is limited for more than one person in the room.  Elevators come quickly enough that traveling between floors is not an issue.  The closest Underground stations are several blocks away and may be a problem if this is your primary transportation around London.,4,2018,01,08
150,Excellent service and great hotel location.,"Was here with family for vacation. The location of this hotel is great and within walking distance to Oxford Street and several tourist places.
Excellent experience during the check-in process. The receptionist Ms. Manal has been very friendly and helpful. ",5,2018,01,07
150,Not 5 star quality,Stayed one night in this hotel and used loyalty points to pay for my stay. If I was paying cash for it I would be very disappointed. Hotel didn’t have any of the things you’d expect from a 5 star hotel. There was no turn down service. The tea and coffee facilities were the same as a 3 star hotel with a basic kettle and sachets of coffee. The room was very nice. The bathroom was very big and did have a heated toilet seat. Location is very good. I have stayed in nicer 4 and 5 star hotels in London with locations just as good.,3,2018,01,06
150,Happily eccentric ,"I have visited the little outside area to the side of the Churchill Bar at the Regency twice recently and both times it was a genuine experience!!
The welcome is usually friendly, professional, and full of casual competence. The wines and nibbles come quickly and the lite bites are great with the crab towers and whitebait both worth trying. 
It is unusual to be permanently outside off a busy London street in early January but the combination of heaters, blankets and hot water bottles (elegantly covered like a long haired cat) mean the space has an odd look but a comfortable one. 
Why not give 5 stars? Well the last visit was marred by a clearly inexperienced but quite rude waiter - for the class of the place and the price - not necessary. 
Nevertheless a great place to go!",4,2018,01,06
150,"Great hotel, perfect location, friendly staff, great club room","This is a solid hotel at a fair price.  Value is excellent, and location is excellent.  No, it is not the NICEST hotel I've ever stayed at, but it was great - clean, comfortable and for the price, not sure it can be beat.

Located in Marylebone, an area that was recommended to me by a local friend, it's the perfect place to get anywhere, and a very short walk to a major tube station.  Easy walking distance to Hyde Park, and then just a bit further through to Buckingham Palace, Soho, shopping, food, etc.

Super special shoutout to Arnaud de Saint-Exupery - the GM - who I spoke with before our trip and he helped make it extra special (as my wife was pregnant, I asked him for help to make it so, and he did not disappoint).",5,2018,01,04
150,Great location in comfort,"A well positioned hotel which provides comfort, cleanliness and a good welcome.
It is a busy hotel but the flow of people is well managed by a very professional team.
Located near Oxford St, Marble Arch and Hyde Parks multitude of sights and activities.
A great choice for a family reunion to suit all tastes!",4,2018,01,03
150,Visit At Christmas,We had a wonderful stay recently for several nights. The staff were wonderful and were able to assist with any questions we had. Excellent location for shopping and site seeing. We can highly recommend this property.,5,2018,01,02
150,Home away from Home,"Absolutely love staying at the Hyatt Churchill. I would highly recommend the hotel to visitors travelling to London both for Leisure and Business. Besides having an excellent location close to the theatre, shopping, attractions and a plethora of restaurants, the hotel also has the best staff ever. Happy New Year! I shall return.",5,2018,01,02
150,Great Location,"We liked the location of this hotel, the room and staff was great. Simona checked us and and always remembered our names. Amanda worked in the club and was so pleasant and helpful.  The service was fantastic.",5,2018,01,01
150,I give it full marks. I rarely give full marks,"Exceptional
 We stayed here several nights. I give it full marks. I rarely give full marks

The pros,
Great central location. 3 minutes walk from Marble Arch tube & Hyde Park and 4 minutes from Oxford shopping street.
Customer service,  wow, really wow, at every level of help and management. 
Really comfortable beds,
Very quiet rooms. I rarely heard any sound from the hall or adjoining rooms
Great wifi
Great showers.

Club lounge :The breakfast was about as good as SPG lounges get outside of Asia, the happy hour offerings easily could substitute for dinner and there was an open bar.

Cons
Nothing really, I thought the staff in the lounge hovered a bit too much for my preference,  but really? 

I'd entierly recommend this place for an urban corporate hotel",5,2018,01,01
150,Christmas week stay,"Excellent stay here. Got the Satchi suite #806 for us. Modern deco with one and half bath. Standing shower in main bathroom. 
Mariana our housekeeping lady was the best I’ve come across. She is an older lady and was happy to work even for the holiday season. Vicky in the lounge as well provided good service. He remembered me and my daughter from our previous stay here. Now that’s something. Simone too was good at the 8th floor check in. The doormen here are amazing. Always friendly and happy to serve. Love this property.
Location is excellent. Only negative is the mannerless Arabs. 
Never dined here at the Italian restaurant but have heard good things.",5,2017,12,31
150,Central & Convenient,My first sta here in December turned out to be a very pleasant & enjoyable experience. My daughter & I shared a very spacious suite for about same cost of 2 small cramped rooms. Staff very friendly and helpful.,4,2017,12,31
150,Excellent hotel in London,"Excellent hotel in prime location with easy access to the shopping outlets in Oxford street and 5 mins walk to Hyde Park and marble arch. 
The hotel went under full refurbished last year with latest state of art of furniture and bathroom. The Churchill lounge is the best place to meet friends and family while having some coffee teas and snacks. ",5,2017,12,30
150,Great anniversary overnight stay,We stayed at the Churchill for our Wedding Anniversary to go to a show have a meal and see the Christmas lights.   The hotel did us proud with a room upgrade and some sparkling wine.   The location was great just behind Selfridges.   Everything about our stay was just brilliant.,5,2017,12,30
150,Ok,"Pros: Location. Cleanliness. Francis at the breakfast buffet; sweet helpful lovely lady who brightens up the place. She is an asset to the hotel.

Cons: Rooms are small. Bathrooms are tiny. Service should be better. Some staff members were quite helpful and friendly while others were careless and unprofessional. Was disappointed to learn there was only one restaurant at the hotel; the main buffet. We found that lacking of a 5 star chain.",3,2017,12,29
150,best hotel in London,"Through my experience in London, I am always staying at the Hyatt Regency - Cherchell, because it is one of the best and most luxurious hotels in London, combining distinguished services with a professional staff, and the hotel is located in the quietest and safest neighborhoods. It is also very close (less than a five minute walk) from the famous Oxford Street and Hyde Park",5,2017,12,29
150,Average afternoon tea... nice theme...not as good as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed tea!,"I was given the Green & Black's Afternoon ChocolaTEA for Christmas as I absolutely love afternoon tea and have tried many different twists as well as traditional tea so I was keen to try this. The savouries included a chocolate twist, the mini burger was nice but lacked the chocolate taste and the other sandwiches were pretty average and I certainly would not choose to eat them again. The sweet section of the tea was an improvement, I liked the passion fruit and white chocolate macaron(I think this may have been my favourite part) and the mousse had a nice tart taste which you needed after lots of chocolatey things. The other cakes and scones were quite dense/dry and not what you would expect from afternoon tea. The tea that was served was actually very delicious, it was orange, cinnamon and chocolate and was sweet enough to not require additional sugar. 

Overall, reflecting on the £80+ bill (£38pp then a service charge) I would not recommend this afternoon tea however, I think that it is ending in a few days anyway. It was not the quality that you would expect for the price and it is pretty unappetising when comparing it to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed afternoon tea at One Aldwych Hotel in London (£44pp). 

Whilst we were there today there was a festive afternoon tea which looked nice and may have been better...",3,2017,12,28
150,Great place for any occasion in London,"The location is convenient for theatres,  art galleries,  parks and shopping. It was a comfortable home for almost two weeks.  The Hyatt Club is very useful and hughly recommended. Dining options are very good  too.",5,2017,12,27
150,Perfect,Spend 2 nights in the executive suite and I have to say it was perfect.the hotel in general was excellent as were the staff and the food.our only regret is we may never afford to stay here again.it is also perfectly placed just off regent street by Marble Arch ,5,2017,12,26
150,"Good location, impersonal service","The hotel is in a fantastic location - 2 blocks from Oxford Street, so quiet but close to major attractions. The room was adequate, recently renovated. There was an unpleasant smell in the bathroom. Hotel was busy, staff were pleasant but not proactive.",3,2017,12,25
150,Avoid this hotel - £200 stolen,"£200 was stolen from my room by one of the cleaners at the Churchill Hotel.  This has never happened to me before and frankly, it is a disgrace. Avoid this hotel - they can't be trusted. I have reported the matter to the police and there is an ongoing investigation, which is not what I had in mind when I booked my holiday. Pathetic",1,2017,12,24
150,Superb location visiting in London,"If your a fan of the Park Hyatt's then this place is for you, seriously. I have stayed at Hyatt's around the world and many Park Hyatt's but the staff here is as good as most ""Park Hyatts""  they are well well trained and super execution.  We had a minor glitch to our restoration but it was handled professionally and gracefully.

Rooms as I understand were recently refreshed it appeared as well. Very clean comfortable and well serviced.  Sleep which is really important internationally was almost home like.

Food and beverage here is what you would expect of a highly rated hotel. The Churchill Bar is a treat for late afternoon or even lunch. 

If you have access to the Regency Club they have two here one across from the other one catering more to families and the other to businessmen. Again well trained staff. 

I will return.",5,2017,12,23
150,Brilliant location and Nice hotel,"Overall the best thing is the location of the hotel.  Room is spacious and general amenities are good. Expected to have a Nespresso machine in my room but there wasn’t. Hotel lobby is small, breakfast is good but waiters take a long time to serve you because they are few. Overall stay was satisfactory and London was brilliantly dressed up for Christmas :)",4,2017,12,22
150,Some glitches to resolve before I can give 5 stars,"The hotel location is the primary reason I chose to stay there. Being a block from Oxford Street and a stone's throw from Selfridges are good enough rationale.

The hotel breakfast was also quite decent, enough to last me through the morning.

The room was rather small, though not unexpected in a town like London.

But my biggest issue was the service. The staff were polite and all, but two incidents made me take off a star from what could have been a five star stay: 

(1) One evening, I asked to have my work shoes shined and specifically requested that they were brought back to my room that night, but it never arrived. So when I had to leave for my early morning flight at Heathrow, I had to call Housekeeping three times to chase for the shoes. In the end I had to scream into the phone and waited, shoe-less by the door. Ten minutes later, I saw a staff leisurely strolled down the hallway carrying the shoes, which constrasted starkly with how I had to dash madly to the lifts and down to my car, praying I didn't miss my flight.

(2) When I checked out, the front desk staff gave me the bill, which had my name wrong and an address in Berlin, despite I asked her and confirmed that she had my details and Hyatt Gold Passport number. I was left waiting for a good 20 minutes while she struggled with the system. Alas, that meant my breakfast time was gone and I had to leave the hotel empty-stomached for my full day of meetings....

I just think for a hotel that claims to cater to travelling business people (and charging no small sum for that), there really should not have been such issues.",4,2017,12,21
150,Really gone downhill,"I stayed in this hotel in 2008, and at the time I was impressed.  I stayed in it again this month (Dec. 2017), and I was disappointed.  Although the lobby is still stylish, the guest rooms are now extremely worn and drab (and small).  The fitness center (which the hotel grandly calls a ""Gymnasium"") is tiny and grossly inadequate. Service is distant and harried.  The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation.",3,2017,12,19
150,My new London favourite,"Maybe it was the choir singing carols in the lobby...and the mulled wine and caramel popcorn...or maybe it was the pleasantly spacious room in a city where small means really small...or maybe it was its proximity to Marylebone, our regular haunt in London... but I think the Churchill might be my new favourite hotel choice. A well run, well appointed hotel with excellent staff-  will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,12,18
150,Wedding anniversary ,"We decided to take in dinner and a West End show for our wedding anniversary and booked a night in a hotel too.  I found a good deal for a 1 night stay with breakfast at the hotel through lastminute.com.

When we checked in the receptionist asked us for the purpose of our visit.  We explained it was an anniversary treat.  

We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms, Rm 656.  The room was quiet and compact but perfectly formed in lovely grey tones throughout.  

When we returned from the theatre the front desk team surprised us with a lovely handwritten card, macarons and some wine, left in our room.  Which was really nice.

In the morning breakfast was also very nice and plentiful with lots of choice.

All in all we had a very enjoyable stay.",5,2017,12,17
150,At the Churchill in London You Come First,"The Hyatt at Portman Square is the place to stay when visiting London. The staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The food is excellent and the location is superb. The rooms are comfortable and clean.",5,2017,12,15
150,Christmas shopping trip,"Beautiful hotel in a perfect location! 5 minutes walk to Oxford street. The staff really wants you too feel welcome and safe!!! Ian the man at the entrance is the heart and soul of the hotel! Friendly, kind and polite. The only thing that was not so good, was the man who answered the room service phone  ... he was rude and blamed us for the mistake he made with our order ",5,2017,12,14
150,london gem,first class hotel with a great location convenient to everything. Rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished.  staff is very professional and courteous. has nice dining options both in hotel and nearby.  my only complaint is the gym could use some weight machines.,5,2017,12,14
150,XMAS STAFF TRIP,had a really good time room very clean and staff friendly and  helpful we all were made to feel welcome  looking forward to next years trip as we all enjoyed this one so much good location if you want to go shopping in regent street,5,2017,12,13
150,My hotel for sure!,"Very friendly and helpful staff in spite of a very busy weekend. 
room very good and excellently situated. hotel close to marbel arch underground station.  quiet room with nice view on portman square. will 
come back again for sure.",5,2017,12,12
150,Lovely Hotel with Some Surprising Problems,"I checked into The Churchill for an extended weekend stay from a business trip in London.  The hotel is very nice and employees were attentive and friendly.  I stayed on the fifth floor in a recently renovated room.  The room was comfortable and clean with very nice furnishings.  Unfortunately, it was not very quiet.

On Friday night, there was an event being held in the main floor ballroom, five floors below my room.  I began to hear the bass from the DJ who was playing very loud music in my room.  I called the front desk (at this point, not knowing from where the sound was coming) and they were the ones who informed me of the event.  I asked if the DJ could turn down the volume and/or the bass, but nothing happened.  So we sat and listened to the bass from about 9pm until 12:30am when the event ended.

In addition, on Saturday late morning, the hotel ran out of hot water and we were forced to take luke warm, if at all, showers.

While the hotel was nice and staff was friendly, I can't say that I'll be returning to the hotel, especially given the price of the room.  Be careful before booking here.",2,2017,12,12
150,Still a great choice,"This wasn’t my first stay at the hotel. You really cannot beat this location and the rooms are a nice size for Europe. The bed, pillows and linens are amazingly comfortable and the recent renovations are rather nice. The walk in shower is nice but no tub and takes up almost the whole bathroom. The staff could have been a bit friendlier overall, but it was evident they were busy and had some very demanding guests staying that week. Would still definitely recommend, although for the price I am sure there are plenty of options. My previous stay was out of the park customer service so maybe they just had an off week. Still for sure 4 stars.",4,2017,12,11
150,Perfect Location!,"The Churchill was quite lovely, at check in I had a little of a wait because I was early. The front desk couldn't accommodate me earlier even though I just came out of a 9 hour flight. I was ok with that, just that when the room became available they didn't have the courtesy to inform me even after waiting a few hours, I was disappointed with the Front Desk staff, usually they are really nice, but at check in, not so much. All in all, the hotel was beautiful, love the little fire place lounge area, so cozy. The rooms were super comfy, the bathroom had a nice tub and heated toiled seats (was impressed how nice it was). The service was on point, all Hyatt's service are! Also, the location was just perfect, owing it was my first time in London, it was very central to everything!",4,2017,12,11
150,A wonderful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel the period from 6th to 9th Dec 2017. And honestly, this was the best ever short vacation hotel I have ever stayed in. Starting from the doormen, to the reception staff to the room services staff, they were all very much helpful and very delightful to talk to...

The hotel lobby is lovely and big and very busy :)... The room was cozy. The location of the hotel is well located. You don't need to take a taxi, Just wear warm clothing and off you go...

In conclusion, I am surely going to stay there again and this time with the family..",5,2017,12,11
150,Vibrant and lovely but disappointed,"The hotel have a lovely lobby and big rooms (I have a suite though so not sure about the size).
Location is excellent and the place is buzzing with business men and tourists.

They have a lovely outdoor cigar place which i walked in but I was told it was fully booked although various tables were empty. I felt as a hotel guest they should have been more accommodating but it was not the case.

I might not come to the hotel again because of that.As a guest with a suite I deserved better treatment with all due respect",3,2017,12,07
150,Noisy and a bit snobbish,"I spent 2 weeks here in Hyatt as a pre-relocation trip to London in April. I picked up this one because I had some wonderful experience in some of Hyatt hotels in US. 

I booked with a corporation rate which was a bit lower than market rate, but still not cheap even for central London. Upon check in, the front desk first welcomed me warmly and then when said the rate was very low, and so on. Quite uncomfortable way...
Our company has a special relationship with Hyatt (I don't know the exact number but we did use Hyatt Regency for some off site events regularly and we spends $$$$ with Hyatt). If you are not happy with the rate... you may not let me book!

My room is on 2nd floor (British 1st floor). After a long flight, I really want to have some rest. But the door lock was broken and I called front desk. Instead of changing the room, they sent some technician here to fix it.

Then on Friday/Saturday nights, the venue downstairs held some events. The music was very loud and I could not sleep with it. I am not a light sleeper and slept well at hotels next to Times Square. So you know how loud it was. The front desk gave me a room upstairs for a night's sleep. But I need to come back 2nd morning. This happened twice and I asked the front desk whether I could change my room upstairs. Because obviously only room directly on the venue were affected. But the front desk said that it would not happen again. Yes it did happen again. And obviously they knew the schedule of their venue. 

Other than that, the hotel was really top level. Good size room for London standard. Comfortable American style bed. Very good room service. Very good(and expensive) breakfast. 

But if you are for business or care very much for sleep. Choose somewhere else.",3,2017,12,06
150,Lovely Hotel,"What a lovely way to spend time in London!  This hotel, while really well located, is class and quality from the moment you enter the reception area all the way until check out.  The staff are superb, nothing is too much trouble and there is pride in being part of this lovely hotel.  Our suite was huge, especially be London standards, clean, modern and full of the little touches.  You really don't need, or want, to leave this hotel, but if you do, everything is within easy walking distance.",5,2017,12,06
150,Great location and close to shopping area ,"Christmas in London is just magical . The Churchill is few minutes to Oxford Street . From end of November to December the Christmas lights on Oxford Street is more than enchanting . The Churchill rooms are spacious and well equipped with usb chargers , kettles and tea bags .  Depending on the kind of room you pay for bathroom can be rather small . Nevertheless you will not be disappointed with the Churchill . Staff are friendly and helpful .  We had to drop off our luggages for two days before checking in and the concierge was very helpful and had no problem with our request ( need to show proof of confirmed hotel reservation . Price is at par for a five stars Hotel standard . I would encourage you to check the price during weekdays and not the weekend online as room rate does fluctuate during different  time  of the week .

150,classy and comfortable,Impressed at how quiet the hotel was despite its convenient location for transportation access. The club level amenities and food were extraordinary and beyond options we've enjoyed at other Hyatt hotels.,5,2017,11,29
150,Great hotel!,"Stayed at The Churchill recently for business, really cant fault the place ""but"" I found it slightly unusual to come face to face with ""I guess"" a Japanese toilet in my bathroom, although being very practical ha!! It wasn't the best looking toilet I have ever seen and not that classy unless you are Japanese!! The only other unusual thing a I found was one rule in the bar area, they wouldn't serve you a drink unless you were sat down, when questioned about it we were told it was due to Health and Safety (very strange). Other than those 2 little points the Hotel was excellent and I would definitely go back ""hopefully to a room without a fully automated, plastic, cheap looking toilet""!!",5,2017,11,28
150,Worthy of its repute,"Of course the location is great, but smiling, friendly staff contribute very much to this classy hotel. Unlike many, definitely 5 Star as accredited, and for us, the place to stay in W1. Most London hotels are relatively expensive but The Churchill is definitely value for money. First rate and we will be back.",5,2017,11,26
150,Absolutely a crown jewel in Hyatt crown.  Great hotel on all levels,"Superb hotel:  Rooms are clean, business friendly with ample electrical sockets and USA adapters within wall, staff above par and the food is better then you would expect.  
The staff is exceptional from the front door to the 8th floor repetition.  
The value is also excellent, having stayed at dozens of hotels in London, I would now say the Hyatt Churchill is the best value for the money.
Obviously if you are a member - your stay is that much better.
Excellent for families too as I have stayed here with mine.
Location is the best.  Taxi's at the ready and UBER's only one to two minutes away!",5,2017,11,24
150,When I'm out of the US they always make me feel at home,The hotel gets better and better. Location is perfect. I feel that it is a very secured hotel. the bar is amazing. The bar manager always welcomes me like  she's known me forever Love her . When the door man really knows your name it something special.,5,2017,11,23
150,Business stay in london,"Stayed in London for work. Last minute booking very easy and being a Hyatt member excellent service and value. Would recommend club floor 8-9
Great food and good location. Lovely bar and terrace. Great feel and friendliness ",5,2017,11,21
150,Anwar,Very impressed with the service at Hyatt Regency. We were to check out 12 noon but due to our train leaving at 6pm the staff at regency allowed us to stay until 2pm. They were very helpful. Definitely recommend it. ,5,2017,11,20
150,Oustanding Experience,"I delivered a two-day workshop in The Churchill, and had the pleasure to stay there for the two nights of the event.

What an outstanding hotel.

For a modern and really well appointed hotel, Hyatt have managed to retain in The Churchill that 'old world' atmosphere that used to characterise the best of hotels.

The rooms are large by London standards, and the beds outstanding.   

But the most outstanding thing about the Churchill is the staff.  This team could not do enough to make us feel welcome and well cared for - both as guests and as event organisers.

I didn't catch the names of all the many staff members who went out of their way to make our stay a success, but the work Stefano and Ed did on AV and catering for our group was outstanding.

Highly recommended - I'll be back",5,2017,11,18
150,"Great location, great service, but rooms need an update and are a tad small","Fantastic location. Could hardly ask for better really. Right near Marble Arch, which makes getting about London really easy. The attention to service was also excellent. I bought my breakfast as an extra to the hotel room, which is well worth doing. I think it makes breakfast an acceptable price rather than over inflated. The Bar was wonderful (Watch out for the already included service charge). My only complaint, really, is that the rooms need a bit of an update. There was only one wall socket that had the radio/alarm, and it was on the other side of the room (Although the socket was an international one). It is a useless place to put it! Room was a little small, but considering the location that is to be expected.",4,2017,11,17
150,Great Hotel in London,The Hyatt Regency Churchill in London is a great choice for hotel. Fantastic staff and great rooms. The hotel is right next to Oxford Street and a quick walk to Bond Street for shopping. Close to Hyde Park for a run or walk.,5,2017,11,16
150,Great Hotel. One of the best,"Great hotel.  Old world charm.  Friendly and out of the way helpful staff.  A nice location, in a quiet part of town, but walking distance of a number of sites.  I would recommend this over the Hyatt in town which I found to be somewhat dark.",5,2017,11,13
150,Trip to London,We often visit London for a weekend break and usually stay at the Churchill. The hotel is ideally located just off Oxford Street. It is always clean and the staff always friendly and courteous. It may not be the cheapest hotel but it is well worth the money and we'd have no hesitation in recommending it.,5,2017,11,13
150,Great location fantastic hotel,"Great location close to shops and transport links.The location is brilliant for Hyde Park and shopping on Oxford street. Hotel was warm and welcoming on arrival.The rooms were comfortable, Friendly greeting from the staff along with smooth check in.",5,2017,11,10

150,Great location fantastic hotel,"Great place to stay everything nearby especially shopping! Hotel is luxurious and beautiful and the staff were great :) 
Breakfast was delicious too would def stay again as so nice 
Didn’t go to cocktail bar as it said mimimim spend which was off putting as didn’t know if we would spend £30 pp without even trying a cocktail ! 
",5,2017,11,08
150,Great stay,Stayed there for 4 nights during a business tour and really enjoyed my stay. The rooms are a bit compact (which was a bit expected given it centrally located) but very nicely done. Nice breakfast spread.,5,2017,11,08
150,Grand Old Hotel,I had a very short visit of only three days.  I missed the real potential of the stay but it was on display.  The Club lounge is a great attraction. It is better than most in hotels in which I have stayed and is a very important requirement for me.,5,2017,11,06
150,We always want to stay here!,"The location is just fabulous. A park infront, Oxford street nearby and a 15 minute walk to Hyde park! 
The rooms were comfortable, the bathroom modern. All that one requires in a London holiday. 
Can't wait to be back!",5,2017,11,06
150,A luxurious convenient hotel,"Situated just off Oxford Street and close to many restaurants this hotel boasts luxury and convenience. Being a victim of anti-smoking jihadism I very much enjoy the street level terrace forming part of the bar. Service and quality of food are very high and will definitely visit yet 
again.",4,2017,11,05
150,Excellent service,Great location and excellent customer service. Bar area gives priority to residents and really welcome you. Club lounge is great. Beds very comfortable. Stayed extra night befit was so good. Will definitely return!,5,2017,11,01
150,Great Stay!!,We stayed here for 2 nights while in London and enjoyed our stay very much.  The staff were extremely helpful from when we checked in to when we left.  The service and attention to our comfort was excellent.  They stored our luggage until our room was ready and promptly delivered them to us on check in.  The hotel is in a great location near transportation and restaurants.  It is a great hotel in a great location.  We would recommend it anyone and would stay here again.,5,2017,10,31
150,Good but not great,"Good but not great, notifying guests if there are functions that could cause disturbance would be an idea as we could have requested a different room/floor level, this has put me off any future stays.",3,2017,10,30
150,I wish I was in London more often just so I can stay at the Churchill,Although I travel globally alot I have not been in London as much during 2017.  In my two recent stays with the Churchill I am reminded as to what I have missed (in terms of great levels of service).  I was in and out of London on business twice last week and stayed again at the Churchill.  Although it had been a year since my last stay I was greeted like an old friend and felt like I had returned home.  The level of service of this property is exceptional and when coupled with its outstanding location make it a must stop.  Although these trips were all business I have also stayed at this hotel for a mix of business/family.  It is great for both - in fact my wife was very upset with me that she was not on the trip (as I stayed at the Churchill twice!).  The recent renovations to the hotel have made an outstanding property even better and again it is the experience and client service that really set the Churchill apart.  In a city of multiple choices this is one that is easy to make for accomodations.  It is truly exceptional.,5,2017,10,30
150,Great location,The location is brilliant for Hyde Park and shopping on Oxford street. It's a very short walk to the central line as well. Not all the standard room have desks which was a disappointment but the rest of the hotel was excellent.,4,2017,10,30
150,Great experience,"This is a great hotel that feels elegant and provides great service. 
Staff is friendly and food is delicious.  Location is nice. Near Marble Arch subway station, Oxford street and the Wallace Colleciton.",5,2017,10,27
150,"Great location , warm and cozy","Review is many months late but I felt that I should pen in a good note for the good folks at Churchill . 
Great location and a 10 minute walk to Selfridges. There is a nice supermarket across the square too. Rooms are modern European style and we were lucky to have that as opposed to another family in our party who had redeemed their Hotel awards points and received the older unrefurbished rooms.

The team was kind enough to let us check in at 10 am as we arrived early morning. We had taken a stroll around the neighbourhood and were pleasantly surprised when we received the call. 

There is never a better time to visit than the Xmas season. Good ‘ol English cheer , roasted chestnuts, warm punch and mulled wine for all guests at cocktail hour. It was fun seeing the staff set up an evening Xmas canopy and stand to serve up their  Christmas cheers in the lobby.

We had theatre tickets due to be delivered to the Concierge and they could not arrive in time. The Concierge Team
Assured me that they would keep them for me until I returned from a week in Devon. Upon checking with the sender a few days later , we were surprised to hear that the Courier had been turned away at the delivery post when they were informed that we had checked out! 
For an established team, I would have expected that they plugged the communication gaps by having left Concierge hand inform the right delivery reception hand that a package was to be expected for us. After dozens of phone calls between me and the sender and mails with the Concierge Team which were mostly left unanswered for 2-3 days, we sorted it out.
The girls were responsible enough to apologise for the mix up when I collected the tickets upon my return to London. 

It is not a gripe as I understand how staff can be overstretched in peak festive periods. However, the management may want to have some kind of Standard operating procedure to have the delivery post double check on whether deliveries and mails should be held on to instead of just checking off the guest list of that particular day. It will save your guests and front -staff loads of aggravation and smoothen out the after sales client experience.

150,Meet up with friends,"We have been here about 4 times with friends and family for the Sunday champagne brunch. Food was good a large selection, champagne endless. It is a nice atmosphere with live music playing and a nice place to go for a special occasion. We haven't stayed here yet only lunched.",5,2017,10,26
150,Churchill big thumbs up,"Staff were very friendly & attentive, location was excellent 2 mins from Marble Arch tube, Hotel was great, Club lounge really good to relax, have a few drinks & snacks.... after plenty of sight seeing, couldn't fault the hotel or staff, great stay",5,2017,10,26
150,"Friendly staff, nice clean rooms and great location","Just completed a five night stay here with my wife. As I have diamond status at Hyatt, we had access to Regency Club room, which has great breakfast, water and coffee during day and apps plus booze at night. That alone gives this place an A. But to add on top of that, all the employees are very nice and helpful, rooms are clean and modern, and location is near most attractions. We walked to Kensington palace, Buckingham Palace, Picadelly circus, took the tube just a few stops to Tower of London and British museum and a  8 pound cab ride to Paddington station (to catch Heathrow express). So you can see pretty easy or cheap to get around. Plus the area feels safe and good restaurants are near by",5,2017,10,24
150,Food and service ,"Wonderful gastronomic experience at the main restaurant. My friends and I dived into an al a carte three course lunch and washed it down with a crispy white wine.

The service at the restaurant was polite, fast and attentive. It's amazing how each of us felt we received personal attention and details to our comfort were made.

The breakfast offering could do with more bounty especially for gluten free and low calorie guests. The restaurant is very busy in the morning and the rush means hotel guests either have to come early or book in advance.",3,2017,10,23
150,Nice hotel in a good location with a great bar.,"We only stayed here for one night, but it's a beautiful hotel in a very nice location.  The room was large by European standards, and everything felt very up to date.  Restaurants and tube stops are close by, and the Churchill Bar downstairs was fantastic.  The specialty cocktails are a bit overpriced, but they're really quite good, and our food was delicious.  Service was top notch.  

As I said, we only have one night to go on, but I would stay here again, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.",5,2017,10,21
150,Absolutely Upgrade to Regency Club!,"Have stayed here a couple of times as it's around the corner from our London office. This time was very different as we upgraded to a Regency Club floor (6).The room was much better laid out with lots of space, when I stayed last time it was a really tight entry space that you had to stand in with the closet door open and back almost against the room door to use the hair dryer. A real jewel of this upgrade is access to the lounges on the 8th floor (one adults only, one family). They provide breakfast and a really nice selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks and hot and cold snacks from 530 to 730 in the evening. We used it every day either for breakfast, or as a place to debrief after meetings before going out in the evening. I even ate there instead of going out for dinner one evening when I had a lot of work to do. The lounge was also a lifesaver on our last day as our flight was delayed by 5 hours. We were given access cards to the elevators and lounges after our checkout time so we were able to work and relax there rather than sitting around at the airport waiting for check in to open. They even have the restroom stocked with toothbrushes, hand cream, and other toiletries which was wonderful after we no longer had access to our rooms. The service is incredible, both in the lounge and at reception which allowed us late checkout on our last day. We had lunch at the hotel restaurant one day, they have a nice express option that comes quickly with soup, salad and a small portion of two entrees of the day to taste (fish and steak when we were there). I was so-so on my last visit, after this stay I love this hotel.",5,2017,10,21
150,Reception not helping out,"Truly disappointed with staff at reception, Unable to process prepayment for stay. Taking so much time to process the check in. No team work, lets the new staff struggle alone. Less knowledgeable of the hotel.",3,2017,10,21
150,one of the best Hotels in London,"I really enjoyed my stay in Hyatt Regency London. Everything was really good, including staff, service, cost. One area maybe has room for improvements, which is the Gym. 
I believe that they could have invested in a little bigger area to accommodate more machines. 
",5,2017,10,20
150,Such a gorgeous hotel,Visited central London and the Hyatt two weeks ago and had a fantastic time. The reception area has a lovely ambience with the fire place at the end of the room. The staff are so friendly and attentive and the hotel is very clean. The location is great as it is walking distance to Oxford and Regents St not forgetting the designer area around Bond St.,5,2017,10,19
150,Value and quality,Great to be able to exercise all the points I’d accumulated so thank you Hyatt for allowing that and thanks for super personal service. I struggle to use the miles I’ve earned with other hotels and airlines. Great location. Good food. Love the Churchill Bar. ,5,2017,10,19
150,Classic classy london style,"This is our second stay in the churchill and this time we upgraded to a regency suit. Oh wow! Everything was available and of the best quality. Do avoid the mini bar, it is a tad silly on the pricing. That aside the room was the icing on the cake of our stay absolutely love it here in this oasis of calm and peacefulness. The luxury of the crisp white linens on the bed, the lush deep cozy robes and the wondeful Molton Brown products in the perfect bathroom all was as it should be. The staff were helpful and almost indivisible with pleasant smiling happy helping presence. The breakfast and luxurious surrounding of the regency lounge, complimentary with a regency suit room, was lovely and worth the upgrade. Id even suggest the fee if it is not with your room. Love this hotel.... we wil be back again. ",5,2017,10,19
150,great location with poor service,staying in this hotel is like a box of cracker jacks. there is always a surprise with every stay. sometimes the service is great while others it's not. you never know what you're going to get. dont recommend this hotel,3,2017,10,18
150,One night stay,"Overnight stay was again a great decision, have stayed before and was not disappointed, Club Room was excellent along with the Club Lounge and breakfast.
Check in was first class and also check out.
Just what you expect from a five star hotel.",5,2017,10,18
150,All good,"Stayed on a Sunday night so slightly better rates. Excellent location, all efficient from check in to leave. Had breakfast which is very busy and quite loud as restaurant is fairly open and large, food fine.",4,2017,10,17
150,Not suitable for business travellers,"I would not recommend the hotel to anyone who either arrives in the evenings or needs a late check out. On the evening of the check-in I was surprised to find that security barriers had been put up and so the taxi could not drive up to the doorway. As there was no bellman I was forced to drag my bags in the rain. On check-out I was astonished to find that a half day rate only gives 2 extra hours - whereas almost every decent hotel gives closer to 6. Finally, after more than 5 days after check out I still have not received my invoice - when I was leaving there was a problem with the IT systems and I was told that this would be emailed through. These are all lapses which are not good for a hotel which aims to be 5 stars.",2,2017,10,16
150,Great Club Lounge,"Fantastic location close to shopping and restaurants.  The club lounge staff were wonderful, and the breakfast spread in the club lounge was great as well!

One negative is that both the sofa bed and the rollaway bed were very limp and uncomfortable.  That was a big disappointment.",4,2017,10,15
150,Great location,Good hotel but rooms need to improve to the standard in the rest of hyatts worldwide. Cleaners need to be better managed. The bath tap was broken in our room but otherwise it's a great hotel staff all very helpful and respectful ,4,2017,10,12
150,A place to relax in the center of London,"A very cosy and comfortable hotel.  Friendly and helpful staff, excellent service, excellent beds.  We were there mixed purpose business and pleasure, great location next to Oxford but still in a green setting.",5,2017,10,12
150,Weighty name - mediocre Hotel,"Quite an underwhelming experience for a place who’s name appears to carry such weight. Remodelled rooms are generic and just about Ok. No steam room.  But quite a friendly staff of all ages who act and behave like they have been recruited right off the street an hour ago. And 
some quite delicious food

",3,2017,10,12
150,"Excellent location, luxurious hotel","Great location. Walking distance to major tube and bus lines, shopping, and restaurants. Hotel is upscale, has outstanding service, and fairly reasonably priced. Rooms can be small by American standards, but are nicely appointed with rain forest shower heads, Villeroy & Boch sinks, and Toto toilets. Perfect for stays in the West End!",5,2017,10,11
150,Another excellent stay,"This is my second trip to the Hyatt Churchill.  We stayed a few years ago with a preschooler and this time it was an adults only trip.  Both trips were excellent save for a few minor complaints - I highly recommend the hotel.

Location is excellent. Only a short block away from Oxford street and a few minutes walk to Marble Arch in one direction and the Bond St tube stop in the other. (It is located across the street from a private keyed garden with small playground that we used a lot on a prior trip but didn't need this time around.) Lots of stores and restaurants nearby.  

We stayed in a suite which was spacious and perfectly outfitted with a separate bedroom, living room, an ensuite bath and a half bathroom. The first suite that was available was on the second floor - we were concerned it would be noisy.  That fear was unfounded - there are extra panes on the window and it was very quiet at all hours. The bed was comfortable and the overall décor was very nice.  The shower was EXCELLENT - beautiful pressure.

We had access to the lounge on the 8th floor which had nice continental breakfast offering and evening canapés/cocktails.  

Overall a great stay but there are a few minor points that would have made our stay even better:
1. Room was not available when we arrived early at 11am which was expected but I asked that someone call me when the room was ready so we could access it as soon as possible. The staffer agreed he would. We left our luggage and went out for a further several hours and no call was received.  When we returned after normal check in time we found our room was ready. Would have been nice to have received the promised call so we didn't wander the streets for hours needlessly.
2. After we left our luggage, we returned about 10 minutes later to retrieve something we had forgotten. The luggage we had left with check in was gone and there was some finger pointing about who had it last. We then proceeded to be guided to several rooms where a bellman believed our luggage was being held only to be sent to the next one where it was not found.  The staff were all very pleasant to us and the bags were eventually found but it was somewhat unsettling to feel like it wasn't being tracked carefully.
3. The hotel felt a bit understaffed at the front desk and lounge. Everyone we encountered was knowledgeable and pleasant but there simply were not enough staff to accommodate.  Not sure if there had been budget cuts or some other issue but the standard of service (which is admittedly high) did not seem up to snuff on this trip.
4. On the following day, housekeeping did not come to tidy up the room despite being out all morning and most of the afternoon.  It was easy enough to remedy but some of the simple joys of staying in a nice hotel is to come back to a freshened room and made beds. I'm sure it was a simple oversight (perhaps due to the understaffing mentioned above) but not something I would expect from a luxury hotel.

Despite these small issues, we had a very lovely stay and would happily stay here again.",4,2017,10,10
150,Great hotel very close to Selfridges,"Very nice hotel in a superb location if you would like to go shopping on Oxford Street or Bond Street. Rooms are nice and modern, the bathrooms are equipped with high tech toilets including seat heating and moist free mirrors. The lounge is exclusive and relaxing offering afternoon tea and canapés, wines and soft drinks in the evening. The absolut only negative to mention is the time it takes from you order your lunch in the lounge until you actually get it is approx. 45 minutes (I have tried this on 3 different occasions, so I guess this is just the way it is), and the lounge staff (all except one) is in general not the same high quality as the rest of the hotel. However all in all I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,10
150,"Convenient, convenient, convenient","Five star hotel situated in an excellent location, immediately adjacent to the Marble Arch and across from Portman Square. Easy access to the tube and walking distance to many sites, including the Sherlock Holmes museum.",5,2017,10,10
150,Very good experience,"We were looking at staying two nights in London using some of the hotel points we had. After looking at options, we picked the Hyatt Regency London – The Churchill. Labelled as one of the biggest hotel in London, it is located in the trendy, wealthy area of Marylebone. Based on the clientele we saw there and around, the area is prized by international visitors who are coming to spend their way through the poshy stores of Oxford Avenue. We were slightly expecting that our stay would be fine but not great, with booking with points and not having Hyatt status anymore. We could not have been more wrong: as soon as Paul checked us in, he went beyond his way to make us feel welcomed. For the two nights we stayed at the hotel, we encountered very friendly and helpful staff. (We were also impressed by the breakfast offerings.) The hotel location was also close to Marble Arch station, which sits on both the Jubilee and Central line – getting to all tourist spots easily and quick. We would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.",5,2017,10,09
150,Excellent Sunday Brunch,"I recently visited the The Churchill for a fiends 30th birthday. We went for Sunday afternoon brunch and whilst it was more pricey than other places available it was worth it for a special occasion.

The service was excellent, the bottomless brunch of unlimited fizz was plentiful and your glass was continuously filled throughout the time you are there.

Food was outstanding, very fresh and lots of choice. Includes cooked breakfasts, meats and cheeses, roast dinner and puddings. You are also offered tea and coffee at the end. 

Highly recommend anyone to visit here, lovey relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.

Any questions please feel free to ask ",5,2017,10,09
150,Good.,Location is good. The rooms and amenities are good as well despite standard rooms are tiny. Good service. There is very good cigar bar - The Churchill and one of the best London Italian restaurant - Locanda Locatelli.,4,2017,10,08
150,great location,"We stayed for 4 days in Hyatt Regency Churchill to be in the heart of things in London before moving to Hilton by the Thames.  Hyatt has a great location being  in the heart of things happening . Though the service we received at the reception was great and the lady was good enough to give us a room with some view ,  however the  service otherwise was nothing to rave about , like going to a commercial institution. However the cafe downstairs had a relaxed feel and good service. They do have the  Locanda Locatelli  restaurant attached to it where we had dinner. Decent Italian food.",4,2017,10,07
150,"Great ""all rounder"". Good location, good staff, good rooms, good food.","This is a great all rounder hotel that delivers everything you expect. Decent location, friendly and welcoming staff, newly refurbished rooms with comfy beds, very clean, and great food. 

Sure, the hotel isn't going to win any exterior design awards, and you won't be getting any great views but its a solid all rounder 5 star hotel. 

I'd come from one of the best hotels in London (Cafe Royal) which is twice the price, and sure is more impressive to look at, has far superior facilities - but to be honest the Hyatt delivered the foundations of a 5 star hotel more solidly than the cafe royal. 

So, for a safe, sound 5 star choice go for it. Reliable, consistent and above all you get exactly what you expect.

It doesn't have the facilities of some other hotels (pool, etc) but I'd come back - it was a rarity to find a hotel that actually does what it says it will do - not too much more, but no less - and in a City full of hotels who over promise and under deliver this is one reason alone to book the Hyatt. I'll be back.",5,2017,10,06
150,Week end at the Churchill ,"Very nice hotel with excellent location to visit central London.
Nice refurbished rooms with the main square park view.
Bathroom is very nice furnished but defined small. Breakfast is a must and staff very friendly even when the hotel is full and very busy.",5,2017,10,02
150,Different Feel in this Part of London,"We stayed in two different parts of London.  The Churchill is a block away from a very active and bustling big city avenue (Oxford).  If you want that environment, then this place is great.  A short walk to many various restaurants and Hyde Park...but it is busy and a bit hectic in the neighborhood.  The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, professional and warm.",4,2017,10,02
150,Great hotel,The Churchill is a gorgeous hotel with a great staff and lovely rooms.   The Regency Club is a great bonus.   See the concierge for assistance and if you do not know what you might want to do.    The hotel is in a great location very close to Marble Arch.,5,2017,09,30
150,London Hyatt An Experience To Remember,"We loved everything about Hyatt London Churchill. The location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping, restaurants, and local flavor. 

The staff is exceptional. The food was delicious and options to satisfy even vegetarians. 

",5,2017,09,29
150,Not what I expected from Hyatt,Room was too small and with a bad view. Breakfast was always crowded and we had to stay in line for several minutes before we could find a table. General cleanliness was not up to other Hyatt standards that I have visited. The concierge that assisted us did not have a kind attitude. Something positive about it is the location! near many tourist attractions.,3,2017,09,28
150,Great Choice to Stay and Walk around London,"Stayed for 4 days and wished I could have stayed longer. The location is central to a lot of the tourist destinations. Parks, Museums and the Palace are all within walking distance. The rooms were spotless, up to date and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly, professional and willing to help no matter what the request. After dining once in Montagu's we could have dined there every night and been happy. If I get back to London again I will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,27
150,Not my best Hyatt Regency experiences,"It was very crowded. We were asked to wait past 1 pm although I asked for early check in during booking. Room was very small. You would not even feel that you were at a Hyatt. I have stayed at many Hyatt brands, in many cities around the world. This one did not impress me at all. The price on the other hand, was very high.",3,2017,09,26
150,"Fine stay, good location, great afternoon tea","Overall good stay.  Erick (concierge) and Violetta (registration) offered especially warm, helpful service.  

The location is excellent-  very close to Hyde Park, and easily accessible to the Underground and multiple bus lines.  

We asked for a quiet room and got one on a high floor facing the ""courtyard""-- the back of the hotel-- with a view of rooftops and a few sunflowers.  We slept well.  We enjoyed strong wifi, and also appreciated that there was room in the minibar fridge to add our own treats.

Just a few minor issues... two of our pillowcases were stained (we asked housekeeping, who were still in the hall in the afternoon, for new pillowcases).  The Toto bidet on the toilet didn't work.  I mentioned before our arrival and also later on the phone that we were celebrating an anniversary, but there was no acknowledgment.  Perhaps we have gotten spoiled by service at other Hyatts.  Also, we specifically requested turn down service, but didn't notice anything (trash still there, nothing refreshed).  Perhaps turn down isn't a common request?  

We enjoyed afternoon tea at the Montagu.  Wonderful experience!  There was live piano music in the lobby and delicious food.  We asked for a window seat so we enjoyed great natural light.  

We also asked for access to Portman Square park, which is right in front of the hotel.  It's not a big park, but we enjoyed a nice stroll as we enjoyed morning coffee.

We enjoyed our time and would consider staying again (though the Andaz Liverpool also looks mighty appealing!)",4,2017,09,26
150,Quality Hotel near Hyde Park,The Hyatt Regency - The Churchill is a excellent hotel with friendly staff and quality accommodations.  I have stayed here twice over the past few months and had a very pleasant experience each time.  The staff is very willing to be helpful and the rooms are excellent.  I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.,5,2017,09,26
150,A overall nice hotel. ,"Stayed at the hyatt and I would say overall a nice hotel. 

I don't feel there is anything wow factor about this hotel that I could see. But the staff are friendly and they have the amenities you need. 

The rooms I would say are quite basic but the refurbished rooms are more to my liking. 

Down points that the air freshener they use in the rooms are overpowering when you first enter your room. And I could not see any marmite at the breakfast area. I know other hyatts have this so I was a little disappointed. 

The regency club is cosy. But no one really checks your room card to enter. 

Also I feel the staff need some security awareness training as I was let back into my room after check out to try and fetch my bag. I was not asked any questions I was just let into the room by one of the house keeping staff. I could of been anyone and took anything I wanted.

150,Love it,"I really enjoyed my stay here, would come here again! The service here was amazing. It's close to oxford street, M&S, Selfrigdes and other shops/stores. The bed was so comfy. The bathroom had a rainfall shower, it was to die for.",5,2017,09,23
150,"Lovely, comfortable hotel, great location and service","After a long day of travelling from Oregon and were pleased to find our room was ready early and we could get in some well needed brief rest before heading back out for the day.  The standard king room was plenty spacious for our family of three, at a nice temperature and quiet.  The bed was extremely comfortable, I woke up without back pain for the first time in years!  Staff was lovely our entire stay.  

Location was phenomenal, extremely safe, walking distance to so many places and convenient to the metro and bus, but just enough off of the craziness of Oxford Street to feel peaceful. Selfridges is very close and their food hall is delightful.

We didn't spend much time in our room but the bathrooms were a big hit with their Toto bidet seats and nice spacious shower.  Had one mishap setting off the smoke alarm by showering with the door open, and had security at our door in seconds while I was in a towel.  Embarrassing, but didn't let that happen again!

Thank you Hyatt Churchill for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,09,21
150,Business Stay,"Very ordinary experience this time around.  Stayed here the previous week when I had to write down all my details, only to be asked the same questions again a week later.  No desk / chair in room so not sure how you're supposed to eat room service and couldn't even work out how to ring room service given that the numbers on the phone had worn off!  Waited 40 mins to then get a more suitable room.  On the second night, the TV went blank and wouldn't work.  No apology on checkout which was disappointing.  On the positive side, the team in the restaurant downstairs were excellent as per usual.",1,2017,09,21
150,Churchill hotel for visiting and seeing London & friends,"We had a long weekend in London and found the location close to Marble Arch perfect for our needs. Easy to get into the city, walkable if required (we did) and close to the shopping of Oxford St if that was of interest. Covent Garden not far as were all the museums that are free to enter, but please do make a donation.",4,2017,09,20
150,Great place to stay,"Spent four days here for a short break in London. Great location, great service. Excellent quality rooms. Friendly staff. It ain't cheap, but if you are going to spend the money, I would spend it here.",5,2017,09,19
150,Best 2 days in London,I arrived in Heathrow and took the express train to Paddington and from there a 10 pound cab ride to the Hotel. Room was excellent and the food and beverage service at the regency club were outstanding. I did not ate in any of the restaurants but had a drink in the Churchill bar and patio. Highly recommend the Churchill Martini. The hotel location is perfect. 2 blocks from Oxford street and a 15 minutes walk to New Bond street. I also walked through Hyde park to Harrods (about 30 minute walk). 5 blocks away from the hotel on James street between Oxford street and Wigmore street are many great restaurants and pubs side by side. perfect early fall weather so what could be better.,5,2017,09,19
150,Good Space,First stay here and will definitely be back for work purposes.  Only 3min walk from the Marble Arch end of Oxford St and really great sized rooms and modern appointments inside.  I use to stay at the Radisson Berkshire and hated the confined space and crappy lift.  This had 3 spacious lifts and all in all a good stay.  Price is hefty.,4,2017,09,19
150,Hayatt Regency the churchill London,"excellent location with great service. This was my second time staying at Hyatt, London , The Churchill.  Specially enjoyed  continental breakfast, beverages and light snacks and  dinner at Regency clug lounges",5,2017,09,18
150,Exceptional hotel - great stay ,"Had an amazing stay at Hyatt Regacy London for 5 nights. Upgraded to club level, well worth it, great breakfast served. 

The location is great, close to Oxford street for shipping, close to Marble Arch for buses or tube. The hotel staff was there to help, and really turned our trip to amazing memory. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Cigar bar serves a great selection of cocktails and cigars.",5,2017,09,16
150,The Churchill,"A grand old hotel located close to restaurants of all kinds, walking distance to Selfridges and the Wallace Collection, a spectacular free museum containing outstanding art, furniture, and armory. Staff is friendly and very helpful. ",4,2017,09,16
150,Superbly located hotel,"You could not be better located on the heart of London. Seconds from Oxford street and walking distance to so many of Londons tourist must sees.

Oh and it's a pretty good hotel as well! From the valet outside, through the many staff available to check you in, the excellent room (I stayed on 4th floor), superb bed, USB charger by bedside, self de-steaming mirror in bathroom, superb breakfast, literal silence at night and even during the day in the room, this is top notch.

Highly recommended.",4,2017,09,16
150,great location - great staff,"visited London for my birthday. As a Hyatt member, I always stay at a Hyatt and know what to expect. and, as usual, was a great place to stay. Staff members remembered our names and our likes every day. Front door staff was especially helpful as we tried to navigate our way around the city. On the downside: Didn't particularly like the small beds and there were no dressers or drawers to put our clothes away for our 4 day stay so we lived out of our suitcases.",5,2017,09,15
150,Consistent comfort,"I return at least once a year to this hotel. 
The only suggestion I would make is for the management to keep families with young children on the same floors. Having children running around squealing at 2.00am is a bit hard. Everything else is as you would expect of a Hyatt hotel - friendly, clean, great ambiance and understated style. ",5,2017,09,14
150,Elegance and comfort,"Elegant hotel with many rooms viewing the park in Portman Square.  Great location for walking to Christopher Place for reasonably priced Italian, Spanish and Middle Eastern Restaurants. Also close to Hyde Park for walking or joggging.",5,2017,09,14
150,Restrained  Luxury,"With a wonderful central city location, close to all major stores , parks and theaters , the hotel is the epitome  of understated refined elegance. The rooms ooze with taste whilst maintaining a  relaxed comfy feel.",5,2017,09,14
150,Very good,"Overall is very good. The location is good - not actually the center but good. We stayed on the award nights - otherwise it's too expensive for us. We ate once in the restaurant - excellent food, a little crowded when we were there.
",5,2017,09,14
150,Plus A,"I visit for business and holiday with family we all enjoy here as location is good and service is v good and staff is courteous we recommend our friends and associates to use this hotel, newly furbelows shed rooms are well done ",5,2017,09,12
150,Excellent time at the Hyatt.,We had an excellent stay at the Churchill Hyatt near Marble Arch in London. The services and staff did all we needed and we felt satisfied. This was a family visit with five of us and in two adjacent rooms. We got what we requested including king size beds in each room. Our experiences included a hotel with many middle eastern guests who also seemed to enjoy their stay. The gym had limited facilities and little use by guests. So I had a private facility. I enjoyed it. ,5,2017,09,11
150,Lovley Hotel,Very nice hotel. Rooms are clean. Nice bathrooms with great showers. Amazing toilets (you will know what I mean once you stay). Staff may not speak the best English but always very helpful and polite. Good location - 10 min taxi for on Euston station. ,5,2017,09,11
150,Part of Anniversary Travel,The Hyatt Churchill property was very enjoyable during our month long 30th anniversary travels. It provided relaxation and special comforts while in London. Club level made it more special. We would highly recommend this property.,5,2017,09,11
150,Hyatt members upgrade!,"As a World of Hyatt Discoverist (Platinum level) we got a two bedroom suite on the executive floor. The room was beautiful with Molten and Brown bathroom amenities as well as a full living room and work area. The property is beautiful, and the executive floor has full breakfast and full bar so the perks are great. Also this is a little more than a block away from the Marble Arch underground station and off Oxford Street, so the location is amazing.  Its a great place to refuel from a day of work or tourism and the staff was great, plus we had an extended checkout time so do some exploring before the flight back to NYC.",5,2017,09,09
150,Perfect,Perfect. Very comfortable and close to all ammenities and tourist attractions. Very central Good for shopping or walking in the park  Great food and very caring staff We enjoyed our time at the Churchill very much,5,2017,09,08
150,Pleasant stay,"We have stayed before and like this hotel.
The room was lovely, clean and comfortable. The reception and concierge staff very good and the restaurant staff brilliant.  All areas were very well appointed and very smart.  Breakfast was excellent.

Only one negative point.  We had to ask for extra pillows three times before we got them all.

We will be staying there again.",4,2017,09,07
150,"Beautiful, Comfortable, Classic yet Modern","We loved our stay at the hotel! It is quite lovely. The staff was welcoming, helpful and professional. Our room was comfortable and we especially enjoyed the heated toilet seat:) We had three adults in a twin room with a rollaway. The rollaway was already in the room upon arrival and extra towels and shower amenities were too. So nice not to have to ask. Thank you for plenty of outlets to plug in our various electronics and there was even a US outlet which was especially helpful for us Americans. The location was safe and an easy walk to good restaurants. For tourists, you are close to  Hyde Park and only a short cab ride to the top 'things to do'.",5,2017,09,07
150,"Great location, but with some issues: Recommend","▪️Location: Westminster in Central London. 
▪️Room: Smallest and least-appealing room we had of six on our trip. Furnishings were a little dated. Both our room and the hallway had an unpleasant stale odor. 
▪️Service: Reasonable, friendly and positive.
▪️Cost: Relatively high, but probably competitive for the area. 
▪️Previous stays: None, this was our first. 
▪️Recommend: Yes. ",3,2017,09,07
150,London vacation,"Excellent location for a London vacation. Convenient, quiet, very professional staff. Able to travel to sights, landmarks and events on the tube. Good choice of nearby quality restaurants. Would definitely return to the Churchill.",5,2017,08,31
150,Tauck Tour,"This location was fabulous!  It is safe walking around day or night, and the service was superb. We ate in the hotel a couple of nights and I would rate the Dover Sole a ten!  The rooms and bathrooms have been very recently remodeled and are quite to my liking:  quiet elegance. The hotel has a small feel to it, which I prefer. ",5,2017,08,30
150,Perfect location in Central London,"Please enjoy one of the recently renovated rooms on the 5th floor, with park view; the back side of the building might be noisy because in front of a huge construction site.
The rooms are very comfortable, clean and modern, Wi-Fi service is excellent and the outside Terrace of the Churchill bar is lovely for lunch in summer days.",5,2017,08,29
150,wonderful stay at The churchhill. Would recommend to anyone.,Great week in London and it was great to come back to the Churchill every evening. Concierge went out of their way to help us attend an event. breakfast was included with our stay and it was fantastic. some of the other patrons treated the staff less than kind but all the staff handled situations so well,5,2017,08,28
150,Our stay at Hyatt London ,"Very warm welcome. Thanks to Paul at the reception, to Francis from the Philippines who was so kind and helpful at breakfast and to the Rumanian lady who was so nice and friendly during our morning time. ",5,2017,08,24
150,Nice stay ,"I stayed at this hotel for a few days and I must admit the quality is good. Amazing breakfast, very professional and friendly staff, both at the lobby and at the restaurants.
Just a simple comment: I would suggest to have a better cleaning service at the floors ... sometimes the floor was dirty.
Locatelli Restaurant simply perfect!",4,2017,08,24
150,Delightful stay,"Enjoyed our 3 night stay celebrating our anniversary.  Stayed in a room facing Portman Square. Room was very quiet.  Room was nicely furnished with a comfortable king size bed. Bathroom was small. It was updated with a good walk in shower, toilet with adjustable seat, and sink area with good lighting and ample counter space. Molton Brown toiletries and a great Babyliss hairdryer were nice. Concierge in the regency club was very helpful. We enjoyed having access to the regency club. Also enjoyed eating at Montagu. Lots of good restaurants, pubs, and shops are close to the hotel. Loved the Three tuns pub. Easy access to the tube and bus routes. During our stay, one of the three elevators was out of service. Hope that it has been fixed by now. Nice staff, good location, and comfortable rooms provided us with a very good stay.",5,2017,08,23
150,Comfortable and quiet hotel,This Hyatt hotel was very comfortable and our room was very quiet.  The concierge was just wonderful both before we arrived and once we were there.  We enjoyed having access to the regency club as it allowed us to have a snack before an evening play.,5,2017,08,23
150,Wow! What a lovely experience.,"Must be the best hotel we have stayed in for a number of things. The staff were very good and the hotel and our room fantastic. The food terrific, and the location spot on. We also were pleased with the price considering the quality we received! Will return.",5,2017,08,23
150,Saudia and Qatar families residence,"1of 3 elevators didnt work for more than 24 hours .there was therrible traffic.we stayed on 9 floor it took ages to go up and down..
The hotel like 95 per cent muslims  that just had occupided the loby and all  public sitting area in the hotel.they maybe nice people but the vibe wasnt good .rude children and men and women with only eyes open in the burka...
We are jewish ,we were affraid to speak hebrew over the stay .

The hotel is clean and nice service but we won't come back .

I never will come back.",3,2017,08,22
150,A pleasant stay,"I stayed at the Churchill in May 2017, and I was pleasantly surprised, I booked a Portman SQ view King room with a similar connecting room for my mother. The rooms were recently renovated in a beautiful modern decor, very lovely neutral colours, the bathroom was on the smaller size, it was actually very small so a larger person might find it a bit uncomfortable, but I really loved the Japanese style toilet, always a plus. The room had a lovely view looking the square. A downside was the noise, and I am not talking about the noise from the street but the noise in the hallway/corridor you could really hear everything, especially when someone opens/closes a door, or knocks on a door, you'd think that it's in your room, but that didn't bother me at night as I always use ear plugs when I sleep so my sleep wasn't disturbed.

I tried the breakfast buffet and it was good, I also had an a la carte dinner at the main restaurant which was ok.

 Location of the hotel is perfect for those who love to shop. Overall it was a very good hotel and I would stay there again.",4,2017,08,22
150,London Vacation,"We stayed at the Churchill last week for two nights. I agree the rooms are a bit small but they were very clean. The elevator was ridiculous, it takes 15 minutes to get to your floor, as they only had two operational and the programming seemed to be off, as the two were always going in sync. Another review is also correct, the majority of the visitors were Muslim families. I only mention this as some men knocked me and my kids over to get off first, and it came as a shock at first. I would say 90% of the hotel's visitors were Muslim, or Arab. If you have no tolerance to other cultures then you may want to consider another hotel and away from this area in general. The food and service in the lobby restaurant was okay, but staying in August, this was a very busy hotel. There is a Italian restaurant next door that was 5 stars. Amazing dinner place.",3,2017,08,21
150,What great service ,"Check in was quick and manager on duty came to welcome as it was my first time here.
Hotel was really busy with Arabs and their kids. But the staff really went out of their way to help out others on several occasions. Loved the service totally. 
Rooms are nicely decorated with huge sit out balconies. Bathrooms have both tub and walkin shower. Have Molton Brown amenities.
Would like to say that Vicky in the club lounge was excellent.
Location can't get any better. A block clean away from Oxford street and loads of pubs & restaurants around.",5,2017,08,18
150,"World of Hyatt, World of Wow!","The Hyatt Regency Churchill is an oldie but goodie! Yes some of the rooms and areas of the hotel are a little dated and could use some updates. But overall our room was very nice and clean with a view out onto Portman Drive and into the park. We upgraded to the Regency Club Floor so our stay was enhanced through access to the 2 food and beverage lounges that are private to key holders. The food, snacks and drinks were great and the service attendants provided excellent professional service with a smile. Our room was comfortable, a King bed with down comforter and pillows. There are ample higher end amenities/toiletries in the bathrooms and the towels are newer and plush. A hair dryer, ironing board and iron are also provided. Our room was expertly cleaned each day and all hotel staff were courteous and helpful. The location is great close to transportation, upscale neighborhood and walking distance to Oxford St.",5,2017,08,18
150,Best service!,"The hotel looks exquisite and it is really convenient to get to the Selfriges and underground. Also, it wouldn't take much time to walk to Regent street and Oxford street. And the room is quite large and beautiful which made me feel like my home. What impressed me most was that the room service is flawless. We ordered a champagne in a late night and it was served in a really quick time. How delightful it is to spend two nights there.",5,2017,08,17
150,Chairman ,"I just checked out after staying 9 nights at Churchill Hotel Unfortunately,  the reception supervisor failed to provide us the suits we paid  in full a month before reservations and she was aggressive. We paid $1,050 per night per suite but she gave us a suits with absolutely no view and when you open the windows all you see is a plain wall and the quality of room is normal 2 star hotel. 

We have been cheated with the prices , those suits needs refurbishing or should be off market. 

Over all I advice anyone going to stay at Churchill Hotel not to believe the photos they publish on their web site. I paid top dollar to get cheated with suits not worth $300 per night. 

On the other hand the Hotel is under staffed but hospitality staff was professional and kept there quality of work high level. ",2,2017,08,16
150,Excellent value for money!,"Just came back after a great stay and the rooms are small but this is the norm in London, so don't expect any different here. Breakfast is fantastic and was a 100 times better than the best breakfast we've had in other hotel!!! Staff great and afternoon tea great.",5,2017,08,15
150,Unbelievable luxury!,"Great place to stay! I have stayed to numerous places in London, however, finally, fell in Love with London Hyatt Regency Churchill! One of the greatest breakfasts i have ever had in my life on 4 continents:). Location close to Regent and very convenient. Will certainly stay here next time!",5,2017,08,12
150,Not a value for money hotel,"I started on a business trip to London at this hotel. The check-in was quick and smooth. The staff were proactive and efficient. The breakfast is reasonable. The downside was the room. It's small and quite claustophobic. Considering the room tariff, it's not value for money. ",3,2017,08,12
150,Terrific last minute stay - exceptional hotel!,"My husband and I booked a last minute guest room here Valentine's weekend and were prepared to be visiting an 'average' hotel. We were completely blown away with the terrific staff and lobby decor from the moment we arrived! Here's why! .....

The hotel is ideally situated just off the West end shopping district making it ideally placed for both leisure and business. We received a really warm welcome from the reception staff and were shown to our room. Although on the price list it was the most basic level guest room we had booked the quality and standard of the decor and furnishings were impressive. For a London hotel the space was generous in both the bedroom and the bathroom. 

The double bed was clean and so comfy we enjoyed an afternoon nap before heading down to the Churchill's bar prior to meeting friends for dinner in the city. The bar was fantastic! We had a couple of cocktails (expensive but excellently composed and certainly delectable!) and absorbed the fantastic retro art deco furnishings whilst enjoying exceptional table service. We actually didn't want to leave - we even contemplated cancelling our evening dinner plans and staying!

The next morning the breakfast room and available food was nothing like I'd actually ever experienced in a London/UK hotel. The breakfast set room was very open, elegant, traditional almost french style where you could choose from a huge variety of options hot/cold and/or ordered from the menu/buffet. Truly, truly a tremendous asset to this hotel. The breakfast will stick in my mind forever!

Cannot rate this hotel highly enough, thanks to the Churchill for a truly memorable stay! We will be back 100% for sure!",5,2017,08,10
150,Excellent location for business or pleasure,"We have stayed here at least 6 times, for business and leisure since the location is perfect for both.  Even if work is in the city center, the tube stops are so close and if you are staying over a weekend, you would want to be here.  Walkable to Hyde Park, a few blocks to Selfridges and Regent Street shopping yet nestled in a quieter area.  There is a private park just across the street giving a nice view to the rooms that overlook it.  
Great service, friendly helpful doorman with taxi stand.  The bar and hotel restaurant very convenient and great atmosphere of a city vibe.",5,2017,08,09
150,Weekend Theatre Trip,"Excellent location and overall experience, rooms of first class standard..staff attentive at all times and willing to accommodate special circumstances/requests as required..would definetly visit again",4,2017,08,08
150,Great Hotel,"Excellent location and within walking distance to the underground, restaurants and shops.  More of a business hotel with super comfy beds.  We really enjoyed our stay there and thought the staff was great.  Would def stay again.",5,2017,08,08
150,"Good, but front desk customer service lacking","I really enjoy staying at this hotel, but the customer service on the front desk is inconsistent for such a star hotel.

I really like this brand, but I find this lack of customer focus a real let down.

The lounge on the executive floor is super! I fully recommend a room with executive access.

Close to Selfridges&Co which I love.",4,2017,08,06
150,Not particularly ecofriendly,"I don't have much to say about service, but in term of being ecofriendly, this place is really poor. I am staying here for a week. So far,  everyday, the cleaning staff throw away the soap,shampoo etc I was using and replacing it with a new one. I just think this is a terrible practice.

They also charge a £5 fee for borrowing some cuttlery to use in your room, which I think is a strange practice.",1,2017,08,04
150,Nothing special and very slow service,"We visited in July and it was really cold in London, around 18C. The reception finally picked up after I called ten times on Sunday evening for an extra blanket. The blanket was delivered about at least 20 minutes later as my boyfriend and I both fell asleep already. 

The next morning I asked the reception to turn the heat on in our room since the AC only delivered cold air. She said she will send a technician up. I waited in my room for another 20 minutes and no one came up. I left to tour London instead of wasting time waiting in my room. But the good thing is when I came back I found a heater in my room. (But the heater didn't produce enough heat for us to feel warm in our room). 

When we checked out, I asked the concierge to help me bring my luggages down. She said to have a seat as they need 15 minutes to do that. So I was sitting on the sofa and waited twenty minutes. Then I asked them, where are my luggages. They called and found out my luggages have already been brought outside.... At this point, I have decided that I will never ever stay in Hyatt London again because I find it extremely odd that it never occurred to them to at least tell me that my luggages have been brought down. I am imagining they magically think I will find my own luggages OUTSIDE.",2,2017,08,03
150,London in July,"Great hotel, perfect location near Marble Arch Tube station.  Very professional and friendly staff. Enjoyed the Chocolate Tea as well as beverages in the Churchill bar. The bar is quite nice and the staff is very knowledgeable with cocktails and the service of cocktails.",5,2017,08,02
150,Perfect location for college visits - summer 2017,"Good London base for a couple of days of college/university visits - London School Economics,  University College London and others all within walking distance or a couple of blocks to the tube station.  Oxford street, Marble Arch all close.  Two nights on points - great modern air conditioned room overlooking a little park with a couple of US and European outlets and wifi.  Lounge access is lovely with good continental breakfast, tea, beer, wine and snacks throughout the day.  Staff all extremely helpful and London is very welcoming to tourists.",5,2017,08,01
150,Brilliant brunch ,"Twelve of us had a lovely Champagne brunch at the Montagu today. Couldn't have been better. Superb service, copius champagne and a very high quality buffet brunch. This was the perfect venue for our family get together. Thanks to the management and staff at the Churchill for making this a memorable day. 
",5,2017,07,30
150,"Nothing Special, but Adequate","Reviewer is Hyatt Globalist and we visited 5 properties on a recent European trip, and this was the least favorite.  The room was adequate but nothing special.  There really was no special effort for service and the concierge was not extremely helpful.  The staff was not as friendly as other hotels.

The club level was okay, but with limited hours.  Unlike other Hyatts, the free breakfast for Globalist was limited to the Hyatt club, which was a pretty poor example of a European breakfast.  The location is good, but other hotels we have stayed at in a London were better - the Andaz, the Waldorf, the Sanderson, etc.  The Churchill is adequate, but nothing special. ",3,2017,07,27
150,"Worth checking out, not sure it's worth it to bundle ","We bundled this with a historical London walking tour with Westminster and the war rooms. The first part was with a mediocre guide, the best part was the war rooms! Very interesting! That part of the Tour came with an audio guide, not a personal guide. The only benefit of the bundling was perhaps skip the line access to war rooms. ",4,2017,07,26
150,Fantastic hotel with equally great service,"We have stayed at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill twice now, and each time it has been outstanding. We discovered this hotel originally when it was booked for us through Costco Travel. Both times we were booked into a Club Regency room, which includes a world-class breakfast service, and access to a private lounge on the 8th floor. 

Our room was nice, clean and fully functional, but certainly not jaw dropping impressive. But I don't go to a hotel to hang out in a hotel room. Just a nice clean place to sleep.

We ordered room service one night, and again, the service was top notch. I felt like a King at this place! 

The location of the hotel is in the high-end Marylebone district, which is very close to Oxford Street and the Marble Arch Tube station. 

The hotel is great, but I have to say that the staff is what puts this hotel above and beyond most others. Especially at the Montagu restaurant, which is the in-hotel restaurant that serves breakfast each morning. The breakfast each morning (we stayed there six days) was a highlight of the day. Again, the staff was First Class all the way, took care of everything, with little requests from myself or family.

I look forward to staying at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill again!",5,2017,07,25
150,A great time and visit in London,"We were on tauck tour. The hotel was great with wonders staff and plenty of food options and stores , museums and places to go and see. Fabulous location. The multiple on site restaurants were great. You could get anything from a smack to a delicious high end meal. Thanks ",5,2017,07,24
150,Fabulous Service,We arrived at The Churchill at 3:30 in the morning from Croatia. The front desk staff was exceptional. Lorenzo checked us in and made sure that we had a late checkout and breakfast so that we could truly enjoy our stay. We felt very well taken care of and the location was perfect for us! ,5,2017,07,23
150,Amazing ,"Everything is wonderful about this hotel! Great staff who let you into the private park across the street. Amazing traditional breakfast. Super comfort rooms, convenient to tube and buses and within walking to St Christopher's Place.",5,2017,07,22
150,Lovely stay Just too short ,Had a lovely stay at the hotel from the minute we arrived to when we checked out. The staff were amazing and so helpful with our little 6 month old. The rooms were exquisite and the location was great. One tip is not to stay on level 2 as it is a bit noisy given the gym is on this floor. Will be back for sure. ,4,2017,07,20
150,Charming elegance,"Looking for an elegant high level bar in London, You are absolutely right in the Churchill.
Sitting outside you can have dinner, just a drink and/or a snack in a nice ambiente and with a great service. A fine choice of food, beautiful wines guarantee a perfect evening with your partner. Prices are adequate and individual needs are fulfilled.
The most polite and well mannered person there is Joe Herbert.",5,2017,07,20
150,Terrific Stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill,"My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill for six nights in July 2017, primarily because we were attending the Wimbledon tennis matches.  The hotel was superb.  We had used air miles for the purchase and were surprised at the ample size of our room.  Although we were on the fourth floor, we had Regency Club privileges on the ninth floor--a very nice place to have breakfast and other offerings during the day.  We also liked the fact that for travel to Wimbledon, the hotel is very close to the bus stop at Marble Arch, where we could catch a bus direct to the tennis courts, with a drop-off point directly across the street from the entrance (as opposed to the train which entails a walk of a mile or so to the tennis courts.  We aenjoyed the excellent service and food in the hotel restaurant--The Montagu.  Of course, we also dined at the neighboring Locanda Locatelli restaurant, where we had a spectacular meal.  All in all, our experience was terrific!  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,07,20
150,"Great Location, Consistant High Standard","We have stayed at this Hotel for years. A renovation has taken place over the years. We are Hyatt Club members and enjoy the amenities available. Such as breakfast, evening cocktails and snacks. You are within walking distance to many restaurants and major shopping. The staff is friendly and remember us from previous visits. We had a suite which was lovely with a walk in closet. A desk was there for business, also a vanity area. Molton Brown products are supplied in the bathroom that had both a tub and separate shower.",5,2017,07,19
150,Hotel lives up to its Churchill name,From the first contact nothing but class and courtesy! The staff in the restaurant came to recognize me instantly and what my preferences were. I found that very endearing and well taken care of. The bar can use some more lively music.,5,2017,07,19
150,Great customer service and impeccably maintained hotel,"We got to the hotel at 8:30 a.m. from the states and really wanted to check in to take a quick nap before hitting the town but knew it was unheard of to check in that early. We spoke with an Esther when we went to the front desk and although they didn't have a room ready immediately she got us a room by 11:00 a.m. when regular check-in wasn't until 3:00 p.m! We had that much needed nap:)

In regards to the room, the upkeep is amazing and unbelievable clean! It has central a/c and a king size bed!! The bathroom was big and very clean!

The closest subway station (""tube/underground station) is Marble Arch on the Central line so it is very easy to get anywhere using the subway but any Uber we took was never more than 13-15 GBP. 

Whether the breakfast is included or not, definitely check out the breakfast buffet! They have some of the best waffles I've ever had and have a very, very wide range of options to choose from.",5,2017,07,18
150,The best just outside of central London,"You have options of walking, metro, bus or taxi from the hotel. It is a good part of town and we felt secure and welcomed. 

We had a room on the 6th floor. Nice view of the park. The bathroom was top notch. Especially the heated toilet. 

Mini bar not included but fresh water on the daily is. As a globalist, we had free breakfast but I don't think that's applicable for everyone. It was good. Different from the States, but good.",5,2017,07,18
150,"Excellent location, far too expensive","Slow checkin, concierge was unable to book theater tickets, room not according to confirmation(no park view, not on high floor), very good breakfast buffet, nicely renovated room, elevator waiting time often relatively long",3,2017,07,18
150,The best staff in the world !,"This is a wonderful hotel, centrally located, but what makes it top top top, is the very friendly, ever helpful and always smiling staff. The restaurant is very good and usually there is live music and a changing exhibit of paintings.",5,2017,07,17
150,Excellent focus on customer care and satisfaction,"Terrific staff all working together to make a business stay most enjoyable, practical and effortless. A very well managed property. Hugely comfortable bed and premium linens. Request rooms away from the lifts.

",5,2017,07,16
150,Great Stay!,Hotel is located in an excellent part of London. Popular attractions and excellent restaurants are within walking distance. Easy access to London's overground transit system allows visitors great flexibility in choosing venues. All members of the staff with whom we interacted showed genuine interest in making our stay comfortable and enjoyable. ,4,2017,07,15
150,Incredible hotel ,"A recent 2016 multimillion dollar renovation makes this hotel, in the heart of shopping and dining and super cars, a truly wonderful place to rest in between tours and sightseeing. 

The Hyatt Regency Churchill has clean modern lines, digital toilets (my boys thought that was superb), digital AC controls, American and USB outlets, upgraded closet space with quiet shut drawers and motion sense lighting. 

The rollaway cot (standard European beds are smaller than American standards with very few double queens) was more plush and thicker than standard pull out couch mattress but still too short for my 13 year old 5'6"" #130 son.

Complimentary waters were brought each day for everyone in the room.  The laundry service was pricey but immaculate, delivered in a cute wicker basket, folded with tissue paper, and smelling better than my normal laundry! 

Breakfast buffet in the morning appears like a provincial village farmers market with a delightful array of savory and sweet. 

I can't speak to the value of the breakfast or even the hotel as cost was included with our guided tour of London. 

Note - the locked key garden across the street is accessible from the concierge. We regret not having time to explore it. ",5,2017,07,15
150,Excellent location and friendly staff,"We stayed here for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The staff were very helpful, the food was good and we had a decent sleep. The location in Mayfair is excellent for all the main attractions.",4,2017,07,14
150,when luxury needs to be redefined,"High luxury hotels are becoming out of trend nowadays , hospitality needs to be redefined to meet the customer needs in this century that goes beyond a nice location with clean rooms, its all about the experience, the knowledgeable staff, the perfect concierge that gets you to places online cannot take you there... Hyatt you need to work out the overall experience! Very disappointing!",3,2017,07,14
150,Saturday Italian Brunch - AMAZING,We visited for a birthday celebration for the Saturday Italian style brunch. It was excellent from start to finish. The staff were brilliant and so attentive. Our glasses never went long without being topped up again with a drink of our choice! I thoroughly enjoyed the aeporol spritz they were wonderful. The food is delicious and the desert table is dangerously good!!,5,2017,07,13
150,Perfect location and perfect hosts,"Myself and my partner stayed for 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency, we stayed in a club room facing Portman square. Check in was very swift even though we arrived early they whisked us up into the club lounge to have breakfast whilst we waited for our room to be made up. On arrival into the room it was decorated to a good standard and was immaculately clean. The bed was amazing, very comfortable and provided a very comfortable nights sleep. The shower was spacious and was a beautiful rain shower. On the morning the breakfast was served in the club lounge, it was a buffet breakfast, which isn't my first choice but it had good quality produce supplied. The downside for me was the service on the first morning there was two waiting staff in the smaller lounge, the male was of Asian origin and the female Eastern European. No welcome was given on our arrival, no tea was offered, when we caught someone's eye they brought the tea over with no tea spoon, there was no sauces left out for guests and had to ask for these when we caught someone's eye. There was no plates no collect your food on and no fresh juice out which we both had to ask for. Second morning we attended this time there was only the male Asian waiter, again no welcome, no offering of tea, on catching his eye again, no tea spoon and this time no milk. Again no sauces left out for guests so had to be asked for again. I suggest retraining in your club lounges as guests expect a basic service as the above I would still expect in a lesser hotel than yourself. I expect at least the basics in customer service and not having to keep asking for stuff that your waiting team should be offering/doing. That is my only fault with our stay otherwise this hotel is a very good quality hotel and the rest of the services we experienced were amazing, it's just a shame that the club lounge isn't up to scratch. If it helps we stayed from the 9th July to the 12th July.",4,2017,07,13
150,Beautiful hotel,What a beautiful hotel with incredible staff! We enjoyed every moment and truly experienced Hyatt's amazing service. Every question we had was answered quickly and the staff did everything to make our stay perfect. ,5,2017,07,11
150,Nice n staff great,"U feel home its great n staff r sweet too. Quite posh too so i like it i feel special and pampered here.

A lot of different nationalities so on a social level its great too. I like the room but bathroom too small. ",5,2017,07,11
150,Easy walk to Hyde Park,"This hotel is outstanding! We were able to walk to Hyde Park to tour it and Marble arch underground entrances were very handy. 
The Churchill is very well appointed and the staff couldn't be any more helpful. They are courteous and polite. We had access to the concierge floor due to status. The breakfasts they offer is wonderful as well as the evening selections were also great! 
This hotel is worth a visit! 
",5,2017,07,10
150,Hits the important buttons,"Great stay. Appreciated a complimentary upgrade. The Regency Club seemed over crowded at peak AM time, and I wish they had real eggs vs. powdered. The staff is amazing except the bellhops whom are a little long in the tooth. Dinner at the Italian restaurant was excellent. Overall it was an excellent stay, room, and service level. Easy walk to Starbucks / Costa and other coffee places, and just a few min walk to Marble Arch.",5,2017,07,10
150,Beautiful hotel,"Safe, elegant, friendly, quiet and clean!! Very close to a lot of great things to see in London. Many things within walking distance. The food at the hotel was excellent and the attached bar and restaurants were outstanding!!",5,2017,07,09
150,Top Class Accomodation & Excellent Service,"In difficult circumstances, my elderly father and I shared a recently refurbished suite with interconnecting rooms.....It was absolutely top class, a much needed 'home from home'.
All the staff, especially in Reservations & Room Service bent over backwards to help with some pretty demanding requests ....... The kindness shown and consideration of our circumstances was quite exceptional, I didn't expect that and wouldn't have assumed a large group hotel would have been capable of being so accommodating & personable. 
My thanks go to you all",5,2017,07,09
150,Wonderful and Convenient Hotel,Wonderful and conveniently located hotel.  The Club level was excellent although one had to ask for the hot food in the evening or you would not get it.  The concierge was knowledgeable and very helpful.,5,2017,07,09
150,Dublin vacation,"The hotel is nice, but as a Hyatt reward member they didn't make you feel special.  The male staff in the bar were great - very attentive and responsive. The female staff ignored us most of the time.  I actually had to go to the bar myself to get my drinks.",3,2017,07,09
150,Very good in all respects,"Superb location in London. Very comfortable rooms - the beds were hard to get out of in the morning and the quality of sleep on them was great. 
The bathroom was well appointed. The over-bath shower was wonderfully powerful - the only slight criticism was that the spray was so intense that it was difficult not to wet the floor through!
Service could not have been better - everything we asked for was provided straight away. Very friendly reception and concierge staff. 
I found it very expensive to reserve interconnecting rooms - £60 per room per night - which makes the door between the two rooms a very expensive piece of kit. Something to watch out for it you're thinking of booking adjoining rooms",4,2017,07,08
150,Very nice hotel but....,"We cashed in points to stay at this $300-$400 per night hotel.  Good location near Marble Arch, big enough standard room, very nice staff, etc.  However, they charge more than a pound PER MINUTE to make a local call.  Very irritating when you want to contact fellow travellers at a different hotel, etc.  Do not order chicken marsalla unless you want it unusually spicy (the majority of the guests are from middle-eastern countries which like it that way.  In summary, very nice place, but it is not for a person who is trying to manage va acation budget.",4,2017,07,07
150,"Good location, noisy rooms","We loved the location, across from a park and in Mayfair. The hotel lobby is very attractive and hotel is elegant and clean. Downside is that the rooms have very poor sound proofing and the rooms are noisy, You can hear all that is going on in the hallway from your room and every time a room door outside closes and shuts, it it heard loud and clear. I had to use earplugs to sleep and earplugs are never that comfortable.",3,2017,07,06
150,Decent hotel. Awesome location!,"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill for a business trip to London. First off, it’s in a great location - close the Marble Arches, and many good shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is okay - feels a bit cold and outdated in terms of interior. It also feels super hectic throughout the lobby and not at all tranquil. But the staff are very nice and accommodating. And the rooms are comfortable. I also lunched in the restaurant, which was very nice. While this is definitely not my favorite hotel in London, I’d stay again just for the location.",4,2017,07,06
150,The Churchill is a gem,"Being a World of Hyatt Globalist, I am used to good treatment/stays, however the Regency Churchill in London surpasses that!  I would/will clearly and wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to any/everyone",5,2017,07,06
150,Great Concierge Service and Location,"We had a great stay. The location was great because it was within easy walking distance to transportation, but not in a crowded area.  The hotel staff was extremely helpful, particularly the concierge desk.  It was great location to come back to after a long day of touring.",5,2017,07,06
150,Hyatt London - Churchill,"Bendict Spinoza, 17th Century Philospher, once said (in Latin), sed omnia praeclara tam dificilia quam rara sunt. Translation meaning, ""But everything great is just as difficult to realize as it is rare to find.""  The Hyatt Regency London - Churchill, is dificilia to realize and rare to find.",5,2017,07,06
150,"excellent business hotel, not so much families","Very elegant, first class hotel in the heart of London by Marble Arch tube stop.  Excellent concierge, housekeeping and door service.  However, note it's not really a great vacation spot:  it's a little far from most of the major tourist attractions, although it is next to the major shopping areas of London.  It seems to be set up mostly as a business hotel, fast wi-fi, business center and we noted some conference rooms, and they do provide complimentary bottled water.  Only catch for us is they only allow 3 people per room, so with two kids, we had to get a second room.  Unusual for a Hyatt, as we've stayed as a family in them all over the world, and this location was the first time we were required to do that.  The rooms are very large though, so not sure why that is the case.",4,2017,07,05
150,Great hotel with great service and amenities,"Service was great, room in great condition and breakfast was superb. The hotel has a class of its own. Though there was renovation in the neighbourhood, Maura went the extra mile to give us a quiet room in the hotel.",5,2017,07,05
150,Fine hotel in a great location,"I was in London for work and we all stayed at The Churchill. Overall, it was a fine hotel - nothing amazing but no complaints. Seemed expensive compared to other hotels in the same class I've stayed in while visiting London...
Pros:
- staff was excellent and friendly. From the gentlemen at the front doors, to the fun waitresses at the bar, everyone was lovely
- bed was extremely comfortable!
- rooms were decent sized for Europe
- hotel bar had great late night bites and was a fun atmosphere 

Cons:
- got stuck in the elevator with other guests and there seemed to be no urgency to make sure we were all ok. Staff responded quickly to the emergency call button but no one came back to us with updates or timing and it took other guests to update us and get us out
- bathroom wasn't fully cleaned when I checked in and had to have someone come back to do that

Overall, I'd stay here again if I got a great rate",4,2017,07,04
150,Excellent hotel,We would definitely stay at the Churchill again. Great location and terrific staff. Always friendly and courteous. Close to Tube stations and in a quiet area. The rooms were nicely appointed. Always helpful in suggesting routes and restaurants.,5,2017,07,04
150,"Classy, understated, excellent location","Fantastic hotel in Portman Square neighborhood.  Close enough to nearby attractions but off the beaten path.  Nearby streets are quite and accessible. New Quebec street is amazing, a must eat place if you're staying at the hotel.
Staff, rooms and furnishings are top shelf.  Linens and pillows excellent.
Highly recommend.  Hyatt loyalty is worthwhile!",5,2017,07,04
150,High end hotel with excellent service,"I held a two- day meeting at the Hyatt Regency- The Churchill on June 29-30, 2017 and was extremely satisfied with the accommodations, service and meeting space. Chef Frank and our meeting m'aitre D, Eduard, were so solicitous and had a superb attention to detail.  The hotel IT support staff member was also efficient and ran the meeting equipment seamlessly. The meeting and dining spaces were well appointed and comfortable. The hotel has a lovely traditional afternoon high tea service with an chocolate high tea option which is decadent. There is are two executive lounges, one for business guests and the other for families, both of which provide a nice breakfast buffet. The hotel is located in an upscale section on Portman Square in the West End near the Marble Arch tube line and Oxford Street shopping area with Selfridges and other shops. The room I had overlooked Portman Square and was quite spacious. The food was quite good and plentiful. I would host another meeting there if the occasion arose. Our meeting attendees enjoyed the hotel accommodations and food as well. Thank you to all the hotel staff for making our meeting experience enjoyable and successful.",5,2017,07,03
150,Great stay!,"Stayed in a suite on the club floor and it was great.  Staff provided great service for our requests and breakfast in the lounge was adequate.  Great location, easy to access bus or the underground to get to the major tourist areas.  ",5,2017,06,29
150,Disappointed at Hyatt chain for lackluster service - subpar to other Hyatt locations,"Having paid $550+/nt, you would expect GREAT service from a well known hotel chain, especially one with a reputation as ritzy such as this one. It is convenient to Hyde park, the Marble Arch tube station, and shopping but otherwise offers little else. I have stayed in Hyatt hotels for many years, even one year where I visited a Hyatt property every 3 weeks for 5 days at a time where the service was consistently warm and top notch (Andaz Shanghai). This property is the least memorable/ unimpressive Hyatt property I've visited. A lot of business men in full suits (some with their families) stay here, so why does my room lack a desk? Instead, I got an uncomfortable chaise with a movable table like thing. I don't understand how their business clients work but I've never seen this setup in a hotel. Walls seem really thin as I can hear every drawer in my neighbor's room being opened...seems very strange I can pick up these small movements. Room service was slow - they seemed annoyed that I am asking them to get and pick up my items but that's what their guest services transferred me to on the second day! I'm here for 4 days and have to wait over 30 min each time.
Several times, they did not know where was my checked bag (it has a tag with my room number on it) was, even though it is a very distinctive item that was stored in the freezer. When I asked them to put items in the fridge, it was barely cold and had spoiled the liquid inside. I was just at Hyatt Union Square less than 3 weeks ago and they were super friendly and helpful about this same request - storing my items in the freezer. However, at this London location, they ruined some of my liquid items since it smelled rotten, which is how you know the fridge wasn't doing its job. Also, why can't the freezer FREEZE my liquid items - how does the ice cream stay frozen? Concierge (some, not all) was also not friendly when I asked for directions or an umbrella. I thought their job was to be pleasant and helpful. On the first day, Guest Services would help me transport my items to the fridge but we are now on day 2, and they are PUNTING me to room service, and room service is always baffled by my request (pick up item and store in freezer) and makes me wait 30 min for the item to be delivered and 30 min for the item to be picked up... I've wasted an hour so  I've got time to write this review. I'm surprised this hand off to another department is not done more smoothly by a ""5 star"" hotel and I have to wait over 30 min for someone to pick up my items at 12:30AM on a Thursday. Seems a bit ridiculous when I have to go to work early in the morning during my stay!",2,2017,06,28
150,Nice hotel in a good location,"We had a very nice stay here. Very friendly staff. Rooms are modern, clean and quiet but typical European small. It is on the expensive side but in line with other hotels in the city. Restaurant is good as well.",5,2017,06,27
150,"Churchill Hyatt Regency Hotel, London","An excellent experience in cleanliness, service & location. We came to London to visit friends, & found the location of this hotel very handy, as it was near to Selfridges & M&S & shopping in Oxford Street was great. Lovely restaurants nearby also.",5,2017,06,27
150,Very Good Location and Comfortable Stay,"The hotel has a very excellent and central location and the stay was comfortable. Walking distance from Oxford Street, Baker Street, Hyde Park and Marble Arch Station. It was a bit on the expensive side but made up for it because of the location.",4,2017,06,27
150,"Staff tops, room average, cost ridiculous","I know central London is expensive but >£300 a night for a smallish room? Really? Staff were excellent, no complaints about the service, but as an infrequent visitor I am just still in shock at the costs. ",4,2017,06,25
150,Always a delight!,"Hyatt Churchill makes you feel like you are coming home - service and quality is very good, staff are welcoming and helpful, the rooms very relaxing and well presented & the beds are wonderful for a great night sleep!. Great location!",5,2017,06,25
150,A good looking 3*,"Paid nearly £350.00 for the night and it genuinely is a glorified 3* hotel. The decor is nice but what a basic room.

The check-in was hard work. The gentleman was friendly but both my Mother and I struggled to understand what he was saying with such a heavy accent. I hate hotels in London who greet you with someone who is not British or at least, can hold a clear English conversation!

No instructions for the TV so I did not know until too late that movies were available although there is an average £12.00 fee. The TV does not go louder than 20 which you think would be sufficient but i had to sit real close. The WiFi connects but doesn't work and nowhere to play music from.

Later in the day, we tried to sit in the bar, on the terrace to which we were told there is a minimum spend of £30.00 per head now, because they have won an award for it. Even though for a 12-hour stay, I was already paying £350.00 and willing to spend more but the context in which it was relayed was not acceptable. To make matters worse, the terrace was only approximately 40% full. The bar service is not friendly or forthcoming. Considering just two of us, spent a further £150.00 just on drinks and a light bite before our theatre trip, to then return and be told the empty tables were reserved for someone coming in ten minutes.

We waited for 39 minutes and there was no one in attendance so we asked if we could sit in, having already paid another £45.00 in drinks, to which we were told another ten minutes to wait to see if they turned up.

I told them to keep the table and left.

They missed out on a large drinks tab as we would have sat there all night.

Toilets have some ridiculous cleaning apparatus attached which is pointless and I wish they had spent the money on better staff or made the room at least 4*.

A few good things, the bed was very comfortable and a genuine double bed plus the location is great. When the bar issues were raised with Reception on checkout the Receptionist was extremely apologetic and wiped the last bill off our tab which was a nice gesture. Apparently as guests of the hotel, we should never have been asked for a minimum charge.

Hard work customer service and a boring room means I would not stay here again nor would I recommend.",2,2017,06,25
150,"Quiet area, solid property","I spent a couple of nights on this hotel. I used the Heathrow Express and walked less than 15 minutes to this property (while the distance is not tiring, it’s somewhat tricky as there is not a straight line). When I got there, check in process was very efficient, staff were incredibly kind. While I booked a regular room (Queen bed, less than 300 GBP per night), thanks to the fact of being a Hyatt Globalist member and as I checked in during the weekend (less occupied hotel) I was upgraded to a suite (room 245). The suite was large and comfortable (2 bathrooms, living room, huge desk and king bed), and I was also granted access to the Regency Club (which is strangely divided in two different lounges). During my stay I used the underground for transportation (mainly Mable Arch station, 5 minute walk from the hotel). This Hyatt is located on a very nice neighborhood and has a beautiful park in the front of the building (but it is private property and cannot be accessed). 
This might be one of the best experiences I’ve ever had with this brand. I was expecting a very nice room but I was sincerely surprised and definitely would go back.",5,2017,06,23
150,Large modern hotel for families & business,"I only stayed for one night, location is great, ideal if you want to shop as it's behind Oxford Street. 

The rooms are lovely and very modern, the bed was super comfortable and I enjoyed the walk in shower. The toilet was very hi-tech, with a heated toilet seat. They have put a lot of though into the bedrooms. 

Breakfast was tasty however it was self service, I prefer to be served but it was very good for the price. 

This hotel is very large and busy, a little on the noisy side. I usually prefer to stay in smaller and quieter hotels. It's perfect for families and business. ",4,2017,06,21
150,Wonderful stay,"I stayed just one. Isn't but reception was quick and easy check in.  My room was clean, well furnished and fresh. Very good location close to selfridges and oxford street shops. Staff were helpful, especially the concierge getting my luggage and a cab for me.  Thank you.",5,2017,06,21
150,Opulent hotel centrally located,This is by far my favorite hotel experience here in London.  Hyatt Churchill centrally located and just a few blocks away from Oxford street and some of the finest restaurants in the area.  Once you walk into the lobby you are treated with charming British decors and flooring and the bar area is conveniently located just to the left of the lobby.  The hallway for the elevators leading to the rooms are nice and roomy and having an electric key definitely make entry to your room a snap.  Inside the guest rooms you are treated with nice carpeting and high thread count sheets and a very comfortable bed. The bath room has over head rain style shower with plenty of heat and water pressure.  The toilet has the latest heated and cool features along with wash mechanism.  The mini bars are nicely stocked with complimentary bottle water and fruit. I stayed on the 6th floor club room which also gives you access to the 8th floor Club Lounge.  The lounges are posh and perfect for morning breakfast and afternoon snacks.  This is great for doing a little work or just relax in comfort with a good book.  I also ordered room service during my stay for dinner and the quality of their food is definitely top notch.  I was pleased with my stay and with excellent service and accommodations I will definitely be returning to this hotel whenever I am visiting London.,5,2017,06,21
150,Lovely London Hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Just going through a remodel - so it's only going to get better (!). We will stay here again for sure. This would have been a 5-star rating - but - unfortunately, there was a guest in a nearby room who kept smoking in the middle of the night, two nights in a row, and the cigarette smoke came into our room through the vents. Not fun to wake up to in the middle of the night. Initially the staff wasn't helpful, despite it being a nonsmoking hotel. Fortunately, Patrick on the Hyatt staff was AMAZING and made things right. Without Patrick jumping in to resolve the situation, it wouldn't have been a good stay - but he saved the day. Thank you, Patrick! Re: food — Room service is incredible and very prompt. Overall, everyone was very kind and helpful.",4,2017,06,20
150,Nice property in great locatio,"This is an older property needing updating.  Very friendly staff, great location between marble arch and oxford circus.  You can walk to Covent Garden or Notting Hill (other direction).  They were kind enough to give us a room upgrade and something sweet to celebrate my birthday.  Very quiet area.  ",4,2017,06,19
150,Hotel in London stay review,Excellent facilities and staff.  Good quality and room quality was excellent and I have stayed at many of the top 5 star hotels in the world.  Only issue was the ridiculous pricing of phone calls from hotel phone (even local calls).  I mentioned this to the manager upon departure.  Apparently this is the norm for London hotels.,5,2017,06,18
150,Churchill is near yet far to everything,"The Hyatt Churchill has an excellent location. Near enough to lots of great shopping, food, and amenities, while at the same time being only a few blocks from the tube. There is an M&S and Selfridges food court if you want to stock the fridge and good pubs nearby. At the same time, the neighborhood is reasonably peaceful.",5,2017,06,18
150,Excellent hotel and service continues,"My wife and I stayed in early May.  Had a concierge level room.  The room was very nice, large and many amenities.  The lounge is excellent, with a full breakfast and excellent afternoon snacks, enough to make a full meal.  Can HIGHLY recommend this property.",5,2017,06,16
150,"Second stay, Management kept their word. Great London hotel.","I stayed here in 2013 and we had a miscommunication, that was quickly followed up with an offer to upgrade me to a club room on my next visit.  Prior to my stay, this time, I emailed Simona, who was the Assistant Manager of the Front office in 2013, and still works at the hotel.  I referenced the correspondence in which the upgrade was offered and said I would like to apply it to my upcoming stay.  She promptly applied the upgrade and was very accommodating.  This trip was with my mother, and her first trip to the UK.  The Hyatt club lounge was a lovely way to start the day.  A nice plentiful breakfast selection and evening refreshments, as well.  There are two lounges and we were always able to find a seat.  Our guest room was spacious and clean.  I like the location of this hotel.  It's quiet, convenient for travel to all points, a short walk to the Marble Arch station, near Hyde Park and plenty of restaurants close by.  A good choice for visiting London.",5,2017,06,15
150,"One of the best London Hotels for location, service, and all the amenities!","Location - Excellent access to two major parks, two undergrounds, shopping, tourism and much more! Hotel experience - Highest quality with NO surprises and excellent Regency Club experience.  Value - unforgettable way to celebrate our 20th anniversary  We will be back!",5,2017,06,14
150,Great experience!,"Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Hotel is in a great, west end location with comfortable, clean rooms with large, fluffy towels.  We used their car service for transportation from Portsmouth to London and then to Heathrow.  Driver was courteous, friendly and 
professional.  We would definitely return to this hotel!",5,2017,06,13
150,Lovely Long Weekend in London,"We enjoyed a wonderful time in London with the help of the exceptional staff at the Churchill.  The location is also superb for shopping with Selfridges, Oxford street, etc. just around the corner.  First and foremost I would like to recognize Ashley at the club lounge check-in.  He set the tone for our stay as well as set a high standard for the services to follow to match or keep up with.  He was very considerate with a very calming, relaxing demeanor while being VERY conscientious and paying attention to the slightest of details to accommodate guests needs.  The staff to follow in the lounge(s), room service (Cleaning/food) as well as management and guest services were all very exceptional.  We truly enjoyed the Arabic food selections at breakfast and midnight room service...simply delicious.    An area that needs attention/improvement is the atmosphere in the ""Family"" lounge.  It is VERY chaotic and hectic.  The staff is very pleasant and accommodating but it seems the level of staffing is not sufficient for the volume of guests during breakfast/canapes.  Food was constantly running out and the number and type of guest made the entire atmosphere VERY unpleasant.  We were asked or pushed to this lounge one evening but quickly decided to use the smaller lounge for the remainder of our stay which was excellent and did not suffer from the same issues.  A final minor point is related to the night management/guest services team.  Unlike the daytime staff who were very familiar with each guest and their profile, situation, etc.  The night staff did not seem to pay attention to these details.  I had called to confirm check out time which was originally set at 2pm but realized we needed a bit more time till 3pm.  This was already discussed with day staff and accommodating was not going to be an issue.  Furthermore with Globalist status I was entitled to 4pm checkout.  But the night staff took some time to investigate the possibility of the extension and finally once I mentioned my Globalist status the entire tone changed and everything worked out but I think they should pay attention to the guest profile to service each customer appropriately.  Just a minor training point ...and my personal opinion.    All in all, it was a fantastic stay.  Service, location and food made our trip to the Churchill very memorable.  I will definitely be making a return visit and hopefully sooner than later.",4,2017,06,13
150,Great city stay,I am a regular guest at the Hyat Churchill in London.It is an ideal  central location for the city. The hotel is height of luxury. Guest rooms are the best in London. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. Beds are very very comfortable.,5,2017,06,13
150,Excellent stay - we will be back,"We were celebrating a special occasion and all the staff made us feel welcome and went out of their way to help us. A great property superbly located is just a great bonus too. The facilities are great and the rooms bright, clean and everything feels fresh and well cared for.",5,2017,06,13
150,Hyatt Regency London,"Location is fairly good. Close to Oxford street. Breakfast very tasty especially the waffle. Dinner also very good. Didn't try Sunday brunch as free flow of champagne but we don't drink. 
24 hour gym access by hotel card. May add a CCTV camera as no staff supervised. 

",4,2017,06,11
150,Excellent in all aspects,Enjoyed the entire stay.  Concierge level is very good value. Staff is exceptionally attentive in all aspects. Location is great for busses and the tube. Would recommend the hotel to all types of travellers.,5,2017,06,10
150,The Churchill Hotel made our visit in London amazing!,"Great hotel, location is excellent, staff is professional, kind and friendly, the room is nice and comfortable, the king size bed is one of the best. My twelve years old twins boys were first time in London and the staff at the concierge were great help in planning us a program for every day during our stay. All of that and more made our visit in London unforgettable.",5,2017,06,09
150,"A great place to be stranded! Posh hotel in a quiet, chill part of London","I had no intention of visiting London but found myself stranded by British Airways during their infamous May, 2017 IT meltdown. As panicked travelers snapped up all available hotel rooms, I was lucky to score a room at the Hyatt Regency - The Churchill. I am so glad I snagged this property as it provided a comfortable, relaxing experience after a high period of stress and anxiety.  After getting the Heathrow Express to Paddington, we walked the 20 minutes to the hotel. It is in a lovely section of town, very upscale and away from the craziness of the tourist spots.  

Several other folks stranded at Heathrow were in line at check-in.  The line still moved fast and service was excellent. The IT meltdown also impacted hotels and they were being overbooked as well. Our room was available and it was recently renovated and quite nice. It was large, extremely comfortable, and had a nice bathroom.  Unfortunately, I could not get the Japanese style Toto toilet seat to work but it was minor given the circumstances. 

The staff at the hotel were so kind and empathetic regarding the BA situation. They allowed us a late checkout to sort things out and were very supportive. I'm sure they had to deal with some stressed out, upset people and they were handling it well! 

If I find myself stranded again I will certainly consider the Hyatt Regency! It may not be close to the high tourist areas, but it was nice to be out of the chaos.",5,2017,06,09
150,Hyatt Regency never disappoints,"Great hyatt, good location-right across the street from a little park and a few blocks away from shops and little cafes. We walked all the way down to Big Ben/London Bridge and other attractions...a bit of a walk but nice to be in the city and fumbled your way around :)  Very friendly and helpful staff. Wifi always worked. Great experience, and great place if you want to stay in London!",5,2017,06,08
150,Typical Hyatt Regency,"Stayed for one reward night as a Explorist member. Don't have much to say. A typical Hyatt Regency. No surprise. Received an email asking for the preference. Requested high levels, received a mid-level room, not sure if it is already counted as high. It is possible and nothing to blame. Everything is good. Better for traditional people. For my view it looks a little old but still good and clean.",4,2017,06,06
150,Exactly the experience we were hoping for,"We had been traveling in England for 4 weeks, mostly seeing family, and wanted to end on special note. We stayed in a suite which was beautifully appointed and spacious. The rooms are modern and tastefully decorated. There is a separate toilet besides the one in the bathroom - which had a shower and bath.
The location is good for shopping and the park.
A note here about the excellent and efficient job the concierge did for me booking the Locanda Locatelli, the Michelin star restaurant right in the hotel. You can only book a month ahead and as I made my room reservation months ahead of that, they handled everything for me....",5,2017,06,05
150,Churchill is the Finest!,"If you want to pamper yourself, the Churchill is the place!
Located close to the Marble Arch end of Oxford Street it is an oasis from busy London Town.
Management and Staff are friendly and accommodating whilst being highly professional.
From the moment you enter you have the feeling of being spoilt - especially by the restaurant, kitchen and bar staff.
Three Cheers to all at ""The Churchill"" who made our stay so pleasant!
Vince & Bernadette ",5,2017,06,05
150,Nice people nice place,"Visited London with the family. Hyatt is a great location and people made it terrific. They recommended restaurants nearly and printed out directions.
We all slept well and enjoyed the room and hotel. Would recommend for families or couples
",5,2017,06,04
150,Outstanding Location & Service,"First, location just short blocks off of Oxford Street & grand shopping district. Taxi stand out front, drive thru portico protects in rainy weather, doormen at your service quickly.
Next, King room was the largest we have had in any London hotel, with comfy chair, desk, closet and decent bathroom. Of course, the Toto toilet (vibrates, heats, sprays) is photo-worthy! 
Enjoyed breakfast in the Montagu restaurant on four mornings and it was excellent. Not just the variety in the cold buffet, but the island of hot dishes (offerings also cater to Middle Eastern preferences) and option for eggs, waffles, pancakes to order from the open kitchen. Also had late lunch, afternoon coffee and evening dessert and coffee in the lobby lounge. Efficient, friendly service; could not ask for more. Not an inexpensive treat, but oh, so handy. Even entry to the locked, private park, Portman Square, across the street is available for the asking from the concierge.",5,2017,06,04
150,Exceeded expectations,"Great Location, staff ++++, club level ++++Hotel is extremely clean, staff responsive and very courteous from front door valet, to concierge, to front desk. Club Level food and drinks well worth additional charge(eliminated breakfast and lunch expenses.)",5,2017,06,04
150,Great stay,"Friendly reception and given room 626, overlooking Portman Square. Small room but nicely decorated in greys and browns with a large bed, desk, table, fridge-type minibar, kettle. The bathroom was tiny with a shower, Toto WC but no bath. No UK socket on one side of bed, but plenty elsewhere in room. 
The turn down service replaced towels and tidied up, but left no chocolate! 
The Regency Lounge was in two rooms either side of the lobby on the 8th floor. The evening food offering included cheeses, breads, salads, crisps and canapés along with drinks and the breakfast included scrambled eggs, potatoes and mushrooms alongside cold items. It was all very nice and not too busy.",4,2017,06,04
150,Great stay,"Although only one night, the hotel was fabulous.  Great service, quiet location, really nice coffee and bar service, and decent breakfast in the club lounge.  Didn't get a chance to try the restaurants but will in future - we will definitely return! ",5,2017,06,03
150,Fantastic Location,"Excellent location, short walks to all major shopping areas, close to Hyde Park and plenty of good restaurants nearby. The front desk staff were very friendly and willing to help. Room was very clean and decent sized. We enjoyed afternoon tea which was not bad albeit maybe a little expensive. There is other tea spots nearby that are also very good.",5,2017,06,01
150,Best Service,The hotel staff is amazing and highly professional. Location of the hotel in center of London and easy access. Its really I felt at home during my last stays. Food and Italian restaurant at this hotel is amazing,5,2017,06,01
150,Wonderful hotel in the west end of London,The Hyatt was a great choice. We were delayed a day by a British Airways system shutdown.  The hotel (Gillian at the front desk) voluntarily agreed to call World of Hyatt to see if we could get our points back for the night we were stranded in Glasgow.  We got the points back.   All the staff are very friendly and helpful and the concierge team are great and very  knowledgeable.  There was live music two days we were there. The rooms were very well appointed and housekeeping was wonderful.  The hotel is a little bit away from the central area of London but there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance and Hyde Park is only 5 minutes away.  I can't say enough good things about this hotel.,5,2017,06,01
150,Great Stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights over the Memorial Day weekend. The hotel location is wonderful. It's a short walk to Oxford Street shopping, St.Christopher Place restaurants, Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations, and Hyde Park, and much more. We enjoyed the access to the Regency Club, which we used daily for breakfast and in the evening for coffee/water/snacks. The room was surprisingly quiet, clean, and the bathroom was small, but very nice. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,31
150,Elegant hotel in convenient quiet location,"We stayed at this hotel on the recommendation of a friend.  We were very pleased with our stay.  We upgraded to the regency floor which included breakfast and other amenities.  The location was very convenient and quiet. The rooms were spacious and modern, and the beds were very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,05,31
150,A++!,"The only single complaint my husband and I could find was the hotel ""loop"" that plays when you first turn on the TV.  If that's the worst thing we could say about a hotel, the hotel has exceeded all expectations!  I wrote ahead of time that we were celebrating our 5-year anniversary, and the hotel surprised us with a special dessert and a delightful bottle of sparkling wine the evening we first arrived. Tremendously gracious of them.  They also accommodated my request for a quiet room away from the traffic.  At check-in (which they were able to let us in our room at 11 am!) the woman said it was newly renovated - the room was quite spacious by UK standards.  The bed was comfortable, the shower water hot (although I'm personally not a fan of the overhead rain showerhead - but that's just me).  I love that they had USB ports in the outlets. It's the little things.  The concierge William was a huge help to us in the days leading up to our stay and everyone we interacted with was so friendly and inviting and hospitable.  I wish we could have stayed another week!  Thank you so much for making this one of the best weeks of our lives!",5,2017,05,31
150,Excellent family stay,"I stayed at this hotel during my last trip with my wife and baby. Everything was ok, they took care of every detail for my baby and the room was very nice. The location was excellent near oxford street and walking distance of the marble arch. ",5,2017,05,30
150,Peace in London,First class experience from check in to check out.  Bed and room very comfortable with smaller bathroom with a shower - no bath.  Cocktails excellent as were the wines.  Opening window a huge benefit as the fresh air was not nearly so dry as the AC.  One of our favourite hotels in London and best situation.,5,2017,05,29
150,Consistant over many years,"The Churchill has delivered consistently excellent service over many, many years which is a major positive. So many hotel properties chop and change name or style. The Churchill does not. It is not old in any way. Maybe the pricing (room and restaurants) are creeping up to stratospheric levels.",5,2017,05,29
150,Hyatt Regency,"Great service - check in staff especially deserves a shoutout. 

I usually stay in the Hyatt as I love it's convenient location and the dependable service. Really pleased to see that they've upgraded most of the rooms.",4,2017,05,29
150,BA flights cancelled ,"All, lifelong career in hospitality and these guys blow my mind. 

BA flights to Dubai cancelled - Heathrow hotels rate up, Central London the same. With the exception of Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill. A fair rate for a premium nights stay. 

More so when asked at check in how my day has been I explained. The wonderful receptionist said well we need to look after you and upgraded us to a Regency Club Suite.

So, my advice - if you are in London, if you want to be made to feel special, enjoy amazing hospitality, fine wine, cocktails, great food and most importantly a team of hospitality professionals that really care; Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill is the only choice.

Hat off to this place",5,2017,05,28
150,visit at the bar,"i the hotel accompanied a friend and it was amazing, great bar and drinks. the hotel is beautiful and location is close to shops and heart of the city. hotel is beautiful and rooms very nice and hotel is chic",4,2017,05,28
150,Deluxe Hotel in Great location,Enjoyed all aspects of The Churchill. The staff was wonderful from check-in to the service on the concierge floor. Lobby /restaurant is stunning.  Room was excellent with a view of the park.  Super location with only a short walk to parks and/or oxford street shopping.  Highly recommend!!,5,2017,05,27
150,Amazing,"Excellent experience with hayat regency and every thing was perfect from entrance door till deep sleeping.
Warm feelings a mazing staff high quality food and drinks and a very clesn and quite rooms. It was really awesome experience.",5,2017,05,26
150,Nice Classic Hotel in the heart of London,"Good customer service, nice room & comfort bed in central upscale location. Breakfast is not included but if u want u can pay for extra. Overall, we have a good time there but we don't feel like we get what you pay for. ",4,2017,05,26
150,We'll be back,"Amazing location in the west end with easy access to the tube and walking distance to many attractions. Quiet, no issues with noise and the bed was very comfortable.  

We would happily stay there again. ",4,2017,05,26
150,Business meetings at The Churchill,"Hotel facilitated business meetings on Thursday and Friday.  Meeting rooms were full but not over crowded, food and beverages at break were excellent.  Hotel bar was upbeat and breakfast were excellent.  It's not cheap by Canadian standards, but services it excellent.",5,2017,05,25
150,"Pricey.  Central location, new and upgraded property","At this price point, there are lots of other more charming options.......you are really paying for the Hyatt brand, I think.  Hotel has been nicely redone.  Good Club Level lounge with separate check in for elite level members.  Room comfortable, if a bit small for this price range.   Location is OK....easily accessible, though a bit lacking in charm.",4,2017,05,25
150,One bad apple shouldn't spoil a whole visit.,"The Hyatt Regency London boasts an excellent location very close to the Marble Arch tube station and just a few blocks from London's best shopping district.  Our room was large by London standards, with an excellent bathroom and good clothing storage.  It was very quiet and we slept soundly.  The hotel staff was friendly, efficient, and quite professional, with one glaring exception in the Montagu restaurant.  Otherwise, I would have given this property five stars instead of four.  The hotel apologized for that individual and issued a credit, so I am satisfied.",4,2017,05,24
150,Loved our stay - perfect,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay whilst visiting London. The staff were great and our room was lovely. Breakfast was great with plenty of choices, continental as well as full English. We were well looked after and would definitely return. Highly recommended. Thanks to all the team",5,2017,05,24
150,Great stay,"The Churchill is well located 2 blocks off Oxford Street near Marble Arch. It was refurbished just over 2 years ago and is now more modern and stylish than in the past. The rooms are reasonably large and well appointed with one of the most comfortable beds you will find in a hotel. The health club has been redone and is now very good, albeit still quite small. The treadmills etc now have proper connectivity so you can watch TV, you tube or browse the internet and more while exercising - a great improvement. They have also redone the wifi service and it is now the best I have encountered in a London hotel - a critical service to attract a business clientele. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I had a great stay and will be back",5,2017,05,23
150,Exceptional Tranquility Bordering Oxford Street,There was not a sound to be heard in my suite yet the hotel is a minute from one of London's major thoroughfares Oxford St & adjacent to Hyde Park for a morning stroll along the Serpentine. Food & drink of excellent quality & staff very friendly & helpful.,5,2017,05,21
150,Great stay Hyatt regency ,"Special thanks to ladies at Hyatt club for free upgrade and wonderful cheerful service they are great ambassadors for Hyatt

Club room view square is best Club has very nice breakfast and drunk canapés in evening ",5,2017,05,19
150,Excellent hotel with great amenities and attentive staff,"Stayed here for 7 nights in May 2017.  Service was great and staff responded quickly to a couple requests that I made.  Rooms are updated and super clean.  One of the managers took the time to ask me if I had any special requests and offered suggestions for my holiday itinerary.  Hotel restaurants were pricey, but that's standard for all hotels, food quality was great.  Location was convenient to Bond & Marble Arch underground stations.  No hassle check-in and check-out.",5,2017,05,18
150,A bit pricey but well worth it!,"I've been staying in a small town in UK for a couple weeks and wanted to go to London for the weekend.  I was hoping for a stress free environment and a bit of luxury. That is exactly what I got. The staff was great, and my room was lovely.",5,2017,05,17
150,Vacation time ,"Hyatt Regency Churchill, in my opinion, is one of the best hotels in London. This was my 7th or 8th stay in the hotel. The best thing about the hotel is its location, right next to Marble Arch and Oxford street. The rooms has an excellent service and rooms are very clean. It is a great hotel for the families. The executive lounge staff is very courteous and hospitable. Looking forward to our next stay. ",5,2017,05,17
150,pleasant stay,"a very nice hotel in a good location, the renovated rooms are very nice, bathrooms are small but it was fine with me, bathroom size might be a bit of an inconvenience for a larger person. I stayed at the kind view room looking at the portman square, it was noisy during the day but I used ear plugs during the night so it was fine i didn't hear anything when I went to sleep.",5,2017,05,15
150,Excellent stay - top hotel!,"Really enjoyed our 3 night stay here. The location is excellent. Our room was a good size and very quiet.
The bathroom was a decent size too.
Service from beginning to end was exemplary.
I would definitely return any time I'm in London",5,2017,05,14
150,"Great location, but the washroom needs an upgrade","Great location.
Room is size is good.
Washroom needs an upgrade as they still have old school tubs with broken/leaking Taps that needs to be repaired. Water spills out to the washroom while taking shower.
Sink has to be manually unblocked as water doesn't go the drain on its own.",3,2017,05,12
150,Almost Luxury,"First time at this hotel and I was really impressed. The service is impeccable, the property is very well kept and the location is excellent for shopping. The standard room however was quite small. The bathroom was even smaller. I would suggest to upgrade if possible. The breakfast was very good with a wide selection of international dishes. Even the lounge area was very pleasant and their menu was quite extensive.",4,2017,05,12
150,Great service ,"We stayed in a king executive room. I would recommend staying at the newly renovated rooms with lounge access. The meals provided were top notch. Only downside was the bathroom was very narrow.

This Hyatt has great status recognition. The manager and the whole service team provided us with exceptional service throughout our stay. 

Looking forward to coming back.

",5,2017,05,11
150,Churchill would be proud,"We love  the Churchill we having been staying here for well over a decade. It is one of our favorite hotels. We do feel the Regency Club food quality has gone down a bit and their wine selection not as good as other countries, but the service is great.",4,2017,05,10
150,An old favorite has become a World Best ,"I have been staying at this hotel for many years. Finally they have refurbished the rooms and new life has been breathed into this wonderful traditional hotel 

It has old world charm mixed with new world chic. The rooms are really well designed and totally chic. 

The service is world class throughout the hotel. Concierge are the best. 

The lobby restaurant is absolutely excellent!!! Oysters are a MUST!!

The only thing I really really didn't like was the bar The Churchill. Service sucked and cocktails below average.

But plenty of other places to drink. 

I love this hotel. Forget the price this is worth it. Seriously.  No one will complain this hotel is one of life's experiences that must be done. Put it on your bucket list ",5,2017,05,09
150,Thankful,The stuff is so professional. They helped me to find a proper hospital due to an emergency case happened to my son. Also they send us a very beautiful card and candy. Thank you The Chutchill Team. We enjoyed staying at your hotel and you are amazing!,5,2017,05,08
150,Fine Stay,"I have stayed at this hotel more than 50 times.  Recognition as a top tier member is always hit or miss.  Sometimes I received outstanding treatment, room upgrades and other times I receive small rooms, no upgrade, sometimes rooms are not clean to 5 star standards, other times they are spotless.  The hotel tries, but I do think some managers try more than others.  Finally, the hotel seems very challenged with early arrivals and I generally need to pay for the night before to get a room before 3 pm - that is a reflection of poor planing and slow housekeeping.  Many times, no turn down is provided and the rooms need more attention.  Regency staff are very pleasant and overall, for the price, it is a fine hotel and gets the job done.  That said, as a non-top tier guest at other hotels in London where i have stayed recently, I have received either the same treatment and in many instances much better treatment than I have at the Churchill.",4,2017,05,08
150,"Great Hotel, Great Service","Stayed three nights and was very pleased with the hotel and the service in the Regency Club.   Room was an upgrade and large, by London Standards.   Service in the Regency Club was excellent, which was used for happy hour and breakfast.  Location at Portman Square is ideal for Oxford Street, Hyde Park",5,2017,05,07
150,Bat Mitzvah celebrations.,We held our daughter's Bat Mitzvah at the hotel and it was perfect from start to finish.  They have a wonderful team at the Churchill and I would highly recommend anyone thinking of having a function to book up quickly.  They were incredible. A huge thank you to everyone for making it the best weekend of our lives. The Goldstone Family x,5,2017,05,05
150,Great location,"Centrally located easy walk  or short ride to the main location in London.
Friendly and very helpful staff.
Had to call when room was cleaned by three PM, after call they where up in five minutes.
Upgraded to a high floor with park view.  Wonderful.

150,Excellent Family stay,"The location of the hotel is very good, near Oxford street for shopping. All staffs were very friendly. The standard room is large and available for 3.

150,End of our HONEYMOON trip,"What can I say... the staff and all personal were amazing.  
The location is fantastic and a quick taxi ride and you're there - if you prefer the walking is only a few minutes to fantastic restaurants and Selfridges shopping mall! 
We were blessed with no rain our 4 days and could not have been more delighted or satisfied in anyway with this Hotel! Bravo!   We'll see you again!!!👍🏼👍🏼 ",5,2017,05,03
150,Central location and amazing breakfast variety,"Asked for a quiet room and staff were accommodating. Rooms are fine. Bathrooms were renovated. Breakfast has amazing variety. Within walking distance to Oxford street, marble arch and Hyde Park. Driver picking me up from and back to the airport was very friendly in a fine Jaguar limo!",5,2017,05,03
150,An Oasis in the Heart of London,Find the perfect haven in the heart of the bustle of London at the Hyatt Churchill.  Close proximity to all London has to offer while staying in first class accommodations.  The staff will help make your stay extra special.  FIVE STARS!!!,5,2017,05,02
150,Not the greatest,"This was not a great stay.  It took the bellman about 5 hours to bring our bags upon check-in.  We had to call twice.  From what I could gather, they temporarily ""lost"" them.  Our hotel room was extremely small and overlooked mechanicals for the building.  When we left at 5:00 a.m., the elevator got stuck on our floor and couldn't open.  We couldn't get another to come because it must have been getting a signal that the elevator was on our floor.  We called maintenance, but this took time to sort out and made us late in getting to the airport.  Hyatts are usually better than this.",2,2017,05,01
150,Wonderful hotel,"This was our second visit to the Churchill.  We were again very pleased with everything about the visit.  We had a large room on the ninth floor with access to the Regency Club, which was a significant plus.  Great service throughout our stay.",5,2017,05,01
150,Customer service review,"The staff is exceptionally good. The guest rooms need through cleaning for excellence. The food preparation to be perfected for excellence all the time. The hotel is well located and guests can easily access shops, restaurants, and Embassy offices. There are Parks around which is good for leisure and entertainment. The hotel has plenty of space for meetings. The hotel staff was very good and could arrange for exceptional meetings that were not initially booked for.",4,2017,04,30
150,Great hotel in a good location,"Great hotel with very competent staff.  From arrival to departure everything was taken care of.  The room was spacious and well equipped, the bathroom was ""interesting"" (first time we'd had a heated toilet seat and a shower that appeared to vacuum the water into a drain).  Breakfast was nicely set up and service was excellent.

it isn't in the West End, but if you want to shop on Oxford Street Selfridges is one block away.

Overall, highly recommended.",4,2017,04,30
150,Recommended ,"Central location yet on a relatively quiet street away from the bustle of Oxford Road. We got a lovely view of Portman Square park. The thoughtful front desk staff allowed an early check in for us as we travelled from afar and arrived at 6am, so totally pleased we didn't have to wait for the standard afternoon check in 👍🏼👍🏼. Thank you!

Stayed for 5 nights. Overall a pleasant experience. ",5,2017,04,30
150,Very good,Very good hotel. Enjoyed the location most. View of the street was wonderful to wake up and see everyone going to work. The opening and closing of doors was s little annoying as was the unpredictability of the hot water but still and wonderful experience.,5,2017,04,28
150,A true hotel in the shopping area,"It has an excellent location for all purposes visit to london, luxurious with simplicity, clean rooms, excellent and co-operative room keepers, helpful and professional staff in reception, room service, AC technician, restaurant, concierge.

150,April 2017,My wife and I were in London for the London Marathon and we highly recommend this hotel for your stay.  It's near a stop on the London Underground so it's easy to navigate the city.  The facility is very nice and the service was impeccable.  Concierge can help you with everything.,5,2017,04,26

150,Wonderful,Wonderful time with all your stuff and we need to sher this world wide for the people who are looking for a good blessed stay this  hotel is the Wright hotel for the Wright prices  we did the Wright choice ,5,2017,04,24
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill,By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Stayed in lots of 5* hotels but nothing of this class before. Can not recommend highly enough. Next time I'm in London there is only one hotel I will be staying in. Wife's birthday and upon arrival in my room my wife had a bottle of Wine waiting and a cake. ,5,2017,04,24
150,Good hotel in great location,"Nice hotel in Marylebone close to 2 tube stations which gets you anywhere in London. Club level access well worth it for breakfast and snacks at night. Staff was very friendly and competent. Monrague restaurant was just OK especially for the price. Knocked the Churchill down a star because I paid for a Club level room but did not get it - only access to the Club with a room on a lower floor. Worse, as a loyal Hyatt member, I was given a room overlooking an active construction site. ",4,2017,04,24
150,Short stay,"We stayed at the Churchill for a weekend wedding we were attending in London. The reception arranged an early check in to our room so we could
Shower and change beforehand. They were so helpful and courteous at all times and the hotel was modern and tastefully decorated. Breakfast was excellent. ",5,2017,04,24
150,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff.  The club lounge is very good, great selections and accommodating staff.The guest rooms are a bit smaller than hoped for.  The closeness to Hyde Park was a plus. Overall we had a wonderful stay and look forward to returning.",5,2017,04,23
150,Very convenient location.  Excellent staff service,Hotel needs updating.  Overall experience was very good.  Courteous helpful staffs.  The beddings are not plush but comfortable.  Beds are bit too firm.  Club level experience was very good.  Nicely stocked.,4,2017,04,22
150,Business traveler,"Overall, meeting space, rooms, restaurants and servicewas excellent, guest services, check in/out, fantastic. 
Overall a great experience. Excellent location and easily accessible from Heathrow and local tube stops. ",5,2017,04,22
150,"Excellent location, very clean top rated","The hotel is located just off the off Oxford St. which is great if you in London for some shopping.
We stayed in a room facing the street which had some works done on it during our stay, thanks to the double glazing it was quiet.
Hotel rooms are nicely decorated some of them face the park, slightly more pricey but probably worth it.",4,2017,04,21
150,A place to stay and enjoy your trip,"An excellent location for business or leisure trip.. Excellent food, Excellent Service, Very friendly staff.. Near shopping centers, 2 minutes walk from Hyde Park. Taxi available 24 hours on the door steps.",4,2017,04,20
150,Saturday Italian Brunch,"Lovely setting and relaxed atmosphere.  The kitchen area is completely open so you can see the chefs working their magic.  Good choice of antipasti and starters.  Less choices of mains but the way to go is to have pasta or risotto cooked to order.  I had spaghetti with smoked salmon in a cream & white wine sauce - simple but so tasty.  Good selection of mini deserts and crepes / waffles made to order too.  Best bit other than the pasta - the unlimited bubbles!!!  Service was quietly efficient and although we weren't rushed, at 3pm the bubbles stopped and Afternoon Tea was being set up.  If it had been busier, I wonder whether we would have been moved off our table?  I would definitely recommend!  ",5,2017,04,15
150,Our first trip to London,"An outstanding hotel with courteous staff, healthy breakfast, clean surroundings, gorgeous interior, personal park for kids with tennis courts and centrally located with easy access to all shops and restaurants. Highly recommend it",5,2017,04,15
150,"Not great value, location a bit off, great breakfast","We spent one night at this hotel.  Using points to qualify for a free night on the club floor, this cost us 33,000 Hyatt, a very large number compared with properties in the US.  We were told our platinum (now discoverist) status did not qualify us for the club upgrade, so we paid an extra 8,000 points to make the total 33,000 to qualify for the club floor.  The room was very small and there was not room to lay out our three suitcases. We felt cramped.  Rather than spacious, the bathroom was very cramped and not great in terms of how it looked; patched grout around the sink and such.  

They did give us nice toiletries (Molton Brown) and the breakfast was very, very nice.  Lovely fruit, at least 3 hot selections, wonderful pastries and breads, smoked salmon, turkey, excellent staff and atmosphere.  Very quiet even in the family lounge.  Breakfast was probably the best aspect of our stay and we got to enjoy it twice.  Also, we did get special treats in our room:  a map for kids that my daughter really enjoyed, a London travel book, wine, and 3 special desserts.  So that was very very nice. No goodnight chocolates on the pillow though.  

We also got to check in on the club floor if we wanted and our own concierge.  But we found her very lacking: she had never heard of the Cortauld Gallery (!) , when she looked it up did not give me the closest subway (Temple would have been the best one, not Charing Cross or Embankment).  When we asked how to get to Buckingham Palace she told us the correct metro stop but neglected (didn't know or didn't bother) to tell us that there are no tours there until summer.  We thus wasted an entire morning/early afternoon of our last day in London.   

I was also surprised at how the doormen outside behave.  The ones we used for bags and to get a taxi to the train station were great.  But as a pedestrian coming up to the hotel, the doorman waiting in front of the hotel did not bother to open the door for me the first time I went in.  He just stood there and I was left to open the door for myself.  The second time I was carrying a heavy carrier bag, was tired and was hoping the door would be opened for me.  But this time the doorman opened the door himself, walked in, and let the door swing shut behind him, right in my face!  Is this the impression we are supposed to get walking into the hotel?  

Coming from a previous hotel near Piccadilly Circus, I was not wild about this location.  It's a bit of a walk to the tube and not really in the thick of things such as the theatre district and shopping.  

It was a nice hotel in some ways but costly in terms of points and short on space.  They can give you lots of treats but space itself to use the bathroom and open up your suitcase is an important commodity when you travel.  I found the Meridien Piccadilly to be a much better value for us in terms of points used, space, and location.",3,2017,04,14
150,Keep coming back.,"Three visits in 6 years to London for my wife and I and after two terrific experiences at the Regency Churchill there was no doubt where we would stay there on our third trip.  It's the service,friendly and helpful staff that keeps us coming back.  Great area, close to fabulous shopping, eateries and tube so staying at this hotel is convenient for us.  The quality of the food was very good even in the bar which I might add is tastefully decorated.  Very nice ambiance in the bar since the renovations. We stayed on the club floor and in each of our stays, we had a clean, comfortable and spacious room.  In our visits, we have gotten to know some of the staff and we enjoy conversing with them.  It's like meeting new friends.  I find that if you treat the staff well, you will get some extra special attention.  Very friendly and attentive staff in the club lounge.  One of the staff made a point to get the chef to make a simple but tasty hors d'oeuvre for my wife who is lactose intolerant.  Kudos to her and the chef for being so accommodating.  We also got to visit with the new General Manager who had just started his new position.  It was nice speaking with him.  Finally, special thanks to Nicholas who picked us up from the airport.  He is so pleasant to talk to and considerate.  He looked after us well and special thanks once again to Adela.  It's staff like her that makes you want to come back time and time again.  Staff come and go, but my advice to Management of the hotel, when you find people like Adela and Nicholas who are excellent at customer service, you make sure you do your best to retain such workers.  Once again, thanks for everything and on a job well done.",5,2017,04,14
150,My favorite hotel in London,"I have stayed at this hotel more times than I can count and it is always a pleasure. The staff are friendly and efficient, the beds are comfortable and the location for central London is excellent close to buses, the Tube and Oxford Street. It has everything a business traveler would need.",5,2017,04,13
150,As good as the previous visit,"Having stayed at the hotel two years ago, there was no question but to come back and we were not disappointed. Despite arriving early in the morning we were able to check into the room at no extra charge. A third bed we had ordered was brought to the room mid way through the day whilst we were out shopping. Extra towels ordered on occasion from housekeeping were delighted within minutes. Breakfast always good and staff agreeable Rio limit charges for breakfast when only a child buffet wanted. Reception and concierge were always efficient. ",5,2017,04,12
150,Royal Treatment,"Lovely, helpful staff, great Central London location, and fabulous food.  We booked an extra night here prior to the start of a tour. Tired from our flight, but buzzing with excitement to see the city, we ditched our bags and hit the streets of Central London. With just a few basic helpful hints from the staff, we explored Hyde Park, Harrod's, Selfridge's, several pubs, and basked in the energy of the diversely crowded streets. A great location to explore the city.",5,2017,04,11
150,Wonderful hotel in every way.,"Fantastic location on a side street one block from Marble Arch or Bond Street stations on the Central Line.  The staff is absolutely wonderful.  The Regency Club floor has two lounges, one for families or groups, and the other for business travelers and those who desire a quiet place to eat or read.  Both are beautifully appointed.   We will return to this Hyatt as soon as possible!",5,2017,04,11
150,below expectations,"I was checked into a room with no closet space (this room should be removed from sale). When I requested (by phone) to change to another room, the receptionist seemed reluctant and appeared not to believe my claim that there was no closet to speak of. There was no hot water in the hotel for over 36 hours!! Staff did not to know when the problem would be solved.",2,2017,04,11
150,a very special local get-away,The staff went out of there way to make it a very special stay. We needed a short get-away and they made it particularly special with a big surprise when we got there. We chose this hotel in part because we wanted to try a restaurant located in it and the restaurant graciously let us share each course so we could enjoy more of their food.,5,2017,04,11
150,Best location in central London,"A well maintained property with elit location close by Marble Arch and shopping streets. 

The staff amazing very helpful  and always smiling. 

This is a place you call it home when you away from your own.",5,2017,04,11
150,Loved the hotel!,"Great hotel all around,  perfect location  Just need to get the Churchill Bar staff a little more responsive.  They were slow each time we were in there and were not keeping the tables clean.  The restaurant was great.",5,2017,04,10
150,Excellent location,"I've been couple of times in this hotel for business matters and I had good time to explore the surrounding areas
The hotel location is excellent, near and walking distance to the Hyde park, Oxford street and Edgware road and close to a metro station
The room is very good but the price is too high may be due to the location.
The lounge is very good with good food.
The restaurant in the lobby not that good.
The service of the receptionists is terrible they are very slow and limited number",4,2017,04,09
150,A great spot to rejuvenate before heading out to vacation,"A bad experience with a flat rental turned into an excellent 4 night stay at the The Churchill.   I ended up with two adjoining rooms on the club level for my wife, daughter, and my mother.  The hotel is very nice and the service level is quite high and the mini-chocolate cones that appeared on the first night as part of the turn down service was a very nice touch.  This was my first time in a Regency and I will certainly be staying in this line of the Hyatt brand again.  

Having access to the club lounge was surprisingly useful and while we did not spend much time there having access to the waters/coffees and the the snacks really made a different.    

The decor of the hotel is modern and up to date.   We visited the Churchill bar one evening and the furs available on the outside porch to stay warm were very helpful. 

The Marble Arch Underground stop is only a few blocks away making access to the buzz of London very easy.   It's central line location is an excellent place to be. 

There are many, many hotels in London.   I'll certainly try to book the Hyatt Regency London- The Churchill the next time I am there.",5,2017,04,09
150,Very quiet and great time in London,"I can't say enough nice things about this hotel.  It was busy with families and business travelers alike. My husband and I were traveling alone for a quick trip away.  The hotel is conveniently located to tube, sights, shopping, great restaurants, etc.  We were upgraded to the Business level and that was fantastic.  The room was nicely appointed with large bathroom and nicely sized room with chair and desk to work at.  I loved the mirrored doors on the closets across from the bathroom, this made getting dressed easy.  Nice appointments in the bathroom with Molton Brown products.  My daughter will love all the extras that I brought home for her.  My only complaint about the bathroom is there was not an outlet to plug hair dryer and any other appliances into.  Had to use desk area.  The business level amenities were fantastic with breakfast included.  Nice varieties of food and beverages were provided throughout the day.  We spent a couple of nights at the Churchhill bar and this was also great.  The staff was great and it was always busy with people coming and going.  Great, great hotel.  Can't wait to come back to London.",5,2017,04,08
150,Enjoy very much as always with Hyatt Regency,"I do enjoy very much in staying with Hyatt Regency included this Autumn in Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill.   A very convenience location for shopping, sign seeing as well as all kinds of entertainment within London or a morning walk in the Hyde Park.  The good facilities and environment of the hotel and the room let me feeling a real leisure time for vacation.",4,2017,04,08
150,Comfortable & well located!,"Stayed here for 3 nights in March and had a great stay. The location and service was fantastic, decor of the rooms could be nicer for a 5 star but then again we didn't spend much time in the room. Somewhat pricey so book only at a good rate.",4,2017,04,07
150,Week trip to London,"What an amazing hotel, I've stayed at many luxury hotels in the past and I've gotta say, this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. The customer service is best of the best, from Ashley at the front desk, Dawit the bellman, Vitor, Mario and Mr. Lango from the restaurant. The restaurant, Churchill bar, and the regency club is amazing as well! Phenomenal location - just a few minutes walking to Oxford street, Hyde park, and tube access. I would definitely recommend to anyone planning a trip to London!",5,2017,04,07
150,Amazing luxury hotel in London,"The hotel is very clean, staff are extremely friendly and attentive to details. You will truly feel pampered from the minute you check. The rooms are very clean with all the facilities In. Breakfast is really good.",5,2017,04,06
150,Spring Break in London,We stayed at the Hyatt Churchill for six nights and it was fabulous.  Every single staff member treated us so kindly.  Our room was very well appointed and the bed was extremely comfy and there were even heated toilet seats! The breakfasts were just delicious. The location was close to Tube.  We will be back.,5,2017,04,04
150,Great location and Service ,"The hotel is near shopping areas, parks, underground station and the Wallace Collection. Staffs are all friendly and the room was clean.
Bedding was great too.
Room service food was also pretty good! 
Definitely worth the money!",5,2017,04,04
150,Wedding Anniversary stay at hyatt,"My stay was excellent staff is amazing, smooth checkin, very comfortable I would highly recommend staying at hyatt regency London.  The best hotel and excellent location. Very caring staff specially Mr Waris at the checkin. I would definitely be back very soon",5,2017,04,04
150,Lovely property,"This was my first time at The Churchill; I usually stay at the Intercontinental Park Lane. From the moment I walked in until check out 3 days later, my stay was perfect. I had a room on the club floor, which has two clubs, one for families and one just for adults, no children. This was a nice touch and made greeting the day at breakfast and unwinding a bit at the end of end very pleasant. The concierge up there will help arrange activities, bookings etc. The room itself was quiet, spacious and wifi was strong. Downstairs at the Montagu service was spot on. I had a burger one day that was cooked nicely. There is set up for cheese tastings and nice selection and teas, cocktails and wine. Afternoon tea looked quite nice although I didn't experience. The location is perfect, close to the tube (Marble Arch) walking distance to Marylebone and about a 20 minute walk to New Bond St, Fortnum and Mason and a plethora of nice shops. While it is a busy city hotel, once you enter it is quiet. The staff were all very helpful and could not have been more professional and warm. ",5,2017,04,04
150,Sons wedding,"Absolutely fabulous, clean and beautiful hotel, extremely friendly staff, excellent location, definitely recommend , stayed here for one night with family when attending sons wedding at home house, across the road",5,2017,04,03
150,great experience.....we will return,"We spent two nights at the Churchill over the weekend, to celebrate my wife's birthday and take our son to a West End show.    We have stayed in many Hyatt hotels in different countries and are used to good service, but this was truly great service.   I had told the hotel we were there for my wife's birthday and they went out of their way to make us feel special.    All the staff we came in contact with had the personal but professional touch.   We look forward to our next stay.",5,2017,04,03
150,"Location, location, location","We stayed for five nights. What you want in London is a great location, and boy does this place have it. Two tube stations are within a five minute or so walk. Oxford Street is probably two minutes away.  Dining options are plentiful. We ate at Selfridges food hall which is amazing. Also, Marks and Spencer is close with a good food hall as well. The rooms are contemporary with excellent bedding and linens. The breakfast buffet is absolutely phenomenal. Front desk staff was helpful in every way. Go ahead and book it! You'll be pleased!",5,2017,04,02
150,Great hotel,"Nice clean and friendly staff and very close to Oxford st. And shopping stores, and very close to marbel arch station. And justca milestones walk u can reach to oxford circus which contains more shopping stores",5,2017,03,31
150,the best service,"it was the best place and the service was good and am sure i will be many more times in hyatt hotel, thanks for the service and kindness, and the location was good for me because it was central london",5,2017,03,28
150,Excellent location. Excellent service.,"This fabulous hotel is tucked away on a quiet square, but is only two blocks from bustling Oxford Street, midway between Marble Arch & Bond Street. 

Check in was not until 2pm, but we knew that the hotel offered drop off service for baggage. Upon arrival (9am), they offered us immediate check in for a NON-renovated room, or we could wait for a modernized room. We opted to wait, so they provided us a room to shower & freshen up in. This is a service that I've never been offered in my 30+ years of international travel.

We were able to meet friends and enjoy the day because we were refreshed & ready to go. Upon returning to the hotel later that day, our bags were in our room, and the roll away bed for my child was prepared. There was no need to remind the staff, or ask them to set it up. Further, this little roll away was not a springy camp cot, but a very comfortable single bed. The room was larger that expected, was extremely clean, bright, modern and comfortable.

The hotel lobby & lounge were very comfortable for meeting friends, the staff was incredibly welcoming & engaging, and the location was exceptional. I have lived in London & traveled there many times & this hotel exceeded my expectations.",5,2017,03,28
150,Awesome hotel property!,"This hotel was part of a package deaI through Costco travel so I did not know what to expect. We are doing a family vacation with four nights in London and four nights in Paris. We arrived at the hotel jetlagged at approximately 10 AM. One of our three rooms was already ready which was wonderful. By noon all three rooms are ready. This cannot be a underappreciated after a long night of flying. Check in and the bell service were fast and efficient.
The concierge arranged theater tickets for us as well as offered to set up some tours. They were very helpful. The doormen were always  very friendly and very helpful with taxis. The rooms were lovely. They were very large for a European hotel. The beds were extremely comfortable. We were facing  Portman Square. There is a very beautiful park in the middle of it. There was lots of traffic, but our rooms were very quiet. The air conditioning was excellent. The showers were very nice and they had rain shower heads. The maid service was very efficient and the rooms were very clean.
All the employees we came in contact were very professional and friendly.
The breakfast was extensive and delicious. It was somewhat of a blend of a British breakfast and an American breakfast. All of the staff in the restaurant were also extremely friendly and helpful.
The hotel is about three blocks from Marble Arch. There was lots of shopping nearby. The Churchill bar in the hotel is reviewed separately and was also top notch.
Thanks for an outstanding stay this truly is a five-star hotel!
",5,2017,03,28
150,Upholding the Hyatt standard....,"It’s my first stay at the Hyatt Regency London Churchill hotel (4N), situated amongst a quiet residential neighbourhood (I think). There’s a pretty private small garden directly opposite it. The building looks dated, in a nice way. Once u enter, the check in reception is on the right, while the resident café/restaurant is on the left. The decor is pretty much rather standard of most Hyatt hotels.

We arrived early morning round 6am+, & we can’t check in yet till 3pm. However, the hotel offered us a room to shower upon request, which helped a lot. We left our luggage with concierge before heading out. 

The hotel itself is a Pokestop, if that helps. From entrance, turn right & walk straight, u’re on Oxford St in less than 5 mins. Same spot facing Oxford St turn right, the tube station Marble Arch is around 3 mins walk. From here, u can keep walking the entire Oxford St, which is connected to Regent St, also Soho & Piccadilly. It’s easy straight walk, decide where u want to head to.

The room is just right size for 1-2 pax. Unfortunately my room doesn’t come with good view (see photo). There were times where I worried that someone could be standing outside the window peeking in. The toilet comes with a built in bath tub, u’ll have to be in it for showers (not a personal preference). It provides the basic toiletries, u’ll have to call housekeeping for the dental kit (free). The safety box, hair dryer & iron + board are available in the room.

If u’re a light sleeper like me, do request NOT to have a room on the 2nd floor. #204 (my room), 203, 233 etc were near/next to the hotel gym – this building doesn’t have sound proof walls (like most European buildings), one can hear those sport enthusiasts running on treadmills early morning! I was awoken before my alarm sets off. 

I did my laundry & it came nicely packed in a big box, like a present. The room service was great with a friendly staff (same for 2 days in a row) who was a tad worried I was eating too little for breakfast. Hyatt is an eco-friendly hotel, so they don’t change bedsheets daily which was fine by me.

When I checked out, there was a misunderstaning over my membership & the staff offered to help to check immediately. It took a while but she was patient & helped verified the status. 

Overall, my experience was good, like with most Hyatt hotels, the good service level was upheld & maintained by great staff.",4,2017,03,28
150,Excellent,Very nice stay. We stay on the 9th floor. Everything was excellent. Wonderful stay. Location was great. Very clean hotel. Staff is very helpful. Bed was very comfortable. Very close to Oxford street.  Breakfast is also good. ,5,2017,03,27
150,The perfect place to rest in London !,The staff and service was superb! The Churchill's excellent and quiet location is also next to Oxford street makes it very accessible by bus or tube to the heart of London shopping and her various attractions. Will come back again !  ,5,2017,03,27
150,Great stay,"Wonderful staff
Great room
Terrific indoor outdoor bar! 
Location was perfect for eating drinking and getting to Canary Wharf for business. 
Close to wonderful restaurants, pubs and shopping makes this an ideal location.",5,2017,03,26
150,Exceeding expectations,"The Hyatt Regency Churchill is not mentioned in most London guidebooks among the city's best hotels, but it should be. The rooms were large for a central city hotel, well appointed and comfortable. The location is central to London attractions, and is close to the London Underground (Marble Arch). The hotel restaurant has a nice breakfast which is reasonably priced. The star attraction was the hotel staff - from check in to check out everyone we encountered was friendly and very helpful. The concierge helped us out in a tough situation and literally made the difference between a great trip and a poor one. A terrific experience; we hope to have a chance to visit again.",5,2017,03,26
150,Only stayed one night,Wished we could have stayed longer. Very well appointed rooms and execllent staff.  I also liked the location.  Good place to stay. The hotel helped us a great deal with restaurant recommendations and helped us with tourist questions.  Can’t go wrong staying here.,5,2017,03,25
150,An oasis in London,"Perfect location, every convience. Staff in the club lounge even peeled my orange to order. The club floors are the way to go. Great bang for the buck from perks. Breakfast , all day snacks, and from5:30pm two hours of liquor,and snacks, etc.",5,2017,03,25
150,Lovely hotel with great location,"Me and my partner were spending our last night here as diamond members before the change over to 'world of hyatt'. The manager had kindly upgraged us to the newly refurbished regency executive suite so we were excited about our stay here. The room was very morden and cozy with a nice walk in shower and bath, a living and dining area and bedroom. The bathroom has Molton Brown products which were very nice. 
The club lounge is a nice place to relax with a few drinks after a busy day in London. In the evenings staff will bring around some appetizers and are all very friendly and smiley. Its a really nice and relaxed atmosphere. 
The hotel is located in a great location, shops, tube stations are within walking distance and Hyde park is also a short walk which is great to visit on nice sunny days.
Staff at this hotel were great! They were friendly and always willing to make your stay that bit better. 
We really enjoyed our stay here and will definately be back.",5,2017,03,25
150,Superb Hotel,The Churchill is a very great hotel synonymous with the service expected of a luxury Hyatt Hotel. The rooms are large and well appointed. The service is all departments is excellent. It is a pleasure staying at The Churchill.  ,5,2017,03,25

Good value for what you get.  Extremely professional attentive staff and a wonderful selection of food. I'll be coming back for sure.",5,2017,03,25
150,Amazing Champagne Sunday Buffet,The Hotel staff are very attentive and make sure everything is perfect.  The food is prepared to a high quality and there is a wide choice of dishes to sample.  The atmosphere is elegant and it is perfect for a family celebration.  I hope to return again soon ,5,2017,03,25
150,"Magnificent stay at the Hyatt Regency London, would come back!","We stayed for one night here and were not disappointed. Check was friendly, fast and efficient, no waiting around. The lobby entrance was grand, regal and sparkly. Unfortunately no concierge around for the bags on hand, had to ask the receptionist for this. The room was immaculately clean and very modern. The Japanese toilets are intriguing! The decor is definitely not tired, it looked brand new to me. We had a view of the street and the building opposite. There was very little road noise. The bed was ultra comfy with two fluffy pillows. I was slightly surprised there was no bath in the room. The toiletries were lemon scented. I ordered room service - Arabic grill, it arrived with a smile within twenty minutes and was super delicious. I even ordered caffeine free tea bags which arrived within five minutes! Overnight the room was a good temperature, no air con problems. Pls note it was at least a good 11 minute walk pacing it from from the tube with my bag, thank goodness only had one bag. It's not so close if you have heavy luggage. Overall a magnificent time in this modern yet regal hotel with lovely polite staff who bend over backwards to help you. ",5,2017,03,24
150,Never disappoints,"This hotel is situated in a great location with many  shops, parks, restaurants, etc within walking distance as well as being easily accessible by public transport and/or taxi. The staff are very willing to assist with any request. The club lounge is excellent, as is Locanda Locatelli restaurant.  Our recent stay in this hotel was even better than normal - comfiest bed / best room temperature in a hotel for ages (room 907)! This hotel is always our first choice when in London.",5,2017,03,21
150,Great stay!,"We appreciated the central location (near Oxford Street shopping and Marble Arch tube stop) the amazing staff, the large room (especially for London), and the hotel recognizing our anniversary with a dessert and champagne! We will be back! Thank you! ",5,2017,03,20
150,Couldnt to ask for more!,"Stayed fo one night, room upgraded on arrival, every member of staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. Hotel is beautiful, rooms are large, well equipped and clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable.

150,The definition of a 5 star hotel,"Can't say enough good things about this hotel. We were booked here with our Costco Vacation package it was unbelievable how this hotel was perfect in every way. Polite staff in every interaction, immaculate and comfortable rooms and a top notch breakfast buffet were the high points for us. The concierge was very helpful as well giving is money saving tips and great tips and directions. Best hotel stay ever. ",5,2017,03,19
150,Fantastic place to stay when visiting London!,We had an amazing stay at the Hyatt Regency London. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were a great size and very quiet. The hotel is in a great location just off of Oxford st and close to Hyde Park. We would definitely book here again next time we are in London and would 100% recommend it to others.,5,2017,03,19
150,Amazing place to stay in London,"We loved staying here. Beautiful central location, easily one of the nicer hotels my wife and I have stayed in. The concierge service went above and beyond to make sure we knew where we were going and the most cost effective way of getting throughout the city. ",5,2017,03,19
150,Slept great!,The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was so comfortable and quiet. Our requests were all met prior to arrival and we had no issues at all. We will definitely stay here again. We did not eat at the restaurant or order room service so we can't comment on the food. ,5,2017,03,18
150,Hard to beat,"The location is excellent.  The staff are very helpful and friendly. For a stay in London, it can't be beaten. We had a mixed booking (regular and Club on different days) and were immediately upgraded to Club on arrival. A very generous touch.",5,2017,03,18
150,Great Location for this Elegant and Stylish Hotel,"After spending two weeks in 3 other countries, we ended our family trip with 3 nights in London.  The staff was very nice - especially Victoria, she helped in advance with lots of fun activities and tips.  The hotel was located in a great part of town, just a couple blocks from busy Oxford Street and right near lots of great pubs and restaurants.  The room was kind of small, just as they all are in Europe, especially with a rollaway bed, but we didn't spend much time in there.  The only odd thing was that there was no plug for the hairdryer in the bathroom, so one had to dry their hair in the room.  Other than that, highly recommend for the location and friendly doorman alone!",5,2017,03,15
150,Comfortable and well located,"Lovely hotel, spacious rooms by London standards.  Helpful and attentive service.  Would certainly stay again.

Wifi was good, and room service prompt and tasty.  Interior decor charming and location was very convenient for oxford St shopping and the restaurants of Mayfair.",5,2017,03,15
150,Excellent Location,"Located just behind Selfridges, within walking distance to Marble Arch, Bond Street and Oxford Circus, Hyde Park,and Baker Street. Underground Stations are nearby. 
We were in London when it was one of the coldest days in London, the entire hotel felt warm and cosy. The breakfast was good at the Montagu and  is quiet for a cup of coffee.  
Staff are friendly, though there were times, slow in responding.
Overall, it was a very good experience and would go back again.
My husband always stay at Churchill whenever he is London for business.",4,2017,03,15
150,Stunning ,"This place is such a unassuming place from the outside but once in its stunning the staff are fantastic as well is the waiting staff who were simply impeccable definitely on the cards for another visit 
",5,2017,03,14
150,Can it be better?,"We have been globetrotters for 40 years.  The stay at Hyatt Regency is the best stay ever.  Top service from the staff, comfortable and flawless service that contributed to a wonderful stay. The hotel standard is very good and it is close to shopping.",5,2017,03,14
150,Nice hotel in a great location,"The hotel is classic and elegant with a modern feel. Everyone who works in the hotel is friendly, helpful and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The redesigned rooms are very nice and seem to be a good size but the bathrooms are on the small side.",5,2017,03,13
150,Look no Further,"The Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill is the place to stay when visiting London.  Centrally located, Great neighborhood and proximity to public transportation, dining and Parks. The Churchill is why I always look for a Hyatt and my only choice when visiting London",5,2017,03,13
150,London Business Trip,Great place to stay whilst in London.  Short walk to Oxford and Regent Streets.  Staff are very friendly and the rooms are fine albeit small.  Order the fries off the room service menu - magnificent!!  Adequate gym although quite small.,4,2017,03,13
150,"Very Nice Hotel, great Location","Loved the Lobby, the bar and the location.  Rooms are good. Bathrooms a bit old in some of the rooms and the view in the basic rooms is very bad! housekeeping can be better. But overall very good hotel.",4,2017,03,13
150,Classic,"While not having stayed north of Hyde Park for many years, returning to the Churchill on Portman square was a delight.

Despite regular upgrades and refurbishments, to hotel has kept its flair with a grand lobby and its impeccably maintained marble floor -just the extraordinary crystal chandelier has gone. 

Part of the great experience are the staff with some associates being there for over 3 decades and still offering a unique hospitality reinforcing the sense of location. 

Unfortunately the high tea was a disappointment. Sandwiches stale at 4:00 PM, average selection offered and same for the pastries. Service inattentive, no replenishment, tepid water for tea. 
Shame as 2 teas at over 80 Pounds would normally get you a pleasant fare in other known hotel afternoon teas in London.

A let down as in general food and beverage offering at Montagu is of good quality (cheese & wine corner).

For breakfast, ask for Frances, she's been diligently helping guests for 25 years with unique attention to little details and guest recognition.

Last, the team of concierges : Theatre tickets were obtained with the best seats at a blink of an eye, important parcels forwarded without worries and the best table booked at Hakkasan for Sunday brunch. The dream team !

Good to see that classic hotels have managed to stay current with pleasant rooms, impeccable housekeeping and professional staff.

We'll be soon back.",4,2017,03,13
150,Hyatt Regency hotel ,A very good hotel and close to both Oxford and Regent streets. Rooms are mid size but quite modern wuth tea and coffee making facilities. A good lobby area for coffee  and restaurant is also available very convenient ,5,2017,03,13
150,Outstanding hotel and location,"My wife and I were in London to visit my son for a few days in March, 2017. I stay at many Hyatt's for business and I can say this is one of my favorites. It's prime location makes it accessible to most museums by foot or by subway (tube). I can't say enough about the staff. The Regency club on the 8th floor has set the bar for all other Hyatt Regency clubs. We plan on coming back again next year.",5,2017,03,12
150,Worst experience in London,As a Hayyat member who already experienced the Hayyat services in more than one country... The whole experience was a disappointment!  The housekeeping service was extremely poor and below standards!  I had to call everyday for the replinshment of the bathroom amenities and to request cleaning the room properly as they will leave tables full of dust and don't even remove used/ dirty cups!  ,1,2017,03,11
150,Good Location in London,"The customer care  needs improvement. We booked for 4 but stayed 3 nights as we got stuck in Liverpool during a  storm, last month and returned the next day @ 10.00 a.m. The receptionist was just adamant we check out at noon as the hotel was full and didn't want us to stay till 3 p.m. Since the tone had no sympathy, we checked out 10.30 a.m. I would have got better treatment at the Conrad St James's, where we stayed  previously. Concierge service was great and very helpful. 

Rooms were excellent. Beds were comfy and toilet was very clean. Wi-Fi had good speeds.

Location is great as it sits between the Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations. You can explore Oxford Street and the restaurants around. Piccadilly Circus is twenty minutes.Visits to Wellington Arch, Buckingham Palace, Lord's Cricket Ground, Kensington Palace are  well within reach and also discover a lot of London attractions.

We love the  location and would be back.",4,2017,03,11
150,Great english spirit in central london,"Had a great stay. Elegant mix of hyatt hospitality and English spirit. 
Very attentive staff. Good food and beverage. Tastefully refurbished.

150,Great hotel and high quality service,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Churchill last weekend and had a fantastic stay. The manager, Vinzenz, and exec lounge representative, Woris, delivered an exceptional standard of service and were very friendly and enthusiastic. We will definitely be back!",5,2017,03,08
150,Improvement Action is needed,"Overpriced and not a five stars hotel
Hotel lobby is smelly and old which need extreme makeover. House keeping staff are not professional and need training . The coffee machine is not available and we kept asking to provide water",2,2017,03,06
150,just close to center,"Hotel is very close to central London for specially if you need to reach museums, theatres and other places which are should be seen in London. Rooms, services and breakfast are standart. But staffs are very friendly and helper for your questions. Price is high but acceptable for London. You can stay",3,2017,03,05
150,Luxury Accomodation,There is nothing that I can fault.  The room I stayed in was large and recently renovated.  The staff were attentive and efficient.  The gym is simple but includes all types of equipment and weights.  The hotel is well located to the shops in Oxford street.  ,5,2017,03,03
150,brand hotal customer services,"downgraded and selective hyatt customer services received pending on gender, race, look. reluntant  staffs (sohail, ricardo, vicaro, restaurant manager/servers)  in connection to  hyatt's worldwide brand name and excellence in services.",3,2017,03,03
150,Classic Elegance and Exceptional Staff,We have been visiting The Hyatt Regency Churchill for many years and the attentive staff make us feel like we are coming home on every visit. The hotel is classically elegant and understated and the rooms/suites are genuinely comfortable.,5,2017,02,28
150,"Clean, perfectly located, quiet and unpretentious","This is our favourite hotel in London. We come here often with the family. We enjoy its quietness despite being located at the back of Selfridges and oxford St. few minutes away by taxi from places such as Notting Hill Gate, Regent's and Hyde's park. The rooms are not very large but sufficient for a family of three. Food in the room is very nice and served impeccably. Locatelli is a top quality Italian restaurant in the hotel (need some notice booking to get a table). Entrance of the hotel is colorfully decorated with lots of arts on display and available for sale! Breakfast room is similar to others in good hotels in London and oversees Portman Square's gardens.",5,2017,02,27
150,Luxury!,"We loved our stay here and wished that we could have enjoyed it for a few more days. We were in the Suite decorated in museum style.  Always love the Molten Brown toiletries.  Great setup with extra powder room.  Beautiful design and furnishings.  Great service on the club level - delicious breakfast.  The bar in this hotel is very nice, great cocktails, service.  Chic vibe.  Outdoor restaurant looked very nice as well, but we didn't get to try it. Highly recommend!",5,2017,02,27
150,beautiful hotel,"Amazing place to stay in, right in the heart of London. Lovely ambience. Beautifully decorated ant love the art work doted around. Staff go above and beyond. Rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The service is next to none.",5,2017,02,27
150,Beautiful hotel and impeccable service!,"I stayed at this hotel with my sister and we just loved it.  I accidentally left my camera in the taxi upon arrival to the hotel.  The hotel security was able to help me retrieve the taxi information and the concierge was able to get in touch with the driver and arrange for the return of my camera.  I could not be more grateful! They were so efficient and nice in helping me, I was really impressed.  The room we had was beautiful and very clean.  The executive lounge has long hours (open until 11pm) which was great to stop for a cup of tea before going to bed. The location of the hotel is very convenient and I'd recommend anyone to stay here!",5,2017,02,26
150,Hyatt Churchill,"Another fabulous stay at this hotel , we love it here . So comfortable and central , highly recommend to anyone visiting London for business or pleasure . Rooms are gorgeous , beds super comfortable overall beautiful ",5,2017,02,26
150,5 o'clock check in?????,"Over all The Churchill is a wonderful hotel.  The check in and out was where the hotel failed.  Firstly could not get into our 2 rooms till 5 o'clock this I feel is totally unacceptable gave us a free drink in the bar as compensation , better than nothing I suppose. Check in is at 3PM  On checking out we ask for a late check out at 1pm which was agreed. So on day of check out had a few last minute things to do including meeting friends for breakfast at the Ivy (can recommend) On our return our key didnt work , went to concierge as huge queue at reception nothing they could do  they sent us to the eighth floor to deal with the problem there.  Apparently all keys are voided at 12 on day of check out and if you have late check out your key needs to be re validated (which the receptionist forgot to do!!)So for an hour I had to spend my time up and down in the lifts and qeueing doing the receptionist work!! not happy. So maybe if you do check into this hotel you should think about prompting the receptionist to do her job properly",5,2017,02,26
150,Hyatt Experience,"Convenient location as it is close to my meetings location. With the exception of the Door men service, overall it ia above average services. Rooms are very clean but lacks amenities and you have to ask for it. Finally, reasonable room space.",4,2017,02,26
150,Relaxing,"First stay at the Churchill.  Weekend layover in between work stops.  Could not have been better.  Outstanding benefits for diamond members.  Separate check in location, really good lounge on the same floor and suite upgrade provides great accommodations.  Easy access to Oxford street, Mayfair dining locations and the tube.",5,2017,02,25
150,Great hotel and the bar is Churchill.,Cigars and port after a long day at the air show. The best! Wonderful selection of cigars you can't get in the US and excellent port wines. Rooms were very spacious compared to other hotels I have stayed at.,5,2017,02,22
150,Wonderful venue,"I've been to this hotel before. It's a great place where they remember you. The beds are very comfortable, and the breakfasts are ample & delicious. The venue is also exceptionally convenient for city business.",5,2017,02,22

150,2nd Visit.  Great property,"This property is a gem among hotels in London.  Great locations, amazing staff and outstanding service.  

I highly recommend getting club level access as you can enjoy a wonderful breakfast and nice evening snacks (including alcohol) all complimentary.

The rooms are in great shape as is th3 lobby, lobby-bar and meeting areas. ",5,2017,02,20
150,Beautiful weekend,Fantastic stay at the churchill. Wonderful staff and fab hotel . So relaxed and nothing was to much trouble for all the wonderful breakfast staff. The team truly made us feel like nothing was to much . ,5,2017,02,20
150,Visit to London,"Attended a conference in London and stayed at the Churchill (location of the conference).  Very comfortable, clean, helpful/friendly staff.  Not very far from a number of attractions (Big Ben, London Eye, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park).  Lots of shopping, pubs and restraunts in the area.",4,2017,02,20
150,You are my man - team of doorman,"You should understand that Hyatt Regency London has a reputable history.  That means all facilities are not trendy but still keep it in good condition.  What I would like to mention is not the hardware.  Their hospitality is an gem and the team of doorman is deserved to highlight.  They are smart, friendly and help me to solve my situation (my car parking).  Can I vote them as the staffs of the month if it has not decided yet in January, especially the black fella (I'm sorry that I forgot to ask your name but your are slimmest of your two colleagues).",4,2017,02,20
150,A Nice Hotel at a Perfect Location,"If part of your plan to stay in London is to utilize the London public transportation, be convenient for shopping and within walking distance for good restaurants, then this hotel will fit your bills perfectly well.  The hotel is quiet and located in a serene 'square' off the busy and vibrant Oxford Street.  Hence I see no real reason to pay a bit more for the public 'garden' view.    The staff are polite and professional.  The rooms are clean and contemporarily decorated.  Overall, a very pleasant hotel for business or pleasure visit to London.",4,2017,02,19
150,Unfortunate piano policy,"Very disappointed that I was stopped from playing the piano, apparently for ""safety reasons"". In many hotels, I am welcomed to play the piano, sometimes I get given a complimentary glass of wine while I am playing, etc. The piano is in awful condition, and it is an insult to professional musicians that the hotel expects them to play on such an instrument. The tuning is not so bad, but the action is terrible.  The staff are very courteous, but rather ""stiff"" and ""formal""",4,2017,02,19
150,Churchill wins!  us and our preferences.,Welcoming and remembered us and our preferences.  Rooms refurbished and very comfortable.  Breakfast good with attentive smiling service. Great location for shopping and close to some great casual dining. ,5,2017,02,19
150,Great location,"Absolutely unbeatable location, great service, perfect for business or for a fun trip. Would stay again in a heartbeat ! Gym was not impressive and you can feel the age of a property, but overall great.",4,2017,02,18
150,A totally very good hotel,My wife and I stayed at the Churchill being in the Hyatt Regency group. We loved staying there. Normally we order a club room but we found that expensive and more expensive than other Hyatt hotels we usually are staying on. The hotel also have a very good restaurant; Locanda Locatelli which we recommend.,5,2017,02,18
150,Perfect weekend,"Came back to the hotel after many years , the service and attention was just right. Had dinner in the Montagu and must say everything was just so ...... Good menu, a little pricey but good value as the quality was evident. The bed were perfect, had great sleep and woke up fresh.",5,2017,02,18
150,"Great rooms, great location","Family short trip. Upgraded (prem card) to park view refurbished rooms (interconnecting). Rooms fantastic including electronic toilet (great fun for the kids!).

150,Nice hotel with plenty to do inhouse,"One can spend a lovely evening juggling between the bars and restaurants just within the hotel. The rooms are a bit small but I guess that comes with any hotel in central
London. Would recommend the Churchill bar for its cocktails and cigars. ",4,2017,02,17
150,Above my expectations,"I was favourably impressed by the Hyatt Regency Churchill. Nice Rooms with nice bathrooms. Room service was quick and my order was executed correctly! I was less impressed by the Restaurant. We returned from a venue just before 11pm. The Bar was full. All we wanted was a glass of wine. The Restaurant staff told us "" no"" we are closing. Not top marks for this. 
Otherwise I can recommend as the location is excellent!",4,2017,02,15
150,"Location , service and history ","My last stay in this hotel was about 13 years ago when it was part of the Intercontinental group. I must say the level of service was great from the check in desk with Christian and Natalia to Sahil and his Consierge colleges to house keeping, one of the best customer service in London. The Hotel itself is a landmark building named after one the most famous British politicians and WWII heros. It has been recently updated with nice modern rooms but I missed the classic style of the hotel (that's why I gave it 4 and not 5)
The hotel is very close Hayd park and Oxford Street with Selfridges about 3 Min walk.
I would recommend this hotel for anyone going to London.",4,2017,02,14
150,This hotel is not as good as before,"I have stayed at this hotel before, but I have to say that this time was a bit disappointing.  The air-condition in my room was not working, I called the housekeeping team in the morning, asked them to have a look if the air-condition was out of order or I haven't set it up properly. When I returned my room in the evening, the room temperature was ok although the air-condition was still not working. However, it was quite cold next day morning in the room. I hope someone can fix it. I tried to order some food from the hotel's app. After waiting for the pasta for 40mins, I realised there might be something wrong with my order. I called the room service centre, they told me that they are no longer using the app. I would suggest the app should inform customers that the function of ordering room service is no longer available. by the way, the food wasn't bad.",2,2017,02,14
150,London weekend break,"Have  London several times and this location for taking in the sights, theatre, shopping etc was fantastic.

Only disappointment my daughter wanted to take a picture of one of the guys who greets outside the hotel - she though he looked like her Grandad",5,2017,02,14
150,This hotel was very nice and in a great location. Easy walk to marble arch and bond street tube stations.,"Staff was very friendly, room was large and comfortable. Only used the concierge desk once to book a tour and they were very helpful. The breakfast buffet was pricey at £30, but the assortment and quality of food was excellent ",5,2017,02,13

It was great having a big window looking over a small park and to enjoy the weather. Guests of this hotel are in walking distance to two major streets oxford street and ajwa road. I would stay at this place again!",5,2017,02,13
150,Hyatt Churchill Experience,"Top end hotel in central London. Excellent concierge, and excellent night's sleep. Overall experience good, however staff interactions bordered on the impersonal with some staff a bit overanxious to keep out the riff raff who happened to be guests. They's probably not used to guests carrying a rucsac, and preferring walking to a taxi.",3,2017,02,13
150,Amazing hotel!,"Fantastic in every way! The location, the friendliness, the comfort, the cleanliness, the topclass of the hotel!
It was our second time at the Churchill and we will definitely return!

150,To slow on check in and everything seems like hard work to resolve,"Every time I check in to this hotel it is hard work and nothing is ever available as a gold card member get a bit boring after a while dealing with this.
You stay a top hotels in Dubai get points and try to use them and it seems as if you get treated as if you want free rooms cheap not good considering amount you have paid on other trips ",2,2017,02,10
150,"Great location, good club lounge","We stayed there for a while during December.  Although the bathroom was modestly small, the room was elegant and comfortable.  We had access to the club lounge and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  The gym had the basic equipment but could have been bigger with a fuller range.  No pool was a slight minus for my ratings.  Concierge was really attentive and managed to help us book a 2-star Michelin restaurant last minute.  Conveniently located behind Selfridges and walking distance to subway and bus stations.  Would recommend to friends.  Will need to book well in advance to get the bigger rooms / suites, which are located at the corners of each floor.",4,2017,02,10
150,Would recommend,"Nice hotel, very busy typical London hotel. A short walk to Selfridegs and Oxford Street. The nearest tube being Bond Street. Very clean, room upgraded on arrival.

We would stay again.",4,2017,02,09
150,"Wonderful location, full service FIVE stars","Stayed for business, The Churchill was well located next to Oxford St, Regent street a few minutes away.

150,Consistant,"That is the word that best describes The Churchill, consistent. Consistently high standards over many years added to its excellent location and setting. Only negative is the pricepoint. which is trending high.",5,2017,02,07
150,Friendly staff and great location ,"The hotel is in a convenient location and well appointed.   The bar and restaurants are fantastic. Especially locanda locatelli.

The room was clean and lovely and the staff ensure that you are satisfied with the amenities.

The elevators say they require a key for access but that isnt exactly the case.  It wasn't an issue but as a female traveling alone, I'd prefer a more secure elevator.  Anyone could get on your floor!!

The front desk staff are, as are all staff,  friendly and helpful.  Whether it be early check in, directions or just a smile.

Highly recommend this hotel to anyone",4,2017,02,06
150,I keep returning here!,"Like an old friend, this hotel is always a great place to visit in London.
I love the rooms, the breakfast and the staff here.  
Not to be be missed is a great bar and an even better outdoor bar area (heated in winter!) for a cigar and scotch.

There is a great restaurant adjacent to the hotel and many more within a short walking distance of the hotel.  Portman Square is a lovely section of London, just off the busy Oxford Street commercial boulevard area.  Close to Marble Arch tube station and Hyde Park.  

All of this keeps me coming back.",4,2017,02,04
150,An efficient and convenient hotel,It took us a short taxi ride to reach this hotel from st Pancras station. The check in was ok.

150,"Nice stay, close to tune station",My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill for two nights during our recent trip to England and Scotland. The staff are helpful in recommending restaurants and how to get to local sites. Our room was large and comfortable with a nice-sized bathroom and shower. The hotel is a five-minute walk to the Marble Arch underground station and within walking distance of several tourist locations. I would recommend the Hyatt Regency London for any travelers going to London. ,5,2017,02,01

The Churchill was conveniently located to excellent shopping, the staff was great and the hotel itself very comfortable.  Power outlets of all varieties in the room were a welcome convenience.",5,2017,01,30
150,Excellent hotel with loads of atmosphere,"I would recommend this hotel to stay as the food was good and the atmosphere was excellent. Had a lovely stay and the staff were helpful with my shopping trip and helped me find where I needed to go.I ate breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner there which was excellent.The only disappointment was on both bath towels I found lipstick and mascara which did not spoil the overall stay as I had such a wonderful time.",5,2017,01,30
150,"Hyatt Regency London,","The Hotel is located at 30 Portman Square, around a 5 minute walk from Marble Arch Tube Station and round the corner from Primark on Oxford Street. The rooms are well laid out with good amenities and tranquility backed by excellent service. Breakfast is great and so is the Regency Lounge,, Hotel is great fro both holiday stays and the business traveller.",5,2017,01,30
150,Excellent location; exceptional service and quality,"I have traveled to London dozens of times from the United States and this hotel provides the creature comforts that Americans come to expect.  Beautifully appointed rooms, a helpful staff, and a clean, comfortable hotel.  Being in London, the rooms are on the smaller side, but it's all about location.  About 2 blocks off of the southern end of Oxford Street, you are a short walking distance to Hyde Park and all of the shopping your heart desires.  I always encourage visitors to walk as much as possible.  You really don't get to know a city until you've walked through all of the streets, and with London, there is simply so much to see.  Be mindful of the location.  If you need to be near Westminster, this is about as far away as you can get.  But Black Taxi cab drivers are brilliantly informed and respectful.  Consider using Addison Lee as an good alternative.  Their drivers are skilled and professional.  You won't be disappointed with the quality of this hotel, but consider always consider location.  Traffic in London is basically as bad as can be.",5,2017,01,29
150,Decent,"We found this hotel to be very underwhelming given how expensive it is ($600 USD per night). Rooms are tiny, even by London standards. Average decor and bathrooms that could definitely be updated. We were given Club access, but didn't end up using it since it was remarkably full every single day. 

The only thing good about this hotel is that it's in a good, safe location - 6 minute walk from the Mable arch. We stayed here on Hyatt points. I would definitely not stay here again if I had to pay out of pocket - there are MUCH better options.",3,2017,01,29
150,Like returning home,"Its been 20 years since I last stayed here. Jobs, families and other demands meant that top end London hotels were not a priority. As a final treat I decided to revisit my old favourite and what a treat it was.

Now under management of the Hyatt Regency group, the hotel has been modernised and brought into the 21st century. The clean lines and colour palate makes a welcome greeting. Front desk and concierge staff are wonderful and nothing is too difficult.

A room facing the square meant I had plenty of room - something most London hotels cannot boast. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms modern and sleek. Check out the swish toilets which feature heated seats and water sprays - front and back!

Breakfast is now served in the ground floor restaurant. Terribly expensive but when you are treating yourself a good hot English breakfast can't be missed.

A special thank you for making a change room available for a shower after check out in readiness for a long haul late night flight. It was a pleasure to reaquaint myself with an old favourite.",5,2017,01,29
150,Great London Central Hotel,Located in very convenient location & not directly on busy Oxford St. Hotel is been recently renovated and rooms are in very good condition with good size considering it's location. Good hotel for either business or vacations as everything is in walking distance and have an easy access to central line.,5,2017,01,28
150,Comfortable and fuss free.,I was there for 2 days. It is a standard hotel room design but is so comfortable. A lovely mattress and I got a great view of the park. The bathroom has a bathtub and all the necessary fittings to hang up used towels et al and space to put your toilet bags by the sink. The room has an iron and a board and wardrobe storage.,4,2017,01,28
150,Very Nice Hotel and Close to the Action,"Hotel is very nice, and has an old worldly charm without seeming old (run-down).  Rooms were nice, beds were very comfy (twin room).  Fresh coffee in the lobby, but not in the rooms, only tea.  Hotel is near Hyde Park which makes getting to touristy sites a quick ride via Uber.",4,2017,01,27
150,Club room heaven,"The Churchill club world - is quiet, underplayed and very comfortable.  It is never high design or flashy but simply solid, comfortable and restful.  It quickly becomes home.  After tiring days out in London it was wonderful to just come home and flop. Service is flawless. Beds are heavenly. The suites are small but it is enjoyable looking out to the trees in Portman Square, and the balcony is enjoyable in the right weather.",5,2017,01,26
150,Very nice hotel in the heart of London,"If you are fan of the Marylebone area (Oxford Street - Marylebone Road - Edgware Road - Great Portland Street) is the place to stay in London. 15 minutes by foot to Oxford Circus and 15 minutes by foot to Hyde Park lake. Luxurious and clean rooms, very good restaurant and very kind and professional staff !!! 
it's worth every penny, as the British sayings.",4,2017,01,23
150,Great stay at The Churchill,Loved this hotel. Just the right level of luxury. Wonderful cocktail bar. Luxurious bedding. Delicious breakfast. Ideal location. Great service through out. A perfect stay. I would recommend this to family and friends with no hesitation.,5,2017,01,23
150,Wonderful Hotel,"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency one night due to a business trip. The location was perfect as it was not even 5 minutes away from our office.  I had the opportunity to stay in the renovated part on the 4th floor. Everything was just absolutely amazing. All of the staff was extremely friendly and very helpful and truly lovely. They took care that I absolutely enjoy the stay at the Hyatt.  The room was beautiful. I had a huge bed, everything was super clean. Amazing bathroom with a heated toilet and other gimmicks.  Too bad it was only one night but I hope to come back soon. I can highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,21
150,Great place,"This was a great hotel to stay at, staff were extremely friendly and attentive in all areas of interaction. It was an extremely pleasant stay from check in till check out. It may be a little more expensive then some of the other options in the area but definitely worth it and you can see why if you stay there",5,2017,01,19
150,National Museum of Women in the Arts,"Superb place to stay; wonderful staff, excellent food, comfortable rooms and great location! Whether you are with a group or on your own, business or pleasure, we would give this hotel 5 stars. What more can we say!",5,2017,01,19
150,Great London location near Hyde Park and Oxford Street,"I've stayed here twice.  The main floor with lobby, restaurant and Churchill bar are very nice.  Concierge is very helpful for restaurant recommendations and tickets.  Selfridge's is 5-10 minute walk.  Victoria and Albert Museum and Royal Albert Hall are a short taxi ride or long walk.  Nearby restaurants that are very good are The Grazing Goat (gastropub), The Portman (nice but noisy bar and upstairs restaurant with good food) and, a little further walk, is The Golden Hind (this one is a fish and chips place and is on a quaint street). I would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,01,17
150,Becareful ordering food,"Two of the group are Dimond members of Hyatt's loyalty program and spend a great deal of time in there hotels across the globe.

We had the pleasure of booking a suit at the hotel in London and were very impressive with the general service and room, until we order food to be delivered to the club lounge. 

On eating the pasta dish one of our group found a foreign item and lucky managed to avoid swallowing it. On close inspection the item turned out to be a piece of metal that came from a brush used to clean the pots. What we can't understand is if the pot was rinsed after being cleaned, because this should have never been in there.

We complained to the duty managers on call and they apologised and offered for us to try a different restaurant at the hotel, but our group were sickened by what had happened and refused to eat any food at the hotel.",1,2017,01,17
150,Love Love Love,"Stayed here 4 days during Christmas and just loved it!  Loved the location, room and overall layout are extremely clean and ""new"".  The staff is wonderful.  Bed was super comfortable.  Highly recommend and would stay here again.",5,2017,01,17
150,Classy Churchill,"Booked a weekend at the London Hyatt Regency Churchill to celebrate a dual birthday weekend with my daughter - chose the Churchill for location - close to Oxford Street and Hyde Park

Arrived and on check in was wished a Happy Birthday which was a nice touch - only exceeded by entry into the joining rooms to find a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and a beautiful birthday cake - thoroughly enjoyed by both of us.

Lovely rooms overlooking Portman Square and with access to the club floor.

Breakfast was available in the club lounge but we opted to dine downstairs - excellent decision - lovely choice in the buffet and an extensive a la carte - service lovely and nothing was too much trouble.

This is a truly relaxing well situated and very enjoyable hotel - highly recommend it - busy yet personable 

Tip - book early and let them know of your preferences or needs they will do what they can to make it happen 

Definitely a return to hotel ",5,2017,01,16
150,The most amazing sleep and much more,"After 16 hours of air and airport travel I arrived at the Churchill Hotel in London around 11:30 AM not knowing if my room would be ready. I was greeted by an exceptionally friendly front desk staff who clearly knew this was my first stay at this Hyatt property. Their checking in process was very fast and efficient but more importantly my room was ready.
The best part of my stay was that I was able to sleep for six hours before my meetings in the evening in the perfect silence of the corridors in this hotel and without any noise disturbance. The bed and its linens made my sleeping hours a perfect experience. Fabulous beding. Excellent shower and Milton Brown amenities including the hard to find find mouth wash. 
This hotel is very different to my usual boutique hotel stays in London but the perfect silence during the day time sleep made all the difference. However, what made the real difference was the unexpected pleasure of meeting the General Manager of this property while having my business breakfast in their restaurant. Arnaud de Saint-Exupery is clearly a seasoned hotelier who knows the value of guest relations and striking up a conversation with newcomers to his property. He is working with a terrific team. If you are ever at the Hyatt Regency London make sure you have their Full English Breakfast and look out for the ever so attentive and brilliantly in tune Restaurant Manager Alan Cook.
He made all the difference. 
A fabulous stay with exceptional 2 nights of sleep, excellent staff, great business breakfast and a seasoned management team. I will be back very soon.",5,2017,01,13
150,Above the average of Hyatt recency ,"I have to say that this Hyatt recency is beyond what I expected. Situated just of Oxford street and right behind Selfridges, it took me by surprise that the hotel is quite serene in a way. I stayed at the club lounge floor, so it was very convenient for me. The room decor is very nice. I love its bed and pillow. Breakfast, lunch were very nice. Churchill bar is cool!. I love it! ",5,2017,01,13
150,"Gracious staff, first rate accommodation","My sons and I are just completing a four night stay at the hotel, and it has been remarkable. Every staff person we met was more gracious than the last. Our room was spacious, beautifully appointed, comfortable, completely clean and had amazing soundproofing. There was no street noise, no hall noise. We slept beautifully every night on comfortable beds with first class linens. The shower had a large rainfall shower with great volume and unlimited hot water. There was every amenity.

The hotel itself is modern and understated. The lobby is wide and long and there is a lovely fire at one end for drinks and chats with friends, which I did one night and greatly enjoyed. I saw very nice meeting space for business. There is also a bar and outside dining for warmer weather.

The daily breakfast is very good, understated but plentiful. There is a very good selection of hot and cold items, and the open kitchen is there to serve you whatever you might want made to order.

The location was ideal. Close to Hyde Park for a run or walk, Marble Arch or Bond Street tube stations, an inexpensive spare suitcase at Primark and of course, beautiful Portman Square. A few minutes walk puts you at Selfridges and M&S.

Really enjoyed this stay and this side of town. I will visit again and hopefully, soon.",5,2017,01,11
150,Outstanding,Everything was perfect. Outstanding service and friendly and professional staff. Nice atmosphere in a beautiful hotel. Our room was newly renovated and the bed and the linen first class. The location could not have been better.  ,5,2017,01,10
150,Christmas treat,We enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt which was part of our Christmas present to each other.It included dining at Locanda Locatelli which was also excellent .we also went to the theatre in the afternoon and in all everything came together for a very good experience,4,2017,01,10
150,London,Very good time in a lovely place. I would only change the firmness of the bed. Staff are very attentive. Afternoon tea is worth trying. The location of the hotel makes it very attractive for shopping on Oxford Street or Holborn or even Mayfair. ,5,2017,01,06
150,Amazing Weekend at The Churchill!!,"Attention to detail, excellent customer service and a lovely environment are the hallmarks of a wonderful hotel experience. From the moment we arrived and were upgraded to the Regency Club level experience (highly recommended) -the staff were amazing.  The recognition of my birthday was a wonderful surprise. We especially appreciated the concierge who provided access to the locked Portman Square gardens. Even in November it was a memorable experience. This was my first time at The Churchill but it won't be my last. ",5,2017,01,05
150,hotel owner,very bad service i am in my thirt day in the hotel room 512 and the room has not be maid telephone i have to call from my mobile out side line to speak with the reception the first day when i arrive they told me that is not bosible to be accomadate because we are 2 plus 2 children l was lucky i had the confirmation from booking com with me they told me that is booking com mistage any way after some time a very bad nanager come and he said not in a very nice way that he will put an extra bed but we have to move in a biger room the next day i went to  see them the next day they told to put our staff in the case and they will move them for us so we done  we come arount 4 in the afternoon i went in the reception and the girl told me that i must stay in the some room or to move tonight because the other room is not free yet . i said why you doing this to us we cane for 3 days holidays i said to stay in out room we are ok but you press us to move  my opinion the hotel is 5 stars the building the service at the reception the cleaning in the rooms the broken telephone 0 stars only the restaurant is profesional  i will never go again to this hotel konstantinos giourgas  vidos travel owner,1,2017,01,04
150,there are some people from some country made that hotel look bad,"there are some people from some country made that hotel look bad, and the management do nothing about it such as they cook inside there rooms and the smell was so baaaaad the price is good if you consider the location and the star of the hotel",4,2017,01,03
150,5 STAR SERVICE,Great Service & Top Staff all around 5 star service given only thing is car parking should be underground but not a problem as there is car park 1 mins away and cheap as well prebook it and location is top ,5,2017,01,02
150,Going downhill fast,"This has been our hotel of choice in central London but no more. A cleaner knows he/she has cleaned up vomit that morning and so to put new guests in that room is disgraceful for a 5 star hotel at £350-400 a night. We'd booked a room for us and our daughter. Asked THREE times for the additional bed only to be told at 10:30pm our room was not big enough for a roll away......DUH!!!
So many better hotels than this for the price",1,2017,01,02
150,"Very good hotel, good service and great location","Just completed the first 3days of what will be a 7night stay at the hotel and although it has been extremely busy over the New Year period the service and accessibility to everything is great.

The amba executive lounge however is very 'Un-Executive'!! Full all the time, with lots of children running around and difficult to get a seat at the peak times! 

We found the main restaurant much better for breakfast and the service we received from SHAHLO at breakfast was the best we have experienced on our trip. She was friendly, helpful and pleasant which is normally hard to find in a hotel that is so busy. Her information and conversations were extremely helpful and we will certainly be having breakfast each morning in her area for the remainder of our stay.

All in all a great hotel that is within walking distance of most attractions and events in London.

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,01,02
150,Excellent hotel!,"Beautiful renovations, love the colors, decor, very soft bedding and pillows! Staff was extremely pleasant.  The food was very good in the restaurant and bar area, only drawback was the drinks are all priced too high. However, this is may only complaint...I'll definitely be back!",5,2017,01,02
150,Nice lobby and location ,This is one of my favorite hotels in london . The hotel is luxury and clean and has been renovated . The location was very good just off oxford street and behind selfridges. Make sure you take a room with garden view and high floors . The toilets are very small Which was a negative but they have the water spray for washing for cleaning while sitting . It was a nice hotel and will surely come back again . ,4,2017,01,01
150,Hotel location is perfect,I would recommend it for anyone is planning to go with his family and wants oxford street area but i would recommend him to  choose the new bathrooms rooms and portman square view.  There breakfast price is a bit expensive and they need to reduce it and they need to add a coffee machine to each room similar to any 5 stars hotel these days.,3,2017,01,01
150,Great Overnight stay in London,"Hyatt Regency London- Churchill  is a great place to stay - phenomenal location by Oxford Street, friendly staff, and very nice guest rooms..  The staff go above and beyond to make sure their guests are comfortable - will definitely stay there again when we visit London.",5,2016,12,31
150,Hotel of good location,Not a very fancy hotel but it is comfortable.  Esp their bed or maybe I was so tried after the harrods.  The room services menu has lots of choices and it is of a reasonable price.  The restaurant and bar on the ground floor are both good.  Good location and just a few steps to the outside n busy London. ,4,2016,12,30
150,hotel stay,"high quality service and warm wel coming, the hotel guest . are . The address is near centre of london and have easy .  The  food quality is great with vary.accessrelation very highly proffessional and great welcoming",4,2016,12,30
150,Very small bathrooms.,"Nice hotel overall, good location, good service and food but the bathrooms are as small as airplanes bathrooms. Staff are nice. Free Internet is very fast and you can connect as many devices as you want. ",4,2016,12,29
150,Churchill Hotel,"Excellent location 1 block from Marble Arch. Very good service. Inside very cosy and won't feel the low temperatures outside. 8 floor club room nice but limited eats for muslims. Only downside no pool, sauna & jacuzzi. Has gym but no shower facilities. ",4,2016,12,29
150,Robbery Incident ," Our stay at the Hyatt started on a very bad note of being given a key to an already occupied room! We were then upgraded to a suite which we appreciate after the very awkward and unprofessional incident of walking in on some hotel guest.

Putting this incident aside, on our second day I was in a hurry and forgot a Marks & Spencer envelope with money I exchanged the previous day on the bed. 

When I went back to the room expecting to find the envelope as is, I was shocked to find that IT WASN'T there. The room windows were recklessly left open by the house keeping, and the hot water bottle was left under the bed cover from last night, indicating the level of cleanliness and tidiness of the house keeping personnel.

After the shock, I got very upset and I asked my husband to report the incident to the hotel. My husband being confused with what exactly happened told the head of security that I might have lost them outside the hotel and might have left them in the room. The hotel of course decided to hold me accountable for not putting the money in the safe and decided to focus on the scenario that I might have lost the money outside the hotel.

Finally, the hotel did some poor investigations and my money was taken from the room and I never got them back.

I will never ever stay in a 5 star hotel were I get robbed and be held accountable for it!

Definitely a horrible experience!",2,2016,12,28
150,Front desk,"Bad customer service front desk attitude not helpful at all. Would go back to Mayfair hotel where the customer service was good I have stayed there a few times. Please call me regarding this.
Very disappointed in the staff",1,2016,12,25
150,Superb hotel and great lovation,"I have stayed in the Hyatt in the past and always enjoyed my experience there but the recent refurb has taken this top hotel up a new level.  Great choice of restaurants (including Michelin star dining), very nice cocktail bar and the rooms were large, luxurious and comfortable.  Will definitely be back but with the wife next time!  Right behind Oxford street for great shopping too",5,2016,12,24
150,The Perfect Stay,"Moved here after a terrible night's sleep at the Sumner hotel down the road from this one.  What a pleasant relief it was to stay here!

It was quiet, very comfortable and the perfect place to stay in this area of London.

Bed was comfortable, room was large and clean, wifi was fast and strong, and the heated toilet seat was a pleasant surprise.

Complaints: none

I look forward to staying here again on my next trip to London.",5,2016,12,23
150,Anniversary trip to London,"We arrived four hours before our check in time expecting to drop off our bags. The reception staff were very helpful and found us a room we could check in to and upgraded us for free!

We really used the hotel as a base whilst visiting Londons shop, theatres and restaurant. The hotel is very well kept and located 1 min from Oxford street and 5 mins from tube stations.

We both had a good nights sleep.",4,2016,12,23
150,Every Moment was Perfect,"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Churchill. The staff was fantastic from the moment we arrived. We landed in London around 8:30am and went directly to the hotel. The check-in staff was so helpful and located a fantastic room for us right away. This was unexpected since we arrived so early in the day. Our room was AMAZING and we loved that it had one US outlet in the room. 
The location is close to the Underground and several attractions.
We enjoyed an afternoon tea and dinner one night and really enjoyed it.
The Regency Club staff was the best I've ever seen. The food and drinks were great too.
We will stay here again the next time we visit London and you should too!",5,2016,12,20
150,Beautiful room and exceptional staff,"The room was so lovely and so peaceful, I didn't want to leave. The hotel has recently been refurbished to a very high standard and the fittings and colours were so lush and restful. Excellent breakfast. The staff were also exceptional, I hope to go back soon!",5,2016,12,20
150,Terrible Staff - they need extra training,"I had a problem at the check in and took almost an hour to complete the process so that the front desk staff can verify on how much extra that I should pay.... Guess what, I was right as a customer but it took the check in staff almost an hour to confirm I was right all along.. Felt I was wasting my time to call up to reservation and to make the necessary arrangements and then had to deal with the front desk staff separately... I felt I should have just waited until check in and dealt with my request then...it would have been a better experience as I don't really with so many incompetent staff at Hyatt Regency. I also asked for my bonus point but hey guess what I did not get it and guess I need to call the hotel and asked for it again.",1,2016,12,19
150,An unassuming but fine hotel,"On arrival at the Churchill we were a little disappointed. Occupying a decades old building, with a small lobby, we felt this might not live up to expectations we had for a Hyatt Regency. We were quickly reassured by the quick and friendly greeting as soon as we neared he lobby door. With a room booked on the club level we were ushered to the elevators and sent to the 8th floor. Staff there, noting we had been on an overnight flight from Boston seated us in the lounge providing breakfast and most importantly lots of fresh hot coffee. A request was made to housekeeping for a quick turn around and we were in a room in within the hour. 
We could not get a history on the hotel, a 9 story brick building in a neighborhood with many similar buildings was decades old. Inside however it was modern, clean, and impeccably cared for. Staff was warm, caring, knowledgable and friendly. Our room was small with a California king bed, a small bathroom but the toilet had  a heated seat and bidet built in. The hotel is centrally located a  few blocks from Hyde Park and Kensington garden. Paddington station was an 8 pound ride. We walked to the station, Piccadilly Circus, and Kensington Palace. 

We had a great time. The hotel as base was perfectly located and fit like an ""old shoe.""  Could not have been better for a long weekend. Breakfast in the lounge was more than adequate as was the evening cocktail hour with an open,  pour your own bar. We went out to dinner but it appeared that many had their dinner there. ",5,2016,12,19
150,Another good visit ,"Stayed for a night this time. Was in one of their new rooms on the second floor. Unfortunately a bit noisy as opposite the gym, although convenient. The bathroom seems a lot smaller than their regular bathrooms but with a great shower. Beds remain as comfortable. Furniture though does feel quite cheap and prefab though. Wish they had used the renovation to increase the size of the gym as it's always full, no space to move and unfortunately smells as ventilation is limited. ",4,2016,12,18
150,My 18th Birthday amazing hotel stay,"My grandparents and I arrived at the hotel around 12 pm and after a short check in process we were assigned rooms,  I got the room which was adjacent to my grandparents' room, which had a king bed.
Due to my grandparents status we had lounge access, where we met the lovely staff, including lounge manager Gita and lovely host Beata, both made me feel very welcome.
On the day we arrived, I celebrated my 18th birthday so the lounge staff arrange a cake for me the entire staff sang Happy Birthday to me while I was drinking my first glass of white wine not as a minor.
Back in the room was waiting me a bottle of Italian sparkling wine and a cake, which were a pleasent surprised.
The hotel has done a lot to celebrate my special day and I highly appreciate all they have done and I couldn't have ask for more.

Now, location wise, the hotel is both very central located and off center.
It is only a block away from Mark's & Spencer and Selfridges, which makes his location extremely well, and at the same time he is located a block away from the busy Oxford Street, in front of Portman Square, so you can escape the crowd while still being in a very central location.

The food at the club lounge were tasty.

Overall, from the location to the staff, it was an excellent stay, one that I'll remember for a long time.
Thank you very much Hyatt Regency London, you made my birthday stay better than I expected.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL.",5,2016,12,18

Club lounge is good but breakfast variety can be improved. Overall good service.",5,2016,12,16
150,Cozy and friendly,"The place is very nice and quiet with a charming friendly staff. They will go out of their way to satisfy your needs. The 2 restaurants we went to were very good. It was truffle season, so I forked out extra for a nice veal chop with shaved truffle. It was delicious and a lot bigger than I expected.

Highly recommended",5,2016,12,15
150,Winter Wonderland Weekend,"My 2 grandchildren (aged 9 and 11) and I stayed in a Park View Twin Room at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill when they visited London for the first time.  We had an amazing time, thank you. The hotel is beautiful, the food is great and the staff are really friendly too.  Thank you for helping to make our weekend a trip they will always fondly remember!!",5,2016,12,15
150,Lovely hotel in brilliant location ,"My husband, toddler and I stayed for two weeks at this lovely hotel. Comfortable rooms with luxurious amenities and very friendly and efficient staff. We were very well taken care of and everyone we came in contact with were very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is also very conveniently located close to Oxford street which was a big advantage. 

Would definitely return to this lovely property! ",5,2016,12,15
150,Incredible Experience,"We decided to see the Christmas lights in Regents Street and Oxford Street and bearing in mind Portman Square is at one end of Oxford Street The Churchill seemed the ideal place to spend the night. The hotel and staff from the very outset  were a delight, the service was faultless and our room overlooking Portman Square was perfect. Needless to say a certain amount of shopping was almost obligatory but even this was relatively painless ! ! 
I will certainly use The Churchill at a future date when I am spending the night in the metropolis.",5,2016,12,14
150,Great Hotel,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  the concierge's desk was one of the best I'm experienced around.  Always staffed and willing to help with any questions or requests.  the food was great and service was fast.,5,2016,12,13

150,Churchill Hotel Portman Square London,"The Hotel has a great location if you have work commitments around the High St. area , Oxford St etc...Located at the Marble Arch end , so well positioned for dropping off the shopping bags on a regular basis . Hotel itself has great rooms , well sized for London , very comfortable bedding and the staff at the Churchill are very willing to assist with any request . I would highly recommend The Churchill - Basically my favorite London Hotel.",5,2016,12,12
150,A hotel with a personal touch,"We checked in on 7 Dec at Room 715.  On 8 December night, I was robbed just right opposite of Hyatt Regency London The Churchill. Your Doorman came to my help when he realized the unfortunate incident happened, immediately alerted your security officer and your managers to assist me.  

All of them shown their care and concern and helped to call the police for me so that I can report the crime.  Your staff also offered to screen the CCTV to see if they can help to identify the thugs. 

The next day, your doorman checked on me to see if I was fine, and your assistant manager also called me to see if your hotel can do anything to help calm my nerves. 

From the Doorman, to the security officer, and the assistant manager, they have made my stay more comfortable despite the unfortunate event. 

This only affirms my trust in the Hyatt brand. And I will continue to support Hyatt whenever I can, especially in your hotel.  I want to thank your staff in showing your guests what hospitality is, and how to make your guests feel welcome.

From the bottom of my heart, a big THANK YOU.  I am checking out tomorrow and flying home, but it will not be the last time I stay with Hyatt. ",5,2016,12,12
150,Christmas shopping and dining,"The Churchill is in the heart of London, just a minute walk from Oxford street. A luxury hotel with a warm and friendly atmosphere.  Stayed in totally renewed rooms, quite large rooms compared to many other London Hotels. Service from arrival to departure. We will be back at the same hotel next London trip.",5,2016,12,11
150,Great hotel located ideally for central london and shopping ,"Don't the the fact that this is a Hyatt regency not a Hyatt grand brand or above interfere with the fact that this is a superbly located hotel offering high quality services.

The staff are very helpful and try to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.

Try churchills bar for probably the best espresso martini ever...",5,2016,12,11
150,one of my favorite London choices,"By London standards The Churchill is not overly expensive, by world standards The Churchill has excellent facilities, very nice Executive Lounge and impeccable staff service. One cannot expect much more.",5,2016,12,06
150,Great stay at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"This was our first visit to London as a couple and we're glad we stayed at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill! It was a great stay. The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. We were upgraded to a room that overlooked the small park in the quiet neighborhood. Rooms were good size, as well as bathrooms. Location is great for first-time visitors. Quiet area off the main shopping street (Oxford) and close walk to Hyde Park. Tube is close. Buckingham Palace is about a 1 mile walk. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London!",5,2016,12,06
150,Annual Mothers & Daughters Lunch,"I came the the Hyatt Regency for the first time Sunday 4th December with my mother and our group was made up of mothers and daughters as this is a tradition we have been doing for years (predating my birth!). I myself am a 25 year old and my grandmother is in her 80s, my point being this was an experience perfect for all ages.

Alan the manager came over to our table and was thoroughly charming, something he didn't have to do and was more than happy to do so. He wanted to check everything was just so and indeed it was. 

It was just a memorable and enjoyable experience and I cannot thank the staff more for such a lovely time. We do these lunches twice a year and will be back around Mother's Day time as we thought it was a second to none experience, having been to all manor of hotel's and top restaurants I can highly recommend the Hyatt Regency.

We also visited the beautiful terrace and bar, beautifully decorated for the winter festivities. 

Very rare to see such excellent service across the board. 

Five Stars. I will be back imminently

Sophie Cannon",5,2016,12,06
150,Another great stay.,This was our third stay in the last few years and it was excellent again. The location is perfect for Oxford Streetvand access to central London. The service at breakfast was top class as was the menu and the ambience in the lobby area by the fire was great. The gym is a bit small but that's only a minor niggle. Definitely our number one choice when we are in London. ,5,2016,12,05
150,Amazing Journey,"As usual Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill made our journey luxurioes and magnificent. Amazing hotel from all aspects and wonderful staff looks like you are at your home country. 
Perfect Location.. ",5,2016,12,04
150,Comfortable Stay,"My partner and I enjoyed our time at the Churchill - staff was solid though overwhelmed a bit at the front desk on check-in and check-out. Room was in the classic-style as is the hotel overall - very pleasant and quiet. Comfortable bed and bath. Club lounge was great for breakfast - just what we needed in the AM to get us started. One issue - an elevator - one of three - went out of service during our stay which caused quite the back-up several times. I'm not really sure the team at the hotel handled it as well as it should've been - no real mention made other than an ""out of service"" placard. Special kudos go to the bartenders/team at the Churchill Bar which was damn good the two times we visited. Great drinks and not totally out-of-control price-wise for a central London venue. I would suggest maybe the music be adjusted (kind of clubby when more up-tempo jazz may have been appropriate). We would definitely stay here again without a doubt.",4,2016,12,04
150,Good,"Nice stay- rooms were good and reasonable size for London. The club lounge is great and worth the extra price. The separate check in is very useful as it is a busy hotel. The hotel is well located and walking distance to Oxford Street. Service is fine although a tad impersonal.  The lounge is very busy. 
Pretty good stay though",4,2016,12,04
150,Excellent staff and support of elderly father,"Very supportive of my elderly father. Could not do enough for him.  Regency club staff very helpful.  Love the fire in the lobby. Good for west end but slightly
Further away from classic tourist attractions.  ",5,2016,12,01
150,The Churchill - a consistently good experience!,"The Staff at the Churchill really make the place a worthwhile and comfortable place to stay in London. ever courteous and professional, always going out of their way to assist you.In addition the property is centrally located close to Marleybone and Oxford Street",5,2016,12,01
150,A Mixed Bag,"Located only a block from busy Oxford Street, and about a 10-minute walk to the nearest tube station.  Many bars and restaurants located nearby, and I recommend the fine-dining Italian restaurant located in the same building.  However, as to the main hotel restaurant, the food was adequate, but the dining room is large, noisy, and low on comfort.  The service was very spotty and once we were charged for food and drinks we didn’t order.  A real disappointment was the fitness facility.  The size of two hotel rooms, dark, low-ceilinged, no music, and no atmosphere.  What’s worse, very limited facilities: some treadmills, stair climbers and dumbbells (no weight machines).  Some days they had water, towels and fruit, other days not.  Service was overall a mixed bag: we were told we would receive a call when our room was ready, but we never received one.  We were told twice about approximate travel distances to different locations, and both took almost twice as long.  We made requests for additional room items, but they came hours later.  On the other hand, some interactions were very pleasant, and at times the staff went above and beyond.  It’s certainly not a bad place, but unfortunately the many small negatives add up.",3,2016,11,30
150,Black Friday in London,Can't find fault with the Churchill one of the best value for money hotels in London one of the best location for shopping should be much high up TripAdvisor ratings having stayed in some of the best hotels in the city this one can't be beaten for value for money first class ,5,2016,11,29
150,Excellent stay,"Location is perfect-walkable distance to Hyde park,Kensington park, and Green Park, as well as shopping districts and two major museums! Great location for avid outdoor runners, and easily accessible to major shopping areas, and the Tube. Near Marble Arch",5,2016,11,29
150,Excellant Experience at The Churchill,"Hey There Hyatt Team,  I saw this survey come through and was genuinely excited to fill it out.  My wife and I got married at The Grand Hyatt in Kauai earlier this year decided to spend some time at another Hyatt location, this time The Churchill in London.  The entire experience with this property was delightful from the very start to the finish and I am not just saying that.  When we arrived off the red eye from New York, your front desk checked us in immediately and early, notwithstanding that my wife is 5 months pregnant.  The room was  solid and quite, despite our window opening up to a construction crew and their crane (rm.422) Your breakfast was one of the best I've had in Europe from a hotel chain and the staff was awesome.  The host, our waiter, and the manager were all very accommodating at some point during our stay (we ate breakfast everyday at your hotel)!  The staff at the bar were equally cool, particularly Daniella (Bartender, Male). Lastly, when I checked out, your front desk triple checked if I was supposed to get a 15% discount on our breakfasts (I wasn't but thought I was). All in all, it was an awesome experience and your staff crushed it.  In the age of social media, people are quick to yell and scream on Facebook or otherwise but it is important to recognize a great experience and a general ethos in the personnel you have chosen to employ.   Thanks for the great memories.  Adam & Kate",5,2016,11,28
150,Daniel,"I've been yesterday evening for a dinner,my sister is leaving soon London so I want something special for her,in the end we decide to have a dinner in restaurant,I just want to say everything was amazing,food was delicious,staff was just amazing,polite and the service was very quick.
Thank you for a special dinner,keep going like this,you're amazing!!",5,2016,11,27
150,Perfect stay for honeymoon,"Best customer service I had, the team made me and my husband feel welcome, and its the best hotels out of the five we stayed at throughout my stay in the UK. Well worth my honeymoon stay. Will definitely return again next time with my family!",5,2016,11,27
150,Excellent room and top-service,Very efficient and friendly check-in - much better than average Very nice furbished good-sized rooms with ample place to sit. Comfortable shower and bathroom (and heated toilet with water sprinkling system. Everything is about perfect.,5,2016,11,27
150,Great hotel for business stay,"This was my second stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill. The staff throughout the hotel are impeccable and always helpful. The meeting planning staff is very accomodating. We had some problems with our presentations, and they offered to let us use their laptop. Very close to shopping too.",5,2016,11,26
150,Best stay in London,"Convenient location to all the shopping stores.  Club lounge is one of the best lounges I have been to.  They are fully stocked and hours are 7am until 11pm which is rare.  They also separate two lounges one for business and one for families. There is a variety of food choices. Staff is professional, polite, and attentive.  Rooms are also super clean and furniture is up to date. The bathroom is also very spot clean, there's no rust or residue at all.  Absolutely love this Hyatt.  I recommend families to stay here as well! ",5,2016,11,26
150,So good....,"Having just arrived from across town while staying a few days at the Waldorf... the difference between the two properties is astounding.   This Hyatt claims to be a five star hotel.... and it totally lives up to that claim.

From a very friendly personal check-in to lightning fast in room internet to fantastic, over-the-top service even in the bar... this is a great hotel.

Beautiful room... even grander bathrooms complete with heated toilet seats and bidets... you will not regret choosing this Hotel.",5,2016,11,26
150,"Well located, and extremely comfortable-- what more can you ask for?","If you like shopping and being able to walk to most of the central tourist parts of London, then this hotel is ideal for you. You are two blocks from Oxford Street, which is London's main shopping street and are basically 2 min from the heart of the posh Mayfair neighborhood. The hotel rooms are updated and extremely comfortable with plush beds and great showers with potent water pressure (which is hard to find in Europe). The restaurants were excellent and the Club Floor was excellent as you had breakfast included every morning as well as peaceful place to have a drink or some coffee. This was my first time at this hotel, but I expect that it will not be my last.",5,2016,11,23
150,Hyatt Churchill London - a reason to visit London,"This hotel is the best and a sole reason to visit London. The hotel is fresh, clean, friendly, excellent service, superb food and an experience out of the world. It offers a variety of activities and they cater for all the different needs you may have",5,2016,11,23
150,Nice stay,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. location near attraction areas such as Hyde park, Edgware road, marble arch, oxford street, madam Tussauds museum. The tv has a good and lots of different channels for different nationalities.",4,2016,11,21
150,The perfect place to stay in London,"It might be a bit expencive, but it is totally worth it. This great place is close to oxford street and the underground and you are always taken care of. if you stay here, you will have to try the Tea Pot British Raj Mojito and the Churchill bar.",5,2016,11,21
150,Stayed for husbands 40th..amazing! Would stay again.,"This was just amazing, we stayed on Saturday night for my husbands 40th present and were treated brilliantly by all the staff. Valet parking was brilliant and they couldn't have helped us anymore. Hotel reception upgraded us to use the executive lounge which is highly recommended! We used this when we arrived, it opened at 5.30pm and we had wine, beer and bubbles with bread and cheese, grapes, smoked salmon but we had to stop or we wouldn't have made it out for our dinner reservation! The seating was lovely and there were a couple of sofas with a TV that you could make yourself very comfortable on! We used it again for breakfast the next morning which was a continental breakfast. Lovely. Our room was on the 6th floor, not a view of anything nice but lovely inside. They even sent up a bottle of prosecco and a cake for my husband! The toilet seat was heated and automatically came on in the morning! Little pleasures..There is a bar that we didn't use and another eating area with a piano which looked lovely. Also an outdoor seating area with throws on the chairs to keep warm. The location couldn't have been any better. Right next to Oxford Street.",5,2016,11,21
150,Excellent stay,"Excellent room, very friendly staff and great restaurants as well as perfect location in the city. Great breakfast buffe including a view of kitchen staff working. We had a great time in this great hotel, highly recommended.",5,2016,11,21
150,Good experience if a bit detached,"Stayed for two nights in this conveniently located and very comfortable hotel. Rooms on the Club Floor are well appointed and have everything you would expect from a good hotel. I can't really fault anything but also there is nothing memorable either. Excellent location if you want to shop on Oxford street. The staff were courteousand efficient but distant. Nothing wrong but lacking in warmth. 

",4,2016,11,19
150,Excellent Place to Stay in London,"From the unassuming building, located in the heart of London, one could not expect this comfortable gem in London.
The hotel was recently renovated and the rooms look sharp and fresh. The great breakfast buffet (pricey: 35 pounds pp)  is a good option if you have an early tour, since they start at 6:30AM, otherwise, there are several great options close to the hotel - try Daylesford. 
There is a small exercise room, but no spa or pool.
Overall a great option for London.",4,2016,11,17
150,Relaxed atmosphere,"Very good location, comfortable hotel with everything you need for both business and pleasure stay and very good staff. The outdoor area by the bar, cosy and chic. I liked this stay and I think I have found my London hotel.",5,2016,11,16
150,Not usual level of Hyatt servce,"Hotel décor and rooms good as ever, but what has happened to Hyatt service.  Staff did not want to be bothered, paid us no attention and were most off-hand - most unusual for Hyatt. Left waiting at check-in, told to come back later and queue again.  Made to feel that it was our fault that the staff member could not make himself understood in our own language in our home city. Shown to a table at breakfast and left forgotten, without menus or offers to take order for hot dishes.",3,2016,11,16
150,Great Stay in Novermber,"Flew in for a 2 night stay for business
Extended my stay for another 2 days. Got lots done.
Location was fantastic. 
Breakfast was great and the staff attending were on the mark!
Always someone at front desk to attend and all with positive attitudes. 
Room was updated and comfortable 
Housekeeping was excellent
Tv channel selection was ok
Internet was ok
Tea and coffee in lobby was nice. 
Always buzzing with people.
Outside winter sitting area was very nice with fur lined seats and warm service 

",5,2016,11,15
150,"Excellent location, comfortable room","I will stay in this hotel again if i am back to London. Easy access to most of the shopping and tourist spots. it is very close to Paddington station. if you take Heathrow Express to airport, this is the best choice.",5,2016,11,15
150,Great choice,"Wonderful location, nice and peaceful but close to Oxford St. Staff all extremely nice and efficient. Room was recently refurbished to an exceptional standard which was nice because to read about so many ""posh"" hotels having tired décor but this was definitely not the case. Very happy will come again. Value was pretty good - we booked direct with Hyatt",5,2016,11,15
150,Old-style subdued London glamour,"One of my favourites, and feels very comfortable to go back to. 

Stayed several times when we've had tickets to the Royal Albert Hall as it's near the bus stops to Kensington and the shops of Oxford Street for the morning after.

Relatively quiet location considering how central it is. Ducked an event at Home House so I could relax in the bar here instead.

Reserved, sophisticated decor - reminds me of a members club atmosphere.",5,2016,11,15
150,Anniversary ,"Excellent hotel, all staff kind and helpful. Stayed for our wedding anniversary upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite and given £70 to spend in hotel bars and restaurants, a very kind offer ,room was fantastic. ",5,2016,11,13
150,Excellent for shopping,"Located just 2 short blocks from Oxford St. the Hyatt Regency is a great place to stay if you plan to do a lot of shopping.  The service was excellent and everyone was helpful and friendly.  The room was nice and big.  We were a big group and some of our friends stayed at the lower floors which appeared to have been newly renovated.

Breakfast was excellent although quite crowded.  We had lounge access so the days we wanted quiet or were in a rush and didn't want to wait for a table, we would eat there instead.

If you can afford it,  stay here.",5,2016,11,11
150,SUPERB,This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Great location and facilities. The staff was more than attentive at all times. Great quality of food. The room has everything you could need although it could do with a nespresso coffee maker in the room. The bathroom is wonderful.,5,2016,11,11
150,Excellent Service,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency - Churchill as part of a group tour.  We had arrived in England early to take a side trip to York.  We were greeted warmly as our taxi arrived.  

Our luggage had not arrived with us (into Heathrow) and our arrangement with the airline was to deliver our bags to the Hyatt.   With a quick stop at the concierge desk, we determined that our bags had not arrived.  The concierge took our claim number and took charge of tracking down the bags and getting them delivered to our room the next morning.    They were also prompt to email me a copy of our bill when I needed it for the airline claim. 

The breakfast buffet had a variety of food.   Beverage service was generally prompt.   Since this was included in our tour, I cannot speak to value.

Comparing the hotel's dinner menu to their ""promenade"" menu, I found that I preferrred the lighter fare of the promenade menu.",5,2016,11,11
150,A Great Hotel at a Great Location,"Stayed at this wonderfully renovated hotel again. Service is top notch, friendly and warm. Everyone is very welcoming. I do recommend to book a Regency Club Room, the added value and amenities is worth the extra money.",5,2016,11,10
150,Unbelievably expensive drinks,"Met a friend in the Churchill bar. Was asked what I wanted to drink and asked for a glass of Prosecco which was not given by the glass so I changed to a 175ml glass of medium Rose. I recognised the bottle straight away so I knew it was going to be nice, we buy cases from France around 5 euros per bottle. Well the bill come when we had finished and the price of that drink was £19 plus service charge. Well Hyatt Regency I am going to report this to our trade and standard people as this is well overcharged and should be stopped.",1,2016,11,10
150,Must stay,"Fantastic hotel, not only location but the staff and great condition of the hotel. There wasn't one staff member who did not say hello and checked on me whenever in public areas. Housekeeping staff did very well as well. I love the bathroom amenities that are very rich and exclusive, would recommend and go back in the near future.",5,2016,11,09
150,Perfect extended weekend in London,Centrally located. Can walk to shopping and major sites. Minutes from Hyde Park. British museum 30 min walk. Very attentive staff. Quiet. Water in the room and gym. Upscale toiletries. Bed comfortable. Club lounge has long hours and is a nice place to relax. Breakfast gets busy but staff makes sure guests are comfortable. A nice Hyatt experience! ,5,2016,11,08
150,Frosty reception staff & general bad attitude!!!!,"I am not usually one to write a negative review but on this occasion I feel I have to as I was really quite shocked on the behaviour and attitude on a couple of the staff at this '5 star hotel'

My friend and I arrived on the 6th November 2016 for a 2 night stay which was booked as a suprise by my fioncee. When we went to check in we were served by Damaris a girl on the reception. She came across nice until we said the room had been booked by my fioncee - to which she seemed to have great pleasure in telling us 'oh there is no room guaranteed' we live 6 hours from London so at this point we started to panic , as my fioncee works and lives in Korea we could not get hold of him . 

Damaris then also said if I didn't pay the full £760 for the 2 nights on my debit card we would not have a room. Breakfast was also booked on the confirmation and but she boomed 'there is no breakfast & I will block the tv and wifi use & mini bar '

Lovely response from a 5 star hotel member of staff 🙄 

So we asked to speak to a manager - nobody came out and she went on the phone to someone and said 'oh she won't give me her credit card or email address' complete lies why even say that ?? The room should've been paid for with breakfast included and champagne & chocolate in the room. Neither happened. 
You'd think as my fioncee had been dealing with Laura personally from reservations they would've got everything sorted but they didn't. Terrible communications . 
So she begrudgingly gives us a room as it had 'just been cleaned' off we went to find no champagne or chocolate in the room (which had been pre paid for - £170) 

An hour and a half later the champagne appears (warm) 

So anyway we stayed the night had a good evening, and I went back to the night staff who were very friendly and could only apologise about our situation and I needed to speak to Laura from reservations who my fioncee had been dealing with. 

Initially she explained that yes she had been dealing with him and says that yes once she gets the pro forma and invoice to my fioncee I will be refunded the £1200 

Today is our check out date so before we got a taxi I thought I would pop in just to clarify the situation as I wasn't sure how the refund would work etc. She came out I asked the question she was nice as pie and to my complete disbelief when she walked off my friend and I both saw her roll her eyes at her colleague and make a catty face at towards us !!

I am furious ! What unprofessional and childlike behaviour ! If the hotel had communicated more clearly then I wouldn't have had to pay the £1200 it would have gone on my fioncees card as agreed !
So yes £1200 for 2 nights and I get some manager making faces at me because they made a mistake and their communication is poor. 

I just felt they look down their noses at you and can't really be bothered to come out and rectify issues. 

On a positive - the porters and the concierge , namely George & Ian . What absolute legends !! They are the faces you see when you enter the hotel which is a pretty good thing really since Damaris on reception is not a good first impression. 

So thank you George & Ian for looking after our bags while we went shopping and being true gents . You're a credit to that hotel . 

When we had our room cleaned there was a kit Kat on the side of the bed from the mini bar which probably cost me a fiver. When we came back to the hotel the kit Kat was gone and we certainly didn't eat it ! Anyway il leave it there as I can't be bothered to talk about this hotel . The little things make one huge thing ! 

I wasn't impressed and nobody speaks to me in that patronising way . Hopefully this will be approved . 

Until then I await my refund !!!",1,2016,11,08
150,Better than average but could be better,"The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. I thought the shower was a little old and poorly designed. 

The staff were all polite and helpful.

My main complaint would be incidental charges, specifically, their international phone rates. I made a 10 minute call to the U.S. and was initially charged more than 80 pounds ( which the hotel kindly reduced by 50% after further discussion ). According to the hotel, the rates are posted in the room but how could anyone reasonably expect that in this day and age, a telephone call to the U.S. would cost $10/minute. I think it is unexplainable and the hotel should use a different service provider to ensure better service and value to their customers.",4,2016,11,08
150,My new favorite in London!,"We just had a perfect stay at the Hyatt Regency The Churchill in London.  It was our first stay there and we loved the great location, close to Mayfair and the shops both in Oxford and  Bond Sts. We walked all over from there. Service was also perfect & beautiful. Room large with all details and amenities. TV with CNN and many other international channels. Very quiet and classic European --but with all the American modern things and attention to detail. Highly recommended.",5,2016,11,08
150,"A good hotel, but expected a great hotel!","I have stayed in The Churchill several times, and will stay there again.  However, something was missing this time.  If it not for their hard work and trying to make things right, they would have gotten 2 or 3 starts.  

It started from simple things like our TV didn't work, nor did the internet.  We were there during a school break and my daughter had homework.  They did fix the TV.  They kept telling us the internet was fixed, yet it never was.  When you are there for business with a teenager that needed to do her school work, that is a big deal.

The hotel was great and tried to apologize many ways.  All they had to do however, was fix the problem which they never did.  Being in the middle of first class hotels in London, I think that their service could have been a bit better and everything would work properly.  

We did enjoy our time there and appreciated how hard the staff tried to make our visit a good one.  However, it was very good, but not great.  With what I paid for the room it should have been great.",4,2016,11,03
150,Outstanding and Elegant,The rooms in this hotel are well appointed. The beds are extremely comfortable. The bathrooms have recently been updated and have wonderful heated commode seats. The staff is eager to assist and most courteous. I love this hotel.,5,2016,11,02
150,Regency Club is only way to go,"Had a suite with friends on 8th floor and also had access to the Regency Club - drinks all day long, nice breakfast spread, decent afternoon and evening snacks as well.
Location was ideal for getting around.
Service when checking in could have been better, they were confused, and they accidentally charged me when they weren't supposed too...",5,2016,11,01
150,Very disappointed,"I didn't expect too much since I've read many reviews. Nonetheless, the reality is even worse. Very slow and unstable Internet, no heating, and never say sorry for their mistake (almost charged another 280 GBP). Very disappointed and upset",2,2016,10,31
150,Excellent Stay at Hyatt,"Hyatt didn't disappoint. Our stay was June 2016.  The room size was decent given European standard. The breakfast included in our costco package was phenomenal - cold cuts, hot item, made to order.  The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful. I wish I got his name. He pointed us to a lot of local ethnic restaurants since we got tired of pub food very fast and made a big difference in our stay. I hesitated booking due to the renovation consruction going on at the hotel. However, we didn't see anything or near any noise, a total non-concern. It was a very nice stay though London traffic is pretty choking.",5,2016,10,31
150,Great staff and ideal location,"The Hyatt Regency's location is very central to a lot of key tourist attractions.  Many of them are easily within walking distance.  I would have to stay the staff here is top notch and very friendly.  During my stay I noticed the room we were given was facing Seymour street and across the street there is heavy construction going on.  That had me worried at first but then I noticed the Hyatt put in what appears to be sound proof windows.  I didn't have any issues sleeping and didn't even hear the noise outside.  The air conditioning and heating in the room is very quiet!  The room is dead quiet at night and perfect for sleeping.  Another great feature is their shower because it is so invigorating.  The toilet is a Toto with a built in bidet!  Loved that bidet lol.  The mirror is also anti-fogging.  Top notch all around.  I would like to give special notice to Scott as he was very helpful with us.  Scott was very professional and took care of us during our stay.  

Also, if you can swing the upgrade definitely opt in for the Hyatt Lounge on the 8th floor.  The staff there is wonderful and a delight to talk to.  During our stay we had the pleasure to talk to Asja, Cavin, Gita and Mr. Chu.  All of them were so friendly attentive to us.  It is a great place to grab a drink and read the paper.  It was never busy when we went up.",5,2016,10,30
150,Disappointing for a regular good customer,"This is probably my fifth stay, every year my company organizes its annual meeting and we bring good business for a whole week. Last year I was nicely upgraded to the highest floors.

Last week I was not, a few uneducated guests made some ruckus at 3AM and I could not even get a late check out for no reason. Go figures. 

Bottom line, it is well located, expensive, and overall service is quite good. But it's not my favorite place, just business.",4,2016,10,30
150,Needs better wifi,Internet services are unacceptably slow and they know it. Yet they don't warn you before staying there and not sure why the new provider can't be engaged ASAP. The rest of the hotel is grand and I enjoyed the stay otherwise,1,2016,10,28
150,"Nice hotel, easy to get to","The hotel is located in a nice area. Easy to walk to the tube (underground subway) and to restaurants. It is close to the park. The rooms are small, bathroom is small. We just slept there as our trip was short and we wanted to see the sites. Our room was on the 7th floor and overlooked construction outside. The concierge were great. They gave us terrific directions on how to get around.",3,2016,10,28
150,Good location,"Churchill Hyatt

We have stayed in a few Hyatt hotels over the world and can say that the hotel chain just seems to get it right. Rooms comfortable and well equipped. 

We had a room in the Regency Club so enjoyed pre theatre drinks and snacks. Breakfast was also in the clubroom and there was a good choice even for vegetarians! 

Nice and quiet throughout the night.

Very close to the shops on Oxford Street or you can stroll around Hyde Park.

Staff were very pleasant and helpful.",5,2016,10,28
150,Perfect stag,We came with our three boys for a tourist trip of london. The bedrooms were interconnecting and newly beautifully refurbished and lovely. Very quiet and tranquil. Staff were super attentive. We had a great time. ,5,2016,10,27
150,london,"short stop in London
great hotel, clean spacious rooms, nice staff.
excellent location
and the food
Montague go no further- great breakfast, brunch, dinner
Chief Carlo creates great stuff out there
and Churchill bar with nice drinks and cigars",5,2016,10,25
150,A memorable stay,"We were there 5 nights in 2 suites and the hotel made our stay a memorable one. The hotel is impecable, the rooms are very comfortable and the suites are a bit more spacious since they include a living room almost the same size of the bedroom. Ours had a balcony which oversaw the park across from the street. The staff was nothing but great, everyone treated us very well and all of our requests were promptly met. The Regency lounge serves breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres. The breakfast was very good and it included several choices from cereals, cold cuts, a variety of cheeses, different breads, juices, fruits, pastries and a full service espresso machine. In the evenings they serve a larger selection of roasted vegetables, cheeses, salads, wines and other spirits. An assortment of canapés are routinely passed around by waiters and some others are served with the rest of the food. My overall impression of the lounge was very good even considering we were there many days. We ordered coffee and tea from the waitresses and I was given my own tea pot every time. The hotel is well taken care of, there are no signs of aging or wear and tear to be found. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious, even the regular ones. We had a Nespresso machine and the pods were replaced daily. The bathrooms were large and included a walk-in shower and a bathtub, we had 2 robes and besides the regular toiletries we were also provided tooth brushes, toothpaste and other bathroom amenities. The one thing we found odd was that there are no power outlets in the bathrooms for the hairdryers but only in the bedroom or living room, which are inconvenient if a mirror is needed. The location is excellent. The hotel is nearby Baker St. and Edgeware Rd. Just a brisk walk away south oh Regen'ts Park and even closer to Marble Arch and Hyde Park. Plenty of bus lines and a tube stations are nearby as well. I sincerely recommend this hotel and am hoping to return very soon.",5,2016,10,25
150,My stay from 11/9/2016 to 14/9/2016,"Excellent hotel in an excellent location. Nicely renovated rooms, very comfortable. GP Diamond members get free breakfast at the club lounge only, not in the main restaurent. Good snacks during the day at the lounge but No proper afternoon tea in the lounge like other 5* hotels in London.",4,2016,10,25
150,Excellent,"Conveniently located so close to Oxford Street, Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Edgware road n Baker Street. Very comfortable and clean. Taxi stand right outside the hotel. Good breakfast. Would definitely return",5,2016,10,24
150,Wonderful Stay,"This was my second stay and wont be my last. From the minute you enter the hotel you feel the luxury. The Front Desk staff, the concierge, the restaurant staff and housekeeping all made the stay wonderful with their smile and assistance with all our needs.
The location is also excellent as the hotel is located just a few minutes walking to the shopping streets and some of the attractions.
I must admit that the suit is much bigger and nicer than the regular rooms as I stayed the first time in the suit but the second time was a regular room which was also comfortable and clean, the only complaint that the bed is too big for the size of the room.",5,2016,10,24
150,Great drama in the bar,"We stayed as a couple at the Churchill hotel as a short break in London before visiting our daughter. 

The hotel room was excellent with a view over Portman Square, a private park with tennis courts to which hotel guests have access (though we didn't visit) The hotel although very well located for shopping and the theatre was very quiet. 

My wife and I both slept well on a very comfortable bed and awoke convinced that we should change our mattress at home to the same make. 

The highlight of our stay was the excellent service we received from the hotel staff, especially in the Churchill Bar. The staff worked hard to provide a great atmosphere. For fans of drama I recommend the ""Never give in"" cocktail. It was developed by the bar staff, inspired by the life of Winston Churchill. Without giving too much away, If you like your cocktails presented with a sense of theatre it's the one for you.

I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2016,10,22
150,"convenient, quiet, like new","Newly refurbished throughout, lovely twin bedroom, bathroom with heated toilet seat (!), convenient restaurant, very nice service.  Very well located just steps from Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Oxford Street shopping.  Good aircon,TV (paid movie didn't work but refunded), very amiable room service.",5,2016,10,21
150,Perfection at every turn,"For those of you that say it doesn't matter what kind of hotel you stay in when you are traveling because you won't be in your room much?  I say you are wrong... when I travel l like to treat myself and the best way to do that in London is to stay at the Churchill. Conveniently located near 2 metro stops, lots of shopping, and next to a beautiful park, the interior is beautiful and well appointed.  Very quiet with no hall noise, a gorgeous bathroom, thick linens and comfy beds.  Breakfast was amazing every day.",5,2016,10,20
150,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"This hotel was one of my favorites in London.  The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and the guest rooms are large with unique bathrooms.  The hotel is quiet and tranquil.  The breakfast buffet has everything you could ever want, and the service was impeccable.  The concierge at the hotel went above and beyond for me and took a package to the post office for me, which saved me massive amounts of time.  The front desk was also a delight.  I would stay here again and again.",5,2016,10,20
150,Attentive staff and a great hotel!,Suite was great although it feels a bit dated. The location is fantastic with most things available at a walking distance. The staff were great and attentive. The lounge was nice and quiet and the food was not bad.,5,2016,10,19
150,Quick Stay in London,"I had to get a hotel last minute in London, and the Churchill was perfectly located for my needs.  It is more a business hotel, whereas I usually stay in luxury or boutique hotls, but it was very nice, comfortable beds, and good size room.  The staff was very friendly and nice.  They even go my passport to me at the Train Station when I realized I had left it in the safe.  Great experience at the hotel.",5,2016,10,19
150,Vacation,The location is fantastic. Very comfortable rooms and the staff are very helpful. They made the experience memorable because of the comforts. We always returned to cleaned rooms after every day of shopping. ,5,2016,10,18
150,"Great staff, lovely hotel",Lovely hotel in the marble arch area. Just a five minute walk from the tube or bus area near Selfridges. Breakfast was very good and Staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating even though it was busy. We requested shower only and were given one of the newly renovated rooms. Shower stall is the length of the bathroom and nice rain shower head. Concierge staff always available and informative.,5,2016,10,18
150,Standard slightly slipped,"I love the Churchill, dont get me wrong.  I have reviewed it before and could not say enough in its favour.  It has recently had a refit and I do not find it as Appealing as before, although still good.  The foyer an restaurant and bar are little different - still welcoming with excellent food.  The art from the Saatchi Gallery has been changed and is insipid when compared to the previous works displayed.  This is a shame.  The second thing I noticed was that the new carpet in the corridors and rooms seems to stain easily.  Several times I saw staff trying to clean stains but with little success. My room also smelt of some kind of masking spray which made me sneeze.  Thankfully I could open the windows to some extent.  I found the room too hot initially but the temperature control was excellent. Staff, were very pleasant, helpful and yet not intrusive.  My experience booking a late check out was initially frustrating but quickly corrected by a hotel manager.  I will certainly stay again and given the weeks accumulated experience I have had with this truly excellent hotel, I think this latest problem was a mere glip.",4,2016,10,18
150,Churchill Was Amazing,Location and amenities and food... totally enjoyable.  Would strongly consider coming back to this hotel in the future.  We were blown away at the hotel room's cleanliness and how well appointed it was.  Updated and beautiful.  The daily breakfast was worth getting up for every day.  We loved this hotel and it was a great place to relax and unwind after a full day of site seeing.,5,2016,10,17
150,Great London location,"I recently stayed at the Churchill Hotel in London for some business meetings.  I travel a considerable amount and found the experience there to be simply outstanding in every way.  The staff hospitality was above average, the amenities superb and I would recommend and utilize this hotel again with no hesitation.",5,2016,10,17
150,Great location pity about the noise.,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in mid October as a treat for my birthday. On an overall basis I would recommend the hotel. The room was spacious and well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. My only negative was the noise that awoke me at 2.30am on the first night which seemed like someone was using a drill or electric saw. 

The hotel is convenient to Oxford street, Regent street and Piccadilly so is ideal for shopping trips.",4,2016,10,17
150,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional helpful staff, especially at the club lounge and concierge. We visited the concierge every day with questions - since it was our first visit to London - they were patient and informative.  The staff in club lounge were the best I've ever seen!",5,2016,10,15
150,More than a regular 5 star hotel of London.,"Congratulation to the boss of this hotel for organising such regime to perfection. Yes, everything is perfect in the hotel. The recently refurbished room we had was perfect and and the best breakfast you can ask for. Breakfast is very busy and we had to wait to get our table every morning but that was no problem. They have several types of cheeses, olives, arabic beans, freshly cooked eggs and good quality hams. We just think that the staff of breakfast are better than the night time dinner. 

If one thing I would ask to be changed is the attitude of the Polish lady responsible of the dinner and her assistant and the way she presents herself to the table with weird body language. While I was looking at my phone, approaching my wife and saying in her ear  ""you look very bored""!!! This is not getting on the good side of my wife and makes you look like an intruder with the wrong perception. Beside that, that is not something you want to say to someone that is paying £350 a night and is at your restaurant to spend money and leave 20% tip.

We have been to London many many times and the last two times we stayed at the Dorchester and of course loved it but let me say that this visit and this Hyatt is almost as good for half the price of Dorchester and with a better location even.

See you soon again.",5,2016,10,13
150,So quiet.,"Nice part of London, handy for a good number of attractions and despite being in London, because it's on Portman square and the extremely effective sound insulation, no traffic noise at all in the room.
The only downside was no black pudding on the breakfast menu.;-)",5,2016,10,13
150,Churchill Hyatt London,"Excellent stay in a Regency Suite on 9th floor , loved the regency club , all the staff were nice and polite. Great location right off  Oxford St close to Central line Tube stations and  eating places. Utilize Portman Square gardens via the key from Concierge for a bit of peace and quiet ina garden",5,2016,10,13
150,Great stay - even better breakfast!,"We stayed a few nights and enjoyed both the original and updated rooms due to an unexpected extension of stay. The rooms are big, clean and hallway noise wasn't a problem. What's best about this hotel is the delicious options at the restaurant every morning. Beautiful settings. Great plentiful coffee. Daily loaf of sweet bread. Terrific service!  Couldn't stop myself from the daily helping of fresh breads and cheeses. Looking forward to returning!",5,2016,10,12
150,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel was very nice and the service was absolutely amazing' the people are really nice!
The location is very good' right next to Oxford street which was fantastic.
I really do recommend this hotel!",4,2016,10,11
150,Loved the accommodations and the location!,"England is a very clean, safe country and there truly was not enough time in a week to see everything in London!  I would definitely come back very soon and stay at this same hotel again.  As a weary traveler I welcomed the excellent service, food, wine and the security of the hotel staff!  There is a reason this is a 5 star hotel and the old cliche you get what you pay for is very apropos here. Kudos to the Hyattt Churchill!",5,2016,10,11
150,Really Nice Hotel,We stayed here for 1 night and the hotel was full so I was upgraded to an executive suite.  It was large with 2 bathrooms a bedroom and a large living room.  The room had 2 separate entrances.  Anyway I did not get a chance to check out the restaurant because I left early but this place was off the hook.,5,2016,10,11
150,We loved it but it has no swimming pool,The staff was nice and  friendly.  The hotel was very nice.  Not much bad to say except the following:  1.  We did not have a bath tub in our room.  2.  There was only instant coffee in the room. 3.  No pool.,5,2016,10,10
150,Stay in London,We went to London on a girl trip for shopping and sight seeing. We had a wounderfull time at The Churchill Hotel. Rooms are nice and clean and the staff are very helpful. The breakfast was ok and the Club lounge a great place to stay when waiting for the others to get ready. We will certainly come again. Thank you!,4,2016,10,10
150,Nicest hotel in London,"The rooms are spacious and recently remodeled. Very nice and comfortable. Staff was great. Workout room is nice and had complementary water and fruit available...nice feature. It's more expensive than you would pay for other rooms but I fully believe you get what you pay for...this hotel was worth it!  Great location...shopping and tube access. Love the Churchill bar..very cool vibe and decor. 

Cons:  doors slam when closing' mirrors are not close to outlets for blow drying/curling hair; not a lot of options for breakfast unless you order the entire bar but who needs that much food. ",5,2016,10,09
150,Extremely happy!,"My partner and I chose this hotel for our week in London.
We picked a room with access to the lounge, which put us in a high floor next to two lounges where we could have a drink and a snack at any time.
We received an excellent service, we would like to thank in particular the Italian waiters who were always very cute.
The breakfast is excellent, even if in a crowded and a bit noisy hall.
The room was very spacious. 
Since I had a birthday, I found twice a bottle of prosecco in my room as a surprise.
The location is five minutes from Oxford street, near Selfridge.
If you have a high budget, this is one of the best options in London.",5,2016,10,09
150,Good hotel and very good location,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel on our son's recommendation. 
The rooms are very comfortable and clean with excellent beds.  Great location within walking distance of Oxford St.  
I would definitely come back, but there are a couple of things that were quite disappointing. Breakfast is pricey and the coffee leaves much to be desired.  The concierge booked theatre tickets and failed to mention, when we asked the price per ticket, that the booking fee was an outrageous 20 pounds each. ",4,2016,10,09
150,My fav hotel #best hotel in London,Love the Churchill. Excellent location. Steps away from Oxford street and Marble Arch and yet in a quiet setting facing Portland Square park. The rooms are fabulous. Nice size rooms with comfortable beds. Friendly warm and welcoming staff making one feel like it's home away from home. #Best hotel in London.,5,2016,10,07
150,The worst customer service ever!!,"This is my 3rd time this year to visit London, and it was a short trip ""5 days only"" and wanted to try new hotel for a change so I stayed at Hyatt Regency The Churchill because my friend who stays there alot recommend the hotel for me! will start with the things I like: Location in Portman Square is good, quiet, and so close to Oxford St and many shops and restaurants, my rooms was the king view, decent size and good amenities, bathroom was ok but I prefer walk in shower and there was only a tub.
My problem wasnt with location, noise, or the room .. It was the staff! When I arrived there was no door-man to take my luggages, the frontdesk didnt ask me what I prefer and when I told him its my 1st time he didnt bother to tell me about the hotel facilities, rooms or restaurants! he just gave me the key without even showing me how to use it to open an elevator, no-one walked me to my room or show me the things I need to find in my room (since its my 1st time there!) .. for 5 days I had an issue with my room card it wasnt working for the elevator and I told almost all the staff and none of them offered to solve the problem by changing or just refresh the card in system!
Doormen are not welcoming I go in and out all day and they dont notice me they are just busy with guests they already know :)
as new guest there I didnt feel I was welcome there at all!
What really bothered me the most is the late check out, they said hotel was OVER booked so I have to leave the room 12 pm and I did, when I left to spend my last day in London I noticed that they moved my luggages OUTSIDE the hotel!!!!! even if they were busy to store them why they drag them all the way out! instead they can just keep inside .. and I tried to talk to the manager many times about the check out but he/she didnt want to meet me and told the staff that they dont agree onclate check out, but later I noticed alot of guests checking out after 5 pm!
Super rude? unprofessional? Im so disappointed that this was a 5 stars hotel service .. I will never go back to them or recommend them to any of my friends!",2,2016,10,06
150,disappointing stay,"We arrived in London after being spoiled by a lovely stay in Paris.  The Churchill has its bits of glam and luxe when you first walk up to the entrance. There's typically a bold colored Lamborghini or line of Range Rovers parked outside.  The lobby was buzzing with guests when we first arrived.  I wasn't really impressed because we were shuffled around by the staff and guests.  Given the price per night I was expecting more glam from this hotel since the interior of the hotel was very dull looking.  Our room was small, the bathroom was small.  It was exactly like a big name hotel lacking in details and personal touches, which is why I always prefer boutique hotels.  Being a club member we had access to their lounge area where they offered complimentary breakfast and afternoon snacks.  I wasn't impressed at all with their offering.  Everything was sub-par from the scrambled eggs that lacked seasoning to raw discolored salmon to pancakes that came straight out of a mixing pack. We found a macaroon stuck to the ceiling for two days, which made me wonder how thorough was the cleaning staff.  The hotel is located in the heart of the city but I wouldn't stay here again.  It's definitely not worth the price.",3,2016,10,05
150,Great hotel,A trully Great hotel with fantastic and large rooms which are Nice decorated. The staff is quite friendy too and breakfest is also very good. In general i world say it is a good five estar hotel in a large metrópole. The best part. of it. is nonetheless the location.,5,2016,10,05
150,Excellent hotel in the heart of London,"I spent 3 nights at the ""Churchhill"" and would recommend this hotel. Location is great, and more importantly, service was excellent. My room is comfortable, though the bath hub/shower is a little small. There may be less expensive accommodation, but I'd say this one is worth it.",5,2016,10,05
150,"Fantastic Location, Excellent Accommodations","A very conveniently located, well-appointed hotel. Great service all around. Excellent, welcoming staff. Overlooks Portman Square. Within walking distance of great shopping on Regent, Oxford, Bond Street, etc. Right behind Selfridges.",5,2016,10,04
150,3 Night Weekend But......,"My Wife and I had a 3 night weekend which was generally enjoyable. The recent refurbishment is pretty much complete and the room and communal areas are very good but no car parking and the Wifi is a bit hit and miss.

The location is suburb, great to get to almost anywhere and just far enough from the hustle and bustle of Oxford St. less than a 5 min walk for Marble Arch Tube.

The Staff are generally excellent  but my Wife, who traveled in a different flight, did experience some difficulty checking in given the booking was in my name and the receptionist could not find the E Mail I had sent advising this would be the case. Unfortunately this difficulty translated into my Wife not being in the best of moods when I arrived and, given it was her Birthday that day, meant I had a little work to do.

We stayed on the Club levels and I did find the Lounge could get very crowded and the breakfast buffet was a little limited. We didnt try to have a breakfast on the ground floor as there was always a queue for a table when we looked.

In general a very good hotel but the weekend we were there it was very busy and showed a few signs of being a little strained. That said having stayed in most of the high end offerings nearby it would still be higher up on my list than most.

Would we return, yes.",4,2016,10,04
150,"Great Location, Quiet Location just off a busy street, Shopping Heaven!",This hotel is tucked away just behind Bond street. Breakfast spread is minimal but quality is at its best. We opted to pay the service fee and have the breakfast in bed which was a good touch. Rooms had double glazed windows so street noise wasn't an issue. Very close proximity to the London Underground and perfect location to shop and visit local tourist spots. Front desk staff are attentive and knowledgeable. Housekeeping is top notch too.,5,2016,10,04
150,Beautiful Hotel with great people,We had a wonderful time. Everyone there puts you on the top of their priority to make happy. The Regency club staff are the best. There is easy access to the Metro. Concierge got us to the right places on time.,5,2016,10,03
150,Perfect,This hotel couldn't have been better. We came for a long weekend and its in a great position. its in walking distance from oxford street which was perfect for us. The staff are very friendly and the rooms spacious and clean. We have already booked our next trip back. Highly recommended.,5,2016,10,02
150,"Good hotel, centrally located.","I just spent a week at The Churchill, and I had a very good stay. The room was spacious, particularly for London, and very quiet and clean. Bed was extremely comfortable. Room service delivery was amazingly fast. Special kudos to Domenico, the weekday morning waiter. Very pleasant, upbeat fellow. 
My one complaint is the wi-fi, or lack thereof. It was spotty and then non-existent. I was assured the entire hotel will get new wi-fi  services in the next few months. I was burning through my own roaming hotspot hours, when they offered me a hotspot to connect at their expense...on Day Four. When the only reason you are at a hotel is to work, the wi-fi has to function, and if it is not working, an alternative must be found. One night, I actually had to spend 30+ minutes on the phone with one of their remote tech support staff as they tried to reboot my room.  The guest services person who gave me the dongle said they only had a few and they were all in use, so that's why I wasn't offered one until Day Four. While I received lots of sincere apologies, that's it. Most good hotels would make some sort of gesture of apology. Maybe knock off some room service or send some fruit. It doesn't have to be much.
All of that aside, I would stay again, after they get new wi-fi. Everything else about the hotel was great.vstaff super pleasant and the location is superb for getting around town.",4,2016,10,02
150,Great Hotel,"Very centrally located, the hotel itself is very nice.  Rooms great.  The service very good.  Everyone I dealt with was attentive and friendly.  If you are flying into Heathrow, take the Heathrow express to Paddington then a black taxi over to hotel, very quick ride and smooth.  Will be back to your place.  Full disclosure I did not pay for my 2 nights because I had the Hyatt Passport deal.  But again, this hotel is worth coming back too.  Excellent.",5,2016,10,01

150,Superlative Service at the Hyatt Regency Churchill!,The Hyatt team at the Churchill was very attentive and went the extra mile with welcome treats in my room and overall excellent service.  The 8th floor lounge is welcoming and the staff is quick to take care of all the guests.  The rooms are very well appointed.,5,2016,09,30
150,Great place to stay in central London,"Welcoming, friendly and professional staff! Attentive and consistent. Staff remember your name and go out of their way to assist you. Couldn't ask for more. Property is well appointed and well located",5,2016,09,29
150,Best this year,"As far as business meeting venues go, this was the best hotel of the year so far! As you would expect from the Hyatt group, maybe, but in central London, the staff can sometimes be a little 'distracted'... not so The Churchill, all the staff milling around the ground floor reception and restaurant area always look guests in the eye and greet them warmly, the food in the meeting room was excellent, in flavour, presentation and variety. Rooms are not as spacious as you may find in US Hyatt hotels, (but this is central London!), but the beds are very comfortable. The gym could do with being twice as big and have someone keep an eye to ensure all the equipment is working!",4,2016,09,29
150,Wonderful stay,"A perfect position for a weekend break in London.
Near the shops , bars and restaurants , (although the hotel's restaurant and bar are great).
We spent the morning at the Wallace Collection which is a short walk away.
Spend the extra and have a 'club '
room. The pre dinner drinks and canapés were delightful and complimentary .
The service throughout our stay was excellent.

150,Alan Cook at the Churchill Bar & Terrace is Spectacular!,"I stayed at the Churchill for a friend's wedding recently, and while my stay in general was fabulous, I have to specifically highlight the masterful service I and my friends received from Alan Cook.  As the Manager of the Churchill Bar & Terrace, he does the hotel a GREAT service by acting as an upmost professional.  Alan paid careful to our every need  - I simply cannot say enough positive things about all that Alan did to ensure that my friends' wedding was perfect!",5,2016,09,27
150,Great Hotel Stay,Excellent service from all members of staff.   This is a most stylish and impressive hotel.   The location is ideal since it is located a short few minutes walk from Marble Arch.  We had a wonderful time staying at the Hotel!,5,2016,09,27
150,Central London perfect location,"Near the underground, best shopping short walk , Hyde Park, St James Park and Regent's Park very close very good location.  Great restaurants and pubs nearby. Downside no car parking at time of our visit and a little expensive for a stay but competitive for the location",5,2016,09,27
150,"Beautiful, Quiet Hotel","A beautifully remodeled hotel with very quiet rooms and helpful staff.  Also a great location, an easy walk to London's many transportation options and retail opportunities.  A nice overall experience and we would definitely choose it again.",5,2016,09,26
150,Lovely rooms and great staff,"New and renovated hotel, very nice,clean.
Amazing and polite staff.
Perfect location,right downtown next to my favorite Hyde park.
Unfortunately no swimming pool and spa area. Every 5 star hotel should have it but this Hyatt does not.",5,2016,09,26
150,Wonderful staff!,"the staff were friendly, helpful and we really appreciated their remembering us from previous stays. The Regency lounge was a great place to relax and have breakfast & snacks. Our bed was super comfortable and our room was large and quiet.",5,2016,09,26
150,A great stay!,"Lovely hotel! Staff are very friendly and the atmosphere, cleanliness, and food are all worthy of their 5 stars.

We stayed for a birthday, and reception acknowledged this along with amenities in our room.

We had a drink in The Churchill Bar and ate at The Montagu (dinner and breakfast) and it was all wonderful, both food and service. 

The hotel is in a good area and although they don't provide parking there is a car park just a few minutes' walk away. ",5,2016,09,25
150,"Nice hotel, centrally located","We stayed at the Hyatt for our vacation in London. The staff was very courteous and helpful. When we arrived, the room was not ready but we left our bags there, walked around a bit and they called us soon after that it was ready.
The room was clean with everything we needed. I had read reviews about how small the rooms were in London but this was spacious. I think they said we were in one of the newly renovated rooms.
It was my birthday celebration and they even surprised us the first night with champagne, fruit & cake and a lovely birthday note! We liked the location too. Right in the heart of London with plenty of restaurants, shopping and close to the Underground and buses. The view from our room was not great as there was construction going on but we didn't hear any loud noises at all. It would have been nice to have a breakfast option there but the buffet wasn't included with our room and when we asked to go in, they said they would have to charge us about £30/person which we thought was outrageous so we opted to find other places in the area. But I would definitely recommend and would consider staying there again.",4,2016,09,23
150,Comfortable and convenient,"We stayed 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency Churchill hotel on an extended layover, on a recent trip to Edinburgh Scotland. The hotel is conveniently located, about 1.5 miles from Paddington Station (Heathrow Express) as well as about 1.5 miles from Euston Station (Virgin Trains to Edinburgh). The hotel was modern and clean.

Biggest complaint is the cost of breakfast. We stay in London hotels frequently, as we typically will visit for 2-3 nights during extended layovers between US and European destinations. The challenge with this hotel is the very expensive breakfast relative to other hotels we stay at. I mean about 2 x the cost of breakfast in comparable hotels in central London.

The high cost of breakfast is probably because they can charge it. Nearly all of the guests at this hotel seem to be from the Middle East.  They probably don't mind GBP 30 per person for breakfast as it may seem quite cheap to them?  And since the hotel can charge it, clearly they do.

Our next visit will be to the nearby Hilton, as breakfast is much more affordable.

I would say that the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Although they did seem a bit under-staffed. It was generally an extended wait at the front desk for check in / check out.  And even though we arrived later than check-in time, we still had to wait nearly an hour for a room to become available. We found out the hotel was over-booked.",4,2016,09,23
150,"Comfortable stay, conveniently located","We stayed at this Hyatt September 16-20.  Our 8th floor room was spotless and comfortable.  We were in 816 and had complete silence.  The concierge, housekeeping, the lounge staff were all attentive and helpful without being intrusive.  
    We waited an hour for our room to be ready, but as we were had book a room on the concierge floor we were able to wait there and enjoy some refreshments in a comfortable setting.  I highly recommend spending the extra money for a room on a club floor.  The lounge is open until 11 pm.  Breakfast is 7-11 and is plenty to start the day--eggs, pastries, coffee, tea, vegetables, cheese, cold cuts.  Soft drinks, water, and snacks always available while lounge is open.  Wine and hors d'oeuvres from 5:30-7:30.  There is a separate lounge for adults only, which is nice if you are traveling without children as we were.   
    The location is right near pubs, restaurants, shopping, tour buses, and the marble arch. 
     The hotel restaurant was good, but not quite up to the prices. 
     Overall, I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2016,09,22
150,Staff Staff Staff,"The hotel was beautiful, the location outstanding, the facilities great. But the people who worked there were fantastic and enhanced the experience. Principally the people at valet, concierge, and Claudia in the bar. Overall this was a great experience and I fully intend to return. BTW: even though it was 22 pounds, the continental breakfast was filling and a lot and just what I needed when trying to shake off jetlag and prepare for a public speaking engagement.",5,2016,09,22
150,excellent in london,great hotel.recommend to anyone who is in London on business or pleasure. Staff is well trained and they know how to treat their guests. rooms are very spacious and the food and beverage outstanding. gREAT!,5,2016,09,21
150,WONDERFUL,"We had a great stay at this hotel, everything was clean and looked brand new, I believe the room we had was 3 months old! The toilet seat was heated and had a bidet! Staff was nice and accommodating. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting London.",5,2016,09,21
150,Great location for shopping,"Great location, very nicely refurbed - cleaning could be slightly improved especially in the public toilet areas that perhaps need checking more frequently. 
The rooms are a reasonable size and nicely decorated - good service 
Shame about the restaurant the less said about that the better !",4,2016,09,19
150,Luxury service and setting,"This hotel could do no wrong. It's centrally located, service is impeccable and rooms are clean, quiet and convenient. Stay on the club floors for extra luxury. There you can enjoy a great breakfast of homemade breads, smoked salmon, gourmet cheeses, fruits, granola and daily hot foods. The canapé hour is likewise generous, with beer, wine, prosecco, and some liquors at your disposal. Snacks include salmon, cheeses, breads and specially prepared canapes which change each day. One could eat dinner from the canapé hour. The service is flawless, at every level. Rooms provide toiletries, an iron, robes, slippers, hair dryer, bottled water, good WiFi. See channel 72 for movies in English even though it's an Arabic channel. Down the street is the biggest shopping street of perhaps all of Europe. Prepare for crowds there. Or just enjoy your fabulous room!",5,2016,09,18
150,"nice hotel, didn't fix a problem with my room","Only one problem, and nobody addressed it.  When the AC fan came on, there was a disgusting stink, like stagnant water.  This was brought to the staff attention twice, The location is perfect, the breakfast is great, the personnel are nice, just wish they would address my issue.",3,2016,09,18
150,A perfect hotel ,"It is a third time I stayed in this hotel. Just in the central part of the town and close to the shopping streets it is very convenient. The hotel is clear, the services are good, it is clean, with good working wi-fi and perfect breakfast. The rooms are large enough.",5,2016,09,18
150,Par excellence,"A beautiful hotel, wonderful staff and great food and wine. From start to finish, I heartily recommend this hotel. The breakfasts were extensive and served in a pleasant atmosphere. The room was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. A great place to feel pampered while in the midst of business meetings.",5,2016,09,17
150,It's ok. Not great,"This was my first stay at the Churchill. (I usually stay in a hotel in Knightsbridge.)

So, the front desk was formal and polite, but not particularly helpful. My mom arrived before me and was going to share the room with me. However, they didn't let her check in because the reservation was not under her name. They also didn't bother trying to help her reach our travel agent who could have confirmed. They also did not help her in getting wifi in the lobby. (She ended up going to a neighboring hotel to get wifi...)

The rooms are small as is the bathroom but pretty clean. 

On our first day, our room was not cleaned until the late afternoon and only after I called housekeeping. 

I tried their room service for dinner. The salade nicoise was mediocre at best. The fish was a bit over salted. 

The buffet was good. The breads were fresh and the staff was actually very friendly and helpful. 

The porters too are quite friendly and helpful. 

The area is great and within walking distance to many relevant places. 

Overall, I would not come back to this hotel, but it's not horrible. ",3,2016,09,16
150,Disappointing ,"As a Hyatt Gold Passport member we stayed at the Hyatt Regency-The Churchill for four nights. The room itself was very nice and was at the level we expected.  The room location however was a major disappointment.  We were on the second floor with probably the worst view in the entire hotel...of roof tops and air vents.  I have to believe that because we were not ""paying"" customers we were placed in the least desirable room.  I feel that this is exactly opposite of what a ""loyalty reward program"" should be.  Additionally, the entire time of our stay either one or two of the total of three elevators were out of service and lead to long delays waiting for elevator service.  To top that off, they had no stairway access other than emergency fire exits.  The one time we used the stairs we had a lengthy exploration through work areas before reaching the lobby.

They only have one restaurant with very pricey limited menu selections.  Both breakfasts we ate there, we were shuffled off to the bar area since we did not purchase the expensive breakfast buffet.  

I will say the room cleaning people were very friendly and helpful.  Given another trip to London I would not stay here.  We are both Marriott and Hilton loyalty program members as well and feel that they do much more to treat there members better.

Overall very expensive and in our opinion not worth it.",2,2016,09,14
150,Worth a try and value for the money,"Upgrade to a suite ? Expensive london ? Once a while, I think it is worth it. 

London always give me an impression with hotel is either very classic old like 1900 century or using the old bath tub that something belongs to an older generation which modern hotels don't - or not even exist. Hyatt Churchill gives me some feeling of old meeting new after the new renovated rooms putting in. For business travellers, it has Hyatt club lounge, business plan and nice attentive staff and for elite members, they always accommodate me even i arrive very early in the morning due to overnight flights. Once they have someone checking out, they will try to make my rooms ready so that I can take a shower after a long haul flight, have some hot breakfast and get to work or meetings. It is reliable, value for money and great service hotel. Recently, I upgrade using my Hyatt membership to a suite which I found very great for value. It is great extra value of spacious room, balcony and corner room, what's more, lounge access and great evening Happy Hours cocktails.  Sometime, staying hotel longer after work is better than going out bars for Happy Hours, isn't it ?",4,2016,09,14
150,Great location,"Very close to the famous shopping area, near to Marble Arch tube st., staffs are friendly especially the doormen, but during my visit there was a renovation although it didn't cause me any problem as I always away during day, when I come back in the evening the activity was just stopped so it didn't interrupt sleep",4,2016,09,14
150,Nice hotel,We visited the Hyatt and were staying in an excecutive suite. It was absolutely lovely. Nice big spacious rooms. Quiet. Lovely bathroom amenities & comfy beds. Attentive staff and the Montaque restaurant serves a lovely breakfast. Also the canapees & drinks in business lounge were very highly rated by us!! Enjoyed the nespresso machine in the room & the sweets. Our baby daughter had a cot in room incl baby toiletries. Would definitely stay again. ,4,2016,09,13
150,10-star rating on a scale of 5 !!!,"Newly renovated rooms.   Very clean.  A compimentary plateful of fruits delivered to our room was such a warm welcome.  Johnny at the reception is very helpful and accommodating.  Hotel is very conveniently located.  Near train station and close to restaurants.  Hyde Park is closed by.  Just like any European Hyatt Hotels, this hotel brand never disappointed me.  Although one thing they missed this time….our coffee mugs in our room were not washed, somehow, the hotel staff put them back in place without washing them :(   Overall, despite this one flaw, I still give this hotel a super 10-stars on a scale of 5.  :)",5,2016,09,13
150,Reliable business hotel with great service.,"While this area is not one of my favourite parts of London given the close proximity to Oxford Street and the general commercial fervour, this hotel is a pleasant oasis.  The room was pretty functional and homogenous, but the service is wonderful.  From the free coffee in the lobby every morning as you are rushing out, to the lovely and attentive porters, it's not a bad place to come home to at the end of the day.  I am not giving five stars as there are no bicycle helmets available to borrow or rent, which I think all 4*/5* London hotels should provide given the prolific Santander bikes.",4,2016,09,13
150,Busy hotel,"This hotel is both good and bad. 

I stayed here 3-4 years ago, and I remembered why it was so long ago. 

The good - the room it's been renovated since I've been here last. It's a pretty standard 5 star room, it has everything you need, the shower is good, the beds and pillows are comfy. (TV a bit average good channel selections but no HD channels which is pretty bad). 

The bad - hotel is way too busy! Check in took forever, lifts takes forever (generally 3-5 minutes wait during the day), breakfast seems understaffed, have to wait to have breakfast? It just means the room is not big enough to handle the number of occupants. 

People just hanging in the lobby, which I don't really like, they're all waiting for people. 

poor wifi reception in room as well. ",3,2016,09,12
150,Read this before you book,"We are on a 2 week tour of Europe and have been staying at 4-5 star hotels. This hotel is very nice, 4-5 stars and the staff is excellent, but the hotel is 90% full of very wealthy looking  Arabs who are very rude, pushy, and demanding.  The staff has to spend much of there time catering to this group and it was a bit frustrating.  They also let there kids run free in the hallways and in the restaurant so very noisy and distracting.  But other than that rooms and food is great.",4,2016,09,12
150,"Best location, service and facilities in Central London!","We had a fabulous stay and highly recommend this hotel, well suited for business or pleasure trips in London.  The location is impeccable, for purposes of shopping, sightseeing and especially eating.  We felt so fortunate to be nearby to so many terrific restaurants and had a very special and different dinner every night of our trip in walking distance to the hotel.  The location really can’t be beat.  In this regard, the concierges were extremely helpful, in selecting places for us to go based on our detailed requests.  We quite enjoyed the Montagu restaurant in the hotel, the Michelin star Italian restaurant and, notably, The Churchill Bar, which was so terrific we are reviewing it separately.  Do not miss drinks in the Churchill Bar especially if you enjoy great cocktails!

Our rooms were modern, very functional and overall terrific.  The best part of the property though was the staff who went out of their way to help us numerous times.  There was just great attention to detail.  Let me give you one small example that sort of blew me away.  We came into the hotel following two weeks in Austria and Italy, and I had precisely two dress shirts, both of which had some butter spilled on them from a mix of my clumsiness and three little kids splashing around at some prior dinners.  We arrived at the hotel at 5pm and had a fancy dinner that night at 8pm.  I sent one shirt to dry cleaning for the next day and one to “express” pressing only – figuring I had no choice but to just press it with the butter stains on it.  I had tried to use salt and club soda, but couldn’t get the butter out myself.  Within 45 minutes the shirt is returned, pressed – stains gone.  So they had taken careful note and somehow, in 45 minutes, they got the stains out.  This is just one example of the level of detail in thinking and helpfulness that made the stay special, but was repeated a number of times.  So I have to give just huge credit to the staff here for doing an exemplary job of everything.

This is an extremely well run hotel, our top choice when staying in London and we give it our highest recommendation without any hesitation.",5,2016,09,12
150,"A very nice, friendly hotel at a great location in London","I gave stayed at this Hyatt, locally known as The Churchill, a few times and like its location, friendly team running it and great restaurants it has. Rooms are a bit small but fine compared to Hyatt in NY or other hotels in London. Cosmetic amenities are of high quality. ",5,2016,09,12
150,Saturday Brunch to Die For,"We travel some distance to have  lunch or dinner here for family special occasions but this was our first time experiencing Saturday brunch.  What an experience!  The staff were outstandingly alert, charming and witty.  Pietro and the lovely English waiter were exceptional in their attentiveness to and care of us, so much so we felt like we were old friends by the end of the meal.  They were very funny too.  We were also very impressed by the chef in charge of mains.  Amazing staff which made our special family celebration even more special. Best Bloody Mary in my entire life!   The food was simply gorgeous and we wished we could have had another hour to eat although where we would have put any more food would have been a mystery!  Thank you so much Montagu and your fabulous staff. Our problem now.....Do Saturday again or try Sunday which looks equally amazing and totally different  .Deep sighs...........................",5,2016,09,11
150,Central location,"Location is excellent. Rooms are small but furnished well and comfortable. I stayed at second floor. Gym and some meeting rooms are located at the same floor. When you step out of the lift at the second floor you notice disturbing food smell and this continues all day long. I guess there is not such  problem on other floors. Overall, it is nice hotel with friendly staff.",4,2016,09,10
150,Landon's calling you from the Hyatt Regency!!,Wonderful experience with great service. As usual Hyatt delivers outstanding service.  Food was wonderful and the Regency club staff was very cordial.   Looking forward to our next visit in the near future. ,5,2016,09,08
150,Great location,"If you can afford to stay here, you'll notice what a great location this hotel is in if you want to visit all the typical tourist sites. At check in we were treated to a complimentary drink at their restaurant while our room was made up, which was very nice. Aside from that we did not eat at the hotel due to the high price. The rooms were small, but exceptionally laid out. As for downsides, our $500 Briggs & Riley suitcase was damaged by the hotel on the day we checked out and I emailed the hotel a picture but didn't receive a response. Secondly, there is a high Arabic population in the area and even without any preconceptions, we experienced a couple negative events. One, my wife (dressed in a totally normal t-shirt and jeans) was repeatedly scoffed at and glared at by women in full burkas almost every time we used the elevators to and from our rooms. And two, within blocks of the hotel a couple Arabic men jeered at my wife and waved their arms in my face as we passed them on the sidewalk. I still have no idea what they were upset about, but we felt unsafe. Sorry--just facts, no politics.",3,2016,09,07
150,Great stay!,"Stayed there for a total of 4 nights in early September. It was our honeymoon and the staff (shoutout to Valero at the reception desk!) were incredibly helpful, saw to our every need, and generally went above and beyond to ensure we were happy. Excellent stay, the only gripe I had is that one of the elevators was out of order which slowed us up a bit, but as soon as that's fixed I would have no compunction of becoming a repeat customer.",5,2016,09,07
150,Best Experience,"Our room was great and it was certainly an experience that we will never forget.  I highly suggest doing afternoon tea.  The service and food were amazing.  My only comments would be that the wi-fi in our room wasn't the greatest and most of the time I had to stand by our door to use the internet.  Also, we were on the 2nd floor and during our stay one of the elevators was out of service.  As a result, the two remaining lifts were constantly packed by the time it got to our floor and couldn't get on.  It seemed silly for us to wait so long to just go down one floor, but the stairs didn't exactly lead us to the main lobby and when we finally checked out, we ended up walking through the kitchen, we was a little awkward since it was in the middle of breakfast service. Luckily, we weren't too much of a distraction for your wonderful staff.   Other than those minor things, our stay was excellent.",5,2016,09,07
150,Five Stars in Every Way,Stopped here on a 20 hour layover at LHR. Staff was super friendly and efficient. Room was spacious and spotless. Went to the Club Lounge for a drink. Snacks were so good/plentiful that I opted out of dinner.,5,2016,09,07
150,"Great location, fantastic service, high quality","This is one of the nicest hotels in London, in a prime location with easy access to many businesses and sights.  The service here is outstanding, clean fresh and nearly perfect hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel for buiness and leisure travel.",5,2016,09,07
150,Still recommended,"I've stayed at this impressive hotel a couple of times; it is an ideal location close to shops but far away enough to avoid the noise. This is a solid business traveler hotel (except for the poor WiFi) and has been renovated very nicely. Last time I stayed here they had an iPad in my bedroom which was a neat touch, but not there this time - shame, really useful tool for knowing what is around the hotel and seeing the food menus as I recall. Only now that I have returned home have I realized there is also an app that could have done the same - tell me and I'd utilize it!
Sending emails and working was sometimes painful - the WiFi was sub-standard in my room and this was frustrating, especially for a five stars hotel in 2016. In the lobby it was ok. The food was very good and the service was with a smile. 
Overall, very good but please sort the WiFi.",4,2016,09,05
150,Awful!,"Terrible! I would give it negative stars if I could. I booked the room many months prior to the visit. The room which was given to me was not what I booked (I booked a King size bed, I got 2-twin bed room). Additionally, I had to wait in the lobby for over an hour post standard check-in time to check in as the roo ""had to be confirmed as clean"". I almost missed the event for which I had made a cross Atlantic trip.",1,2016,09,05
150,Excellent Stay!,Excellent Stay - Loved the hotel!  Well situated in a very nice neighborhood and the rooms were lovely. The staff were very helpful and very accommodating.  I would stay here again if I were traveling back to London.,5,2016,09,05
150,Excellent hotel,Beautiful hotel in every way. I would have to be very fussy to find fault. To demonstrate this I think the rooms just lack a coffee machine. The food and breakfast menus offer good value options and everything I had was excellent,5,2016,09,04
150,Regular stay,We have stayed in in this hotel for one night and chosen it due to the very convenient location close to the shopping areas. Hotel is nice and clean but doesn't stand out. It is a busy place and we had to wait for quite some time to get assistance from the registration. Overall a good place to stay if you want to shop and dine but I will not remember it after 12 months,4,2016,09,04
150,A business trip to central London,The property is well located and an apt business hotel. But bra sure to ask for a good room else you might get a room with effectively no view at all. The F&an is excellent and highly recommend the Chirchill bar. The gym is very ordinary and no pool. ,4,2016,09,03
150,This is a must! :-),"Well, 6 of us girlfriends have just got back from an absolutely fabulous New York Italian Brunch.  What an amazing experience! The Food was just divine, the staff all absolutely lovely, atmosphere perfect and the Prosecco just kept on flowing.  We had an amazing afternoon, while everyone else was shopping in Oxford Street the were oblivious to us in this super venue.  Admittedly I left feeling I could eat no more for the next week, but everything looked so nice, it was a shame not to try it.  Thank you to all the staff for making our visit such a perfect one :-)",5,2016,09,03
150,"Great hotel, great location","My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and the hotel staff went out of their way to make sure it was memorable. This is a 5 star hotel in every respect. Our anniversary dinner was at Locatelli's, a Michelin star restaurant located within the Hyatt, The food was magnificent and fairly priced for a Michelin star restaurant. We also ate at Zayna's located on the street directly  behind the Hyatt and were treated to a superb Pakistani meal. The underground is just a block away making this hotel convenient to everything. We would not hesitate to return to this fine hotel.",5,2016,09,02
150,Nice standard room,"I went to London on a business trip and was quite impressed with the hotel. The check-in and out at Regency club went really smooth. The staffs were friendly. 

To my surprise, the room has a classy & simple design. It felt clean and opened. The bathroom was also very good size. 

I also love the location close to Oxford street & the tube. I can easily go shopping during down time......perfect !",5,2016,09,01
150,Friendly staff and the best of teas,"Everyone was very friendly and well mannered if a bit of a tease at times. The tea was also wonderful, so there was plenty of teasing to go around. The club lounge was very nice and the rosemary bread at the Montagu was simply divine, especailly with the special tea...",5,2016,08,31
150,Inexperienced Management and Staff,You will not get your room at the guaranteed check-in time if there is a guest  in the room who choose to extend his stay. I was only able to check in 5:00pm!! The manager is very impolite and will not do what they promise.,2,2016,08,31
150,Check-in process by deception and impersonating patrons as security,"Pros:  Location, Concierge ,  compensation for complaint Cons: Check in process excuses run the gambit so difficult to get to the truth.  Patrons masquerading as security staff vetting guests by phone as to how long they are staying.  Apparently, Hyatt has recurring problem with a guest  who complains about the simplest noises such as the closing and opening of doors by operating engineers that fix HVAC system in room.",3,2016,08,29
150,"Great stay, great location.","We were there on a week end which was externally busy. The hotel was organised accordingly with extra space for breakfast, according staff. We had a great stay in this hotel.  Beautiful location, great service.  We would stay there again.",5,2016,08,29
150,"Helpful staff, good location",The hotel is located close to shopping (2 blocks) and the Park Lane. The Underground station on Bond Street is about 10 min walk away. Room is clean and of decent size. We had access to the wonderful lounge where we found quite some families (there is a separate lounge where no kids are allowed) and enjoyed the breakfast and evening snacks. The staff is super friendly and attentive. The hotel has a small gift shop in the lobby where souvenirs related to Churchill are sold (hotel is named after him).,5,2016,08,28
150,Hyatt London maintains standards and welcome,"Even in hot August days, the Hyatt Churchill continues to be a haven of good facilities, high service standard and efficient professionalism in London's West End. By no means cheap but the value of a stay here is enhanced by staff commitment to welcome and personalised service. Keep up the good work.",5,2016,08,28
150,Wonderful Hotel!,"So impressed!

I'm an experienced traveler.  The Churchill's excellent staff, beautiful rooms and attention to detail when it comes to customer service makes it my new favorite hotel. 

Although the Churchill is part of the Regency brand, in my opinion it is a lot nicer than some of the Park Hyatt's I've stayed in. Everything from check-in, to the concierge services, to check-out were so professional and easy.  Can't wait to come back!

Check-in:
We are diamond members, so upon arrival we were escorted to a special Diamond check-in. We briefly toured the club lounge and then headed to our room.

Concierge:
I'd been communicating with the concierge staff for a couple of weeks prior to our stay at the Churchill because I have some special needs regarding medical equipment and also because we are here celebrating my husband's upcoming 50th birthday. 
Our first night, we arrived to a beautiful birthday display and note from the hotel wishing my husband a happy birthday! They'd also made arrangements for my medical equipment needs as well. The concierge staff took care of everything! They really went above and beyond! Special thanks to Rafiq for all the help! 

Room Notes:
 - The bed is comfortable.
 - The windows do open.
 - The tub is clean! (Not always the case in hotels - even high-end hotels). 
 - New release movies ARE available (on demand TV)
 - Housekeeping came in the mornings and evenings
-  We stayed in a suite on the 9th floor. The room was spacious, beautiful and spotlessly clean. 

Staff:
The staff at this hotel are unbelievably wonderful. They are such an asset to this hotel and although there are many reasons to stay here, the staff is the number one reason. Everyone from the checkin desk to housekeeping will greet you with a big smile and ask if there is anything they can do to make your stay better.

Regency Club lounge:
The lounge is split in half, one side for families and one for adults. There are drinks on offer throughout the day, breakfast in the morning and light snacks in the evening. We often used the club as our main source for meals. We did find that even though the content is supposed to be the same between the lounges, more snacks (cookies and candies) were made available in the family lounge. Special thanks to Veronika in the lounge for taking such good care of us!",5,2016,08,28
150,Excessive Phone Charges,"The Hyatt Churchill apparently has a policy of exhoribitant charges for local phone calls.  I made a number of local phone calls, two of which were 50 and 30+ minutes respectively.  The original charges were 100 and 73 pounds respectively!  When I complained, the larger one was reduced by 20%.  I noted the room had no notice of these exorbitant charges and that charging for local calls at such a rate was unacceptable for a hotel of the caliber of the Hyatt Churchill where the rates were already expensive.  The desk personnel did not care.  Their attitude ruined the experience and destroyed all the other fine work of the rest of the staff.  Amazing how one incident can be so critical.",2,2016,08,28
150,Didnt honour Best Rate Guarantee,"Booked the Hyatt Regency London for October the prepaid option via Hyatt's site  . I found a lower price on Expedia Thailand but Hyatt wouldn't  honour the lower price using their ""best rate guarantee"" despite sending a screenshot taken at the same time.
Its a small thing but doesn't instill loyalty to the brand.",3,2016,08,28
150,One of the truly very best in London but for the past 2 days breakfast was crowded.,"We always stay here if we are treating ourselves to a night or 2 away in a nice hotel whilst catching a show in town and as always this hotel delivered the 5 star service we have come to expect. The staff are very welcoming and professional and the newly done rooms are so comfortable and very stylish. The location is very convenient for shopping and eating out too, although their own restaurant is fantastic if you want a night in. They have a very nice gym on the 2nd floor although we personally didn't use it. We did notice that the staff were running around trying to accommodate everybody at breakfast this time as it was so busy, but that did not affect the great selection of fresh food they had to choose from. Another lovely stay and I'm sure we will be back soon.",5,2016,08,27
150,Outstanding Hotel,"An amazing hotel with some amazing staff.    As a diamond member I stay in Hyatt when ever I can.    The hotel is a very traditionally styled hotel.    Excellent location if you love shopping 

Rooms are very comfortable and staff in the club lounge are very very helpful. 

Suites on the 9th floor are very comfortable .  932 where I stayed also had a balcony.   Excellent for hot days.    Rooms are quiet and very welcoming 

Highly recommended ",5,2016,08,26
150,Luxury and Convenience,"We decided to stay for three nights as a base from which to explore London.  As such, it is very well-placed.  Our room was large, very comfortable, immaculately presented and well-provided with everything that you would expect of a luxury hotel.  Booking a Club Room also gives you other benefits including access to the Regency Club with its complimentary canapés, wine, soft drinks and cocktails each evening, the use of a very comfortable lounge and a breakfast buffet with hot food, cold meats and cheeses, fruit and pastries.  There are actually two identical lounges with one reserved for those without children if you prefer.  The staff were all very helpful and attentive and really work to make your stay memorable.  Be aware that there is a mordernisation programme in progress so some facilities may not always be available so it is worth checking if these are important to you.",5,2016,08,23
150,"Great hotel, great location & good service","This hotel it's one of my favorite ones in London. Let's be clear in London all the rooms are small, but I find this hotel to be great! The location it's perfect, next to Oxford street but not on the busiest street. It has a private park to walk around or play tennis, the service it's really good too. Breakfast menu it's expensive but worth, I recommend to have a big breakfast and a small lunch. Staff are really nice and helpful! ",4,2016,08,23
150,Great hotel in a fantastic location,The Hyatt Churchill is a very clean and modern hotel that has been built and is maintained to a very high standard. We had a great three night stay and always love that area for the variety of restaurants and proximity to Hyde Park and the Marble Arch tube station.,5,2016,08,23
150,Excellent stay,"This grand, regal, old hotel, is located just few mins walk from Selfridges and other shops and restaurants. Welcoming and polite staffs, and the churchill lounge and the location of it, create a very pleasant London experience. The only downside is the shape of the windows.",5,2016,08,23
150,Phenomenal Service & Location,"The Churchill is my go-to hotel in London. I've stayed at this property at least 20 times in the past 2 years. 

The property has been undergoing renovations, which were recently completed. So the only down side was that renovation noise, which I mostly missed as I was out of the hotel for work. 

The location of the Hyatt Regency is amazing... Its 1 block from Oxford Street in Mayfair, which has tons of shopping. There are also several very good restaurants in walking distance. 

The rooms themselves are quite large, especially for London. I've mostly stayed in their King room, but have also had the opportunity to stay in the Regency suite, which was very nice. The rooms have the old world charm, but have been upgraded with new furniture and finishings. 

The club is wonderful... The breakfast is lovely, with fresh eggs and fruits. The late evening snacks are a nice treat as well. I've also spent several evenings with colleagues at the Churchill bar. The bar staff is great and they make really good drinks. 

In terms of service, I've found that the staff at this property is top notch. They will go out of their way to make sure you're having a great stay. I look forward to my next visit to the Churchill.",5,2016,08,23
150,Excellent Stay in London!,"We spent three nights here in July.  Our room was recently renovated and was very updated with great linens.  The bathroom had just enough room and had a really good shower.  The updates to the hotel with the bespoke art were great touches to remind you that the hotel is named after Churchill.

All of the staff were very friendly and attentive.

We had drinks in the bar and enjoyed the ambience and the bartenders were helpful in making selections.  

We will definitely return.",5,2016,08,19
150,been coming here many many years generally satisfied,"staff and people are good and friendly except one or two who are obnoxious:the old timers are great and helpful;location is great; amenities in room could be improved on-quality and scarce at the moment,to make it a more luxury hotel",4,2016,08,17
150,"Hyatt Regency Churchill - Elegant, historical, friendly","We had the chance to stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill Hotel and were very pleased from beginning to end.  The location worked well as did having access to the Club Lounge to relax and enjoy.  Hotel room is straightforward with comfortable bedding, mattress etc.  Room is not large but very functional.  We opted for a view of the Provence Square park (after reading other Tripadvisor reviews) which offered privacy and tranquility.  The lobby was welcoming and has a nightly piano player and small Churchill concession which adds a touch of sophistication and joie de vivre.  This is a nicely positioned hotel that deserves an excellent T.A. review.",5,2016,08,16
150,Flawless,"Stay couldn't have been better: great, very clean, quiet room, great bed, nice bathroom, scrumptious breakfast buffet, nice staff, fast wifi.

Location was good, north of Oxford Street and Mayfair.

Would return in a heartbeat.",5,2016,08,15
150,Most excellent service and attention to details,"Had booked only a small weekend trip to London, we chose The Churchill as a stay. And we did not regret it one bit. We actually are hoping to find a reason to visit London again so we can enjoy the great staff and service offered by the hotel. 

The room was large and very clean and with all the necessities. The dining was excellent and the bar was very interesting with some unique cocktails that bears repeating.",5,2016,08,15
150,Excellent hotel and fantastic staff,This hotel was amazing from the moment we walked in the door till the moment we left. The staff couldn't do enough for us. We had a very spacious room versioning the gardens and really enjoyed the atmospheric bar. Cannot wai to stay there again this August bank holiday weekend ,5,2016,08,10
150,AMAZING!!,"I stayed for a couple of nights with a friend in August and had the most fantastic stay. 
The hotel is in a fab location, just behind Oxford Street and right opposite a small park.
The service was fantastic right from the Concierge on arrival to the breakfast team and the bar stuff too. 
I am already planning my next trip and can't wait to return - thank you for an amazing stay!",5,2016,08,08
150,Beautiful hotel with great location,Great hotel. Very luxurious and clean. Good mix of modern and old. Just a couple blocks from lots of shopping on Oxford Street. Beds and sheets very soft and comfortable. Plenty of room. Had a room refrigerator but mostly with things to purchase. Had the breakfast daily and was delicous and lots of variety. Loved that they had a little on the go area that had to go cups of tea and coffee and croissants.,5,2016,08,08
150,Excellent ,"I've been a guest at the Hyatt in the past  and this Saturday just gone (6th August)   I must say I thoroughly enjoyed popping by for the 'afternoon tea ' sat in the Montagu restaurant . The  staff were friendly and accommodating, and the young female pianist was just divine ! Perfect music choices and perfect ambience. I look forward to my next visit when I'm back in the UK ",5,2016,08,08
150,wonderful hotel in a great location,Stayed here for 2 nights and had a wonderful experience.  The property is beautiful and the location is great - short walk to Marble Arch.  Staff showed a genuine caring attitude.  I recommend a drink at the Churchill bar -- and sit at the bar and watch the bartenders - quite a show!  Donostia is a wonderful Basque tapas restaurant nearby and is worth a try.,5,2016,08,08
150,Great location and service,"Had a great stay at this Hyatt... centrally located in one of our favorite neighborhoods in London, great staff and phenomenal service.  We were warmly welcomed by the front desk, the room was in perfect condition... overall an excellent stay.",5,2016,08,06
150,Adequate but difficult to justify the proce,"I've stayed in various Hyatt hotels around the world and know they guarantee a well appointed quality hotel. On a vacation trip that included London we selected the Hyatt Churchill for its location and rating.  Despite the five stars and eye watering price I have to say there is nothing special about this hotel. Other hotels we used on this trip demonstrated vastly superior rooms and service at a fraction of the price. 

Front desk was unable to assign a room when we arrived early despite prior notice which is not unusual but failed to call to inform us that the room was ready later in the afternoon. Our request for a one hour later check out could not be accommodated either. 

The room was clean and reasonably appointed but the wardrobe which has approximately five inches of hanging space for longer items is not deep enough accommodate the hangers when the door is closed. 

I would stay elsewhere if visiting London in the future. ",2,2016,08,06
150,"Well situated ,rooms are small",We always try and remain loyal to the Hyatt group. However this Hyatt is not luxurious. Rooms are very small and are decorated very simply. Bathrooms are tiny and do not have a seperate shower. We stayed on the executive floor and expected better rooms. Staff on the 8th floor are outstanding and willing to help at all times. The executive lounge is an excellent benefit however the one club lounge is filled with children whom treat the private space like a kindergarten. Hotel was filled with families and kids running up and down the passages with no regard for other guests.,3,2016,08,05
150,Great location and service,"We stayed here for 4 nights in July and everything was great.  They were able to accommodate our large party of 8 whenever possible.  Though the rooms were cozy, they made the best of the space. The location can't be beat.  It's right near the busy shopping street, and yet you can't tell at all due to its quiet location.  Would return again.",5,2016,08,05
150,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel!","We moved to The Churchill after having spent 5 nights at the Marriott Grosvenor Square. The Churchill was infinitely superior in every way. The staff -- everyone from doormen to front desk clerks to the concierge to the lounge staff to housekeeping -- were amazing. Extremely polite and professional, they did everything they could to make our 2 nights feel like home. The next time I'm in London, I'll skip the Marriott and make sure I stay at The Churchill for my enitre stay!

Thank you for a wonderful experience!",5,2016,08,04
150,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed. ,"We stayed there 5 nights in July. Everything was top notch. The breakfasts are amazing with fresh pastries, fruits,omelettes made to order and things you would not normally find for breakfast. The bests are super comfortable for a great night's sleep. Rooms are clean and spacious and the toilets are ""special!"" Close to Oxford street. It's an amazing hotel with a great staff!",5,2016,08,03
150,Pleasant stay.,"Very good position in the centre of London but expensive. The staff were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. We stayed on the 8th floor, so had access to the Executive Lounge. The variety of snack food provided was good and there were so many delicious tasty bites, we didn't need to go out for an evening meal ! Bearing in mind that this is in the Congestion Zone, hotel parking is costly at £46 but this is only to be expected considering its location. Our room was pleasant, the bed comfortable but not luxurious.
",4,2016,08,02
150,Excellent London Hotel ,"Stayed at a number of 5* hotels in London and this one rates highly. Nothing particularly stands out, but everything simply done well. Excellent staff, location and rooms which have all been refurbished to a high if uninspired standard. Great beds and quiet rooms. Breakfast is very good, both the a la carte and the buffet; fresh and hot.

Overall there are other 5* hotels with more bling (Dorchester, Langham spring to mind) but the Hyatt is unpretentious and does the little things better.",5,2016,07,31
150,Luxurious and great location. ,"Stayed here while in London in business.  I booked it blind as a secret hotel destination and was delighted to get the Churchill.  It's literally a stones throw from Oxford street.  

It's a beautiful hotel. I got a refurbished room.  The hotel is currently refurbishing floor by floor.  No noise or anything nor did I even notice any sign of works. 

It was a work trip so stayed in my room mainly after a hard day if meetings.  It was soooo relaxing. 

Staff were lovely.  ",5,2016,07,31
150,Excellent London hotel,"This is one of my favourite hotels in London.  Extremely well positioned, close to Marble Arch and Oxford Street. Rooms are a good size and modern. Staff are terrific. Recommend Executive Rooms with club access - one of the best Exec Clubs I've experienced. Definitely a good option for a stay in London",5,2016,07,29
150,Food location in London city,"I have recenti y bene staying  with The family at Hyatt Regency Churchill. Nice and silent room, small  as it happens in The big  cities, small bathroom but confortable enough. Good and fast wifi line. Very small gym and not at the usual Hyatt level, the tv on the machines was not working and the air conditioning was not good enough. I had a connection problem in the room of my children and I called the service, they replied in a rude way stating they would double check but the problem wasn't solved at all. Very professional and friendly people at the reception and concierge. Very high price, not really good value for money but this is London.",4,2016,07,27
150,a lovely hotel in a marvelous place,"We stayed there during our weekend in London, and had very good experience overall. 
First, the location is great - Hyde Park, Marble Arch, Oxford Street and lots of nice little streets with all kinds of great restaurants - all within 5 minutes walk. Very close to Paddington station, which is great if you take Heathrow Express.
The rooms are not big, typical Hyatt Regency standard, but very clean and relatively quiet. There was some noise in the hallway because kids were playing a few evenings, but overall we slept well. There was no construction noise or noise from the street, like in many hotels in downtown London. 
The hotel is not new, but everything in the rooms is clean and in good order. Very well appointed bathroom. cleaning service was quick and efficient.
The restaurant downstairs is very nice. On Sunday there was a piano playing in the hallway. The breakfast was not included into our rate, but was sumptuous and very well presented. Great service from the restaurant team.
Like a lot of Hyatts it has free internet, which is not very fast but works for checking email and basic work. 
Overall, is definitely a good choice for both business travelers and families. A bit overpriced, but you get decent quality and standard for your money.",5,2016,07,27
150,good location in London,"I have recently been staying at Hyatt regency London with my family, wonderful position close to everything in the city centre. nice rooms, very small but convenient and clean bathroom. good quality of high speed internet complimentary. very small gym not up to the Hyatt level and machines not in good order. reception staff very helpful and kind. the only problem was with the wifi connection in the room of my children, I was calling the operator which said they were about to rectify the problem but the person which replied was rude.",4,2016,07,26
150,"Great hotel, great location","Hyatt is always good and this is no exception. Enjoyed the stay and all worked like clock work. Highly recommended hotel with a great location in London and great friendly staff. The outside is quite anonymous, inside warm and welcoming.",5,2016,07,25
150,Excellent hotel and great location,"The staff is friendly and very helpful. The location is great and the facilities are excellent. The room was big, comfortable, and filled with new/modern amenities. The hotel is a short walk to Oxford street and close to a lot of great restaurants. Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,25
150,Wedding party,"Although I didn't stay at this hotel, I was fortunate enough to be a wedding guest here yesterday! 
Beautiful service , very well managed team of hard working staff.  Pleasant and chatty without being overly familiar. Certainly very attentive. 
The Hotel is beautifully stylish and elegant without being snobby!  
I felt comfortable there and I'm a northerner!!  ......although I have to say £12 for two cokes??!!   Is that absolutely necessary ??!!",5,2016,07,24
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill - London,Excellent hotel.  The staff did a great job making us feel at home.  They were very attentive and courteous. They booked a show for us and got us great seats and always made sure we knew how to get to where we were going.  The hotel is close to most of London's major attractions.,5,2016,07,24
150,Still my favorite London place,"I have been staying at this hotel (and various other hotels in London) for the last four decades. This hotel has been renovated several time and I love to stay here shortly after the renovation. This was also a good time for stay. The renovation was still new.
Though I am member of several hotel chains, I am not a loyalist, I just chose hotel to fit particular need.
If you want a hotel with a room slightly larger than other typical London hotel, with modern style renovation including the TOTO automatical toilet seat, overlooking a semi private park where you can get in to enjoy, and nearby London transportation system, and is 100 metres away from Oxford Street. This is the one I would settle for.",5,2016,07,24
150,"Rooms are too small, service is pathetic.....","Exec floor rooms are tiny and the toilets are so small. The service by the front desk as well as the exec staff is not really at the normal hyatt standards. I am a hyatt diamond member and this is one property where the staff that dont even address me by name, and i stay here all the time, Ofcourse the location is excellent and the grand club is also very good.",2,2016,07,23
150,Excellent service,"It's been 2 years since I last reviewed a Hyatt property while on vacation.  For context, I travel globally and have been a Hyatt Diamond customer (50+ nights/year) for 10 years running.  Therefore, caveat: we may have gotten extra attention and we had access to the Regency lounge on the 8th floor.  You may not, or may need to put effort in to get it.

That being said, we had a great time at this property.  The lounges are incredibly useful.  The staff, from the 8th floor team to the concierges on the lobby floor, were all unfailingly cheerful, helpful and (especially with William the concierge) funny.

By global Hyatt standards, the rooms are small.  For London, they're just fine.  The location is a little far from the City, but on the other hand it's scenic and quiet.  Special kudos for the double windows in the rooms facing Portman Square, as they pretty much eliminate noise.

Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,21
150,Hyatt Policies,"while a nice hotel, the staff/company policies have created an environment where I will no longer stay at Hyatt's.  This sole interaction at check in was less than satisfactory even though I earned Platinum status with Hyatt.",2,2016,07,20
150,Splendid Staff,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour, but the hotel staff always made us feel special.  We had stayed here once before seven years ago, and I remembered it as large and bland, but that was not my experience this time.  Our room was comfortable, we got good recommendations for dining, and the location was quite good.  There were nine in our party and everyone had a good stay.",5,2016,07,18
150,Great classy hotel in nice area,The hotel is very nice on the exterior as well as the interior.  The front lobby is very nice with the Montagu restaurnat adjacent to it.  The room was nice and updated.  The front desk and concierge desks were very friendly and attentive.  The room maids were also attentive.,5,2016,07,18
150,Luxurious accomodation,"An absolutely amazing stay.  Great check in and easy check out (make sure you have the fruit enhanced water by the front desk).

Beautiful room, good size (especially for London), very comfortable temperature and air flow.  Brilliantly clean room (all of the hotel actually).  The bath room was large with luxurious towels and great amenities.  The bed was comfy as were the sheets and pillows. Top-notch service.

Had room service the first night there.  One of the best room service meals we've ever had: Cottage Pie & Sabzi handi (Aubergine, peppers, green peas, cauliflower).  Also had a meal by the bar and it was quite pleasant.

Only down side was the view from the room.  They can't all look out on the park",5,2016,07,18
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill,"very nice hotel, excellent  location to hyde park and train stations, will return at anytime, nice room, bar/food type had great options and service, executive lounge staff best that I have experience in all my travel in Europe",5,2016,07,17
150,The Churchill just keeps getting better,"It's been 6 years since my last stay at The Churchill. I liked it then but I really loved it this time. 

The rooms seem to have been renovated and are really good size, bathroom quite large, easy and large walk in shower and walk in wardrobe. 

The bed was extremely comfortable. I had a great night sleep and I don't sleep that well. 

I ordered room service for breakfast and it was delicious. Fresh Berries, great juices. 

Had dinner at the hotel restaurant near the lobby and was really pleasantly surprised. Fresh Oysters were amazing!!! The lamb superb. 

The only downside - not much of a view from the hotel room. Staff service at the Churchill bar was poor. 

",4,2016,07,17
150,Wonderful stay,"My two children and I stayed in a Regency Suite for 5 days this summer.  They were initially very dismayed at having to stay on a sleeper sofa, but after it was made up, they reported that it was the only comfortable sofa bed they'd ever experienced. We really enjoyed the convenience of the Club floor.  The canapes in the evening were superb, as was the breakfast.  The servers there were friendly and greeted us warmly every time we entered.  Housekeeping was excellent as well.  A completely positive experience.",5,2016,07,16
150,Recommended - very pleasant stay,"Stayed here for three nights over a long weekend. The hotel staff is very attentive and customer orientated but some of the front desk staff appear a bit uppity. The room service and housekeeping teams are excellent.

I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a lovely junior suite on the ninth floor with a balcony overlooking Portman Square. The overall deal turned out to be very good value for money considering that breakfast on the eight floor was included. The room was clean, very well equipped and included an espresso machine.

This area of London appeals to me because it is upmarket and relatively quiet i.e. not too much tourist activity in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  It is secluded, relatively peaceful yet it is central. The greenery of Portman Square in front of the hotel is a nice feature. Selfridges is only a block walk away and that is really all I need in terms of shopping in London.

I had booked a limo via the hotel to fetch me on arrival at Heathrow. Not a cheap option but it works really well.

One area of improvement: The internet connections was clunky and not stable. As a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I am apparently entitled to high-speed internet but this was never offered to me. I raised the poor internet connectivity when checking out and was told that if I had complained, I would have been given a special code to access a better connection. Not good enough.",4,2016,07,16
150,Renovated room,"London was the last leg of our trip. As the Hyatt did not accommodate a family of four in one room, we had to get two rooms - one for my husband and 10-year-old son and one for my 12-year-old daughter and me. Though not connected, they were two doors down from each other. We stayed in their recently renovated rooms. They were very nice - crisp, modern and classy. Both rooms were identical. I appreciated that we were greeted with a cute treat when we walked into the rooms - chocolate covered cones decorated very creatively - three in each room. I thought it was thoughtful of them. The hotel is located near bus and subway stations. They were convenient and easy to navigate. Front desk service was fine. Nothing wrong, but not friendly like the other hotels we had visited on our trip. If I had to compare it to the other four hotels we had stayed at on our trip, the other hotels made us feel like they were happy to see us and that we were welcome guests. This Hyatt made us feel like we were clients checking in. We were informed that we could upgrade to a Club Room for $89 per room a night or prepay for breakfast at a discounted rate and given our wifi code and key. We weren't even told exactly where the elevators were or that we had to use our key to activate it. None of that was a huge deal. I was just comparing it to the service we received elsewhere. My husband became ill during our stay, and they didn't have a small store with any medicine for me to buy so I had to go out and find a store. Again, not a big deal, but a bit inconvenient. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,07,15
150,Clean and tidy,"We stayed at this hotel in June 2016. The room was very clean. The staff who greeted us outside were outstanding - helpful in getting us cabs, and very helpful when we we were juggling packages, a baby and a stroller. The breakfast was very, very good. Lots of selection and food was fresh. A recommended stay.",5,2016,07,14
150,"Great stay, once we got past check in!","It took a ridiculously long time to check in: there was a queue, then they couldn't find us a room, as 'upstairs' kept blocking them. Eventually we were given room 738, only to find someone else's case and bags in there. Had to go back down to get the receptionist, who came up to retrieve them, then they had to send someone else to collect the suit carriers in the wardrobe, which we only noticed a few minutes later!
The Club Lounge had a very good food and drink offering between 5:30-7:30pm and an excellent breakfast buffet, including poached eggs and toast. 
Our room was on the 7th floor, overlooking Portland Square. It was newly refurbished, mostly in brown, and was a smallish room with a small bathroom, but it included a bath with a shower over. Very good water pressure in the shower and a good hairdryer. Other facilities included a TV, fridge-style minibar with a free shelf and a kettle.  There were sockets next to the bed on one side only, and no usb charging points, surprising in newly-refurbished room. The wifi was hit-and-miss, but we had 4G, so not a problem.
The location is fantastic, just at the back of Oxford Street.",4,2016,07,14
150,very nice location,I stay in this Hotel for a meeting in June 2016. Room nice and very good food and drinks. the only remark was the price a little too high. London in general is very expensive. I will use this address again,4,2016,07,14
150,Exactly what I expect from a Hyatt,"We stayed at the Hyatt Churchill for 5 nights while on vacation in July. It was everything I expect a Hyatt to be. Rooms were modern, clean and the staff was fantastic. They helped us get anywhere we wanted to go with additional suggestions for things to do while we were visiting. I'm a Diamond member, but don't always get treated like one, however the service was top notch here. When we checked in, they put us on the club level floor so we didn't have to take the elevator to the lounge everyday – the convenience was definitely appreciated! I also loved that there was a family lounge and an adult only lounge. The food and beverage selection was great and everything was always stocked. The location was good as well – about a 30 minute walk to Big Ben, the London Eye and Westminster Abbey. The area is quieter, which we appreciated after dealing with the large crowds all day – right next to Hyde Park. We loved the Churchill bar, too. It is open much later than the rest of the pubs and classier. We'd stay again and definitely recommend.",5,2016,07,13
150,As expected but....,"Overall the experience is what I expected(good) except for one disturbing policy of the property.    Many of us whom travel being able to work effectively while away is very very important.  For me and many others this means a quality internet connection.   This property limits all internet bandwidth to 2MB/sec to all users at all times of the day wired or wireless irregardless of the type of traffic(yes I am a computer network engineer).   i.e. It's slooooow,    Such a low rate cap does not meet my expectations for a property of this nature.",4,2016,07,12
150,A Haven in Central London,We have been staying at The Churchill for many years and it has become like a home from home. Quiet and peaceful (especially if you stay on the Club floors.) A contemporary elegance permeates all areas of the hotel. The Montagu is a great restaurant and The Churchill  Bar is a cool place to relax. The service in the executive lounge is always exceptional.,5,2016,07,11
150,5-Star-Amazing,"We traveled all over Europe and stayed at over 6 hotels - all 5 stars hotels. This was our favorite hotel stay. We were welcomed before we arrived via email. Since this was our honeymoon and I mentioned that in our reservation comments, we were contacted by Tanya. She asked for my husband's name. We expected a nice card, but when we arrived we were greeted and told we had a room upgrade. Waiting for us was a beautiful and delicious chocolate dessert with ""Happy Honeymoon"" in chocolate syrup. It was a special surprise, especially after a long day of traveling. We were also given a nice card and champagne. It was so thoughtful and made our time in London extra special. Props to Tanya for making us feel loved!  More perks: the location was good. The attractions we wanted to see were within walking distance or a short taxi ride away. The hotel is clean, elegant and modern. The bed was comfy and bathroom we had was huge. It was a good change from some of the other hotels we stayed in during our trip.",5,2016,07,10
150,Very nice two nights in London,"Had a nice quiet stay at this property last week. I used my Hyatt points plus cash to book two nights and we checked in early after a long haul flight that was delayed for a few hours, always appreciated when possible. The room was basically brand new, I know the property has been renovated recently. Very comfortable bed, everything you need in a modern bathroom including plenty of towels, bath products etc. the room was very quiet, not much noise from outside or the other rooms. We ordered room service the first night it came extremely fast and the sandwich was awesome for a reasonable price! The staff was very friendly and the hotel is in a nice quiet area, close to the Underground and a handful of restaurants nearby.",4,2016,07,10
150,What I expect from Hyatt,"We used my Hyatt points for a free room weekend. We had one of the newly refurbished rooms and were fascinated by the Japanese toilet with the heated toilet seat! The service and prices were as we expected for a 5 star London hotel within walking distance of Oxford street. There is no longer parking at the hotel but my car was kept safe at a cost of £79 for 2 days. The concierge was very helpful in arranging me to pay the congestion charge and advice on charges if I visit London for 
10 or more times. The Italian receptionists were very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,07,10
150,Superb experience at Hyatt -Churchill,"We had the most amazing experience at the Hyatt -Churchill London for our business meeting. The check in process, was absolutely seamless and the staff that aided us. After a long trip, this is what we needed, we were moved to a separate queue and check-in immediately.       The new rooms at the Hyatt were immaculate. All travelling necessity were addressed and I did not have to worry about the basic travelling requirements.     The conference facilities are on par excellence. The conference room size was just perfect for our meeting. The food and beverages were provided at the right time for us to take a much needed break.    The overall service was world class. The value were received was tremendous. The sleep experience was really tranquil. I found the overall cleanliness really pleasing. The location was perfect for our trip. It was close to the Heath row express and getting to the airport on a Friday afternoon was a pleasure. It took about 30 minutes. The hotel was close to the park, perfect for an early morning or late afternoon running. The ambient environment made it a pleasure to stay and I would highly recommend the Hyatt to all business professionals",5,2016,07,10
150,Great location,"We just returned from a brief stay in London, and had another perfect Hyatt experience.  The service levels were fantastic.  The room was well updated, large bathrooms, and a fantastic Regency Club (actually two rooms, one for families and one for just adults).  One of the better Clubs we have visited, food was pretty darn good.  Hotel was in a prime location, just a short walk to Oxford street.  We would definitely return to the Hyatt Churchill.",5,2016,07,08
150,Just fine,"We requested two beds in advance but they didn't prepare for us. Since they don't have suite with two beds, when we arrived they put us in a temporary room and worked on replacing the king bed with two twins. They moved us back to our room within an hour. To compensate, they offered us free breakfast. The room is fine except that: the shower room is too small and the deco of the master bath room is a bit out of dated. The regular room is actually better renovated as what we saw in the temporary room. Overall the experience is good although I expected it to be better.",4,2016,07,08
150,"Perfect location, great staff","So, this was our first time at this hotel, and whenever I go back to England, I will always stay here. It was fantastic. 
Rooms are small, but hey it's ok you don't need a palace. We had updated rooms and the king size bed was so comfortable and the view of Portman square could not be beat. And it was QUIET- I loved it. Lobby was beautiful. Very busy place but they had tons of staff around. 
Few things to point out: my parents were the first people to stay in the handicap room (428). They were not able to check into their room until after 5pm which was not good for my mom who needs her nap everyday at 2pm as she has MS and gets very tired. 
It looks as though they needed another day to have the room really ready because they were still clearing it out from all the construction at 3pm. So whatever, my mom had to nap in my room. No biggie. 
However, we really were the Guinea pigs for that room. For example, they have really cool automatic doors for the room door and bathroom door. But- the light switch is outside the bathroom, and the automatic door didn't work properly at first when we got there. And neither did my parents tv, and there was no side table, additional chair in the room etc. 
So the first 24 hours was really a cluster of people calling to our room, coming to our room, fixing things etc. it was not relaxing. The manager and assistant manager came up and were super nice and apologetic. But I was a little disappointed in their lack of follow up. No offer for a free breakfast or hotel points or anything from them for the huge inconvenience this was to my parents. They left a little bottle of wine and some dessert one night- but my parents don't drink and don't like sweets- and there was no bite acknowledging why all those goodies were there. Would have been nice for them to follow up and offer something. We really were the first people in that room and yes it has a handicap shower and is accessible but we felt like the test subjects. And to me, that's not 5 star. If I were the manager I would have called my father up again and confirmed everything was ok and offered something to them. But hey, I'm not the manager. 
The porters were fantastic- George thank you for being so kind!!! 
The concierge Salir was lovely to me. 
The room service people were lovely!
The front desk people left a bit to be desired - they felt really disconnected. 
Anyway. 
All in all a nice time at a hotel that has a few kinks to fix on their handicap room and follow up service for people that are platinum members. But we will be back. 
",5,2016,07,07
150,Disappointed by the Staff!,"All in all, I was pretty disappointed with my stay!  I found the staff to be very unhelpful.  We planned this trip about a year out, and we were really looking forward, but we were very disappointed by the staff, and in all honesty it put a damper on our stay.  

The rooms were fine, and the hard product is fine (other than the wifi which was inconsistent and more off than on- they told us they were having issues with it throughout our stay), but to me, a hotel is defined by its staff, and over the years I've stayed and reviewed dozens of hotels (as a Hyatt Diamond for 5 years) and the staff makes or breaks an experience.  

Those in the service and travel industry should be cognizant of the fact that they have the opportunity to make a trip memorable or disappointing, and especially for those celebrating a special occasion, these are unique opportunities, and they should do what they can to make it count.",2,2016,07,05
150,Amazing,"This hotel exceeded my every expectation.  Great location, staff was absolutely wonderful and accommodating - even allowed an early check-in when we arrived after an international flight.  The food and wine selections were also superb - It just could not have been a better experience.",5,2016,07,05
150,Nice - doing construction,"I spent 2 nights here when my onward travel arrangements fell through.  I had one of the updated rooms and it was very pleasant and devoid of street noise, which is unusual in London; however, the hallway noise was pretty bad.  When walking down the hall, you could here people talking in their rooms - like regular talking.  The gym was okay with a lovely plate of fresh fruit and towels, but the only way to access it was down a fairly grungy stairway.  The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient.  The location is great for Oxford Street shopping.  I was on vacation and woke up to drilling, so although renovations must happen, it's important to know before you book.",4,2016,07,04
150,Amazing Birthday Stay,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  What a wonderful experience.  My 50th anniversary was made extra special by the staff who were all beyond excellent.  I stayed with my mother and my children and we all felt exactly the same way.  The rooms were so clean and elegant and the king size bed was like a large island in a wonderful oasis - so much room.  The bathrooms were a joy to be in and whenever we saw the hotel staff in the corridor, they were pleasant and friendly.  The Saturday Brunch was a fabulous affair and there was nothing too much to ask for even if it was not on display.  My mother has a particular diet and they were immensely helpful in helping her to have just as satisfying a meal as we had.  Breakfast was a sumptuous affair and the hot chocolate has destroyed me for anywhere else - never tasted chocolate like that  and will definitely return - if just for that.  On the Saturday evening, we went to a hotel around the corner for our evening meal but was bitterly disappointed with their fare, manner and surroundings.  We returned and had desert at the Hyatt and it was beautiful, both in presentation and taste.  The gentleman serving us was informative, generous and could not do enough to please.  We had our desert by the fireplace and that experience managed to dispel completely our displeasure from the other hotel.  I cannot finish without making special mention of the service from every member of staff - from the desk to the restaurant to the facility staff.  They worked smoothly and seamlessly amongst the residents and knew just when to check our requirements or to offer assistance.  They all worked together - the Maitre' D working as hard as the rest of the staff.  I went up before they had given me a birthday commemoration and within minutes of getting to my room, I had been followed and presented with the birthday salutation and cake.  I realise that for many in this field, it is their employment but the Hyatt staff, from their manner and performance, made everyone feel as if they were special - not just those in my party but when I looked around, I saw the same thankful and appreciative faces that mirrored ours.  If there was one regret, it was that the tennis courts were closed for an event, something the staff had no control over. Will we stay there again, I am already looking for the next possible opportunity.  Thank you to all who made my 50th very special. AJoseph",5,2016,07,03
150,"A wonderful, relaxing stay in London","The hotel is in an excellent location for any stay in London.  We were only there for three days but because the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous, we were able to start relaxing immediately.  The rooms were very clean and well decorated.  And the restaurants served killer cocktails and a wonderful breakfast buffet.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,03
150,Always Excellent - a pleasure to stay,"The Hyatt Churchill is one of London's iconic experiences. I so highly recommend the hotel to you! Great staff, warm and welcoming. The rooms are good and the restaurants and bars OK, but its position is the best, the very best!  Enjoy your stay, we always do!",5,2016,07,02
150,ILL TRAINED STAFF,"Due to the lack of hospitality institutions in Uk, the hotel picks up staff off the street. The training is lacking. Chasing the pound is more important to the staff.They argue with the guests.Not the top hyatt in any case. staff should be sent to dusseldorf hyatt for training.",3,2016,07,02
150,Great for Oxford Street shopping!,"This hotel has a great location very close to Oxford Street shops - 5-10 minute walk to Selfridges and M & S.  A short if a little pricey cab ride to the West End theatres/ Covent Garden etc.  NCP Car Park next door - quite pricey too, but then it is central London.  Room was a smaller than average, but had recently been refurbished to a very high standard.  Bathroom had a loo with an electronic bidet function! The Breakfast was of a high quality with plenty of choice. The bar and terrace was really nice, if a little noisy.  Plenty of interesting cocktails from which to choose! Reception staff were very helpful and polite.",4,2016,06,29
150,Our 2 night short-stay @ Hyatt Regency - The Churchill,"Overall, we had a pleasant stay at this hotel. The room was as described and what makes this hotel special are its staff! We requested early check-in and Lucca was outstanding in accommodating our request. The only major disappointment was the WiFi (near 550 block - 5th floor), WiFi was very spotty to non-existent. I had called once and was told the AP (Access Point needs to be restarted), and not sure what impact the restart had, as there was no change whatsoever. Outside of the technical issue, the property and location are terrific with the wonderful staff topping off the stay here @ Hyatt Regency - The Churchill.",4,2016,06,29
150,"Luxurious, friendly","I spent 4 nights at the Hyatt Regency, and every person on the staff was so courteous, helpful, and professional. The hotel restaurant was a great spot for breakfast, and the bar, though small, served a great cosmo! Ask for a room with a view of the beautiful private park across the street. Oxford Street is a quick walk away for great shopping.",5,2016,06,28
150,Great hotel,This hotel is very well located in London with easy access to anywhere via Marble Arch station. It had the very high quality Hyatt feel . Rooms were clean and quiet and staff were very attentive throughout the hotel.,5,2016,06,28
150,Great stay in an excellent location,We had the good fortune to stay at the Churchill for 5 nights of sightseeing and were very impressed with the hotel and staff. After a wait for help on checking in we were treated like royalty  by Ricardo on the front desk. He also escorted us to the club lounge while we waited for our room to be ready.  The hotel is really well located and has a great bar with some truly unique drinks and service there is fantastic. We had a small issue with our toilet that was sorted quickly and properly.,5,2016,06,28
150,Superb new suites,"We were traveling with our granddaughter and were given one of the newly re-done suites.  The room was one of the best we have had.  

The bath had two counters- one for the sink and one that could be used for storing your bathroom supplies.  The shower was modern but a bit smaller than my preference.  The bath tub included a hand shower.  The toilet was one of the latest full featured units with a control panel on the arm.

We had a separate bed room with an excellent king size bed and good storage.  The other room included a separate half bath, a massive desk and chair. a sofa and chair, and a very nice book case.  They had a rollaway bed there for our granddaughter. 

In addition we found the staff, breakfast, and room service all to be first class.  I highly recommend.",5,2016,06,27
150,my hotel stay,"very centrally located, the rooms are very clean and comfortable and the hotel atmosphere is wonderful.    We spent four days at this hotel and were extremely satisfied with every aspect of this hotel and would highly recommend it",5,2016,06,27
150,Much improved following renovations,"The renovations are now largely complete. The new rooms are great, with a modern touch. The baths have been removed and replaced with a large shower which is a big improvement. However, the lip of the shower is not high enough so the bathroom floor  gets a bit flooded while showering. The toilets are space age, with an arm of controls to incorporate a bidet.

This hotel has a great position, being a short walk to Oxford Street and the Central Line. The staff are very efficient and friendly. I have stayed here many times and enjoy the hotel.

One downside of this trip was a room located near the lift lobby, resulting in a far amount of noise as late guests came in late and still in a festive mood.",4,2016,06,27
150,A very pleasant stay,"My husband and I were meeting friends in London, so booked the Hyatt last minute. When were arrived we were met by very proficient staff, service with a smile. We were upgraded to a king room with garden views on the seventh floor. The room was very clean and spacious, with the promised view of the private garden. We extended check out to 2pm. In the morning we had breakfast delivered to the room. The quantity, quality and presentation was faultless, it was hot and delicious. This hotel was just perfect, we will definitely be visiting again.",5,2016,06,26
150,Excellent Hotel in Londo,I stayed here two years ago.  I highly recommend this hotel to everyone based on my recent stay with the new and improved room and services.  Really enjoyed my breakfast at the lounge.  The staff provided excellent services to all guests.  ,5,2016,06,25
150,This was a GREAT hotel,This was a phenomenal hotel.  It is maybe a 5-7 minute walk from the Marble Arch Tube stop.  I consider this to be acceptable and convenient considering London.   The hotel staff allowed me to check in early (arriving from the U.S. early morning after flying all night) which was greatly appreciated.   The lobby is small but very classy.   There was construction across the street from my room which worried me - but the insulation in the room was superior and I heard nothing!   The room appeared recently refurbished.   The beds were comfortable and the room exceptionally clean.  Turndown service brought more Molton Brown bath supplies and THE biggest supply of washcloths I have ever seen (see picture).  I definitely hope to stay at this location in the future.,5,2016,06,22
150,Comfortable Stay at Hyatt Churchill London,"Stayed 5 nights at end of 5-week trip.  Great location near Selfridges and Marble Arch underground station, with choice of multiple buses along Oxford Street that go almost anywhere you would wish. Had beautiful renovated room with great rain and hand-held shower (no tub), new ""high-tech"" toilet, and good reading lights at sides of bed, but no comfortable reading chair. Staff service throughout was superb. My 2nd stay at the Churchill and is my preferred hotel in London.",5,2016,06,21
150,Excellent Staff and nicely renovated rooms,"The check in staff found me a room right away when mine wasn't ready. However the  room was smaller then I booked, so I was offered access to the club lounge. This was a nice unexpected treat. Although the room was small, it was newly renovated and very nice. Loved the Japanese bidet with the heated seats. Also housekeeping quickly sent someone to add my requested preferences to the new room. I didn't even have to call. All staff interactions I had were friendly, helpful and professional. The staff at this hotel really seemed to take pride in there work.",5,2016,06,21
150,Just Average,"We stayed here for two nights in May 2016.  Upon check-in we were greeted by a less than friendly, uppity, clerk.  
The room was nice except for the gaseous smell coming from the bathroom sink.  The hotel was undergoing renovations so I am assuming that the smell was a result of the construction.  Speaking of construction, after check-in we were informed that they were undergoing said renovations and there would be excessive noise 9:00 -17:00.  Considering we had been up for 18 hours this was an issue.  We needed a power nap; it didn’t happen. 

If the staff had been friendly and the renovations complete it would have been a nice stay.  The location was great and the room very nice.",3,2016,06,20
150,Outstanding stay,"Churchill Hyatt is fabulous. Great location, great staff and great property. The Churchill bar mixes some of the best cocktails I've ever had. The rooms are comfortable, have modern amenities and easy to hang out in when you need a break. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,19
150,Exceptional Hotel Stay!,The Hyatt Regency London- The Churchill is amazing!!!  We stayed four nights before our cruise and then returned for an overnight stay.  It's a beautiful hotel from the lovely lobby to the well appointed guest rooms.  The staff is SO professional and very helpful.  We had all of our meals at the hotel.  Our stay at the Hyatt was one of the highlights of our trip to London.,5,2016,06,19
150,One night only - wish we'd been there longer.  So very lovely!,"Beautiful hotel that feels like you've arrived in London. Very close to Oxford street with a lot of shops and near the marble arch from where we took the London big bus tour. Used the hotel concierge transportation from the airport and likely overpaid but it was fantastic to be met at the airport and delivered directly to the hotel with a bit of local commentary along the way. 

The regency club was darling! We weren't around for evening canapés but the breakfast and afternoon snack was delightful. 

Would definitely stay again. ",5,2016,06,18
150,Not so many hotels I visited in whic  I was fully satisfied,"This is true what it is written in the title.I had visited 67 countries and I used to live in not so bad hotels. But in most of them were smaller or bigger malfunctions. Nothing wrong in this hotel ! Room planing is perfect, you can find what you need inside ,staff is extremely friendly , location is perfect-central London. I was looking for the hotel with balcony and i found it .Not so many in London...Churchill bar with terrace is a wonder as well.Not so cheap stay, but life is so short....",5,2016,06,18
150,Very pleasant Pre Cruise stay in an elegant hotel,"This hotel was recommended by Disney. Perfect location - hotel is located in a nice, quiet area two blocks away from marble arch tube station, Selfridges, and the shops at Oxford Street. Rooms are newly renovated and very comfortable. Loved the citrus scented toiletry. Elegant interiors with very friendly staff. Everyone from doorman, concierge (who assisted and booked all our day tours), front desk (at check in, and when I left the key in the room), room service waiter, and even security, were  efficient, courteous and helpful. Great English breakfasts. This one is Five Star, considering I was not even in a club room. ",5,2016,06,17
150,Like sleeping on the clouds,I am fortunate enough to have stayed in many luxury hotels and The Churchill in London is one of my favourites. The location is perfect as it nestled in a relatively quiet part of London whilst being only a short and pleasant walk to many of the more bustling areas of the city. The hotel itself is wonderfully designed with decorations of Winston Churchill memorabilia and one of the most exquisite floral displays of any hotel I have ever seen. There was a superb view of the greenery of The Portman Square Gardens from my room. The bed was so luxuriously soft I wish I didn't have to wake up for breakfast. My stay was short but thanks to the friendly yet professional staff it was perfect in every way!,5,2016,06,16
150,Good location ,"Good location close to underground, tourist bus tour stop and shopping.  Fantastic food at the restaurant.  Very good customer service, check in, concierge and housekeeping.  One drawback was the wifi connection, a bit slow and constant drop offs. 
",4,2016,06,16
150,Comfortable and Close to Public Transportation,Stayed here for 3 nights and loved that it was very close to public transportation.  We had a club room and access to the club lounge that was great.  The room was very nice and had plenty of outlets to charge phones and electronics.  They were undergoing construction but we didn't hear any of it going on.  The staff was very courteous and helpful with directions and suggestions.,5,2016,06,15
150,"Quiet, comfortable, hospitable establishment",London was the last stop on our honeymoon trip through Europe.  We stayed here.  It was just lovely.  They were undergoing construction but we did not hear a peep!  The staff was very helpful and gave us some great recommendations.  They even secured a reservation for us at a nearby restaurant.  We loved the neighborhood.  It was close to everything and yet seemed like a nice suburban area.  We would stay hear again in a heartbeat.  The mixologists in the bar do a great job.  Definitely stop by and have a drink.,5,2016,06,14
150,Lovely Retreat Close to Public Transport,"We stayed three nights at the Hyatt Regency Churchill, and really appreciated its proximity to Underground and bus stations. The staff were very friendly, allowing us to drop our bags after arriving early, emailing us when our room was ready, and delivering our bags so they would be in our room when we returned. We had one of the newly refurbished rooms. The bathroom was spacious, as was the room, and the bed was comfortable. I really appreciated the variety and location of electrical and USB outlets - there were even US plugs in some places. 

We ordered room service one night, and while a bit pricey it was delivered on a wonderfully appointed tray by a very helpful staff member. We would stay at this hotel again.",5,2016,06,14
150,Amazing Hyatt Regency,"Hyatt Regency properties are not supposed to be this luxurious, but the Hyatt Regency London-the Churchill is just that, luxurious.  The only thing I thought was not so great was the fact that the bedroom of the suite was not actually separated from the living room area.  Other than that, it was a pretty amazing property.  The location was quite good, close to a tube station.  The service was also just wonderful.  I would stay there again if other hotels I'd like to try are not available.",5,2016,06,14
150,Great London location,We had a great time in London thanks to our stay at the Churchill. Staff took care of all of our needs and were helpful with all of our questions.  Churchill is not far from Marble Arch Underground station so you can get anywhere in the city if you have an Oyster card.,5,2016,06,14
150,Tranquility in the midst of chaos!,"I have always been an admirer of Hyatt.  In the middle of London, to find a peaceful place to sleep/rest is an indomitable task.  And, yet Hyatt seem to have conquered it at their Portman Sq place.  The rooms are truly roomy (no pun intended), service impeccable (as always) and amenities are of superior quality.  The restaurant food is not up to the mark, but then very few eat at hotel restaurants in London.  All this do not come cheap, but, compared to many other Central London Hotels, I consider this to a good value.",5,2016,06,13
150,Montagu Restaurant - amazing brunch,"We didn't stay at the Hotel, but had booked brunch.

This was the best brunch I gave had, £55 per person but this included an all you can eat 3 course buffet, with beautifully made and presented dishes, the chefs were there to cook some items fresh for you.

Also included was your drinks, including Prosseco, red/white wine, beer, tea, coffee.

The staff were amazing, so polite, friendly and helpful and very very good at their job. We felt thoroughly spoilt and very well looked after.

I would recommend this for anyone that would like to maybe do something different to usual, and although it seemed initially quite expensive, it was worth every penny.",5,2016,06,13
150,Brief one night stay,"We rented a single king sized bed for a one night stay in central London. The hotel is very nice, very clean and has great proximity to everything in the area. Very friendly staff and overall very enjoyable. The rooms have a nice modern feel, it is rather expensive and I feel that mostly has to do with the location. ",5,2016,06,12
150,There will be another stay,"That was my second stay at the Hyatt Regency London. I like this place. Nearby Oxford street and even Piccadilly place. Also short journey to go to a convenient tube station as Bond Street. Easy to go in Easy to go out. 
The room is well equiped and the bathroom, while small, is of friendly usage with a Toto toilet as a great luxury bonus. The Montagu is an agreable place for breakfast or snack. 
Services and crew / clerk are very much paying attention to you and solution providers. 
Will come back : I loved so much my welcome back package ... Big smile !",4,2016,06,11
150,Anniversary Weekend,"Fantastically placed hotel five minute walk from Oxford Street, 10 minutes to Marble Arch/Bond Street.  Staff very friendly and helpful even to finding a post office close by.  This is the second time of staying here we will certainly be back again.",5,2016,06,10
150,5 Star??,"Stayed on the 3rd of June for 1 night, as my wife, daughter and I went to London to see Charlie and the Chocolate factory.  My wife and I have stayed at a number of Four Seasons and Shangri La hotels - nice hotels are our wee treat!

It is a nice hotel, it is in a great location (just off Oxford Street), there is some great Churchill related history, but 5* it certainly wasn't.  We arrived on foot, check in was pretty straight forward, the gentleman was helpful pointing out the location to the theatre (about 20 mins drive); however he seemed to think that we wouldn't own a credit card... and then very strangely suggested that we could go via bus?!  Surely taxi or tube would be far more logical - a bit strange!  Perhaps as we weren't in business dress?

Our room was nice, not huge but nice and clean. There was no bath - a bit disappointing.  The bed was huge and very comfy and they had made a small bed on the floor for my daughter, which was appreciated.

We consulted the concierge before leaving for dinner / the theatre.  The lady was very knowledgeable and suggested a restaurant, although she didn't offer to ring and make a reservation or to check availability (they managed to squeeze us in when we got there).

We had a good nights sleep until 8am when drilling and hammering started in the rooms above!  My wife and I couldn't believe it!  So much for our lie in!  We went for breakfast, which was very busy, we only waited 5 minutes but others waited more.  The food was very varied and very nice.  There was buffet and menu.  Menu food took nearly 20 minutes to arrive, tea and coffee were not quick either - the staff were very frantic due to the busyness.

Overall, excluding the drilling and hammering, the hotel was nice but definitely not 5* from an experience perspective.  But no-one expects to be woken at 8am with works in any hotel. disappointing.

Don't see myself returning.",3,2016,06,10
150,Perfect in every way,"From check in to check out this is a perfect hotel to stay in London. Brilliant staff and high quality hotel . Perfect location, very convenient for Oxford St and Marble Arch. High quality hotel that makes you feel at home. Would highly recommend",5,2016,06,10
150,Great hotel,"Spent 4 nights at The Churchill for business. Had a great stay. Staff were amazing, rooms clean, spacious and well renovated. Close to Oxford Street and the Marble Arch tube station. Hyde Park and Regents Park are in easy walking distance for a morning run.",5,2016,06,09
150,Well worth it,"We had a late arrival with lots of bags. The ease of check-in, the delightful refreshment, the comfort of the room and the general delights of the accommodation made this an unforgettable stay. The Churchill must be very close to the perfect location in central London, and the hotel offers something close to the perfect base. We know Marylebone really quite well. The levels of comfort, tranquillity, service and culinary delight are as superb as anywhere we know in New York or Venice - and, yes, at prices which are worth it for a special visit.",5,2016,06,08
150,Luxurious and welcoming,"Even though our hotel room was next to the lifts, it was lovely and perfectly quiet. Amply sized, great window light, etc. Nice modern bathroom was attached to our room (Japanese toilet, spa shower) though I could have used a tub - ah, first world problems. But seriously a great experience with everything here.

The new renovations of the hotel make everything fresh. It was rather pleasant to walk through. And there was exceptional service from the front desk, notably Pia who helped us through our reservation.",5,2016,06,07
150,Great Location,"Very comfortable room to return to after a long day of touring.  We could not have asked for a better staff, so friendly and welcoming.  I spent my 65th birthday there and was pleasantly surprised with cake and champagne in my room, complements of the hotel.  So special to me!  Overall, exceptional experience.
I would love to know the brand of the mattress and pillows.  I had the best nights sleep and would like to try to duplicate that at home.  Thank you for everything!",5,2016,06,06
150,excellent accommodations and location,"The beds here are first rate; comfortable with plenty of support. The choice of pillows was to our liking as well. The hotel is perfectly located in London's West End: close to bus and tube stops, coffee, eats, and shopping nearby.   The staff checked on our needs multiple times per day, and even noticed from our passports that it was our daughter's birthday. They sent over champagne and a happy birthday cake! What a pleasant surprise.   I would stay here again without hesitation.",5,2016,06,03
150,Superb Afternoon Tea,"Delightful, decadent afternoon tea to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The food was delicious, there was a good selection and seconds were available should you have space for any more.  We added a glass of champagne which complemented the afternoon perfectly.  The staff were, helpful, polite and attentive without being intrusive.  As a special surprise we were served with a plate of divine macarons with an anniversary message on it.  Thank you, we hope to return at some point in the future.",5,2016,06,02
150,"Perfect Location,Silent Rooms,Completely New Rooms.","I stayed at The Last May Weekend here and everything was Perfect. A Newly set up Room, with a small but Perfect bathroom with a Walk in shower. Very good bed ! And Perfect Windows,which is in London not a given Thing.

150,Best Hotel in all of London,"The Hyatt Regency London - Churchill is an amazing hotel and worth the price!  The staff truly takes care of your every need and diligently corrects any errors.   The location was superb being less than 1 mile to walk to any attractions, yet set back on a quiet and lovely street overlooking the park.   I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,06,02
150,Hyatt Churchill; I will Return!,"The staff made me feel welcome and like I was special.  Just got off a cruise in Dover and on the road two hours to London, and felt like stars when we arrived.  The amenities of the room were exceptional.  We were on Club Level and the lounge was a tranquil paradise to energize before a day of sightseeing or an retreat to gather my thoughts before turning in for the night.  A short walk to the Marble Arch Tube, but used taxis most of the time.  Kids would have like more television channel options in English, but loved the hotel.",5,2016,06,01
150,Don't get what you pay for,Very nice hotel over all but terrible WIFI so if you are a business traveler like i was extremely frustrating. Staff tried to do something about it but never got back to me with their solution they promised. Anyway it is what it is.,4,2016,06,01
150,Newly Renovated,"We checked in in the wee hours of the morning after a much delayed flight. Check in was quick and efficient as well as getting our luggage delivered to our room. 
Room service had our order up in very short order. 
The room was beautifully appointed BUT watch out for the 3 legged marble topped tables. They are unstable. I noticed some broken ones in the elevator waiting area so this problem is universal. 
All in all, a delightful 3 day stay.",5,2016,05,29
150,Excellent restaurant and bar!,"The Churchill is a really lovely hotel. We didn't stay in the rooms however we did enjoy cocktails in the bar and dinner in the restaurant. The cocktails were truely amazing. We chose two from the winter warmer menu, Toffee Tree and Edmund's Temptation. The cocktail menu was themed around Narnia. They were certainly worth the wait. After drinks we had a lovely dinner in the restaurant. I simply can't fault the food and the service. It was superb. The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed too. I would definitely go back. Best of all our meal was covered by my Hyatt loyalty points.",4,2016,05,28
150,"Downing Street, The Eye, Buckingham Palace","This property is in close proximity to Big Ben, London Bridge and all the other hot spots in the title of the review.  They are very accommodating to specific guest needs. I had some guest dropping us off at the hotel, and the doorman allowed to park in a designated spot for 30 minutes. I was very impressed.",5,2016,05,28
150,Chefs table,"What a lovely hotel, fantastic service friendly staff amazing bedroom view over Portman Square, great amenities, buzzing friendly lively bar, outside terrace & a Chefs table what an experience :) we will be back.....",5,2016,05,27
150,Well kept property in nice location,Great location across from Portman Sq. close to Oxford St if you want to shop but also near higher end neighborhoods. We walked to most of the east side London from hotel. Rooms a good size. Friends with us complained about how small their bathroom was. Clean rooms with good amenities. Was surprised there was only a tea kettle with instant coffee.  Buffet was good if included. If not very expensive . Plenty of places within 5 minute walk. Had lunch in lobby restaurant and it was good . Churchill bar is a must but at least $15 US a cocktail. This is a 4.5 star property. Maybe staying on club level would make it a 5. Great wifi and a printer right in lobby. More international flair than British. Recommend but will try a different neighborhood next time. Portman Sq view was nice and quiet. Good windows that you can actually open.,4,2016,05,27
150,Loved this hotel,"My wife and I loved this hotel. Well appointed, comfortable rooms. Very helpful, happy staff, great bar and the Lacanda Locatelli restaurant attached to the hotel had super food.

The hotel had a terrific lobby to relax after a day of sightseeing and shopping. Free wifi with easy access.

The hotel is in a terrific location. We will definitely go back.",5,2016,05,26
150,A great location for central london,A great location central to all the major attractions for the city. Very attentive staff helpful all the time. Rooms and hotel look great especially the newly renovated room which we had one  A little pricey but we have to remember that this is London. Good for business travel keeps to the Hyatt standards or couples. Did not try the restaurants,5,2016,05,26
150,worst service ever,I have never been in such a bad hotel.We had checked out of the montagu place hotel as I had hyatt points expiring and wanted to use them-after the staff being so awesome and they could not do enough for us-it was a nightmare-we were warned how horrible the hotel was but it was worse then expected,1,2016,05,25
150,Gem at the heart of the city!,"My two children and I stayed at this fabulous hotel during the May bank holiday weekend. The hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms are very tasteful in design and our particular favourite was the huge, comfortable bed. The staff are fabulous and looked after us with attentive care. Breakfast was probably the highlight for my girls, who relished in the variety of delights on offer. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,05,24
150,A great hotel to stay while in London,"The Hyatt Regency London- The Churchill offers everything you are looking for in a city hotel. Convenient location, excellent service including room service, quite and pleasant  rooms, a good restaurant and a very good bar, high speed internet, valet parking. If you happen to hold a Hyatt Gold Passport that entitles you to stay in Executive floors, The Hyatt Executive lounge is outstanding. I strongly recommend this hotel and certainly shall stay there when I am back to London.
I hope that I could have helped you.",5,2016,05,23
150,"Excellent Location, Staff and Rooms","The hotel is located in a very good location, just off the Marble Arch stop on the Tube.  Very easy to access public transportation or walk to many locations.   The room and bathroom were both very nice and comfortable - large for a downtown hotel.  The shower head was extremely low though.  Both myself and my husband had to duck down to get our heads wet. Regency Club is great.  Good selection of wine and the staff goes out of their way to accommodate guests",5,2016,05,23
150,Amazing,"My friends and I stayed there for about two days and had an amazing stay. We particularly liked the bar, really good service and amazing choice of cigars/ drinks and many other things. However, it is quite pricey but I would definitely recommend this place if you pass through London, one of the best hotel.",5,2016,05,21
150,"Newly renovated, great location","Portman Sq is convenient to Oxford Street shopping and the Red Line of the Tube. The rooms at the Churchill are newly renovated (still working on the 2nd floor at present, but we didn't notice any noise. Rooms are good sized, beds very comfy. Great service.",5,2016,05,21
150,Wonderful,"I just completed a 3 night stay at The Churchill, and it was very pleasant.  I requested one of the newly refurbished rooms; it was attractive, comfortable and very quiet.  The floor I was on was heavily populated, but the hotel is so well insulated I never heard voices or activity in the hallways.  

The staff was excellent all around; everyone I had contact with was professional, warm and polite.  The overall look of the hotel is elegant and upmarket.  The location in Portman Square is very convenient to public transportation (short walk from the Marble Arch Tube station), shopping and sight seeing.  

I would absolutely stay here again; this is one of the best hotel experiences I've had in the last year.",5,2016,05,21
150,"Great staff, location, lobby and club","The staff at the Churchill were great.  The location and lobby decorations were great as well.    The Regency Club was a fabulous place to enjoy breakfast and an afternoon happy hour.  The only downfall were the rooms.  They were clean and nice, but not worthy of a fifth star.  ",4,2016,05,20
150,Even better than last time!,"We returned to the Hyatt Churchill this month and found it even better than last stay. The service was superb - friendly, professional, and caring. The hotel is classy, safe and beautifully finished. Excellent location near Hyde Park, Regents Park, and, it appears, many wealthy people. As returning Diamond members, got a personal note from the hotel manager. The lounge is one of he best I have ever visited! The lounge staff were incredible - We want to recognize Violetta, Carla, and Chu Vo Dam. Great job!",5,2016,05,20
150,The place to be,"The Churchill is in a great location. It's in the heart of the  West End, close to Marble Arch and Oxford Street. It's not cheap but it's close to many pobs and diffferent restaurants where you don'y have to spend a fortune. If you want to be pampered, the Churchill is the place to be. Nothing is foo much trouble and the staff really do look after you well.  We loved being there.",4,2016,05,20
150,Excellent customer service,"Absolutely fantastic service at this centrally located hotel. We had a refurbished room which had pretty much every amenity you would need for a weekend away. The Regency Club was a great bonus, but is at extra cost - worth it if you enjoy that kind of thing - drinks on tap, canapés, hearty breakfasts, all day snacks, drinks and papers in a peaceful environment. I can't wait to go back.",5,2016,05,18
150,Excellent says it all,"Super convenient location near Marble Arch Underground station, open and bright lobby, friendly & unpretentious service, lovely bed, best shower I've had in the UK, great club lounge. Simply an excellent choice for business or leisure travel.",5,2016,05,18
150,expensive for no good reason,"I like to stay at the Churchil hotel because of sentimental values.Over the years it has deteriorated.It has lost its charisma and and character and became just a typical chain hotel . The rooms are small,the lobby is almost none existent and there is only one restaurant.We have been asked to move because it was being prepared for lunch and we were then asked to move again from the outside area which looked like  part of the lobby but actually it was not.Some of the staff in the restaurant are blunt .I think for the price I paid for 2 nights my expectations were very far from met.",3,2016,05,18
150,Perfect stay,"Recommend for business and with family! The location is great, walking distance to Hyde park, Oxford Street and excellent restaurants close by.  For business, excelent to bring clients for lunch and dinner.  With family, good for kids due to local attractions close to the hotel.",5,2016,05,17
150,Lovely hotel in a great location,The hotel was very clean and staff were very friendly.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  The surrounding area is quiet but there is a nearby tube station and shopping area.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2016,05,17
150,superb location and property,"We spent 5 days at the Hyatt Regency/Churchill in February.  The hotel is wonderfully located, just a couple of blocks of Oxford Street, between Marble Arch and Bond St tube stations.  It is across from a square, so despite the central location, it is very peaceful. The rooms are comfortable, well-appointed and quite big and most of the rooms (probably all by now) have been renovated. If you can, book a room at the concierge level - you will get a wonderful buffet breakfast and appetizers/light dinner in the evening (including drinks). Will definitely be my first choice in any future trip to London.",5,2016,05,16
150,Great stay,"Loved the location, a little outside all the main sites. This was a plus as the street was quite.  2 blocks from the underground station. Wonderful club lounge serving food and drinks all day. Churchills bar was great, with amazing cocktails. We will return to this hotel when our travels bring us back to London.",5,2016,05,14
150,Convenient location filled with elegance,"This is our second time staying at the Churchill since they have been remodeling. Each time we were concerned that our stay might be disruptive and both times we barely heard any work going on. The lobby is inviting and the staff are gracious and knowledgable. The bathroom has very ""special"" amenities...",5,2016,05,14
150,Absolutely Amazing Stay,We stayed at The Churchill on the last night of our honeymoon. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the hotel was absolutely breathtaking. They even comped up a bottle of champagne and a dessert to celebrate our honeymoon. I can recommend The Churchill enough!,5,2016,05,12
150,Excellent Location and warm welcome,The hotel is located right off Oxford Street where shopping is fun. Staff are very dedicated. Check in and out process is very smooth and takes no time. I truly enjoyed my stay and look forward to my next  visit Adel,5,2016,05,11
150,Great location; first class hotel,"This is a great hotel, it’s been around for a quite a while, but has recently been completely renovated and all the rooms are newly decorated, very tasteful; beautiful dining hall, spectacular afternoon tea.  Great central location for shopping, theatres, museums.",5,2016,05,09
150,Fantastic hotel in amazing location,Myself and my wife headed away for a few days in London. We stayed 2 nights here and had a fantastic time. The room was huge with a real 5 star feel. The food was amazing and the chocolate fondant is highly recommended.,5,2016,05,08
150,Supercilious staff - v pretentious,"Had a great meal in the hotel restaurant but the staff in the hotel bar were incredibly rude, patronising and made us want to leave. Not a place to have a relaxing cocktail or two. Go to the Landau instead. The staff there are very welcoming and helpful.",1,2016,05,07
150,"Hyatt the Churchill, Excellent Hotel.","Stayed for 5 nights, visiting London for a short holiday.
Very nice, luxurious and comfortable hotel, with a great location that is close to Oxford Street, and other attractions.
The Staff are fantastic and very friendly in deed.
Excellent hotel.
",5,2016,05,07
150,Style over substance ,"I should start this review by saying that I've been spoilt in the past and eaten afternoon tea at the Burj in Dubai, which by the way is fabulous if you're ever over there! Having said that, I have also eaten afternoon tea in small coffee shops and have to say that the tea I took at the Hyatt was my most disappointing.

The dining room is lovely and the live pianist creates a lovely atmosphere to relax. I had booked the Haute 'fashion themed' afternoon tea as a birthday treat for my cousin following a shopping trip to selfridges earlier in the day.

The staff were polite and professional and got us seated at a lovely table with pretty china and crisp linen on the table. We picked our teas; I chose the rooibos tirimisu which was just lovely and I would highly recommend it. There was also a needle and thread cocktail included in our tea; I don't know what was in it, but it was delicious and they didn't skimp on the alcohol in it!

Unfortunately things started to go downhill a little from here. Our sandwiches platter arrived and although it looked beautiful it was cold (which reduces flavours), the bread on some was a little dry and overall it was quite tasteless. I really do think it would have been better if these hadn't been taken straight out of a refrigerator and served to us.

Next we were presented with a little box of scones, my favourite part of afternoon tea. The scones,
Although on the small side, tasted delicious and were nice and soft and well baked. The cream and lemon curd were smooth and flavoursome but the jam was pretty disappointing; far too running and thin and how can anyone remove the flavour from homemade strawberry jam?

For the cake element, two dramatic glass bell jars were bought to our table containing a variety of fashion themed treats. You can see from the photo they look fabulous but they lacked taste completely! One was supposed to be a layered liquorice dessert but it didn't taste of liquorice at all?! The shoes was made of chocolate which tasted like cheap cooking chocolate and even the dress biscuit did not taste crunchy and buttery. The miniature Swiss roll had also come out of the fridge and was cold and absolutely tasteless. Since this was the final element to our tea we were left somewhat disappointed. 

The slight saving grace was that for my cousins birthday they did bring out 3 miniature cheese cakes with a message on the plate that I had requested. By this point however we didn't want anything else sweet and so we asked for them to be boxed up to take home.

Then the bill came... Fortunately I had booked through a website and received 25% off the tea but even still, two afternoon teas, with a bottle of water and two extra cocktails came to £121! Without the discount it would have been £144; Champagne afternoon tea at the Burj was less! The cocktails, although tasty were £16 each which I think, even for a London hotel, is expensive. 

I've had much better in London (Royal Garden Hotel being one) in terms of both the quality of the food, value for money and also the setting; although there is a park opposite the hotel, the view out the windows in the Churchill is at street level and you can only really see parked cars and a fence! 

Although a dining experience is partly what the food looks like, this doesn't matter once it's in your mouth and this is what let it down.

Would I go back? Only for a cup of tea.",3,2016,05,06
150,best ever!!!,"great location, excellent rooms and service. the stuff was was very friendly we had a great time!  the bar was great and the restaurant was amazing  the facilities was great  we would defiantly return to this hotel",5,2016,05,06
150,Exceeded Expectations,"We had a small suite on one of the Regency Club floors. The physical plant is quite luxurious. Service in the Regency Club, and throughout the hotel, was extremely good. Two of the the three televisions were not getting very many channels, but we had no time or interest in watching TV. The location was good but not as good as some other hotels where we have stayed, but this trip we did not care that much.",5,2016,05,05
150,"5 stars, in spite of a minor flaw or two.  Highly recommend","The negatives: a poorly designed shower, walk in minus a door. No matter how hard we tried, the water ended up on the bathroom floor and we had to use towels to mop. Needed one more ceiling light as there's a small dark area in the bedroom. And finally, a server, young and from Italy, announced his dislike of Spanish wine after we ordered a bottle.
 Now for the five stars: beautiful place with a remodeled room, great check in at noon, perfect bed, free wifi that worked, two bottles of water included daily, excellent cleaning, nice doormen, really great receptionists, wonderful location, fast elevators. Our biggest surprise was dinner at the hotel. On our last night we were exhausted and figured we'd get average and overpriced food. We didn't care. We ordered the prefixe two course meal. I got delightful lobster bisque and my spouse had an artisically designed at cheese/beet/fig/arugula plate that he loved. We both chose sea bass that was excellent! We also split a dessert of sticky toffee pudding that was really plenty for two. With the bottle of wine and gratuity we paid Â£99. It was worth the money for arguably the best meal we had in 6 nights in London.",5,2016,05,04
150,First-rate,"My girlfriend and I just returned from a two-night stay at the Churchill. We both loved it. The building is elegant and stately, overlooking Portman Square. We were greeted very warmly at reception, and every staff member with whom we interacted was impeccably gracious. Our room was thoroughly comfortable and offered a nice view of the park; I enjoyed watching people play tennis from several stories up. The Churchill Bar & Terrace within the hotel is beautifully designed with an art deco theme and concocts exceptional cocktails - I had an old fashioned served out of a shiny teapot, a nod to the way things were during prohibition. We didn't dine there but we did order room service and it was excellent. The person who checked us out as we were leaving was about as kind as can be imagined, and I think I'll come back next time I'm in town.",5,2016,05,04
150,Hyatt- Loaction! Location! Location!,"Very nice hotel/ expected of Hyatt.... However, the location is what gets this place 5+ stars.  Literally 2 blocks from Oxford Street.... If you have never been to London, this is location is like Beverly Hills, CA but colder :)   Safe, clean would stay again.",5,2016,05,03
150,Great location ,"This is a lovely hotel. Check in was quick and easy and staff are very friendly and professional. Rooms are modern and comfortable. The location makes it an easy walk to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and many restaurants and attractions. The restaurant is very good. I am a picky eater and was quite pleased with the menu and quality of the food. But just a word of caution, tip is included in your bill so be sure to check it carefully.",4,2016,05,03
150,Truly 5*,"It's a special place to stay, for sure - hotel is lovely, you get that ""wow"" factor when you walk through the door (unless you're used to staying in 5* hotels all the time!). Rooms are good - we had a standard with view and while not the biggest hotel room I've stayed in, it was certainly ample. The service from the team is excellent, everyone was very personable. It's ideally located for anyone wanting to explore any part of London - Oxford Street is a hop-skip-jump down the road; Marble Arch (central line) a short, 3 min walk; and Hyde Park just over the road from there.",5,2016,05,03
150,Another Wonderful Stay at The Churchill,We have stayed here for over 10 years and we love this place great location. The Club is worth the extra money although I am a Diamond I have paid for access to in the past. We come here at least once a year most years 3 or 4 times we love it.,5,2016,05,02
150,Churchill back on form,"Stayed at the Churchill for the first time in a couple of years.  I'd given up on it after a couple of poor experiences, including being bumped when they were over-booked.       Really pleased to say, that it's back on form. Although the refurbishment isn't finished, it just seems to be back to a solid five-star hotel.  I stayed in one of the refurbished rooms - an excellent mix of understated luxury and business efficiency.   Staff great, breakfast well worth the price. The one downside - room service is woefully overpriced, even by London standards - £30 for a very average curry that tasted warmed up.  Given the plethora of good restaurants and bistros nearby, I'd just pop out for far better value.",5,2016,05,02
150,Great Location,"Stayed one night recently in a standard double.  Room was large for a London hotel and was spotless.  Bathroom, though compact had quality fittings and excellent shower. tea making was a bonus. Also surprisingly quiet. Service was prompt throughout and very courteous. Recommended.",4,2016,05,01
150,enjoyable,"i have stayed in this hotel for 4 night, as i always like to stay in this hotel, the location and luxury is a key point, vary close to oxford street, marble arch,and Hyde park.
close to underground. staff ware helpful and friendly.",5,2016,05,01
150,Been several times to London however staying at the Hyatt has been the best experience so far.,This has been my best stay experience so far at a hotel in London. I have been travelling and staying at hotels in London for the past 15 years but nothing beats the recent Hyatt experience. The location is great and close to a couple of metro stations within 5/10 minutes walking distance. Also plenty of restaurants in the vicinity.,5,2016,04,30
150,"Great location and very friendly staff, with one big scratch in the ""painting""","My wife and I were going to spend a few days in London and we finally selected the Churchill partly because of the price, but also the lounge access and upgrade we were offered.
The hotel overlooks Portman Square and a nice little park, just 2 minutes walk from Marble Arch and Oxford Street.
The check in was extremely good as we had such a wonderful receptionist with a good sense of humour and a sense of the necessary details.
The room was clean and spacious (Regency Club category). Although the hotel's website says, that it is noisy due to renovation we did not hear a thing, so you can ignore that warning. Our room was overlooking the little park and had sunlight during the day.
The lounge was very nice, never overcrowded and with a good selection at breakfast as well as during the late afternoon, where you can almost have your starter before you head out for dinner. The quality is excellent and the staff is over you like a hawk. This turned out a bit negative for us as my wife one morning entered with the slippers provided in the room. The young lady told her that this was not allowed although the preceding days other guests, but from the Middle East, happily entered the lounge the same way. On that topic there was hardly any pork items to be seen, which is something that really irritates me. When I lived in the Middle East I could not have what I used to have, so why should it be different now? Many hotels are so eager to cater for this segment of their customers, and thereby they ignore a huge and mature customer base.
Throughout the hotel the staff was very friendly, in particular the concierge and the doormen.
The bar and cafe at the street level is really nice and in particular their coffee is great.
If you are in for a bit of history, then there is a nice little shop selling Churchill souvenirs. 
The wifi is free and works seamless. You are only prompted once a day if you want to extend it and in between it works fine. There is no need to upgrade to a faster connection.",4,2016,04,29
150,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"This is my second time staying at this hotel and I just love the design and appeal of this hotel.  The hotel is modern, nice size rooms with a beautiful lobby and open restaurant area.   The Churchill Bar and outside patio are great for cocktails outside and smoking a cigar.   The location is excellent and a few blocks from Marble Arch and Oxford Street.",5,2016,04,29
150,a great stay,we stayed at the churchill for 2 days and it was great. staff was great and would open the doors for you and ask if you needed help with anything. the fresh fruit flavored water in the lobby was a refreshing touch. rooms were nice we had a king suite i believe with living room. nice bathroom. i feel like the hallways are narrow and need a update and they need a couple electric converters for world travelers like myself because the wattage was tricky even with my converter. overall great hotel,4,2016,04,28
150,"Churchill Hotel, London","I stayed on the executive floor and found all the staff very friendly  and helpful.  The room was well appointed, clean and very quiet.  The overall service in the hotel was excellent and will definitely stay again.",5,2016,04,28
150,Top notch hotel,"The London Churchill Hyatt is a first class operation. The front desk, staff, cleaning folks and everyone else who works there cannot do enough for you.
We stayed here for three nights. Two of the nights were reward nights, the other I paid for. This hotel is not inexpensive, but not much in London is. You get what you pay for.
Our room was on the fifth floor overlooking the park across the street (Portman Square). The street out in front is somewhat busy, but the room was always quiet, and we slept well on the very comfortable beds. The bath was beautifully done in marble, tile and glass, and it was immaculate. The only flaw, and this is very minor, was that water from the shower sprayed on the bathroom floor. It was a walk-in shower without a door.
We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but we did have drinks at the bar one night. The bartender was very friendly and took good care of us.
In summary, this is a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it without reservation.
",5,2016,04,27
150,Fantastic West End Oasis,"I was scheduled to stay at the Churchill in January 2015 - but they had a small explosion in the kitchen a few weeks earlier and so closed for several months. I jumped at the chance to stay there during my recent visit to London. The Portman Square location - very close to shops and theater - is quiet and truly lovely. I had a terrific breakfast at the Montagu restaurant. My room, though close to the elevator, was quiet and had a Japanese toilet - very efficient. The Churchill is one of my favorite London hotels.",5,2016,04,26
150,Great Stay,"Great hotel in a great location.  Very polite staff and rooms are extremely comfortable.  We had a 6 year old with us and for a 5* hotel with a certain clientele, the staff could not have been more friendly and everybody went out of their way to make him feel welcome.  The rooms were comfortable and plenty big enough for 3 people without feeling cramped.  Would stay there again.",5,2016,04,26
150,Great weekend,"Had a great weekend really nice hotel and the staff are really helpful 
Defiantly recommend .
Near shops and great night life 
Will defiantly will book again
Food is top class with a good selection on the menu",5,2016,04,25
150,Excellent for Business or Pleasure!,"The moment you arrive, you can see and feel the warmth and charm of the Churchill. Check-in was simple and our room was wonderful!  Many fabulous restaurants with impeccable service and delicious food.  A short stroll to Marble Arch, Oxford Street, Hyde Park and the Tube makes it the perfect location for people on business or holidays - 5/5 stars .",5,2016,04,25
150,Best place in London for a cigar,"The Churchill Bar in the lobby of the Hyatt is a wonderful hidden place of London. I've been coming here for years for a cigar and a drink with friends and colleagues. The general ambiance of the place is laid back with just the right amount of class. The service is impeccable as it should be and the prices are within the London range, overall a great place!",5,2016,04,24
150,An excellent business hotel but much more,"There are many choices in London, the Churchill is our choice because they deliver through the service. The staff is attentive, will try to make you feel comfortable. The hotel uses a bit of whimsy to differentiate itself (association with the Saatchi art gallery); it has a Michelin star Italian restaurant within its walls . The hotel has just been through a major remodeling exercise and the rooms (and bathrooms) are now more comfortable than ever . We come very often and they do cocoon us, a very rare experience in a business hotel.",5,2016,04,23
150,First visit to London,"First stay in London. Centrally located, staff helpful, rooms are spacious, bar is welcoming !  Great place for families with teenagers and older kids.  Clean ! Would recommend ! Plan on staying there on our next visit to London!",5,2016,04,21
150,"Great Rooms , Great Staffs , Best Hotel in London","Its one of the best hotels i have stayed so far during my honeymoon tour in Europe . Especially the rooms are huge , clean and modern . Toilets are clean and the house keeping service is 5/5 stars . The unsung heroes behind really did a good job by maintaining the room at its highest standard . I would like to commend a front reception staff , his name is Ashley . He kept in mind that we are on our Honeymoon and upgraded us to a much bigger room with a good view . He even advised me to use certain Wifi connection to ensure i can check my emails real time everyday .Very well versed on Good food and shopping directions/ areas . Answered to every of my queries with his best attitude . Even on the last day , he knew that we have 3-4 hours after the initial check out , he would extend the checkout time for us and even after we checked out , we still had 2 hours out , he then upgrade us for an access to the lounge to at least make our time comfortable while waiting to go to the airport . Top notch services + super room conditions + centralised location .  I would say this hotel is one of the best for the price . I am a frequent traveller , and even those pricer hotels does not give me the same feeling as in Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill . These comments are real , from the bottom of our heart . We had a great time staying there . Will definitely go back if i am travelling to London . Soon I hope . Good Day and please commend/reward Ashley , very hard to find such passionate staff these days .",5,2016,04,17
150,One Of The Best In Town,Previous review stated an old friend and a pleasure to stay here again. The staff have always and in my opinion continue to make your stay easy and relaxing. Nothing seems too much. Compared on price to similar hotels in the are I believe they are also value for money.,5,2016,04,16
150,Beautiful and elegant hotel in Marylebone ,"We checked in after an overnight flight from New York. What a beautiful place. After a nap, we headed down for Afternoon Tea. Delicious and decadent. (See photos). Room was small but well appointed. Loved the area. Could walk anywhere. Great shopping and restaurants nearby. Friendly staff. ",5,2016,04,14
150,still have some rooms for improvement,"The hotel location is good for shopping, hairdressers etc. Breakfast was good, coffee excellent (go for the buffet option), the winter terrace is perfect for a romantic evening with nice decoration and great drink. Room is clean. Check in and out are prompt. However there are some room for improvement for the service. For the breakfast, everything went smooth, but for lunch, the waiter seems to be an intern so he had little experience and he has difficulties in understanding our ""asian"" accent (while others can fully understand). For our dinner in the terrace, each waiter/waitress seems to be in charged of certain table, so if we ordered from someone else (rather than the waitress in charged), she seems to be unhappy. Furthermore, we ordered red wine and cocktails, she gave us 2 glasses of cognac (order from other table). My husband accepted that he could abandon red wine to the cognac that she gave us, while I still want my cocktail. At the end, the waitress asked if we want to pay for the cognac, and I said yes, but only for one glass as I had my cocktail and only my husband had cognac. She seems to be very unhappy, that made us feel uncomfortable.",4,2016,04,13
150,Excellent short stay,"From the moment we checked in, the staff made us feel very welcome and this was the case throughout our stay. Excellent evening meal at The Montague restaurant.  The hotel is extremely well located and very close to Marble Arch at the top end of Oxford street. Ver efficieynt and well run hotel!",4,2016,04,12
150,"Flawless service, great dinner","Stayed for two nights for the first half of our UK trip with friends, will be back to the same hotel after our 3 days trip north to Liverpool, Lake district and Birmingham.
We have booked two rooms and we have requested a connecting room which was kindly arranged.

Airport transport by Hotel was smooth, we were picked up at the arrival hall and the ride back to hotel was comfortable. 120GBP for airport pick up is quite reasonable for a group of five like us.

The hotel was centrally located and convenient. Blocks away from Oxford street and shopping area. 

We were given early checkin which really means a lot to us as we travelled red eyed flight to London. Check in staffs were friendly and welcoming. In fact, my friends (who don't stay at Hyatt properties as much as I do) are very impressed with the efficiency and the service with the checkin staffs.

Hotel rooms are quite nice, size was not huge but adequate. As we are traveling in a party of five with two rooms booked, an extra bed was set up when we were out for sightseeing, and extra pairs of slippers and shower amenities were placed inside the room. This is what I called a flawless service.

We tried the Chef's table in the Hotel restaurant. The service was again, top notch. Manager Mr Bhaskar has a good knowledge in different wine and food combinations, great and in depth introduction was given. Our chef has prepared great dishes and my guest had really good time dining at the Chef's table.

As we will be coming back to stay again in Hyatt London Churchill after visiting Liverpool and Birmingham, our heavy luggages were left and stored in the hotel which is super convenient to us.

I always love Hyatt brand for its consistency of service quality all around the world and in fact, Hyatt London Churchill is, in my opinion, one of the best Hyatt properties that I have ever stayed.

I am really happy with this stay as all my guests were impressed of what I have recommended to them.

150,Great visit to London,Used a suite upgrade(from Hyatt) for each of two rooms on spring break last month. Regency lounge was very convenient for breakfast each day. Drinks and appetizers before going out in the evening were excellent as well. Concierges and front desk were quite helpful in helping with dinner reservations and directions about town. Would absolutely return.,5,2016,04,11
150,"Central hotel, welcoming staff","Had a recent stay at this hotel and aside from one major fault, this hotel is a great place to stay while visiting London.  The hotel is centrally located near the Marble Arch and Bond St tube stops in a quieter area just off Oxford.

When I was checked in, the agent was courteous and helpful, though as a Hyatt Diamond member, she told me that I could check in on the 8th Floor at the Regency Club/Concierge. It is unfortunate that no where in the correspondence I received prior to my stay or on the website is this information conveyed.  Nevertheless, the agent was professional and I was on my way.

The Regency Club is nicely appointed, though small enough that one can hear other people's conversations or children screaming in the smaller room adjoining the main club area.

The staff at the Club were friendly and while I was not able to partake in the afternoon hors d'Oeuvres, the breakfast was well balanced and nicely presented.

The room was quite nice, old but spacious for London.  The hotel is undergoing refurbishment (due to a fire a couple of years ago and to refresh the hotels design) so there is construction noise during the day.  I am not sure if the floor I was on had been renovated but the bed was firm and offered a nice night's sleep. The one major complaint I had was the horrible (near non-existent) internet access.  I was told that there were some problems but only one complaint that evening. I spent about 30 minutes trying to work with iBahn (the internet provider for the hotel) and was repeatedly told that there were no noted issues and that my area was being serviced properly.  I told the agent that I had very limited access on my laptop AND 2 mobile phones!  While the service was good for another 30 minutes, it returned to the very poor speed.  I complained to the Regency Club Concierge the next day and was told that there were known issues and it may be due to the renovations. Sadly, as I needed to get some work completed and internet access is a requisite, I was disappointed by this explanation provided only at checkout (and not noted by the employee or service desk the night before).   No accommodation was provided for the dismal internet service which can be a critical limitation for those who may need to work and download files while at the hotel.  While a note was made in my file, I doubt this information was passed up to management.

To add insult, I was charged (reversed) for the phone call which was patched by the Regency Club staff. I also did not receive my amenity points as offered to Diamond guests.

Overall, a very nice hotel, solid bones and will hopefully return to its stellar reputation once all the repairs are completed.",4,2016,04,10
150,Evening dinner ,"Went for dinner and drinks only , didnot stay but imagine should be good 
First went to there bar experienced good cocktails and cigars as well
Dinner was in the resturant which had open space I felt too close to lobby likf the fish preparation and starters with prawns 
The most I liked was the dessert with melting chocolate with brownies and Ice cream very close to bond street ",4,2016,04,09
150,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","The hotel is pricey and we were fortunate to use some Hyatt points to be able to book two rooms for our family for the week.  We were greeted warmly upon check-in by the doorman, porter, and front desk employees.  The woman who checked us in even walked us to the elevator to demonstrate using our keycard to activate the elevator.  It wasn't necessary but nice of her to do so.  Our rooms were recently renovated and very nicely done.  The bathroom even had a Toto washlet toilet and waterfall showerhead.  Not too long after we were situated in our rooms, a plate of apples with a card was delivered to welcome us to the hotel.

The hotel is located about two blocks away (on a quieter but busy street) from Oxford Street with lots of shopping and restaurants.  Selfridges and Marks & Spencer is a short walk away and have great food halls.  We used the Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations which were not too far to walk to. (If you're going to the Warner Bros. Harry Potter tour, It's better to take a cab to the Euston Railway station.)

We used the hotel car service to and from the airport.  We just e-mailed the hotel concierge and had it booked it a few months before our trip.  It was worth the $$ and less hassle for our family of five.

We enjoyed our stay and appreciated the friendliness of the staff.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,07
150,Luxury Hotel in London,"I visited the hotel with my best friend, we booked the hotel in London and also in Hyatt in Birmingham city
The hotel is in middle of London, room was perfect staff was very friendly food was very tasty specially the breakfast lots of verities.
Regency club was made for regency suites, very private we enjoyed the afternoon tea and canapé with drinks at the evening are including the suite package.
We were entitle to have light breakfast in the regency club however we loved the breakfast in the main restaurant it was perfect for us. ",5,2016,04,05
150,Hyatt Regency Churchill,"This hotel always provides very friendly and family like atmosphere whenever I travel to London either on business, leisure or family purpose. Last 10 years it is my only address in London and they never let me down with my selection. They still have some room to improve specially in Churchill bar, specifically their outdoor table conditions, min spending of 25 GBP, even for hotel customer including Hyatt Gold Passport members, must be revisited.",4,2016,04,03
150,Top Notch Service,"Great customer service. Hotel accommodated my request for access to the Executive Lounge despite my not qualifying by membership status given the duration of my stay (one month). Prior to booking my stay at The Churchill, I requested lounge access at the Park Lane Hilton who refused my request for lounge access based on my membership status - not only poor customer service but penny wise/pound foolish considering the revenue loss for a months stay at a not inexpensive hotel versus the minimal cost of granting a repeat customer executive lounge access.  Hilton is off my list and Hyatt is on!",4,2016,04,01
150,Concert in London,"Got the opportunity to see a concert at the O2 arena in London  and see the city. I flew in from New York and landed at 7:00 AM London time. From London Heathrow, hotel is either 35 minutes if you take the express train or over 1 hour if you take local train. We opted for the express ($110 US -Roundtrip for 2). Staff was accommodating with early check-in. We got an updated room as the hotel currently is modernizing all rooms. Hotel is well situated for site seeing. It's near Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. Concierge was very helpful with travel assistance and setting up the Tour Bus. Best to travel by subway (tube) to get around. London can be a expense town.",4,2016,03,31
150,Beautiful hotel with a great location,"I had an appointment with friends at this hotel. It was easy to find and was located just a few steps from Selfridges, which is a plus for those into shopping. The building was beautiful and the doormen friendly. Though when I was standing in front of the restaurant, no staff bothered to ask if they could be any help. I then had to find my own way to the Churchill bar where I had my appointment.",4,2016,03,31
150,Perfect mini vacation,"Superb facilities from the bedroom through to the Executive lounge where we enjoyed a  comprehensive breakfast which kept us going through a busy day. Refreshments in the evening set us up for dinner.
A fabulous hotel from all aspects.",5,2016,03,29
150,Great Location + Excellent staff,"The location of this hotel is superb, walking distance to top notch shopping, restaurants and attractions. The staff is very pleasant and helpful and everyone we encountered made us feel very welcome. I travel a lot and it is not often that a hotel impresses me in so many ways. Our suite on the 9th floor had a balcony which is so nice is a city like London.",5,2016,03,29
150,"Great location, great staff, great breakfast, great hotel.","Certainly not the cheapest hotel but worth every penny if you can afford it. Had a family Bank Holiday Weekend here and couldn't fault it.
Great location, great staff, great breakfast, great hotel. 
Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,29
150,Great staff,"We recently spent a too-short three days in London.  The Churchill standard room was large (by London standards) and luxurious.  Every staff member was attentive and  friendly.  The breakfast buffet was quite good, although somewhat pricy.",5,2016,03,28
150,Over 35 years of great services and hospitality,"Excellent location, services and a great atmosphere! There is great improvement too with the new Churchill Bar, cigar place and the newly furnished rooms. The breakfast is always excellent. I have stayed there since I was 13!",5,2016,03,28
150,"Monday, March 29th","Outstanding!!  This hotel is everything that a high-end Hyatt should represent.  Courteous and knowledgeable staff.  Great location.  Amazing and tranquil park across the street.  Room service and restaurant were all very top-notch.  A few extra pounds than some other local hotels, but WAY WORTH every extra penny.  Very attentive to my 3 children, all boys (12,10,7)",5,2016,03,28
150,Normal high standard!,"Stayed for one night - lovely room with extremely comfortable bedding. Exec room with access to the exec lounge, which served a wide variety of buffet fare, plus hot scrambled eggs and frittata for breakfast.  Staff acrodd the hotel wer all smiley, friendly and efficient. Hyatt never disappoints!",5,2016,03,27
150,It feels like (a nicer version) of home,"This is a really special property.   First off - the location is amazing. So central to so many things in London. The Staff was great at the front desk and at the restaurant, where we ate dinner after a late arrival.   The rooms look like they have just been redone, and are well appointed. I slept like a rock in the bed, and there were chargers/electrical outlets right next to either side of the bed, which was key for me.   My room was upgraded to have a view of the park - which I hear you can rent as a guest of the hotel for events like weddings and parties. They have exclusive rights to the space.   This is probably one of the nicer Hyatt Regency properties I've stayed in. Would definitely recommend to a friend or colleague. 9.9/10.",5,2016,03,26
150,Absolutely gorgeous!,The room was gorgeous. Bathroom nicely sized and beautifully appointed. Every staff member we encountered was lovely and extremely helpful! The neighborhood was centrally located. Can't wait to go back.,5,2016,03,23
150,Great location near Selfridges,"If you like to walk you can reach Oxford street, Bond street, Piccadilly, Covent Garden etc your feet will tell you when it is too much. 
Friendly check in. Was given a refurbished room with a nice view. Initial impression was very good, ok size, nice setup. Bathroom small and bathtub has been replaced by a large walk-in shower. All looked like a great start until I started hearing voices even though the Tv was working. The culprit was easy to spot: the communicating doors. After having switched the TV off I could clearly hear my neighbours screaming at each other, sorry to say but getting closing to the door I could easily listen to normal conversations as well. I reported this issue to the front desk who kindly moved me to a junior suite (not refurbished but still in good condition). Well if what I was told is true all park facing rooms have communicating doors then this is an issue for the longer term. I supervised many construction/fit outs in my life, this problem needs to be brought up to the architects. This is a major flaw in my view.
Quiet sleep in the suite, used the lounge, nice, good service, a bit of a push during rush hours. But friendly service. Not yet refurbished.
Used the lobby bar, excellent service.
All in all a good stay, shame on the soundproofing issue though.",4,2016,03,23
150,GORGEOUS!,"We are huge fans of Hyatt properties, and we try to stay at them wherever we go.  We were certainly not disappointed with this property.  It was a beautiful property with extremely helpful, friendly staff.  The neighborhood was nice, and the tube station is only a few blocks away.  It is a perfect location.

The rooms have plenty of space, so you do not feel cramped at the end of a long day.  The beds are heaven as are all Hyatt beds.  The Regency Club is well run, and the food is wonderful.  

When we visit London again, we will back!",5,2016,03,23
150,Dress for breakfast!,"Decent sized room, really big comfy bed.
Heated toilet seat! 
Breakfast- Go early and you'll be surrounded by smart businessmen and businesswomen in suits. Go later and you'll be with the more casual touristy crowd. Great front of house service.",4,2016,03,21
150,"Great Hotel, Engaging Staff and Excellent Location",Nicely appointed rooms and general lounge areas make this a welcome place to come back to after a long haul flight or a day in the office. Staff are friendly and go out of their way to ensure your stay is comfortable.,5,2016,03,21
150,Hyatt Churchill,"Very comfortable stay , rooms excellent and a good size , well air conditioned and beds excellent , staff also very competent . The proximity of the Hotel to Oxford street shopping is perfect . Also the Hotel is quiet even during the current renovations .",4,2016,03,20
150,Love this place,"I travel extensively and stay in London often and I must say this place is aces in my book!  Very clean, great and attentive staff, larger rooms than most London hotels, terrific location.  I will definitely be back!!!",5,2016,03,20
150,Weekend Theatre Trip,"A short break in London made all the nicer with this lovely hotel.  Short walk to Oxford Street and Marble Arch Underground Station. Good size room, friendly staff. Made the whole weekend a pleasure.  Look forward to staying here again.",5,2016,03,20
150,Location is perfect!,"Very conveniently located, has great staff, clean, has been recently renovated:)  The standard room is not very big, however quite comfortable, has all you need..  Bars and restaurants are great for meetings or just having a drink or grabbing a bite...",5,2016,03,20
150,Outstanding ,"Stayed for a weekend recently and I cannot speak highly enough. From check in to check out we were impressed. 
The food was excellent. Staff were polite and courteous and the facilities in and around the hotel exceptional.
We will definitely recommend the Churchill and stay again in the future. Highly recommend.",5,2016,03,19
150,The Best of all,We have been to London plenty of times and every time we stay at another hotel this time we stayed at the Churchill and it was the best. It had nice clean rooms and great breakfast I recommend it without a doubt. Lastly the hotel looks and feels very luxurious ,5,2016,03,19
150,Terrific Stay!,"Only a single night stay but it was outstanding. Front desk check in staff at the Diamond Desk were top notch, helpful, smiled, polite and actually so was ALL the staff I encountered. Room was super comfy and was on the RC floor. Staff in the Lounge, AM and PM were on their game, lovely food!, attentive and the room itself seemed to attract a lot of guests using it as 'living room'. Was a great atmosphere. Wish my stay was longer!",5,2016,03,18
150,haute tea,Went here for the first time and was delighted The service was friendly and not at all stuffy.The food was of a great quality and the cocktail simply delicious.I would recommend this place as a London afternoon treat.,5,2016,03,16
150,Back to the basics....,"Stayed 5 nights at the Hyatt Regency London. Regency Club staff were good at check in and in the lounge. A restaurant reservations request was not followed up (so..do it yourself..), WIFI was poor in our suite, construction noise from floors below (old furniture being disposed). Check out was robotic .. the property is always doing well for Hyatt but certainly not for its customers. One could say...back to basics would be recommended.",2,2016,03,16
150,Outstanding Hotel,The newly remodeled rooms were spacious with lots of outlets.  The staff were incredibly friendly.  Very relaxing and a great central location.  The bar was also very relaxing with an outdoor patio.  Nice selection of craft cocktails and local beers.,5,2016,03,16
150,My Favorite Hotel ,Enjoyed my stay at the Churchill. Amazing hotel. Perfect Location. Warm and Friendly ambience. Great Staff. I shall return. Love the Churchill. Love the rooms. Very comfortable. Old world charm. Fabulous Bar. Highly recommend the Churchill.,5,2016,03,16
150,A newly renovated hotel with calming and comfortable rooms,Enjoyed our 'points' stay for one night while in London. Lovely hotel with a caring staff. Did not use a lot of the facilities as the charges are beyond normal pockets. Breakfast at £30 a head is ridiculous.,5,2016,03,15
150,Our stay at The Churchill,"Although we arrived at noon unfortunately the room was not available, but went into the hospitality lounge until called to be told the room was available, we were not disappointed with the position overlooking the square and the Champagne  and the chocolate mousse cake completed the day and our calorie allowance,",5,2016,03,15
150,Still Brilliant,"Some floors have just been recently refurbished and the new rooms are really nice, a definite improvement on the old bathrooms with relaxing grey tones in the decor. The place really feels fresher, our rooms and the hotel in general was immaculately clean.  

The location is perfect just a few minutes walk from Oxford Street and Selfridges. I can't fault it, my favourite place to stay in London.",5,2016,03,14
150,Unpretentious Luxury,"Visited the hotel on Friday night with my mother and daughter. Mum paid for the entire nights stay with points we'd accumulated on a previous trip to Florida YEARS ago. Show the points system really does work. 

My daughter is only 3 but we all felt very welcome. The room was available before the specified check in time which greatly helped as we were visiting London zoo. The staff were just as friendly and as in the Florida hotel. The room was immaculate, and we also had access to the Regency Club lounge which was brilliant.

I will definitely be staying here again when visiting London.",5,2016,03,14
150,Excellent Experience at London Churchill Hyatt,"Conveniently located , excellent hotel with great service. Club facilities including breakfast & evening snacks are excellent. Great place to invite your business partners and associates. Location and facilities are really good",5,2016,03,14
150,Hate to sound picky,"I really feel like I'm being picky, but what I'm going to say bothered me!  The sheets on the bed weren't very soft!  I'm a diamond Hyatt member and I really can't recall this issue before. Maybe this hotel is the first Hyatt I've stayed in outside of the US, I don't know. The staff here is super, everyone was helpful and truly helped us feel welcome. The management sent up apples after we checked in and we loved the waters every day. Just would suggest fabric softener!",4,2016,03,12
150,great hotel,"great service - very good rooms - staff always helpful - great location - I always book this hotel if there room  - good for both business and family trips.  Hence, woyuld highly recommend the hotel to others",5,2016,03,11
150,Stunning London Visit,"Stayed at The Churchill recently, as always a fantastic visit, check in fast and smooth, stayed in a room on the sixth floor with a great view facing the square, apparently the rooms are all recently refurbished, excellent layout and facilities, the new bathrooms are an experience! Rainfall walk in showers and heated toilet!! Was booked in to use the Regency club lounge which is well worth it if you can, drinks, snacks and cocktails in the evening! Whole hotel is a peaceful relaxing experience. Do not miss the breakfast whatever you do, simply the best! Thank you Churchill!",5,2016,03,08
150,Gets better with age,I have been here three times and every time it gets better. Currently under upgrades but nothing taken away from the experience. Rooms are decent size and upgraded with the latest technology. iPads in every room to use for ordering room service and to see what else the hotel offers. Great views from most of the rooms and great service staff.,4,2016,03,07
150,Fantastic weekend at the Churchill ,Spent 3 nights at the Churchill with my wife in a club room on floor 7 using accumulated points from a long stay in Houston. The Churchill is a lovely hotel with superb amenities.  The staff are attentive and courteous but not over the top. Check in was speedy and a pleasant experience. I had read some bad reviews about the check in wich certainly wasn't the case. We both found the club lounge from 5.30-7.30 one of the highlights of our stay and the staff were delightful. The hotel is well located with some lovely pubs and restaurants close by and Oxford Street is only minutes away. We would definately recommend this hotel,5,2016,03,07
150,A superb find!,"We had one night at The Churchill and we were not disappointed and wished it could have been more. We have stayed in many of the five star hotels in London over the years but have now found the one we will return to. The staff were polite, helpful and made you feel welcome. The refurbishment of the rooms is tastefully done and our room was extremely comfortable. The lounge was relaxing and the bar had everything you could wish for including pink gin, which I drink at home but had never seen in a bar before. We did not eat in the hotel on this trip so I am unable to comment on the food or service, sadly. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or spoiling yourself.",5,2016,03,07
150,Service and Position,"My husband and I stayed for 8 nights in January 2016. Husband is a Hyatt Diamond member, and the whole stay was on points. 

The hotel is very well positioned close to Marble Arch tube, and all the shops on Regent Street. We found the bus that went to the National Theatre and stopped almost at the hotel door very convenient.

We stayed there in September, and I was surprised when the concierge greeted us by name when we arrived. Upgraded to the Regency floor. This was well worth it for the included breakfast, snacks and finger food.

The room was a king, with a view of the square. Almost all hotel rooms in London are small, but there was plenty of room for two of us for a week. If we had had large suitcases, that may have been more difficult.

The room and bathroom was comfortable and well appointed. We has a shower over the tub. I understand that the club floors are the last to be renovated, so the decor was a little bland, but more classic than dated. The bed was very comfortable.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially in the Regency Club.

There construction noise from the renovations was noticeable during the day. If you are planning to sleep in late, ask if the construction is finished. We never saw any mess or workmen.

The Churchill was very much our home in London, and if you can afford it, I recommend it as your London base.",5,2016,03,07
150,Consistently excellent service,"Every interaction at the Churchill was excellent: reception, bar, room service, doorman, concierge, and housekeeping. Even the security team was amazing (I forgot my passport in the room safe). They consistently exceeded expectations. I stay over 60 nights a year in Hyatt hotels and this staff is the best I've experienced in recent memory.",5,2016,03,06
150,Great staff,"Hotel staff really went out of their way to try to help with my needs when I needed to print out documents and fedex it out right away.  Though WiFi connection was bad in my room, the staff rewarded me to upgrade.",5,2016,03,06
150,Another great visit to The Churchill,"We first stayed here two years ago and loved it. Just a quick one-night stay this last time but it just keeps getting better. The Club Lounge is amazing - my wife is a foodie and difficult to impress, but impressed she was. We spent most of our trip at the Park Lane Marriott which is also very nice but their club lounge just doesn't compare. We are traveling back to London next month and won't make the same mistake twice - we'll be at the Churchill for the full week this time. Renovated rooms are beautiful and we love the location - always easy to get where we want to go. Service is impeccable, and not just because I'm a Diamond member - service was fabulous two years ago when I was a mere commoner! : )",5,2016,03,06
150,Great place in a great location !,"I regularly come to London for Business and stay at the Chrurchill when I can. The hotel is great and the renovated rooms are beautiful. It is perfectly located as you can reach teh city by tube but enjoy the buzz of central London in the evening,",5,2016,03,04
150,Excellent from check-in to check-out,"We truly enjoyed our 2-day stay at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill.  The staff was excellent and every interaction was met with a smile.  The hotel is clean, upscale, and centrally located.  The bar is awesome.  We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,03
150,Hard work to get served,"I spend yesterday afternoon
 in the lobby bar for a business meeting. The staff was not at all attentive. At some stage I asked a Hyatt team member whether I could order something who responded that he was not a waiter but the disappeared unaccompanied through the kitchen area. Would it not have been the appropriate reaction to find somebody else whose role it is to look after the guests? We stayed for several hours and probably consumed only half of what we would have done otherwise. Annoying for us but in the end a bigger loss for Hyatt.",2,2016,03,03
150,excellent,"Lovely hotel, staff are great, friendly and helpful without being over bearing, great décor, spacious rooms, huge comfy beds, very special loos! , really good central location, breakfast service very good, huge selection of choice, In the evening, although didn't have an evening meal, the atmosphere is calm, relaxed and classy, pianist playing modern tunes in a sedate way, stayed here many times, and keep going back. Highly recommend.",5,2016,03,01
150,Excellent stay,I recently stayed at the Hyatt for my birthday and combined it with a Theatre production.. The rooms were excellent with a fantastic location. I found the staff really wanted to help you if needed. I really enjoyed the club lounge as well.,5,2016,02,29
150,Excellent hotel in convenient location,"We stayed at this hotel for a week and the location is really good, only minutes from Metro and close to Hyde park other great places. We used upgrade to a suite, which was good option for a family of 3. We got daily water and snacks for free and also regency lounge offered really good option for breakfast and dinner/wine hour.",4,2016,02,29
150,Absolute Perfection,The Churchill serves the best cocktails in London. Their service is pleasant and impeccable. Every cocktail delivery felt like a new event where the highly trained bar staff describe each Teapot Cocktail and its origin. My favourite space in London. Drinks in The Churchill Terrace after brunch in The Montagu makes for the nicest Saturday or Sunday. Great cigar menu also! I can't wait to return!,5,2016,02,26
150,Great stay in London,My teen age daughter and I stayed a week in a fabulous room that was quiet and well appointed. The staff on all fronts were very warm and friendly and the food at the lobby restaurant was very good. The Churchill Bar is the perfect place for lounging with a wide variety of cocktail options. In terms of location you cannot beat it - close to Oxford Street with the West End an easy walk. Definitely be back.,5,2016,02,24
150,best hotel in london,"the rooms are clean , highly designed , service is great , wide variety breakfast and the  location is fabulous
i really recommend this hotel but it is a little bit expensive
i stay there every year and found the best services all the time",5,2016,02,23
150,"Great Hotel, Staff and Location","My wife and I stayed here for 5 days on vacation. We were deciding between this hotel and the other Hyatt Hotel in the area, The Andaz, and were extremely happy with our choice to stay here after walking past the other hotel during our trip. 

The staff was incredible from the second we checked-in. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and the staff already had gym access waiting for us to use showers and restrooms when we arrived. Each morning we would wake up, go downstairs and spend about 10-15 minutes with the concierge planning our daily activities. They spent as much time as necessary getting us signed up (if necessary) for different activities and directing us the best ways to travel to each location (highlighting the different routes on a map which they gave us each day). Any and every (reasonable) request we had was always met with a ""yes."" We could not have asked for a better staff experience. 

The Churchill is situated in an extremely convenient area of the city. It is an approximately 5 minute walk to the Marble Arch Underground location and 7 minute walk to the Bond Street Underground location (London's version of the subway), numerous bus stops, Santander Bikes (same thing as Citi Bikes in NYC - you rent them for the day and there are different parking locations throughout the city) and the Marble Arch Big Bus Stop (this is a hop on/off bus tour that you has stops around the city so it was extremely convenient having it so close to the hotel). It is also approximately a 3 minute walk from Regent and Oxford Street, two major shopping locations. There are also a wide variety of very nice restaurants within waling distance to the hotel which was nice to be able to walk there and back. 

There is a nice park across the street if you want to take a walk and is even better if you get a park facing room (which the staff there was very accommodating when we requested it). The truth is, even if you do not get a park facing room it is fine as we rarely looked out the window as we were outside the majority of the day/night. 

The rooms are modern and nice size. They are not huge but they get the job done. If you fancy having a bidet, I believe they were upgrading all rooms to include one but I am not 100% about this. The rooms were very clean and modern. There is a nice bar and restaurant in the hotel if you need quick food plans or drinks. 

We had a great time and would definitely stay here upon our next trip!",5,2016,02,22
150,it was great,"we had a great room in a great hotel, that is locaited in a great place.   the rooms are all renoveited(new) all the bed is 2m' X2m'  (wow) the desing of the room was beatiful.  mini bar pack with goods. the shower was big.",5,2016,02,22
150,The greatest hotel in London,I stayed there for 6 days with my family a while ago and it was definitely one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. The location was perfect and breakfasts .were really tasty. The atmosphere was really nice. The only problem was that the room was too small and not very comfortable.,5,2016,02,21
150,Good hotel but not excellent. ,"I stayed in a refurbished room. The positives are that lighting is much better and the bathroom fittings are great. The wifi has significantly improved and is now very good. 

Unfortunately they have removed the bathtub.  The gym is still disappointing and I hope as a part of the refurbishment they consider expanding it. I was also surprised that as a Platinum member I wasn't recognised as such. ",4,2016,02,20
150,High standard but tiny bathroom,"Very convenient location. Welcoming, very polite staff. Refurbished room small but extremely pleasant,comfortable and quiet.Would have been a 5 star review but the bathroom though impeccably clean and well facilitated was tiny and an issue for me was there was no bath. It was OK for one night but as I would love to stay again for longer, the lack of a bath would put me off.",4,2016,02,20
150,Churchill Bar is a MUST,"Excellent service from arrival to departure, a special mention for William on the Concierge who was very helpful. Location is great for shopping and worth that bit extra to stay on the Club Floor, Gita in the Club Lounge is brilliant - a nice and relaxing breakfast experience. Although brekkie in the main restaurant is very good with a charming Frenchman in charge, even the lady breakfast Chef went out of her way to make me a special treat. But the Churchill Bar is the star in the crown, Eve/Annette/Nicky the red dress girls along with all the lovely chaps just really spoil you. A hot water bottle, a fur rug and throw when you go outside on the terrace ....its a winter wonderland. I didn't meet the team cleaning my room but big points for HK as they had an eye for detail and didn't do that horrible hotel trick of moving everything up to one corner when they cleaned the bathroom. All in all and excellent stay, not long enough. Thanks team Churchill",5,2016,02,20
150,A must!,"Always a great place to rest, eat and socialise! Thanks. The staff are excellent - great attention to detail and the the gentleman playing the piano, during our evening meal  - was absolutely excellent.",5,2016,02,16
150,Saturday Brunch at the Montagu Restaurant ,"Thoroughly enjoyed the occasion. Selection of food and drink was amazing. Live music added to the atmosphere. The staff were friendly, attentive and extremely professional both in the Montagu and the Churchill Terrace Bar. Well worth a visit - great value.",5,2016,02,16
150,Great Improvemnets at the Churchill,"Have been staying at the Churchill Hotel on Portman Square for the past 35+ years under various hotel managments and hotel brands.  After eight years taking over the hotel, Hyatt has improved, renovated and significantly made the entire hotel stay  outstanding.  Newly renovated rooms have all the techincal features, including high tech Japanese toilet.",5,2016,02,16
150,Beautiful,"This hotel is amazing!!! I stayed with my friend who had a penthouse room which was gorgeous. The hotel is very peaceful and well respected. It is private. 
The food at the hotel was also good and breakfast is buffet style all you can eat which is a bonus. The hotel is pretty much right behind oxford street, its like a 5minute walk. It is only a short taxi ride from paddington station. ",5,2016,02,16
150,Top visit,I went there for a birthday treat. We had the chefs table. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left. It was probably one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The wines that where suggested went with every course,5,2016,02,15
150,Much to do about nothing,"We visited the restaurant for a special occasion but it just proved to be pretentious. The description of the food on the menu deserved a  Pulitzer prize for creative writing. And the pricing of the courses was as inventive.
We left the restaurant as hungry as we started vowed never to return.  ",3,2016,02,14
150,Very good hotel in a fab location ,"A very good Hyatt property in central London with super service and great food.
Oxford street is a block away and so are good restaurants such as Roka Mayfair etc.

You can't go wrong with the hotel. I got to stay in their newly refurbished rooms!!

Currently hotel is going through renovation which should be completed soon.",4,2016,02,13
150,Great location,"Stayed with our daughter celebrating her 19th birthday. The location is excellent, and staff very service minded.

Like staying at the 8th floor and the executive services.  The benefit of using the 8th breakfast lounge and services is worth the extra spend.",4,2016,02,13
150,No Complaints,"Everything ran smoothly for our one night stay. Choice of rooms on check in, eventual choice was inward looking, therefore quiet, and newly refurbished, so pleasant to be in. We did not spend much time there, and we did not eat there, bit we slept well and checked out smoothly: so no complaints.",4,2016,02,12
150,Real 5 star quality,"Very impressed with the quality and standard of this hotel. Bedroom was very comfortable, spacious and well appointed contributing to sound night's sleep. Shower was fantastic. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Slightly taken aback by the charge for breakfast - £24 if purchased the night before or £30 on the morning - it must be a fantastic breakfast, but I didn't bother",5,2016,02,11
150,My nicest recent stay in London,"I stayed one night using Hyatt points with my wife and daughter. The newly-refurbished room was spacious and well-lit with a very comfortable bed. There were convenient sockets (UK / Europe / USB) by the bed and the desk. The sound insulation was excellent. All the staff were very helpful. The wifi signal was hard to connect to in our room, but the default free option had reasonable speed. Overall one of the most pleasant stays I’ve ever had in London.",5,2016,02,11
150,Excellent luxury hotel,The Regency brand is not the top one in the Hyatt portfolio but this particular property is punching above its weight. Rooms are newly renovated and better than some at the more upmarket luxury hotels in London. Service is impeccable and there is generally few if anything to fault. The only thing from preventing top grade for me was that the bathroom was not cleaned quite as well as it could have been (a few hair here and there). I have seen a lot worse in other luxury hotels but still a bit of a shame as this hotel is otherwise close to perfect. ,5,2016,02,10
150,Pre-Christmas Sunday Champagne Brunch,"Fabulous food, lovely setting, busy but not noticeably so... Unlimited champagne & all for £70 per person!  Really good value & a great start to Christmas... Will definitely be going again.  This was recommended to us by friends , I would recommend also.",5,2016,02,10
150,The Chuchill restaurant,"We were staying in The Montclam we had a meal there which was lovely  and decided to try ""the Churchill"" for our next evening and glad we did the ambulance was relaxing and the staff were helpful and pleasant. The food was lovely and a good serlection. The wine menu had a good price range we try an Engish white wine as we had never tried Engish one and it was similar to a Chardney. We would go here again. Enjoyed very good.",5,2016,02,09
150,Perfect stay in London,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Churchill. The hotel location was close to everything...shopping, food, train station, etc. The room was very comfortable and the beds plush. The staff and concierge were also helpful during our stay. If we return to London, I would love to stay there again.",5,2016,02,09
150,Dependably Good Choice,"Only a block away from Oxford Street, Marble Arch and Mayfair,  Portman Square is tranquil and the hotel's staff are welcoming throughout.  Guest floors are quieter than a library and immaculately maintained.  Delicious cocktails arrive with attentive service in the Churchill Cocktail Bar.  Breakfast and supper are delivered by personable and passionate waiting staff whose sole aim is to ensure your chosen menu arrives as you would like it - less can be more.  Thank you for a relaxed and restful stay.",5,2016,02,08
150,Classy hotel!,"We had a one-night stay here just before Christmas. The king-sized bed was luxurious, and the room was sumptuous. I don't think it's the kind of place I'd normally stay - very classy place and guests - and the room cost would normally be outside my budget. Food and bar prices to be avoided in favour of other bars/eateries elsewhere. Nice to be spoilt though!",4,2016,02,08
150,Nice place and lication,"We Held a business conference here. It was a nice London Hotel in a good location in Mayfair. Rooms are good, not big but nice and good size for London. Service great and food also good. I enjoyed the hotel.   Only stayed 3 nights but would return. The hotel felt cleaner than other London hotels I've stayed in. ",4,2016,02,05
150,Amazing Sunday Brunch Loved every minute,"We had sundays champagne brunch both in December and January and what a great time we had, perfect for really special occasions and if your budget allows a lovely relaxed sunday afternoon with lovely food and a relaxing jazz band, great service, a wonderful place, beautifully decorated and very welcoming. The food- so much choice, breakfast, lunch, chocolate fountain, tables of food choices for everyone. Champagne served throughout or red or white wine. Such a wonderful experience. ",5,2016,02,04
150,Tranquil location in heart of London,"The Churchill overlooks Portman Square, a one square block park. It's hard to believe this quiet, peaceful setting is only two short blocks from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street and Marble Arch. 
The hotel has a lovely, spacious lobby. On some afternoons high quality jazz and blues groups will be playing in the Montagu restaurant located at one end of the lobby. It's a fun, lively setting. 
My wife and I went for the executive floor upgrade, and snagged a room on the eighth floor overlooking Portman Square. It was a very pleasant view to return to in the evening.
The furnishings were very comfortable in pleasant neutral beiges and browns. The king bed was very comfortable - no soft spots from overuse. The room was spotless and showed no signs of wear. The room thermostat controlled the room temp quickly and quietly. There was an electric tea kettle, and iron and ironing board tucked in cupboards and closets. There was an Apple phone stereo next to the desk. The internet worked flawlessly. 
The bathroom was well lit and of normal size. Toiletries are very nice quality. The water pressure in the shower is stunning - I was afraid it might loosen my hair transplants. Felt good after a day of sightseeing.
The executive lounge is located on the eighth floor and is very nice. The breakfast buffet offers  all the normal high quality choices, plus eggs to order any way you like. The evening buffet offers enough to whet your appetite before going out for the evening or small meal before an early morning flight. The service is very attentive, courteous and professional. They also have Go cups for a coffee on the way out the door. This is a very peaceful retreat. 
This is a great hotel in a quiet location close to the action. The best way to get there from Heathrow is take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station, then a taxi to the hotel. Same for the way back. The taxi wants 50 pounds one way to Heathrow. The Heathrow Express is 10 pounds, plus five for the taxi. Saves 35 pounds each way.",5,2016,02,03
150,Prosecco lunch,"The food was fantastic, there was both hot and cold - nothing was too much trouble. Even though we had to evacuate during our lunch they let us have another 30 minutes.  My glass was never empty with prosecco. The service you could not fault and they were very friendly. Such a good price for what we had. ",5,2016,02,03
150,The Best of London,"We stayed here in early September, 2015, while on a Tauck tour of London and Paris. What a gorgeous hotel! Our room was lovely (see pictures) and the hotel itself is beautifully appointed. The staff are friendly and most helpful. The dining at the hotel is second-to-none. We loved our stay in London in no small part because of the Churchill. Highly recommend!",5,2016,02,03
150,Hyatt Churchill,"I had the pleasure of staying the Hyatt Churchill hotel last weekend and the service and attention to detail in all areas of the hotel were exemplary, the staff were friendly, well informed and nothing was to much trouble, can't wait for my next visit",5,2016,02,02
150,"Elegant stay, location CANNOT be better","Wonderful stay at the Churchill, fantastic location in central London, especially if you like to shop / walk to the sights.   Concierge were fabulous, rooms were updated and modern, afternoon tea was a big hit with my daughter.",5,2016,01,27
150,Business Trip,"Selected Hotel because of Central location - 100 meters from Oxford Street. It was quite expensive but you get everything you would expect from this grade of Hotel - Large room with King size bed, Large Flat screen TV, even heated toilet seats. The service was excellent - nothing too much trouble. The break fast was good and there area lot of different foods due to the mix of nationalities using the hotel - something for everyone. The hotel decor is slightly old fashioned but tasteful. They do some excellent cocktails - at £16 each pricey but well presented with nibbles and suitable vegetation very enjoyable.
During the afternoon they also had a pianist and singer performing who were very good. If you are in London to see a show and do some shopping  and feel like splashing out on a good hotel you could do a lot worse.",4,2016,01,25
150,Weekend away,"We have stayed at The Hyatt on a number of occasions, each time it doesn't quite meet expectations.  We paid for a club room, yet got put on the 7th floor, a non club floor.  The rooms are well equipped and in keeping with a decent hotel.  The room too had an iPad for ordering room service etc, though it wasn't working & someone had to come & reset it for us.  The club breakfast was good with plenty of choice, however the staff aren't hugely attentive and will remove plates etc without replacing cutlery, you have to ask for coffee if you want more than 1 cup, milk to accompany tea was hit & miss!  Don't get me wrong, it is very good, the staff are polite & helpful, though doorman won't actually open the door for you, I just expect better for the money, especially when paying for club.",4,2016,01,24
150,stay at Hyatt Churchill,A great hotel with the best in customer service and quality.An established 5 star plus which maintains its high end brand.Staff are at hand to take care of all needs and requirements .A very comfortable Club Lounge.,5,2016,01,24
150,Wonderful hotel near Marble Arch,"After catching the red-eye from New York, I was delighted with the warm welcome at the Hyatt Regency  - The Churchill. Check-in was fast and Sebastian on the front desk was able to give me early access to my room (thank you!), before a day of meetings in London. I was given one of the recently renovated rooms and it was fabulous The room was large, light, beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. All the amenities were available (lots of clothes hangers, wooden and quilted, iron, ironing board, industrial strength hair dryer etc). After a long day of meetings I had room service for dinner on the first night - the Salad Nicoise was excellent!. The hotel is well located, only a 2 minute walk to Marble Arch tube station and the buses in Oxford Street. All in all a great stay at a really good hotel. I hope to stay again. Recommended",5,2016,01,21
150,Urban Sohphistication,The hotel is a wonderful calm oasis in the city.  The staff was always ingratiating and welcoming. It was a nice safe haven from a hectic business schedule. The hotel is a beautiful infusion of old world charm and new world sophistication.,5,2016,01,17
150,Wonderful Birthday Champagne Sunday Brunch,"My husband took me to brunch last Sunday and what a very special day it was too. A beautiful breakfast/ lunch champagne all the way through, gorgeous deserts so much choice. A jazz band smoothly playing in the background. Excellent service, excellent food and when you think it couldn't get any better, there's a little secret that I am unsure whether I should share. The narnia garden outside area. Yes outside in January, with beautiful sheepskin rugs, hot water bottles, patio heaters that work for everyone not just the person sitting underneath it, and Churchill embroidered tweed rugs. We had our hot drinks outside. What an absolutely fabulous and amazing day. Feeling very special and spoilt.",5,2016,01,17
150,"Very comfortable, reflected in the prices",Recently refurbished room was very comfortable and had all fixtures and fittings you would want. Well located for shopping and easy access to other main attractions. Food and drink privet but not untypical for this class of hotel. Plenty of other options within walking distance.,4,2016,01,16
150,Sunday Brunch,"Very cool Sunday brunch, self service style with free flowing drinks and table service for hot specials. 

Highly recommended for a special occasion. The hotel it's self was very cool, chic and clean, as you'd expect... Five star service in a five star hotel. ",5,2016,01,16
150,Great reception and welcoming experience.. Located centrally.,"We got dropped off at the Churchill from our hired ride and the welcome experience was great. They had our room all situated and upgraded so it was nice to be able to get into a nice larger room and get showered up before we met with our friends that evening. rooms were comfortable, nice view towards the park area and quiet. Overall a great hotel to stay at, nothing that blew us away but nothing that wasn't expected. We would stay again.",4,2016,01,16
150,Wonderful stay,"I only stayed here for one night, but this is what I would expect from a high class hotel.  As soon as you walk in, you receive a welcome greeting.  The Regency Lounge is quite spacious with impeccable service by the staff.  We had a suite which was very comfortable and spacious for London standard.  It's only a short walk away from the Marble Arch tube station.  It's also close to a lot of shops on Oxford St.  I would love to come back here next time I'm in London!",5,2016,01,15
150,Good location,"Good location if you are looking for a hotel near to the shopping area (Oxford St/Regent St) with high standard hotel. The rooms are average in size if you compare it with English hotel standards. During our stay there was renovation in the upper floors and the noise starts from 10:00 AM.
Stay again: Maybe
",5,2016,01,14
150,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"We had a lovely trip and the hotel was a great refuge from bustling London.  Others wrote about the construction but we didn't notice any (might be because we were there Christmas week).  Walking distance to Hyde Park, shopping on Oxford Street and a 20 minute walk to the palaces, theater and museums.
Park view is nice for 5 minutes when you wake up but you didn't travel to London to sit in your room so it's not a big deal to get hung up about.
Club access is great if you can get it.  Breakfast and light dinner with drinks.
Concierge and front desk staff were really nice and helpful.
Less than 5 minute walk to Marble Arch Tube station and 1 minute to a direct bus to north London (Hendon, Golders Green) for those so inclined.
Quiet, clean, comfortable.",5,2016,01,13
150,Fantastic Hotel,"This is a great hotel to stay at in London.  Great location, wonderful staff, well maintained...it ticks all the boxes.  For price I believe The Churchill exceeds the concept of ""value for money"".  The staff go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as possible",5,2016,01,10
150,Hyatt Regency - Churchll's V sign,Good service & ideal location to enjoy London. Located in a quiet corner yet a short walking distance to Oxford Street & transport including to Heathrow. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. I would give Churchill's V sign.,5,2016,01,10
150,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We stayed here in an upgraded suite shortly after they reopened after the fire.  We had been there the year before right before the fire and you couldn't tell the difference.  Everything was in great working order and looked exactly like before.  The suites give you nice space to spread out, the bathrooms are large and well stocked, the bed is very comfortable, lighting was good to read, and there was plenty of closet space with the usual iron, safe and great hangers.  Service was friendly and efficient at the front desk and in the restaurant.  The breakfast is one of my favorites.  The lounge food and service is top notch.   We had several events at the hotel which were handled perfectly; great service and friendly staff.  

The location was perfect for us with easy access to the tube and the rest of the city.  The area around the hotel is quiet unless you go out to Oxford Street and perfect for a casual stroll.  I frankly would not stay anywhere else.  I think it is an excellent value.",5,2016,01,10
150,Good hotel Exceptional Service,"Fabulously located in the thick of ""touristy"" London. The hotel is recently renovated, for the most part, so its fairly refreshed. The suites are nicely appointed, but small sized. A tad inadequate for a family of 4. The best thing about this property is the service- lounge, restaurants are all well catered and very personal service. Kudos to the staff. The front desk (atleast that serviced us) was stiff and very formal/not warm enough for our liking. Apart the early confusion with the front desk, rest of the week long stay over Christmas, was quite comfortable, and worthy of a return.",4,2016,01,09
150,The Churchill has always shown Britain at its best,"My wife and I first date was at the Churchill in 1972, I think it was just a few years old at the time. I was an officer of a Scotch company and she was on vacation. The bar, its spirits, ambiance and positive mood was a perfect introduction for us both. 
We have visited over the years and on a subsequent trip, in 2012 stopped in once again for memories and a 'toddy. It did not disappoint. The bar was not officially open at the time we entered but when we told the manager our story he celebrated with a welcome back Chivas for me and compari/soda for me wife of now close to 40 years.
Location for shopping, walking and visiting is excellent. The rooms, restaurants and, of course bar, continuously updated and modernized; and the afternoon tea...a welcoming cultural attribute for two 'across the pond-ers"".",5,2016,01,08
150,Great experience for short multi-family stay,"My family and another family stayed here for one night recently.  We thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay.

Great location in London.

I have Diamond status at the time of this stay, which provides top level amenities.  No doubt this was a big factor in our great stay.

We were 2 families with kids ranging in age from 7 to 14 who stayed in 3 rooms.  We booked 2 of the rooms using free night certificates and 1 room using 25,000 Hyatt points.

Our experience for this brief stay was 10 out of 10.

Staff were outstanding.  Everyone we dealt with was extremely professional, personable, and welcoming.  In particular, Aki the lady who checked us in was delightful.  Also, Eva is a charming woman who hosted us in the lounge and was extremely friendly in spite of our families with several kids 'invading' the lounge.  (The kids were fairly quiet and very well behaved, but so often in a hotel lounge the staff seem to cringe at the sight of kids.  This was NOT the case at our stay in the Hyatt London.)

Staff promptly set up a portable bed (aka cot or rollaway bed) in in 2 of the 3 rooms.  They offered to set one up in the 3rd room, but we didn't need it.

We booked just 1 day prior, after changing our plans. We were given rooms 718, 719, and 710 - all nearby each other with 718 and 719 next door.

Lounge access was a godsend.  Breakfast was very good.  Selection was very good, food quality and freshness was very good. See pictures for more details.  Enough substantial food to make a filling healthy breakfast.  The granola bars were excellent.  The homemade chocolate chip cookies were a bit of a letdown for me, but the kids liked them.

We occupied the rear area of the lounge during breakfast; it felt like our own private dining room.

Smoked salmon was very good.  The kids enjoyed the scrambled eggs.  Orange juice excellent.  The muesli was different than I've had elsewhere, but tasty.  The cheeses also were very good.

Evening appetizers between 530-730pm also were very good.

We also stopped by the lounge a couple times for cookies and beverages.

Private Check-in on 8th floor was very good.  This is NOT something that I personally got much value from, but it was nice to be treated as such a highly valued guest.  Everyone in our group got a kick out of being escorted to the elevator by the clerk at the desk downstairs, then being checked in on the 8th floor adjacent to the lounge while we sipped on juice and Coke.

The rooms were nicely finished and more spacious than expected for a central London room.  There was more than enough room for the extra rollaway bed in the room.

Some reviews have questioned whether this is a true 5-star hotel.  I can't comment on that as I do not stay in many 5-star hotels because properties of that caliber are just not my personal sweet spot.  What I can say is that this is a hotel with very nice rooms and beautiful common areas, in a great location, with staff who treated us like kings and queens.

We did not need or seek out concierge services or utilize the hotel bar or restaurant during our short stay.",5,2016,01,07
150,Nice appointed room in great location,"The location and condition of this hotel was absolutely perfect.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.  The WIFI access in the rooms was marginal at best.  We had two rooms, so it wasn't one room problem.  WIFI in the lobby worked well.",4,2016,01,06
150,Excellent stay,Everything was fantastic!  Hotel location was great and staff was wonderful!  I had originally stayed at another hotel in London and then switched to yours - what a difference - your hotel was far superior to the competition.,5,2016,01,05
150,Anniversary trip - exceptional service,"My wife and I stayed there for our anniversary and were delightfully surprised by the cake and champagne. We had our infant with us and the staff went the extra mile and brought us baby shampoo, oil, and powder without us even asking. The service at the restaurant was wonderful as well. Hats off to wonderful hospitality and great service.",5,2016,01,05
150,Great New Year's vacation in London,"My family just returned from a 5 night stay in The Churchill Hyatt Regency. We couldn't be more pleased in our choice of hotel. The hotel, recently renovated has that hip, boutique vibe. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The bathroom, although small had all amenities. our only complaint was the WiFi connection in the rooms, which was very spotty. We give our highest accolades to the concierge! Sahil, William, Melina and Nick, whom were certainly helpful in making our family vacation a huge success! With three young adult boys (ages 17, 20 and 23) that is no easy feat! We started emailing from the time we booked our trip to inquire about purchasing soccer tickets, etc. Every email was answered in a timely manner. When we arrived they continued to help with dinner reservations, directions, ideas, etc. They truly made it so easy - thanks again. We would  recommend this hotel highly to all and would stay there again.",5,2016,01,04
150,Nicely appointed/great location,"I stayed here during the rebuild of the hotel so there were only two floors. It was well appointed and in a fantastic location. Near the subway system. A short walk to countless restaurants, shopping and pubs. The Churchill theme is carried throughout the hotel and if you are a history buff it really is fun. From the champagne to the cigars...
The bar is busy with upscale locals. Pricey, but if you can afford it it is really worth the money.
The concierge was able to get me fantastic seats to the Chelsea/Sunderland match which happened to be the game where they awarded the Champions cup to Chelsea!!",5,2016,01,02
150,Not impressed- not a 5 star hotel,"I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel. As a diamond member, I have stayed at many Hyatts and sadly this one did not live up to its reputation. The rooms were average, nothing befitting a top hotel however. The concierge was generally unhelpful both with suggestions and information. We had asked about Notting Hill only to be told there was nothing to see on the walk there and nothing to do there. The lounge is nice but the staff can be curt in shutting it down. Other guests that used the lounge were often loud and somewhat disturbing. Finally, the hotel lacked many amenities I would expect in a top property. While some of this was due to renovation, it seemed more like a room to sleep rather than a luxury experience.",2,2015,12,26
150,Great location in London,Overall good hotel which was under renovation when I stayed there early November. Really great location next to Oxford and not far from the tube stations. Had breakfast every day in their main restaurant - great variety and good quality of food but the guys would need to pay a bit attention to the tables. Really small issue comparing with the overall stay.,4,2015,12,23
150,Stay at the London Hyatt Regency,Great Hotel - fantastic rooms recently completed. Reception staff really helpful and friendly. The bar area is comfortable but staff needs to be a little more attentive. Overall the Regency London  holds up to the world class standard  portrayed by the Hyatt Group around the world.,5,2015,12,23
150,Excellent hotel,"Enjoyed the hotel. The location is great. It is currently undergoing renovations, but this was clearly communicated - and the hours worked very well around our schedule so didn't hear anything. Particularly enjoyed the Regency floor service with the lounge Regency Club serving breakfast and nibbles/drinks at specific times.",5,2015,12,22
150,a true London experience,"The Churchill is just a charming luxury hotel with a boutique feel. The staff is wonderful and the entire feel of the property makes you feel like you are home. It was our second stay here and it will be our ""go to hotel"" in London from now on.",5,2015,12,21
150,Great weekend.,"We stayed here for a weekend during spring break.  Great hotel in a perfect location off Oxford street, walking distance to Madame Tussaud.  We spend a whole day there.  It was so much fun.  Hotel staff are very helpful in every way possible. Thanks!",5,2015,12,20
150,Abysmal  3 days,"Recently stayed at the Churchill Hyatt in London from 15th December for three days. This was the worst experience of all the Hyatts I have stayed at globally. There was no one available when we arrived and cab was unable to park near doors. The reception took a gbp 1022 deposit on my card which has yet to be released 3 days on and only informed me of mistake on checkout. The toilets smelt foul for 2 hours after every clean. The gym was out of service, my booking for 5 at Locatelli was given up with staff having no recollection I existed. I will not be staying at Churchill Hyatt again and give this experience a 1 star. Grand Hyatt Doha, Park and Grand Hyatts Dubai far superior in service and quality. This stay did dis service to all other Hyatts who generally operate at highest quality. Better value with superior quality available in London for sure...
",1,2015,12,20
150,Great hotel !,"Great hotel in a perfect location just off Oxford Street. Worth the extra £ to opt for the executive floor with a private lounge serving breakfast and evening canapés.

The bar with its signature cocktails well worth a visit - exceptional bar staff and a lovely heated terrace!",5,2015,12,19
150,Great Place Great Location,"This Hyatt has the accommodations of a boutique hotel, service and staff of a 5 star hotel and the perfect location for shopping, eating and walking around town.  It is upscale, comfortable and great value.",5,2015,12,17
150,London weekend,"I deliberated long & hard about which hotel to book for my wife & I's weekend break. For once I made an excellent choice. The highest accolade I can give is that my wife congratulated me on my choice (unheard of!). The room, staff & breakfast were all top class. Access to Oxford Street shops, particularly Selfridges is excellent & it's near Marble Arch tube station.",5,2015,12,15
150,Excellent central hotel,Everything about the hotel is good and it has a central location. My room had recently been renovated and was whisper quiet. Only downside was the poor wifi signal but Reception said that they were aware of this and were rectifying it. Staff service was near to perfect.,5,2015,12,14
150,Fabulous weekend,We stayed here last month to celebrate our son's 18th birthday and he was so touched when the hotel surprised him with a birthday cake. It really helped make the weekend extra special for him. As always the staff are very helpful and welcoming.  The bedrooms have been refurbished since our last visit and are lovely with lots of little touches which make them more luxurious - we particularly liked the mirror in the bathroom that doesn't steam up when you've had a shower!!  It was the first time we have stayed here at a weekend and there was a real buzz about the place. I have no  hesitation in recommending the Churchill,5,2015,12,13
150,Perfect Birthday Weekend,"My partner and I stayed here for a night in November for my 27th birthday. From the minute we arrived we felt very welcomed. The staff on reception were very efficient and the check in process was very easy. The room was very clean and comfortable. I loved the Molton Brown shower products especially :) We popped out for a few hours after we got settled and we came back to a bottle of Processo and birthday dessert with a lovely card from the hotel manager which I thought was a very special touch. We didn't have time to eat or drink in the bar or restaurant unfortunately which I would have loved but from what I have been told from others that have stayed here, they are both to die for. Overall, whether for business or leisure, I thoroughly recommend The Churchill for your next London visit!",5,2015,12,10
150,Enjoying life,Enjoyed every minute of our 4 day stay from staff warm reception to the beautiful amenities and comfort of this hotel .maybe the most enjoyable hotel stay we had after 50 years of traveling globaly. Surprising as  never thought UK as a top service destination on hotels.,5,2015,12,10
150,Best time ever! Best Xmas ever!,The food was amazing! Service very helpful and professional. I was really impressed when I saw the room. Breakfast was delicious and fresh. They didnt miss anything from my request list. The polish ladies at reception desk were so nice and helpful. Well done!,5,2015,12,09
150,One of best hotels in London,"This hotel is outstanding from the minute you enter and are greeted by the hotel's amazing staff to the myriad gourmet dining experiences and beautiful rooms.  It is currently undergoing renovation but you would not know this. Only minor inconvenience was not having access to the gym, but a superb alternative at a private club next door was offered. We had one of the renovated rooms overlooking Portman Sqaure. The room was spacious (especially for London) and well designed. The bathroom was state of the art. The Sunday brunch was the best I have ever experienced. Even if I do not stay at this hotel the next time I am in London I will make a point of doing this again. Cannot speak highly enough of this property. Also superb location within easy walking distance of major shoppping, dining and entertainment.",5,2015,12,08
150,Not Five Star,"In general, I enjoyed my stay here. It was booked via my profile on Hotels.com and I was given a generously sized room overlooking the park. There was no shower cabin so one has to stand in the bathtub when showering. The location of the hotel is very convenient.

The was a large wet patch on the carpet next to the bed. I enquired about this with housekeeping and they explained that ‘something had happened’ when the guest prior to me was staying there so they had to wet-clean the carpet. One wonders what ‘something had happened’ means…

The staff in the restaurant are attentive and friendly and the breakfast buffet has a good selection of quality foods.

Reception staff are efficient and helpful but they ignored my address details and I was checked in under the incorrect profile of a guest with the same name. When I queried this during checkout, the reception staff claimed it was a problem with Hotels.com which is of course nonsense. 

The concierge desk was simply not up to scratch and on two occasions I experienced an unpleasant display of snotty/conceited attitude.",3,2015,12,08
150,perfect weekend,"we spent last weekend in London and stayed there for two nights. Everything, from check-in to checkout, was perfect!

to begin with, the location is ideal: 5 min. walk from Marble Arch, in a quiet square with a small park and a tennis court in its middle.

people there are highly professional, they know when to be (in)visible. you find everything just where you expect it to be. rooms are perfectly clean (the bed is the most comfortable i've ever had!), the bar and its fireplace make the ground floor an extremely pleasant place to sit and have a drink listening to (good) jazz musicians.

A delightful stay!",5,2015,12,07
150,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"A fantastic 3 night stay at this classy, elegant hotel.  The hotel is superbly located and just a short walk from Oxford Street, Marble Arch and Hyde Park.  The service was excellent throughout our stay, particularly in the Regency Club lounge.",5,2015,12,07
150,Excellent Winter Terrace Experience,"Narnia inspired Winter Terrace at Churchill Bar is a pop-up bar not to be missed! Beautiful decor with overhead heaters, blankets and faux fur coated seats, it was worth braving the cold for.

Lovely lunchtime treat for my partner and I, between us we tried Aslan's Roar, Edmund's Temptation, Bever's Brew and The Toffee Tree. 

Service was fantastic, Nikolett really made us feel welcome, which is rare to find in up-market locations when you're under 30. Personable, warm and friendly, she's a real asset to the bar, so I hope they realise what a great team member they have.

My pick is probably the Toffee Tree- very impressive with edible silver coated apple to contrast with the chocolate, crystal glass rimmed with lime-sugar and excellent chocolate fudge. My partner's pick was the Bever's Brew, especially great for Aussies as it's a bit like an alcoholic milo. 

Only downside was we had to book twice as the first time we booked in it didn't seem to register, so thankfully we called a second time after we didn't get the confirmation email.",5,2015,12,06
150,Luxury with first class service,"Just stayed here for 5 nights and ran 5 days of meetings in the conference rooms. The hotel is pure luxury - I've stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world, and this competes well with all the best, particularly down to the excellent professional staff. The accommodation would be even better if the rooms were larger, but, in central London all hotels suffer from having less space to offer guests than in some other cities (such as Dubai). The Churchill makes up for this with a very high class feel and brilliant team members.",5,2015,12,06
150,"Great hotel, excellent location ","The hotel was clean, the staff professional. 
The rooms were modern and spacious.
The decor for Christmas was really festive and the food exactly as advertised......
but, the free internet that had to be connected to daily (or you pay for what I would assume was a faster and more reliable connection) disconnected constantly and was really slow, which was a disappointment. ",4,2015,12,02
150,Great Location,"The hotel is undergoing a major upgrade post the gas explosion. The rooms are being upgraded and expect to have renovation noise and work men walking around the corridors. While the work is carried out carefully do expect the intrusion from time to time. The gym is also closed and you have to cross the road to the House Home Club to use the gym. 

Apart from the location and great front desk staff, the hotel needs to look into improving some key areas. The breakfast is suppose to start at 630am but most often than not, they are still setting up. This is most upsetting, as an overseas traveller trying to shake off jet lag, one does get up early hence why not get breakfast out of the way, but then you are told its '2 more minutes to 630am' please wait as they are still setting up. Honestly for such an upmarket hotel, you sit the guest down and explain that the buffet spread is still being laid out. More importantly, if breakfast is 630am, then everything should be ready by 615am!

The second major are they need to look into is the wifi, was staying on the 5 floor and the wifi kept being dropped and it would take a long time to log back in. No issues with other parts of the hotel. Most annoying. Was bounced around to different people and finally 3 2 days before check out, the assistant front desk manager offered to get a portable mifi as a stop gap measure. That was greatly appreciated but somewhat too late. More so with the multi million pound upgrade this should have been sorted out. 

As per the title, the saving grace is still the location. Given the price the other services need major upgrade too.",3,2015,12,02
150,Quite central,"A 2-minute walk from the Marble Arch tube station and the Marble arch itself. Theres a small park right opposite the hotel which makes it very quiet in central London.

The hotel is luxurious and you feel it especially in a place like London. There are many high street stores and eateries just steps away from the hotel.",4,2015,12,01
150,Great Location and Service,"Mid –October we enjoyed a four night stay at the Hyatt.  We were celebrating a special birthday and wedding anniversary. We stayed in a wing of the hotel that was still being renovated.  The hallway was being painted but we had no fumes in our newly furnished room.  We found the rooms spacious and enjoyed the very modern conveniences furnished in the bathroom.  We were there as part of a Tauck Tour and our package included the full breakfast buffet each morning.  Breakfast and wait service in the Montagu restaurant were five star.  We enjoyed a light lunch and drinks in the Churchill bar…both times service was friendly.  Special thank you to Sebastian, at the front desk, who made sure we enjoyed our stay;  and to Stephen, (in the hotel Jacquar)  who went above and beyond to get us to the train station in style and on time.  My husband and I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2015,12,01
150,"Wonderful hotel, fabulous staff","We always stay here when we visit London. London hotels do have high service standards vs. many hotels globally but this one does an exceptional job in the competitive London market. The location is great for shopping, eating out, theater, and attractions. The rooms are well-equipped and tastefully decorated. The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to make our visits special. The concierge is very knowledgeable and worked hard to help us make good tour choices. 

Awesome place. You won't be disappointed. If you can, stay on the Regency Lounge level. Their breakfasts are great and a big time saver in the morning. ",5,2015,11,29
150,Chick hotel with very good location and amazing staff!,I stayed for a weekend with my daughter in this hotel. It was not our first time and definitely not the last one.  It is a very elegant hotel and the staff it's not spoilt. They are friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed Regency Club where our host Eva from Greece was absolutely amazing! She was truly welcoming and made our stay really special. Thank you very much for that! ,5,2015,11,28
150,Good location but inconveniences due to remodel,"I chose the Churchill primarily due to its location since it is near a tube station as well as local restaurants, pubs, shopping, etc. I found the location to be great and the service to also be quite good.   Unfortunately, the ongoing remodeling, which apparently will not be complete until late 2016, caused some inconveniences. For example, the wifi service was spotty, the gym is closed (you can use the neighboring hotel's facility, but only during business hours), and the business center is basically a table in the lobby.  All things considered, it was still a pleasant stay. I must mention that they have probably the best breakfast service of any hotel I've visited. I will probably stay again, hopefully with the construction finished next time.",5,2015,11,27
150,First trip to London,The entire staff that we interacted with were Wonderful! The location of the hotel is excellent and made it easy to walk to almost everything we wanted to get to or to the train station.  Highly recommend this property,5,2015,11,24
150,An Old Friend Still Among The Best in London,Thirty years since I first stayed here and despite changes in branding it still is one of the most pleasant hotels in a London. Updates have not changed the charm and staff still amongst the most efficient and friendly you will find anywhere. God sized rooms light and airy. It's a great location and an easy walk to shopping and a wide range of restaurants. Prices are not bad for the high end of a London. I highly recommend.,5,2015,11,23
150,Very Good,"As platinum members we didn't get an upgrade which was understandable given the star level and location of this hotel. It was the perfect location, very lively, close to many bus stops and underground stations. The breakfast was a bit overpriced. 30 GBP/pp. I had similar for much cheaper at another 5 star hotel in London. There was renovation going on, so it got a bit noisy one morning when we decided to sleep in. But if you are a tourist and leave the room in the morning, it's no issue. Couldn't use their gym during the renovation but offered access at an adjacent hotel. Overall it was a great experience, maybe 4.5 star, but missing the wow factor for the 5 star rating.",4,2015,11,23
150,Room not ready,Excellent hotel. Rooms recently renovated. Has toto Japanese  toilets installed. Only drawback was room not ready upon check in. Arrived at 2:20 pm and had to wait until 3. Otherwise location is great and very good breakfast,4,2015,11,23
150,Elegant and relaxed,Five star hotel experience. Spacious and very comfortable rooms.  Superb breakfast and lunch in a beautiful dining area.  Staff could not be more attentive.  Very central location only  minutes walk from Marble Arch tube station.,5,2015,11,23
150,Nice hotel in a great location,"I spent 4 nights in this hotel while being in a conference. The rooms are nice and comfortable, very good breakfast. The service is good and professional but with a smile. A decent restaurant for dinner and a very nice bar for a drink. I will surely be back. 
The hotel is within walking distance of Oxford and Regent streets. ",5,2015,11,22
150,Hyatt Upgrade,"I checked in as a Diamond Member for the evening, using my points for a standard room. To my surprise I was upgraded to a Club Level room. The service was faultless, the room was comfortable, clean and with a great view over the park. The staff could not have been more helpful. A beautiful hotel and excellent staff.",5,2015,11,20
150,Perfect London Stay,"Perfect location, perfect property for a perfect long weekend visit. We managed to do much more that expected and walked almost everywhere with ease. I cant imagine a better, more congenial and more helpful atmosphere",5,2015,11,18
150,Excellent interior refurbishment,"Check-in functioned as expected - smooth. Lucia took us to our newly refurbished room apologising for the remaining refurbishment which we hardly noticed. The room was excellent. Well designed, spacious main  bedroom area, small functional bathroom which worked for one person but not two. Unsurprisingly everything worked in the room, and hotel service was exemplary. However we found the breakfast expensive even for London standards although having recently stayed at a couple of different London hotels this year, The Churchill would be my preference. However it didn't achieve my internal 5* standard since it only had instant coffee only in the room",5,2015,11,18
150,Don't expect to be welcomed if you don't fit the 'preferred customer' type.,"The overall hotel and experience was well below what I've experienced at Hyatt's around the world.  Maybe my time is Asia has spoilt me, but as a frequent traveller and diamond member this was disappointing.

The purpose of my stay was our 1st wedding anniversary so we decided to travel to London for the day and stay at the hotel for the evening.  After a lovely day with friends our arrival was greeted with a polite words yet curtly spoken welcome while being 'assessed' as to suitability to be staying at the hotel.  It was clear that we were not deemed as 'the usual guests of this hotel'.   Additionally even though the reservation was in my name, the staff member looked at my husband and directed most questions to him.  The whole check in process made me feel very uncomfortable.  After finding our reservation and confirming my Diamond status, we were not offered the choice to continue check in or move to the Club floor for check in (as I have been in other HR's).   Both my husband and I were asked for photo ID, even though I was paying on my Hyatt Credit Card to which the reservation had been booked.  When asked for the reasoning for this I was advised that the photo would be updated on my rewards profile.  I've never heard or been asked this before and it sounded like an excuse and continued to make us feel even more unwelcome.  If it is now a Hyatt 'policy/feature' then at a bare minimum the customer should be given a choice and permission granted to update their profile .  We were finally checked in and given keys.  I had to ask where to find the Club lounge and was then given the details of times/where etc.  We were advised about the gym however without prompting.  

The rest of the stay was reasonably pleasant, the suite room is tired and needs renovating (I'm assuming that it yet to be completed as part of the renovations).  The bathroom was very small for a suite with no upgrade features, just a shower over bath, toilet and basin.  There were no extractor fans and the whole bathroom was damp with condensation after use.  Room was a decent size for a suite, furniture was tired and quite marked.  Room was clean with no issues.

Club lounge was fine, staff pleasant but over attentive.  Items would just be finished and barely placed back on the table before being collected.  

We did receive the late checkout requested and the process was straight forward on the Club floor.  The same staff member who checked us in, checked us out.  He was more pleasant during process - made he was pleased we were leaving?
  
Most people we know are similar to ourselves and therefore we would not recommend the hotel to them.  There are more welcoming hotels with the same amenities in a lower price bracket.",2,2015,11,17
150,Beware of this hotel for multiple reasons!,"I responded to hotel survey which was supposed to be forwarded to trip advisor but have not seen it. We stayed from November 4 through November 10. The construction when I booked this summer was supposed to be complete by November which it was not. We had paid for an upgraded  room ( facing a park) that was so noisy it was pretty unbelievable. Work started at around 9:30 (one day it started earlier) and lasted throughout the day til late afternoon. Our room was not a place we wanted to be which is a shame when you book a stay for six days for vacation. I asked other guests on elevator if they were heard construction & they did. Hotels should not rent out rooms when they cannot deliver basic services especially when you pay a lot of money for a hotel room that is suppose to be reputable and nice. We were at the end of our trip to England or we would have found another hotel. Many nice hotels everywhere in Mayfair area from Meridian, Marriot, and boutique hotels so plenty of good choices.The bathroom is like a closet and the customer service at front desk by the pompous young men who staff it is really bad. Very condescending attitudes and several incidences that reinforced our negative opinion of this hotel. Our room keys consistently did not work well. One of the young men at front desk seemed to imply that it was our fault putting it to close to credit cards, etc. At one point I could not get it to open my door at all and ( with packages in hand) returned to front desk to ask for help. The young guy at front desk followed me back up exasperated but low and behold his key did not work either. He left me standing in the hallway for probably fifteen to twenty minutes (with no offer to help me with packages or no apology at all for my inconvenience) to wait alone for security to open my door. Door needed a new battery after all so I suppose my husband and I were not quite as inept as implied by the snarky front desk guys.  Another day I casually requested a newspaper (which is usually available at most of the hotels where we have stayed) but was sternly lectured by one of the young arrogant clerk  than I would have to pay for it ( which I didn't mind doing) but really what is all the ""drama"" about over such an insignificant issue? I am a retired high school and  college instructor. I like young people but the haughty attitude of the young men working the front desk at this hotel  is pretty over the top. We travel to England every year ( to visit my sister) and we will not return to this hotel even though we are Hyatt platinum members. Again  many other nice hotels in the area for the same value so do your research and stay somewhere else. I have yet to have any feedback from hotel management about our experience which seems to be par for the course at this particular hotel. Wifi was erratic in hotel which was also a hassle.",1,2015,11,16
150,Lovely place,"The hotel is very nice, comfortable and neat. We had a lovely but had an issue with the new refurbished upper en-suite. They need to have a better quality check, unluckily the contractors forgot to stick the retainer strip with glue and the whole bathroom flooded when we showered.",4,2015,11,16
150,"Traditional Hotel, Ultra Modern Service Levels","My wife and I were in town for a friends 50th birthday party, on Saturday night. We thought we would make a weekend of it so booked lunch in town and then a room at The Churchill. I first stayed here back in 1984 and my memories were of a pretty special place with a great location. Very much still the case although the hotel is now even better. We were running late, thanks to engineering work on the Brighton line, so had to literally drop our bags and dash off again in order not to be late for our luncheon reservation. The staff were fantastic, taking our bags from us in seconds and assuring us they would already be in the room by the time we checked in later in the afternoon. Sure enough, this was the case with my wife's dress hanging neatly in the wardrobe. The room was clean, bright and tidy with graet TV and wifi. Helpful door staff secured us taxis later in the evening and after a great nights sleep we enjoyed a first rate breakfast on Sunday morning. Would recommend upgrading to a room on the 8th floor which then includes drinks and snacks in the lounge. A great hotel experience.",5,2015,11,16
150,So so close to excellent ,"We arrived on anrelatively quiet Saturday afternoon. Check in was faultless, except being asked for photos ID, beware if traveling here. We sat with some friends in the Churchill bar and the service was not great. We waited sometimes 15 minutes for a drink order, there was only 12 people in the whole bar. The food we ate was good and not over priced considering where we were. We were overall impressed at this point. Then the nightmare started. After going to the room to put my tuxedo on I came back to the bar. Whilst sitting at the bar one of the waiters decided to spill a whole drink down my jacket which went through to my waistcoat. He then started running around rubbing my jacket with a dirty towel. At no point did he even apologise let alone get an offer for it to be dry cleaned. I know accidents happen but this is a £400 a night hotel!!  Breakfast lovely. Staff lovely. Location excellent. Tuxedo jacket- ruined! Would I return... Mmmm.... No. I'd go elsewhere for that kind of money. ",4,2015,11,15
150,"Great Location, Great Service","This hotel is very close to the financial areas as well as Oxford shopping district, just a few blocks away from Selfridges' Department Store.  Rooms very extremely clean and well appointed.  Good security to even open the elevator doors and an excellent hotel club with nice breakfast and snacks during the day and evening cocktail hour.",5,2015,11,14
150,Best start to our honeymoon,"My wife and I couldn't be happier with our stay at he Hyatt Regency.  When we arrived we were checked in by Sebastian. He was very kind.  When we told him we just got married and this was our first stop on our honeymoon, I didn't realize that he made sure late that evening a handcrafted desert and champaign were going to be waiting for us in our room.  The hotel was clean, centrally located, and had superior service.  We look forward to coming back to the Hyatt in the future.  Thanks again for such a memorable experience.",5,2015,11,14
150,Friday night,"Very high quality hotel. Easy check in and service for our bags. Very good location from Paddington , for the west end and tube network. Excellent bar with terrace. Very good bottled ales. Room very good with typical Hyatt large bed. It's the small things that count , they even put a small cake and a glass of bubbly in the room for my wife's birthday . Well done great service.",5,2015,11,14
150,Charming Hotel- Great Location,"From check-in to check out the staff were very helpful, polite and appreciative of our business.  The rooms are very clean and well decorated as well as peaceful and quiet for relaxing after long strolls around the neighborhood.  We would stay here again when in London.  The decor throughout the hotel was classy and yet modern feel with excellent patinas of colour and comfortable furnishings.  Warm and inviting.",5,2015,11,13
150,"Don""t stay at Churchill-better hotels for the money","As a Hyattt Gold member my husband and I expected better customer service especially for a six night stay.  The construction noise was totally  unacceptable even though we were told when we booked this summer construction would be complete by November. We did pay for an upgraded room and given  a ""park"" view on the fifth floor when we checked in. After 9:30a.m. every morning of our stay (one day the noise started earlier) our room was not a place we wanted to be due to hammering, loud drilling and construction that carried on until late afternoon. When we travel on holiday we like our hotel room to be a sanctuary  but this was a bit like a nightmare. If I were younger we would have definitely found another nice hotel in Mayfair area (we saw a lot of other nice hotels) but this trip we didn't have the energy to pursue that option because this was the tail end of our trip to England and we were too tired to make the transition. I did ask another guest in the elevator if her room was noisy and she said it was noisy as well. For the money this hotel charges they should reconsider letting people make reservations here until they complete their renovation but in addition to the construction they have other issues. Very poor customer service at front desk. Bathrooms are extremely tiny (like a closet) and poor  internet service.  The biggest issue for us was very poor customer service by front desk staff. My husband had to get several replacement keys during our stay due to inoperable door lock even though he was told by ""snarky"" front desk clerk  it was probably his fault  key was not working due to his placement next to phone, etc. On one particular day (after a long day of shopping with packages in hand) I was left standing to wait in hallway at least fifteen minutes (after previously being escorted to my room by arrogant young front desk guy whose key also failed to open my room door) to wait for security to let me into my hotel room. What astounded me was the attitude of the desk clerk who basically walked away with no apologies or offers to accommodate me in any way while I waited for help to get into my own room which I was paying for. As it turned out the ""key"" issue wasn't our fault because ""we"" were so inept as implied by the front desk clerk but rather because the battery in our door lock was low. Gee what a surprise! Really ""back of the hand"" treatment by staff concerning this situation. I also casually requested a  newspaper one day and was given a stern lecture by a arrogant young kid at front desk on how the newspapers were absolutely not free  and I would certainly be  charged for this service. Really? All this drama for requesting a newspaper?    My husband and I are very ""friendly"" folks but  to be lectured to by a young ""arrogant"" little punk guy who worked the front desk about receiving a newspaper was kind of the last straw. This experience has really soured us on using this hotel ever again and even turned us off to the Hyatt franchise in general. In Paris, London and Brussels we have had very good experiences with  Marriots,  Meridians and Westin hotels so check out those chains as well as the other many neat looking boutique hotels in the Mayfair area of London.  As a retired high school teacher I like young folks a lot but the snotty little guys that the Churchill hires to work their front desk needs to be addressed or this hotel will continue to lose customers. This experience was not just an overnight stay but a six night stay and we are so disappointed by the way we were treated. My sister lives outside London so we come to London on a regular basis but will not stay here again. Do your homework and read the reviews.",1,2015,11,12
150,Great Family Stay,"The rooms are well done with good views. Large bathrooms.
The location of hotel is a plus point. Staff was knowledgeable and looked after us very well.
food was ok, but the restaurant is quite nice with lot of options available.",5,2015,11,12
150,Great to be back,"I have been staying at the Churchill for many years, but this time I was able to experience the newly renovated rooms (during two stays in October).  I was very impressed with the rooms.  The decor is simple and elegant.  The best comes in the bathroom. It is very modern and stylish (even the toilet is one of those ultra modern ones with push buttons to warm your seat and do all sorts of other things!). The best is the walk-in rain shower cubicle. No more climbing into a bath-tub to take a shower. You simply walk in and enjoy a relaxing shower.
The service is still wonderful, especially the check-in, the concierge desk and the restaurant where the most delicious breakfasts are served. That smoked salmon has got to be the finest! Yes, there was noise in the floor I was on (the sixth floor) due to renovations.  I was warned about it and, frankly, wasn't too bothered with it.  It is not something that will last.  All in all, the Churchill still remains my favorite London hotel.",5,2015,11,12
150,Excellent Experience,"We stayed here on a girls trip. Accommodations on the 9th floor were lovely. Rooms were super clean with very nice linens and pillows. Our room, 907 was spacious. It did not have much of a view. The hotel bar was excellent with really wonderful memorable Bloody Mary's. The food was also great. Hotel staff was attentive. Transportation arranged by the hotel was excellent. Check out was quick and easy. Can't wait to come back!",5,2015,11,11
150,Excellent stay!,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a long weekend with my husband.  The check in experience was very good.  Daniele was fast, friendly and very efficient.  We got a nice room overlooking Portman Square.  The room was spacious, nicely decorated with great Molton Brown amenities.  The turn down service is excellent and the housekeepers are really great to answer any need.  There is free WIFI in the rooms and the common areas but it is really bad.  It was disconnecting all the time and sometimes was not really working, this needs to be looked into.  Breakfast at the Montagu is nice.  They do have a good variety of things to eat, but I would think such a hotel would have more choices of cheeses, cold cuts and fruits, I wasn't very impressed.  The staff at breakfast is friendly but most of the time you could feel they were stressed and needed more help.  A very special thank you to the amazing concierge Sahile (Not sure I spelled his name right).  He was extremely helpful, very pleasant to work with and very polite.  The location of the hotel is amazing! It is a couple minutes walk from Oxford Street, New Bond Street, and within walking distance from Regent Street etc.. I would love to stay there again and would strongly recommend it for anyone visiting London on business or pleasure.",5,2015,11,06
150,Recently renovated. Very nice hotel.,"I stayed with my wife during the Rugby World Cup. The hotel was being renovated, but we did not hear any loud noises. The room was very well appointed and service was great. The best is the bar in the hotel. Location is perfect. We definitely recommend it.",5,2015,11,03
150,Renovation detracts from a great hotel,"I have stayed at the Churchill many times over the past years, but this was my first visit after their 3-month closure at the end of last year. The most important factor is that they are in the process of renovations. There is thus noise and bustle during the day. The in-house fitness centre is closed, but an alternative is available a few minutes walk from the hotel. The downside is that it only opens at 6:30am, a big negative for me as that is around the time I leave for the office. Clearly rainy weather is also not ideal for the walk to the fitness centre. We unfortunately stayed in a yet to be renovated room, which was showing signs of wear and tear. We also had water gurgling back up the bath drainage pipe which left a residue in the bath each day. The in room wifi was poor and could not be relied upon for even general emailing at times. So much for the negatives. The staff are generally great, friendly and helpful - especially in the Regency Club. The food was excellent. The hotel's location near Marble Arch and Oxford street is superb. This is a great hotel, but a word of caveat during the renovations prices",3,2015,11,03
150,"Its being refurbished.... the builders start work at 0800 in the AM, drilling and banging etc","This is in a great location for central London, the staff are friendly and attentive, and like all the hotels in the group they are great. But currently they are refurbishing the hotel and the builders start early in the AM to put in the new rooms. Consequently it is very noisy and they start work at 0800, apparently they will be finished mid next year ",3,2015,10,31
150,Superb hotel in central London,Very nice hotel located at Portman Square. Close to shopping and restaurants. Very friendly and serviceminded staff. The room had recently been renovated and the bed was really topclass. The breakfast was again topclass and had a good selection of dishes.,5,2015,10,31
150,Churchills Hyatt Regency,"lovely hotel look forward to visiting again. I intend to stay monthly the hotel is in the perfect spot for shopping, theatre and if it is the reason you are in London Harley and Whimpole street..Breackfast was wonderful and room service was quick and superb. Lunch in Churchill's bar was also very good.",5,2015,10,31
150,Shame it was only one night!,"Stayed Wednesday 28th October with my daughter in a twin club room.  All the staff we encountered were really helpful and couldn't do enough for you.  Natalia checked us in and took time showing us to our room and explaining everything - she was great, thank you. The hotel itself is just off Oxford St, brilliantly situated for shopping, another good reason to go back!",5,2015,10,30
150,Excellent stay,"As someone who has been to many Hyatt's here in the States, this one may top them all. The staff was extremely kind and helpful during our travels and was eager to help us when needed. We attended the Chef's table one night at the Montagu restaurant and the food was superb! I recommend ordering the cooked crispy suffolk pork belly, pork filet wrapped in pancetta with herb potatoes. Amazing!! I would also recommend driver Nicolas if you require a driver, he was excellent.  ",5,2015,10,28
150,"Lovely hotel, great staff","During our 6 night stay the facility and staff were consistently excellent. We loved our location across from Portman Square. We had easy access to places of interest and walked for the most part, though it was easy to hail a cab if needed. The hotel has been recently renovated and done so in a very attractive manner. The color scheme is soothing and elegant.",5,2015,10,27
150,Excellent service and concierge,"We stayed at the Churchill as the first stop on our European honeymoon. The front desk staff were excellent and helpful, and they also left us a nice gift of champagne and chocolate on the first night. The hotel is situated within quick walking distance of the Marble Arch and Bond Underground stations, from which travel to Westminster, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, and London Tower is quick and easy. There is also easy access to multiple bus stops like George St, which will take you to the British Museum, Euston, and St Pancras International if you are going to take the Eurostar, or on Oxford that will take you down to Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square.

The room was fairly spacious, with a king sized bed. There was no coffee pot, but coffee was available for free downstairs since our breakfast was included. The bathroom had one of those bidet toilets with heated seats. I'm not a fan of bidets, but I love heated seats. The water heating system in the shower was a little odd, the water would randomly get hotter in waves, then go back to lower temps. The whole room was a little cold to me, even though we maxed out the thermostat at 25C. Keep in mind I'm from California where temps are regularly over 28C and go up to 43C, so perhaps this was just me.

Most of my gripes were small ones. I didn't like the rough towels and the pillows that didn't hold their shape at all (and please buy king sized pillows for king beds!). The wifI kept disconnecting on my husband's iPhone although my Samsung Note 3 seemed to work fine. The room service was quick and not unreasonaby priced (for London), and the free breakfast was good. Overall, I wouldn't mind staying here again!",4,2015,10,24
150,The Churchill,The Regency Club staff are fantastic and so helpful. The hotel has a prime location for everything one would want to do in London. It is a few minutes walk from Oxford Street and this makes up for the lack of in hotel amenity shopping.,5,2015,10,21
150,Lots of style,Spent two nights in a Regency Club room. Room is not large but has everything you need. Bathroom is clean and functional and the beds very comfortable. Club facilities are excellent and staff very professional. An upmarket hotel that does not fail to impress,5,2015,10,20
150,Points stay for leisure visit,"This is a lovely hotel but the customer service is not in line with the cost. The outlets are horribly expensive, 15 pounds for a cocktail and 30 pounds for breakfast. There is a Patisserie Valerie a few blocks away that has a lovely breakfast for about 8 to 10 pounds.",4,2015,10,18
150,Fantastic stay!,"Beautiful and elegant hotel in a great location. Professional and helpful staff. 
We were in one of the Portman Square View King Room on the seventh floor, overlooking a small park. The window insulation is amazing and we did not hear any traffic noise. We also did not hear any noise from the renovation that is still going on in the hotel. The breakfast buffet is probably the best we ever had, with an excellent choice of food that can also be complemented by an a la carte menu. We stayed at the hotel for two nights and we were celebrating my husband's birthday. We got greeted by Prosecco and a cake upon arrival. What a nice gesture from the staff! We were sorry we had to leave so soon and we will definitely go back next time we are in London.",5,2015,10,18
150,"Great service, fresh rooms","The hotel is still under refurbishing from the fire, which meant our room was brand new. There is work underway from around 9am to 5pm (I think), but it is constant through office hours. The service was great. The staff was superb. Friendly, kind, and accommodating. The gym is closed but free access to the Home House is available, which has a great facility. Parents and I loved our meal our last night at The Montagu (lobby restaurant). We highly recommend the experience.",5,2015,10,17
150,Full Service 5 Star Hotel,"This luxury hotel has everything that you could possibly need.  Friendly helpful staff beginning with the doorman who will valet park your car, remember your name and retrieve your glasses if you happened to leave them in the car.  The lobby is large, open and welcoming. The reception staff were friendly, professional and helpful.  The rooms are great, our only complaint was that the bathrooms are a bit dated and the deluxe rooms only have showers in the tub.  At the present moment the hotel is operating on three floors because the rooms are being renovated so hopefully the bathrooms will be upgraded.

There is a one Michelin star restaurant in the hotel, Locanda Locatelli.

The Bar is warm and inviting with lots of atmosphere.  There is an outdoor cigar and smoking terrace off of this Bar with comfortable seating, heat lamps and rugs.",5,2015,10,14
150,Another Great Stay At The Churchill,"This was my fourth stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill, and the first since the gas explosion last Fall.  I did not know what to expect upon arrival, but if I had not known what happened I would only have thought that a multi-Pound renovation was in progress.  Construction is during business hours, but I did not experience any disruption or hear any noise.  (My room was on the 9th floor, so I was pretty far removed from it.)  The public areas were business as usual.  The staff at this hotel is superb (especially at the Regency Club), and they always welcome me warmly.  The location is also excellent and fairly central -- within walking distance to the Bond Street and Marble Arch tube stations.  The regular guest rooms are not what I would characterize as ""spacious,"" but this is London!  (I upgraded to a suite, which was more than enough room and well worth it.)  My suite had a 110V power outlet.  I don't know if the standard guest rooms also have 110V outlets, as I have always upgraded to a suite.  Note to you fitness buffs:  The fitness center is undergoing a facelift as part of the renovations, so the Churchill is temporarily sending guests to a fitness center across the street.  Allow some extra time on the first day to get the lay of the land, but it was only a minor inconvenience, and by Day 2 I felt like a ""regular.""    Since I am a repeat visitor, I can state with confidence that all of my experiences at this hotel have been very consistent and satisfactory.",5,2015,10,13
150,USP IS THE LOCATION,"Hotel is under massive refurbishment so stay away as only 3 floors are operational. Well located but shocking lounge and fare offered so for a vacation this property is not recommended.

Mixed nationality and very average staff did not help either so clearly not a hotel I want to go back to as much as I like the Hyatt brand. No senior management visible though we were there for 6 nights.",3,2015,10,13
150,A treasure in Portland Square,The Churchill has always been a welcoming and warm classic hotel. The staff remember your preferences with a smile and could not be more helpful. It is close to Marble Arch and Oxford street but is a sea of tranquility form the hoards of people in the West end. The Molton Brown toiletries are restocked twice a day and smell fabulous. The club lounge has an excellent food and beverage offering. I can highly recommend this classic hotel.,5,2015,10,12
150,Home away from home,"This review may include more than needed detail but due to a medical emergency we made the Churchill our ""home away from home"" for two weeks.) The Hyatt Regency the Churchill is one of the best hotels in any chain that we have experienced. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful but not overwhelming. The rooms are well appointed with every amenity.  (The lower three floors are being renovated which will only enhance the property.) 
The club lounge offers breakfast until 11 a.m. which takes the pressure off getting a wake-up call on vacation.  The evening canapés is a misnomer because the ""buffet"" offers salad, cheeses, chips, crackers, breads, nuts, cold hors d'oeuvres, hot pass-arounds, desert and cakes.  To complement the food, there is complementary wine or Prosecco, cold beverages, espressos, coffees and cappuccino.  The service is outstanding. Unlike most lounges we have experienced, there is a full staff replenishing platters until the very last minutes, removing dirty plates and asking if there is anything they can get for you.  Everyone is a star and that would include (but not limited to) Chu, Kolby, Gita, Daniella, Beatrice, Ava, Clara, Carla, Jose, Antonin, Rosalina.  We looked forward to sampling the different themed buffets: Mediterranean, Asian, Italian or English. Besides the food component (being foodies) housekeeping and turndown was exceptional (always done with a smile and friendly hello by Monica and Marlena).  The location of the hotel is great being a short distance to Oxford Street, Marble Arch, the tube and the buses.  The concierge desk at reception (Joe and Shahil) or at the club 8th floor level (Melvy, Ashley and Antonin) were helpful, welcoming and pleasant.  The management staff, with whom we were fortunate enough to meet, Michael Gray and Katherine, would explain why the employees of this property seem to want to please. 
The Hyatt Regency the Churchill is expensive but if one can afford the luxury of a wonderful experience in an exciting city, this is the place to stay!",5,2015,10,11
150,Great stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Churchill earlier this week.  Our stay was wonderful.  All of the staff  we met- front desk, restaurants, room service, bellman, etc were extremely friendly and helpful.  We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to friends.",5,2015,10,10
150,Wonderful Experience ,"Had a wonderful experience here at the Hyatt.  Staff took great care of us during our visit to London.  We were always welcomed with a warm greeting upon entering the building and our hotel room would always be clean when we would come back from exploring the city.  The Regency Club was a great plan to relax after countless hours of walking through the city. Staff inside lounge were very attenditve and took great care of us during our stay there, Especially Eva who works in the Regency club. She was very friendly and provided great service during my stay at the lounge.  I highly recommend staying at the Hyatt Regency Churchill Hotel. ",5,2015,10,06
150,"Nice hotel, not so great staff","My mom and I checked in to the hotel on 1st - 3rd October 2015. When we arrived, there was no one to help us with our bags. We have to lug our 5 bags ourselves. We requested the room to be pre-checked in on 30th Sept since we were arriving early on 1st Oct. When we tried to check in at 9 am on 1st Oct, we were informed that we do not have any reservation. We informed the front desk officer (Indian lady) that our room was pre-checked in on 30th Sept, and if she could refer to the previous day arrival. She insist that our booking was not in the system.( I worked at the Front Desk before so I do know how to check for arrivals/guest in house). Luckily another associate was there and he found our registration card and we were able to go up to our room. The suite (806) itself was very nice, with separate living and bedroom but facing the back of the hotel. We had breakfast at the Club Lounge and the selection was quite good. The staff on the 8th floor were impersonal/cold, no greetings when we walk pass.
We checked out quite early on 3rd, and decided to have breakfast @Montagu. The restaurant only opens at 7 am on the dot, not a minute earlier. There were a few guest who have to leave at 7, and they requested if they could just grab something to go. But the staffs were adamant that the guests wait until they are open eventhough they might be late. The breakfast was okay I supposed. Overall, the hotel itself was good, location is great (2 minutes from Oxford St)but the staffs are awful. Would not recommend.",2,2015,10,04
150,Invariably Delightful with Truly Exceptional Staff,"Everything about the Churchill (location, rooms, services, etc) is excellent but it is the staff that really make the experience very special -- better than any at any hotel I have stayed at, in 45 years of travelling around the world.    Throughout the  hotel, they are exceptionally warm, welcoming, personable and attentive as well as invariably efficient and courteous.    And the Regency Club is a super haven/resource -- and a great deal deal",5,2015,10,03
150,A superb hotel,If you can afford to stay here you will not be disappointed. World class in all ways. The club floor experience is sophisticated and useful at multiple times of day. Location is excellent. Staff is knowledgeable and responsive. We have stayed there a few times and will do so on future London trips.,5,2015,10,03
150,Great staff,"The Hyatt Churchill is a high class hotel, but what makes it outstanding is the staff. Every one is professional, friendly, helpful and welcoming. The best I have experienced, turning a routine work trip into something enjoyable",5,2015,09,27
150,"Beautiful Hotel, Good Location","The hotel lobby was very pretty and the staff super helpful with allowing us to check in early after a long overnight flight with little sleep. The room was a decent size for London, and very clean and comfortable. We were able to do a late check out (good thing as we were up late the night before as we attended a wedding!) and allowed us the use of a shower on the club level prior to our flight out that night. The location was close to the Marble Arch tube line (Central Line) and close to restaurants/shopping as well. Overall, we were happy and would stay there again if visiting London.",5,2015,09,26
150,Great facility with even better service at one of the best spots in London,"We visited London for a summer vacation and stayed at Hyatt Regency. The facility it self is top grade as expected of a Hyatt but the super nice service offered to us made it all the more special. We were upgraded to a suite which was highlight of the stay but beyond that the staff was very cordial and always ready to help and go the extra mile to accommodate our requirements. The location is amazing (5 mins to Hyde Park, Regent street etc.) . Highly recommeded",5,2015,09,25
150,Great staff at a Great Hotel,"The staff of the Hyatt Regency Churchill London are absolutely amongst the world's best.Friendly, courteous, helpful and always there when you need them. They made our stay a truly unforgettable stay and we hope to see them again soon",5,2015,09,23
150,Wow Factor & Ideal Hotel,"We did not want to stay in Hyatt Hotel as we had a bad experience when we stayed in the Hyatt at TST in Hong Kong last year. We received a message from the USA office asking us try the Hyatt brand one more time. We are glad we gave them a second chance.

My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt to celebrate our 10th anniversary in London at the Churchill.  We were upgraded to a club room by surprise. The room was wonderful as was the free breakfast.  It was a very classy and smart looking hotel which was a pleasure to stay in. The check-in staff was perfectly welcoming. We wish we could remember the young lady's name and the guy's name in level eight.

Some staff stood out as being more helpful and gracious than others in the restaurant but in general everyone was very caring and excellent.  I can guarantee that as my wife gave a tip to the staff who stood out to her. The location is also very conveniently located but not at all overly busy with tourists. Will definitely go back! The Hyatt Regency Churchill is now a must stay for us whenever we visit London. The location of this hotel is unbeatable. Walking distance from Marble Arch and Oxford Street, the hotel is very well laid out. We stayed four day and were sad to leave.

Just want to say thank you to Mr Michael Gray and your team.",5,2015,09,22
150,Very Nice and Comfortable Hotel,"My favorite parts of this hotel were that the bed was so comfortable and the shower was great!  I am very picky and found this room very comfortable, well appointed and large enough for our luggage (we were traveling for several weeks).  Loved the Molton Brown products---and they were well-stocked, not skimpy like some hotels.  This was the first hotel on the trip so finding a great shower and an extremely comfortable bed we quite welcome!
The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  We only had breakfast at the hotel but is was wonderful.  If you didn't pre-book it you can at check in for a discounted price.  It had a great selection---loved the fruit and yogurt!
Also loved that they had plenty of light and outlets in the room.  Even a USA plug outlet----thank you!  Plenty of options for charging your stuff.  Also they had well appointed mirrors---again thank you for not loading up the room with cheap art and instead have well placed mirrors so that we don't have to both stand in the bathroom to get ready.  I could do my hair and make up in the room.  Yay!
Very nice hotel.  Will be happy to stay there again.",4,2015,09,20
150,"Beautiful Hotel, Perfect Location",Lovely hotel.  Within walking distance to many restaurants and to the Marble Arch subway station.  Wonderful staff.  Only complaint would be the bed that was too hard. Hotel was quiet too.  I'm a light sleeper and noise levels are important to me.  No issues with noise at all.  We would definitely return to this hotel.,5,2015,09,17
150,Ideal hotel in busy city,"I have visited several times and it is one of my favourite hotels in the world.  Room overlooking the park is best.  Rooms simple, elegant, clean and comfortable.  Art in main areas from Saatchi gallery and is quite challenging but exciting too. Attention in the restaurant is excellent. Reception could be both more efficient and personable. Staff not as good at being helpful and gracious as those in the restaurant.",5,2015,09,16
150,Wonderful hotel,"Great hotel.  Staff was very helpful, they couldn't do enough for us.  At our request they suggested several close by restaurants which we also enjoyed. 

 We also ate breakfast in the hotel one morning which was ver good as well.",5,2015,09,15
150,Centrally located in beautiful LONDON!,Gorgeous. Centrally located. LOVED the sleeping Queen in the foyer!  We were travelling with a group for three days prior to taking a Regent Cruise of the Balkans.  Was a great location to walk to various London attractions. Closet to subway. All around great.,5,2015,09,15
150,Spent a six nights at the Churchill while vacationing in London,"The hotel location is ideal for those wishing to be near Buckingham Palace, Westminster
And The Houses of Parliament. The Churchill is two blocks from Hyde Park and the Margle Arch. The Palace is an easy 15 minute walk from the hotel. Speakers Corner is right by the Arch and during the weekend the orations found there are beyond anything you have ever experienced.

The Hotel was wonderful, out room faced a park directly across the street from the entrance. Breakfast was included with our room and the selections were great. There is also an Italian restaurant, not affiliated with the Hotel on the property and it is well worth your giving it a try. The hotel staff do a great job, with sight seeing ideas and directions. 

If you are looking to shop, Oxford Street, one of the longest such in London is two blocks away. It connects with Rengency and Old Bond streets, you can shop until you drop.

The American Embassy is less than 10 minutes away on a beautiful park.

Restaurants abound all around the hotel as well as local pubs and local food.

I heartedly recommend this property, you will not be sorry.",5,2015,09,15
150,Good location and Quiet Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for four days in September. It recently reopened and they are renovating several floors at a time but we never saw or heard any construction.
Location is off Oxford Street just north of Mayfair. The bar, Churchhill's, is popular with local business people in their outdoor patio, but the inside is uncrowded.
Overall, a nice hotel but not near a lot of tourist venues. Close to shopping however.
Popular with high end tour groups.",4,2015,09,15
150,Friendly & awesome ,"We stayed in club rooms for 3 nights and enjoyed everything from setup and cleanliness of our rooms  to afternoon snack. 
The personnel was really nice everywhere. Some ladies at breakfast didn't speak good English, but they really tried and that was absolutely charming. 
Location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing. 
Only negative thing is that they put too many good chocolates and other sweets in this ""snacking room"" on the top floor and that is really tempting and bad for the figure ;)",5,2015,09,15
150,Elegant yet friendly and warm Hotel,"The Hyatt Regency Churchill is now a must stay for us whenever we visit London. The location of this hotel is unbeatable. Walking distance from Marble Arch and Oxford Street, the hotel is very well laid out. The Montagu has very good breakfast. There was construction going on on some floors of the hotel when we stayed, but that hardly made much difference. We stayed a week and were sorry to leave. The rooms are a trifle small, but well laid out. Housekeeping this time was a little shoddy at times, but in other visits it has been outstanding. The staff are the best part of the hotel. Rarely do they greet you without a smile. And most of them go out of their way to be helpful. Overall, very good value for money by London standards.",4,2015,09,15
150,Hyatt standard right near Oxford Street,"It has to be said that London is terribly expensive (especially against AUD) so I could only afford to stay here by using my Hyatt points. 

It was a typical, quality Hyatt standard, which plays on its Churchill 'connections' but is not out of the ordinary. 

The room was a good size and the bathroom was a fair size (though I personally dislike showers over baths and would much rather have a decent shower). 

The TV and in-room iPad didn't work which, when I tried to inform reception, the young person suggested I didn't know what I was doing. That was not so, and it was a silly thing for her to say. 

The room service was good but expensive for what it was. I didn't have breakfast there due to cost, and the gym was closed for renovations - something they don't have notified on their website. 

Location was good - Selfridges minutes away - but I was only there for business so it made no difference to me. ",3,2015,09,14
150,London indulgence,"Wonderful reception, service and overnight stay. Great local Pub recommendations from the Concierge. Clean and comfortable room. Fantastic swish bathroom with bath to soak in after long hot day in busy London. Spoilt!",5,2015,09,13
150,A classy hotel with a positive attitude,"The Churchill Hyatt has now become a hotel I go out of my way to stay at. Although not cheap, it is comparable to most London 5 star hotels in price. The staff are great, and very warm and welcoming. The rooms, although a trifle small, are very comfortable indeed. The Montagu is a great place to eat. We had a few issues with housekeeping, but not everything can be perfect",5,2015,09,10
150,Great Experience,The experience was better than my very high expectations. The staff were all very helpful and proactive in making our stay a great experience.  Combine the service with a quality property and you can't do better.,5,2015,09,07
150,A perfect place to stay in London,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at The Churchill for our sightseeing trip to London.  The service was excellent and the location so convenient.  Just a few blocks away you can hop on the Big Bus tour or ride the tube from Marble Arch.  When we arrived we were upgraded to the concierge level (Thank you, Pia!) which allowed us to enjoy a delicious breakfast each morning.  We also appreciated the flatiron and the floor fan that were available for us to borrow.  Small things - but greatly appreciated.  Our room was very comfortable.  There was even a 110 plug on the desk which eliminated the need for a converter for our American electrical devices.  I know it is expensive but we used Hyatt points for this trip. (It pays to be loyal!)  We would definitely stay at The Churchill again and highly recommend it!  Well done!!!",5,2015,09,06
150,Not a bad option,Went here for a function the other night and was relatively impressed. Felt very looked after by the staff. Great food and wine. Hotel was very nicely furnished as well. Lovely decor and the bar and restaurant area was a great place to hang out ,4,2015,09,06
150,Superb,"We have stayed here quite a few times and never had a bad visit. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms (they are currently under going a big renovation) are spacious,light and well appointed and the hotel located just off oxford st, close to heaps of restaurants, bars and shops etc

This is our favourite hotel (for the money) in London!",5,2015,09,05
150,Wonderful Stay and Impressive Renovation,"This hotel is well situated, undergoing a renovation which is very high end and the people who work there are simply wonderful. Stayed there for a weekend and was luckily upgraded to really impressive room. Food was fantastic and a big thanks to all the staff there for being so friendly and helpful.",5,2015,09,03
150,Service above and beyond,"We came along to Afternoon Tea in the Montagu restaurant and what a totally splendid afternoon we had thanks in great part to the extraordinarily wonderful service we received. 

From the moment we entered the hotel we were greeted by smiling and welcoming staff, all of whom were genuinely interested in making our stay special.

We had The Mad Hatter's Tea Party tea which was sublime ! Fun and yummy just lovely.

But for me and my guests the service we received from every single member of staff was some of the best I have experienced in the world, and I do not say that lightly.

If this is a reflection of the Churchill I cannot wait to return to stay for much longer.",5,2015,09,01
150,"Can the Churcill Hotel adopt us, please?","We're staying at the Churchill right now and having a fabulous time. We were upgraded to a suite (without asking!). Francesca, at the front desk, took us personally to our room, giving us a mini hotel tour on the way. Gita and her crew in the Regency Club have pampered us beyond belief. We are currently trying to figure out if we can sell our place in the U.S. And move in to the Churchill permanently. Seriously: amazing, central location; lovely property; and the best, most personalized service from the staff we've ever experienced! You will not be disappointed with this hotel.",5,2015,08,31
150,Anniversary celebration,"My husband and I stayed at the hyatt to celebrate our first anniversary, having got married at the hotel a year ago. We had dinner in the Montagu restaurant which was delicious and the service was very attentive. The room was also wonderful as was breakfast the next morning. A very classy smart hotel which was a pleasure to stay at. All the staff are very caring and service was brilliant. The location is also great very conveniently located but not at all touristy. It is right by Portman square which is lovely to look at. Will definitely go back!",5,2015,08,31
150,A fine hotel with a glitch or two,"The hotel itself is a classic but it had a few issues . Rooms were not ready on time BUT the porterage was perfect. The staff was courteous and attentive.  The rooms were comfortable and the food was fine. Great Coffee, believe it or not. 

Glitches, the afore mentioned room delay  and for one of our group ,a critical missed wake up call. Now, this call set into motion a small issue BUT the staff resolved it quickly, efficiently and made it whole. 

I'd go back in a hot second, the pluses far and away outweighing the minor minuses",4,2015,08,30
150,Never fails to impress,The Churchill never fails - superb.  Extremely professional.  Expert management and caring and efficient staff ensure maximum comfort and service.  Every visit is enjoyable and always a pleasure to return.,5,2015,08,30
150,Now this is service,"I booked my stay at the Hyatt Regency London for two nights with points. My flight arrived early morning to Heathrow and I took a Blacklane car to the hotel. They had upgraded my room because of my status with Hyatt, but the upgraded room wasn't ready. They offered to give me a standard room or I could wait for the upgrade. I opted to wait because I was going out to tour the city anyway (have to stay awake to get on London time). They checked my bags and took my number to call when the room was ready. The check-in staff was perfectly welcoming. I wish I could remember the young man's name. The hotel is located a block or so from Oxford St. and there are many restaurants and shops on the side streets as well. The bus tour companies have a main stop at Marble Arch that is a short walk from the hotel. 
When I returned the front desk staff escorted me to my room and gave me a tour of the amenities. My upgrade was a suite. You don't always get this when booking with points but as soon as I saw it I wish my stay in London was longer. The entryway led to a comfortable living area, walk-in closet, and bedroom. The bathroom was amazing with separate shower and tub and tv in the bathroom mirror. I really didn't want to leave my room. With my stay I had access to the club room which offered food, snacks, and drinks throughout the day. I found the staff in there a bit stuffy, but always polite. The next night I visited the bar. The best bartenders anywhere! I tried a few of the drinks on the menu and all were executed to perfection. Friendly,knowledgeable, attentive staff, everything a bar should be.",5,2015,08,30
150,Superb hotel in central London,"We stayed overnight for appointments in London and chose this hotel since I have Hyatt status as well as the central location to Mayfair and the West End.  The hotel is nothing spectacular from the outside, but the interiors are modern, calming and very welcoming.  The staff could not have been any nicer and every small request was met with immediacy.  They offered an upgrade which was so nice and unexpected.  We had in-room dining as well as dinner in the restaurant, and everything was fresh, tasty, and healthy (and reasonably priced for a central London high end hotel).  We could not have asked for a better stay in London.  
I mentioned to the staff that more US television channels would be a nice touch since there are not enough (in my opinion).  A quick note from management replied that they would look into it....so I can tell the message got delivered!
The bed was comfortable.  Crisp linens.  Wonderful towels were fluffy and new.  Snacks sent from the GM to welcome were a lovely touch.  
Overall, I cannot fault this hotel based on my stay there with my spouse.",5,2015,08,26
150,Comfortable room and fantastic service,"Had a great stay at the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.
The breakfast and evening cocktails at the Hyatt Regency lounge were great. 
With proximity to Oxford Street and Marble Arch subway station, made it a very convenient location to stay.
In particular, it is walking distance to Hyde Park and Kensington park where I enjoyed the nice stroll under the beautiful summer skies.  ",5,2015,08,23
150,Very good! ,"Very good food and cocktails!  Scenery is great and a wonderful outside heated seating area! I visit the bar regularly with family or Freinds, staff are very friendly, food is fabulous and if you enjoy a cigar they have a good selection to choose from! ",5,2015,08,22
150,Way Beyond Expectations,"Wife, son and I stayed for 3 days, on holiday. We had reserved a standard room but were upgraded to a beautiful suite with balcony.  While the room and overall property were elegant and extremely comfortable, the most striking thing about The Churchill is the staff. Amazingly attentive, welcoming, responsive, truly caring about every detail.  They had an amazing knack for making us feel like honored guests and part of the family at the same time.  We can't wait to return!",5,2015,08,19
150,Top Notch Service,"Stayed there with the family on a shirt visit to London.

This is still our favorite hotel when in London as the team is so warm, friendly and courteous that we would never contemplate staying anywhere else.

The location is fantastic and nothing is too much for the Team to assist.

It's an iconic hotel with top service at good rates. We will return!",5,2015,08,15
150,Superb Beyond Expectations,"Three nights of bliss. The property is beautiful, elegant but not stuffy, comfortable, exquisitely well maintained. But the staff are the true asset -- they are warm, friendly, knowledgeable, responsive, professional, attentive.  Right on target.",5,2015,08,13
150,Staff doesnot care,"We checked in today 11th August , made reservation couple of months ago and email and call the hotel to get interconnected rooms, we are two adults and two kids. Upon arrival the staff said they DONOT have any interconnected rooms avaliable and our rooms have one room in between . When we went to our room there are rooms in between . We try calling front desk and the phone was not working out of batteries called from speaker and they said only these are avaliable and they will fix the batteries. The guy came to change batteries moved the table and it broke , the hotel just got renovated , it took him an hour to get it fixed. We went to regency club at 10:30pm to have tea and want to take a pic but there were some ladies sitting over there thought we took their pic , they just got really furious and started to shout at us and grabbed our camera to see the pics the hotel staff was standing not even said a single word didnot call security or do anything while those ladies saw all pics in our camera to make sure we didnot have there pic. The staff just doesnot care while we get humiliated by those ladies even called the manger and explained what happened. The kids are so sacred after this they slept with us while we have two rooms .",1,2015,08,11
150,An oasis of old school charm,"The Hyatt Regency Portman Square, aka the Churchill, is an oasis of old school charm providing a relaxing environment in one of London's busiest locations. To boot, one of the best Hendricks gin and tonics I have ever had the pleasure of being served....",5,2015,08,10
150,Fantastic lunch,"We ate here for lunch on a friends recommendation. What a great decision, fantastic professional service and amazing, delicious food. 
A bit on the pricey side but well worth the money. We will be back",5,2015,08,07
150,Lunch at the restaurant,"We had recently a brunch at the hotel and it was amazing.  Lots of choices to choose from the starters, my favourite was home made scotch eggs. Main courses were great as well and lots to choose from. My daughter was not sure what to have and one of the chefs approached her and offered her pasta/spaghetti instead. She was very happy. Desserts were beautiful! We had to try every single one. My favourite was macaroons and my daughters favourite was cheesecake. The service was excellent and the staff were superb. We can not wait to go back there again! :-)",5,2015,08,07
150,Style with a view!,"The lobby of the hotel was nice with many staff available behind the main desk.  While the price of the room is high (expected in London), breakfast was included, which offered many options and with the best of service.   The Churchill gave us a very spacious room with a great view of Portman Park with little street noise and a window you could open.  The location is a bit out of the way for most London attractions, but walkable, if you like to hike (i.e. about a mile to Buckingham Palace).  Now, about our room.  It was specious, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  In the bathroom, however, was the strangest shower/tub arrangement I have ever seen.  With the shower head (non-moveable) on the left, a swinging glass door came from the left half way across the tub.  There was no shower certain, just this glass door (hence the fixed shower head).  Figuring out the temps and switches (also had a shower wand) was a challenge as well as getting in and out of the tub.  The rest of the bathroom was fine.  We were there for three nights.",5,2015,08,06
150,would have been 5 stars if no constuction,Stayed at the Churchill last week in July 2015. The staff was extremely accommodating and the concierge was excellent.  The only negative was the daily construction on the lower floors.  The noise made siestas impossible.  Breakfasts were bountiful and varied.,4,2015,08,05
150,Wonderful location with predictable Hyatt service and quality,"Stayed here on a business trip and appreciated the solid service, clean quality rooms and friendliness. 
The front desk staff was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. 
Even though it's a chain, there was a very nice English feel to the hotel which made me feel as if I were in another country- not the generic feel you get at many of the marriotts. ",4,2015,08,05
150,Great family vacation in London,I recently had the pleasure of staying 5 nights at the Churchill. The hotel is wonderful - service is 5-star and at the same time very welcoming and friendly.  I've seen other comments on the high quality of service at this hotel and echo those sentiments. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was great - especially the shower pressure!  We had the pleasure of having access to the Regency lounge which was a very nice benefit - service in the lounge was outstanding and the food and beverage offerings were excellent.  The location was very convenient for exploring London.  Would definitely stay here again on my next visit to London - it will be exciting to see the new renovations!,5,2015,08,03
150,Awesome place near the Marble Arch,"First the staff was friendly and helpful at all hours.  The room was nicely decorated, spacious and clean.  Although I only spent one night there I would stay at this hotel again. Being near the Marble Arch was awesome, because we were able to purchase our tickets to the hop on hop off bus right at the hotel and then walk to the Marble Arch stop to catch the bus.  One item that took me by surprise was the lack of a complete shower door in the bathroom, like I am use to in the United States. The last day of our stay the hotel held our luggage while we went out and did some last minute adventuring before departing. It was an awesome service to have available to us and eased our mind, because we didn't have to worry about what to do with our luggage.",5,2015,08,02
150,Excellent hotel near Marble Arch,"Nicely appointed, clean room on 9th (top) floor. Good size for London. Very friendly staff. Evenings had a piano player in the lounge. Short walk to Oxford St and Marble Arch tube. 7.50 pound cab to Paddington. Some construction/reno going on but confined to daytime hours and didn't bother us.  AC was strong.",5,2015,07,28
150,Great Place To Stay in London!,"Very Friendly Staff
Nice Clean & Spacious Rooms
Modern & Elegant Decor
Lounge on the 8th Floor is Really Nice
Doorman is Awesome
Highly Recommend this Place
They were having some issues with wi-fi while we were there but that didn't ruin our stay.
One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had!",5,2015,07,27
150,Hyde Park just around the corner.,"We spend five nights at HR London the Churchill with our 11-months-old boy. The hotel is inarguably located in an excellent place, at Portman Square, the hotel hide you from crowded Oxford Street but still you can reach Marble Arch within 5 minutes walk and then proceed to Hyde Park. It's a bit of pity that the renovation work currently undergoing at hotel is somewhat a bit annoying and only level 7 to 9 is open. Nevertheless it must be an excellent option for both family and business after renovation work complete.",4,2015,07,27
150,CHurchill Hyatt,Great hotel in a fabulous location. Do not let the worries of renovations keep you away. You do not notice anything at the hotel. The Regency Club has everything you need for a wonderful breakfast or an evening snack. The newly renovated rooms are comfortable with the latest amenities.  Stop in to the Churchill Bar for a super late night drink!,5,2015,07,27
150,Churchill London,"Best hotel staff you'll ever find.  No matter the need or department the Churchill staff is always ready to help you with a smile.  Would always recommend the Churchill for its location, its incredibly warm staff and comfortable accommodations.  A beautiful hotel just steps from Oxford St, Regent St, Bond St. and many London sites to see.",5,2015,07,26
150,Average,"Stayed here last year with kids had an adjoining rooms however not enough room to move even though we paid premium and didn't get what we get staying at Hyatt all over the world.
Recommended without children.
Staff were very helpful and fantastic however the rooms just are way behind the rest of the worlds hyatts.",3,2015,07,26
150,great location,"Luckily our two nights were sponsored but the best hotel we could have spent them at. Room was very nice and clean. Had a room on a lower level so the view wasn't much. Not much street noise so no problem for light sleepers. The staff was extremely helpful and nice with helping us get to the airport very early in the morning so we could catch our flight. 

The location is great-close to Hyde Park and a tube stop. Excellent shopping and food nearby to boot. Would definitely recommend this place!",5,2015,07,24
150,Luxury Hotel In the Perfect Location.,"I have stayed here every time I go to London. Hyde Park is just a 10 minute walk as well as the train. The rooms are small but the location and the service outweighs the smaller rooms.  I suggest that you ask if you can pay to have access to the concierge level.  It has a lounge that you can enjoy a light breakfast in the morning, with jams, coffee, breads, pastries and they have several servers making sure you have everything you need.  Also the club is great in the evening between 5pm - 7pm.  The have small selection of cocktails, its bourbon/whiskey, gin, white and red wines and lots of warm amuse bouche that are passed around.  Plus an assortment of other things that you can snack on.  I recommend this because it's nice to come back from exploring and sit and relax in the private lounge.  There are several cool bars and restaurants inside the hotel and one of them has a terrace.   They do not have a day spa but if you want a massage, they come to your room and do the treatment in your room.
The concierge on the first floor can get you great seats for shows for a small surcharge. The concierge snagged us tickets to The Book of Mormon and we were front and center.  They never disappoint me.",5,2015,07,18
150,Fantastic hotel ... the epitome of London class.,"We spent a single night at the Churchill after an investiture at Windsor Castle. Cannot begin to explain how good this hotel is. The room was superb, service was great, and everything oozes attention and class.  Breakfast was fabulous. Having originally thought we would go for cocktails at Trader Vics at the Hilton (chinned off due to an unnecessary cover charge), we instead opted for cocktails in the Churchill bar. Thank goodness we did.  The best cocktails I have had, beating the Burg in Dubai, Maliki in London and Raffles. The best bit was the bar staff; hugely knowledgable and passionate. Great selection of cigars. We would love to stay here again.",5,2015,07,18
150,"Beautiful Hotel-Great Service-Convenient to Shopping, Underground, City",The hotel is beautifully kept and the service from the hotel staff is tops. Location is across from very tranquil common garden and is only 2 blocks away from lots of shopping. The rates reflect their location and type of hotel. It's a fair value for what you're getting. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.,5,2015,07,18
150,Expensive....but wow what a nice stay!!!,"This hotel simply defines comfort and luxury. We were fortunate have had our two day stay sponsored, and very thankful for that, because on my own i would most likely have looked for cheaper accommodation. So having said that...it's difficult to fault anything at the Winston Churchill. Location if great if you like walking and catching buses, food was fantastic and the rooms clean, well looked after and super comfy.

Staff very helpful and professional...would definitely consider staying here again if our budget allows.",5,2015,07,13
150,First rate,I found this hotel live up to my expectations and go beyond what I expected.   My daughter had an emergency and I had already left the country.  The hotel staff went out of their way accompanying her to the hospital and ensuring she was safe.  It made all the difference.  Exceptional customer service,5,2015,07,12
150,"Great Hotel, Great Stay","We stayed here for four nights in July and really enjoyed our stay.  We booked a Regency Club twin room, which was quite spacious and had a lovely view over Portman Square and had all the amenities and extras you would expect when paying extra for a room of this calibre.  It was lovely to enjoy the extra facilities you pay for as part of booking a Regency Club room and we thoroughly enjoyed breakfast in the Club lounge as well as some afternoon/evening visits.  The staff who man this part of the hotel are all lovely, helpful and friendly - with I'm sad to say the exception of one older gentleman (not sure if he is senior or not), who we frankly found to be brusque, quite rude and not a little condescending on the two nights he was 'in charge'.  This was a pity as the other staff are delightful and frankly, his attitude towards us was the only negative of our stay.  Despite having access to all the facilities of the Regency Club we visited all areas of the hotel including the dining room, bar and Churchill Terrace - all are fabulous with lovely staff.  The Terrace was decked out for Wimbledon - lovely for us as a trip to centre court was one of this trip's highlights and we enjoyed lovely drinks and snacks in this area.  We will certainly return to the Churchill and would recommend the whole hotel and the Regency Club to anyone thinking of staying here.  Looking forward to our next trip!",5,2015,07,10
150,"Very expensive for what it is, but very nice too","We spent some time here whilst planning for a meeting nearby.

As expected, everything is very over priced and over rated as you would expect from a chain with this name.

Service charge is apparently voluntary but they kicked up a proper fuss when we offered £20 to cover a £19 bill rather than change another £20.  Greedy in my opinion.",4,2015,07,09
150,Fantastic Hotel!,"I stayed here for 6 nights while I was in London and this hotel is fantastic.  The location is great as its 2 blocks away from Oxford street and close to the tour bus stops.  

The rooms was pretty spacious, clean and modern. The hotel is also going under renovation so they advised me that noise would occur certain times.  They also said the gym was out but they had some agreement with a health club down the street and could make arrangements if I wanted to go.  

The staff is very nice and friendly, from the front desk, the concierge, cleaning people and the staff at the club lounge.   The food at the lounge was good.  A special thanks go the Arielia (hope I spelled her name correct, she checked me in at the front desk) and  who gave me great tips about where to visit and when.",5,2015,07,09
150,Terrific Hotel,"Visited London June 2015. Stayed at The Churchill for 4 days. Terrific Hotel, great staff, and wonderful restaurant. Great breakfast in the morning with eggs anyway you want, pancakes, fruit, etc. Ate dinner one night and it was very good.There also a very nice bar downstairs. If you need anything (like ice or a hair dryer) just call downstairs and they bring it up. Good location also near Marble Arch. Walking distance to Selfridges department store and other Oxford street shopping and dining. Short cab ride to Harrod's about 12 Pounds. Only downsides: wifi week in room, and no outlet in bathroom for hair dryer.",5,2015,07,07
150,good located property but imposed the most bizarre rules I have every encountered,"Location, room and service all satisfactory for hotel of this quality.

However two problems encountered during my one night stay. 

Hotel is undergoing significant renovation which was not highlighted on reservation. Impossible to rest in the room before 6 PM when work ceased. I have no problem with a hotel doing renovation as every business need to keep fresh, but it should have been adequately notified before accepting reservation.

The bar at the hotel imposes a ban on use of lap top computers because ""it upsets"" other guests. I have never encountered such an arbitrary or bizarre rule in all my 40 years of travel. I was however informed that it would be OK to use an iPad, which is actually  the same size as the apple air computer I was going to use. Once again the bar was not signed that ""computer using guests"" were not welcome. 

That incredible rule by itself would not have been an issue if the hotel had another bar available for 'computer using guests"". However, it did not, so  I would question where a registered guest who wants to check e-mail and have a drink would need to go. The pub across the street? 

Would be interested to hear from others who have also encountered bizarre and inexplicable hotel rules on their travels.",2,2015,07,06
150,Elegant hotel.,Stayed 4 nights and found it very comfortable.  The room was quiet and the staff more than willing to accommodate your wishes. Comfortable bed and elegant linens. Our room was very clean and my only complaint was that there was only one luggage rack. We had just arrived from the US and were so tired we did not even ask for one and once settled in we were Ok without it.,4,2015,07,05
150,Stayed there with a tour group,"Although this was not the original hotel for our tour, it was a good substitute. Easy for taxi drivers to find. Nice location in a not too busy neighborhood. Nice pub (The Grazing Goat?) around the corner. Breakfast buffet was good. Service for quick meals was good. Dinner was good. No complaints.",5,2015,07,04
150,"Elegant, Comfortable and Convenient","The Hyatt Regency Churchill is elegant with comfortable quiet rooms, soft beds, beautiful linen and a very nice staff.  I was on my own after a trip with my best friend, and simply wanted a couple of days to wander around London at my own pace.  The location is convenient to shopping and the Tube.  The staff made me feel welcome which isn't always the case for a woman on her own.  They arranged transportation for me, gave me directions and made recommendations.",5,2015,07,03
150,Visiting London,"Great hotel, great location for shopping, restaurants & business district.  Close walk to metro.  Rooms were spacious, very clean and fresh. Hotel staff friendly and accommodating. We would recommend this hotel & stay there again if the occasion presents itself.",5,2015,07,03
150,Very Centralized Hotel in the Heart of London,"Stayed for 2 nights and the room was great for 2-3 people.  The staff added a roll-away bed if you requested.  Half an hour walk to Buckingham Palace and other 10 minutes to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and others.  Right between 2 major parks of London (Hyde Park and Green Park) which you can jog with beautiful trails and scenery.  On day one the renovation crew cut the wi-fi cable so it was down for hours, but they front desk kept us informed of the repair status and even offered to send important files/emails for us from their system.  The Assistant Guest Service Manager Vinzenz Maedel even sent us a gift tray of snacks.  Now that's customer service at its best... Small token but keeps customer happy instead of complaining about no wi-fi.  Love to stay here again next time we return to London.",5,2015,07,02
150,Extra special,"Booked as a weekend theater treat for my Daughters 18th , they even left a homemade Birthday cake in the room which was divine. The staff are amazing and very professional , I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in London and want something with a touch of class.",5,2015,07,02
150,Great hotel and wonderful staff,"we stayed at the hotel twice in June, both times we had an absolute seemless and wonderful experience. The first stay we had just arrived very early from an overnight flight from Asia and we fully expected our room to not be ready, which is wasn't, but the lovely lady at check in worked her magic and upgraded us and got us a room immediately - a beautiful executive suite. The hotel driver also deserves a mention, he was charming and very pleasant even though he had to wait for over an hour for us to arrive through immigration. The second stay again was wonderful, the staff amazing and our room was perfect. The club lounge was lovely, great breakfast and fantastic wait staff who remembered us from our previous visit....even though the hotel was under going renovations we didn't hear or see anything! five stars all the way!",5,2015,07,01
150,"Great hotel, but will be better after renovations are complete","This was my second stay at this property and I still really enjoy it.  The location is a great, central location for sightseeing in London and there are more dining and shopping options around the hotel than anyone could possibly want.

Though we didn't dine at the hotel on this stay, we did enjoy breakfast and snacks in the Regency Club lounge.  The food was excellent and of good variety.  The staff was extremely attentive and I cannot say enough about them.  (5 star service, for sure!)

Unfortunately, the hotel is currently undergoing significant renovations that do have some impacts.  We opted to only stay 3 of our 6 nights and check-out early because of the significant noise from the renovation.  The reverberations from the jackhammers can be heard throughout the hotel during the day and strange beeps and popping sounds come through on the speaker in the room.  The times are isolated to the work day, but if you enjoy an evening out and want to sleep in, your rest is cut short.  Sadly, for us it was a bit too much.  We do hope to return sometime after the renovations and stay again.",4,2015,06,29
150,All Around Great,"This is a lovely hotel in an excellent location. Very near the Marble Arch, Hyde Park and several tube stations and shopping, but in an amazingly quiet area across from a green space.  We had 2 rooms for 3 nights in early June and the hotel is still undergoing renovations, as we had been warned by both Hyatt and reviews. We only heard the construction during our brief stopovers in the afternoon and hammering around 7:30 on the morning we were leaving. We were up already, so no bother, but I could see how this would have been a problem if you were trying to sleep in on vacation. 

As noted by several reviewers, the staff was top notch, from check in to check out. Every request or question was met with a friendly smile. The concierge, William, was particularly helpful and fun. We appreciated our Hyatt status being acknowledged and the complimentary upgrade to the Lounge floor. Sadly, at the end of the week we stayed at St. Ermin’s, an Autograph/Marriott property and were not given such considerations.

We did enjoy access to the concierge lounge during our stay.  Many of these are not worth the extra money, should you be charged, but this one particularly nice. Breakfast included a hot egg dish in addition to the usual continental offerings. Evening snacks were attractively presented and delicious. The lounge staff was amazingly attentive and brought around trays of appetizers during the evening social hour. The selection of wine and liquor was nice.  The lounge was always very clean and inviting.

The rooms were spacious for London and had comfortable beds. The bathroom had plenty of counter space with 1 sink. The shower had 2 options, for a rainfall or a handheld, which is nice and the water pressure and temperature were both good.  The staff split the king into 2 twins for our 18 yr old boys. We did not have a view, but who needs one when visiting such an incredible city. Other than some construction noise mentioned above, our rooms were very quiet. Housekeeping did an excellent job and our room was always clean and fresh.

We enjoyed dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant and it was very nice.

Nearby shopping included Selfridges' and many high end shops on Oxford and Bond. We easily walked back to the hotel from Charring Cross tube station on a beautiful afternoon and took in the shops. We also walked to Harrod's and back through Hyde Park. 

I would definitely stay here again",5,2015,06,28
150,Wonderful,"Had an amazing night. The food was more than 1st class, the staff were friendly. All in all a very pleasant experience and would love to return. The decor is beautiful and the cocktails were amazing.  Especially enjoyed the food from starter to main. ",5,2015,06,24
150,Major renovation currently,"This is my favourite hotel to stay in london. The hotel seems to be going though a major renovation so it is noisy during the day. Even currently it is a beautiful property , great entrance, lobby area and nice bar and breakfast room. Rooms are very nice, old but very nice. I was disappointed by the service this time as the turn down was not done even after two requests which i informed the management before i left. Hyatt pls maintain your standards.",4,2015,06,19
150,Excellent,"Excellent, Hotel,  Loved the stay, Close to Great Restauranteurs, Loved Rubens (Glad Jewish Deli) Loved   being 2 blocks from Oxford Street, Loved  being Close to Marble Arch Tube Stop, Loved the Breakfast--AWESOME service love it, did i say I loved it? loved it.",5,2015,06,18
150,Great Hotel and Location,"The staff was very helpful and allowed me to park my rental car for a long while when I checked in so that I could then take the car back to the airport to drop off. Great and friendly staff, beautiful hotel, very nice staff on regency floor and food was great at the regency club!",5,2015,06,16
150,Great location,I have stayed here a few times when I come through for work and thoroughly recommend it. The building is excellent as are the facilities and rooms. The staff make it though – great local knowledge and very helpful. Make sure you use the park across the road – hotel guests get a key!,4,2015,06,16
150,A perfect stay,I would highly recommend The Hyatt - Churchill to anyone.  The hotel was beautiful the staff were lovely and the food was out of this world.  The location of the hotel makes it easy to get around London easily by public transport or by foot.,5,2015,06,14
150,Very nicely updated,"Recent renovation made a good hotel even better.  Very secure.  Nice entry and lobby. Piano music is excellent.  Regency Club is very well done. Solid location.  Nice surprise just off Park Lane, just 2 blocks North of Mayfair.",5,2015,06,14
150,Amazing staff,Daniel at the front desk was incredible and the man from Ghana on the exec club floor was superb! There were some works going on at the hotel but it was only during work hours. I simply felt everyone at the hotel was so kind and caring. Breakfast was spectacular and the entire experience was warm.,5,2015,06,13
150,An American in London,"First, I am a Diamond level at Hyatt and one other Hotel chain, so I stay at alot of properties.   Hyatt in particular i have come to expect a very high level of quality and service.   I recently stayed here for 7 nights on points.   Everything I am about to point out was consistently delivered every day.   I dont think I have experienced that at any property i have been at over the years.

Location, I was not sure how this would be when we booked, but I found it to be excellent.   A few blocks from Hyde Park and Oxford Street in a very nice part of London.  The Marble Arch Tube station is a couple blocks and then most places you would want to go in town are only a few stops away.  Within say a half mile radius, it is amazing how many different dining options there are.   As fast paced as London can be at times, the hotel was always very calm... a nice oasis.

The staff was absolutely outstanding. Always friendly, always available, always willing to help and make suggestions.   Compared to most hotels, it seemed like they had a lot more staff than most.  Concierges were all very helpful, as was the staff at the Executive level lounge.  I felt like they were trying to anticipate my needs and help.  I dont normally feel that way in US. 

Our room on the 8th floor was not all that large (as is typical in Europe), but was plenty big for us.  As a business traveler, one of the keys for me is outlets.  I was very surprised to see a US outlet in addition to a European one besides the UK one.  We had adaptors, but this was great.  Wireless internet worked flawlessly.  I am usually entertained by bathrooms in Europe and the shower was not an exception, but we figured it out in a day....  : )  The Room was very quiet and comfortable.

We dined one evening at the Montague.   Great service, great food.  Likewise we went to the Churchill Bar, very nice and a good experience.

Yes, there is construction going on, but we were well warned.   It did not diminish our experience at all.

Note, London is expensive... period, so get ready.  But i found the Churchill to be very worth it.    We noted that it seemed like a lot of repeat customers...again a very good sign.  

Bottom line, on a scale of 1 to 10 this is an 11.   I hope to come back after the remodeling is done.   

Very Well Done!",5,2015,06,09
150,Elegant Hotel with great Concierge,"I traveled to London with my husband who was on a business trip. I had quite a bit of alone time. The concierge, Augosto, helped me fill my solo time with excellent suggestions for walks, tours and shopping. He suggested places to dine after in depth questions about our likes and interests- did we want more of a local neighborhood place or a tourist destination- spicy, ethnic, regional etc.
The hotel is quite lovely. We had wonderful breakfasts there and one ""Shakespeare themed dinner"" with actors work in the room while we dined. It was a terrific experience.",5,2015,06,05
150,Might be a four or five but for the construction noise.,"Afternoon pounding and drilling from remodeling was a big problem esp. when it arrived next door despite hotel's promise that work would distant from occupied rooms.
Also, check the bill carefully,  Several errors on ours (duplication of meal charges).",3,2015,06,03
150,Exemplary Customer Service,"We checked in early and though our room was not available we were directed to a free breakfast.  The staff throughout our stay were wonderful and always ready to give us directions, advice, etc.  A great memory for my book.",5,2015,06,03
150,Never going back,"I went last year in August for a present for my fiancé for her birthday. There was noises at all times of the day, from children and adults shouting. 

I also found the staff in the shisha cafe arrogant and annoyed me with his sarcastic comments. I later sent the manager an email about my stay and got a snotty return so will never go back even when they offered me a free stay.",2,2015,06,02
150,A lovely hotel stay,"Even as part of a tour group the experience was 5star all the way and we were treated like valued guests in every way.  The location is convenient, the restaurant delightful, and the staff completely devoted to making the experience a good one.  We would certainly enjoy a return visit in the future.",5,2015,05,31
150,Construction Noise Made This Stay Almost Intolerable,"This hotel is well located for transportation and shopping--near Selfridges, Oxford St.  Pleasant neighborhood.  The dining and bar areas had excellent service and food.  The housekeeping was caring.  However--the constant drilling and hammering noises throughout the day were unbearable. I would not stay here as long as the construction is underway.",2,2015,05,26
150,Lovely! Lovely! Lovely!,"What an excellent experience! Our first big trip abroad and the accommodations were awesome. We are thrifty Hyatt points people, not frequent business travelers. We were kindly upgraded by an angel at the front desk and the portals opened as we saw how the other half travels! Lovely rooms, comfy bedding, pampering toiletries, and a staff that could not do enough to make our stay memorable. The neighborhood is very walkable, a few little cafes nearby and all of the shopping on Oxford Street within a few minutes.
We navigated the buses with little difficulty- bus stop is nearby. We love to walk and Buckingham Palace, and Hyde park are easy distances.",5,2015,05,23
150,Convenient and comfortable,"Hotel is located within working distance to oxford st and regent st and the rooms are comfortable and big.  We enjoyed our 3 night stay in the hotel and by end of the stay feel a bit more connected to the staff at the concierge and restaurant and casual sitting areas,  would stay again.",4,2015,05,23
150,Constructon a drag,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Apparently there was a gas explosion some time back and the hotel is undergoing a lot of renovation. The noise we experienced on a Monday morning was terrible.(May, 2015) Otherwise the staffv was great, excellent service and a nice room.",3,2015,05,20
150,Good hotel with great people.,"We found the standard rooms to be small and not very comfortable.  The service was great, and the people really made our stay.  
The staff was friendly and engaging, especially our server at afternoon tea.  
The Churchill Bar was fantastic.  The ambiance, service, and the food and drinks were impressive.
The rooms and building I could take or leave, but I would definitely stay here again because of the staff.",4,2015,05,18
150,Lovely Stay,"A truly lovely hotel, The Churchill is in a great location close to sights and activities within easy walking distance as well as shopping, and the neighborhood is relatively quiet and very pretty.  During my week-long stay, every staff member I interacted with was attentive, friendly, and helpful.  I found the basic room to be most comfortable not only in features but also in size.  Everything there seems to run like a well-oiled machine behind the scenes.  I look forward to my next stay there!",5,2015,05,16
150,Nice place in London,"Great hotel, staff friendly and helpful, restaurant well worth eating in. Close to good shopping in Oxford Street.Taxi's right outside the door, Paddington station only 10 minutes away as we traveled up by train from Devon",5,2015,05,15
150,Just keeps getting better!,"This is our third time staying at this hotel and it never fails to impress. Centrally located and lovingly salubrious! The rooms are excellent, food is delicious and the service is impeccable. We love sitting out on the terrace at the Churchill bar for a cocktail or three before dinner and sometimes after too!! If you are a discerning traveler or business person then this is where you should stay.",5,2015,05,15
150,Excellent stay,"we enjoyed a beautiful weekend with the best service at the Hyatt churchill. The regency lounge is a must if you stay here, breakfast and staff goes out of their way to make sure your stay is comfortable. The rooms are overlooking the park and have a very comfortable and relaxing feel",5,2015,05,10
150,Excellent Hotel in Amazing Location,"This is an American hotel that has a good British vibe. Located on beautiful Portman Square, it's surrounded by a quiet and refined neighborhood that borders Kensington and Belgravia, Marylebone and Marble Arch.  

Upon arriving, you are greeted by a phalanx of doorman and bellhops.  The registration to the right of the entrance is well-staffed and attentive.   Once you register, you can go to the access keyed elevator (this place feels very secure) or you can continue to the lobby bar, which has piano in the evening.  While i did not get a chance to enjoy the ambiance, I will on my next stay.

I have only stayed in one room, a small suite on the 9th floor, but it was very nicely done.  The view overlooking Portman Square was tranquil and I had a small semi-private balcony that accommodated 2 chairs and a table.  

The suite itself had a living room with couch and chairs, a wet bar, an ergonomically-friendly desk and big tv and some nice lamps.  Also, a nespresso machine and some candy.

The bedroom had another tv and a bathroom equipped with a bath and shower.  Very nice.

The Regency Club on the 8th floor is a nice facility that exceeds the usual Hyatt lounge standard.  Smallish, it is a nice place for a breakfast.

I had dinner nearby in Belgravia, but I understand that Locanda is quite nice.

If you are looking for a refined hotel experience in London's West End, this is a good place to look,  Expect to pay commensurate with the quality.",5,2015,05,09
150,Lovely Hotel-Great Location!,"We had a three day stop in London, England before heading to Ireland and onto France. The Churchill was the perfect location as we were within walking distance to Oxford Street for shopping, Queen's Garden Regent's Park and the tour bus lines. The rooms were spacious. Being Diamond status we were on the ninth floor with access to the Regency Club lounge with room key. We had full English breakfasts for four, afternoon tea/coffee and evening appetizers included.  The Concierge was extremely helpful answering our questions about London city tours etc. The only downside to this property were the doormen at the entrance. The first two days they didn't even acknowledge our presence or attempt to open a door for us as we entered the hotel. Rude. The last day the two doormen (different from the two days prior) working were perfect gentlemen and jumped to open doors, help us with our luggage and hail the taxi to the airport. Overall we truly enjoyed all this property had to offer and were sad to leave!",4,2015,05,05
150,The CHURCHIL,"London is a nice city to visit all year round for its shopping, different atraction and reasonably nice weather and when there weather on buziness of a get away I prefere the Churchill hotel for its good location and the luxuary of the hotel.",4,2015,05,04
150,"Great location, best concierge service ever!","We, a family of three, stayed here beginning of September 2013. We booked a room on one of the executive floors. The location next to Portman Square, 150 m from Marble Arch/Oxford Street is perfect for shopping! The rooms are tiny, but immaculate. Contemporary chick, clean and tidy. Executive floor lounge great, included meals and drinks most time of the day. Executive floor service was ok, but not great. Concierge in the lobby however, was fantastic. They got us whatever we wanted of restaurant reservations, attraction tickets - effective, friendly and attentive. I believe, the best concierge service I have ever encountered actually! However, the hotel is expensive and I am not sure I wether will stay there again.",4,2015,05,02
150,Very Good Hotel,"The room was very nice and beautiful. Room service was very good. The executive lounge was more than perfect. Food was so delicious and wonderful varieties. The restaurant was amazing and I loved the atmosphere, food, piano, very friendly staff, and Wonderful hospitality.",5,2015,05,01
150,very efficient one day business stay,"I did not spend a lot of time inside the hotel but the location was good, lobby was like an oasis and the checkin very efficient. Also surprised that I was upgraded without asking and the room was spacious and nicely sound proofed. It is very rare that I don't find a single issue to complain about but this was the one of the exceptions. If only all my hotel experiences were like this, I would get so much more done on business travel.",5,2015,04,28
150,"First impressions will last, disappointingly","After a long 5 hour drive arriving at a prestigious Hotel that I booked to relax in with my wife and infant daughter, one can't wait to enjoy the 5* welcome expected at a Hyatt in London....... Well....it did look promising as we pulled up to the front door, as the doorman politely opened the door for my wife. 
Unfortunately that was the end of our excitement as we struggled with heavy bags, pram, car seat etc etc. He did manage to take an average bag from the front seat and proceeded to put the bags against the outside wall.  With my wife fully loaded with bags, I was just about to ask him to valet park the car but he proceeded to tell me that the car parking was closed/no space and that I would have to park the car.... SOMEWHERE .... maybe in the car park across the road..... a bit bemused I asked about cost but he did not know.... As I drove away I saw my wife struggling with the pram and bags through the door with no assistance........ I got to the car park where I was hit with a £8/hr bill, I was leaving the next day !!!!!!! so you can imagine my heart dropping with the thought of 18 hours parked there!
I rushed back to the hotel only to find that the bigger bags were still outside, three door man chatting out side. I struggled through the door with the three as an audience when one decided to ask if I needed assistance, I declined out of shear frustration as I was already through the door....... I am not someone that expects help or even asks, but .. THE HYATT Regency LONDON, would you not expect 5* treatment/ common courtesy, Come on !!!! 
This set the mood and my wife was still sitting in the reception area with our daughter with no approach to assist... So we checked in, I mentioned that there was nothing on the web site stating no parking but the only response was that parking would only have been £10 less if we parked in the Hyatt ( not my point at all).... I was not in any mood to argue now and asked to check in, they eventually acknowledged our Diamond status and asked, as we have an infant, would we like a Crib.... I stated that was already requested, and she tried to cover by saying oh yes I know, I was just double checking ( you guessed it no crib in the room when we eventually entered) as we where checking in, a loud concierge shouted over to the receptionist, interrupting our conversation as he loudly mentioned to the girl, "" hey, you got a compliment from a guest"" ( I was beginning to understand why he said it in a surprised voice)........ At least after check in, concierge did actually now ask if they could take the  bags to the room. 
As I said the crib was not there and the room, well,  nothing special, very small but overall adequate. So we proceeded to the Regency Club to relax..... Internet gave us issues and it took a while to resolve..... I was quite shocked when one staff member asked had I spelled my name right !!! They where actually serious!!!!
So as the night went on we had a relax and a chat and thank goodness a ray of light when we met and was looked after by the amazing ""Chu"" in the Regency Club. He was excellent, friendly, helpful and made that hour a pleasant stay..... If it was not for Chu, we would have given a 1 out of 5..... Well done Chu, I hope the Hyatt Churchill follow his lead, otherwise they don't deserve him! We understand that the hotel is only just back on its feet after the explosion and limited rooms but that's NO excuse for what we experienced.....That was going to be how this review finished .... until I noticed........... The portrait on the wall at reception of ""her Majesty the queen"".............. With her eyes closed...................Seriously....... Is that right, is that respectful !!!!!.

So at this point in time I was glad to drive away and state- NEVER again, ! unless they change!",2,2015,04,28
150,Spacious and quiet!,"Loved this hotel.  HUGE room for European standards and the staff were all so helpful and amazing.  Once you enter the lobby, you will be greeted by the professional staff and the stunning main lobby.  The size of the room itself is worth the money.  We've stayed at a different hotel in London for one night and it could not compare to this one! I would definitely come back here again.",5,2015,04,26
150,Quirky and graceful approach to history and such service,"The private garden, to which the concierge will admit hotel guest by key, is alone worth the stay.  But then, so is the Churchill Martini [made as Winston instructed by opening the vermouth bottle nearby the making] using the hotel's proprietary 'Sacred Gin' with its incredible herbal notes. However, even if those grace notes were not present [and thank goodness they are], the welcome of the Churchill staff makes the Portman Square landmark a place worth staying.  
Rooms are well appointed and spacious enough.  Internet is usually good, although I happened to experience a provider connection glitch this last stay.  Flatscreen TV is lovely for the time after one is exhausted from exploring the terrific central location on foot [or by nearby tube and bus stations].  Near the Marble Arch and Speakers' Corner.  45 minute walk [ok, so I am slow!] from National Gallery and other Trafalgar Square attractions such as St Martin-in-the-fields noontime music, 1/2 price ticket booth for shows, the best people watching....
It is lovely.  Stay there and feel like you have a new extra family taking care of you.",4,2015,04,26
150,What a service! What an experience!,"As a hospitality professional I tend to be very picky and often disappointed with services provided by restaurants and hotels I visit. When I got invited for a brunch at The Montagu Restaurant at Churchill’s I had no expectations at all, as I've never been in this particular hotel before. I was more looking forward to meet our friends rather than experiencing a new place, but was it a treat...

We arrived at 12:30, table was prepared and our waiter was introduced. We were offered water and drinks almost instantly. Delicious bread was placed on the table and Bloody Merry drinks were flying in shortly after. We had an amazing glass of champagne in a meantime as well. There were 3 Italian buffets available: with antipasti, mains and deserts. Every single dish was extraordinary. My personal favourite was pasta and beautifully done steak. Deserts were exquisite! Having a sweet tooth I couldn't help trying most of them. Food is one thing though, a service another. Edina and Steve were absolute starts of our afternoon. So professional, so knowledgeable and attentive. They simply couldn't do enough for us. True starts and gems of your restaurant I must admit. Chefs, so professional, so kind and helpful. It was a pleasure to dine surrounded by such fantastic group of people with the most honest smile and dedication you could ask for.

Straight after we decided to continue our adventure in the bar with an outside space, where completely separated from the street we felt transferred into a different world. Nicky and Dimitri, again, what a fantastic people you are. We were amazed by your knowledge and level of service. We didn't wait too long for any of the drinks and your suggestions were always interesting, even if not 100% spot on our usual preference. What an evening!

We planned to have a lovely quick brunch, we ended spending almost 10 hours at the Churchill's. The atmosphere around this amazingly historic place is simply majestic. Hotel is full of references to Churchill's legacy and every single person working there is very proud of being a part of it. In summary, a fantastic and unforgettable experience and we will definitely come back to visit Mr Churchill.

150,Great hotel with great service,"Classic hotel with all commodities and services. Especialized in services to muslim guests although all kind of travellers will feel better than in home.
Great breakfast service.
All details are very well prepared.
Free wifi",4,2015,04,22
150,Perfect location and professional service,I strongly suggest the Churchill in London. It's like my home place: I feel comfortable with my family and friends. The locanda Locatelli Restaurant nearby is also giving the chance of an excellent choice of Italian plates and excellent wines.,5,2015,04,21
150,highly recommend.,"brilliant location, helpful,friendly and professional staff, room was big and airy, bed extremely comfy, food and service excellent. would highly recommend, and would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,04,20
150,As good as last year,"Returned for a trip this year and was concerned as it was closed after the gas explosion and opened 1 week before our visit.  Only the top 3 floors were open but experience was as good as last year.  Excellent service from the concierge on the club floor.  Had one small issue but Antonia, the on -duty manager sought us out, apologized and bought us a drink at the bar.  Plan to return next year.  My only complaint is the sold the big picture of the queen in the lobby and replaced it with a smaller one.",5,2015,04,10
150,The Best,The Churchill is on a nice square just off Oxford street. The hotel is one of the nicest place to stay in the west end. It has a fantastic lounge area with a good menu. The bar is a great place for a drink or two on an evening. The rooms in the hotel are of a very high standard and always spotlessly clean. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I have stayed here many times and its my personal favourite London hotel.,5,2015,04,03
150,Great to be again at the Churchill,"We stayed at the Churchill last November 21st when at midnight while already sleeping a the hotel suffered from gas explosion at the basement and the hotel was totally evacuated. Even during this critical event all the hotel staff were extremely helpful to support the guests, get us a substitute hotel and take care of all our needs. As we travel regularly to London, indeed we missed the Churchill, which became during the last 15 years our ""home"" in London. We continued to be in touch with our contact at the hotel, Ms. Fernanda and when we came to London in February she arranged for us substitute hotel. But we still missed the Churchill. Two weeks ago the hotel was reopened, I believe at this point only three floors are open because the owners and management took advantage of the situation to re-do many of the hotel rooms. Last week we returned to the Churchill. We were delighted to get the excellent service at the Regency Club and to enjoy again he unique experience of combination of high standard with warmth and friendliness at the best location in London. We await completion of the rest of the hotel and specifically we look forward to the reopening of the gym. Thank you to all the dedicated staff and management.",5,2015,04,02
150,Hotel reopens,For all of you with upcoming reservations at this hotel (I am one of them) we have good news today.  They'd have announced that they'd will reopen next Monday and they are renovating all the rooms.  All reservations previously made are still good and you can now make new reservations  on the Hyatt web site.,5,2015,03,11
150,"Great location, pretty hotel, but not worth the money","We stayed two nights at the Hyatt Regency on a credit card promotion. For two nights the hotel was $1,500! The location is fabulous, the lobby is to die for, but the rooms are pretty ordinary and small. For $750 per night I cannot say that this hotel is worth it, I'm just glad that we weren't paying for it! The bottom line is that you're paying for the location and the brand.",4,2015,03,11
150,Close to my favourite London Museum - The Wallace Collection.,"Arrived at Heathrow at about 7 am, bus into town, and arrived at The Churchill at about 9 am. It took a lot of 'hard' talking to obtain an early 'check-in' but eventually I won the day.  It taught me a lesson that in future to catch a 'plane that arrives in Europe after lunch, then one does not have the problem of trying for an early check-in - all you do is lose a day.  However, virtually every time I fly out of Europe ( and I have been doing it for about 25 years)  I find myself checking out of hotels at about 7 am, and any taxi driver will tell you that between 5- 9 am is their peak period taking passengers to airports or to train stations to airports. One way, of course is to book the day before, so your room is waiting for you - so you work out using the room for 2 hours and paying for a day.  Maybe some hotels should try adjusting their hours to suit the early arrival traveler. 18 hours sitting in a seat on a 'plane trying to go to sleep is really not fun.
My 2 stays at this Regency have been fine. No problems. And as most of the Tripadvisors state the staff could not be more helpful - especially the Front Desk lady who let me in early. Thanks.
Brian, from Perth.  Western Australia.",5,2015,02,15
150,A happy return,"We have used the Churchill a number of times and, after a gap of over a year, we enjoyed the return
We chose a room on the Club floor which, at extra cost, offers separate check in/out and a quiet, staffed lounge which offers breakfast and early evening drinks and canapes (included in the Club price). The extra cost of Club is offset by not having to pay (or queue) downstairs for the rather expensive Churchill breakfast and the quiet of the lounge in the evening can be pleasant.
The Churchill is excellently positioned for Oxford and Regent Streets' shopping and usually has a couple of cabs on its own rank for longer journeys plus Bond St. or Marble Arch Tube stations are a 5 minute walk.
The Churchill should prove a comfortable base to explore London.
For a quieter room I would avoid those overlooking Portman Square where the traffic is busy.",4,2015,01,30
150,The Staff is absolutely fantastic,"Excellent in every aspect of whatever came in front of me, be it the greetings from the front desk to the quality and eye catching food that hits your table, i stayed in one of the suites which was absolutely fantastic. keep up the good work. was a pleasure meeting the GM i think it was Michael if im not wrong. Thank you so much guys, my holiday with my family was great.",5,2015,01,20
150,Excellent all round,All round brilliant and great value for money especially for a romantic weekend away.  Good positioning for exploring beautiful London and its fantastic shops.  Service was great all round so I would highly recommend,5,2015,01,10
150,Great location but questionable value for money,"Great location off Oxford St, so perfect for doing shopping. The hotel is in keeping with Hyatt standards, and is very similar to their other Regency hotels. We stayed using our Hyatt reward points so it was basically free - otherwise, the rate was very expensive and I doubt we would have stayed here as it would have been value for money. The restaurant was expensive, we only had a snack there (and high tea) you are better off going elsewhere for a main dinner meal.",4,2015,01,08
150,My Number One Choice in London,"Love the Churchill. It has an excellent location on Portman Square. Ideal for both business and leisure travellers as it is close to Oxford Street, Marble Arch and Hyde Park. I was indeed very sad to hear about the gas explosion in the kitchen at the Hyatt this November. I would like to thank Judy Bonizzi for booking me at the Landmark Hotel. Although, the LandMark is a good hotel, the Hyatt Churchill will always be my Number Choice. I also stayed at the Grosvenor House and there is absolutely no comparison in my mind between the Churchill and the Grosvenor House. Hyatt Churchill is the best. They also have excellent staff, friendly, courteous, warm and welcoming. Right from the doorman to the Receptionist, the Concierge as well as the Restaurant Staff and the friendly staff on the Club Floor. I do hope the Hotel re opens very soon. On my last visit to London in early December, I really missed being at the Hyatt Churchill. Top Notch Hotel.",5,2014,12,22
150,Excellent staff,"We were supposed to be staying at the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill for our honeymoon three weeks ago.  Unfortunately we were forced to be relocated to a different hotel due to a gas explosion incident one day before our arrival.
My review is mainly for the staff working at the hotel.  It's understandable that the aftermath of the accident would cause a lot of chaos and confusion for the staff  but I have to say they did an excellent job in making this otherwise disastrous situation a whole lot better.  One staff member, I believe his name is Nicholas, drove us to another hotel to get our luggage and insisted on carrying all four of our luggage (two small and two big ones)  and made sure we got to Hilton hotel (the relocation) safely.  At the end I tried to show him my gratitude by offering him a good amount of tips, but he politely declined.  ""Thank you, but I work for Hyatt""  are the exact words he said.  Wow, this would have never happened in the States.  It would have been totally fine if he accepted it, but the fact that he insisted on helping me without any extra compensation speaks highly of the brand he represents.  It's nice to know that someone actually takes pride in doing his/her job in today's society.",5,2014,12,19
150,Not 5 Star Hotel !,"The lobby was small but very busy. I expected a nice lobby to sit and relax but there were few chairs.
The rooms were expensive, small and even without breakfast. 
I was suppose to stay there for 7 nights but I checked out after 2.
The staff is friendly but there were few girls in the lobby up to no good. I did not like the atmosphere, not suited for a family.  ",3,2014,12,09
150,Superb,"Lovely stay at the Churchill.
Great, friendly, committed and professional staff (reception, concierge, club level, house keeping, bell captain).
Lovely club rooms with nice amenties for families and business travellers.
Clean, quiet rooms.
Simply loved it and will return!",5,2014,12,07
150,Amazing,"This review is mainly for the way hyatt dealt with my booking
The hotel closed due to a gas explosion
Hyatt could not have done any more for us
They paid the difference between the rate I agreed  for my stay in the Churchill and my hotel chosen in london which was more expensive
Well done hyatt they are a great brand",5,2014,12,06
150,London is Calling :),"Best stay here at the Churchill...and so convenient to all things ""London"" :) Very ""HIP"" lobby complete with free cappacinos, cookies, soft drinks and pastries...loved everything about this ""Hyatt Andaz"" aka Churchill",5,2014,12,03
150,"Perfect location, great service but poor wifi","Stayed at this hotel several times. The location, facilities and staff was great as usual. Regency club nicely organised and comfortable rooms. Only draw back was the wifi that was terrible during my stay. ",4,2014,12,03
150,Expensive but in a great part of town,"I stayed here with the family for a treat and although from the UK found myself the loosing out on customer service as nearly all people were clearly millionaires. 
The hotel seemed to be ok letting other families kids ride around the lobby causing mayhem on their scorers. No one dare correct the stuck up family. 
Staff were very helpful but very stiff in there approach and service. 
Rooms aren't big and recommend adjoining rooms if you have a family stay. 
I want to just give these a three star review but the hotel is in a great area for site seeing and looks great inside. 
There are cheaper hotels with better service in London in similar areas. ",4,2014,12,03
150,Continues to be Excellent,"This was the third year in a row I stayed at the Hyatt Churchill and it has been consistently excellent. Yes the rooms are somewhat standard but they are fine. They are kept clean and in good working condition. I had no complaints about the wifi or anything else.

What makes the Churchill stand out is its exceptional staff. They are all, except for perhaps one person, incredibly helpful while being professional and classy. I had to attend a conference at the Radisson across the street. The staff there are also excellent, helpful and professional. Just the touch of class is different. That difference is also evident in the lobby and common areas. If you do not care about that extra touch, then stay at the Radisson instead. I am sure it is less money.  And both are in one of the best London locations.",5,2014,12,03
150,Disappointing,Stay here a few times a year on work. Location is great. I find service standards in the front office have slipped considerably over the years. Possibly because there is quite a large amount of staff turnover. The most frustrating aspect of the stay was the poor quality of the wifi. ,3,2014,12,02
150,Worth the Price,"Yes, the room is a tad small, but it's perfectly adequate. Great location for those on business or tourists. Marylebone is a great district with awesome charm and great little eateries on every corner. 

Service is outstanding. After a very long flight fromCalifornia, I arrived around 12pm and they already had my room available. 

On-site dining options were fine, and the food was decent. You could probably find better close-by, but for those on business, The Churchill room service/eatery is just fine.

The elevators are terribly slow, and the gym is practically a closet, but at least you have one if you want to work out. 

All-in-all, not a bad place to stay. ",4,2014,11,29
150,"Nice location, fresh breakfast ","I liked the hotel but I complained from the dust in the room for room keeping with no progress. I liked the location as its close to Oxford street .. Hyde park & good restaurants.. 
I liked the breakfast it was fresh & tasty . The staff where helpful as well as we were in business course & they took good care of us.

Regards",4,2014,11,27
150,It's the Hyatt,"Location, location, location. 

Lobby was charming with the picture of Queen Elizabeth sleeping.
Room was small but in term of European standard, it's the average size. All the amenities is there.

Gym was very small and average, could do basic fitness regiment only.

Breakfast was average but a lot of condiments. Need more variety as been seeing/eating the same buffet spread for the whole entire 6 days.

Staff could be more attentive like the cutlery wasn't provided and only given when asked. But all the service was done with a smile.

I like the housekeeping team, very friendly and attentive.",3,2014,11,23
150,Excellent service,"We booked into the Hyatt Churchill ,a firm favourite of ours just for one night .
When we arrived it was closed!! There had been a problem during the night and the hotel had been evacuated .we were directed to the hotel opposite and within 15 minutes a staff member from the hyatt named Judy had booked us into the Four Seasons park lane .
Excellent service .smooth & professional .
Our thoughts are with the staff who were injured .
Hope to see you all very soon 
Thank you",5,2014,11,22
150,"Pretty Good Hotel in Central London, but Expensive","My Company requested I made a business trip to London and suggested I stay in the Churchill Hotel. Big surprise at cost of the room, which was stated as a 'Single Standard'. £336 a night. I only stayed one night and the breakfast I considered to be a fairly basic 'English' style breakfast but the price £30 was not basic.

The room was fine, king size bed, good free Wi-Fi internet access, but for one night only after that it was £17 for the next 24 hours. Had problems with the TV and had to get one of the hotel staff to fix it.

Coffee making facilities in the room is just cheap sachet instant coffee with just four mini skimmed milk cartons. No biscuits provided. Nearly all other 5 star hotels I have stayed in have good quality Senseo type coffee makers and real full cream milk.

Hotel staff were polite and helpful. Would I stay there again. No.",4,2014,11,21
150,"First class, but pricey","This is a top notch hotel in a fine neighbourhood (Marylebone/Marble Arch), so you can't go wrong. The room is cosy and comfortable, and the bathroom is well equipped with toiletries. There's not all that much room to move round in the bathtub though. Breakfast was delicious, though the price, at nearly GBP 34 including taxes, was totally exaggerated - I can breakfast at home for a month on that amount. I didn't realise that the special deal of breakfast for GBP 20 had to be signed up for at check-in, and thought you could just come down to breakfast the next morning and get the lower rate.
The hotel is only a 10-15 minute walk from Paddington station where you can catch the Heathrow Express train to the airport. There are lots of restaurants and cafes, and stores in the neighbourhood.
It's just a question whether you think the rooms are worth paying over GBP 300/night for. There was some noise from other residents slamming their doors as they entered or left their rooms. There is also some traffic noise from the street below, even though my room looked out on to the park.",3,2014,11,19
150,Great stay experience...,"London stays are not for the faint hearted - it's a very expensive place to stay, so you should make your stay stretch as much as you can.

The Churchill is a business hotel, but you can accommodate small families.  I stayed there for 5 nights with my daughter and I also used the Diamond upgrade to a Regency Suite upgrade, which was spectacular.  We were given a suite at the 7th floor club room. 

The staff were amazingly helpful all the way, breakfast at the lounge was more than generous, very clean rooms, attentive service - couldn't ask for more.

Notable is the very high levels of security present, which gave me a sense of comfort.",5,2014,11,19
150,"Return visit, and excellent once more!","A weekend in London again, and  once more we booked the Churchill......and again the staff excelled in every way. The exec floor rooms on the 7th /8th and 9th floors have access to the 2 very comfortable lounges offering refreshments and a bit of peace and quiet.  
The rooms are on the small side  but very comfortable...all facilities are there and free wi fi easy to connect.
The bar downstairs is luxurious and the staff welcoming and efficient. Try the Jaipur beer!!! fantastic drink but one was enough at 5.8 %!!
A great hotel with the Oxford Street shops just a couple of minutes walk away.",5,2014,11,19
150,"A nice hotel, great location, but very over priced","Booked myself to a club room on a recent stay. The only difference between these types of rooms and the rest of the hotels is only the location of the rooms (floors 7, 8 and 9) and the access to the club lounge. The rest are exactly the same. The rooms are decent size, the bed is firm, clean, everything functioning well. The bathroom a tad small, but you do get a bath tub, instead of just a shower stall. I particularly love the Molton Brown toiletries. I got a room not too far from the lift and just across from a service door. It was impossible to take a nap. I kept on hearing the 'ding' of the lifts and the service door being banged opened and closed. Avoid this at all cost!

Breakfast was a spread at the club lounge (you can take the breakfast at the Montagu downstairs at extra cost), but warm selection is VERY limited. Each day they'd have scrambled eggs and hard boiled eggs with sauteed mushroom. On certain days, they'd get rid of the mushroom and replace with poached eggs. They do make killer pastries: so light and flaky, almost like that from a French pattiserie.

The afternoon and early evening selection was decent. But the lounge does get full at breakfast and evening cocktail time.

With the number of new hotels opening up in London and charging a fraction of Hyatt Regency, I think better value exists elsewhere. You may be able to score better rooms with less money. But probably, you won't get the pedigree...",3,2014,11,16
150,A Great London Hotel,"We stayed at the Hyatt Churchill for two nights in preparation of a Transatlantic crossing. We arrived in mid-morning and our room was waiting which we greatly appreciated after an all night flight. We stayed in a standard ""Club"" room but where offered a suite. Club level grants access to concierge lounge for breakfast and drinks throughout the day. Was a great feature for us. Breakfast had great options and the dinner ""Snacks"" were great. Of special note is that they have two lounges, one for families and one with no children. As you can imagine one was much quieter than the other.

Staff was very international,  easy to talk to and eager to please. The morning we were leaving for our cruise, my glasses broke. The concierge had the ""special"" screw driver and fixed everything and saved the day!!

Hotel is in great location with great shopping and restaurants near by. We had dinner one night in the hotel and it was good and reasonably priced AND they had a great live piano player for entertainment.

So in summary if you are looking for a good hotel in a great location the Hyatt Churchill fills the bill.",5,2014,11,16
150,Five star family weekend,"The Churchill proved to be a fantastic choice for our long family weekend in London; right in the middle of culture, sights and shopping.

I had some doubts how 5* business hotel would suit to family stay (with two grumpy pre-teens) but from the first welcome greeting we truly felt comfortable. No stiff upper lip anywhere.
Our rooms, with connecting door, were on Club floor which gave us access to the lounge: great place for planning your day or relaxing after serious shopping.
Kids ate a bit too much cookies and candies there, though.",5,2014,11,13
150,Traditional hotel with excellent service,"From the Molton Brown amenities to the extremely comfortable beds this hotel strives for excellence. 
Service is always wonderful and the staff do the utmost to help. 
The lounge can get busy at times.
The rooms facing Portman Square offer the best view.",5,2014,11,12
150,A fine hotel with staff to match,"This is an outstandingly good hotel as far as their Montagu restaurant and their bar are concerned. The public ground floor space is impressive, smart and modern but still with a comfortable feel to it. None of us stayed the night so I cannot comment on their rooms.
Our group meets monthly at a good London hotel for dinner,with drinks afterwards, and of the 52 hotels we have been to, so far, the Churchill was one of the very best. The meal for 15 of us was excellent, served very efficiently but unobtrusively, and at a very reasonable price. The refurbished bar was very pleasant and comfortable, and not overcrowded.
Most of all, the staff were friendly, courteous and helpful without exception, from the moment I went in to arrange the dinner a few weeks previously, to when we left the bar late in the evening. My colleagues and I appreciated their professionalism, and the high quality of the hotel generally.",5,2014,11,08
150,Good Location Poor Everything Else,Am a platinum member and used points for two free weekend nights.  Reservation was booked months in advance with request for a Portman Square view.  Was told at check-in that no upgrades were available.  My room was in a corner looking into the room on the opposite corner.  What a view!  No upgrade and a view of a wall.  i have stayed in lots of London hotels but this one is the worst.  Glad I am moving to another hotel that shows it knows how to treat its loyal customers.  This stay will end my stays at any Hyatt property.,1,2014,11,07
150,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel could not have been more accomadating to Americans...no need to worry about hair tools...they have them all.  Great restaurant and breakfast.  My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights 4 of which were on a Tauck Tour.  This was our first time in London and I would come back to this hotel without question.  Comfortable room, great staff, wonderful location.  This has it all.",5,2014,11,05
150,Better choices in the area,"I recently stayed for six nights. 

Positive comments:

Really nice included breakfast with fresh fruit, cheese, salmon and cooked to order items.

Nice restaurant and bar area with fireplace.

Helpful concierge

Large bathroom with tub and shower.

Only two short blocks from Oxford Street shopping.

Negative comments:

We booked a ""triple room"" with a tour company.  We received a double room with the smallest roll away bed I have ever seen.  There was NO room for the extra bed.  Housekeeping had to remove two chairs and an ottoman from the room.  When I tried to address this issue with the front desk they told me that the hotel has no triple rooms and that tour companies commonly mislabel the room as a ""triple"".  They offered to do nothing for me.  Not acceptable.

The free wifi does not work. They charge extra for high speed.  I called and they upgraded me to high speed for no additional cost but it still did not work very well.  I stayed in two other hotels in London and had functioning free wifi.

White bath robes completely worn out--did not use.

Hard mattresses.

The hotel only earns two stars for the way they handled the ""triple room"" issue. They knew my room was pre-paid and it was obvious that they did not care that we failed to receive the type of room that we booked.",2,2014,11,04
150,All you need is ... Hyatt!,"We had (me and my girlfriend) the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights in a ""king club room"", from 31 October until 3 novembre . We had a very nice  room, desk, flat screen TV, large bedroom (king size) and very comfortable bathroom! Especially, very interesting is the service ""Regency Club lounge"". You can have a continental breakfast (very completely with everything) and the nice ""cocktail hour"" before dinner. 
If you are staying in Hyatt, you'll live London completely differently! 
Congratulations to all the staff! Always ready for any request!

Thank a lot,

150,Beautiful property in a great location,"We had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights in an upgraded suite.  We had a very nice living room with sofa, desk, flat screen TV, half bath and a large bedroom and bath with all the necessary amenities.  Breakfast was wonderful - everything you could think of on the buffet and anything you wanted made-to-order.  The restaurant overlooks the street so you can see all the foot traffic outside as they pass the beautiful planting boxes under the windows.  The location was ideal for us as easy walking distance to Marble Arch, Oxford St., underground lines, Hyde Park, etc.  Service was top notch and everyone was very friendly.  There are computers in the lobby to use for boarding passes or just checking email.  I loved that the area was open with huge windows looking on to the street and park across the street.  We enjoyed evening snacks and cocktails in the club lounge.  The food was good and there was a nice, different selection every night.  Hot items were made fresh and circulated during the evening.  It was just enough for us after a late lunch.

I have only one criticism.  Our room was on the 7th floor and when you got within 3 doors of our room you could smell stale cigarettes.  And also in the bedroom at night.  It woke me up one night and I started sneezing.  I don't know if my room intake vents were close to smoking rooms or smoking areas in the street level bars, but it wasn't very appealing.  I am discounting this in my review since I could have asked to change rooms, and you could too if it bothers you.  No one else I spoke to  had this problem so it could have been only a room or two.  All in all this is a great city hotel in a great location for a visit to London.",5,2014,11,01
150,Polite and friendly staff and good value,"I booked online and when my wife and I with our 14 year old child arrived we were offered an upgrade to a suite for one third of the normal rate. As the room was more spacious than the standard room we accepted. There was no pressure to change and the manager - Solihy (apologies if I have spelt the name incorrectly) was extremely helpful and friendly. We had also booked the 'club' room which I would 100% recommend as it includes a continental breakfast which included eggs and various meats as well as cereal, porridge, croissants and various cakes/pastries. Also you can visit there during the day for teas/coffee etc and in the evening they serve canopies. But to be fair it was more like an evening tea with bread/cheeses/meats/vegetables/deserts and as much alcoholic drinks that you could consume without any restriction. There was wine, Champagne, whisky, gin etc so it was extremely good value for money.  The waiter Chu was very friendly and attentive. He remembered that I wanted tea, my wife coffee and my daughter hot chocolate. These little touches count for a lot. We will certainly be returning again and I heartily recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,31
150,Charming staff at the club,"Book the club rooms if you can . The club room is quiet ,personal with smashing staff ,a place to escape from the bars and restaurant .
Rooms are not huge ,but this is London,well appointed with very very comfortable beds. Compact marble bathrooms with molton brown products .meverything is very clean . Only grip - I would have liked softer pillows. Rooms are triple glazed ,so really peaceful with effective black out blinds .
You can't beat the location",5,2014,10,29
150,Wonderful 5 night Stay,"Let me say I created some drama when i first got to the hotel, loosing my credit card in the train station. Daniel at the front desk was amazing!! He kept me calm and helped me contact the credit card company. Throughout our stay every time he saw me he came out from behind the front desk to see how i was doing and how our stay was and truly showed concern. He helped with our late check out and some other issues as well, always maintaining professionalism and the highest level of service.  Two of the concierge' who were above board were Gigi and Jeanne or Jeanie ( blonde hair).  The hotel is lovely. Restaurant very good. King bed was very comfortable and showers strong and hot when you wanted them to be. Location was nice we were not familiar with the area near marble arch but plenty of restaurants and close to both marble arch and bond street tube stations.  Housekeeping was great and when my husband requested a small cereal bowl so he could use it for his shave soap when we returned to our room there was a silver shaving bowl in the bathroom !! thank you for the extra touches! We would highly recommend!",5,2014,10,28
150,Great place for a romantic meeting,"Amazing and very cosy place in the heart of London. You can stay outside (with the blanket) or you can warm up inside near the fireplace. An incredible choice of cocktails and yummy nibbles will make your evening unforgettable.
      ",5,2014,10,27
150,Great Afternoon Tea!,"If you are in London and looking for a spot to have a nice Afternoon tea, I strongly encourage The Churchill. My husband and I went during our honeymoon and had a great time. I was impressed with everything and would go back!",4,2014,10,27
150,Great location!,"We stayed here on a recent business trip to London and were really impressed.

The location is great, it is just off the busy shopping streets so perfect if you want to go and do some shopping but quiet as it is off a side street (and you can take the back road from the marble arch tube to the hotel to avoid the crowds).

The rooms in the hotel are really comfortable, I noticed previous reviews said the rooms were small but we found ours to be very spacious. We had a corner room so perhaps they are different?

The staff were all really helpful and the service was excellent. Our check in was quick and they were able to give us an early check in after coming from a very early flight which was great.

During our stay all of the power went out along one wall in the room so non of the plugs were working, the hotel straight away sent an engineer out to fix the problem and he was with us really quickly and when he was unable to solve the problem right away he installed a new extension cable and came back to fix it when we had left the room which was really helpful.

Our room didn't include breakfast so we ordered room service for breakfast and this was delivered quickly and was excellent.

All in all we really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone!",4,2014,10,27
150,Brunch was great,"My wife and I went to the hotel as the guest of my godson and his fiancee, plus his parents for Sunday brunch. 
We live in Canada and are well versed in the North American brunch experience.  I was very impressed by the brunch we had , though not the vast selection one sees in NA what was there was of extremely good quality well presented and tasty.
I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who craves a diffrent experience on a Sunday in London.",4,2014,10,24
150,Montagu Restaurant at the Churchill,"We didn't stay in this hotel but my partner had booked me a surprise birthday treat for Sunday brunch here.  Well, I was most impressed with everything. The hotel is beautiful art deco style and we were given a window table, which I was pleased about. Our waiter was lovely and nothing was too much for him. The room had a buzzy atmosphere as there was a really good little jazz band there, which provided very good background ambience, which was not too loud.  The food is amazing! It is beautifully presented top class and good quality food and there is almost everything one could want on offer for brunch and Sunday roast. I was only a little disappointed not to find roast chicken on offer but the friendly chefs in the open kitchen would have made me a chicken breast if I'd asked for it.  My partner had beef, which was a little too rare for his liking but still very tasty, he said. I had  the lamb, which came ready cut, but was very very good. The lovely staff also prepared me a little birthday cake with candle and everyone in the room sang ""happy birthday"", which was a lovely (if slightly embarrassing) touch.  I know this is an expensive treat but it was worth every penny - especially as all the soft drinks and the Pommery Champers was free flowing and never ending.  This was a fantastic treat and I'm sure we will return one day!",5,2014,10,23
150,"Good location, not too busy","The hotel is situated approximately two blocks from Oxford Street. It is not too far, you just need to cross two small roads to get to Oxford Street which I think is quite convenient as it is not too busy unlike the hotels exactly situated in Oxford Street itself. The hotel overall is not a modern hotel, it is a colonial type of hotel.

Checking in was easy. Reception staff was helpful and friendly.

Room is not too big and not too small either. It is just nice and comfortable. 

Breakfast has a small selection of breads, cereal and the normal stuff. The waffle is good though, I try to eat it everyday. Some rooms have access to the Club at Level 8. I did not try it but I understand that it is not too big.

Distance to Oxford Street is not that far, you will find Next on your right, Primark across the street and New Look and Selfridges on the left. So it is very convenient and a wonderful location.

The gym surprises me though as it is a room or two rooms converted into a gym. So, to get in you need to swipe your room key and the equipments etc are not visible from the outside. It can be a bit scary if you are alone or with one or two strangers at the gym. Perhaps it is better for ladies to go to the gym not at odd hours for example in the middle of the night etc as it can be very quiet.

Otherwise, everything else is good and I enjoyed my stay there.",4,2014,10,21
150,Job well done ...,"Unfortunately I only stayed there 1 night and 2 very short days. A lot of things were going on at the hotel...very busy...conferences, etc. Nice location and close to a lot of shops and restaurants but didn't have far to go to eat b/c the restaurant at the hotel suited us just fine. We had to leave early to catch a flight but hope to be back to check out the breakfast buffet. The room was nice as well as the bathroom...very nice and updated. I hope to be back at the Hyatt Regency and experience more of the amenities.",4,2014,10,21
150,"Fine location, with private park.","For private visit to London, this hotel is among my top choices. Should get the Club class room. One block from Oxford Street Marble Arch. Near famous chinese restuarants in Baywater Street and not far from theatre districts. Asking the concierge, then you can get into the opposite private park.  The hotel was serviced with expected British polite style. Only drawback are the London hotel price comparing with what you can get in the Far East for the same price, and bathroom facilities cannot be compared with those of Hyatt Regency in the Far East.",4,2014,10,19
150,Very disappointed at treatment,I stayed her for a wedding where upon getting out of the shower I fell and hurt all my ribs and my arm and had to take time off university because of this. I told reception were I was made to feel a liar and a fraud by the girl on the desk.  The more I discussed this with people the angrier I became so I notified the management of my treatment where I was told I would get a free nights stay next time I was in the capital to show they were a caring hotel and there way of apologising.  A few months later I called to take this up where upon I was willing to book extra nights at my cost to be told they never promised me this what they said was next time I booked with them they would make sure I had a good stay. Why would I rebook after my fall? I have never made a complaint tried to get a free night on false claims I was made to feel a complete an utter liar on the telephone who was trying to pull a fast one. All I can say I was not seriously hurt as I would have sued due to their horrendous treatment of their guests and hopefully next time if anybody does slip on the floor and fall into the bath as I did it will not be fatal.,1,2014,10,18
150,My Preferred Hotel in London,"After eight years of staying in other London hotels when on business trips, this hotel is tops!   It is now my first choice and I have stayed 20+ nights this year.  Guest service levels are superb and it seems the management is very focused on hiring guest service staff who can are most friendly.

Rooms in London hotels are frequently quite small, but this property does not suffer as badly as many others. Rooms are fresh and comfortable. Restaurants are very good, though pricy.

The biggest challange with this hotel is room availability during peak holiday seasons in the ME, but special efforts are made to fit in repeat customers.",5,2014,10,17
150,A charming hotel,"A definite five star rating from me !!!! Everything was smooth and friendly from start to finish.  We stayed for one night for my husbands 40th birthday.  

On arrival we were sent to the private check in area on the 8th floor (I think!) and then brought up to our suite.  There was a really delicious chocolate birthday cake and champagne waiting for us which was a nice surprise.  

Our suite was really comfortable and quiet.  A lovely big king size bed, spacious bathroom and living area and also a second toilet. We had a quick bite to eat in the Montagu bar which had great atmosphere, friendly staff and the food was extremely tasty.  

That is one thing about this hotel, the staff were really friendly, cheery and helpful.  We also had a couple of drinks after supper in The Churchill Bar and Terrace.  We sat outside knowing that the minimum spend is £25 but it is just so lovely and there are heaters and blankets for when you get cold.

It is a great area for amazing restaurants and shopping, Selfridges is just around the corner.  We will be coming back for sure !!!!",5,2014,10,16
150,Lovely,Intriguing hotel. Would have given 5 stars if the lobby was more inviting. One had to go into dining area to sit. Service perfect. Restaurant very good. Don't ask for coffee after breakfast b/c not available. Room very nice. Loved that we were in control of thermostat. Baths excellent,4,2014,10,14
150,Reservations.,"Positives - terrific location, recently refurbished by the look of it, comfortable rooms (not large but in london space can be elusive) and public areas, good service/drinks in the bar. Negatives - bathroom can be on the slippery side and very misty. Regency club is well appointed but over my three days the staff were almost completely disengaged with guests.One guy was harried and pleasant - the rest well - a smile and a greeting would have helped - lots of standing around clutching trays and chatting with their colleagues. Hospitality in short supply - and the only efficiency was the noisy clearing for bar area at precisely 7-30pm. I expected the lights to brought up and chairs onto the tables. Afternoon tea in the Montagu - 65mins to get a lukewarm rather hard scone to go with the tea that arrived 20 mins before..but the bill did arrive quickly.
Comfortable 4 star hotel of good style but let down by a lack of competent and engaged staff in key areas. Getting it right isn't that hard.",3,2014,10,13
150,Not the usual Hyatt experience,"This is not the usual Hyatt hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 3:05 pm after a 10 hour flight, only to be told that our room is not ready. The front desk told is that the previous guest is still in the room and will be checking out an hour later! Funny thing is check in is at 3 pm. The front desk clerk then adds that the guest in the room is a hyatt member. Well, the other funny thing is I am a platinum hyatt member. He told me that I would have to wait for atleast an hour and a half before the room would be ready. We had our 7 year old child with us as well who was very tired from the long flight. When I finally told him that waiting is not something I'm willing to do, we were given a substandard room. I have taken pictures of the dirty lampshades and drapes which I will be emailing to corporate hyatt. A week earlier, I had requested a pull out bed. The room given to us is so tiny that I was forced to refuse the bed. So needless to say, the stay isn't comfortable at all. 
In addition, the staff can be quite rude. When we visited the restaurant for breakfast, the host asked us if we knew that the breakfast is not included with the room. Not sure if she was trying to see if we could afford the breakfast (yes, we were very well dressed.) This was extremely insulting. Plus, no effort is made to accommodate platinum members for last minute reservations for dinner. We have been turned away twice already. 
This hotel does cater to a massive middle eastern clientele and I do believe that they are mainly concerned with servicing this particular clientele. I honestly believe, I should have booked with Marble  Arch Marriott as we are Marriott platinum members as well and service is far, far better at that hotel.

150,Lovely hotel,"I have  just returned from a  1 night stay , everything was excellent, room, food, service but was shocked to find when my Freind and I went to the bar and at 10.30 p /m was told as there was no seating available at the bar and also all surrounding tables were occupied we had to wait outside until seating became available , unbelievable , you pay £400 a night to be told you cannot go for a drink, I was away with a Freind for her birthday had been to a show and thought we would have a drink to finish the evening.  I have stayed at the other 5 Star hotels in London and that has never happened . We were seated after 10 minutes but the situation was not acceptable for such a quality hotel.",5,2014,10,12
150,Overall excellent ... A few glitches,"HYATT Churchill in London.

We stayed five days flying in from the United States. This was a pleasure visit. It was overall a very pleasant stay.

POSITIVES: This is a luxury hotel and as such one expects and does get very good service. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.   The restaurant (Montegu) very nice.  The second Italian restaurant was under renovation, and thus closed. By contacting the e- concierge prior to  arrival we requested early check-in, as most flights from USA arrive around 8 AM. They made it clear that this can be not be guaranteed, however,  upon arrival they were able to get us into a nice room right away. A nice chocolate cake and a chilled bottle of Champagne appeared on the day of my husbands birthday (I had mentioned it at time of reservation). They have two Regency Club lounges, one being an adults only no kid zone. They allow dogs (inquire about size limits).

CULTURAL DIVERSITY: this is likely a reflection on London, UK. Many middle eastern women and some men in very traditional clothing were staying at the hotel (even with burqa for some of the women).  A very nice red newer model coupe  Rolls-Royce with Kuwait license plates was parked in front of the lobby entrance. Not something typically seen in USA.

NEGATIVES: Not many. But some of the negatives mentioned in other TripAdvisor reviews for this luxury hotel were unfortunately also experienced by us, likely indicative of deeper unresolved problem with staffing and technology/ engineering upgrades. The timing and quality of room service was not consistent. A special request for extra pillows had to be made three times. The WiFi access via iBahn is very unreliable: the basic free access ( for Platinum members and up) is worthless; so bad they give you the fast iBahn for free when you complain; but even the fast iBahn WiFi was very slow or occasionally not working.  The hotel knows about this chronic issue, but in 2014 this is not right form a luxury hotel. Then there are a few lesser issues. The electronic keys to open the door to your hotel room are easily disrupted if close to your cell phone. It was almost impossible to control the temperature inside the room (perhaps we should have called for help from engineering, but did not).  Each room already has one USA and one mainland Europe electric outlet; but in today's travel world with two iPhones and two iPads per couple in one room this is not enough. They  provided extra adapters, but one was defective. The USA electric outlet for "" shavers only"" in the bathroom was not strong enough to charge my iPad.

COST BENEFIT RATIO: it is a pricy luxury hotel. They try to add on £60 to £120 each per day for basic upgrades available at no cost for Platinum members in many similar HYATT properties in USA (because they are in London,or so they explain), such as free upgrade to better room class (simply a street/ park view) or access to Regency Club lounges.  The added value of Regency Club lounge access ( called concierge / elite lounges in USA) is - for this property - minimal when compared to the add on cost; luckily they realize this, and are willing to adjust that cost. But you have to ask.

Overall a great hotel. Will gladly return if I can get a few free nights (e.g., HYATT VISA card rewards) combined with a few paying nights. My car does not have a Kuwait license plate.",4,2014,10,12
150,Excellent staff and food,"Stayed here for a conference of 120 people. The catering team were excellent. good food and attentive service. in fact, if you got up to replenish your plate you would find your glass or cup already cleared away when you returned to the table. it is not often I complain about service being too prompt! 
Bedroom very comfortable. I liked the pillows - a variety of soft and firm.
Convenient location close to Marble Arch Tube Station. If you have three days here then use the cleaning service around the corner from the hotel. 48 hour service at about 30% of the hotel laundry costs. Many good restaurants within ten minutes walking. Oxford Street is 5 minutes away.",4,2014,10,11
150,Lovely,"Beautiful hotel,  excellent location and just delicious food. Worth a visit if not just to try the restaurant! The service here is both friendly and efficient and would recommend to friends and family. A friend of mine also held her wedding reception here and we could not fault this hotel in every respect. ",5,2014,10,09
150,great base to explore London,"We stayed 3 nights in September at the Hyatt in London. We had a standard room which was fine for our purposes (we were using award nights). The hotel is located on the north east corner of Hyde Park and is an easy 5 minute walk to the park.  The street the hotel is located on is a fairly quiet street 3 blocks off of Oxford which has plenty of shopping and restaurants; the nearest tube station is Marble Arch. While not in the middle of everything, the hotel is convenient enough for getting around London- especially by bus or tube- the trade off being the area is not as congested as others.
The room was comfortable was high quality furnishings and everything was in good repair and clean, and the climate control worked well. There was a coffee service in the room as well as a mini-bar and a safe. While the room is fairly compact, it was above average size by London standards.  
Front desk staff (especially Marta) was very friendly and welcoming and helpful as was the bell staff. The housekeeping staff was efficient and thorough.
We were visiting London on holiday, and the hotel seemed mostly filled with business and convention guests during our stay. The prices in the hotel restaurant and bar seem high even by London standards. We did enjoy a room-service breakfast and were very pleased with the food and service. There are several close-by options for dining for those not wishing to eat at the hotel.  
This was a very pleasant hotel and we would not hesitate to stay here again, but am not sure if it is worth the $400+ per night rate.",4,2014,10,07
150,Very nice hotel: enjoyed it.,"We stayed at the Churchill for six nights in September 2014.  We stayed on the 7th floor and found the room comfortable.  The maids were especially nice.  We had access tot he lounges on the 8th floor and loved them.  The food in the lounge was very good, and the service was good.
We were very happy eating there, and usually skipped dinner after eating in the lounge.  The concierge desk on the 8th floor was also very good.  We appreciated the multicultural feel of the hotel.",5,2014,10,06
150,Wish I could have stayed for longer!,"My partner and I recently spent 1 night at The Churchill and we had a fantastic time. As a birthday treat I was whisked away to London for the night to see a performance at The Royal Opera House. We picked the hotel due to its location (just off Oxford Street! Perfect!) and overall look. I simply wish that I could have spent more time there to enjoy it more! 
The staff were friendly, courteous and professional at all times, and could not have been more pleasant. They genuinely looked as though they enjoyed what they did and took real pride in the service they provided. We only stayed for one night, so packing was tight (hence I forgot to pack some essentials!). I rang down to housekeeping just to ask if they knew where the nearest chemist was, and even though they were extremely busy about 5 minutes later someone knocked on the door with a bag full of toiletries for use! I hadn't even asked them directly!
The bathroom was small but nice, with a big tub and shower, with a dressing mirror and pleasant toiletries! Very comfortable King-Sized bed and 42 inch Television was appreciated after a long day :) 
Overall, probably the best hotel I've stayed in and my only wish is that I could have stayed longer and would have probably gone for an upgraded room on a higher floor as it was a bit noisy at night. (If they would ever like to put us up for the night in a upgraded suite for free that would be ideal!! :)) Would stay here again in a heartbeat! 

Thank you to all of the staff for making our stay wonderful!!",5,2014,10,06
150,Elegance in London,"An excellent experience. You are greeted by a rather unusual portrait of the Queen, who looks very unwelcoming, unlike the reception staff. I was upgraded to a Regency Suite, which was spacious and comfortable. It also had a balcony, so it was great to be able to open the door and get some fresh air. Service throughout the hotel was excellent. Overall definitely to be recommended. I'll be back.",4,2014,10,06
150,Great location and well refurbished,"Stayed here for a week and this hotel is in fact quite good.

It is London so the room rates are expected to be steep, not a complaint, just pointing this out.

The location is great, with the Oxford street just two blocks away. And the underground station is within a 5-min walk.

The room however is tiny, but it still allows you enough space to walk around. After all you wont spend much time in the room.

One thing I wanna point out is the design of the bathroom. There is a glass panel in the bath tub. But it is movable and would be dangerous if people lose footing and try to get hold of it. I understand it is a UK-thing, but London is an international city and the hotel should perfect the design to prevent accident from happening.",3,2014,10,05
150,Not up to Hyatt Standards,"We were quite disappointed with our stay at this Hyatt. It just wasn't great value for the tiny average room and location. The service wasn't great either in the restaurant or hotel. The wait staff in the restaurant was very slow and unfriendly. We couldn't get help bringing our bags down at checkout so we did it ourselves.
This was our 4th trip to London. The service was better at the Ritz and Brown's Hotels.",2,2014,10,04
150,Wish I spent more time in the hotel...,"I spent four nights here recently, and all I have to say is the title of this review - I really wish I spent more time in the hotel to enjoy it. As it is, the big advantage of the hotel is its fantastic location so close to Oxford Street, which is why I spent so little time in the hotel in the first place. Consequently, I did not get to use the gym since Hyde Park was so close by, and did not get to experience the restaurants, since there was such a plethora of options nearby.

The sleep quality was fantastic - have not had such a great sleep in a long time. This was especially helpful in avoiding jet lag, as I traveled from the Subcontinent for a conference starting early the next morning. Check in was a breeze and everyone was very helpful and knowledgeable. 

The hotel is a bit pricey, but in my opinion, the location and service more than make it worthwhile.",4,2014,10,02
150,Nice stay.... hotel not incredible for the price,"I stayed at this property in September.
I checked in early and had requested that. The front desk desk attendant was very friendly and was able to accommodate me right away with a room, even thought it's not guaranteed. 

Since I'd arrived in the morning (10am) and was staying in a Club room, I put my belongings in the room and headed to the Club Lounge for breakfast. 

The room itself was nothing spectacular. It was very clean, had a very comfortable king size bed... but no flat sheet, just a duvet to cover. 
The bathroom had a nice, although narrow tub, toilet and bidet, a robe, slippers and beautiful smelling Molton Brown beauty products
There were also several different outlets in the wall for different types of plugs... one was 110v which is great since I'm Canadian.
There is also a laptop sized safe free for use, and stocked tea and instant coffee with a kettle. I never partook of the mini-bar.
But all in all, just a typical hotel room.

The Club lounge staff was very attentive and each of the daily provisions was excellent... breakfast til 11am, large variety of foods, cereals, cheeses, toast, hot eggs, meats, tea, cappuccino, fresh fruit. 
There were delicious treats throughout the day...fruit, chocolates, brownies, beer, water, juice, pop.
And the evening reception was wonderful. In fact we ate there as our ""supper"" several days. Sooo much to choose from as well as complimentary wine, champagne, beer etc. The food was delectable.
The restaurant downstairs however... service was very slow. Twice, in two visits, after asking for the cheque... we had to walk to the desk on our way out to pay because the server never came with it. Frustrating.

Check out was quick and easy.

I did enjoy my stay, but for the very hefty per night rate, i would have expected a lot more. I wouldn't pay a high rate to stay here again.",4,2014,10,02
150,Would not recommend for the price you pay!,"We stayed at the hotel for one night over the weekend and having got the room at a reduced price I have to say I was surprisingly disappointed.

Room was average size and quality and there were sticky stains on the carpet. Check in was easy and smooth and the staff seemed friendly. Lifts are very slow and we seemed to spend a lot of time waiting for them!

The atmosphere in the bar was lovely and cocktails are great - you would expect them to be at £17 a pop!!

We were given an interconnecting room overlooking the park however we were only in the one room. Every noise of the adjoining room could be heard which was not very pleasant at 5am in the morning when some woman was giving out to her husband! I phoned reception to complain and they seemed to deal with it efficiently, however this did not stop the couple and their noise making! Was tempted to bang on their door it was that frustrating!

If you are staying in this hotel and you only need one room and they provide you with an intrconnecting one I would suggest saying that actually you would prefer a room without the interconnecting door.

Hope this helps! Lovely hotel but just not worth the price!",3,2014,09,30
150,Five Star Hotel!,"Having never been to London, it was difficult to choose an area to stay in such a large and busy city. This Hotel has a very impressive staff that is extremely helpful and resourceful. Everyone from the door men, housekeeping, concierge, front desk and the bar and restaurant staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is impeccably maintained. We especially enjoyed the beautiful Churchill Bar in the evenings. It is great for a late night bite to eat, drinks and desserts. We loved Giovanni, Eve and Luis and they made us feel like family! The Location, close to great shopping, theater and the tube is just minutes from Central London and most points of interest. This Hotel exceeded any expectations!",5,2014,09,30
150,Total Disappointment,"Arrived today, room dirty, tv not working and worse shower drain not working and went to turn and whole drain assembly came apart. Room size average at best. The ottoman in our room is filthy. Here for five days. I never complain, however, I am baffled as to the five star rating. We traveled through Italy with the same tour company and those hotels and spacious rooms were five star. The staff at the dest seem unaffected by our dissatisfaction.",2,2014,09,27
150,Wonderful place to stay in London,"Great hotel not far from Marble Arch. Very comfortable rooms. Great places for breakfast just around the corner that were recommended by the front desk. Very convenient to Hyde Park, Edgeware Road. Lots of middle eastern restaurants within a few blocks with good food and delicious baklava. Easy access to the underground and good shopping within walking distance.",5,2014,09,25
150,Top Notch Hotel,"My mother and I really enjoyed the Hyatt.  Initially, I had planned to book a hotel in Mayfair but I had two free nights at the Hyatt, so it was a no-brainer which helped us save over $1000 US dollars.  The location is great, just a couple of blocks from Marble Arch and close to all the major shopping districts.  One night, I walked all the way from Piccadilly Circus back to the hotel. 

The rooms in London (Europe in general) can be small, so the rooms at Hyatt are adequately sized for two people - we had a twin room which had plenty of closet space that ran half the length of the entry hall.  The bathroom was large, although the shower was difficult to figure out - just too many knobs and buttons to push.  The beds are extremely comfortable with fabulous bedding.  While on average, I think the rooms are overpriced for what they are - the one night we paid was $424 (268P) when realistically it should be just about half the cost but it's LONDON, so that's the way it is.

The location was great for a couple of restaurants in the area: we had breakfast at the Portman and Grazing Goat.

Finally, I MUST give a huge thanks for Ana Ferreira , the VIP Amenities and Minibar Team Leader.  I had notified the hotel that it was my mother's first trip to London, in addition her birthday was the next day after arrival.  Ana arranged for a lovely welcome package of fruit, chocolates and wine upon arrival.  The very next day, she sent up a chocolate mousse cake and prosecco with a personalized note wishing my mom a happy birthday.  She loved it and felt incredibly special.  I have stayed at 5 star resorts from the Four Seasons to St. Regis and the service we received was on-par.  Thank you to Ana and her team for a job well done - greatly appreciate it!",5,2014,09,22
150,A perfect hotel in a perfect location,"I have been staying at the Churchill for many years now and my last visit with members of my family ended on Saturday when we stayed for a total of 12 nights broken by a short stay in Birmingham. I have nothing but accolades for this establishment. The staff are amazing. They greet you by name (and this is a big and busy hotel!) from the doormen to the reception staff, the concierges and the staff at the Montagu restaurant where we enjoyed the most delicious breakfasts. By the way, the smoked salmon has got to be the finest and tastiest ever!!! The rooms are very comfortable for the modern traveller with all the necessary connections and plug points for laptops etc and wifi is complimentary throughout the hotel. The linen is of a high quality and the towels are soft and thick as are the terry robes. There is ample packing space and asking for extra hangers is a seamless exercise. I usually have long stays there and the Churchill really becomes a home away from home. We were so sad to leave on Saturday and everyone bid us such fond farewells, even hugging and embracing us with such warmth and kindness.  The lobby is beautiful and plush and, of course, the location is very very central. Selfridges and the swank Bond Street boutiques as well as Oxford Street are all minutes away and the tubes are within easy reach. The hotel overlooks Portman Square which is lovely and peaceful to look at each day.",5,2014,09,22
150,Unlike any Hyatt property I've ever stayed in,"Not my first stay at the hotel and I'm questioning whether I will ever come back. 3 primary concerns:

1. My club level room had the smallest closet I had ever seen in a hotel room. The drawers in the closet meant that any hanging jackets and shirts had to drape over the drawer unit (and an iron), while the miniscule few inches of full-length hanging space were taken up by an ironing board and robe which I had to remove and stand up next to my bed.

2. I had previously noted how difficult it was to get coffee at breakfast in the dining room. This time in the club lounge, I actually had to follow a server holding my coffee cup because the servers walked around and around part of the lounge and did not make eye contact with the tables they were missing. Pitiful is the only word I have for the service.

3. In the lounge, I saw guests on both days wearing pajamas. I expressed my surprise to the attendant and was told that Hyatt customers demand this. I was speechless. I have certainly never seen this in a Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton or Shangri-La lounge anywhere in the world and would have much preferred to not see it here. Really speaks to the class of customer, reinforcing my thought to stay elsewhere on future trips despite the hotel's proximity to my London office.",1,2014,09,19
150,Not your typical Hyatt,"I love this place for a variety of reasons. Great location. Easy access to the Underground 2 block walk). Short walk to Bond, Regent and Oxford St. shopping. Large rooms nicely furnished with large baths and Moulton Brown products. The Regency Club spread is hands down the nicest I've seen outside of China. Staff service was top notch. The only downside is the very slow internet speed and the erratic connection problems. The hotel looks and feels like a boutique hotel, not a major international chain.",5,2014,09,16
150,Perfect!,It's simply perfect. Next to fashion district and the shopping area pretty close to oxford street and kensington gardens. I love the sunday champagne brunch. Rooms are more than clean with classic furniture. Fitness center and a Restaurant with a great chef in the hotel itself.,5,2014,09,16
150,Could not have been better,"We booked a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary. From the check in experience onwards this was a superb experience, our room was upgrade to a view of Portman gardens and included access to the exclusive club lounge. Our room was a suite, very modern in design. All rooms had been cleaned to a high standard. The bedroom also had a tv, large king size bed with high quality bedding. Both the seating area and bedroom had patio doors leading onto a balcony with seating for two. The hotel delivered a fruit selection, a happy anniversary cake and a bottle of wine, all complimentary. All in all we were made to feel very special and valued guests. Will definitely be back.",5,2014,09,16
150,Great Location,"Whilst this is one of the bigger brands of hotel chains there is a level of uniqueness there, is this because we were in an Executive Club room, now that I'm not sure.  The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped out of the lift on the 8th floor check in and the access to the Club Lounge was excellent, where they have two lounges one where children are allowed and another opposite where they were not - great idea gives the client a choice with the same service in both.  This hotel is in a fantastic location, just a 10 minute walk from Marylebone Mainline Station which is ideal for those travelling from the Midlands on the Chiltern line.  Then just a five minute walk to the top of Oxford Street and Marble Arch tube station, a lovely selection of small restaurants nearby too.",4,2014,09,16
150,Very nice property,"Rooms were spacious and clean.  Ours had a lovely view over the park across the street.  Bathroom was modern with a nice shower (although why Europeans don't like full shower doors, I'll never understand).  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Our anniversary was noted with a bottle of champagne and a small cake, which was very much appreciated.  We arrived very late, after room service hours, but we were accommodated with a quick dinner sent to our room.  There was even a plug in the room that directly accommodated our American plugs, which was very convenient.  Bed was very comfortable.  Not surrounded by restaurants, but a pretty busy area with lots to choose from was just a short 2 blocks away.  Very much enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,09,15
150,Visiting the Churchill again,As usual a lovely hotel to stay at. Centrally located and easy access to shopping in Oxford Street. The staff are friendly and the breakfast buffet is fantastic. My room seemed a little poky compared to previous stays - luck of the draw I guess. The spa/day room facility is really tiny and not ideal to store luggage for a quick shower and change over when your room isn't ready or on route to the airport - I'd suggest you try organize a day room for this purpose. Overall a great London stay,4,2014,09,14
150,Excellent Hotel,"Good hotel facilities and friendly hotel staff. However, I wish next time I won't see those snacks left from last guest in my room. All in all, this hotel is still really nice especially its location is very convenient!",4,2014,09,13
150,Quality Personified,stayed for 3 nights recently. From the limo pickup at LHR to the checking out procedure everything went perfectly. The room was charming and spotless and all service was extended with a smile and a thank you. My wife stayed here last year and raved about the hotel - she was so correct. We availed ourselves to the bar lounge area many times and the service and quality of the drinks was excellent,5,2014,09,12
150,Convenient Location,"If arriving at LHR, take the Heathrow Connection for GBP 10 to Paddington and catch a taxi for about GBP 8 over to the Hyatt.  Or, if you're in a big hurry, save 15 minutes and take the Heathrow Express -- but the Express is more than twice the cost of the Connection.  Hotel is two blocks off Oxford, so it's isolated from the traffic and pedestrian traffic.  Comfy accommodations and all the amenities you'd expect from a Hyatt property.  Outstanding staff, unpretentious and genuinely hospitable.  Easy walk to Underground.  If you're an American, consider using Hyatt points for your stay unless you're a business traveler on a generous expense account.",4,2014,09,12
150,Great London Hotel,"The Hyatt London is a great Hotel. The location is fantastic, close to the Business District in the west end and in the middle of the world's best shopping, Oxford Street. It does not get better than this. The staff, restaurants and all facilities in the hotel are top Hyatt Standard. My preferred hotel in London.",4,2014,09,11
150,Top of the line at hyatt! Think Park Hyatt!,"From the minute i checked in to this wonderful hotel i was happy. I usually stay at Dorchester or the Mandarin London but decided to try this hotel as I know the Italian restaurant attached to them. What a surprise. Rooms amazing, food amazing, service not to be beat. This was truly a 5 star great hotel.",5,2014,09,10
150,Nice hotel in a great location,"We booked 5 rooms at Hyatt Regency the Churchill in London from Aug 27 to Sept 1, 2014.  The hotel was brightly lit with a lot of contemporary paintings on the walls. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. We just have a slight concern about the wall insulation. When our neighbors are talking, we can sometimes hear them from our beds. We can also sometimes hear the sounds of people passing outside our room. There were no street noise or sounds. Giulia at the Front Desk assisted us with check-in and she made us feel very welcome.

The Concierge staff are also great. We would like to commend Jennifer for exerting all-out effort to assist us.

Our only disappointment was that the hotel did not grant the late check out (till 2 PM)that we requested despite the fact that we booked 5 rooms (4 standards and one regency suite) for 5 nights. Only the suite was granted an one-hour extension. Our flight was at 6pm yet and we were planning to leave the hotel at 2 pm, thereby allowing our 94 year old mother to rest before our long flight.

The best feature about the Churchill is its location. It is within walking distance to Oxford Street. Shops nearby include Marks and Spencer, Selfridges, Primark, etc. The theater district and Chinatown are also not too far away. 

Overall, we would recommend this hotel to others.",4,2014,09,08
150,London Experience,The staff at the Hyatt Regency Churchill was outstanding.  They were always ready to assist in whatever you needed.  The only drawback was the selection of television channels.  There seemed to be overabundant number of Arabic choices.,5,2014,09,04
150,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed in the Regency Club of this wonderful hotel and must say that the Brits know how to provide hospitality.  The breakfast in the Club was terrific.  The afternoon snacks and beverages were good and the hors d'oeuvres in the evening, along with the wine, beer and liquor were enjoyable.  They also have an excellent expresso maker.",5,2014,09,03
150,great hotel in great location,"we recently stayed At the Hyatt -The Churchill for five days .we found it to be a great Hotel in a really conveniant location ,which made it easy to catch the tube and other public transport,and the big red bus.all only  five minute walk .Also had a lot of small restaurants really close ,which made it easy to go out for a meal as well as useing the hotel restaurants.The bar was also really friendly and welcoming
would definatley recommend it",4,2014,09,03
150,Beautiful place for a modern afternoon tea,"Hotel was beautiful, and the service was very nice.  
You need to stay on top of the concierge/show desk--they don't have their system computerized, so they can mess up appts.  Luckily, they were able to fix their mistakes, but I was mad and almost missed my showon the west end with my daughter.

It takes forever to get a taxi there, so plan at least an extra 30  minutes to get anywhere by cab.  We ended up flagging someone down and sharing a cab with somebody several times.
It's well located, but you still can't really walk all over london like you can manhattan.

the rooms are basically USA Hyatt quality (unlike, say, Paris, where a 5-star Hyatts is little better than an worn hotel).   

Had afternoon tea there, and it was delightful.  Modern, but with all the feel of 
afternoon tea in the city….  Did it with my daughter, who was 9.  It was adorable.
The staff was nice to children.  The upstairs club room clean, up-to-date but not
a bunch of leather furniture.  So breakfast was homey, not airport-like.
The food in the club was fresh and healthy, with dabs of decadence.  There was
cooked and cold fair.  No scones.   I was bummed.

The downstairs front desk is just a mad house.  If you can afford to go up to the upper floors, it's really worth it.  You get to sit while you check in, and in general, it's peaceful and quick.

My daughter finally asked the elevator man why he never could find his floor.  
The place is clean and modern with these weird ""English"" things like elevator operators… :-)

Lovely lovely lovely.  Good for families with small, tween and teenagers.  Good for business trips.  Not so much a hangout for the 20-something set, maybe not even the taste of the childless 30-something set.",5,2014,09,02
150,"Perfect location, great London hotel.","Love staying here when on business in London. The location is excellent for quick shopping in Selfridges to stock up on latest London fashion and it near to some great restaurants in Marylebone. Also perfect for running in Hyde Park. The service is good, the rooms are good for London hotels and the restaurant off the lobby area serves a great breakfast. My one gripe would be a simple one....the door men could be more focused and less chatting. I suppose I am spoilt in Asia but they really could do a better job here.",4,2014,08,31
150,Not bad at all.,"Stayed here last weekend for just 1 night. Got a great deal for the room from the net - certainly not worth the ridiculous list price - we found it for 50% off - and got breakfast in too!
Perfect Location, Great sleep, clean rooms, helpful, polite and English speaking staff - novel for London! Decor was a little old fashioned for us.
Shower was awful - over the bath and not high enough to stand under if you are taller than 5""8.
Wasn't sure whether to award 3 or 4 out of 5, but the awesome breakfast (included in my internet deal) pushed it up for me.
Would stay here again with the same deal.",4,2014,08,27
150,"Extremely good without the ""wow"" factor at the price","We stayed at The Churchill after a friend's wedding there. The rooms are nice and relatively large by London standards. The common areas are charming and we'll decorated, the staff are helpful and polite, the location good and the wifi actually works! A minor problem is that there really aren't enough lifts for what is a very large hotel. 

Ultimately The Churchill is a solid choice in Central London but lacks any ""wow"" factor- something I view as essential at the price point they are targeting.",4,2014,08,23
150,"Not the best Hyatt experience, but good nonetheless.","The Hyatt Churchill room is, not the typically contemporary Hyatt room you might expect. It is rather dated and smallish, but it is clean, functional and the beds comfortable. My husband and I had a connecting room with our 2 teenage girls. If you average it out the service was good as there were certain members of the staff that exceeded expectations and a few that fell beneath. It was summer and the hotel was full; there seemed to be daily events at the seminar rooms; that added with the non-hotel guests who came to dine or meet guests gave the place a thoroughfare feel which some might find unappealing. Check-in and check-out counters were almost always crowded. But once you enter the lift and up to your rooms, you begin to relax as access is limited to guests and it is quiet.

Location was fantastic. As a Muslim, halal food could abundantly be found in the immediate vicinity. There were also tonnes of other restaurants with all kinds of cuisines. Food was however, in general, rather expensive. Catching the bus/tube was easy. Shopping was amazing! 

While I have been to better Hyatts, this one did not fail me. For its location, functionality and comfy beds, I would go back.",4,2014,08,19
150,Superb location,Great location near Oxford Street. Walking distance to the nearest tube station. Close to shops and a variety of restaurants. Great and convenient location to explore London. A big chain hotel with high traffic so there is some wear and tear in the rooms. Don't expect personal service. Overall a pleasant stay especially if you are out exploring London.,4,2014,08,19
150,Not 5 star,"The rooms are not five star. 
I booked a night using my points and felt somewhat belittled by the reception staff. 
When I originally.booked a night, I asked for a king sized bed as I was taking my mother up to town for a treat. I was unable to get a king size bed but was told that a queen sized room was the same size. This was not true. I has intended to sleep on a roll away so my mother could sleep in the bed but there was no room. I had also been told that I could get an upgrade as I have platinum status with the Hyatt. Again this was not true.. Only the Diamond level card holders are allowed to request the upgrades. I don't like being lied to....
I regret using my points for a very basic small room. 
The hotel itself is in an excellent location. They are not generous with the towels, only putting one large and one hand in each room. 
Room we were given had very grotty view. 
So disappointed, should have gone to the Hyatt Palm Springs..

150,First day in London - Bad experience from lodging,"It was our family first time visited London, such a shiny warm summer day. However, when we got to our hotel - Hyatt at Churchill, not feeling so warm anymore. We were told it is the UK policy that there cannot be more than three persons stay in one room. Of course, we are a family of four which including my 10 and 7 years old children. 

After showing them my exchanged email with them about months ago while I was searching for a London hotel, which agreed, in the email, they would add an extra bed in our room, the snobbish representative told us, 'We meant three people.' And that's it. The only option they left to us was booking another two nights stay paying their hefty full price. 

I started to question their statement about UK law that can't permit more than three people stay in one room, and showed them my other emails with another hotel while I was searching, which in the email that hotel stated clearly they can arrange four people staying in one room. The walked over 'Manager' changed her wording by saying, oh...it is our hotel rule....

In one sentence to the potential travelers, if you have a stardard size of family of four, stay away from this hotel unless you'd like to pay the double price.",1,2014,08,14
150,Comfortable hotel with very little personality,"A luxury, 5 star hotel it's not. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and service is adequate. Location is great -- close enough to many major sights. The reception we recieved was efficient but cold, and everything about the service was unexceptional. No recognition of Hyatt Platinum status, and not a single thing to make the hotel memorable. Internet was very weak in the rooms -- unusable. For these hotel rates we expected a little more.",3,2014,08,13
150,Awesome!,"On a business trip we were put up in this hotel. And we had a good spacious room. 

Best part of this hotel was the location, just besides Marble arch station and very near to the Oxford Street which is shoppers paradise in London. 

From here Picadelli circus and Lester square is also near about 10 15 minutes walking distance which are hapenning areas of London main city. 

Having said that this hotel would be the best located hotel in the city. 

Typical 5 star in a very good location which would have good Resturants and fantastic breakfast spread. Where they gave u practically every option to choose and drink one can think of, from best of meats, egg varieties to cheese, juice to choose etc. 
Best was their chocolate chip muffins which I really loved. Basically you could not even taste entire spread even u tried hard to taste every thing on offer. Lol. That too on a breakfast.

This place being in perfect location is retailed at bit high price but it's all worth it as it's very comfortable and best option to choose to find the all the things in a city level 5 star category property in main central London. 

To sum up. Outstanding!!!!!!",5,2014,08,11
150,Always a superb stay and great staff!,"Not only is the Churchill walking distance to major shopping, the rooms are a great size and so comfortable. The FO staff, specially Vincent, was wonderful! Always great being greeted by Bobby and the staff at the door, who have been there soooo many years! Great food...and always a good stay!",4,2014,08,06
150,Wow,"This hotel is as advertised.  It is clean, the location couldn't be better and the service was wonderful.  The people there are so helpful, even at odd hours.  The location is 2 - 3 blocks away from Marble Arch and Oxford street shopping, and even Buckingham palace was walk-able (about 20 to 25 minutes).  The hotel is gorgeous and having Portman Square across the street provided lovely atmosphere.  Now, admittedly I didn't have a view of the square from my hotel room (by definition half the hotel doesn't - so don't get your hopes up unless you are paying through the teeth), but the piece of city I did view reminded me of Mary Poppins so I was fine. Piece of advice - look into the Hyatt Credit Card and earn rooms - including at this hotel - for free if you sign up for it.",5,2014,08,05
150,Very Enjoyable,"My wife and I took a long weekend to celebrate my 65th.  The staff was outstanding, very helpful at check in and the Concierge Desk booked our dinner reservations ahead of time the made changes as requested.  They also booked a guide and car for our last day for a city tour to hit some places we hadn't been able to get to yet.  The room was very nice, management sent up a bottle of Champagne and a birthday cake, every day we had a new plate of fresh fruit.  The location was very convenient.  Didn't spend much time in the lobby but it was nicely appointed.  Will definately stay there again.",5,2014,08,05
150,Just Fine,"A very nice hotel to stay, for business or pleasure.  The staff, including at check-in, are friendly and efficient.  Public areas - the lobby, restaurant and (especially) the bar - are superb in furnishing and ambience.  The rooms are modern, generously spaced (not just by London standards) and wifi service is good.  The easily accessible free computer with printer in the lobby is a nice touch.  No complaints at all.",4,2014,08,04
150,Fabulous again!,"Spent one night here for my birthday, stayed here 3 years ago for my sons 18th Birthday, was a lovely experience back then, but an even better one know, a cake and bottle of wine was presented to me, was overwhelming! and kind of the hotel staff, they were excellent in every way especially Nadine, who welcomed us on our arrival and escorted us to our room, lovely warm welcoming gesture.",5,2014,08,03
150,'Creative' room description and poor check in.,"I booked a room with a 'city or courtyard view' to get a room with the view of a solid brick wall!

On returning to reception I was told repeatedly that that was a courtyard view. I was offered the opportunity to pay for an upgrade or a smaller room than paid for. The manager twice declined to come out of their office to discuss the matter and I was finally allocated another room. 

That would have been great, had it not been for the two people who were already in that room when my key let me in, the lady in the room was to say the least somewhat surprised! 

Dirk Pohlers, Guest Services,  was good and did then resolve the matter. 

The third room had a good view of Portman Square, was of a good size but nothing spectacular. 

Maybe a 5 Star hotel, but in my opinion lacking the same level of 5 star integrity and service. ",3,2014,08,03
150,Fantastic Stay!,"We stayed here for 5 nights with our toddler and we had a wonderful time. The hotel staff are very friendly and kind. The location is absolutely fantastic and walking distance from the famous Hyde Park, Regent Park and Oxford street famous for its countless number of shops. We couldn't have asked for a better and more convenient location. The breakfast at the hotel is great and you can find all the basics of what you would look for in a breakfast buffet and the staff there are very friendly. Although they don't have a huge variety of things and they don't offer different choices on different days, it would have been nicer if they could offer a different variety of choices even on different days. The rooms were spotless and the housekeeping did an excellent job at keeping the room cleanliness at all times topnotch! We had a wonderful stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone at any time especially if you have children. Happy travels! ;)",5,2014,08,02
150,Not worth the price!,"Of course you expect hotels in central London to be expensive but I didn't feel The Churchill provided a good value.  We used points to book this property and since it's one of the highest redemptions that Hyatt offers, I expected it to be top notch.  Instead, we were given a room that was merely standard - something we would have expected from most any US airport/business hotel.  Nothing was wrong with our stay or the property but given the price point, I was expecting more.",3,2014,07,30
150,excellent stay,We stayed at the Hyatt from June 27 to July 1st and really enjoyed the hotel. Staff was very friendly and the location was great. We were abel to walk or take the tube all over London. Had dinner in the restaurant and it was great. Room was very comfortable . We would stay there again.,5,2014,07,30
150,Amazing stay,We recently stayed at the Churchill and had connecting rooms with the kids - the service is faultless and they are great with the Children. everything from checking in to checking out is handled with the top level of service. The hotels Churchill Bar has a great outside area and the Hotel is located close to Oxford Street and everything is within easy reach via the nearby tube station. Hard to beat.,5,2014,07,30
150,Great hotel with wonderful service!,"Love this hotel!  Staff is friendly!  They go out of their way to be nice!  Breakfast in the lounge is superb!  Room was lovely with a view of the park.  GREAT toiletries!!!!
Also many restaurants and cafés close by.  Would definitely stay here again without a doubt!!!!",5,2014,07,30
150,"nice hotel, well located, great bar","Loved the location of this hotel. Centrally located and walking distance to awesome shopping, museums, food or theater! We were there during fashion week so the place was loaded with young and beautiful people.  The churchill bar was amazing...sit outside and enjoy one of their custom cocktails and enjoy an awesome cigar.",4,2014,07,29
150,Top class,"This property was very nice even for a Hyatt Regency.  We stayed in a club room and enjoyed the very nice lounge on the 8th floor.  The hotel is a little costly, however for a property like this in central London, it is not bad value. We didnt eat in the hotel other than breakfast, but the location gives you options.  The staff were all very good - well done team Hyatt",4,2014,07,29
150,Club Level Rocks!,"A beautiful property with service to match.  The front desk takes extra care to make sure your needs are met.  Fabulous breakfast and cocktail hour.  In addition to comfortable, quiet rooms, the location of this Hyatt property can't be beat.  You're just a couple of blocks from incredible Oxford Street shopping and pass many neighborhood restaurants along the way.  Also, the Wallace Collection (not to be missed) is extremely close.  Marble Arch and several tube stations are nearby.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,29
150,Excellent Club level,"We stayed 3 nights at this great Hyatt property. We were on the Club level and the service was great.  The Club level actually has 2 sides: family ( meaning children) and adults.  We are traveling without our children and visited the adult side where the food and drink were plentiful from breakfast to Happy Hour.

The room was enjoyable and pleasant. Our view was to Portman Square across the front of the property. 

Hyde park is 2 blocks away from morning jogs and walks. The Tube Stop is only 2 blocks as well which makes this location perfect. Oh, and the Shopping is right there 2 blocks away as well: Oxford Street! Will visit again when in London.",5,2014,07,28
150,Great location but service is slipping,"Stayed here on a number of occasions and service in the bars is excellent and very friendly, concierge was very helpful as well but reception need a refresher on customer service.
Check in and our reservation could not be found then they could not see that we had pre paid!
We tried to get two more days the following week but the charges were far more than we had just paid for 4 days. Went on line and cheaper than the reception offered.
I was then told that they have no flexibility on pricing as if I had never stayed in a hotel before - quite patronizing.
The gym is small and no swimming pool.
Only three lifts and one broke on one day then all three stopped working, really in a 5 star hotel1
Overall - even though I am a Hyatt member (which they also missed) we will stay somewhere else next week.",4,2014,07,28
150,"Great location, great service","Stayed here with the family 1st week of July-1 bedroom executive suite.  

This was my first experience of a Hyatt property in Europe, and it was a pleasant surprise.  The location is excellent-Portland Square just behind Marble Arch.  

The staff at the Regency Club lounge reception were superb and very helpful, providing a full concierge service.  The Club lounge is divided into 2 separate rooms, one for families with young children and the other for business travelers, or those with older children.  

Housekeeping standards were exceptional and the rooms was impeccably cleaned each day., with full turn down service provided every evening.  Although the rooms are much smaller than those typically found elsewhere, (outside of London) the executive suite proved adequate for a couple with 1 child.  

Overall this is an excellent place to stay when travelling to London for either business or as a tourist.",5,2014,07,27
150,"Clean,comfortable and great location.",Stayed at the Churchill 4 nights on a Tauck Tour and couldn't have been more pleased. The breakfasts were great and so were the dinners.The room had the most comfortable pillows I have ever slept on. Many Landmarks were within walking distance. Shopping was also close by and so were many restaurants.,5,2014,07,26
150,"Great location, uncaring attitude with a smile","Well, not by everyone - only 3 of 8 doormen said hello each day and not one held a door open.  Went on hubby's business trip, so we didn't have to much choice.  Room was the size of a postage stamp for most of us.  We are both platinum members of the loyalty program, but it still didn't yield a room upgrade.  Private bar staff was nice, so I guess if you're going to have friends that would be he place.  This is my 5th time to the hotel and it's only gotten chillier.  The best bar, ""The Churchill Bar"" was redone and is no longer he perfect mahagony walled library to enjoy a scotch in.  It added an outdoor patio, with a £25 pp minimum, which is nice but the street noise is sometimes over powerful.

The JW Marriott is up e block and is a far nicer hotel.  It is bigger, but most of us agreed that is where we would rather have been.",3,2014,07,24
150,"The ""Standard"" Room was Perfect.","As we were traveling using Gold Passport points, we were assigned a standard room on the 4th floor.  The room was small, but the amenities were perfect.  Our view overlooked a roof top which wasn't great, but couldn't complain as everything else was satisfactory.  The room was clean, fresh and the temperature was very comfortable.  Since the Regency Club was booked up, we opted to pay a per diem for the use of the club (the cost, converted to American dollars was not cheap!!!) However, having been to Hyatt hotels and Regency Clubs around the world, I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the nicest and well managed Club I have ever been to.  The staff was second to none.  The food and drinks were outstanding and the lemonade and ice teas served in the evening were out of this world. Chu, who worked in the club in the morning, always greeted us as if we were the most important guests in the hotel.  As we were traveling with a child, the use of the Club was paramount and we were not disappointed.  As our child cannot drink dairy, they fulfilled our request to provide Rice Milk whenever we were there.  I cannot say enough about the Club and the fabulous staff!
The location of the hotel was very centralized (on the West end) and close to Oxford St. which is known for their shopping.  Although I am not a fan of big chain stores, others may love it.  Marble Arch is walking distance and one can catch the tube effortlessly.  It is also very close to Hyde Park where the summer concerts take place on the weekends.
Prior to my stay, I corresponded, via email, with the concierge staff as I wanted to plan our visit before arriving.  They always responded to my questions in a professional and timely manner.  However, I found that once I arrived and wanted to book tours and shopping, they weren't quite as knowledgable as I had hoped. Luckily, I found that Andrew, on the 8th floor (Club floor) was my go-to person as he really had all the answers. 
Thank you, Hyatt Churchill for your hospitality.",5,2014,07,21
150,Bland corporate hotel in a good location,"Stayed for a couple of days in June 2014.  Room are comfortable and quiet (good beds and bathrooms), but decor is very bland and very corporate.  Main problem was that my room had an odd smell upon arrival - onions.  I honestly think someone was cooking in their room - there are a lot of people from the Middle East that stay here.  Staff did what they could to mask odor, but it persisted.  An assistance manager followed up with an e-mail.  I sent a response with a list of several areas of concern, but there was no follow up to it.  Disappointed with the lack of follow up to it. 

Used Gold Passport points to pay for it, so got what it was worth.  Certainly would not pay asking price here given their attitude.  Quite frankly, give it a miss and go elsewhere unless it's free.  I intend to return to my usual Langham.",2,2014,07,21
150,Still a cut above the rest!,"A second stay for our family and it didn't disappoint. The staff are faultless and polite, the service and facilities in the Club Lounge amazing and the rooms look like they have never been used by another human being - spotless. Would highly recommend.
Baring in mind we stayed on the hotest day of the year with official temperatures in the city up to 32 degrees, the room air conditioning was fantastic and very precise.",5,2014,07,19
150,Tauck tour hotel,"Spent 4 nights as part of a tour.  Very nice place and in an excellent location, only steps from shopping.  First night was in a regular room.  Small, but obviously updated and clean.  Rest of the time was in a suite.  Big comfy bed, big bathroom and large living area with a pull out bed.  Breakfasted in the 8th floor lounge with good service.  Only complaint would be no change of any items on the menu:  the same every day we were there.

Quiet location, helpful and courteous staff, and seamless service.",5,2014,07,18
150,AWESOME AWESOME HOTEL,"I am a massive fan of the Hyatt chain and this is certainly no exception. Was here on my honeymoon, wonderful Lee in the Club area was fantastic and my new wife had a great time especially after we were upgraded. Very impressed with the service, it was even better than I remembered and I would more than recommend this place to anyone visiting london, The location is fab.",5,2014,07,17
150,Excellent hotel Experience,"This hotel is superb. Staff are incredibly helpful. The rooms are perfectly cleaned daily and there is great attention to detail. Rooms aren't huge, but are well laid out. It is worthwhile to splurge for the  Regency club  floors 7-9, as it really adds to the experience. Hotel is just off Oxford street, thus away from the crowds, but very accessible. Classed as London's west end, near Hyde Park.",5,2014,07,12
150,Good Hotel room view was limited!,"We stayed here as part of a late mystrey hotel deal.

A great hotel Staff super and welcoming, did not eat in resturant so cannot comment but it looked super.

Clean and very tidy the gym was great and clean.

Hotel room was clean and usual size for london 5stars but the view on 4th floor was poor we overlooked the ventilation and coolers. luckly the glazing prevented any bad noise so ensure you upgrade if your after a room with a view!",4,2014,07,08
150,Best Hotel Stay Ever!,"This hotel is very well placed at marble arch perfect for a long shopping trip on oxford street, the staff are amazing the rooms are really comfortable, the concierge are really knowledable and helpful. I reccommend upgrading to Regency Club the bathroom ammenties are molton brown (real treat) and the lounge is perfect for nibbles and drinks before a show! It is fairly formal but when you pass celebrities it adds to the magic! Worth the extra money i'm already saving for my next visit.",5,2014,07,07
150,A Top Hotel,"In my view, Four Seasons Hotels are far and way the best properties in the cities in which they are located.  However, The Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill rivals the Four Seasons in London and while expensive is usually less expensive than the Four Seasons.  I have stayed at this property several times, the last being in late June 2014.  Service is outstanding and no matter the interval between stays the staff always remembers me.  The Regency Club is excellent - certainly better than most Regency Clubs at other Hyatts.  This is a hotel with a great location, comfortable and well equipped rooms (some can be on the small side), well maintained and an excellent staff.  If I had a complaint it would be that the fitness center is small and there is no spa, but this is a hotel I will return to time and again.",5,2014,07,03
150,Maybe London is just really expensive,"This hotel was great and all, but for the price I expected better.   Truth be told I used free night awards, so I didn't actually pay anything, but still. This is supposed to be a very high end place, but I've stayed at many hotels that cost half the price that were ""better.""

I have no real complaints, to be honest, other than that checking in was a bit of a drag.  Our room wasn't available and the front desk people didn't seem to be too interested in getting my very young children into a room quickly.  She offered me an upgraded room immediately, if only I was willing to pay an extra $1500.  I thought she was making a joke, but she wasn't.  She told me to come back in an hour otherwise.  I came back in 30 minutes and she said the room still wasn't ready.  I came back 15 minutes later, and another guy made jokes about how I came back too soon, insinuating I was being impatient, which I was.  Anyways he did find a room, so I guess I waited long enough!

The people were nice. The room wasn't big, but it was adequate and clean.  We didn't eat at the restaurant.  The concierge let us into the private park outside.  The location is pretty good.  There are some nice places to go nearby, such as the Wallace House and quite a few Parks.  We walked to the London Eye and Buckingham Palace, although some people might have thought the walk was too much.",4,2014,07,01
150,An Outstanding Hotel in a Great Location,"Our last stay 2 years ago was wonderful. This one was as well.  Again we stayed in a suite with a terrace overlooking Portman Square park. It's not overly large, but is two rooms separated by a louvered door. The service is exceptional at every point of contact. They can't do enough for you. Our only slight disappointment was with the Regency Club where the evening appetizer offerings seemed meager and they had no dry vermouth for a Martini.  

The hotel is in a great location, with the Marble Arch tube station and bus stops being only 3 short blocks away.  A number of very good pubs for dinner are located within a few blocks walk.",5,2014,07,01
150,Enjoyed our Stay!!!,"Great location, comfortable stay, nice service... Couldn't ask for more! It was really convenient for my husband and I that the room offered us two spots for getting ready. We enjoyed the perks of the ""Club"" level and the service that was offered in the club level each morning and night at breakfast and ""happy hour"". Highly recommend!",5,2014,06,30
150,"Nice Hotel, Great Location, Exceptional Service","We stayed at the Churchill for four nights in late June 2014. The rooms were well appointed but not over the top. It is difficult to maneuver with an extra bed for children in the small rooms, but that is London! Bathrooms were oddly configured with half doors to shower stalls that resulted in dousing the floor with each shower.  On the positive side, as Diamond status members, we took advantage of the Regency Club for ample and tasty breakfasts and generous canapé hours. Service there was attentive and discrete.  The concierge service was very helpful and efficient, helping plan a trip to Windsor on short notice and printing boarding passes when our stay was up.
Kids got into the mini bar, resulting in a $40 charge for 2 sodas, but that was a result of jet lagged parenting, not the Churchill.  Overall a delightful stay in London, and one I'd love to repeat.",4,2014,06,28
150,Friendly service and delicious breakfast,"Stayed here one night through work and the staff were great from the outset. Everybody says hello and some even asked how my stay was when in the lift or corridor. The room was clean and spacious but would have been nice to have had some tea or coffee making facilities but that's the only minor point. Breakfast was just excellent. Vast range of food choices, coffee served at your table. Bar area comfortable but drinks very expensive. All in all a good stay.",4,2014,06,28
150,"Pleasant hotel, good location","Nice hotel, very well located as you can easily walk to the main shopping streets. The restaurant is really excellent. The tea-time is also very tasty and cheaper than at the Ritz! 

The Sunday brunch is really great but make sure you arrive early as it can be quite full.

I went to this hotel several times and always happy to go back. The rooms are pleasant.

The only thing that I would love to find there is a swimming-pool. 

If you book there, try to get the square view, nicer than the roofs on the other side.

The suites are big and nice with great and trendy art decoration.",5,2014,06,27
150,Very Nice But Not Exceptional,"Stayed here for five nights in June 2014.  The room was well appointed, but not lux.  Staff did a good job, although after arriving at 10:30 AM we did not get a room until after 2:30; after a third appeal to the front desk.  We may have experienced a downgrade in order to accomplish that.
This is an excellent hotel in most respects; the concierge was most helpful on several occasions, and breakfast buffet was expansive.
Location was close to Oxford Street, an easy walk to Hyde Park, and we made it to Buckingham Palace in about a 30 minute walk.",4,2014,06,25
150,First Class,"The hotel is strategically located at Portman Quare and very near Bond Street. you can't ask fir a better location. easy access to shops and restaurant and yet not actually on a crowded area.

Hotel service is nice. the only complaint us the room is a bit oytdated.

Other than that, this is a very excellent hotel",5,2014,06,24
150,Expected more,"Went to London on a Tauck  tour and was very disappointed with our hotel the Churchill .The hotel we stayed at on the tour in Paris was wonderful, so I was able to compare.The Hotel was small,the rooms average ,the bathroom very average, and the service also very average. There was only one small restaurant which was understaffed. The location of the hotel was also very out of the way and boring",3,2014,06,22
150,Great stay and prime location in London,"My husband and I stayed at the Churchill for 5 days in June 2014 and overall, the experience was excellent.  The staff allowed us to check in early (after a long Transatlantic flight), addressed our every need and made sure we were comfortable.  The rooms are clean, spacious and full attended twice per day. Make sure to visit the Monocle (the bar dedicated solely to Winston Churchill) that is part of the hotel--the drinks are great and the staff will not disappoint.  The hotel itself is also in a prime location near Mayfair in London.  If you take a hop on-hop off tour, there is literally a stop to pick up the bus less than a block away.  You will not be sorry if you stay at The Churchill--wonderful all around!",5,2014,06,22
150,"A lovely hotel, a difficult location","We stayed here for two nights and were happily upgraded to a Club room, which offered a spacious room, though a view over a rather post-war commercial London. The breakfast each morning was delicious, and the service swift and attentive. As we were on our honeymoon, a welcome bottle of champagne and a tastefully appointed chocolate dessert were most appreciated!

While the hotel was a quick cab from Paddington where we arrived via the Heathrow Express, it was not in easy walking distance to many of the places we had hoped to go - we found nearby Oxford Street incredibly busy and difficult to navigate through the crowds, even on a weekday morning as we headed to the British museum. Due to its location away from St Paul's (where we attended a magnificent Evensong), we were unable to take advantage of the complimentary cocktail hour on the club floor. Upon return, we'll certainly chart out better paths through the area and take advantage of the lovely concierge services in the pristine lobby.",4,2014,06,22
150,Excellent Hotel & Staff,"Enjoyed our visit to London and our stay at the Hyatt Regency this month.  We arrived from the US early in the morning (before 10 am)  and the staff let us check in which was nice so we didn't have to store our bags until our room was ready. The conceirge was very helpful for directions as this was our first visit. Hotel was near Hyde Park and most of what we wanted to see was close. Not too far from the Tube- Marble Arch station,  but not as convenient as other hotels. Our room was very clean, not real fancy for the price but it is London and we got a great deal on it. Didn't eat in the restaurant but had drinks in the bar - my husband said it was the best Vodka Tonic he ever had and I enjoyed my first Pisco Sour.",5,2014,06,20
150,lovely hotel,very lovely hotel with great staffs. I really enjoyed my stay and was nice it was close to the shopping malls as well. the staffs are always full of smiles which obviously made u feel alot more comfortable.,4,2014,06,20
150,comfy bar area,"popped in for an afternoon drink, a piano player was playing softly in the corner of the area, Patrick offered excellent service, was very friendly and served drinks quickly, very comfy relaxing area to sit and enjoy drinks and music.",4,2014,06,18
150,Wonderful stay-- we will definitely return!,"My husband is a Hyatt diamond and we stayed here in April to celebrate his birthday.  We used a suite upgrade but her then upgraded again to a beautiful corner suite with a beautiful separate bedroom and additional powder room.  A birthday cake and bottle of champs chilled on ice was waiting for us when we arrived.  We had 7 friends over at the room before dinner to celebrate and everyone could sit comfortably.  The club level is has 2 sections which are completely separate.  They have identical offerings but one is for families and one is quieter and is for business people or adults without kids.  We had a wonderful breakfast each morning with several hot and cold selections.  The location is perfect-- we walked to Oxford. St. and borrowed one of their giant umbrellas which kept us dry during the rain.
The staff are welcoming, professional, and courteous.  We loved everything about our stay and will certainly be back.
Tip: request a room with a view of Portman square.  Try the Sunday evening prix fixe meal at the main restaurant.  
The outdoor cocktail lounge had the warmest blankets and heaters to keep us toasty while my husband enjoyed a special cigar.",5,2014,06,16
150,Big can hardly be good.....?,"Great location in front of a park not to far from Marble Arch. Paid 432 Pounds for one night which did  not give the value expected. Got a very small room on the executive floor-clean but nothings special . Breakfast in lounge nothing to write home about and they charged me an extra 25 Pounds for my nephew´s breakfast. Could be more generous with that room price.
More of a mass market hotel with long waiting for the lift to arrive.
Will try a more personal place next time",3,2014,06,16
150,Great location but.... very poor value for money,"We ended up staying here for 1 night because a conference was being held here. 

I normally stay at Hiltons and spend over 70 nights per year in generally Hilton properties.

The overnight rate for the 1 night excluding breakfast was stg£ 340. 

I would stay here again but would not (given what is available elsewhere in London in similar central locations) offer to pay more than say stg£180.

Our room (room no 40x) was in the close to the Lift on the 4th floor and was certainly not suitable for more than 1 person. It was very small and with a few cases of luggage, we were very cramped.

We ordered room service which as very good (arrived promptly and was well presented) but the server could not get the tray table to the other side of the room, such was the tiny gap between the bed and the cupboard.

Anything more than Stg£180 per night and this hotel is way off the mark. 

Also all the staff we met had English as a 2nd or third language.

I had an issue at breakfast where the main orders were forgotton and arrived 40 mins later. IN fairness to the staff, they recognised the problem, and wrote off the bill without having to be asked.",2,2014,06,15
150,Excellent service and well located,"Pros
Location - right near Selfridges with an abundance of high quality restuarants and grocery stores to choose from
Lounge - Lounge is spacious and divided into a family and non-family section. Evening cocktails are great
Recognition for Hyatt status - I manage to have late check out and early check in no problem
Rooms - Rooms are nice, has a new look and is comfortable
Transport - There are Boris bike stations just a short walk outside and tubes are close

Cons 
Gym could have had a better free weight section. Thankfully there was a fitness first around the corner on Baker street that I frequented
TV - there were not many selection of channels",5,2014,06,15
150,Good hotel near the Oxford street and Paddington,"Upscale Hyatt with great service conveniently located near Oxford street and Paddington. The rooms are rather small, but the bed was comfortable. The rooms are designed in an old fashion style, this is not your typical Hyatt design. It has good restaurant at the lobby level.",4,2014,06,14
150,Good experience,"The staff at the hotel is amazing, and both the location and the rooms are very good. Located near Hyde Park and Marble Arch underground station so you are close to everything. The rooms are very nice and the bed is really good. WIFI is limited bandwidth unless you pay extra but unless you are streaming video it's fast enough. Weekend breakfast is expensive but very, very good!",4,2014,06,14
150,What a wonderful Place to eat....The Montague Restaurant,"We had two meals here and each one was amazingly good. The first one was an evening meal with friends; kindly their treat so no idea of the cost.
The second one was Sunday Brunch. We seemed to have endless champagne. Good job we were walking home! The standard of the selection of foods was excellent and so was the service. If I won millions on the Lottery, I would live in this hotel!",5,2014,06,13
150,The best hotel in Town,"I am a regular visitor and I greatly recommend this hotel. It is only two minutes walking distance from the oxford street. As most of the times I am a solo traveller in London, the security is at a high level and the staff really friendly. However, the cherry on the cake is the breakfast! I worth-visiting five star hotel in the heart of the city!",5,2014,06,09
150,When in London,"The London Churchill hotel is in a great part of London, close to many attractions as well as Paddington train station. It is an upscale Hyatt property that is very pleasant and the service is fantastic! The one thing that really drew my attention was a portrait of the Queen behind the front desk - she had her eyes closed! I don't know if that was a Royal sanctioned portrait or not but it was very interesting.",5,2014,06,09
150,Good service but no longer up-to-date,"The hotel tries to impress with a very proactive service, staff very well trained, but the rooms demonstrate what is wrong with the old style chain hotels that still want to charge top dollars for your stay. The room I had was big enough but the closet space is small and there was no room for my folded shirts anywhere. I had to put them on top of the biggest piece of furniture, which is the minibar (not sure how many people really use those, not me). The safe inside the closet was built in sideways so that it was impossible to read the instructions on the door (too dark inside the closet). The provide a flashlight but unfortunately in my case it didn't work. Bathroom: do we still have to stand up in a bathtub to take a shower? In a luxury hotel?
Gladly they offer a handheld soft shower head, so flooding can be avoided. The room was smelling a little stuffy, had the window open all the time.",3,2014,06,08
150,Great staff and very good location,"I had two club rooms for two nights, and found the check-in process to be extremely friendly but a bit chaotic.  I had to go to the 8th floor to check-in, where you're then seated and walked through the paperwork.  I was worried about my bags, so then had to go back down to the ground floor to check on them.  I'm just wondering if it wouldn't be easier to have the ""private check-in"" on the ground floor.  There are two lounges, but I found them to be very crowded (just as with airline lounges, you want to get away from the noise), and the quality of the snacks was lacking.  For breakfast in the lounge, the selection of cereals was limited compared to other hotels in London.  However, the rooms were bright, airy, and extremely clean.  The bathroom products from Molton Brown are wonderful, but the bathroom itself is dated (tub instead of shower, and chipped paint in some places).

The concierge desk deserves special praise because they were extremely helpful (for example, I needed a large box and they brought several out within minutes!  They were still too small so they directed me to a nearby shop).  

Overall, I would stay here again because of the excellent staff and location (close to Hyde Park and the major shopping areas).  It's a quite area next to a park, but close enough to major tube stops, restaurants, and shopping.",4,2014,06,05
150,Smart & Efficient London Hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights in May attending a conference. The Hotel has an excellent location for shopaholics and is very comfortable, smart and efficient for business travelers. 
Reception staff very hospitable and concierge are top quality. Bedrooms are good size and well equipped and the Regency Club lounge on the 8th Floor is very useful for a quick breakfast.",5,2014,06,05
150,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights. The location was good and quiet, close to shopping but not too many restaurants close by. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Rooms were sort of generic without much personality but very comfortable. The concierge desk could not have been better. They were extremely helpful and always courteous to everyone. Elevators were always prompt. Take the time to visit the amazing bar for a drink. The bartenders are real pros and provide an amazing experience.",4,2014,06,04
150,Basic Hyatt...served business needs,"Stayed 4 nights on business trip to London.  Nothing particularly special about this property.  Not in an especially ""touristy"" area...so, not a lot of restaurants nearby.  Staff were very courteous and helpful, especially in the Regency Club lounge.  I had booked the Club level for breakfast availability as well as a place to meet business colleagues for debriefing sessions after each days' set of meetings.  For this, it worked well.  Used the Club lounge extensively.  Also, the bedding in the room was outstanding...very comfortable...quiet, dark room -- perfect for sleeping.  Overall, the hotel gets a lot of use...and it is beginning to show it...it is beginning to look a little ragged.. Moreover, the hallways and public areas are quite dark (black wood trim)...which gives the place a ""not very cheery"" atmosphere.  It was not the hotel's fault, but at time the club lounge was taken over by groups of loud and noisy guests...who seemed unaware of proper behavior in a lounge environment.  At these times, I just left the lounge and came back after they had left.  The price was high -- isn't everywhere in London?  But the breakfast, evening snacks and use of the lounge for business meetings almost made the price a good value.",3,2014,06,03
150,"Amazing staff, central location","Stayed 1 night to explore london during a brief intermission between two other trips. This was my first trip to London, and I went with no plan other than the hotel choice. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. They set me up with maps, very well thought out recommendations and genuinely took the time to find out more about me before make them.

Staff in the hotel in terms of my room, any requests I had, even the door staff were above par and made the experience very pleasant. The room itself was very nice, and for London from what I've seen, VERY roomy in comparison. 

Location was incredible as well. As a tourist I enjoyed starting my morning by walking around the corner to Hyde Park in london, and being less than 2 minutes walk from the Marble Arch stop to hop on the tubes. Oxford street was fun, but definitely tourist shopping trap so I really didn't spend time on that particular strip of road. 

Overall, I felt like location alone made this a fantastic choice, but the staff made it a homerun. Looking forward to my next stay at the property.",5,2014,06,02
150,In total average,"I had the opportunity to stay at the hyatt for two nights during my visit in london.
On arrival the doorman greets you and a lot of staff is available for your assitance. Check in was warm and friendly and the lobby is nice decorated with a lively touch. Front of house staff was great!
When i arrived at the room my first thought was that it was a little dated. The courtyard view is nothing special and quite dark. The furntiure needs to be renewed to stay up to date. 

We visited the hotelbar because it has a stylish interior. Unfortunately ALL the bartenders are not able to smile! It was on both days the same: They do a technical good service but without any warm and welcoming touch. There was just one woman who had a good attitude. Maybe the guys need some days off to get alive again...
In total the stay was average compared to other hotels in London.",3,2014,06,01
150,Doing their best with a mediocre location.,"Situated in a 70's East European styled mid rise (9 floors) the rooms are very well appointed but not attractive unless you like bland furniture in grey and off beige. 

However the standard of comfort and amenities are unmistakably Hyatt and service is exceptional. The mattresses are exceptionally comfortable as are the down pillows and duvets and Molton Brown amenities. Housekeeping is ever present but so is the noise of slamming doors courtesy of fire regulations and doors that close with a vengeance. 

Regency members have their own floors (7-9) and the hotel hosts and exceptional breakfast and evening cocktails by any Hyatt standard.  

The lobby is still a throw back to the 80's - where oil deals would be contemplated but perhaps never consummated.  A very busy thoroughfare. 

The hotel has an exceptional restaurant called the Montague but la Locanda Locatelli - a one star Michelin is definitely a falling star.  ",4,2014,05,31
150,Still hits the mark.,"My second visit here, both times on Hyatt points. Large rooms, comfortable bed, huge towels (thanks for that!) and swell people-watching. Umbrellas offered upon leaving the hotel when it was raining, a proper touch. But particular kudos to the concierge staff who helped me wrangle an uncooperative and allegedly global-ready smartphone - ended up calling in three staffers to untangle things. if you want to avoid the chaos of Oxford Street, walk down Wigmore Street parallel to it, for a different route. A couple of blocks from the almost-overwhelming Wallace Collection with a nice courtyard for breakfast, lunch or tea (no admission fee). And if you like Indian food, go to Roti Chai on Portman Mews South.",5,2014,05,31
150,"Great location, very comfortable, and competitive rates","We've stayed here twice, 9 nights in April 2013 and 6 nights this May.  The location really cannot be beat. It is central to everything. As some have mentioned the Club lounge does not offer a full buffet breakfast, but it is a step above a Continental breakfast, with 2 hot egg dishes - scrambled and a daily-changing poached egg dish with Hollandaise sauce. The offerings in the evening would also be described as ""nice"" rather than ""great"". But the lounge is very comfortable, and the lounge service is great. And for both of our stays we found very competitive rates by booking well in advance. The rates were significantly lower than some other major chain hotels with smaller rooms and locations far from the centre. We would definitely recommend the Churchill to anyone as long as the rate is reasonable (it can get very high as the hotel fills us), and this would most certainly be our first choice the next time we return to London.",5,2014,05,31
150,Eexcellent hotel situated in a very central location,"The Churchill is an excellent hotel situated in a very central location. The rooms were very spacious and tidy, with good amenities, especially considering the hotel is in the middle of London. The buffet breakfast was top quality too. The service was very good as well. This is a family friendly place.

Located close to Portman square, Marble Arch and Bond street,  and very close to the tube stations/bus stops and tourist destinations. Walkable to many places as well, including Oxford circus. The best (and cheapest) way to see London around is using the tube and the buses, just get the one-day pass or the week pass if u r there longer, this can be used for both the bus and the tube. Rt-15 in particular is excellent route to see the best part of the city and you can board it very close from the hotel area, you can see the best parts of the city on it. It goes thro Oxford Circus (Regent Street)-Piccadilly Circus-Trafalgar Square-Fleet Street-Tower of London. You can use it like a hop-on/hop-off bus as it keeps coming every 5-10 mins.",5,2014,05,30
150,Nice room.   Great Location.   Great bar.,"Spent a week at the Churchill Hyatt.   Stayed on the club level and the service there was excellent.   The room was large and very comfortable.     Great home base location to explore London by foot and tube.    The Churchill bar in the hotel was excellent and open late - well after the rest of the area was closed.    Very nice outside area for sitting, drinking and having a nice Cigar.   I would recommend this for anyone wanting a 1st class location and property to enjoy London.",5,2014,05,29
150,Nice Room,Nice hotel in a nice part of the city.  Marble Arch station is a few blocks away.  Room was clean and a nice size.  We were originally supposed to get two twin beds but that room was not available.  Instead we got a queen bed with a roll away cot which was still comfortable.  The only thing I wish they would have had was free wifi.,5,2014,05,29
150,Great Hotel,"Great service with large rooms and a front of the house staff that goes out of their way to make you feel at home. The clientele is a mix of business types and tourists. There are many Arabic guests including rich young guys from the Gulf states sporting raggedy blue jeans and driving Maserati's and Lamborghini's. A bit of advice, though. If you're a Western women put off by the site of other women wearing full body burquas, this may not be the place for you.",4,2014,05,28
150,Could have been better,"We stayed here in May 2014 and had a club king room. The style was nice, but it was obvious that things in the room and around the hotel were aging. Particularly, the bathroom door of my room was painted over a few times and the paint was flaking off of it. Also, the club lounge had numerous paintings with varnish chipped off the frames and such. My room had a chair with a cut on the front of the cushion as well. The bed wasn't the Hyatt Grand Bed, or at least didn't feel like the one we slept on at the Grand Hyatt in Berlin.

The club lounge didn't have much compared to other lounges I've seen (not in Hyatt properties). There were two kinds of candy in a jar and some sort of baked thing such as cookies, and two types of fruit. There was beer and limited soft drinks in the fridge, but no authentic British ale available in the lounge which was a shame. Other lounges I've seen have had wine available at all times, as well as various types of nuts snacks. However, from 5:30 to 7:30 PM, there were mini cocktails and wine as well was light food available.

For breakfast, I was a bit disappointed that there were no types of hot meat available, just cold cuts. I was really hoping to find some bacon or sausage for the price of the breakfast. It just felt like something was missing compared to nice breakfast buffets I've had such as at the  Hilton at the Paris airport which had ""the works"".

Overall, it was an okay hotel. The first ""Regency"" Hyatt I've stayed at, but it pales in comparison to other hotels in the chain.",3,2014,05,28
150,Lovely hotel- great location,"This top of the line Hyatt provides outstanding service, lovely accommodations and outstanding location. Restaurants, pubs and wine bars are within walking distance. Knowledgeable staff always ready to help. Rooms are very quiet. Love the Churchill Bar.  ",5,2014,05,28
150,Great Room and Facilities,Stayed here for a business trip to London.  Easy to get to from Heathrow via the express train and then a short taxi ride.  Very attentive staff - service was very good.  Hotel very modern and well kept.  Meeting rooms for business are excellent.  Great restaurants on site or within waking distance.  Will repeat.,4,2014,05,28
150,Why do I have to be a number?,"Last time I was here it was 1984... my first ever visit to a world class hotel. 

Back in those days everyone had a name. .. 

Sadly, we live in a world where there is more technology than ever before and yet the first words one hears in the morning is: what's your room number sir?
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Can't we get beyond this? 
Making customers feel like villains before they enter the restaurant because they MUST  give a room number... awful.  I want to be a person, not a number.
Sadly the host was unable to step out of his institutionalized thinking and accept my name and figure out the room from the computer.. shame really.

When checking in I had to give my credit card too.  Terrible. 
Why don't you do that when the booking is made? It will save going through that while awful script at the front desk. .. It's cheap.

Otherwise nice hotel.  Cigar Bar is a must",4,2014,05,27
150,Business stay in Hyatt R Churchill,"I visit this hotel in regular intervals, 3-4 times every year . The popularity of the hotel has been increasing - particularly among Asian and Arabic guests; and it is becoming extremely busy place. Location , overall quality are great for London standards, restaurant has great food- good selection of breakfast - 30-32 GBP incl service added with no questions- however very noisy- thee seems to be a sound isolation issue where it gets disturbingly noisy . If your room is facing back side, you need to make sure you are higher than 3rd floor, otherwise you may be faced with a unpleasant ""roof view"".  Front facing rooms have nice Portman sq. park view; do not expect much from club rooms- food and drinks are limited/ and for limited time of the day.
Gym is small but decent , with new Equipment, basic terrace facing view.",3,2014,05,25
150,"Great location, nice hotel, but big and impersonal","The best points of this hotel are: location, restaurants on-site, and the executive lounge. Food is so expensive in London that having access to breakfast and canapes and drinks for dinner can save a lot of money. As a Hyatt Diamond access was free, but it might be worth it to pay. Overall it's a nice place, but very busy and not a place where you ever feel there's a personalized level of service, with the exception being the lounge staff, which were great.",4,2014,05,21
150,Superb!,"We stayed here for a night prior to travelling on the Orient Express to Venice and I must say we couldn't have chosen a better hotel to get us in the mood. Excellent service, happy staff, comfortable room, perfect location. A teapot cocktail in the bar is a must!!",5,2014,05,21
150,"Hyatt Churchill Hotel, London","Absolutely lovely hotel.  The staff were really excellent.  The breakfast was great.   Fabulous location, we could walk right into the centre of London without having to use any transport.  The room was nice and cool, and the bathroom was spotless.",5,2014,05,19
150,Wonderful!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency London for 3 nights last year. We had an absolutely wonderful experience and thoroughly enjoyed this superb hotel!
We were upgraded to include the Regency Club lounge which was very much appreciated after a long day of sightseeing. The concierge were very helpful in providing multiple options for pubs and restaurants. The first night we were told to try the Grazing Goat which is a few blocks away and it turned out to be one of our favorite meals while in London! 
This hotel's location is perfect, and in my favorite part of London. We could easily walk to many of the top attractions and enjoyed wandering through the beautiful streets that surround the Churchill.
We will most definitely be back!",5,2014,05,17
150,Wonderful Experience,We arrived mid morning from an all night flight not expecting our room to be ready.  It was such a pleasant surprise to find our room was ready.  Right from that point on our experience from the front desk to the dining room was excellent.  The food in the dining room was delicious.  The breakfast super.  You couldn't  have a better location....just a block and a half off Oxford street.  Our room had a lovely view of the park.   We highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,05,14
150,A perfect week,"I stayed at the Hyatt Churchill with my boyfriend for 3 nights. We were staying on the club level and had a part of the presidential suite. It was simply amazing. The service was great, the room was absolutely wonderful and the hotel is gorgeous. The food on the club level is great, you always find something to eat and people to meet. 
We also enjoyed an evening at the terrace outside. A friendly staff was present during all night.
I could only recommend you to stay there not just for the location, but also for the great experience you will have there.",5,2014,05,14
150,Top Hotel in This Part of London,"Have stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions in 2013, planning on staying there in June 2014 as well.  This is the top hotel in this area of London, no doubt.

The area, much like the rest of London, is densely populated and crowded.  As an American, I wasn't ready to experience tiny hotel space (like formerly staying nearby at The Leonard).  This provided me a familiar alternative to the space issues.  The Churchill is a large property, with large rooms (for London).  

The staff is also extremely helpful, offering plenty of directions and advice.  

One downside, is the brunch/breakfast is tasty, although very expensive and in my opinion, not worth the price.

The location is also perfect for a long day of shopping near/on Bond and Oxford streets.",5,2014,05,13
150,My new go-to hotel in London,"Stayed here as a test for work and they won me over.  My mother joined me on my business trip and we shared a room with 2 Twins on the executive level.  As a business traveler I was happy and as a tourist she was happy, so it was a win-win.  The executive level offers 2 club rooms that serve breakfast in the morning as well as happy hour with hors d'œuvre in the evening.  WiFi works great.  Bathroom could use some updating but the room was spacious enough that we were not tripping over each other and she had her space and I had mine.  Room service was fantastic, we ordered every night!  Our room faced Portman Square and there was no issue with road noise at night, I slept very well.  I stayed at another hotel the next corner over as another test and it definitely did not live up to The Churchill.  This will be my go-to hotel when in London on business.  It's a quick walk to Marble Arch station.",4,2014,05,13
150,Look forward to returning!,Everything was super.  We loved our room and access to the Regency Club.  One of the nicest club set-ups I have seen at a Hyatt.  Staff was gracious and very welcoming.  First class accommodations with first class service.  Winning combination.,5,2014,05,12
150,Lovely Room; Great Location; Over-priced Food and Drinks,"The hotel has very spacious rooms, lobby, and even lifts, and our bags were delivered to our room while we were out exploring.  Nice touch.  Service was impeccable, as I'd expect from a hotel of this calibre.  The location is very convenient, so it's a fairly easy walk to pretty much everything in central London.  (We're in our 60s and had no trouble at all hoofing it to Trafalgar Square and beyond to pic London Passes.)  It's also close to Marble Arch station and several bus stops.  The décor is updated and we especially liked the comfy chair and ottoman, a great place to catch up on the news or social media updates.  The bed was excellent, and everything was spotless.  WiFi was free (for us; we're Hyatt platinum customers) and fast.  Our only complaint was noise from nearby rooms.  There's a gap under the door that seems to funnel every little sound right into the rooms.  We may have had particularly noisy neighbors.  But it was very noticeable both nights of our stay.  In summary: we were very happy with our room, save for the banging and voices, and all the service folks.

However, if you're looking for a reasonably priced breakfast or drinks, go out.  30 pounds for high tea!?!?!",4,2014,05,10
150,Great for bussiness traveller,"In a great location, a short walk to almost everything, The Churchill is a very good choice, although a bit expensive, for busy travelling bussiness men. Pleasant rooms, cordial stuff, good breakfast, decent boring bar, reasonably quite lobby - what else would you wish for in the heart of London?",4,2014,05,10
150,Quintessential London,"Admittedly we got lucky and found a bargain through Agoda at this well located London landmark Hotel. Despite arriving at 8am for a checkin, they were very obliging to and able to give us our room without any extra charges advising simply that there was availability of ready rooms. We found a similarly obliging attitude when we needed to have a late checkout and no additional charge requested. We made no use of hotel facilities preferring to spend our time on the London streets and also saved a packet eating breakfasts at nearby Pret a Mange's. The room was as expected of a very good standard and if we get this kind of deal again ie 220 quid against quoted rates of 300, we will definitely take this offer up. Room service was also quick.",5,2014,05,10
150,Great last minute deal,"Booked Churchill as a last minute ""top secret"" hotel over the bank holiday weekend. Staff very welcoming, room was of a good size and really comfortable. Room and bathroom clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.",4,2014,05,06
150,Typical Business Hotel,"Friendly staff but interior is dark and the small club packed, making it difficult to move even. Typical business hotel w frequently gatherings of men in suits in the lobby. It seems functions are actually held in the lobby, obstructing passage and entering the lifts. The large entrance door window and doors could be washed. Getting the door man to push the extremely heavy revolving door for you would be nice. it is just too heavy for anybody not a strong man and not worried about their clothes getting soiled or packages getting crushed.",3,2014,05,05
150,Afternoon of Bliss,This hotel was booked for me to spend as afternoon before a meeting. The sleep was pleasant and I found the amenities available fulfilling my needs. The staff were helpful and overall a good place to stay.,4,2014,05,05
150,First visit to London,"The Hyatt Regency is a excellent hotel from check-in, the rooms, Montague restaurant, and location. We walked to visit many sites from the Hyatt's location. The staff is friendly from morning to night and most helpful to first time visitors",5,2014,05,01
150,Luxury hotel that will go above and beyond,"Hotel staff went above and beyond with greeting us upon our arrival. They were very friendly and genuine. Also, front desk staff asked how our trip was and how we were doing. 

-Bell hop was prompt to bring our luggage to our room.
-Concierge provided advice on where to eat lunch.
-I ran out of water in the room and within 5 mins or less, someone was at the door to provide a replenishment.

Close to Marble arch, and shops :)

I highly recommend this place for friends, family, couples, etc.",5,2014,04,30
150,Pleasant stay,"Stayed there for one night and it is very close to main shopping area - the oxford street. The room is big enough for hotel room in london. While the staff are very tentative and friendly. They make you feel welcome.

The breakfast was great!",5,2014,04,28
150,Epic brunch!,"A weekend in London set in a super location for a bit of culture, fine dinning and of course shopping. Having been guests at the hyatt in different countries our expectations were high and fortunately all met. The service was top class and the brunch was just epic! ",5,2014,04,27
150,Generally not great,"There was nothing memorable or exciting about this hotel or indeed anything that stood out during our recent 6 night stay here. I regularly stay at Hyatt properties the world over for work, but this was a personal trip with my partner, the first stop on a three week vacation to various places in Europe. I have a lot of Hyatt Gold Passport points so I decided to save my dollars and use 150,000 of my hard earned points instead. Unfortunately I came away incredibly disappointed. We were in a standard room at the very end of a hallway (a location I loathe). When I first checked in I asked if I could upgrade by paying or using points and the person went away for a time, came back and said check back in later in the afternoon once all the rooms had been serviced. I called down at 3pm and was told no upgrades would be possible and the hotel was fully booked. I wish I was just told straight up that morning. 

Generally the hotel is a 5 star (understanding that hotels the world over commit to a common rating system whereby to be considered 5 star you must have certain things, ie: room service, a gym, etc.). But within the 5 star rating is a good deal of variation and hence why you see properties like this with a 5 star rating, but that are not in my view, of 5 star quality. There is nothing terribly bad or awful about this place, it's just very average. Nothing stood out and there was no point of differentiation. It looks nice on the surface (ie: the lobby area) but the rest of it I just found bland. People don't go out of their way to help. The room service food was incredibly poor (we ordered room service on our first morning as a bit of a treat, but never did again after that). 

I honestly would suggest you look for another property in the area that is smaller, more personable, but charging similar room rate. I would not stay here again.",2,2014,04,27
150,Perfect location.,"We spent Easter in the Hyatt and found it to be in the perfect location for all the sights the west end has to offer.
The room was nice with large screen tv. The bathroom a bit on the small side but with Molton Brown toiletries. The bed was very comfortable.
The staff are excellent, polite and courteous. The bar staff are attentive and efficient.
It is a pity the hotel does not have its own dedicated restaurant.
We would certainly use this hotel again.",5,2014,04,27
150,Great location,"Friendly service coupled with a strategic location close to the marble arch. Offers the English charm with modern amenities, with shops and public transport just around the corner. Rooms are cosy but the air conditioning could be better regulated. Tends to warm up during the night. Other than that, Would recommend and will return to stay. ",4,2014,04,26
150,Consistently high standards,"This was our 3rd visit and it did not disappoint.
I think one of the things which makes this hotel 5* is the quality and quantity of the staff on hand to help. We particularly found the bar staff very helpful and knowledgeable in helping us choose from the extensive cocktail menu. It's only a short stroll to Oxford street and the location makes it a great base. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped and I would recommend one facing Portman Square as the view is lovely. Definately a pleasure to stay here.",5,2014,04,24
150,Five star with elegance,"Despite it being a big hotel, with a host of international visitors and it's busy feel, the hotel is peaceful. With its spacious clean rooms and very comfortable beds sleep is heavenly. Quick, good service; fantastic location it being only a 2 minute walk to one of the busiest streets and areas in London CBD - namely Oxford Street and Marble Arch - there is a bliss to it giving the impression that is somewhere in the countryside. As a business hotel or a place to relax and enjoy the sights and sounds of London, I highly recommend it.",5,2014,04,24
150,Beautiful Hyatt!,"I stayed here for 3 days for a business trip and found this hotel to be absolutely beautiful. The rooms were spacious and there were lots of personal touches, including an afternoon snack on the day of check-in and nightly turndown service. 

The conference I attended allowed me to see the business side of the hotel and while the conference rooms were nice, they were very small (we had a crowd of about 110 people and it was not comfortable). 

The food was good for mass production, I especially liked that they made international favorites, but would get my fish and chips from a local pub vs. this hotel.

The hotel was very convenient to the Tube (Marble Arch is the closest stop about 2 blocks away) and not far from many big tourist attractions.",4,2014,04,22
150,Five star without the stuffiness,"Like most other London hotels, The Churchill always has a busy feel about the place.  In a great location, just off Oxford Street close to Marble Arch yet still feels relatively peaceful away from the main hustle and bustle.

Reception staff are polite and friendly but check-in and check-out can seem rather slow at times.

The bedrooms here are perhaps my favourite in London.  They are bright and spacious with every amenity you would expect from a 5* hotel.  This includes a decent hairdryer.  As every woman traveller dreads a pathetic hairdryer!  The bathrooms are a good size with a decent shower.

The rooms are tastefully furnished.  The king sized beds are very comfortable and despite the busy location, you cannot hear any outside noise from traffic etc.  You can however, hear housekeeping staff and other guests in the corridors which can be frustrating.  

Breakfast offers a very wide choice of continental and cooked options.  Make sure you allow plenty of time to enjoy the full choice on available.

The Churchill Bar has recently been refurbished and offers a great, heated, outdoor terrace for smokers and non-smokers alike.  Please be aware of the £25 min spend per person for tables on the terrace after 1600hrs.

You certainly feel like you are at a 5* hotel at The Churchill but it is not as stuffy or intimidating as some of its neighbours on Park Lane.",5,2014,04,20
150,Comfortable West End stay,"The Churchill is a big hotel used to dealing with international business travellers but it makes a great place for a break.  Staff polite and helpful.   We had a  'View' room with a fabulous view over the square.  It was one of the most comfortable and spacious London hotel rooms I've stayed in comprising King size bed, double desk, internet, huge picture windows.  Linen crisp, bathroom spotless.  Décor and furnishings muted, bland, solid and conservative - no surprises - but if you want somewhere you can genuinely relax bang in the middle of W.1. this hotel could be for you.  Location is brilliant.  Handy for Hyde Park and Oxford Street.  My only regret is that we didn't stay longer.",5,2014,04,19
150,Great hotel WARNING feel like a number don't use the phone ,I am a platinum member and have been for 10 years the Hyatt hotels are some f the best in the world but I used the phone to call locally and was charged 180 pounds . What a joke I complained and they discounted by 50% but still nearly 100 pounds is a rip off ,3,2014,04,17
150,Superb staff makes this a great hotel,"Stayed here four nights over Marathon weekend.   Was on Club Floor.  While this is a 45 year old building, it has been maintained well.  Bathrooms are small but the rooms are decent sized for London with superb amenities including a good WiFi signal.  Great location, excellent breakfast in the club and sharp staff looking to assist.   We are not big fans of chain hotels, but this hotel is run as well or better than some of the fancier names in the area.   Not cheap but worth it!",5,2014,04,16
150,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Churchill for four nights after visiting Africa.
Having stayed here on several occasions before, it did not disappoint .

Location is perfect, close to Oxford Street and the London ""Tube"" stations

Service was excellent, our rooms, while not large, was adequate and turn down service was very competent.

The whole team of associates at this hotel are focused on making your stay as relaxed and comfortable as possible.

The only negative would be the price of breakfast.
I find that £28.00 pounds for a full English Breakfast a bit over the top.
Especially when you can walk down the street and have the same breakfast for £5.00

Apart from that a great hotel to stay at when you vibist London.
",5,2014,04,12
150,"Prefect Location, Great Hotel","I loved this hotel. I will be planning all my stays in London right here from now on :) The location is unbeatable. A two minute walk and you're right in the middle of Oxford Street. The staff is very friendly, helpful, quick to welcome and serve you. Be it at the front desk or the restaurants. They do go the length of making sure your stay is just as great as it should be. Their Club Rooms are spacious and clean. They boast warm colours, AMAZINGLY comfortable bedding and are very well serviced. The food is delicious. I tried their Breakfast Buffet and their In Room Dining. Nothing short of sumptuous coupled with great service. They also have free WiFi everywhere around the hotel as well as in the rooms. That's something i look for in a hotel. Thanks to everyone that works at this hotel. My stay was such a fantastic one that it has become my favourite hotel destination in London. I will be bringing family with me next time and will definitely recommend it to everyone I know. Keep up the good work :) Thank you.",5,2014,04,11
150,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"I met my Mum and two daughters for afternoon tea on the Friday before Mother's Day. We had a the lovely greeting off the Doorman, a warm welcome inside and just when we thought it couldn't get any better, an evening lovelier welcome from the staff at the restaurant!

We were a little early, so tables were pushed together for us to sit together, our shopping and coats taken from us and put into the cloakroom and a welcome jug of water brought to our table so we could refresh before afternoon tea started.

We were shown to our table when ready and given menus. I had booked an offer through afternoontea.co.uk for champagne afternoon tea. However, my girls were delighted to find out that also applied to the sex and the city afternoon tea!  

We ordered two traditional and two sex and the city teas and both were exquisite. Freshly made sandwiches and brioche rolls on the traditional with freshly made burgers and hotdogs on the satc. When we had eaten it, we were offered refills, free of charge, of which my girls took great advantage of, they absolutely loved the burgers and hotdogs!  Mum and I loved the brioche filled with egg mayonnaise, so light and fluffy, yum!

The scones and cakes were amazing on both teas, and so much, we couldn't finish everything. Mum tried the flirtini cocktail jellies of the satc tea and promptly ate them both!

Service was impeccable, the staff were attentive, yet made us feel very relaxed and nothing was too much trouble.

I would certainly book again, it was a lovely all round experience.",5,2014,04,08
150,Excellent hotel and in a perfect location,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 days at the Churchill, the hotel is in a wonderful location near tube stations and in walking distance to Marks and Spencer and many, many stores - we actually asked for an upgrade to the club floor and were told it would cost us almost $100 US dollars per day, in the states we usually get upgraded for free so that wasn't what we expected - the room was perfectly quiet and had a really good stay - the concierge staff was wonderful and had so many great ideas and options for us - we would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time we are in London",4,2014,04,06
150,Relaxing place to stay,"Me & my hubby spent a weekend at the Churchill for our joint fiftieth birthdays and we had a lovely time. Our room was comfortable & overlooked the square.  Our bed was comfy & the shower was hot...oh & there was Sky footie on the telly!!!  Room service and the restaurant are to be commended too. Breakfast was outstanding..there was everything you could ask for, the staff were courteous & helpful. We have no complaints with this hotel. ",5,2014,04,06
150,"Good solid, friendly service. Is this really England?","Generally I was very happy and would recommend this hotel.

The staff are very gracious and efficient (and I would single out Jennifer at the Concierge desk for a special mention) and the location is superb being just a very short walk from Oxford street (near Marble Arch).

Local restaurants are very good in the top end and many mid-range ones are nearby. The hotel is also a few minutes walk from Edgeware Road and all that has to offer (inlcuding medium sized Tesco and Waitrose).

I used the Bar to meet friends on a number of occasions and the staff are very attentive. I also dined at Locanda Locatelli (inside the hotel) and the food and service were excellent.

I had a club junior suite which was, generally well appointed. The desk is easy to use for work for long hours.

Internet is fast – even the free service (do not bother paying)

My criticisms are:

1. the wardrobe in the junior suite is very small and badly positioned behind the bathroom door. No room to set up a suitcase in the bedroom either.
2. there are two lounges at Club level – “kids” and “no kids”. We were not made aware of this separation and spent a few occasions in the noisy lounge
3. £25.00 minimum charge at the Bar if you wish to sit on the terrace. Go figure
4. water pressure in the shower in weak at best (but the plumbing did otherwise work and did not make death sounds throughout the night – no doubt an achievement for most older hotels in the UK)
5. NO BUSINESS CENTRE. There are two laptops set up at a high table in the lobby with an antiquated printer attached. The printer did not work, so I had to ask Concierge to print a number of documents. There also seemed to be one chap who spent the better part of the day on one of the laptops, using the space as his personal office. Hyatt should recognise that business people want and need a functioning business centre, not just a couple of laptops to surf the internet.
6. Laundry prices outrageous - £9.00 for a shirt to be laundered. Better off buying new one on Oxford Street! But, I guess this rate is a standard for London hotels.
7. The gym. Very small. Few machines. On the plus side – most of the time I was the only person there

I still intend to go back",4,2014,04,03
150,"Solid 4, but not 5-star hotel","My family recently had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. It's well-located between the Marble Arch and Bond St. Tube stations, with clean rooms and updated amenities and a very nice cocktail bar themed around the life of Winston Churchill. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and accommodating. Having said this, I'm not sure how the hotel justifies marketing itself as a 5-star property. But at the equivalent of $400/night, there just isn't anything particularly luxurious or outstanding about it. It's a solid 4-star hotel, and a good value if you can take advantage of package pricing or points.",4,2014,04,03
150,Fantastic London Hotel,"I recently stayed there for 10 days on business.  The location is superb.  Right off Oxford street, just a few blocks from BOnd St Tube.  The place is excellent.  Larger property, decent sized, larger rooms, great technology, wifi is poor like most London hotels.  (use a wire).  TV limited in channels.  The lobby has some restaurant and bar service, but they always seem to be hosting live music.  Piano, horns, etc.  FAR too loud to sit and eat, have a conversation etc.  I didn't really eat there, or even eat room service.  I would goto Marks and Spencer at Oxford St, or Selfridges Food court and buy fresh salads and meals to take to room to eat.  Cheaper and far healthier.  
2 blocks from Hyde Park so plenty of outdoor running potential.  8th floor has a Hyatt Preferred guest lounge, with daily breakfast and evening snacks.  Limited free bar.  Worth it.",5,2014,04,03
150,Outstanding West End Hotel,"I have stayed at the Churchill many times over a long period of time, but this is the first review I have written on the property.  This week I hosted a small (25 people) group meeting at the Churchill.  I have never held a meeting at this property in the past.  The staff at the Churchill made my job effortless.  From beginning to end, my event team, first organized by Astrid De Bellefon and executed by Elisa Lo Locaino of the Churchill's events department, did an outstanding job.  Even though the hotel was quite full, we were assigned two very nice and private meeting rooms, one used for breakfast, lunch and snacks and the other for the business meeting.  The service provided by the banquet staff was quiet and efficient.  The food was fresh and tasty, and the hot food was actually served hot!  I had no time to set up anything in advance, and when I arrived minutes before the meeting, I found the hotel staff had everything fully organized and set up as discussed.  The sleeping rooms at the Churchill are very nice.  Although I have been staying at this property for nearly 20 years, it seems to get better with age.  Always bright, clean and fresh with obvious attention to detail by the staff.  I stay at 25 to 30 different hotel properties each year all over the world and the Hyatt Regency Churchill is clearly one of my all time favorites and certainly best managed.",5,2014,04,02
150,Great Location and wonderful Customer Service,"This one of our favorite Hyatt properties. We try to go here about twice a year. They treat us like royalty. It is a good location and since I am a Diamond member we have access to the Regency club one of the best. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. We went there for a friends birthday and we had one of the best cakes ever that had his name and wished him a Happy Birthday. We also like to give a shout out to Helene she always makes sure our stays there are great, even if she is not there. Helene and people like her is why we love Hyatt!",5,2014,03,29
150,Loved this hotel,"We absolutely loved this Hyatt property. The location was fantastic; there was a laundrette just a short walk away, lots of nearby shopping. The rooms were great; cozy beds, fluffy pillows, delicious breakfast, helpful staff! Really, we couldn't have asked for a better experience! If you get the chance to stay here, do it! You won't be disappointed!",5,2014,03,28
150,Excellent Hotel,"This is a long overdue review for The Churchill. 

Location is excellent, right by Oxford and Bond streets.  Selfridges is close by and all the tourist bus stops is walking distance to Marble Arch.  

Room was fabulous even though I had the view of the back-end of the hotel.  Very sophisticated and modern.  The Club Floor was a nice place to lounge and eat breakfast. The service was great, with the exception of one ""sarcastic"" remark from a guest services person at the front desk when I asked him to drop off some mail for me.  I gave him money for the post, plus tip (telling him he could keep the change), which he replied to ""that's it?"" and actually laughed at me.  The hotel itself is beautiful, from the architecture and decor, and my experience there was great except for that one annoying incident.",5,2014,03,27
150,Nothing short of exceptional,"I am a loyal Hyatt guest (mainly business and some personal.) Me and my partner decided to spend our anniversary in London and stay at the Regency utilizing our loyalty points and paying the average room night. The service was impeccable, the club level refreshments were good, not great but very good. We had a situation with our room and with promptness and professionalism, they handled it immediately. Would highly recommend anyone to this establishment with my utmost regards to the club level staff. Shout out to club level front desk, and the Housekeeping manager.",5,2014,03,20
150,Mostly Great,"The Hyatt Regency is superbly located, close to Oxford Street shopping and a short cab ride from Paddington Station. The hotel itself is large and the rooms are very spacious and well appointed, definitely consistent with the standards of a high-end business hotel. One qualm I have with the property is the slow check-in and check-out process. For a front desk that almost seems overstaffed, it was appalling how long it took to get through a simple check in/out. Also, we pre-paid for one night of our two night stay and were charged for both nights upon checkout. It doesn’t seem like a huge deal but when you consider the exchange rate differential from having the error refunded from pounds to dollars, it gets a bit annoying. Generally, I expected a higher level of competency. The other small complaint I have is with the washroom shower, which is only partially covered, so made for a wet washroom most days. Other than that, I was happy with the hotel and would stay again.",4,2014,03,20
150,Regency wit Suite King,I had the pleasure to stay here twice. My second time the Manager upgraded me and my mother to the Regency Suite. The room isnt big (55sqm) but my mother enjoyed it and it was good enough for me! I think the hotel has excellent service and are in nice conditions. Only thing i react on is their gym and sauna wich is very low level. If they would have a new SPA this one would have got a 5 star. Overall i like the location and service of this hotel!,4,2014,03,18
150,The Emperors New Clothes,"The only positive thing about The Hyatt Regency London - The Churhill is the prices - extremely high - minimum USD 400 a night including taxes.

During my 40 years travelling around the world I have never met such an arrogant attitude and compared with rates, it is totally out of question.

Even in London you can find much better hotels at a much better price.

Hyatt in London is a big automatically runned machine without any personal feelings.

From the outside it looks nice, but if you get inside, it is ""The Emperors New Clothes"".

The restaurant - The Montagu - is nice but nothing special, and if you want to have your coffee afterwards in The Churchill Bar, you are met with a waiter telling you that you must at least spend 25 GBP to be seated !!!!! - after you have spent more than 100 GBP in the restaurant !!!!

Happy that I am checking tomorrow.",1,2014,03,17
150,Amazing,"This was my first time ever staying at a Hyatt and I loved it. The rooms are spacious with great shower heads that allow you to control the pressure of the water and the beds are very comfortable. What I loved about this hotel was that you could borrow things from them like a yoga mat or iphone charger. They also have American outlets as well as UK ones. This hotel is located about 2 blocks away from all the shopping at Oxford street. The front desk was very friendly but the super stars I encountered where at the concierge desk. Kim, Jenny and Zahil were so friendly and very helpful. They would ask me about my day out and always remembered me. All three of them made me feel very special. I would definitely get a room with breakfast. Breakfast was perfect and I never missed a day of it. They had eggs, sausages, cold cuts, cheese, pastries and you could even order pancakes or French toast from a waiter. Frances at breakfast was so friendly and helpful. The staff and the rooms are amazing here. I only wished that they had a mini gift shop or store.",5,2014,03,14
150,"Comfortable, nice view from the room","It has a very welcoming ambience that made for a comfortable stay. Location was excellent too, the windows oversee the Portman Park. Internet was a bit wonky however. Nevertheless a good stay, would definitely recommend.",5,2014,03,12
150,Nice hotel in great location!,"I was in Europe on business and had a 24 hour layover in London so I decided to use points and stay at The Churchill.  I frequently travel to London and usually stay away from the big chain hotels.  Although this hotel is very large (takes up a whole block in Marlybone area), I didn't feel like just another number.  The front desk staff was very welcoming and greeted me by name every time I stopped by.  The room was very small but lovely - clean and modern, bright and airy.  I had requested a ""quiet"" room as sometimes the London street noises can be disturbing.  My room was on the 5th floor overlooking the back of the hotel and I didn't have any disturbances.  Overall, it was a lovely stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to be in this northern area of London.  Keep in mind that it is only accessible by the Central line on the tube so a taxi from Paddington station is an extra cost if you are coming in from the airport and take the Heathrow Express.",5,2014,03,12
150,Nice room; reasonably helpful staff; pleasant gym,"Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Churchill -- I used to stay here years ago when it was an Intercontinental, I believe.  The room was nice.  The gym was OK.  Room service was good.  Location was convenient for my client.  I was offered club access if I paid for it -- I am Platinum but not a Diamond.  So, I can't comment on the club.",4,2014,03,05
150,Wonderful stay - even better location! Highly recommend,"I stayed here for a night in a classic room (it was far bigger than I'd feared, easily enough room to swing a few cats). Fantastic staff, brilliant room service (poached eggs for breakfast, beautifully done).

Would love to stay again soon.",5,2014,03,05
150,Great stay as always,"Stayed here for two days, had a nice room with the usual comforts, nothing lacking. Staff great as always.

Noticed that if your to have breakfast at the club floor, you ideally can't eat at the restaurant downstairs, not an issue however as the club floor is peaceful with great service ",4,2014,03,04
150,Nice Hotel - Great Marylebone Location,"We stayed in a junior suite on the club floor. Service and room excellent. Lounge access including breakfast and food/drinks provided  a nice haven.
We love being near Marylebone High Street which is great for small, interesting, restaurants and cafes. Hotel is also very close to Oxford Street.

The gym is disappointing - just a room with some treadmills in it - but Regents Park is half-a-mile away and a very popular place for running/walking.",5,2014,03,04
150,"Nice Hotel, Good Value, Really Bad Gym","I stay here quite a bit for work.  I am Hyatt Diamond and am supposed to get the best room available though I don't think the staff really understands this is part of the deal, a few times I get a standard (though club access) room when much better rooms are being offered online. 

I have stayed in all levels of rooms and even the worst, though small, is fine.  The suites are also smallish but renovated and nice.  Even basic rooms have a desk and I have had fairly reliable, fast internet service (in the suites, you need to stay near the desk).  There are also plugs everywhere which is nice.  The rooms have irons too, which is hit or miss in Europe.  The common areas are clean.

Location-very good, this is obvious

Restaurants -  I'm confused about the dining options here, there is a fancy restaurant but I think part of it is also a regular casual restaurant (?), not sure, I thought it was all the same but I was seated away from the hustle and the menu was fancy...there is also a bar that appears formal but I haven't tried it.  There is no effort to advertise or educate guests on dining options.  There are a ton of great restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk, especially middle eastern.

The regency club is split, one side for families with kids and one side for business.  I like that a lot.  Breakfast is fine, I think you can order food but the buffet is OK with meat/salmon, cheese, pastries, fruit (no berries), yogurt, cereal, fresh juice, and a coffee machine.  Service is hit or miss but generally pretty good. 

The gym is awful.  It is tiny, the size of a room (maybe two) and does have nice treadmills, a rower, 2 bikes, and a small rack of light dumbells (max weight 10kg). No yoga mats, no free weights, no machines, this is worse than a mediocre home gym; if you need to stick to any kind of fitness regimen this is not the hotel for you.  Really one of the worst hotel gyms I've seen in a while.  

Overall I like the hotel for its location, I travel for work so I dont really pay attention to price, but as comparison I would say it's significantly nicer than the Hilton Paddington and on par with W except the gym, which gets 0 stars.",4,2014,02,26
150,A good stay,"My daughter and I stayed here last weekend, it was her Mothers Day gift to me. We had a lovely room on the seventh floor which enabled us to use the executive bar which was superb.
We had the champagne brunch on the Sunday which was really good value, copious amounts of champagne and a huge variety of food which was fantastic. My daughter commented to a waitress that I am not too keen on cold puddings and she immediately asked the chef to make me a sticky toffee pudding - what service!
The breakfast was great, lots of choice of both cold and hot food.
It's not cheap but a superb place to stay.",5,2014,02,26
150,"Great location, nice regency club floor rooms and facilities","Stayed here for a Friday evening and the service was excellent. The room was a little small, but in comparison to other Central London not tiny. The facilities in the room were excellent and the decor was of a high standard.

If you can stretch or get a Regency Club room I would recommend it as you get access to the club lounge for drinks and snacks and a dedicated breakfast area.",4,2014,02,25
150,"Good service, average property","While I have nothing but positive things to say about the service at The Churchill, the property itself is the reason for my average rating. The staff were responsive and helpful and did anything they could to assist during my stay. This ranged from sending up a service technician quite late when I checked in to address television service, great room service, great care when cleaning the room. My areas of concern are as follows: the noise coming from the room adjacent to mine was quite disruptive. There was a family staying next door to me and I was able to hear them 24x7. (I have a family and understand the noise that can come from young children, but this was above and beyond that). I voiced the concern to the hotel staff, but there was really nothing that could be done. Additionally, the bathroom was a challenging layout with plumbing issues. The water never really got hot and the drains in both the sink and tub were a problem. Also, with no outlet in the bathroom that would accommodate a hair dryer, drying my hair near a mirror was a bit challenging.

All in all, not a bad stay, but not necessarily the right value for the money.",3,2014,02,24
150,Mixed views,"Upon entering the Hyatt it is amazing, the Churchill bar albeit expensive it a beautiful area.  Rooms on the 3rd floor are very tired and in need of a revamp, desperate need of a revamp.  The staff at check in are extremely polite and helpful but once in those lifts its a whole new world.",3,2014,02,24
150,"Brilliant location, Beautiful hotel, Service was not up to Hyatt standards","We enjoyed the Churchill as a distinguished hotel with character in a superb location. However, the service was not up to Hyatt standards. We are Hyatt Platinum members and really know Hyatt and the service at this hotel ranks very low and perhaps the lowest of about a dozen Hyatt Hotels we have stayed in recent months and years.  The front desk service was disappointing and ""over promised and under delivered"". We also had a major noise problem with loud obnoxious guests from 2am to 330am one morning and only after 3 calls did we receive any action from the hotel.  The room was excellent and clean with outstanding maid service.",4,2014,02,20
150,Excellent service & attitude.,"I stayed at the Churchill for several days.  We enjoyed the Churchill Bar, the main bar, the fine dining, the club lounge and found the staff to be helpful, knowledgeable and polite.   The bell staff and doorman to be excellent and the overall service to merit a return trip.   I go to London 3-4 times a year and have stayed at many different hotels but the location and service the Churchill will warrant return trips.   They were helpful and specific in providing dining directions, cabs to take me to various locations, appointments and restaurants, etc.",5,2014,02,17
150,Sex and the City afternoon tea,Friends and family joined together to celebrate a 50th birthday.  I can only praise and highly recommend checking this out.  It was excellent value for money.  A good atmosphere.  The food on offer was different from your typical afternoon tea.  Piano playing very busy and a good afternoon for all 12 people who joined in the fun.  I would definitely come back again with friends or family for a treat.  Everyone deserves this kind of treat from time to time.,5,2014,02,16
150,Wonderful Weekend Stay,"Stayed Saturday as a treat and we loved the hotel, the staff on the 8th floor were exceptionally helpful and friendly.  Everyone in the loyalty club really stood out as helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them when requested.  

Relaxing was easy, from evening drinks to snacks before bed and a wonderful breakfast.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2014,02,10
150,Excellent choice in W1,"I have stayed at The Churchill four or five times over the last several years and have never been disappointed.  I stayed there for business five nights last week.  I am Hyatt Platinum so perhaps I receive better than average treatment but I sense they provide a good experience for all. 

I stay so often at Hyatts and at so many different ones that I am in a good position to compare them.  If you are looking to stay in W1, this is an excellent choice.  You are within walking distance of just about everything.  The Marble Arch tube is just around the corner as are the Oxford Street shops and department stores and Mayfair restaurants.

I have to thank Lee who did a great job of checking me in last week and helping with a few needs that I had.  I find the staff to be helpful whether it be the front desk, at the restaurant, at the Regency Club or the cleaning people.

The lobby is nice but not incredible.  The rooms are very good.  Look, this is not the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons but then you're paying far less here than at those hotels.  I don't know when the rooms were last redone but they don't feel old.  And unlike some rooms in London, you don't feel cramped in the space.

The breakfast in the dining room is very good.  You can choose from both the hot and cold buffets and they will make you anything else that you want.  I ordered pancakes one morning which were excellent.  They also have fresh squeezed orange juice which was awesome.  I had access to the Regency Club.  I ate breakfast there two of the days.  More importantly, I enjoyed the early evening snacks and drinks which they provided.

All in all, I think you'll enjoy staying here.",5,2014,02,03
150,Would book again,"Booked this hotel as a ""secret deal"" excellent location.beautiful hotel. I booked triple room for myself and grown up daughters. Oky slight criticism was the third bed was added to a twin room which made room slightly cramped ",5,2014,02,01
150,Standards slipping?,I have stayed at the Churchill a number if times both for leisure and business as a family. we always enjoy our stay. We normally chose a club room.The service is always of a high standard.However on a recent business trip I was really disappointed. The usually attentive porters were so busy I had to struggle with a number of very heavy bags (reception staff failed to help).My room had chewing gum on the carpet - I only noticed when my sock became stuck to the carpet. The selection of snacks in the club room was very limited.If I was a first time visitor to the hotel I would not return.,3,2014,02,01
150,Nice Hotel & Excellent customer service,"I went to this Hotel to visit my relatives who were staying at this hotel. My Uncle invited me to stay overnight as we came back to the hotel very late. The receptionist manage to arrange an extra bed without any extra cost. In the morning, the reception was so busy and we didn't want to wait for the queue so we decided to go, But the gentleman who worked by the main door named Bobby was so nice and friendly. He help us with directions and places to go. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2014,01,30
150,A safe choise,"Perfect hotel with a good location in the hart off London. Close to Oxford Street, Hyde Park and Madame tussaud. The restaurant was very good to a nice price. Everything was like a hotel should be. A nice base for shopping and sightseeing .",5,2014,01,29
150,Location and service,"Stayed at the Churchill for 5 nights excellent service fabulous breakfast. Dinner not pretentious but good quality. Housekeeping needs more attention to details so that you do not have to call for missing items all the time. 

On Portman Square a few minutes walk to Oxford street perfect for shopping and west end entertainment.",4,2014,01,26
150,The most arrogant & unprofessional people i have ever met in this industry.,"This is the first time i have ever written a review but i think that people should be aware my Hyatt Churchill experience.
I am staying in Hyatt properties for about 60-70 days a year all over the world and it has always been a great place to stay.
However, Hyatt Churchill has ruined everything, i had to cancel all my future reservations( was planning to stay for two more weeks) and to change it for Hyatt Andaz.
Why:
 walls are thin, its very nosy, you can hear people in the room next door. There are always people outside your room, cleaning, talking and making all kind of noises that don't let you to sleep or to work.
The worse part of my stay at this property are the people who are working at the Churchill bar and terrace. I have never met such unprofessional arrogant services in my life. 
After staying here for more than a week and spending every day money on drinks food etc, they still manage to be stupid enough and to approach me with the statement that i can not drink my tee outside on the terrace because the minimum spend per person has to be 25 pound! 
While i have spend more than 70 pound a couple of hours before when i had my pre-dinner drinks in the very same bar.
Unprofessional, money making, disrespectful and not clever people! You should recognise your good clients and be flexible and respectful! I did spend 150 pounds on drinks at the very same day because i was so embarrassed in front of my friends that i bought drinks for everybody, but you have lost me as a long term staying client at this property!!! Never, Hyatt Churchill anymore for me! Guys, go to Andaz, where young, friendly and specially professional people are working.",2,2014,01,26
150,As expected,A very good high end hotel with excellent service. The rooms are really nice and the ones to the front look out over the square. All the staff were very efficient food was good and the in room tv service includes Sky sports.,4,2014,01,25
150,The Worst Hotel in the World!!,"Please never visit this horrible hotel.
The cleaning standard is 2 star level, overall service standard is so poor. The attendants at each departments are the worst experience ever. The club lounge food was horrible and as a diamond tier member( My wife), the amenities and services were so bad. I lost my sunglasses in the room, no one paid any attnetion, the management must be playing Golf not checking the standard of services. We visited 5 times, we lost few items from the room, no one paid any attentions. No more we will go to this hotel. Guest Service attendants never got back to us about the lost items, and this hotel must check by the Hyatt group as never visited such horrible Hyatt brand in the world.

Hotel manager doesnt care so as General Manager if they really exist. Do not travel there as you will waste your time and lose valuable itesm.",1,2014,01,23
150,A Club Level Fit For A Prime Minister,"Our family of five had a wonderful stay in two suites on the club level from December 26 to the 30th, 2013. We used Hyatt points to upgrade our rooms and found this to be an exceptional value. The club level service during the 7-11 breakfast and 5:30 - 7:30 cocktail hour was outstanding. Welcoming, attentive staff members constantly circulated to offer exceptional service. A partial list of the breakfast selection included fresh fruit, muffins, scrambled eggs, meats and cheese, juices and granola. The evening cocktail hour featured wines and proseco along with delicious hot and cold hors d'oeuvres. Beer, coffee, juices, and water were available throughout the day.

We had a suite on the ninth floor while our three boys stayed on the eighth. The eighth floor suite seemed recently renovated with a nicer shower and bathroom than our room. The rooms were quite spacious, nicely appointed, and quiet. The Molton Brown bath products were a treat.

We have traveled extensively in Europe and found this Hyatt to be an excellent value with outstanding service. We look forward to returning.",5,2014,01,15
150,A bit dusty - great location - friendly staff,"What shall I say. I came unexpected with family. Concierge was good (tnx Jennifer) and check in was great. 

Ok they forgot my birthday can happen but shouldn't happen in a 5star hotel and esp for hyatt gold passport platinum or higher  members ... esp when I was traveling a lot in Hyatt's last year. 

Otherwise location is great, staff as said friendly and it is more or less clean. Beds are a bit chewing gums and the rooms have the typical carpet style you often see in the UK. ",3,2014,01,15
150,Great business hotel,"Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, great lobby bar with live music in the afternoons. International atmosphere with a lot of interesting guests. Easy to invite business partners over for a snack and drink. You have to taste the drinks in the lobby bar! Over all great!",5,2014,01,13
150,"Very good hotel, but expensive parking","The hotel is situated in the West End of London and is close to Oxford Street and Bruton Street.

The hotel is tastefully equipped and spacious. The rooms are good in size and very comfortable. Showers are a little small and are not separate but in the bath tub. The separate larger shower would be more convenient and taking the price of the night into account more justified.

The management which I have used was very inviting. The breakfast yeah is good and all products are fresh.

The staff very friendly and considerate. The bar and the lobby lounge are also comfortable and the food and drinks are very tasty

The only unpleasant surprise I had, was that the hotel charged me with £40 per night for parking my car. In the end I was I was told to pay £80. I know that parking is scarce in London, but taking the high room rates into account, as well as that I am a Hyatt platinum member I think this is a definite case of profiteering and racketeering. After complaining to the front desk, the front desk manager then cordially discounted £40 to me. In the end I paid £40 for parking. The hotel should provide parking for free to guests who to stay in the hotel overnight. This is pretty standard at all Hyatt hotels worldwide.

",4,2014,01,10
150,A relaxing stay,"From check in to check out - a seamless, pleasant pre Christmas and New Year stay. Staff, friendly and helpful. Rooms clean, neat and best of all - everything works. Close to Oxford Street and all amenities. ",4,2014,01,10
150,Good stay,"I stayed here with my mom for 2 nights. The room was comfortable and spacious. The staff was friendly. Afternoon tea and breakfast was wonderful. However, service was inconsistent. I requested few times for few items from housekeeping but the items never came. When the refrigerator broke down, the engineer and staff came quickly to try to solve the problem. The location was excellent as it was close to many department stores like Selfridges, Marks & Spencers and Primarks.",4,2014,01,09
150,Look no Further,"My word what a lovely hotel. Traveled through London on the tale of a vacation in France and booked here last min. It was perfect room, and the staff were helpful and friendly, and not overly pretentious. They provided excellent recommendations (The Grazing Goat). The location is also prime. I would definitely recommend staying here, the breakfasts are delicious as well. Look no further traveler.",5,2014,01,07
150,"Great Hotel, excellent location, good food, well trained staff","Have stayed here for business and pleasure over the past 8 years.  Would highly rated it.  Beautiful hotel, rooms the size expected of Central London hotel.  Hotel well maintained, food excellent, staff excellent, beds super-comfortable. Only area of comment is with some of the newer staff in Montague need to be more service orientated and less curt with customers.

Overall would highly recommend without reservation",5,2014,01,07
150,Lovely hotel in a perfect location,We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay at The Churchill.  The hotel is conveniently located on Portman Square within easy walking distance of Oxford street and the underground. We had a club room which gave us access to complimentary breakfast and sundowners. The rooms were comfortable and very clean and well equipped with an adequate supply of high end toiletries.Service from hotel staff was friendly and efficient. We can highly recommend this hotel and would very happily stay here again should the occasion arise.,5,2014,01,06
150,Surprised and delighted!,"Everything was just how it should have been. We were surprised by some of the previously less complimentary comments about The Churchill. We can only assume that the less than favourable comments were left purely because the hotel was very busy over the Christmas and New Year periods. Our experience was delightful. From the time we checked in and until we left, everything was flawless – especially the Churchill Martinis!

The courtesy of the staff and the attention to detail meant that a bottle of champagne and cake appeared as if by magic purely because the check-in staff had realised we were visiting for a landmark occasion. 

Top marks Churchill - please ensure these high standards never slip during 2014!",5,2014,01,06
150,Proper London Hotel,"After a rocky start...we were initially assigned a room next to the maid's supply room with a ""view"" of the wall of a building across the street... we had a very proper stay. This hotel is well-located on Portman Square and was convenient to all of the great restaurants we enjoyed and most of the attractions we visited. Despite the tumult of the Christmas season, the hotel did its best to maintain its high standards.",4,2014,01,04
150,Perfect London Hotel,"Perfect location for a stay in central London, particularly for family and tourism visits. Great location, away from city hustle bustle, yet extremely central for any travel needs. Tube(subway) proximity makes transfers and transportation quite easy. The multilingual staff could not be more eager to please the customers. The Club Lounge is excellent also, providing a very nice respite to a busy sightseeing or business activity day. In-room amenities and bedding comfort is first-class. Highly recommended for short or long term visit.",5,2014,01,02
150,poor service and too crowded during the holidays.,"spent two nights at this hotel just before NYE.  agreed with reviewer below with regards to some guests in the club lounge lacking basic social etiquette and the staff just let them be. the lounge felt way too busy and loud most of the time. we felt as if they gave lounge access to every staying guests and their friends. we inquired the concierge desk about public transportation and the staff did not seem to be very knowledgeable or she just did not care. we expected better services from a central London hotel with so much history and tradition. i will give them points for the location and accommodating our very early arrival.  if you are going to charge 500 USD a night for a <30m2 room with a concrete roof view, then you should make sure your guests are well taken care of.",3,2014,01,02
150,Never Again,"I would start by saying we are very, very loyal Hyatt customers. This is our third stay in a row late December of five nights each time and I am disappointed with the hotel. It is a tradition we thought we had established, however I now feel compelled to write this mid stay. The hotel has slipped dramatically from the check in phase to the most basic of requests. As an example, we are a family of five, and our request for 3 additional towels, despite several phone calls, was met 8 hours later with the delivery of 3 additional bath mats.  We never had wine glasses in our suite or connecting room.  We called and asked for 2 wine glasses . It took two phone calls the first night and three the second night to receive wine glasses. Is it possible that the hotel has a policy not to supply wine glasses?  More shampoo and conditioner? Same story.  And the Club Lounge.  It is like a trough.  There are a certain type of tourist within the hotel who greatly lack manners and respect.  I feel like a second class citizen here and will not return.  Each year I book a suite and an interconnecting room and I will now take my business elsewhere in the future.",2,2013,12,29
150,Well Done!,"I stayed in a club room at this Hyatt on a personal three day vacation to London. The staff was very pleasant and helpful at check-in making sure I had a map of the area as well as a synopsis of the property highlights. The room was nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable. The Regency Club room had an excellent selection of hors’dourves and beverages. Close to the Oxford Street shopping district, It was an enjoyable stay all the way around. Well done Hyatt!",5,2013,12,27
150,"Good, but the door locks were to Noisy","Every things were excellent, except the rooms door locks(design defect) that very noisy, Room servise was very good, all the staff are perfect, the location of the hotel is fantastic, and furniture in the room was nice.",4,2013,12,26
150,Wonderful hotel with the great Hyatt standard,"Stayed overnight here with my husband in a Club room. Fabulous evening, beautiful room, luxury bed and the usual high class standard of evening cocktails and drinks in the Club lounge. Just unfortunate for the rude tourists that were in the lounge being exceptionally common with their language to the staff.
This is a fabulous hotel and fortunately you can always trust with a Hyatt hotel an exceptional level of service and comfort.",5,2013,12,22
150,"Great service, great location and beautiful room",London is one out of the 3 cities we went for our honeymoon. We stayed here for few nights. The lobby was beautiful and cozy. The front desk agent was helpful. The bellman was very attentive. The room was beautiful. 3 minutes walk to all the shopping stores. 5 minutes walk to Hyde Park. Great selection of food at the Regency Club with friendly personnel and treats you like a VIP.,5,2013,12,21
150,Superb service in the Winter Terrace,"A pop up bar has opened for the winter on the terrace of the Churchill Bar. White rugs, hot water bottles, blankets and heaters are supplied. The service was exceptional. You must try it.  Come for a special birthday glass of champagne.",5,2013,12,15
150,"Great location, great staff!","Every time we stay at this hotel the staff has an amazing ability to make the whole family feel as though we're home. Rooms are always clean, executive lounge access is worth every penny (food is so good and plentiful in the evenings we often did not need to go out to dinner at a pricey restaurant (let's face it, that's fun too). This is a good value in a great location, and the excellence of the staff always ensures we'll be back again.",4,2013,12,15
150,Disappointment,"We travelled to London for a 3 night vacation and after a very long flight with my one year old we arrived at the hotel only to be greeted by a very pleasant yet clueless receptionist. The gentleman attending to us was disorganized that check in took us 30 min. I requested for a baby cot when I initially booked the hotel and when I got to the room I had to wait for them to come set up the cot, the two ladies that came to set up the baby cot had no idea how to even open the camp cot, I landed up doing everything myself. The breakfast room was well catered with friendly personnel and the location of this hole is great . Room was a comfortable size but nothing grand and the toiletries in the bathroom where of the worst quality I have even seen. The bar is great and has a wonderful atmosphere. All in all this hotel has a great location but needs serious training of the staff  in order for it to be a great hotel",2,2013,12,14
150,My perfect place to stay,"After Paris, we stayed two nights in this nice hotel. 
This was our first trip to London, but feel like we have been stayed in this place several times.
We found this hotel is in a great location in the city, with only walking distance to the famous Oxford Street. The hotel staff are nice and helpful. Breakfast and canape in the club lounge are (always) great. Other interesting thing about this hotel is that we found a chinese restaurant located very close by.
We enjoyed our first trip to this city, and also enjoyed staying in this hotel. 
This hotel is definitely one of my favourite hotel!",5,2013,12,13
150,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed two nights in December. Great location close to Oxford Street. Staff very professional and helpful. Rooms comfortable. Churchill Bar, which is part of the hotel, is a great place for cocktails. service was exceptional. They have an outside heated terrace bar where you can enjoy a cigar or cigarette. You are provided with sheepskins and blankets to keep you warm, Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Will definitely book for next year.",5,2013,12,12
150,12 years and still as good as ever !!!,"Another great stay at the Churchill, polite staff, nice executive suite, welcome card, wine and fruit on arrival. Great continuity fantastic welcome from Ian & Co. Bar staff very engaging and fantastic seating area outside. Regency lounge staff again excellent. Favourite Hyatt at the moment ",5,2013,12,12
150,Great stay!,"Stayed Saturday night ! Booked 730am on day of arrival arrived at 1130 am to be shown to our room . 
Nice big room .very comfy bed .television wouldn't turn off then wouldn't turn on ?! Hotel gave us a glass of champagne in the bar as a sorry .
Car parking ( at a cost) underneath the hotel .
Breakfast was fantastic as Hyatt breakfasts always are .
Definitely stay again ",5,2013,12,08
150,Fantastic central london luxury hotel,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill. It is a luxury hotel and the location is absolutely fantastic. The staff at the hotel are extremely welcoming and seem to go out of their way to do whatever you need, from the doorman to the reception to the Club staff. Really excellent. I booked a Club Room, which I highly recommend. The rooms are fairly standard, but large for UK standards. Well appointed and clean. The location is perfect. It is situated on Portman Square, which is a large park, which gives the impression of space. The hotel is a short walk to Oxford Street from which you can easily access downtown London to the left or towards Marble Arch and Harrods to the right. It is all right there. Nothing is more than a short walk away. The hotel has a small gym (don't forget to turn on the air conditioning, otherwise it gets quite warm) and is quite a happening place. There is a restaurant downstairs that seems always busy and the Churchill Bar on the corner. But if you want to get outside the hotel, there are lots of eating and drinking options that are London favourites.",5,2013,12,07
150,the Bar of the Hotel,"The barmen and waiters at the Churchill Hotel are the best we have experienced in London.
The bar is great for after work drinks and it is a great way to unwind after a hard day.
The atmosphere is quite formal but the staff are very friendly and welcoming to whoever walks in.",5,2013,12,04
150,Good location,"Hotel is a bit tired, but location is better than other Hyatt (Andaz) which is in the City. Rooms and pricing seem standard for central London, but nothing to especially recommend it if not member of Hyatt GP program. Beds very comfortable, rooms are plush. Workout room for gym, not a spa area.",4,2013,12,04
150,Excellent,"Excellent hotel and service. Would definitely stay again. Great location. Pret A Manger practically right around the corner across from Marble Arch for affordable food if you're there to site see, etc. Tube station close by.

 ",5,2013,12,04
150,Enjoyed the stay,"We stayed at the Hyatt Churchill during our most recent stay in London Mid November 2014 for 6 nights. We had booked 3 nights at the normal room and 3 nights at the club room. Our first 3 nights were great. We liked the room and enjoyed the breakfast and felt very comfortable. To our surprise we didnt feel the same towards the club room (at the club floors) that have their own lounges. It felt different and a bit isolated. We couldnt have breakfast at the Montagu restaurant any more (although we paid more). The room is the same size (but smaller wardrobe).  Maybe because we didnt use the lounges except for breakfast we felt like we paid extra for more restrictions. Most of the staff were helpful and especially the concierge. The location is Excellent!
We will go back,, but not in the club rooms!",5,2013,12,01
150,Is it only me that could not sleep,"Booked for a birthday weekend
The hotel is a high end hotel near marble arch.it started well with a upgrade and a bottle plus cake in the room
The reason for a poor review is the lack of sleep due to noise level from rooms around ours.you can hear tv's and talking/shouting all night.i prob slept for a couple of hours over 2 nights. Maybe i just got poor neighbours/but it ruined my thoughts on this hotel
",3,2013,12,01
150,Hyatt does it again: crisp service,"Hyatt knows how to treat its guests-with friendly, knowledgable service-oriented staff. 

We went to the concierge level for checkin and one of the staff recognized me from an earlier visit in March. I thought her memory impressive, especially after she asked about my daughters (who were not even with me). Rooms have comfortable beds for a european hotel, ample closets & oversized towels. Just off granite lobby there is a bar area serving light food and boasting a grand piano with nightly singer. A relaxing place to be after a long day.
Went to Harrods and purchased a silver tea strainer gift but when I returned to hotel found several imperfections. Told the 8th floor concierge and she called Harrods immediately and they offered to send a replacement to the states for my trouble. How's that for service? 

Hyatt is tops with their knowledge of the service sector. Am always impressed with their level of professional courtesy and knowledge. Looking forward to my next trip.",4,2013,11,30
150,Great hotel in a great London location,"This was the second time I stayed at the Churchill.  The front desk and concierge employees in the ground floor lobby are very knowledgable and just great. In fact, all of the staff are incredibly friendly and try to be helpful.

The lobby is elegant. The rooms are very nice and clean, perhaps not very big, but spacious enough for a hotel. 

The location is also great. Close to Marble Arch tube station and a block from bus stops with a variety of buses that take you everywhere in London. Also, many restaurants are in walking distance, as it is on Portman Square and close to Oxford Street, James Street and Marylebone.

One tip: If you can get upgraded to the club floors using points or for only a few more dollars, that is worth it.",4,2013,11,29
150,Elegant hotel in prime West End location.,"We decided to stay here to finish out tour of the UK in style and we weren't disappointed.
We found the staff to be friendly and attentive. (Maybe a little too attentive at times)
The room, 218. although not the biggest was extremely well furnished and very comfortable.
There is also a car park under the hotel where you can park for 24 hours plus for 30 pounds.
The only downside was a member of staff knocking on our room door at 10:30 in the morning, in spite of the Do Not Disturb light being on to ask if we needed water and to check the mini bar contents,",5,2013,11,26
150,Lovely Elegant Hotel,"We stayed at Hyatt Regency Churchill for one night this November, we wanted a hotel with good location that allows us to make the most out of our short stay which aimed originally at enjoying London's greatest Xmas lights, and we were not disappointed at all. The room was very nice and elegant, staff were friendly and knowledgeable and amongst all, the location is super with few minutes walk from Oxford St., super. Well, the downside was at the breakfast buffet prices, we didn't book bead and breakfast as we had other plans but then we decided to have breakfast at the hotel, and to be fair the buffet was excellent with lots of choices unlike other hotels in London with very limited items, but 92 Ponds for 3 people for breakfast I think is too much, other than that we really enjoyed our time.",5,2013,11,25
150,"Great Location , good hotel","good hotel in a very central location. staff somehow a bit arrogant ( here ,even the bell man corrects my English as I am not a native speaker ) But never mind, they do it at least with style.... 
Rooms are clean , not very spacious but 5* standard. Club lounge is well stocked with good food and drinks, you get double checked to see if you have really the right to access the lounge. 
Overall a good business hotel.",4,2013,11,24
150,"Upscale Hotel, Professional Staff, Good Location","The hotel is very nice and professionally staffed.  I don't think I ever opened the hotel door for myself in the five days we stayed.  The lobby is marble and can get slippery, but the staff was always there to warn.  The concierge staff was helpful with directions and such, although it seemed that they were not quite used to some of the more ""pedestrian"" requests we had.  The room was very nice, and could have been a Grand Hyatt in any city.  Because they are a Hyatt, you may be able to use points or some other type of promotion from Hyatt.com.  The neighborhood is close to Oxford Street and the bus/tube.  As a home base for touring, there was something a little sterile about it, but if I were here for business, it would be perfect.",4,2013,11,23
150,Very nice hotel in a good location,My son and I stayed here and we were impressed with the level of service. The hotel is well located and is quite convenient. I especially like the park/tennis court across the street with the leaves having so many colors (I have no idea how anyone would play tennis on it this time of the year). The reception desk was very accommodating and friendly. The club lounge staff was very attentive and friendly. The rooms while not large compared to other countries is still comfortable by London's standards. I would stay here again on the return trip.,4,2013,11,21
150,Nice hotel with good service,"This hotel is very pleasant.  Our room was clean and modern.  The staff was helpful and accommodated our request for an early checkin after an overnight transatlantic flight.  The location is just off Oxford Street and is within a short walk from Tube access.  The hotel is also located a short distance (we took a taxi) from Paddington Station, if you need to catch a train out of London or to Heathrow.",4,2013,11,20
150,Friendly & Meticulate Service Throughout,"Stayed there on awards redemption, was upgraded to a suite room on the club floor. Staff at the reception is extremely helpful and so is the concierge (Bobby). Rooms and amenities provided is first class not forgetting the complimentary sweets & champagne offered to us on our stay. We are extremely well taken care of by the service attendants while at breakfast on the club floor. Very polite & should receive full of praise. Reminds me of the high standards instilled for an English Butler. Selection of breakfast is more than what I had expected at club lounge. It was indeed a memorable stay with my wife at Hyatt Regency London. Will come again the next time of my stay.",5,2013,11,20
150,"Comfortable, generous stocked rooms, good position","Very well placed for Oxford st, Harley St and Marylebone. This is a comfortable hotel, the rooms are very well stocked with all sorts of goodies, the bed is king sized and the linen top notch. The staff were efficient and friendly. This is very much an international hotel",5,2013,11,18
150,"Good hotel with great food, one manageress at check-in needs training though","We arrived at the hotel by buss as this was a business trip. Since the rooms were not ready we got sent up the second floor for a lunch, and I have to commend the chef on an outstanding lunch that was served. Buffet style set up in a conference room, but I take my hat off to the quality of the food and also the service of the staff.

When it comes to location, I cannot really say much as we were shipped from the airport for just over 1 hour on a buss to this hotel, so it is not close to the airport, but again we were shipped to another conference on the other side for about 1 hour again, but this review is about the hotel

When we finished our lunch my colleague and I decided to avoid the que when checking in and thought we would go and check if we could check in. At the reception desk we got a really nice girl who tried to help us, but since we were part of a group booking had to call the manager to assist, it was at this stage where we got treated like we were breaking some federal law?! ""You are part of a group and you are not to check in as I have all the keys and will hand them out when I am ready"", we were told in a really demeaning tone. Excuse me, we are merely asking if it is possible, we do not need to be lectured or told what we are and what we are not, there is a nice way to say ""I apologise, because you are part of a group it is impossible to check you in right now, I promise we will do our utmost to speed up the check in process when this happens"" would have been a much nicer and more accepted way to treat a guest in a 5 star establishment like this. 

For the rooms, they were really great and a good size, internet was also available at no cost although it was probably a slow network, but sufficient to get our emails.

We had dinner in the restaurant as we had a meeting there and the food was exceptional. We also had breakfast which was again exceptional. The master chef runs a great restaurant and I can highly recommend even just going to the restaurant

Concierge was really helpful when it came to booking a taxi to take us to the airport the next day and they were really friendly.

Again this is a hotel that I would recommend as long as you are not dealing with that 1 manageress who seemed to have a real bad attitude and even the trainee felt out of place. I rated the service as very good, since they lost 1 star for the manageress.",5,2013,11,18
150,"Excellent location, great hotel","We stayed in a Regency Suite with a view of Portan Square from the terrace. Really lovely room and sizable by London standards. The staff at the hotel was terrific, especially Andrew in the Executive Floor. He was able to arrange a room switch that got us the view, which we appreciated. 

Breakfast each morning was quite nice and got us off on the right foot for the day. Cocktails each night were a wonderful way to end the day.

We didn't stop in to the lobby bar or restaurant (just no time!) but it certainly seemed very popular morning, noon, and night. 

Hotel is squeaky clean and a short walk to the Marble Arch tube. Loved the Molton Brown products in the bathroom.

Overall a very solid stay in a very traditional London hotel.",4,2013,11,17
150,Superb location & hotel,"I booked the hotel using points gained from business stays at other Hyatts, so can honestly say I don't know how much this stay should have cost.

We stayed in a club room, which was spacious with a view of the park. Room facilities and check in etc flawless, superb customer service, and one of the rare hotel chains that seems to have a booking system that works without issue.
Included was access to the lounge on the 8th floor, so we were able to have a glass of wine in comfort before going out for dinner, and then a wonderful continental breakfast in the morning. 

Excellent location, just off Marble Arch, so easy access to anything in London that you would need.

Would strongly recommend, but I doubt it would be a place I would stay at ""normal"" rates.",5,2013,11,17
150,Not the best Elite Memeber Hotel,"The best thing about this property would really be it's location.  It's very close to everything shopping and there are loads of restaurants right outside your door.  With that said, most people staying there are business travelers.  So as a business class hotel in London, I'd rate this hotel very average.  It's grossly expensive for what it has to offer. The rooms are comfortable and nice enough, but compared to other properties at the same level in that neighborhood they fair quite poor.  Internet speed is average.  Service is average to non-accommodating.  Nothing about their staff is pro-active.  I've found myself many times chasing down the waiter for breakfast.  The front desk staff are happy to answer questions but do little to process and act on anything discussed. They do a poor job managing elite guests or making those guests feel valued.  I'm a Diamond Member with Hyatt and have stayed in almost every Hyatt across the globe and in comparison to the brand, this property does one of the worse jobs managing elite members.  Upgrades are out of the question. I've even upgraded myself using a Diamond Suite upgrade once to arrive on property and have them not honor it.  This property runs at high occupancy so they have little incentive to go above and beyond.  This also means they have little to no ability to accommodate any mistakes made.  If they've given your room/suite away, it's gone.  There will be no other available rooms within that category they could move you to.  There service model tends to be one of, we'll take care of you next time, rather than help me now.  Every time I've stayed here they've given me the name of someone who would help make my next stay enjoyable but no one has ever tried to make my current stay palatable.  If this hotel was at about half the rate they currently charge, it'd be a deal.  However at their price point and in that location of London, it fairs poorly.  There are many other great properties within a stone trow away from this one that will offer a better value and an overall better experience.",3,2013,11,14
150,Consistently excellent,"Stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights, having not stayed for a while. I would have to say the hotel is probably the best for the price in London; clean, bright modern rooms, helpful attentive staff and an excellent central location convenient for shopping, theatres and eating out. I will be visiting again in the near future.",5,2013,11,10
150,"Okay, but needs a lot of work to be a real five star hotel.","I read many of the comments about the Churchill, and although I can also see similar flaws, I generally found the hotel a good base. Yes, the prices are rather incredulous, especially as The Churchill unfortunately suffers one of the biggest flaws that other hotels also face - that they don't just serve the hotel guest staying in the hotel, but also a large percentage of the general public who take-over much of the dining and comfort this hotel offers.

Despite staying in the hotel for eight days, it took this time for me to go from rather impressed, to rather disenfranchised by the lack of five star service; to the point some staff (especially those in the Bar areas) were oblivious to my needs. Its not a big deal to sit at the bar and have to stretch backwards to pour wine for my guests, but considering the staff were there - wouldn't they be more attentive – and even trying some of my acerbic wit on one bar member (with a smile) resulted in him turning away and not even acknowledging what I had said – the look of disdain was palpable. 

One more niggle that even the smallest issue of the main bar being closed one evening for a private function would generally be conveyed to guests in advance by a memo in the room - no such thought process went through the hotel nor the fact I had planned to meet a number of guests there and my plans needed changed at the last minute.

This leads me on to the main dining room, where someone sometime woke up and thought it would be great to have an open dining concept with the kitchen wide-open and guests serving themselves from pans on the stove. I am not adverse to a few germs, but feel guest food should be kept-back from such delights as one would a lion in the zoo - dangerous, noisy and open to health and safety infractions - I went to the Radisson next door on more than one occasion to eat in peace and calm, rather than have to shout over the noise of this particular dinning room - although must admit the staff were very attentive - perhaps the same training could be given to the bar staff?

One of the other reviewers mentioned that it was no longer a Great British Hotel due to the number of staff from other countries being employed. Personally - this is the hotels redeeming feature, instead of the generally grumpy British ""I am not being paid to serve"" mentality, we get fresh-faced, eager to please staff from around the world - a much better experience, although I would say house-keeping staff were the most polite and engaging, and the rest of the hotel seemed to be far too focused on fast efficient service without the pleasantries or passion one would have liked to see. 

Beds were comfortable, although not the best; the desk was small and the room lacked enough power sockets (despite servicing almost every kind of international power socket imaginable) - once you plug the kettle in, you are left with one UK socket at desk level to plug all your gadgets in! 

Lastly, this is not a business hotel - I discovered this after the requirement to use the business centre, which is a desk with two PC's and a Printer in the lobby - reminds me of a travel lodge or B&B  - the computers did not work well and I failed to print anything; despite trying on three separate occasions - they really need to make one of their rooms a PROPER business centre. (PC, Printer, Photocopier, Fax and Scanner!)

Location-wise, this hotel sits near Selfridges on Oxford Street and is walking distance to Buckingham Palace, if you want to stretch your legs (2 miles there and 2 miles back) - the Churchill could be so much 'more' than it is, but it is let down by an attempt to be modern and guest focused, yet the guests seem to be a tedious annoyance in the process of getting more bums on seats in their food and drink outlets.",3,2013,11,08
150,Really Great Place near Oxford Street,"This has to be one of the best places in London.  I stayed here free with my Hyatt Card anniversary, but it was worth paying for if you have the money.  The hotel is located across the street from a nice, private park and the concierge has a key for guests to access the space.  My son loved going over during the day and riding his scooter which was a relaxing time for me to read the paper.  We didn't eat in the restaurant, but I had a couple of cocktails and we did get room service a couple of times as it is sometimes easier with our small children.  
Front desk was so helpful when I decided to extend the stay and she was able to get the night for us when it seemed the place was close to full.  This is high end, but seems worth it.",5,2013,11,02
150,A Touch of Class,"The Churchill has been a well reputed hotel throughout its long history, and its acquisition by the Hyatt Regency chain allowed it to elevate its amenities to become one of the foremost hotels in modern day London.  Substantial refurbishment brought the property from its fifty year old image to a modern, efficient and well managed establishment, and this was achieved without losing any of its previous character.  Located in the Portman Square precinct, it is close to both leisure and retail attractions as well as a parkland area opposite, which invites guests to enjoy a leisurely stroll through the area, allowing always for the invariably predictable moist weather of London. (We were fortunate in that it was only light rain for half of our visit.)

The room we booked was well appointed and very comfortable but the bathing facility was a reminder of the fifty year history of the hotel.  There was no shower stall, only a showering facility over the bath tub.  This in itself is not necessarily a major inconvenience, but the depth of the tub was of post WW2 style and the sides were rather sheer.  Following knee replacements, such a facility was quite daunting to me, but my wife, far better equipped with original accessories, was not perturbed.  As our stay was for three nights, I requested a change of room.  Unfortunately, the only rooms fitted with shower stalls were the two premium suites or the two ""special needs"" rooms.  We found the suite to be an excellent alternative, but the additional cost was quite substantial, but a minor concession was made.  I mention this factor as I would expect that there is quite a large proportion of tourists of similar vintage to us, or with similarly limiting physical impediments, and not being aware of this situation could present an unexpected disappointment on admission.  I will request such information when making hotel reservations in future. The suite was excellently appointed and far superior to that encountered previously when visiting London, but it was the top standard on offer.  the benefits associated with such accommodation included access to the Regency Club lounge with computer, internet access and food and beverages available from 7.00am to 11.00pm every day. We found the staff in this area very pleasant and helpful with local knowledge to assist the visitor readily given.

The hotel dining facilities were excellent with the lounge area offering breakfast and food and refreshments all day, but added to this is a fine dining restaurant, ""Montagu"", separately accessed within the property. ""The Churchill Bar"", also separately located, offers comfort and quiet surroundings for a relaxing respite.

Separately located also is Georgio Locatelli's prestige restaurant which is recognised as offering arguably the finest modern Italian/European cuisine in London. This restaurant is separately operated from the Churchill.

Overall, the Churchill staff were polite, efficient and extremely helpful, with the doorman, Bobby, a memorable character,  There is absolutely nothing we would fault with this hotel and  we recommend it to all who enjoy comfort, elegance and traditional ambience and courtesy.

150,The WORST hotel in which I have ever had the displeasure to stay,"If it were possible to give this hotel 0 stars I would! Never ever again will I stay at such a dump!

I booked to stay at The Churchill due to its location, which was close to meetings on both days of my stay in London. Judged solely and purely on location, and NOTHING else, the hotel is fine.

However, on all other counts Hyatt should be ashamed of this hotel and consign it to history and I urge fellow travellers - business and tourist alike - to avoid like the plague! I travel often for business and have never been asked to pay so much for a room in London in 12 years of travelling (even taking inflation into account). In all honesty, even when company policy was to use so called 3.5 or 4 star hotels, I have stayed in better hotels that this hotel. That this hotel proudly proclaims itself as a 5* hotel is an absolute joke!

As a Hyatt Regency hotel I was expecting the hotel to be of the same level as other hotels in the same Hyatt chain. I was bitterly disappointed. 

For GBP420 (a GBP40 premium on the lowest room rate) I paid for a View Room hoping that this would at least have a nice view over Portman Square. Nothing of the sort. My room had a view was of the side street towards the North end of the hotel...breathtakingly boring and certainly not worth a GBP40 upgrade.

Now, as for the room, where do I start?! 

(1) Tiny...absolutely tiny. There was hardly enough room to fit my suitcase on the suitcase stand.
(2) Decor was cheap and tacky and badly maintained.
(3) Tiny desk on which to perch a laptop together with an old-fashioned chair that was completely impractical
(4) The MOST uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in during a hotel stay in 12 years of travelling - seriously a bed of nails would have been more comfortable
(5) A bathroom you couldn't swing a cat in and a bath you couldn't drown one in.
(6) noisy surroundings - bins were emptied outside at 0600 every day and because the room was so tiny every movement in the corridor from the cleaning staff arriving at around 0700 through to drunken guests returning to their rooms at 0300 became part of the price you paid for the mistake of staying at the hotel.

And to cap it off. I have never been met with such complete indifference when asked at check-out ""how was your stay?"" to which I gave an honest and reasoned response. The indifference was as good as having been told ""Thanks, we robbed you, we don't care...now thanks and[...]!""

Well there you go...AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. Shame on you Hyatt!",1,2013,11,01
150,Montagu Restaurant,"Party of 6 to the restaurant for dinner on Saturday night.

Started in the bar, where the service was friendly and efficient.  Seating is comfortable and although it's not large for a hotel of this size the room is very comfortable; there is also a good outside terrace with heaters and blankets which looks inviting even in the  autumn months.

The restaurant has an open plan kitchen which seemed highly efficient.  Our food was rather good and the wines (Chablis and Shiraz) were also good.  Generally the service was good although slightly less efficient than the bar.

Oxford Street is just a few steps away so the location of the hotel and restaurant is first class.",4,2013,10,31
150,Lovely Property with Service Flaws,"We stayed here one night in October 2013.  We were very excited about the hotel, as it looked from the photographs online to be absolutely lovely.  We were booked in a club floor room.  Overall, I left the hotel disappointed:  while the facility was gorgeous, service errors undermined the lovely facility.

Let's start with the good news:  the hotel is elegant (at least on the interior; the exterior is nothing fancy).  The lobby feels sophisticated and chic; fresh flowers smell fantastic and look beautiful.  Our room was very nice--a nice sitting area, a working area, a very comfortable bed, and a well-appointed and elegant bathroom.

Although the room looked great, it had some issues:  one of the phones simply didn't work, and the iHome device (which has the alarm function) was in the living room while the analog alarm in the bedroom was broken (dials on the back broken off).  I find such a lack of attention to detail in a five-star property irritating.

The bad news:  service.  Prior to our stay, we received an e-mail from one of the hotel's managers inquiring about some contact information (with the reason being that by providing it in advance, we would not have to provide it at registration, saving time) and if we needed anything prior to our stay.  I responded immediately with the requested information and asked for some advice about restaurants.  We received no response prior to our stay.

Upon arrival, we were told that the private check-in on the club level was busy, so we checked-in in the lobby.  Despite the e-mail assuring us that by providing information in advance, we would not have to do so upon registration, we did--I had to provide it all again.  Furthermore, no restaurant recommendations were ever provided by the hotel.  Although the gentleman who checked us in was nice, he was SLOW and lacked confidence--registration took nearly 15 minutes, which is excruciatingly long.  

When we went to the club lounge after getting settled, we discovered that the registration clerk had not keyed us correctly--despite being club-level guests, he had not configured our cards to allow us access to the lounge.  I went up to the concierge desks outside the lounge, where three concierges were involved in a transaction with one (annoyed) guest.  I was initially ignored, despite being the only other customer.  One then said, without so much as looking up from his computer, ""how can I help you?"" and I explained we couldn't get into the lounge.  He then said, ""swipe your card in the door.""  This is where the minor irritation of the miskey turned into an outright annoyance--I cannot stand being treated like a child by hotel staff who won't even do me the courtesy of looking me in the eye.  I have stayed in hotels many times (in fact, nearly 50 nights this year in Hyatts alone...), and I know how to swipe a card in a door.  I said, ""it doesn't work,"" which prompted him to take down my name, information, etc. (again!) and re-issue the key.  When he did so, he didn't bother to (a) establish eye contact, (b) apologize for the inconvenience, or (c) walk us over to the lounge.  Obnoxious and hardly the level of service I expect from a property like this.

The lounge itself was nothing special--it was over-crowded and under-staffed.

After dinner (we found our own place, since the hotel had ignored the original request), I went back to the lounge to grab some water.  This time, the three concierges were all at their desks.  Despite no guests other than me being in the elevator lobby, none of them could be bothered to so much as look up from their computer screens and offer me a ""good evening.""

So, it wasn't a great experience.  If you're looking for an elegant hotel, stay here.  If you're looking for service that matches the elegance of the physical property, look elsewhere.",3,2013,10,17
150,Sex and the City Afternoon Tea - Perfection!,"A long overdue catch up was arranged for myself and my best friend who had abandoned me and moved to Bath so in order to make the day a little more special I booked the Sex and the City afternoon tea at the Hyatt Regency. Conveniently located a few minutes walk from Oxford street we were really looking forward to a little glass of bubbly and some sweet treats after some significant shopping.
Greeted on arrival by a smiling member of staff, our shopping bags were whisked away with our coats and we were shown to a lovely table by the window. Offered our choice of champagne, cocktails or tea (or coffee) to begin we decided we had earned something sparkling so started with the champagne. The service was excellent - the same waiter tended to our every need throughout our sitting, refilling glasses, cups and plates subtly as we chatted. 
The food was lovely. Not your traditional afternoon tea, sandwiches replaced with bagels and rye bread, scones usurped by succulent mini burgers and hot dogs (these were refreshed 3 times!) and a sweet plate full of cupcakes, appletini jelly and a decadent shoe made out of chocolate!

If you are after the perfect girly afternoon with a twist then this is it! 

If anyone wants to take me again I'm free!!!",5,2013,10,17
150,Great Hotel in a city with a lot of cramped and not so nice hotel properties,"Anyone who has stayed in London over the years has seen the prices go up and the quality far behind.  Our last stay in London at the Sheraton was a total disappointment as the room was a dump and very very small which is a problem with a majority of London hotels.  Star ratings are questionable and one has to hold their breath until they open the room they are staying in.
In the case of the Hyatt Regency Churchill the star ratings matched the price and the quality.
As the last reviewer said the hotel is very comfortable and of good value.  I was amazed at the size of our room. (I am a diamond member of their program so that might affect room location) The room was quite large for London and well laid out.  The bathroom a good size and I love the fact they provided oversized plush towels.  Nothing bothers me more than to find skinny towels and a tiny bathroom.  The room was quiet and I heard ZERO noise off the street.  Again another plus considering this was a London hotel.  The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were just right.  I just rated the Sheraton in Vancouver BC and the beds at that property felt like they were WWII left over POW beds.  Miserable.
The lobby and restaurant off the lobby is quite nice and popular with locals for meals.  The staff were friendly and cordial.  Service is very formal here and staff are well trained.  
I had access to the club room as a diamond member and the breakfast food was decent to good. The evening canapes were a bit disappointing but the cheeses and breads good.  My biggest beef with the club room is that they did not offer decaf except for the nasty instant stuff.  I just don't understand it.  I had read in a previous review that someone complained about this fact in their review and the hotel response was that they would deal with it.  I gather it has not trickled up to the club room.
So great rooms, comfortable, great location off a very busy Oxford Street and you will enjoy the restaurant.  
My only minor beef was with room service.  I ordered it three times during my stay and it seemed something was missing each time.  When I ordered food the second night, I mentioned in ordering the club sandwich again that the previous night the bacon was missing - the orderer said nothing.  No apology or anything.  The last night the hamburger I ordered was cooked to death and no mayo with the mcdonald fries that came with it.  The previous two nights the fries were killer - excellent but the last night it was clear they had run out and were using the skinny fries you get at McDonalds.  So if you order the hamburger be sure you ask them not to cook it death.  The quality of the beef was good.  Very surprised actually.  
Now this sounds petty but when a club sandwich with fries cost you $40 then you have a right to expect it to be as ordered and not missing items or cold.",4,2013,10,14
150,Comfortable & good value,"The hyatt Churchill London overall is a very good hotel however there were some minor details which I thought was strange for a hotel of this caliber. 

Great points: 
Excellent location within walking distance of a tube station and near selfridges with multiple shops nearby. 

Comfortable sized rooms with very comfortable beds. Nice clean deco rather than fussy which is always a plus. Very nice thick plush towels and bathrobes. Good amenities. I think Hyatt as a brand has done very well to provide the ""Hyatt has it"" service whereby you can request for certain items (eg shaving cream and shaver) or borrow items (hair straighteners, curling irons etc). 

Very good value for money considering the rooms, service and amenities and location in a central part of London but not in an area which is noisy. 

Smooth and easy check in and check out process. 
Concierge has been helpful in providing assistance ith restaurant reservations and advice on itineraries around London. 

Areas that can be improved upon: 

This is me being picky BUT: 

Being woken up by housekeeping to clean your room DESPITE the fact that you are checking out that day indicates that there is a lack of communication between managerial staff and the housekeeping department if they don't know when you are going to check out. 

No newspapers provided the whole time I stayed at the hotel. I was tempted to steal a copy from a next door neighbour but resisted. 

Unable to comment on the restaurants as did not eat at the hotel. 

Overall, great hotel but some areas that still need improvement.",4,2013,10,10
150,London Hyatt,"we used our chase saphire points to stay 2 nights on our 1st trip to London.  Excellent hotel, though the weather was quite crumy: cold , rainy int he midst of summer.   The staff was very helpful w/ providing directions/umbrella etc. ",4,2013,10,10
150,Nice but not extra ordinary,"Stayed for two nights. Location could be more convenient - the closest tube is a few blocks away. Room is pretty small and so is the bathroom (though it is in london); however, they are well appointed, but nothing so special for the value. As Hyatt diamond, breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvre at the club lounge were my favorite feature at this hotel. Full service and nice selection of spread.",4,2013,10,10
150,"Excellent service, pricy but some flaws!","The welcome at Reception made us feel as if we were the only people in the world. Brilliant! Very helpful staff in all departments. The room (King Size bed overlooking Portman Square) was spacious with an excellent 'office' section, wifi, etc. Despite overlooking the street, the triple (maybe quadruple) sound glazing was so effective we did not hear a single vehicle during our entire stay.  That said, there was a fair amount of door banging from other guests along the corridor (not much the hotel can do about that). A cup of coffee and a glass mug of hot chocolate for my wife in the bar cost £11.25, which seemed excessive even for an upmarket hotel in our view., but no doubt targeted at a wealthy clientele. Our only real complaint was that the bedside lights could only be switched on or off when the hall light was on. If you switched off the hall light, all other lights went out as well. When my wife tried to switch off the hall light, she had to grope her way back to bed in the dark, and then was not able to switch her bedside light on to read. 
Otherwise, the hotel lives up to its reputation. We attended a special function and the food provided was superb. As regards breakfast, whatever your tastes, pretty much everything you could imagine was provided - fresh fruit, yoghurts, nuts, hams and meats, cheeses, muffins, Danish pastries and excellent cooked breakfasts as well. The eggs are always cooked fresh, which means they often come separately from what you have previously chosen from the mushrooms, tomatoes, bacon, and potatoes counter. Overall, a most enjoyable experience.",4,2013,10,09
150,Very comfortable at The Churchill,"The Churchill was very comfortable however it is pricy but then again it is in the heart of London. It was extremely clean, the staff were courteous and professional. The location is very central, just around the corner from Marble Arch and the Tube. If you walk over about a block and a half you come to Baker Street and there are a selection of eateries around there (eating in the Churchill  can be a little pricy). If you walk another half block further you can get to the Wallace Collection. I don't think our room was as large as the Hyatt in Paris but it was large enough nonetheless with slippers and fluffy dressing gowns included.",5,2013,10,08
150,"Amazing service, beautiful facility","A five star hotel that truly lives up to its five star rating
I am constantly amazed by the level of service offered by Hyatt and this Hyatt Regency in London was no exception.
Immediately upon walking through the front door and into the lobby one is met with an elegance, sophistication and charm not typical of most hotels.
My parents were traveling with me and as such a roll-away bed needed to be brought into the room. Between the ten or fewer minutes it took to check in and walk to our room, the roll-away was already set up. 
My parents wanted to see a production while in London so I asked the concierge who told me there is a theater coordinator who takes care of this sort of request but she was gone for the day as it was nearly eight in the evening.  He left a note for her to call our room the next day.  Without fail, the woman rang us later that next day and had taken the liberty of setting aside three tickets for the show we wanted to see that evening.       
It was quite rainy one of the days we walked around London and our shoes had taken a toll.  We left a couple pairs outside the door of our room and the next day they were back on our feet looking clean and refreshed.   There was no charge for this service. 
One night I had difficulty connecting to the Internet. I called Guest Services but they were unable to resolve the issue so they called the actual Internet service provider who worked through the issue with me and connection was reestablished.  I've never had this level of service provided by a hotel before.
The beds, as with any Hyatt I've stayed in before were amazingly comfortable and the pillows were perfect. 
There is a sizable charge for connecting to the Internet but as a Hyatt Platinum member they wave this fee which is a nice perk.
The location of the hotel is a five minute walk from the red line, Marble Arch subway (underground) stop.  From where we went in town, we generally had to transfer once or twice from different subway lines in order to get back to Marble Arch but it wasn't an issue as the tube runs quite smoothly.  The hotel is in a nice part of town but it is a lengthy walk to get to the areas where most of the tourist sites are to be found. Piccadilly Circus is about 20 minutes by foot.  Westminster Abbey and Parliament and about 30 minutes at a decent pace.  I highly recommend taking the bus or the tube.  I walked from the far side of the river Thames near the HMS Belfast (WWII ship now moored along the river as a tourist attraction) back to the hotel and it took about an hour and a half at a brisk pace.",5,2013,10,06
150,Very Pleased,"We were recently part of a tour group that stayed at the Churchill.  Our room was fine - clean and quiet.  We looked out over a restaurant - would have liked a park view but since we were part of a tour, I did not ask if that was an option.  I agree with some of the others, the lobby was, at times, chaotic.  My one complaint is that my husband drinks only decaffinated coffee - he always had to wait as though it is only brewed upon request.  I cannot believe that only one customer requests decaf.  Our one dinner there was wonderful and the staff attentive - especially since we were a group.",4,2013,10,03
150,Great Recomendation,"I was recommended to stay at The Hyatt Regency The Churchill by a friend and how pleased was I that I took their advise.  The location, the service and friendleness of the staff was second to none and then to find Molton Brown in the bathroom was fantastic and made my day.  i would definately use this hotel again and would recommend that anybody looking to stay in a first class hotel in London chooses the Hyatt.",5,2013,10,03
150,Fabulous London hotel,"We had three nights here at the end of a long European family holiday. We had two wonderful, spacious (for London) rooms. The hotel was in an amazing position, was modern and the staff very welcoming. The breakfast buffet was incredible and free for children age under 10.

Otherwise, the Churchill was excellent, and we will definitely stay there again.",5,2013,10,02

150,A hotel for smokers,We were booked into this hotel on a pre cruise package. The rooms reek of cigarette smoke. We opened the windows and sprayed the room with deodorizer.

It was wonderful!,3,2013,09,25
150,Great lunch in the Montague,"Visited here with friends who live locally, last Sunday for the Champagne buffet lunch and it was very much worth every penny. The quality of food, staff and everything else was all to an extremely high standard. The waiting staff were all extremely attentive and knowledgeable. The drinks were constantly topped up at no extra charge, so I would suggest you don't drive yourself. We left our luggage here as we were staying somewhere else nearer to a venue we attended the following day. A lovely afternoon spent with friends in a lovely setting.",4,2013,09,24
150,Perfect location,The Hyatt Regency never disappoints you. This one I can highly recommend if you enjoy shopping at Oxford street. Nice building and rooms and the just perfect bed with lovely soft bed sheets and fluffy pillows. It was very nice to stay there,4,2013,09,21
150,"Just ok, good and bad points. Read before booking.","First of all we looked at this hotel and thought great a proper British hotel it's called Churchill has a picture of the queen at reception a bust of Churchill in the foyer etc. However, this is in no way a British hotel, everyone but the conceive that we spoke to was foreign most could not speak decent English.  This in general isn't a problem but if your coming to London expecting this to be a British hotel because of the name and pictures etc you may be disappointed.  In fairness most London hotels are the same.

Next the hotel is very expensive for what it is.  We normal stay at a hotel on the next street it is a third of the price but I think nicer, unfortunately it was fully booked.

On arrival the check in was great when we got up to our floor the corridor smelt of cigarette smoke and on entry to the room it was quite musty, we opened the window and throughout our stay had the joy of other guests smoking out of their windows and it drifting into our room.  

The view from our room was a brick wall about 6 feet away, I asked to change rooms and was told unless I paid more money none was available.  Next we tried to turn on the tv, after calling to reception the engineer was summoned the tv had been turned off at the socket, this was impossible for us to get to as it meant moving the whole tv cabinet/minibar fridge etc.....why was this done?

Next we had bottled water next to the bed, was this free or £5.00 as was the water in the minibar?  So I rang what was marked as reception on the phone (I don't know who this goes to but it's not and never was reception) a lady answered and in broken English said she would find out if it was free..we waited, eventually she came back and said ...she didn't know!  But she could put me through to reception she said...I said I thought you were reception ... She said something unit eligible and I gave up. 

Next we had a late sand which after seeing a west end show.  We went to the hotel restaurant and the food was awful the bread was stale in my sandwich .... The next morning we went into the same restaurant for breakfast, we were sat right next to the toaster.  Right listen....if you get sat next to the toaster right near to the hot buffet refuse the seat, seriously I spent the whole of my time being nocked by customers and staff I even had waiters carry trays of food over my head (check your CCTV) incredible! Not only that but we were asked if we wanted coffee and  waited for it to arrive in the meantime we saw people getting the buffet breakfast we had no idea as we had not been asked or told you could order breakfast, so I took a small English breakfast there were no hash browns no beans no fried bread no tomatoes available  so just had sausage and bacon the waiter arrived and asked if we wanted a cooked breakfast, it might have been easier to explain this first!

The house keeping was good our room was always clean and tidy and we left a note with some money asking for extra milk and this we got.  Also the rooms are well appointed.  There is free wifi although for broadband you have to pay extra.   The car park although small worked for us and the car park guards were always very nice. 

In summary there are many nice hotels in this area.  I don't think I would visit this one again, as too many things spoilt our time there.",3,2013,09,16
150,Another fabulous stay,"We have just returned from another fabulous stay at this beautiful hotel. We were upgraded to a suite as repeat visitors which was a lovely surprise and the rooms were huge, with the children having their own lounge and bathroom! The club lounge was lovely and served delicious pastries and canapés. I was surprised by a waiter delivering a card, champagne and a birthday cake which topped off a fabulous stay. We would definitely recommend this hotel as they certainly value their guests.",5,2013,09,15
150,not a great 5 star,"stayed at the hyatt regency this week and was very excited to be staying at a luxury place with my girlfriend. Great location but was surprised by the reception which was noisy, everything close together and messy. 
Room was small but comfortable but quite a few kids runny up and down the corridors with noisy mothers shouting after them late at night. Rich foreign kids making a noise at 12 pm opposite my room so had to get security up. Maybe just unlucky.

I enjoyed my stay by getting out and about but not like other 5 stars I have stayed at.",4,2013,09,15
150,What a disappointment!,"I have stayed at the Churchill for business and pleasure many times in the past and loved the hotel. However, this time the stay was a total disappointment. The concierge was eager to help but not very knowledgeable in planning activities,  the room looked tired, the towels were stained, the restaurant that has always offered great food felt like an expensive diner and on one occasion unaccessible for breakfast due to the number of people waiting in line through out the lobby. Lastly, in a city with so many beautifully decorated hotels the changes in the lobby and  bar were sadly unimpressive. Oh well if Hyatt does not care about maintaining their standards, fortunately there are many other hotels in the city to try and explore.",2,2013,09,13
150,Luxury Hotel London,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hyatt Regency London- The Churchill.  We were there pre-cruise and spent 3 nights.  I have to say it was a great hotel.  The room size quite large for a European hotel room.  It actually was a king bed and we did a rollaway as well for the kiddo.  This hotel was top notch.  Great service, lovely room and the breakfast buffet was better then expected and kids can do the buffet 1/2 price.  On one side of the hotel is a park.  Just a few blocks away is a shopping area with many restaurants to choose from and shopping.  Overall a great experience.",5,2013,09,11
150,Stay in Churchill,"My stay in Churchill was great. The rooms were very comfortable. The bathroom was also nice. The hotel restaurant was expensive for breakfast. Would suggest that the breakfast be provided with the room charge. 

The ambiance was nice and location is very convenient.",4,2013,09,09
150,Just nice... In every little way!,"Having stayed here a few times, I've grown to love the hotel, the ambience and of course the excellent hospitality. My favourite here is the beddings, the best so far for me in London (yes, I'm very particular with the matresses as I have back pains). Location is great too, walking distance to Oxford St and convenient for public transport. 

Restaurant is nice and the service is good too. Only thing, it is a bit pricey for the room size, but it is London afterall!",5,2013,09,05
150,Lovely hotel,"We had a great stay at the Churchill.  My husband and I had a room adjoining one with our two teenagers.  We had a nice view of the little park across the street.  The rooms were very comfortable.  The bathroom was also nice.  Room service was fast and good.  The hotel restaurant was pricey and slow for breakfast.  The ticket desk was very helpful in getting us good tickets to two shows, but the process was very slow and he was unable to work his printer.  The woman who checked us into our room was very gracious and friendly, but another member of the front desk staff was unpleasant, calling our room to say that there was a problem with our credit card and to come to the front desk immediately.  When we did, the woman who checked us in said that there was no problem whatsoever and she didn't know why he had called us.  The hotel location is great.  Many good restaurants are in walking distance.  I think it would be great if they could have a little store for bottled water and necessities, but otherwise they have everything.  I would recommend this hotel highly.",4,2013,09,04
150,Second bad experience at this hotel!,We were giving the hotel another chance but will never stay there again!  We were supposed to get a room overlooking the park on the club level but that did not happen.  Instead we got a room that was surrounded by rooms of screaming children.  They would scream and play between 11:00pm and 2:00am!  I complained to Dirk the first night and he said he went and talked to them but did not help much!  Happened every night after that and the hotel mgr finally offered to switch our room on the last night of our stay and at that point it was too late. We had been out all day and got the msg at 8 pm!  The same thing happened to us last time when our rooms were filled with cigarette smoke every day! Ugh! Never will stay there again!  The one person who did a great job for us while we were there was Pearl in The Concierge Lounge.  She was wonderful.   However the room was mediocre and the bathroom horrid.  The shower was in the tub with only half of a shower door! the water would spray all over the bathroom and get everything wet! Ugh!Also the fitness center was horrible - equipment way out of date and no weight machines. The internet was slow and hard to connect to.  We paid way too much for what we received! Hotel was also overcrowded and understaffed! Will never stay there again!,2,2013,09,03
150,Perfect business hotel,"Stayed for a week in 2009.
If you are on your business trip to London, this is the hotel. Clean, stylish and good service. The hotel is located few min walk from oxford circus/bond street/marble arch and  in center of central London. You can cab to anywhere in central London for dinners and meetings.
I heard some next door sound while on my stay, but aside from that, no complaints. Obviously not for vacation or romantic purposes, but if you are looking for the comfortable place to stay for a week, this is the one. Bar next to the lobby is quite useful as well.",3,2013,09,01
150,Probably the Best hotel in London...five star family style,"Right from the doormen (George Bobby and Ian...thank you)  the staff on the executive floor to housekeeping and the bell desk, this hotel reflects the best that London has to offer. Children are welcomed and catered for (separate lounges for family and business travelers). Great location, fabulous lounge for coffee and landlord to one of the great Italian restaurants. The GM has done an amazing job, keeping standards high and hiring staff that make you feel welcome

Thank you..there is a long list",5,2013,08,30
150,Superb,"The Churchill is perfect. After lot of research we as a family decided on the above and didn't regret one bit. The rooms are nice especially on the 7th floor facing Portman Square Garden.
Location is right next to Oxford st and Selfridges. Didn't try the restaurant but sublime Piano in the evenings. Would definitely recommend. Special thanks to Helena Coutts, Victoria and Monika (at check in).",5,2013,08,30
150,Comfortable and Stylish,"The Hyatt Regency London is located at Portman Sq which is an ideal location for shopping and sightseeing. 
The hotel has a very international feel and service from the doormen to houskeeping is outstanding. 

Lobby is busy but comfortable. The dining at the hotel was surprising good. 

Rooms are understated but comfortable. I would highly recommend upgrading to the Regency Club Level as the serivce is outstanding with special check in and lougne priviledges. Facilities are great for a family vacation. 

Well done Churchill!",5,2013,08,29
150,Churchill,"This was a great hotel. We had amazing service with great rooms. Staff was great from  checkin to concierge to room service delivery. And the room service was super for a tired family of 5 with amazing quality of food (best fish and chips in 2 week Europe trip) and flexible for picky kids. The only reason not giving 5 stars is because we were ""upgraded"" but no one ever asked us if we wanted an upgrade. So the breakfast in the club level lounge was convenient but as a platinum level member free breakfast should be included. The upgrade was a significant increase in cost that my husband did not notice when we checked out. I'm hoping that we can resolve after the fact but too bad to tarnish an otherwise exemplary stay.",5,2013,08,28
150,Long weekend in London,"Stayed in early July for Coronation Festival with family staying in a suite and a club room. Friendly ,professional and efficient check in,exemplary service from all staff throughout. Food excellent and if you feel like going out to eat there are many bars and restaurants nearby as well as excellent shopping.(daughters were wowed by trip to nearby Selfridges food hall ) Thank you to all The Churchill Hyatt for a great trip.",5,2013,08,27
150,"Great location, excellent service and impeccable facilities. Always enjoy coming back recently for the 4th time.","Stayed with my family at the Churchill several times over the last 3-4 years. Always look forward to returning. Hotel takes great care to handle all details whether its theater tickets or how to get somewhere on the tube. They even lend you umbrellas at lobby if required. Specially recommend upgrading to Concierge level floors.  It's a true bargain given the access to two lounges open 24 hrs and which serve complimentary hot English breakfast, afternoon tea and early evening hot canapés, wines, proseco, etc.",5,2013,08,27
150,Weekend at The Churchill,"We had a weekend break at The Churchill for my husbands birthday.  Check in was very quick
and although we were early, a room was ready for us.  very nice overlooking the square and gardens.

We were going to eat at Covent Garden but due to the weather we returned to the hotel on Saturday evening to eat in the Montague - very good indeed. Service, food and ambience all good and very relaxing.

Breakfast was great, although my husband had an issue with the tea being far too strong (a serious matter for a tea drinker) - a jug of hot water brought to the table, to allow for individual taste, would sort that out though.

All in all a very nice weekend.",4,2013,08,26
150,"First time in London, had a great experience.","The service exceeded our expectation and helped us enjoy our first time in London. It was located conviently near a tube stop, bond, Oxford street, and the marble arch. It was in great walking distance to everything. If you are in the Hyatt members club, the regency club was very nice. The concierge was extremely helpful and kind. Their recomondations were great. We arrived early into London and our suite wasnt ready yet so the conceirge gave us a temporary room to rest in so we didn't have to wait in the lobby. I highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling to London in the future.",5,2013,08,25
150,"Great hotel, location and service","We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in our first time in London, the location is great  its very close to the central line Marble Arch, two blocks from Oxford St,and 5 minutes from Paddington Station.
The food in the restaurant ""The Montagu"", delicious and the service was impeccable.
I highly recommend staying here, I can't wait to come back.",5,2013,08,24
150,Great Stay,"My husband and I stayed here on vacation and were really happy with the service, cleanliness, and all around atmosphere of The Churchhill. In addition, the location of The Churchhill is great - it's very close to the central line Marble Arch tube station which makes it easy to get around the city. I highly recommend staying here!",4,2013,08,22
150,Great Hotel and Service,"We stayed here for a night and cashed in some hyatt hotel points, so the room was free. It was a great stay, and we also got upgraded as we've been staying in Hyatt hotels quite a bit.  The upgraded room was stunning and had 2 separate toilets - which is a first for a hotel room that I've stayed in!",5,2013,08,22
150,Very Nice Stay,"I stayed  with my wife in one of the club rooms for three nights, using my Hyatt points. Checkin on the club floor was very quick and friendly. There were two club lounges, one for business and one for families, we used the family lounge and it always had seats and plenty of breakfast or snacks. Wireless was free, not sure if that was because of the hotel, club rooms or my Hyatt status.  

We didn't try any of the restaurants, there are many great restaurants within a five minute walk. The tube station (Marble Arch) was about a five minute walk.",5,2013,08,22
150,Nice but expensive,We stayed for a week during Spring break. We were on the Regency Club floor. It was definitely worth it. The breakfast and cocktail hour were delicious. Room was average size and very clean. Service was attentive.  Location was a little far from tourist attractions- had to cab it everywhere. We ate dinner in the dining room. It was delicious but pricey. ,4,2013,08,21
150,Lication and staff are great,I stayed in many hotels in london and other countries but the best housekeeping and reception staff are here always smiling and greeting.housekeeping cleans the room very well as well. Been here since 10 Aug and will depart 28 Aug really enjoying the hotel,5,2013,08,18
150,Great location,This hotel was very close to the metro. We stayed here two nice of our European honeymoon and we would recommend to anyone visiting London. Great size room for Europe! Staff was very friendly and remembered us when we checked out.,5,2013,08,16
150,'Hope to stay there again,"Perfect stay, with exception of hotel staff slamming guest room doors *throughout* the day, when I was trying to sleep off a bad cold.  (No problems with noise in the evening/nighttime.)  Wonderful restaurant staff & concierge staff, excellent breakfasts, squeaky-clean guest rooms, convenient location.  'Hope to stay there next time I visit London.",5,2013,08,15
150,A great hotel so well located.,"This is my return stay in the Hyatt and the hotel is just as good if not better it was in my last visit. I am impressed with its cleanliness, it's ambience and great service. I love the hotel's proximity to Marble Arch and Oxford St. What's new this time is the ""For your convenience list"" in the club floor room where you can tick what you need in the list, and it will be delivered. Some items like make-up remover and ladies lifestyle magazines are for you to keep, while others such as yoga mat and phone chargers are on loan. I also like the fact that the Hyatt Executive Club Floor has two lounges, one where children are allowed and the other just for adults. Overall the Hyatt is a great hotel for me.",5,2013,08,12
150,"9 Nights, Wonderful Stay","We are just back from spending 9 wonderful nights at this hotel.  The location is great, easy to access all the major sites.  The staff makes the hotel.  We arrived very early and since our regular room was not ready, we were upgraded to a view room.  We had 3 of us staying in the room and we were surprisingly pleased that the room wasn't very overcrowded.

We had breakfast in the hotel every day, which was quite good. Excellent selection of fresh fruits, and tradtional English offerings.

Convenient to Oxford st, Marble Arch and Hyde Park.

Very confortable beds and the room was spotless.",5,2013,08,11
150,Love this Hotel,"Just 200 meters from Oxford Street this Hotel could be in its own little village... location is excellent for shopping and relaxing but there is next to no traffic around the Hotel. Each morning my wife and I started our day with a run around beautiful Hyde Park just 5 minutes walk from the hotel main entrance, then after a relaxed brekky in the Regency Club (In the company of a seriously famous Rock Star) we took Bo Jo's Bikes that are so cheap they might as well be free... 10 minutes cycling to famous Notting Hill, 15 minutes cycling to Soho and Covent Garden, 15 minutes cycle to the Greatest Museums in the world, 30 minutes to Camden Market... Back in time for cocktails in the lounge, the rock star was there again! The newly renovated rooms are excellent, Locanda Locatelli is one of the great Italians in town... This is the Must Stay Hotel in London, ask for a room with a view of the garden... and make sure you get Club Access... Top Tip, the Lounge has 2 rooms... the lounge on the left is child free...!",5,2013,08,11
150,Best service,"We were booked into another hotel close by,but because my husband has an interest in Churchill history,we decided to go to the bar at this hotel.  What a pleasant surprise.  The staff were 100% for looking after your needs.  Mind you, we were only having drinks here.  Their training by Hyatt really is a credit to them.  They were unbelievable.  Just the little added extras that came with the drinks, and as soon as the bowl was empty, they would replenish it.  This is while you are still on your first drink.
Very attentive. Couldn't fault them. Even when my husband asked the waiter about one of the 'Churchill' photos, he took the time to explain, without a hint of wanting to move on.
The next day we decided to have dinner in their restaurant instead of having dinner in our tired old hotel down the way from Hyatt. What a pleasure it was.  Without a booking, we were seated straight away,  and all our needs were attended to in a very professional manner.  Felt very comfortable and welcomed.  And not rushed at all, unlike some restaurants.
The food was to 'die for'. Absolutely perfect.  My husband chose the salmon for entree and the duck for main.  I had the duck liver for entree (which was a bit of a risk as I had never had this before). And the cod and chips for main.  All were cooked to perfection.  Could not fault this restaurant. So sorry we hadn't booked the accommodation here.  Will be booking on our next visit, even though the accommodation has mixed reviews,  the bar and restaurant are number 10 in my books,  would take a chance with the accommodation.
Congratulations.  This is what we have been looking for in all our trips through Europe. 
Will be back",5,2013,08,10
150,Feels close to the royalty,"I spent 3 nights at Hyatt - The Churchill. It was great to feel a bit of the britain tradition and courtesy! Check-in was efficient and very friendly my room overlooking the park.Comfortable bed, spacious room and bathroom with lots of toiletries!
 There was a good atmosphere in the hotel throughout my stay, the entrance foyer and ""The Montagu"" were busy but the staff was  so pleasant and professional. We seat at the bar one night and enjoyed a tradicional cocktail and great conversation with the friendly barman. 
Great service especially helping with tourist information definitely The Best Concierge team I ever seen.
Location is great for shopping in Oxford Street or exploring neighborhood.",5,2013,08,10
150,Convenient location in heart of shopping district,Very good security at the hotel. Service is only 3 mainly on account of the front desk staff being totally stoic and moody during checkout. A very small gym. Breakfast menu is limited. Not a place where you could have breakfast daily if you Are staying more than 3 days.,3,2013,08,07
150,"Great location, small rooms, tiny bathroom","Stayed one night here whilst visiting the theatre.  The location is excellent, just behind Selfridges and opposite a pretty square.  We were meant to have a 'View' room but this was disappointing, the view was of the flat roof of an adjoining building, not sure we actually got a View room.  The bedrooms are quite small, but the bed was huge and the linen was good quality.  Also the air-conditioning is very efficient.  The bathroom, however, is tiny, just the length of the bath, so only one person can get ready at a time.  Also the toilet flush was weak and you had to wait an age for it to fill up again.

Reception staff were efficient but not overly friendly.  I found the breakfast disappointing.  They have the cold buffet at one end of the restaurant and the hot buffet at the other, which is an unusual set up.  The restaurant was large and noisy and had more of a feel of a canteen.  The food was ok but nothing special.  Children were running round a bit and one child was licking the serving spoons by the pastries so I could not have any of these.  Not the hotel's fault, I know, but still offputting.

All in all, I think this is more 4* than 5*, in fact I have stayed in 4* hotels that I prefer.",3,2013,08,05
150,"Acceptable, But Disappointing","Very disappointing.

First, the reception desk employees are VERY stuck up, to the point of rude.  They were much too busy chatting with each other than helping people out in line.  There were 4 receptionists, 3 customers waiting in line, but only 1 was being helped.  WTH?

Second, because only one person was actually helping people, check in took forever (over 20-25 minutes).

Third, because of our loyalty status with Hyatt, we asked for and received late check out until 2pm.  At 12pm, the housekeepers kept walking by and checking in on us.  I called down to the front desk and ask them to confirm we had late check out.  Well, even though I had confirmed it the night before, the front desk person said I had to confirm it again despite being told that this wasn't necessary the night before.  Whatever.  The whole thing was annoying and rude.

Fourth, the rooms are shabby.  They are clean, but they are old and shabby.  For this caliber of a hotel, the rooms should be pristine.

Fifth, I slipped and flew up in the air and landed on my hip bone IN THE TUB.  My own fault, I guess (I was wearing shower slippers).  However, the tub lacks any kind of non-slip grip or traction like you'd see in other hotels.  So shower-ers beware.  Don't wear shower slippers, you'll probably slip & fall.  The tub is also super high up so it was hard to get in and out (I'm short).

The location is amazing for shopping on Oxford Street, but the Marble Arch tube station is a hassle.  There's just too many staircases, and too many levels to navigate before you get to an actual train.  It's also not on a line that's convenient to anything other than the British Museum. 

We later moved to the IC Westminster and much preferred that hotel, its location and the St James Tube station instead (St James is on the Circle Line, so its much closer to Trafalgar  and other central areas).

SKIP IT.",3,2013,08,04
150,Great location and good service...but we lost a Teddy bear,"This is a great choice! The location is perfect for those who want to experience Oxford Street and the Hide Park area. Close to two tube stations: Marble Arch and Bond Street. The service was great and the rooms (not that big) were always clean. My daughter lost her teddy bear in the room - was an old and special toy. The management tried, a lot, to find it, contacting the laundry company and so... That was the only bad point, in overall it was a perfect stay.",4,2013,08,03
150,Beautiful hotel in prime location,"The photos online don't do this place justice. Was so pleasantly surprised. Excellent short cab ride from Paddington station (where the Heathrow shuttle train get in) to the hotel which was tucked onto a quiet square just steps away from Oxfords Street/Marble Arch.  It pays to have Hyatt status and I also used my Hyatt credit card! The check in staff were so friendly and went out of their way to accommodate me for an early check in after my long haul flight. The room was freshly renovated, tasteful and airy. Some great touches were the high end linen, the fluffy terry robe and the US voltage plugs also at the desk.  Ipod docking station and climate control.  Loved the Molten Brown toiletries too, the lovely lady from housekeeping was every so kind and left me a few more for my stay. Everyone i met was very friendly and the place was clean and efficient. My only issue was as a lone female traveler I tend to like a safety chain on my door and there wasn't an inside lock at all. Also - great powerful hairdryer but nowhere in the bathroom to plug it into, had to take it to blow out my hair at the desk in the room.   Certainly would stay here again, makes sense to have a Hyatt card too as you get free WiFi etc",4,2013,08,02
150,Best Hotel in London,"In general I like to stay in Hyatt where and when I can. The number of hotel under Hyatt is much less comparing to Marriott, but when I find one, I go to Hyatt. This time in London, we found the Hyatt - the Churchill, we had the same excellent experience as we have had in other Hyatts. Best of all, it is in a prime location that enhances our first trip to London. We love the city and like very much the hotel we stayed.
The lounge on the 8th floor offers a good variety of drinks, and small food for happy hours. We took our breakfast there too; the food quality and selections are also good.
There is something that other Hyatts don't have: hanging on the wall in the reception area, there is a massive picture of the Queen, surprisingly her eyes were closed. It caught my attention. The next day when my wife and I came back to the hotel from our evening walk in Hyde Park nearby, I asked the duty manager, standing in the hallway with other two staff members near the main entry, about the picture. ""What is the story behind the Queen's picture?” The manager said ""Sir, there is no story, just a photographer took pictures of the Queen and he realized after that in one of them, the Queen closed her eyes.” ""No story?"" I was a bit disappointed. Then the guy (maybe he is a doorman) stood next to the manager joined the conversation: ""Sir, there is a story: the Queen came to our hotel and stayed in our luxury suite for few days, and when she saw the bill, she closed her eyes."" He is a good comedian; he imitated someone's facial expression when she cannot afford to pay the bill. We shared a good laugh.
That is why I like Hyatt, I feel home there, home away from home.",5,2013,08,02
150,"Great location, poor service","I wish I could have had a pleasant stay in this hotel like some recent reviewers of this hotel. Aside from its fantastic location, the staff on the ground floor seemed too busy to serve us. When we arrived with three big luggages, nobody was bothered to greet us or to help us with our bags. They kept us waiting so long to check us in. The bellman hardly opened the door for the guests, not just us, from what we noticed. The worst part is that when we called the concierge, he asked us to come down because there were too many people in front of him, that's what he said. We are truly sick of such unprofessional response coming from from a Hyatt hotel employee. 

We have stayed in many Hyatt hotels in the USA and Asia Pacific countries. Their services were superb, all staff were really helpful. They even approached us when we stood or sit around the lobby a bit long and they made sure that we were alright. No such service was offered in this hotel. 

Really disappointing.",1,2013,08,01
150,Great Hotel and Professional Staff,"Everything about this hotel was 100% professional and courteous ... from the moment you stepped into the lobby you felt like a celebrity.  Front desk was extremely efficient and polite, bellmen were readily available, every possible effort was made to receive you properly and get you to your room in an expeditious but not rushed manner.  The rooms were excellent - updated decor and very clean.  The restaurant was excellent (see my other review) and once again professional and courteous staff.  Definitely on my list of top 5 commercial hotels to stay in London.",5,2013,07,31
150,Perfect Stay,"We (my husband, daughter and I) stayed at the Churchill for our recent London leg of a London/Paris trip.  Booked a regular room (which can only accommodate two people) and upgraded to a Regency suite with an suite upgrade certificate (which can accommodate three people).  Because of our platinum status with Hyatt, the hotel actually put us up in an executive suite which was perfect. It had a sofa bed in the sitting room and an extra half bathroom which was a big bonus with three people.  The lounge access with breakfast in the morning and hot/cold drinks available through out the day made our stay extremely comfortable.  We stayed in London on both ends of our trip and went to Paris in the middle of the week.  The hotel kept our extra luggage so we didn't have to travel with all our suit cases.   The location was excellent.  The Tube station (Marble Arch) was an easy walking distance and there is plenty of interesting shopping and place to eat nearby.  The best way to get to the hotel from Heathrow is by taking the Heathrow express train to the Paddington train station and then taking a taxi to the hotel.  I would highly recommend upgrading for lounge access.  Will definitely stay here again when we visit London again.",5,2013,07,30
150,You've got (no) mail,"Nice room facing the park. Nice decor. a couple of things needed fixing : loose toilet seat, flickering lights in the bathroom. The staff at the reception is particularly lovely. The Italian restaurant on the premises is delicious. love the neighborhood on the edge of Marylebone, a residential area full of charm.
The hotel has a two level internet service. one high speed you have to pay for and a free one that is incredibly logy and most infuriating. These days all hotels should provide free high speed Internet.",3,2013,07,30
150,I've Come Back...,"Having posted a negative review in December, I think it is only fair to give praise where it is deserved. I have been back to The Churchill in the past month and the service was fantastic. All the staff were eager to help and the service was excellent. It has certainly made me book to return.",5,2013,07,29
150,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We stayed on the Club floor for one night last weekend. The Club reception staff were friendly and welcoming. The Club lounges are for the exclusive use of guests staying in Club guest rooms. In the morning there was a very nice continental breakfast range to choose from including some hot items and delicious pastries. Early evening, a selection of canapés, cheese and drinks are available all of which are included in the cost of the accommodation. The rooms are nicely furnished but a little on the small side and ours did not have any view but this is the case with most London hotels. Montagus restaurant in the hotel serves excellent food in modern surroundings, we opted to sit at the open kitchen counter to get a full view of the chefs in action and enjoyed a great dinner. Overall a very nice experience and I would recommend it for a central London location.",5,2013,07,29
150,Excellent in every way,"We recently had a fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. The staff was fantastically friendly and always ready to help, especially in the restaurant, where they never had any problem regarding our special diets. Both soy milk and gluten free alternatives were provided without hesitation.
However, the food was very expensive, even for a five star hotel, which was a little disappointing. The same problem occurred on the terrace outside the bar. It is a lovely place to sit outside before dinner, but one has to spend 25 pounds or more to sit there! 
The hotel itself was big and elegant, very pleasant to come back to after a long day in hectic London.
Our room was pleasant, very comfortable and actually quite reasonably priced considering the hotel and its surroundings.
We will definitely come back another time we stay in London, and would recommend this hotel without hesitation!",5,2013,07,28
150,basic hyatt don't expect much.,"This is a very basic 5* hotel, no luxury or special thing there.
location is ok not more. the rooms very standard and service is reasonable. 
We are waiting for a park hyatt to open in London, as diamond members we will never return here.
the lounge at the 8th floor is great very good breakfast and afternoon tea, as well as a shower for anyone leaving late or arriving early.",3,2013,07,27
150,Excellent in every way!,"I absolutely love this hotel. perfect location, extremely classy and very beautiful. I have stayed many times and adore this hotel. The Bar and Restaurant in the hotel are top-notch. Definitely worth staying here and you will not regret it!",5,2013,07,26
150,First class comfort and convenience!,"We just returned from a trip to London (and Paris).  We stayed at The Churchill for 5 nights and found it to be an excellent choice!  We arrived early (9:30 am) and the friendly staff had a room ready for us to check right in.  That was great since we had been traveling through the night and were exhausted!  Our room was clean and nicely furnished - it was a decent size and had a king size bed and all the usual amenities (After all I had heard about tiny hotel rooms in Europe this was a pleasant surprise!).  The staff was very friendly and helpful - there was always at least one or two doormen out front and it was no problem getting a cab at any time.  The hotel restaurant was also good; our room rate included breakfast daily -  a full buffet with plenty of hot and cold options and good service.  We were located close to Hyde Park and the Oxford Street shopping district.  Selfridges department store (of the recent BBC mini-series fame) is a couple if blocks away and so is a good pub called, ""The 3 Duns.""  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again if we are lucky enough to return to London in the future!",5,2013,07,24
150,Fantastic in every way,"We stayed for eight days in a Regency Suite, #908. The excellent service started the moment we were picked up at Heathrow in the hotel limousine.  We were quickly assisted to the car by the very courteous Steven, who chatted comfortably with us regarding the nature of our visit and pointed out a few landmarks along the route to the hotel.  We were checked in on the 7th floor and took breakfast (having arrived at 7am) in the Regency Club until our room was ready.

The hotel itself is conveniently located within easy walking distance to Oxford St and Marble Arch tube.  There is a key available if you wish to use Portman Square which is opposite the hotel. This provided an excellent diversion for our active 9 year old daughter. We booked tickets to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the theatre desk, and were very happy with our seats.

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff of this hotel.  Our room was facing away from the park, and we could not believe the silence when we were right in Central London.  The staff on the club floors were personable, friendly and accommodating in every way possible.  The room service was prompt and tasty. The breakfast choices in the RC were both plentiful and extensive.

All in all, this is a wonderful choice for a week or so stay in London.  We loved it.",5,2013,07,24
150,Extremely comfortable,"Supremely comfortable rooms and excellent bathrooms. Rooms aren't huge, but sufficient for a couple of nights' stay. One drawback is the slow lifts. Otherwise, hard to fault a single thing about this hotel.",5,2013,07,23
150,Excellent stay! Highly recommend,This hotel is in the perfect location (Mayfair) two blocks from Oxford Street and three blocks from Hyde Park.  The staff and attentiveness of the service what 5 stars.  The best part is the ridiculously cold air-conditioning we had in the rooms because London had an unusual heat wave when we were there.  Love this place. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.,5,2013,07,22
150,Glorious hotel with nice location,"Very nice, classic hotel with well appointed, comfortable rooms. The Club is especially nice with great food and service. Had a very good meal at the restaurant as well.  Quiet location and close to Hyde Park. ",5,2013,07,17
150,Excellent and a good location,Stayed at The Churchill for a pre-cruise overnight.  Nice facility.  Convenient location--tube a block or so away.  Walk to Marble Arch and shopping.  Room was ready when we arrived at 8 AM which was great.  Included breakfast was first rate.  Room was clean and nice decor.  Helpful staff.,5,2013,07,15
150,Excellent rooms...sorry food and beverage,"This is a great hotel location for London attractions with clean and very nice rooms, however the attitude to the guests leaves a lot to be desired.  There is a general rip off mentality for food and drinks. An example is the early closing of the cafe area, (on a Saturday night just as two huge events in town had finished) so that customers had to walk and fetch their own drinks from the Churchill bar next door...a small point, but at $10 for a small Heineken, insult was added to injury by the automated addition of 12.5% service charge. (for going and getting your own drinks)  After asking for this ""discretionary"" to be removed I was ignored.
This was just an example of staff being a little too aloof....I felt we were an imposition.",3,2013,07,15
150,Perfect,"We stayed here on 13th July for one night, we booked through last minutes secret locations and to find out this would be our hotel, we were so happy! We were staying in London as it was our 3 month wedding anniversary and as we are yet to have a honeymoon, this was our 'mini moon'....the staff were made aware of this and were so attentive and willing to make our stay as special as possible, we went out to the theatre for the evening and upon our arrival back we were welcomed in our room to a bottle of prosecco and a cake...this was very unexpected and such a lovely treat....the bed was so comfortable and massive, the views are so lovely you forget you are in central London, such a fab location. The breakfast was amazing too, such a large and tasty selection. My one regret is not having afternoon tea on the Sunday but we had to get back to our boys, I have heard amazing things though, so a great excuse to go back! Thank-you hyatt regency for such a wonderful stay!",5,2013,07,15
150,Nice Location. Convenient London Hotel.,"The Churchill is a classy hotel, stayed a couple nights in between trips.  Hotel is what I expected.  Has old world charm and a very international client base.  Conveniently located north of Hyde Park – was able to walk to most tourist destinations and restaurants in Mayfair. Selfridges is around the corner which is convenient.  Breakfast in the hotel is great. International buffet where you can pretty much have anything you want.  Running in Hyde Park is an option, but the hotel also has a gym that is basic, but never found anyone in it.  The rooms are clean and comfortable – will continue to stay at the Churchill as a base for London travels.",4,2013,07,14
150,Outstanding customer service if not so much the amenities thus overall too expensive for what it is.,"Pros/Likes:
- Check-in was fine and our room was ready at 1:00 pm when we arrived but took a little bit longer than usual because it was an employee's first day.
- Check-out was quick and efficient.
- Room was nice with modern decor and of decent size with two comfortable twin beds.
- In-room coffee, safe-deposit box, robes, and slippers.
- Room had one American-style electrical outlet.
- Mini-bar refrigerator had ample space to put in your own beverages.
- Alarm radio with iPhone docking station though not for iPhone 5.
- Big flat-screen TV with several channels in English, about a fourth of the channels in Arabic from a variety of countries (including Oman and Sudan), and then some channels in Spanish, Russian, French, Portuguese, and Chinese.
- Good location close to Oxford Street with lots of shops and an 8-minute walk to the nearest tube station.
- Came back to our room on the evening of the 4th of July to find a plate with a sign saying ""Happy 4th of July"" along with a mini-pecan pie and sugar cookie in the shape of the American flag...what a super nice touch!
- Loved the daily lunch specials for £11.50; one day we had fish pie and another day we had shepherd's pie, both very good.
- Sunday brunch was equally nice though expensive.
- Excellent though expensive tea time with awesome sandwiches and pastries.
- Newspapers in English and Arabic were available on each floor and in the lobby.
- Staff were super nice, especially at the Montagu Restaurant.

Cons/Dislikes:
- Well, the building won't get any beauty awards...ugly on the outside!
- Small bathroom and the bathtub did not have a curtain but that dreaded plexi-glass half-divider that causes the floor to get wet when taking a shower.
- The bathtub was high (knee length) so consider this if you fall easily or have knee problems.
- Bathroom had no electrical outlet (other than for shavers) so had to plug in the hair dryer outside.
- No pool/spa.
- Water leak (drops every couple of seconds) woke me up one morning at 6:00 am, apparently from the air conditioner, though was fixed promptly upon being reported later that morning.

Neutral:
- Gym had mostly cardio equipment with some free weights and unisex showers/changing rooms.
- Had free internet, presumably due to my Platinum status, otherwise prices start at  £17.00 /day.

Miscellaneous:
- Received e-mail from the hotel a couple of days before check-in date to ask for confirmation of room preferences, check-in time, and other info.
- There were some places to eat nearby but not as many as you would imagine based on where the hotel is located.
- Still a four-star facility but at five-star rates.

Impression:
Outstanding customer service if not so much the amenities thus overall too expensive for what it is.",4,2013,07,13
150,Great service and good location,"Even though the hotel is situated right in the middle of the Oxford shopping area, it is actually two blocks north of Oxford St and therefore a little removed from the hubbub which is a blessing.  Check-in was very quick and the receptionist even noticed that I had a Chinese last name and provided a very well-made booklet explaining all the services in both Chinese and English.

The room itself was a decent size with a nice sitting area, but the bathroom was on the small side.  Lots of items like the electric kettle and etc were tucked away in cabinets and drawers, so you might have to search for certain items.  Coffee and tea were complimentary which was great because I was suffering from a cold at that point and was drinking several cups of tea a day.  There is no ice machine, so I had to call for a bucket to be sent up, but the service was very quick.  The glass door walling off the shower only extends for half the length which makes for a somewhat awkward situation; I don't understand why they don't just go the full length or use shower curtains.

Nonetheless, I had a great stay at the Hyatt and would return next time I'm in London.",5,2013,07,13
150,Worth a look,"I only stayed here 1 night, but it was worth it.
The hotel is in a nice location only about 3-4 blocks from Oxford street the main shopping area, but it has the feel of been in a more rural location. This is helped by the hotel been across the road from a park ( but it must be said that this park is for local residents only ).
The welcome was very good and even though the reception was busy they were quick and you were made to feel very welcome.
The room was very nice , large bed and the small seating area was nice also.
The bathroom was small but this is London and I have been in smaller that cost more.
We had lunch in the hotel which was on offer , 2 courses for £20 which was good value.
There was also a small jazz band playing which added a nice touch.
Breakfast was takin in the room and this along with room service was fantastic also.
I would stay here again as they go out of their way to make you feel relaxed and welcome .
If you need to be at the top end of Oxford street or near to Marble Arch then this is great hotel, a bit far from the west end but I am sure the hotel could arrange to get you a taxi from the many that stand outside.
As I say we'll worth a look.",4,2013,07,09
150,A disappointment,"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel recently. The room was disappointing to say the least. It felt dated, and maintenance was poor (eg the shower hose in the bathroom was partially detached and water kept gushing out). Also, the glass shower screen covers only about a third of the length of the bathtub, and is simply not practical if you are tall (as I am). Needless to say, water ended up on the bathroom floor whenever I took a shower. The room standards are simply not those of a Hyatt. The saving grace for the hotel is its F&B outlets, which are very good. However, given the price that the hotel charges for its rooms, I would much rather stay elsewhere and just dine at the Churchill.",3,2013,07,07
150,Hyatt Solid,"We arrived at midnight as our Dulles-London flight was delayed 2 hours. Nevertheless a solid welcome and a beautiful suite. Excellent concierge floor breakfast as well as the usual great happy hour beverages and snacks. Lovely bar and terrace restaurant (we did not have time for dinner there) - and terrific location - away from the hub bub but minutes from Bond ,Oxford and great shopping. No its not the Hyatt Vendome, (not much is), but we were pleased and enjoyed our stay. By the way we have the best tour guide in London if you are interested.",4,2013,07,06
150,Great but...,"after staying at the Hyatt Vendome in Paris just a few nights earlier the Hyatt in London was a bit of a letdown.  The concierge was a bit stuffy and in Paris, since we are Gold members we were shown to our room, given a brief tour of hotel and made to feel special.  Not so here in London.  Nothing to complain about, but not awesome either.  Couldn't care if I return.  We didn't  get a chance to eat at the hotel and the location was very good.",4,2013,07,02
150,"Great location , Good breakfast , best doorman but ........","The hotel has a great location just 2 minutes from Oxford street and underground stations only 5 minutes walk , rooms are spacious , TV channels have all channels from around the world they even have TV channels from Sudan and Morocco , the breakfast is a Buffett of fine selection and the orange juice was perfect, 100% real juice, the doorman George is an icon for that hotel , very helpful and informative , rooms are equipped with tea/coffee facilities, bath robes, slippers, safe, sitting area, on the negative side carpets are stained , the view of my room 262 was horrible especially for £288 a night I expected a better view but my view was nothing , the food menu for room service needs an upgrade to include more variety , the hotel all in all is fine but could get better deals on price with the same quality or even better .",4,2013,06,30
150,Great visit,Rarely have I visited a hotel where everything went well. Two rooms for five nights with three nights on each room on points and two rooms for two nights to be paid for and an early arrival you would think would create some issues. Not the case here as the hotel handled everything well. The concierge desk was great having arranged pickup and departure to and from the hotel to the airport and giving advice on tours and sites was excellent. Also an excellent location near Oxford Street and the sites. The rooms are perhaps a little small and the fitness room a little tight but who cares as the big items were accomplished flawlessly. If I come back to London I would definitely stay here again.,5,2013,06,30
150,very good location,"We  have stayed at many hotels in London but for location this cannot be beaten.  The room was fairly standard for this class of hotel it was very clean and  had a comfortable bed and excellent bed linen,  breakfast and dinner were really good and without a doubt the location cannot be beaten. We drove and parking at the hotel was easy and fairly priced it cost us £40.",5,2013,06,30
150,Absolutely wonderful!,"In June of 2013 we began our vacation by staying at The Churchill, it was a nearly perfect stay.  The reception was quck and the bags were delivered to our room within two minutes of our arrival.  The three of us were in a club level room on the 9th floor with two balconies, and it was very spacious by any standard.  The wi-fi was fast and reliable.  The A/C was silent and cold.  I have travelled extensively and this was the quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  
The location is great for shopping, the tube and Hyde Park are only a short walk away.  
The club level food was excellent!  The complimentary salmon at the Hyatt was better than the salmon at the caviar bar at Harrod's.  There was always an attendant at the club and we took advantage of the complimentary water, soft drinks, beer, wine and spirits.  
We had one small issue, the hotel offered us a complimentary meal at the restaurant, it was simply terrific!",5,2013,06,29
150,An excellent hotel in the centre of London,"I stayed with my wife for holiday for 4 nights. I used some of my reward points for this. We stayed at the club floor which is supposed to be floor 8 but got a room at floor 7 with access to the lounge. I am not sure why, but floor 8 would have been more comfortable not having to use the elevator every time we were going to the lounge.
The mini bar was only coke and soft drinks.
The breakfast and the food att happy hour was good. All the staff were very nice. The room was very clean and Molton Brown products in the bathroom was appreciated. 
The restaurant was excellent and the bar almost as in the old days, but smoking was outside.
In all - very good holiday.",5,2013,06,25
150,Great stay in London,"I was at this hotel in January 2012, and the stay was great! The reception was very polite, the breakfast inside the hotel was great, with a lot of choices. I have two kids, and when I arribes at my room there was two chocolate lollypops as a courtesy. It was so kind! Every night, there was a bottle of still water and another bottler of soarkilng water. The only thing that could be improved was the room size. It is a little small for 3 persons. The location is great is walking distance from a tube station, Selfridges and a lot of shops restaurants.",5,2013,06,23
150,Pre cruise hotel for Crystal Cruises,"We had a pre-cruise option to tour Leeds Castle with Crystal Cruises.  The London Hyatt Regency Hotel  with a standard room was part of the package.  I had read about the club rooms at this hotel and asked for an upgrade-what a smart move! We like having everything we need under the same roof.  The hotel was beautiful but the food in the club room was varied, beautifully displayed, delicious, service was excellent and at night wine was served! We walked 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel to see The Wallace Collection.Beautiful and it was FREE!!  Don't miss the Leeds Castle-well worth the cost and time.",5,2013,06,23
150,A slice of Heaven for a reasonable price,"We had a magical stay at The Churchill Hotel. The bed felt huge and incredibly comfortable! We ate lunch in the Churchill Bar which felt like stepping back in time to a 1920s oasis from the busy streets. The bar staff were slick and made us feel very welcome, we could have spent the rest of the evening there. The breakfast buffet was delicious and we were keen to try the cheese from Mayfield and the yoghurts from Rye...good to see local(ish) produce being championed. 
During our stay we received Outstanding customer service from Victoria in reservation who was a wonderful ambassador for the hotel. Secondly, Monika, at breakfast was Outstanding, I have never seen a more courteous, relaxed, smiling member of hotel staff so early in the morning! She went out of her way to make us feel special.",5,2013,06,23
150,Stayed here for three weeks - explored most amenities,"As a long-term guest, I was sure to try every amenity available. The rooms are average-sized, but one particular thing I enjoyed were the high Ceilings. Try to get a room facing portsman square - they have extra soundproof windows in addition to the regular ones that keep your room quiet during all hours. 

The beds are plush and soft - love the mattresses and linens. The bathrooms however are a bit odd in the sense that there's no shower door or curtain, but a half-divider sort of thing that ended up in spilling water all over the floor unless you set the waiter pressure to a painstakingly low level - they're more meant for a bath, but still have a door separating the actual bathroom/shower from the room. 

Breakfast is good, with a variety of a la carte options in addition to a fairly pricey buffet option - I usually went with specific items for better value. 

The staff is extremely helpful and room service are always polite; top-notch customer service. 
I echo the other reviews in terms of location -  wonderful area and close to Oxford street. 

Finally, the gym is more of a small workout room (4 treadmills and weights fit only for an aerobics class), and be sure to pack your own toothpaste - none is offered.",4,2013,06,23
150,Great location and club level offering,"This hotel is always my first choice in London because of its great central location, at the same time being on Portman square it's just far enough away from the stampeed of people on Oxford street. The rooms are mordern, and while I would recommend this hotel regardless the club floor really makes it for me. The made-to-order breakfast is great, even though the buffet style spread of of breads, cereals, cheeses salmon etc would be more than enough. Included drinks and hot snacks in the evening is also a much appriciated touch.  We're also always happy with the service, the staff are always doing their best to help, not always the case in London hotels!",5,2013,06,23
150,Homely stay,"The Churchill has been one of my London ""homes"" for the last few years and I always feel at home there because the service is excellent. I always booked on Club floors, where the lounges and breakfast and snacks are great. This Hyatt is comfortable, being homely. You can request for amenities via a Menu and even things like a hair brush are free for the asking. Internet is free and fast. The Oxford Street location is handy for shopping. This Hyatt Regency ranks with the Paris Madelaine as one of the tops in this brand and it is as comfortable as a Park Hyatt.",5,2013,06,22
150,Location!,"So close to Oxford St and wonderful wandering neighborhood. Friendliest service, Montagu restaurant a delightful surprise for quality, creativity and taste. Room a bit tired but quiet, comfortable, dark.",4,2013,06,22
150,Excellent - Love love love,"What can I say about The Churchill? After an extensive search for the perfect wedding location, we decided to go with The Churchill and we're so happy we did as everything was perfect.  The wedding organiser, Elizabeth Martins was nothing short of militant (in the best way possible), she was on the ball, as were the rest of the staff.  Just one example of how great the wait staff are; at the wedding dinner, they would watch for people to leave their table, to visit the toilets, and only when they return would they bring their food out - meaning the food was always kept hot.  They noticed one vegetarian who didn't eat their starter and offered a replacement immediately without prompt.  The service really is brilliant.  

We returned for our one year anniversary this June (as part of the package when we booked our wedding, we were offered a room and dinner free of charge) - the staff were again spot on.  We had a knock on our room door shortly after arriving, with a welcoming bottle of Prosecco, water, happy anniversary cake, and a card welcoming us back!

The hotel is clean, staff are excellent and friendly and I can't recommend this hotel enough! Also, there's the extra bonus of having access to Portman Square which is a beautiful garden!",5,2013,06,21
150,Love it,"As probably everybody knows that London is Big city and lots of hotels but Hyatt Churchill is special if wants deluxe services and professional you will find it there start from check inn I can't believe it that reception give me upgrade to junior suite without asking the room is amazing TV channels for everybody bed comfort is super bath shower is tip top , breakfast buffet is absolutely perfect nice bar for lovely drinks location is very central and walking distance to Oxford .

I work in tourism business and always try to find comments to any hotels I stay but this one really I love it.",5,2013,06,20
150,Great location,The hotel is more like a 4 star hotel and definitely not a five star hotel. It is only 10 minutes from Oxford street (best shopping area of London). The rooms are a bit tired for a five star hotel. The doorman is very knowledgeable and very friendly but the front desk staff are a bit cold.,4,2013,06,20
150,fancy!,"last year, it was my first time in London and my family took me to this hotel. WOW! that's all I have to say. When I came in, I did not know what to say! I miss this hotel so much. The food is excellent and the location, too.",5,2013,06,19
150,"What a lovely surprise, and in London...","Let me start with, for whatever reason, I have never felt that warm fuzzy feeling when I've traveled to London in the past, but, thanks to the Churchill, I've found a fondness, and now I understand why loads of people I have met actually love, London... 

I was on a multi country trip, and London was my last stop, and Im so glad I made London my last stop as it was the last two days of the 100th anniversary Chelsea Garden Show, more about that later. 

After a hellish flight to London, no fault to BA but rather a flight that had taken off from Heathrow needed to turn around and execute an emergency landing that morning, thus shutting down two landing strips and backing up Heathrow like I've never seen before! So when I should have landed at 1pm and arrived to the Churchill by 2pm I ended up arriving much later and this delay sorta threw some of my well planned activities a bit askew. But let me say, I kept in touch with the Churchill and they where on top of all the necessary changes that needed to be made. 

Ok, I finally arrived to the Churchill and a lovely gentleman opened my taxi's door and welcomed me with subtle reassuring warmth, I knew all the drama from my flight was over and could exhale and relax. He took my bags and showed me to the reception desk. Here I was met with a lovely smile and again with a calm subtle voice asking my name, and after giving it to her, she informed me I had a private club level check in on the 8th floor and escorted me to the awaiting elevators, and up I went. 

Upon arriving to the 8th floor I was again welcomed by two jovial staff members to check me in and show me around the very lovely two sided club lounge, then it was off to my suite, just off the main 8th floor lobby. My accommodations were quite nice, small from what I'm used to, but it's London and by London standards it was quite generous, so no complaints just my observation. The suite had everything I wanted and needed and the safe was large enough to handle my MacBook and for whatever reason I always like to just lock it all up and forget about it till my departure. 

Now, the Churchill's Club level is amazing, the size alone was overly impressive one side for everyone, including children, and the other side for everyone, NOT including children. Each lounge well appointed, cozy, comfortable and so clean and well organized. The many different daily presentations were bountiful and scrumptious to say the least!!! I did however learn that the lounge that allows children had the presentations I most wanted, it's the one as you get off the elevators on the right, but both are wonderful, and only vary slightly. 

So my arrival at the Churchill was report-card perfect, my accommodations lovely, the club lounge(s) perfect, so my brief 3 night stay was perfect! My only regret is that I can't give you the names of every staff member that showed me such warm professionalism morning, noon and night at the Churchill, so I have to thank them all. 

While booking my brief stay, I, as I always do, emailed the property with all my wants and needs and I never had to wait more then an hour for a reply. I wanted to know about the Chelsea Garden Show and Im so glad I did. Now there are two separate concierge desks at the Churchill, one for theater shows and major events and one for your needs within the hotel and restaurants and activities such as the London Eye, ATM'S etc... Each concierge desk is over the top friendly and their knowledge amazing, enough said. They secured me tickets to a few things, pointed out the nearest ATM, and many quite cafe's and quaint street to meander around and ooh-and-awe at homes, the one I'm most grateful for, was the Chelsea Garden Show. If you know nothing about it, look it up and if you are ever planning on a trip to London in May, plan it around this week long show, that is, if you're remotely, slightly, kind-of interested in things that grow in dirt. 

While in London I planned on seeing a few friends and I thought it would be a treat to reserve  the Chef's Table at the Churchill, and even though the Chefs Table seats 6+ people they were gracious to allow me to reserve it for less. Now I booked it for my arriving day and as you know I was delayed, but without hesitations the Montagu took all my difficulties and turned them into solutions, this was all the doings of Ms. Sarnue, she is a rockstar in my book and went to great lengths to make my arrival dinner with dear friends perfect. The Chef's Table is really kind of cool, its bar hight not regular table hight, and it's right on the edge of the amazing open kitchen, very cool, but, if you are warm bodied when its over 68 degree's,  you might have an issue sitting here, like I did. Unless Im on a beach or poolside with a cabana staff member to order drinks from, I like it a comfortable 68 degrees, and at the Chef's Table you feel the heat from all the tasty morsels being prepared, thus after 15-ish min, I asked Sarnue, if we could move to a table, and without hesitation she took care of the issue. Now, I hate to say anything discouraging about our dinner, but while sitting at the Chef's Table, as brief as it might have been, the Chef, a lovely female Chef, never acknowledge me, or the table and that was a disappointment, maybe just for me, but I'm a huge foodie and I love meeting and learning what the Chef enjoys preparing, so I can order what they recommend. However, I ordered the Dorado and ended up licking the plate clean, and dreamed of every bite during my most pleasant slumber back up on the 8th floor.

I woke on my last morning, quietly entered the lounge that allowed children, thus I was the only sole up this early, I devoured a scrumptious breakfast, freshened up for my long journey, then I swiftly checked out with the club lounge concierge and headed down to my awaiting car and off to Heathrow's T3. While sitting in the car, riding smoothly through the London streets, light after light as it was a bank holiday and almost not another car on the roads with us, I found myself looking back on my 85 hours in London and finally realizing why people love this city as a destination, and now I look forward to going back to London. However I will plan long layovers when I have connections through Heathrow's T5, and reserve a night or two, maybe three, and without a doubt, I will be back at the Churchill. 

I thank each and everyone who made me fall in love with, not only the Churchill property, but city as well. I will be back!

Travel can be tough and tedious, so be kind to your fellow traveler and be smart, safe and enjoy the experience's in front of you.

150,"Superb location, great service","This is a superbly located hotel, particularly suitable for business stays, and if there are a couple of hours to spare, can still dash to Oxford Street for a quick shopping. Close to public transportations, and Hyde Park and the iconic Marble Arch are a leisurely  five minutes stroll away. Staff is generally and helpful.  Maybe less cost effective for families on long stay.",4,2013,06,17
150,Outstanding 5 star hotel,we had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for 3 nights as part of a 2 week vacation in Europe and we enjoyed the first class clean rooms.  As nice as the facility was; the employees' friendliness and desire to help created a very comfortable environment for us.  The hotel is in a lengthy walking distance of many historical sites but we would advise you to really map your walk because it is pretty easy to get lost.  London is not the easiest city to get around.,5,2013,06,17
150,Very convenient location and good service. Will come back again!,"This was my first time staying at this hotel and overall it was a great experience.  Checking in was fast and efficient and the rooms were clean and comfortable.  There was a but of paint smell as some floors were under renovation, but it was bearable.
Everything was clean and comfortable and the service was generally very good.
The location is convenient to all shopping along Oxford street, selfridges etc.
All in all a pleasant stay!",4,2013,06,17
150,"location, location",Wonderfully located next to the opera house and walking distance to several historical sites and restaurants.  Staff is courteous and knowledgeable.  Public transportation close by.  If a nonsmoker avoid the 3rd floor.,5,2013,06,12
150,The devil is in the details,"I arrived at the Churchill's on a Sunday. No one to open the taxi door and to help with the luggage. Actually the bell boy was too busy having a chat with a colleague. I had to call him for my luggage to be taken care of. I was however nicely welcome at the check-in desk, and the process went smoothly. Was brought to the elevator (and not to the room). Once in my room, I waited for my luggage that did not arrive before I decided to leave the room about 20 minutes later. My luggage was then delivered while I was away. I found it in the middle of the way, not even on a luggage rack or at least on the side of the room.
My room was a regular one, decently large for London, with a large (and comfortable) bed, a small desk and an armchair. Regular amenities (coffee and tea station) but no water (I got once a couple of small bottles during the week). Free basic wifi, not allowing any form of streaming or voip communication. Faster service is available, but at an outrageous extra cost (about GBP 20 per day). The bathroom was all right. But for some reason housekeeping believed that they could simply replace the shampoo with an extra shower gel... Not quite the same. 
Turn-down service was provided. Well, what this hotel calls turn down is limited to the deployment of the bathroom carpet! No opening of the bed, no closing of the curtains, no carpets by the bed, no special attention...
Breakfast was very good. Please read my comment there: http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d730392-r163120568-The_Montagu_at_Hyatt_Regency_London_The_Churchill-London_England.html
There are a couple of restaurants in the hotel, The Montagu (reviewed above - this is where the breakfast is served) and the Locanda Locatelli, an Italian restaurant that was full on the evening I wanted to try it. The bar is nice too (http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4324602-Reviews-Churchill_Bar_Terrace-London_England.html).
So if this was a four stars hotel, I would have been delighted. But from a five stars, I expect a reliable and high level of service. In addition, I think ""going the extra mile"" is intrinsically linked to the hospitality business. Nothing of that sort at the Churchill. Luxury hospitality is about details. And this is where the devil is.",4,2013,06,11
150,"Lost a bit of its luster, but Location and Staff make up for most shortcomings","The Churchill is a landmark London hotel for very good reason.  The property is located within a short stroll from Oxford St / Marble Arch as well as Baker Street and is walking distance / short cab ride away from many of London's shopping and dining attractions.

The hotel is years away from the days it held boasted itself as the hospitality icon it was in London, and is in need of a shot in the arm to catch up to a dearth of lavish properties all throughout the city.

The staff and location of this property is what gives the Churchill its stature and prominence, but the rooms / finishings feel a bit tired and old, while the rooms are nothing special (above and beyond a high-end business hotel).

Good place to stay if you find a deal on the rooms and are not spending too long in London.",3,2013,06,09
150,"On balance, pretty good","I stayed at the Churchill last weekend for two nights in a Regency Club Room using Hyatt points (so I caveat my comments are based on not paying anything for the stay).

I arrived very early and was checked in efficiently and offered a room well ahead of normal check in time which I appreciated. The rooms themselves are nothing special but have all the traditional amenities - comfortable bed, sitting chair, functional desk and table and nice TV with wide channel selection. The bathrooms in classic London style are tiny and unerwhelming but the Molton Brown toiletries are a nice touch.

The real attraction of this hotel is the location which is top notch - one block from Selfridges and the main shopping drag on Oxford Street, one block to Park Lane and Marble Arch. 

The Regency Club lounge is pretty good with two venues and a decent quality albeit smallish selection of breakfast items and canapes in the evening. A few choices of red and white wines plus spirits in the evening with a good selection of mixers made for a nice start to both evenings there.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay and think the location is fantastic so seems like a good choice for business or pleasure.",4,2013,06,08
150,Better find elsewhere,"I stayed at this hotel from 31/5-6/6, in room 820, and room is a bit small, but ample as it was a suite. Location is excellent, the park is at the front of the hotel where kids can go and play. My only complaint i have is the staff at the club lounge, from day 1, at breakfast, is i asked for hard boil eggs, and was told by staff that only eggs available are at the buffet. However, i overheard another patron asking another staff, for omelette, and the staff obliged. One guest heard my conversation with hubby about the staff who rejected our order earlier, and said the hotel has weird service at the club lounge. Anyway, i must say other staff at the lounge have been friendly and could take order of hard boil eggs,  not a big issue at all. Today, again the same staff, again rejected my order for hard boil eggs, and even said as of today we charge. Funny coz she rejected the order on 1/6, and again on 6/6. It must be her own policy. 

Overall, hotel stay is ok, could be better, with more friendly staff. We stayed at intercontinental london before and kids received welcome kit, but not at this hotel. ",3,2013,06,06
150,100% Highly recommended,"This hotel is outstanding. The rooms, service and food exceeded our expectations. The Regency club was an excellent added choice we made and were very happy with all it provided. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Thank you to all staff at the Hyatt Churchill for making our stay wonderful.",5,2013,06,05
150,"Fine Hotel, Standard Rooms, Not Best Value in London","This is part of a continuing series of my impressions and experiences staying at various hotels and resorts while traveling to attend concerts worldwide. This stay was during my extension trip throughout Eastern Europe and London in May and June 2013. This review is for the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill.

Property: Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill
Location: London, England
Address: 30 Portman Square, London W1H 7BH, England (Marylebone)
Phone: 011 44 20 7486 5800
Website: www.hyatt.com
Room Type/Class: Standard
Date: May 29-31, 2013
Booking Source: Direct (utilizing two free Hyatt nights)
Overall Rating: 3.5/5 [Note: Score is totally subjective based on price, location, and comparison to ""like"" properties within same area and price range]

I selected this hotel because I had earned two free nights (anywhere worldwide) with Hyatt that were due to expire, and this was a fairly pricey property in London.

The location is quite good, if you want to be near Bond Street, which is a big tourist attraction.

As I expected, the staff were all exemplary, and the check-in process was very smooth.  However, as an aside, days leading up to my stay I received an e-mail asking for any special requests, etc.  I was scheduled to review a concert the night of my check-in, switching from another London property, so asked if I could check in a few hours early...  at noon instead of 2:00.  I was told, ""I would like to inform that early check in is possible with a extra charge of £160 it is package which include breakfast on the day of the arrival and guarantee of early checkin"".  I thought it was crazy to pay essentially an extra $200US to check in just two hours early, and never received any response.  Many nice hotels in London charge less for an entire stay.

The lobby and property at large is kind of a stuff, British atmosphere (which is pretty much what I expected).  There is a very nice restaurant on site, but I did not have time to use it.

The room itself was really nothing too special - kind of an aged and dated Hyatt-quality room that could be anywhere in the world.

The room was quite large though, and offered all you might expect from a Hyatt room, as well as a large and well-appointed bathroom.

The biggest detriment to the room was the complete lack of any soundproofing.  I could hear my neighbors on either side talking as loudly as if they were in my room.

Overall, I would not stay at this property again based on the high prices in relation to the value for that money.  There are many other London properties that I prefer that cost much less, and offer much more, but again, I am not the target visitor for this property.",3,2013,06,05
150,Could Be Even Better,"I booked this hotel as a belated 80th birthday celebration for my dad and we had a great 2 night stay at this hotel.  Despite confusion over our room bookings, the hotel managed to recover the situation to our satisfaction by a room upgrade and some personal touches in their room like a birthday cake.  Great customer service by one of the managers who checked with us the next day that everything was ok.

So why have I not given it an overall excellent?  The hotel was extremely busy and the queue for breakfast was long and tables not ready.  Although the waiting staff did their best they seemed rushed off their feet and forgot to bring milk with the coffee and we had to ask for butter etc. It appeared to be all buffet and for a 5 star hotel I would have expected to be offered a breakfast menu. 

We also booked the Montagu restaurant and this is where my main disappointment was.  The food overall was average.  My starter was awful and poorly presented.  It consisted of lots of beetroot and 4 piped blobs of goats cheese mousse, one of which had melted.  Couldn't taste the goats cheese.  Everyone else's starter was fine.

The standard room was quite small but the suite was spacious and nicely furnished.The beds were extremely comfortable and rooms were generally quiet so had a great nights sleep.  Fluffiest towels ever seen in a hotel

My father was in a wheelchair and the waiting staff were fabulous in assisting him which was more than can be said of the doormen who on many occasion couldn't be bothered to open the door for us.  Some of them were not very smart and whilst they wore a uniform they were some of the scruffiness I have ever seen.  One had dirty looking shoes.  Not a great first impression.
Overall, I would say the hotel is very good and we would return.
",4,2013,06,04
150,Fantastic Staff and Service,"While the location is slightly off the tourist path it was a welcome retreat to the busy tourist sections of London.  Easy access to 2 tube stations and public transportation and never a wait for a taxi.  The service was excellent and the breakfast and tea were wonderful and so appreciated.  A great hotel in which to use as home base as you travel about the city.  It was so nice not to have to find a place for breakfast and tea/snack time in the evening on the executive level served as dinner on several occasions as it was full of wonderful food.  The decor is very pretty, open and light.",4,2013,06,02
150,Perfect hotel in the heart of London,"This was my second stage in the hotel. Last year I was very satisfied, now again I like it. It is situated in very central part of London, just 2 streets from Oxford street and close to Bond streets. The hotel is clean, the rooms are large and the service is perfect. The breakfast is very good.",5,2013,06,01
150,Afternoon tea - Sex and the City them,"Well well well who'd have thought it! We weren't expecting such a treat, the staff were absolutely amazing from the moment we walked in  the door on Saturday afternoon, to having a drink in their beautifully decorated bar, it felt such a treat. 
I thought at it was a Hyatt chain it may have felt like that but certainly not.
The Afternoon tea was a delight - the food so well presented, the staff couldn't have done any better, been any more attentive nor been more helpful.  We were offered more of anything we wanted, which we also didn't expect.
I found the deal on Afternoon teas, and cant recommend it enough...........from the gorgeous mini fresh burgers, to the cucumber sandwiches to the beautiful shoe cakes - yes yes yes",5,2013,05,29
150,Quality we expected from Hyatt,"Stayed here while on Tauck tour of London and Paris.  Was very pleased with this hotel.  Neighborhood was very good.  Didn't have to worry about walking around and doing our touristy things.
Interior of hotel is contemporary 
and up beat.  Check out picture behind hotel desk!
Our room was a little on the small side.  We could have used more drawer space but used shelf in closet.
Food was very good and like everything in London expensive.
No worries in this hotel it is very good!",4,2013,05,29
150,A classy place two blocks from Oxford Street.,"Portman Square (the square is private, close to the public) is lovely, and the Hotel is as classy as they come. You may not need a posh hotel, and the rooms are not larger(or luxurious) than in a less expensive hotel, but it is very nice. 

Taxi from Paddington station is about 8 pounds. From then on, you have buses and tube nearby.

Breakfast is at the Montagu, and you can have dinner there at night. If breakfast is not included in your rate, it will cost 20 to 30 British pounds, but you can have coffee for 5 pounds. Dinner is even more expensive and there is a chef, so food tends to be very complex.
Depending on your status on Hyatt, you may not have to pay for internet. Otherwise, it will cost you 17 pounds for 24 hours.",5,2013,05,28
150,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel is beautiful. From the staff, to the hotel room, to the restaurant and bar I can't say enough about how wonderful our stay was. What a fabulous stay we had. Check-in was easy, conscierge was so helpful, room was always spotless when we came back at the end of the day.  The food in the restaurant was always so good and the staff we so friendly.  If I had one complaint...it would be the 1/2 shower door. Why? You just end up having to wipe up the floor in the bathroom. No big deal though...just an observation.",5,2013,05,28
150,Great hotel,"Nothing but good feedback on this hotel. Friendly staff, up to date rooms and great location (close to hyde park). I will definitely come back here.

One point of criticism: some of the meeting rooms (Boardroom 2) smell like the toilets which are next door. At the time of our meetings there was no solution found to get the smell out of the room.",5,2013,05,28
150,Very modern and very good indeed.,"We also booked this hotel on a bargain deal like another reviewer on this page.  We didn't expect breakfast as well as the price was so good.  The hotel is wonderfully situated for central London, but not noisy.  It's had a big refurb in recent years and this shows - it's glossy and sleek and very stylish.  

Drinks are predictable expensive there and the service was a little sluggish, but the quality of the house wine was excellent.  We decided to splash out and have the breakfast - it was fabulous.  Yes, it's a buffet breakfast, but of a very superior quality indeed. 

Bedroom was very nice, the bed itself was marvellous and we slept like babies.  No view - just the back of another building - but hey, it's London!  The staff were terrific and seemed to like being helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended.",5,2013,05,28
150,Super London Hotel!!,"Hi - we booked this Hotel on a special offer through one of the ""Escapes/Bargains/Deals"" websites. We paid UKP179 for a single night but were DISSAPOINTED that Bed & B'Fast was NOT AVAILABLE - even when we asked the Hotel themselves, apparently - there is an allocation of B&B's per night at special prices - which is complete b/s - as the restaurant was completely empty from open till closing - I suspect the 30 odd quid for B'Fast was likely the reason!  Anyway, the Hotel is SUPER - even SUPER - DUPER, and even though our stay was brief - it was great. I mean, SKY 1/2/3 in the room + many other channels for no charge - very good - although about half of the available channels were Arabian Language - that more than adequately represents the mixed Clientele of the Hotel. Room was great, clean and the bed was king size with superb mattress quality and we had a great nights sleep. Decor was typically British, and a tad conservative - but clean. Reception and Staff were efficient and polite - only 1 query - why did they bother sending us an EMail proclaiming to aid our checking in and requesting Passport details - and then NOT BOTHER TO FOLLOW UP?? - a gimmick and waste of time to me. Anyway, I would recommend if bought at a reduced price and would certainly stay again ............. it's therefore a rare plus the UK hotel industry from me(us)!.",5,2013,05,24
150,Returned to excellence,"After a great stay at this hotel in 2011 my wife and I vowed we would be back and so we are about to finish a 10 day stay.  We love London and the location of the Hyatt since it is near Oxford street and great shopping as well being near a subway/tube station.  We had a nice room on the 7th floor and we had access to the club lounge and a full breakfast as we upgraded to be able to eat in the main dining lounge which gives you more variety than in the club lounge.  The service and friendliness of staff in our first visit was as good as this stay.  It was great to see and spend some time with Adela who was the concierge in 2011 but who had since been promoted.  On this our final night, Adela arranged a cake, chocolate covered strawberries and wine to be sent to our room.  My wife and I felt so special.  It's this personal touch that sets the Hyatt apart from other hotels.  So thanks to all the staff from housekeeping to staff at breakfast and special thanks to Adela and to the Assistant Manager of the Churchill Bar who took the time to make sure we were taken care of and who made a point to spend some time with us.  You have a great staff at the bar.  Thanks also to Nicholas who picked us from the airport. If we are able to come back to London, we know exactly where to stay.",5,2013,05,22
150,Lovely stay!,Stayed only for one night but we'll be back! Spectacular service. I can't recall when I've had a better hotel experience. The room was very comfortable and ample size for the heart of London. My husband stays at Hyatt weekly for business so we were able to stay on points and enjoy the Regency Club. Great cocktail hour and breakfast selection -far exceeded expectations. Hotel is within walking district of tons of great shopping and attractions. Highly recommend.,5,2013,05,20
150,Can't fault it!,"An amazing and opulent hotel. The service was faultless and the rooms perfect. We had a Club room on the 7th floor and the extras were worth it. The Club lounge is lovely and serves complimentary drinks and canapes each evening. The breakfast up there is also complimentary and now includes some hot selections too. 
Despite the standard of the hotel, our toddler was welcomed and we weren't made to feel out of place in the slightest as you so often are with children in high class establishments. 
Lovely Molton Brown smellies in the Club rooms and fresh fruit and water daily.
The location is also great - just off Oxfrd Street and walking distance to Lords and London Zoo (the purpose of our trip!)
We will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,19
150,Business travel review: the ins and outs of staying at the 9th floor (suites and club floor),"The Hyatt Regency has everything going for it: the brand, the location, the overall reputation of the staff, the mix of guests, and so on. Staying on the executive (club) floor should therefore be the best place to be and well worth the premium you pay. So why does my experience over the past three years still lead me to recommend that you'd be better off by taking a non-executive room on the lower floors? 

You will see from the general distribution of reviews that guests fall into three categories: 25% give an excellent score, 50% give a very good score (as do I in this review), and 25% give an average or lower score. For a top notch 5 star hotel that should be a warning sign that guests generally feel that what you're offering is not proportional to what they're paying. 

After my last stay, this time in an executive suite (the second largest category of suites), I can only confirm what I've experienced during my previous stays on the club floor:

-- House keeping is erratic. Day 1: I arrive to find the bed sheet stained by old red wine which had been washed a few times. Day 3: I come back to find an empty coke bottle and a used glass on the table in the living room, empty water bottle on the bed stand, pillows not put in order in the living room, detect used contact lenses from a previous guest on the floor, find bottle caps on the desk, and general 'clutter' in both rooms. For GBP +700 per night and the hassle of making a complaint, waiting for the supervisor to show up and come up with excuses, and then wait for the room to be cleaned again, I realize that I should just have booked a regular room at half the price.

-- The club lounges (both) tends to be underserviced. You will find empty food and cake trays, regardless of whether it’s breakfast ‘rush hour’ or a quiet afternoon. Staff is always polite and pleasant, of course, but the lack of initiative is surprising. On the positive side, they're good at clearing the tables, which means that you should (nowadays) not have a problem finding a free table.

-- The in-room entertainment system has been significantly improved over the past year, which is a welcome change. However, what you need most on business is a reliable internet connection, and that’s not something that you can take for granted. Although they are using iBahn, which charge GBP 17 per day for the best connection (you can choose a slow connection for free), you will still experience, time and time and time again, that the connection falls down and delays your work.

-- Erratic club floor desk. Although you have the option to check in and out on the 8th floor club desk instead of the main front desk on the ground floor, the reality is that the staff downstairs move you quicker in and out than the dedicated staff upstairs. If you should have to make a complaint (i.a. concerning house keeping) to the club floor, you might also experience that they forget to pass it onwards, whereas messages are always being moved forward downstairs.

In short, I stand by my last review a year or so back, when I advocated that the club floor should be renamed ‘club poor’. The simple reality is that paying the premium for an executive room (regular club room, junior suite or executive suite) is not worth what they’re able to offer compared to other top 5 star hotels in London. But please read by review with caution, because my critical remarks are not applicable elsewhere in the hotel. In general, the staff is among the very best in London, and I will therefore, in fairness, put a ‘very good’ rating on my stay, and go for the far better priced non-exeutive floors next time.",4,2013,05,18
150,Stopover prior to a trip to Ireland,"Recently stayed at this hotel for one night while on a stopover from Ireland heading back to the US.  I'd have to say the hotel is in a wonderful location and very close to Hyde Park and Oxford Street.  You have two Underground stations within 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel which makes access very convenient or if taking the Heathrow Express to Paddington it's only a 10pound or $15 taxi ride to the hotel.  You are within 2 miles of all the tourist locations, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Big Ben, SoHo, Buckingham Palace and the waterfront.  Rooms are comfortable and elegant.  Desk area has a 110v connection for the US folks and our electronics if you forgot an adapter.  WIFI is quick and reliable.  You have a small park in front of the hotel named Portman Square which is nice to look at.",4,2013,05,17
150,very good indeed,"I stayed in this hotel over 5 nights. The location is superb. You can't be closer to Oxford Street yet in such a quiet location. There are two underground stations close to the hotel although you can virtually walk to almost every place you would like to be (as a tourist).  My room was quite large and the king size bed was comfortable. Housekeeping visits the room at least three times a day. There was complimentary tea/coffee and a kettle in the room but they were hidden in the lowermost shelf of a cabinet. You should really look for it. Free wi-fi connection is available at the reception area. They also have two computers for use by the guests. The berakfast hall was nice in the sense that it let the daylight in (if there is any outside) but was a little crowded after 08.00 am. The waiters were very polite. The coffee was great. The food was alright and I suppose it covered all you could get in any other hotel in London. They even had olives! which is basically a Mediterrenean thing for breakfast. Baked beans, fried eggs, etc were served on demand. Concierge was very helpful and everytime I asked for any help I was satisfied with their approach. I would definitely recommend you to stay there.",4,2013,05,15
150,great base to visit London,stayed there overnight with a friend and the service was great. The hotel is very nice and comfortable. The common areas are spotless and the design is lovely. rooms are somewhat small but regular for London. would recommend...,5,2013,05,14
150,Everything Was Just Right,"Our first trip to Europe and found the Hyatt to be a perfect setting and home base for 5 nights.
Everything was flawless, from check in to check out as the Hotel operates at a very high degree of efficiency. Although this is an American brand I always felt like I was in London.
The lobby restraunt was excellent- for dinner,(try the Dover Sole) or even afternoon tea which they serve later than other establishments. We also enjoyed the Churchill lounge for a late night snack which included the best fish and chips we had in London.
Particular kudos to the concierege staff in general and William in particular who was tireless in his advise and patience with tours, theater tkts. and restraunt suggestions.
The entire staff was kind, courteous and professional in every way.
The location was central and always a cab out front.
Would return and highly reccomended.",5,2013,05,13
150,"Great hotel, central London near Hyde Park","Great hotel, stayed there for a hen Night, Very central near oxford street. For sure I would go back and would recommend the hotel. Nothing bad to say about the place. Great Breakfast.The hotel is not far from Hyde park, If you are booking multiple rooms then call ahead and see if they will give you a good group rate. Stayed in other Hyatt hotels and this one measures up to their usual standard.",5,2013,05,11
150,Gr8 Location,Churchill has become my favourite place to stay in London. As it has an excellent location just around the Oxford street and has a beautiful park in the front. Yet it has a very cozy feeling to it. Staff is warm and rooms are quite spacious. Edgware road is also at a very close walking distance.,4,2013,05,09
150,Style and Location,"Beautiful and stylish very unobtrusive staff very efficient ,Rooms very comfortable and good decor.
Food excellent reception staff very helpful and professional Lobby area very impressive,good art works great ambience.Hyatt Regency excellent location everywhere in London accessible from the location in Portman Square,comfortable and relaxing excellent place to stay.",5,2013,05,07
150,Ok but not 5 star,"We stayed for the bank holiday weekend. Excellent location, very peaceful area of London. We had a king size room which was ok v comfy bed. The shower was broken so they had fixed a new shower below the old one which was really good if you we're a child or very small, otherwise you had to take it off the wall and hold it! Both night i had to ask for cups and saucers.
I booked our room through last minute.com as a secret hotel at a rate of £169 per night b&b, which was excellent, we would have been very disappointed if we had payed full rate! We will go back but only if we get a deal, I don't think it warrants the 5 stars.",4,2013,05,07
150,Classic hotel close to great shopping,"This is a great hotel in the Churhill area.  Coming from the metro it is a little tricky to find so get directions beforehand.  The rooms are comfortable, modern, and a nice size. The breakfast in the restaurant was reasonable and good.  This is a good central location to shop and go to the theater.",4,2013,05,07
150,Excellent service,"We have stayed at The Churchill many times over the last years and as always the stay was excellent. We had a Club room which allows you access to a lounge that provides breakfast afternoon tea and snacks all day. This lounge is a bonus when you have been out all day, and want a light bite without having to go out to eat or order room service. The ""sweetie jar"" corner as we called it was a delicious little treat. The service is always of a high standard and the regular staff are polite and greet you by name making you feel as though you are home. All in all a great hotel that's in a central location to shopping, theatre and good restaurants.",4,2013,05,04
150,Does it worth it?,The most beautiful thing about the stay is being in the hearth of the city. The hotel was full and disabled room was offered where the bath is fully wet after you take a shower. The service is good. The hotel is old. I think we paid for the location. Besides being in London was excellent.,3,2013,05,03
150,Best service ever,"The hotel was very nice, comfortable and elegant, but it was the service that made it so incredible.
Firstly, when I checked in, I was given a room and asked for it to be changed for one with a park view - instantly, no problem, and bags brought over.
Secondly, at lunch, my mother had a sore throat and we asked if they had any cough drops, but they didn't, but the guy who worked there said he'd get some.  He came back 5 minutes later with a bag (and then we noticed he went out of the hotel to a local drugstore to pick up some for us).
From the beginning to the end they took special attention to detail (even putting a heart-shaped cake in my room as I had recently gotten married and was with my wife).
Truely enjoyable.",5,2013,04,30
150,Call me naive but...,"I believe it's wrong to sell more rooms than you have available to 'optimise' occupancy levels etc. But that's exactly what Hyatt does (as confirmed by reception). The result for us was a stressful start to a celebratory evening when we arrived - having paid for our room in advance - to be told there weren't any currently available. Having requested an immediate refund a room was suddenly found but only after spending over half an hour in reception.

Overall I don't rate this hotel. It is too busy to offer excellent service (I sympathise with the staff here) and you can feel your life ebbing away whilst waiting for a lift to appear (no guest stairs!). The rooms ('superior' in our case) are small with poor sound proofing.",2,2013,04,29
150,The Churchill Bar - A lesson in what excellent service is all about !,"Stayed at the hotel a few years back, before I joined Tripadvisor... otherwise I would have written an 11/10 perfect review !
Anyhow, this review is about their CHURCHILL BAR and Terrace....
I have been here a few times in the last couple of weeks - Always excellent, but will concentrate on my last visit...
Went with a couple of friends, and was greeted nicely by the Bar Manager... a very tall and well groomed guy, wearing a nice looking and expensive suit ? The Bar was full, but he personally found and cleared a lovely cosy corner for us. It was the best seat in the house,too ! Bar staff are extremely courteous, attentive, but discreet and professional. They are also very knowledgeable - despite it being busy, they helped and advised us on some nice cocktails and beer. 
I decided to go up to the bar to pay my bill, and the Bar Manager made a point of coming over to personally thank me for my custom and we had a bit of witty banter about birthdays and getting old ! 
Ambience: Even though it was busy, the bar just oozes class, sophistication and quality... I cannot fault it. Also alot of memorabilia, cigar and brandy displays etc. as a homage to Winston Churchill, who I believe used to rank this as his favourite watering-hole ? 
Nice touch: The outside terrace even has blankets, for the brave alfresco drinkers/smokers !
SUMMARY: Great place to make a good impression, and indulge in a classy drink !",5,2013,04,29
150,simply perfect,"Stayed several times for business trips.  Everything is perfect, the room, the service and specially the restaurant.  Nothing is better thatn having dinner at their ground floor restaurant after a full day of work listening to the piano singer in the background.",5,2013,04,29
150,Beautiful hotel,"Me and my partner had a great night at this lovely hotel. I cannot fault anything, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is beautifully decorated. The room was very nice and the bed was so comfy! We had dinner and breakfast there which was really good I would recommend trying the cocktails! The location is perfect for Oxford street shopping.",5,2013,04,25
150,Don't buy mixed drinks!,"I must say I don't mind spending for a 5 star service which this hotel offers.. However, I don't like being treated as I have no idea what value for money is either, and I'm afraid on this occasion it was totally unacceptable! My partner and I asked for two mixed drinks both at £18 a piece... That seems a bit high but the manager explained that these drinks were to die for... So we had two... Now, what we were left with was 4 sips and I'm not joking! I mean really... £36 for two glasses of ice? I can only tell you how disappointed we were and we won't be drinking in there again either... Just around the corner not even a 2 minute walk is a lovely bar/restaurant called the grazing goat.... ""Excellent"" place and they do a wonderful watermelon martini for 75% less! I'm afraid the Churchill Bar will have to change their attitude on how they treat there guests as we aren't stupid just because we can afford to stay!!!",3,2013,04,24
150,Fabulous 5 star hotel,This was our second visit to the Churchill and it was as good as we remembered it if not better. This is a gorgeous hotel with a beautiful lobby.The 5 star facilities and quality of the service made our stay really memorable. There are always plenty of staff on hand and we found of them all to be pleasant and extremely helpful. We have 2 teenage boys and had 2 rooms with connecting doors and that worked really well for us. A great stay thank you to all at the Churchill,5,2013,04,24
150,Top five Best hotel in London,"We stay at the Churchill annually for our anniversary/early Christmas Oxford street shopping. Every year we are treated to five star facilities and opulence. We are always treated extremely well from the chefs,chamber maids,hotel manager to the car park attendant we receive what always feels their unreserved attention.

This past year exceeded expectations as we was graciously treated to an upgrade to their 8th floor which I will remain discreet but suffice to say we left feeling like royalty for the weekend.

Thank you Hyatt",5,2013,04,23
150,wonderfully comfortable!,Stayed 2 nites during the London Book Fair and loved the comfort and quality of the service. The breakfasts were realy great. Would love to stay there again. The only problem was the closest subway / underground station was not in a walking distance and this might be unpractical for a wondering travellers...,5,2013,04,21
150,Not convinced.,"Beautiful,gorgeous very grand hotel.The lobby is amazing,the staff were wonderful on reception.The rooms were very clean and grand.I booked it through a secret hotel offer on last minute .com . However,the fly in the ointment was an item of my make  up went ' missing' .At the time I thought 'oh well it wasn't expensive ,just have to remember not to use this hotel again' .That would have been the end of it as far as I was concerned.
I received a circular mail from the management asking  'Would I stay in this hotel in the future?'
My honest reply was 'no due to the item of make up that went missing,I wasn't upset enough to make a formal complaint'
So they decided to investigate on my behalf,which was fair enough but quite uneccessary,then a short while later I received a rather abrupt response informing me that they had questioned house keeping regarding this matter and the strongly denied any involvement in the disappearance of my item.
Aside from the fact I wasn't too upset about the item,I made it clear that the hotel persued me over the whole situation,I was happy to say no more and vote with my feet.So what could have been a simple solution to I minor issue ,ended up with me being totally irritated by the whole affair and the snotty management defending a situation the brought totally upon themselves .....and me.So No I wouldn't stay there again,ever! Can't quite remember how long ago this happened to be precise.",3,2013,04,21
150,Very nice!,We stayed for 5 nights and were treated very well.  Our room was a Regency Club suite (using Hyatt Gold Passport points to upgrade - I highly recommend this!) & was large & modern.  Everyone was so kind & helpful.,5,2013,04,20
150,"Excellent service, beautiful hotel","We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Churchill for 2 nights. We were actually coming from another London hotel and were going to Paris in between. They were nice enough to hold our extra bags while we were in Paris and then deliver them to our room when we checked in late the next night. We were greeted by name upon check-in, and we were upgraded to a Club level floor which got us the breakfasts in the morning, which was a great treat. The room was small, but very well-appointed. The bed was beyond comfortable, and we slept great while we were there. It's a great location for shopping (Oxford Street was about 2 blocks away), and the Marble Arch tube station was a 5-minute walk. The prices in the Churchill Lounge are reallly high, but the service was great. We were very pleased at this hotel, and we would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,04,19
150,Great location and nice room,We stayed for one night to celebrate my husbands birthday. We were given a room upgrade to park view and came back after our night out to a bottle of bubbly and birthday cake which was a lovely surprise. Staff friendly and room clean and well equipped . Will definitely stay again. Great location for Oxford St also.,5,2013,04,17
150,"Lovely room, peaceful nights sleep","I booked this hotel last minute whilst in London for one night.  Checkin was excellent, they didn't have a non smoking room available so after advising that I wouldn't sleep in a smoking room, the receptionist consulted her team leader and I was upgraded to a king room.
Room was lovely, clean, spacious, nice bathroom with molten brown toiletries... View outside window was of nothing but that didn't really bother me. Everything in room you would expect to find in a five star hotel... Shame you had a to pay for wifi in your room... Was gonna watch a movie but thought £12 was daylight robbery and so stuck with my book! 
Breakfast the next morning was really nice, seemed busy and I did go down very late but I was happy enough with everything.
I had the best nights sleep I've had in a long time, lovely comfy bed... Would definately stay again if it was another good deal...",4,2013,04,15
150,Nice location and good food,"I stayed for around 8 days at Hyatt Regency, and it was a nice pleasant stay. I liked the room service as it was really timely and good taste too. It was a business visit, so didn't explore activities for kids and other fun stuff...",3,2013,04,09
150,Week-end theatre break,"Excellent service, perfect location within walking distance of shops, great bed & pillows, wonderful room service breakfast, convenient car park on site.  We eat in the main restaurant last year and found the food poor so chose to eat out this time, although we would love to try Locanda Locatelli. The toiletries are aimed at the male guest with a distinctly masculine scent, not great if you are female! Having paid full price for two rooms last year, it was a lovely surprise to get this hotel as a result of a www.lastminute.com secret hotel at half the price.",5,2013,04,09
150,"Good Property, Poor Service","Stayed at this hotel in March 2013 for 10 nights. This is my second review of this hotel. My previous was in 2011. 

Overall the property presents itself well, with public areas still good and rooms ok. However, there is much improvement that needs to be done.

Our Suite:
We stayed in a suite and the suite had a good amount of space to relax. The bed was comfortable, although it squeek a little each time I got in and out of it. The furniture in the living room looked a little tired and have not been replaced for a while. The sofa bed was uncomfortable to sit for longer periods of time. The bathrooms were comfortable with a good size tub. The shower stall was a little cramped. Finally, our suite was at the back of the hotel and our rooms looked into other rooms. Our linving room window was so close to another room window that we were unabel to leave the curtains open at any time.

The Service:
Overall, the staff really try, but honestly apologizing for all and every guest complaint or concern without the actual action is just as frustrating. An example was that it took several days and several phone calls to housekeeping to ensure our requests were understood. Leaving a note for the housekeeping staff each morning did not work.  Also staff in the Club lounge (who rotate with the restaurant staff downstairs) were inconsistent, hurried and very slow for forgetful when the lounge was busy. an example has to do with breakfast time (after 2 days, we avoided going to the lounge for breakfast because of the crowds, the poor service and the very cramped and close proximity of seating arrangements) when it is most busy. Staff are seen rushing back and forth through the lounge, and almost pushing or insisting 'right of way' in narrow aisles. And gust having to ask for request several times before getting it. 
Finally, because we were there for so many nights, we noticed that every day (without fail) we would be privy to guest complains that were being dealt with in the lounge reception, in the lounge, in the hotel lobby, in the hotel restaurant, in hallways, and almost every area of the hotel. What surprised us most was that staff seem immune to the complains. often, we would overhear fairly private and person complains in which staff would listen, apologize, and then offer and explaination that sounds like the staff did not hear the complain. It was consistent with most staff in most situations. 
Therefore IMO, I believe that the quality of service in this hotel has deteriorated. My observation is that most staff apear to be fairly junior and inexperienced. I hope that this property would invest more time and resources in training staff for good customer and guest service. 

Overall, our stay was not enjoyable and it is unlikely that we would return to this property. This is a pity as it is a good location.",3,2013,04,09
150,"Great potential, location--poor service and attention to detail","We stayed at the hotel over an extended Easter weekend.  I had some light business and so chose to travel with my family to explore London.  I really wanted 5-star experience and a great location. We booked one of the larger suites, on the club lounge floor.

Despite our arrival at 8pm--and an e-mail to the hotel alerting them to our arrival time--our room was not ready. It took until 8:30 pm to complete the turnover. Not a great start.  When we finally were able to get into our room, the Internet was not working. Fortunately, but with no luck, a very helpful associate who turned out to be the hotel's assistant front office manager tried to help (at around 10pm.)  The problem was eventually fixed the next morning.

The lounge was constantly overrun and tables were dirty. The lounge appears to be chronically understaffed.  When we walked in daily for breakfast, we were often ignored in our attempt to find a clean table because staff were so busy trying to keep up with the guests in the lounge. One morning, after walking between two lounges TWICE to try and find a clean table for our family of four, I decided to pull two tables together to accommodate my family. (Keep in mind that no one approached us to help.)  When I started to move the tables, a staff person ran over to tell me that this was not allowed.  Finally, she understood the predicament and then began to help.

One night we were enjoying a drink in the lobby bar, listening to a piano player.  The guests next to us inadvertently dropped a plate which broke as it fell onto the ground.  For over an hour no one cleaned up the plate—although at least 5 staff, including one waitress, one host and one person who looked like a cleaning person all looked directly at the mess and ignored it.  In addition to being a hazard, I expect better service and more attentive staff in a 5-star hotel.  Finally my wife went to the front desk to alert them—and only then was the broken plate removed.

Food was great--including room service and especially Locanda Locatelli.

There are some highlights to this hotel: great location, attentive doormen and concierges and, as already mentioned, a very attentive assistant manager. I still rate this hotel highly as it has the potential to be great but not as currently run.",4,2013,04,08
150,Its Ok,"The Hotel has a great location near Oxford Street, and the building its self has the makings of a classic grand hotel. The hotel reception area is very nice and the rooms are clean and have all the facilities you need, although I thought the en-suite was on the small side. 

On arrival the door staff parked my car for me quickly and there was no wait at check-in. I was upgraded to a room with a better view and given free wifi as a Hyatt Platinum member which was nice.

The hotel seems very good at getting customers through its building quickly but customer service is lacking in the fine detail. Little things like being shown to your room or welcome notes in the room where missing which I am used to in other 5 star hotels. The lack of attention to detail even effected the bedside clock, it was an hour fast as the clocks had changed a few days before but had not been altered. 

One of the reasons I booked the hotel was to eat in the Locanda Locatelli which the hotel proudly shows off on its website. However the hotel was unable to get me a table for the time I wanted during my stay. I had emailed the hotel prior to booking to ask about a table at Locanda Locatelli but the email was returned to me as the hotels main email was not working. I booked the hotel online anyway thinking it would be fine but that was a mistake. This was the first time I have not been able to get a table in a hotel I was staying in, epic fail. The hotel claims that Locanda is separate to the hotel and they have no control over it, so be careful if you are booking the hotel and expecting to eat there.

The Churchill bar was also closed for the duration of my stay meaning options for food and drink where limited at the hotel.

At check-in I had asked the hotel to wash my car, its a service they advertise on their website. When I checked-out the car was still dirty, the hotel claimed it was short staffed.

The stay despite its problems was OK, and the staff are friendly. However OK is not really good enough for this type of hotel and it needs to sharpen it service.",3,2013,04,02
150,Great and welcoming stay,"Had a great stay courtesy of the Hyatt Passport scheme. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, particularly Christian at the check in desk. Great room, great facilities, fantastic location and great atmosphere. Thank you for making our daughter Emily's first trip to London very special.",5,2013,04,01
150,Lack of consistency,"Stayed here during a business trip. 
This is a beautiful and lovely hotel. But it lacks consistency in service in important areas considering a being a recognized Brittish hotel. The hotel porter for example, is not up to standard to be honest. I have stayed at other top London hotels and the porters are well educated and know thier job and know London! This time he didnt even know the address or didnt even recognise one of the best restaurants in town. Then it was my limo and driver who where pushed away while I was just running in to pick up my suitcase on my way to Heathrow. Lost 15 minutes which is alot when you are squeezed to catch a plane. Again the porter!!!!
The check in and check out personell were really nice and I felt very welcomed.
But I cannot say the same about the club personell. No happy faces, no good morning or anything! At the club itself, soem of the personel were proffesional but one taller lady there, was obviously doing her best to disturb the guests at breakfast. Smashing the china and the cutlery when people are trying to have a relaxing breakfast in a club is not appropriate.
These imporant details to me are crucial to me choosing a 5 star hotel. It all has to be consistent.
The staff at the bars where absolutely fantastic I must admit, typical brittish politness and proffesionalism.
The rooms are of ok size considering a London hotel. Well designed and clean.
The quality of the oap and schampoo is one of the best I have had on a hotel!
Make sure you have a room with good view and away from elevators and staff entrances.",4,2013,03,25
150,A quiet haven just off Oxford Street,"Arriving anywhere in the early morning can be problematic, given check-in times for hotels are all in the afternoon. The flight into Heathrow was early, it was an uncharacteristically fast trip through immigration and before we knew it, we were on the train to central London, choosing the Tube to Green Park Station where we'd researched the availability of a lift. From there it was a short cab ride along Park Lane to Marble Arch and the Churchill (as it's known locally).  Apart from the check-in staff insisting we were only booked in for one night (we'd reserved three), we were delighted to be whisked away to the Executive Club floor to get the booking sorted out, complete check in and be told our room was ready for occupation and, bliss, a hot shower. It was then into the club lounge for a nice breakfast, with eggs cooked to order. There is free wi-fi in the club lounge and also in the lobby, but you need to ask for details - they're not volunteered. The room was large enough for two adults and perfectly comfortable, despite the evacuation alert sounding late one evening. A great spot if you want to shop and quiet in the evenings for a good night's sleep.",4,2013,03,23
150,Great stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights in a regency club room and found our stay fantastic!! The only downside was that the room was more geared up for a business man rather than a couple! There wasn't a dressing table as such and lighting for us girls (make up & hair) was a bit shocking!
Apart from this location, staff and cleanliness was 2nd to none! 
Thankyou churchill :)",5,2013,03,23
150,Not the Hyatt I am used to.,"We have been here 3 nights and I am completely underwhelmed at this location. We are here for a 3 day stay and I have yet to discover why this is a 5 star hotel. I am a Hyatt vacation owner, so I always stay at Hyatts. This one I would not reccomend.  If you have a family definately DO NOT stay here. The business office is 2 laptops in the lobby with no other casual places to relax in the hotel!!  This hotel is strictly geared for business only! 17 pounds for internet a night, come on! The food, mediocre at best.  As a family I feel we were second class citizens as there has been a large Annual Shareholder Conference here the last few days.  
Lastly, the rooms are HORRIFICALLY small!  Keep looking, there has to be better options in London! Next time sadly, I wont be staying at a Hyatt in London.",3,2013,03,22
150,Perfect Location,"Location of this Hotel is just the Best. Breakfast is good Food for lunch and dinner is acetable.
House keeping need a adjustment. I stayed there 4 nights starting from March 15. At all these days we hanged''Do my room'' sign at 09:00 am but my room never done before 14:00 pm.
The other thing that need a tune is TV programs. There was more than 30 Arabic TV program and no even one Turkish program !!
As all, good Hotel.",5,2013,03,21
150,Undistinguished,"I can hardly complain, since I got this through a late booking site at considerable discount. Having said that, whatever you pay, a five star hotel is still - supposedly - a five star hotel. Except that this one isn't. Check in is slow and tedious (and check out is the same). Staff there are pleasant but ineffectual. Breakfast is at best ordinary - looks fine but for a five star hotel? I don''t think so. The room was small - very small - though it was neat and clean. But my usual complaints about hotel bedrooms: why do we get showers and televisions that take an age to figure out how they work? If it is a test of some kind then I failed. And the lighting in this hotel is such that in order to have a bedside light on after you get into bed you must later get out of bed to turn off all the lights. The air conditioning is noisy and the iron didn't work - ok, it happens, but the request for an iron was met with a heavily accented 'you want i-ron?' followed by a crash as the phone was slammed down. Spent 10 minutes wondering what would happen and then got a very meek tap on the door to find another iron was being delivered. It is the little things that count and this hotel does the little things badly. A good concierge and door staff though, I have to say. But I wouldn't pay full price for this. You are warned.",3,2013,03,20
150,"Excellent location, grand rooms. Top service","We stayed for a weekend night in 2012 in a Suite and we found the hotel to be amazing. The room has 2 bathrooms a massive lounge with TV, coffee maker with a drawer of pods to choose from and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We had a bottle of champagne cold in the room when we arrived and the Molton Brown goodies in both bathrooms was just a great touch. The location is perfect for exploring central london. Lobby service and restaurants all top notch.",5,2013,03,16
150,Hyatt regency London stay,"This is one of my favorites in London... Central location just behind he Oxford street but in a very quiet spot due to the Portman square/ Park. IT is particularly pleasant if you stay in a park facing room Floor 3+ as you have no noise/ best park view.
Rooms are compact like any London hotel but well designed. Good quality sleep is secured with high quality mattress - a good standard quality of the Hyatt group. IT is a shame there is no proper filter coffee machine in the rooms, you have to live with very basic Nescafe powder. Park facing  Rooms are not new but done with taste.
Montage restaurant is great for quality meals/ excellent breakfast; maybe a little pricy you may end up paying for 80 GBP pp for a dinner.",4,2013,03,16
150,Home away from home,"I honestly have nothing negative to say about our stay. From the minute we walked into the hotel, to the minute we checked out we received nothing but first class service. 
The staff was beyond accommodating. Every staff member greeted us politely with a smile, even the house keeping staff in the hallway. 
Although the room and bathroom were relatively small, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the decor was warm and welcoming. Both the room and the bathroom were immaculately cleaned daily. 
We had issues with the internet service, and it was taken care of immediately.
The food at the restaurant was amazing (breakfast and afternoon tea).
Hotel is conveniently located to shopping, theatre, Hyde Park and tube station.
We will be back in London in July and will definitely be staying at this hotel.
I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed.",5,2013,03,10
150,Great Hotel but not all standards are 5*,"Just to be clear nothing in the hotel is ""bad"" - on the contrary mostly excellent but in some areas fails to meet the 5* standard
First the good/excellent 
Public areas very nice, service excellent, location good - 2 minutes walk Marble Arch tube and Oxford St, there is a bar/cafe, separate bar, 2 restaurant, 24 hour room service, room safe, taxis outside hotel, bed rooms are quiet and have good air-con and heating, large plasma screen tv with pay movies
The not so good 
Restaurant very noisy, evening pianist a bit jarring, food very expensive £50 pp not inc wine and menu a but limited, the room was rather plain, bath rather small and only basic toiletries on offer, came back to room on first night intending to have a bottle of water from the mini bar but it was empty, normal tv channels a but limited and many Arabic channels reflective of mainly middle eastern clientele, a sign in the room said DVD players where available but was told not comparable with new TV, ",5,2013,03,09
150,Great location but slight downslope in overall service over time,"I'm staying there often for business as the location is absolutely great and I usually like Hyatt chain. Rooms as small but as one of the perks of Gold Passport I always end up having a good upgrade (so a very small room ends up being just small, ok for one night stay) nor do I have to pay quite outrageous internet charges (17 gbp per day). On a positive side rooms are very comfortable, location is great and service up to Hyatt standard. On negative side, the place is crowded and noisy, breakfast room, more similar to central station arrival hall than five star hotel restaurant quite unpleasant (unless you have your breakfast in the 8th floor lounge, which is again crowded). Quite surprisingly, the hotel is full of kids running on the floors and common spaces, without staff nor parents paying any attention. All in, a very peculiar marketing policy keeps transforming this place away from a traditional British five star proprety...",4,2013,03,09
150,Loved it!,The hotel has its own charm and wonderful location but the best thing about the place is its friendly staff. We were upgraded twice and were presented with a birthday cake and champaign to celebrate my wife's birthday. Will stay there again for sure!,5,2013,03,07
150,Outstanding Property,"The staff and location are make this older property a wonderful place to stay while in London.  It is a 5 minute walk to the Marble Arch tube.  The staff are never rushed or impatient in giving directions or suggestions.  Room are average size but very well maintained.  This is the second time we have stayed here, and will return again.  Having access to the Concierge Lounge for breakfast is a big plus.",5,2013,03,03
150,Lovely hotel with nice location,"Beautiful hotel, with attentive service and nice quiet location.  I stayed here with my two teens and found it very convenient for shopping, relaxing, theatre and taking the Tube throughout the city.  We had a King room with a roll away bed, which we upgraded to a King Club, using Hyatt points.  The Regency Club is a nice feature here, offering breakfast and refreshments in the afternoon/evening.  Unfortunately, we were given the wrong breakfast hours by a reception staff member, and were not able to enjoy this service, however, we did partake in relaxing and refreshments in the Club.  I sent the hotel an email explaining my disappointment at the misinformation and was offered an upgrade on my future stay.   This was satisfactory and much appreciated, as I would like to return.
Our room was of a very nice size, fresh, clean and comfortable.  Being a Platinum member, we enjoyed free internet and found it to be fast, without difficulties.
The concierge desk proved to be knowledgeable, friendly and accessible.
We had to leave for the airport at 6am by taxi, which were lined up outside the hotel.  Very convenient and easy.
I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London.",4,2013,03,03
150,"Great location, good service, small room","The hotel is very close to Marble Arch station, with shops and restaurants nearby. Service was really good - staff at reception was very friendly and helpful, so was concierge. The room was a bit small and bare, not much character. Would I come back? Possibly.",4,2013,03,02
150,A great hotel experience!,"I've travelled to many hotels and this hotel is one of my favourites!  I've stayed a few times at this hotel over the years and it's always welcoming when I return.  When you walk through the doors you are greeted with a great vibe and excellent service.  You couldn’t ask for a better location!  It was central to everything that we needed, an easy tube ride to Waterloo station, and on a nice quite street in London which is sometimes hard to find in that city.  The Churchill Bar is a gem!  Recently renovated, modern classic and cozy, great friendly staff and the food was delicious.  Our room quite and very clean.  It also had all the amenities we needed including one of the best hotel hair dryers I've ever used...ladies it's great and made a huge difference!  

Simply a great hotel experience!!",5,2013,03,02
150,Fabulous business hotel with the best location,"Churchill after getting attached with Hyatt has become fabulous....it's the best location a hotel in London could possibly have. Very very central, comfortable rooms with a very good size ...food is good too with decent vegetarian options. The minute u step out u have a bank, grocery, and shopping of course...for me there is no better place to stay than Churchill if in London for a short stay...",5,2013,02,27
150,Excellent all around!,"Stayed here on business for a couple nights . . . this hotel had everything I needed: Comfort, location (for me anyway), great service and everything I needed to meet my needs as a business traveler (e.g., good Internet services).  The quality of the room and the amenities provided were outstanding.  My only issue would be that the room and bathroom were a bit smaller than I would like, but then by European standards the room was a decent size.  The Regency Club is, in my opinion, well above average and features a real nice breakfast selection and seating arrangements.  Definitely would stay here again!",5,2013,02,27
150,Great Hotel,This is a great hotel situated just off Oxford Street. All the attractions within easy walking distance and a stones throw from Hyde Park. Always use this hotel when I stay in London and I would highly recommend it. It's a short cab ride from Paddington Station so quick and easy to/from the airport. ,5,2013,02,26
150,Amazing,Definitely up to the expectation and reputation. Location is near shopping area. Walking distance to Oxford Street and Marble Arch. A lot of options for breakfast spread.The concierge is very helpful in helping to get information and tour/attraction tickets. Superb service and friendly staff.,5,2013,02,24
150,Central Location for Shopping and Dinners,"Stayed on level 9 which is part of the Club but rooms are slightly small. Next time will get a suite. Club lounges are spacious with hot breakfasts and drinks after 5.30pm with canapes.
Staff were exceptional at all levels and very helpful but more than just interested they were genuinely sincere. This is not seen in many hotels.
Downstairs bar also has a good atmosphere with an excellent cigar shop and a place to smoke outside and in winter they have heaters and rugs.",5,2013,02,24
150,Outstanding hotel,"Definitely five star.  The staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean and extremely comfortable.  Location is perfect for exploring Oxford Street, Hyde Park, and even Baker Street.  Several pubs and restaurants are within easy walking distance.",5,2013,02,21
150,Amazing,"What to say? I've stayed there for 1 night (short travel from US to London, just to meet some friends), and it was simply amazing. I've reserved a regular room, and it was a big corner room. Arrived at the hotel around 9am (since my flight came from CLT  that morning) and I was allowed to check-in that early... 2 days before I've got an email from the manager presenting herself, so I asked for that early check-in. She said back: can't guarantee you, but will do my best for it... AND IT HAPPENED!
Bathroom is nice, shower is superb. Front desk is friendly. Since I'm brazilian (and my Hyatt subscription says it), when the man who was helping me with check-in process confirmed it, another one from the front desk just said: OLÁ DIEGO, SEJA BEM VINDO, which means, Hi Diego, welcome... Since speaking english is not a problem for me, and he realized it, he said that in portuguese and kept speaking english to me, presenting himself as a portuguese guy who lives in London...
It's quite expensive, but totally worths the price. Location is a plus! 200m from the Tube Station and from Oxford Street.",5,2013,02,21
150,Nice hotel in a good location!,"We stayed here for one night recently and got the room on a good last minute deal. We were very pleased with the overall apperance of the hotel - the reception area is very nice and although we didnt use the bar or resturants these also looked the part. The room was of a good size for london as was the bathroom. The beds were extreamly comfortable. Check in was easy and all the hotel staff were very pleasant. The tube station is only a couple a minutes walk away next to marble arch and there are plenty of little places to find a bite to eat near by,  i enjoyed my stay here and & i'd stay here again in the future.",4,2013,02,18
150,A relaxing oasis.,"Expensive and the rooms are on the small side. If you pay for a room view ask for a room overlooking the square to the front otherwise you pay more money for a view of a side street.

All that said, this is a classy place to live. The walk from Marble Arch tube station to the hotel becomes more residential and within minutes you find yourself away from Oxford Road and amongst the fortunate people who live in this area. The staff are attentive without being overbearing, snobbish or arrogant. The doormen brightened our days with a cheery greeting every time we crossed the threshold. 

And here's the thing, coming back to the hotel after a day walking the streets of London became referred to as going home by my wife and I. We have stayed here twice now and enjoyed both visits.

150,Investiture Stay,"My family and I stayed at this wonderful hotel on the occasion of my recent Investiture at Buckingham Palace. Were fairly well travelled and have stayed in many 5 star and premium hotels worldwide but the service we received during our stay far surpassed what we expected.  

As soon as we checked in, we were upgraded which was lovely but it didn't end there; more surprises were delivered to our room and we were made to feel so welcome by everyone, The General Manager, Mr Michael J Gray introduced himself and made us feel so welcome.  The staff could not have been more attentive; their service was second to none,

The location is fabulous, the breakfast was plentiful and no matter what you desired, it was made available.  The eggs benedict was cooked to perfection.

Our stay was faultless and we can't thank the General Manager and his staff enough for making our special occasion even more special.  If there is a bench mark, this hotel sets it.

Thank you so very much.",5,2013,02,16
150,Love This Hotel,this is my favorite hotel to stay at while in London. The beds are super comfy. i love to go down to the montegue for a delicious breakfast. its also right in the heart of west end and theres always lots to do,5,2013,02,15
150,Luxury city break,"Rooms are spacious,very clean and room service was fantastic.Free upgrade upon arrival was also a big bonus with all the staff being really helpful and polite .Hyatt is extremely close to high street but yet very quiet and no traffic noise.Great getaway.",5,2013,02,14
150,a modern hotel with a high level of comfort,"Location location location .........that""s the main issue .A perfect place in London for any visit.
From the minute you arrive the Churchill takes over and brings you in a luxery atmosphere.
Very well organised rooms with a lot of electrical contacts for phones,pads and computers..
A very clean and well layed out bathroom..small remark ...how does the shower works....??
The Gold passport Club provides excelent food and drinks.   Breakfast in the morning is of a high quality but a bit noisy........If you leave you wonder when can I come back again..",4,2013,02,13
150,Expensive!,"Reception looks amazing, Churchill bar is awesome if a little pricey.  The rooms were awful, stayed on the fourth floor, needs serious refurb, gutted at paying the extortionate price which incidentally didnt even include breakfast!",3,2013,02,12
150,Great hotel for a London city break,"We've just returned from a lovely 3 night stay at the Hyatt. The hotel's in a great location, close to the shops, restaurants and good public transport links.
Our room was spacious, clean, and even though it overlooked a busy road there was no traffic noise. I'd highly recommend getting access to the Regency Club lounge. Breakfast provided there was fresh and varied, and the canape and cocktail hour is a nice touch. The lounge does get busy and there can be a little wait to be seated, but the staff are polite and attentive (and deserve a medal for their patience when dealing with some of the more 'challenging' guests we witnessed there during our stay!)",5,2013,02,10
150,Great Stay Near Oxford Street,"Great location, a couple of cafes nearby for breakfast/coffee. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Hotel staff was great.Room service was excellent, we ordered the fish and chips. Would stay here again.",5,2013,02,10
150,Excellent time at an excellent hotel,"In November me and my partner spent 3 nights at this hotel. After changing rooms twice due to not having a view (which my partner thought he had paid for, it turns out he hadn't but we were kindly upgraded anyway!) and then due to loud building work we moved to the 7th floor and were allowed to benefit from the private lounges, free breakfast and canopes! We had a great stay, all staff were fantastic especially Toby on reception. Great location for tourists too close to a tube station.  Will definitely stay again after saving up!",5,2013,02,07
150,A Pleasure From Start To Finish,"We stayed at The Churchill for my Husbands birthday as a (belated) celebration and I am so glad we did. Having stayed at various Hyatts in the US I was keen to see how this compared to the Regency at Century City in LA, it surpised my expectations on every level. We stayed in one of the Club Rooms on the 7th Floor. As I had mentioned it was for a celebrationat time of bboking, we had a gorgeous complimentary Birthday chocolate cake delivered to our room which went very well with the Champagne which was in the room when we arrived. I would recommend one of the Club Rooms as the Regency club with two lounges (one for just adults) is worth the extra money for having somewhere to relax with a coffee, juice or later in the day a glass of wine.
Breakfast in the Regency Club is the normal buffett style with a good chioce of cereals, fruit etc.
We ate at The Montagu on Friday night and the addition of a pianist was pleasant without being too obtrusive. Food was a good quality and choice with an extensive wine list, perhaps more wines by the glass would be good. Drinks in The Churchill bar were at a price you'd expect for a central London Hotel - Cocktails £15.00, G&T - £12.00. Comfortable atmosphere - sit by the fire if you feel the cold like me.
The most important part of this hotel is the Staff. On every level they are helpful, friendly and attentive. They create an atmosphere that is professional without being stuffy. I can't wait to return.",5,2013,02,06
150,one of the best Hyatt!,"The location of the hotel is just perfect. Just 2 mins walk to the Underground station and Oxford Street. You could easily walk from the hotel to Hyde Park or Piccadilly Circus. The restaurant and the food is good. Service through the hotel is friendly and efficient. The Regency Club room was fabulous with Molton Brown toiletries, complementary internet, great view and the Regency Club Lounges which served tea, coffee, wine and light snacks from 7am till 11pm. Overall it's a great hotel!",5,2013,02,04
150,Excellent hotel,My husband and I stayed in this hotel for our wedding anniversary. We were delighted to get an upgraded room with complimentary champagne and fruit. The staff were so attentive and the room was really nicely decorated with a large and comfortable bed. We had room service breakfast one morning which was delicious. We didn't eat in the hotel save for breakfast but enjoyed the setting and atmosphere of the hotel bar. The hotel was in a perfect location - close to the tube and to the shops on Oxford Street. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would highly recommend it.,5,2013,02,03
150,A Splendid Stay in the Heart of London,"We spent two nights here for a special occasion. Our room overlooked the gardens on the square and was well decorated and very comfortable. I would particularly recommend the 'Sex and the City' afternoon tea, it was great fun with a New York theme; pastrami on rye, lox and cream cheese bagels, mini hot dogs and burgers and delicious cakes. The flirtini cocktails (vodka, champagne and pineapple juice) were tasty and potent. I cannot fault the level of service and the attentiveness of the staff. We certainly hope to be back.",5,2013,02,03
150,Well located business hotel,"The Hyatt is our normal choice when stopping overnight in town. It is expensive but in a great location very close to Oxford Street and only 15mins walk from Paddington. Parking is also available on site, which I've used quite a few times.

A couple of issues this time. Firstly my minibar was empty, not velvet a bottle of water. Rang down to room service which just kept ringing out. The second was the room smelt of smoke, quite fresh smoke too. As an ex.smoker, I am sensitive to this. The last issue was the proximity of the room to the elevators which I could hear, but in all honesty didn't really cause a problem.

The service at reception is usually quite slow and you'll need to be explicit what type of beds you want, whether twin, king etc and whether you want a smoking or nonsmoking room - especially if you book through an online travel agent.",4,2013,02,03
150,Convenient location and great restaurant,"Nice hotel. Very close to Park Lane and to good areas for going out to dinner. Hotel is very nice with a great restaurant. The service is really good, professionals.... I really recommend it for business stay, if you´ve got the money. Art is important too for the Hotel, having an agreement with the Satchi Galery.",5,2013,01,23
150,"A pretty good place.  Decent value, great staff, good location.","We had a nice 2-day stay at the Hyatt.  We arranged pickup from Heathrow using their limo service.  It was a bit pricey but worth it.  The driver gave us a quick tour of the immediate area and helped orient us.

The staff at the hotel was excellent.  The check in was quick and painless.  We used Hyatt points to upgrade to club level.  It was worth it.  We had a nice King bed.  The room was of Hyatt quality and clean and quiet.

The tub didn't drain well, but we calle downstairs and they quickly fixed the problem.  The club rooms included a contiental breakfast that was extensive and it also included bacon and eggs.

We ate at a local pub and it was close to the tubes station.  It was close to shopping on Oxford street.",5,2013,01,20
150,"It's the team that make it.  Big, big WOW. Totally customer focused.","I am a troublesome and hard to please guest.  Worked in events and hospitality for 25 years. Seen the best and the worst in hotels, meeting spaces, hospitality, catering, running events, nationally and internationally and long in the tooth enough to be bored by staying in yet another hotel.  

In short, it takes much for me to take notice,

I stayed Monday evening for an industry event sponsored to get very generously, by Hyatt Regency and a fabulous breakfast to follow.

A high standard in consistency of service, offer and attention to detail is precious and what you pay for especially on Park Lane. If you work in the industry you know that looking this good and smooth takes a lot of investment in your staff your product and hard work.  Goodness me, if you stay here, you really do get what you pay for.

Oh, and an the added bonus of stunning pieces from the Saatchi collection - particularly the Chris Irvine behind reception.  When I asked about it, immediately presented from reception were details of all the Saatchi exhibits.  

That's service but most importantly, thinking about what your customer wants.  And how the Hyatt makes its mark.

Absolutely brilliant!",5,2013,01,16
150,Great place to stay.,"Had a really good stay in London. The location is great, very close to two stations on the Underground central line.

Rooms are well appointed and staff are very helpful and keen to assist.

Walking distance to the Oxford street shopping district.

For me the bar for London hotels has been raised very high after this holiday.",5,2013,01,15
150,We Returned - It Was Exquisite,"After a poor first stay we decided to return -we weren't disappointed. 
This time we upgraded to one of the presidential suites. It was lovely, there was nothing we could have wanted for and the executive lounge was fantastically stocked with great service. We will return next time we're in London and put this in our top 5 world hotels (in our humble experience that is).",5,2013,01,13
150,"Great Hotel, great location","This is a great hotel, up there in the best I have ever stayed in. We had adjoining rooms with my sister and mum and used it to celebrate my mum's birthday and visit the Westend for a show.

Knowing it was my mum's birthday we could arrange a little package in her room for arrival, she loved it. We have to recommend the service and the luxury space in this hotel. It is five star and it feels it without being too extravagant or make you feel uncomfortable if you don't make a habit of staying in places like this. I have been to 4 star hotels where they feel extremely stuffy and formal, this hotel gets 5 star completely right making everyone feel at home and nothing being too much effort.

I still rate their breakfast service as the best I have ever experienced and hope to return one day for another good weekend.",4,2013,01,09
150,Good hotel in good location,"We checked in a few days before Christmas.  As we booked a Club Room, check in was on the 8th floor and after a long haul flight, we were very glad that check in was a swift 5 minutes.  The room on the Club floor was good sized, with the usual amenities expected of a Hyatt (Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries, robes, slippers, etc).  Each morning breakfast was served on the Club floor, we enjoyed this as there were no crowds and we could get a lovely serene start to our day.  They also serve canapes in the afternoon but we didn't get to try this.  

Location wise, it's only a short walk to Oxford Street and from there, it is a shoppers heaven.  Check out again was swift and overall it was a very pleasant stay here.",4,2013,01,08
150,"Nice Hotel, Nice Location","Second stay at this property. Really enjoyed it. Rooms are nice with nice amenities. Gym is fully outfitted. Fruit and water available for free. 

Location is prime for Oxford Street shopping. Close to all the department stores. 

Ate dinner one night in the hotel restaurant. Food was very good. Service good as well. Thought it was a bit pricey (even for London) but guess it is a hotel restaurant. 

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,01,06
150,Luxury and location,"This hotel is just off Oxford Street so is very handy for shopping and sight-seeing. It is sited on a square just off the main streets which made it quiet and pleasant when we were there three nights before Christmas.  

It was everything I would expect from a 5 star hotel in terms of service and our room was spacious and very comfortable, although perhaps a little lacking in the finishing touches which would suggest opulence - it seemed a little bare somehow. 

Breakfast was very nice but again lacked a few finishing touches, such as baked beans on the hot buffet. There was, however, an impressive array of cold dishes, some of which I've never seen before. It was somewhat disappointing to feel that we were being rushed after our breakfast.  We were told breakfast was served from 7 to 11.  To me that means you should be able to turn up at 5 to 11 and get time to eat a full breakfast.  If they want you out by 11 they should say breakfast is served until 10.15!

These were only minor quibbles really in what was a very pleasant treat, which was a bargain with Avios.",4,2013,01,06
150,Good stay!,"Rooms are good sized, cleanliness is spotless and the staff is very friendly. They accomodated our late check out request for two o'clock.
High priced internet is a minus (all five star hotels should have it included in the rate, and not charge it separately). Concierge could be more friendly. An answer like ""come down and pray for a cab"" on December 31st at night is not exactly what you want to hear, especially when, after getting down very early, it took us 30 seconds to find a cab.
Did not make any meals at the hotel.",4,2013,01,05
150,Pommery champagne brunch,"5 of us went on a sunday for a birthday surprise, wow it was fantastic great value for money and unlimited Champagne, red or white wine all soft drinks, tea coffee and all you can eat from everything you can think of including english breakfast, roast dinner desserts to die for and even a chocolate fountain!",5,2013,01,04
150,Great business hotel,"This is a great hotel for business travellers and for people seeking luxury. Spacious and clean rooms, but thin doors as I could easily hear the conversations from the aile. The personnel and especially the cleaning ladies were friendly. Very good, central location and easy to travel from Heathrow.",4,2013,01,04
150,"Beautiful Location, ok stay...","The rooms are very clean and spacious but the minibar is EMPTY!! Perfect location with a few eating options around and the biggest advantage being the Marble Arch station 3-5 mins walking and Hyde Park more like 5-7 mins walking. Breakfast was a big disappointment and the in room dinning was really a joke, unimpressive and highly priced. The hotel staff was courteous and ready to help though.",4,2013,01,03
150,"After 40 years, still shining with luxury and friendliness","40 years ago, we treated us the luxury to stay for the first time at this hotel (...and incidentally met Rod Stewart in the hall). Now 40 years later, returning from a vacation in the US we thought of spending three days in London on the way back to our home and chose again The Churchill. During all this time and especially since it has been taken over by the Hyatt group, it has not changed a bit .....and this is ment complimentary indeed. The luxury is still there and the friendliness of all the staff is almost unrivalled. Internet was complimentary in the room and if you stay at the bit more expensive rooms in the 8th or 9th floor (Club) you get breakfast, snacks and drinks (including alcoholic drinks during certain hours) free of charge. The checking in- and out is on the 8th floor and whatever you need is being organised for you. We have taken a room with our grown-up daughter and did not have to pay an extra breakfast for her (in other hotels, especially in all the Intercontinental hotels, you always pay a heavy extra fee for a third breakfast). During those rainy days in London, we were offered an umbrella, which helped to walk over to the shopping paradise on Oxford Street, which was only a few steps away. 
The rooms were somewhat small, but then again that is normal in London .... in fact in most European cities. 
In short, we enjoyed it very much at The Churchill, although this time we did not see Rod Steward or any other notables. The prices of the rooms are high, but then tell me anything which is reasonably priced in London. So if you do not shy the higher price for luxury, I would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,12,31
150,"Good stay, very central.","Rooms are clean and spacious, first 5 star hotel I've been to with an empty minibar (found that weird). Very central location. The only disappointing thing would have to be the buffet breakfast - lack of choices, unimpressive and ludicrously priced (for what you get). Friendly staff.",4,2012,12,28
150,Not what i expected,"This hotel could be great,the only problem realy is the service,far from be good,the rooms are very clean and up to a general standard,i just wish the front desk people would be more kind!regards room service. . . . . you just simply CANT ask for more tips!!!!!(and that happen to me)
F.C.",3,2012,12,27
150,Good choice for a central London hotel,"I always expect London hotels to be a bit crap so this one was a nice surprise.  The building's nothing to write home about - an unremarkable apparently post-war pile - but it's very comfortable, with good service.  My party and I had 'club' rooms on the eighth floor.  Rooms were a decent size with good bathrooms (though with the usual, hard-to-figure-out Hyatt shower controls) and wifi (though you pay for it).  The breakfast, part of the deal, was excellent and available in of two 'club lounges' on the same floor - delicious bacon and egg and a wide range of other treats.  The lounges' 'happy hour' offerings at the other end of the day didn't offer much in the way of food like a lot of Asian hotels, but were nevertheless a pleasant place for a drink.  There's no business centre as such, but staff at the eighth floor desk were very helpful and friendly assisting with printing out documents (the system is you email any documents you need printed to them).
The Churchill is in a brilliant position - around the corner from Oxford Street, and only a few minutes' walk from Hyde Park, Mayfair, Marylebone High Street and the Wallace Colllection - and there'd be few parts of central London further than an hour's walk away.",4,2012,12,25
150,"Outstanding hotel: location, service and comfort in central London","This is hands down one of my favorite hotels anywhere. While I'm not always a fan of Hyatts, this is a gem. Public areas are noteworthy, with interesting art work and a good array of services. Restaurants and the two bars are surprisingly good. For those familiar with Hyatt's US hotels, note that their overseas properties are in the main a full star above their US counterparts. This hotel is easily two stars above US Hyatt Regency hotels. 

I've stayed at the Churchill 4 times and have reserved rooms on their concierge floors - which they call Club floors. There is a separate reception and check-in area and the service is particularly good. When we checked in, the concierge greeted us and made arrangements to get us to the airport three days later. He also helped arrange a small cocktail party in our suite - we were only going to be in London for a couple of nights and wanted to entertain our friends in the hotel rather than using our brief time traveling around London. 

Our suite was small but outstanding in a number of ways: it was very nicely furnished, had a small but handily stocked wet bar, a small dining table and, best of all, a terrace with a view of Grovernor Square. The bedoom was on the small side but perfectly designed. The bath was large, had access to the closet (doubling as a dressing room) and had a separate tub. 

Though we didn't really spend much time in the Club, they have an outstanding happy hour: lots of savory and sweet snacks, cocktails and soft drinks. The food was outstanding: fresh, creative and plentiful. 

The concierge was a great help in arranging transportation to a friend's house for Sunday lunch and to the airport the next day. He also helped arrange a last-minute indulgence: a spa massage late Saturday evening. He managed to find a therapist to come into the hotel on very short notice. While the services were not cheap, the massage was truly outstanding and we were very grateful for the help.

This isn't necessarily a great hotel for small children or for people who are looking for a social-column bar scene. It is certainly not a place for those seeking a bargain, even though I believe they provide good value for even the relatively steep price. Especially on the Club floors, it's a great place for those seeking quiet, understated luxury and excellent, discreet service.",5,2012,12,20
150,I'm moving on.....,"What a difference four years makes! Having stayed here at least once every month this year, the service has just got worse and worse. I book a Regency Club room which includes breakfast. Over the last three months the staff have failed to replenish dishes, juice, fruit etc. forgot our drinks to the extent that this weekend we went outside of the hotel for breakfast. We have been kept waiting at check in for 20 minutes on numerous occasions.... the list just goes on and on. Anyway, I'm off, having written to management nothing has improved, so I will be moving to new accommodation in London and my advise is look elsewhere - this is not 5 star.",2,2012,12,18
150,"Good location, nice rooms, gorgeous lobby","I stayed here for a quick one night stay and found the service staff were excellent, which resulted in an effortless stay. The room was well appointed, with a great bed, the only thing which lets it down is the bathtub shower. For a top 5* hotel I do not believe that it is acceptable to have a combined shower/bath.

The Hyatt Churchill has a beautiful lobby and bar area, and the location being just behind Selfridges on Oxford street means it is perfect for shoppers and also a short walk away is Edgeware road which is perfect for a late night (Arabic) snack.

As someone who spends alot of time in London I must say that I prefer staying in the West End which offers an incredible array of bars and restaurants and still is only a short walk to Bond Street shops or the gorgeous St. James Park. 

All in all this is a high quality hotel, I have no objection to recommending it, although I probably wouldn't, as for me, Trafalgar Square/The West End is a better location to stay!",4,2012,12,16
150,The service left an awful lot to be desired,"Lots of staff, but we found them to be neither helpful nor efficient.  (Apart from the two ladies serving in the Churchill bar in the afternoon, where the Greek girl was lovely.). The room was 'okay' but it was cold under the duvet.",3,2012,12,15
150,Hard to fault but not quite perfect...,"As a Londoner, I obviously almost never stay in local hotels but used my birthday as an excuse to try The Churchill out recently. 

Overall, a very pleasant stay, which can be summed up as follows:

Positives

- Great location, being a stone's throw away from Selfridges, Bond Street and Hyde Park. Several Tube stations nearby and handy for exploring other parts/attractions of London. 

- Elegantly appointed and well maintained public area and rooms/suites. Granted, mine was a suite with a balcony on the top floor but a friend stayed in a standard room which was totally agreeable. 

- Gold Passport Diamond status was properly recognised (not always the case with Hyatt... More on that in my next review) and treats (bottle of red and chocolates plus a handwritten welcome note from the GM) were waiting in our suite upon arrival.

- Book in advance and the rate is astonishingly good for a central London hotel of this calibre.

- Professional, helpful and courteous staff.

Negatives

- For a Category 7 property, the food and beverage in the club lounge were slightly under par (compared to, say, Grand Hyatt in Hong Kong). 

- Was surprised by the absence of an in-house spa.

What you must not miss is, if staying over the weekend, the Sunday champagne brunch. Enjoy!",4,2012,12,14
150,First Class Hyatt,"Stayed for one night with small infant (9 Months)
Check in was very smooth and was allocated a room quickly despite arriving 2 hours prior to check in time
Room was very spacious and also included a cot as requested.
Room was clean, tidy and the decor was very nice
Hotel is perfect location as minutes walk from Oxford St, Marble Arch & Hyde Park
All the staff were very friendly and efficient
The food here is quite expensive but this is par for the course in London but you pay for what you get and this certainly did not disappoint.
Would recommend this hotel with no hesitation",5,2012,12,12
150,Exceptional service,"Was put in a room where there was a smell of smoke from an adjacent room. When informed, staff immediately acted. The manager on duty sent up some hot chocolate wishing me a good evening and to let him know personally should the smell come back. Although they had put in a cleaning system for the ventilation, the smell returned the next day and they upgraded me to the Regency Club Floor to a fabulous room overlooking Portman Square, and enjoying a private concierge and lounge area. 

Pros: Excellent, personalized service
Beautiful rooms with luxurious details in linens, robes, etc
Amazing breakfast buffet and restaurant
Lovely lobby with fantastic live lounge music at night

Cons: Some rooms on the lower floors that have doors in between adjacent rooms have absolutely no sound insulation so make sure to ask for a room without adjacent door access. 
Gym is a disappointment -small room with hardly any machines
No spa",5,2012,12,12
150,i am lost for words,after talking to the hyatt london and showing them how unhappy we was after our last stay. We was in shock as it all went wrong again...ie rooms not ready! rooms not cleaned! gone off fruit! took 3 hour to get room cleaned after calling & calling!( now being member i am really starting to think what is going on with the hyatt.,1,2012,12,12
150,Great lobby,We stayed here as a family in two rooms last week. We found that the check in personnel were friendly and helpful. The rooms were however less fancy than the lobby although we chose the cheapest rooms. The location is great and the breakfast amazing with a very large variety of dishes to chose from. In all it is a great hotel but feel the rooms did not live up to the impressive lobby and restaurant.,4,2012,12,11
150,Cant beat the location or the rooms,"Having spent many nights at the Marriott at Marble Arch and Hilton Metropole, I was abel to re-visit the Churchill. Fortunately the rate was within budget . It was an an exceptional stay .....the rooms are large and well furnished. They even threw in free interest for the month of December. The location is great for business or pleasure...highly recommend. Miles ahead of its competitors!!!",4,2012,12,10
150,Company Christmas Visit,"This year the four of us decided to do a show in London, stay in a 'nice' hotel and have dinner.  Jersey Boys visited at the Prince Edward Theatre - a short taxi ride from the Hyatt Regency.  As we got out of the cab to the hotel - the entrance was busy with people coming and going.  We went to the reception area, where instantly knowing which desk to go to wasnt totally clear - but all was well.  I booked us in with a very pleasant gentlemen behind the desk who offered me an upgrade for an additional £36, advised me we could purchase theatre tickets and 'if there was anything else I wanted to know, just ask'.  As we have spent well over £300 on the rooms already - didnt think I needed to pay additional for a room of the front gardens.  We had drinks - champagne and beers.  We wanted olives, and although they said they didnt have any - they did come up with some - stating it was a joint effort when we thanked the waiter.  Although very open plan, it did feel cosy, with the festive decorations, large log fire, comfy sofas and various chairs.  We dined in the Montague, again open plan in the main area of the lobby - I had the scallops and lobster..... lovely, although could always do with more lobster.... Disappointed with the irish coffee's which looked more like normal coffee as you had to put in your own sugar!!!!!!!!!  Overall a lovely experience, been there, done that.",4,2012,12,10
150,Great hotel and rooms,"A great hotel in a great location.    The staff was very professional, efficient, and friendly.  
The room was beautifully decorated and well laid out.    
The location was very convenient to the tube station, shopping, and dining.
Speaking of dining, The Montagu in the hotel provided me one of the most exceptional meals I have ever had.   The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  
On our last day the new bar/cigar lounge was opening. I look forward to trying that the next time I am there.       There was a very interesting art installation in the lobby that included 2  extremely large lumber jack looking men.    It was a bit strange but at least they were off to the side.  
I did enjoy the quirky touch of the large Queen Elizabeth II photograph with her eyes closed behind the front desk.  
All in all, this was a great stay and ou can't go wrong with staying at this location.",5,2012,12,09
150,"Clean and almost ok room, service not up to par","Great location, decent room, but staff are a let down.

Approaching the reception, which was not handling any guests at the time we were interrupting two receptionists in their private conversation. This was visibly not appreciated. When I finally managed to get their attention, she complained that there was a separate reception for the club floor - as a first time guest at this Hyatt, I did obviously not know.

Breakfast at the club floor is very busy. So busy that staff had nicely folded a napkin for me, that had been used by the guest before. I only realized the chocolate stains, after my breakfast. Staff was apologetic, I was disgusted. Today I was asked to leave the lounge because of capacity constrains, I was there to do some work, but they suddenly had a queue with people wanting for breakfast. It is annoying, but being nice, I did not want to make a fuss. Perhaps their staff should manage the crowd according to the status of their memberships, rather by their age and appearance. 

Last point with regards to the room. Ours had been refitted to a double from a twin. This means the bed had been exchanged. However the panels on the wall was still set for twin bedding and the electric socket pointed right at my head. For the price tag at the Hyatt this is simply not acceptable.",2,2012,12,09
150,"Great location, excellent service!","I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency during a trip to London over Thanksgiving and frankly I was wowed!

Here are the key aspects of my stay:

1. Location- Excellent location 2 blocks from bustling Oxford St. There are many cafes and shops in the area of all price points. The closest Tube Stop is Marble Arch but Bond Street tube stop is only about a 10 minute walk in the other direction. 

2. Service- The Hyatt staff were very impressive. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Within minutes of arriving in our room, they called to offer us a complimentary bottle of wine. The cleaning staff always had a genuine cheerful hello for us in the mornings and the Concierge staff eagerly provided umbrellas and offered to help with directions. 

3. The Hotel- Our room was well equipped with everything one could want including a US power outlet and an empty fridge. There were several bars, a spacious restaurant and a small stylish shop selling Comme des Garcons perfumes. 

4. Food- We had access to the Club Level and were impressed with the lavish complimentary breakfast buffet. The only advice I would offer is that the Club gets very crowded early on the weekend mornings so it is best to go later, around 10:30 am. The majority of patrons at the Club were Middle Eastern.",5,2012,12,07
150,Clean upscalish in good location - but no free wifi,This is a super hotel. Clean and upscale. Given the relatively high price it's fair value but nothing more. Good location close to Marble Arch and tube station. Free wifi but not in rooms which is annoying. All in all recommendable.,4,2012,12,04
150,Great location very comfortable,"What we liked:
The location was really convenient to tube stations and particularly Oxford Street (2 blocks away).  We walked back from a play at the Gielgud and it was actually faster than the cab going over.  The rooms were a nice size, clean and comfortable.  The shower/tub can be a challenge due to the height of the tub so if there is any mobility issue, ask for one of the rooms designed for mobility impaired (there are only a couple so reserve in advance).  Would definitely stay there again.  The free wi-fi in the lobby was a great bonus.  Staff was helpful.

What could be better:
Some of the services were outrageously expensive (don't even think about making a phone call).  The restaurant staff was really good for the most part but it appears that no one is assigned a station so there is no single person responsible for checking back in to see if you need anything, you just have to catch someone's attention as they are going by, not a big deal but not particularly effective.  We were at the hotel for a week and struck up conversations with different staff and they were friendly and interesting.",4,2012,12,04
150,"Excellent location, comfortable rooms","We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break - amazingly close to Oxford street and comfy rooms. Hotel manager was nice to offer us a lovely cake and bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary night. The executive lounge is very nice and make sure that you are well fed along with a decent collection of spirits and wines. Overall a very nice and relaxing break we had. Thank you, Hyatt !",4,2012,11,28
150,this is a review of the new Churchill bar that opened just last week,"the bar is great! beautiful design, fantastic staff and of course an incredible cocktail menu.

I don't have much to stay but to recommend as it's one of the few places that stays open quite late. (2am? 3am?)

We really enjoyed ourselves and are sorry we stayed so late :)",5,2012,11,27
150,"Spacious and updated rooms, excellent location","I was spending a couple of days in town after a business trip and booked this hotel on a whim because I had some points to spend and covering only the remaining day saved some cost. Really pleased to discover that its only a block or two away from Oxford Street (Marble Arch end) and Selfridges isn't far away! The central location also ensures that most museums are not far away by tube or bus so its a great base for sightseeing or shopping.

Each and every staff that I encountered at the hotel were friendly and courteous, from the emails that front desk staff sent in advance of my arrival to the room service staff serving food or removing trolleys.

The rooms are also surprisingly large and spacious with every amenity that you need stocked. I will definitely stay here again and will recommend it to friends.",5,2012,11,25
150,One of the best in London,"Staying at The Churchill is always a pleasure. As a regular traveler to London, I find myself choosing Hyatt Regency as often as I possibly can. Service is impeccable, rooms are spacious and luxurious (in the classic sense) and the location is superb for business and shopping. I must confess that I've gotten to an age where hip designer hotels bore me, so stepping back into a traditional luxury hotel is relaxing and refreshing. The breakfast is great, and I can't think of a hotel with more professional and courteous staff. Think I have to book another stay very soon.",5,2012,11,23
150,Great hotel for a weekend in London,"Spent a long weekend in this hotel and found it to be very attractive, good value and in a great location. The public area is spacious with a couple of good restaurants and late night dining is possible.  On my first night I asked for room-service and was pleased with the quick delivery, great food, and attractive presentation.  My room was spacious, immaculately clean, fresh and modern with a large comfortable bed, plenty of light and perfect housekeeping services.  Easy connection to Wifi although they did charge £51 for the weekend.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,11,22
150,my favourite in London,"I have stayed several times to this hotel, very satisfied, very centrally located, cosy, spacious rooms, clean with big and comortable beds,  room rates are a bit high but for a reason. In order to get a good deal you have to book either 2 weeks in advance or fo for weekend rate,
I have stayed in different hotels in London but to put it in a nutshell,when at Churchill's I feel at home.",5,2012,11,21
150,"Lovely hotel, fabulous location and excellent service","We just stayed for one night for my birthday.

On arrival into room, we found it to be spacious, well equipped and immaculately clean.

We were off to the theatre that night and didn't dine there but enjoyed complimentary drinks, canapes and nibbles in the executive lounge from 5.30pm which was a lovely touch!

On arrival back to our room that evening, the beds were turned down and there was a bottle of bubbly and a birthday cake left for me.

Breakfast was excellent next morning.

The hotel is large, stylish, cosmopolitan, fantastically placed overlooking Portman Square (2 minutes walk from Selfridges) and without doubt we'd stay there again.",5,2012,11,20
150,Location,"Location is perfect. It is very close to Oxford street 1-2 blocks. The rooms are nice in size. We didn't eat there as there were so many good eating places close by. The staff was nice and courteous. There was some construction going on in the front when we visited in April, so that caused a bit hassled getting in and out specially during rain, but other than that it was very nice. Our room was far away from construction, so it didn't bother us much.",4,2012,11,20
150,Stayed here a few times and liked it,I stayed here a few times when I am out with mates. It is centrally located and you can get to most places with a short taxi ride. The breakfast is great in the morning. Can comment on the restaurant in the evening as we are always out in bars or restaurants. The rooms are good quality.,5,2012,11,19
150,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights and were very pleased. We arrived around noon on a Saturday and were able to check in right away. Throughout our stay, the hotel was busy, but the staff was welcoming and helpful. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and modern. Our room overlooked the small park. As a Hyatt platinum member, we were given complimentary (fast) internet access. The hotel is located close to Oxford Street, which is convenient for shopping. We ordered room service twice and would recommend it.",5,2012,11,15
150,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here on points right after my fiance and I got engaged. Upgraded to a suite with a bottle of champagne and a congratulatory cake waiting for us. Wonderful staff, wonderful hotel, wonderful location, wonderful city! Would definitely stay again.",5,2012,11,15
150,Incredible and so helpful,"My boyfriend arrived a day before I did for work and I followed shortly after and decided to take a shuttle from the airport to the Marble Arch bus stop which I was told was near the Hotel and only cost 13 pounds from Luton airport.  Well it sure was and to be specific this hotel is close to 2 metro stops (Marble Arch and Bond Street) and the 48 hour hop on hop off tour bus starting point.  I was in tourist paradise!

The room was very modern and we stayed in 732 which overlooked the park.   

I'm embarrassed to say that I had a preconceived notion that the locals may be a bit cold and stand offish but am so happy to say how wrong I was.  Every employee and local we encountered were so friendly and full of advice on what to do and see in the city.  One thing that really impressed me was that in my rush to pack I somehow managed to forget my charger for my ipad.  The great thing is that they offer charging stations in the lobby where you can just walk up and plug in for a quick boost. I tried the docking station on my second night but my ipad seemed a bit finicky and I was approached by an employee named Waris who noticed I was having some trouble and came over to help.  He too found that it wasn't working and told me he would get a wall charger for me and returned 5 minutes later and while I had a glass of wine and an appetizer my ipad charged. 

 Well the next day I returned again and asked another employee for the wall charger for the ipad and they gave me a funny look and told me that Waris was there and could help me again.  When I asked him why the other employee didn't know where the wall charger was he told me that he had run down to his locker and gotten his personal charger for me to use and asked me to wait 5 minutes so he could grab it again.  I just thought that was really going above and beyond!!!  

Our stay there was fantastic and we really enjoyed being so close to metro stations, parks, shopping and there's even shisha restaurants 2 streets over that made this so much fun for us.",5,2012,11,15
150,Excellent service and central location,"We booked the club level for a week-end with the family and it has proven a very good choice. We arrived early and as the rooms were not yet available they kindly invited us for a breakfast. Check-in personnel were extremely caring and made sure we got the requested communicating rooms for the family. Rooms are the usual Hyatt standard, not so exciting but quiet, very comfortable and with all needed amenities. For a shopping w-e in London, the hotel is ideally located, a few meters away from Selfridges and 10 minutes walk to Regent street. Doorman and concierge were very helpful and have a lot of good tips for shopping and eating. A great place in London!",5,2012,11,14
150,Outstanding,"From arrival to departure - the hotel staff paid attention to all details of a business traveler. Prompt responses to requests at the Montagu restaurant where the all day dining cafe offered excellent continental and american breakfast choices. The pastries and homemade museli are not to be missed. 

The hotel had an excellent location - just walking distance away from the shopping district which proved to be an attractive selling point even for business travelers. The club on the 8th floor is also one of the best I have seen, nice and quiet corner for a morning read and for ad hoc meetings with my business partners. 

The rooms are comfortably size and offered very swift and top notch internet connection. The service offered by the concierge for a first trip to London I must say, is one of the best I have seen so far among luxury 5 star chains - be sure to look out for Gerard. 

Excellent hotel with top notched service! I will be sure to return.",5,2012,11,14
150,Favourite London hotel,"As a Diamond Passport member of Hyatts loyalty  scheme I spend a lot of time in Hyatts clearly. Typically in Asia in Singapore ,Hong Kong,Jakarta etc but have to say of all of them London's Churchill remains  my favourite till now. I have been staying here since they moved from the Carlton Towers property which I also frequented monthly.The front desk staff are very pleasant and helpful as are the staff on the concierge desk who never fail to meet a request for information or assistance and always seem to do so with humour and good naturedly. Rooms are typical London hotel rooms ie not spacious but certainly adequate and always immaculately clean and presented and have to say I sleep better here than any other Hyatt for some reason. The Club floor is a refuge from the hustle and bustle and a good place to wind down at the end of a day so well worth the upgrade if you need it. My only minor niggle was that on the last trip the Churchill Bar was closed for remodeling which is a shame as it was always one of the best traditional bars in town.Now it seems it will become a champagne bar as if London needed yet another one but I am assured some of the elements of the old bar will be saved so let's see.Food outlets are of a high standard but the lounge is just too small so you can easily find yourself wanting for a table mid-afternoon which is a shame as tea here is another great relaxation.One last comment,the front office staff seem to change very frequently which maybe says something about the Churchill's retention abilities.Shame,some of them ar fantastic.",5,2012,11,13
150,For Hyatt Loyalists,"We returned to this centrally-located hotel for a Hyatt Rewards trip using our points and were not disappointed. We booked onto the club level and wow, whatever you do, get to the club level. It's so much more relaxing and peaceful than the bustling lobby bar and restaurant. They serve complete breakfasts in the morning, including eggs made to order, and supply papers and CNN International to wake up to. In the evening, cocktail hour goes for at least two hours, and there is an ample selection of appetizers - hot and cold - along with any cocktails you wish. We actually enjoyed it so much that when we went out for dinner, we often just got salads. The rooms are well suited for business or pleasure and even include smoking rooms (very rare these days, but the hotel clearly caters to an Eastern European/Middle Eastern clientele), and the bathroom was spotless and spacious. Best part of the hotel is that it is two blocks from Marble Arch and Oxford Street, making it extremely easy to take the bus or underground anywhere. Worst part? For some reason, the elevators are always crammed with people. Best nearby restaurants are The Portman (also quite a good pub) about a five minute walk away and the The Grazing Goat, which is around the corner.",4,2012,11,12
150,Great location - rooms are typcial London cramped,"As you might guess, I was not in an upgraded room.   It had the bed, a chair and table and a mini desk and chair.   The issue was that really you had to be lying in bed to watch the TV...so I did a little rearranging of the furniture.  The windows only open about 2 inches...I love fresh air.  There are very, very few drawers (where was the valet to help me figure out where to put all my clothes???) lol.  The staff was pleasent enough - but really nothing special.   For a 5 star hotel and price, I somehow expected more.   There was free wifi (I am not sure if that is because I am a Hyatt member) and there are also two computers in the lobby with printers for quick prints.  The cleaning staff is top notch...excellent job done every day and twice a day.  It is a very international hotel...you hear many languages in the lobby and they do cater to the oil rich countries.  Shopping and eating is great and you MUST visit the Wallace collection- only a block or so away.   (nice restaurant at the Wallace collection).   Those half shower doors are really annoying - water goes everywhere for those of us accustomed to US showers.  I expected towels heater racks that worked...!",4,2012,11,12
150,Very good hotel,"I am a regular guest at the hotel and all I can say is that it is a great hotel. Staff are very pleasant and helpful, the rooms are very nice and the location is superb. Generally very good value compared to what you find in the neighborhood.",4,2012,11,11
150,Another Excellent Stay,"We use this hotel to stay over in town following Christmas and industry events.  Consistently good for this level of hotel.  Extremely professional staff, atmospheric bars, a great breakfast room, very comfortable and well appointed rooms and a great location. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for.  Will be returning.",5,2012,11,10
150,Visit The Churchill Every Year,"We visit London at least once per year and always stay The Churchill.  Why do we stay here?  Because of the location, great staff, terrific accommodations, lovely Club floor and lounge, and the list goes on.  It's nice to be a bit off the beaten path but only two blocks from Oxford Street and very close to Hyde Park and many fun neighborhoods.  We are returning the last week in November and look forward to the seasonal decorations and atmosphere.",5,2012,11,10
150,Great location,"What makes this hotel special is the location.off Oxford str and very near to two main tube stations,Bond str and Marble arch.Rooms are tired and need a renovation but on the other hand they do have all amenities needed.Breakfast was delicious with a huge choice.
Having said all that I really think that this is a good hotel and I would stay here again mainly because of the location and the service.",4,2012,11,09
150,"Standard hotel with modern bedrooms and public areas, in great shopping location","This hotel is used fairly routinely by our colleagues when visiting our London office. I stayed here when attending a two day business offsite where we utilised a couple of conference rooms. Compared to the best conference hotels this hotel is poor. Facilites are not really fit for purpose except for small meeting rooms. No real break out areas for food and beverages etc. We booked two meeting rooms so that we had a coffee/ break area. Facilites for a conference adequate at best and probably second rate in reality. I would not recommend.
Bedroom was standard but bathroom was small with narrow bath that made standing for shower a bit awkward. Bed was king size and comfortable.",3,2012,11,09
150,Beautiful hotel with amazing location,"We are just back after a weekend in London staying at this hotel. It's absolutely beautiful. The staff was amazing - from the front desk, to the people in the restuarant and bar to the maids and ""bellboys"".

We had two rooms, and in one of them there was put in an extra bed. The room with the extra bed looked like it was the smallest of the two, but it was okay for the weekend. The rooms are pretty and so are the bathrooms. Very good shower, but it was a bit complicated. 

We had breakfast included. And it was wonderful - big selections in bread, hot dishes, cold dishes, fruit ++. We all looked forward to the breakfast. We also had the afternoon tea one afternoon - worth the money!

The only thing we didn't like was that people staying on our floor smoked in their room, and this was very easy to smell in our room too. Not good!

The locations is amazing. 2 minutes from Oxford Street. You can walk to the shops, restaurants and pubs. Warning: we god robbet at the pub closest to the hotel. We never waited for cabs when we needed that, and it was only when we were really tired we needed to take one.

All in all: I would really love to go back! I have already recommende it to co-workers.",4,2012,11,06
150,Flawless family weekend in London,"Flawless performance from the Hyatt team ! We booked the family escape package for a 3 day week end.
2 connecting rooms, one with a king bed , one with twin beds for our kids, a big bus tour package and family breakfast included. An overall excellent stay.
Positives : excellent location, quiet surroundings with shopping within minutes, comfortable and spacious rooms, very attentive service, an excellent breakfast buffet 
A negative ? The nice but amateur service at the Montagu restaurant ",5,2012,11,05
150,"Good sized rooms, good service","Good professional service combined with the personal touch made for a very pleasant stay.  Well priced grade to Regency Floor provided that little extra that enabled my daughter to feel 'very important' on her first 5 star experience.  The rooms were large and comfortable.  The only thing I missed was the option of a walk in shower, but that's just me being picky!  Would definately return.",5,2012,11,05
150,Utterly Marverlous,"We had a great stay in this hotel, and highly recommended on both their conditions & locations.  Not a complain, but would be more perfect if we (i.e non smokers) were not being put onto a smoking floor (i.e 5th floor).   Otherwise this is definitely my favourite hotel in Ldn.  Staffs are helpful, breakfast is great and definitely worth a return!",5,2012,11,04
150,Great hotel close to everything,"We had a great stay in this hotel last October. We arrived after an overnight flight, at 10a.m. and they let us check-in early. The staff was very gently and helpful. The room was very comfortable, and spacious. Our room had a king size and a roll away bed, and still there was plenty of space. Both were very nice. The hotel is located close to everything: a 5 min walk from underground, Oxford Street and Marble Arch. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby, and there is a very nice restaurant inside the hotel (Locanda Locatelli). The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very nice, with us and my daughter (7 years old). It was really a great stay and I can't wait to go back to London and stay at The Churchill again!!!!",5,2012,11,03
150,Awesome!,"This is definitely my favorite hotel in London.  I arrived after one of those long overnight flights, and the check-in could not have smoother.  They helpfully accomodated an early check-in so I could rest before heading out on the town.

The room itself was super comfortable,and the hotel is located on a beautiful, quiet square in a great area of the city.  It's only a short work to the metro and to shopping along Oxford St., and there are plenty of good dining options close by.

What really sets the Churchill apart though is it's awesome staff - everyone really went out of their way to make me feel at home.  I am looking forward to staying at the Churchill again.",5,2012,11,01
150,Fantástico!!,"I stayed over the summer with the family and we had a wonderful time, the hotel is amazing, staff is very friendly, Gerard the concierge is brilliant, very helpful and nice guy. I can't wait to come back!!! I absolutely loved the hotel, great location, very very clean and comfortable.",5,2012,10,31
150,Churchill himself would love this place,The London Churchill is one of my favorite hotels in London. The 1st time we took my kids to London we stayed there and they have fond memories. We went there last month as my husband’s niece was playing in a Jazz Band in London. We upgraded to a suite using points. Our room was not ready when we got there so we had breakfast in the club. It was as wonderful as we remembered it. This is our 4th stay at this hotel. The room was ready shortly after we finished breakfast and a after couple of pots of tea. The hotel was completely booked because it had been fashion week there. The service was excellent. We loved the club especially because they have one for adults only. We currently have reservations there for early January and cannot wait because the Churchill Bar will be open again!,5,2012,10,29
150,SUPERB SERVICE IN A LOVELY HOTEL,"We were 4 girls celebrating our 50th Birthdays and reserved our rooms several months in advance, getting a very good rate indeed. Before arrival a text message asked if anything was needed during the stay. Upon arrival we were wished Happy Birthday at the front desk,and then upgraded to the Executive floor. We had access to the Executive Lounge which was perfect after a hard day walking around London. Just before heading out for the night we had a birthday cake and bottle of champagne delivered one of the rooms. Breakfast the next morning was lovely with excellent service. The hotel could not have been better. We really had a wonderful time.",5,2012,10,29
150,"Great location, great service!","This is a great hotel for doing business in north, of central london. The hotel is modern and very comfortable, the standard rooms are not large but have all the essentials and are very well laid out. Bonus here is that they have USA voltage so no need for adapters . The breakfast is really the best choice I have ever had in a business hotel. The staff are very helpful and the hotel is spotless. Selfridges and Oxford street are just around the corner. Highly recommend",5,2012,10,27
150,Great birthday treat,"Booked this hotel for an18th birthday treat for our son for a weekend away in London. It certainly lived up to its 5 star rating. Beautifully appointed, staff all welcoming and appreciative of our custom. As there were 5in our party, we arranged to have an additional bed in one of the rooms. Experience indicates this is likely to be an ancient, flimsy camp style bed but here ..no. It had a substantial wooden frame with a proper mattress. So good sleep for us all.
I can't comment on the food as we chose to go round the corner to The Hungry Goat for breakfast, which was excellent and reasonably priced.
Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2012,10,26
150,"Solid Hyatt, Great Location","I have stayed at many Hyatt Hotels (over 200 nights in 2010) and booked this hotel for our UK vacation using points.  We had an issue with our room at check in, but the staff resolved it quickly.  The staff we interacted with provided outstanding customer service.  The location, just off of Oxford St, was perfect.  We were able to quickly move around the area or hop on the tube.  The room was nice, the beds comfortable; just what you expect from a Hyatt Regency.  The Churchill Bar, on the property, was a great place to unwind after a busy day. 

My only knock is the Hyatt puts this property as a Class 6 hotel.  I have stayed at the Park Hyatt in Washington DC and Chicago, and I think those hotels are superior to this one.  That said, I would stay here again, if I were going to pay.  If I were using points, I would stay at the Andaz on Liverpool Street.",4,2012,10,24
150,Great hotel in high-end London,"This is the closest Hyatt to the US Embassy.  Rooms are very nice size.  Food and beverage service here was excellent as was the staff.  The only issue I had here was that I was not afforded the ability to not only get an upgrade to a Regency floor room but also not given a pass to the Regency Club given that I am a Hyatt Platinum member.  I also had to have my room changed from 2nd to 5th floor do to remodeling being done on the first floor adjacent to one of the finest Italian restaurants in the city in the Hyatt.  Hotel is located very close to Hyde Park and exclusive Grosvenor section.

We wanted theater tickets so I asked the girl at ticket desk what she could do for 4 tickets to Billy Elliott. She got 4 seats, 3rd row center.  Wow!  What a great show and worth every dollar.",5,2012,10,22
150,top place to stay in London,"Great location, amazing friendly staff, good food and wine and great soft comfy beds.  staff always greet by name and make one feel at home. first class.  the new bar should be a welcome addition as the restaurant area gets full at night with diners and drinkers. great singer/pianist as well.",5,2012,10,10
150,More than adequate.,"Large, centrally located 1970's era hotel close to Marylebone High Street, the Wallace Collection and Hyde Park. Efficient staff,  recently redecorated rooms , bright public areas. Bedrooms clean and attractive with good aircon, power showers and comfortable beds. The Locanda Locatelli Restaurant on the ground floor is one of the best Italian restaurants in the world - you can dine there and have the meal charged to your room.

Pros : Great location. Parking available. Ten minutes walk to the shops, restaurants  and boutiques around uber-trendy Marylebone High Street. Selfridges two minutes away.  Rooms provide all that you would expect froma Hyatt in terms of comfort. Check in speedy and pleasant. Bonus points for having a room available three hours before official check in - a big plus for those coming in on the overnight from NYC .Shopped around and got a rate of $400 a night which is good value by London standards.

Cons : Big hotel with only three elevators. As a result getting to your room can be frustrating if there is a sudden surge of arrivals in the lobby. At the moment the bar is being renovated. This makes the lounge areas extremely busy. The Montagu restaurant is expensive with poor service - it took three attempts to get a glass of wine. Fish and chips undercooked so that the batter was gelatinous. Having a mediocre hotel restaurant is not the end  of the world as there are lots of really good restaurants within a five minute walk. Turn down service worked two nights but didn't show up on the third.

Conclusion : Great location. Easy cab ride to the Heathrow Express from Paddington. Comfortable if uninspiring. Check in staff were a delight. Rooms comfortable. Hotel restaurant is mediocre in terms of food and service - poor food with attitude. The Locanda Locatelli restaurant by contrast is exceptional.
Would stay at this Hyatt again if I could get the $400 rate ( it's usually more expensive ) . Breakfast better eaten out of the hotel to avoid the rush and the $50 charge.",3,2012,10,10
150,"Location...good, service...good, staff...good!","Best thing about this hotel is its location, so even if everything else was bad, it would have something in its favor.
However, the great location is complemented by the exceptional level of service provided by everyone working there. They are always polite & helpful, trying to make your stay as comfortable & enjoyable as possible.
Comparing it to the current prices of most hotels in post-Olympics London (outrageous!!!), one could even argue this one is within reason.",4,2012,10,09
150,"Great hotel, nice location, staff however can do with some smile","Great hotel and love the location..good value for money and one of the finest Hyatt properties...I would only hope the staff is a bit more welcoming, and help folks who are obviously struggling with the luggage...otherwise I will rate them very good",4,2012,10,06
150,"Sophisticated, perfect location","The breakfast at this hotel is fantastic, I highly recommend it 
Overall, service was fantastic from concierge to bar to restaurant, everyone wanted to make sure we had a nice stay.
It was easy to get the main ""tourist"" attractions, and conveniently located near the tube. 
I would love to stay here on my next visit to London.",5,2012,10,03
150,Very Smart and well run,"Booked in for a Saturday night, Service was second to none. Very good reception,rooms smart and spacious. Did not have breakfast there as we were meeting friends. Drinks a bit expensive but you would expect that.
Would look forward to going back.",5,2012,10,02
150,Good Hotel in Central London,"We stayed at the Churchill in September of 2012. The hotel is very nice, though the restaurant is really expenisve and rather limited in the menu. The room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. We got upgraded so they provided us access to the business lounge otherwise without that, the hotel is just a nice hotel in a nice area and you would have to pay extortionately for wifi. That was really strange as we travelled around Europe and in tiny Italian towns you get free wifi but apparently Hyatt Chruchill feels like they have to charge their guests. We were not impressed by this frankly. The location though is fantastic. You are two blocks away from Oxford Street and the marble arch tube station which is on the Central line. All in all a very nice stay.",4,2012,10,01
150,Wonderful London Luxury,"What a great hotel, wonderful service, good sized rooms and top rate club lounge.   Location is extremely central but quiet.  Oxford street is a couple of blocks away, Marylebone walking distance, and lovely restaurants nearby.  Highly recommended!",5,2012,09,27
150,Hands down the best,"After many stays in this Hotel I have to share. Traveling on business through out the world, this Hotel is always a pleasure to come back to. Even after a return months later, staff still remembers your name. From the doorman when you get out of the taxi to the concierge. Service is impeccable! Rooms are larger than usual in London clean with a nice comfortable set-up. If you have a chance to get a room on the Club Level, the food they serve for breakfast buffet style is 5-star and contains all you can imagine. Also the Restaurant in the Lobby is great. 
This Hotel is a true home away from home.",5,2012,09,27
150,Comfortable hotel in the centre,"This is the first time I choose this hotel in London. I choose it because it is close to the big shops in the very central part of the town. I also choose it because I had a good experience with Hyatt hotels in other countries. I was not surprised to found that the hotel is very pleasant, with perfect service, and good breakfast. The rooms are quiet.",5,2012,09,25
150,Nice city hotel,Stayed last month on a business trip.Nice hotel located next to Oxford str.Rooms are the typical rooms of a city chain hotel.Service is good.Breakfast is amazing.And the location is great.Everything someone can ask from a city hotel.,5,2012,09,23
150,Smooth.,"I, like the reviewer below, was there on the Friday night of the fire alarms. (Actually there were three, plus and abortive one as we were returning to our rooms from the third - the whole lobby began laughing.) My sole complaint is that all we got was a murmured apology from one employee. This is indeed a smoothly operating property, with fine housekeeping, quiet rooms, marvelous beds, and a general air of being properly coddled. Live music in the lounge, art work from the Saachi Collection, and when they get the second restaurant done, there'll be a place to dine outside, I believe, which is about all this house needs. 

On the second alarm, I was standing across the street waiting and another guest, returning from his dinner, struck up a conversation. Said he'd stayed here about a dozen times, travels a lot on business from his home in NYC, and this was his favorite, mainly because of the quality of the employees. The front desk, which is pretty much all I dealt with except the night of the fire alarms, was great.",5,2012,09,21
150,"Very, very good hotel in a fantastic location.","Just wrapping up a three night stay here.  I will come back for the location, the service and the sleeping room.

All service experiences were first rate.

The fitness room is a bit small, but was not crowded.

This is a hotel that you make into a destination.",5,2012,09,21
150,Took a fire alarm to make us leave the Club Lounge.,"I must begin this review stating that my wife and I have been Starwood Preferred Guest loyalists since 2002 and staying anywhere outside the SPG family was considered blasphemy; however, our recent stay here (Sept 7-9) may have changed our view of hotels forever!  Sorry for the dramatics; but I will say our stay at the Hyatt Regency London-The Churchill was outstanding.  Possibly the best check-in experience ever.  Adela, at reception, did an absolutely fantastic job at making sure we were treated like platinum members (wish we would have had this type of treatment at some of the SPG properties we've visited). 

We were given a great room on the second floor with access to the club floor lounge.  The club lounge here is simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Great breakfast in the AM and delicious snacks and (alcoholic) drinks in the evening.  Beers, wines, prosecco, gin, whiskey, rum, vodka and mixers!

The hotel is situated in a great location with easy access to the Tube and major bus routes.  

The only negative of our stay were the Friday fire alarms.  We had to evacuate the building during the evening, not a big deal, since we were headed out to dinner at the time.  However, after we returned the hotel was experiencing another alarm and forced a second evacuation for the night.  The hotel staff was very professional and just following procedures.   Kudos to Jamie, for showing our group the stairs back up to our room on the second floor.  Sometimes it pays to be on a lower floor!  Overall, wonderful stay despite the evacuation. Thank you Hyatt Regency London!",5,2012,09,20
150,Lovely hotel with excellent service,"This hotel is one of my favorites in the world....I travel often to London on business and enjoy returning to the Churchill.  The entire hotel has been redone in the last year, rooms facing the park are the best, quiet, free WiFi and if you are lucky enough to stay on the 8th floor (or they give you access to the lounge) you will experience a wonderful breakfast and evening cocktails with snacks. 
The staff is so customer service oriented, friendly and extremely helpful and they remember your name…
I love it here and will return again soon.

Jacqueline Smith",5,2012,09,17
150,Expensive but lovely,The hotel has a great location just a few minutes walk from Oxford Street and really close for a quick cab ride to Paddington Station. The rooms are nice but maybe not quite as plush or attractive as you would think for the price you pay. We were meant to get upgraded ameneties but that didn't happen. We had a club floor room which is well worth the extra cost as you get access to a club lounge where they serve free food and drinks - buffet breakfast so you can eat and drink as much as you like! Breakfast is lovely and the evening canapes/champagne are easily enough to replace your evening meal. Customer service wasn't up to much and not very friendly but the hotel was nice.,5,2012,09,14
150,Great buzz and the best breakfast buffet in London,"Rooms are ideal comfort for linens, Downey duvet,  toiletries, but are rather small in size. Ask for garden view. Never book directly, we didn't get the best deal. The time was during high season, had to call reception three times during the night because many Saudi kids were running in and out of rooms, and each time anyone walks into or out of their room you hear a big bang, it is a defect in the doors closure system, automatic security lock means you will hear each person walking in and out of their rooms?!!!! An absolute nightmare! The breakfast is not matched in any other five stars hotel in London.Big Kuwaiti influence, and many dishes in room service and breakfast carry Arabian flavors,like Homus, labneh, haloumi cheese, etc service is perfection in restaurant. Would love to stay there if the noise from doors opening and closing was resolved. It has a very crowded feel,with waiting in line sometimes for breakfast. But their breakfast is worth it. Try and get it as part of your room deal.",4,2012,09,09
150,A lovely refreshing stay,"This is my third stay at the Churchill and as you can guess its just excellent in every way for me.

The hotel is just lovely, the staff are really very nice and friendly, end to end the staff at the hotel make your stay one which is simply the best. The rooms are nice, comfy bed and amenities ready if you forget anything. The maintenance of the rooms are something I admire, several years in and it's still all very good.

I enjoy my breakfast downstairs, the food is nice, but the staff make it all the better, hats off to you.

Location is great as well, both the marble arch and bond street underground is walking distance hence you can chose different lines to get to and from the hotel. High street with the marks and Spencer's and sainsbury's etc are just a 5 min walk from the hotel as well. 

Will certainly be staying at the Churchill again! ",5,2012,09,09
150,The Chrurchill is Great!,The Churchill is a great location near Oxford Street and the Marble Arch. I loved the club floor with an excellent food selection and refreshments. I can't wait for the less formal restaurant to re-open. The main Lobby restaurant  has a piano player. Great fun. The service staff are very polite. ,5,2012,09,04
150,Excellent Hotel!!!,"I booked this hotel for my husband and son to stay in whilst visiting London during the Olympics.  The hotel was excellent, the rooms of a good size, the beds very comfortable, breakfast amazing, but what made it for them was the staff who were all very friendly!!! We are planning to return to London next year and will be booking for the Churchill so that I can see what all the fuss is about!!!",5,2012,08,30
150,Best Location Excellent Breakfast and Very Good Rooms,"The title says almost everything. 

But one thing that must be said is about the staff: One of the BEST I´ve ever seen in all my trips allover the world. really really neat.

For example, one day I was feeling sick and they left a basket of fruits in my room. And the next day the same thing. 

The breakfast is a  must, like a trully five stars hotel. Dont miss it!

So, it was a wonderful experience that i will recommend forever!

Cant wait to get back.",5,2012,08,29
150,Great hotel,"Stayed here with my wife for a weekend.

We had a couple of minor niggles which the hotel promptly resolved.

The hotel has a great location right in the centre of London and yet manages to give a feel of not being too fast paced.

Really good breakfast on the Sunday.

Overall really good.Will return here.",5,2012,08,27
150,Great for a business trip,"I stayed for a night during a buisiness trip and came away quite satisfied. The room was very comfortable and staff was very pleasant (I needed to use the business centre at 4am and this was no problem) The hotel is conveniently located close to the tube and Oxford street, wasn't much of a factor for me as the company I was visiting was only a block away (hence the choice). I must say the food at the ground floor restaurant was absolutely delicious, do give it a try.

Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2012,08,26
150,Great location but not great value for money,Great location just a short walk from Oxford Street. I've stayed in better value Hyatts but given that you're in the centre of London you have to expect high room prices. The Regency Club was too crowded and you got no sense of intimacy or quality. The ground floor restaurant was much better. Gym facilities are poor. The Saatchi are collection on display in the lobby was a pleasant surprise.,3,2012,08,24
150,The Churchill,"I visited this world class hotel long ago but remember it well , it was the first time i ever had or seen blood orange juice , excellent food and room service , comfortable room , many with excellent views of Hyde Park and the Marble Arch is also very close . On the expensive side though , it is i'd say a five star hotel , the staff were helpful and curtious .",5,2012,08,23
150,Business travelers beware -- club floor should be renamed Club Poor,"From reading my headline, you might think that I stayed once at the club floor, didn't like it and wouldn't return. The truth is that I have stayed there numerous times on business because the positives have outweighed the negatives. But the negatives are now catching up. I'll try to give you a balanced run down.  

Here is the thumbs-down list:

- Club floor rooms are small even compared to London standards. Combine that with low ceilings and poor sound isolation, and the only real upside is that while you suffer from your claustrophobia, you can at least draw comfort from overhearing the whispering of staff and guests milling around in the hallways, day and night.

- The club lounge is surprisingly poor: the breakfast selection is so limited that you will not find any tomatoes, cucumbers, salads etc and the space is really cramped. Prepare for queuing for an unhealthy start of the day. And, whereas the service at the table is usually fast with coffee and tea, you will be in for a long wait if you ask for eggs or omelets etc because there is no proper kitchen ensuite. 

Here is the thumbs-up list:

- Room service works like a spark and the food quality is good although the selection is, well, British.

- The internet connection works at a decent speed.

- Pay-TV is up and running but the portfolio stays the same for months, so for regular stays, you’ll soon run out of options.

- Downstairs (lobby/bar) things are really pleasant and there is space for everyone, staff is busy but accommodating and spirits among guests are usually peaking upwards, in particular around 19-20h00.

Would I stay here (as a business traveler) if I wasn’t a Hyatt regular next time? Probably not at the club floor – all in all, it’s just so tiny and claustrophobic, and when you can’t even get a quick and healthy breakfast, at least I don’t get a good start on my day.",3,2012,08,23
150,Stay with family.,"This time I stayed with family and hotel  did give me large and specious room. It was just wonderfull to at churchill one more time. Staff was firendly and acess to regency club was helpful when we were little hungry at 4 PM : ) 

It is just few minutes walk from Oxford street and all the majour attractions",5,2012,08,20
150,Home away from home,"This hotel has been a favorite of mine for quite a few years now and it continues to improve. Location is super convenient for Oxford street shopping and an easy walk to Marble Arch tube station.  The rooms are nice albeit on the small side. As a Hyatt Diamond I was never not upgraded to a Club room. The club has recently doubled in size and now features hot egg dishes for breakfast. The wifi is blazingly fast and I can’t get enough of their Molton Brown toiletries.

A superb 4 star hotel that I can easily call my home away from home.",5,2012,08,17
150,Fabulous stay - highly recommended,"Stayed here with another couple for the last weekend of the Olympics.  It was booked the day before so very last minute. Excellent staff.  Everyone from reception to cleaning staff were courteous and pleasant at all time.  Spotlessly clean around the hotel and the bedrooms. 

Good size bedroom size for inner London. Excellent linen with gorgeous quality towels and toiletries. Triple glazing so no noise from outside; no noise in corridors either.

Breakfast was the best I have ever had either in the country or abroad.  The selection was endless – hot, cold etc. and you could order something to be specially cooked – e.g. I had the best tasting waffles ever; very light and delicious!  Plenty of waiters during breakfast with food replenished and area kept clean at all times.

Great location – and highly recommended. I would return without hesitation if the price was within my budget.

Thank you everyone.",5,2012,08,14
150,Super stay at The Churchill,"We stayed at the Churchill for three nights during the Olympics. The room was comfortable, overlooking a garden, a large king size bed which was nice and firm, and all amenities you would expect. The staff were all very friendly from the front desk to the concierge, always a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was lovely, hotel in a perfect situation for shopping and sightseeing, just round the corner from Marble Arch tube station.",5,2012,08,13
150,Loved it !,"Well this is a bit late but stayed here or long weekend in December last year. 
From the outside I was a little disappointed for a 5 tar hotel to appear so architecturally bland, but once inside it was 5 star interior all the way! Faces out onto a fenced garden in the centre of the roads
We drove straight to hotel car park (entry in access road at the rear) 
Although busy with Xmas shoppers etc the check in was really quick & very friendly.
The bedroom was very large with a huge really comfortable bed ! I suffer from insomnia but didn't have a problem here !! 
We walked everywhere from the hotel , for shopping its a great location & a stroll over to Hyde park a few mins away.
Breakfast was just about everything you could want, cold buffet of fruit cereals,cakes & middle eastern treats or waiter served hot food on request all included in the breakfast price.
We arrived back tired & late one evening so ordered room service , this was a treat of piping hot food waiter served to a table they set up in our room, then came & cleared away on request.
Rooms have all amenities you could want including an iPhone/pad charger ! 
The on site bar was a lovely atmosphere to chill out in with live pianist & very agreeable bar staff !!!
All staff extremely friendly ,helpful & polite.......can't wait to go back this Xmas !!!!",5,2012,08,12
150,Wonderful staff,"I stayed at the Churchill for three nights during the Olympics.  The room was beautiful, a large king size bed which was very comfortable ,  what more can you ask for.
The staff were all very friendly from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant, always a smile and nothing was too much trouble. 
I can recommend the eggs Benedict for breakfast, excellent start for the day.  Would have liked a pot of coffee on the table at breakfast rather than rely on it being topped up.  But overall I have no complaints
Perfect situation for shopping and sightseeing, will definitely return.",5,2012,08,10
150,First class stay. Pity about the small rooms,"The Churchill is one of the classic top end high quality hotels.
An outstanding location, walking distance to subway, Oxford street shops and Hyde park. ll you could want.

The service from front desk and all staff during the stay was outstanding. The restaurant on Club Floor was superb with brilliant service, good food and good wifi access. A quiet place to work if you have to. An example of the excellent service levels was the staff in the Club lounge providing me access to the conference room because I had a private calls to make.

The only criticism I would have, which is outside their control, is that the rooms are small, but I think this is the standard for London hotels built in the 70s. There was no real 'living space' or even space for a couch in the room.

Secondly, with so many VIPs staying around the period I was there the constant presence of high level security staff and swathes of armed police with machine guns standing outside 24/7 was a bit intrusive and made me feel uncomfortable.

I would gladly return to this hotel with its outstanding and friendly service and brilliant location, but maybe not at such a hectic time, when VIPs and heads of state are sharing the place.",4,2012,08,07
150,Fantastic,"Stayed at the The Churchill on business trip, is was perfekt from the first sight to the last. I will most defenently return. the front desk staff was very correct and helpfull. rooms where perfekt whit at big and long bed. And the breakfast is outstanding.",5,2012,08,07
150,Darned good hotel - for two weeks!,"OVERALL
Spent two weeks at the Churchill leading up to and then during the first few days of the Olympic Games (a BUSY period).  Rooms were almost perfect, lobby was stylish and felt very high-end, location wonderful, service generally good with a few odd nuances.  Also, would be great to have a little gift shop or kiosk IN the hotel where one could get a cheap bottle of water but there are plenty of nearby stores as well.

ROOM
Had a standard king and the bed was comfortable, the room very clean and quiet and in excellent condition.  The bathroom was wonderful and, expecting to be in a SMALL London-style hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised.  I will say (to all Europeans), enough with the hand-held showers and the half-doors - we in America devised a better system and it ends with the whole bathroom not being wet.

FOOD
Had breakfast in the restaurant daily and the food was reliably good and service always friendly if not a touch irregular.  Sometimes a coffee would take 30 seconds to deliver, sometimes there was quite a wait with a weird process of the waiter ordering it through the kitchen.Never ordered room service and didn't eat other than breakfast inside the hotel.

SERVICE
As mentioned, sometimes the wait staff at breakfast were a little irregular in their service but they were still WONDERFULLY friendly and professional.  Housekeeping also did odd things in that they would stack bars of soap every day - I guess in case I went on a soaping spree (one back-up is enough).  And then would also leave glasses that were clearly used and dirty for the next day.

SUMMARY
Highly recommend.  Great location, no real complaints and, again, I was there for about two weeks.",5,2012,08,04
150,Buttoned up!,"Stayed at the Hyatt in a club level king for five nights for the Olympics.  The room was small but well appointed.  Very comfortable bed and plenty of storage.  There are a couple of club lounges all of which offer a nice variety of hot and cold breakfasts daily as well as snacks, wines and beverages.  This hotel is in an ideal location in London - Marble Arch, Bond Street and Oxford Circus tube stops are all in walking distance.  Lots of great restaurants within a short walk from the hotel.  The staff couldn't be more helpful.   Club rooms are on the top floors of the hotel.  At night, even in the city center the room is nice and quiet.  This hotel was fully booked for every night we stayed.  Despite that, they run efficiently.  No waits for anything!  With a full hotel one would expect and forgive hiccups -- we didn't experience any.   We would return to this hotel without hesitation.",5,2012,08,01
150,Loved it!!,"Really liked it, as I came to the hotel the bell men where very helpful I went to the upper level I think it was 4 not sure to check in the Winston Churchill presidential suite I was very happy with my choice lots of room quality luxury and the service I guess it's the Hyatt they always go out of there way for you!! 
Stayed in the Dorchester hotel before also in a suite That's just different level but if you want a reasonable price good service and excellent area it's going to be worth your while!!!",4,2012,07,27
150,Beware the crashing bottles!!!,"Room was fine but certainly not worth the price, however, they insist on disposing of glass bottles post 12:30am and then again in the morning as early as 7am which is not conducive to a good nights sleep.

Do not stay here if you expect a peaceful nights sleep!!",2,2012,07,27
150,A nice hotel in a good location.,"Our family of five stayed here in early July of 2012.  It is a bit secluded but within walking distance of a lot of sights if you like to walk.  The staff was wonderful especially Ms. Jacobs at the front desk.
The service was very good as well.",4,2012,07,25
150,Very Comfortable Room with Impeccable Service,I recently stayed a week at the Hyatt Churchill while traveling on business with a large group of colleagues.  Many of our group had stayed previously at this property and had complained about the size of the rooms.  I found my room to be large (a king size bed) and very comfortable.  The room included a tea service and instant coffee with a hot pot to heat water.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating to any requests that we had.  The hotel is located walking distance to shopping and many sites.,5,2012,07,21
150,PARADISE!,"I stayed in this executive room in the Churchill and it was a quite big room for a executive room. I mean we had 4 huge luggage bags and they fit in perfectly and we still had a lot of space. A good price and service.....I am speechless about that! Th other hotels I have stayed in send the stuff we order after a while but this hotel does it in a snap and every evening ask if we need anything. The staff is so honest because i forgot my iPad on my bed and then we went, the room was cleaned and my iPad was there! Very clean too. It is the perfect hotel...or should I say hotel paradise!",5,2012,07,18
150,Honest and Respectable Services,"We stayed in the Executive Regency Suite for 3 nights from July 13th to July 16th.  The hotel staffs were extremely polite from house keeping to regency club lounge host.   On 2nd day of stay, my wife accidently forgot to put away her $$$$ Tiffany diamond ring plus Tiffany diamond bangle into the safety box after taking off the night before going to sleep, left them on the bedroom night stand.  After we were gone for the entire afternoon to remember and realized they were left on the night stand.  We were worried due to extremely bad service from the house keeping at the previously stayed hotel of a different hotel chain.  However when we returned to our room, her jewelries were all safe and still on the night stand.  We would like to thank and appreciate for the honesty of the excellent house keeping staffs.",5,2012,07,17
150,Love this hotel - feels like home,"We stay in this hotel around once per month (all for leisure) and it is our go to hotel in London. The staff treat us fantastically and we never want to leave. Suites are nice (and good value for London), the club lounge is pretty good and Sunday brunch is amazing. The hotel is quiet (much more so than Intercontinental Park Lane for example), but location is hard to beat. 
We have a number of reviews with pictures on our website - for example, when we were upgraded to the Saatchi Suite (http://www.driven2travel.co.uk/hyatt-regency-london-the-churchill---saatchi-suite.html).",5,2012,07,17
150,Impeccable Service,"My wife and I recently stayed here for 2 nights in July 2012. This was our first visit to London. The Hyatt Regency Churchill displayed some of the best customer service I have ever encountered while staying in a hotel. All of the staff we encountered were exceptionally courteous. We stayed on points in a King room so I cannot comment on the value of the accommodations. The room was spacious enough for the two of us and was very clean. The only negative is that the room was an adjoining room and noise insulation was a problem. We could here everything happening in the neighboring room. This wasn't a huge deal since our neighbor was generally quiet. However, if I were paying full price for the room and not staying on points, I would have had an issue. 

The Hyatt Regency Churchill is conveniently located in the west end of London. A short walk to Oxford Street and Hyde Park. We easily walked to Piccadilly Circus and back. Marble Arch Underground Station is also close by. 

We also had afternoon tea and a dinner in The Montagu Restaurant onsite and both experiences were wonderful. The food was excellent and the service was second-to-none. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy.",5,2012,07,15
150,Excellent dolls house with great staff,"Stayed in a  suite for a month. It took awhile to adjust to the size issue.
It was very small but perfectly formed and felt like living in a dolls house.  Still it was so comfortable that after awhile I became quite fond of my dolls house.

The staff is what makes the Churchill sing.  I dislike hotels that fuss over you I prefer efficiency with good humour. At the Churchill all your needs are smoothly met, so you can make the most of your time in this fabulous city.  The staff, along with the sublimely comfortable bed make the Churchill a great place to stay. 

The Club is also excellent but I don't want to say too much more for fear of making it harder to obtain another booking.

Yes Hyatt should be paying me for this review but they are not. However they need to spend the money and put a pool in there's plenty of room on the room for one.",5,2012,07,14
150,Amazing,"I've stayed at this hotel many times over the years - incredible location, incredible service.  However, I now wonder how they can continue to operate by allowing what I observed tonight.  I upgraded to a club level room and was shocked at what I found returning to my room this evening.  I could not physically get down the hall or to my room for the piles of rubbish, garbage bags and boxes and yes kitchen/cooking equipment.......all being ""packed"" by the occupants of the room across the hall.  there were so many boxes even inside the room one could not get inside, and there were dozens of people, ""customers"", packing and filling the boxes in the hallway saying ""so sorry, we are leaving tomorrow"".  I suggested that the hotel call in the police, to no avail, as obviously something was amiss.  How this ""five star"" hotel allowed not only the mess to accumulate in the hallway, but how these folks got all this material and boxes and cooking equipment through the lobby, up the elevators and into the room in the first place is beyond me.  I've seen this sort of thing in $2.oo rooms in third world countries, but in a supposedly five star hotel in London?  Once my favorite, never again.",1,2012,07,13
150,Great hotel... reliable... lovely... helpful staff,"We have stayed at the Churchill a couple of times, and it is consistent in its service.  The rooms are a good size, and always clean.

The staff are super-helpful.

I am pleased returning client to this hotel.",5,2012,07,13
150,Good but not Amazing,"We stayed one night in a Regency Club room and the room was nice and well appointed except for the bathroom that was small and without a separate shower.

Breakfast in the Club Lounge was very good with an extensive selection. The lounge itself is a bit dark with low ceilings and a rectangular layout, but with nice furniture.

Service was a bit hit and miss, some staff members very good and some less trained. All however seemed well meaning and did their best.

I think that the public areas are bit boring compared to hotels like the Knightsbridge and Four Seasons, but then this is more of a business hotel.",3,2012,07,09
150,Nice business trip in London,"Very good stay here at the Hyatt in London.  Location is excellent - short walk to Hyde Park and lots of excellent shopping and restaurants.  Room is clean and good size.  The bed was comfortable and I was able to sleep well.  Breakfast buffet at the Montagu was excellent and a good choice before going siteseeing.  Gym was on the smaller size but serviceable with a couple of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes.  My biggest complaint was the elevators which were slow - you'll need to be patient when waiting for one.  I will definitley consider staying here again when I come back.",4,2012,07,01
150,Excellent service,"Stayed 3 days in the club level and could not ask for a better experience.  Room was great, the club was exceptional.  Great food and service.  Staff were outstanding.  We'll be back.",5,2012,06,28
150,In the middle of Westminster. Excellent value for the location,"Location is definitely prime (W1). Zone 1, in the middle of Westminster, walking distance ffrom Hyde park and the Tube.
Price was not as high as some other hotels in the same area and the service is outstanding.
The rooms are not as big as you may expect in a 5 stars hotel, but again, who comes to London to spend the day in an hotel room ? :-)",4,2012,06,28
150,Wonderful Stay,"We had a 7 night stay at this property about 2 weeks ago.  We had a Regency Suite King on the 9th floor with a balcony (hardly used due to rain).  The suite consisted of a bedroom, bathroom, and a sitting room.  Both rooms were quite small, which was characteristic of hotels built in the 70's.  The hotel was beautifully renovated, but there wasn't much they could do with the size of rooms.  

Check-in for guests staying on Club floors is at the Club on the 8th floor. The Club has its own concierge staff who are most helpful.  The Club consists of two fairly large areas, each with identical offerings.

The only disappointment we had with the suite was that the door separating the sitting room from the bedroom is only a louvered door.  Our daughter used the sofa bed in the sitting room (very comfortable) and is a night owl.  The lights and TV sound from that room came right through the door.  

The breakfast in the Regency Club was wonderful.  The Club is very heavily staffed and the service is very attentive, if not a bit hovering.  In addition to a buffet of breads, pastries, fruits, and cheeses and meats, the attendants offer you a menu of eggs and omelets. These hot items, along with hot beverages, are served to you by the attendants.  The staff at the Club are clearly focused on a friendly, high level of service.  The only disappointment we had with the Club is that there is really nothing available after 7:30 p.m. even though the Club is open until 11 p.m.   No late evening desserts or alcoholic drinks are available after 7:30, although for some strange reason cake and dessert items are available along with evening appetizers from 5:30 to 7:30. 

The location is very central, with the Marble Arch tube station just a 5 minute walk away.  We took the Heathrow Express into and out of Paddington station and a taxi to/from the hotel. It's about a 15 minute ride from Paddington to the hotel at a cost of about GBP 6 each way.  A prior post had given a ""shortcut"" to the taxi rank at Paddington, but the location has just recently changed and is now on the other side of the station past track #12.  

This was an excellent hotel with great staff and one we will certainly use again.",5,2012,06,22
150,Great but,Enjoyed staying at this hotel but the gym is extremely small and substandard for a hotel of this size.,4,2012,06,18
150,Unbelievable!!! Shocking Service.......Though a nice property,"Im in London, and in the midst of my holiday with my family as we speak.We have been at The Hyatt for 6 days now(and have another 4 to go).....This is arguably the worst hotel stay I have had in the last 10 years. And coming on the back of a 5 day stay at The Four Seasons, it makes it even harder to compare. 

In any case, we chose this hotel, because we wanted to indulge ourselves and stay in a nice, well serviced, well managed property. The alternative was a Service Apartment, which we chose to forgo in favour of the Churchill. At almost GBP 4000, I would expect at least the rooms to be cleaned, the beds to be turned down, glasses and trash to be cleared........Guess what? At The Churchill, you don't get any of the above. 

Im travelling with two young children, and coming back to a room at 10pm, after a long day, in which the beds arent made, and glasses aren't cleared, is tragic. The Hotel Manager, Mario Flanagan, with whom I spoke two days ago, and who assured me at the time, that he would ensure that these issues wouldn't occur again, leaves me a tad disappointed. I can't remember the last time we had reason to complain at any hotel we stayed at, forget have to dial the Hotel Manager at 1030pm

The staff is generally friendly, the reservations were extremely helpful and gracious in accomodating all our requests, the concierge service is helpful and knowledgable

The hotel is extremely well located. Very convenient in every sense of the word. Now, if only they would start running it like it should be. It may actually move into a good hotel category

Disappointing service, and even more tragic that the issue repeats itself. Not a compliment to any hotel in the World. Definitely expected far better......",2,2012,06,17
150,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights and really liked the friendly front desk staff, Niki.
The room was spacious, clean and nicely presented.",5,2012,06,17
150,London at its finest.,We stayed at the Churchill for 3 nights as we began a European vacation with friends.  It is conveniently located and the staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  The hotel is beautifully maintained and was very clean.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning and ended each day in the Montagu bar.  The lobby has some interesting art on display which made for a unique decor.,5,2012,06,16
150,Disappointing in some ways,"I won a European break of my choice from work and as London fitted in with my plans to see some concerts, I booked The Churchill as I have passed it on the coach route out for many years. 

Parts of the service were excellent, particularly the check in process and the pleasant lounges with seats to relax by an open fire. 

The room was acceptable. Fairly comfortable but a bit spartan in furnishing. 

It was the breakfast that really let it down. We had searched to find a bed and breakfast deal, and if we had paid for breakfast the buffet would have been £27. 

The continental breakfast was excellent with a lot of choice and some bread to die for, but the cooked buffet was shocking. Very little choice - no beans or tomatoes and the scrambled egg looked disgusting so we ordered eggs to order on both days. The first day 2 fried eggs appeared which were overcooked and almost looked like and omelette. The poached eggs the next day were a bit better but still disappointing. 

We returned to our seat on the second day to see some folks with a plate full which looked much better than ours and noticed that some tables had menus on which we hadn't had on either day, believing that we could only have the buffet. The cooked to order breakfast did look a bit more appetising but at £4 per item it needed to be. A friend joined us for mid morning coffee which worked out at £16 for 3 of us. 

My advice is book room only and walk a couple of blocks for a better and cheaper breakfast at Wetherspoons - although they won't have the lovely bread. 

At over £500 for 2 nights on a discounted deal were were expecting better, and I don't think we will be back.",3,2012,06,16
150,"Great Location, Horrible Hotel","Stayed here twice. Horrible experience both times. The service is despicable, the walls are paper-thin: I can hear people's conversations in nearby rooms, music and tv channels. 

They constantly charged me things I didn't use or already paid for (breakfast as part of the room charge).  They charged me about 100 pounds worth of things from the minibar - I never even touched it. When I asked them to empty out the minibar they told me it was a 20 pound charge to empty it out! 

I couldn't open the curtains even because you can see into other people's rooms. Asked for help in getting a box to pack into it the things I bought, they told me they couldn't help and that I should just walk down Oxford road and ask around. People who randomly sit around in the lobby can get free internet, but you - who have paid quite a sum for a room - need to pay quite a bit. And unlike certain hotel where you can purchase internet for a week at a slightly better rate than a daily cost, here the price for a week is the same as paying for 7 days. 

All in all, both experiences were horrible. You'd expect a little luxury and perks from a 5-star hotel - especially with what the room costs are. The location of the hotel is great, but the hotel itself is very unsatisfactory.",1,2012,06,16
150,Really Good Quality,"We stayed at the Churchill for one night and had a bookiing for a club room. The welcome was perfect - as expected from a Hyatt hotel. Very professional and friendly staff. Excellent service. Good quality of food and drinks in the club lounge - but it's also worth to visit the Churchill-Bar.
The room (7th floor) was in a good condition, unfortunately with a very small bathroom.",4,2012,06,12
150,Nice Hotel - shame about the bun fight at Breakfast,"Stayed here for the weekend a couple of weekends ago.  This is a nice hotel in an excellent location for the West End.

Check in was quick, friendly and efficient and we were given a room on the 5th Floor of the hotel overlooking the street.

The room itself was clean, tidy and well equipped with everything that you could need for a weekend stay.  Good use of space with a very large bed, chairs and a desk that could double up as a table for room service.  Bathroom was a good size and whilst when we arrived there were no shampoos etc a quick call to housekeeping provided us with a large range of everything we could need.  Air conditioning was fine but it was nice to see a window that opened in a London hotel for a change.  However, on both nights after returning from dinner, our room key would not workk - once is acceptable but twice very annoying especially when its late and all you want to do is go to sleep.

Breakfast was a different matter all together with a rather disappointing range of cold and hot items.  No menu to go from just help yourself.  Not keen on this myself but.......  Also it was incredibly busy with people milling around every where - not only guests but many members of staff just standing around not really doing anything - if you have that many staff available at breakfast - no excuse not to do a menu breakfast for hot food as well as a cold buffet!  The tables are too close together and you are constantly being bumped into by guests and staff a like.  Consequently, we had breakfast out on the Sunday morning even though it was included.

In general a nice hotel and yes we will probably be back because of the location - but we will not be paying for breakfast this time and will find somewhere quieter and more organised - probably McDonalds!!",4,2012,06,11
150,"Comfortable Rooms, Close to everything","This is high class hotel (so expect to pay up) in a great location. It is walking distance from the Marble Arch square - close to all major shopping areas. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful; although beware of using the concierge to book tickets - There is a 5% convenience fee which is not disclosed upfront.
Overall, we were very impressed with the quality and location of the hotel.",4,2012,06,11
150,Very very good!!!,"Excellent in all of their aspects. I would stay again. Location, service, rooms, food, everything. Very close to Marble Arch station. ",5,2012,06,09
150,Awesome - we will be back!,"Spent 5 nights in this hotel back in November 2011. The hotel is well situated just 5 minutes from Marble Arch which is ideal for shopping and catching a tube around London. The room is big, quiet and lovely. I even make a friend with one of the Concierge guy, called Mr Dowes (apology if I misspelled the name, but he is very kind and softhearted gentleman from Ethiopia). Me and my wife also love the club sandwich from the restaurant downstairs. We will definitely come back.",5,2012,06,08
150,Big with the hustle and bustle one should expect,"Very comfortable and well looked after by conserve and staff. Breakfast good but remaining food from the restaurant middle of the road.
Localization excellent within walking distance of the best of London.
Churchill bar very good indeed.. Quality.",4,2012,06,07
150,Treated Like Royalty,"This was my 3rd visit to the hotel & on this occasion I was there for afternoon tea. From the moment we arrived & were greeted warmly & by name in the Montagu restaurant, I knew we were in for a treat. The staff were friendly, attentive & efficient but not over-bearing, we could not have wanted for anything. The menu choices were varied & tempting with great attention to detail & quality, tea & treats were replenished as if by magic & were plentiful & delicious. As this was a Jubilee weekend there was a themed tea although in the end we plumped for the 'Sex & the City' tea which we loved, there is also a vegetarian alternative which one of our party enjoyed. Overall we spent a very refined & relaxed afternoon being treated like royalty, it was a shame to leave but the service & atmosphere has ensured that we will be visiting again soon! I would recommend this hotel to any traveller for tea, a full meal or to stay, you won't be disappointed.",5,2012,06,07
150,Loved this hotel!,"My husband and I spent one night at the Hyatt Churchill this weekend, along with our one-year old. The stay completely surpassed my expectations. I wasn't expecting much. Given that this is London I was expecting a tiny room. Everything from the doorman to the gentleman who checked us in(I think his name was Macin) to our room was wonderful! The room was quite spacious. We had asked for a crib for our son and despite that the room was still a decent size. It was quiet, clean and the bed was super comfy! The lobby is really nice and although we didnt have breakfast at the hotel, it looked like it was quite popular.

We were on transit on our way back to New York so I am sad that we didnt end up staying longer. Will definitely stay here on our next trip to London!",5,2012,06,04
150,Great Location/Great Service,My wife and I celebrated her birthday at The Churchill Hyatt.  The staff provided outstanding service.  One staff member overheard me talking about my car and took the initiative on his own to offer me an alternative location to drop off the car.  This saved us an hour and a half.  The breakfast and snacks in the Regency Club were delicious.  The rooms were nice as well.  We enjoyed jumping on the underground and exploring our way through London--especially for the Queen's 60th Jubilee.,5,2012,06,04
150,"Amazing staff, great location","I had a wonderful stay at this picturesque hotel in one of the nicest parts of London. The staff were incredibly kind, helpful and accommodating. The buffet breakfast was DELICIOUS every day, and they even have a private park outside the hotel which is great for sunny days in London.",5,2012,06,03
150,"Grand Hotel, Super Location, Great Staff","This was our 3rd stay at this hotel and as always everything went smoothly. Stayed on the Regency Club Floor which had superb evening bites and wonderful breakfast all served at the Club Lounge.
Had emailed the Hotel and requested theater tickets which were waiting for us upon our arrival.
Will definitely stay there again.",4,2012,05,31
150,Starting to get dated,"This was my favorite hotel in the world, now it is no longer, I just spent 4 nights and found that the attention to detail that I loves was no longer there, from hosting a major cocktail party in the lobby making it hard for normal guests to get to the elevator, to the stains on the carpets in rooms and hallways.  Being a property manager myself, I tend to be critical on the details. But something has changed over the past year since my last visit.  This was my 3rd stay at this hotel and will be my last....",3,2012,05,31
150,What a staff... what a hotel... what a revelation!,"The ultimate hotel of this vacation! Attention to little details, staff that's really interested in serving you, and a comfortable room... what more can one ask for!

This is the top hotel I have stayed in all these years, and will surely be the one I stay in every time I'm in London. In fact, I keenly look forward to come back to London now!",5,2012,05,25
150,Excellent Excellent Excellent,I stayed at Hyatt in 2006 for a business visit. I was amazed at the service this hotel offered. One of the contemporary & best stays i have ever had. Havent had a better visit around the world in the last 6 years. Highle recommended,5,2012,05,22
150,Treats you like a small hotel,Even though this is a large hotel the staff treats you like a small hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to any one. ,4,2012,05,20
150,"Amazing hotel, amazing stay","After a terrible stay @ the westbury on Bond street, stayed @ the Hyatt Regency / Churchill for the rest of our stay in london , super place, amazing service! ",5,2012,05,20
150,Enjoyable,Truly an enjoyable stay. Warm and friendly staff . If u looking to exercise this is the wrong place as the fitness facilities are way below standard and unpleasant ,4,2012,05,19
150,Good hotel in very good location,"Stayed here for two nights in May. The room was well furnished and of a reasonable size for London. Both room and hotel in general had more of a luxury feel to them than the Hilton on Park Lane but it lacks much of the wow factor you find in many 5* luxury hotels in London.

Service was good but the reception proved to be very busy both on check-in and checkout. My rate did not include breakfast, so I did not take it. 

The location at Portman Square is very pleasant with banks nearby. Oxford Street and Selfridges are about a two minute walk. Marble Arch tube station is about five minutes away. Overall the location is very good and a major selling point for the hotel.",4,2012,05,18
150,Very comfortable but for this price expect better service and faster lifts,"The welcome at the front desk was very pleasant and the check in very helpful, even if the offer of a king bed couldn't be satisfied because on reflection, they'd all been booked up. The room was very comfortable with all the necessaries of a hotel room for a business traveller, and maintained to a high standard of cleanliness. 
Service in the restaurant at breakfast was rubbish. Slow, disorganised and not very welcoming. For a 5 star hotel in the centre of London, guests deserve much better especially at this price. The elevators were also ridiculously slow waiting long periods between floors. This must be a nightmare at busy times.
I'm not sure I'd stay here if I was paying. I would avoid the poor breakfast service by eating out for much less.",3,2012,05,17
150,In West End theater district near easy transportation,"Nice, but pricey, five-star two blocks north of Oxford Street. 
Less than 10-minute (4 short blocks) walk to Marble Arch Station tube, just northeast of Hyde Park. Bus stop about 100 feet from hotel. Not in the tourist district, but bus can get you there in less than 10 minutes. Take the bus rather than the tube so you can see London. 
If you do take the tube from Marble Arch, you have to switch trains once.  If you take the tube to Green Park, Buckingham Palace is a short walk across the park. 
On Oxford Street, around the corner from hotel on way to Marble Arch is a KFC and a great sandwich chain Pert A Manage",5,2012,05,14
150,One night but a good one.,"Was in London for one final night so decided to stay at the Churchill as I like Hyatts as I mentioned in a previous review I do enjoy hyatts but if I were staying longer I'd head back to the Soho.

But having said that the Hyatt was very good.  Large(ish) comfy room and bed, the usual hyatt over the top helpful staff and a nice little bar, though a bit business/corporate for me.

Met up with an old friend for dinner so we had a cocktail at the bar before heading out for the night and the Hyatt was very nice to come back to after a night of shenanigans.

Very good water pressure and the car service the next day to the hotel was prompt as usual.  there was a minor problem as we blew a tire on the freeway and then the driver was having problems removing the lug nuts from the tire.  He called for back up and within ten minutes another car was there and took me to the airport.  I tipped the first driver for being a sport and almost had to argue with him to take the money.

Again very nice and usual hyatt standard but if staying for a week or more choose a hotel like the Soho which is in the thick of it all and an excellent hotel, but if you you're only in town for a day or two this place is great.",4,2012,05,08
150,Bend over backwards to serve you at The Churchill,"I was on business with my company and chose to stay at The Churchill.  My first experience with the extremes The Churchill staff will go to make your stay what you want and need was with Nick at the Concierge desk.  With my suitcase next to me as I just walked through the door on arrival, I asked about a tour to Stonehenge stating - ""I only have this afternoon available to go.""  Nick's response was:  ""What is your name.  Give me your bag.  I'll take care of it and I'll call the tour people while you are getting there.  Take this paper.  Get straight in a taxi.  Go to this address.  You just have time to get to the tour bus.""  He ran straight out and got a taxi for me.  Because of his quick thinking and work, I arrived minutes before the bus was leaving as the last tour of the day.  They already had my information in hand and I had an extraordinary tour of Stonehenge.  My second experience:  I thought my bed was too firm for the bed I am used to sleeping in and mentioned it to the front desk.  The housekeeping staff came and changed the entire mattress set to a softer one for me!!!   The hotel is sparkling clean.  The entire staff bends over backwards to help you and treats you like whatever you want is their total wish to grant.  I ate breakfast only in the restaurant -- it was good and I was able to order exactly what I wanted.  Efficient staff -- extremely well informed Concierge desk (Nick is outstanding!) - helpful front desk crew - and very friendly restaurant staff- and a gracious hotel manager.  The art in the lobby is a plus.  Lovely hotel.  Great location.  I talked to a woman - a hotel guest from Egypt.  She comes to London alone 4 times a year to shop and go to the theatre.  She always stays at The Churchill because it is so clean and the staff is so helpful and she feels very safe.  I agree with her.  On any trip to London, The Churchill is the ideal hotel in which to stay.",5,2012,05,02
150,Mostly a biz hotel,"This is mostly a corporate hotel.  A good location, easy taxi service, and decent facilities(breakfast room, Oak-paneled bar, small workout gym).  
Service was efficient and friendly enough.  
My biggest negative was the noise in room.  I had a sixth-floor room, and I was constantly hearing my neighbors and the maid service in the halls.  I do not think I am easily irritated by noise pollution, so this stood out for me.  As an example, I could readily hear a neighbor snooring, and another neighbor flipping channels on the tv, while I was trying to sleep.
For biz travel, if you can find a room with thicker walls, I would rate the hotel higher.  For all else, I think there are better options.",3,2012,05,01
150,Not very good hotel,"its 5 star hotel but its not a treated customers as 5 stars/ VIP customers, my experience this time was not good i have booked club room which its cost me double than normal and expecting a very special treatment and good rooms , but unfortunately check in disk on 8th floor was tough and they are not good as main check in disk on ground they are not Professional to treated with a club customers, rooms was same as the normal rooms i have stayed at 7th floor on park view it is bit small room if we compare with money we paid, hose keeping and cleaning was very bad at that floor some time i called to re clean the rooms , since we booked club rooms so they offer us to join the lounge for breakfast and use it any time in a day tell 10 pm with free drinks and snakes, it was bad breakfast comparing with the one in the ground floor which is perfect and have a very good, helpful staff except 28/4/2012 shift which they was very bad managing the busy day and they really turbid our mood when they keep us waiting fore more than half an hour wile there is tables and they excuse it is for 4 persons not 2 !!! it was really bad for 5 stars hotel to behave like this with there gusts and supervisor was very rude when he answer and he didn't help at all.",4,2012,04,30
150,Outstanding,"This stay surpassed our expectations since our previous stay. We were given an executive suite  on the 8th floor with lounge access, both the room and the lounge have been renovated flawlessly with amenities galore and service to die for.",5,2012,04,27
150,Great place to stay,"Upscale neighbourhood. Smooth check-in at 08:30a. Quiet,spacious room on the 5th floor. Decent-size bathroom and closet space. Small gym, but state-of-the-art cardiovascular machines. Very good breakfast, with a very attentive service. Not easy to spot anything outstanding overall, but flawless overall ... precisely what a business traveller is looking for. Excellent value for money.",5,2012,04,24
150,Old Standby,"Have stayed in this hotel many times over the years. Always well kept, clean, very comfortable and especially luxuruious for Hyatt Passport memebers. The Lounge on the 8th floor is great and there new revised gym is more then adequate. The staff is great and very helpful. Rooms are nice with most having a view of Portman square. Location is outstanding ...steps from Oxford st and marble arch.",5,2012,04,23
150,First class,"From check in to check out, everyting about the Churchill Hotel is first class. The service, attention to detail, bar service, lounge, room size and amenities. No, this hotel is not cheap, but they really deliver value for money and provide a home away from home.",5,2012,04,23
150,Good but not great,"Hotel location near Oxford street, depends what you looking for to shop or see.  Quite a distance from Thames and Piccadilly, however taxis not too deer.  Rooms standard type what you would expect from Hyatt, views of internal bland courtyard, breakfast nothing exciting.",3,2012,04,19
150,The only place we will ever stay in London,"From the greeting at check-in to the help at check-out, our stay at The Churchill exceeded all expectations. Perfect location, beautiful rooms, superb service. If you can do so, a stay on the concierge floor will be worth the cost. The concieges, all wonderful assets, greet you by name when you get off the elevator at the eighth floor. A luxurious breakfast, unlimited snacks and beverages throughout the day, and a three hour ""happy hour"" with complimentary food, wine and cocktails will tempt you to stay in the hotel and not tend to business or go exploring. Resist the temptation for you will be in a perfect location. Oh, and I should add that the Churchill is family friendly as well. ",5,2012,04,19
150,Nice accomodations; okay service,"The Churchill is a clean, lovely hotel.  But the service was less than desirable, especially at this price point. The room was noisy; the a/c did not work well (even for Europe); and the concierge was not knowledgeable or helpful.  Wi-fi was very pricey, and in my opinion should have been included in the prices of the already over-priced room.",3,2012,04,16
150,Not quite 5 star service,"My husband was on a business trip and asked me to come along. It wasn't the first choice, we stayed for 3 days before moving out to Marriott Park Lane.
Location - the hotel is on the quieter side of the very busy Oxford St. Excellent in terms of convenience.
Room - Clean, modern, functional and satisfactory.
Food - I only had the breakfast buffet, which had a nice spread.
Service - This is where it truly fell short. While the service at the lobby area is alright (concierge, restaurant, doormen) it was the laundry service that disappointed, often taking their time to come. But it was this incident that had me upset:
I called requesting for the laundry form as it wasn't replenished during room service and to pick up. I waited for an hour before complaining and finally they came but with no form. Not to worry, they had some fancy digital device to record it. Minutes later another person came to pick up my laundry, this time with form in hand.
This was still fine until I found out the next day that they had sent my laundry to the wrong room. Luckily it was a friend's room, and they identified that the clothes belonged to us, but not after getting into a argument with laundry service. They were rude to our friends and insistent that it was their laundry, to the extent of saying ""there's cctv footage of it"". 
Other than this glitch, everything else about the hotel was fine but it certainly spoiled the experience.",4,2012,04,07
150,Excellent in many ways but terribly noisy,Stayed here for 10 weeks for work. Location is excellent for hitting the shops and restaurants. Small bathrooms and very thin walls. Woken up by slamming doors every morning. Service is excellent.,4,2012,03,30
150,One of my favourite,"I stayed there many times..but coming back after a couple of years i have to admit for london this is one of my favourite. The rooms are very clean, the beds in hyatt are the best, the bathrooms are clean, functional.. Locanda locatelli ( one of the best italian rest in lon) is in the house, you have a lot of taxi in front of the hotel and oxfordstreet is just around the corner. The guys at the concierge were at anytime very gentle and helpful. Thank you! i ll be back soon!",5,2012,03,29
150,LONDON!,"I stayed here for four nights in December, on my second trip to London. I was thoroughly impressed. Every thing about this hotel was lovely, from the service to the rooms. Everyone was very welcoming and happy to help you wherever possible. High tea in the restaurant is a must, as is staying in a club room - you get access to complementary breakfast, and evening drinks and canapés. Try the blueberry and hibiscus tea as well. 

As for location, could not get any better! Literally a minute away was Oxford and Regent street, and the very centre of London.
Do not go past this hotel! I truly had a wonderful time staying here.",5,2012,03,25
150,great service at top location,"If you are a shopoholic and have heavy bags to carry, this will be yr home base-
just steps off Oxfordstreet and Selfridges this hotel allows easy access to shopping mecca 
and taxis and tube-connections are plenty.",4,2012,03,18
150,A great stay,"I have chosen this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and it didn't disappoint. I have checked many other 5* hotels, but most of them had really bad rooms and run down furniture. Not this one. Location is very good, just off the Oxford Street and close to two metro stations.
We had to wait a few minutes for checking in, it was a really busy New Year period. The girl who checked us in (can't remember the name, but she is Swedish, the hotel should really be proud of her) was wonderful, very kind and helpful every time!
Room was nice and clean, except for the glasses which still had the drinks from the previous guest and didn't get removed during our stay.
Breakfast was good.
So this is a very good choice for London which has so many bad hotels on ridiculous prices.",5,2012,03,17
150,Extremely comfortable and quiet (Diamond Member),"I last stayed here about four years ago - I was very pleasantly surprised by the upgrades to the rooms and the club lounge. They have added extra sound-proofing to the windows that is very effective at keeping out central London noise.  The beds are heavenly.

One thing kept me from giving this 5 stars.  The club lounge stops serving cocktails and snacks at 7.30 pm in the evening.  This is too early. I don't get out of work until then - there's no time to relax and unwind.  I normally stay at the Hilton Park Lane - they keep the food and drink out until 9.00 pm",4,2012,03,14
150,Excellent stay!,"My husband and I plus both of our parents were fortunate enough to be staying here for a special occasion in November. When we arrived we couldn't have been better looked after, all staff were friendly and helpful, they made us feel welcome and made our stay memorable. The Regency Club is well worth a visit - for the canapes/cocktails and the peace and quiet alone. Breakfast in there is a treat, it has a quiet and relaxed atmosphere and wonderful to enjoy our breakfast in such surroundings. We enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, we will definitely be back. Thank you to all the staff!",5,2012,03,12
150,Excellent Rooms and Great Locations,"I just spent 4 days at the Churchill.  I haven't been there in 10 years.  The refurbishment has made it a splendid place to stay.  The furnishings are elegant in an understated way.  The service is superior, and the location is central.  The lobby of the hotel is spacious and serene in the morning and the evening and the Churchill bar is one of the most charming hotel bars in London.",5,2012,03,08
150,short London visit- theatre break,"lovely stay in very nice hotel. Not much to look at from outside, but nice inside, plus very good location just off Oxford street, so very good for shopping. All staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was real treat-all fresh prepared and lots if! I would definitely stay again. Only slight criticism-
could hear other guests through bedroom walls.",4,2012,02,27
150,Terrific London hotel,"The Hyatt Regency - the Churchill is a luxury business hotel located in the West End in Central London. Tucked away in Portman Square, it is near the Marble Arch and two minutes walking distance from Oxford Street, so remarkably close to all the shopping and entertainment. 
I arrived at 9am in the morning after a long overnight flight, and not only did the hotel accede to my request for an early checkin but upgraded me to a room on the executive floor. Check-in staff was prompt, courteous and supremeley efficient. While rooms are small (and this isnt unusual for a city as expensive as London), they are comfortable and well-equipped. I also had complimentary breakfast thrown in, and evening cocktails/canapes at the business lounge on the floor.  Check-out was also very quick at the executive floor reception itself, so no queuing up in the main lobby to settle bills. 
About the only thing I could fault, is them forgetting to deliver The Times paper to me in the monrning, after specifically asking for my preference.  Overall, a very good experience and I would certainly stay here on my next trip",4,2012,02,27
150,Fabulous!,"I stayed with a party of 6 for one night and we were looked after fantastically well by attentive, professional, staff.  The rooms were great, the breakfast outstanding and, knowing our stay was for a celebration, the hotel delivered a number of complementary gifts.  All in all, they contributed in large part to it being a day to remember.  Thankyou!",5,2012,02,26
150,A HOTEL FIT FOR A PRESIDENT,"Simply put, words are unable to provide for the most outstanding excellent superb hotel in every respect, it is immaculate, every employee is outstanding, hotel room a dream beyond imagination, food michelin standard,words cannot describe this amazing hotel, management, staff and doormen. The Queen of England would adore it.",5,2012,02,26
150,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"When you arrive at the Hyatt Churchill you won't think much of it from the outside.  In fact it looks like some kind of old government building as we drive up.   But you won't be disappointed as you head inside.
I can't fault the service at the Hyatt Churchill.   Everyone was so friendly and eager to help us during our stay.   We stayed for 5 nights early in January.   My mate booked us 2 rooms and paid for them.   He won't tell me how much they were so I'm assuming this place is expensive.   We made sure we got 2 rooms overlooking Portman Square.   This is the best aspect of the building as the square is quiet, gives a nice view, and good light in to the rooms.   I could sit by those windows for long time looking out over the park and tennis courts.
The rooms themselves are a little on the smaller side.   It was funny finding places to put all my clothes and luggage.   But I managed to fit it all in to the wardrobe and drawers.
I actually quite liked the cosy-ness and comfort level of the rooms.  Room cleaning was done to a high standard each day with a turn day service each evening.   Free bottles of water (and fruit I think) was provided each day, as well as free newspapers.
I found the breakfast in the restaurant downstairs to be quite expensive.   So instead I asked for a muffin to take back to my room, and the girl returned with a big box of assorted pastries for 8 pounds.   That was  enough for both of us for breakfast.   The sit down breakfast was very expensive and the choices on the buffet very limited.   We only sat down once.
The bathroom in the room is a little on the small size but still quite functional.   I have no complaints about the room at all.
The gym in the hotel is not great.   Small room, limited equipment.   I only used the gym once.   The equipment was a bit dated, and some of it was in need of maintenance.   I heard that there are other gyms around the Marble Arch area.
The second great thing about the Hyatt Churchill is the location.   You are just one block back from Oxford Street where all the big stores  (Selfridges, Primark, Denhams etc) are located.  SO you can shop and bring your bags back to the room during the day and head again.   The hotel is also located just a few minutes walk to either Marble Arch or Bond St tube stations.   But you don't have to go far from this hotel at all to experience some of the best hang outs in London.   We were even walking across to SoHo from here.
If I can afford the rates at the Hyatt Churchill I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.   The hotel is really lovely.
NOTE:   The WiFi rate for one week is 119 pounds.   I think it was around 20-25 pounds per day.   We received it for free because my mate has some high status level with the Hyatt chain.",5,2012,02,25
150,Absolutely loved our stay!,"I booked this hotel to propose to my now fiancée! The staff were so friendly and helpful. We was given a complimentary upgrade in our room and stayed in a recently re-decorated suite. It was so lovely, my then girlfriend couldn't believe I'd booked it. We were also given a complimentary bowel of fruit, champagne and card from the manager because I explained I was going to propose when I booked it. I was so happy and really couldnt thank the management and staff enough for a perfect stay!! Would recommend to anyone! Like the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" and the regency Hyatt was worth every penny.",5,2012,02,24
150,"Very Nice Hotel, but a Few Disappointments","I stayed in this hotel twice within a week, on business, and although there is no doubt it is a well-located and lovely building with very clean, elegant and comfortable rooms there was the odd thing that took the shine off.  For instance, the bathroom was a bit small and the shower/bath tap system takes some working out!  First time I was given complimentary drinking water, fruit and a half-bottle of wine in the room, second time I wasn't (and when I asked why I was told if it is in there it is complementary, but if it isn't, it isn't!).  Both times the the receptionist seemed to really struggle with finding and actioning my reservation and flatly denied that several of my co-travellers who had arrived the day before were checked-in at the hotel - even when they walked out of the lifts and confirmed that they were indeed booked in! There was obviously some large corporate event or conference in progress which obviously took priority over 'ordinary' guests as well.  On the other hand the staff were resolutely friendly and cheerful and the rooms really are very nice.  I'm not in the loyalty scheme, and won't be joining it, and although the terms of my booking gave me access to the Executive Lounge I had to ask about it and in the end didn't use it.  Bottom line: a very nice hotel in a good part of London, but a few little niggles left me feeling less than valued as a customer.",4,2012,02,24
150,Very Good - If You Like That Sort of Thing,"There were plenty of guests when I was there, particularly Africans and Russians, so a very international vibe. Yet I found it a little difficult to relax here, for some reason. The bar was a little intimidating at first, but I settled down after a few glasses.
I was too late for lunch at Texture, the nearby restaurant of interest (locanda locatelli did not interest me at all), but I had an excellent lunch at the hotel's own Montagu restaurant.
My room was on the second floor with a pleasant view of the park. In spite of it being at the front of the hotel, there was no traffic or street noise. The room was quite large by London standards.
I do think this hotel is overpriced, in spite of its central location, excellent staff etc. Personally I prefer The Andaz.",3,2012,02,24
150,"Nice Hotel, Great Location...just Inconsistent Service","I have to admit that I go back and forth in rating this hotel.  No question that it is a nice hotel in a fantastic location in the city.  The rooms, while small, are nice and well appointed.  The bathrooms are very small, especially the tub and shower - however, I would rather have the space in the bedroom if I had to choose.

As a long term guest, you get to see the good and the bad.  The service, given the image and the price of the accommodations needs some improvement.  Some of the staff are fantastic - very helpful and always looking to make your stay more enjoyable.  There are some people on the club level who are really great employees.  Some days though...service is inconsistent and disappointing.  Tonight, I ordered room service and not only did it take longer than promised but the order was wrong.  What to do - eat what you get or call and wait another hour for it to be corrected?  Housekeeping is sometimes off as well with details but overall the rooms are very clean and comfortable.

Also, if you collect Hyatt points, be very careful that you get the points you should acquire. 

I also want to comment that this hotel seems to have some of the rudest and most inconsiderate guests that I have ever encountered.  Guest who treat the staff and the hotel so poorly...I am embarrassed for them.  The other evening I left my room and some guest down the hall had just thrown all their shopping bags and boxes out into the hallway...unbelievable behavior.",3,2012,02,22
150,Excellent hotel,"We were lucky enough to stay in one of the renovated suites on the 9th floor.
Balcony faced the square and was high enough that street noise was not a problem.
The first to 6th floors wont be renovated until after the olympics so i cant comment on those. access to the club was great as we could have breakfast including eggs made to order. natalie was excellent and very helpful in suggestions, reservations, and advice during our stay. very friendly and helpful staff. good location within walking distance to marble arch tube stop. would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,02,21
150,Fabulous Hotel,"I led a group of five folks and needed a place to us to stay while in London on route to South Africa. This hotel is fabulous. The hotel accommodated our early arrival and we able to shower and freshen up before we headed out to Harrods for breakfast and were off to see the sights. It is located a stones throw from Marble Arch and Hyde Park which is very convenient. The tube (Subway) is short walk and the buses run from within blocks. The staff are very courteous, professional and will go the extra mile to welcome you and make you feel at home. They gave us great advice on places to visit and see and directed us to some fabulous nearby authentic English pubs. The rooms are very spacious which I was surprised to find in London having been used to New York. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are extremely clean and tastefully decorated. Its a definite stay for me when I visit again and one that will also highly  recommend to my friends and business associates as they travel to London.",5,2012,02,21
150,Very Nice Hotel,We spent 4 nights in February at the Hyatt Churchill in a 9th floor suite. The room faced Portman Square and had doors from both the sitting room and bedroom onto the balcony. There was very little street noise to be heard on this floor at night. The room was spacious with a nice but small shower and separate bath. The bed was comfortable but just a little bit more firm than the best pillow top mattresses. The staff was very accomodating and helpful. The buffet breakfast in the Regency Club was good and included fresh eggs cooked to order. Hyatt Platinum members recieve free internet Signing up for the Chase Hyatt credit card gave us 2 free nights and the Platinum level.,5,2012,02,21
150,An unsung gem,"I booked a room here at the last minute with no expectations other than a decent bed for one night.  I was delighted to find a sparkling, well renovated property with a friendly, professional staff.  I was upgraded at checkin to a room on the club level; a nice surprise after an overnight flight.  Access to club lounge was a very nice extra, and breakfast in the lounge the next morning was very good. Room was large and nicely designed; soft goods felt fresh. While The Churchill was not on my radar before, it is now, and I have recommended it to friends and collageaues traveling to London.  Great location, great staff. I hope to return soon.",5,2012,02,20
150,Illegal procedure,"Staff is excellent;
Hotel has a procedure that I suspect is even illegal; at check-in and without notice they “seize” GBP 300, in my case, from the customers’ credit card, to cover incidental charges;
Located just a two minute walk from Oxford Street;
Terrible extremely soft beds;
Excellent breakfast;
Nor even wireless Internet is free.",3,2012,02,17
150,Great Weekend,"booked hotel for my partners birthday, we were given a larger room by the receptionist, the room was excellent very clean, and the bed was very comfortable.on the last night of our stay a bottle of champage & birthday cake was put in our room which was a very nice touch, service and location are first class would book again",5,2012,02,14
150,Great Location and Amazing Staff!,"Fantastic location, close to Oxford St. Staff were friendly and always willing to help, making our stay very enjoyable. Would recommend.",5,2012,02,14
150,Excellent location and customer experience!,"Excellent location, great neighborhood! Walking distance from Oxford Street and Baker Street.  Classy lobby, superb desk service, Spacious rooms and amazing hospitality!  I stayed for more than 2 weeks, my best stay in London till date.  Highly recommended!",5,2012,02,10
150,West End Jewel,"This extremely elegant hotel is conveniently located on Portman Square, just a few short blocks off Oxford Street and the Marble Arch Underground Station on the Central Line, or about a ₤6 taxi ride away from Paddington Station.

There are certainly less expensive hotels in the West End of Central London than this, but the Churchill exudes charm and class and offers first class service in every way.  On my last visit upon arrival I was informed there were no rooms available with a king size bed as per my reservation.  However, within a matter of minutes the twin beds in the room had been moved together with a king size mattress placed on top, so you can't ask for more than that.

The rooms are a decent size and have been kept very current without losing any of the elegant feel.  I highly recommend The Churchill in every way.",5,2012,02,07
150,"Excellent service, comfortable rooms","I stayed here with my husband while we were both in London on business in February 2012.  I should admit that I don't enjoy hotels and much prefer to stay in apartments where I can come and go as I please, have more space, cook my own meals and have greater independence.  And normally have free wi-fi (the Hyatt charges 7GBP per hour or about 120GBP per week which is outrageous on top of what we're paying for the room).

So I approached the Churchill with some reservations.  I needed a place to be able to work within the room, that was close to good public transport, close to central archives and libraries, and with a comfortable bed.  

First, I have mixed feelings about the location of the Churchill.  If you want a central business/Oxford St location then this might work for you.  The hotel is located in Portman Square, a block from Marble Arch.  That makes transport connections easy by both bus and tube.  It's also close to Paddington, for access to Heathrow, and within 15 minutes (bus or taxi) to St James, Knightsbridge, Notting Hill and Oxford Circus.  If you're after shopping then this is at the quiet end of Oxford St and it's about a 20 minute walk to Oxford Circus, and another 20 minute walk down Regent Street.  If you're after character then I don't think Marylebone is great.  I'm happier in precincts like Bayswater and Notting Hill, but you don't find big hotels there.

Secondly, I have mixed feelings about the rooms.  The beds are very large (super king?) and the pillows are deep and fluffy.  The decor is neutral.  The bathroom is clean and modern but drives me nuts with its layout.  Too many doors open (and close) onto each other and it begins to feel dangerous.  Definitely inconvenient.  The desk is well equipped for business travellers - there's a reasonably sized work table with international wall plugs for electrical devices (UK, US and Europe - not Australian).  I don't get much creative vibe but it won't offend anyone.  The lights are not well designed - you can't have just a bedside light on at night to read without having major ceiling lights on in the entry.  Or perhaps that's just my room.

Thirdly, the service is excellent and deserves a major mention.  This is the reason I would come back to the Churchill if I did.  The housekeeping staff keep an eye on the room (sheets and towels) at least twice a day.  We see them often in the corridors and they are absolutely gorgeously friendly but scrupulously professional.  Door staff, room service and counter staff are equally as lovely.  Extremely consistent across the hotel in the quality of service.  The food in the restaurant is nice; the room service food has always been delicious and beautifully presented.

Business centre facilities, as you'd expect, are standard and over priced.

The hotel seems to lack lounge or bar facilities.  It combines a restaurant and casual drinks/meals area in one space, which means there is no obvious place to crash with a laptop and coffee that isn't actually the restaurant itself.  But there is a live pianist/vocalist most nights which everyone seems to appreciate.

If you're looking for entertainment, I found a cinema around the corner (Baker St) called 'Everyman' which is an independent chain that's well worth a try.  It has two underground screens in small theaters.  Each contains about 10 short rows of plush velvet chairs.  The bar sells home made snacks like roasted nuts and hommus, wines and coffees, all of which can be taken into the cinema and set down on the small side tables positioned on the arm rests.  Adult ticket prices around 12GBP.

All in all the Churchill is a decent hotel if this is the kind of venue you need.",4,2012,02,02
150,Perfectly Proper London Hotel,We stayed at the Churchill when we were in London for a wedding.  We found the staff very helpful in helping us plan our free time.  The restaurant off the lobby was a great place to recoup before and after a hectic day.  The location was perfect - not far from the underground and the shopping.  I would definitely stay there again when returning to London.,4,2012,01,28
150,First trip to London in over 10 years,"Hubby and I spent one night at the Churchill. We arrived in London at 11am and walked to the hotel to drop off our overnight bag. We were warmly welcomed and informed that they had a room ready for us. Check in was quick and efficient and there was an offer to be shown to our room but we declined as we only had a small bag. 
The room was at the back of the hotel with not a lot to look at but for one night we didn't really care. The room was smaller than I was expecting and the carpet and easy chair could really do with updating as both were showing some wear. 
Bathroom is what you'd expect in a hotel - clean and plenty of white towels. 
We were booked on a half board basis and went to dinner at 7.30pm - no reservations were required as the hotel was quiet. 
On arrival at the restaurant we were shown to a table and given the a la carte and set menus. We were eagerly looking at the set menu as this is the one reception told us we would be having as half board option. 
We chatted to our friends who had already arrived and they told us that there was a third menu specifically for half board. We were a little disappointed as this menu had much less options on it. But what the heck the stay was for free (our friend won a competition!). 
The food was excellent, well presented and flavoursome. 
Bedtime: the bed is very comfy and has a very warm duvet on it. We found the duvet too warm and found we were kicking it off and pulling it back on most of the night. Not the hotel's fault as they have to cater to the majority..
Breakfast: Plenty of variety - cold meats, pastries, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juices as well as the traditional full english. One thing they need to change here is the table at the top of the aisles at the back by the kitchen area, the waiters and guests have to get past you to reach the kitchen and bump into you all the time. If we had stayed another night there is no way I would sit there again. 
Check out was quick and easy. 
All in all it is a good base for the Oxford Street area and I would stay again.",4,2012,01,28
150,Service at its best and a great location,"Being a Hyatt Diamond, we reserved a suite on points in the Hyatt Churchill, a great property with friendly staff. When we checked in with our baby, we saw that we received the smallest suite I ever saw and wanted to leave to our other usual Hotel in London. I also made a call to another Hyatt, where I knew the MD and rapidly all was solved and we received for free the Presidential Suite which for London properties is rather nice and large.The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was a room in it self. Big and pleasant and a wonderful rain shower.From then on the service level was fantastic. The Executive Lounge was just so pleasant with the many nationalities there and the atmosphere was so relaxing at this property, that we exteded one day. Being less than 1 minute away from Oxford street, I would say that the cleanliness of the room, the great breakfast and the fantastic staff really make up for the price you would pay there. Definitely my Hotel for the future in London shall I keep my Diamond status.",5,2012,01,26
150,Friendly Sophistication,"Stayed at the Churchill while in London before and after a business meeting, and this hotel had the right balance of friendly, helpful service while in a sophisticated setting (they have begun a three-year program of displaying art from the private collection of Charles Saatchi in the lobby).
The staff and management of the hotel showed a genuine interest not only in efficiency but in being gracious and welcoming.  The Assistant Manager, Dirk Pohlers, could not have been more helpful --- he pulled me off the back of a short line at reception to check me in at the manager's desk, got me a bottle of water which was much appreciated after the long flight from Chicago, asked if I needed restaurant reservations, etc.  When I thanked him for being so kind, he smiled and said ""We want you to come back and stay with us!""
The hotel is in a great location--close to Oxford Street shopping and tube stops--and across from Portman Square.  There's a proper driveway in front, which they keep well organized so taxis can get in/out without having you stuck in a long line.  The rooms are clean and modern, and the bathrooms are modern and very functional as well.  My only gripe is that they charge 17 GBP/day for internet access, which is excessive and unnecessary, but all in all, a very nice property that is very well run.",4,2012,01,25
150,Hyatt Regency London,"After spending five nights at a hotel of a lesser quality, we had a reservation here, and this hotel turned out to be fantastic.  We had a regency suite with one king bed and a rollaway for our son.  The rollaway was very comfortable, and only 50 GBP for the entire stay.  The suite was lovely, having been recently renovated.  The living room was adequately sized, with ample seating, the complimentary fruit and candies were nice to have.  The bedroom was nicely sized,  but only really a bed, dresser, nightstands, and a TV.  The bathroom was large and beautiful, with great Molton Brown toiletries and a separate tub and shower, but the mirror directly in front of the toilet was... interesting.  The balcony had nice views, but furniture was sparse.  The only other issue with the suite itself was that the door to the bedroom had slats in it and let light/sound through.  The service, from all employees, was phenomenal.  The lounge staff were great, with the food being excellent quality.  The lounge proved to be of great value, but it would be nice if there were more snack options throughout the day.  The breakfast was delicious, though, and evening canapés were good, too.  The alcohol provided was of high quality, which is nice to see in a hotel lounge like this.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you are willing to splurge on a suite.  (All suites have lounge access, I believe)  The location of the hotel was very nice, in a quiet section of Marylebone, near Oxford Street and the Tube station.  All in all, it was a great hotel.",5,2012,01,24
150,Not Up to Scratch,"I decided to book a night at the Churchill since I had reservations at my favourite restaurant in London, Locanda Locatelli which is joined to the hotel. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, virtually every interaction with the hotel staff was negative. Person at reception chatting to other staff instead of getting me checked in. ""Would you like one or two keycards?"" ""Two please"". I received one. ""Which newspaper would you like, complimentary as a Gold Hyatt member?"" Didn't matter as I didn't receive any. On the morning of check out I was disturbed twice by the maid. Don't they communicate with reception to make sure the guest has checked out before servicing the room? The king room itself was fairly average for a 5 star hotel. Certainly not up to the standard of the Park Hyatts in Milan and Paris I've stayed at; both are quite a bit more expensive I know. I've stayed at many London hotels at various price ranges and this was the most disappointing. In this price range I would recommend the Sofitel as my top choice in London.",2,2012,01,23
150,Great traditional hotel in great location,"Stayed here for a conference with work recently and I have to say it delivered in most areas. I would recommend it for most, weekend trip with family / spouse and for work related activites. 

Its situated on portman Sqauare which is just around the corner from oxford street and within 3 mins walk from Selfridges. So, from a shopping perspective its a great base. For business its easy access to/from Paddington and taxis are easily available around the hotel. 

Its a traditional looking hotel, with a great open space lobby, very nice restaurant with superb food and an excellent bar with big leather chairs, great selection of drinks and very good service. 

Corporate hospitality and service for conference or meetings was very good and everything ran smooth.

Rooms are big, nicely decorated with modern facilities. Slept very well in the big king sized bed and bathroom was quite big for London.

Good gym and parks nearby for exercise.

Very good service generally and nothing to complain about. 

Overall, very good and would def recommend it.",4,2012,01,23
150,It deserves to be much higher !,"Lovely warm and welcoming ambience in this hotel - its so comfortable! Rooms are spotlessly clean and beds offer a wonderful nights rest. Staff smile and welcome you wherever you go and everything was efficiently handled when my sister and I visited for a weekend stay. Our room had no view to speak of but was quiet and easily accessible.
Breakfast was varied and freshly cooked and service excellent. 
We walked from Paddington station (about 20mts) past small gardens and lovely little boutique shops and cafes. If all you know is Oxford street it would pay you to explore the streets to the north as they offer more characterful shopping.",5,2012,01,23
150,Some parts I really liked and others not so great,"I liked the fact that many of the staff were so friendly and attentive to me and my baby's needs - they couldn't do enough.  However, at least two staff were outright rude and full of self-importance when it came to making requests for my daughter - their response was abrupt and unapologetic, as if the child shouldn't have even been in the hotel.

I would have liked to have given this hotel a 4 out of five, but the way I was treated has left a slight bad taste in my mouth with regard to customer service in the restaurant area (they were two male staff). -  and the staff at reception, breakfast service and at the door a just so friendly and warm. 

The location is fantastic for shopping and the bedrooms clean and bright.  The gym is sufficient and clean also.",3,2012,01,23
150,A Very Special Hotel :),"Myself and my wife just returned from a night away in London. (LAST NIGHT 21/10/2012)
We could never afford a Luxury hotel like this but had won the nights stay in a competition.
We walked up to the grand entrance and were greeted by a friendly and really nice Doorman who treated us with a smile and asked if we needed help with our bags,The reception area is stunning with its beautiful lighting and paintings on the wall. The room was beautiful and my wife said the MASSIVE bed was the most comfortable she has ever slept in.The room was spotless and the dressing gown and smellies and apples were a lovely little surprise.
The restaurant is out of the world!!!!The waiters and waitresses are really nice and friendly and will do anything to make your dinning experience better and the Food was divine with the best pudding ive EVER tasted. And as for breakfast , you need 2 hours to eat it There are LOADS of different foods to from cereals to fresh fruits juices ,breads cold meats and a lovely full English fry up.

Overall this hotel was the best stay in London i have ever had and if i could ever ever afford to go back i would do in a heart beat.

150,"Elegant, sophisticated hotel with superb location! A+","We stayed at The Churchill for 1 night over the Christmas holidays en-route to Somerset. 

Our usual hotel of choice when overnighting in London is the Strand Palace but we chose the convenience of The Churchill for its location near to Paddington station, open shops on Boxing day and to use our Hyatt points.  The location of the hotel in Portman square was perfect – a 5-minute walk to Oxford street shopping but without the noise & traffic.

When it comes to Hyatt's nicer properties, this one defeinitely tops the list! 

The lobby was beautiful and it was decorated very tastefully and elegantly for the holidays. 
The front desk staff were very gracious. They were very helpful when we told them we had just gotten off a long international flight and they allowed us to check in early. 

We were assigned a room on the 7th floor which permitted us access to the Regency Club lounge on the 8th floor. Very convenient for afternoon tea & refreshments at any time. The continental buffet spread was lovely complete with cooked eggs – all at no extra cost. 

The room was spacious and comfortable and extremely clean. Some fruits were delivered courtesy of the hotel manager which we really appreciated. The room amenities were really lovely – all you could possibly need for your travels down to shoe polish and nail file! 
Though our stay was brief, it was incident-free and memorable. 

We will definitely stay at The Churchill again on a future visit to London!",5,2012,01,18

150,Terrible Experience,"We booked two rooms with connecting and non-smoking preference from 26th december til 30th december 2011 because we we were travling with children. But when we arrived at hotel, reception guy couldn't find our reservation even I had booking voucher which says two rooms booking. It took him 30 minutes to find our two rooms booking and then he told me because they didn't have our booking information earlier, he could not find non-smoking or connectiing rooms request. It took him another 30 minutes to find two rooms at smoking floor and without connecting rooms. The reception person behaved like he did a big favor to give us rooms at somking floor and without connecting rooms. He put all the blame on the booking company that they didn't send them informations about two rooms booking and when I contected the booking company they said that they had sent information about a month ago and it says on booking voucher too.
     Anyway when we arrived at the rooms, there was terrible smell of smoke from the whole floor and the rooms. Then my wife and I had to stay in differnts rooms because kids didn't want to sleep alone.
I won't recomend this hotel travling with children neither we will stay in this hotel in future.",2,2012,01,14
150,Fantastic,We arrived on the 22 nd December for 6 nights.We were delighted with the everything.The location is fantastic a 5 minute walk to Oxford Street.We had 2 connecting rooms because we have 2 children the rooms were great very clean and the staff were excellent . We will be back for sure.,4,2012,01,12
150,The red carpet treatment!!,"My wife and I booked 2 nights via the Hyatt reservation office. I have a gold card ( nothing special ) and with the points I had accumulated we able to book an Exec Club room.
From the moment we stepped over the door we were treated as if we were celebrities. Everyone asked if they could help us in any way. Smiling and professional staff from the housekeepers, the bar staff, the waiters / waitresses.  The room was  compact but had a great view over the park, was spotlessley clean.  Breakfast in the club lounge offered everything you might wish for with excellent service and smiles from all staff.
I had a business meeting in the club lounge, and my guests and I were placed in a large boardroom with all amenities.....again the staff served coffee etc .
Lunch was great downstairs in the restaurant....wine and lunch for 3 came to £140...not bad for Central London.
The position of the hotel is perfect for shopping and restaurants....just behind Oxford Street / Selfidges...but without the noise.
Special mention must go to Mr Chu in the lounge, and Sollie in the Club reception...but mostly to the management who have obviously motivated and encouraged the staff to treat its clients as V.I.P's...because we felt like this for 2 days.  Many thanks Hyatt Churchill.",5,2012,01,11
150,Great Hotel for Business & Shopping,"Stayed here many times over the years, never been let down. Great location for both business and shopping.... Looking forward to staying here again during 2012",5,2012,01,11
150,Fantastic location,I was travelling alone and felt very safe and comfortable with the location of this hotel. Convenient shopping and great sized rooms. The restaurant and bar were well worth and visit and the breakfast buffet was well stocked and catered for all tastes. Good choice for a stay in central London.,4,2012,01,10
150,Wonderful hotel in London,"I have been a Hyatt fan for a long time and I have always heard good things about the Hyatt Regency in London. My trips to London have been for business and the rates at the Hyatt were always out of what I could spend so I would pick the Hilton London Tower Bridge or Hilton Paddington; both very good hotels. After my stay at the Hyatt they were blown out of the water, just a really nice hotel. I should say I have very low expectations for any hotel in the UK, but in London I have “some” expectations. This Hyatt just impressed me hands down! I booked with points for two nights, and as a Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond I got an upgrade to a suite. Not too sure of the name of this type of a suite, it was located on the Regency Club floor.

I arrived by foot walking from the tube station, and was greeted by a doorman who walked me to the front desk. The agent quickly walked from behind the desk and escorted me to the Regency Club check in area. The elevator doors opened and there was a large reception area, with a full desk. A member of staff was at the elevator doors with a silver platter with hot towels and a welcome drink. I was greeted by name by 4 members of staff in the area. It was impressive for sure. Check in was quick, and the agents provided me all the information about the area and hotel features. I was walked to my suite and given a tour of “how things work” there was a bottle of bubbly in the room along with fresh fruit and candy.

The Regency Clubs; that’s right two of them flanked both sides of the check in area. One side was the “Business side” and the other was the “Family side”. I did check out both and the service and options were the same but the guests were much different. 

The lounges were very good! The normal daytime service of soft drinks, and teatime was available. In the evening there was a cold selection of self-service food items, accompanied by a waiter working the tables with a tray full of different hot items. There was also a nice liquor selection that you could help your self or a member of staff would take your order at the table. Breakfast was only available in the lounge for me as a Diamond, with a nice big spread of typical breakfast items; you could also order eggs from the staff.

The staff is very professional and understood the Hyatt market. I was always greeted by last name it is a bit freaky how they could keep track of all the guest names but it made one hell of a positive impression on me.",5,2012,01,08
150,A Stay Befitting a Knight,"Upon arrival, we were whisked away to the Regency Floor for our upgraded room. This is always a nice surprise and the reason I love my Diamond status with Hyatt.  For Europe our room was larger in size except for the shower, of course.  They really were quite nice accommodations with a lovely view of Portman Square/gardens.  The location is grand being only a few blocks from Oxford Street and Selfridge's.  The staff was incredible. Someone took our Mac chargers and they helped to get me something rather than buy chargers meant only for Europe. At one point I thought they were going to send someone to the Apple store to purchase one for me to use. Now that is service!  This hotel is a great option in London and I continue to be pleased with Hyatt. Thanks to all their staff for a great stay",4,2012,01,05
150,Hyatt/Churchill Hotel,"we stayed at the Churchill in Sep6tember, 2011 for 5 nights and found it to be elegant and lively, with a great restaurant and bar.  It is pretty centrally located, but be prepared to walk.  The rooms were large and well appointed.",4,2012,01,05
150,"Awesome service, good with kids, go for the Club Lounge","If you're in London, want to stay central, and don't mind paying a bit extra than other nearby hotels, consider booking a room in the Club Lounge floors (8th and 9th). You will get private checking on the 8th floor, two lounges - one more family oriented, the other a business lounge, where continental breakfast is served, as well as free canapes in the afternoon. The food selection in the lounges is excellent, not like some hotels that offer ""continental breakfast"" meaning toast, croissants, butter and jelly.

We stayed with our four children in two connected suites, and we were really comfortable throughout our stay. The rooms were ample, not huge but very addecuate for the price, with a large work desk, minibar, coffe-making apparel, TV, and a nice assortment of treats, such as an umbrella (you will likely need it!), Molton Brown bathroom equipment, and spring-loaded toilet lids (if you travel with young kids, you -will- understand the importance of this). For those who rank shower quality very high in their logbooks, the shower is awesome - constant high pressure, constant temperature, always hot water enough to boot.

The staff was always helpful and eager to make us welcome and happy. Examples: we were brought a very decent baby cot right away after we arrived, our room always had bottled,  drinking water available, I was able to print out our boarding cards for the outbound flight from the business lounge without a hitch, the night before at 11pm, when the paid WiFi (more on this later) didn't work I was given an access code right away, and the 24-hour room service is worth it. You may not use it, but I have been in hotels where you needed something at 11pm and room service was already gone an hour ago. High points for this.

Now for the not-so-good. Paid WiFi. Ugh. 55 quid (that's GBP for non-English folk) for three days of WiFi access? When you're paying 360 quid a night, tax included? Honestly, I'd rather they increased room rates a bit and included free WiFi, or at least, free for Club Lounge customers. You can dine for free on the canapes but you have to pay for WiFi.

The other not-so-good, which was more weird than not-so-good, really, was that the bathroom gear didn't get replenished automagically. That is, if you used up 85% of your excellent Molton Brown shower gel, you would NOT get a new bottle when your room was made up, but the same, sad, 85% empty bottle. We had to phone once to get shower gel as we literally ran out. They then brought two bottles of each thing within 2 minutes, so they do respond quickly. Again, in a place like this, you should always have your glass full, be it wine or shower gel, so-to-speak.

Conclusion: I will make this my official go-to hotel in London whenever I'm in town. It's hard to find service like this without paying a lot more.",5,2012,01,04
150,Great stay!,"Our first time in London, we were really pleased with our choice of the Hyatt Churchill. They treat their Goldpassport guests very well. One can order complimentary in-room coffee service, accompanied by delicious cookies. As a Hyatt Diamond member, we were given access to the Regency Club with a nice continental breakfast buffet along with cooked to order eggs in the morning, and cocktails accompanied with cheeses, desserts, hot and cold hors d'ouvres in the evening.  We stayed the week before Christmas and the hotel was beautifully decorated for the season and our suite overlooked the festively-lit Portman Square. The hotel thoughtfully recognized my husband's birthday with a beautiful cake and bottle of bubbly.

It was a convenient walk to the hop-on hop-off bus stop at Marble Arch, and even closer to the tube stop and shopping on Oxford St.

A previous reviewer recommended booking early for the best rates.  While that may generally be true, we booked 9 months in advance and saw the rates fall twice.  We didn't realize until after check-in that the rate had dropped further, such that we would have done better walking in off the street without a reservation than having booked a non-refundable Advance Purchase rate.",5,2012,01,03
150,Great Treatment Despite Lower Status,"For years I'd been a top tier (Diamond) with Hyatt and had been a frequent guest at this property. Alas, my status has dropped and I have not been a guest at the Churchill since 2008. I booked a stay using Hyatt GP points (ie FREE), and wasn't expecting much aside from a standard room.   I arrived from the US in the early am and got to the hotel around 8am.  I assumed my room would not be ready, but that I could store my one bag and then check in later in the day.  To my surprise I was escorted up to the Club Level for check in and was told I'd been upgraded to a suite! But as it was so early my suite wasn't ready. I was given the choice of taking deluxe room right now, or waiting. I opted for the former, as I was travelling alone and would only be there one night.  While checking in, I was thanked for my past stays and was brought over to the Lounge for breakfast while my room was made ready. I was then brought to a large room overlooking Portman Square Park. Soon after I got a knock on the door and was presented with a nice bottle of wine with fruit and cheese along with a note from Management welcoming me back.  My room was large, sunny and nicely appointed.  I was only in London for the day, and set out of the hotel to do some touring and shopping.  Upon returning to the hotel later in the day I stopped into the Club Lounge and found a full array of beverages and food set out.  The staff was great at coming around to replenish glasses and food, as well as making sure all were taken care of.  The Hyatt now has 2 Club Lounges on the 8th floor which makes them much more comfortable.  There is a computer available along with lots of magazines and newspapers. After a full day of walking around London, I took some snacks and champagne back to my room for a nice soak in the large bath before going to sleep. 
Checking out early the next day for my flight back to the US, my total bill was about US$ 15-- a drink in the hotel bar and a contribution to the local charity.  All in all a great experience,especially given I was not expecting anything more than an average room.  This hotel's staff really goes above and beyond for their guests and I would not hesitate to return.",5,2011,12,30
150,Great bar.,"Hotels in london are expensive, and this is no exception. However, booking in advance does seem to push the rate down to a manageable level (by London standards). The service is first-class, the rooms are plush and comfortable, and the Churchill bar is excellent. It isn't centrally located, so if you are travelling on business be aware that staying here will require taxis and journey times of upwards of 20-30 minutes to the City and or Westminster. A very very good hotel though.",4,2011,12,27
150,"Loved it, again!","This was our second visit, and it was wonderful.  This is a hotel that puts service first.  The staff is incredible, the rooms are spotless, and breakfast is fantastic.  Everyone we came in contact with from check in to the restaurant (speak to Amina or Nan, they are outstanding) were  incredibly helpful and professional.    It's a great location for shopping, and getting around is very easy, 2 tube stations (Marble Arch and Bond Street) within easy walking distance, and bus stops nearby.  The rooms are clean, a great size for London, and have all the amenities.  This is truly an excellent property and, of course, we'll stay again!",5,2011,12,25
150,What a brilliant luxurious hotel,"Very central for shopping, the hotel is luxurious and well priced.  Better than most 5-star hotels in London.",5,2011,12,20
150,Spent 3 days in London.,"Just had a quick 3 day holiday in London, and would strongly recommend this Hyatt.  Everything was at a very high standard. The hotel staff were friendly and responsive.  Good location for visiting the sites.  Bed was very comfortable.   This is a good choice.",4,2011,12,20
150,Consistently Good,"This was my second stay at The Churchill and I'm happy to say that this was another great stay. For being such a large and seemingly busy hotel they manage to be very consistent in what they do. I arrived in London very early and while I'd requested an early check in I was understandably told that it may not be possible. Expecting a long wait until check in time I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was a room ready but they had upgraded me to the Club floor. During my summer holiday stay we had been on the Club floor and had enjoyed the lounge breakfast and evening drinks so this was a great bonus for this stay.
Being able to check in so early, grab a shower and enjoy breakfast got my stay off to a great start and a nice improvement on an already great breakfast in the lounge was that they're now offering cooked to order eggs...seems like a small thing but it was really appreciated as the breakfast in the Club floor lounge offers a great alternative to the buffet in the lobby restaurant or a coffee shop. 
Service was impeccable and as previously reviewed the location of the hotel can't be beat!
Unfortunately as with my last review the elevators are still very slow...I understand it's an older building but when you're on your way out in the morning and you're waiting so long that a crowd forms and then you have to stop at almost every floor to pick up more annoyed people who have been waiting an equally long time for the lift it somehow takes away from an otherwise great experience. Once or twice when it's busy I understand, every time you take the lift is unfortunate. 
I'll be back to The Churchill and I'm sure I'll enjoy my stay and once those lifts are replace I'll be giving it 5 stars!",4,2011,12,19
150,Shop and drop your bags in your room!,"The Hyatt is one of my preferred Hotel chains in Asia but have had some indifferent experiences in the US and Europe. Fortunately the Churchill gets most things right, perhaps the best being its location. Oxford Street being the Mecca for most shoppers and tourists in London, this hotel is but a stones throw (almost literally) from Oxford Street, and yet far away to be quiet - facing Portman Square. The rooms are pleasant and particularly recommend taking the Club rooms - the facilities in the CLub lounge are superb, staff very friendly and helpful and a great place for breakfast and even better in the evenings for cocktails. The main dining room for breakfast is a bustling place, where service can be a bit iffy, but the spread is great. The Concierge, like in most good London hotels is very knowledgeable.",4,2011,12,19
150,Great choice for work and leisure,"Great location to take in the sights, shop (Oxford / Piccadilly) and work (Mayfair/Berkeley Square). 

Very nice, classy rooms. The common areas are very well-kept. Good staff, specially the helpful Japanese lady on the front desk - apologies, don't recall her name. 

If you go for work, try getting up a little early and go round for a walk to the parks closeby - even the small ones are delightful. 

Did not try food.",5,2011,12,18
150,The Internet Should Be Free!,"This is a perfectly nice hotel that would ordinarily receive a five star rating from me.  However, a 17 pound charge for using the Internet?  I've adopted a personal policy of giving all hotels charging more than a nominal fee for Internet usage a one-star rating to encourage hotels to drop this predatory practice.  We shouldn't have to pay for the Internet at a five star hotel any more than we should pay for shampoo or toilet water.  It's an essential part of life.",1,2011,12,16
150,Beautiful hotel,"I really enjoyed staying at the hotel with just a couple small exceptions.  The location was really great - very close to a ton of shopping and all the tourist sties.  The hotel itself was really beautiful and grand.  Everything was decorated for Christmas and the decorations were classy everything looked both classic and modern at the same time.  I thought the rooms were great, not huge, but that wasn't expected.  The bathroom was pretty large, very clean and the shower worked great.  Room also came with a hair dryer, iron, robe and slippers.  I found the bed to be very comfortable and I slept great both nights. 

My biggest issue was the cost to use the phone was ridiculous.  It cost about 10GBP per MINUTE to use the phone - I found that out the hard way when I had a 260GPB bill at check out.  Besides taking advantage of people who do not know the rate, I have no idea how they can charge that rate.  

I did try out the breakfast and thought it was pretty good -definitely not worth the price though - there are a lot of neighboring restaurants where you can get a better meal for about 1/3 the price. I did really enjoy the Churchill bar and the prices were fair there.

Overall, it was a great location, taxis were lined up at the hotel and available, and I had a comfortable stay.  The hotel itself was beautiful and I'd come back again.",4,2011,12,13
150,Location is great! So are staff and services!,"The location of this hotel is its biggest plus point. Very strategically located just off the main shopping and eating street of london - oxford street, this hotel at portman square makes it really easy to access the underground (Marble arch station is a 5-7 minute walk, and Bond Street station is approximately 10 minutes) as well as buses and trams. Its also very close to edgware road where you get some of the best arab food in the world (at the Maroosh restaurants, and Helen's Shawarma). 

The hotel itself is very comfortable, and even though I've stayed in both club rooms and regular deluxe rooms both are spacious and meet the standards of all 5 stars. The service is very good and hotel staff is friendly and accommodating. We lost a room key 2ce and they were happy to help us although they did make sure we had the necessary identifications for security purposes. On the whole, the location is great and experience in the hotel is really good as well. Rooms are spacious and comfortable and stylishly done up.",5,2011,12,12
150,Great hotel!,"Just recently refubrished, very nice and spacious rooms with great beds, just like in every Hyatt, that make you want to sleep forever... We stayed in the Regency club floor, real value if you spent time in the hotel, exceptional breakfast you can order even hot food and avoid the croud at the main restaurant. You can have snacks, fruits and coffee during the day and canape buffet in the evenings, also take away water, drinks etc. Internet was free as well.
The location is really good, 2 mins walk from the tube station of Marble Arch or Bond street and of course Oxford street!!!! My favourite hotel, I stay there every time I am in London.",5,2011,12,09
150,excellent hotel - high quality,The Churchill is a very comfortable & welcoming hotel in an excellent location - stayed 1 night last week - the hotel was very tastefully decorated for Christmas.  Room was well equipped as was the bathroom. Very comfortable bed. Friendly staff & good service.  Breakfast & internet service expensive - it would be a benefit to have a more generous rate for residents - especially as many hotels offer free wi-fi.,5,2011,12,06
150,Below Expectations...!,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend.  First of all, staff was friendly and reception was nice.  When I entered my standard room I thought that I will find complimentary water as expected by the 5 star hotels. And when I call the room service they said that their is no complimentary water for standard rooms!  Any way, I think that this hotel is equivalent to 3 or 4 stars hotels and its waist of money.  I didn't like the hotel because:
1. No security key for the lifts, as any one can take the lift.
2. Rooms are very noisy, especially at night I was hearing the next room people talking and laughing.
3. Not very clean bathroom.
4. The door of the room was not secure, as there is just one lock for the door.
5. Complimentary tea and coffee tray includes just the English breakfast lea, and Nestle coffee, sugar and milk.  No green tea or other types of tea and No biscuits.
6. No free Wi-Fi in neither rooms nor reception.

The good things I found are:
1.Location.
2.Comfort beds.
3.Variety of TV channels.(especial Arabic ones)",3,2011,12,05
150,"Great Hotel, Great Service","My Wife and I did a last minute trip to London in October and stayed at the Churchill, partly because we had some Hyatt points we could redem for free nights. We stayed on the Regency Club floor and the staff were Superb. The Hotel is located in Central London on the Mayfair/Marleybone border. We were a 5 minute walk from either the Marble Arch or Bond Street Undergrounds.
The rooms were spacious and the Hotel Staff were incredibly accomodating.     The concierge(s) went out of their way to help us. Another surprise benefit to the Hotel was it's closeness to an area called St. Christophers Square with all of it's restaurants and shops, Pubs and Boutiques.
The only possible negative to the Hotel was the Italian Restaurant which we thought was overpriced, especially with all the other choices nearby.
We would certainly return to this property if we go back to London.",5,2011,12,05
150,Good Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights in early November 2011. Overall, a good experience. Only drawbacks are the number of rooms in the hotel, the crowded lobby, and the slow elevators during 'rush' hours.
The positives are that staff are amazing - from the doormen to the frontdesk to the housekeeping staff - they all strive to make each guest feel welcome and good about being here. The rooms are well appointed, clean, good crisp sheets and a very comfortable bed. Only drawbacks are the small size of rooms and no separate shower stalls (unless in a suite). 
Will come back to this property again.",4,2011,12,05
150,Convenient but small rooms,"Stayed in a club room for two nights.  The refurbished rooms and club lounge are good, especially the idea of two dining areas in the club, one for families and one for people staying on business.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Only downside is that the regular rooms are small and bathrooms only large enough to have a shower over the bath, no separate shower cubicle.",4,2011,12,05
150,Great hotel,Location is great as a base for sightseeing.  Room was excellent and the services were better.  The concierge and front desk were extremely friendly and helpful.,5,2011,11,28
150,"Great hotel, close to shopping","Room was large, food was excellent, and location is superb.  Room service was quite pricey ($150 USD for one entree and half a bottle of wine), but I have no complaints about the quality.",5,2011,11,27
150,Great stay for business,"Location: excellent, right in the heart of Central London.  Great for business and shopping/restaurants/attractions.

Check-in: quick, friendly efficient.  Saw that I was staying on points and immediately looked to upgrade me without having to ask.

Business facilities: not really checked but Club Lounge facilities are excellent.

Room: Everything the business traveller would want.  Amenities are fine (plenty of free mineral water).  Room was very clean.Only mild gripe is the price of internet which should be free.

Check-out: gave me a no quibble 3pm checkout time.  Front desk was again efficient, friendly and helpful.

Summary: would absolutely stay here again.",5,2011,11,26
150,Expensive but nice for London,"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency London several times. The property is expensive, but in line with other similar hotels in London.
The location is good. Easy access by The Tube,  
Rooms and beds are small, but rooms have excellent amenities. 
The gym is not up to Hyatt expectation. Don't expect a pool, steam rooms or any of such facilities to relax after a full day.
The Hyatt Club is one of the best. 
Staff is very friendly. Don't expect anyone to help you with your bags when using the side entrance to the hotel. Security may push your elevator button - but I had to carry my 3 suitcases.",4,2011,11,24
150,Simply the best,We always come back to the Hyatt. I like the separate check-in and check-out at the Club Floor. My 5 night stay was excellent. Had ample supply of water & toiletries without having to ask. The location is so ideal!,5,2011,11,24
150,Superb hotel - Couldn't fault it,"I treated myself to a 3 night stay from the 18-21 November. I booked it on Lastminute.com and found a good price. My room was on the 5th floor and was excellent. The bed was very comfortable indeed and the room very large and bright. It overlooked other area's of the hotel and not the square but nevertheless it was lovely. It had a nice seating area and a work desk if you need it.

i was delighted to sit on my large king bed in my supplied robe and slippers eating my patisserie basket (only £8 delivered to the room) whilst reading my free and delivered copy of the times!  I was quite tickled sitting there as I am not normally used to staying in 5* hotels in London. It really was a post birthday treat.

It is close to all shops and not too far from Marble Arch underground but I was quite surprised that it only cost £10 to get back to Victoria. Very accessible to most places. It was a glorious weekend, easy access too to sit in Marble Arch watching the world go by.

The staff are all very polite and professional, doors are held open for you by the porters and the concierge were all lovely, as was the reception team. Room/cleaning staff were all polite and said good morning/evening etc.  I was on my own so just really came and went at my leisure as I was attending various theatre shows.  I can honestly say that my 3 nights was really, really lovely.  I only wish I could have afforded the executive room on the upper floors with lounge access but alas it wasn't to be.

My only complaint and that had nothing at all to do with the hotel was a couple of idiots in the next room singing explicit rugby songs at 4.40 am - I would have hoped that people who could afford to stay at such a lovely hotel could have conducted themselves more appropriately. I should have complained but chose not to but I have no doubt that if I had then the hotel would have acted immediately, their customer service is second to none.

The hotel foyer/lobby is bright and clean and a pleasure to sit in whilst waiting for a friend to arrive so we could go out for a meal.  I didn't use the restaurant or bar but the breakfast room service was great, I ordered my basket for 8 one morning and 7.15 the next and my breakfast arrived on the dot, well presented and just a pleasure to eat.

I would certainly recommend this hotel and really do hope I can return again next year.",5,2011,11,23
150,Great hotel with excellent staff!,"The Hyatt Churchill has a good location in London.  It has a staff that is eager to please and so gives great service. The Regency Club Lounge has an amazing array at breakfast.  They even cook your eggs to order while you enjoy other things like fruit, salmon and bagels, toast, yogurt, etc.  They are happy to serve tea any time of the day and there are things like fruit available all day. We missed the cocktail hour most days because we were out touring but on the two evenings that we made it back, we enjoyed a nice assortment of appetizers, cheeses, etc.
The staff knew our name(s) after the first day and could not have been more helpful!  The lounge staff greeted us each morning cheerfully.
We were on a Regency Club Floor which had been refurbished and was quite lovely. It was not on the same floor as the lounges or the check-in location so we did have to wait for the elevator every now and then.
Having the check-in and check-out ability on the Regency Club floor was nice although as it turned out, we could have been checked in by the regular lobby staff faster since there was a very long line upstairs the day we checked in.  The staff did offer to have us wait in the lounge and served us beverages while we waited. They tried to be most accommodating!
We look forward to our next stay at this lovely hotel!",5,2011,11,23
150,"great staff, fantastic stay","The Hytt Regency, located just behind Selfridges, is a hotel that understands customer care. I stayed with my sister on an overnight shopping trip to London, and my only regret is that we only got to spend one night. The staff is absolutely lovely (special mention to Natalie) and made sure we had a trouble-free, delightful stay. The room was impeccable, while the cocktail hour at the executive lounge so good we almost cancelled our dinner reservations. Great Chardonnay, great service with a smile. Please don't change.",5,2011,11,22
150,Great hotel -quirky deficiencies,"The hotel has a great location and great service. The two areas for improvement - oddly small closet (drawers take up all but 6"" of space - with only room for one hanging piece and not deep enough for a hanger to be used properly) and non existent water temperature adjustment in the shower / tub. It is clear that 722 is a room to be avoided (and I expect all others ending in '22).  All else was very good and deserving of 5 stars. I will stay agin, but not in that room.",4,2011,11,19
150,"A for Apple, B for Bananas, and C for Cookies makes the Exec.Lounge","

Having upgraded with 100 quids a night for the Executive Lounge, we stayed for 3 nights. The lounge was a disappointment. Only stocked with apples, bananas, and chocolate chip cookies the whole day and every day, the evening cocktail hour wasn't much of an improvement with miserly prawns or chicken pieces brought around by a staff at a leisurely pace and handed out piece by  piece to guests  as if the hotel was running a diet centre. The lounge is small and simply does no justice to exec floor guests and the up graders expecting a grander Hyatt Regency Lounge experience. Breakfast in the lounge was acceptable but hardly a good selection with great English eggs cooked to your liking but no hot accompaniments like mushrooms, tomatoes or potatoes,  served though  by staff who do  maintain an excellent standard of service.        ",4,2011,11,19
150,One of London's best,"This hotel is fantastically positioned just a five minute walk from Marble Arch, making it perfect for accessing the tourist areas and the city. From the moment the bowler-hatted doorman welcomes you, the Churchill makes you feel special. The public rooms are opulent but busy. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable with just a couple of nit-picking design issues too minor to mention. The Churchill is not cheap but for a luxury weekend in London you will be pushed to find better. Staff are courteous and attentive. I WILL be back",5,2011,11,19
150,Everything Faultless,"We stayed here for a belated anniversary celebration and were treat like Royalty.

Morena on reception upgraded us straight away to the Regency Club floors where the room was immaculate. Lunch at the restaurant was a 3 course treat and exceptional value. We returned to the room after a show in the evening to find a bottle of prosecco, cake and a card from the manager of the hotel.

The hotel exceeded our expectations at every juncture and we will absolutely return. Thankyou.
",5,2011,11,19
150,"Tremendous location, terrible food","The location is premium, right behind Selfridges on Oxford Street. Wonderful restaurants nearby, rooms were small - we were upgraded to the Club rooms but they were still tiny. I guess one can't expect larger spaces in the center of London!
The concierge and guest services were top class.
Food at their coffee shop was disappointing. Otherwise, I would recommend the place simply because it is a certain standard in a top class location.",3,2011,11,18
150,Hyatt delivers,I'm never disappointed with Hyatt. The mattresses are always my favorite among hotel chains. This location even had fluffy bathrobes.  Close to west end theatre. Another plus is that it's a ten minute/8 pound cab ride to Paddington station where we caught the Heathrow Express. The Hyatt desk folks were very helpful with transportation logistics.,5,2011,11,18
150,A good hotel a great location,"I normally use the Hyatt when in London on business and it never fails to deliver. The rooms are good, clean and appointed well. The reception staff are great, the staff in the restaurant, which I have only used for breakfast are so-so, albeit the food is good and fresh.
My last stay had me in a room next to the meeting rooms on the 2nd floor. I duly phoned down to say that it was a bit noisy for my liking and they duly transferred me to a room on the 7th which had just been renovated.",4,2011,11,17
150,Great service,My wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in the hotel.Extremely friendly and efficient staff and i can really recommend teh hotel.I would happily return as teh location is excellent for central London.,4,2011,11,15
150,overall very good but expensive,"i was attending a conference here and hence opted to stay in the hotel, even though it was quite expensive. Given the central location though, the price was almost justified. the hotel is a grand old hotel with a good reputation and a certain standing and it lived up to my expectations. The room was adequate if a little tired (paint flaking, silly little clock radio with complicated tuning mechanism, no antenna and no instructions), reasonably sized and, for a London hotel, the air conditioning worked wonderfully. Room service was good, frequent and generous with fruit, toiletries and even a free bottle of wine. bedding and mattress all clean and of good quality and i had several very good nights sleep. The staff are all very helpful, the restaurant is always busy and serves good quality food and the hotel bar, while a little undersized, is actually a nice and cosy retreat. I would be happy to return here with my family on future private visits.",4,2011,11,14
150,Great customer service!,"Stayed here partly for business, then long weekend with my son. The hotel is a high-end business type hotel, very busy, beautiful decor, perfect location close to Oxford Street & tube station. Great breakfast buffet. What was outstanding was the customer service. I got sick with a horrible sore throat and eye infection and had the hotel call a doctor. They responded immediately, he came within 30mins and had needed medicine with him. When I checked out the manager of the hotel was kind of enough to take a few minutes to come by and see how I was doing. When we got home, I discovered I left my iPod in the room. They sent it out asap and I had it the next business day. Everyone at the hotel was super helpful, friendly, all customer service oriented from the waitress at breakfast, to the concierge, to the lady and reception. This type of customer service and attention is truly to be commended.",5,2011,11,11
150,Absolutely perfect!,"Really good location, near to tube stations and to Oxford Street. Everything within walking distance. Rooms were clean and spacious. Especially enjoyed the top notch gym. Food during breakfast was excellent and beds were comfortable. Had a most comfortable stay.",5,2011,11,10
150,Great central location and a good quality hotel,"The Hyatt Regency Churchill is very centrally located for Oxford Street shopping (towards the Selfridges end) yet sufficiently away from the crowds of Oxford Street to allow a peaceful and quiet base to explore London, if that is what you want.
I have stayed there twice now despite actually living in London and working in Central London as it's a nice place for a short weekend break with the family.
The most recent occasion we stayed it was my daughter's birthday and we mentioned this on checking in and the staff very kindly upgraded us to a Club Room which was great!  We loved chilling out in the Club Lounge on the 8th floor and also got a free continental breakfast there each morning.  It gets a little busy in the lounge when the main drinks/canapes service starts but if you come at off times (when there is not a lot of food out) it's still nice to grab a beer and chill out and you can get a wifi signal!
We parked at the car park behind the hotel which is a little pricey but just a bit easier than hunting for parking (something like £25-30 per day overnight from memory).  However on Sunday we easily found parking on a single yellow/pay and display bay (although that will change very soon with Westminster's new parking rules).
Overall I would not hesitate to stay there again, the only downside was the queue on checkout was lengthy and slow but still worth the experience.
Thanks to everyone there for making our stay very pleasant!",4,2011,11,07
150,"Staff, Location and breakfast. Brilliant!!","The Staff was welcoming and accommodating. The Location a block from Oxford st, easy stroll to Hyde Park and the tube at Marble Arch.  The breakfast was great, had eggs benedict every morning. Do think they need to include Wi Fi for guests? Beds were very comfortable. Enjoyed my stay there and would recommend it to others.",4,2011,11,05
150,Fantastic Hotel....5 stars !!!!,"This is a great hotel !!!

Regency Club is the way to go.  

Staff are top notch !!!",5,2011,11,05
150,Perfect location; wonderful service,"My husband was on business and I accompanied him.  I was concerned that I'd have to take the tube or a taxi everywhere.  This hotel is in a location that allows you to take a short walk to a great shopping district and to a wonderful museum, that houses the Wallace Collection.  The concierge was exceptionally courteous and quite knowledgeable when we asked about restaurants and pubs, as well as when we asked about tube stops and train stations.  When we arrived we received a room that was not to our liking.  We were moved immediately and upon our return after travel outside of London, we were upgraded to the concierge floor to make up for the previous room.  We were provided with a bottle of wine, a basket of fruit and a box of chocolates.  The concierge floor is exceptional:  wonderful amenities such a cocktail hour complete with heavy o'devours and a very knowledgeable staff.  The hotel restaurant and bar was very nice as well.  I would absolutely stay at this hotel again and tell others to do so as well.",5,2011,11,01
150,Churchill stay exceeded expectations...,"We just got back from a week in London...and stayed at the Hyatt Churchill for 4 of the days.  Great location that allowed us to walk almost everywhere.  Staff and service were outstanding.  Everyone we encountered truly seemed thankful that we were there.  I highly recomend the Regency Club level if you have the status / can afford.  Morning b-fast and nightly cocktails were more than we expected.  Again, staff were outstanding.  Nice pub and attached to a terrific italian restaurant - Locanda Locatelli.",5,2011,10,31
150,Had a great time!,"My husband and I stayed there on September for 7 days. It was fantastic. Staff very helpfull, trained personnel, always trying to help. Room was very clean, smelled fresh everyday. Great amenities in the bathroom. Room service was fast and delicious. Check in and check out very efficient. The use os the lounge is always a plus, we had a great time!",5,2011,10,31
150,Excellent breakfast...,"We stayed at Hyatt Regency- The Churchill on business. Room is nice and quiet. The bed is very comfortable. Service is great. The hotel is close to the subway stations. Elevators are small and can take a little long at rush hours. Breakfast buffet is excellent--My favorite is the chocolate croissant... but the line can be long if you go there around 9:30. Overall, recommended...",4,2011,10,31
150,"Really enjoyable, great Regency Club, super service!","The Churchill is ideally located for business and leisure in Mayfair/SOHO. The Regency Club offers fantastic breakfast, excellent service in a very nice setting. The restaurant and lobby bar are excellent. If you need WifI ask at the reception for a 1 or 24 hour pass.The rooms are (for London standards) quite spacious, offer a nice bathroom and are well equipped. It made our stay very enjoyable and I can recommend it wholeheartedly.",5,2011,10,31
150,"GREAT HOTEL, GREAT STAFF","Just got back from a trip to the United Kingdom and enjoyed not one but two separate stays at the Hyatt Regency London.  Located in the West end, the Hyatt Regency London--aka The Churchill is a top class hotel.  Rooms are spacious, customer service is excellent.  Stayed on the Regency Club level and enjoyed two large and comfortable Regency Club lounges with complimentary breakfasts (including made to order eggs), light snacks throughout the day and cocktails and hor d'ouevres.  Computer made available in Lounge and in business center for modest fee and wi-fi service.  Particularly gracious and helpful concierge staff, friendly and caring personnel and great front doormen.  Also kudos to helpful and friendly bellmen and housekeepers.  We have always been great fans of the Hyatt chain, and this one is among the best of them.  And the location--so close to great shopping, underground services and great walking areas makes the place ideal.",5,2011,10,28
150,"Comfortable, good location","We stayed here while traveling with Tauck tours, so the price was included in our tour. We were offered an upgrade with a small view  and a little bit bigger room on arrival. Before we made a decision Monika from the front desk took us to the room, for us to make the decision. She was very delightful and informative. We did take the upgrade, but in retrospect it was probably not worth the extra money. The room was a good size, bathroom on the small size , with a handheld shower nozzle. Very comfortable beds and linens.
Concierges were very helpful, with restaurant choices. A nice breakfast buffet available. The Churchill bar is a wonderful spot to end the night with a glass of wine.",4,2011,10,28
150,Awful experience,"I am a gold passport member and spent 2 months in a hyatt hotel, I saved some hyatt points and spent them on two nights in the Churchill, but I had to pay for a additional twin room at £300 plus £60 tax!!! Overall the staff were alright, but reception staff made many mistakes. I will not be staying ever again in a hyatt, even though my 2 months in hyatt India was pleasent. They offered breakfast at £27 each per day- for the amount of money I payed I would have expected a much better hotel. The cavendish is a good example of a decent London hotel",1,2011,10,23
150,"Expensive, but it is London!","As always, you can count on great beds and linens at Hyatt.  We were close to Hyde Park, the tube and the double decker hop on hop off buses.",4,2011,10,22
150,Good Hotel (Good Shopping),Next to Oxford Street. Awesome location. Good Concierge. (I tend to rely on them for everything). Spacious room in the Middle on London. Good Food.,5,2011,10,18
150,good choice,had a great time there hope every onr had breakfest included because it was great  and service was good also  rooms were a bit small for the price but built  for the 20   it was o k.  thanks timmer,4,2011,10,14
150,great hotel,"What a nice surprise. Clean Room, Friendly staff, reasonable rates and great location. We would stay here again",4,2011,10,13
150,A great hotel in London,We had a room on the Regency Club floor and found it most comfortable and well appointed. The hotel is very well located for convenience to Oxford Street and other points of interest.  The hotel staff were most accomodating and helpful. The service was superior and the Regency Club continental breakfasts were very comprehensive. Everything that could have been done to make our stay pleasant was done. We will staya\ at the Churchill again and can highly recommend it to our friends.,5,2011,10,11
150,You really can find a quiet room in London,"Traveling aproximately 100 day of the year, I want to sleep well.  This hotel really works with you to ensure they meet all your requirements.  I always ask for a high floor, quiet room away from elevators, vending and ice machines.  In this case, I asked for all of the above plus no view.  This resulted in Room 859.  Lovely view of a rooftop which guarantees no buses, delivery trucks, taxis, etc. to disturb my sleep.  Excellent Club Room.  It's perfect except if you want to use the blow dryer, you must move into the living room and use the plug at the desk.  Other than that, it's everything you would want in a room.  Both Club Lounges are very well run, great food offerings, pleasant staff and always efficient.  Did not try the Italian restaurant but heard good reviews from others who had.  Great location for shopping and safety.",5,2011,10,11
150,Convenient/good service,"Stayed at this hotel with family recently. The hotel is in the process of being remodelled, therefore, some floors/rooms are in better condition than others. The italian restaurant on its premises is very good, however, the hyped ""High Tea"" service leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what you pay and what you get in return: not worth it. Location is all right; and staff, particularly concierge was very helpful.",4,2011,10,10
150,Perfect London location,"We had a great stay in a king + roll-away room. Extremely good location with walking distance to Hyde park, New Bond st, shopping, restaurants, Mayfair bars etc. Easy access to/from LHR with express train and taxi. Wonderful park opposite hotel with small playground as well. Very nice and service minded staff. Will definately stay there again on my next visit to London.",5,2011,10,09
150,Clean and beautiful,"This is a good hotel. It's located in a very good place.
The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfy and the staff is very nice. The only bad thing is that is a little bit pricey.",5,2011,10,03
150,Loved it.....,"Great location, very helpful staff, good size rooms and good rate!!! what else could I ask for. Pity they were full after 2 days and couldnt accommodate a longer stay. will be back ( if they can give me the same rate)",4,2011,09,30
150,"Great experience, especially the conciere","I stayed at The Churchill while on business. My first time in London from the US and my stay was for only 48 hours before leaving for another EU city. Staying here is an experience. The staff is friendly, the rooms are spacious and have a refined elegance to them, but best of all, the conciere assisted in my request to find a thank you gift for agency I was their meeting. Since I am unfamiliar with London, they took care of it all for me and made me look great with the advertising agency. Its a beautiful hotel. You should get you pay for these days and they certainly deliver.",5,2011,09,27
150,Full Marks,"I can highly recommend this hotel.  Very clean and updated rooms.  Although the bathrooms are small (what can you expect in London) they are very clean and very good shower.
This hotel is situated just behind Oxford Street so is well placed for shopping and easy for theatre district.
We stayed on the Club floor and the Club Lounge was very good - spacious and good food.",5,2011,09,26
150,Great Stay !,"We had to spend 2 days in London and following my previous experiences in the past ,i am very weary of where i stay and through my travel agent foumd the Churchill. From the minute we checked in ,to the end of our stay i found the staff Ricardo,Robin and the rest of the team ,extremely professional and helpfull. We were upgraded to a smoking room with balcony without any fuss. I cannot honestly fault this Hotel in any way. The plus is also that it is in the middle on London and close to all sites/happenings.
Definitely my place to stay in the future.!!!   
Will recommend to anyone visiting London !!!

150,Solid choice for London.,"I am in so many loyalty programs it's difficult to be dominated by just one (though I guess a lean towards Hilton if I had to choose). I was staying at the Hyatt Churchill because I was to hold a small meeting for about 20 people and had selected the property due to meeting space availability.

This is a well kept property, though built in the days when ""London"" hotels though well appointed were always designed by uninspired architects - what's with the low ceilings in the corridors and rooms -- what did it save?  So the Hyatt while a very high quality property in many respects does not feel like a deluxe hotel. 

The rooms are well furnished but are small, and the bathroom was tiny. 

The public areas consisted of a very nice and way above average lobby lounge - for breakfast lunch, tea, drinks etc. The service was excellent and food offerings also very good indeed.

The Hyatt location does get 5 stars. These days I tend identify hotel rates on Expedia or Kayak; and then when I have narrowed down the choices or made a selection I book through Amex Centurion Travel.

The Hyatt Churchill is a solid choice, and I doubt you'd be disappointed.

One additional comment about the London restaurant and much-hyped The Wolsely on Park Lane. Went there for dinner with the family. The service was pathetic, the Martini glasses were so small they looked as though they'd come from some kind of toy-set. The food was mediocre, the place is noisy - just can't see what the attraction is. I would never go back. On the other hand Bar Boulud at the Mandarin Oriental is very good, and worth trying.",4,2011,09,25
150,Great Stay,"Arrived at the Churchill around noon and room was not ready but were invited to wait in the lounge (due to Diamond status w/ Hyatt). Lounge is large, clean, well lit, and thouroghly stocked. While waiting staff kept me informed of the progress of my room. Just shy of two hours later our room was ready, it was a large suite with 1.5 baths, complete with large sitting area and bed room and bath (shower+soaking tub). Asked for wake up call and coffee at 03.45 the next day and both were prompt. Check-out was quick and easy. 

Location is wonderful: M&S, Hyde park, and Oxford st.  are less than 10minutes away on foot. Paddington station (Heatrow Express) is 15min. by cab (10 pound trip) and London City Airport (LCY) is less than 20 minutes away.

When ever I travel to London the Churchill is my ONLY choice.",5,2011,09,24
150,"Great hotel, just spoilt by the booking company","We stayed at the churchill for a night for a fancy theater break in london, we were originally booked into the intercontinental on park lane, but they had over booked so we were transfered to the Churchill.
Two of us arrived early and we were unable to check into our room but they stored are bags for us while had a look round oxford street and waited for the 3rd person to join us, our friend rung us to say she was at the hotel and that they has let her go up to our room, we went back to reception and they'd already sent our bags to our room.
The only problem was when we got to our room on the second floor that they had given us a twin room with two beds for 3 people, and it clearly stated on our booking that it was for 3 people.
My friends went down to reception to complain and the hotel wanted to put a camp bed into our twin room, which they didnt accept, they asked for a change of room and the hotel wanted to charge us £300 extra plus VAT to transfer us into a king size room, eventually they agreed to move us at no extra cost but there was still a camp bed in the king size room.
They said this would take two hours and too leave our stuff in our room and they would move our bags for us, which they had when returned to our new room, after being told at reception that we didnt have a booking!
The room was lovely, view wasnt great but we werent bothered, lovely comfy bed and loads of room for 3 people!
The complimentary breakfast was good too, choice of either a full english or fruits, pastrys and cereals, you could also order other things on the menu.
All in all a good hotel, service was excellent with the bags and things just a shame that we had such a mix up, but we will be taking it up with the booking company to see if we originally had a triple room deisigned for 3 people at the intercontinental, and if so why were we moved to a hotel that doesnt actually have any triple rooms.",4,2011,09,19
150,A very nice stay,"I love most the Hyatts, and I really love this one.  The rooms are not that large but the windows open for fresh air, the amenities are top notch and the hotel itself is very nice.  Molten Brown shampoo was a real BONUS!!!!

We lost a laptop in a taxi and the concierge helped us get it back after only 2 hours and was very nice printing up our boarding passes.

I did have the regency club the last time I stayed which was well worth it.  Lots of good food and drinks throughout the day....",5,2011,09,15
150,nice room and good location,"We stayed here for 1 night which was really nice and the King size bed was very comfortable room designe was a little boring but it was sophisticated and the service was really nice, foyer area was very nice looking aswell. 

The room service breakfast was nice a tad expensive but hotels always are 

Alll in all a very nice hotel just a little too much like every other hotel.",3,2011,09,12
150,Excellent hotel and service,"I stayed here on our way to a buiness trip in Scotland. My wife and I landed at Heathrow and we spent 2.5 days in London before taking train to Scotland. I wanted to spend a nice few days with my wife so I used points to get a room on club level. 

Room was very nice and well kept. Reasonable size for European room. Service was excellent. Granted that the club level has its own check in and seemed to go the extra mile but i still feel they were worth commending. This includes the check in staff as well as the lounge staff. We had room service and food was better than most hotel room service quality.

Concerige on the main level helped me with an emergent issue regarding a presentation that was coming in via Fed Ex but was delayed. He went above and beyond.  

The hotel had a separate person who helped us get theater tickets. We were able to get tickets for a show that was reportedly sold out, albeit the tickets were a bit pricey. 

All in all, the hotel and service delivered and helped make a nice little break away. I honestly cannot comment on value since we booked room with points. I suspect this hotel would be pricey but if par with other high quality hotels in London, i would say its worth it. We stayed at another major chain in London the year prior (similar status) and the Hyatt Churchill surpassed it by far.",5,2011,09,11
150,Fantastic Hotel!!!,"My wife and I just had a wonderful experience at the Hyatt Regency London - Churchill. An extremely well trained and friendly staff, a Club Floor that is as good as it gets and the location of the Hotel being in close proximity to Oxford & Bond Streets makes it a real winner.  Having been fortunate enough to stay at some of the great London hotels like Claridge's, Savoy and Intercontinental, my new hotel of choice is definitely Hyatt Regency London!!",5,2011,09,08
150,Satisfactory,"I stayed two nights for business. Service is satisfactory. The building is a bit old, but well maintained.",4,2011,09,05
150,Fab Hotel,"Booked this Hotel through Lastminute.com at a very reasonable rate and could not have been more pleased. Hotel is in a fab location just behind selfridges, staff are very helpful and rooms are modern and spacious. I think the hotel is more geared towards the business user but for a weekend in the west end i would highly recommend.",5,2011,09,04
150,"Conservative hotel, great location","Stayed at The Churchill for 7 days on a recent business trip. You can't really fault the location of this hotel. It's very easy to commute to virtually anywhere in the city either via a taxi or the tube or on foot.  I stayed on the Club Level and would highly recommend it.  The Club concierge staff were excellent. Businessmen did get preferential treatment/seating during the breakfast service which amused me and there were a few other issues during my week long stay, but overall it was a quite a pleasant stay. As the name suggests, this hotel is rather conservative -  it's certainly not cool in anyway - however it is an ideal hotel for 40+ business travellers or holiday makers.",4,2011,09,03
150,"Lovely hotel, great location.","My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of a sight-seeing trip to London.

As we were checking in the lady at reception was very friendly and helpful, asking us if we needed directions anywhere, telling us the best routes and giving us a map of London. I was however, disappointed about the 'insurance' the hotel tried to take from me. - I got the room on a cheap deal on laterooms.com, as I would never normally be able to afford it. I left just enough for the room for two nights on my card to pay, I gave the card to the woman to take payment and she said it hadn't gone through. (I obviously started to panick) Only then did she explain on top of the bill, the hotel takes £200 from your card, incase you use their payable services in your trip, -i.e DVD player, renting films, mini bar etc... - I explained to her we wouldn't be using any of these, so she said that would be okay. I was shocked she was just going to take this without any explaination.

After all that she asked if we would like help with our bags and gave us our room key. I was impressed with the room we had. Fairly plain yet modern and comfy. Freeview flat screen TV, large desk, seperate chair and footstool, ipod docking system, and a very very comfy bed. I wanted to take the bed, pillows and duvet home with me, you will certainly get a good nights sleep in that! It's king size too which helps! The bathroom was small, but had everything you needed. Toiletries, bath robes and towels. What's also handy is in the wardrobes you get plenty of hangers, a clothes brush, iron and ironing board, sewing kit, and safe. Overall I was very impressed with the hotels look, very grand and stylish!

The hotel is in a great location for everything you need, its about a 2 minute walk to Oxford street, and walk another minute down that and you are at Marble Arch tube station. Very handy!

In in all I had a lovely stay here, location was the best part, however I would not choose to stay here if I had to pay the full price!",4,2011,09,01
150,Great Hotel.,"Stayed here as part of a trip to London.
The family room was large and clean.
The staff were very nice and helpful.
The Montagu restaurant was first class with excellent food and drink.
Location is good,just around the corner from Selfridges.
We really enjoyed our stay and would go back.
Well done Hyatt Regency London.",5,2011,08,30
150,amazing hyatt tucked away in the heart of london right next to oxford st,"i have stayed at this property previously, but it never fails to please me. The club floor is a must, full day access to the lounge, breakfast in the lounge, a great place for meetings, and there is no extra charge for guests, like at other hyatts. The rooms are beautiful, the typical hyatt bed, (Incredibly comfortable) with nice views. 
One block away is Oxford street, selfridges, Marks & spencer. The staff at this hotel understand the word ""service"" really well done to all at this Hyatt. I will keep coming back.",5,2011,08,27
150,Very convenient and welcome luxury to the usual Hyatt standard!,Spent  two nights mid August at the Hyatt Regency Churchill for a weekend break. Parked the car in the Hotel carpark which was most conveneint. The location is perfect for getting on the tube and getting to all key locations in London. The breakfasts as usual were very good . Did not have an opportunity to eat for dinner as we had dinners and shows etc elsewhere. Very good levels of  service and attention to details. Would stay again for the quaility and convenient location.,5,2011,08,22
150,Best Hyatt Bar None--London was a treat,"I have stayed at many Hyatts across the United States, and have had mixed results. 
This Hyatt exceeds them all by a mile. from the minute we arrived, hot, sweaty and tired after a 12 hour flight we were treated like royalty. We were ushered upstairs for a check-in at the regency club lounge, served iced tea and breakfast before as they looked into getting us a room (it was early morning). Turns out there were no rooms, but they took the luggage and we were free to spend the day in the city. 

Upon arriving back in the mid afternoon, we were handed keys to a luxurious room, the luggage had been put away, the air conditioning turned on, wine and cheese were delivered.

Everything in the entire hotel is new, clean and very high quality from the fast elevators to the bedding. None of the odd pillows that turn flat they give you in most Hyatt hotels. 

The concierge team was awesome and provided us info on the public transit, events and even changed money for us at a good rate. All the staff exceeded expectations of hospitality in their manner, attitude, efficiency and results. 

The only thing that was not excellent at the Churchill was the complimentary cocktail hour in the evening did not as much of a selection as some of the others I have encountered, but the white wines were of good quality.",5,2011,08,19
150,Welcoming and Friendly place,"Stayed over here for two nights and it was lovely. All room categories are same size only thing changes is view and service. I would 100 % recommend to stay on club floor because it is more personalised and I love lounges after long days work.

Friendly staff & value for money : ))",5,2011,08,19

150,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic service",What a wonderful experience staying at this hotel for about 9 days.  The level of attention and service from all the staff was second to none.  A special thanks to concierge Adela who was absolutley delightful and most helpful.  The breakfast was amazing.  We stayed on the club floor (#8) and we had the luxury of having free snacks and drinks during the 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m period.  We also ate once in the dining lounge for dinner and we had drinks most nights at the fabulous Churchill Bar.  The staff at the bar were excellent and it was great getting to know some of the people working at the hotel.  The king sized bed was so comfortable.  Free internet service in the room and business areas was a plus.  My overall experience of my trip to London was superb and I hope to be back one day in the near future.,5,2011,08,17
150,"Service was amazing, Location was fantastic. All round a top product.","Checking in was fantastic. Attentive, offering information and all with a smile on their face. Bags then taken to the room and a brief tour given of the amentities. 

We had lounge access and this was great. Breakfast and beers all included so perfect for a weekend treat away from the children. 

This hotel is a different class to other 5* and with Oxford Street on your door you cannot ask for more!",5,2011,08,17
150,Good business hotel in convenient location,"I stayed here for 8 days for business trip.  London is my favorite city, and I like the area of London that this hotel is in. Close to shopping, some museums (adore the Wallace Collection), and a few different tube stops.  The hotel itself is well-maintained and the front desk staff and concierge services were both good.  The room was serviceable, nothing remarkable.

The main criticism is that the hotel often hosts different trunk shows and other events that involve people loitering in the public spaces near the elevators on various floors.",4,2011,08,16
150,"Top End Hotel, Top End Service - Perfect Stay!","Stayed here on the weekend with a girl pal. On check in, even though our reservation said double, they offered a twin which was great since we're only friends and lastminute wouldn't let me select a twin room! The hotel is beautiful and very well located, just a block or so back from Oxford Street, on a quiet picturesque square. Check in is friendly and polite and very attentive.
When we returned from dinner out, there was a little chocolate mousse cake with Happy Birthday on it! It's the touches like these that make me come back. Room was spacious and spotlessly clean - thanks Hyatt! 
I would totally recommend this hotel if you are staying in London.
love, room 733 xxx",5,2011,08,16
150,Great Hotel. Great Service,Stayed here for four nights and was very satisfied. Staff was very prompt in responding to problems with the AC and otherwise very helpful. Room was clean and well-kept. Would stay here again.,5,2011,08,15
150,You made us so welcome and we love staying with you,"We have just returned from our second trip to the Churchill and the service, kindness and overall hospitality has been just as top notch as the time before. On the first visit the hotel made a very small error with our booking and has since gone to great lengths to make it up to us. They have done this to the point of our amazement and we are complete fans of this hotel and their kind and efficient management and staff. The rooms are excellent the food always fantastic - everything you would expect of a hotel at this level. However what we didn't expect was the genuine relaxed, helpful, friendly attitude of the staff and the fabulous atmosphere because of this. For a London west end and central hotel  - you couldn't ask for anything more. Thank you - we can't wait to come back again.",5,2011,08,08
150,Beautiful hotel in a quiet neighborhood near shopping,"This is truly a 5 star hotel with attentive staff and a great location. If you can find a great rate, you will be rewarding with comfortable accommodations, great food and an easy walk to the Tube.",5,2011,08,06
150,"Excellent service, room and the staff were great","The hotel was very busy upon check in and throughout our stay, but you would have never known it.  We were very impressed with the room and the staff at this hotel.  We will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2011,08,04
150,Not a friendly place,This hotel is in a good location but is not really near a tube station.  We found the staff to not be the most friendly.  The rooms were OK in size.  The workout room very small.  This was not what I would think a 5 Star hotel should be.,3,2011,07,29
150,Friendly efficient clean and comfortable,"My husband and I happened across this hotel after a dreadful night in another location local to the Regency. We booked walking off the street at 7am. The staff could not have been more helpful. All we needed was a double room for the night and ended up on floor 5 king bedded sizable room. 

Very comfortable bed, quite acceptable sized sparkling bathroom with a dead extractor fan!  The room was serviced whilst we were out for the evening most unexpected and appreciated.

Check in took a few minutes, check out no more than a minute. No issues with the lifts.  

A quick and easy, clean and comfortable stay in a good location for the west end a short cab ride from Paddington. ",5,2011,07,29
150,Classy,"Stayed here on sons 18th birthday the hotel team made it special for him a bottle of champagne birthday cake awaiting on our return from dinner in his room, lovely gesture ",5,2011,07,29
150,Pleasantly Surprised,"We stayed at the Churchill for four nights at the end of our two week holiday in the UK. When the taxi pulled up to the hotel the entrance was very busy, and the lobby a bit chaotic and crowded with people. 

Service was very good, when we were checking in the lady at the check in desk politely informed us that the club floor check in desk was busy and that she could check us in faster in the lobby. She was efficient and check in was indeed fast, which was appreciated when we saw that the 8th floor check in was busy. We'd booked a Regency Club room and the club floor had obviously been recently renovated. The room, while a standard hotel size room, was well done and efficiently laid out. The bathroom was on the small side but for London was aboslutely passable. Both the room and bathroom were spotless and even though we were at the front of the hotel couldn't hear any traffic or street noise.  

We were on the 8th floor, one of three club floors, also where the two lounges are located. We ate the continental breakfast three mornings, service was great and they put out a very nice selection of pastries, fruit, cereals etc., for us it was more than we would need to get ourselves going in the morning. We also enjoyed the evening drinks in the lounge, good selection of drinks and great snacks. The lounge staff did a great job of directing guests to the appropriate lounge, one was more family oriented (i.e. kids) and the other was much quieter with couples and business people.

Location wise the hotel could not have been better for us, Portman Square is within walking distance to Oxford Street and Marble Arch tube station. For shopping and sightseeing it was ideal. Wandering near the hotel (Seymour St) there were also a lot of really nice restaurants and pubs. 

Our one complaint would be the incredibly slow elevators, there are three elevators in the lobby serving the guest floors and inevitably one of the three seemed to always be out of order. This is saying something because even when all three were working we were waiting for a really long time to get downstairs. We chalked it up to them being old but something should really be done about it. 

We'd definitely stay at The Churchill again without hesitation.",4,2011,07,27
150,Excellent service and location,"Location in Mayfair is convenient to Hyde Park and Oxfrd Street shopping area. Hotel is pricey, but very clean and with very helpful staff, who will point out nearby attractions (e.g., Wallace Collection) and make reservations at recommended restaurants a short cab ride away. Accommodations were part of a Tauke Tour of London and Paris. Tour included excellent breakfast choices, which was a big plus since the hotel restaurant menu, apart from breakfast, is overpriced.",5,2011,07,12
150,London time saver,"Have stayed at this hotel before but this time for only three days. If you only have a short time in London this hotel makes an excellent base. It is two minutes walk to Oxford street and Selfridges and M& S, and easy walking to Regent Street. There are multiple bus routes and tube stations nearby for access Knightsbridge and the Theatres.
The hotel was very busy but management corrected some problems re room and equipment quickly and to my satisfaction. The only niggle is that with only three lifts and a full hotel the wait for a lift was longer than normal. However the time saving of the locality more than offset this. Another benefit is that the hotel is close to Paddington  Rail Station which makes the Paddington Express to Heathrow both a cost and time benefit",5,2011,07,05
150,"Once again, we had an incredible stay",The Hyatt Regency London - The Churchhill makes their guest feel like royalty whether they are or not. The concierge desk went beyond to help us spend 36 hours in London to see as much as possible. I highly recommend this hotel. One will not regret staying.,5,2011,07,04
150,Great choice in Marble Arch,"The hotel is only two blocks from superbusy Oxford street and walking distance from Picadilly Circus and pretty much all landmarks and big metro lines. This hotel is much-much better located than those situated on Park Lane, where there is NOTHING around. And the rate is not different. 

Rooms are big and luminous and the bed quite comfortable. 

Service was very attentive. As it normally happens with nice hotels in big metropolis, everywhere in the hotel is slightly crowded, but still service was efficient. 

The bad side: Elevators delay a lot and when they come, sometimes they are packed (only 3 elevators for a huge hotel). Spare sometime for that, since there are no stairs. The same with the check out, at 12 gets quite crowded and you'll find a long line that may keep you busy for around 20 minutes. Internet and breakfast are normally not included and check out is at 12 (not flexible, except paying the late check out. Internet access costed 51 BP per 3 days. 

All in all, the hotel is worth trying.",4,2011,07,04
150,An outstanding hotel in a good location,"We arrived late and were upgraded to a suite,a good start. The persons at the desk took time to show us our room and how to access the club room and what was available there. The building is old, but in excellent condition and seemed to be recently renovated in the club area. The room was spacious, with a balcony! The hotel was quiet, and the bed comfortable. The personnel at the desk were ready with good suggestions for sightseeing and how to get around town. The personnel were really attentive and helpful.",5,2011,06,30
150,Very average hotel at extraordinary rates,"I am a very very regular guest at Hyatt Hotels globally. The Churchill falls way below the average international standards (although I only stayed at Park Hyatts in the US, so I cannot really judge). The rooms are ok, decently sized for London standards, however, nothing special in terms of features and design. Cleanliness of the bathroom was so so - detergent stains on the toilet. 
The fitness club is a joke with substandard facilities. This is no fun.
The Club is quite nice with a decent breakfast.
Although the place is nothing to write home about in most ways, it certainly is when it comes to price. The rate was daylight robbery - 460 Pounds plus tax is outrageous, even though the city was very booked. If an average hotel takes advantage of its regular clients in this way, I tend to remember for the next time. Much rather go to the Andaz next.",3,2011,06,30
150,"Not only a great hotel, but amazing people too!!!","I love this hotel and have been several times, not only for the hotel's quality (BEST comfy beds!) and great bar & restaurant, but also for the fabulous location.

This last time, I actually left my jewelry bag full of all my favorite things in the hotel room, and didn't realize until I'd been gone a WEEK.  Unbelieveably, they not only had found it, but everything was still there - totally as I left it.

It's rare enough to fine a great hotel these days, but with friendly and honest staff?  That's one in a million!!!",5,2011,06,09
150,Top hotel in a great neighborhood,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. Top drawer staff and service. There was a mixup on check-in (our end, we think) and the front desk handled the matter professionally, with grace and generosity. The hotel's atmosphere was more British than American, which we loved, without a hint of stuffiness. It had a traditional, somewhat grand feel in the lobby. There seemed to have been some recent renovations. We're not sure if this included the artwork, but we enjoyed the contemporary art on the main floor and especially a really fun, more non-traditional exhibit of art pieces in a wing off the lobby. 

Our room overlooked Portman Square, so we looked out on lovely trees & the square. Even with street construction, there was no noise in the room. However, you can open the windows for fresh air. The standard room was ample in size - not huge, but perfectly comfortable and well designed, especially the bathroom and closets. 

If you are fortunate enough to enjoy a club room, the breakfasts and high teas provide abundant choice and fine food and the service is 5 star. We were treated to this perk just as the Hotel reopened this special feature;  we felt it was a luxury that made our stay incredibly special.  However, we would return to this hotel anytime because we know we'd have a guaranteed great hotel experience in a perfect locale.

We invited our London friends to the Churchill Bar, which is cosy and charming. Didn't get to dine in the hotel, though the dining room looked inviting. The hotel is situated in a very pleasant part of town with  surrounding neighborhoods wonderful for strolling, dining, and shopping and viewing some of the architecture that makes London distinctive. The hotel is close to Hyde Park and Regents Park, Mayfair, and Marylebone. We loved the fact that the hotel was not in a highly dense area, but accessible to the heart of London by foot or transit. Along with taxis,  two tube stations are quite close (Bond St. and Marble Arch) and many different bus lines are available just across the street from the hotel. 

Most important, it truly felt like everyone who worked at the Hyatt wanted to make the guests' experience memorable and of the highest quality. And this is what will bring us back.",5,2011,06,08
150,I loved it and I will be back,"I loved it and I will be back. well, I heard from my local friends in London that It was one of the best about 30 years ago. ...........I like this hotel and for sure I will tell my friends.",5,2011,06,08
150,"Perfect Hotel, Great Location","Location is great....5min to Oxford street....just across the park, so its has a lot of green as well....At the time I stayed there, there was a little construction going on, but it did not bother me at all...For VIP guests, they have separate floor for check in, so u dont have to wait a lot...the service was excellent, as well the breakfast in the morning....I always appreciate hotels who offer fresh orange juice in the morning.....Rooms were nice, but not big.....there was a cool bar downstairs, and they let us stay after hours.....overall, good hotel, good location...but you have to pay the price...which can be quite expensive...",4,2011,06,07
150,Superb-Simple as that!,"Just got back from a stay at the Hyatt Regency and the title of this review says it all. I booked a surprise trip to London for my fiancee's birthday and chose the Hyatt Regency after much deliberation. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the service was second to none. On check in the staff made us feel welcome and check in was swift even though the hotel was obviously busy with an important function. The red carpet was laid out when we arrived and although it was obvious it wasnt for us we couldnt resist but use the entrance! Any way, the rooms were imaculate and a good size, we were given a room overlooking portman square. The bed was very comfortable and had feather pillows. As we were only in london for 1 night we needed a good location, the Churchill was just that. A street away from Oxford street, 5 mins walk from Hyde Park and Park Lane, we couldnt have been better placed. On returning to our room we had an answer phone message from reception wishing us a pleasant stay which was a nice touch. We had drinks in the Churchill Bar which was great for couples or groups and we only wish we had the time to sample one of the restuarants. Breakfast had plenty of choice with pancakes, omlettes and fried eggs to order to your liking. The only negative I can find with this hotel is the hot buffet didnt have baked beans with breakfast (i think baked beans on a full english must be a northern thing)  We will definately be staying here again when we return to london! Thanks to the team at the Hyatt Regency.",5,2011,06,05
150,"Great, Great Service","Fine Hotel, good location.  Service was exceptional.  Friendly and helpful.  Well beyond expectations.",5,2011,06,03
150,Fabulous attention to detail,"We stayed here for a long weekend and booked one of the Regency suites.  The only disappointment was the slow internet speed but absolutely everything else was superb with perfect attention to detail!
Great location being a few minutes from Oxford Street.  Hyatt never disappoints :)",5,2011,06,02
150,Beautiful place to stay,"Very nice hotel, nice service, excellent room service :) loved it ;)  
highly recommended ;)",5,2011,06,02
150,Just what we needed!,"We had been staying at the Radisson Blu off of Oxford Street but had such a bad experience that we switched hotels to the Hyatt Churchill.

The Hyatt was sooooooo much better than the Radisson Blu and was in line with what we expected from a nice London hotel.

The location is great as it is located near Oxford Street yet a block back from Oxford Street on Portman Square (behind Selfridges). The hotel is located between the Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations on the Central (red) London Underground line as well as a near myriad of bus routes. The hotel is also an inexpensive taxi ride from Paddington train station if you arrive by the Heathrow Express.

Overall the hotel was high end, contemporary yet with a classic posh London feel and it had great restaurants & room service. The room/amenities were in line with what one would expect from a 5 star hotel and it was the perfect location to explore London. We would return in a heart beat!",5,2011,06,01
150,"Excellent Service, Not ideal location for tourists","This is a tough hotel to review. There is still construction going on so you may be awaken by it. We were told from 9 to 5 but the noise started at 750am. We were upgraded to a nice room on the 9th floor.

Here is my issue and something people should consider prior to staying here. Are you in London to shop or to tour places? This location is a shopping location. The sidewalks are packed with crowds. I felt like I was in NYC (and I'm not a big city fan). When you are outside you don't see any of the touristy things just buildings and crowds. Also the tube access is for the red (central) line which I don't find as convenient as the green/blue lines (district/piccadilly).

The staff and the room and the amenities were all very nice except for the typical expensive hotel's bad habit of wanting to taking more money from you with high fees for the internet or movies,etc.

 So if you want a nice hotel, some pampering, want to feel important and you plan to shop, this may be the place for you. If you want something more quiet and maybe easier access to tourist sites check out Kensington (we stayed at base2stay which suited our needs very well and didn't nickle and dime you).",4,2011,05,17
150,"Great location, really nice hotel and lovely staff","We stayed (husband and I) at The Churchill while in London to attend a birthday celebration.  Our room was nice - quiet (except for a baby screaming for an hour at 6am! - but that waasn't the hotel's fault!) and spotlessly clean.  AC worked well.  We had stayed at the hotel before, last summer, and our experience this time was about the same as before.  We were delighted with the hotel, the staff and the location. 

 Very unimpressed with the breakfast service, as before.  In fact if we stay there again we will pop aroundthe block to have breakfast at Prêt à Manger....  why?
As before, none of the dishes were well presented.  To slap two Eggs Benedict on a plate with no contrasting colour looks poor, I think.  in addition, when a waitress re-filled our cups with ordinary coffee (OK but not fantastic to boot!) she whisked away our bill and brought it back with a charge for two ADDITIONAL cups of coffee.  I pointed out to her that normally in most hotels the plain old coffee (as opposed to espresso) is not charged for by cup.  she insisted that this was the case at The Churchill...  but then went off to talk to a manager and came back saying that she ""had reduced the charge"".  Leaving me to think that she had done us a favour.  Yet the next day, we had two cups of the same coffee each - with no extra charge (as would be normal).  I think their breakfast service needs re-vamping and certainly more supervision...  But that is my only complaint and so I willgladly stay there again and have breakfast, as I said, around the corner...",4,2011,05,10
150,Service with a (genuine) smile.,"Stayed here for four nights mid-April 2011 -- yes, during the time when they were renovating. They had thoughtfully placed 'plastic barriers' over the windows so that you wouldn't 'see' the construction. Now, mind you, that *also* meant that your view outside was nil - still, you knew that going in, so it was really more of a benefit than a hindrance. 

The folk at check-in/registration were MORE than helpful. Normally folk at check-in do their duties and then 'pass you off' to the bell-hops. Since this was our first time here, the nice 'check-in' girl (from Lithuania?) came out and around from behind her desk, accompanied us to our room, so as to help us become 'familar' with their set-up. 

Even AFTER 'room-service' clean/prepare the room (mid-morning), they come around AGAIN, early in the evening, to 'settle' the bed (in case you've been lying on it watching TV) and to make sure, e.g. the bathroom looks respectable and the fridge is (still) full.  Net result is, after you've had dinner and are ready to go to sleep, the room is back to being spic-n-span. 

DO avail of the excellent safe that is inside the closet!

The breakfast selection is outstanding. You can have some cereal (yes, even Weetabix!), whilst they make you an omlette. The wait-staff are exceedingly vigilant when it comes to ""more coffee?"". You *must* try their absolutely superb and exceedingly FRESH orange juice!  OJ, as fresh as that, I have only ever tasted in Rome. 

We had booked a 'day trip' to Bath/Stonehenge (via Evan Evans) and the staff made several calls *to make sure* that the Evan Evans bus would pick us up (and be on time!)

The 'power' of the water nozzle, in the shower unit, reminded me of that Seinfeld episode where Kramer is beaten-back by the Commando-450. VERY REFRESHING! and definitely NOT 'low flow'.

The location of this hotel is, literally, a stone's throw from Oxford St. You can leave the hotel, and with a few minutes, find yourself, meandering around the shops and (walking further) the 'sights'. We walked to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, 'The London Eye', etc. without the NEED for a cab. If you walk down Baker St. you should really take time to visit the Sherlock Holmes museum (only 5 mins. away!)

Speaking of cabs -- put your trust in the REAL 'London Cabbie' -- do NOT give the 'pedi-cabs' so much as the time of day, never mind your money. 

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return.

150,Wonderful hotel with very friendly staff in top location,"It's always a good sign when you are greeted by the doorman and he holds the door open for you and takes your luggage before you even step foot in the hotel. 

Check in was a breeze and I was told to call and speak directly to Paolo if I needed anything. But that was not necessary. The room was a masculine type décor - quite dark colours and wooden. The bed was a king but it was the biggest king I'd ever seen. There was a variety of different pillows and the bedding was luxurious. The mini bar was so extensive, I could hardly fit a bottle of water in the fridge - it also stocked red wine and other goodies in a separate cabinet. The room itself was incredibly quiet. There was a small TV and a very good size bathroom. The hotel offers a turn down service and every one of the staff that I came across smiled and greeted me, even if I was just getting out of the elevator.

The hotel is in a great location one street back from the madness of Oxford Street so it offers some sanctuary while being quite close to the underground train station and all of the shops and cafes of the area.

Highly recommended.",5,2011,04,28
150,Flawless!,"Flawless in every aspect. I rarely designate any hotel or restaurant as five star but  this hotel was fabulous.
The staff was friendly, attentive and quite helpful. Room service was prompt and the hotel was clean with nice amenities. Its location is close to the subway system and nice shops.
As members of the Hyatt club, the breakfast was extensive.

My one minor complaint is the gym is rather scant but sufficient.

FYI: If you have any spare time, the town of Bath was delightful. We rented a car and visited Stonhenge and Bath.",5,2011,04,21
150,Disappointing,We paid quite a lot of money to stay in this hotel as it was fairly central and it was supposed to be a relaxing few days away. The location was amazing but everything else was very disappointing. There was noise in corridor every night for the three nights of our stay.  There were a few drunk people up and down the corridor outside our room on one particular night shouting and swearing and banging into doors and even though staff were called they were useless at solving the situation so it went on and on and on.  I think we must have been placed beside some sort of storage rooms as there were trolleys ratting in and out all morning from the crack of dawn. I got absolutely no sleep the whole time we were there. The staff weren't very friendly either. Was exhausted by the time I got home. Would have had a more relaxing stay at the local YMCA. This place is not worth the money and is definitely not five star. Far from it.,2,2011,04,21
150,Great surprise,Booked this hotel on lastminute.com as one of their Top Secret Hotel. My wife and I where spending weekend in London together with couple of friends. This hotel is for sure the best I have been staying at in London and the service from Erik and William was outstanding when we needed their help. I have spent time in more than 200 hotels around the world and this stay was for sure in my top 15.,5,2011,04,18
150,Lovely hotel in excellent location,"Thoroughly enjoyable stay. The staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful , breakfast was busy but the service was still excellent. Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. We'll certainly return!",5,2011,04,17
150,Very average outdated but clean room for the price you pay and for a hotel of Hyatt's reputation.,Room was quite average and needs updating. Very clean though and they did have excellent staff especially those at the buffet breakfast restaurent. The doormen were a tad choosy with how they treated guests going for appearances. Location was excellent.,3,2011,04,14
150,Room needs some TLC,"This hotel is in a great location, has a wonderful lobby and bar but the rooms were slightly dingy.  They are currently upgrading the ""select"" rooms.  But if you are booking a low cost room you will get a small flat-screen TV, a small bathroom, access to bottled water in the elevator area of your floor and nice sheets, bedding, towels and the usually good lotions and shampoos.  The room and furnishing were a bit worn and for 320 pounds/ night I expected much more.  The staff were friendly and helpful but the rooms were nothing special.",4,2011,04,10
150,"V well organised, professional, large hotel","I stayed at this hotel for one weekend a week ago and was impressed by its standard of service, cleanliness and general high level of organisation. This impressed itself upon me all the more due to its size. Over 440 rooms and the hotel was approaching full occupancy - a number you get to appreciate only at breakfast.
The rooms are standard in size and appearance, the staff friendly and attentive. It lacks the personal touch though, which is notable after we'd stayed in several boutique hotels. Little things like the staff remembering your name and addressing you by it, remembering your choices and preferences -- all understandably impossible in a hotel this size.
Next time we'd choose something a little smaller and more personal, but thats no reflection on the service here. if you can live with large hotels and crowded breakfast halls this is as professional and attentive a facility as you're likely to find.",4,2011,04,08
150,Very good hotel,"I normally stayed in the Horseguards Hotel but since it was fully booked I changed to the Hyatt Hotel at Portman Square. The hotel is further from the London office but close to oxford street and Soho.

I really enjoyed my stay here. Staff is really helpfull! The design is really nice (except the rooms - maybe they are nice as well, but not really my style - english style). One big plus is the nice bar they have!

I will definitely go back here when I am in London. Hopefully end of April!",4,2011,04,05

150,"A wonderful treat, will go back again.","My hubby and I stayed for one night at this hotel as a birthday treat - it couldn't have been better. The hotel has a beautiful interior - the lobby and restaurant are really plush and wonderful just to rest in. The staff are very helpful and accommodating to guest requests I noticed - I had booked online late the previous evening and had requested a nice view,  when we checked in a lovely lady got us a very nice room with a view while we had a delicious lunch in the Montagu. We found our room to be spotlessly clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated, with a lovely clean bathroom. Our room had a flat screen TV, writing desk and two chairs, ipod docking station, business phone, and comfy chair & footstall; it was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. I checked out the hotel gym and Sauna - all new equipment and clean. There is a tennis court in the square which guests can use - looks very pleasant. When we came back from the birthday dinner, we found a delicious birthday cake and bottle of bubbly had been put in the room  - a lovely touch, my hubby was so chuffed, and the cake was yummy. The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment on one floor currently, but I hardly noticed it (except for very brief drilling noise). All in all, 9/10. It was a wonderful treat, and we will be coming back for another treat and to sample more the the Montagu and a rather fabulous raspberry vodka cocktail at the Churchill bar!",5,2011,04,03
150,EXCELLENT LOCATION,Stayed there for 1 night. Excellent location- walking distance to Oxford Street and Marble Arch. Very good breakfast . Some of the biggest rooms I have seen in london. Bathrooms could be better though.,5,2011,04,03
150,right location and friendly staff,"Just one of the great parts of this Hotel is location less than 5 mins from Marble Arch underground station and 5 mins from Oxford Street (walking!!). We actually walked to the west end for a show through Soho took about 25ish mins if you take off my wife’s window shopping all the way. Staff were great and their eye for detail was excellent it felt like they knew us, everyone asked how are stay was going with what felt like genuine interest. We would go back again. ah yes view of the square is nice too",5,2011,03,31
150,Everything I hoped for - and more,"This was our first visit to The Churchill, although we've had many weekend breaks in London.

We chose this hotel because of its 5-star rating, and also its ideal location, being within easy walking distance of the West End theatres and the main shopping areas, but we could also take a lovely stroll through Hyde Park and onwards to Portobello Road and Notting Hill.

The excellence of the staff was immediately obvious from the moment our taxi arrived.  We were greeted by the doormen; escorted to reception and quickly checked in by an extremely pleasant and efficient reception clerk.  The highly professional standard was maintained throughout our 3-night stay and never faltered.

Our room was spacious, well equipped with modern fittings, warm and very comfortable.  We had no need to ask for anything, although staff were discreetly available at all times to attend to whatever we might have wanted.

At breakfast there was a wide choice of hot and/or cold food, all delicious and freshly prepared, and, of course, staff were always checking to ensure we had everything we could have wished for.

This was by far the best hotel we have ever used in London and we will most definitely be back.  

Thank you everyone at The Churchill!",5,2011,03,30
150,Hyatt is my favourite hotel chain,Very nice and centrally located hotel with extremely helpful and nice staff.,5,2011,03,24
150,Exceeded expectations,Got a great rate on last minute for 150GPB which was certainly a bargain for this hotel. Very impressed with staff - they checked me in at 9am after my early morning arrival from Oz despite me not having arranged early check in. Hotel interior is tasteful and bar/dining area nice atmosphere. Meals were very reasonably priced. Great location close to Oxford St. Was a bit hesitant about staying here due to some bad reviews on trip advisor but glad I did stay. Room was small but comfortable and I had a view of a brick wall but aside from that had a really nice bathroom and was in a quiet part of hotel. Rowing maching in gym needs replacing. All in all would definitely stay here again if my budget allowed.,5,2011,03,18
150,My favorite hotel in the world,"Second stay at this hotel and love it, service is always over the top, clean rooms, great location, and best part it's not a large hotel.   Staff booked me a weekend trip to the netherlands, they went above and beyond to make this happen since it was for the same day.",5,2011,03,15
150,The hotel is excellent,"This was my 6th stay at that hotel and it still surprises me with its excellent service and accommodation. The staff is very efficient and polite, the rooms are very modern and comfortable. Besides the hotel is located in a Central but very quiet area.
I definitely recommend it.

150,"Shopping, slumber and amazing breakfast","It has just about the best location for West End shopping, transport and open space. It's one of the best high-end hotels in London. Just a street away from the throb of retail therapy outlets. We had an amazingly relaxing stay. Slept like logs, on fluffy pillows. As quiet as the country with not even the buzz of traffic. 
The staff here are as good as you will find in any 5-star hotel. Engaging and polite. Breakfast is worth waiting all night for. A great hot buffet but you can order from the extensive breakfast menu as well. The Continental cold section offered an array of meats and cheeses, breads and sweet pastries and juices.
This hotel was full and lots of those visitors we spoke to were regulars. There is plenty of choice in London so any hotel that can garner such a faithful following is doing something right.
Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2011,03,07
150,"Truly"" A Poor Excuse"" of a 5 star Hotel","If was not for poor service, slow service, non responsive service this hotel would provide no service at all. The location is good. Rooms are small, but the bathroom is by far the worse I have experienced in many years. I am not a fan of showers in the bathtub, but in this hotel(all rooms) they use a handheld shower head that is positioned in such a way that you can not take a decent shower. The ceiling in the bathrooms is very low and even for an average height person, you feel very crampted. The design of the shower is such that it has onbly a partial glass partition with 50% open, and so not only are you cold from air coming in, but also allows water to go everywhere creating a real mess. Staff is non responsive. Clearly this is not a corporate owned facility....and Hyatt should take responsibility to recitfy their shortcomings",1,2011,03,04
150,HELLISH beds!....and watch those bar bills......,"Had two nights here and I can safely say that my partner and I both had shocking nights' ""sleep"".  My Other Half can be a bit of an insomniac, but the problem was that although the beds were large, if one of you so much as twitched, on one side, the vibration carried right through the bed.  I suspect that although large, they are cheap in that they do not have the pocket springs that one needs to stop the vibrations pinging straight through the mattress.  Sheer hell, 0 hours sleep on 2nd night for other half and ensuing arguments! Otherwise the rooms are what one should expect for an exorbitant central London hotel - ie. pretty good, although the TV was smallish and rather fiddly and the bathroom was tight - usual shower-in-bath that you don't have to put up with in Asian 5 star hotels for the same price and a glass screen that cleverly directed the water all over the floor if you weren't careful.  Nicely done in general though.  Unpleasant problem at checkout for other half - I had signed a tab the night before for about GBP15 and left early in the morning.  He was presented with one for GBP55 at check out and had no way of calling me although he was pretty sure it was wrong.  He argued and argued with them and got it taken off - I have NO idea how they managed to try and sting me for the extra GBP40 - but TRY to sting me they did!  I would NOT go back to this hotel based on the beds even though the staff seemed nice and it was all OK really.",3,2011,02,14
150,"Excellent Service, Great location","My family and I booked this hotel (and air)last minute on www.britishairways.com, upon arrival we were told that the package didn't  include breakfast as was noted online - however the staff behind the desk advised us that it will be included.

The staff at the hotel are polite, courteous and knowledgeable - in fact, with their assistance we were able to map out all the places of interest we wanted to visit.

We absolutely recommend this hotel - it is located on a quiet street and  2 minutes walk from a major shopping area, patio restaurant, buses, trains and within walking distance to many of London's tourist attractions.

Room was comfortable & very clean, breakfast was decilious with lots to choose from! Be sure to ask front desk/check out the 'club level' area floor..

Thank you all for making our stay a memorabe one.",5,2011,02,13
150,Adequate but nothing special,Average four star hotel posing as five star.  Rooms and public areas adequate but nothing to write home about.  Staff were efficient and polite but distinctly unmotivated.  Whilst there is nothing to complain about there are much more inspiring hotels for an enjoyable stay where you feel you are actually getting something for the over-inflated charges on everything.,3,2011,02,07
150,It's a nice hotel - but by Hyatt Standards it's terrible.  It's also not worth the price,"I usually stay at a Hyatt brand hotel when I travel (if the city has a Hyatt I will always stay there).  

I love the Hyatt chain.  One thing I like about them is how they are consistently of high quality.

The Hyatt Regency London (the Churchill) however does not deserve the Hyatt name.

Sure, as a hotel if you're not staying there it's great.  The lobby area is really nice, there is a very nice restaurant and bar.  It really is a grand hotel in that regard.

However, in terms of staying there as a guest it's quite lacking.  One thing that annoyed me was the fact internet was not included in the high cost of the rooms.  There has only been one other Hyatt where this is the case (Grand Hyatt Erawan in Bangkok - but they make up for it with their excellent customer service and other things).  The price charged for internet was ridiculous (if I remember right it was 15 pounds for 24 hours).  And then when you for out the cash the internet is slow! 

The rooms themselves I can't otherwise fault - they are clean and the furniture and bed is up to Hyatt Standard.  But the bathroom is terribly cramped, and the shower heads are terrible.  The fact I don't have further criticism of the rooms does not redeem this hotel since this is to be expected for such a high price.  

The customer service isn't terrible, but it isn't great either.  Check in was fine, they did stuff up my room and gave me a twin instead of a king - and they fixed it after a bit of a delay.  And to their credit they did give me a free upgrade to the next class of room (the hotel was a ghost town anyway and I am a regular Hyatt guest).  However when I checked out it was another story..  The guy that checked me out wasn't very friendly at all, and when I complained about the internet (in a tactful and civil way - mentioning that it is one of the only Hyatts without free internet) he didn't even acknowledge it - he just ignored me.

Usually at a Hyatt hotel when you call any department they use your name.  This was not the case here.  I know it's a minor point, but I think it illustrates the attitude of this hotel and its staff - they think they're doing you a favor by letting you stay there.  There is no sense of customer service...",2,2011,02,06
150,Well located,My room had been recently renovated which was great and it overlooked the park.  The Churchill is very well located near Oxford Street.  It is also near the Central and Jubilee Tube lines making it easy to see all the sights in London.  It's a quick taxi ride to Paddington Express or the City.    The only negative is that they charge for WIFI and at a ridiculous rate.,4,2011,02,05
150,Nice,"Stayed over the xmas period here and was very impressed. Free upgrade to better room and the staff even checked us in at 8am in the morning which was well appreciated after a long haul flight.

No sound issues in the room compared to other posts on here but may have been just our location.

Staff very friendly and even Santa left a stocking in our room (and other guests we presume) on Xmas Eve which we thought was a lovely thing to by management - oopps, I mean Santa (wink, wink)

Lastly location is excellent an deasy to get to anywhere in London from here.",5,2011,02,03
150,"Good Hyatt Regency, enjoyed my stay","I stayed here twice. I really liked the hotel. The location is good and within walking distance of the underground. The Hyatt Regency club is very nice, but can be crowded. The rooms are of a typical Hyatt Regency standard and very good for London standards. Good Hyatt diamond recognition. Will definitely return.",5,2011,02,01
150,Leaves a lot to be desired,"I travel very often for business which, unfortunately, means that I stay in a lot of hotels.  Here is my feedback about the Hyatt (The Churchill) from my two-night stay starting on January 28, 2011.

1. Room selection - Don't take a room below the 4th floor because anything below is basically at street level in full view.

2. Noise - The cleaning staff let the room doors automatically slam shut so don't expect to sleep in.

3. Concierge - I have stayed at this Hyatt a few times and they suggest the same old places, especially for restaurants.  Don't ask for any new places or any happening spots.  Even if they had a name, they can't get you in.

4. Breakfast - They are understaffed so service can take a while and the staff gets miserable the later you go.

5. Laundry - It is ridiculously expensive and the hotel is inflexible on timing.  I called at 10am on Saturday to get gym shorts and a t-shirt washed and was told they wouldn't be returned until around 7:30pm on Sunday.

6. Gym and business center - They are small and very basic.

7. Shower - It is a narrow tub so it is uncomfortable and tight to stand in.  It also has a half door so it is hard to stop the water from spewing on to the floor.  Last, the water was lukewarm on Sunday morning.

8. Internet access - It is very expensive.

There are a lot of better choices in London.",2,2011,01,31
150,“Fabulous Hotel impeccable service”,"Fabulous hotel 100% five star wonderful service — awesome location. We were in London just for one night for my birthday and the staff were very attentive, polite very helpful and made me feel special, a truly gorgeous weekend. The rooms were excellent, good size and spotlessly clean, but most of all the hotel is in a great location. If you have access to the Hyatt Club you will be treated to a full free bar and gourmet food. There is nothing I can fault and will certainly be back and recommend.",5,2011,01,30
150,Quality Hotel with warm friendly feeling,"Our most recent stay was on New Years Eve, and once again we were impressed with the friendliness and efficiency of the staff, and the quality of the accommodation and the food and service. This Hotel is in an excellent location being close to West End Shopping, but in a quiet square away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2011,01,26
150,"Great hotel, wonderful location!","Nice hotel—great service—awesome location. We were in London just for one night, on our way to the US. The hotel staff was attentive and polite and very helpful. The rooms were nice and of a decent size, but most of all the hotel is located in a great location. If you have access to the Hyatt Club you will be treated to a full free bar (pretty rare in the US Hyatts) and gourmet food. PS if you are there (and you like Indian/Pakistani cuisine) go to Zayna, which is just few blocks away and is a great restaurant.",4,2011,01,25
150,AMAZING- LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!,"I stayed at this hotel on two different occassions, and loved both stays. They ungraded my room on the last visit- free of charge! members of staff always friendly, and very sweet. The rooms are fantastic and so is the hard powered showers! i wanted to stay in rather then going out my friends had to drag me out! had drinks in the bar and smoked a cigar outside - very hollywood! hehe, awwww cant wait to go back! love it very modern and very clean! seriously defo worth the money! its like my second home! very close to oxford street, literally a two min walk and two min walk to marble arch tube station!

if i was nitpicking id say get some free hotel parking places and free wifi! then this hotel will be new residence forever",5,2011,01,18
150,Great hotel shame about the concierge,"Stayed here for 3 nights and it felt so good to be in a real 5 star hotel.  The doormen are sweet and attentive the lobby is always nicely busy (not crowded) and the inhouse restaurant adjacent to the lobby gives the whole entrance area a nice feel. The location is central in Portman Square (just behind Marble Arch) so close to Oxford Street and almost next door to Selfridges.  The hotel has a very decent gym (5 techno gym treadmills) free weights and complimentary towels, mineral water and fresh fruit.  The room are quite tight spaces but well appointed and the beds are all queen/ King so decent enough for a basic stay. Decor and style is classic with a modern touch. DVD player was available in the Regency room. The Club floor (or Regency as they call it) is recommended since it comes with breakfast (good continental selection) and high tea (lots of fresh salmon and other tit bits). There was a fairly large arab clientele when we were there just as an observation. The only slightly off aspect we experienced was the Concierges gruff tone when asked if it might be possible to get a very early (6.30pm) dinner reservation in the famous Italian restaurant Locanda Locatelli: 'nah...nah..you gotta book that one months in advance...at least 2 months...alright?' Not true since of the 6 or so times we have dined there we only called ahead 2 times and that was because we were in a group. No offer of help to find an alternative either as many concierge would normally do.  But it may just have been the time of year (end December) or the guy we spoke to..  All in all we are looking forward to staying here again soon!",4,2011,01,14
150,The Churchill - VERY nice!,"We were very well cared for by the staff, from the prompt delivery and collection of our luggage to currency exchange.  It was delightful!",5,2011,01,14
150,Fabulous Location for Shoppers!,"Stayed at The Churchill over Thanksgiving with my teen daughters.   Perfect location for shoppers and tourists alike.   Convenient to Marble Arch tube station and several bus lines.   Quick walk to Marks and Spencers, Selfridges and the rest of Oxford Street shopping.    Hotel is off main streets - across from a small park, so nice and quiet!!!   Spend the extra money for a Regency club level room....lounge is fantastic!   Staff at hotel was outstanding!",5,2010,12,30
150,Problem with sound proof rooms!,"Noise in rooms is a big let down... You can literAlly hear every door on the floor opening and closing.. Shame, hotel has potential to be great!",3,2010,12,27
150,Fantastic hotel. Almost faultless.,"Really fabulous hotel. Wonderful service, glorious public rooms and excellent bedrooms. V comfortable beds. There is almost nothing I can fault. Will certainly be back and recommend. ",5,2010,12,23
150,Grand hotel in an unbelievable location,"I stayed in Hyatt Regency Churchill for a week when I traveled for work in my London office, which was also in Portman Square. Chose this hotel as we did not want to lose time in commute. It turned out to be quite a grand experience. The hotel looks slightly ancient with creaking floor boards in the corridors. But the grandeur is still there, the lobby with its great looking fire-place, the landings in each floor with small figurines of Churchill himself, the spacious rooms and so on. The hotel is extremely well located - a short walk from Marble Arch and the shopping paradise of Oxford Street. Room service was good, especially since they had a few vegetarian dishes. Breakfast was out of the world. WiFi internet was in the package for me and it was good. Complimentary bottled water was not there in the room which I thought was odd.
The cost is steep (300+ GBP) by most global business traveler standards and the largely arab / middle eastern family crowd as an ambiance at business breakfasts takes some getting used  to. All in all, if location is not a constraint, I would probably have chosen a hotel reasonably priced, less than 50 year old and equally good (there are at least a 100 of them in London).",4,2010,12,19
150,Don't bother,"I booked this hotel blind as a top secret hotel via lastminute.com. When I checked in at reception I was asked for a credit card which I had forgotten to bring with me. This led to the receptionist making an under breath comment to her colleague about 'the sort of people' that book via the external website. The impression I was given was that my kind were not welcome. The room was pleasant enough, nothing special, and definitely not a 5 star. Breakfast was outrageously expensive and again not worth it. They didn't appear to believe that my booking included breakfast on the first morning of my stay. 
It is in a very central location near the Primark end of Oxford street.
It is an acceptable hotel but you could find much better for a lower price too.",3,2010,12,13
150,Pleasant enough but not impressive,"We stayed 3 nights and the rooms were just as nice as the airport  Holiday Inn in Bremen we had stayed in the night before. The concierge service was cheery and very helpful, reception cool and professional but the hotel bar staff was slow and surly.  

The most troublesome part of the stay was the other guests.  The first night our neighbor slammed the door to her room, screamed obscenities, either threw something or fell and then presumably passed out.  The next night we were awakened by party-goers coming ""home"" and slamming doors, next morning the staff had cleaned up the vomit in the hallway and were drying the carpet.  The last night we met a lady of the evening visiting a customer two doors down and later that night we heard her noisy departure (screaming, slamming and running). 

Seems to me this hotel is great for graduation parties and bad boy sons of sheiks but not for nice people looking for a nice hotel, Not impressive but nice enough.",3,2010,12,01
150,Not if you are a solo female traveller,"I was in London in October 2010 for a business trip and stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and stayed in a room on the 6th floor. The hotel itself is pleasant enough, but what I was very uncomfortable about was that (1) you didn't need a key / security card to access guest floors via the lifts (2) The room door did not have a safety latch/chain and (3) In the room I was staying in, the privacy knob (the 'double lock') was stuck and not working. 

I suppose if you are a six foot two rugby player, this isn't a problem. But I think solo female travellers might find these aspects of the hotel's security somewhat concerning. This is a real shame because this is a pretty nice hotel.",3,2010,11,23
150,"Beautiful, safe, clean, superb neighborhood - expensive","Stayed here this summer during a leisure trip to London. I was very happy overall. I thik this is one of the nicest hotels in London and the neighborhood is superb. Walking around at night feels safe - and there are few areas that are classier in London than this. Close to Tube, restaurants, pubs, supermarket, Oxford Street. GREAT concierge lounge, one of the best I have seen. We moved from the Marriott Grosvenor House and this is much better.  Some issues with billing that got tedious, but service was professional, although a bit cool.  Rooms are big by London standards.  See if you can get a deal because you will pay dearly for this place.",4,2010,11,17
150,Heart of the city - no value for money paid,I stayed at The Hyatt on a recent visit to London. I stayed there for 3 nights and paid a price of GBP 535 per night on the first 2 night and then  lower on the 3 rd night. Paying an amount of GBP 535 I felt really uncomfortable as the breakfast served was unacceptable and certainly not as per the Hyatt standards worldwide. The rooms are neat but again no value for money. I was very disappointed.,2,2010,11,09
150,Fabulous,"I had read a number of negative reviews about this hotel and needed to say that our experience was fabulous.

We booked the room at a an excellent rate through late rooms secret rooms so we were unaware that we were staying at the hotel until the booking was confirmed. 

From checkin with Paolo to checkout everything was brilliant. The best sleep we have ever experienced in any hotel anywhere in the world.   The only tip for travellers staying at this hotel would be to request a park facing room if you are particlar about your room view. Otherwise just wonderful service.",5,2010,11,01
150,Disappointing - There's far better in London for less £'s,"We managed to get a good deal on Hyatt Regency (The Churchill) and really looked forward to a bit of luxury while visiting London. The attentiveness and friendliness of the staff are unquestionable, and the location is fantastic great, being only 2 mins walk from Oxford Street & Marcle Arch Tube. Sadly the hotel itself looks a bit tired and the rooms are nothing special.

Our original room was an ""adjoining"" bedroom at the end of a corridor and we could hear next doors television very easily. Whenever their doorbell was pressed it rang in our room - so we headed straight back to reception for a change of room. Initially we were told the hotel was full and there was not a lot they could do about it. I stood my ground and eventually in order for a quiet room, we were downgraded from a Kingsize room to a standard Queen - without any refund. Not what I expected considering our booking was made well in advance.

Being a regular London traveller, I know there's better to be had and I don't see myself hurrying back to the Hyatt Regency (The Churchill) in the near future.

From a 5* I expected something special and left feeling somewhat disappointed. There are hotels offering comparable, even better, rooms & ammenities for a fraction of the cost in London.",3,2010,11,01
150,A great hotel to indulge yourself!,"This is a pricy and posh hotel just a few blocks from Marble Arch and Bond St Station.  The service is AMAZING.  The staff are all friendly, full of smiles and helpful.  I asked about printing my boarding passes since I did not want to pay to use the business center and Gareth said he would do it on his PC for me! That's service!

The rooms are large, especially for UK/European standards.  The beds, linens, and pillows are so comfortable you will not want to get out of bed in the morning.  Soaps, gels, and shampoos in the bath will have you soaking the afternoon away (as in my case after a long flight).  I skipped the in house bar and restaurant in favour or the many offerings on Oxford Street.

If you want to indulge yourself - this is the place to do it!",5,2010,10,31
150,Thank You!,Due to a medical emergency our trip to London had to be cancelled.  The Hyatt Regency London was wonderfully supportive and unburocratic.  Elegant and understated as always - I love the Hyatt.,5,2010,10,31
150,Never Again!,"Stayed two nights before a cruise using Hyatt points.  Definitely not worth the high number of points required for this property; good for burning Hyatt points.   Have traveled the world from budget to executive; added this hotel to my not very long list of properties I will never stay in again!  Former top tier in Hyatt, SPh & Hilton.  Current top tier in Marriott.

Customer service a joke.

Nice location (but try Marriott Marble arch for almost as good location in same area).",1,2010,10,30
150,Amazing Hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel this week for my boyfriends birthday.  It was booked through lastminute.com at a competitive rate for the standard of hotel and after reading some of the reviews on this website I was slightly anxious about whether it would meet my expectations but I didn't need to worry at all, it exceeded them!  Upon check in they asked whether it was a special occassion and when they found out it was for a birthday we were upgraded to a King Club room giving us access to the club lounge serving complimentary drinks, nibbles and breakfast.  It didn't stop there either, we were getting ready and a bottle of champagne was delivered to the room!  It's in a great location, the staff are extremely friendly, it's clean and elegant, I would definitely recomend this hotel.",5,2010,10,28
150,One of the best hotels in London,"This is one of the best hotels in London, big comfortable rooms, excellent food, perfect location......quite expensive though!",5,2010,10,27
150,Falling behind,"I have used the Churchill, on and off, for over 10 years. After a gap of 18 months and having used other London hotels in the interim I sadly come to the conclusion that the Churchill no longer rates 5 stars. Whilst the service remains largely good and the public areas are good it falls down on the basics - the room. We took a King Club on the 8th overlooking Portman Square. My first impression was how small it was. However, by far the worst aspect was the ease with which we could hear neighbouring rooms at night - they weren't partying just talking rather loudly. Mentioned at checkout, staff were aware of the problem and claimed a major refurb was scheduled over the next 12 months - it certainly needs it.
Finally, as an aside, too many of the staff speak only broken and barely understandable English - having left a phone charger subsequent calls to retreive were painful and we gave up.

This was once a very good 5 star - by standing still it has fallen a long way behind other London 5 stars and, with some sadness, I can't recommend it.",3,2010,10,20
150,Unspectacular,"While I found nothing hugely terrible about this hotel, there is nothing that special about it either and I will probably choose to stay somewhere else on my next visit to London.  Paper-thin walls are one of the main reasons that I would not choose to return - I was awoken, for example, by my neighbours' wake up calls.  They also don't appear to understand the concept of pre-registration - I booked an extra night in order to ensure room availability for my early arrival, but upon arriving at 7am discovered that they had me as a 'no-show' from the day before and had cancelled my booking (although thankfully they were able to find me a room - it could have been a lot worse!)  Furthermore, they do not allow you to book a late checkout until the day of departure.  

In addition to the above, I was not a fan of the restaurant (overcrowded and uncomfortable), the shower (very weak), the lifts (slow), the cleaners knocking on my door three times in one afternoon in defiance of the 'privacy' sign, and the lack of complimentary water in the room.  None of these things in itself is that bad, but added up they did affect the quality of the experience and do put me off returning.  Having said all that, the hotel is in a great location in central London and would be fine for a very short stay.",3,2010,10,17
150,Milking your wallet dry,"Stayed here for just over a week on business. Booked through lastminute.com so got a cheaper rate of roughly GBP 200 per night. I understand they charge customers booking directly with them GBP 350 for the same rooms.

The hotel itself is ideally located in Central London, short walk to Oxford Street, Edgeware Road and Park Lane. The hotel is well presented, the staff were mostly friendly enough and the rooms were of a good standard. On that basis, it's a nice place to be, just some minor niggles like requesting a newspaper every morning and not receiving it once despite several complaints. Also, housekeeping starting their rounds before 9am is something I'm not used to.

The main complaint however, just ruined the stay for me altogether. If you're paying a lot of money to stay in a prestigious hotel, you don't expect to be treated like a Ryanair customer and be charged far too much for every little extra.

Internet access is GBP 15 per day. Over GBP 100 for the week. That is ridiculous. I asked if it was possible to buy week long access instead of being charged every 24 hours, all they offered to do was ""sell"" me 7 vouchers for GBP 10 each. Having to haggle for reasonable internet access in a 5 star hotel is not what I'd expect.

Almost every hotel I've ever stayed in which is 4 star and above gives you at least 1, usually 2, complimentary small bottles of water in your room each day. Not the Hyatt Regency Churchill, they charge you a whopping GBP 4 per small bottle. They also think nothing of charging GBP 27 for breakfast, and believe me, it's certainly not worth anything near that. Go to Patisserie Valerie round the corner, and save yourself GBP 20 and have a far superior breakfast at the same time.

The icing on the cake for me was when they charged me £75 for a phonecall that lasted 5:22 minutes. Obviously, calling an international number from a hotel phone is always going to be expensive, but GBP 15 per minute blew my mind.

It's a shame, what would and should have been a pleasant stay ended up with me leaving with a very bad taste in my mouth.",3,2010,10,03
150,What a great hotel right at the Oxford Street,"The hotel is conveniently located just 1 minute away from lively Oxford Street with all its shops. The rooms are very nice and so is the service. The prices are good if you take the location and luxury of this hotel into account. Next time I am gonna spend time in London, I'll be there again for sure.",5,2010,09,27
150,Noticable Missteps,"I stayed here for 5 nights on a recent vacation. The hotel is in a great location and seemed pretty recently updated (lobby decor, room furnishings). However, there were some major issues with our stay and, given the price, I would not reccomend or return.

1) They charged 30 pounds for wifi in your room. Given the exchange rate, that was $45USD/day. That is an insane price for wi-fi, even at a ""luxury"" hotel. 

2) Beware of the concierge's suggested restaurants. We asked for a reservation one night and were sent to a place where the concierge was clearly getting some sort of kick-back. We were sent to an italian restuarant that served mediocre food and was patroned by only retirement-aged american couples (all clearly sent by assorted hotels....)

3) The service/food at the Montague (hotel restaurant) was awful). Overpriced ""pretty food"" that had no flavor and service that was horrendous. 

I would not return to this hotel or recommend it.",2,2010,09,22
150,Caution Bed Bugs,I stayed at the hotel (club king room) with my daughter in August 2010. We could not sleep the whole night because of bites of bed bugs. I think for such a price and number of stars it is quite disgusting and appalling.,2,2010,09,21
150,Big problems with security and many little issues regarding cleanliness and maintenance!,"This was the 3rd or 4th time I have stayed in this hotel, and it will definitely be the last. In September, a relative and I booked two rooms (club level, which includes the very good breakfast buffet in the morning), and all went well for two nights. On the third day, I requested that some minor maintenance work be done on a window, and left for the day. When I returned that evening, the room door was standing open. The maintenance work had been done, but the repairman had left the door open - anyone could have walked right in and stolen anything from my room! Fortunately, as far as I could ascertain, nothing was gone. I immediately called security and was told they would send someone right up to my room. After 20 minutes, no one had arrived (and we had a social engagement  in 45 mintues).  I called again, and was told they were checking the film of the hotel corridor, and would call me back. After another 30 minutes (I had in the meantime cancelled the engagement and my credit card account), I called security again and was told that the film showed that only the repairman had been in the room for a few minutes, and no-one else before or since. 

It is absolutely unforgivable that a room door be left open, and I was also very unhappy that I had to repeatedly call the security people, even though I had been told they would send someone up to my room.  To be on the safe side, I requested that they provide me with a written documentation of the proceedings (just in case anything had been stolen and I would have had to contact my insurance company), but was told that this could only be provided by the hotel's attornies. (By now, it was evening, and I had a flight to catch the next morning.)       

Another problem is that the club level breakfast area was not clean. I was in there for at least one hour on three separate mornings, and observed that the tables were not wiped down after each customer; instead, only the placemats, utensils and settings  were replaced. This meant that the tables and floor were sticky and grimy. The same sticky rings from the juice glasses were on our table every morning. Very unfortunate, since the quality of the food is very good, with a wide variety of fresh items that are continually refilled. 

Also, in one of our rooms, there were used coffee cups left by the previous guest, as was a small pitcher of milk in the minibar. Nor did the water kettle work, which was immediately replaced by housekeeping with a second water kettle which also did not work.     

The rooms were otherwise clean, although the phones in the bathrooms were not correctly fastened to the wall so that the entire phone would fall off of the wall when you picked up the receiver. 

In any case, I will not be returning to this hotel, nor can I recommend it.",2,2010,09,11
150,Not The Usual Hyatt Experience,"We stayed at the Hyatt Churchill  at the Concierge level because of our loyalty to the Hyatt chain.  This was our first stay at the Hyatt in London. We were greeted plesantly and promptly assigned a room.  When we entered the room it was in very shabby condition (very soiled carpets and tired condition).  Even the bellhop commented that the room was shabby.  We were taken to a second room and found that unacceptable, as it overlooked a roof..  After waiting for several hours, we were finally escorted to another room which was a huge improvement, however, nothing special (very stark white wall, carpeting still not very clean and a bland decor).

I did complete a comment card and was emailed by the manager with an apology regarding the condition of the carpeting and room.  I would think that housekeeping would be aware of the conditions and convey this to management.

The bonus of the concierge floor is a huge benefit; lovely continental breakfast which is serviced by very attentive staff.  Every evening from 6-8 p.m., cocktails an heavy appetizers are served in abundance.  Tea service, coffee, soft drinks, snacks, fruit are available during the day.

I have stayed a much nicer hotels in London for much less.  However, the location is fabulous..",3,2010,09,08
150,Good business hotel,"A good hotel for business travelers with large rooms and good amenities - all the standards you would expect from a Hyatt hotel. Love that they have a plus for 110v appliances which is very useful for travelers from North America! The location is ideal near Selfridges, Bond Street tube station and Oxford St. Minor quibbles with the bathtub/shower which I found a little confusing, and the fact the business center does not appear to have enough terminals for the people who need to use it.",4,2010,09,03
150,"Fab Hotel, Fab weekend","Having read a few other comments I thought I'd give my opinion. 

We booked through lastminute.com and their Top Secret Hotel's, after a bit of digging around before booking I managed to discover the identity of ""elegant, deluxe 5-star hotel in west end - 5* - london"". We paid extra to include the breakfast and evening meal, and we were very pleasantly surprised with the value we got from this!

We stayed 2 nights and for the duration of our stay found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The restaurant were very accommodating of our post theatre dinner which was pushing them close to their closing time.

The food we had as part of our package was great and the half board option offered superb value. The breakfast offered good choice and was great quality. Dinner was good, however I would suggest serving the food on hot plates as my wife's poussin was a little cold. The chocolate fondant was the best we've ever had.

We were very happy with our room, not the largest but everything you need and a great bed! I slept very well both nights.

All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,08,30
150,Top quality hotel,"There's no denying it - its not cheap. But you get what you pay for. 

This is a really well located, modern, clean, luxury hotel with high service levels. The rooms are spacious and well appointed as you would expect. I didnt eat in the attached restaurant but the Churchill bar is very comfortable to wind down in with a late night cocktail.

The big win for the hotel for me was the location itself and if you can get a deal on the room rate like we did when booking late then its one I'd recommend without hesitation.",4,2010,08,30
150,"Great staff, great hotel - a bit overpriced but this is Central London!","Stayed 2 nights in connecting rooms on the 6th floor. Staff very welcoming and made unloading car, and parking car in the basement very easy! Check in staff really friendly towards children (which was a really pleasant surprise!) Bags brought to room quite promptly - unfortunately, they had forgotten to put in the fold up beds in both rooms (a fault which when pointed out, they fixed in 20 minutes!) Plenty of room for all of us rooms really clean, and bathroom great.  
Breakfast was OK - plenty of choice, children enjoyed the hot pancakes! The chef's were probably the grumpiest people alive alive - and failed to keep the hot food replaced and topped up as it was used. Not desperately keen on cheese being left out all morning unrefridgerated, and was quite warm by the time we had our food. AND the biggest fault - an inability to make a great cup of tea in a London hotel - not good! Would have liked higher quality for £20 per head. We only had breakfast there so cant comment on other meals.
Booked a children's film - which only played half of the movie - complained asked for help - promised no one turned up.
Check out very smooth - tried to charge for mini-bar we had not used - but no hassle.
REALLY ENJOYED OUR STAY THOUGH - WOULD RECOMMEND, THE SLIGHT PROBLEMS WE HAD WERE NOTHING STAFF HAPPY TO DEAL WITH.",4,2010,08,14
150,Pretty good (as usual),"Stayed here before on 2 occasions and everything was pretty much as before (very good overall).

Location is excellent, near Oxford Street, Marble Arch and Hyde Park but far enough away to be nice and quiet.

Rooms are very nice, but very expensive, hence low value for money mark. We stayed during the period when Wimbledon Tennis was on which is why the price was steep I guess.

Service in the Churchill Bar was patchy, but overall service is excellent.",4,2010,08,02
150,overpriced,location was great but look elsewhere if your expecting value for money,3,2010,07,23
150,Good location and service - Staff sometimes clueless,"As part of a tour of London and Paris, we stayed at the Hyatt in London. I am a Platinum member and the hotel is very typical of a Hyatt in terms of the furnishings, style, etc. They go for a more modern and sleek style. This works well in Jersey City, NJ or even in New York City, but I'm not sure it fit in with London. I would have liked to have seen a lot more style fitting with that great city in the hotel.
The room was almost exactly like the hotels I stay at in the US, but definitely smaller...the bathroom as well. Everything was absolutely spotless and the cleaning staff was amazing. They had a wonderful turn-down service. Our room was completely cleaned twice daily and I loved it. They were also very generous with toiletries and towels, which I also liked. With the turn-down service, they would leave bottles of water and fruit regularly. It was a nice touch. The bed, unfortunately, nearly broke my back. It was way too soft. They need to change out the mattressess. We also got free Internet service because of my Platinum membership. I believe they do charge otherwise.
We also had access to the lounge, which provided a light breakfast, snacks, cold drinks (including alcohol), and hot beverages. I negotiated that with the staff when I agreed to be downgraded from a club room to a regular room. It was definitely worth it.
Also included with our room was the breakfast buffet. If you order the buffet, you can also order off the menu. The portions from the menu are EXPENSIVE and SMALL. I ordered pancakes and got one small pancake for 7 Euros. The buffet itself was good, but didn't change day-to-day. It was the same items every single day, so being able to order off the menu was a good thing.
We had a few small bumps with the staff: They tried to take away our lounge access after making the original deal to agree to a downgrade. I had to go back and forth with one of the staff members at the front desk, but she finally relented. Also, we were part of a tour with our breakfasts included. Even though we told them every day that we weren't to be charged for the breakfasts, they  continued to do so and even told us at one point that we weren't part of the tour. They finally got it straightened out on the last day, although the first two days of breakfasts still appeared on our bill. They corrected it upon checkout.
Overall, very nice hotel, in keeping with Hyatt standards. Great service in terms of keeping the rooms spotless. A few minor bumps with the staff. We'd stay here again!",4,2010,07,17
150,convenient,"We only stayed one night as we had to get on a cruise the following morning.  We had a guide and driver take us for a  5 hr tour (blue badge) excellent.  The hotel is well situated, quiet park across the street.  We had a room for the three of us (my husband and a teenage son), the best was the club floor.  The food was excellentin the club room, the club room is small but very nice and very comfortable and the breakfast and snacks in the evening were great.  Rooms are standard like in America, which is a very big deal in London.  Thanks",4,2010,07,13
150,staff put me off staying!!,"Me and partner had some free time from kids so treated me to afternoon tea here, the tea and the staff resturant were nice, understaffed and not attentive enough but all the same they were all very polite. When we arrived we went to the concierge to ask where the afternoon tea was, I found him to be abrupt and rude and looked us up and down in such a manner as if he had never seen a mixed race couple in his life, and all this is coming from the man who looks like he can just about read a book! After tea we were considering staying BUT to avoid the rack rates was going to book via internet from our mobiles but wanted to get car out of their car park  first, this time there was another man on concierge whom sadly was no better than the first, again he was abrupt, made little eye contact and sopke to my partner as if he was an idiot as my partner is italian and has a strong accent, but surely he must come across different accents all the time, and we stay in hotels a lot and no one has ever reacted in such a way. After this rudeness a second time we decided to keep our hard earned money to ourselves and not line the pockets of a so called 5* hotel with clearly 1* staff! 

HR need to take their staff to The Waldorf or The Arch where the staff truly are of 5* quality",2,2010,07,10
150,Wonderful location and very nice hotel,"We spent two nights at the Churchill.  Our purpose in visiting London was to see friends and to shop and it was well located for both.

Although it is a chain hotel - Hyatt - it has a distinct identity and is very attractive.  The staff are wonderful.  When we checked in I asked for a quiet room.  Our room was perfect.  We had a view across roof tops - we were on the 6th floor - and the room was spacious, well equipped and very quiet. 

We didn't eat any meals in the hotel except for breakfast.  But we did have tea one day, and drinks a couple of times in the bar.  The service was excellent.  When we ordered tea we asked for tea sandwiches.  A plate arrived with tiny, but really tiny ones.  For £9 I thought this was a bit off!  But a manager came over to us and told us that he thought there were not enough sandwiches on the plate and would get some more!!  We did not ask for this, but were very happy to have a second serving.  That showed to me that he noticed what was going on and took action!

My one criticsm of the hotel is the way the breakfasts are presented.  We did not want a large buffet breakfast and opted on one morning for Eggs Benedict and on the second for a Bagel with smoked salmon.  The Eggs B arrived.  All that was on the plate were the two muffins, the eggs and the sauce.  No garnish.  it looked a bt naked!  (It tasted great though!¨)  When my Bagel arrived the next day there was just a Bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese.  No lemon, no red onions and no capers.  I have never, ever seen just the Bagel without these last three items - and I have travelled all over the world and eaten this breakfast on all six continents!!  I asked for red onions, capres and lemon.  The waiter brought a lemon, some chopped white onions (which I declined) and some huge capres which I had to cut into slices!!   Just a little effort to make sure that things look nice on the plate at breakfast would go a long way.  A French couple next to us ordered two fried eggs.  They came - just two fried eggs, alone on the plate!!  No parsely, no little slice of orange to add colour.   I must stress though that the food tasted wonderful!  And the prices were totally correct.  £10.50 for Eggs Benedict in Central London - or anywhere else for that matter - IS more than corect!!

In sum - we were delighted to stay at The Churchill and would like to stay there again the next time we visit London.  Their staff - from Doormen and porters to Front Desk and all other personnel we met - were very very good!",5,2010,07,08
150,"Cozy, comfortable and central","Stayed here for two nights in April 2010 and had a lovely time. The hotel's decor is quite simple yet classic. Very upscale and central location near everything. Beds were comfortable and I slept really well. Worth it only if you can get a decent rate; I booked for an absurdly low price, but I've seen rooms go for about $600-700, which would be totally over-priced.",4,2010,07,07
150,Good Base from which to Explore London,"This hotel exceeded my expectations and was a very functional home for our quick tour of London.  

Rooms:  As with any big city hotel the rooms are small.  There were three of us staying in a King room and it was tight.  However, we knew this and could have spent the money on a suite if this was of particular concern. We weren't in the room much so it really didn't matter.  The room was well appointed with a desk, two chairs, and sufficient drawers/hanging space.  The bathroom was acceptable as well.  Nothing over the top here but most functional indeed.

Location:  The location is very good.  It is about three blocks from Hyde Park and a tube station.  The neighborhood has a great feel and there are many pubs/restaurants within easy walking distance.  We felt very safe walking around the neighborhood, even after dark.

Service:  While we weren't there very long (2 nights) and did not require a great deal of help, each employee with whom we dealt was professional, polite, and competent.  The check in attendant (I forget her name but she is from Italy) was extremely polite and welcoming.  The concierge was very efficient and knowing.  All-in-all a very well trained, professional staff.  

Physical Facility:  The hotel is large, and there are alot of folks in the lobby and using the facilities.  There is a bit of a wait for a lift and generally a small line for the concierge.  Essentially, the facility is a bit better than one would expect from a big city Hyatt.  All in all the property is most acceptable and clean.

Bottom line is that we would stay here again if we were to visit London under similar circumstances.  The hotel does nothing ""great"" but does everything well, as a Hyatt strives to do.  One would not be disappointed with a stay at this hotel.",4,2010,07,01
150,Expensive and stay spoiled by non-smoking room smelling of smoke,"We stayed here for 4 nights while attending a business meeting. The doormen and check-in staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room was fine (very corporate) and basically comfortable. Someone else above has mentioned the strange electrical wiring which means the lights are only controllable from one side of the bed. This was annoying but did not bother us too much. The bathroom was very small and it annoyed me that the towels were changed daily even though we meticulously folded them and put them back on the rack as we did not want them changed every day. The breakfast buffet was very good but the staff not very attentive and it took several attempts every day to even ask them to bring coffee.

The concierge was very helpful as was the lady at the entertainment desk who helped us make a show booking.

The big disappointment at this hotel however was that despite having a non smoking room, it literally stank of stale cigarette smoke. This was particularly noticeable in the bathroom and so we had to keep the bathroom door closed most of the time. We presumed the smell was coming through the centilation system. Unfortunately, when we arrived at the room the first time, the bathroom door was closed and we did not notice the smell and so did not mention it to the doorman who brought us to the room. However, we told reception about it the next day and they sent some maintenance staff with some machines which stayed in the bathroom all day. However, there was no follow-up after this and the problem was as bad as ever. We called again at reception and it was suggested we could move room if we wanted but we would have to pack up our things. To be honest, we were in the middle of a long trip and had a reasonable amount of luggage and we were busy all day with meetings. We weren't able to pack up at this time and so eventually persevered with the room but just didn't spend much time in it. 

As 185 pounds per night, this hotel was not cheap and so our experience was disappointing. At check-out we learnt that a very short phone call cost us 7.50 pounds and we were charged for things we had not had but not charged for others that we had. It all seemed a little random. We mentioned again the problem of the smoke smell but no discount was offered.

Location however is excellent.",3,2010,06,30
150,"Nice Stay, London is Great, Staff needs work","Stayed on the club floor, really nice hotel, close to everything (tube, shopping, buses, sites, restaurants, etc).  Club floor was ok - not much variety day to day in terms of snacks / food offered - club room staff was attentive.

Was disappointed with concierge and door staff - coming in with luggage - 3 doorman outside and not one held the door - had the door held once the whole trip (not that I am lazy but it  is something I expect from a 5 star especially when my hands are full).  Concierge seemed to know less than I did about sites to visit and this was my first visit to London.  

Overall - London is a great city and we had a great time there!!!!",3,2010,06,29
150,"Dreadful value for money, and does not deliver on luxury","We're just back from a weekend at this property, and were all disappointed.  The hotel has 5 stars, which are awarded by facilities as well as standards.   

It's a pity that the standards left us very much dismayed at what we expected from what we paid - $700 a night is a lot of cash, and should buy an exceptional standard.

One room has a so called 'single King' which seemed to be a double bed  - never heard of such a thing,  as it was a small bed.  The room was really small too.  

Overall, the rooms are comfortable, if small,  but nothing really exceptional.  The air conditioning was just about OK, as London had a mini heatwave at the time.  Service was good generally, but way out of the league of many high class hotels that I've stayed at.  Compared to Intercontinentals it just didn't get close.    The beds were acceptable, just nothing memorable and really comfortable,  the space limitations were noticeable always,  and some staff didn't make you really feel welcomed, which is what I expect.  Possibly a lazy management team in place, who need to rethink their approach.  

It was annoying to have to call room service to get ice, which was needed as the place was so hot.  The gymasium was poorly equipped, it basically had running machines and a few free weights, when I expected to see machinery for body workouts, such as for chest presses etc.  This was quite a shock, as many basic hotel gyms have these.

The area is safe, and there's a private fenced garden in front of the hotel,  but traffic noise can be an issue, as it's close to Oxford St, which is excessively busy.  Some residents may allow you to enter the garden area, but it's kept locked and is a private area.  Inside is nothing special, but it is pleasant to sit with trees around etc, whilst you're in the middle of a major city.
 .
Overall, if you want a touch of luxury, this is perhaps not the place to come.  I feel that the hotel has had it too easy,  relying on its name/brand and location, but it is about time that expensive London hotels delivered a reasonable quality of experience, for what they charged.    I don't like leaving a place where I've had high expectations and found them not met, but I really did here, and I'd encourage others to ensure that if they want something exceptional that they look elsewhere.  I've given this a 'no frills' rating, as it's a no frills delivery of an upmarket hotel service.",2,2010,06,28
150,A safe choice in a fantastic location.,"Positives:
1. Excellent location. Oxford Street is just 3-4 minutes away, along with Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations. 
2. The inside is beautiful - elegant, modern and  classy. The public areas are of typical five star quality and spotlessly clean.
3. The rooms are very modern - nothing particularly special - but clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are beautiful and the flat screen TVs are a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms have robes and plenty of big towels. There is an over-priced mini bar and expensive room service available. The in-room temperature control and air-conditioning worked well and is very quiet. 
4. The service is excellent. House-keeping were absolutely fantastic - extremely thorough and very friendly. They cleaned at the time I requested and did a brilliant job.

The negatives:
1. The walls are PAPER THIN -  as others have commented, you can easily hear the people in the next door room, along with their TV. 
2. In-room internet is charged at a crazy £15 per day.
3. The hotel is very ugly from the outside, if that kind of thing bothers you.
4. Like many hotels, The Churchill places a security hold on your credit card at check-in. This is £100 per night - a little steep if you are staying a while.

Overall, this is a great hotel. The room rates are a little steep but the quality of the rooms and public areas is excellent.",4,2010,06,16
150,Great location,"The hotel is right by Oxford Street and near Marks & Spencer and Selfridge.  So the shopping was excellent.  It is near the central tube line and there are numerous buses around the area that can take you all over town. 

The front desk/check in were friendly.  Concierge was ok.

However, I was not pleased with the 2 false fire alarms that occurred during my stay on the same day.  The first alarm was at midnight, then second alarm at 9AM.  I felt bad for the people in their bath robes standing in the streets.",4,2010,05,23
150,FANTASTIC,"We stayed at the Churchill Hyatt Regency for my birthday the staff are so friendly and nothing was to much trouble , the rooms were excellent they very well cleaned there was always fresh towels and toiletries ,the house keeping ladies always had a smile and a good morning for you , the food was excellent i would certainly stay here again it was the best .",5,2010,05,18
150,Excellent Location and Service!,Great location just right around the corner from Hyde Park and the Hard Rock Cafe London.  Excellent service and outstanding room accommodations.  You will not be sorry at this hotel!,5,2010,05,05
150,Old Victorian Hotel,"At about 280 sterlings per night, even bearing in mind that London is an expensive place, I had thought that the hotel would be comparable to the Hyatt Regency in Singapore.  Sadly it was not the case. 

The rooms are standard and the bathroom had a dank and musty look and smell.  Come to think about it, even the corridors to the rooms were dank and musty.  There is an air of staleness that seems to permeate the whole corridor (I was staying on the 7th floor).

The company booked the hotel as it was close to our meeting points.  The hotel was quite close to Oxford street and we had dinner at a good French restaurant there recommended by the conceirge.

The hotel is touted as a 5-star establishment that charges 5-star rates.  Comparing to the other Hyatts, it is a rather poor cousin. Other than the location, I will choose another hotel the next time I'm in London.",2,2010,04,26
150,taken advanatage of,i echo one of the other reviewers. stayed here during cancellations. move from intercontinental park lane which unfort became full after i checked out. this hyatt was £421 per nite for executive room (pity those in std rooms). room was dirty/curtains didnt close to block out light/u can hear traffic from street even though i was on 9th flloor being top floor/ maint had to fix the bath/ desk in room was scratched and carpet and curtains dirty. bill had to be amended as they tried to overcharge by several hundred pounds - they freely agreed to amend but why was it even necessary for me to query the bill. why anyone would stay here instead of claridges or the intercontinental is beyond me esp if u are a businessman needing a good nites sleep. at best this is a 4star hotel,2,2010,04,22
150,Not worth the money,"Have to stay here as all flights cancelled. £300 for the night for a very standard room and receptionist was not a nice person, they want £15 for WiFi!! Close to Oxford St if you want that i suppose.

Rooms nothing special, nothing else special about the place",2,2010,04,15
150,Very Nice stay,"I had previously stayed at the Churchill several years ago when it was owned by the Intercon.  I did not have a pleasant  stay then and vowed to stay away from this hotel .  At the urging of a colleague,  I gave it another shot and I was surprised by the changes.  The hotel has gone through a renovation and the floors and rooms are much nicer.  I had a room on the  4th floor overlooking Portman Square. The room was the standard size, but was fine for my 6 day stay.  My room had a king, with a LCD flat panel tv.  I also liked the ipod clock on the desk which I used when I did work in the evenings in my room.  Internet is available but at an extra cost and business center in the lobby area is not complimentary.   I used the workout room on the 2nd floor every day and it had very nice treadmills & ellipticals that were Ipod friendly.   The workout room was moderately sized though. The staff was very pleasant and nice.  The hotel is located in a very central area near the Marble Arch and Oxford street.  The 3 Tuns is a nice pub located very near the hotel.",4,2010,04,07
150,Traditional hotel with wheelchair accessible bath & doors.,"One of our sons uses a wheelchair so it was critical to find a hotel with accessible features.    We reserved a wheelchair accessible room and a regular room with a connecting door.  The ""handicapped room"" has adequate grab bars, push-button opening doors and a roll-in shower with a flip-down shower seat.  Unfortunately, the hand held shower wets much of the tile floor despite our efforts to contain the water (Poor drain design)..  The wall mounted bathroom sink is too low and there is no counter space.  There is a large glass window (partially obsured) between the bedroom and bathroom.  This is good if you need to keep an eye on a child in the bathroom but  not good if the user wants privacy.  The beds were comfortable but they took up most of the room.  There was very little room left to move around or store stuff.  The doors to the bathroom and the connecting room were large but they overwhelmed the rest of the space.  They did not fold flat against the walls and were always ""in the way"".  
The staff was very helpful and attentive.  The bellmen were excellent at helping to load my son (in his chair) into taxicabs.  A maintenance man helped repair a missing bolt on the chair.  Another brought us a large voltage converter & adapter for some of our medical equipment when the plugs in the room proved inadequate.",4,2010,04,05
150,"Great value, highly pleasant stay","Stayed here in Feb. 2009 and again in March 2010 and both times had a very pleasant stay, one of the best in several hotels I have stayed in in London. It is located minutes from Marble Arch tube station and easy to reach even with luggage. 
The room looked out over Postman Square and was comfortable, spotless and a fair size for London. The bathroom is only big enough for use by one person at a time and even then a bit on the small side, but otherwise fine. As with the room, the bathroom was spotless. 
Breakfast was very good - both times I went for the a la carte menu - although a tad expensive, but entirely similar in price to comparable hotels in London.
Cannot recall the previous stay but this time I received two complimentary bottles of water - one sparkling, one still - each day. For a 5-star hotel that is to be expected.
Internet was free this time but was probably due to my Gold Passport level.
Service throughout - checkin and checkout, room service and at breakfast - was seamless, efficient and very friendly, yet never intrusive.
I appreciated the regular noon checkout, as 11.00 am as is observed at most hotels is just a bit too early.
My next stay in London will undoubtedly bring me back to the Hyatt Regency Churchill.",5,2010,03,31
150,Okay but not really worth it even at bargain prices,"This hotel was marked down for the paper thin walls which meant we got a terrible sleep - doors banging all night and noisy neighbours - clientele not as 5 star as the hotel
Did not get asked whether we had had a good stay or if anything else we needed so marked down the service for that
Room had 2 single beds pushed together which was fine for us as friends but would have annoyed me if i was with my husband - also no free water in room, no bin in room and heating very noisy",3,2010,03,31
150,Lovely Traditional Atmosphere and a Good Night's Sleep.,"I was very recently charged with entertaining a group of delegates form the far east for a whole 5 days. I chose the Hyatt Regency due to the competitive pricing for the standard of accommodation and from previous good experiences in the branches elsewhere in the UK and abroad (family holidays included). 
The layout is a great mix of modern facilities and a traditional English/British decor, which the delegates loved. The restaurant food is of a high standard and the a la carte menu was always a hit across the group.
The rooms (particularly mine) are large, well equipped and the beds are a dream to sleep on. I very rarely feel rested when staying in hotels but the noise is excellently reduced considering how central in London you are.
The concierge service were always on hand to arrange transport, and assist the guests in whatever way possible, they made my time so much easier.
All in  all, a big thumbs-up to the hotel as a whole, I did not have or hear of one complaint the whole time of our stay, although im only going to give the hotel 4 stars because sadly thats what it is, good all round, certainly not world class.",4,2010,03,25
150,Closed for Business,"The Business Center was closed for three days, taking the meaning out of the word ""business."" If you unplug your room phone, the front desk will blast on your TV to tell you that you have a phone message. When a couple is in the hotel together, the front desk will call them ""Sir,"" not very gallantly.... To the Churchill's credit, the rooms have more light than most, and the thermostat works well. The location is good.",2,2010,03,21
150,Good to great,"its a good hotel, very nice and luxury. Great breakfast, but a little bit far from main subway stations. I can't understand how a hotel with this price can afford for wi-fi connection.",4,2010,03,18
150,Nice service during busy N.Y. Eve Holiday,"Picked this hotel for it's great location right off Oxford St. and only a few blocks from a tube stop.  The hotel was very crowded during our 4 night stay due to the New Years Eve holiday, but the staff still performed very well.  Next time I would like to stay when it's not so busy, but the fact that I would go back is a good sign.

Our flight from S.A. arrived early so we weren't expecting our room to be ready.  To our surprise they had a room for us.  It was kind of small so they offered to move us to a larger room once one was available.  The best part was they allowed us to keep the smaller room until it was ready.

If you can, book club level as the club serves great cocktails/wine as well as snacks.  It is a small club, so seating is sometimes an issue but the staff works to make it a nice experience.  Although there are a number of restaurants in the area, the restaurant in the lobby with the open kitchen was delicious with excellent service.

If you can get a good rate, this hotel is worth it based simply on the fact that it is only a block away from Selfridges.",4,2010,03,17
150,"Older style, very 'British' hotel, great location.","I stayed at this hotel for business. It was a pleasant stay, with the highlight being the great location, close to Oxford St, Hyde Park and in the centre of a grand beautiful part of London. Breakfast buffet was very good, and the bar was warm and cosy. I stayed in a twin room on 7th floor, overlooking the Square which was a lovely outlook. The room was quite nice (very standard hotel decor) although the bathroom was small, with shower over the bath. Parts of the room were showing age, such as facing coming off the bath base.  The only other criticism is the aircon was very loud, but was required to cool the overheated room to an acceptable sleeping temp. Very thick duvets on the bed seemed unnecessary and made for an uncomfortably hot sleep. It was quiet, and the reception staff were generally very helpful.",4,2010,03,15
150,would go back,"We stayed at the hotel for an occasion and before we arrived i had emailed them to say this asking for a late checkout/early check in.
This was offered and we were to to arrive when ever and we could check out at 5pm.

The room was lovely, over looked the park. Large room and was clean. The bed was very very comfortable too!
The bathroom was quite small and a little tired looking compared to the room and the rest of the hotel which was immaculate.

We went to a local spa for the day and upon return we found a bottle of champagne, chocolates and a card in the room from the general manager wishing us a happy anniversary which was lovely and very unexpected.
This really made us feel even more happy to have been staying there.
 
The only problem was that the following morning i had woken up with a bad stomach and was not at all well. We stayed in the room and was in no rush to leave but at 5 to 2 we had a call from the front desk saying we must leave by 2pm or pay 1/2 to evening rate. My husband explained we had an email confirming we could check out at 5pm but they insisted we leave.
I had to shower and pack with 5 minutes and having spent the morning in the bathroom i felt very sick. The receptionist was very rude when we checked out too.

Apart from that we had  a great time, but if they make an offer they should warrant it. Had i not been ill it wouldn't have been a problem and we would have checked out sooner but that was not the case.",4,2010,03,14
150,Excellent top end hotel near Oxford Street,"I stayed here for two complementary nights (thanks to Hyatt's generous loyalty programme) and was very impressed. The staff are extremely attentive and are well worthy of the 5 star tag.

The rooms are luxurious and the location of the hotel is also excellent (just a few minutes walk away from Marble Arch tube station).",5,2010,03,10
150,Great centrally located Hotel,"We stayed for 4 days during February in The Churchill. Purpose of the trip was sightseeing. Location was A+, vey close to Oxford Street and the tube. Since we traveled with our 9 yeard old son, we booked a Suite and it was really worth it. Suite was large and spottless with modern interior. Nothing ""special"" but solid and clean. Service was great. Eveybody was extremly helpful and friendly. Only ""minor"" downside of the hotel: the Regency Club is a little bit on the smaler side. Therefore it can get quit busy during the morning and evening rush-hour. Food, drink and service at the Regency Club was awesome.",4,2010,03,06
150,The service; the rooms and location are terrific,We stayed at this hotel before the rennovations and they have done a wonderful job. We were staying there for a couple of nights to celebrate a birthday. They upgraded us to the Regency floor as they considered us VIP's. I wish I knew what we did to deserve this. The staff was excellent and the service superb as always with Hyatt's. It is close to the Marble Arch tube stop. The beds were great and the romms very clean.,5,2010,02,25
150,Oasis of luxury next to Oxford Street,"Got a good rate on a ""top secret"" deal although we knew where we would be staying (good old Google!).
 This hotel is deserving of it's 5 star status - very understated luxury but just what you need after a London ""day"". Staff were friendly and efficient and made us feel welcome.
Room service great as there is no ""cover charge"" of £5 per order so we ordered drinks and ice to our room without hesitation. 
The bathrooms were small but had all that you needed. The twice daily housekeeping kept everything tidy - even your tossed piles of clothes were folded and placed on the bed.
Close to many good shops, cafes and restaurants although the hotel's  bars and restaurants seemed  good (we felt the need to dress smartly for the hotel's bar and restaurant, but there was no dress code mentioned in any hotel literature).
We had a problem with noise from the adjacent room one night and a call to reception solved this problem without fuss. Exactly what you pay for in a 5 Star hotel.
Great location, staff, beds, room-service,decor and price!",5,2010,02,20
150,A Great Birthday Present!,"My husband and I celebrated our birthdays here at the end of a 2 month trip around the UK and Europe.  Our stay got off to a great start with the very friendly reception staff who arranged for an early check in and, noticing that it was my husband's birthday on his passport, upgraded us!   The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had everything you would expect at a high quality.  We also had a great experience of the reception staff later in the evening, who recommended an excellent Indian restaurant around the corner from the hotel where we had a fantastic meal.  We will definitely be returning!",5,2010,02,19
150,Great location,"The Churchill was a lovely hotel in a great location. Ate in The Montagu restaurant one night and that was great value and superb food.
Check in was a bit of a nightmare..my husband had told the front desk I would be arriving but they still wanted photo ID...funnily enough I live in the UK and don't carry my passport with me and I had come straight from work.....but after a bit of question asking  by a very surly young lady I managed to get my room key!!
Doormen were great always making sure you could get a taxi.
All in all a good stay.",4,2010,02,12
150,Above and beyond,"I live in Spain with my wife and had to return to London for a few days. As it was our anniversary, I booked a night in the Churchill as a surprise for my wife.
The hotel staff were extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay a special one.
We were upgraded to a room with a nice view of the park, and the manager sent us a gift of chocolates and drinks with a personally signed card, wishing us well.
As well as this the cleaning staff were also happy and friendly which is a nice change to London's impersonal atmosphere.
When we enquired about tickets to shows, the concierge was super helpful and made us feel as valued guests.
The room itself was lovely and clean with possibly the most comfortable bed ever! All in all it was a fantastic stay and I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2010,02,10
150,Great Hyatt Service and Location,"I was a bit sick when I checked in and the receptionist, Mariam, was very helpful and sincerely concerned, great service! Room, location, facilities were excellent but unfortunately no pool and their Churchill Bar was a bit quiet. Oxford street is just around the corner, excellent place. Overall, adored it!",5,2010,02,10
150,Very Good Option in London,"I have had a long relationship with the Churchill, starting with the formerly Intercontinental and the early days under the Hyatt franchise a few years ago. At that time the hotel was not in a good shape and I had committed myself not to return. 

Upon completion of the renovation performed a few years ago, I decided to give a second chance and since then have used primarily this hotel when staying in London. The staff is very friendly and efficient, especially at the Club lounge, as well as the concierge has been very helpful and able to make some tough arrangements. View to Portman Square is also attractive but it comes with certain price since most of the rooms at that side of the building are connecting rooms that are very prone to be more noisy - not from outside but rather from inside. The connecting doors are not insulate enough hence in case you are noise sensitive you might have some issues.  Other than that, rooms are spacious for London standards and very clean. 

I cannot opine much on dinning because I have not use much the restaurants other than the Club that serves a very good breakfast and happy hour - worthwhile booking a rate with access to the Club in case you are not a Gold Passport Diamond member - complementary access in this case. 

Location is very convenient since it is very close to Oxford Street shopping area - in particular to Selfridges - but not at the mist of the busy district. Also it is very close to the Mayfair and the Hyde Park and easily connected to Knightsbridge and Soho. 

In short, a very good option for staying in London, properly priced, well located and with a friendly and consistent high quality service.",4,2010,02,09
150,Beautiful hotel and experience. I can't wait to return!,"This was a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location; just a block away from the great shopping of Oxford Street and a 3 minute walk to Marble Arch tube station.

I arrived at 9am to simply check in and drop off my bags. I was surprised and happy to be told that my room was already ready and that I had been upgraded to a room with a view of Portman Square.

The staff were friendly, polite and helpful and made the stay enjoyable.

The hotel looks to have been renovated recently and is very tastefully decorated. The rooms and bathrooms were nice and the iPod dock for your music was a nice touch.

I can't wait to return!",5,2010,02,07
150,Great Hotel - would like to go back!,Stayed here the night before leaving for Paris. St Pancras is about 5 minutes away in a taxi. Very good location. Clean rooms and helpful staff. Breakfast was AMAZING! very enjoyable stay. Would recommend and would love to stay there again.,5,2010,02,01
150,Classy,"The hotel location was perfect for our needs and we were allocated a room on the 4th floor. We stayed at a time of high occupancy and were quoted £330 plus tax for a King room.
The room was nice but I was more impressed with the recently refurbished bathroom. 
I was surprised at the poor TV reception and even more surprised that there was no complimentary mineral water in the room.
We paid an eye watering £55 for 2 breakfasts and my wife pointed out that her cumberland sausage cost around £7 per bite. Fruit juices are freshly squeezed, not from concentrate.
I would stay again but not unless I can secure a better rate.",4,2010,01,28
150,"Excellent Location, one of my favourite in London","Nicely located n Portman square, walking distance from the shopping area, the Hyde park, edgeware road, and park lane.

Rooms are clean and elegant, the beds are very comfortable (not the pillows). Beautiful lobby, didn't have breakfast thought.

The rate i paid was too high, but then again, London is expensive. 

One thing i hate, for the rate you pay, there isn't even  a complimentary bottle of water in the room. And it needs to be replenished daily. 

A truly favourite in London, probablly one of the top 10.",5,2010,01,28
150,Top Class Hotel,"We have just returned after spending 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  We got an excellent top secret deal off the web, were you knew the star rating of the hotel and the area of London but not the actual hotel name until you actually pay.  We were very please therefore after paying £240 for 2 nights that we were staying at this hotel.

From the second you walk through the door you know you are in a high class hotel, checking was very quick (less than 4 minutes) and as I had emailed the Concierge a few weeks earlier asking for some recommended restaurants telling him I was bringing my wife for a suprise, when we checked in they asked my wife was she looking forward to her suprise stay.  This was followed up 10 minutes after we arrived in our room with a bottle of bubbly, chocs and fresh fruit - this was on top of us getting a free upgrade - now that is what I call service.

The room was overlooking the park and despite being at the front of the hotel you never heard a thing.  The room was your typical 5 star room with the usual amenities and an ultra comfortable bed.

The hotel is within 5 mins stroll from Marble Arch tube and you very close the main shopping area.

We did not eat in the hotel but we did have a few drinks, both in the restuarant area and in the Chuchills bar were they had a lady playing the piano and singing.  What I would say is it is very expensive to eat and drink at this hotel - breakfast is £25 pp, afternoon tea is £22 pp and a bottle of red wine is anything from £40+  But then again you are in London.

The staff are very attentive without being too much in your face, for instance when in the lift 2 hotel staff got in and they asked if we were enjoying our stay and was there anything they could do - and they were not just saying this it came over very sincere.
Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel for a short break or business trip.",5,2010,01,24
150,Great hotel not a cheap bar,"The hotel is in a great location for the shops an the underground. The room me and my wife had was facing the park with a busy road which we did not hear. The room was excelant with the bed turned down when we got back after an night out. The only down side was the cost of drinks in the bar, I could have bought the same wine at a wine merchants, that is a bottle, for half the price I paid for a glass and still had change. I could not complain to much as I did not pay for the room as I had it as a reward from Hyatt Club.",4,2010,01,15
150,Great location and very good rooms,"We were here for a two day post Christmas break in early January. Booked on Lastminute.com -  a hidden hotel but not hard to work out!  we come to London 2/3 times a year and have stayed in various 5 stars over the years. This one is pretty good - rooms are great, service generally good, although a little disappointed with the relocated restaurant in a function room as some refurbishment was in progress.  Breakfast really was not very good, crowded, poor food, although that is all there was to complain about really.  Very pleasant and attentive staff, immaculately clean, great rate, and wonderful location for shopping and ease of access to the tube if you want to get around. We were very happy there and would not hesitate to go back - well up to standard here in London.",4,2010,01,14
150,Comfortable and Convenient Churchill,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel.  Welcome and reception were very good - all staff encountered friendly and helpful.  The bedroom was spacious and well appointed with good facilities. Compactish bathroom but with good shower.  Evening room service turndown.  I was very comfortable here.

The main restaurant was closed for refurb and a banquetting room set up - service was fine but the buffet was rather ordinary and lacking in great quality (poor coffee) particularly at the amount charged for breakfast.  However the Festive rate for the room was very good value.

The other highlight for me was a lunch in the Italian  restaurant - Locanda Locatelli - absolutely delicious and not to be missed by any lover of fine Italian fare.",5,2010,01,12
150,Great Choice,"Returned from a 3 night break frm Churchill regency hotel. Ideally located. done the same trip last year at novotel but this yers beats it hands down. 
We had 3 rooms overlooking  the park.
Walking distance with suitcases from Marble Arch Tube. Oxford Street on doorstep, shops and pubs & restaurants close enough. We all went to see We Will Rock You Musical and Sister Act  ""FANTASTIC"" both of them, again close to hotel either walk or short trip in cab or on tube.
 Winterwonderland at Hyde Park 10 min walk again great trip but expensive Gluvine £4 a glass.
1st night we were there I printed off 5 vouchers for Prezzo Italian Restaurant, best meal we had ,200 yards from hotel, we paid £10 each and had nice starter with pasta or pizza as main  And bottle of perroni or glass of wine, Smashing.
Booked hotel through Superbreaks 1st Class service.
I dont often recommend places to stay but I am sure whover you are you  would be pleased here.
Breakfast Superb.
 Theres always a downside this is the cost of the hotel bar. VERY EXPENSIVE. Nice pubs and bars 2 mins away. Irealised after ordering we where the only ones drinking beer and wine. Unfortunately is was my turn to pay. Ah well can`t have everything.",5,2010,01,10
150,Excellent central London hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights between Christmas and New Year '09 and what a great hotel.  We bkd through the Aer Lingus website and it was a ""hush hush"" deal so we were delighted to find out on our confirmation it was The Churchill Hyatt Regency.  We were celebrating our anniversary and my husband emailed the hotel to request a quiet room and to our delight they upgraded us.  We were also absolutely thrilled to receive champagne and chocolates in our room - the hotel didn't have to do this and it was a wonderful touch.  Our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable with all the comforts you'd expect from a 5* hotel (i.e. tea & coffee making facilities, ironing board, toiletries, mini bar etc).  The check in/out was smooth and the staff we encountered were friendly, professional and efficient.  We will definately return to this hotel as we like to stay in London a couple of times a year.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of central London.",5,2010,01,07
150,A HOTEL WITH THE WOW FACTOR!!!,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel for our honeymoon early in January.  The staff were amazing.  The rooms were among the finest I have experienced in any London Hotel.  The Waldorf certainly need to take a leaf out of The Churchill book.  I could not fault one thing at this hotel.  The lounge for drinks and canapes was exceptional - it was so good we did not want to leave to attend the West End Show we had booked!.  Superb service at breakfast the next morning and a very pleasant check out.  Thank you Churchill we will certainly return very soon,",5,2010,01,04
150,A very nice hotel located at 5' of the heart of London!,"Hotel choosen for a group of 46 people (seminar) after a first visit in october (scouting) for his quality, his location, amenities and style. A very good organisation for a fast check in and fast check out, an efficient concierge at your entire disposal.
Located at 200m of Oxford Street or Park Lane but quiet for a good night.
100% of my customers satisfied by this hotel Hyatt and by the breakfast buffet and the....bar.
Try the mojito!",5,2009,12,14
150,Preferred hotel in London,"Great location less than 5 mins from Oxford street and Marble Arch tube station.

Very comfortable rooms of a good size.  Nice bathroom.  Iron and ironng board.  

Friendly service.  

Very comfortable bed.

Highly recommended.",4,2009,12,13
150,What a find..brilliant value,"Hi
Booked this through Last Minute and was one of their top secret hotels so got it about half the price it should have been. Quite good location for all the major sites with short tube rides. Check in was quick, friendly and welcoming and although we got there just after 1300 our room was ready. King size bed, room modern, spacious with very plush fittings and everything you need . Good size bathroom with bath and shower. Air conditioning perfectly controllable and quiet. The room was mega quiet and bed very comfy. My hubby says he slept like a log. 
Didnt eat at the hotel but ate at chinatown and also near by the hotel were some really good Persian restaurants. Had a lovely meal at one called Safa. Ate really late after theatre but service impeccable.  
All in all we had a lovely stay here and wouldnt hesitate to stay again.",5,2009,11,20
150,Nice location but if you want a good health club or food pass on it,"Decent enough rooms although you can hear the hallway noise.  I had to move my room that was near elevator since there were kids flying their toy in foyer.  Also, could hear anytime someone came by.

The ""gym"" is very poor by 5-star standards...3 treadmills, 2 eillipticals, 1 bike, no machines...very tight space.

Food is just Ok...avoid the marg. pizza (seems the frozen type)

Definately not worth 300 pounds...try the langham nearby...much better food, gym, rooms",3,2009,11,15
150,Damn perfect,"No more to say really, great location, quiet yet a short walk from Oxford St, staff are great",5,2009,11,10
150,Good place to stay,"Arrived very early - given room immediately.
Nice bedroom.  Huge comfortable bed.  Very quiet & peaceful.  Elegant contemporary decor - white walls, dark wood.   Good shower.  Lovely towels/bathrobe.
Excellent breakfast - wide choice from buffet and made to order waffles, pancakes, etc .
Very good location - off Oxford Street, just round the corner from Selfridges. 
Only downsides - hotel could be more generous with complementary beverages - just 4 sachets of milk provided in double room (have to ring housekeeping to get more).  No hot chocolate sachets, no little packets of biscuits.  Also bare minimum of toileteries - no nail file, just one shower cap, etc. (these are VERY small faults with an otherwise excellent hotel).",5,2009,11,10
150,Nice place to stay but chambermaid is a little sloppy....,"Stayed in Hyatt Churchill for for 4 nights in Oct.  I was on a short weekend trip with my husband.
Location : Coveniently located near the Marble Arch Tube station and Oxford Street.  Bond Street is only a short walk away.  It was the weekend and we wanted to attend mass.  St James Church, a catholic church was 10 mins walk away.  Very convenient.
Rooms : Good size room with pleasant deco but walls are a little thin like what others mentioned here on TA.  We could hear people opening and closing their doors and talking along the corridor in the evening.  Fortunately no one made too loud noises after 10pm and so we were still able to get decent sleep.  I like to have breakfast served in my room and normally place my order card at the door before I go to bed.  The chambermaid was sloppy and did not replace my cards everyday.  I had to call every evening for a new card.  I would have thought this should be standard operating procedure for the chambermaid.  It leaves me to wonder if the chambermaid was unhappy with us.  On the first day, we had checked in in the late afternoon.  We went out shopping and came back to our room around 8-9pm.  Immediately when I came back, the chambermaid knocked on my door to ask if I needed anything.  As I just came back, I told her we did not need anything and she left.  I did not give her a tip.  This happened the second night as well.  I travel often and this is the first time that I encounter chambermaids knocking on my door immediately after I return to my room.  8-9pm is definitely too late for turn-down service.  Most 4/5 star hotels I stay in do turn down in the evening around 5-6pm.
Room Service : Prompt / On time.  Food was delivered warm.
Internet Service : We did use the internet service for one day.  It cost us GBP15 for 24 hours.  Not cheap but we thought it reasonable/comparable to other 4-5 star hotels.  Connection was quite fast and good.
Conclusion: A convenient place to stay with comfortable room.",4,2009,11,06
150,Wonderful location,"Just returned from 2 night stay in The Churchill. Excellent service. Arrived early and were allocated room within half an hour. We got an super deal after extensive ""secret research"" Extras proved very expensive. 121/2% service charge on everything.
Breakfast and dinner were very good standard. We had booked half board and were given a separate menu for dinner. Location was terrific. Short walk to Marble Arch underground station. Selfridges etc very close to hotel. 5mins from Oxford Street. A minor problem with mini bar was quickly resolved and a complimentary voucher for pre-dinner drinks given. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2009,11,03
150,home away from home,"as usual the hotel has kept itself up to its excellent standard.
the gyms very spacious and functional
food great
access to the west end is excellent
the staff are wonderful and courteous
the only BUT is having to pay for internet access after paying so much, someone need to alert them that this does more damage tot heir brand than the anount they make from the internet charges. they should have every customer assigned access for FREE",5,2009,11,02
150,Perfect Hotel in perfect location,"We stayed for a long weekend from October 23-26 at the Hyatt Regengy London - The Churchill.

Overview:
The Churchill was definitively one of the best hotels we ever stayed in London. An we come for 20 yearrs 2.3 times a year, tried a lot of hotel.
From the time of reservation until leaving the hotel we absolutely loved the hotel and the staff is really very attentive.

Hotel:
The hotel is located on Portman square, thats one block behind Oxford street, less then 5 minutes walk from Marble Arch station.
It was formerly an Intercontinental, but has been renovated some years ago. Outside impression is not so nice (50's style), but inside everything is very nice and perfect. Very impressive lobby.
We had  room on 7th floor with park view. There are double windows to protect from street noise and Aircondition worked perfectly, even in October.

Room:
We had a King room facing the park, beds are heavenly and rooms are big for London standards. Everything perfectly clean. Room was services twice a day and turn down was done every night. The bathroom is not big but nice and all amenities available, inclusive bathrobes.
Everything looks new, carpet, furniture, everything you expect from a 5 Star hotel (which is not common standard in London).
Water pressure in bathroom is great.

Service:
I told the hotel, that this trip is a birthday gift for my friend. At check-in they congratulated for birthday and we found champagne and sweets on the room. They also gave us an upgrade from standard to park view room.
This was really a great surprise.
Everybody in the hotel was abolutely friendly and helpful, they even extended our checkout time to 4 PM.
Only negative issue was the service in the Churchill Cocktail bar. Staff was not friendly and absolutely unflexible. They did not have Mai Tai on the menue and when I asked for it, the waiter said they only mix drinks from the list.  So we did not use the bar again. But this was a absolutely minor issue and did not bother us.

Location:
Portman square is right behind Oxford street, Marble Arch underground staton only 5 minuites walk. Lots of shops, restaurants and cafes around.

We will definitively come back to the Churchill !!!!",5,2009,10,27
150,Classy hotel just blocks away from shopping and Hyde Park.,"The Hyatt Regency was a very nice and classy hotel. It is located just a few blocks from LOTS of shopping. The rooms were accomodating and even spacious for a European hotel.

My only complaint is the availability of food after 9pm but this also seems to be much of London. We had to search just to get a snack.

Overall, I highly reccommend this hotel!",4,2009,10,21
150,Amazing Service,This Hotel has some of the best service in the whole country. There attention to detail in regards to the food outlets and the rooms is second to none. Make sure to see the concierge staff while u stay. They know almost anything u can trhough at them and are so polite and full of great ideas. Will always stay at the Churchill when in London!!!,5,2009,10,14
150,What can I say - its a very posh hotel,Its a hotel that merits its five stars. I got an upgrade and I won a free night too. So I was pretty happy (but very lucky too).,5,2009,10,13
150,Posh hotel in a great location,"I stayed here recently using some of my Hyatt points and at 18k per night, I figured it had to be nice but was still not prepared for how nice the lobby was when I entered.  Didn't have too much interaction with the staff---front desk was polite but not very warm, room service was very nice (used it for the free Coffee for GP members).  My room was very quiet and plush, great bed which was comfortable for sleeping and I didn't hear any noise.  Bathroom was very nice with a decent shower but I never got any Moulton Brown amenities as I guess those were reserved for the Club floor rooms.

Decent exercise room with showers and co-ed sauna----only issue was that there were no lockers to leave my stuff in if I changed down there rather than coming down in my workout gear.   The restaurant looked good and they were running a decent prix-fixe special for both lunch and dinner (decent price considering the area) but I never got to try it as there were so many other places to try on nearby Marlybone High Street or even Baker Street.

Loved having the free wi-fi (for Elite GP members) as that saved quite a few bucks.  Also did like the electrical options (choice of US or European outlets for charging your phone etc).  I made the mistake of drinking the water bottles left out for me after the turndown service, assuming they were free for Elite members but then ended up paying 8 pounds plus tax for the 2 bottles (quite pricey), so watch out for that and the mini-bar.

Not sure if I would pay the rack rate to stay here but it is a very nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay.",4,2009,10,07
150,I LOVE the Hyatt,"My daughter and I were in London for a 5 day holiday before she went to Uni.  I'm never disappointed when I stay at the Hyatt - the service is impeccable (I always tell people, that everyone in the service industry should go to the Hyatt School of Service!), the hotel was beautiful, in a good location, had a great workout room, and our room was outstanding.  We had a wonderful experience at the Hyatt on this trip.  Every staff member we came into contact with went out of his/her way to accommodate/assist us.  Our room was always fresh and well attended to (and the Molton Brown bath/shower gel is addicting!).  The workout room was pristine, a good size, and had good quality treadmills and weights.  We enjoyed the Regency Club benefits on this trip and it was lovely to go for breakfast before starting out on our long walks discovering all there is to see and experience in London!  I would stay at the Churchill again without question.  For a woman traveling on her own or with children, the Hyatt is in a great neighborhood and we always felt safe.  I love the Hyatt and stay at one wherever I travel.",5,2009,10,06
150,Clean and efficient,"The rooms are a bit small, but otherwise the hotel is fine.  You will like the little thoughts they put into the workstation area (power outlets for EU and USA).  The bathroom and bedding are nice, and the hotel is well-located.  It's fine.",4,2009,10,05
150,Great Price Great Hotel,"Altough our stay was only brief, the overall impression was first class.

We were attending a function at another venue and I left briefly at midnight to move the car to this hotel and to check in. Parking outside the hotel at the weekend was easy. Check in took a couple of minutes and reception were very friendly and helpful despite the fact it was past midnight. I left the bags with the receptionist.
Returned to the hotel around 2 am. Bags were waiting in room. Decor in hotel very tasteful.
Room 605. Clean large well decorated. Massive comfortable bed. 
Nice bathroom. Again spotless. Brilliant shower. 
The hotel supplied all those nice little extras. Tea and coffee in room, a safe, robes and slippers.
My only complaint was that we weren't staying longer.",5,2009,10,05
150,"Luxurious hotel, luxurious bed, fantastic location","Got this room at a great rate of only £120stg on a discount website - so with that context in mind I was greatly impressed. Fantastic location near Oxford street, Baker street and marylebone High Street; spotless and beautifully equipped hotel; the most comfortable hotel bed I can recall. Yes the room was serviced twice daily - but surely this is no bad thing! At full rack rate some may be disappointed, but if you can bag a bargain (even if some 'top secret' detective work is required), this hotel is phenomenal value. I didn't wish to pay for breakfast, but there are many suitable low-cost venues for this within a few hundred metres' radius - and room in the minibar fridge for a snack to get you started!.",5,2009,09,25
150,Fantastic,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Just don't use the mini bar or bar unless you have a big wallet,5,2009,09,21
150,"Excellent Hotel, Great location","Staff were friendly, Small room but had everything that we needed. Breakfast what a great choice!!! Only one problem not sure why the room had to be cleaned twice a day!!",5,2009,09,02
150,Great hotel in London,"1 night-stay on the Club floor en-route back to Japan.  Excellent club lounge, generous helpings and a nice selection of booze.  Good all round help from the staff; printing boarding passes, helping with luggage left on a train.  Good-sized, well appointed room, Molton and Brown toiletries and great water pressure on the shower.   We ate in the Locanda Locatelli Italian restaurent located in the hotel and had a great meal (can be charged to the room).  It was jam packed on a Tuesday night so they must be doing something right.   
All in all it's pretty expensive not that we felt it as we were there on Hyatt points but I don't think I'd mind paying as you get what you pay for here, which you can't always say about London hotels.",5,2009,09,02
150,i was disappointed,"I have stayed in the Churchill before this time in 2004 and I enjoyed the room, the breakfast buffet and the friendly reception staff.
However, this time every think have changed the breakfast was not like last time stranded, when we check in we ask the reception for a connected rooms ""we have booked 2 rooms for us and for the children"" but the person in the front desk said we have to pay extra for the connected rooms which was too much.
I've been in many five stars hotels none of them have charge me for the connected room!!

Another problem was in the bathroom door there was a problem with the door lock and we asked them to repair it but it wasn't actually repaired till the fourth day for our request to repair it.

On our last day the flight was postponed and we asked them for an extra night to send the room service did not make up our room despite the fact that we have actually but the sign of cleaning the room on the door and we I asked them why they said we thought you were checking out and they did not want to bother them selves cleaning the room twice! 

i will not stay there again !!",3,2009,08,26
150,What an amazing experience,"I booked the Hyatt Regency London for a wedding anniversary weekend and having e-mailed the hotel prior to our arrival we were upgraded to the club lounge. The room was very spacious with nice modern touches rather than the 'tired' look in some of the other London 5 start hotels. The staff were all very friendly and the refreshments in the club lounge throughout the day were a nice touch! We were also given champaigne, fruits and chocolates for our room which again made it very special! The location was perfect for shopping , restaurants and a romantic walk around hyde park. We didn't have dinner but the breakfast in the Montague had a very good and varied continental spread including the choice of a full english breakfast. Overall my wife and I loved it here and will be looking to book Hyatt hotels when we go abroad if this is anything to go by!

I know there were comments made about the middle-eastern travellers but i think that was just a matter of 'timing' more than anything else as they come to London just before Ramadan ... They had left by the time of our stay but i have experienced that before in another 5 star hotel and there is not that much can be done as with any large party staying all at once...!",5,2009,08,24
150,Very pricey for crowded hotel,"We were a bit disappointed with our stay at the Churchill.  The hotel was very expensive given the current dollar/pound exchange rate.  For 335 pounds/night, we received a pretty average room with a smallish bathoom (we did have bathrobes).  This hotel seems to cater to visitors from the Middle East.  As a woman, I was almost uncomfortable going into hotel common areas without my head covered.  Plus, the hotel room TV had almost as many Arabic TV channels as English TV channels.  Concierge and staff mostly seemed too busy/disinterested to answer questions.  Not what we had hoped for during our stay.",3,2009,08,21
150,Really Enjoyed the Churchill,"We stayed here on a quick stopover to the Seychelles and Kenya.  The hotel was in a great location, near the subway and good restaurants/shopping.  Also, we enjoyed being able to walk over to Hyde Park after dinner.  The service was excellent.  We stayed on the Club or Executive floor which was nice as we received complimentary drinks, snacks and breakfast.  The room was nicely appointed and the shower had excellent water pressure.  All in all, a great stay and I'd definitely come back next time I make it to London",5,2009,08,19
150,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","The Churchill is a first class hotel  with nice finishes and impeccable staff. The room was of average size and in good overall condition.Our expectations were met and the hotel delivered in typical Hyatt fashion.

We found the location to be fantastic especially if you are interested in shopping. Many of London's landmark department stores are withing walking distance. Marble Arch tube station is within three minutes of the hotel. 

A bit pricey but we were not surprised to pay for quality in London.",4,2009,08,18
150,A fairly good stay,"I spent one night in this hotel. I am a diamond member with Hyatt.

This is a decent hotel. The outside looks like a hall of residence/dorm but the inside is nice and clean. The front desk staff is espcially courteous, efficient and kind. I was immediately acknowledged as a dimond member. I was allowed to check-in early (11.30am) in a King room on the second floor. This hotel has very low ceilings: it feels a bit oppressive. However, the rooms are decent. Typical decent London rooms: small but ok.

When I returned from a long day of shopping in the evening, I had the suprise of finding a few chocolates, fruits and a small bottle of wine awaiting for me in the room with a nice card from the general manager welcoming me to the hotel.

In the morning I had a good breakfast at the Regency Lounge on the 8th floor. The choice is fairly limited but the food is good (the lounge has a particularly low ceiling too).

All in all, I had a very decent stay.

My favorite hotel in London is the Sofitel St James Park, I confess. There is no place that can beat it. And the Hyatt Churchill certainly does not match the incredible service of the Sofitel.",3,2009,08,16
150,Shame on my travel agent-should never have been sent here,"The Hyatt regency Churchill is jokingly known as the Hyatt Dubai by cabdrivers and Londoners.  If I was not on a package we would have checked out.
Wealthy Saudi Arabians with their nannies and families vacation here for 2-3 months of summer. I was  practically the only woman at breakfast without a face covering and we were totally uncomfortable here at all times. The walls are paper thin and babies were crying, men talking in loud voices at all times. The lobby and business area was  so filled with these summer residents to the point of us not even being able to meet with friends in the lobby--we had to stand!! The staff is unable to do anything because these guests are there for the summer. This is NOT A BUSINESS HOTEL in the summer--for a five star experience we were miserable.",2,2009,08,13
150,Ideas Above it's Station,"Nice looking bar and good desk staff, but very basic rooms.  Staff in hotel bar were amazingly unhelpful and didn't  want to serve us at 12.35am beacause they closed at 1am?! Stayed in a lot of hotels round the world but would not come back here again. Sorry!",2,2009,08,09
150,Surprised- Not your average Hyatt,"Overall quite impressed with the rooms, some of the nicest rooms in London and spacious. Great cleanliness and wonderful location to everything.",4,2009,08,07
150,"It was so nice, I'm considering being Married here....","After having booked the Churchill through Lastminute.com and getting a good deal on a luxury 5* myself and my friend were anticipating nothing less than fabulous 5* treatment. 

On pulling up to the Hotel, we were met with 2 or 3 Concierges who opened our door and offered to take our luggage. They were very friendly and spoke with us about where we were visiting from etc before showing us into the hotel lobby and making a couple of friendly jokes. One of the biggest let downs on our arrival was that our room was not ready (We arrived approx 1 hour before check-in). Luckily Oxford Street was a 2 minute walk, so we decided to go to Marks and Spencers to get some snacks for the room. On arriving back, some (what looked like) Middle-Eastern Royalty had arrived at the hotel to stay and the lobby had a number of watchful security guards keeping their eye. 

On being shown to our room (and our luggage being taken for us) we were very happy with the twin bedroom and it's contents - though I must mention we were disappointed to find an opened bottle of Wine in the Mini-Bar, which we proceeded to tell the Room Service right away. The gentlemen who came in to organise the removal of the Wine bottle was very, very apologetic. Essentially we couldn't help but forgive the mishap. The bedroom area itself was very lovely, with a view of Portman Square. The beds were very comfortable, the linen was beautiful and some furniture pieces in the room were very nice too. The bathroom was spacious with a bath and a shower over it. I always prefer a stand-alone shower, but I guess the need to please everyone sometimes gets in the way of hotel bathroom designs! The Mini-bar was full of goodies (though they were somewhat expensive). There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for our belongings and several hangers were provided. The room also featured Tea & Coffee facilities, a free safe and air conditioning which was very, very simple to use. We were also glad to find free slippers and dressing gowns in our room.

The service in the hotel was excellent (despite the 2 mishaps). The concierges were exceptionally helpful and organised a private limo for us (When you ask for a Cab and you get a Limo, you know your in good hands!!!) and also arranged for myself and my friend to be put on the Guest List of a top Nightclub. Essentially, all of the staff were very friendly and thats the personal attention to detail that you can expect at The Churchill.

During our stay we were also celebrating my birthday, for which I was given 2 free bottles of Champagne and a tray of chocolates - A lovely surprise! When having drinks in the hotel bar, the barman was very nice. We were greeted with free Olives and nuts which went down a treat and on learning that it was my birthday the Barman told us that the drinks we had were on the house and a live pianist proceeded to sing Happy Birthday to me! It really was very nice indeed. I was then brought a Lemon Tart with a candle in to top it all off!

Really, our time at the Churchill was the most extravagnet and indulgent 3 days of my life. The staff were exceptionally friendly and the birthday celebrations were a nice extra touch...as was the private Limo and the bottles of Champagne! The interior of the building is Modern yet Classic and essentially on first seeing makes the modest person go ""Wow"". The hotel had all of the major services that one should expect in a 5* hotel and all of the public areas, dining rooms and even toilets were lovely. Infact, it was so nice and made such an impression on me I am considering holding my wedding reception there.",5,2009,08,04
150,Fantastic hotel & staff in great location,"In line with most other reviews here, I'll br brief - this hotel is awesome.  Great staff, clean/modern rooms, free internet, all in a great location.",5,2009,08,02
150,Great service and very comfortable,"Though it does not look much from the outside step through the doors and you are cossetted in luxury and attentive service...with a smile. Only stayed the one night as it was a treat for my sister's 70th birthday year and we had booked for the opera. Had a good deal on Hyatt website and they upgraded us to a garden view room, which we loved. Room was lovely with great beds and spotlessly clean. They even left us a bottle of champagne and gorgeous chocs which had my sister in tears.......of joy! How thoughtful can you get. If this is Hyatt service I look forward to visiting more of the Hyatt chain. Thanks for making my sister's visit ( and mine) a very memorable one.",5,2009,07,28
150,A list treatment,"My partner and I stayed here for my birthday this year. We booked it through the secret hotels on lastminute.com, which is always a bit of a risk. However, we liked the location and the description, so we booked. My boyfriend sent the reservations team an e-mail off the back of a tip from another traveller, and when he explained that it was my birthday while we were there, they upgraded us to an executive suite for free. 
Located a few minutes off Oxford Street (near Marble Arch), we were a little anxious when we saw the outside of The Churchill. It looks a little bit like a concrete shopping centre. However, as soon as we rounded the corner to the entrance, our anxieties disappeared. The reception area is beautiful - all marble, chandeliers and historical statues. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly, and we were treated like the obviously moneyed guests, despite having one rather tatty Primark holdall! 
The room itself was minimal, but very comfortable and ours was equipped with the usual hotel stuff - minibar, TV, dressing gowns etc. 
We drank in the bar after our meal that evening, and I was a little disappointed. Although we had been seated first, two other gentlemen were served their drinks before our order was even taken. Although it must be hard to juggle all customer needs, especially when some are more forceful than others, it was very obvious that we had been missed out as there were only a few groups of drinkers. Still, we ended up taking the rest of our drinks to our room, which was lovely.
We had paid for an inclusive breakfast, which was around a tenner each. Although this seems pricey, I have never seen a better buffet! It took us around an hour and a half to finish breakfast, and there were still items we wanted to sample, but our groaning tummies wouldn't let us. The continental portion alone included cakes, cheeses, fruit, cereal, yoghurts and a huge selection of fruit drinks. The fruit was beautifully fresh and the glasses for the juice were a sensible size - at least half a pint!
The hot food consisted of the usual - sausage, bacon, mushrooms, fried eggs etc, although I ordered off menu - French toast and poached eggs. They were beautifully cooked, although there was an awkward moment when I had to explain to the bemused waiter that both plates were, in fact, for me.  When I whispered to my boyfriend that I would quite like another cup of coffee, a waitress was there with a coffee pot in seconds, which made me think there might be microphones in the flowers! 

The hotel is very 'international', with the majority of guests being from outside of the UK, as you would expect from a London hotel in peak season. I found the different clothes, languages and accent extremely interesting, especially as a large portion of the staff were international, with impeccable English, of course. 

If were planning another luxury trip in London, this would be my first port of call, so long as you can ignore what the outside of the building looks like.",4,2009,07,27
150,Disappointing,"The hotel is very poorly designed. It is noisy, uncomfortable, and the staff less than attentive. It could and should be so much better.",1,2009,07,22
150,Wonderful Anniversary Treat!,"We stayed here recently for our wedding anniversary weekend and couldn't fault the hotel, service or food in any way.  It was spotlessly clean, the staff were beyond helpful and the room was just beautiful.

I had mentioned when booking that it was our anniversary and on arrival we found chilled champagne and truffles.  What a lovely thoughtful surprise.  We loved it.

We ate in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast and both were outstanding.

Next time we visit London this is where we will be staying without a doubt.  Excellent!!",5,2009,07,22
150,Luxury at a bargain price!,"My new husband and i stayed here for three nights at the end of our honeymoon after spending a week in Italy and 8 days in the Maldives. We thought a few days in a nice hotel in London before going home to Ireland would be a good way to ease us back in to normal life and booked one of lastminute.com's top-secret hotels after doing some research and feeling pretty sure this was the hotel we were getting! We were delighted when we found out it was and that we had gotten it at such a great price!

We checked in quite late after arriving at Heathrow from our 10 hour flight from Male, looking tired and a bit rough and althought the check-in staff were lovely we couldn't help feeling a little bit out of place! This hotel is for the seriously rich! Everything is opulent and it was quite clear that the other guests were used to this sort of place! That said, at all times the staff were very pleasant and treated us with courtesy and a very good attitude-i often find that in 5 star hotels they seem to have a bit of an attitude problem but i can't say that in this case. 

Anyway, the room was very nice and well equipped. Lovely big comfortable bed! The MOST comfortable bed i've ever slept in! TV, kettle with tea and coffee, well-stocked mini-bar, good hair-dryer. The bathroom wasn't huge but it was fine and with plenty of toiletries and towels. There was some noise from inside the hotel-mainly kids running up and down the corridor! But all in all we were very pleased. 

Because we were exhausted from a few weeks of travelling, on the second night we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant -the Montague- and have an early night. The restaurant is very good, with excellent service, and they did have a reasonably priced set menu although as it was our honeymoon we didn't bother with that! I was hoping to eat in Locanda Locatelli -owned by one of my favourite Italian chef's Georgio Locatelli- which is also in the hotel, but being so tired we didn't even get to look around until the following night when it was too late! I was hoping i might bump into him around the hotel at some point but sadly this was not to be!

We also had a drink in the bar on our last night after being at the theatre but it wasn't really for us! A bit stuffy, more for rich American Businessmen and the like, but that's in-keeping with the hotel i guess. It's quite a nice place to chill-out and very comfortable. It is pretty expensive though. 

The very best thing about this place is it's location! Literally behind Oxford street although set in a quiet area over-looking a small park. Perfect for shopping and seeing all of London, only a few minutes walk from Marble Arch or Bond Street tube stations! And a minute from Park Lane and bus links to all the major airports!

Breakfast wasn't included in our rate so i can't comment although this wasn't a problem in London! So many places to eat! We found a great cafe down the street in Mayfair doing proper scrambled eggs, bacon and fried tomatoes that would set anyone up for the day for only £5 or £6 or so.

It's a great hotel and i would say worthy of it's high price tag, we felt lucky to have gotten such a good deal. It's not for everyone as it is very luxurious and, dare i say 'upper-class'? But it was a lovely treat to end a great wedding and honeymoon and, if we got the same sort of deal i would definatley stay here again (and hopefully meet Giorgio this time)!",5,2009,07,17
150,International Hotel in international City,"I can think of nothing negative to say about The Churchill.  Admittedly, we stayed using Hyatt points so the cost was not an issue, but the hotel truly exceeded any expectation we might have had.

First, there were no service fees, taxes, or other charges tacked onto the Gold Passport point deductions.  No certificates to present and no desk clerk to try to convince.  This is quite different from other experiences we've had with other chains in London when redeeming their loyalty points.  Kudos to Hyatt.

Second, perhaps because I am a Platinum level, but the Churchill had upgraded us to the Regency Club floor.  I have not priced the differential to use the Club floor using regular bookings but Regency Club truly is a small hotel within the hotel.  Check In and Check Out are on the Club Floor, away from the bustle of the (somewhat smallish) main lobby.  And the service in the Club itself was amazing.  Wonderful breakfast buffet with linens on the tables.  Solicitous staffing with beverages and fruit  available throughout the day.  And a leisurely appetizer and beverage (including champagne) buffet in the evening -- the bowls of olives and nuts on the tables were a great touch.   And, of course, the live flower bouquets on every table are always set a marvelous tone.

Then there's the service staff.  A maid stood waiting on each wing to keep track of which rooms were unoccupied and immediately make them up during your absence.   Turn down service at night included fresh water bottles (both still and sparkling -- I'm sure you could have asked for your preference) although in typical European fashion, it didn't seem to occur to them that some ice would have nice as well (although, again, I'm certain you could just ask.)

There is a theatre booking desk right in the main floor lobby and the staff was very accommodating, finding us a great dinner package and going out of their way to be sure we understood all dimensions of the arrangements (I know we're grandparents but I presume they would be that nice to everyone, not just those they suspect may be a dotty.)

In our opinion, if you really are looking for a conveniently located 5 star hotel with outstanding service, The Churchill probably will meet your expectations.  If, however, you are looking for a charming (architecturally or culturally) English inn, this probably isn't your best choice.  It is truly an international class hotel with an international clientele located right off the world class international shopping district  of Oxford Street and environs.

We should also comment that we were staying in London during a dreadful heat wave but the climate control in The Churchill, including our room was outstanding.  From experience we can say that not every hotel in London can make the same claim.

One regret.  After returning home some friends were envious that we had actually stayed at The Churchill and asked us how we enjoyed high tea in the dining room.  According to our friends, afternoon tea at the Churchill is the best in London.  Unfortunately we had taken a pass on the heavily advertised tea.  Guess we'll just have to save that for our next visit.",5,2009,07,15
150,"Nice hotel, but £300 a night??","We stayed 1 night, 11th July.  My friend had a free night through the Gold Passport Scheme.  Check in was swift and friendly and because we asked for a quite room (my friend was running a 10k race the next day), the receptionist moved us to a quieter room and showed us where it was on a plan.  \She warned that the view wasn't up to much, but we didn't care.  The room was bright and airy, with lots of channels on the large flat screen tv.  The beds were very comfortable, but the duvets meant it was very warm when we slept, even with the air con on.  The mugs were replaced and the coffee tray replenished when we went out for the evening.  Two bottles of Hilden water 1 flat, 1 sparkling were placed by the beds. 
When we came in, we had a drink in the bar, it cost £20 for a G&T and Baileys on the rocks!  We ordered a continental breakfast (at £22), which was enormous and we (well I) didn't finish.
  The door on the shower didn't fit properly and I managed to get lots of water on the floor of the bathroom, when I showered.  The shower wasn't easy to get the temperature right, but was powerful.  There didn't appear to be an extractor fan and consequently to bathroom got very warm indeed.
  We ate in the restaurant for their Sunday lunch special, which was nice, and we were also able to get a late checkout.  This is a nice hotel in a fabulous location (2 minutes from Selfridges), but, boy am I glad, we didn't have to pay the rack rate or anything like it!",4,2009,07,12
150,Great place to stay in London,"After a long few weeks traveling through Europe this was a wonderful place to stay before heading home. The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. The staff was friendly, and the concierge was beyond helpful in dealing with a shipping question. The only thing I would recommend is either ordering breakfast up to your room or being prepared to be patient and often overlooked during breakfast as the staff seemed completely overwhelmed. We ended up being totally ignored after being seated one morning, watching other people who just took over a dirty table get served while we couldn't catch anyone's eye or attention. We ended up just walking out. But if you do get served the food is quite good, and you might do better just doing the buffet.",4,2009,06,30
150,"Good hotel, good service","one of the better hotels we stayed in london. rooms are spacious, food is good n service is excellent. Best value for money.",5,2009,06,27
150,There are much better hotels at half the price,"I was so looking forward to staying here from reviews on this site. All I can say is that it was a let down. Service was mediocre, room was small - AirCon did not work ( no one was sent to fix it despite my complaint), sink in bathroom would not drain.
At the price and 5 Star acclaim, I expected it to be faultless.
On a plus side, the Churchill bar is fab, we were given complimentary Champagne in the room for our celebration, breakfast was good too.

Would I stay here again, probably not. I have stayed at Novotel's for £49 a night that were faultless, so at £200 a night to have basic faults like these is wholly unacceptable.",3,2009,06,26
150,This hotel truly deserves the 5 star rating.,"A lot of hotels claim to be 4 or 5 star when they are at best, one rung below. The Churchill deserves every aspect of the rating. The location is superb, right off Oxford Street and a stone's throw from the Marble Arch Underground (Tube) station. Knightsbridge is a very pleasant walk through the park away. Paddington rail station and its links to Heathrow Airport are within walking distance, or a cheap (for London) cab ride. And speaking of cabs, they line up outside the hotel just waiting for you.

The building and common areas are magnificent, the rooms (even the ""cheapest"") are very well outfitted and fairly large by London standards. The only complaint (and a very minor one) would be that the bath/shower only has a half-door, no curtain, so if you want a shower you either have to squash up to the front, or get water on the floor. Plenty of choice on the TV. The restaurant is very good and not too overpriced.

By far the best thing about the hotel is the service, which was exceptional, even for a luxury hotel. The doorman, the front desk staff (especially an extremely eager and helpful chap whose name escapes me), the duty manager, the restaurant/room service servers, even the housekeepers were not only helpful, but went out of their way to suggest ways that they could help more. For example, one night there were noisy children running and playing along the hallway outside our room, for over an hour around midnight. As usual, their probably obscenely wealthy parent accompanying them didn't care. The hotel staff cared, even though many hotels would have said it wasn't their problem, they couldn't do anything about it, or any other excuse. The desk clerk was sympathetic and immediately called the duty manager over. The manager took the issue seriously, said he would have security do a quick walk around the next night to ensure it was quiet, contacted the parents and sent us a bottle of complimentary champagne. Again, most hotels would treat it as a trivial complaint, but The Churchill realised that people who pay good money expect a good experience - whether or not it's ""their fault"".

The other minor irritant was that, similar to many hotels in London, both Internet use and phone calls were expensive. Personally, I don't think a luxury hotel needs to ""nickel and dime"" that way. Well, more like £15 for the Internet and £1/minute for the phone. However, if you can get a good price for a room or you just have bags of cash, the rest of the hotel more than makes up for it, easily. If you can afford to spend the money, you won't regret a stay at The Churchill. In my mind, worthy of the name and all 5 stars.",5,2009,06,25
150,Exellent hotel,"Exellent hotel ....warm welcoming hotel...Fabulous food (compliments to the chef) served to perfection by freindly efficient staff.The hotel rooms are spacious clean and tastefully decorated The beds are  the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the pillows .......5 Star make it 6 ..
Quiet .relaxed. your every whim catered for .We will return...In conclusion may I say the multiculteral bilinqual hotel staff are the most attractive and charming persons I have ever met ....",5,2009,06,21
150,Luxury for some,"I stayed here for a sightseeing trip with my cuisin. I know London very well and it was her first time. Wanted to show her the perfect London experience.
When you first arrive to the Churchill it is very impresive, lots of luxury in the lobby and the restaurant is well known. But as soon as they realise when you are checking in that you are a mere mortal on a budget (we had booked this as a secret hotel on lastminute and gottena great deal) and not a rich sheik the service goes down. Left me waiting and overall not that friendly. I applaud that the staff speak a ton of different languages as this is a very international hotel but they just can't seem to get the english perfect or even good enough for me to understand them.
We were staying in a simple doubble room with twin beds wich was so small on turn and you were laying on the ground, teeny beds. Room was clean and I would have expected it to be as I saw the cleaning staff at all hours of the day every single day, no matter what time I went out the cleaning carts where stationed in the corridor.
Bathroom was nothing special, clean, but just very very avarage nothing to wow me. Was a bit groosed out by the rubber mat they had in the tub, yuck.

Will not be staying here again as London has so many hotels to choose from so don't even bother with this one if your not ultra rich and can upgraid yourself to a deluxe super suite.",4,2009,06,20
150,"Excellent hotel, no complaints, no surprises","We stayed one night in the Churchill, which I've passed many times when I lived in London. It's just off Oxford Street and is handy for everything. The hotel has never looked like much from the outside, but it's suprising luxurious inside. The front desk staff and concierge are super-friendly, the rooms spacious and every need supplied. We even had a supply of complimentary fruit and a welcome card left in the room.

I couldn't fault the hotel, although I didn't have breakfast so can't say whether that is as exemplary as the rest of the experience.",5,2009,06,16
150,Perfect hotel for stop-over in central London,"Stayed at Hyatt Churchill for 2 day stop over in London before jetting off on honeymoon. Hotel excudes class for the second you pull up outside. We we're rushing to see a West End show, and the check-in staff took care of everything whilst we dropped the bags and ran. When we returned later that night the room....and more importantly bed was excellent. It allowed us to drift off to the most amazing sleep ever !!!

Breakfast was excellent. Eggs Benedict is to die for...so good I had it 2 days running !!! Great selection of fresh fruit, juices etc. Freshly squeezed orange juice would wake anyone up it was so good !!!!!!

Perfect location too - 2 minute walk away from Oxford Street - Perfect for shopping to you drop...and then nipping home in the blink of an eye. I'd recommend this hotel, especially with one of the deals they're currently offering....keep your eyes peeled....its worth looking!!!

Treat yourself in London.....go ahead book the Hyatt Churchill !!!!!!",5,2009,06,14
150,"Great staff, relaxed atmosphere, excellent location","Staff were super friendly and couldn't do enough to help you. Room was very clean and comfortable, slightly larger room than your standard king. The restaurant was also great, really good food and service. Location is excellent for shopping (just off Oxford Street) and sight seeing, 2 mins to the Marble Arch tube station. Really enjoyed our stay, would stay again!",5,2009,06,10
150,Excellent Hotel - Recommended,"The Good:
we stayed for 7 days, we got an excellent deal through lastminute.com ( 875£ for 7 days).
we got a room facing the Portman Sq. ( very nice view). we even received a ( happy anniversary) chocolate in our room the first day, the room is sound proof, we did not hear the heavy traffic on Portman road . the location is excellent, it is a 3 minutes walking distance form Oxford St. overall it is en excellent hotel and we will stay there when we come again.

The Bad:
There is high speed internet connection at the room but it is expensive ( 5£ for one hour or 20£ for 24 hours) we asked them if there is any way we can get a one week access but they say they don't have. the second bad thing is that one time we lost our coins at the room, we use to leave our coins ( less than 1£) at the room, but one time we came and found them all gone.",5,2009,05,27
150,We had just a fantastic time at the Hyatt Regency-Churchill,"We have just returned from a three-day family trip to London, we stayed at the fantastic Hyatt Regency-Churchill. The hotel from start to finish was excellent, the service was 5*. The hotel is in a very safe, friendly and central location for doing everything that we wanted to do (and also for getting to any from any airport in London). We would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning in the summer again.",5,2009,05,22
150,"Fantastic hotel, won't bother trying other hotels ever again!","Loved this hotel!  

Service is just impeccable; from the doormen to the waiting staff, the service was just fantastic, and it makes such a difference.

The rooms were great, well decorated, calm, spotless; the best part was the soundproofing windows, you couldn't hear a sound from outside despite being in London.  We had a room overlooking Portman Square, which was beautiful.  

And the breakfast..I would go again simply for the breakfast.  It was truly a feast; cereals, bread, meats/cheese, fresh (really fresh) fruit, breads..oh, the breads....  definitely try the little vanilla pastry!   There's also a lovely selection of hot food, and if you don't see anything you like, they'll cook up whatever you do fancy!  

We also had lunch there, in The Montagu.  Again, the food was fantastic.  They have an offer for Sunday lunches, 2 courses for £19.50, or 3 for £24.50 - definitely try the Sticky Toffee Pudding..the nicest I have ever had.  Ever.

The location of the Hotel is great also;  we wandered off down Oxford St, onto Regent St, walked all the way through Picadilly and Leicester Square, ending up in Covent Garden.   Of course, if you're in London to shop, the shops of Oxford St are literally five mins walk from the door.

Next time I'm in London, I'm going straight for the Churchill, it is worth every penny, and won't even look for anywhere else!",5,2009,05,20
150,Fantastic Hotel,"Great Hotel, just a bit pricey!  Not a lot to do around the hotel except shop",5,2009,05,17
150,Fantastic stay at a first class hotel,"I booked this hotel via lastminute.com for £119 for one night's stay in April, for my boyfriend and I to celebrate our 3 year anniversary in the city.   Glad we did, as we had a fantastic stay.

We were happy with the choice, as the Hyatt is located just 5 minutes away from Marble Arch underground station and Oxford street, so it's a great location for shopping, dining and a bit of sightseeing; at the same time, located out of the way of the hustle and bustle, making it quiet and peaceful.

The day before check-in, I emailed the hotel to confirm the booking and mentioned that it was a special occasion and would appreciate any hospitality they could offer.  I received an email back from Andi Frey - The Reservations Agent, to confirm the booking and to advise that they would make sure our stay was 'perfect'.  

When we arrived we were greeted by friendly porters and reception staff who congratulated us on our anniversary and upgraded our standard double room to a double room with a view.  Our room - room 261 on the 6th floor - was very airy and spacious with a king sized bed (probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on!), working desk, mini bar and views over Upper Berkeley Street.  The bathroom was fairly small, but spotless with all the usual toiletries/amenities hotels offer (bathrobe, shampoo, slippers, free morning newspaper etc).  The mini bar and room service menu was expensive, (£3 for a 300ml bottle of coca cola and £1.50 for a box of smints!) but you come to expect that.

We ordered room service and were pleasantly surprised when our order came with a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of petit fours with 'Happy Anniversary' written around the rim in icing!  A really lovely gesture that was greatly appreciated and made our stay all the more special.

We went out for a meal in the evening and breakfast was not included in our room rate, so unfortunately cannot comment on their restaurant (The Montagu) or their Lounge bar (The Churchill Bar) although both did look very impressive when we walked passed on check-out.  

Check-out the next day was the same as check-in: quick, efficient and friendly.

Overall a fantastic stay in a plush and elegant hotel.   Would definitely recommend to anyone celebrating a special occasion or just staying for a city break.",5,2009,04,21
150,A most happy experience,"Stayed one night DB&B having played a bit of counter-espionage !!

Consequently, the cost was [for London] tolerable and certainly not too outrageous for the comfort involved and the elegant location.

Highlights were the sheer style and ambience of the place, especially the huge lobby / dining area and the [separate, clubby] bar and the great location.

Rooms not vast but very stylish with exceedingly comfortable beds and bedding and big flatscreen tv with lots of channels [including  Arab sheikdom TV stations which identifies probably the hotel's main income-generators]. Very international electrical arrangements too, with 110v US sockets as well as European as well as standard and round pin UK.

Dinner in the Montagu restaurant was fairly limited set menu but of high quality from the open kitchen's brigade of many chefs.

Drinks in the separate and very stylish Churchill Bar very expensive but worth the experience. Shame about the singing pianist though !

Breakfast fine, but essentially the standard big buffet and perhaps could be upgraded a bit - the Waldorf does it better, for example.

All in all, a most pleasurable stay in a very elegant and cosmopolitan area, where state of the art Ferraris are casuallly parked unattended by the roadside.

Buses and tubes to most London areas are readily available on Oxford Street a few minutes walk [and a different world] away.

Nearby Wallace Collection in Manchester Square is quite simply wondrous and stunning as well as free !",5,2009,04,20
150,Highly recommend this hotel,"We stayed here for three nights and really enjoyed it.   It is very hard to find fault with this hotel,  the staff are friendly,  the location is wonderful and the beds are very comfortable.    The service at breakfast was a little disorganised and it is a little expensive but I would stay here again and I say that about very few places.   It is very relaxing to come back here in the evening - London is  very tiring so its nice to have a place to unwind.",5,2009,04,16
150,Lovely hotel that we wouldn't normally be able to afford.,"We recently stayed 3 nights after bagging a Top Secret Hotel deal on lastminute.com - but they had given away enough information for me to know exactly where it was so we paid £120 a night for a wonderful room on a room only basis. The room was very spacious with a large desk if you need to work and a very comfortable chair for lounging purposes. The bed also was very large, very comfortable and we slept wonderfully well which is one of the main reasons for trying to get a 5 * hotel at a decent price - the beds are always better. The bathroom was great, both bath and shower and toiletries provided were top notch and we also had robes and slippers. Our mini bar didn't have a jiggly system (jiggle it and it is yours!) going on and we were able to keep our water in there. Which is lucky as the prices were very steep. £8 for a mini bottle of gin - without the tonic. And amazingly - it looked like they added 12.5 % service on top of this price. What? 
We didn't use the facilities much but the check in staff were lovely, the chambermaids all said good morning, and the restaurant/lounge area was always packed out. we could see that The Montague had a decent lunch time menu on - 2 courses plus a glass of wine for £18 but we were never in this area at lunchtime. The bar is also busy and pretty lively but again very expensive. They add 12.5 % on drinks here too and 2 halves of lager cost us £8. We saw one young American man in a state of shock after standing a round of drinks for his group. A couple of them had ordered brandies and we could see that they hadn't come cheap. lol. 
You are only 5 minutes walk from Oxford st and The Marble Arch tube and Marylebone highstreet is only 10 minutes away. The Wallace collection is just over the square, a block past the park and it is wonderful. I urge you all to go here - the atmosphere is fantastic, the exhibits great and the restaurant/cafe looked good too. It is free - so you have no excuses. Well not the restaurant - obviously. 
Probably the best all round hotel I have stayed in in London - if I could get the deal I would definitely go back.",5,2009,04,10
150,Even at the price... worth it,"I stayed five nights this month at the Hyatt Regency Churchill. While somewhat unimaginative '50's square brick design, the Churchill offered quite a comfortable relaxing stay. The room was kept clean and fresh by the efficient invisible housekeeping staff. The front desk, doorman, and concierge staff where helpful and knowledgible. All guests are treated with respect and courtesy, even the high dollar ahh... ""professional lady"" (very obvious) that checked in ahead of me (no luggage ;-) ).

The hotel is in the high dollar Marble Arch area with a lot of good restaurants and a fabulous lebanese grocery store (Green Valley?) just a couple blocks down the street. There is good access to the Marble Arch tube station a couple blocks away. And naturally, it is just off one of the main shopping streets in London as well as one of the nicest park areas.

I wish I could speak about the fitness area, but I was a total slob that week.

My room was on the 5th floor and looked out the back side of the hotel. It was very quiet and comfortable. The ~40 inch flat screen tv had the usual limited channels you see in London hotels... half in english. There was plenty of work space in the room and internet access is available via wired or wireless access. I usually never sleep well after a long flight to a new hotel room, but not so in this case... the bed was very nice and helped significantly in the 6 hour time transition.

It is sad that the Hyatt has moved to the modern ""jiggle something in the minibar and you've bought it"" system. It really inhibits guest use of that space, and with such a good nearby grocery, it is a shame at this location.

I would stay here again for business, but I would book early to get the cheapest rate. It is hard to justify the value of this location when there are very good hotels in London at much less per night. You pay for the area here, not just the room, and yes, it is worth it. I hope to stay there again soon.",4,2009,03,25
150,Great location - luxuriously appointed,"Stayed on the fourth floor in a king sized room, the room was quite large, modern and elegantly decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had a great nights sleep and even though we were by the lift we couldn't hear anything. The air conditioning in the room was easy to use and effective (had a few bad experiences getting the temperature right in other hotels).

The staff were all very professional and friendly, the food beautifully cooked and the entire hotel from reception to hallways were all emaculate and thoughtfully designed. Well deserved 5 star hotel and will look for Hyatt brand in future wherever we go.",5,2009,03,02
150,Luxury hotel in great location,"Stayed here for 1 night for a weekend in London.  The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street and near to Marble Arch and so the location for shopping/sight seeing is excellent.

The hotel was refitted last year and so is in excellent condition, the communal areas of the hotel are luxuriously appointed and a great blend of modern and traditional.

The check-in and check out was swift and all staff that we encountered were polite and well trained.  Particularly the door men.

We stayed in a king room (on the 4th floor) the room was a good size, well decorated and very clean.  The bed was huge (bigger than a king!)and extremely comfortable, with a memory foam mattress and luxurious bedding.

The hotel was everything that we expected of a 5* London hotel bearing the Hyatt brand and we were not disappointed at all.  Afterall, anything that is good enough for a President (Barak Obama stayed here late last year during his trip to the UK) is good enough for me!",5,2009,02,16
150,Great location,"Stayed here for just one night in a seventh floor room overlooking Portman Square.  The room was on the small side, especially the bathroom, but was very clean and nicely decorated.  We ate in the Churchill Bar, which was good, if a bit pricey, with a very traditional ""clubby"" feel.  The location, just at the back of Oxford Street is excellent.  We used the car park, which again is expensive at £30, but it seemed secure.  The gym on the second floor is small; however, it is well equipped.",4,2009,02,15
150,A genuine 21st century international hotel,"This was my second stay at The Churchill in the last 12 months and the experience just gets better. No 'faded glory' here, the hotel is smart, state of the art, thoroughly comtemporary. The rooms are beautifully furnished, the beds are great with top quality bedding and the heating/air conditioning works well. I would reccomend The Churchill for a business stopover or a longer, leisure trip, transport links to all parts of London are fine and there are great restaurants/pubs to be discovered in nearby Marylebone.

The staff deserve a special mention, they cannot do enough to help.",5,2009,01,30
150,Beautiful hotel & great experience,"I just got back from a 5-night stay at The Churchill.  It was a wonderful experience, and I will probably never stay at any other hotel in London.  From the moment the elegantly-clad doorman opens your taxi door on arrival until he puts you in a taxi at the end, you are treated with great kindness, respect, and personalized service.  You would maybe expect this at a 5-star hotel, but in my experience, you don't always get anything close.  I stayed on the Regency Club floor in a corner room facing the rear of the hotel.  It was very quiet and I'd recommend you request a corner if you enjoy peace and quiet.  The hotel is on quiet Portman Square, a short walk to the shopping on Oxford Street and to the Marble Arch tube station at the corner of Hyde Park, so it's very easy to navigate anywhere you want to go in London.  It's less than 10 minutes by taxi (and less than 10 GBP) from the Heathrow Express at Paddington Station.  Excellent location.  All staff is pleasant and eager to serve. I loved the Regency Club--breakfast every morning of lovely items like fresh croissants & other pastries, cold meats, cereals, fresh fruit, tea, coffee, juice, etc., all in a classy serene setting appointed with fine china, linen, etc.  Evening cocktail hour is equally impressive, with wines, champagne, cocktail makings, meats, a cheese/fruit board, etc.  And they have fabulous coffee!  The room was perhaps a bit small by American standards, but beautifully decorated with marble bath, TV, and the most comfortable bed and pillows of any hotel I've ever stayed in.  Yes, it's pricey, but for even a once-in-a-lifetime experience, you can't beat the Chuchill for a restful, pampering stay, a lovely respite from frantic tourism.  I absolutely loved it!",5,2009,01,19
150,It's A Pretty Getaway,"I ended up here on the last three days of my European adventure. I wanted a little luxury to round out the trip. My room was really a lot smaller than I expected. It was quiet and clean, but not the best service. I felt as though the staff were a bit snotty.  My bed was comfy but not as new as I would have expected from a fancy-schmantz-y place like the Hyatt.  The location was good, near the tube and there was a lot within walking distance. I really didn't spend much time in the room, but is had all that you'd expect, nice TV channels, and well lit bath. In general, a nice end to my journey.",4,2009,01,11
150,"Great Hotel, Great location","I stayed at this property last July when a buddy of mine and I went to London for three days to enjoy the city.

We arrived early in the morning before our room was completely ready. I was staying on the concierge level so we had coffee and complimentary breakfast in the lounge. 

The hotel wasnt booked full so we were able to get into the room by around 10:00am. 

Quite a spacious room for London. I was sharing with my friend so I booked a corner suite with 2 beds. 

The hotel is recently renovated and so the room was excellent. 

There was a living room upon entrance with a couch and two chairs as well as a spacious corner desk. Also a nice little bar area against the wall and a flat panel TV. Quite a large space actually.There was also a two piece bathroom off of the living room. 

The bedroom was small and had two single beds and a flat panel TV mounted from the ceiling.

The main bathroom was very large and had a seperate shower, bathtub, and the normal items. It was spacious and very modern and elegant. 

The staff were very good but as we were two guys roaming around London, we didnt spend much time in the hotel. 

I would reccomend the concierge level thought as it has a great breakfast room in the morning and nice little appetizers in the evening. 

The room service was very good and the fish and chips were awesome. 

I think I paid about $1100.00 Cdn per night. Londons not cheap but this was a very large room and the hotel is in a great location.  Very close to Hyde Park.",5,2008,11,14
150,"Luxury, Service & Super Location","I loved this hotel. I stayed in 3 different hotels in London over 10 nights. The Hyatt Churchill was the best. I caught a red eye from Boston and needed to get some sleep. The Hyatt let us check in at 8:00 am! The lobby and the restaurant were very luxurious and posh with a fireplace. The Bed was fantastic, perfect for the weary traveler.  Everyone at the Hyatt bent over backward to accomodate our needs.  

I was on the 6th floor facing the street and we could here the city noise slightly. I would recommend asking for a back room for quiet which is typical in this city for any hotel.

There is a private park (like in the Notting Hill movie) accross the hotel. The location is great for walking to shopping and dining. The underground is close by and there are always taxis out front.

I would love to stay here again.",5,2008,11,10
150,"Clean, comfortable, and good location","The hotel was clean and accomodating, nothing over the ordinary. The Lobby was not impressive. The restaurant in the hotel was so so. The food was not great. Great location near marble arch and close walking distance to shopping. Being an American tourist I was a bit shocked that the hotel was swamped with extreamly religious Muslims in full dressings, not that I am against these people but I was slightly uncomfortable as a woman to walk around showing any skin. I wouldn't book my next stay at the Hyatt but it was a great vacation.",4,2008,10,14
150,Keep Going Back!,I have now stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions. The service is extremely good and rooms are much better than average for central London. Perfect for business and pleasure (Oxford Street is 2 minutes away). Make sure you treat yourself to a meal at Locanda Locatelli in the hotel foyer - a real treat - fantastic!,5,2008,09,22
150,Average stay,"I stayed here 1st & 2nd September. The rooms have recently been refurbished but my room was very small.
The service was dreadful and not very attentive.
There were constant problems with the lifts, and on a couple of occassions we were lead to the service lifts.
Breakfast was average. Warm food had run out when I went down for 8 am and had not been refilled. 
Overall a poor experience and poor value for money.",2,2008,09,09
150,An ok hotel for London - but not at the normal Hyhatt standard,"I stayed with the Hyatt only one night from 1st-2nd sep 2008.
It is a typical London, naming itself 5 star hotel. Its well located, quite big and relativly calm. My experiance with the staff was a good one, everybody at the reception was kind and helpfull. I hosted a group of 20 persons and the hotel provided us a separate room to handle the check in procedure the smartest way they can.  To avoid a 6 GBP fee for using the internet only to check in for the next day the concierge printed out my boarding pass- good! The rooms are ok, at the breakfast - which is taking place in a huge room- we waited far too long for even for a coffee as well as for butter, baked beans and others commodities. 
All in all I would go there again knowing that you should never ecpect too much from a London hotel in general and that they will never reach a true 5 star standard.
(nor did the Ritz or the Savoy)",3,2008,09,04
150,Would like to love it but service to random ...,"The hotel is newly renovated with comfortable with all conveniences. Well situated close to Hyde Park and West End while still most often offering a reasonable value for being in a London Hotel. So I would like to like it a lot and make it my hotel of choice in London ...

However and unfortunately, the service and especially the front desk staff is just too poor and uninterested in you as a guest. Do not be surprised to wait for the three staff members in the front desk to finish their internal admin for 5-10 min while you as a guest have to wait to check in. They will also pick up the phone and engage with the guest online while you have to wait, clearly less of a priority. Last time I stayed all the elevators broke down, which can happen anywhere but it was too much Faulty Towers for my taste having the manager scream to the repair men in front of several guests in the lobby ...",2,2008,08,29
150,Terrible For Families,"We tried to book a SUITE at the Hyatt for a family of four, two adults and two young children aged 4 and 2 - the receptionist adivsed us it was a UK legal policy not to allow more than 3 persons to a room.
Was quite surprised as able to book other hotel ROOMs which seemed to accomodate four of us.

Instead we had to take two connecting rooms which was not exactly suitable as we would still end up using one room as both our young kids were definitely not going to sleep in a separate room especially in strange surroundings. However we thought we would still give it a go as we were familiar with that part of town having lived there before. We did write a letter to management explaining our circumstances and querying the legal point - and if we could have the suite instead - not even a courtesy of a reply was afforded to us even after following the first non-reply with a telephone call to the concierge!

But sadly we decided to proceed with the our booking thinking we would try to make the best of things as we chose the hotel for its location.

We arrived after a long trip, to be dealt with by a dour looking receptionist - the only saving grace was the wonderful doorman (who seemed to have a 101 duties) and the porter who brought our luggage up.

Lifts were not working, and the place seemed to be in shambles generally - with a market like atmosphere when we first arrived in the evening.

We had two rooms, but it seemed only one seemed cleaned as we found an empty shoe box under the bed and dust everywhere.

It was also the first time I contemplated rushing out to buy our own towels as some of them were almost BLACK.  

Only saving grace was the breakfast which seemed to offer quite a variety of foods but not cheap as £25 per head.  

They even wanted to charge the children, aged 2 and 4 for breakfast depending on whom you spoke to - from full price to free. 

To cut a long story short, we checked out after two nights to the delightful 'Langham Hotel' off Oxford Circus which actually offered a far superior location than the Hyatt than I had originally imagined with superb restaurants and coffee shops on its doorstep.

To think we had hesitated booking that in the first place because it was having works undertaken - we did not even notice the works whilst there!",1,2008,08,29
150,Where's the local Beer?,"This hotel has a great location.  It's a 5 Pound cab ride from Paddington station so access to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express is very convenient.  It's 2 blocks from Oxford Street and the area contained numerous dining options.  Plenty of things to see within walking distance of the hotel.

My room was on the Club level (8th Floor).  It was average size but clean.  The bed was very comfortable and the shampoo, soap, etc. were all above average.

The Concierge was outstanding and very helpful.

During my stay, one of the elevators was out of service which turned out to be a bit of a nuisance as all hotel guests scrambled to use the single working elevator.  The hotel staff should've pointed out the nearest stairwell.  

My only real gripe with this hotel is the lack of British beer or ale in either the hotel bar or Regency Club lounge.  It would've been nice to have at least one local option.  I can easily get Budweiser at home.

Overall a decent hotel in a great location.",4,2008,08,19
150,A most impressive hotel in central London,"We stayed one night on Hyatt points, and were impressed (after a slow check-in) to be upgraded to a large suite overlooking Portman Place.  The hotel staff are very well trained, and the hotel itself is spotless and beautifully appointed.  Our room service arrived quickly and was very nicely served.  Breakfast in the club lounge was pleasant - although more choice could be included.  The location (a couple of blocks from Oxford Street, but in a quiet square) is marvellous.  We would highly recommend this place, if you can get a good rate (or use Hyatt points!).",5,2008,08,17
150,MANY issues!,"Stayed here for what was to be the ""perfect vacation"" only to have it RUINED by the horrible management at this hotel. 

I reserved (5 months in advance) a suite, and a second regular room.  I confirmed these arrangements as we had family traveling with us, and would like to entertain in the evenings in our suite, which was reserved and confirmed! 

The suite was listed as ""53 sq meters"" on the website.  Other offered ammenities were free fruit and mineral water.  This room we felt would fit our needs.  

Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were SHOCKED to hear from the desk agent that ""we are giving you a FREE upgrade to two connecting rooms!""  This was totally unacceptable to us, but we were informed that no other rooms were available, and this is what we must be happy with.  

Rooms given were tiny, and stated as 18 square meteres each.  This was a total of only 66% of the size reserved and PAID FOR!!  Also, no area to entertain was available.  Management did not want to respond that evening (Saturday checkin) but wanted to wait until Monday to respond.  Check out was Tuesday.  We were told to take the sub-par rooms or leave (and still be billed, as it was past cancellation time).  

Never were we given an option to be booked into another close hotel-many Marriotts/Hiltons and even another Hyatt property were close.  

The stay from checkin got worse.  Both locks on the doors did not work.  The staff was very unattentative (with the exception of the Regency Club staff).  The interior of the rooms overall was not indicative of hotel commanding a premium price.  I have stayed in many London hotels for the same or less money, and have had much nicer accomodations.

Upper management did meet me late in the evening on Monday and explained that the hotel allows guests to have very flexible stays, and someone wanted to extend their stay, so that is why we did not have a room available for us, even though we were confirmed into the Suite.

My advise is to pick one of the many other GREAT options in London, and beware of the many issues at this hotel and with the staff-including upper management.",1,2008,08,16
150,"Great location, overall nice hotel but..","Overall, the Hyatt Churchill is a nice hotel.  It is in a fantastic location.  If you exit the front doors and go left and back, you head toward Marble Arch/Hyde Park and the Tube stop there.  If you go right and back, you head towards a more centralized Tube stop on Oxford Street.  But, either way, the tube is, flat out, the best and only way to travel quickly, efficiently, economically and safely in London.  (TIP: if you are going to be there for more than 2 days and use the Tube, get an Oyster card).  The police station is right across the street, so that adds some safety and general wellbeing to the place.  It is within a 5-10 min walk to pubs, restaurants of all variety, souvenir shops, internet cafes, Selfridge's Department Store, pharmacies, grocery stores, Marks & Spencer outlets, and about anything you would want to do.  It is just an excellent location.  As with all of London, be prepared for some serious walking but the payoff is there with all of London right there.  

The hotel is very impressive and well maintained in the lobby.  The rooms show a little more age but are still nice.  The rooms are a nice size.  The bathrooms are nice and supposed to be state of the art in shower/rub design.  It is a highly confusing shower system, though.  It is so confusing there are actual directions in the in room guide to the hotel, however, if you follow them, it is a simple process to operate the shower.  Two more things with the bathroom are that the shower/tub area is inordinately deep, so for anyone short, getting in and out of the shower is a scary affair.  To that end, I fell whilst getting in the shower one morning, even with the mat on the shower floor placed.  So, just be careful.  Secondly, they have a strange half door, glass partition that is to operate as a shower curtain but ends up letting a great deal of water on the bathroom floor.  If you plan an extra towel to be placed on the floor in advance of your shower, that should help.  

The hotel staff were all very polite.  The cleaning staff in our room did an outstanding job in our room each day, sometimes, multiple times throughout the day.   We had a large king bed in our room which was very comfortable.  We never got the hang of the a/c unit in the room but that is more on us than the Hyatt.  But, it worked well.  We did not eat at the hotel's restaurants as the prices were way beyond what we were willing to pay when we could walk 2 or 3 blocks out of the hotel for the same exact thing.  The internet prices were absolutely ridiculous, however.  I believe it came to $12 USD per hour or $25 USD per day (unlimited).  That is insane when you can walk 2-3 blocks away to an internet cafe for $2/hr.  There was one oddilty that happened earlier in May to another reviewer and the same thing happened on our last night there.  The fire alarm (which does not sound loudly or sound like a fire alarm) went off around 1am.  It sounded more like an alarm clock going off in the next room rather dully.  After 10 minutes, I called the front desk and was told it was a fire alarm and we were to vacate.  Why they would not contact each room is beyond me if it were not a true fire emergency, rather than wait ten minutes for me or countless others to call, is beyond me.  The same thing happened to another person two weeks earlier, so whatever the issue, it had not been resolved.",4,2008,08,11
150,Complete Sham,"Very substandard. We were traveling with my older mother-in-law and requested rooms near each other. They put us on the same floor but opposite endsof the building - not at all near each other.  They were not able to move us closer together because the hotel was full. I was told by management that the hotel was totally full with middle eastern families who come for several months at a time to get away from the summer heat in the middle east. Our rooms were next to all of the spoiled children and their nannies. We heard screaming, yelling children (not babies but older kids) throughout our entire stay.  The people that shared our hallway would go shopping and discard all of their shopping rubbish by dumping it in the hall outside their doorway so the hallways were always full of trash. This is unacceptable for a Hyatt at 400+ Euros/Nt.  Not to mention we requested non-smoking and the room had clearly been smoked in as it  reeked of cigarettes. The service here is inferior - it had the feel of a holiday inn. Upon checkout we called for our bags to be taken to the lobby after 25 minutes of waiting called again, after another 5 minutes I took the bags ourself as we had a flight to catch. When asked for restaurant recommendations the concierge would only recommend their own hotel restaurant.  Just plain BAD",1,2008,07,28
150,"Great Place, Great Staff, But Pricey","This is either my third or fourth lengthy stay at the Churchill, on business, and the second stay since the extensive renovations.  The staff is top-notch, especially the concierges Dave and Nicholas and doorman Bobby.  You can't beat it for location.  The Tube at Marble Arch or at Bond Street is only a 5 minute walk, Marks & Spencer and Selfridges are 2-3 blocks away for grocery as well as department store shopping, Hyde Park only 5 minutes walk (and great for an evening stroll when the sun stays out till 10 PM in summer).  Good dining choices are at James Street/St . Christopher Street between Wigmore and Oxford Streets.  Buses run in front of hotel up to Regent's Park (Sherlock Holmes Museum, Madame Tussaud's etc), and any busline you want to go anywhere stops at Marble Arch/Oxford Street.  As to room, the only complaints are 1) the dangerous tubs (very high sides) - I slipped one night even with two grab bars (I brought 1 along) and 2) I also was not located well and heard restaurant clean-up late at night (breaking glass being dumped into dumpster).  Rooms are small by American standards, but spotlessly clean and beautiful linens.  I really enjoyed the new plasma tv and the ability to do broadband Internet on it (saved bringing along a PC), although a bit pricey for some at US$10 for 24 hours.  ""Full"" tea (US: high tea) is nicely done but pricey.  It was very cold and wet in early July, and I enjoyed tea by the  Montagu room fireside.  As a female business traveler, I always feel safe commuting here in late evenings; cannot say that for other areas of London where I've stayed.",5,2008,07,23
150,Excellent hotel with great location,"We stayed at the Churchill in June for 3 nights, the hotel is very clean and very convenient.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, and service was excellent.   We had dinner at the restaurant Montagu, the food and service was excellent but it is expensive.  The Churchill bar was good but kind of stuffy and prepare to pay for the drinks.  There are a lot of restaurants and bars around that they are worth the visit.",5,2008,07,16
150,Comfortable Lodgings 10 mins from Oxford St or Marylebone,"This is a large hotel on Portman Square, an easy 10 minute or less walk to Oxford Street or the charm or Marylebone High Street.  Be prepared to pay for the location and ammenties.  Rooms were running at 300 pounds and up during our stay (on points thank goodness).  Staff were friendly and accomodating.  The lobby is always hopping with international travelers.  Rooms are done in the understated Hyatt style and feature very comfortable beds and modern bathrooms.  Breakfast is an outrageous 30 pounds if you do not have it included in your room rate;  the choice is extensive, but 30 pounds?  The room service continental breakfast is actually better value at 15 pounds.  Would love to stay here again but not on my nickle.",5,2008,07,13
150,Great place in the west end,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency the Churchill for 6 nights in June. The hotel was wonderful and had a great location on the west end in London. To say that London is an expensive place to stay for Americans is an understatement. If you enjoy true 5 star accommodations, and plan to stay in London for 6 nights at the present time you can stay here for $405 per night including tax and breakfast. Book the stay on the British Air web site. You can do this without booking airfare. Last I checked the same rate on the Hyatt site is over $700.

We had a standard room on the 7th floor with a police station view. They charge extra for the Portman square view, but these are actually smaller rooms, and get more noise. All the rooms are very similar with the same furniture and baths, and are exactly as shown on the Hyatt site. The beds are wonderful!! The hotels breakfast buffet is huge, and great if included in the rate, otherwise it is $50 per person. 

The hotel has a great location about two blocks north of Selfridge’s, Oxford Street, and the Marble Arch. Everything you need including 3 tube stations are within walking distance. Oxford Street is very crowded, and reminds you of New York. The British food is as bad as advertised. Seeing Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London definitely made the trip worthwhile. Seeing London makes you want to get back to Paris!",5,2008,06,29
150,Pretty good after it's renovated,"I've stayed at this hotel before it was renovated and after, and what a difference it makes.  Before, the hotel's rooms did not look nice at all, the bedding, bathroom and lighting were all old and kinda dirty.  But after renovation, I applaud the hotel.  Everything looked clean and the room looked brighter as well.  LCD TV (albeit not too large of a screen), view of the park, comfortable bed and pillows.  
The room size is pretty decent for a London hotel, breakfast could have more variety, but other than that, I would absolutely go there again and would recommend this hotel to others as well.",4,2008,06,28
150,Totally Wonderful,"I spent 7 nights at the Churchill at the end of last month and the beginning of this month.
From the moment I was greeted at the front desk till the day I checked, out the entire experience was divine.
I was in London for a conference and the organisers had booked my room. A basic room only, but with a very comfortable King bed
flat screen TV, very smart and beutifully clean room. The bathroom was excellent, products of good quality and housemaids the best around. My TV came unplugged and they sent two repair men in a matter of minutes to fix it. I was ironing a shirt at the time and one of the repair said that the iron I was using was to old and replaced it as well.The standard of presentation throughout the hotel was excelllent.
My only comment, not a complaint is that the closet space is small, but while I was there they were putting in bigger closets in the rooms on the 6th floor.
The staff wonderful and the location excellent. This was my first time staying on this side of Oxford St as I normally stay at the Mayfair Hilton and was worried it would be too far away from everything. It is not, it is perfect.
Looking forward to staying again in November.",5,2008,06,25
150,Nice island of sanity -- I stay here often,"This is a really nice place to stay amidst the hustle and bustle of London. The location is really pretty with a gorgeous little park out front.   Classic London. The insides of the hotel are about as modern as any I have stayed in in London and everything works well. The lobby is clean, and has gorgeous flower arrangements.  There are a lot of Middle Eastern customers (Dubai, Kuwait etc.) so this adds a touch of exotica to an otherwise pretty traditional place.   I love the Churchill and would recommend it unhesitatingly. The only place where I would give the Churchill a slight ding is that it is a bit pricey for what you get (sigh... London...) and that the service is not exactly stellar all the time (no real complaints but they are a bit jaded).  One time my AC stopped cooling and it took them quite a while to get it fixed...

Stay here if you can. It's a nice place.",4,2008,06,20
150,Great Hotel - Terrible Value,"Felt old school (in a good way) but with entirely modern innards (rooms, amenities, service).

Stayed on a Regency Club Floor (on points) and was very impressed with the check in, which involved a person escorting us to the regency club floor and handing us off, once checked in at the desk there the front desk person then escorted us to the room and pointed out the features....very nice. Indicated that we needed a child's cot/crib and an army of five people showed up at our door to re-organize the room to accommodate the cot.

Room was immaculate and the hallway upkeep (paint -carpets ect)  were top notch...which isn't always the case in some of the other 4-5 star properties in London. Regency club is nice but it certainly isn't worth the extra 100 pounds which brings me to the only downside.

Look, I know it's London - its expensive and the American Peso keeping its value very well right now....but $600+ (at best) a night for a non-resort hotel....wow! That’s pretty breathtakingly expensive. I think I can deal with a shabby hallway carpet for a $100 reduction in the room rate.  

The only other pet peeve is that you are charged 15 pounds for 24 hours of internet access....Which is ridiculous when you are paying 300 pounds a night for a hotel! Internet access should be free at all full service hotels, just like television or shampoo in the showers.

My only other comment is that as it is a hyatt there are quite a few Americans and fewer locals...and seemingly on my trip quite a few germans, both as guests and as staff (which might have something to do with the upkeep of the hotel).",5,2008,06,02
150,Great hotel with exceptional service,"I have just returned from the third stay at The Churchill since January, 2008.  The service is fantastic, room's lovely and this hotel offers all modern amenities.  I am a picky business traveler and would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Another advantage, it is very close to March Arch tube station (Central line) and Oxford Street (wonderful shopping) if you are not worried about the exchange rate.  

Jacqueline Smith",5,2008,05,04
150,Loved the Hyatt!,"My family (one adult and three teenagers) stayed in two rooms at the Hyatt in March. The rooms were both very comfortable and clean, room service was quick and delicious, front desk and concierge staff was extremely helpful with currency exchange, play tickets and directions!  
The location was fabulous - a quick walk to the underground, Hyde Park (enjoyed a beautiful early morning walk through the park) and there were coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Also was just a short walk to the ""Red Bus"" tours.
Would definitely stay here again!",5,2008,04,23
150,Good..Not excellent,"Stayed at the Hyatt in december 2007 and was..satisfied.

I travel to London on business once a month and this time chose to stay at the Hyatt as it is close to Oxford Street. Ive stayed in this hotel before when it was under the Intercontinental banner and was pleasantly surprised at the service. The hotel however was recently renovated. 

On arrival i was upgraded to the Portman View King room which was comfortable but rather small..I was expecting a more plush setting with luxury amenties but boy was i dissapointed. I was expecting more for my pounds.I paid around 350 pounds inclusive of breakfast and found myself in the typical hotel chain atmosphere.I usually stay at the Ritz and the Dorchestor and enjoy the service which oozes individuality

There was no turn down service, no individual welcome as i am a Hyatt member and absolutely no friendly approach from any of the staff.

On a rather positive note the breakfast was splendid! there was a large selection and modern setting.Absolutely worth paying extra for.

All in all i'd advise that if you are indeed looking for a plush, service orientated hotel look else where",3,2008,03,27
150,"OK hotel, good service","I was fairly pleased with my stay here. The hotel is OK with slightly less than adequate facilities for a 5 star, however the service is very good. Being a Londoner Im not a huge fan of the location although Im sure a lot of tourists get off on being so close to Oxford Street. The great thing about the hotel though is that it is next to Locanda Locatelli, the italian restaurant. This means that after dining in the finest Italian restaurant in the UK you dont have far to stagger home. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didnt eat here during your stay.",4,2008,02,29
150,Churchill Value An Issue,"My wife and I stayed at the Churchill for five nights in February, 2008.  The hotel is above average in appearance and in a good location near two Tube stops.  London is expensive by any standards but the Churchill rates don't quite match the accomodations.  Upon arrival, despite a 300 pound rate, we were pitched two upgrades (room with a view and the Regency Club) which would have driven the rate to closer to 400 pounds.  We are always tempted to stay with a known chain on foreign trips but you could do better value wise than this Hyatt.",3,2008,02,20
150,amazing - the most softest bedding ever........,"one word -amazing

couldnt fault a thing.

bed soooooooo comfy, we have a large superking size bed at home so its lovely to have that comfort when away.

hotel, food, restaurant, ambience - all wonderful.",5,2008,02,20
150,"Once again, a great experience","Stayed for one night visiting London on business. Came to Hyatt Churchill after a gap of over 1.5 years - but happy to state that things have improved. The room I got was renovated - much better in terms of furnishings & light colour schemes. But what stands out is the service levels - the welcome one gets from the guy at the door when my limo drove in to the smile & friendly attitude at the front desk to the helpful conceirge - the waiters in the coffee shop, etc. It was a wonderful experience. I like the location - just behind Oxford Street - enables combining business & leisure effectively. Would strongly recommend the Hotel to all business travellers - as for me, am definitely going back there !",5,2008,01,28
150,Very Impressed,"Decided to have a last minute trip to London, theatre and site seeing. Chose a 'Secret Hotel' on the last minute website and got the Churchill. 
Lovely, clean, excellent service. 
Staff were very helpful and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. 
Room was of a good size, clean and with an opening window! Very unusual in London these days. 
Within easy walking distance to Oxford Street and the parks, but set in a quiet square.
We had a brilliant stay and would love to return.",5,2008,01,27
150,Definitely worth considering,"I often wonder why American hotel chains in Europe are often better managed than those in the US - take the Hyatt London the Churchill for an example. I arrived last weekend for a one night stay, very early in the morning, definitely not expecting to be roomed immediately. Their computer system was being upgraded, and they got my reservation and rates all confused (I was informed that the entire Hyatt system in Europe was being upgraded that weekend). Everything had to be done by hand. 

Surprisingly, the room was available (although I am not sure whether it was the room originally intended for me - no bottled water [Hyatt Gold Passport], missing towels, etc).

The TV was also not functioning (only local TV channels with radio). Two engineering representatives showed up at my doorstep within 3 minutes and were eventually told by the front desk that since the computer system was ""down"", guests were not ""officially"" being checked-in, so the TV system would not be fully functional. As I was staying at a package rate (shopping voucher with a bottle of champagne), the voucher and champagne were eventually delivered by another hotel staff about 20 minutes of my arrival. So, all in all, no big deal, I will just go do some shopping.

When I returned at 4pm, the computer system was still ""down"". When I found out from the in-room directory that the hotel carries DVD players, I called the operator to request for one. First, I was told that the hotel doesn't carry one, then I was informed that the hotel does carry DVD players, but it would cost me another 25 GBP. Well, I had to request for a waiver since I couldn't help that their computer and TV system is down. A third phone call informed me that the manager has authorized a fee-waiver. Why such complication?

When I checked out the following morning, the computer system was still ""down"", and once again, I was charged the wrong rate. The front desk staff was unable to retrieve my ""handwritten"" check-in form, so they couldn't offer me the correct rate, even thought she had my printed confirmation (that reflects the correct rate) in front of her. At 6am, I didn't feel I have the energy to argue with her.

When I returned to the US, I was informed by Hyatt central reservations to contact the accounting office back at the hotel in London. Although not expecting much to come out of the e-mail to the accounting office as I am already out of the country, I did get a response from the hotel, apologizing for their computer problems, and informing me of the refund. That was a surprise (or were we travelers conditioned not to expect too much if things don't turn out right?)

Overall, the location of the London Hyatt was good -  a couple blocks from Oxford Street, a 5 minute walk from Selfridge's and the tube station. The staff was pleasant, particularly the engineering folks who wouldn't rest until they figured out what was wrong with my TV, or the Regency Club concierge who was equally concerned about my missing shopping voucher and the bottle of champagne not being already in the room prior to me checking in. 

Prior to checking in into the Hyatt I had spent a week at the Dorchester. Although the food at Alain Ducasse was up-to-par, the overall atmosphere was slightly more stuffy, the hotel staff much more reserved, and the nightly papparazzi hanging outside the hotel made getting in and out of the hotel rather difficult.  

So, I will definitely consider revisiting the London Hyatt next time I am in town. Their rates are definitely reasonable, and although one can find lower rates within the same area of town, I think this hotel is worth considering.",4,2008,01,23
150,ok but overpriced,This is a nice hotel but being london overpriced for what it is. The churchill bar is very nice and relaxing . The service was not as good as it should be for the class of the hotel and some staff seemed a little unsure of themselves when when approached. This was more than noticeable at breakfast with orders being misplaced and some disorganisation. The location is good . Would only stay again with a great deal.,4,2008,01,20
150,Very nice hotel,"We stayed here one night on Jan 1st on a promotional Hyatt reward.  Very nice hotel - similar to the renovated American Hyatts - modern decor, flat screen TVs, dark woods and colors.  We were even upgraded to a Portman Square view.  Room was quiet - staff was extremely friendly and helpful - only downside was that it seemed a ways out - mostly shopping but not many restaurants nearby.  Marble Arch tube only 3 blocks away.",5,2008,01,02
150,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel (as you would expect for 5*!), good location, room was large and nicely furnished.

Got a good deal online, otherwise would be too expensive.",4,2007,12,31
150,If not for the exchange rate....,"We stayed on points for a short four night get away and  had a really good experience at the Churchill.  It is within walking distance of many of the sites and parks and the Underground is only two blocks away.

Would definitely recommend the club level.  The service here is great.  Frankly there were some pretty obnoxious guests making ridiculous demands and the staff took it all in stride and remained gracious and helpful.  I needed to get to an internet terminal and they actually insisted on bringing me a laptop during breakfast to save me going to the business center.  Breakfast is free as are drinks and nice snacks every evening in the club.  With the killer exchange rate dollars to pounds this provided some welcome savings.

Rooms were big by European standards and very nicely furnished.  It was somewhat noisy in the hallways and there is not much soundproofing between rooms.  

The restaurants were very good but like the rest of the hotel a bit formal and we felt a little out of place not being in business attire

We would consider coming back especially if it were a business trip and someone else was paying the bill.  Fifteen dollars for one hour on the internet,  twenty five dollars for a glass of wine  and thirty dollars for an in room movie is pretty steep but that's mostly due to exchange.",4,2007,12,21
150,Ideal Business Hotel,"I was in London on business for three days. Arrived late evening at Gatwick after a nine hour long flight. Took Gatwick Express to Victoria and then a taxi to the hotel. Check-in was quite fast. Staff at reception was very courteous and efficient. The room had plenty of freshness and one could make out the moment one would enter. It was very spacious, bathroom with nice fittings and above average toiletries fitted the bill. Bed was sublimely comfortable with nice pillows, one really looks forward to after a long journey. Only thing missing in the room was bottled drinking water on a complimentary basis. However, early morning tea of your choice could be served in your room free if you are a Hyatt Goldpassport member. Breakfast served in the ground floor Montagu eatery was quite well spread out but expensive even by London standard. The location of the hotel is just perfect for those who have work in central London. Taxis, underground (Marble Arch underground is just a few minutes walk away) and buses are readily available at doorstep. Hotel concierge was always found to be very friendly and helpful. All in all, a good choice for central London stay but at a good price.",4,2007,12,14
150,Excellent hotel with great service,"We spent 4 nights at the Churchill and would definitely recommend it. Obviously has been renovated so it has a brand-new feel. The rooms are very spacious for London, well-appointed and tasteful. The room was also very quiet with a terrific comfortable bed.  The staff was extremely courteous and helpful; food was very good; room service was unbelievably speedy. Location was good--close to the tube, and a good spot for a nice walk down Park Lane to Knightsbridge.
If we had to say anything negative about this hotel, it would be only that it is definitely a Hyatt Regency, a business--friendly chain hotel--so if one were looking for a charming London hotel with true character and a true English feel, this would not be my first pick. But all in all, a wonderful stay.",4,2007,11,24
150,Great Experience!,"We stayed 3 nights at the Hyatt Churchill. This was our first trip to London and found the Churchill to be in a good location (a few blocks from the Marble Arch tube station) and very nice. I was expecting a very small, drab room based on what I'd heard about London. Our room was very spacious, clean, and updated.  We were very pleased!!!",4,2007,11,19
150,Great Hotel,"Stayed in Regency Club room which was very nice. Staff were great, nothing too much trouble for them. Room was good size (big for some London hotels). Club lounge excellent. Location was ideal. Notice some postings re price, well it is the centre of London (not the cheapest city in the world) and is a 5* hotel. If people feel it is too expensive they can always stay elsewhere.
We will be back there",5,2007,10,30
150,Fantastic location and nice hotel,"I stayed here for one night on a business trip. The hotel is fairly new, offers great service and the staff was very efficient and nice. It's not cheap (£200+ per night) but the location is fantastic (right on the Portman Square and as Home House is almost next door, you can also do a bit of celeb spotting). 
I had a double room and it was very nice, the overall style is very Hyatt; clean, comfy and great bathroom.  My only comment is that the walls are very thin, there was a baby next door who was crying most of the night. Food and drink was all of very high quality.",4,2007,09,26
150,"Great room (freshly renovated), great location!","Stayed at the Hyatt Churchill in London last weekend and was happy to see that there were no hints of any hotel renovation/construction work underway.

We stayed in a Regency Club suite on the 8th floor (the new Club check-in desk is here too), and it was very well appointed.  Very comfortable bed -- it was just as nice as being at home.  

The room had a refreshing view of Portman Square (nice park, trees, etc.) which was a treat being in the heart of London.

Hotel is only a +/-5 minute walk from the Marble Arch tube station, and a block off from Oxford Street so there's a lot of shopping opportunities in close proximity.

The Regency Club was bright and comfortable.  The breakfast/evening snacks on offer were OK, but not a huge selection.

A couple things that I didn't like was the price of the Internet access (£5 for one hour, or £15 per day).  I found this pricing a bit of a gouge.

Also, while I really liked the renovated bathroom I was curious why they didn't install ventillation to remove the steam from the shower...  It really seemed to fill the room, and take a while to dissapate.  Shower temp/pressure was excellent!

Overall, a great stay at this hotel.  Staff was very friendly as well.",4,2007,09,25
150,Nice hotel in a convenient London location,"Stayed at the Churchill property with my mother on our visit to London.  The check-in process was a bit non-standard.  Normally, Regency Club and suite check-ins are done on a private floor in a quiet and more exclusive atmosphere, but the 8th floor was under renovation and it was not available for our visit.  They walked us from the main desk to another desk and then another girl walked us back to the original desk and did our check-in.  (very strange)  The suite we booked was not the one we were placed in and I brought it up to the staff.  After a few exchanges of pleasantries, we were moved to the correct suite.

The services were all excellent at the hotel.  The theatre desk was efficient and helpful, as was the concierge--especially Chris!  He went far beyond the normal amount of time a concierge would offer to a guest to ensure everything was just right (even gave us umbrellas for the day, as rain was expected.)

The Regency Club was very good.  They do a much more formal breakfast than most RC's.  

The hotel is about 3-5 minutes from the nearest tube station, depending upon your walking speed.  

Overall, a great London hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

150,hurry redo or shut it down,"disappointing re-do since it used to be inter-conti.

great hall porters

fair and uninspiring club quaters

no gym facilities in make-over, using a single room w/ equipment

no close to hyatt standards - shutter it until ready
",2,2007,07,15
150,Very Nice Hotel,"We came on a first visit to London as tourists.  Hotel is in a convenient location, great service,  rooms were modern with those great hyatt beds, very nice bar downstairs. Only complaint would be the price but everything in London is pricey.

150,GREAT HOTEL,"Another gret stay at the churchill! we spen t a week here in june and had a terrific stay. We had a newly refurbished king room on the 7th floor. Great fairly spacious room with all the amenities you need. breakfast in the montague restaurant is always of high standard and we made sure we ate up big for our long days exploring the town. Great professional staff from checkin to restaurant and doormen. we would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone visting london, Great Marble arch/ oxford street location. very convenient to shopping. Dont forget afternoon tea in the montague.
",5,2007,06,26
150,Brilliant hotel - especially if you like shopping!,"We stayed on the 8th floor in one of the executive club rooms, overlooking Portland Square.

The room itself was perhaps a little smaller than you might expect but was perfectly decent with a huge comfy double bed, flat screen tv and a desk area. It did however have an adjoining door with the next door room and on occasion we could hear voices from our neighbours. Not sure how annoying this would be if you had noisy people staying next to you.

The hotel was pretty quiet for being less than five minutes away from the end of Oxford street and there also wasn't the usual corridor noise that you often get in hotels with doors banging all night long.

The club lounge provided a lovely continental breakfast. Free soft drinks and beer were on offer all day with a buffet and further drinks available between 6-8. Take advantage of this and stock up for the rest of the evening!

Service in the hotel was excellent and there was a dedicated reception and concierge desk for the club rooms. The staff were more than eager to please.

The downside was that , due to refurbishment, the gym and sauna was out of action, or rather had been replaced by a couple of treadmills in a bedroom.

This hotel is so close to Oxford Street that if you love shopping, you'd be silly not to stay here. It's also only 5 minutes away from Marble Arch tube station so is the perfect base in the centre of the city.

Tip: remember to take your Privacy sign off your door if you go out for the day. The staff really do respect your privacy and you won't get your room serviced until it's time for evening 'turn down'.
",4,2007,06,11
150,Perfect wedding venue,"We had our wedding reception in the Churchill in April this year - we could not have asked for a more perfect, or well organised day.  The service was commented on several times by our guests as being more than first class, and the food, was the best (I am not being biased) I have ever had at a wedding - we have set a benchmark now for all our friends which may be hard to surpass.

We stayed in a suite which was superb, very spacious, a bed I could have stayed in forever and great amenities - only one blip was the view of scaffolding from our window, but we did not really worry!

we will go back for our wedding anniversary every year!

I think for anyone wanting to stay in central london, this is a perfect location, so close to Ox st but you woudl not know, as it is a very well off neighbourhood.  The in hotel restaurant does great English food, and the breakfast is brilliant.
",5,2007,06,02
150,World Class Hotel,"Exceptional hotel. Spaceous rooms, incredible service, delicious food. 

This property sports the best Regency Club that I have ever visited. 

The Churchill cigar bar was a fine addition to the property and the server was very helpful. 

50% of the hotel was undergoing a complete renovation, but they have done a perfect job hiding that fact. I didn't realize it until I was told.

Excellent location.",5,2007,05,22
150,A home away from Home!,"I had the opportunity of staying in The Churchill twice in the last two months (a Birthday weekend London escape for my wife and me in February (first week of February) and a short Easter vacation with the kids (a boy and a girl of 12 and 9 years) (the second week of April). The overall impression was simply excellent. As one would expect from a five star hotel.

I had stayed in the Churchill a couple of times in the past during its Intercontinental days. I can say that the only difference that I have noticed, is in the general atmosphere of the hotel which has changed from strict formal and businessman style to a more casual, family and vacationer friendly .

Otherwise, all the ingredients that make a nice hotel were there. The breakfast was superb in terms of quality (really excellent) and variety of food. The staff was kind and friendly and they even arranged a small surprise for my wife's birthday with champagne and chocolates awaiting us in our room when we returned back from our wanderings in London in the evening.

The cleaness of the hotel spaces (rooms, bathrooms, public) and the comfort of bedding, towels, bathrobes are of five star standards.

I look forward to staying in this hotel soon.",5,2007,04,18
150,You'd think they'd get the most basic thing right . . . but not.,"My wife and I wanted to spend a couple of nights in London, so we booked a two night stay at The Hyatt Regency - The Churchill at Portman Square.  The hotel seemed full (much of it, I believe, is under renovation) so they wanted 28,000 points per night for our stay.  This is twice the normal rate.

When we were shown to the Regency Club room, it was freshly decorated and quite attractive --- but not much bigger than a shoe box.  The Regency Club concierge, who showed us to the room, asked enthusiastically, ""What do you think of it?""  I replied that I thought it was very small.  She shrugged her shoulders.  ""All London hotel rooms are like this.""  (Guess she's never stayed in the Savoy, or Claridge's, or the Connaught, or many others . . . )

The biggest problem was the light switches.  Okay, I know that sounds silly and trivial --- but please follow this for a moment.

There was one of those master power switches at the front door to the tiny room.  When you switched it, on departure, you turned off all of the room lights.  Conversely when you returned you turned all of the lights back on.

There was another one of these master power switches by one side of the bed (mine), but not the other.  Each side of the bed had a bedside lamp, and each bedside lamp had its own individual control.

The master switch controlled the ceiling lights in the room:  powerful, bright halogen lights in the entryway.  But this room was so small that the entryway virtually scraped the other side of the room.  There was no individual control for the ceiling lights.

When Marjorie wanted to go to sleep, she could shut off her bedside lamp --- but could not shut off the ceiling lights.  They shone right into her eyes.  I could shut off the ceiling lights, but if I did so, I also turned off the two bedside lamps --- so I couldn't read in bed.

I just couldn't sleep, and I grew increasingly more irritated and annoyed.  Frankly, I felt trapped by the fact that I was in the dark, but could not do something as basic as turn on the bedside lamp without also turning on all of the ceiling lamps.

You'd think an organisation the size of the Hyatt would get this simple bit of wiring right.  Hey, guys, I'm not a beta tester.  You wanted 28,000 points per night for this room --- can I at least have a bedside lamp that's independent of the ceiling lights?

I finally got dressed, quietly, and went down into the lobby and spoke with the Assistant Manager.  Her reply?  ""Nobody has had this problem before.""  She showed me another room, and the wiring was identical.

I sat in the lobby for about 90 minutes --- on a couch, with a blanket and a pitcher of water.  A maintenance man finally came with another bedside lamp and a thick extension cord:  you could  power a small city with the cord.  He had a role of duct tape.  His plan was to tip-toe into the tiny room, with my wife asleep, and wire the bedside lamp to the plug socket on the other side of the room --- a plug socket not linked to the master switch.  And then duct tape the entire contraption to the carpet.

I borrowed his small flashlight (torch) instead.

When I saw a Rooms Manager in the morning, his attitude wasn't apologetic.  It was all, he explained, ""a matter of cost.""

This wouldn't be a problem if you were by yourself in the room, but if there are two of you, find another hotel in London.",1,2006,12,07
150,No complaints. As promised.,"Went for a weekend trip to London. The hotel is in a great location for Selfridges and other Oxford Street stores and a short walk to Hyde Park. The quality of the hotel was well up to standard and I can't fault it in anyway. The reception staff were particularly courteous and got the stay off to a good start.
",4,2006,11,15
150,Terrific!,"We had a marvellous stay at this hotel - from the moment we arrived, we felt relaxed and comfortable. Our room was in the Regency Club, which meant that check-in was on a dedicated floor and handled swiftly and easily. By the time we had enjoyed a complimentary drink in the Regency Club Lounge, our luggage had been delivered to the room which was ready and waiting for us despite the fact that we had arrived early. Service throughout our stay was impeccable and we had a very good dinner in the Montagu restaurant. We had requested a late check-out which meant we could relax the following day and after a long walk in the unseasonably warm weather, we rounded off the weekend with a champagne cream tea. The hotel is within an easy walk of Oxford Street and Hyde Park. The staff are to be commended for their efficiency and courtesy.
",5,2006,10,31
150,Very pleased!,"Having read the so-so reviews posted here, I thought that my stay at this hotel would be lackluster. But I have loads of Hyatt points and was ending a vacation in Italy with two nights in London, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity for a free stay. I knew the hotel is under renovation and expected the worst.

Upon check-in (where there is no sign of renovation in the very nice lobby), I asked if I could have a renovated room. The clerk told me that, while some rooms are finished, they didn't have all the kinks worked out. Fair enough, I thought. However, I was happily surprised to see that my non-renovated room was not only spacious (American-sized!), but also quite nice. If it wasn't renovated, I'm not sure what needed to be upgraded! The only sign of renovation I saw on my stay was an area ourside the elevator on my floor (5th floor), where there was a screen shielding some work being done.

The staff at this hotel were all above average, including a super helpful concierge. And, as others have noted, it's a great location.

I travel to London at least once a year, and I have to say I wouldn't hesitate to stay here even if I didn't have Hyatt dollars. Maybe I was just lucky!",4,2006,09,30
150,Disappointed,"This is definitely not a 5-star hotel as advertised.

I'm a Hyatt Diamond member and travels about 200 nights a year, including many in London.  This was my first stay here and I was thoroughly disappointed.

First of all the hotel is quite old, and undergoing a renovation.  I can see why the rooms need updating as age definitely showed.  My biggest complaint is that the walls are paper thin.  I could hear my neighbor's television program even with my TV turned on.

Check-in was quite disappointing as well.  Even after informing the hotel of my arrival time, they gave away the room that was previously assigned to me (as I could see when I signed my folio) and told me I had been given a ""quiet room"".  The quiet room turned out to be on the same floor as executive offices, function rooms, and directly across the gym.  When I entered and closed my door, I could hear the TV in the gym.  I could imagine how noisy it would be in the morning so I went downstairs to change my room.  There I was kep waiting for over 10 minutes.  And even being a Diamond member the duty or front-desk manager did not have the courtesy of coming out of the office to talk to me.  After a 10-minute wait the poor girl (nice but apparently quite new on the job) came out and gave me another room, overlooking the police station.

Location of the hotel is quite good for Oxford street shopping.  But the neighborhood is completly dead after 6pm.  Absolutely no light, shops, restaurants or anything.  The nearest place you can buy a bottle of water or some fruit is more than a 10-minute walk.

Even though it's a business hotel, I found the hotel lobby primarily full of large families with many young kids running.

Granted the rate is not that high for London.  I paid just under 200 pounds.  But I think you can find better hotels to stay at.
",2,2006,09,18
150,Ok but was disappointed with some things,"My wife and I stayed here recently on our honeymoon. We had pre-paid for a King Size bed and had informed them of a request for early check-in. We waited for 3 hours for our room, which was basically two twin beds stuck together in the middle of the room, with the pinned headboards showing that it is double. I complained and they changed the room for us that evening. It was a king size headboard, but yet again, a couple of double beds stuck together. The other problem was the air conditioning. Unfortunately we stayed in london on the hottest days of the year, and the room was no refuge from the heat. 

The staff on the other hand were very friendly and helpful and as an apology for the earlier room had sent a bottle of champagne, dessert and a fruit bowl. Nice touch, too bad about the rooms themselves.
",3,2006,09,05
150,Too Tropical for London,"OK, I'll be honest, like many other guests I stayed here as part of the Hyatt frequent guest program. We paid extra and had a regency club room on the 8th floor where the temperature seemed to be a constant 28 degrees (celsius) in a cold London Spring. Regency club privleges include breakfast and drinks/canapes from 18:00-20:00 in a private lounge. While there were many guests from normally warmer climes who seemed not too mind, two Aussies found it quite stifling. We dressed for a cold London and everytime we came to our room and the club lounge we felt like changing to beach clothes. The environment makes one thirsty and the free drinks at the lounge quenched our thirst. The canape selection was substantial enough that after a full day of sightseeing and a pub lunch it was a enough for dinner. Saving! Continental breakfast was more than satisfactory. 
Overall, the reception and door staff were wonderful and so friendly however the english was poor amongst the F&B staff. Having stayed in plenty of 5 star places worldwide the rooms at the Hyatt barely make the grade but on hearsay probably acceptable for London. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment so the regency rooms could do with this as I suspect they hadn't been updated by May 2006.  If I had to pay the 200 pound (approx) cost per room, i think there would be better. If the Hyatt Regency Churchill suits your purposes for a visit to London, it is more than acceptable.
",3,2006,07,21
150,A nice surprise,"After reading the reviews of the Churchill on trip advisor and seeing no reviews on the hotel in the various travel guides for London, we were a little apprehensive about our upcoming stay there. After spending a week and a half at the Churchill, we are happy to report that we loved it. We took our 13 year old daughter to England and stayed on the club level. The room was not significantly more in price and yet included breakfast in the private lounge every morning, snacks and drinks all day and appetizers and free drinks (including Champagne) every evening. More importantly, the staff could not have been more attentive to our needs. Our room was made up everyday as soon as we left and the beds and linens were very comfortable. 

The bathrooms were very nice, although a little small  with a lack of decent counter space and no cabinet space, but the room, a King bedded room with a rollaway bed for our daughter was spacious in European terms. 

As for location, we loved it. We were near a wonderful area full of great little restaurants which were easily walked to.  In addition, we were a quick walk to the Metro and for those times when we needed a taxi, there was always one out front.

All in all a great experience for the money...The staff made you feel like you were at the Ritz and the lobby and extra amenities didn't disappoint either...
",5,2006,07,04
150,Excellent!,"We stayed on the club floor, which offers two concierges, as well as a breakfast room that has complimentary water/sodas/snacks all day.  In London, this is a value not to be overlooked, particularly when the quality of the breakfast is considered.

The rooms were good sized, particularly for London, and very clean.  Service was very courteous and helpful.  We found the hotel to be centrally located--a short walk to the tube, very close to Hyde Park, and in a generally interesting neighborhood.  A decent fitness facility.

All in all, a very pleasant experience.  Highly recommended.
",5,2006,07,03
150,Nice weekend,"The Churchill is ideally placed for the top of Oxford Street shopping, but a bit too much of a walk to Theatreland for convenience if that is what you are seeking (45 mins reasonable stroll, [40 mins brisk] or GBP10 in a taxi, traffic permitting [consider taking a cab at the far side of Portman square - it took us about ten minutes one day just to go from the hotel to the opposite corner].

The hotel is quite large, and the entrance is impressive. We stayed in King rooms and they were nice and spacious: our room had a nice view over Portman Square. This meant it was a bit noisier than we would have liked, but it was better than looking over rooftops. The staff were really pleasant, and apart from a rather grumpy doorman who insisted we move our car almost as soon as we arrived (we can understand the security aspects, but a nicer way of saying it would have made all the difference). The continental breakfast in the Club lounge was substantial, and the service staff there couldn't do enough to help. The beds were relaxing and it was relatively easy to nod off (not many hotels have that effect on me or my wife). The bathroom was a bit tatty, but we were told when we arrived that that was the day the hotel was beginning a major refurbishment, so when it is finished, if they can keep the service level we experienced, coupled with good surroundings, it will be absolutely excellent.

The hotel's underground car park is a couple of pounds dearer than an NCP carpark a couple of streets away, but not worth quibbling about. It would be nice {and may be available after the revamp} to have an internal access from the carpark to the hotel interior. 

A couple of small gripes: one was the quality of the towels we had on one day (these were more like tourist hotel swimming pool towels, thin and having seen better days): the other was the room's sash windows were poorly fitting, and we had to call maintenance to close them as they had jammed. Hopefully the refurbishment will address this.  

We went to shows each evening of our stay, so never ate a full meal in the hotel, but the restaurant looked clean, and the tables were nicely set. All in all a place I would return to for a shopping trip. Also it's very close to Hyde Park for a bit of fresh air and a (relative) bit of peace.",4,2006,04,06
150,Great stay,"I was a little hestitant to book the Hyatt because there weren't that many reviews here or elsewhere, but did because it was free with Hyatt points and, really, how can you go too wrong with a Hyatt? 
  I don't have a SINGLE complaint. It's definitely a business hotel, filled with (mostly) men in suits, but we weren't looking for a lobby filled with tour bus brochures anyway. 
  Very classy place. Nice room, though nothing big or super fancy. The most comfortable bed and pillows I've ever had in a hotel, and we've tried a lot of the heavenly beds et al. It was hard to get out of bed but we had to because it was a short trip (5 nights!).  
  I can't say enough good things about the staff. They were always so welcoming and helpful and NEVER expected tips. (so different than in the U.S.).
  The location was perfect: a very quick walk to the Marble Arch tube stop and Oxford Street. Super close to Baker Street and some good restaurants (Royal China Club). Perfectly situated for a run in Hyde Park/Kensington Park.
  We (my mom and I) had a Regency Club room and I can't say I would pay the extra (or use the extra points) next time but ONLY because we were gone most of the day and only came back to change for dinner or a show. The lounge was small but nice. Pretty formal. Light snacks and breakfast foods. We just used it a couple times. Very helpful, friendly staff up there, too.
  They just started (a few days after we left) a major renovation that will take out half the rooms at a time. Maybe they're having specials as a result. If so, I wouldn't hestitate to grab it. 
  The restaurants, like most everything in London, are pricey, but we enjoyed drinks and a great burger at the Churchill Bar and a fabulous meal at Locanda Locatelli.
",4,2006,03,27
150,Decent but noisy,"I stayed here for 3 nights and although the room itself was comfortable and the staff, courteous, I was very disappointed with the noise level. I got a room near the elevators, so there was constant chatter, etc. Plus, there are sofas by the elevators, so there were often groups of people who would congregate there and make quite a bit of noise. Plus, you could hear everything your neighbors said/did + whatever was going on in the halls. Otherwise, the room was quite clean and the beds were comfortable. And the location is great.

150,very good christmas in London at the Hyatt !,"we were in London for Christmas and we spent 3 nights in  the  hotel ""Hyatt Churchill"" at the regency club . the hotel is beautiful inside ,the hall, the bars, the restaurants ( two) and our bedroom was big and very confortable! the staff looks kind and polite.the regency room where we had our breakfast is very lovely  and with a lot of charm.... we 'll return with pleasure!
",5,2006,01,05
150,loved the Hyatt Churchill,"We weren't expecting much after reading the reviews on this site - but I guess even Trip Advisor members aren't always right (I've just always relied on the advice I've received here - usuallly right on target) We loved the Churchill, from the minute we stepped out of the cab. The friendly welcome from the staff was exceptional. The hotel is lovely, our room was lovely, everything looked very clean and in great shape - nothing looked ""worn"". The restaurants looked great, although our short stay didn't permit us to try them. We stayed on the club level, free with Hyatt points, and were treated like royalty. The delicious snacks and drinks in the lounge, and the continental breakfast, were great.  It was so nice to be able to grab a bottle of water or Diet Coke whenever we wanted! The hotel arranged a minicab for me for airport transport since I couldn't manage the Gatwick express myself with all my luggage. The only drawback was that we thought we'd be closer to our daughter's flat than we actually were, but we were able to get around quite easily. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2005,12,09
150,average,"Stayed here twice in the past two years.

We asked for nonsmoking rooms, but the rooms smelled strongly of smoke.. ashes and ciggies were found everywhere. Every room they showed us smelled of smoke. we finally worked something out with the manager, and they gave us the newest rooms they had.

Because the hotel is only a block away from the Arab part of London, there are a lot of Arab people at the hotel. I didn't mind, but many of them sat around in the lobby smoking nonstop. 

The rooms are very WORN and OLD. This was a huge disappointment considering it is a Hyatt.

After all my complaints, why did I stay twice? Simple we got the rooms for free through hyatt gold points
",2,2005,11,30
150,A decent enough choice if the price is right,"Stayed here just overnight on business October, 2005 and was happy enough.  The location is great for my favorite shopping (especially Marylebone High Street) and with decent enough access to the City and other points.  The building itself is nothing special, looks like a '50s concrete block, but the lobby is rather grand - very open and lots of marble, and a good restaurant just off to the left - casual but pricey and good food.

The rooms are nothing to write home about.  Comfortably furnished, and quite clean.  My standard king on the fourth floor was a reasonable size, and the bathroom was just fine.  The mattress could have been better - probably just about time to replace them.

Staff were pleasant and relatively efficient.  I had a decent if not great rate of 165 pounds for the night not including breakfast (there were cheaper, bkfst included rates available, but not when I booked last minute), and only the nasty UK taxes made it nearly 200 pounds.  While I wouldn't rush to stay here again, I wouldn't run screaming either, if it the offer was good.
",3,2005,11,30
150,Good but not quite Hyatt,"I stayed one night the week of 7 November.  Location is very convenient and pleasant, staff is very helpful and pleasant.  

I had a double non-smoking room on the 4th floor, OK but a little small for Hyatt and Hyatt prices.  Bed very comfortable, but would have expected ironing board and ice machine as others have noted.  Tub too short to stretch my legs and soak my aching feet (from all that walking).

Hotel exterior is like a bad post-war office building, except for the entry.  The website photo has tree leaves all around the edges for a good reason.  The beautiful park in Portman Square is lovely to look at but impossible to use since it is private, the web site doesn't tell you that, either.

Considering how expensive hotels are in London, this was an average value (about $300).
",3,2005,11,12
150,A little worn,"I stayed  at the Hyatt Churchill for 3 nights in early October.  The picture on the internet shows the exterior which was shot through the park.  That was the only nice part of the exterior. The Lobby was beautiful, spacious and gleaming.The front desk staff was very accommodating.I was able to check right in when I landed and the process was easy.
Room was a big disappointment. While it was a good size,it was quite worn. Closet was very small and I could not hang many clothes in thereas there was a shelf with a safe on it taking up most of the lower half of the closet.  Drawer space was at a minimum and there was no iron.The room was chilly and I never did figure out how to run the heat.There was a line of dirt around the whole room as if when they shampooed rugs their machine could not get the 3 inches around the perimeter.The fixtures didn't seem to fit the bathroom as though when they bought a new toilet and installed plumbing they didn't redo the whole bathroom;ie;  Lid did not fit on toilet because of back not going all the way back and a hole in the shower unit because new one was a different size.Also, toilet did not flush properly..There was no ice machine, you would have to call room service if you wanted ice and then they only brought a small amount. There was an adjoining room to ours and it only had one locked door in between with space under the door so there didn't seem to be any privacy.We knew when their lights were on, could hear them in the bathroom, could hear their television,and also their voices.  There also is no gift shop and no pool in this hotel.  There was however lots of good pressure and hot water.  The room was also very clean.Considering it was 185pounds on 2 days and 200pounds on the third  I would not stay there again.",3,2005,10,27
150,Very Nice Stay,"Comfortable, with great service. Got a deal that included breakfast (saved a ton of money). A little off the beaten tourist path but very convenient to oxford street.  I'd stay there again tomorrow!
",4,2005,08,12
150,Nice stay,"Is only a short taxi ride from Paddington Train Station. Lobby is spacious and very eye appealing. Front desk staff very friendly and efficient for check in and out. Lobby furniture appeared comfortable. Cigar bar off lobby is very pricey (as almost everything else in London), but very nice atmosphere for relaxing and having a pint before retiring. I stayed the week in between bombings and as others have said taxis seemed to always be available at the door. You can walk to the designer district and there are very good restaurants nearby as well. Marble Arch train station is close by. Room on the 6th floor was nice, but was expecting a bit more luxury for the Hyatt name. TV was smaller than expected. Bathroom was very stylish with marble. Expected an ironing board and iron in the room, but had to request one from room service. Mini-bar was fully stocked, but as one would expect, was ridiculously high priced...some may say, ""I'd rather starve."" Expected complimentary coffee/tea, but none offered. Air conditioning kept room very comfortable. Had a king bed and it was very comfortable--slept well. TV has computerized wake-up call setting that gets you up with music, increasing volume gradually after turn on--better than the ringing phone, in my opinion. Housekeeping seemed to clean/tidy up the room several times during the day. Overall, a very good stay.",4,2005,08,05
150,nice hotel,"This hotel is well located in the Marble Arch area of London. I booked this hotel directed through Hyatt. I  must recommend that if you stay at this hotel, stay on a club floor. That is what we did.
As an American, London can be quite pricey. Being on the club floor we received a vey nice buffet breakfast(all cold items) plus tea, coffee, etc. There were cookies and beverages available all day long so if you needed a quick pick-me-up during the day, this was available. In the early evening there were light appetizers and drinks available. 
The rooms were o.k. as they were a little worn, but very clean. The service on the club floor was very good. There was always a concierge on this floor(easy check in and out.)
The lobby was very nice as was the restaurant(we had high tea there.)
The location of the hotel was central. We were in London during the 2nd wave of terror so we were forced to either walk or take a taxi(taxis were almost always at our hotel.)
If you do not mind walking then you can get to most places by either foot or taxi.",2,2005,07,28
150,A very above average Hyatt,"With respect to some of the other reviews, I too wouldn't classify this as a 5-star hotel, but it doesn't miss by much. One of the first things I notice in a hotel is the condition of the room and furnishings, and everything in the Hyatt Churchill was first-rate. The standard rooms and bathrooms are large, by London standards, the public areas are clean and tasteful, and the location is very convenient for seeing the city. The prices for both the room and hotel restaurants are exorbitant, but again, not unreasonable by London standards. All in all, a highly recommended hotel.
    ",4,2005,02,11
150,Needs refurbishment,"I am a Hyatt Diamond member, and stay regularly here. Service in Regency Club is good, with staff remembering your name from one visit to the next. Rooms are overdue for renovation, however, and do not live up to the sleek contemporary design that is typically Hyatt.

Location is excellent for access to West End and City. Gym is cramped and unimpressive.
",2,2004,11,25
150,"Great location, great service.","I stayed at The Churchill from Oct. 6 through Oct. 9, 2004. I have traveled extensively in the states and the Caribbean, but this was my first trip to Europe.

The hotel is in a good location — two blocks from Oxford Street and three blocks from the Marble Arch underground. Cabs queue on the street next to the hotel, so there was never more than a two minute wait for a taxi.

The lobby is large but unimpressive. My room, on the fifth floor, was adequate size, very clean, with fully stocked minibar. The bed was a little soft for my taste. All appliances worked. The rooms have high-speed Internet access for a fee.

The restaurant has a limited menu and mediocre meals. The breakfast buffet was dreadful. Afternoon tea, however, was delightful, with wonderful scones. The hotel bar was lovely, with a piano player/singer performing.

The hotel has a fitness room with treadmills, stationary bikes and stairstepper.

The staff was very attentive and courteous. I had trouble around midnight getting the Internet access to work, and the hotel manager came to my room less than five minutes after I called.  I was greeted by name every day by the doormen.

I recommend The Churchill and I plan to stay there on my next visit to London. Just don't take your meals there.",4,2004,10,25
150,Perfect Hotel!  (super nice),"Just stayed at the Churchhill with my fiance in late September and it was simply amazing! Now to be honest I have no idea what we paid for our room since it was a gift, but I can tell you right now that it is a legit 4-5 star hotel. Great location in a very clean and high end area. Short walk to Marble Arch subway station (super easy to use!). As soon as you walk in the lobby, you'll know that your in good hands. Our room was on the 6th floor and was huge with a great view and even greater bathroom. Very comparable to a high end hotel in America, not ""european"" in terms of size and ammenities at all. Very nice and helpfull staff. Short walk to British museum. I can tell you that when I went to visit my mother's hotel, which was located right in the heart of downtown London, that not only was the Churchhill's area 10X cleaner, but it made her hotel look like a complete dump....and she spent $150 a night. There is also tons of trendy shopping and good restaurants right next to the Churchill. Bottom line....you will not be dissapointed, trust me!
",5,2004,10,18
150,Not what it should be,"Just returned from London and our stay at the Churchill. My wife our two kids and myself. We occupied 2 adjoining smallish rooms that were in most definite need of repair (peeled paint, worn carpets, bathroom plumbing problems). None of these issues would phase me in a hotel that was charging 2/3rd’s the price. However, with the prices charged here, you should expect a 5 star hotel and not a 3 star hotel, as the Churchill has become. The service provided by the staff is also showing a definite trend towards mediocrity. We travel quite a bit, and we are well aware of what one can expect in the various cities of Europe. In London you can do much better than the Churchill.

150,DELIGHTFUL HOLIDAY AT THE CHURCHILL,"My husband and I stayed at the  Churchill, then Intercontinental, over the Christmas Holidays through New Year's Day, 2003-2004. The hotel is located two blocks from Oxford Street in a quiet neighborhood; the nearest underground station, Marble Arch, is 4 blocks away. We stayed on the club level and found the staff warm and attentive. The room was large and clean with all of the amenities one would expect in a fine hotel. Our window overlooked Portman Square.  Food and drinks were served throughout the day in the club dining room.  Full breakfast, fresh rocket salad at lunch, cucumber sandwiches and pastries at teatime are examples of the fare. The tables were set with linens and the staff would refill your coffee or tea if you asked.  We dined at the hotel restaurant both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with friends who came in from Holland. The menu was festive with food beautifully prepared and extremely fresh.  My only complaint would be that our room had a bit of worn wallpaper in the bathroom.  That is the only negative, and hardly detracted from the wonderful holiday we experienced at this very special hotel.
",5,2004,07,14
150,No! Not what it says it is!,"The Hotel Has Mediocre Service.  It Recently Changed From The InterContinental To The Hyatt Churchill.  It Isn't Up To Par Yet.  I'd Suggest....STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE FOR A WHILE!  The Bed Was Hard, And Lumpy In The Middle....The Food Was So So.....The Room Service, Housekeeping, Laundry WAS TERRIBLE!!!

The Concierge And Doorman Were Quite Helpful Though.  So...I'd Only Recommend If You Had NO OTHER PLACE To Stay.  Spend You Hard Earned Dollars In A Hotel That Really Aims To Please And WANTS Your Business!

150,"Good, but not as good as it thinks it is","Grand, impressive lobby; nice area with sofas for coffees and chats. Grand, unimpressive queues for breakfast.Truly excellent, Michelin-starred Italian restaurant attached, although this is run independently of the hotel. Large-ish, comfortable rooms without being particularly impressive. Smart, uniformed staff on duty in the lobby (to impress the tourists, of which there seem to be many?). Good location near Oxford Street. Sharp discounts by bidding available on the web.But I'd expect five-star hotels to have features such as a pool, trouser press etc. ? to me, this feels more like a very grand four-star. And the hotel bar charged five pounds for a pint of Guinness, and left the bill blank so one could tip them; how's that for exploiting your guests?",4,2004,03,31
150,Lovelly,"we stayed in this hotel in December, it is a lovely hotel. The location is perfect, just a few steps from Oxford street, close to regent street. The rooms are small (very ussual in London) with lot of special touches like a rope & slippers. We had a room with the worst view effer, actually no few at all. Out of our window you could only see grey brick walls. I liked the service and the hotels deco, very chique.",4,2004,01,15
150,Great For a Family,"This is the second time I stayed at the Churchill, but the first on the Club Level. It was great. The room is larger than others, there is great food throughout the day, all the drinks you want including alcoholic beverages. Concierge and the staff at the Club level were great. Tremendous location and great value.",5,2004,01,08
150,Great hotel!,"We stayed at the Churchill for the week between Christmas and New Year's 2004. The going rate was $370/night but we got a room on priceline for $122/night! And it was great! The location was close to the tube stop and a ton of shopping. We recommend St. Christopher's Street which is about 3 blocks from the hotel for great places to eat. 
The service at the hotel was tremendous! The room service was expensive, but once we saw how expensive a meal at a restaurant was room service wasn't much more! The food was great! Though I thought the $40 breakfast was way too much! Our room was small but the room had EVERY amenity! The bathrooms were a decent size and 5 star! For the 2 star price we loved this hotel!!!!!",5,2004,01,06
150,OK But . . .,"Stayed here many times on business. Pricy. Good location just North of Oxford street and around the corner from Speaker's Corner. Loved the lobby and public rooms (bar, restaurant etc.). Concierge and Doormen were excellent, and helpful.

Rooms are nicely sized compared to tiny rooms usual to London Hotels, and had 110V electrical outlets (great advantage to us US travellers).

Downside: I've never had a good room here. The first time it was incredibly stuffy with a window that didn't open (located at roof level over the restaurant). Next time (winter) it was positively freezing, and they had to give me an electric space heater (this was a concierge floor room to boot). For some reason, on every trip I got a bad room. 
It may be due to fundamentally bad/old/outdated building systems.",2,2003,07,15
150,"Great Service, Can't go wrong with them...","We stayed at the Churchill Intercontinental and it exceeded our expectations! European hotels are notorious for having smaller beds and rooms - but not here, we were so comfortable we hated to sightsee some days. And the service, superb. Everyone at the front desk was helpful and offered up various local options for dinner, afternoon/high tea, shopping for souvenirs, etc. The only drawback initially was that you are not in the midst of the major sights - however, it was great for us because we chose to be in a quieter area that allowed for some downtime from the hustle and bustle of London. One key tip we received from a cabbie is to take a double decker tour bus and ended up that the bus had stop that dropped us off a 1/2 block from the hotel which made it convenient to see all the well known spots in London! Great little place on Marleybone High Street to catch breakfast or lunch - Patisserie Valerie. We heard about it thru this website and it was one of our biggest treats!",5,2003,07,11
150,Good for business great for families,"My 13 year old son and I stayed at the Churchill on for 11 days over the holidays. The staff are wonderful, the rooms are nice and well appointed, the service is great and the food is fabulous. We could not have been happier.

Excelente estética combinación de clasisismo británico con modernidad,se respira el homenaje a Churchill todo el tiempo. El hotel tiene dos restaurantes impactantes uno británico y otro italiano. Y un salón de tragos con terraza espectaculares, ambos inspirados en Churchill. La ubicación es óptima, cercano a todos los lugares de interés comercial o histórico con acceso al transporte inmediato. El barrio Marylebone es un remanso en la urbe, parece un pueblo encantador habitado por británicos puesto en el medio de la ciudad. Recomiendo la opción del Regency Club, está todo el día abierto y sirve un desalluno y merienda superabundantes. Espero que su estadía sea tan satisfactoria como lo fue la mía.

E non solo nei confronti degli italiani....li ho visti conversare con adeguatezza con ospiti europei e non. Bravi Pietro, Lorenzo e giovani signorine alla reception!!

150,Ottimo,"Ottimo hotel, ottima zona, ottimo servizio, ottimo personale, ottimo ambiente, ottimo tutto.

150,Bello!,"Diciamo che siamo partiti un po lentamente con il servizio dato la coda al checkin. La nostra prenotazione era per 2 camere comunicanti in quanto viaggiavamo con  2 bambine, alle 14:30 una delle camere non era pronta, poi ci dicono di si, andiamo in camera e dopo 15 minuto ci spostano perchè ci hanno dato la camera sbagliata. Direi che molto carinamente si sono ripresi portandoci una bottiglia di vino e dei dolci. le camere erano abbastanza spaziose. Letti molto belli e comodi. il bagno fortissimo con il water giapponese elettronico. Ottima colazione, buon buffet. servizio al ristorante però un po lento eppure erano in tanti in sala. Ottimo bar. direi che lo consiglio.",4,2016,11,08

la cosa piu' strana è stata la mia esperienza piuttosto strana: l'ultima sera, mentre dormivo, mi hanno portato un vassoio in camera con un piatto di hamburger,patatine fritte e coca cola, io ho sentito un'odore di fritto e mi sono svegliata.
quando l'ho fatto presente alla reception:qualcuno era entrato furtivamente in camera mia per portarmi un pasto che non avevo ordinato...l'unico risposta loro è stato un gelido sorry....ma la sicurezza e la privacy non esiste in questo albergo?? Vergogna",1,2016,10,17

150,Tutto Perfetto,"Ho soggiornato 3 notti all'Hyatt Regency The Churchill nel luglio 2014. Ho fatto il miglior soggiorno della mia vita (finora) in un hotel, e l'ho pagato fior di quattrini. Una mini suite (nono piano, circa 55 metri quadri) costa 1000 euro a notte, colazione inclusa. Ma ragazzi, ne vale la pena...! A quei livelli la colazione (posate d'argento) è servita in una Lounge separata dal resto dell'albergo (mai incontrati i clienti delle stanze ""normali"") e la lounge è aperta tutto il giorno per bibite ecc. Uno stuolo di camerieri per servirti, la pulizia della suite può essere effettuata a qualunque ora tu la chiedi, terrazza privata (ultimo piano) e privacy garantita...insomma c'è tutto. La cena in camera è ottima, anche la cucina italiana, e il prezzo accettabile  Consigliatissima.",5,2016,07,15

Es war absolut ruhig, keine Trittgeräusche wie in vielen Hotel sonst üblich. Wir hatten ein Zimmer zum Portman Square. Durch die Doppelverglasung nichts zu hören. Für uns war das Hyatt jeden teuren Penny somit wert. Auch das Frühstück war lecker. Die Renovierung des Hotels ist ganz aktuell und somit auch ein absolutes Plus. Sehr guter Standard. Ein Minus vielleicht: WLAN auf dem Zimmer war langsam und brach immer wieder ab. In der Lobby gut. Das sollte eigentlich nicht sein.",5,2016,06,28

150,"Alles auf hohem Nivea, auch die Preise","Das Hotel liegt wenige Gehminuten von der U-Bahnsation Marble Arch entfernt. Eingangshalle und Restaurant repräsentieren sofort den angestrebten Standard.

Das Zimmer war sehr sauber, auch wenn in der Nacht ein deutlich wahrnehmbares Pfeifen die Nachtruhe etwas gestört hat. Unpraktisch der viel zu gross geratene Schrank mit Mini-Bar und Kaffee / Tee-Utensilien direkt an einer der Bett-Kanten - wenig durchdacht.

Ungewohnt auch das Chaos der Fernsehkanäle. Ein System liess sich nicht erkennen, deutsche Sender verstreut über die Kanalliste.

Die Preise an der Bar schon irgendwas in Richtung ""frech"". Aber man muss ja da nichts trinken. Auch der Aufpreis für das Frühstück mit 36 Pfund pro Person eher in der oberen Region.

Das Personal aber durchwegs freundlich und zuvorkommend. ",4,2016,06,10

150,Excellentes Businesshotel in zentraler Lage,"Das Hyatt ist sehr zentral im Stadtteil Marylebone gelegen (fußläufig zur Oxford Street und zu Marble Arch). Mein Stockwerk (3. OG) war frisch renoviert und bot ein sehr geräumiges, schönes und ruhiges Zimmer. Das mit der Größe muss man betonen, da in London selbst Hotelzimmer, die mehrere hundert Pfund die Nacht kosten, oft winzig klein sind. Der Empfang war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Lediglich das Frühstück war arg kostspielig, aber das kann man ja auch auslassen.

150,Comodo ed elegante,"La prima cosa che si nota arrivando al Churchill è la sua posizione strategica, affacciato su una bella piazza con giardino, a due minuti a piedi da Oxford Street e dai grandi magazzini più alla moda. L'accoglienza é stata calorosa, il personale tutto molto gentile e professionale. Le zone comuni molto raffinate, eleganti senza essere pompose. Il bar è  vivace e accogliente con il caminetto acceso e il pianista che suona la sera( non so accada soltanto nei fine settimana e feste di Natale ...) . Ci hanno dato una camera appena rinnovata, con affaccio sul parco. Tutto molto nuovo e curato, il bagno un po' piccolo, ma funzionale ed elegante. Abbondanza di grucce negli armadi, asciugamani e lenzuola di alta qualità. La colazione in camera molto curata, buona abbondante  e puntuale .

150,Derckige Zimmer und schlechter Service aber 5 Sterne?,"Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr angenehm, in einer Nebenstraße der Oxford Street. Auch der Hyde Park befindet sich in der nähe, mit wenigen Minuten zu Fuß erreicht man die nächste U-Bahn Station. Ob es ein Geschäftlicher oder Privater Aufenthalt ist, könnte man diese Hotel eigentlich empfehlen.
Leider musste ich aus beruflichen Gründen meinen Geburtstag in diesem Haus verbringen.
Der Check-in war kühl und unpersönlöich, das Zimmer nicht sauber. Auf der Fernsteuerung des TV´s war ein gemisch aus Staub und Essensresten, im Badezimmer sowie im Bett befanden sich noch diverse Haare. Im Gang vor meiner Suite stand dreckiges Geschirr bis zum nächsten Tag.
Auf Grund meines Geburtstages wollte ich diesen Tag zu einem Erlebnis machen, und hatte bereits bei der Buchung angferagt ob ein Upgrade wie es einen Diamond Member zusteht garantiert wird, dies wurde abgelhent, somit musste ich ein Suite Upgrade einlösen, und erhielt dafür ein dreckiges Zimmer mit mangelhaften Service als Geburtstagsgeschenk.
Teile des Hotels waren Aufgrund eines Unfalls im Vorjahr immer noch gesperrt ( z.B.: Fitness / Sauna). Die gesperrten Bereiche wurde nirgends während der Buchung erwähnt, eine Alternative für die gesperrten Bereiche bot man in einem nahegelegen ""Private Club"" , leider war auch dort die Sauna außer Betrieb. Eine entschädigung für diesen Mangel gab es auch auf Nachfrage nicht.
Aufgrund der Sperrung einiger Etagen / Bereiche war ich wohl einer der einzigen der zutritt zur Lounge in diesem Hotel hatte. Ein Frühstück im Restaurant wurde mir verweigert, nur das Frühstück in der Lounge wäre möglich ( Normales Frühstück wäre mit Aufpreis möglich gewesen, ich frage mich was ist hier sinnvoller, einer evtl. mehreren Personen das normale Frühstück zu ermöglichen oder 3 Mitarbeiter, welche nicht ausgelastet sind, dort abzustellen). Dort saß ich als einziger Gast ca. 1,5 Std., es waren 3 Mitarbeiter anwesend, man hat es kein einziges mal geschaft mich anzusprechen oder mir Kaffee nachzuschenken. Wer sich mal richtig verloren vorkommen will der ist hier richtig. Das ist Service für Exklusive / Diamond Kunden!!

Wie bereits am anfang erwähnt. verbrachte ich meinen Geburtstag in diesem Hotel, leider hat diese Hotel dass wohl nicht wahrgenommen oder es nicht für nötig gehalten dies zu würdigen. Keine Grußkarte, kein Benefit, kein Voucher, wie in anderen Hotels üblich, besonder bei Status Gästen. Selbst mancher Gasthof würdigt Gäste die ihren Geburtstags dort verbringen.
Allgemein hält diese Hoitel wohl sehr wenig von Status Gästen, bereits seit April sind kaum Zimmer Buchbar. Auch die übliche Garantierte verfügbarkeiht für Diamond Member ist nicht gegeben ( auch nicht über ein Monat im voraus). Auf nachfrage bei Hyatt hat das Hotel die garantierte Verfügbarkeit angeblich für das restliche Jahr 2015 gesperrt. Allein im September 2015 ist diese Hotel bereits an über 30 % des Monats, auch für Diamond Member mit Garantierter Verfügbarkeit nicht mehr Buchbar!!!
Ich hätte diese Jahr bereits mehr als 20 Nächte in diesem Hotel verbracht, wenn dies möglich gewesen wäre.
Dies passt ins allgemeine Bild zu diesem Haus, Hauptsache mann kann 100 % belegung generieren und dem Gast nur das nötigste bieten, egal welche Gäste man damit verscheucht. Bei mir ist dies vollkommen gelungen, ich werde dieses Hotel nicht mehr Buchen, auch meine Diamond Mitgliedschaft bei Hyatt wird aufgrund diese Aufenthalts 2016 wohl nicht mehr fortgeführt. Hyatt hat mich hier auf ganzer Linie entäuscht, hier wurde bei weitem nicht das geboten was Hyatt verspricht bzw. was man von Hyatt erwartet.",1,2015,09,04
150,Perfecto,"Perfecta ubicación en pleno corazón londinense, cerca de Hyde Park. Un hotel excelente con un trato magnifico de personal. Habitaciones muy amplias, espaciosas y con todo tipo de detalle. Sin duda, recomendable. Un buen hotel 5*. En definitiva, para repetir. ",4,2015,07,28
150,Excelente atención. ,Perfecta ubicación y excelente atención. Valoro mucho la buena predisposición del personal. Entre ellos destaco a Aurelia de recepción. Definitivamente recomendable.

Para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas y que nos vendieron como excelente, nos decepcionamos un poco al llegar ya que por el precio que pagamos habia mejores hoteles tambien muy bien ubicados. Nos hospedamos en la Regency Suite, lo cual recomiendo si vais a este hotel. Esta en la mejor zona de Londres, eso si. Es un hotel de 5 estrellas basico en comparacion con otros que hemos estado, y el servicio, aunque si que estuvimos bien atendidos, no era para tirar cohetes. 
Los desayunos de Room Service si que eran muy completos y estaban bien de precio para ser Londres.
Las habitaciones las mantienen en buen estado y limpias aunque no son muy grandes.",3,2014,11,16

Nello splendore degli addobbi natalizi, abbiamo goduto di un ambiente raffinato, elegante e di un servizio impeccabile. La nostra camera era ampia e curata. La ristorazione eccezionale, cosí come la colazione e il room service. Ottima la posizione a pochi passi dalla fermata Marble Arch, ció nonostante la posizione defilata ne garantisce la tranquillità. Tutto splendido davvero.",5,2014,09,27

Inoltre il ristorante all'interno è famosissimo a Londra.",5,2014,08,08
150,Hotel der Superlative sieht anders aus,"Das Hyatt Regency in London ist gutes Hotel, aber leider kein Spitzenhotel – jedenfalls nicht im Verhältnis zu den Zimmerpreisen. 

Zimmer innerhalb der gleichen Kategorie haben leider alle eine sehr unterschiedlichen Standard. Und so gab es bereits bei der Zuteilung des Zimmers Probleme: Das erste Zimmer, das man mir geben wollte, befand sich im zweiten Stock mit Blick zum Innenhof: hieß es war sehr dunkel und man hatte vor dem Zimmerfenster direkt auf Augenhöhe die Klimaanlage (so ziemlich das schlechteste Standard-Zimmer was man in diesem Haus kriegen kann). Also bat ich um ein anderes Zimmer: das nächste Zimmer war freundlicher und mit Blick zu Straße, jedoch leider mit Verbindungstür, was mich normalerweise nicht stören würde. Doch im Falle dieses Hotels hört man durch diese Verbindungstür alles, aber auch alles vom Nebenzimmer. Also war das auch keine Option. 
Das dritte Zimmer war endlich akzeptabel, wenngleich die Sauberkeit etwas zu wünschen übrig ließ (schwarze Haare in der Dusche und braune Flecken auf der Bettdecke sind für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie nicht sehr angemessen). 

Die Zimmer sind relativ geräumig für Londoner Standard, aber die Badezimmer sind dafür umso kleiner. 

Der Room-Service ist zuvorkommend, schnell und freundlich. Das Restaurant ist wirklich sehr gut und die Lage des Hotels hervorragend. Ansonsten ist der Service eher unterkühlt und wenig entgegenkommend bei Fragen und Wünschen. Schade, hier könnte man wirklich mehr machen.

Alles in allem: Bei der Buchung oder beim Check-In darauf achten, dass ein Zimmer mit Blick zur Straße oder den Park genommen wird. Möglichst keine Zimmer mit Verbindungstüren. Der allgemeine Standard und Service ist in deutschen Hyatt-Hotels (Berlin oder Hamburg) deutlich besser. Aber in London hat man das wahrscheinlich nicht nötig. Die Standard-Raten von 300-400 Pfund pro Nacht ist dieses Hotel jedenfalls selbst für Londoner Verhältnisse leider nicht wert.",3,2014,07,21

Personale gentilissimo e disponibile e c'era anche quello che parlava italiano. La camera non troppo grande (ma a Londra è difficile trovarla tale) ma pulita con , letto comodo anche quello aggiunto. Posizione buonissima!!
Della colazione che dire: di tutto di più. Tutto buonissimo, abbondantissima e per ogni gusto. In più dalla cucina ogni desiderio veniva avverato.

Il personale è gentilissimo e se siete ospiti frequenti vi sentirete a casa per tutte le attenzioni che riceverete.
Manutenzione dell'hotel eccellente, stanze curate anche se piccoline, servizio generale ottimo.
Molto bella la lounge dell'albergo dove è possibile bere un drink o mangiare uno snack veloce, mentre uno dei ristoranti il Montagu con la sua cucina a vista è davvero da non perdere.

Der Blick auf den Park ist schön und die Lage selbst wirklich gut. Meine zweimalige Bitte, upgrade options zu prüfen, blieb leider unbearbeitet - sollte bei einem Hyatt Platin Kunden nicht passieren. Das Frühstück ist ordentlich, der Afternoon Tea toll. Die Churchill Bar hat eine etwas untergekühlte Atmosphäre - etwas zu hell für meinen Geschmack. Gut für einen drink aber lädt nicht zum längeren Verweilen ein. Die zweite Nacht war relativ unruhig - die Zimmer sind nicht sehr gut geräuschisoliert und man hört Fernseher und Türgeräusche der Nachbarzimmer. Das ist nicht 5 Sterne Niveau.",3,2014,01,02

L'atmosfera della hall è molto rilassante, in certi orari anche con musica dal vivo. Mi sono trovata benissimo, ma non voglio soffermarmi troppo sulle stanze o sugli interni, quanto più sulla cucina del ristorante: eccezionale!

Tuvimos la suerte de encontrar recepcionistas simpáticos y el ambiente es realmente bonito. Las habitaciones son un poco pequeñas pero muy confortables.

La habitacion comoda pero pequeña. El baño con algunos inconvenientes como que demora mucho en salir el agua caliente, asi que no es posible darse una ducha rapida. El secador de cabello (tal vez a proposito) no puede conectarse en el baño. Creo que el mismo carecia de extractor con lo cual despues del baño habia que esperar un buen rato antes de poder usar el espejo nuevamente. Con respecto al desayuno, esta bien servido, jugos naturales realmente exquisitos, sin embargo, nuevamente comparando con el nivel internacional es un poco limitado. Por ejemplo habia una seleccion de exquisitos quesos franceses y sin embargo no habia quesos magros para quienes queremos una dieta menos calorica. Finalmente, la atencion del personal de concierge y front desk impecable, muy serviciales y la ubicacion tambien inmejorable.",3,2013,10,30
150,Un classico,"A volte scrivere una recensione su un hotel su trip advisor porta a scrivere cose un po' ovvie, questa e' una di quelle volte.

Ambienti ""ricchi"" e che cercano di dare l'impressione di un lusso ""classico"". Lounge con menu' che cerca di essere ricercato. Si insomma, quello che ci aspetta da un albergo con un nome cosi' celebre a Marble Arch ! Non metto le 5 stelle, perche' l'albergo ha segni di vetusta' qui e la. Perche' il menu del lounge non cambia molto. Perche' alcuni dei dettagli ""lussuosi"" hanno dei segni un po' di cattivo gusto (""de gustibus"" ...) ... perche' il prezzo e' quello che e' ... insomma, per coloro che possono permetterlo e che vogliono la sicurezza di una scelta tradizionale, un' indirizzo che raccomando ... a due passi da selfridge, da marks e spenser, dallo speaker corners, da un cinema, da parecchi buoni pubs, e perche' no, da Primark :-)",4,2013,10,27

E' pulito, grande, moderno ma allo stesso tempo elegante, e c'è una hall per ogni piano, per non far mancare nulla all'ospite. Il personale disponibilissimo, abbiamo anche potuto lasciare lì i bagagli prima della partenza per l'ultimo giro... Di certo di alto livello, da provare!",5,2013,05,07
150,Perfetto,"Un Hotel di lusso, servizi perfetti. Personale che risolve ogni tua minima esigenza a qualsiasi ora.
Il ristorante è fantastico e offre tutto, pure il classico thè del pomeriggio.
Non è economico ma se potete andateci! Consigliato!",5,2013,04,30
150,Sus 5 Estrellas están bien puestas.,"Todo el personal están con una excelente capacitación, desde el recibimiento, estadía, y la salida todo bien. La Habitación confortable, limpia. Llama la  atención en  recepción que hay dos hombres que miden unos tres metros de alto ( Pie Grande ). La ubicación es buena, serca de todo el comercio, tiendas, museos, metro, locomociones.
Es un país muy limpio, bonito en arquitectura antigua, gente muy bien educada.",5,2013,02,08
150,Nobel und mit tollem Concierge- Service,"Da unser Flug Verspätung hatte, verpassten wir unseren reservierten Tisch im Fifteen (Jamie Oliver). Der Concierge organisierte uns sofort für den nächsten Abend einen Tisch dort. Und unser Abendessen genossen wir im Montagu im Hotel, sehr lecker. Ich hatte Wildlachs, der so saftig war, ein Gedicht. Um im Hintergrund sind life-Musiker, an unserem Abend ein Pianist.
Auch das Deponieren unserer Koffer oder Anrufe in unserem Namen wurden toll als Service angeboten.
Die Minibar ist sehr teuer, aber London ist eben nicht billig.",5,2013,02,03
150,Ottima posizione e buona struttura,"L'hotel si trova in pieno centro a due passi da Oxford street e da Hyde Park, buone le camere, splendida vista su un piccolo spazio verde. Personale professionale e attento, splendida la colazione. Atmosfera elegante. Da consigliare per chi vuole essere certo di un'ottima struttura e che non ricerca l'ambiente moderno e ricercato.",4,2013,01,30
150,Lo recomiendo!!,"Tuve la suerte de quedarme en este hotel en Noviembre de este año y debo decir que fue una experiencia fabulosa.  Toda la gente es muy amable y cooperadora.  Habia tenido un problema con mi PC y el gerente de turno personalmente lo soluciono... quede muy imprecionada con el servicio.  Había una chica en recepcion, una niña española de nombre Leticia que es encantadora y siempre dispuesta a ayudar.
El hotel esta muy bien ubicado y las habitaciones son comodas y espaciosas... la verdad que lo recomiendo a todos las personas que buscan alojar en un hotel que ofrece excelente  servicio, confort y ubicacióon.",5,2012,12,27
150,Schönes Hotel im alten Englischen Stil,"Das Hotel ist optimal nahe des Marble Arch gelegen in unmittelbarer Nähe der Oxford Street. Die Zimmer sind gut in Stand gehalten, gemütlich und anprechend möbliert. Der Blick auf den kleinen Privat Park ist sehr schön. Es gibt 2 Regency Clubs. Der eine ist renoviert und eher im alten Stil gehalten. Der zweite ist neu eröffnet und modern gehalten. Das Frühstück im Club ist einwandfrei. Es gibt eine nette, englische Bar und ein schönes Restaurant. Für den Privatpark gegenüber des Hotels kann man beim Concierge einen Schlüssel erhalten. Der Preis ist natürlich recht hoch, aber für London angemessen.",4,2012,12,22
150,Lo recomiendo,"Es un hotel muy bien ubicado, cerca del metro y de 2 importantes museos.  Todo a walking distance.  Las habitaciones son muy pequeñas pero impecables.  Esta todo nuevo y recien re-decorado. Todo el personal es muy amable y disfrute mucho de la estadia en ese hotel.",4,2012,11,28
150,Elevato standard all'altezza del nome che porta,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel a Dicembre del 2011, per capodanno.
La posizione era ottima, la piazza davanti all'hotel molto carina e tranquilla, ma molto vicina ad Oxford Street, la fermata della metro di Marble Arch a quattro minuti a piedi, quindi direi tutto comodamente raggiungibile.
La camera forse un po'piccola ma molto accoglilente, dotata di tutti confort e pulita, il bagno decisamente nuovo.
Avevamo anche la colazione inclusa, buffet abbondante e con buona varietà di cose da scegliere, inoltre potevamo anche ordinare omelettes e pancakes, fatti espressi dallo chef nella scenografica cucina a vista del ristorante, io ho provato i pancakes, erano superlativi.",5,2012,11,11
150,Hotel Bellissimo con tutti i Comfort,"Sono stato in questo Hotel per lavoro, la camera è straordinaria, tutti i confort possibili. La colazione eccezionale. E' in posizione molto centrale, a pochi passi da Oxford Street, via dello shopping londinese e a pochi passi da Park Lane, una delle zone più in della città.",5,2012,10,17
150,Sehr gut gelegenes Business-Hotel,"Das Hotel befindet sich am Portmann Square nur wenige 100-Meter entfernt von der Oxford-Street. Nächste Underground ist Marble Arch (7 Gehminuten), wo auch die meisten Sight-Seeing Busse halten. Wir haben eine 1-Bedroom Suite gebucht, die (für London) sehr geräumig war. Grosses Schlafzimmer, neu renoviertes Bad. WIFI inroom funktionierte tadellos. Die Einrichtung ist schlicht und funktional. Der Executive Floor bietet Zugang zu zwei Lounges, wo auch das Frühstück serviert wird. Tolles Buffet, Staff war leider nicht so aufmerksam. Im Übrigen war das Hotel-Team sehr hilfreich, zB. wenn es um das Buchen von Ausflügen ging. Restaurants und Bars eher im Business-Stil und mehr funktional als wirklich einladend. Zusammengefasst eine sehr gute Wahl, wenn man in London zentral wohnen möchte. Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Kein Pool/ SPA-Bereich.",4,2012,08,08
150,LO MEJOR EN LONDRES,"Es un  hotel muy bueno con una excelente atención, su ubicación es perfecta y las habitaciones de Club regency son perfectas respecto a su servicio. Son muy confortables y tienen vista al parque, la decoración es muy buena",5,2012,08,02
150,Gran servicio,"Realmente el servicio de lo mejor. Hicimos late check out sin cargo. Las habitaciones comodas y completas. Muy buena la ubicacion. Las habitaciones con mejor vista pertenecen a las del club de hyatt. El desayuno lo mejor, completisimo desde variedad de frutas hasta riquisimos panqueques.",5,2012,07,26
150,El mejor 5* después del María Cristina,"Hotelazo, vinimos por visitar la ciudad. (Muy bonita, por cierto). Era una maravilla: buen desayuno, buena calidad de sueño por no hablar del fantástico servicio. Habitaciones muy suficientes. La gente de la limpieza pasaba 2 veces al día. Si hablábamos español, nos traían uno para estar más cómodos.",5,2012,07,18
150,"HOTEL CLASICO, MUY BUENO Y CENTRICO","Me ha parecido un hotel excelente, a 5 minutos de Oxford Street. Muy bien insonorizado porque no se oye ni un solo ruido exterior y eso que daba a la calle. Los desayunos impresionantes, todo muy cuidado y limpio. El personal muy amable. Durante las dos noches de estancia tuve la suerte de poder admirar la exposción ""Making Waves: International Contemporary Art from the Saatchi Galery"" que estará hasta octubre de 2012. La obra archiconocida de Chris Levine, un retrato de la Reina de Inglaterra con los ojos cerrados ""Lightnes of Being"" preside la recepcion. Aunque no estés instalado en el hotel, merece la pena ir a tomar el té y disfrutar de este arte moderno. Para ser un hotel de esta categoría no me pareció nada caro.

Lo único que eché de menos es una persona en recepción que sepa español: los que ya tenemos cierta edad es de agradecer el que nos entiendan. Así y todo nos hemos defendido bastante bien.

Alrededor del hotel hay diversos tipos de pequeños restaurantes para disfrutar de una comida distinta a la del restaurante del hotel ""The Churchill"".  

He estado encantada y es muy recomendable. Para mi ha sido todo bueno.",5,2012,07,18
150,Posizione strategica,"Premetto che sono stato due volte in questa struttura,nel 2008 e nel 2009,assieme alla mia famiglia.L'hotel è ubicato a pochi passi da oxford street,vicino alla fermata della metro di marble arch.Adattissimo quindi a passeggiate per fare shopping,nonchè per visitare il west end.
L'hotel è un equivalente di un buon quattro stelle italiano.Le camere sono un po' piccole (sopprattutto per l'aggiunta di un terzo letto)ma molto pulite e ben arredate.Il bagno è confortevole e dotato di vasca.Il personale è veramente gentile e disponibile.All'interno della struttura esistono due ristoranti,il montagu dove è anche possibile fare un'eccellente colazione(la cucina è a vista)e preparano ottime omelette al momento,e udite udite la famosa Locanda Locatelli.
E' un ristorante italiano stellato michelin,dove previa prenotazione con discreto anticipo si può pranzare o cenare gustando piatti della cucina italiana di alto livello.E' chiaramente un po' troppo caro per i nostri canoni,ma cortesia, servizio ineccepibile oltre ad una carta dei vini veramente importante il tutto unito ad un menù che esalta l'utilizzo delle materie prime fanno sì che la spesa risulti assolutamente adeguata anche considerando il fatto che ci troviamo in centro a Londra e la città è molto cara.",4,2012,06,12
150,simplemente excelente!,"De los mejores hoteles que he visitado. La atencion impecable, nunca me senti tan bien tratada en un hotel. El bar Chuchill imperdible para tomar un cocktail y escuchar tocar el piano. Si estás en londres, al menos vale la pena ir al bar! La vista a la plaza enfrente, hermosa!",5,2012,05,20
150,"Tolle Lage, sehr schönes Hotel","Ich blieb 2 Nächte im Hyatt Regency London und genoss meinen Aufenthalt. Die Zimmer sind groß, komfortabel, sauber und sehr ruhig. Es war viel besser als fast jede andere Hotel in dem ich in London geblieben. Der Service war auch sehr professionell, das Hotel war das Personal freundlich, schnell und sehr hilfreich. Der Regency Club Lounge war auch schön, mit einer guten Auswahl an Snacks und Getränken. Last but not least, die Lage ist großartig: Es ist zentral gelegen und hat leichten Zugang zu der Tube (U-Bahn).",5,2012,03,29
150,Un lujo,"El hotel maravilloso.
El personal muy profesional y amable, haciendote en todo momento sentirte agusto.
A la llegada nos encontramos con una bandeja de fruta de cortesia y dos cartas personalizadas de bievenida, son detalles que se agradecen.
La habitación comoda y elegantemente amueblada.
La cama perfecta.
Es un hotel muy por encima de los que puedes encontrar en Londres.",5,2012,03,15
150,BUENA SITUACION,"Estuve 3 noches en este hotel con 3 amigos, y la verdad que vale hasta la ultima libra que vale, el servicio impecable, las habitaciones muy correctas, y a la hora de salir de fiesta, consiguieron que entráramos a la discoteca mas de moda, por la zona vip, muy buen servicio y esta muy bien situado, a dos calles de la famosa Oxford Street",5,2012,03,09
150,Grande colazione in camera,"Sono stata al Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill in Dicembre per un weekend. Buona la posizione vicino ad Oxford Street, con metro facilmente raggiungubile a piedi. Hotel di livello, veramante signorile e di classe. Stanza spaziosa, letto meraviglioso e fantastica colazione in camera (molto cara, ahimè...ma merita di provarla).",4,2012,02,20
150,Un oasis en Portman Square,"El Churchill destaca por su céntrica a la vez que tranquila ubicación. El hall mantiene el estilo clásico muy british del antiguo ""Churchill Intercontinental"" pero las habitaciones son muy modernas, y sobrias en la línea Hyatt, muy cómodas y sorprendentemente amplias para los estándares londinenses.",4,2012,01,26
150,Grande Hyatt the Churchill!!!!!!!,"Ho soggiornato 3 notti all'Hyatt Regency The Churchill nel luglio 2011. Ho fatto il miglior soggiorno della mia vita (finora) in un hotel, e l'ho pagato fior di quattrini. Una mini suite (nono piano, circa 55 metri quadri) costa 1000 euro a notte, colazione inclusa. Ma ragazzi, ne vale la pena............! A quei livelli la colazione (posate d'argento) è servita in una Lounge separata dal resto dell'albergo (mai incontrati i clienti delle stanze ""normali"") e la lounge è aperta tutto il giorno per bibite ecc. Uno stuolo di camerieri per servirti, la pulizia della suite può essere effettuata a qualunque ora tu la chiedi, terrazza privata (ultimo piano) e privacy garantita...insomma c'è tutto. La cena in camera è ottima, anche la cucina italiana, e il prezzo accettabile (70 sterline circa, ma senza vino). Le suite hanno una reception riservata, all'ottavo piano. Manco a dirlo, gli ospiti erano tutti arabi del Golfo con servitù al seguito. Un'esperienza strepitosa. Consigliatissima.",5,2012,01,16
150,Disattese aspettative,"Mi sono recato per lavoro a Londra ed ho cercato un albergo nei pressi del luogo dell'appuntamento, scegliendo questo albergo anche dopoaver letto alcune recensioni.
Che delusione, scarsissimo rapporto prezzo/qualità, camera piccola e pulizia al limite,considerando anche il livello attribuito alla struttura, internet a pagamento.
Nel mentre il personale e' stato molto cortese e disponibile, l'ubicazione e' strategica.",3,2012,01,11
150,Londra tutta da vivere,"Io e mio marito abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel londinese per un breve periodo, ma è stato sufficiente per farci desiderare di ritornarvi al più presto. Qui tutto è stato impeccabile, dall'accoglienza ricevuta all'arrivo, all'assistenza ricevuta dalla conciergerie per la risoluzione di un piccolo problema con la compagnia aerea. L'edificio in perfetto stile british quanto all'esterno, è sorprendentemente caldo al suo interno. Le camere sono arredate in modo sobrio ma elegante dotate di tutti i conforts per un cinque stelle, la hall così come la zona bar è di gran classe con magnifici addobbi natalizi, esposizioni permanenti di artisti d'avanguardia, un accogliente camino ed uno splendido pianoforte a coda. Unico neo, a voler esser pignoli, le dimensioni del bagno, un po' piccolo rispetto alle dimensioni della camera. La posizione dell'hotel, a due passi dalla stazione di Marble Arch, è centralissima e consente di raggiungere a piedi le principali vie per lo shopping. Ultima nota da segnalare la colazione, assolutamente strepitosa e risponde a tutte le possibili esigenze. Consigliatissimo.",5,2011,12,21
150,Muy buen hotel,"Excelente hotel con una ubicación ideal. No es barato pero merece la pena. Es un auténtico 5 estrellas con los toques de calidad y servicio de Hyatt. 
Especialmente tranquilo.",5,2011,11,25
150,Gutes Hotel,"Hyatt Regency ist ein oft besuchtes Hotel von mir. Sehr ein freundlicher und kompetenter Service, saubere und grosszügige Zimmer. Ebenso sehr praktisch für Geschäftsleute (Internet und so läuft bestens). Auch das Housekeeping läuft sehr gut. HAbe kürzlich um Mitternacht ein sehr gutes Club Sandwich bestellt. Schnell, gut und freundlich. Gerne wieder.",4,2011,11,20
150,Eccellente,"La straordinaria eleganza di questo hotel si percepisce già all'ingresso : stile classico e sobrio, lussuoso ma non kitsch. L'atrio ha una bellissima pavimentazione in marmo che si abbina perfettamente al calore degli arredi in mogano. La professionalità del personale è di ottimo livello, i portieri sono discreti e non invadenti. La camera era di medie dimensioni, comoda per due persone, il bagno impeccabilmente pulito (mi capita spesso di dover richiedere una pulizia supplementare o un cambio di camera per carenza di pulizia in hotels di pari livello), agli italiani farà piacere trovare il bidet, il letto king comodissimo con i cuscini stranamente senza odori sgradevoli(altro spiacevole inconveniente che purtroppo riscontro frequentemente), l'arredo coerente con lo stile della struttura, il riscaldamento perfettamente controllabile, la finestra ampia, la manutenzione eccellente ( non un solo segno di usura ). Il bar dove abbiamo preso un aperitivo è molto caldo ed accogliente con un piacevole ""caminetto tecnologico"". La Locanda Locatelli si conferma al top dei ristoranti di Londra, eravamo già stati qualche mese fa e ritorneremo ancora. La colazione è a dir poco faraonica: il buffet dei dolci sembra il banco di una pasticceria per quantità e varietà ,anche la scelta dei cibi salati è molto interessante, pane di vario genere, anche al pomodoro, spremute fresche, frutta fresca curatissima, addirittura le arance e i pompelmi a spicchi a cui viene tolta anche la pellicina trasparente. Qui nulla è casuale e tutto è previsto in funzione di viaggiatori molto esigenti. Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.Consigliatissimo
Cinzia, Udine",5,2011,11,14
150,comodissimo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel 4 notti nel mese di ottobre 2010 e siamo stati molto fortunati, perchè  nonostante la nomea circa il tempo, abbiamo trascorso quattro giorni in compagnia del sole e di un clima fantastico. Lo Hyatt e' un ottimo hotel che si trova in una zona centralissima, sia per lo shopping che per visitare la città. Molto  pulita la stanza e il bagno, la vista non era niente di che. Il  personale molto cortese  e disponibile e... soprattutto il letto era comodissimo. 
La colazione un pò cara  ma buona.
Da consigliare sicuramente.",4,2011,08,30
150,Schöner Blick über den Portman Square,"Wir hatten die Executive Etage gebucht und hatten ein Zimmer auf der obersten Etage mit Balkon und Ausblick über den Portman Square, was sehr schön war. Die Baustelle unten von der Strasse her hat man nur ein wenig gehört. Das Zimmer (Schlafzimmer und Wohnzimmer) war sehr schön und modern eingerichtet, sauber, geräumig. Sogar eine Yoga-Matte stand zur Verfügung einschließlich der entsprechenden Yoga-DVD's. Die Lounge zum Frühstücken war leider die meiste Zeit überfüllt und in der Ersatzlounge war zwar Platz, aber das Buffet war wesentlich kleiner und er Service eher halbherzig und desorientiert.",5,2011,08,28
150,Come stare comodi ed in centro a Londra,"Personalmente non amo Londra ed a maggior ragione nel freddo di Gennaio ma questo hotel mi ha veramente reso le cose piu' semplici.
VI ho soggiornato per business e turismo 5 giorni in una camera executive con prima colazione ed il personale, l'atmosfera dell'hotel e la location mi hanno reso questo soggiorno idimenticabile, come mai prima mi era capitato a Londra.
Le camere innanzi tutto sono di dimensioni vivibili, pulite e con letti comodissimi.
Il ristorante sia per la colazione che per la cena e' fornitissimo ed elegantissimo (forse anche un poco ""snobby"" ma visto il range dell'hotel aspettarsi un well come familiare sarebbe fuori luogo).
Ogni piano e' dotato di una zona di disimpegno di fronte agli ascensori, molto calda ed accogliente.
Ve lo consiglio sia per vacanze che per affari.",5,2011,08,26
150,Ottimo hotel,"E' il migliore albergo di Londra in cui sono stato durente i miei soggiorni in questa città. Avendo già soggiornato in altri alberghi della catena Hyatt ed essendomi sempre trovato molto bene, sono andato a colpo sicuro. Naturalmente, essendo un albergo di grandi dimensioni e piuttosto indicato per viaggi di affari, non é l'albergo che tanti credono di trovare, ossia ambiente famigliare ecc. Comunque, il personale del bar, del ristorante e della reception, sono molto cordiali. Ho pranzato una sola volta al ristorante ed ho trovato la cucina internazionale molto buona. Camere molto pulite.",5,2011,08,06
150,"Eins der besten hotels die ich kenne, ich komme gern wieder wenn der preis stimmt","Ein super Hotel in London zu normalerweise nicht bezahlbaren preisen...zwischen Weihnachten und Neujahr konnten wir ein Schnaeppchen machen...230 Euro pro nacht ist zwar fuer deutsche Verhaeltnisse noch sehr viel, fuer dieses Hotel allerdings ein Schnaeppchen.
Man muss hier mal gewohnt haben, riesige Empfangshalle, leckeres Essen in der Lounge, Upgarde fuer Diamond Members mit Voucher auf eine Suite...alles in allem muss man sagen, wir kommen wieder wenn der preis stimmt",5,2011,02,13
150,"Eins der besten Hotels in London, sehr edel und nobel","Eine Nacht im Hyatt London, mehr gab der geldbeutel leider nicht her...trotz der guenstigsten rate ueberhaupt liegt man bei diesem Hotel immer bei mindestens 230 Euro pro Nacht. Das Hotel hat den charm einer schin vergangenen Zeit, sehr edel, nobel und nur zu empfehlen fuer einen London Besuch.
Nach Nutzung eines Suite Upgrades erhielten wir eine nette Deluxe Suite mit seperatem Arbeits und Wohnbereich, normalerweise haette diese um 800 Pfund gekostet. der Regencyclub ist sehr zu empfehlen, auch wenn ich den Aufpreis, den das Hotel dafuer verlangt im vergleich zum Standardzimmer uebertrieben finde.
Als Diamondmember von Hyatt erhaelt man diesen Gratis und die abendliche Cocktailhour ersetzt locker ein Abendessen in London 9sehr reichhaltig mit salaten, fleisch, fisch etc.)",5,2011,02,13
150,Setzt sich von anderen Hotels in London leicht ab,"Na ja, günstig ist in London kein Hotel, selbst B&B. Der Service, das Ambiente und und und... ist in einem Hyatt eben anders, nämlich besser als in anderen Hotels.
Die Lage ist günstig, zu Fuß von dort gleich in die Innenstadt (und Marble Arch und zum Buckingham-Palast).
Abends in der Churchill-Bar - wunderbar.",5,2010,11,12
150,Hyatt Regency - The Churchill,"Grosses, zentral (direkt hinter der Oxfordstreet) gelegens Hotel. Schöne Bar und grosszügiges Restaurant mit einer stylischen Atmosphäre. Zuvorkommendes und hilfsbereites Personal. Zimmer sind sauber, grosszügig und mit einem Flatscreen ausgerüstet. Relativ ruhige Umgebung. 5 Minuten zu Fuss bis zur Oxfordstreet, 10 Minuten bis Marble Arch und ca. 12 Minuten mit zum Speakers Corner (Hyde Park). Persönlich fand ich die Bar sehr einladend.",5,2010,11,06
150,Elegante e raffinato ma sostanzialmente anonimo,"Di fatto è situato in una posizione centralissima a due passi dalla stazione dell'Underground di Marble Arch.

Grandiosa hall, ampi spazi, camere molto pulite, ordinate e accessoriate, ristorante ampio e luminoso.

I difetti: tutto molto ben curato ma fondamentalmente anonimo, un hotel di lusso ma senza passione. Inoltre prezzi davvero esagerati per quanto riguarda le colazioni e il ristorante.

Se chiedete un letto aggiuntivo, anche al momento della prenotazione, questo sarà minuscolo e scomodo.",3,2010,11,04
150,perfekte Lage,"Erstaunt waren wir, als wir beim Einchecken von der Mitarbeiterin auch noch auf deutsch angesprochen wurden ( muss man ja nun wirklich nicht erwarten). Leider war unser Aufenthalt nur sehr kurz, sodass wir nur den Gesamteindruck bewerten können. Die Erwartungen, die man an ein Hotel dieser Kategorie und Preisklasse stellt werden in jeder Hinsicht erfüllt. Als ideal empfanden wir die Lage: Marble Arch/ Speaker's Corner 7', Oxford Street 3', nächste Tube 5', jeweils fußläufig. Ob es allerdings zeitgemäß ist, für die Internetnutzung im Hotel noch einen nicht unbeträchtlichen Betrag zu verlangen, mag bei dem Nächtigungspreis dahinstehen bleiben.",5,2010,10,04
150,"Gute Lage, guter Preis, aber keine Top-kategorie","Die Lage ist sehr gut, 3 Minuten von Oxford Street, 5 Minuten von New Bond Street. Portland Square ist ein kleiner ruhiger Park. Rezeption hat gesagt, dass die mich upgraden haben. Ich habe aber nichts an dem Zimmer gemerkt. Leider durch die Tür habe ich alle andere Gaste gehört, die vom Lift zu ihre Tür gegangen sind und ich habe alle Tür schliessen auch gehört. Das Wasser war sehr schwach im Toilet, ich musste mindestens dreimal spülen. Sonst das Zimmer war OK, einfache elegante internationale Einrichtung. Concierge war behilflich mit boarding pass, buchen Restaurant und mit Regenschirm. Frühstück war ganz gut. Es gibt bessere Hotel in London, besonders mit besserer Schlafqualitat, aber mit 200 GBP mit Frühstück war es auch preisgünstiger.",4,2010,10,03
150,Gutes Businesshotel,"Da Hyatt Regency bietet ein gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis für Londoner Verhältnisse. Die  Zimmer sind ordentlich, der IPod fähige Wecker kam mir sehr gelegen. Nicht zeitgemäss ist das Bad. Das Personal war sehr hilfsbereit. Insbesondere wurde dafür gesorgt, dass der online check-in gratis im Businesscenter durchgeführt werden konnte. Eine voravisierte Sendung (Einkauf auf UK-online shop) war registriert und wurde nach Ankunft sofort ausgehändigt.",4,2010,09,14
150,Zentrales & gediegenes Business Hotel,Sehr zentral gelegenes Business-Hotel am Portman-Square. Hyde-Park und alle Shopping-Möglichkeiten in der Oxford-Street fußläufig - ohne Parkprobleme- erreichbar.  Hervorragendes Frühstücks-Buffet. Ausgezeichnete Bar & gutes Restaurant. Hervorragende Besprechungsmöglichkeiten. Zimmer sehr ruhig und gediegene Ausstattung; Personal höflich und kompetent. Roomservice schnell und freundlich! WLAN vorhanden.,5,2010,09,10
150,Nicht so gut wie das ANdaz,Ich kann das Hotel nicht empfehlen da zu teuer und unangenehmes Gefühl. Die Rezeption war unfähig mich und meine Freundin zügig einzuchecken war wohl ne Aushilfe. Die Zimmer sehr rustikal und bieder. Die Flure sehr niedrig und drückend alle paar Meter eine Überwachungskamera an der Decke. Im Bereich vor den Fahrstühlen war wohl für eine Konferenz ein Kaffeküche eingerichtet so dass man immer durch ein Gruppe von Anzugträgern durch musste. Sauna war auch in einem miserablen zustand. Schwach! Einzig positiv es liegt keine 5 Minuten vom Hydepark,3,2010,08,07
150,"Ganz ok, aber kleine Mängel","Die Zimmer sind gross genug, Fenster lassen sich nur ganz wenig öffnen. Bad ist auch ok, Sauberkeit auch.
Nachmittags kommt ein Früchteteller auf Kosten des Hauses.
Zu bemängeln ist, dass der Internetzugang zu teuer ist. Man kann sich an der Rezeption einen Code holen, mit dem man eine gewisse Zeit kostenlos im Business Center ins Internet kann.
Concierge Service ist super, Rezeption Staff auch sehr professionell.
Es gibt in den besseren Zimmern Amenities von Molton Brown, in der normalen Kategorie andere. Es wäre schön, wenn es in allen Zimmern Molton Brown geben würde.
Auch schade, dass es kein Schwimmbad gibt, kann man in London nicht wirklich erwarten.
Die Lage des Hotels ist super und sehr nahe der Oxford Street.",4,2010,06,20
150,Gute Lage,"Das Hyatt war mit fast 300 Pfund schon ein wenig teuer. Dafür bekamen wir eine souveräne Leistung ohne Mängel. Check-in durch einen duetschen lief reibungslos und zuvorkommend. Viele gute Tipps, eine wirklich gute map und der Tipp, dass jeder, der beim kostenlosen goldpassport Programm mitmacht, morgens Tee oder Kaffee mit Keksen umsonst bekommt, waren ein echter Mehrwert. Die Zimmer waren renoviert, modern ausgestattet und nachts auch zur Strasse hin leise. Empfehlenswert ist der High Tea in der Lounge.",5,2010,06,06
150,Hotel molto bello,"Lhotel è moderno e ben curato, personale cordiale. Camera ampia e ben arredata; bagno perfetto. Talvolta i doorman dell hotel un pò distratto e trovato a chiaccherare con i colleghi anzichè aprire la porta o aiutare gli ospiti a scendere dal taxi.
Palestra un pò piccolina e non ho trovato gli spogliatoi per accedere alla sauna.
Buona posizione.",5,2010,04,10
150,Hyatt Churchill bucht fremde Zimmerrechnung auf meine Kreditkarte,"Leider mußte ich in diesem Hotel eine unschöne Erfahrung machen. Man hat mir ohne Genehmigung GBP 100 von meiner Kreditkarte abgebucht, die ich dort zum Ausgleich meiner Rechnung vorgelegt habe. Auf Nachfrage teilte man mir zuerst mit, daß es nur eine Authorisierung sei und die Gutschrift schon erfolgt wäre. Dann aber, auf erneute Nachfrage, mailte man mir die Rechnung einer fremden Person eines anderen Zimmers und sagte, daß es sich um diese Rechnung handeln würde. Damit war der Fall für das Hotel wohl erledigt. Es handelt sich offensichtlich um einen Fehler eines Mitarbeiters, der aber nicht korrigiert wird. Diese Rechnung wurde mit meiner Kreditkarte manuell bearbeitet. Etliche Beschwerden an das Hotel und auch den Customer Service von Hyatt blieben erfolglos. Ich bin völlig fassungslos; so etwas habe ich in den 30 Jahren meiner Reisetätigkeit mit Kreditkarte noch nicht erlebt. Nun bleibt nur der langwierige Weg über Mastercard mit Wartezeit, eidesstattlichen Versicherungen etc. Für mich gilt nach dieser Erfahrung: nie wieder Hyatt!",1,2010,02,22
150,"C'è tutto lo stile Hyatt, moderno, lussuoso e fantastico ma imperfetto!","Ho pernottato con la mia famiglia allo Hyatt per una settimana e devo dire nel complessivamente ne sono rimasto soddisfatto!(con i fiocchi). L'albergho è praticamente nuovo,in centro, in una piazza davvero molto bella. La hall è fantastica ed esprime tutto il lusso che un Hyatt è perfettamente in grado di offrire (visto anche le sue cinque stelle lusso), ogni singolo particolare, dai fiori alle candele, alle colonne per finiri ai vasi sprizza lusso da tutte le parti!(Perfino gli ascensori e i corridoi per le camere sono bellissimi)...Lo staff è molto cortese, simpatico,disponibile e servizievole. La colazione è servita nel ristorante dell'albergho ""The Montangu"" (anche questo extra lusso) e pur essendo molto cara (circa 900€ per tre per una settimana) è esclusiva ed offre qualsisi tipo di cibo e se neppure i lussuosi banconi in marmo della english breakfast o della continental breakfast sono sufficienti si può sempre ordinare gratuitamente dalla cucina qualsisi cosa si voglia. Il servizio è veloce, scorrevole ed impeccabile. La pulizia generale dell'hotel è perfetta sia degli ambienti comuni che delle camere. Ora però arriviamo alle imperfezioni, premettendo che ho ricevuto una standar room (comunque molto bella) con una vista orribile però al posto di una view room, ma questo è stato comunque un problema di comunicazione fra l'agenzia di viaggio e l'albergo (questione a me non ancora del tutto chiara). Al nostro arrivo in camera non abbiamo trovato assolutamente niente, intendo un cesto di frutta o non so dei cioccolatini e delle caramelle, ne la televisione accesa con su scritto qualche riga di benvenuto, cosa a mio parere sconcertante avendo pagato molto ed allongiando in un 5 stelle e non un qualunque 5 stelle voglio dire staimo parlando dello Hyatt. Solo il giorno seguente qualcuno ha buttato per terra nell'ingresso della nostra camera un foglio, che abbiamo notato solo perchè l'abbiamo calpestato, con su scritto ""welcome"" e gli orari della colazione con la firma dell'amministratore generale, cosa che io trovo assolutamente scandalosa!!! Nonostante questo (ke è abbastanza) consiglio vivamente questo albergo che posso inoltre classificare come uno dei migliori di Londra!!",4,2009,07,17
150,London halt...,"Tolles Haus, tolle Lobby and dann wie immer eine Besenkammer als Zimmer. Zwar nett gestaltet, aber winzig... Mehr Schein als Sein.",3,2009,06,07

La posizione dell'hotel è eccellente, è a solo un isolato da oxford street. I costi del bar e ristorante sono alti, ma per chi sceglie un 5 stelle è consapevole di ciò. In definitiva la mia esperienza in questo hotel è nettamente positiva.",5,2008,03,25
