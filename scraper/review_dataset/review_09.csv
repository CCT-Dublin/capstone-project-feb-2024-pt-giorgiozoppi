09,Grand Hotel Courmayeur is definitely Grand!,"We stayed at the the Grand Hotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc for 4 nights while hiking the TMB.  This hotel was a welcome respite after a day on the trail.  It is a beautiful hotel with spacious and comfortable rooms.  The staff were incredibly helpful from making recommendations for restaurants to the shuttle service they provided.  It started with reception personally escorting us to our room.  We appreciated the shuttle service, especially driver Andrea (sp?) who took us wherever we needed to go.  We were particularly impressed with Nando, one of the managers, who took the time to sit and talk with us about the hotel, the area and the culture.  He helped us make some decisions that enhanced our experience.",5,2024,09,19
09,Amazing hotel and tremendous staff!,"Stupendous hotel! Beautiful lobby, restaurant, bar, and rooms. The smell when you walk into the lobby is heavenly! One of the managers, Nando, was so friendly and helpful! He helped us when we were torn about our TMB hike on a rainy day, he gave us wonderful advice and we ended up having a wonderful hike despite the rain. The front desk staff recommended amazing local restaurants and made our reservations and we took the hotel shuttle to and from. The bar staff is fantastic, very friendly and knowledgeable. We did not want to leave this hotel! We hope to get back here someday.",5,2024,09,09
09,Exceptional stay in Courmayeur,"We had an amazing stay at the Hotel Grand Courmayeur in the middle of our Tour du Mont Blanc. Our room was beautiful and we very well attended throughout our stay. The shuttle service offered was invaluable, and their recommendations for dinner were perfect. We enjoyed the restaurant and bar in the hotel as well, and received consistently great service. It was a fantastic place to recharge for the second half of the TMB.",5,2024,08,17
09,"Great stay at Grand Hotel, Courmayeur","We arrived for a 3 nights stay at the hotel, and found what we were expecting, and much more. Hotel location very comfortable, and the shuttle to nearby attractions saved us a lot of time. The rooms with the mountains view were clean, large enough, and modern. The hotel overall is very modern.
Breakfast served every morning in the dining room facing the remarkable Mont Blanc view.
Anything you had in mind, was served in Breakfast.
The Staff is very helpful, for any inquiry or help needed.
Would like to specify front desk reps, 
Ms. Greta and Christian for their service oriented attitude.

09,"Highly recommended, excellent hotel","I highly recommend the hotel: the rooms are pleasant and beautifully designed, the location is excellent, the breakfast is indulgent, the view is breathtaking, and the staff is kind and caring, doing everything to make the stay at the hotel and in the city enjoyable, giving precise recommendations—where to eat, sites in the area, etc. I'm sure we'll be back.",5,2024,08,13
09,"Mountain view, excellent service, super facilities and great location","Spent four night on this beautiful hotel, in a room w fantastic Mountain View. Excellent  service in all functions - reception, spa, restaurants, parking etc - very kind and super professional. Great location In  Courmayeur. We’ve been there three times before, summer and winter, and will for sure choose this hotel again.",5,2024,08,13
09,Poor food,"Beautiful views and great location on the edge of Courmayeur. Shuttle service from the hotel in and out of town is really useful. The rooms are a good size and have a good sized balcony. That's the good part. The food is shockingly poor for any hotel let alone 5 star. Breakfast was a minimal choice, and the hot selections were cold. If you asked for fresh hot food they put it through a microwave. Really not acceptable. This is a very expensive hotel and I had hoped for more.",3,2024,07,27
09,A few nights in Courmayeur.,This hotel was the most amazing respite from our TMB hike. The rooms were gorgeous and the beds incredible comfortable. The spa was beautiful and very well appointed. There was nothing I could say negatively about this hotel. The staff was incredibly attentive and the breakfast was A Plus!,5,2024,07,24
09,"One of the best accommodations, if not the best, of our 5 week Italy trip.","We really loved our stay at the Grand Hotel Courmayeur. In our view, although the facility was beautiful, the attentive and helpful staff made our visit very memorable. All of the staff were extremely courteous and I wish I had everyone’s name to mention here, especially those at the front desk. Nando and Alessandro  were especially friendly and helpful. Many of the staff recognized us in town on their off hours and greeted us. As far as other aspects, breakfast was outstanding, served in a room that overlooked the mountains. Pretty much anything you asked for could be had. A beautiful lounge was available to relax, also with a great view. Everything was absolutely spotless including our room and bathroom. I will say that if you prefer a more historic feel, you might be disappointed, but we found the modern decor tasteful and inventive. If available, try and get a room in the B or C buildings, which I think might have better views and be a bit quieter than Bldg A. Be prepared, there is no A/C. It was fairly comfortable in our room while we were there, but only with our balcony door open, which meant the room could be noisy with early morning auto and construction noise. Lastly, the included spa amenities such as the heated pool, steam and sauna, and aromatic showers were a nice touch. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,24
09,Amazing stay,"We spent 3 nights with friends. Place is beautiful. Staff incredible. Rooms are clean, breakfast so good, plenty of food. Nando the manager, Alessandro and Wiam so kind with us. For sure we’ll be back in the winter season with some other friends.",5,2024,07,21
09,Truly a Great Stay,"We booked here last minute after walking the Tour De Mont Blanc. The staff went out of their way to make everyone comfortable, recommended a great local restaurant and welcomed us. The rooms are very comfortable, amazing bath/shower, quiet and decorated in an elevated way to suit this spectacular town.",5,2024,07,21
09,Courmayeur's newest and best hotel!,"I've been to Grand Hotel twice this month to escape Milan's hot summer days. The property is a modern 5 star with beautiful rooms with a spacious balcony. Bathrooms have a giant bathtub, open shower and lots of space. I also had a walk in closet with a coffee machine and complimentary water. The spa area is beautiful and they have Cinq Mondes products which are my favorite. Pool and sauna area are brand new and very well designed. Nando, the Chief of Reception is an absolute rockstar helping guests and really suggesting them ideas to optimise their stay. I also had a beautiful dinner at La Fourchette. Breakfast is unbelievable too: freshly made mountain butter, bread are made in house soo. A collection of fruit jams awaits you... not to forget cakes, pastries, cheese, pancakes with real maple syrup, egg, bacon etc.  An outstanding hotel that deserves not less than a 5 stars rating!",5,2024,07,20
09,An amazing stay from start to finish,"The hotel from start to finish was a great experience, from the front desk staff to the spa team nothing was too much trouble. 

Nando was great in welcoming us almost like we were family and the whole experience was amazing! 

I will definitely look to come here again for ski season and would have no issues recommending this hotel as the place to stay when visiting Courmayeur!",5,2024,07,14
09,Luxury mountain escape,"Wonderfully located hotel in beautiful Courmayeur. Hotel facilities were great, we enjoyed the spa and rooms were specious and well equipped. Nando was a brilliant host and the staff helped us book a lovely restaurant in town for dinner. Will definitely come back in the ski season to check it out!",5,2024,07,14
09,Disappointing,"We travel to Courmayeur monthly and thought to give this 5* beautifully looking hotel a try. 

However, it could hardly pass for a 4*.

First massive let down - air conditioning. I understand that we are in a mountain region and temperatures are cooler for most of the year but summers in Courmayeur are pretty warm and a 5* hotel with no AC is not acceptable. In our instance we had 25 degrees celcius theoughout our trip and room temperature was getting over 26 which is far from a comfortable night’s sleep, especially when you’re travelling with a 1 year old and are unable to close the windows to prevent outdoor noise for day naps and night’s sleep. 

Gym is a sauna for the same reason and totally unusable if you’re looking to do cardio. 

Reception standards definitely don’t stand a chance of a 5* hotel. Having asked some information about the spa I was told to go in the room and call them myself. Also, on the morning of our check-out we were not even asked if we need help with our bags when we came downstairs with full hands + a toddler. 

On the positive note, they offer a great breakfast selection and the breakfast staff are quite attentive. 

Overall quite disappointing as it is a beautiful hotel in an amazing location but the service definitely doesn’t stand a chance of 5*.",2,2024,07,12
09,Excellent!!!!,"The Grand Hotel Courmayeur is truly a gem in Mont Blanc. Located in the most stunning spot with a direct view of the breathtaking Mont Blanc, this hotel offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere from the moment you arrive. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure your comfort, providing complimentary drinks, chocolates, and cookies upon arrival.

The rooms are beautifully decorated in a nature-inspired style and come equipped with all the amenities you could need, including coffee, water, and snacks. The dining room staff are incredibly generous and accommodating, even staying open late to ensure you have a meal.

Nando, the front desk manager, is a true professional who goes out of his way to make sure your stay is unforgettable. The value for money at this hotel is outstanding, making it a highly recommended choice for your next stay in Courmayeur. Thank you to the amazing team at the Grand Hotel Courmayeur for a wonderful experience. #LuxuryTravel #GrandHotelCourmayeur #MontBlancView.",5,2024,07,11
09,"Stunning views, friendly hospitality","This is our second stay at GHCMB. It's a top notch property with clean design and stunning views of the Mont Blanc. Everyone is super nice: reception desk, restaurant staff, drivers of the shuttle, the spa team. We had to leave early in the morning for our kids’ ice skating lessons and the breakfast staff was always helpful and accommodating. If you travel with small kids a fantastic public playground is immediately next to the hotel",5,2024,07,07
09,Best view in the Alps!,"What a lovely hotel!! We loved everything about this place from the ambience to the service. The hotel staff is excellent especially Nadio. The view from our room of Mont Blanc is absolutely stunning!!
We will be back here!!
The town of courmayeur is so charming.
The shops, restaurants and architecture is amazing.",5,2024,07,06
09,What a gem!,"What a gem! I spent a night in that beautiful hotel on the Montblanc. I booked over the phone and received a perfect service. Upon arrival, a valet parked my car, the reception did a quick and efficient check in and brought me to my room. My room was spotless, brand new with a stunning view on the mountain. Their pool area is amazing. Breakfast was very well presented and displayed quality products. Staff was smiling and extremely kind. What to say, this hotel is the gem of Courmayeur. It's modern, brand new and to me the best option one can choose.",5,2024,07,06
09,Perfect place in beautiful venue!,"Excellent hotel,
Very friendly and welcoming staff and manager, will definitely come back in the winter season.
Loved the design, food and neatness of the hotel. View on the mountains is marvellous too.
Walking distance from shops and restaurants, excellent parking facilities.",5,2024,06,16
09,My stay at The Grand Hotel in Courmayeur,"Recently I went to The Grand Hotel in Courmayeur. It was pretty good for a 5 star hotel and I would keep it that way but some of the staff were slightly rude (but some were very kind).
Let’s start with a bit of the positives like the spa. The spa was amazing! There is a big swimming pool but it isn’t cold it is a hot swimming pool. Also there is an Experience Shower behind the pool and sauna aswell. There is a good gym but very cramped.
The room that I stayed in was a beautiful two story room with two beds ,one upstairs and one downstairs. It had a spacious bathroom with a big bathtub in the corner.
Moving on to the food! The breakfast was very nice except there was no toaster so I could not have my usual toast for breakfast. I didn’t have lunch here since I went skiing up in the mountains, but dinner was nice and peaceful. My family and I got served really quickly as not many people were there.
Let’s move onto some of the negatives. The two men that drove us to the ski lift and to a restaurant were really rude and complaining to the hotel about why they had to drive us. As far as I am aware of, if you speak English not Italian you are going to have a tough time as they can’t speak a good amount of English. Also the shuttle is really slow to pick you up.
The ski lift is not far away from the hotel. It is a 5 minute drive away and a 15 minute walk away from it. Lots of nice places in Courmayeur but I would not recommend this place to English people as they cannot understand you very well.",5,2024,02,24
09,Disrespectful Manager could make the trip really memorable,"We paid over 300 dollar/night for a room but we were given a room which had a view of someone's backyard and a playground. The room also had no AC.  The room was hot and humid. The room was also noisy as children were playing all the time next door. Being orbitz platinum we requested a room upgrade or same room with a nicer view. The front desk staff were really nice and wanted to do the upgrade as there were availabilities. Next morning during the breakfast time we also noticed the whole breakfast area was empty. The manager refused the room change without any logic or reason. Certainly the person has issues or has no respect for clients. The hotel group should be aware of this type of managers who brings no good to the business. I have been traveling to italy for last 16 years, and this is the worst hotel management I have ever seen. The manager was so disrespectful, even refused to talk to us personally. The room was so awful and experience was so bad that we decided to leave the hotel and accept the loss before actual check out date.  Also, just want to let the audience know that Mont Blanc tunnel always has issues, and it takes 55 euro to cross the tunnel. Please plan accordingly if you plan to visit french side. Thanks to all excellent staff of the hotel except the manager.",1,2023,09,13
09,disappointed ,"Recently attend a company weekend to which I can only express dissatisfaction with this hotel for creating a memorable experience for everything but a good experience. From rooms with not coffee machine, lacking water pressure in the showers and neighboring rooms being able to hear your every discussion with your partner to broken locks on common toilets. Breakfast lacked enthusiasm with no freshly baked breads and sausages steamed so long that they were good enough to be left on the plate. We hoped for a great dinner with a set menu where meals had to be selected a day before. Unfortunately the dining staff failed the hotel with confusion from the start, this resulted in worst possible experience Courmayeur could offer. For the vegetarians out there... you have fish and potato rosti with ham... mmm??? cannot fault the massage but unfortunately could hear every weight being lifted or splash in the pool... if you are looking for a 5 star experience - LOOK ELSWHERE... if you want to experience 3 star (or at best a 4 star) and pay the prices of a 5 star... then go try. For us, this is the last time ever to visit the Grand Hotel Courmayeur.",3,2023,03,13
09,Excellent stay at Grand Hotel Courmayeur.,"We have just had a fabulous stay at the Grand Hotel. The food, the staff, the hospitality and our shuttle driver were all 5* . Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were beautiful and clean and towels were changed daily. Could not fault it and endeavour to return. Thank you to all 🥰",5,2023,02,28
09,5 stars on paper - not value for big money,"This hotel is nice at first sight, but during the stay you will see that there a lot of things broken like lamps, ski storage room was out of order, sauna/spa needs renovation, toalett doors broken. When you ask something at reception, sounds like nothing is arrangeable. 
Stay here costed 650 eur/night and compared to other 5 star hotel (like W in Verbier) this is far far lower level. 
When asking something at reception, the receptionist goes always to boss room asking (I never saw this boss) and answer to everything is always no - or yes but this thos extra cost (well…. See the price of stay 650 eur/night). 
If you’re looking for a posh hotel, this is not. Go elsewhere.",2,2023,02,28
09,Very enjoyable experience. Truly 5 star care.,"Good sized rooms. Well provided. Sensible bathroom. Comfortable bed. Very attentive & helpful employees. Only small downside was under whelming breakfast.  Location is a short way out of the centre, but local transfers are quickly available. Dog friendly. 
Covered valet parking.",5,2023,02,10
09,Not even close…,"Our family stayed in a suite for a week and were out of hot water everyday, NO explanation and NO compensation offered. Paid 450 Euro pp for new years eve gala dinner which included wine for adults but only water for kids….Allergies not noted. The food was average

Asked for a compensation but was told the manager would contact me, he never did

The staff at breakfast was unfriendly and very slow. All in all not even close to the service level to be expected from a five star hotel. So not worth the prices charged. There are definitely better options in Courmayeur",1,2023,02,10
09,Meh- much better options available than this - from a Marriott Ambassador,"Tough to say this is a good hotel. It’s adequate- but don’t spend anything extra to stay here. I’m Marriott Ambassador and Hilton Diamond and Hyatt highest level. So I stay in hotels a lot. This hotel to me is labeled as a high end hotel but 2star at best service and facilities. You may want to reconsider your choice of staying here - I’m here now and definitely feel I should have stayed elsewhere. Believe it or not - staff is actually amazing! Bar tenders on 2nd floor are beyond competent and great. But that where it ends. I got USED toiletries from the prior guest - shame on you! - and my room wasn’t clean - previous guest’s long hair everywhere. It was obvious they hadn’t cleaned the room - maybe they swept it (if that!) I asked for new toiletries and the front deck woman who was super nice and pleasant just didn’t get me. 

Overall - overrated for the price, better options if you want good clean rooms! I had to clean my room with Clorox wipes - tells you everything you need to know",2,2022,12,23
09,11 year anniversary,"I just arrived home and was excited to write this review. This hotel is truly special . The price is very good , the staff were excellent ,super friendly and knowledgeable and I didn’t even get to the accommodations yet . The hotel is filled with beautiful antiques , top level fashion and a gorgeous pool, spa , heated outdoor pool, sauna Etc I’m missing being there already .

I am a very busy man and had only 48hrs to enjoy my 11th year anniversary with my wife and being there made us feel as though we were there for 5 days . I highly recommend and will be back very very soon .",5,2022,12,04
09,"Sad, tired, dingy hotel with incredibly rude staff","We arrived in Courmayeur, and we were enchanted by our surroundings. The mountain vistas are breathtakingly beautiful.  Then we got to our hotel. It was well placed, and in it's heyday it must have been a beautiful hotel. Now it's a crumbling old relic, managed by a grumpy cadre of staff. The woman at the reception was dismissive, unhelpful and rude.  Missing bulbs, dusty bedcovers, banged up floors, shutters and windows that don't lock properly from wear and tear. It's a mess! Breakfast was a disaster. It was extremely basic and sad.",1,2022,08,01
09,Great friendly service and spacious modern rooms,"Stayed here as a group and all our needs were met.  Reception staff were efficient, helpful and friendly.  Rooms are spacious modern and very clean.  Breakfasts are fantastic with so much choice and staff always on hand for anything you needed.   The hotel is a short walk from the centre and therefore away from the hustle and bustle.    A wonderful team of staff throughout the hotel.   We had a great stay.   Thank you so much.",5,2022,02,03
09,Excellent Service and Staff and Super flexible management given recent restrictions,"I cannot praise this hotel for making the impossible possible given the uncertainty we have all suffered with the recent and continuing changing regulations on travel and entry requirements. The hotel were prepared to give us maximum flexility for a very large booking coming from different destinations, each with different government advice . Had this not been the case, we would have had to cancel our reservation 2 months before. As a result we all confirmed and had the most fantastic 7 days at this hotel. Thank you .",5,2022,02,01
09,A total failure of service and basic facilities......THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL!!!!!!!,"Before I get started, I have to say that I have reviewed many hotels and restaurants all over the world and I have never stayed anywhere where the level of service and basic facilities was as disappointing and frankly, misleading. We are contacting the Italian Tourist Board to try to ascertain their justification for awarding this place with the rating it professes to have. Booked as a last ditch attempt to get away for a ski holiday when our plans to ski in France were ended by the new French restrictions. How I wish the french had never done that....
In all fairness, we should have smelt a massive rat when they had availability and virtually every other place in Courmayeur was full but we were desperate to get away and we've all been there haven't we? Reservations (Alex) very keen to please and found us a suite for 3 people. Curiously, he said there were no doubles left so we were curious (but really happy) when our friends managed to book 3 doubles the next day....hmmmmm
The building itself is great, overlooking the top end of the village and has great views out over the mountains. We checked in and the alarm bells instantly started jangling. The decor gives off a bland, international, anodyne vibe, acres of white corridors, out of place cheap artwork, dotted with glass cabinetry showcasing primary coloured fur jackets. The rooms have a curious 'that will do' air to them, decorated in a bare, 'not quite finished' style with little or no consideration to comfort or style. Phots all show the beds with a pleasant enough patterned wool blanket draped over them. This blanket is the only concession to any form of decor in the rooms. Bear in mind here we are commenting on the basis that their prices are stratospheric and they claim to be a 5 star hotel.....) The TV's don't work (we were told this was 'because of the weather), there is no bottled water in the rooms (despite asking virtually daily we received nothing except what was in the mini bar which was never replenished - in the end we gave up and went to the village to buy it) Brown water came out of the taps, the hot water ran out on a couple of nights, the heating was permanently jammed on 24* and when we called to ask them to come and see to it, we were told to 'open the windows' - which we couldn't as we were on the ground floor and the windows in question were french doors. No proper storage bar one hanging rail and the 'bed' for our daughter was a pull down sofa which she still has backache from sleeping on - the metal parts stuck out everywhere and the mattress was so thin you could fold it up. Nowhere to hang wet ski clothes. Reception was utterly contemptuous. From checking in to the moment we left, not one single person cracked a smile, asked us if our stay was going well or tried to assist with anything. We were permanently treated as if we had inconvenienced them, a particular low point was asking if the concierge (there actually isn't one) could assist us with some restaurant bookings, the girl in question threw us an incredulous look and told us to 'do it ourselves', they wanted deposits for umbrellas when it was pouring, the ski lockers (?!), which, incidentally we didn't get back, there was no information in the room on anything including room service so we were told 'go to the bar then and order it there'..... and so it went on. Catering was a hoot, the breakfast service was like a scene from a Carry On film, possibly called Carry On Chaos.... we had to ask several times each morning for hot drinks, short order food etc. No one had a clue what was going on, the food was extremely average. Fruit mostly tinned, pastries tired, one morning I asked for 2 boiled eggs and was served 9 eggs, 5 in a bowl from the buffet by someone who looked like she wanted to fling them at me, then another 4 in 2 lots from the clearly under siege kitchen. The bar has the atmosphere of a dentists waiting room and getting a drink was torture, it took at best about 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge you were waiting. Didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment but it was empty most evenings. Room service food on New Years Day was off the charts awful, incorrect, cold and frankly, disgraceful. When we checked out, my husband drew a line through all the charges for food, mini bar water etc  and paid only the bar bill and they didn't flinch - that, my friends, is how used to it the staff are. The shuttle service was ok but again, manned by a chap whose manner and attitude was one of utter contempt. There is a strange chap who hangs around reception, clearly part of the show but not dressed in a hotel uniform who drives one of the vehicles etc and one morning, my friend and I were waiting to get a lift to the main lifts and started chatting to him. We'd been waiting about 20 minutes and a couple walked out of reception and headed into his van and when we asked if he was taking us as well, he refused and said 'these are my clients' With that, the main van driver pitched up and an exchange took place between the two of them which clearly went a bit like this 'You have to take these two to the lifts' 'No chance get lost, I'm not doing it , you do it', at which point the first van sped off with the 'clients' inside it and the other driver disappeared inside (coffee anyone?) - we went to reception after about 10 minutes and made our feelings felt and he appeared, was a lot politer and even carried our skiis!!!! But hey, what a massive effort, and all, remember, in a 5 STAR HOTEL......
There is a small spa and it was full on the afternoons I went of young couples snogging in the pool - yeuchhh.
No idea what Mythos Group think they are doing here but if you check the reviews they get very poor from a couple of years ago onwards. The place is being run not for the guests but with a very keen eye on the bottom line and there is clearly no or very poor training given to the staff plus there is a fundamental breakdown of management. Plus they all clearly hate their jobs so someone somewhere is doing something very wrong. Spend your money on the Massif or one of the really nice looking 3 and 4 star places, but please do not stay here, we honestly felt like we'd been mugged when we left. None of this review is malicious in any way, just the plain truth and motivated by a feeling of utter injustice at a place that markets itself as something it isn't and gives not one jot of the way it abuses its guests with its lack of service. Pure theft.",1,2022,01,11
09,Adrian Collins,"Stayed at the hotel over new year 2021/2022 - just got back. We had booked for France but then the french banned UK tourists. We already had flights to Geneva so looked for alternatives and found availability here. There were 5 in my family and we booked 3 rooms at an eye-watering cost for 7 nights - 3 rooms cost us €16,000. Because of the pandemic we hadn’t been away for 2 years so decided to splash out for a xmas ski trip. Despite it being billed as a 5-star hotel the service was way below that standard and what we’ve experienced in other 5 star hotels. 
The room service was truly awful and the quality of the food delivered ghastly. 
There were no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms, no complimentary water - you had to buy it via the mini bar, not even an iron and ironing board (you had to use the laundry service if you wanted to press a shirt before dinner). 
Rooms felt unfinished - nowhere to hang coats, the wet room flooded because the floor tiles didn’t drain properly, we had to pay a deposit to use the ski lockers!! We didn’t eat dinner in the restaurant as we’d booked local restaurants most evenings so only had breakfast. It was ok but certainly not 5 star quality. The service was shockingly poor. Sometimes had to order coffee/tea several times before it was delivered and the same for the a la carte breakfast menu. 
The bar on the 1st floor was badly staffed and on two occasions we gave up waiting for the bar staff to make an appearance. 
No concierge service! Staff generally unfriendly. 
This felt very much like an amateur operation where customer service was pretty low down the list of priorities. 
Would definitely never stay at the Grand again and the Mythos group of hotels of which this forms part I’d avoid like the plague. 
Our of the whole week, met only one well trained member of staff, Matteo, the waiter who was delightful.",2,2022,01,03
09,Fabulous wedding weekend,"We decided to have our wedding (ceremony and party) at Grandhotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc and I confirm we could not have chosen a better place. Everything was simply perfect!
Even in Covid times, we were supported and helped in each step of the preparation, we woundn't have managed without Alessandro, super thanks!  
Then the day of arrived and everything was exactly the way we were dreaming about!
The venue was stunning, the food amazing, the people super nice and helpful.
All all our guests fell in love with the place and had a great time!
Some of us stayed at the hotel for some extra days and the rooms were splendid: spacious, clean and with modern decoration.
Thank you all for making our day special!",5,2021,08,18
09,Very nice hotel with modern design,"Instayed one night in late July. Great experience. Personnel is very nice at reception and at the bar. 
For a mountain hotel the modern design is quite impressive and even the Spa is great. 
We had lunch at the hotel not this time but another time and the food qas really high quality.
",4,2020,10,26
09," Not a good experience ","Poor room, we didn’t get a suite but we paid 990€ for one WE. It has a very limited cupboard: small and long like tunnel, you hardly reach the hangers at the back. Not one single wall hanger or shelf in the room (just two hangers in the bathroom for the bathrobes). Where are you supposed to hang your ski clothes and place your ski stuff? Basic decoration and furniture. Quite uncomfortable as you to leave your luggage in the floor at the long entrance because the room just has one small bench  for one trolley and one small chair which you have to use to put all your ski clothes as they do not fit in the cupboard (specially if you have non skiing coats). Very nice staff and willing to help but this does not compensate the lack of comfort. In addition, there was a big company event: very young people not behaving at the spa (drinking cognac in the steam bath, laughing very laud and making fun at the sauna..., zero relax). At night laughters and lack of silence. Maybe we are used to a higher quality for a 5 star hotel. ",2,2020,02,09
09,Just perfect ,"This is a really nice hotel nicely located in Courmayeur. Very attentive staff everywhere, in the front desk, cleaning, breakfast, spa and transport. We really enjoyed our stay here, and especially the transport service to the ski areas, city center etc. Very clean and well equipped rooms. Good selection for breakfast including freshly squeezed orange juice and very tasteful coffee. Looking forward to coming back next year.",5,2020,01,28
09,Very Disappointed,"Please note prior to reading this, my views are expressed on the understanding this is a 5 star hotel and am only comparing to the various other 5 star hotels I have stayed in over the years.

Duration: So, we were travelling as a family of 4 and our nanny for a week over what was initially planned to be after Christmas until after New Years Eve 2020.

Arrival: Upon arrival at the hotel, there was no-one for the suitcases, until I went inside and ask for assistance. Eventually the bell-hop came out and took the cases, I then proceeded to go into what appeared a cold hotel, with very interesting tacky-looking decor, in what does actually appear to be modern hotel, just whomever did the interior needs very serious advice. I then proceeded to the reception desk, where I was greeted by a gentleman that had been dealing with my booking, in fairness he tried to be helpful and polite, but the general mood of him and his staff next to him, was miserable. My wife, a few steps behind me on her way in, said hello, but there was no response. Even then it is not her responsibility to initiate a greeting upon entry to a hotel, it should be the other way around. Moving on.... Eventually we got our room keys, I had also requested keys for the ski locker and to my amazement I was asked to pay a deposit for the keys, as although the lockers are in the hotel, they are not owned by the hotel. For a 5 star hotel, they sure don't trust their guests. 1/5

Room: On the face of it the rooms are very nice, well designed and proportioned, spacious, clean, we had a great view of the mountains. Well stocked minibar and nice toiletries. My wife wasn't too happy about the lack of a shower-screen, but this was due to it being a wet shower and in the end wasn't too much of an issue as our bathroom was spacious. The toilet however was out in the open in the bathroom, with just a glass screen separating it and an inadequate extraction system. 4/5

Spa & Pool Facilities: Unfortunately, due to our stay being cut short, we didn't get to experience any of the Spa or Pool facilities, although they do have a cut off period for kids in the pool during the winter season, inconveniently right about the time the kids would usually use the pool between 4pm to 6pm. -/5

Shuttle Service: DO Not bother with this facility, if you make the mistake of booking at this hotel, ensure you get the number of the local taxi company. You might pay, but at leats you won't wait around in the freezing cold for no-one to turn up. Very very disorganised, and they tell fibs that the car is on its way, when clearly i's not. You have been warned. 1/5

Restaurant & Room Service: The breakfast was nice, staff were relatively miserable again, but somewhat attentive. The only fresh juice is orange juice, understandable, but maybe the grapefruit could have been fresh too? The pastries were nice, but I doubt they were made in their kitchen. Lunch in the hotel is acceptable although the menu is somewhat limited, primarily pasta and baguettes with the odd salad thrown in. Printed in-house and laminated, classy. Beware of the hairs, twice hairs were found in our meal, which thankfully were quickly replaced for the non-hair option. Please also note, dogs are permitted in the eating areas, so don't be surprised when you see them sitting on the chairs or moping around on the floor. The view of the mountains is nice however. On the last night we had dinner in their restaurant upstairs, La Forchette, i think it was called. So we arrived, and i requested a table for 4, i was told that as we did not have a reservation, that they could not seat us, I threw a little huff and puff and eventually got to choose which table we wanted, in all fairness that gentleman that was on the receiving end of my huff and puff was very likeable and I could see he tried to help. In fact when I asked for a glass of champagne, he offered me a bottle to make up for all the other issues we had encountered. Unfortunately, they continued into the meal. Firstly, my wife potatoes were frozen inside, and the meat was red-bloody-raw when it was supposed to be very well-done. Whilst she had her main I had my starter, she was then having her tea whilst my kids were having their dessert, and my main still hadn't arrived. By the time it did, I noticed the chef has decided to prepare my meal differently from what hers was, the steak was cut differently and the potatoes too, additionally the steak was raw when i had requested well-done. Very strange. Anyway, we complained and quite correctly both steaks were removed from the bill. 1/5

Housekeeping: So basically the morning housekeeping and turn-down are a bit miss-mash, usually the morning was ok, but they don't really tidy the room, only make the beds and empty the bins. We had a mug of tea sat on the coffee table for 2 days without it being removed. Turn-down is also a bit strange, they have these grubby rugs and pillows they throw onto the bed when making them in the morning and then proceed to leave them on after turn-down. These things have probably never been washed and are also littered with hairs. Maybe dog hairs?? 2/5

Summary: I would definitely not stay here again under its current management, even for free. The staff on the whole look and act miserable, very rarely do you receive a smile. That should be standard in any hotel, let alone a 5 star. Additionally, what these people don't seem to understand, is whether the customer is right or wrong, he is always right and you have to act like it. We went for dinner twice to a competitor hotel Le Massif and WOW that hotel knew what a 5 star hotel is, maybe we felt it more due to all the misery. From the moment you enter there are people looking to help you, with a smile and knowledge, added to the fact they speak English. They knew service. On the bright side, we cut our trip short by 4 days, and were back home for New Years Eve, and we weren't charged. Yes, this hotel did ruin our holiday this year, but to be honest, I did read various reviews beforehand and the concerns I had did indeed come true. That is why I have posted this review, to allow you to not make the same mistake and decide if what I have written would affect you. PS To the management who will no doubt read this, please please please send you staff undercover to Le Massif to have a look at how a true 5 star should be run. Good Luck.

09,Not a real 5-Stars.,"The Grand was a bit underwhelming.. On the positive side, the location and the view were good, and importantly the general manager Alessandro was very attentive and responsive to customer needs. However this place has some work to do on several fronts. To start with, the bar area is minuscule and is juxtaposed to the breakfast area. A 5-star hotel needs to have a proper bar, like is the case with Golf Hôtel, which is further down in the village. Importantly the staff is very amateurish, not knowledgeable and lacks pro-active ness. For rates of €800/night one would expect much a more professional slate. Last but not least, the restaurant La Fourchette is very average in terms of cuisine and service whilst over-priced. ",3,2020,01,02
09,"Amazing hotel, 5 stars are not enough!","I stayed at this hotel for long weekend in a Junior Suite, offered as upgrade for free.
The hotel is beautiful, clean, amazing.
Staff is nice and service is impeccable from any point of view.
The spa is amazing and the breakfast is excellent.
Full luxury.
I recommend this hotel for couples and families, you can’t ask more.

09,Not 5 star hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 days  .The building is modern , but not nice . Since i arrived i felt  regret to had booked the hotel . Awful and cold lobby .
It's out of town , you have to walk at least 10 minutes freezing or wait for the complimentary shuttle ( after 6 pm , they change , for the shuttle ) . One day we requested the shuttle to pick us up after the sky , and they forgot . We waited for more than 30 min and had to call the hotel . Nobody was coming , they forgot our request .Find a taxi in this city is a nightmare , so you need the shuttle .We booked a suite for 800 euros , very simple and the view not special , not really comfortable . The front desk staff is Concierge as well , for sure doesn't work . So you have to find everything by yourself .The night in this hotel is depressing , you have to walk to the city . The bar and restaurant are not  Better go to the town .The spa and fitness , ok . My friend stayed at the Golf hotel , hundred times better , located in the main street , with a nice garden with heaters during the happy hour , nice restaurant . The service is 3 stars hotel as well . The hotel manager must have to go to Cristallo Hotel in Cortina D Ampezzo , to know what means a 5 star property and service .Stay in another hotel .There are many at the city center , less expensive and better for sure .",3,2019,07,14
09,I think this hotel is a sampling of what paradise looks like,"My wife and I booked this hotel just by chance and did not hesitate extending our stay.  Having traveled to more than 50 countries and hundreds of hotels, this hotel rates as the number One.  Everything has been perfect, the reception, fulfillment of special wishes (they only practice “yes”), the breakfast, the hotel upkeep, the rooms, the views (absolutely magnificent).  
All staff members have been Great.  Our experience with Marina Coco (I think she is part of the management) and Azeri Loris at reception in the evening were simply perfect.  Congratulations on the training program they undertake.
A Wonderful experience and one we will come back to very soon.",5,2019,07,09
09,Service-minded staff who ensures a good experience,"The hotel is bestowed with a service-minded staff, who ensures a great atmosphere and are always ready to give guests a good experience. The hotel itself is an architectural beauty, with a beautiful lobby bar on the first floor, which has a stunning view of the Mont Blanc. There is an even more beautiful restaurant on the second floor that serves delicious food with a fine selection of regional wines, which you cannot miss. The rooms have unique designs, and they are clean as a whistle. Special thanks' to Marina and co. for ensuring me a wonderful stay, and really making me feel at home in my solitude. I would come back to Courmayeur only to stay at this wonderful hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2019,04,08
09,Nice hotel but not 5*,"Stayed here for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago.  My first impression was that the hotel was nice and modern.  It is a little out of town however, so a walk to any restaurants & bars.  The hotel do operate a complimentary and regular bus shuttle which takes you to both sets of cable cars up to the top of the mountain which i found very efficient.  I called the hotel one day on my way back down the mountain and they were there ready to collect me!
Our room was perfectly comfortable with a nice balcony and plenty of storage (i hate having to leave a suitcase on display and the wardrobe was deep enough for this).  We did have trouble keeping the shower hot enough though and from speaking to friends also in the hotel they too had the same problem.  Housekeeping was perhaps not quite as good as what I would expect from a 5 * but for a 2 day stay I could live with it.  I will say though that suprisingly over the 3 days we were there, at no point were there any hand towels in the restaurant toilets! 
Breakfast had plenty of selection but i don't think it was anything special.  Fruit had gone brown and the food in general not great, fruit juices and bottled water both mornings had run out.  We ate in the hotel on our first night (La Fourchette)  it was a set menu for our large group which was ok.
The spa is a really nice feature of the hotel and worth using after a days skiing.  The hotel was quite quiet when we were there so we had it pretty much to ourselves (i think normally they operate on a booking basis).
There is a ski shop onsite too if you have forgotten anything! All in all, a nice and pleasant stay but not quite sure it hits the 5* ranking.",4,2019,04,01
09,Stunning,Fabulous stay. Gorgeous hotel with super friendly and helpful staff. Close enough to walk down into the centre - about 10 mins but something of an incline on the way back. Good excuse for another Aperol! The courtesy bus was a godsend and all the drivers were so friendly. Food was delicious for breakfast and we also had an amazing dinner on the first night as the snow was coming down and we just wanted to stay indoors. Suffice to say it was fab. We had a pre dinner drink in the bar which was great - basically acted as a starter with all the accompaniments. The only thing I’d change was some tea/coffee making facilities in the room and a bath alongside the shower. Although the gorgeous pool/spa did the trick after skiing. Thoroughly recommend. ,5,2019,03,22
09,Superior,"We stayed three nights in mid March and were really happy about the hotel. We didn’t have any expectations but the place was really nice, clean and got us on a good mood.

We got upgraded to Junior Suite, which was extremely nice and big. Great views to the mountains. Room for clothes, big shower/toilet room. We slept well!

Beautiful American bar with cosy sofas and fireplace. A bit pricy drinks but it included tasty snacks and we went here every night before heading to dinner.

Spa area with saunas was amazing! Small pool, but really relaxing saunas after  a long day full of skiing.

Highly recommended!",5,2019,03,17
09,Update,"The hotel was kind enough to listen to my criticism and was nothing but kind for the rest of the stay. Thank you for the effort. They even found apples for the spa when someone had taken them all. Very nice pool and spa
",4,2019,02,22
09,Not a 5 star hotel when it comes to service,"This hotel has a very amateur management structure and it’s not 100% client focused as we would expect. Nothing to say about infrastructure but the management and the “rules” they pass to the guests are just stupid - example: don’t loose your keycard or you will be penalized in 10
Euros. This is just one of the stupid things that sum up and show that we are dealing with “low cost” mentality people (the managers or the owners). The vans to catch you at the ski station were very rarely on time and you would have to call to the hotel complaining so that they would send someone after a tough ski day. Also there was clearly less staff for the season as you could see the drivers (nice people) doing other works to cover the gaps and desperate to do everything they could -
This means bad planning.
Overall We got very disappointed since we were expecting an amazing service and we got a very low service low cost mentality in a great infrastructure. Keep the hotel, change the owners/managers urgently. They don’t know what great service is about",3,2019,02,17
09,Excellent Weekend birthday SKi trip,"This was a surprise trip for my wife’s birthday with some friends. We flew into Geneva and had a simple transfer followed by a quick and speedy checkin at the hotel.  It was extremely nice to get a room upgrade to a suite which was a great start to the holiday. The rooms are beautiful, modern and contemporary but they still make you feel like you are in a ski resort with warm wooden fittings. Being a short break we wanted a quick turnaround to get changed into our ski gear, get our hire gear and be on the slopes ASAP. The on-site ski hire did just that. It wasn’t open when we arrived, but it wasn’t a problem. Reception called Massimo and he was there in 15 minutes to get us ski ready. The on-site lockers are really handy with the locker room opening onto the on-site parking where the shuttle was waiting to take us. It is literally a 5 minute drive the to Dolonne bubble lift, which was quicker than some ski-in ski out resorts. After a days skiing we would find ourselves in the spa, relaxing in the pool, steam room and sauna - a great way to wind down.
In the evening we would go to the bar before heading out for dinner. Omar and Luca produced some amazing cocktails including one they made up on the spot which included my favourite ingredients. I think we agreed to call it a Luma in the end.
The breakfast buffet gives you everything you need before heading out onto the slopes.
I will definitely be coming back to this hotel and courmayeur. An absolute treasure.
",5,2019,02,03
09,Hotel of fairytales,"This is the kind of hotel of fairytales. Stunningly beautiful, contemporary but still warm and welcoming. Stylish with outstanding local charm.
This hotel has everything... A good location, an amazing bar with a very nice and professional Barman (Omar), large comfortable rooms, a spa, a ski hire shop and a private shuttle to the lifts. 
The room (suite) which includes a separate dressing room is very well organized and the spacious bathroom is amazing with a big circular bathtub.
The spa is wonderful, there are multiple shower experiences and an indoor pool with a button triggered waterfall. A spacious outdoor deck is located by the pool with numerous loungers for sunning oneself.
The breakfast was excellent with everything you need.
Definitely 5* service",5,2019,01,30
09,Not really 5 Star - very noisy.,"Don’t be deceived by the photos. This is a hotel designed to be instagrammed, but it is soulless and certainly not a Five Star Hotel. Had it not been for the extremely helpful staff who tried really hard to provide great service and sort out the problems, I would have rated it only two stars. 

The main problem is the rooms. The walls are extremely thin and noise travels so easily. I could hear the TV and the conversations of the people in the rooms either side. The floors are hardwood and therefore you hear every footstep from the room above. Clearly this is a design fault, and the management did their best to solve the problem but if you are there when it is busy or with lots of noisy families, it could be a nightmare.

I would also say that breakfast is very ordinary in terms of choice of food - few cereals and fresh fruit and things like eggs, omelettes etc are an extra charge.

The spa is good, but they don’t seem to bother keeping it tidy so it looks a complete mess with towels strewn all around and the bin piled high with plastic cups.

There are better hotels in Courmayeur and it is very expensive for what it is. The staff however are excellent and extremely helpful.",3,2019,01,08
09,"Beautiful hotel, modern luxury.","We received an upgrade. The room is beautifully decorated with a balcony and stunning views on the mountains. The service is amazing, there is a free shuttle at your disposal, it can take you to anywhere in Courmayeur. We used it to get to the Skyway (must see), and called the hotel when we finished and they sent the shuttle to us (arrived in 5 minutes) and he took us to the center. Then again picked us up back to the hotel! AMAZING SERVICE. 

The food is also very good, we tried dinner (very good) and the american bar (we had a snack). Also, breakfast is good with nice views. All staff are attentive and friendly. 

Spa area is nice as well. We used the indoor pool and sauna.

09,Great spot,"In the beginning of the summer season we visited this great hotel. It is a very nice modern 5 star hotel, but still in the local mountain style. We had a junior suite, this is an amazing room. The dressing room is great and spacious. Bathroom is very luxureous with a big bath. The manager was very friendly and service oriented. Restaurant has a great view at the mont blanc.  We really enjoyed our stay and i would recommend it to everyone who wants a great experience in the mountains.",5,2018,08,25
09,Nice hotel,"Pretty, nice clean hotel. Comfortable beds. Good breakfast. Nice views. Good parking.It is a little bit out of town but not inconvenient. We were driving to France after an overnight flight from the US so this was a perfect stopover for us for a couple of nights to recover. Relaxing and lots of fun.",5,2018,08,20
09,A great stopover,"Driving from Italy to France through the Mont Blanc tunnel (or the other way around) requires some planning especially during the holiday periods when getting through the tunnel can entail a frustrating 2 hour wait.  So check the tunnel website and chose your time and day carefully.
You will note that there is  never a wait before 10  AM. So why not break the journey in Courmayeur and spend the night there. You will find that the Grand Hotel has a heated pool and an outstanding restaurant. Not cheap but you get what you pay for.",5,2018,08,20
09,Summer in the mountains,This 5 star boutique hotel was beyond expectations. Eating while looking at the snow capped Mont Blanc in the summer is just breathtaking. The staff was friendly and helpful when needed. The hotel is right on the border so you can go to France and even Switzerland for day trips. We've stayed at the hotel twicew and would go again.,5,2018,08,13
09,Outstanding Treasure of a Hotel,"I stayed with my family at the Grand Hotel in Courmayeur, Italy in August 2018. We had a magnificent time.  And it all started with an outstanding staff.  They were very warm, responsive and accommodating.  They went waaayy our of their way to make us feel comfortable.  One employee, Riyadh, actually brought dinner (unsolicited) to our room when my six year old was too tired to join us for dinner. 

The hotel is warm, the rooms very comfortable.  They have a great spa and pool.  And the views are breathtaking.  That is not an exaggeration.  The hotel is at the foot of Mont Blanc and the vista is out of this world.  The location was perfect - a mere 30 minutes to incredibly beautiful Chamonix (in France) and Aosta (in Italy).

I highly HIGHLY recommend the Grand Hotel.  They truly made our vacation memorable.

A pic from our room balcony is below.",5,2018,08,07
09,"Good hotel, nice location","I stayed one night at the Grand Hotel Courmayeur on a business trip. The location is great, just a short drive away from Geneva.

09,Great Hotel for organizing your incentive,"For our yearly End of Year Offsite we booked all rooms in the Grand Hotel Courmayeur. 

The hotel staff was friendly and professional, they made sure it was a visit to remember for everybody. Special thanks to kitchen and service brigade; they pulled it off to serve a great diner and lunch for the entire group (exceeded their normal capacity by 40 people). The hotel manager very attentive and has a good eye for details when organizing an event for 200 people.",5,2018,03,30
09,Not a five star hotel,"Stayed here for two days last week on business. The hotel is lovely and in a great location with incredible surrounding views of the mountains. 

We arrived and there were still people in our room. I know this because we were given the key card and we walked in on two people in bed watching tv! Had to wait two hours whilst they were kicked out and eventually they gave us a different room. 

The rooms were nice - laid out well with a big TV, great bathroom and again good views. 

Downsides, the hallways are shabby and in need of refurbishment. The food was bang average - breakfast was not nice. The hot breakfast is basically tiny sausages and scrambled egg. We ate as soon as it opened thinking it would be hot and fresh and tasty but it really wasn't good. 

Staff were friendly though, but bar staff very very slow indeed. Shuttle buses around Courmayeur are free and useful although most things are walkable. ",4,2018,03,28
09,Perfect venue for a long ski weekend,"Left London at 4am and we were on the slopes at 11am Italian time, having arrived at 10.15 at the hotel and been delighted to find our hotel room was ready.  The hotel shuttle to and from the gondolas was available immediately and proved a good service over four days. We walked back to the hotel once instead of waiting - only 15 minutes. Tip - hire and leave skis and boots overnight up at the top of the gondolas at Plan Checrouit - fantastic service in the family run ski hire place at the top of the lift.

Hotel staff - very professional, helpful and friendly.

Hotel room (we had junior suite but were upgraded) was extremely comfortable, extremely clean, well equipped.  Hotel spa was good quality - either empty or, over the weekend, full to capacity - they ask guests to reserve slots to regulate the numbers; it's free tor guests to use the pool, sauna, steam room.  Piano bar was lovely for apres ski drinks, pre spa.  Couldn't understand why it wasn't busier - drinks sensibly priced for high end hotel bar. 

Food - breakfast offered the usual extensive fresh range for a five star hotel, but we were surprised to have to pay extra for eggs, smoothies etc off the menu.  Had dinner in the hotel the first night - food delicious and the service good.  Front desk (Federica and Enrico in particular very helpful) recommended and booked good restaurants for us.  We came armed with food and bar suggestions from friends, but wouldn't have found Dandelion Cuisine de Montagne without Federica's suggestion. What a fantastic meal!  

Will definitely return to Courmayeur and look forward to staying in this hotel again.",5,2018,02,18
09,I must have left a piece of my heart back at Grand Hotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc,"We booked a junior suite and when we arrived at the reception they offered me a free upgrade in Suite! This was amazing!!! We are regular 5-star hotel guests and this hotel has a special appeal.
From the moment we arrived the staff was so wonderful, very friendly and always available. Everybody, especially the reception, went out of their way to help us and they were very efficient and keen in their duties.
We spent only three days and tried the restaurant just once, but overall the menu was good but the wine list a little bit poor for a 5-star hotel. The breakfasts were very good but we did not understand why we had to pay extra for eggs: breakfast is breakfast! 
Although some little details could improve, this was one of my best experience for a ski holiday. We warmly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2018,02,18
09,"Nice Hotel, lovely Spa but beware additional charges at breakfast","Firstly, lets concentrate on the positives.  This is a very nice hotel, located a 10 minute walk from the centre of the town.  Rooms are clean & contemporary & the Spa is excellent, although you can only use it for 90 minutes a day & it must be booked.  That said, it was empty when we went in & 90 minutes was more than enough.  The Hotel has a great ski locker room for your boots & ski.  There is a small ski rental shop in the hotel but we didn't use it to rent ski's so cannot comment.  The Hotel runs a regular shuttle bus to the ski lifts, very good service...this can be used to drop you in the town too....but the walk is quite nice so not really necessary.  always be sure to call the shuttle when you are at the top of the lift, to be sure you diont have to wait too long at the bottom.  

In terms of breakfast, be aware that even though you may be on a B&B basis, items cooked by the chef ( such as eggs & omlettes) are not included.  This was not explained to us at any point during our stay & was disappointing to receive an additional bill at check out.  Thankfully the Hotel did remove these charges after some discussion.  It is fair to say the Hotel is very nice but also very quiet & is not one for having any apres or relaxing drinks, as the bar area is very small.  That said we found Courmayeur as a resort is quite quiet & if you require lively bars, or somewhere with atmosphere, it may be worth considering somewhere else",4,2018,01,23
09,"Good, but not great.","My family and I (two adults and two teenage girls) stayed at the Grand Hotel Courmayeur during a ski trip in December 2017. 

The hotel has a very nice modern décor, with wood accents in the rooms. My wife and I stayed in one room, and my teenage daughters in another. The rooms are very nice and modern, but not particularly large. One of the rooms was on one side of the hotel and the other on the other side, and both had very nice views of the surrounding mountains.

The service was generally very nice, particularly at the front desk. The restaurant looks very nice as well, and the service is fairly good, but the food itself frankly leaves much to be desired. One reason we love travelling to Italy is because of the food, and we found the food at the Grand mediocre and expensive (except breakfast, which was pretty good, but how can it not be with the excellent hams and cheeses to be found in Italy). There are much better dinning options in town.

The hotel's locations is fine, but not great. It's not in the town center, but not far from it, about an 8-10 min walk. However, it is not really close to the ski lifts, so you will have to use the shuttle. However, they only have a mini van that fits eight, which means long waits (once we waited 45 min) at the end of the ski day when you want to catch a lift back to the hotel. Every other guest we spoke to was similarly displeased with this. The hotel does have a good ski locker room. You can also rent skis at the hotel, but the staff in charge of this was not all that easy for us to find. Returning the skis, however, was a breeze: you just leave them in your locker. 

The hotel has a small, free, outdoor parking, in case you rent a car, but if you want covered garage you'll have to shell out 40 EUR per night. 

Lastly, the spa: For us, a key part of après-ski involves dipping our sore bodies in a nice hot tub, but in this hotel the spa did not have one. I'm not sure how anything can be called a spa without a hot tube, but there it is. Fortunately, the neighboring town of Pre-Saint-Didier has a very nice, if a bit crowded, spa with natural springs (QC Terme), and we went there once. This entailed a 15 min drive (fortunately we had a car), and a reservation. That was ok, but not the same as having a hot tub in the hotel you're staying at. 

Overall good, but not great.",4,2018,01,09
09,Fantastic hotel with excellent service ,"We arrived at Grand Hotel Courmayeur the first of January. As soon as we arrived we felt welcomed and well attended. My first impresión was that the hotel had a very nice interior design with a Scandinavian feel to it. Nothing fancy yet everything looked very well made.  The rooms are quite spacious yet very cozy. All rooms have balconies with great views. Breakfast was included and the service and food surpassed my expectations. All of the waiters, bar tenders gave us nothing but excellence. I applaud who ever is in charge of them. The location of the hotel is not in town which I like because of the peace and quite. To get to town it's only a 10/15 minute walk at the most. Shuttle service to get to the slopes is available on demand so you don't have to worry about transportation. Ski rentals are also available on site which is practical. The only thing I personally did not like was the Spa. In itself it's nice and service is good. What I personally didn't like was that the let  kids and even moms with babies inside the spa areas. I wanted peace/quite/relaxation and found myself in a summer public pool. Other than that I loved this hotel. I will return soon ! ",5,2018,01,08
09,Superb,"We spent a week at this wonderful hotel. I have only positive things to say about the hotel. It is a modern, well planned, comfortable and spacious hotel. The rooms are nice and very modern. The bathroom is very spacious. The internal pool and spa are very nice. Staff is very service oriented and friendly. Parking is also available.",5,2017,09,04
09,The Grand Hotel is GRAND!,"I've just returned this evening from a week at the Grand Hotel. It is a beautiful hotel in the middle of a small, absolutely breathtaking town, facing Mont Blanc. The place is immaculate, the food is plentiful (and that's an understatement) and delicious- too delicious!! The high quality and selection of fresh vegetables and fruits available on a daily basis were amazing.  The staff is indescribable- top notch+.. They are soft spoken, knowledgeable, helpful.. they are simply fantastic!  In short, I had a true vacation and came home refreshed and relaxed and ready to return to reality.. well, almost!  ",5,2017,08,31
09,"Fantastic hotel, fabulous staff","We just returned from 9 days in Courmayeur, we stayed in the Grand Hotel -it was absolutely wonderful. We would like to comment on the wonderful, exemplary staff. The entire staff was welcoming, pleasant and far more than competent.  The rooms were really  nice, the scenery (we had a porch) and dining room views are breathtaking.

I would like to single out Cecilia for her incredible service.  Our first day, indeed, right after check in, I lost the crown on one of hmy teeth.  This would have changed our plans and ruined our entire vacation. Cecilia called over ten dentists until she found one who could replace the crown on short notice, and arranged for a cab to take us there and back.  In all my years of travel, I have never seen such devotion.  She was unfailingly welcoming and kind.

My husband has run various social service programs and not for profit corporations. H has never seen such an excellent staff.  If we return to Italy, we will be sure to stay at one of your hotels.  In the mean time,  I will recommend your hotel to all of our friends and students.",5,2017,08,23
09,Great Summer Vacation Spot,"Awesome Hotel, Amazing views of the mountains from all windows, great location (20 minutes to France, 1 hour to Switzerland, 2 hours to Milan, etc.), VERY Helpful and Nice Staff (especially John/Gian the Hotel Manager and Cecilia at the desk), lots of activities around the hotel and beyond!!! Great Summer Vacation spot... must be even better in the winter.  If you go, ENJOY!!!",5,2017,08,23
09,Wonderful summer vacation and tour!!,"The hotel is beautiful, modern and clean! The staff were gracious and helpful, especially Christina and Sabina when we needed some personal help, (wish we would have remembered more names!) The scenic views are simply spectacular!!",5,2017,08,21
09,Idyllic Setting and Outstanding Service,"We just spent a week at the Grand Hotel Courmayeur.  The hotel is a very stylish hotel with large well appointed rooms. The front desk staff is extremely friendly and most helpful.  The restaurant staff is outstanding, eager to please and anticipated all our needs.",5,2017,08,21
09,"Excellent Service, Beyond Expectation","Courmayeur is a very picturesque Italian village at the foot of Mt. Blanc. A relatively
short ( 1.5 hour)  drive from Milan. The Grand Hotel is a very modern, very clean,and very welcoming five star hotel  Although the food and amenities are superb, the staff are the best part of the hotel. From Cristina at the Reception to the Manager, John
Sedda, and everyone in between, all go out of their way to be helpful. I, for example
had an issue with my laptop's WIFI reception. This was interfering with my ability to
enjoy my vacation, while still being in touch with my office. Cristina and John arranged for a modem rental and its delivery to be from Milan by taxi. This, of course, is in addition to their constant helpful hints as to local places of interest and available activities.",5,2017,08,13
09,Truly idyllic hotel and surroundings,"Superbly comfortable and highly welcoming hot. First class food, a superb spa and a delightful bar hosted by Luca. Close to proximity to town center and all outdoor amenities. This is a wonderful way to enjoy the Italian alps. ",5,2017,07,24
09,Absolutely amazing,"Sadly I just had the chance to stay there for one night... because I was on a business trip. But if I would stay in this region again I definetly would go there. The room was huge, bed was super-comfy. The view was just perfect! I could see the Mont Blanc from the balcony!!!!
Bathroom was really big, nice bathtub. 
Service was friendly and the food was good. 
",5,2017,07,13
09,Great hotel,"This is a modern hotel, very stylish with all the amenities you need. The room was very clean and spacious with a great walk in shower, a large balcony with spectacular views. The towels were refreshed of an evening if needed.  The reception staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive.  The pool and spa facilities are first class. We had a wonderful stay.",5,2017,06,23
09,In a league of its own,"This is the kind of hotel of fairytales. Stunningly beautiful, contemporary but still warm and welcoming. Stylish with outstanding local charm. The views of the mountains were unbelievable. Staff and service was good. One small issue at the spa was rectified quickly. The bedrooms were stunning and the backdrop out of the patio doors was breathtaking. All in all a fabulous holiday and a hotel that is five stars in every way.",5,2017,05,03
09,Everything You Need In One Place,"This hotel has everything... A good location, a comfortable bar, large comfortable rooms, a spa, a ski hire shop and a private shuttle to the lifts. Perfect.

I booked a Deluxe Double room which was spacious to say the least. The separate bedroom and living area was a bonus and the large modern bathroom with whirlpool bath was a relaxing way to prepare for the evening, after a good day of skiing.

The service is decent and friendly and there isn't even any need to pre-book your ski equipment. Way more convenient than hiring in town.

The Hotel Golf has the luxury sure, but the Grand Mont Blanc is the complete package.",5,2017,05,01
09,splendid!,"great hotel. extremely friendly and helpful staff. beautiful design and layout.....
lovely spa - food - service - views... all in all the best all rounded hotel I have stayed in for years! And we were kindly upgraded for our special occasion...thank you.",5,2017,04,25
09,Best hotel in area ,"Nice, clean modern hotel with good service. The food in the restaurants is delicious especially for dinner. The breakfast buffet is expansive and they keep it open almost a half hour later than stated for late sleepers. The workout room and spa rooms are small but adequate. We joined a group of several couples at the last minute and the hotel accommodated us with a regular room on the first floor. The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet and we had a patio w partial mountain views. The bathroom was quite large for European standards and new. We will return again next year if we are in the area.",4,2017,04,11
09,A reference in Courmayeur,"We regularly stay at this hotel. The modernity of the installations is a real plus. The room (junior suite) which includes a separate dressing room is very well organized and the spacious bathroom is amazing with a big circular bathtub. The staff is really friendly and helpful. The spa is quite big, complete and has a very pleasant atmosphere. The shuttle as well as the indoor parking are also appreciable services. Last but not least, the restaurant has very good and varied dishes.",5,2017,04,04
09,Not worth 5 stars and Actually overpriced,"Just spend a nice weekend in Courmayeur at the Grand Hotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc. And I'm disappointed to say it, but I will NOT recommend it to anyone and will not come back. 
First advantages: the design is really nice and it was actually the point why I chose this hotel. It is situated in the residential area, so outside is really relaxing and quiet. 
To have a great view I recommend the rooms overlooking Mont Blanc, paired numbers - 202, 204 etc. 
breakfast is ok, the basic level for a 4 star hotel with a nice view. 
The great disappointment is the spa - a small indoor swimming pool with 10 (!!!!!) relax beds. So immagine the high ski season when all the guests of the hotel come to relax in the spa at 5-6 p.m. 
Actually it's a very basic spa, nothing special. If you want a really great and luxury experience - just book the best spa hotel in the area QC Terme Hotel Monte Bianco in the nearest town. Or try Nira Montana in La Thuile. 
Hope the manager of the Hotel will realize that the 5 star service doesn't include only facilities (he cannot change the spa unfortunately). But he could add some pleasant compliments etc like do other luxuries mountain hotels - welcome drink, relaxing mask. Something that could make the stay not average but special. ",3,2017,04,01
09,Wonderful Contemporary Hotel,"We have just returned from a fabulous 4 nights in this lovely hotel. Every single one of the staff were all so courteous, welcoming and couldn't do enough to help. Definitely 5* service. We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe. Room C201 (4th floor) was very comfortable with huge bathroom. V peaceful overlooking mountains. (Requests: A bath! UK channels on TV without supplement. Tea/coffee making facilities in room. 24 hr Room Service (closed at 11pm).) The shuttle minibus service to Dolonne gondola was very efficient and flexible. (Tip: hire your skis up the mountain- makes life much easier!) Very easy max 10 mins walk into the centre (Via Roma) for shops, bars, restaurants. Breakfast was a delicious buffet. We only had to mention once that my daughter was gluten free. Every meal, the waitress automatically brought gluten free options. We even had a whole tray of GF snacks delivered to the room with no charge. Only ate dinner once in the hotel : good choice of local dishes, excellent quality, reasonable and exemplary service. We loved the spa- warm jacuzzi swimming pool, sauna, steam room (dressing gowns, flip flops, products, towels all readily available). Also free hot drinks, fruit, water in the spa to help yourself. We just didn't want to leave! Mille grazie- we will be back!",5,2017,03,23
09,Beautiful hotel close to downtown,"Nice relatively new hotel in Courmayeur; conveniently located near downtown but in a very quiet area and with beautiful views of the mountains. Modern fittings mostly glass gives lots of light to the inside. Might appear a bit 'cold' (lacks the cozy athmosphere of some mountain hotels) but all very clean and high quality. 
Dinner in the restaurant was very good quality and waiters very nice with us and the kids. 
Rooms very nicely furnished all very modern. 
Nice terrace to enjoy the sun. 
",4,2017,03,22
09,Long weekend skiing,"The building is great, modern and contemporary, rooms spacious and clean, and there is a great spa area and pool. Ideally located for walking into town to the many restaurants and shops, and there is a free shuttle bus to the ski lift.
The staff were super helpful in recommending and booking restaurants, but I would recommend checking your bill when checking out as both couples had charges for the bar which were made before we even arrived! I am positive that this was a genuine error and nothing untoward.
Drinks at the bar were costly, but so was everything else in Courmayeur so this isn't a reflection on the hotel.
The breakfast buffet was delicious, especially if you have a sweet tooth. There was a great variety to suit everyone though, and plenty of food and good coffee.
The only negatives were that it felt more like a business hotel than a ski resort accommodation; there wasn't much atmosphere. The staff, although very courteous and friendly, were slow in responding to requests, and it's not really necessary to bring a bottle of wine to the table on a trolley!
In summary, everything was fine, but some ambience missing!",4,2017,03,13
09,Ski vacation ,"Certainly not 5 star. 
Disjointed in layout 
Rooms small
Noisy 
The insulation between floors/ rooms a bit thin 
Spa ok 
Breakfast rubbish .
Reception helpful 
Ski service ok 
On the edge on the town so walking needed to go into town 
",3,2017,03,13
09,Nice hotel but not a 5* service,"The hotel is a very recent building with good design. Rooms and bathrooms are nice although standard doubles are small for a supposed 5*. The spa is pleasant, can get crowded in the afternoon. Location is good, car/shuttle is necessary to reach the lifts up to the slopes.

Staff is friendly but service is not exactly in line with price they charge: eg difficult to get anything to eat if arriving late, private car parking costs Eur30/night but you may be asked to go get the car by yourself, the shuttle to the lift should run at all times but we once had to wait for close to 1h before being picked up. Restaurant food is fine but would not say the best in Courmayeur, the breakfast choice is underwhelming for Italian standards.

Overall a nice and pleasant stay and good value if booked on discounted rate, but hardly worth the rack rate.",3,2017,02,25
09,Lovely hotel that doesn't quite deliver,"Beautiful hotel a short walk to the centre of town. We found out on their website about a great anniversary package, which resulted in us being upgraded to a beautiful junior suite. The room was fantastic with the biggest bath tub you've ever seen. 

The spa is good, but they need more beds to relax on around the pool.

Breakfast was good but I was very disappointed with the choice. I am gluten free and had phoned ahead to inform them - they said that was no problem - however, no gf bread appeared on the 3 mornings we were there even after speaking to the front desk twice about it.

Another frustration was the satellite TV wasn't working in our room, so we  couldn't watch any English speaking channels. The front desk blamed it on the weather (even on a fine day). We were not convinced given we are in a mountain resort + all the bars were able to show sport, etc, on their TVs.

The real let down for our party was the shuttle service from the hotel to the cable car that takes you up the mountain. There is one shuttle bus that seats 8 that they use to shuttle guests. There are many guests, so the queue is long and we waited 45 mins on the first day outside in sub-zero conditions so as not to lose our place in the queue. On the second day we had to split up our party of 6 to fit on the shuttle, which resulted in more wasted time. They really need 2 buses at peak times, or a bigger bus.

In summary: the hotel itself is very nice, but needs to work better on customer service to be worthy of their 5* rating and the price tag.",3,2017,02,08
09,Grand Hotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc,"With friends we spent in this hotel very nice autumn weekend. Accommodation and meals perfect. I can also recommend a very clean and modern spa - swimming pool and sauna, which offers lovely views of Mont Blanc.You can enjoy with ur familly and friends.",5,2017,01,23
09,"Good property, nice staff, poor food","The room was fine, nicely designed, could have used a little more closet space. Facilities excellent. The staff were always helpful and friendly, though some seemed inexperienced and stretched. The restaurant was poor, especially for a five star hotel. Most restaurants in Courmayeur were better, and food is not the priority in a ski resort. Parking charge is now 30 Euros a night..",3,2017,01,02
09,NOT A 5 STARS HOTEL,"I have visited Grand Hotel courmayeur for the new year's eve 2017. Stayed for 9 nights. The hotel is a definetly 3 stars one,  not a 5 one. The staff is mostly rude, not willingful to help. They do not have a decent lobby as a 5 stars hotel should have",3,2017,01,02
09,"Amazing new hotel, for skiing the rooms are small, not close to piste!","the beautiful  hotel is brand new, just openend. the rooms are nice but for skein maybe a bit small. id like to have a bit more space. the badroom is big enough! so thats a big plus. the breakfast is big and serves all sorts of food. in the hotel you can rent skies and change clothes, a mini van brings you to the ski lifts just 5/10 min fro the hotel. and picks you up again. if you want to be close to the skilifst this might not be your hotel.",5,2017,01,01
09,Great place and great location ,"Been here December 2016. Hotel is great, top class in terms of location, rooms clean and luxury as expected. 
Spa is not huge but very good, even if customer service is not as top as the place itself. 
Cortina city center is at walking distance. 
 ",4,2016,12,03
09,Very nice hotel ,"We really enjoyed our one week stay at the hotel.  It's not truly 5* but a very comfortable 4*.  Public areas are bright and modern with breathtaking views.  Top notch spa.  Our room was comfortable and had great views.  The only drawback is that there is no A/C and it was hot during our visit in late August.  If you open the balcony door there's beautiful cool mountain air but also noise from the street if you're facing the front.  So ask for a rear facing room.  We were part of a kosher group and the food and the service was excellent.  All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the front desk, so I'm puzzled by some of the negative comments.  It's true that the hotel is a little outside the center of town, but we viewed that as a plus, and it's a pleasant 10 minute walk to the center of Courmeyeur.  Parking is a a bit of a pain. You can either pay Euro 20 a night to park in their garage, or you can park on the street nearby - although spaces are limited.   ",4,2016,09,17
09,The worst 5*,"As a real client who has been in the hotel this weekend, I will classify this 5 star hotel as the worst 5 star I have been in, from the service to the infrastructure and maintenance.
I know the infrastructure is not the fault of the people who are present daily that execute the different services, but daily operations can make one forget the imperfection in the infrastructure.
Arrival at the hotel, no one to welcome you and help with the luggage, but mind you someone is busy talking on the phone outside whilst we wait, turn out it was the management staff who could not be bothered until he finished his phone call. 
Check in procedure, we are directed to public parking as parking infront of reception is full and mind you we had paid the parking beforehand. We are requested to pay 20euro should we want to use the underground parking. The reception did not know we had paid (they did not have the information). At arrival we learn that the restaurant are closed for the two nights for the profit of a private event, they could have been informed.
The room is big , enough space for the four of us....brand new and modern. However the bathroom is not ventilated at all thus smell of mould.
At night impossible to sleep as its hot, asked about the aircon, answer is there is none because it is a mountain hotel. So we slept with the balcony door open, thanks god the surrounding is quiet.
Friday night we wanted to go to the bar, waited, no bar man thus we ended up leaving.
Breakfast, simple with the necessities except for cream for coffee, they do not have cream for coffee.
Spa swimming pool is nice, we enjoy the swimming pool, though a bit surprised at the note on the door that  you cannot use the spa/swimming pool the day you check in and the day you are checking out. Why?
Twice in a row (Saturday night and Sunday morning) in the garage, the staff use the garage as smoking and break area. Seriously? So your guest have to walk next to your staff smoking in the garage, and your guest has to see your kitchen staff in the white uniform sitting down in the garage smoking? Unacceptable for a 4 star and let alone a 5*.
Courmayeur is a lovely area, very green, clean and beautiful. In great company we had a nice weekend and did not let these hiccups ruin the weekend., but you can be sure I do not reccomend this hotel as a 5 star.
Advise, sometimes the little difference, the human touch makes all the differences in the imperfections.",1,2016,09,05
09,"Gorgeous views, boutique hotel","Courmayeur is a beautiful place to relax in the summer.  The Grand Hotel Courmayeur is  great place to relax in Courmayeur.  The hotel only has about 72 rooms in three connected buildings.  The view from the terrace on our room was awesome !  What a sight to get up to every morning !  

The room was spacious, queen size mattress ( we usually sleep in a king), but very comfortable.  Bedding was excellent with choice of pillows.  The bathroom was extremely spacious.  The hotel is new, having just opened a couple of years ago and still has that new hotel smell.  The staff is extremely courteous and attentive.  We had a problem with the safe and the receptionist that answered the phone immediately came up to the room to reset the safe.

The spa is wonderful  I had a great massage at a reasonable price.  They have multiple shower experiences and am indoor pool with a button triggered waterfall.  A spacious outdoor deck is located by the pool with numerous loungers for sunning oneself.

The only negative was the lack of air conditioning in the rooms.  The weather cools off nicely at night, but one needs to leave the door to the terrace open.  Our room was off the road, so it had a great view but you heard cars going by most of the night with the door open.  The room was soundproof with the door closed.  A ceiling fan would be a great addition to the rooms.",5,2016,09,02
09,Mixed but overall disappointing experience,"We chose this hotel because we thought we would have a five star hotel experience, and we were willing to pay a bit more for a perfect visit, but we were not happy overall with our choice.  In summary:  (i) The location of this hotel is not ideal.  It is set high on a hill above a park, and the main attractions are all downhill.  Our visit was in the summer, but we imagine this will be especially inconvenient in the winter months.  (ii) FYI - The hotel advertises a 'private ski slope', this is just a small gentle 'bunny slope' for children.  (iii) The hotel is relatively new and has a nice modern design, especially in the layout of the junior suite we occupied (big and nicely appointed bathroom and walk-in closet), but surprisingly does not have the benefit of air conditioning.  The room had doors, not windows, so we had to sleep with the doors open.  The light on the porch could not be turned off which was annoying.  (iv) Bottled water is not provided free to guests.  WE thought this odd for a hotel of this stature.  (v) The gym is tiny and not well ventilated.  (vi) Our room faced the valley, rather than Mont Blanc.  On the same side of the hotel is the hotel pool and a children's park next door, so we heard a chorus of screaming children every afternoon. (vii)  There is free parking available in front of the hotel for only 12 cars (if parked well).  A garage is available for a nightly fee.  (viii) We were told before our arrival that the hotel dining room was fully booked for the entire period of our visit; what we were not told was the reason for this - a tour group was there throughout our visit.  Not our idea of a quiet and relaxing holiday break.  Overall, we would say this hotel did not provide value for money.
However, we would conclude by saying, the most positive aspect of our stay were the staff who were all friendly and very helpful.",3,2016,08,30
09,Beautiful location,"We had a room with a balcony facing Mont Blanc. What a view to wake up to each morning. Nice small spa with a small pool, sauna with a glass wall with a view, hamam and aromatherapy showers. Really comfy beds. The staff were exceptional and went out of their way for us. Good location for hiking, canyoning and other summer activities.",4,2016,08,23
09,Amazing hotel,"we stayed here as part of a group tour for a week in August 2016. I found that the service was excellent. very pleasant and always available to help. the waitstaff was always friendly, available and eager to help. The hotel itself is gorgeous both in the views and scenery it affords and the actual hotel as well. We would not hesitate to come back and stay here.",5,2016,08,23
09,Spa and restaurant were closed,"The hotel is probably not too bad,especially spa, room was big and clean (luxe), but the politic of the hotel was more when surprising-they had the 'special guests' from Israel, and spa was reserved for them for the evening hours,and the restaurant was closed as well!! Because they cooked only 'kosher' food-NONSENSE! Thanks god,they served a breakfast, but also,separately. Could not even order some food at the evening because of that-very disappointing decision to close all the services for the other clients,because of the 'special' guests. So be advised to check at the hotel before, would you be able to use spa and restaurant.",2,2016,07,20
09,Not recommended for those looking for good service and luxury hotel,"No charme or appropriate service in any part od the hotel. Non existant concierge. Recommendations for restaurants terrible with no possibility to book any decent one weeks in advance. Hotel restaurant understaffed. Spa overcrowded (6 beds and 6 chairs for hotel this size) Kids running around the pool in the evening eventhouth hotel policy does not allow kids entering after 3pm. Room cleaning not finished by 4pm ?? On the positive: Good beds and pillows. Nice sauna room with a view. 
Service, attention to details and warm welcome not perceived as important. Any of our complaints was not followed by a feedback. Never experienced something like this. All in all... If management of the hotel does not understand this very soon the hotel will only cater one time guests. Ok but far away from special experience. Would not return.  ",2,2016,03,27
09,Best 5* hotel in Courmayeur ,"Brand new, opened one year ago. Second time here and probably it's not the last one. Comfortable and well decorated rooms, nice SPA, breakfast buffet is rich and full of local product (Panizzi yoghurt is a must). We were on half board and restaurant menu changed every day, get ready to put some kilos on during your stay. Last, but not least, shuttle bus to Dolonne.",5,2016,03,25
09,Shocking service,"Nice design, but it really doesn't mean much, when the service is so shocking that all you can think of is moving to another hotel. Unfriendly and even rude staff, lack of hygiene, awful room service. I am genuinely puzzled how they passed the 5 star rating. Shockingly overpriced for the services that they provide. In my view 3 stars for their services would be a stretch.",1,2016,03,22
09,"Great facilties, poor service","Fantastic facilities and beautiful location, however the service was especially poor from the front of house staff. The other members of staff were very helpful and attentive- but reception were continually rude and unhelpful to multiple members of our group. Not what you would expect from a five star hotel.
Breakfast was excellent and the rooms were pristine and well decorated.
",4,2016,03,13
09,Sleek hardware marred by weak hospitality,"We stayed one week at this hotel. It was our second visit to Courmayeur, and though we enjoyed Au Couer des Neiges last time we decided to try GHC because of the modern design and spa photos on the hotel website.  I regret this decision:  the hotel hardware is indeed nice but there was a distinct lack of hospitality.  Staff seemed cold and seldom smiled. They didn’t seem interested in welcoming guests, a big contrast to Au Couer and hotels like Auberge where even as dinner guests we felt very warmly received. 

The rooms are modern, with cute bronze snowflake door handles and comfortable beds. Our room was in the main building on the lobby level and had a sliding door to an outdoor patio.  There are some design quirks:  our regular room had little room for luggage but the adjoining junior suite had an enormous walk-in closet.  There is a long desk but it lacks plugs.  The bathroom is big but has limited counter space and the water splashes out of the shower due to an inadequate glass enclosure.

The free Wifi requires user ID and password which are on little slips of paper you need to request from the front desk.  Though the paper says valid for 1 week but it expired within 4 days. It was tedious inputting these into my phone and computer and sorting this out for the kids as well.  There was no guide on how to use the hotel phone to dial the operator, room service, spa, etc.  Sometimes when calling the operator, there was no answer.  

The 2/F restaurant was disappointing.  There was little ambiance and the lady in charge who took our order seemed stressed.  Our order took 1 hour and when it arrived two dishes were incorrect and steaks were well-done instead of medium-rare.  The carpaccio was beautifully plated but flavorless. There was no children’s menu either.  As a result, we needed to pick up food from places in town when the kids wanted to eat in.  Fortunately there are plenty of nice restaurants in Courmayeur so we didn’t eat in the hotel restaurant after the first night.

Breakfast is reasonably good but isn’t available until 7:30am.  There is a selection of juices and fruits, hams and baked goods.  Too bad the scrambled eggs and bacon on the buffet were cold because the serving tray had no heat source.  Other hot items like omelettes are extra.  Service here was better except for the same lady supervisor from the dinner restaurant who was unhelpful.

The spa has a lovely pool and various chromatherapy showers, steam and sauna with a view. The spa attendent was the most energetic and friendly staff in the whole hotel. 

There is a shuttle van to take you to the various lifts/trams in Courmayeur as the hotel is not ski-in/ski-out. It’s a nice brand new van but only seats around 5-6 people max so isn’t the solution for a big group. The main town centre is about a 7-10 minute walk away.

In summary, this hotel has beautiful hardware but the hospitality didn’t match up to the physical premises.",3,2016,03,08
09,Amazing 5 star hotel but some of the staff very poor,"I write this review having stayed 6 night and the hotel was first class and very high quality. Rooms to a high standard and Spec. Sadly the hotel does is not really set up for English guests, I ordered poached egg 3 morning 2 of the staff did not understand the order, 1st morning they were dumped on the plate 2nd morning I sent them back as they very raw 3rd morning they never came so I just had toast.  On the final night I order a veg option rather then fish and was given some very over cook vegetables. On my table one of the organisors ask Marcos about an issue and he become very rude with her. The issue seemed to be that a number of the staff did not speak much English and has very limited customer care experience. So the tip would be if you are Italian it should be fine, if you are not or do not speak Italian. Also for large booking the dinner was poor when have 80 for dinner and kitchen was out of it's depth.",3,2016,03,07
09,Skiing in the Italian Alps,"The hotel is one year old and is beautiful. The people her are as helpful as can be. From breakfast in the morning to drinks in the bar lounge apre' ski was a great experience.  My wife says the Spa was a little noisy but, the facial she received was fabulous. Not a lot of excitement here but very nice. I will return.",5,2016,02,18
09,"OK, but lacking the bells and whistles (and service) of a 5 star","We stayed here last weekend as a family while we skied with friends in Courmayeur. The hotel employs a nordic, minimalist-chic aesthetic, which is successful overall in that the rooms are simple and clean, albeit small.  The beds are very comfortable and the bedding is lovely. The bathrooms are clean, although our towel warmer did not work (a nice-to-have during a normal visit, but an absolute necessity when you are skiing and need to dry out damp ski gear), the towels are fine and there are bathrobes and slippers in the rooms, though the latter are the cheap, disposable kind.  The complimentary bath soaps, etc are nothing special and not what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.  

There is a ski storage room downstairs, which would have been great, except for the fact that both lockers we used did not have functional warming tubes so we returned in the morning to find our boots and gloves in no better condition than we'd left them the night before.  

We attempted to order room service one evening and could not get through for over 15 minutes and eventually resorted to calling the main reception. The room service menu is quite sparse, although the food was well presented when it did arrive, although incredibly over-priced for my son's pasta with butter. 

The breakfast buffet is fresh and flavorful, but fairly sparse in their offerings.

Service, overall, was not great. The staff don't appear very happy and while they did answer questions when we had them, did not do anything above or beyond, or even smile at us or wish us a good day.  Having stayed at 5 star hotels the world over, I would say this one needs to spend a lot more time on the details and on their customer service in order to bring it back to that level. 

Courmayeur itself is a really lovely little ski town and has plenty to offer for skiers and diners. The skiing was fabulous and the views are breathtaking, so please don't take my review as a reason not to come to Courmayeur, we would happily return, perhaps not to this hotel, but certainly to the valley itself.",3,2016,02,11
09,"Nice fabric, poor service","Good looking hotel and room was very nice but the service was bizarre? We found it impossible to be served wine at dinner, the bar service was lacking and the lottery of breakfast was almost comedic - no glasses for juice, ordered food being delivered incorrectly on multiple occasions, no certainty of coffee ever arriving and heaven help you if you tried to engage the staff. the Wi-FI did not function consistently and the shower temperature changed of its own accord. If they could sort the service out this would be a great hotel - however I will look elsewhere next time.",3,2016,02,11
09,"Good, but not great.","Lot of things are good in this hotel, but it's missing these small extras that make your stay memorable.

At the room rate, you'd expect things like parking or ski locker to be included instead of being paid additionally (30euro) without any other option available.

Spa area is a big plus - pool is excellent, but in overall you expect more within this price range.",3,2016,02,07
09,It is a pleasure,Courmayeur  is a lovely skiing town in Alpes and Grand Hotel Mont Blanc is the place to stay. It is a very nice and comfortable hotel.  Nice view of Mont Blanc from rooms . The rooms are wide and comfortable. All hotel facilities are modern. The bar and sun terrace is perfect. The receptionists are polite and helpful. It is a very nice hotel to stay.,4,2016,02,02
09,Modern and warm luxury,"I went with my wife to this hotel for our anniversary. We were looking for a very nice place in the mountains, with a nice SPA and nicely located. Well we were not disappointed and you get the luxury you are paying for.

First, although the reception is a bit cold (I have seen friendlier places, even in Palaces), they were perfect and extremely helpful. I had a mistake in my booking (which was a shared mistake between me and the hotel) and they took right away a nice decision without compromising the relaxation nature of our stay there. We really appreciated this gesture and enjoyed every single minute there. 
We also got very good advices to go skating at the Val Ferret with all details on how to go there by bus.

The hotel is really modern and the architecture is stunning. You could imagine it as a huge chalet with large open spaces and all floors viewing to the central reception of the hotel. Everything is brand new (they opened in December 2014) and spotless.The SPA is very nicely located with large windows. It has great amenities (hammam, sauna, many showers, and a swimming pool) and is very relaxing. It maybe lacks a jacuzzi (they could have put one outside for example) but its not a big deal.

You have to walk 5-10 minutes to go to the village but we didn't see this as a problem. You get first a good walk after your big dinners in the evening (which is quite good after polenta, cheeses and various meats...) and then it also ensures the hotel is outside the louder areas of the village, ensuring a calm surrounding.

In the end, we had a great stay and came back relaxed and happy. If you want to have a luxury stay in Courmayeur, this hotel is probably one of the best locations there.",5,2016,02,02
09,Modern and elegant hotel with a mountain touch,"Very beautiful architecture; fits well with the environment. Beautiful and spacious rooms, nice wooden decoration. Attentive staff. Price /quality of the restaurant is ok: food is fine and nicely presented; hardly more expensive than the better restaurants in town. Wifi works very well everywhere in the hotel.Can not find anything negative about this hotel.",5,2016,02,01
09,Grand but expensive,"We had a very relaxing time in this modern luxury hotel.  The staff were all very helpful.  The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable.  The bathrooms were huge.  The balconies were huge too, with a great view of the mountains.

We rented our skis, boots and helmets from the rental shop in the hotel.  Whilst that was an expensive option it was more then repaid as the shop staff helped us take the gear in and out of the car every day.  In addition it was convenient to just leave it all there at the end of the trip.",5,2016,01,25
09,Great hotel,"The room we had (junior suite) was fantastic!
Breakfast was great (as previous reviews have said)
The only negative was the hotel (probably because it's relatively new and without a ""name"" yet in the local community) seemed unable to secure a table for dinner at four or five of the more popular restaurants. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2016,01,17
09,Recommend,"Very nice facility. The hotel is modern but quite elegant. The service is very good. The Spa could be better in the sense that I would not call the place a hotel  spa, but the facilities they have are ok. The food is good; don't expect one star michelin cuisine, but you will eat well and reasonably priced. I stayed there 2 nights with my wife and I would recommend it.",4,2015,09,08
09,Spoilt vacations,"Over the last 20 years my wife and I have been spending our vacations in the Alps. In 2015 we decided to stay in Courmayeur. 
In May 2015 we chose a 5* Grand Hotel Courmayeur Montblanc. We sent a reservation request to the Hotel and received a pleasant answer with booking details:
•	If cancelled or modified up to 14 days before date of arrival, 30 percent of the total price of the reservation will be charged;
•	If cancelled or modified later or in case of no-show, the total price of the reservation will be charged.
A booking confirmation was already received on 03.06.15 where the reservation period 25.07.2015-08.08.2015 and the price for 14 nights were mentioned. The correspondence was carried on with manager Alberto Cenci. Moreover, on 26.06.2015 Mr. Maurizio Searrone informed us about the possibility and the price of hotel shuttle service to and from airport.
We bought airplane tickets and happily were looking forward to our vacation. We started exploring the mountain routes and packing sport equipment for hiking. 
However 4 days before departure we were shocked by a certain Mr. Massimo Chiappo’s email that the reservation has been cancelled. Neither explanations, nor apologies were received.  Unilaterally.  
The vacation, tickets and mood were spoilt. 
Based on my experience, I would not recommend the Grand Hotel Courmayer Montblanc to anyone.",1,2015,07,27
09,Not so Grand,"We stayed at the hotel during mid term in February. First the name is somewhat missleading, its not a very large or grand hotel. Very contemporary in style but unfortunately lacking in ambience. The corridors and dining room gives more the vibes of a hospital than mountain resort. 

Our junior suite was very comfortable and large. Great turn down service and balcony. On yhe negative the hotwater was very hard to control and the tv only had italian channels. The walls are bare and the feeling is cold. 

There is a good skiroom and also a small shop and skirental service. As we left we were informed that the hotel offers skiguides. The spa, pool and gym ate rather small in reality compared to website renderings but all new and fresh. Breakfast was great with beautiful views of the mountiain and good service. However at night the dinning  room ambience is not good. There was a great shuttle service and staff was very pleasant and friendly.

A word of causion. We booked through booking.com and were charged the full weeks stay to our visa debit card the day before we arrived. This is clearly against  the booking rules and if this happens to anyone you should immediately report this to booking.com and request full compensation. We only did this afterwords and never received a proper apology.

For next time we would choose a hotel with a warmer ambience that does not bend the booking rules.",4,2015,04,07
09,Lovely new hotel,"We stayed for a night in an amazing brand new Junior Suite.
The room is probably 100sqm, with big bathroom (shower + bath tub) and dressing room (perfect to dress up for skiing).
We loved the spa and the breakfast and the free shuttle service to ski piste.

Couple of points to get better:
1) when we were in the SPA (1730-18:30) it was packed ... And with many people it gets messy (towels on the floor and on deck chairs everywhere in the pool); yet there was no personnels cleaning up and putting things in order. 
2) hotel rules says that kids should not be in the pool in the late afternoon ... Yet there were 2 both aged around 4-6. Where was the personnel to check?

",5,2015,03,30
09,Brand new and great location,This hotel has one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! The rooms and the hotel as a whole are beautifully designed. The customer service could improve by a lot but I would give it time. The hotel shuttle is also pretty convenient.,4,2015,03,24
09,Amazing hotel & great stay!,"Loved this hotel! Such luxury, style, and comfort! The rooms are top and services in the SPA were top notch. The hotel is conveniently located approximately 5 minutes walking distance from the city center. I would recommend this hotel to all for a relaxing weekend!",5,2015,03,24
09,Fantastic hotel and great service,We organized a weekend getaway for a large group at the hotel and had an absolutely fantastic experience.  The staff was extremely accommodating in all of the organization and even more friendly during our stay.  The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful and the facilities were of top quality.  I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a stay in Courma.,5,2015,03,24
09,An amazing experience in a brand new hotel,"Great hotel in a brilliant location in the centre of Courmayeur. The rooms are spacous, very clean, and modern. Staff is friendly and helpful. Fantastic view and relaxed atmosphere. I would highly recommend and will definitely go again!",5,2015,03,24
09,Unhappy customer,"The hotel is convinently located, 10 minutes away from the center (via roma). Though the service i have to say was very lacking. From the cold reception who gave us one key for a double bedroom, up to their continuous disinterest in helping out. As i was there with my sister for only two days, we asked for skii rental shops and clothes, they gave us no help whatsoever. I must say highly dissappointed. We ended up finding skii equipment but through northface the shop without any help from reception who should be aware about the only skii clothing and equipment rental shop in town. Afterwards, in the spa, during a facial, the hot steamer fell on my inner arm causing a mild burn, no first aid assistance was given, i had to pay for my cream, and was not refunded. I must say the hotel is beautiful but the bad service mixed with horrible attitude is what made me write such a review. Customer service is not a 5 star rate.",2,2015,03,21
09,Great just for dinner,"Came here just for dinner which was delicious. It is modern and contemporary, perfect for dinner with a touch of sophistication. Do not go here if you want a noisy family experience, or traditional surrounds. Usefully, the hotel offers underground parking for diners too.",4,2015,03,17
09,Fab new hotel that should improve in time,I stayed at this new hotel in Courmayeur with my wife and another couple for 4 nights (Sat to Weds) for a short skiing holiday. I was very lucky as I had been to Val D'Isere earlier in the week on a business ski trip. The contrast couldn't be more stark. The GH is in a tranquil setting (about 10 mins walk from Bar Roma) with breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains. It features huge glass windows everywhere and acres of wood and stone. It's the kind of thing you expect to find in Colorado but with a European chalet twist. I thought it worked very well indeed. The rooms (we stayed in a junior suite our friends in a comfort room) were excellent. Only complaint is that the bath was an odd square shape which made it difficult to get comfortable if you are over 6 foot. It also took ages to fill.The ski service and associated ski room were first class. The spa is a real treat. One wall of the Sauna is a huge floor to ceiling pane of glass that looks out towards mountains.  The hotel is new and still finding its feet from a service standpoint (bar service was poor and it lacked ambience - a little good music would have helped rather than the tinny sound of the radio drifting in from bar kitchen!) but this will improve on time.  I'm certainly intending to return next year to find out!! ,4,2015,03,12
09,Brand new Hotel that does the job!,"Stayed here for 3 nights just after it had opened and therefore the service/processes were a little off, but everything was shiny and new to compensate!

The major talking point is the hotels layout which consists of 3 linked buildings which made getting around less easy than normal. For example to get to breakfast I take only 1 of the 2 lifts down, walk across to reception and then take the stairs or another lift from reception to the dining hall...

Breakfast was first rate, the rooms are perfectly adequate for a ski trip, the ski room is huge and the lockers warm your kit up! The hotel has two shuttle buses so be prepared to wait in the morning or get up early.

Spa has a small pool and only a few sun loungers so don't expect to get one but there is a well equipped fitness room, an excellent sauna and steam room and a set of showers with alternating hot and cold programs to help rejuvenate you after a day's skiing

The hotel is very Italian so much so the TV has no English channels and is situated 10mins walk from the town centre. This makes for a tranquil setting and perhaps not the place for those looking for late night drinking and atmosphere as it's also family oriented 

Yes I would recommend and stay here again 

",4,2015,03,08
09,Excellent staff and facility,"Staff was very attentive to our every need. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and well appointed with great products in the bathroom. Views from the rooms and public areas are amazing. Hotel is on the edge of the town proper, therefore affording open views to the mountains. The spa facility is perfectly designed with a modern mountain feel. All the areas of the spa were well thought out. Lella at the spa was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely return.",5,2015,01,24
09,Fantastic staff,"I stayed at this hotel for work in early September, I found a perfect welcome and organization.
Perfect rooms and with every comfort.
Special praise to the girls of the Spa: kind, professional and always very smiling.",5,2024,09,14

We found a clean and comfortable environment. Note of merit for the spa staff who immediately proved helpful and friendly giving us an afternoon of true relaxation.",4,2024,09,14
09,Excellent surprise,"Excellent hotel within walking distance of downtown 
Upon your arrival max availability of receptionists.
In this regard, an applause goes to Front Office Manager Nando ... ke informed us of all that ke was needed x the stay and many other tips anke x the visit to the Mont Blanc skyway. 
In these high-level facilities, people make the difference, and here I found that attention and availability ke brings out the difference between the various locations.",5,2024,08,30
09,Far from our expectations!!!,"We chose this 5 star hotel thinking we had a service to match instead we were totally disappointed with some services: spa service and reception service. The massage rooms are not soundproofed so you can hear all the noises coming from the pool and the mini gym a little 'poor.
The courtesy of the reception leaves much to be desired.
I hope our criticism can be constructive as the structure is very nice and it is a shame!!!",2,2024,08,23
09,Excellent,"Highly recommended hotel. 
Perfect location 5 minutes walk from the center. Nice rooms with large and modern bathrooms. 
The shuttle service is really useful! A plus that not many hotels offer!! 
The staff is also very good, always smiling and always ready to help or recommend restaurants / activities etc. Special thanks to Wiam and Fatima for their availability and sympathy! 
Paola and Praneel",5,2024,08,22
09,Excellent,"We stayed several times in July and were very happy. Relatively new hotel, spacious rooms, friendly and helpful staff, especially the legendary Nando's. Very convenient shuttle service, also active in summer. Convenient location, a few minutes walk from the center.",5,2024,08,19
09,Never again! Not recommended. The stars are too many.,"We chose this property which was well advertised as a luxury hotel, reading rave reviews, which turned out to be imaginative and/or convenient in practice. Maintenance and cleaning are absolutely lacking. The staff is cobbled together and not very competent, being mainly made up of foreign kids who do not know the Italian language well. But even the Italians present do not industry to make the stay comfortable which is particularly expensive in relation to the 5-star claims. The structure is not equipped with blinds nor ‘abountiful, so’ at 6 am enters full light that wakes up; in the afternoon then entered a full sun that heated the room making the night unlivable for hot air; needless to say that there is no air conditioning, scandalous. We took advantage of the in-house restaurant La fourchette, which offers questionable cuisine and deficient lounge service. On the last day I tried early in the morning to book a table for dinner, which I was denied with peregrine justifications forcing us to make do elsewhere with the obvious difficulties of Ferrara. With oversized rooms there would be no room for two people. Spiteful vulgarity for the veiled complaints; the director himself, made aware, did not want to intervene with plastic disinterest in the difficulties of a customer in the mid-August period. And what about the TV, malfunctioning? On reporting the fault I was answered by the reception that I would have to wait the next day for verification. Absurd, especially in an alleged 5-star. However, no technician was seen, so much so that we had to make do. As for the advertised shuttle service, one of the drivers, a foreigner with rude manners, had to endure harassment. Finally, the breakfast service is mediocre both in the food offered and in the staff; they made us get up several times from the table chosen for their convenience. Departing, finally, from the hotel we do not find anything for breakfast because it was 7.20 am, that is ten minutes before the opening, despite having notified the reception the night before of the morning departure. Inhospitable, though very careful to load the accounts. I strongly and selflessly advise against staying at this hotel. They should give up at least two of the five-star claims and astronomical prices.",1,2024,08,18
09,Unforgettable hotel,"If anyone wants to take their head off and relax I recommend this hotel, well maintained great food, friendly and caring staff starting from Nando of the front office who cared about our well-being in structure and Cristiano who gave us great hiking tips, great breakfast and well stocked restaurant with quality dishes and polite qualified staff. The well maintained spa and very relaxing shame that these holidays have flown but then again when you are well and so, I hope to return this winter. Thank you all for this HOLIDAY",5,2024,08,16

The hotel offers everything you could want for a very pleasant holiday. Special thanks to Nando from the front office for the attention he gave us and a special mention for the excellent breakfast overlooking the Giant's Tooth.",5,2024,08,15
09,Wonderful stay in Courmayeur,We stayed at this beautiful hotel located in a lovely location in August during the summer holidays. Both the quality of the structure and the service offered are at the top. The staff welcomes you with kindness and attention to fulfill any request. Special thanks to the reception manager sig.Nando and the restaurant staff. We have been visiting Courmayeur for many years and have been won over by this holiday.,5,2024,08,14
09,Excellent level solution,"I stayed for two nights with my family at this property which is located a few hundred meters outside the pedestrian center of Courmayeur.
We all had a great time. 
The structure is very nice and the rooms well furnished with a spectacular view of Mont Blanc. The staff and 'all very kind and considerate and was able to meet our every need.
Great breakfast and not discounted free parking in the garage.
For sure it will be our reference hotel in case of high stays in Courmayeur.",5,2024,08,14

In particular it is worth mentioning the reception manager Alessandro/Nando who made our experience unforgettable.",5,2024,07,31
09,Mismanagement of manager by cockroaches,"The appearance of cockroaches in the bathroom of our room. 
After saying it at the reception showing a picture, we had no communication so we asked again at reception 
All they told us was “that they had sent someone”
When we complained when we left, the manager argued that it was because it was “a hotel in the countryside”
Mismanagement of the manager",2,2024,07,31
09,To be repeated n,Very kind and competent staff.  Great cleaning. The SPA is a bit small but very well maintained. The restaurant has excellent cuisine and the service is taken care of. I mention Caesar for advice on choosing wines. At reception Nando and Alessandro were efficient and helpful.,5,2024,07,29

I recommend this hotel for several reasons. We have a dog of over 40 kg and were welcomed wonderfully. The breakfast is fabulous and tasty, we chose to make it on the terrace with a breathtaking view. The great location a step fal center and the park next door super convenient for our dog. Very efficient and friendly staff, impeccable services. I would definitely repeat the stay at this hotel when we return to Courmayeur!!!
Important thanks Nando for recommending a fabulous excursion with Francesco dog educator of Giochi di Naso for a wonderful six-legged walk 🐾",5,2024,07,28
09,Posto meraviglioso!,"It is our first time in Courmayeur and this hotel was really a surprise. The rooms are clean and well appointed, the shuttle service to the center works well, all the staff is very helpful and kind. A special thanks to Nando who invited us to come back, maybe even in the winter season. His guys helped us get all the information we wanted. Great food at breakfast service. I would still suggest a spa service a little longer than the appointed time. For the rest, we look forward to returning.",5,2024,07,28
09,Good choice,"Good hotel, just outside the pedestrian area of Courmayeur, in a great position to arrive and park and to walk to the pedestrian center of the village. Very clean hotel, excellent and plentiful and varied breakfast, kind and full of information at the reception, employees in the dining room kind and nice. Very good spa , both for cleanliness and choice, very good girl of the spa. An applause to the receptionist who gave us very useful advice. To improve the level of the restaurant x à la carte dinners. However 100 x 100 Recommendation",4,2024,07,26

Very large room, spotless, warm and welcoming, with a characteristic terrace in the room, from which to admire the uncontaminated landscape overlooking it. Excellent service, indelible memories.

09,What a nice “welcome back”,"I was here with my wife last year but the ownership and management changed this year. And the difference is noticeable, abysmal. First of all, Nando the receptionist welcomed us in an elegant and professional way, his boys are no less. Taste and quality of food as well as in the restaurant. Rooms with nice design and clean. I was more than satisfied. Highly Recommendation.",5,2024,07,22

Fast check-in and out without problems.",5,2024,07,17
09,Our opinion after a short stay,"We had a great experience from various points of view. From the moment of reception we were immediately put at ease. All the staff proved immediately helpful and efficient. The well furnished and comfortable room, the restaurant that lives up to the expectations are part of our positive comment.  We did not have the opportunity to go to the spa and pool but those who went spoke very well.",5,2024,07,14
09,Esperienza irrinunciabile!,"I found this place exquisite, not only in its extraordinary beauty care and cleanliness but also and above all in the professionalism and kindness of all the staff.
In particular I appreciated Nando's availability and Alessandro's great kindness and care at the reception, as well as the spa girls who hosted my son for the first time at the age of 14 in the spa with a welcome gift for his birthday.
What I appreciated most was the communication so friendly but professional confidential that puts all guests at ease.
Grand Hotel Courmayeur, truly an experience to be repeated as soon as possible!
For those interested in food breakfast offers an extraordinary buffet with top quality food and a cuisine with starred chef.",5,2024,07,14
09,Excellent Alpine hotel,"Excellent hotel with Alpine style rooms and excellent views from the room's balcony.
We chose half board. The staff proved to be up to the quality of the hotel. Perfect with animals and a stone's throw from the center. We had a very good time and it will become our point of reference for our stays in the Aosta Valley.",5,2024,03,06
09,A 3 star for the price of a 5. Don't go!,"What can I say: it's not a 5 star. You arrive and they barely carry your bags to your room. Where can we park? What time is breakfast? What services does the property offer? Of course, I don't expect great attention from a kid at the reception who has just graduated. Normal room, I've seen better in 4 stars. The first day they didn't come to make up the room.
Four of us had finished all the shower gel, no one came by to redo the room so I had to request it twice.
On the second day we were unable to go to the spa because access is limited and can only be accessed by reservation (we didn't know anything about it, my sister found out by chance).
Everyone abandons their cars in front and blocks the exit of regularly parked cars, so we ask how do we get out? Come back in half an hour. They provide a shuttle service to Dolonne, the shuttles of all the other hotels arrived but not theirs. I had to get on the phone and they had a random car arrive.

I laugh now when I discovered that I paid a little less for all this.",2,2024,03,02
09,A hotel dream,"Our first holiday in Valle d'Aosta couldn't have gone better than this. thanks to the hotel staff and all the services offered, the stay was nothing short of magical.
Large rooms furnished with great taste, modernity that blends perfectly with the Alpine style. Comfortable beds and pillows of different softness. Huge bathroom, well structured, super soft and scented towels. In the room we had a spacious balcony overlooking the mountains (superlative!), with a small table and two seats. even the presence of the desk made it possible for us to do some office work even though we were on holiday, also thanks to the good wi-fi connection.
large TV, and good soundproofing of the rooms. electronic safe, minibar, spacious wardrobe.
bathrobe and slippers for the SPA available to guests.
only flaw: we definitely need to permanently eliminate the disposable plastic containers in the bathroom, and the absence of a kettle and cups in the room. for the rest nothing to say.

We opted for half board and I must say that there has never been a better choice than this. wanting to have a restful and sporting holiday, having dinner in the hotel every evening was a real convenience. Furthermore, the menu was changed every evening, which always gave us a wide selection of dishes. The chef is fabulous, the service impeccable, as is the breakfast: one of the best I've ever had.
Compliments in particular to the dining room staff: jovial and discreet, prepared and efficient. special thanks to Luca and Maria, who really gave us an excellent service.
Let's come to the SPA: not very large but ideal for post-ski relaxation. the swimming pool is heated, with hydromassage and neck massage. The sauna is small but has a beautiful window that allows you to look out at the mountains while you warm up.
The emotional showers and the Turkish bath are also beautiful.
if you are lucky enough not to run into rude guests who talk in a loud voice, or who occupy sunbeds with dirty towels after leaving, everything is truly fabulous.
A note of merit also to the girls at the SPA, who are very present to ensure that etiquette is respected and that guests' rest is guaranteed: the fact of having politely informed some guests that children are not allowed after a certain time in the pool it was a gesture that I greatly appreciated. Very good.
the presence of the SKI room also makes everything very functional for skiing: each guest has access to a locker that opens with a magnetic card, where they can place their boots, skis and poles. the cabinet is heated so TOP!
There is also a car park available to guests in front of the hotel entrance and a covered one which can be accessed with the room's magnetic card. here too, excellent service.

less than 10 minutes walk from the centre, but off the busiest roads, this hotel is truly magnificent.

09,Optimal,"Hotel that deserves 5 stars from all points of view: location, food, SPA, comfort but above all the kindness of everyone who works there. Thank you
I recommend the rooms overlooking the lawn where there are deckchairs and you can relax while seeing Mont Blanc",5,2023,08,25
09,Heaven on earth,"A hotel worth more than 5 stars.
I spent a heavenly holiday in this magnificent place.
Everyone was welcoming, thoughtful and precise.
The rooms with Mont Blanc view, a work of art that nourishes your sight and soul.
The impeccable cuisine. All extraordinary.
I want to mention the director and the deputy directors, I want to mention Emanuele, Antonio and the Maître the chef whose names unfortunately I don't remember.
I'll definitely be there.
Well done everyone!

09,SPA AT THE TOP,"I highly recommend trying the treatments with the manager Valentina inside the wellness center (open not only to hotel guests), in particular the Japanese kirei kobido facial which has an exceptional lifting result...seeing is believing!!!",5,2023,08,19
09,Piuttosto delusa,"Inizio elencando i lati positivi..
La struttura è molto bella, in posizione perfetta perché appartata nel verde ma davvero vicina al centro raggiungibile in pochi minuti a piedi.
La camera mi è piaciuta..piccolina (era una confort) ma con spazi bene organizzati e vista stupenda sul Monte Bianco.
Arrivo ai lati negativi..
Abbiamo avuto un problema con il lavello della camera, a detta del personale è stato risolto cosa in realtà non veritiera..se il tecnico è stato mandato (come credo e spero) non ha risolto un bel nulla e il personale di turno non ha controllato.
Colazione inqualificabile... partiamo dal personale.. ragazzi molto giovani, direi gentili ma non hanno nessuna idea di cosa debbano fare lì dentro..sguardi spersi in attesa di essere chiamati per le bevande perché altrimenti non si presentano al tavolo.
Tostapane rotto..su due mattine entrambe non funzionante, poi fatto partire da uno dei ragazzi e poi di nuovo bloccato..in un 5 stelle?????
Un velo pietoso sulla qualità delle pietanze della colazione..nessun prodotto del territorio (fatta eccezione per lo yogurt in barattolo), succhi ""chimici"" , brioches surgelate della peggior qualità, torte dolci industriali, pochissima frutta fresca, il tutto servito in vetrinette di plastica per la maggior parte rotte..ma stiamo scherzando??? Un servizio così in una struttura 5 stelle per di più di montagna..non ho parole, non ci volevo credere.
Senza trascurare il fatto che il primo giorno ci siamo presentati nella sala alle 9.45 (colazione servita fino alle 10 con persone arrivate anche dopo di noi) e sui tavoli erano rimaste due fette di formaggio, una di prosciutto e un po' di frutta sciroppata.
Non mi è mai successo da nessun'altra parte, davvero.
Si percepisce la mancanza di una figura di esperienza che controlli ed insegni al personale come muoversi in un hotel di categoria
Peccato, manca tutto quello che è l'attenzione e la ""coccola"" per il cliente..dimenticavo.. prodotti da bagno presenti in camera di categoria bassissima.

09,una vacanza da sogno,"la nostra prima vacanza in Valle d'Aosta non poteva andare meglio di così. grazie allo staff dell'hotel e a tutti i servizi offerti, il soggiorno è stato a dir poco magico.
Camere ampie e arredate con grande gusto, la modernità che si sposa perfettamente con lo stile alpino. Letti comodi e cuscini di diverse morbidezze. Bagno enorme, ben strutturato, asciugamani super soffici e profumati. In camera avevamo un balcone vista monti (superlativo!) spazioso, con tavolino e due sede. anche la presenza della scrivania ci ha reso possibile anche fare qualche lavoro d'ufficio malgrado fossimo in ferie, anche grazie alla buona connessione wi-fi.
tv grande,  e buona insonorizzazione delle stanze. cassaforte elettronica, frigobar, armadio spazioso.
a disposizione degli ospiti accappatoio, ciabatte per la SPA.
unica pecca: bisogna decisamente eliminare definitivamente i contenitori monouso di plastica nel bagno, e l'assenza del bollitore e di tazze nella stanza. per il resto niente da dire.

Abbiamo optato per la mezza pensione e devo dire che mai scelta è stata migliore di questa. volendo fare una vacanza riposante e sportiva, avere la cena in hotel tutte le sere è stata una vera comodità. Inoltre il menù veniva cambiato ogni sera, il che ci dava sempre ampia selezione delle pietanze. Lo chef è favoloso, il servizio impeccabile, così come la colazione: una delle migliori che abbia mai fatto.
Complimenti in particolare al personale di sala: gioviale e discreto, preparato ed efficiente. un ringraziamento speciale a Luca e Maria, che ci hanno davvero reso un servizio eccellente.
Veniamo alla SPA: non grandissima ma l'ideale per il relax post sci. la piscina è riscaldata, con idromassaggio e massaggio cervicale. La sauna è piccola ma gode di una stupenda vetrata che ti permette di guardare le montagne mentre ti riscaldi.
belle anche le docce emozionali e il bagno turco.
se si ha la fortuna di non incappare in ospiti maleducati che parlano a voce alta, oppure che occupano lettini con gli asciugamani sporchi dopo essersene andati, è davvero tutto favoloso.
Una nota di merito anche alle ragazze della SPA, molto presenti a vigilare che sia rispettata l'etiquette, e che sia garantito il riposo degli ospiti: il fatto di aver segnalato con garbo ad alcuni ospiti che i bambini dopo un certo orario non sono ammessi in piscina è stato un gesto che ho molto apprezzato. Bravissime.
la presenza anche della SKI room rende tutto molto funzionale per lo sci: ogni ospite ha a disposizione un armadietto che si apre con una tessera magnetica, dove appoggiare gli scarponi, sci e bastoncini. l'armadietto è riscaldato quindi TOP!
a disposizione degli ospiti anche un parcheggio di fronte all'ingresso dell'hotel e uno coperto al quale si accede con la tessera magnetica della stanza. anche qui, ottimo servizio.

a meno di 10 minuti a piedi dal centro, ma fuori dalle strade più trafficate, questo hotel è davvero magnifico.",5,2023,06,03
09,"Bello, ma …","Premesso che si tratta di un hotel 5 stelle, quindi il livello di servizi e facilities è senz’altro elevato. 
Diciamo che siamo stati sorpresi dalla “chiassosità” della spa e delle parti comuni. Sembra poco insonorizzato: alle 2 di notte, siamo stati svegliati da altri ospiti che raggiungevano la propria stanza nel nostro corridoio.
Anche in spa le voci sono un po’ “elevate” e basta ci sia qualche persona in più per avere un ambiente un po’ (tanto) rumoroso.",3,2023,03,26
09,Ottimo Hotel,"Ho soggiornato lo scorso weekend in questo magnifico posto, compreso di spa.
Colazione ottima, pulizia ottima, personale gentilissimo e disponibile. 
Possibilità di massaggi in hotel. 
Io personalmente mi sono trovato benissimo con Valentina che mi ha trattato con il massaggio in maniera rilassante ed efficiente. 
Ci tornerò sicuramente.
Consigliato.",5,2023,01,28
09,Bell’hotel ma peccato per alcuni elementi,"Ambiente moderno sia nelle parti comuni che nelle camere. Tutti gli spazi risultano perfettamente puliti, letto comodo e camere ben insonorizzate. 
Colazione ottima: cibo di qualità e sufficientemente vario. Ottimo servizio navetta per gli ospiti. Presente all’interno anche una piccola SPA (piccola piscina con idro, una sauna un bagno turco e due docce emozionali) 
Potrebbe ottenere il punteggio massimo se non fosse per alcuni “elementi” legati al personale, che non possono essere trascurati se pago 400 euro (e più) per una notte:
1) il personale delle navette (eccetto per il ragazzo in servizio il sabato 21 al mattino) è scortese e scocciato. Il sig che ci ha accompagnati al ristorante la sera ha manifestato molto apertamente il suo disappunto nel “doverci accompagnare” al ristorante, quasi si facesse un favore.. peccato sia un servizio compreso nel prezzo.

2) il personale della sala colazione assolutamente non in grado di gestire l’afflusso di persone (che per altro ad un certo punto si era creata una cosa di 15 min per accomodarsi ai tavoli). Ma passi la coda (che per altro non ha riguardato noi, ma ha creato discussioni e momenti di tensione) non è accettabile però che uno dei camerieri in sala (per altro il più anziano) inizi a imprecare e lanciare i tovaglioli sui tavoli vuoti, o faccia battute poco carine nei confronti di un bambino che piangeva in sala definendolo un disturbatore (“vi consiglio di sedervi in un altro tavolo così almeno non avete il disturbatore nelle orecchie”, tutto ciò davanti ai genitori del bambino, che erano increduli) 

3) sabato sera abbiamo avuto un problema tecnico in camera legato alla corrente e molto gentilmente dalla reception ci mandano in camera un addetto che entra seccato e senza neppure capire quale fosse il problema emette la sua “sentenza” ipotizzando che avessimo dispositivi Apple taroccati definendoli delle “cinesate” .. senza neppure guardare… ehhh?? 
Per fortuna poi la reception ci ha inviato su un altro addetto molto gentile.

Mi dispiace ma se prenoto una camera deluxe mi aspetto personale quanto meno cordiale come quello della reception. 

Peccato potrebbe davvero essere un hotel top se facessero attenzione ad alcuni componenti del personale.",4,2023,01,24
09,"Hotel bellissimo, servizi non da 5 stelle","Hotel molto bello , in una magnifica zona a pochi passi dal centro. Ho apprezzato molto la SPA, i massaggi e il piano bar serale.
La junior suite è un po’ piccola per 4.
I servizi non sono assolutamente all’altezza di un 5 stelle.
Eravamo in 4 e avevamo solo un accappatoio.
La camera alcuni giorni veniva rifatta a metà’ pomeriggio.
Ci è capitato due volte che mancasse l’acqua mentre stavamo facendo il bagno.
25 euro al giorno per il cane per avere solo una ciotola di plastica. Il lettino promesso in sede di prenotazione non si è mai visto.
Un giorno rientrati dello sci abbiamo atteso un ora al freddo in mezzo alla strada prima di essere recuperati.
Un vero peccato perché la struttura merita davvero ma a quei prezzi mi sarei aspettata  un  servizio decisamente migliore.",3,2023,01,15
09,Laureata,"Struttura molto bella, personale carino , cibo ottimo, accoglienza alla spa ottima. La ragazza di nome Valentina molto preparata, professionale, gentile e disponibile a rispondere a domande di nutrizione. Massaggio super.",4,2023,01,09
09,Da non ripetere un caffè caro e mal,"La posizione dell’albergo è eccezionale, gli spazi comuni molto fruibili, il personale inadeguato. Avevo provato ad agosto a bere un caffè al bar accessibile anche agli esterni, dopo aver atteso invano in reception  per 24 minuti di orologio senza che nessuno fosse in grado di indicarmi neppure dove fosse il bar ho desistito. Oggi 6 gennaio ci ho riprovato. Cortesemente ci hanno indicato il bar dove dopo essere riusciti ad ordinarlo velocemente abbiamo atteso un caffè palesemente n espresso per 23 minuti. Il caffè è stato preso al banco, mancava anche lo zucchero, il suo prezzo uno scandalo: 3 caffè euro 15,00 
La ricevuta di pagamento non indica che trattasi di 3 caffè..",1,2023,01,06
09,"Vista meravigliosa, da migliorare il servizio","L’hotel è bello, la vista dalle stanze è bellissima e anche dalla sala della colazione.
La stanza spaziosa e anche il bagno.
Peccato però che non ci fosse acqua calda e il personale non ha saputo gestire l’emergenza. 
Per ben 3 volte sono venuti a mettere “le dita sotto l’acqua” per sincerarsi che effettivamente non ci fosse acqua calda. 
Tutto questo spalmato su 3 ore , lasciando passare il tempo , proprio nel momento in cui si rientra da una giornata di sport, e per andare a cena. 
Il personale non ha saputo assolutamente ne gestire la situazione, ne comunicare in maniera esaustiva e informativa i clienti.
In definitiva personale gentile e disponibile , ma incapace a gestire una struttura di alto livello. 

Dopo richiesta, è stato applicato uno sconto.",3,2022,09,11
09,Viaggio tra ciclisti ,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per una gara ciclistica.Hotel belissimo e con molti spazi sia interni ,che esterni.Le camere sono spaziose e pulite.La colazione e abbondante e con molti prodotti locali.Servizio generale ottimo sotto tutti gli aspetti!!!Super consigliato!!",5,2022,09,01
09,Hotel deludente,"Non è assolutamente un hotel da 5 stelle, poiché vi è una grande diversità tra le camere, alcune non raggiungono nemmeno 2 stelle. Pur pagando più di 580€ per due notti, lamentandomi per la pessima camera ricevuta mi è stato risposto dalla direttrice che “quella camera ai suoi clienti non la danno ma solo per chi prenota tramite Booking”. Trovo alquanto ridicola e disdicevole tale affermazione, in quanto si afferma essere un hotel da 5 stelle e non dovrebbe avere così ampia distinzione tra le camere, poiché appunto anche la nostra, se pur di bassa categoria, aveva comunque un costo elevato. Inoltre la colazione era mediocre, sempre appunto molto sotto a uno standard da hotel 5 stelle.  Non lo consiglio.",1,2022,08,30
09,Quasi un 5 stelle...,"L'hotel è nuovo, la struttura è moderna ma con richiami alla montagna grazie al grande impiego di legno. Diciamo che non è il classico hotel baita ma ha un arredamento più minimalista ma comunque caldo. La stanza era di buone dimensioni con un bagno grande e una vista sul Monte Bianco molto bella. 
Ottima anche la posizione perché è leggermente fuori dal centro e quindi dal caos ma in 5 minuti si può raggiungere la via principale a piedi. Ottimo il garage. Molto valida anche la SPA, non molto grande ma con tutto il necessario per rilassarsi dopo una giornata in montagna. Ottimi i massaggi.

Cosa non mi è piaciuto: La colazione è industriale con parte dolce senza alcun prodotto locale e tutto (dai cornetti alle torte) da grande distribuzione. 
In camera non c'era il bollitore e/o la macchinetta del caffè, cosa strana per un hotel a 5 stelle. Altra cosa ridicola è il costo dell'acqua del minibar in camera a ben 4€ per mezzo litro... Generalmente in hotel a 5 stelle l'acqua non è a pagamento o se lo è non certo a una cifra del genere. Ristorante e servizio non all'altezza di un 5 stelle.",4,2022,08,22
09,Bellissima camera vista montagna!,Personale cordiale e disponile. Bellissima camera a due piani vista montagna. Stanze pulitissime. Comodità al 100% per posizione (a 2 minuti a piedi dalla via centrale del paese) parcheggio esterno gratuito. Molto apprezzati giochi per i bambini. Ricco buffet a colazione per soddisfare ogni gusto. Spa da non perdere! Super consigliato per un meraviglioso soggiorno in famiglia a Courmayeur.,5,2022,08,13
09,a due passi dal centro,"Hotel pulito e comodo, a due passi dal centro. La ns camera dava all'interno di un cortile ed era ben insonorizzata. Molto carina l'idea del soppalco con i due letti singoli dove hanno dormito i ns figli. Colazione business con alcuni prodotti del territorio, validi ed abbondanti. Gentilezza e cortesia del personale.",4,2022,08,05
09,5 stelle di nome e di fatto..??,"Staff e servizi offerti assolutamente perfetti, accoglienza ottima se si ha con sè un cane. Colazione con un gran bel buffet di qualità… 
Pulizia camera non proprio perfetta con qualche ragnatela qua e là, ahimè in un albergo a 5 stelle ci si aspetta forse sia tutto “perfetto”..Deludente” la struttura in sè per essere un 5 stelle…",4,2022,08,01
09,Grandissima delusione week end rovinato,"Siamo stati ospiti un week end, noi speravamo di poterci rilassare e riposare invece ci siamo trovati in una struttura dove venivano festeggiati due matrimoni, uno il venerdì è uno il sabato, quindi musica tutto il giorno e la sera compresa, Garage con macchine in seconda fila…, spazi comuni non vivibili, SPA con musica e speaker mentre il personale ci augurava un buon relax, sotto le finestre della camera schiamazzi vari, la colazione buona ma non andate vicino all’orario di chiusura perché molte cose non vengono rimpiazzate, camera e servizio non all’altezza di un cinque stelle. Abbiamo pagato sicuramente troppo per ciò che abbiamo usufruito. Non lo consiglio a nessuno.",1,2022,07,23
09,"Bello, ma organizzazione da rivedere","Soggiorno di 4 notti con la famiglia. Pro:struttura composta da chalet, molto bella, posizione fantastica, camere accoglienti, servizio ai piani(pulizia, rifacimento stanze) ottimo. Così così :spa piccola e ben curata, ma con forti limitazioni per l'accesso (se ci tenete molto chiedete bene prima come funziona). Aspetti da rivedere:colazione non in linea con un 5stelle,sia come servizio che come abbondanza e varietà del cibo. Ristorante :cibo servito molto buono, ma organizzazione del personale di sala inesistente.. È evidente la buona volontà di chi serve ai tavoli, ma davvero impreparati per un ristorante di livello.. lunghe attese, piatti portati al tavolo non in contemporanea, proposte per i bambini :""pasta in bianco o al ragù"" e stop.Non ci siamo. Mi spiace per chi ci lavora perché si vede che ci mettono impegno, ma chi sta sopra deve davvero rivedere tanti aspetti. Siamo stati in strutture di alto livello in Alto Adige e la differenza si fa sentire. ",3,2022,07,19
09,"QUALCHE LUCE, MOLTE OMBRE","Struttura nuova e piacevole, con una location proprio sotto le montagne. E' bella la struttura, anche se gli spazi sono stati distribuiti maluccio a mio avviso, ovvero zona reception grande ma senza alcuna intimità, spazi al piano di sopra poco fruibili etc. CAMERA bellissima, con boiserie in legno naturale grezzo, bagno enorme, bellissima cabina armadio (anche se poco funzionale in quanto non aveva il classico ""apritrolley"" e mancava di comodi cassetti per riporre le cose). Frigobar inesistente, così come lato caffè/tea (nessuna macchina presente, solo uno squallido bollitore pieno di calcare). Non avevamo inoltre la possibilità di avere coperte di peso differente e questo in un 5 stelle deve esserci. La camera prenotata con uno sconto proposto sul sito aveva parecchi difetti (forse per questo scontata?), tra cui la maniglia del terrazzo rimastaci in mano e come spiegherò sotto il problema della serratura della porta. Vista però da cartolina! Parcheggio sottostante bello, peccato che quello di fronte all'hotel non avesse le strisce per le divisioni dello spazio, con la conseguenza che clienti maleducati avevano potuto parcheggiare occupando due posti (sic!). Fin qui tuttavia solo luci, o quasi. Veniamo ora alle vere ombre: servizio reception pessimo, tutti stager, incapaci di gestire l'ospite e anche incapaci di parlare la lingua italiana (ma siamo in Italia, giusto?). La chiave che apre le camere NON FUNZIONA MAI. Ci è stato detto che per aprire la porta si deve spingerla o con il piede (sic!) oppure con la mano contemporaneamente. Vi assicuro che non solo siamo rimasti più volte al piano per alcuni minuti senza riuscire ad entrare, ma altre volte siamo dovuti addirittura scendere in reception dove ci siamo sentiti dire (come se fossimo scemi) che è normale aprire le camere in questo modo qui al Grand Hotel! Colazione: inesistente. Capisco che arrivare alle 9,45 possa dare fastidio ai camerieri di sala, ma NON TROVARE NULLA, dico nulla da mangiare in un 5 stelle è inaccettabile. Di conseguenza abbiamo optato per ordini a la carte e abbiamo scelto delle uova benedict (ovvero in camicia su pane tostato) con salmone o spinaci e la risposta è stata questa: ""abbiamo appena aperto e non siamo equipaggiati per questo tipo di ordine"". Ora mi chiedo. quali ""equipment"" ci vogliono per fare delle uova in camicia? Probabilmente anche allo chef disturbava cucinare alle 9,45 del mattino, quando la colazione stava per terminare....  Infine la SPA. Cartelli dappertutto segnalando che la SPA (come giusto che sia) è un luogo silenzioso di benessere e pertanto si richiede il rispetto di queste regole. Peccato che all'entrata della SPA non abbiamo mai incontrato nessuno che potesse far rispettare queste regole e come risultante la piscina riscaldata era stata trasformata nella ""spiaggia"" di famiglie con bambini (nelle SPA che ho frequentato in varie parti del mondo i bambini non posso nemmeno entrare proprio per rispettare la tranquillità dello spazio SPA), bambini piccoli che urlavano a squarciagola, bambini con i pannolini (sporchi) dentro la piscina, che entravano e uscivano dal solarium o che si tuffavano in continuazione su benestare dei genitori al seguito. Senza parole. Lo spazio della SPA inoltre è molto piccolo e quindi ogni tipo di schiamazzo si sentiva dappertutto. Meritano tuttavia parole di grande professionalità e abilità le professioniste dell'area massaggi dove abbiamo apprezzato molto il tempo trascorso nel rituale. Peccato perchè avrebbe potuto essere una mini vacanza indimenticabile.",2,2022,06,20

Qualche piccola incomprensione con il personale poi gentilmente risolta. Bilancio molto positivo. Grazie!",5,2022,06,06
09,Luci e ombre,"Camera gradevole in legno e pietra, non mi piacciono i corridoi, a tratti inquietanti, «shining style». La colazione ha un buffet incluso e alcuni piatti a pagamento, una cosa che non apprezzo. Cena accettabile ma nulla di straordinario (le melanzane alla parmigiana in Valle d’Aosta?), servizio pessimo, non all’altezza di un cinque stelle. Nell’insieme il giudizio non è negativo ma troppo “standard”.",3,2022,05,08

09,Non all’altezza di un 4 stelle,"Premesso che l’addetta alla spa e il cameriere del bar sono gentilissimi è che la spa è molto bella, questo Hotel a 4 stelle ne merita forse due. L’albergo è vecchio, ci hanno dato una camera microscopica e soffocante, il riscaldamento non si poteva abbassare, i materassi erano durissimi, il telefono della stanza non funzionava, il divano era inutilizzabile visto che era incastrato sotto il tetto spiovente, la doccia aveva la tenda e un soffione non degno di questo nome… tutto segnalato alla reception all’arrivo con richiesta di cambio stanza ma ignorato totalmente; la cosa più grave comunque è che al ristorante molto affollato il maitre indossava la mascherina molla che non copriva il naso e discuteva con i camerieri, cosa mai vista in un hotel a 4 stelle. Mai più.",3,2022,01,09
09,"Un buon albergo, migliorabile","La premessa d'obbligo è, naturalmente, che si tratta di un cinque stelle dal quale, naturalmente, ci si aspetta qualità di livello.
La struttura è situata molto vicino al centro storico, che si raggiunge in 5 minuti a piedi; disponibile un ampio garage.
Architettura ed arredamento moderno, ben inserito nel contesto; buona la vista sulle montagne circostanti.
Al nostro arrivo ci viene offerto un upgrade gratuito, ovviamente molto gradito e veniamo conseguentemente accompagnati in un stanza veramente molto ampia; calda, ben arredata, con un balcone godibile.
Considerata la camera ( di quasi 40 mq) avrei preferito disporre di un TV (presente davanti al letto), anche nella zona salotto; incomprensibile il posizionamento di alcuni interruttori, come quello della cabina armadio, distante dall'accesso e che accende contestualmente anche la zona salotto.
Camera ben insonorizzata. Linea internet lentissima.
Consegnata incomprensibilmente una sola scheda di accesso.
Ampia la spa, nella quale tuttavia sarebbe opportuno un maggior controllo, in quanto come purtroppo spesso accade, alcuni ospiti non rispettano le regole (come le limitazioni di accesso alla sauna, causa covid).
Personale cordiale ma, troppo spesso, del tutto impreparato, forse per la (media) giovane età. L'addetta alla reception che non sapeva dove si trovasse la spa; un addetto al bar che ti dà del ""tu"" e che versa una quantità di rhum pari ad un sorso (letteralmente) per 12 euro o che porta una grappa al divano, con il bicchiere già riempito in mano (invece che bicchiere e bottiglia su un vassoio per poi versare in presenza del cliente); ecc.
Nulla di grave o imperdonabile, ma in un cinque stelle non è certamente opportuno, nonostante l'indubbia cordialità e disponibilità; manca, insomma, un pò di formazione.
Ci siamo trovati bene ed abbiamo gradito il soggiorno e proprio per questo è giusto sottolineare aspetti ampiamente migliorabili.
Colazione a buffet completa, almeno per i nostri gusti.
Pulizia ottima, così come il rifacimento della camera giornaliera.
Prezzi coerenti con l'offerta.",4,2021,12,26
09,Super consigliato!,"Non alloggiamo in hotel perchè abbiamo la casa vicino alla struttura.

Esperienza molto positiva!",4,2021,12,26
09,"Personale Pessimo,  da evitare","Esperienza pessima, arrivo con la mia famiglia alle 22, via telefono ci garantiscono una cena, ma all arrivo, ne il bar ne il  ristorante dell hotel sono disposti a servirci, dopo aver insistito ci danno 4 piatti con mozzarella, 3 fette di prosciutto e 4 calici di rosso (consigliati da loro )  speso 170€, prezzo fuori di testa😅 considerando che eravamo anche ospiti dell hotel per ben 2 notti con 2 camere. 
Personale scortese; sia durante il check in che durante il check out non ci hanno accolto e nemmeno salutato, guardavano in basso, come per evitare il nostro sguardo. 

Considerando che un 5 stelle dovrebbe servirti a qualsiasi ora del giorno. Che tristezza. 

Hotel tutto sommato Bello. Spa grande e parcheggio comodo, camere pulite e moderne 

Il cameriere Sardo e la segretaria in spa sono gli unici cortesi ed educati.

09,Una certezza,Premetto che viaggio molto spesso unitamente a mio marito in hotel di questo livello e devo complimentarmi con lo staff diretto dal Sig. Alessandro Urru molto professionale e gentile. La spa é ben organizzata e la piscina accogliente con acqua calda al punto di invogliarmi ad entrare senza fare le mie solite scenette perchè sono freddolosa. Il cucinato è ottimo ed a livello della struttura. Il rapporto qualità prezzo è rispettato e le camere di design molto accoglienti. Cosa si vuole di piu?😊,5,2021,11,02
09,Bene ma non benissimo...,"Sulla struttura niente da ridire...davvero molto bella e perfettamente inserita nel contesto. Parcheggio comodo, personale gentile, tutto pulitissimo, vista spettacolare.
Il mio punteggio si abbassa però per queste voci:
- la spa: è molto carina ma...l'acqua era fredda! Poco più calda di quella di una piscina, questo non me lo aspettavo...le spa hanno sempre temperature sui 37-38 °C, qui era segnata a 33 °C e in effetti non mi ha scaldata, sono corsa nella sauna per cercare calore!
- il ristorante: non ho mai mangiato così poco in vita mia! Cervo e polenta in porzioni da scuola materna praticamente... peccato perché era buono, ma assurdo considerando la folle cifra spesa per uscire da lì affamati! Mi spiace non aver fatto una foto a testimonianza: tre forchettate e il piatto era finito. 
- attenzione Covid: alla reception mi sono trovata davanti una cliente francese senza mascherina. Nessuno le ha detto nulla: lei ha chiesto ciò di cui aveva bisogno alla receptionist e se n'è andata in giro in tranquillità per tutta la hall. Il cliente non ha sempre ragione, qui l'intervento era dovuto e legittimo!
Ci tengo a sottolineare che l'esperienza nel complesso è stata buona e spero che le mie osservazioni possano solo essere spunti di miglioramento: il potenziale è altissimo e non va vanificato, tutto qui.

Camera pulita ma con i muri sporchi (vedi foto) una gestione delle colazioni (fortunatamente pranzo e cena fatti fuori) a dir poco RIDICOLA!!!!

Ciliegina sulla torna oggi prima di nudare via volevamo mangiare delle patatine…in camera…ma che - ahimè - erano scadute da qualche giorno (da causa legale!!!).

-qualunque tipo di uovo o spremuta a pagamento e’ inaccettabile da un hotel di questo tipo
-la cena con solo due opzioni per portata mi sembra poco, mi aspettavo di più 
-“minacciare” l’addebito di 10 euro in caso di perdita della chiave/tessera di plastica mi sembra un po’ eccessivo

Un grazie sincero a tutti voi per le bellissime settimane passate e insieme!!! Ci vediamo il 17 luglio 2022!",5,2021,07,25
09,Bellissimo,"Fantastica struttura che riprende in forma moderna lo stile di uno chalet di montagna.
Sale comuni e ristorante panoramicissime, dove c’è sempre il dominio della vista della montagna.
Camere molto confortevoli, dotate ti ogni confort e con un bellissimo balcone.

09,Meraviglioso,"Abbiamo festeggiato il matrimonio di nostra figlia in questa meravigliosa struttura, non finiremo mai di ringraziare di cuore tutto lo staff per l’accoglienza, la professionalità, la gentilezza, la cura e l’amore che hanno dedicato a tutti noi . Tutte le portate erano squisite, complimenti allo chef e a tutta la brigata, camere bellissime e pulitissime.Il maitre e il direttore meritano un applauso per la loro serietà e professionalità. Super consigliato 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",5,2021,07,20
09,La giornata più bella della nostra vita ,"Ci siamo innamorati di questa struttura e del suo direttore il giorno stesso in cui siamo andati per chiedere informazioni per il nostro matrimonio. Abbiamo dovuto rinviare di un anno causa covid e Alex il direttore è stato disponibile fin da subito. 
La giornata è stata bellissima, lo staff unico, dalla reception ai ragazzi che ci hanno servito ai tavoli, al maitre. I nostri complimenti continuano per lo staff della cucina, lo chef gentilissimo ci ha deliziato con mille prelibatezze. 
Alex é stato disponibilissimo in tutto e per tutto accompagnandoci in ogni scelta. 
Tutti i nostri ospiti, dai più giovani ai più anziani ci hanno fatto i complimenti per la location, per il buon cibo e non da meno per la professionalità e gentilezza di TUTTO lo staff.
Sappiamo bene che un matrimonio può essere motivo di lamentela da parte di altri ospiti, ma per quanto riguarda noi non possiamo che ringraziare TUTTI.
Dovessimo risposarci oggi stesso non avremmo dubbi su quale lovation scegliere per festeggiare il nostro amore.
Ancora grazie a tutto lo staff.
Giulia e Christian! ",5,2021,07,20
09,Il castello delle cerimonie,"Purtroppo la presenza dei turisti in questo periodo è al di sotto della media di stagione, ma per noi è chiaramente meglio così. Il sole è caldo, l’aria fresca.  La cornice naturale impareggiabile. Stanchi, al rientro dopo una lunga escursione, nulla potrà rovinare i tanti ricercati e pagati relax e quiete, tranne un lungo e chiassoso matrimonio che occupa la meravigliosa terrazza dell’hotel. Allora ci si potrebbe spostare nella spa…ma la rumorosissima disco e l’immancabile: bacio! Bacio! Bacio! Arrivano anche lì. 
Avrei apprezzato essere avvisata quando ho prenotato.
La stanza bella e pulita. Lo staff gentile. Ai servizi mancano almeno un paio di stelle.",2,2021,07,18
09,Ai piedi del paradiso,"Abbiamo avuto il piacere di trascorrere qualche giorno nella bellissima cittadina di Courmayeur scegliendo il Grand Hotel come sistemazione. La posizione della struttura è incantevole. Dal balcone potevamo ammirare il Monte Bianco da una prospettiva privilegiata e già solo per questo vale la pena prenotare presso questo albergo.
 
Le camere sono confortevoli, spaziose e accattivanti. Il livello di pulizia risulta assolutamente soddisfacenti. 

Abbiamo cenato presso il ristorante dell’albergo “La Fourchette” e la qualità del servizio, grazie in particolare al direttore di sala molto attento e capace, ci è sembrato in linea con gli standard di un cinque stelle. Anche per quanto concerne il servizio in camera la nostra esperienza è stata positiva. 

Una considerazione doverosa concerne la particolare gentilezza e disponibilità dello staff in generale (con particolare riferimento alla reception e al direttore di sala), ma anche degli stessi cittadini di Courmayeur che ci hanno ammaliato con la loro  capacità di far sentire il visitatore completamente a proprio agio, lasciando nei nostri cuori una grande voglia di tornare.",5,2021,07,15
09,Sevizio basico ,"Abbiamo passato 2 notti in 3. Il divano letto con le molle sulla schiena. Hanno cambiato dopo proteste. Spa minima e colazione basica x un 5 stelle. Ristorante qualità prezzo insufficiente. Sconsigliato

",3,2021,02,21
09,Bellissimo ,"Old fashioned top! Bravissimo Il barman. 

Il resto tutto perfetto, dal cibo alla camera. 

Ottima anche la spa, peccato non fosse completamente agibile per via delle norme anti covid!

Un bellissima esperienza!",4,2021,02,13
09,Hotel di classe e personale qualificato,"Sabato 24 gennaio  mi trovavo a Courmayeur per incontrare alcuni clienti e non essendoci moto da fare in giro, chiedendo consiglio a alcuni amici mi hanno suggerito di visitare Il grand Hotel Courmayeur, appena arrivato sono stato accolto dallo staff in maniera molto disponibile, anche no. essendo un cliente della struttura.
Che dire veduta fantastica sul monte bianco e pranzo eccellente anche grazie ai suggerimenti del bartender, Gianluca ragazzo preparato e gentile, mi ha consigliato una bottiglia di vino rosso Valdostano.
Consigliatissimo",5,2021,01,28
09,Siamo “quasi” al top,"Premesso che siamo sotto covid, che siamo a Courmayer dove ti aspetti tanto, che l’hotel ha praticamente aperto per noi, che sono stati gentilissimi a farci un upgrade gratis dantoci la junior suite al costo della camera e che tutti erano cortesi al massimo visto che ci hanno concesso di rimanere fino alle 15 del giorno di uscita (un plus alla signorina siciliana bionda con gli occhiali molto brava e gentile). E che va detto in ogni caso che eravamo pochissimi in albergo dato il periodo...
Comunque, premesso tutto questo suggerisco due o tre cose semplici che un 5 stelle dovrebbe sempre dare: innanzitutto un pizzico di atmosfera in più. C’è un che di appena fatto, nuovo e super tech a cui manca qualcosa. Un pezzo antico, che so un tappeto più spesso, o al contrario un tono forte in camera. Nella nostra c’era una stampa di Gesù e dei ladroni di una tristezza per qualità e dimensioni...inguardabile. 
A cena menu semplificato dato il numero delle persone - il che ci sta - ma le mezze bottiglie non possono essere 2 per il bianco e 2 per il rosso. Ho capito che ce n’è meno varietà, ma se uno ha la compagna astemia mica può sbronzarsi...
Al nostro arrivo la camera era un po’ fredda come temperatura. Per accelerare il riscaldamento ci hanno dato un fungo: ok grazie ma perché non l’avete messo prima? La colazione al mattino in camera una delizia - anche se con un paio di cose da tre stelle - ma entrambe le mattine i tovaglioli non c’erano o meglio ce n’era sempre solo uno. Sono così rari? 
Nella mia esperienza i 5 stelle meritano fama quando sanno anticipare le esigenze del cliente non solo quando hanno a disposizione ciò che i clienti si aspettano. La differenza sta lì. Qui c’è (quasi) tutto ma bisogna a volte chiederlo.
In ogni caso siamo (quasi) al top.
Manca poco da, buon 
lavoro! ",4,2021,01,17
09,Gran bel ricevimento!!!,"Sono stato presso la struttura per un ricevimento di nozze...
Struttura veramente ampia, bella e curata in ogni dettaglio, molto pulita e di un livello superiore.
Il pranzo,e la festa in generale, è stato superlativo, ottimo cibo e personale veramente impeccabile!!!",5,2020,10,04
09,Soggiorno da sogno ,Impeccabile in tutto. Stanza ampia con vista su pascoli e montagne. Arredamento moderno con stile alpino. Letto alto e comodissimo. Zona spa ben curata. Colazione varia. Personale molto cortese e professionale. Ci torneremo sicuramente. ,5,2020,09,09
09,"Bell’hotel, servizi non da 5 stelle","Partirei dalle note positive: ottima posizione, stile moderno ma in linea con il contesto montano e personale cordialissimo (in particolare Margherita in stage).
Parto dal presupposto che stiamo parlando di un 5 stelle e di conseguenza le aspettative sono altissime; tuttavia ho rilevato dei notevoli limiti sui servizi: -assenza di fatto di un servizio di concierge adeguato al livello dell’hotel
-colazione decisamente non all’altezza con una ridottissima scelta, con particolare riferimento alla presenza di prodotti locali (pur considerando le limitazioni Covid)
- camera non rifatta in serata (prima della notte - un servizio che ho sempre trovato nei 5 stelle)
- mi è stato chiesto di portare io la macchina in garage (mai visto in un 5 stelle).

Pur considerando le note negative abbiamo passato un buon soggiorno; si può fare molto di più però!",4,2020,09,06
09,Non un hotel a 5 stelle! Attenzione!,"I prezzi sono da 5 stelle, ma i servizi assolutamente no! Quindi se avete i soldi per trascorrere una notte lì, cercate altro, in giro c'è di meglio! Non c'è nessuna 'chicca' degna delle 5 stelle. Non un bicchiere d'acqua di benvenuto, nulla di carino in camera. Personale formaĺe, ma non gentile. Ci siamo sentiti ospiti invisibili, non che a noi interessasse visibilità, ma lo dico in nome di quelle 5 stelle impropriamente impresse all'ingresso dell'hotel! La ns camera valeva euro 150/180, non 260! SPA come molte altre di hotel a classificazione inferiore. Regole Covid: nessuno ci ha misurato la temperatura in fase di check in, nè abbiamo compilato alcun foglio di pretriage clinico! Inoltre, dopo l'uso della SPA ho utilizzato la stanza fitness x una mezz'oretta di esercizi, non c'era nessuno nè quando sono entrata nè all'uscita. Per mio buon senso ho igienizzato io il tapis roulant che avevo usato, adoperando il gel per le mani che era all'ingresso..perchè non volevo che nessuno risalisse sul tapis roulant dove io avevo sudato parecchio. Un hotel a 5 stelle non può permettersi una tale mancanza!",3,2020,09,06
09,SEI BELLISSIMO ANCHE SOTTO LA PIOGGIA!,"Location vivamente consigliata: precedente soggiorno sotto la neve fitta dicembre 2019,  scorso week end con pioggerella instancabile! L'hotel si trova ai piedi del Monte Bianco e con una piccola passeggiata di 10' si raggiunge la promenade affollatissima da turisti in ricerca di shopping sfrenato! Alla reception la gentilissima Margherita (stagista) è stata preziosissima nella sua gentilezza e professionalità. Colazione logicamente ridimensionata per proposta e staff causa covid, menu del ristorante molto variegato e cena ottima, vino incluso. Room super super super con cabina armadio da Sara J.P.! Ps: al management potrei consigliare una maggiore attenzione alla concierge ed un ridimensionamento dell'esposizione sculture lungo tutti i corridoi.Grazie per il favoloso week end!",4,2020,08,31
09,Splendida cista,"Bellissimo hotel con vista panoramica sul monte Bianco.
Camera molto pulita e silenziosa. Personale molto gentile e preparato ( es addetto al bar molto competente sui diversi tipi di gin ).
Colazione abbondante a buffet nonostante le limitazioni imposte dal Covid 19.

09,Aperitivo serale,Da esterno son passato una sera per un aperitivo..hotel accogliente.. Aperitivo ottimo.. Bar manager Daniel super accogliente e professionale.. Stuzzichini ottimi e cocktail buoni..lo consiglierei.. Consiglieri per i cocktailmm,5,2020,08,19
09,Ottima esperienza: giusto qualche dettaglio da sistenare,"COSA MI È PIACIUTO 
- il design dell’hotel con un perfetto mix tra modernità e tradizione
- la camera molto spaziosa, elegante e con una vista spettacolare sul Monte Bianco
- la Spa davvero completa e ben fatta ( la sauna ha una parete in vetro da cui si ammira il panorama montano) 
- personale molto gentile e premuroso
- la possibilità di parcheggiare l’auto 

COSA NON MI È PIACIUTO
- la colazione l’ho trovata troppo standard per i miei gusti (yogurt, croissant, uova e bacon, etc): avrei preferito un tocco più personale e maggiore focus sul territorio valdostano  
- Prezzi del ristorante un po’ cari (12 € per una tartelletta dolce)
- l’hotel pur essendo molto vicino al centro, si trova in cima ad una collinetta: un extra “trekking” - breve ma con una buona pendenza- che abbiamo sentito, soprattutto a fine giornata 

Da tornare? SI",5,2020,08,10
09,Cornice stupenda per l’anniversario,"È la seconda volta che soggiorniamo in questa struttura e anche se questa volta ci siamo fermati solo una notte, ci è sembrato molto di più. 
Il personale coccola il cliente, c’è un attenzione particolare nella disposizione degli oggetti e dei complementi d’arredo. 
Nonostante il periodo post Covid, non si osservano particolari ostacoli nel piacere del soggiorno. 
Consigliato l’aperitivo in terrazza con vista: ottimi cocktails e snacks.
Ottima anche la colazione (buffet servito) con prodotti della zona.
Non vediamo l’ora di tornare e vivere ancora un po’ di coccola!!",5,2020,07,28
09,Bello,"Siamo stati I questo splendido posto, accoglienza assolutamente eccezionale, in linea con i servizi dell'albergo, però... Per i prezzi delle camere, a mio modesto parere, andrebbero assolutamente rimodernare, soprattutto i bagni, e inoltre andrebbe assolutamente ristrutturata la Spa... Colazione eccellente!",4,2020,02,01

09,Bisogna migliorare…,"Ho prenotato alle 16.30 un tavolo al ristorante per 5 persone. Mi sono presentato all’ orario convenuto e ho aspettato un ora prima di avere il tavolo . Il personale mi ha servito dopo un altra mezz’ora 

Imbarazzante e senza parole.",1,2020,01,05
09,Bella atmosfera.....,"Siamo stati ieri sera per il Cenacolo di Artom , siamo stati molto bene . Ottimo aperitivo . Cena ottima con servizio impeccabile . Struttura modernissima con molte vetrate . È un’ottima location che consiglio .",5,2019,12,28
09,NON CI SIAMO ,"Abbiamo soggiornato qui la notte del 21 dicembre. Non ci è stato possibile usufruire del ristorante e del bar perché era tutto occupato da un matrimonio. Nessuno però ci ha avvisati al momento della prenotazione. La qualità e la varietà della colazione non è all’altezza di un 5 stelle, ho chiesto del latte parzialmente scremato e non c’era....fate voi. Al check out ci è stato addebitato il costo del garage che avevamo esplicitamente detto durante il check in di non volere utilizzare. In un 5 stelle tutto questo è inaccettabile.",3,2019,12,22
09,Una buona esperienza,"Siamo stati con i bimbi ( 2 anni e 1/2 e 3 mesi ) e la tata, abbiamo soggiornato nella Grand suite Mont Blanc, la soluzione più ampia possibile.
Comincio nel dire che l’hotel offre spazi molto ampi all’interno, come il bar, la terrazza o la hall, cosa non di poca importanza per chi come noi deve gestire un bimbo piccolo che difficilmente si riesce a tenere in stanza. 
Preciso che ha piovuto durante tutto il soggiorno.
Le camere sono in stile moderno, con un leggero richiamo all’arredamento tipico valdostano. 
La Spa è raggiungibile comodamente dall’interno dell’hotel, cosa non comune a Courmayeur, è fruibile anche dai bimbi più piccoli, purché ovviamente si attengano alle regole della stessa. La temperatura della piscina è di circa 30/32 gradi, presenti anche docce emozionali e ovviamente sauna e bagno turco.
Nota molto positiva la possibilità di riservare a tempo la spa ad uso privato, concesso a noi in forma gratuita, grazie anche alla quasi totale assenza di altri clienti visto il periodo ancora molto tranquillo.
La colazione è ricca e ben assortita.
Ho apprezzato molto che mi sia stato offerto un upgrade gratuito al momento della prenotazione, salvo poi vederlo addebitato al momento del check out, è stato necessario fare uno storno, nulla di grave, ma comunque un neo sull’esperienza.
Nelle camere mi piacerebbe aver trovato un minibar più ricco, anche se con la tariffa premium era tutto compreso, avremmo preferito avere più scelta, anche a pagamento.
Credo però che l’hotel sia sotto la media per essere un 5 stelle, di cui offre i servizi ma non la cura e la dedizione al cliente tipica degli altri 5 stelle visitati a Courmayeur. 
Complice probabilmente l’età giovane del personale che, è si attento alle esigenze, ma manca dell’esperienza necessaria a cogliere quelle sfumature che per noi clienti fanno la differenza!
In linea di massima siamo soddisfatti ma crediamo che sia più giusto definire questo hotel un 4 stelle Lusso. 
Manca quell’attenzione ai piccoli dettagli che per chi come noi spende 800€ a notte fa davvero tanta differenza. 
Di livello da 5 stelle sicuramente il bar ed il suo barman, preparato, attento e molto molto attento. 
Grazie 
",3,2019,12,18
09,Comfort a 5 stelle,"Weekend breve nella festività dei santi, io mio marito e mia figlia adolescente. Scelto il mont blanc perché ci piace andare in strutture di livello. Aspettativa assolutamente soddisfatta. Hotel appena fuori dal passeggio della via principale, parcheggio comodo sia esterno che al coperto, in 5 minuti a piedi si è in centro di Courmayeur.  La camera spaziosa con due ampie camere da letto, bagno e armadi enormi, arredi curati con materiali e finiture di pregio. La nostra, la B106 con affaccio sul prato con uno spazioso esterno. La spa gradevole, dotata di tutto il necessario, pulita e accogliente. Proprio a fianco alla spa una mini palestra con tutto il necessario per allenarsi. Colazione al primo piano in ampio salone arredato con stile e armonia, molto ricca e personale gentile e disponibile.  Il ristorante purtroppo non era in funzione e non posso dare un giudizio. In conclusione piacevole soggiorno assolutamente da ripetere, il prezzo della Camera è alto ma la qualità e il comfort a questi liveĺli si pagano volentieri.  ",5,2019,11,07

09,Dog-friendly ed incredibilmente eccezionali!,"Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo deciso di fare un fine settimana a Courmayeur, optando per quello che veniva consigliato anche il miglior alloggio in termini di accoglienza per animali. Vicinissimo al centro, con parcheggio sorvegliato - che non è cosa da poco notando la scarsità di parcheggi in centro. Staff cordialissimo, anche nei confronti del nostro cagnolino. Sempre sorridenti e disponibili a renderti il tuo soggiorno piacevole e indimenticabile.

In particolare, volevamo ringraziare una ragazza della reception che ha fatto il turno della mattina con gli occhiali e i capelli lunghi (non abbiamo chiesto il nome) per l'estrema professionalità e gentilezza. Essere accolti così, fa sempre molto piacere. Brava!!

Camera Junior Suite, consigliabilissima! Spaziosa, con bagno con vasca grande e doccia, camera armadio. Letto comodissimo e sempre caldo - che dopo giornate di trekking al freddo, è sempre bello ritrovarsi la camera calda e accogliente.

Servizio pulizie, due volte al giorno, sempre asciugamani puliti.

Ragazzi della sala colazioni carinissimi! Anche loro sempre attenti a soddisfare qualsiasi propria esigenza (io sono celiaca e mi hanno sempre portato da mangiare biscotti, pane, grissini etcect.).

Insomma, weekend indimenticabile. Grazie! Ci vedremo presto.",5,2019,11,03

Mi aspettano meglio dalla spa, tutta interna, non assolata e senza vista sul Monte Bianco, che, considerata la posizione dell’albergo, deve essere un fatto studiato (...) ma impiegabile,

Il mio ragazzo aveva perso una sciarpa MonClair ritrovata una manciata di minuti dopo dallo stesso, che con enorme premura aveva fatto smuovere mezzo albergo nel tentativo di ritrovarla.

Svegliarsi al mattino con il saluto delle cime innevate e luminose del Monte Bianco, confortati dalle golose proposte del pasticcere e dello chef è un piacere impagabile. 
La posizione dell'hotel è magnifica e strategica, a pochi passi dal centro e a pochi minuti di bus o auto da...tutto. Escursioni e attività di team building organizzate nei dintorni, general meeting, cene e festa di gala in hotel, con la collaborazione e la professionalità di tutto il personale. Dalla reception, al ristorante e al servizio in sala gentilezza e attenzione al cliente sono imprescindibili. Professionalità e collaborazione illimitate. Ottime le proposte dello Chef per le cene servite e i buffet, con presentazioni coreografiche davvero curate e armoniose. Il pasticcere non manca di sorprendere con proposte golose e intriganti. Ristorante La Fourchette di alto livello con varietà di proposte e pronto a rispondere a tutte le scelte o esigenzde alimentari. Bellissime le camere, ampie e in stile di montagna moderno e di lusso, architettura di design, ottimi materiali. In questo hotel il culto del bello e dello stare bene è al centro dell'attenzione del direttore e di tutto il suo staff. Per un lusso 'bello' e accogliente, lo spirito dell'hotel è far sentire a casa propri gli ospiti...e ci riescono benissimo. La SPA è un 'on top', piccolina ma curata. Per fortuna regolamentata da prenotazioni, altrimenti sarebbe impraticabile. Unica pecca: la piscina, acqua fredda e idromassaggio sottotono.",5,2018,12,27
09,se volete sognare soggiornate qui!!!,"Ho soggiornato per la prima volta a Courmayeur in questa struttura moderna, completa di ogni comfort.
Sin dalla prenotazione il direttore Alessandro è stato disponibile ed ha accontentato ogni nostra richiesta.
Consiglio di prenotare una Suite Signature, una delle stanze più belle della struttura, ma tutte hanno la loro magia.
Lo staff è preparato, cordiale, rapido.
Insomma un weekend indimenticabile.
Consiglio fortemente questa struttura.

09,Una stella di troppo ,"Posizione buona e albergo bello e nuovo per il resto il servizio a mio parere non è da 5 stelle, vado a motivare.
-Spa da prenotare... passiamo la vita a prenotare e a fare code che almeno in vacanza non desidero dover aver orari w dover prenotare l’accesso ad un area relax, non esiste proprio . Una volta entrato capisco che in un albergo così grande la spa è troppo piccola, con poche sedie a sdraio ed in più con accesso ad esterni (a 40€ a persona, forse per questo gli ospiti devono prenotare)
- personale non  all’altezza di un 5 stelle, molti stranieri con difficoltà di lingua è poco preparati nel servire la colazione e nell’accoglienza clienti, chiedo un coltello assente per tagliare del formaggio brie ed un cameriere dopo aver tentato di prendere il formaggio con le pinze senza risultato lo prende con le mani e po porta in cucina per tagliarli , robe da matti
- mai trovato un hotel a 5 stelle che ti fa pagare il parcheggio coperto
- mai trovato un hotel 5 stelle che all’arrivo ti fa addirittura firmare un foglietto con scritto che se perdo la keycard per aprire la porta della camera mi saranno addebitati 20€ ( ridicolo!!! Ma a chi volete che importino 10€ se si spende 400€ a notte??? Fate solo una pessima figura)
-Spa Piccola e scarsa di attrezzature 
Peccato perché la struttura è bella ed accogliente, dedicassero più tempo al Customer service anziché all’esposizione di gioielli e opere d’arte farebbero un grande affare.
Non ci tornerò ",3,2018,12,10

09,"Überteuertes Grand Hotel, welches seinem Namen nicht gerecht wird","Das Grand Hotel Courmayeur ist ein relativ neu gebautes Hotel, welches sich auf 3 Gebäudekomplexe unterteilt. Die Orientierung und die entsprechende Zimmer-Suche ist mangels Querverbindungen katastrophal. Rezeption im Erdgeschoß des Mittelgebäudes, Bar und Frühstücksraum im 1. Stock und Restaurant im 2. Stock. Die Architektur des Gebäudes ist zurückhaltend, was dem Komplex sehr gut steht. Das Innere inkl. der Zimmer ist im ""neuen"" alpinen Einheitslook gestaltet - leider wurde vergessen, das gesamte Haus mit Charme und Gemütlichkeit auszustatten. Die Bar im ersten Stock ist zweckmäßig und man sieht abends in das abgedunkelte und teilweise schon mit abgedeckten Speisen versehene Frühstücks-""Abteil"". Das Restaurant im 2. Stock ist ein typischer italienischer Speisesaal  - keine Abtrennungen, geschweige denn alpenländisches Flair.
Die Qualität der Küche ist unterdurchschnittlich und somit keinesfalls eines 5-Sterne-Hotels würdig. Die Getränkepreise sind weit überdurchschnittlich. Der Service und die Atmosphäre rechtfertigen dies keinesfalls.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist ordentlich, der Service auch hier unterdurchschnittlich. Wir saßen an einem wackeligen Tisch, wodurch der Kaffee aus unseren Tassen schwappte. Wir wechselten den Tisch und wiesen das Personal auf die Unbrauchbarkeit des Tisches hin. Man wollte sich darum kümmern, doch nichts geschah. Nachfolgende Gäste erlebten dasselbe Desaster.........

Die Zimmer sind relativ groß, die Bäder mit einer sehr großen Dusche ausgestattet. Leider ist die Beleuchtung (Innenbad) katastrophal (keine ausreichende Beleuchtung zum Schminken). Der Vergrößerungsspiegel ist viel zu niedrig angebracht und leider nicht hinterleuchtet. Die Auswahl an Pflegeprodukten ist hervorragend. Ein Haarföhn fehlte komplett. Die Betten/Matratzen waren sehr, sehr komfortabel.",3,2018,12,02

09,Moderno e stiloso. Perfetto.,"Chi l'ha detto che in montagna debba prevalere uno stile classico-tradizionale? Questo nuovo cinque stelle incarna perfettamente lo spirito contemporaneo ormai predominante nelle destinazioni alpine più all'avanguardia aggiungendo all'offerta alberghiera di Courmayeur un tocco di internazionalità di cui si sentiva il bisogno. Il design è moderno ma caldo e gli spazi sono organizzati in modo davvero ""pensato"" e razionale. Tutto è nuovo e progettato in modo da offrire al cliente un'esperienza rilassante, gratificante e difficile da dimenticare. Si trova appena fuori dall'abitato (5 minuti a piedi attraversando un bel parchetto) in posizione comoda da raggiongere in auto e molto tranquilla. Gli spazi comuni sono ampi e luminosi, le camere eleganti e confortevoli: sala da bagno con vasca idromassaggio e doccia molto ampia. Guardaroba organizzatissimo ed un ampia terrazza. Letto comodissimo con biancheria di alta qualità. Ottima la colazione sia come offerta di cibo che come spazio panoramico in cui viene servita. Servizio cortese ed efficiente, estremamente collaborativo. Non sono riuscito a provare la SPA. Una nota di merito per l'ottimo barman. Che dire? Il top, secondo me.",5,2018,09,20

L'atmosfera che si crea all'interno di questa struttura è proprio quella che desideravo di un mix tra uno chalet di montagna e un albergo con ogni comfort.

Ho soggiornato qui nel ponte dell'Immacolata, e dalla camera magnifica, alla colazione davvero superba, al barman competente e capace di relazionarsi e discorrere, alla spa invitante, al ristorante delizioso, io non ho trovato nulla che potessi perfezionare. Dal mio magnifico letto ammiravo sulla mia terrazza scendere le neve ogni mattina e mi pareva di stare in una fiaba...Sono rientrato confortato, riposato, deliziato dalle attenzioni e dalle cure che il personale mi ha destinato.

Gli spazi, il comfort delle aree comuni e delle camere ampie e moderne, la tranquillità che si respira e nella quale viene immediato immergersi. La cucina è varia, i piatti sono beli e soprattutto buonissimi (chef e pasticcere top), e un ringraziamento speciale deo farlo al personale: Marina, Marta, Alessandro... tutti, dall'accoglienza al servizio in camera alla spa al bar, sono stati capaci di farci sentire ""a casa"".

09,Splendido esempio di gusto e ospitalità italiana,"Hotel moderno ma in stile, ampi spazi, vetrate che fanno entrare tutta la luce e i colori della bella valle sul mont blanc. Le stanze sono ampie, luminose, sui toni dell'ecru. Il bel legno delle pareti e degli armadi scalda con eleganza, le poltroncine rosse creano l'ambiente perfetto.
Due ambienti per mangiare, per la colazione e il pranzo il primo piano, la cena è ancor più up!
La forza della struttura risiede però nell'accoglienza, nello staff garbato, professionale, e sollecito. Devo dire che, rispetto allo stile valdostano (piuttosto tranchant  nella mia esperienza ), qui si respira grande armonia e senso di ""casa"".

Se proprio dovessi trovare una piccola pecca al servizio potrei dire che nell'offerta che abbiamo acquistato vi era il cocktail di benvenuto che non ci è stato proposto ma insomma, è poca cosa.
La spa è piccolina ma pulita, nel complesso è stato un soggiorno molto piacevole.",4,2018,02,06

09,Weekend da sogno!!,"Sono stata a Courmayeur in occasione di un weekend con il mio ragazzo per sciare. Abbiamo scelto questo albergo per l’aspetto nuovo e moderno, e per il fatto che si potessero già noleggiare gli sci da loro. Inoltre il personale già al telefono si è dimostrato disponibile per a soddisfare le nostre esigenze. Siamo veramente contenti della nostra scelta perché abbiamo passato un fine settimana diverso dal solito, godendoci le piste da sci con il bel tempo, e l’unico giorno in cui ha piovuto un po’ siamo stati al centro benessere. Peccato che non ci fosse più posto per fare dei massaggi, ma avremmo dovuto pensarci prima. Consigliatissimo per chi desidera trascorrere dei giorni non nel solito albergo in stile montano!",5,2018,02,04

09,Una lussuosa e moderna sosta ,"Bellissima e moderna location, un 5 stelle nuovo e un bravo studio di architettura  a progettarlo. Gentile il personale w ottima la colazione, peccato piccole pecche migliorabili in velocità:
- a pagamento il parcheggio coperto..dopo che la Camera ha già un costo e lo spazio del garage è ampio;
-zero giornali o quotidiani italiani o internazionali;
- zero cartine o info su Courmayeur a libera disposizione del cliente ..insomma..reception da rendere più coinvolgente;
- una spa nuova ma piccola..piscina con idro, sauna e bagno turco..migliorabili con profumi e con musica soft...un pacchetto massaggi ridotto (v. Adler hotel come competitor).

09,Evento super organizzato,"Sono stata in questo Hotel per l'evento Ferrari Novembre 2016, la cosa che mi ha colpito di più è stata l'organizzazione dello staff, tutto è stato perfetto. eventi del genere sono speciali, come lo è il Grand Hotel Mont Blanc, bravi ragazzi.",5,2018,01,15
09,Bello ma potrebbe dare molto di piu’!,"Siamo stati nei giorni scorsi in questa bellissima struttura nel meraviglioso borgo di Courmayeur.
Personale gentilissimo e molto disponibile e sempre in grado di soddisfare al meglio le esigenze del cliente.
Tuttavia la struttura potrebbe rendere molto di piu’. La SpA non e’ nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile ad altri hotel di lusso quali Adler in toscana e trentino, nonostante le massaggiatrici siano di ottimo livello. La piscina limitrofa alle sale massaggi e’ chiassosa e a volte frequentata da bambini oltre le ore loro consentite (comunque ci e’ stato gentilmente offerto un esiguo sconto sul massaggio in segno di scuse).
La colazione e’ ottima, ma non superlativa e molte selezioni non sono comprese nel prezzo.
Stanze belle ed accoglienti.
In breve, ancora una volta mi rendo conto che le strutture Adler non si battono.

09,Comodo ma non lussuoso ,"Abbiamo passato 4 notti in questo hotel. Le note positive sono: il personale molto gentile e disponibile; Gli spazi grandi, sia comuni che nelle camere; la struttura architettonica bella e moderna; le comodità come l’affitto sci interno, la macchina che ti porta alle piste ecc. Colazione buona 
le note negative: l’atmosfera generale non è lussuosa o chic, le luci sono tutte fredde a risparmio energetico, pavimenti e corridoi bianchi e freddi, grès porcellanato effetto pietra ovunque, prodotti doccia ordinari. Il ristorante, seppur sia grande e bello, non all’altezza di un grand hotel. La Spa piccola e poco suggestiva (sembra la zona termale di qualsiasi palestra di medio livello). Basterebbe poco però migliorare moltissimo questo hotel, luci più calde e atmosfera più accogliente, ristorante più semplice e più buono. ",3,2018,01,08
09,Impeccabile,"Abbiamo preso un aperitivo qui una sera di inizio dicembre, la location è davvero stupenda, tipico allestimento di montagna ma molto elegante, i drink erano ottimi, come anche l’aperitivo offerto insieme, decisamente più sostanzioso di molti offerti da hotel di pari livello, ma non di meno di prima scelta, il tutto corredato da un servizio di livello e prezzi non troppo pretenziosi. Da rifare.",5,2018,01,07
09,The place to be ,"Ho avuto il piacere di soggiornare in questo hotel per il weekend di fine anno e posso senza dubbio affermare che è stata una esperienza da sogno.
ho vissuto in ogni aspetto la vita della struttura sfruttando tutti i suoi confort, dalla spa dove siamo stati accolti in modo caloroso ed efficiente sino al ristorante.
Gli spazi della spa sono ampi e puliti, piscina e sauna sono il massimo.
Abbiamo anche usufruito del ristorante e del bar, in entrambi i casi ciò che colpisce non è solo la qualità delle pietanze ma anche l’estrema cordialità del personale peraltro giovane che sa metterti a proprio agio cercando di soddisfare ogni tua richiesta.
Sulla qualità delle camere non dirò molto perché sono il massimo si possa avere senza remore sono perfette, noi avevamo una comfort davvero deliziosa.
Ultima menzione per il personale del ricevimento e in particolare per la Sig.ra Luana Iannuzzi, ci ha seguito con dedizione nonostante la grande affluenza dei giorni di festa sia lei che il suo staff non si sono risparmiati nel prodigarsi per tutto.
Torneremo sicuramente.",5,2018,01,04
09,Semplicemente ottimo,"Abbiamo soggiornato nel dicembre 2016,camere spaziose eccezionali pulite,con saluto armadio a parte è un grande bagno con vasca e doccia, il legno che riveste le pareti è in sintonia con tutto l’ambiente,hotel caldo e confortevole,l’unica pecca se vogliamo dire è il ristorante tavoli troppo stretti per un albergo di questa portata.
In ogni caso tutto molto bello con un letto sule confottevole a due passi dalle piste da sci con navette per il trasporto dei clienti.personale gentile e disponibile.
Da provare in coppia.

09,Indimenticabile,"Siamo stati ospiti due notti, che sono diventate tre vista l'immensa qualità della struttura, con grande disponibilità nel prolungare la permanenza da parte dello staff.
Una volta arrivati siamo stati accolti benissimo, e ci è stata assegnata una camera Deluxe anziché una Superior da noi prenotata.
Siamo stati cortesemente accompagnati in una spaziosa camera: moderna e tradizionale allo stesso tempo, con particolari architettonici di prestigio e un ampio balcone vista Monte Bianco.
Colazione, pranzo e cena sempre di ottima qualità servito da personale cortese e altamente qualificato in una location suggestiva con fantastiche vetrate vista valle.
Servizio Spa eccelso, sia per la qualità della struttura che per la bravura delle estetiste.                                                                 Il più bell' hotel in cui abbiamo soggiornato, ritorneremo presto.

09,Molto bello ma....,"Bell'hotel posto a pochi passi dalla zona pedonale e con vista spettacolare sul gruppo del Monte Bianco. La struttura è realizzata in uno stile alpino rivisitato in chiave moderna, senza lesinare nell'uso del legno e del ferro. Le stanze, spaziose e pulite, sono molto accoglienti e dal design accattivante. 
Il personale è gentile e disponibile: ho letto alcune recensioni molto negative in merito, ma secondo me sono prive di fondamento. Il giudizio è più che positivo sia sul personale alla reception che su quello della spa che sul personale di sala.
Colazione un po' troppo povera per il livello dell'hotel, più a livello di pensioncina.
Purtroppo inoltre abbiamo trovato il ristorante chiuso entrambe le sere della nostra permanenza. Piuttosto seccante.

Situato in una zona tranquilla è un'ottima opzione per godersi relax e pace. Dista pochi minuti a piedi dal centro.
L'unico neo: la scarsa professionalità degli addetti alla prenotazione. Ho dovuto spostare di un giorno la prenotazione e per farlo ho dovuto sostenere almeno 5 telefonate. Essendo un 5 stelle mi aspettavo un po' più di professionalità e capacità e magari un cesto di frutta in camera. L'accoglienza è dunque asettica",4,2017,09,02

09,"Hotel nuovo, minima-chic","Si vede che la struttura è molto recente e pertanto tutto è nuovo, curato e in stile moderno. La posizione anche se non centralissima è comunque molto vicina e con 5 minuti di passeggiata si è sulla centrale via Roma. Il ristorante dell'hotel per quanto sia buono non è ancora molto frequentato, forse perché ancora poco conosciuto o perché la cucina non essendo tipicamente di montagna attira meno.",4,2017,08,18
09,Week end lungo,"Hotel molto bello soprattutto grazie alla posizione : sorge direttamente ai piedi del monte Bianco. Servizio buono non eccellente per un 5 stelle : non aiutare a scaricare e caricare i bagagli per esempio e lettino da campeggio anziché una culla vera e propria per il mio piccolo di 1 anno. Ristorante buono non ottimo ma personale disponibile.
",5,2017,08,15
09,Accoglienza un pò da rivedere...,"Non abbiamo neanche fatto in tempo a scendere dalla macchina che 2 operatori della struttura (valet e receptionist) ci hanno subito fatto presente che avremmo dovuto trovare parcheggio ""fuori"" dall'area ingresso dell'albergo (?!?!?) oppure usufruire del garage interno pagando un costo aggiuntivo. Il tutto alla presenza di auto parcheggiate malissimo e che occupavano almeno 2/3 posti disponibili (ricordo distintamente una volvo parcheggiata in diagonale...). 
Consiglio di rivedere tale procedura (dato che trattiamo di un 5 stelle e la logica che il cliente acquisti separatamente servizi indispensabili come il parcheggio oppure se ne vada ""fuori"" a cercarlo la trovo poco felice)
Comunque sono da cambiare la modalità di approccio...!
Preciso, infine, che il giorno del check out non è possibile usufruire della SPA. 
Anche qui, benché ci possano essere valide argomentazioni, suggerirei di intervenire dato che strutture di categoria analoga nella zona consentono senza problemi l'accesso.
Insomma, nonostante la struttura sia bella e moderna e con una cucina valida, credo che valuteremo alternative al prossimo soggiorno.",3,2017,08,01
09,Una splendida cornice,"Molto bello, nuovo, moderno, camere con materiali a km 0.... Tutto molto bello! Anche la spa, con una piscina un po' piccolina, ma con ottima sauna, bagno turco, docce emozionali è una bella area esterna. La cena è' di buon livello, con una buona ricercatezza delle materie prime e presentazione del piatto. Carne cruda ottima, tortino di polenta e pere intrigante, buona la cotoletta alla valdostana. Discreta anche la carta dei vini.
Personale gentilissimo, un vero plus per la struttura.
Ci torneremo sicuramente.",4,2017,07,18

09,Soggiorno super!,"Abbiamo prenotato con voyage prive un soggiorno presso questo hotel per il mio compleanno. L'hotel è situato quasi in collina (non vicinissimo al centro ma ci si arriva comodamente a piedi) e permette una doppia visuale spettacolare di courmayeur. 
Appena arrivati il personale ci ha accolto offrendoci un upgrade della camera...la camera era spaziosa, dotata di ogni comfort, anche se l'ho trovata un pò spoglia per essere un deluxe.
La colazione credo che sia uno dei punti forti dell'hotel per la freschezza dei prodotti appena sfornati (dolci e salati); mentre il ristorante non l'ho provato per assenza di menu esposti/sul sito..è un peccato che non venga comunicato al cliente la possibilità di cenare all'interno del ristorante.
A fine giornata, immergetevi nella spa che merita!
Forse per essere un 5 stelle mi sarei aspettata delle attenzioni maggiori e qualche coccola in più, ma tutto sommato mi  sono trovata benissimo!",4,2017,04,18

( quindi per essere il "" Toppissimo "" manca un pochino ) cmq FANTASTICO... posizione Top... ristorante all'ultimo piano molto bello e anche buono, consiglio... bella la Spa con ottimo personale, Da ricordare la LELLA persona solare che rende tutto ancora più bello... 
l'hotel è comodo per il centro ed anche per raggiungere la famosa funivia del Montebianco ( bellissima ) ... 
vicino alla struttura un bel parco dove fare passeggiate e rilassarsi sulle panchine...

quando sono tornato il pomeriggio dalle piste di sci ho ordinato un Club Sandwich e mi è stato servito con tovagliolo di carta e senza posate, qualità Autogrill. La mia compagnia ha ordinato un toast, servito con tovagliolo di carta e senza posate, per quello che costa deve essere più farcito. La sera dopo io e la mia compagnia ci rechiamo al ristorante e l'ambiente era poco accogliente e freddo, preparazione dei piatti valida ma professionalità del Maitre e dei camerieri molto poco professionale, assolutamente inadeguata per un Hotel 5 Stelle.

La sala colazione e ristorante è luminosa e offre una vista incantevole sul Monte Bianco. La colazione è continentale e ben assortita. Il bar sempre aperto e con personale top. Le camere spaziose e confortevoli. Prezzo è abbastanza elevato ma coerente.

09,Delusione....,"Siamo capitati in questo hotel, non per nostra scelta, bensì ""dirottati"" dal sig. Patrick dell'hotel che avevamo prenotato, il QC termemontebianco, che pochi giorni prima della partenza ci ha informati che la nostra ed altre 2 stanze erano inagibili per la rottura di una tubazione (??? mi è sembrata una scusa per far posto a qualche cliente abituale dell'ultima ora..). Sempre il signor Patrick ci ha rassicurati sulla prestigiosa sistemazione che aveva trovato per noi, presso il Grand HotelCourmayeur Mont Blanc, informandoci che avremmo ricevuto i medesimi servizi previsti dall'altro albergo...ma CHE DELUSIONE!
L'hotel, in effetti, si trova molto vicino al centro, ma in zona tranquilla e gode di una bellissima vista è di recente costruzione e stanze e aree comuni sono nuove, ma... non è assolutamente all'altezza di un 5 stelle ! Gli arredi delle stanze, molto piccole, sono a dir poco minimalisti e molesti, richiamano più un moderno hotel cittadino che un Grand hotel montano, nemmeno un bollitore per the e caffè o bottiglia d'acqua, (solo a pagamento nel frigobar), in compenso, biancheria di ottima qualità sia per il letto che in bagno.
Bella la spa ma piccolina , SCANDALOSO il ""Centro fitness "" 25 metri quadrati scarsi, con una colonna al centro,  5 macchinari ed una palla da pilates....3 persone che si allenano  e manca l'aria!!!
Per la colazione poca scelta, buono e rapido ma caro il servizio in camera .
Il  personale è gentile, ma non all'altezza delle stelle dell'hotel: camerieri che chiacchierano tra loro nella sala colazione, le addette alla reception, poco sorridenti, 
il parcheggio antistante può ospitare una decina di auto, altrimenti 30€ al giorno per il garage.
Concludendo, secondo il mio modesto giudizio, da un grand hotel a Courmayeur, considerando il prezzo richiesto per la stanza con prima colazione, mi aspettavo qualcosa in più rispetto agli altri,  ma non l'ho trovato ",3,2017,01,02
09,"Bellissimo,senza parole!","É un bellissimo hotel, forse il più bello che io abbia mai visitato, ma non credo che al mondo ci sia un hotel cosí. Il cibo fantastico, e il personale sempre a tua disposizione. E il panorama é mozzafiato. ",5,2017,01,02
09,Buona soluzione a Courmayeur,"Hotel di recente costruzione, le aree comuni, le camere e la location eccellenti. Si trova a pochi minuti a piedi dal centro di Cormayeur in una zona tranquilla con fantastico panorama. La SPA è a mio parere sottodimensionata ma è comunque accogliente. A causa di qualche piccolo problema con i servizi e il personale non mi sento di confermare le 5 stelle, direi un ottimo 4 stelle.",4,2017,01,02
09,Pranzo al calar del sole..,"Sono stata in questo albergo il 1/1/2017 per pranzare con mio marito e mia figlia. Abbiamo ordinato due club sandwiches alle 1315 h e finalmente alle 1350 sono arrivati giusto in tempo x mangiare in veranda prima del calar del sole alle 1410 h
Ci siamo trasferiti all interno x i caffe' che sono arrivati tiepidi quasi freddi.
Nel bagno delle donne mancava la carta igienica e non erano stati puliti.
Insomma ho trovato che l albergo sia molto bello ed il personale molto gentile ma che il servizio offerto non fosse assolutamente al livello di un cinque stelle. Forse l albergo e' nuovo inaugurato nel 2014 c'e sicuramente molto da migliorare.
",3,2017,01,01
09,Un po' scomodo alle piste,"Albergo  molto confortevole con una cucina di gran livello. Ambienti puliti e in stile valdostano ma con punte di modernità. Peccato che non è sulle piste, ma a Courmayeur gli alloggi comodi alle piste sono pochi. Bello ma preferisco meno stelle e più vicinanza agli impianti di risalita.",4,2016,12,25
09,Si sente ancora l'odore di nuovo,"Ottima location nel mezzo di una collina innevata. Le luminarie rendono l'atmosfera molto natalizia: peculiare il pino illuminato di rosso dinnanzi all'ingresso dell'hotel sullo sfondo bianco candido della neve.
Piatti a base di pesce buoni e ricercati.
Dessert deliziosi in particolare il mont blanc.
Ci ritorneremo per farci coccolare anche dai massaggi rilassanti nella spa, piccola ma elegante.",4,2016,12,19
09,un ottimo 4 stelle,"La posizione è molto bella, quiete assoluta a 200 metri dall'area pedonale, il tutto coronato da una vista magnifica.
Le camere sono calde e accoglienti e molto pulite, ma abbastanza piccole e con un arredamento tutto sommato ordinario. Il personale è abbastanza disponibile e cortese.
La colazione è valida, ma non eccezionale (da buon 4 stelle). Ottimo il lounge bar con caminetto e ottima selezione di vini e distillati. 
In estrema sintesi: se si fosse qualificato come 4 stelle gli avrei dato 5 pallini...ma dal  momento che si qualifica come 5 stelle (e si fa pagare come 5 stelle!!!) il giudizio diventa severo.",3,2016,12,19
09,"Pessimo, scegliete altro!","Prima di dilungarmi nella recensione della mia esperienza, faccio un summa per chi non avesse voglia ne tempo di leggerla tutta: questo non è un 5 stelle nei fatti. Mancano attenzione al cliente, cordialità, charme e tanto altro.
Staff pessimo, ambiente freddo e poco accogliente, cibo scarso e mancanza di personalità.

Premetto che avendo spesso soggiornato in hotel a 5 stelle, ritengo di poter valutare con oggettività la mia esperienza presso il grand hotel mont blanc.

Consiglio anche alla proprietà e la dirigenza di farsi un giro presso hotel della stessa categoria di altri gruppi nazionali ed internazionali. (Bulgari, W, st. Regis, mandarin etc. etc.)

Veniamo alla descrizione dei fatti.

Io e la mia compagna abbiamo appena passato due notti in questo hotel per un week end sulle nevi.

Non sono solito scrivere recensioni ma questa è l'occasione buona per iniziare, con lo scopo di aiutare nella prenotazione le persone che, come me, esigono in proporzione a quello che pagano.

Per maggiore chiarezza organizzo in un elenco puntuale ciò che ritengo non sia accettabile in hotel di questa categoria e con queste tariffe:

- appena arrivato mi hanno chiesto se volessi parcheggiare l'auto in garage al costo di 30€ al giorno, ho detto di si. Appena saliti in camera la mia compagna ha verificato che il costo del parcheggio era invece già incluso nella tariffa. Ho chiesto spiegazioni alla stessa persona che mi aveva domandato se volessi usufruire del parcheggio a pagamento, la quale, dopo aver fatto un giro di parole poco chiaro, ha minimizzato dicendo che si è tratto di un malinteso
- Sempre al mio arrivo ho chiesto che le sacche con gli scarponi da sci venissero scaricate dall'auto e riposte al caldo nella ski-room. Mi hanno informato che avrei pagato 20€ al giorno per l'armadietto, ho risposto che non c'era problema aggiungendo che l'indomani avrei inoltre noleggiato gli sci. Mi hanno detto che se avessi noleggiato gli sci non mi avrebbero addebitato il canone per l'armadietto nella ski room. Risultato: la mattina seguente gli scarponi erano ancora nell'auto parcheggiata in garage... congelati.
- Come detto, l'indomani ho noleggiato gli sci presso il corner all'interno dell'hotel (credo che la gestione sia affidata a terzi, non diretta dell'hotel). Che dire.. sono rimasto allucinato. Il responsabile del noleggio, alle prese con un cliente straniero che mi precede, pronuncia in continuazione turpiloqui contro il sistema informatico che non funziona. Dopo un attesa di 10-15 minuti abbondanti arriva il mio turno: chiedo due paia di sci per un giorno, mi viene fatta compilare una scheda dove scrivo chiaramente la data di inizio e fine del noleggio ( coincidenti visto che intendo noleggiare per un solo giorno). Mi viene presentato un totale di 120€, sembrandomi eccessivo chiedo spiegazioni e anche qui, dopo un giro di parole poco chiare, viene ricalcolato per un totale di 70€. Effettuato il pagamento il noleggiatore dice: ""prendete gli scarponi e seguitemi"". Mi reco nella ski room per prelevare gli scarponi (ovviamente servono a sistemare gli attacchi degli sci noleggiato) e sopraggiunge il noleggiatore che spazientito per i miei tempi pacato, estrae dalla sacca della mia compagna i suoi scarponi.. graffiando sensibilmente la sua maschera da sci nuova. Lo faccio notare subito e non risponde, prende lo scarpone e va dove si trovano gli sci. Ovviamente irritato lo seguo, una volta li prende un paio di sci non di mio gradimento per la mia compagna; gli chiedo se puó darmene un altro paio e mi risponde che bisogna fidarsi si chi fa quel mestiere. Bhè, dico solo che la mia compagna l'indomani ha dovuto racchettare per tutti i falsi piani di Courmayeur perchè gli sci non era preparati o mal sciolinati. Prima di salutare il noleggiatore gli faccio notare ancora gli sfrisi sulla maschera, risponde dicendo che non è stato lui. Tornati dalla sciata si avvicina a noi seccato mentre ci cambiamo, prende uno degli sci usati da me e dice: ""hai rovinato una lama"". Sembrandomi una palese rappresaglia per la kia telefonata di disappunto di poche ore prima per lo stato degli sci della mia compagna rispondo: ""si si"". Mi dice ""si si lo dico io"". Sparisce per qualche minuto e torna nella ski room dove ci stavamo cambiando scusandosi per tutto, la maschera, gli sci non preparati etc.. Mi offre una maschera dal suo negozio a mia scelta per ripagare il danno, rispondo dicendo che le mie critiche non erano mirate ad ottenere qualcosa. Mi dice di prendere almeno un cappellino per la mia compagna, dico di no, si scusa ancora e ci stringiamo la mano. Tuttavia, sebbene abbia apprezzato le scuse finali, non tollero che sin da subito si sia permesso il noleggiatore di darmi del tu, oltre al turpiloquio e la ruvidità dei modi (non adatti a una ambiente con il tono che hanno cercato di impostare nell'hotel).
- Venendo alla camera, trovo di bassa lega e di scarso gusto che tutti i mobili e tutte le porte siano in laminato (finto legno per i profani della materia). Addirittura per fare dei piani da 6 centimetri hanno accoppiato due pannelli da 3 centimetri bordati separatamente. Incredibile che non ci sia nulla in vero legno, il risultato è un ambiente esteticamente freddo e ""plastico"".
- In bagno non c'è nemmeno una crema o una lozione per mani e corpo.
- Il rotolo di carta igienica di scorta è messo li in bella vista sotto il lavello.
- La colazione non è davvero nulla di che, di buono ho trovato solo il bacon. Le torte, le paste e le brioches nulla di straordinario, il caffè pessimo anche se, essendo bevitore accanito, mi è toccato prendere due per essere onesto.

Bhè, direi di finirla qui... credo di aver reso l'idea.

Note positive: posizione tranquilla e comoda, navetta per gli impianti e pulizia. Troppo poco per la categoria e le tariffe di questo hotel.",1,2016,12,14
09,"Ottima struttura ma,.....","Scelgo il Grand Hotel per passare il weekend dell'immacolata, struttura di recente costruzione e valutata con 5 stelle.
La struttura davvero moderna e ben tenuta offre camere veramente all'altezza delle stelle e una piccola piscina con spa inclusa nel prezzo della camera.
Colazione buona, ma non offre nulla in più di un 4 stelle.
Personale alla reception non proprio impeccabile.
Parcheggio interno a pagamento al costo di euro 30.
Camere non sufficentemente riscaldate (ho provato  a modificare la temperatura dal termostato ma senza risultati).
Speravo meglio.",3,2016,12,11

09,Non fatevi ingannare,"Struttura ottima, camere top ma qualcuno del personale va sicuramente cambiato in quanto scortese e maleducato.

09,Buono ma...,"L'hotel è esteticamente molto bello, gode di una vista magnifica sulle montagne però ho trovato le camere un po' piccole e la Spa, per quanto bella, può ospitare un numero troppo limitato di ospiti.

09,Invitato ad un Test Ferrari,"Pochi giorni fa ho soggiornato una notte al'Hotell Mont Blanc invitato dalla Ferrari, posso dire che e' un Ottimo Hotel e con un personale molto attento e cordiale, unico problema ho trovato le camere gelate...forse si erano dimenticati, dopo un periodo di chiusura o di assenza clientela, di prepararne la temperatura prima degli arrivi degli ospiti. Il sig Claudio e Maurizio alla ricevimento molto Gentili e Disponibili.La sig.ra oksana al concierge non e' all'altezza del Suo lavoro....fredda e non troppo gentile.tutto il resto molto bene specialmente con i camerieri al ristorante e al Bar.Lo consiglio",4,2016,10,27

09,Mirakulöse 5 Sterne,"Gleich zu Beginn: wo sind sie, die 5 Sterne?
Aber lassen Sie mich mit den positiven Eindrücken beginnen:
das Hotel liegt relativ schön, leicht erhöht im Grünen an einer wenig befahrenen Strasse.
Eine Garage - gut zu befahren - ist vorhanden, der Wagen wird auf Wunsch geparkt.
Die Einrichtung des Hotels ist hell und freundlich mit viel Holz, passend in die Berge.
Sehr freundlicher Empfang, man wird auf das Zimmer begleitet.
Unser Zimmer war in Ordnung, nicht sehr gross, aber zweckmässig mit Holzschränken rustikal eingerichtet und mit einem kleinen Balkon, Blick auf die Berge, ausgestattet.
Das Bad ist schön, sehr grosszügige Dusche.
Geräusche aus dem Hotel können in das Zimmer dringen, ein wenig ""ringhörig"" sind die Zimmer schon.
Nun zum weniger Guten: das Essen ist meiner  Meinung nach unterirdisch, ich kann kein Menu nennen, das halbwegs geschmeckt hätte.
Der Fisch (Forelle) wurde in einer Art durchsichtigen, zusammengebundenen Cellophan-Folie serviert, war weich, nicht warm und schmeckte sehr stark nach Fisch - fürchterlich.
Diese mässige Qualität ziehte sich bis zum Dessert fort 
Dazu kam eine nur mittelmässig motivierte Service-Crew, die die Situation auch nicht rettete.
Es ist nun halt einmal so, dass zu einem 5 Sterne Haus auch eine entsprechende Küche gehört.
Ich persönlich werde in diesem Hotel nicht mehr so schnell auftauchen 

",3,2016,10,23
09,Tolles Hotel,"Eine echte Perle am Fuße des Mont blanc. Das Zimmer war toll - das Bad unübertrefflich. Den spa haben wir nicht besucht, daher hier ohne Wertung..das Personal war sehr nett und zuvorkommend. 5 Punkte!",5,2016,10,20

09,Einige Kleinigkeiten fehlen zu 5 Sterne,"Die Zimmer und Betten waren fantastisch. Außer dass die Heizung im Bad nicht ging und die Regendusche in alle Richtungen spritzte, nur nicht auf mich. Das Essen war exzellent! Der Zimmerservice grausam. Auf den bestellten Toast warteten wir umsonst und wurden vergessen. Der Ausschank im Hotel ist nicht hinterhergekommen sodass man sich selbst den Wein aus dem Kühler nahm und nachschenken musste. Das Rezeptionspersonal war superfreundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Frühstücksbox zum Mitnehmen früh enthielt lediglich einen Apfel, Mandarine, Nutella, Marmelade, Wasser, Saft und Muffin. Kein Brötchen oder Messer!",3,2016,10,18

Abbiamo usufruito del upgrade gratuito alla suite e di un'ottima bottiglia di prosecco per festeggiare.
la struttura è eccellente, il personale cortese e disponibile. 
Unico aspetto con significativi spazi di miglioramento è il ristorante. Anche la colazione potrebbe essere migliorata: frequento abitualmente hotel per lavoro e ci sono hotel di classe inferiore (4*) che offrono una colazione più varia e di qualità superiore. In ogni caso si sta molto bene.",5,2016,09,13
09,Bello ma tanti difetti,"Per essere un 5 stelle dovrebbe dare di più. L' arredamento sembra ancora incompleto. Piscina inutile perchè troppo piccola.

09,Delusione,"Una grande delusione, a partire dall'arrivo alla fine del week end. Un vero peccato.per fortuna uno dei titolari e una ragazza alla reception erano superiori alla location.buona posizione ma di una freddezza appena entri che ti geli. Colazione e pranzo no comment.",1,2016,08,23
09,Vacanza rigenerante in montagna ,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo bellissimo hotel e siamo stati davvero bene! Ambiente molto curato e pulito, personale attento, gentile ed educato.

09,Relax con panorama ,"Struttura nuova e moderna.
Camere ben arredate e pulite, peccato per il frigo bar poco fornito.

L hotel è veramente stupendo, per il tipo di struttura, posizione e i servizi offerti. Il personale tutto, il direttore giovane e capace, i Sigg e le signore della reception professionali sempre, i ragazzi del ristorante e lo staff della Spa.

Le stanze sono belle , grandi con tutti i confort, in particolare il bagno è degno di nota.
Colazione varia con prodotti di qualità soprattutto i croissant.
Ristorante panoramico , con qualità del cibo buono ma da migliorare.
Una menzione a parte la merita la SPA gratuita per gli ospiti, grande bella con un ottimo percorso benessere e piscina riscaldata con vista.
Parcheggio gratuito.
Hotel a 2 passi dal centro.

09,Una bella struttura di nuova costruzione,Ho passato un week-end in questo hotel che si presenta bene con arredamenti moderni e stanze grandi e curate con un bel bagno di ottime dimensioni.Pavimenti in legno e anche soffitti.Pulizia ottima.La colazione è di buona qualità  anche se il buffet non è ricchissimo in varietà. La spa è modesta se la paragoniamo alle strutture del Tirolo c'è una piscina in pietra una sauna e un bagno turco.Il ristorante serve buoni piatti curati.Lo consiglio per un week-end sul Monte Bianco(skyway). Un hotel che merita sicuramente più di 4 stelle e con tempo e alcune migliorie raggiungerà le 5. Forza.....,4,2016,05,02
09,Quasi perfetto ai piedi del gigante.,"Hotel nuovo, bello pulito e quasi perfetto per essere un 5 stelle ma con qualche limite.
Le camere sono belle e spaziose la pulizia impeccabile e il servizio ottimo, la SPA non è gestita a livello delle stesse in Tirolo o limitrofi, piccola e con poco svago per nulla assistita e con qualche bottiglia d'acqua 2 mele e tre arance, tisane per niente.
Ristorante carino e cucina da rivedere, i piatti normalissimi non sono degni di un 5 stelle o forse nemmeno di 4, qui c'è da migliorare notevolmente.
La meraviglia comunque è la colazione che c'è poco di tutto, inoltre le uova al momento sono a pagamento e questa è ipocrisia o meglio follia, come il prezzo del parcheggio coperto, per poi non parlare della lista vini; molti prodotti di pessima qualità dai prezzi sbalorditivi come vini della zona in vendita al paese a €.6.00 e in lista a €.25.00.
Su queste piccole ma altrettanto importanti pecche, penso ci sia da migliorare e spero venga percepito, perchè sicuramente tornerò in questo hotel e lo consiglio vivamente, spero di trovare migliorie. Comunque un bravi a tutti.",4,2016,04,12

09,GRAN RELAX,"Hotel molto bello, accogliente e con il personale molto gentile.
Camera da letto perfetta, pulita e con materasso comodissimo.
L'unica nota negativa è stata per la colazione, è probabile che la sala non sia in grado di ospitare tutti i clienti quando l'albergo è completo, c'era la coda per poter accedere e poi ancora una lunga attesa prima di ricevere un bevanda calda.
La spa molto bella e pulita.

Consigli per chi vuole soggiornare a Courmayeur.",5,2016,03,25
09,SOGGIORNO IN UNA CORNICE DA FAVOLA CON UNA NOTA STONATA,"Per il nostro primo soggiorno a Courmayeur abbiamo scelto il Grand Hotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc. L'hotel nuovo fiammante e' davvero un'ottima soluzione per chi adora la montagna e lo sci. Splendide, calde ed accoglienti le stanze, struttura di design con un'attenta scelta ai materiali. Il soggiorno e' stato all'insegna del relax, accoglienza e informazioni ottime, carina la spa, generosa la colazione.
Unica nota dolente la cucina, davvero non all'altezza di una struttura cosi' di livello. Presentazione delle portate approssimativa e poco invitante, pasta scotta per ben due sere, la carne ci e' stata servita ancora non ben scongelata, verdure insapori. In difficolta' ed imbarazzo anche i camerieri, costretti ad ascoltare numerose lamentele da parte dei commensali. 
Peccato, davvero peccato, speriamo che la prossima stagione la cucina cambi registro, altrimenti saremo costretti a soggiornare in pernottamento e prima colazione e in montagna non e' proprio comodissimo.",4,2016,03,22
09,Non é un hotel a 4 stelle...,"Abbiamo scelto questo albergo per pernottare dopo una giornata alle terme di pre Saint didier, convinti di arrivare in un hotel a quattro stelle e, di conseguenza, di alta qualità.
Così non è stato.
Per quanto il personale sia mostrato gentilissimo e la stanza pulita, l arredamento risulta sorpassato e antiquato; anche la cena non è stata assolutamente all altezza delle aspettative: pesante e poco curata.
Inoltre, la mancanza di wi fi in camera e il parcheggio a pagamento sono altre pecche di troppo non indifferenti.
In realtà, se non fosse presentato come un hotel a quattro stelle, forse su certe mancanze si potrebbe sorvolare; presentandosi però come un hotel di livello, lascia un po' di amaro in bocca.",2,2016,03,11
09,Relax in un angolo di paradiso ,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia ( la mia compagna e una bimba di 16 mesi) per quattro giorni in questo splendido albergo. Appena arrivati ci hanno accomodato in una stanza di livello superiore a quella prenotata, ( una doppia deluxe) e dotata di lettino per la bimba . Camera spaziosa , luminosa, con un giusto mix di stile moderno e montanaro. Pulita e riordinata più volte al giorno.
La spa è accogliente e dotata di ogni comfort. 
Personale gentilissimo e pronto ad esaudire ogni desiderio. 
La colazione  ottima per abbondanza e qualità , si gusta in una ampia sala con una  vetrata con un panorama mozzafiato a far cornice al tutto.
Uniche note negative :
-il parcheggio dell'hotel al coperto a 30€ al giorno . Altrimenti è possibile parcheggiare gratuitamente all'aperto a 200mt . Una sera ci hanno offerto il parcheggio coperto gratuito causa bufera di neve. Gesto molto apprezzato.
- abbiamo cenato una sera al ristorante dell'albergo, buona la qualità ma conto eccessivo.
Centro raggiungibile con una passeggiata di pochi minuti.
Per raggiungere le piste è necessaria la navetta, disponibile a qualsiasi ora.

Bagno spazioso e dotato di tutto quello che serve.
Bella e spaziosa anche la spa.
Ottima prima colazione con pasticceria  eccellente.

09,Bello ma un disastro nelle prenotazioni. Del tutto inadatto a ospitare Eventi!,"Arriviamo con collega alla reception per fare un sopralluogo di lavoro in vista di un evento aziendale molto importante. Avevamo, nei giorni precedenti, confermato piu volte per iscritto (email) una opzione per 50 camere. MA la persona responsabile ci dice che le stanze non sarebbero piu state disponibili perche' a loro non risultava la conferma ... 
Ora io dico ... un Albergo 5 stelle che vuole ospitare eventi, puo' mai permettersi una cosa del genere?
Un danno importante che meriterebbe una causa di risarcimento danni. Ovviamente, vista la scarsa capacita' di gestire cose del genere, preferiamo non discutere neanche e spostare l'evento (e certamente tutti quelli futuri) a pochi kilometri di distanza in una struttura molto ma molto piu' preparata.

09,A pieni voti. ,"Finalmente un hotel a 5 stelle e moderno a Courmayeur. Questo albergo mi ha davvero conquistato anche per la gentilezza del personale. Dall'arrivo, in cui mi hanno assegnato una camera di livello superiore a quella prenotata, fino alla partenza in cui mi hanno concesso senza problemi un late check out. 
Il garage è davvero molto grande così come il parcheggio esterno e non avrete quindi problemi per l'auto. La zona Spa è ben curata così come ogni particolare dell'hotel. Ottima e con ampia scelta la colazione. Palestra piccolina. Camere in un moderno stile montano. Mi è piaciuto davvero molto. ",5,2016,01,18

Volevo fare una super sorpresa al mio ragazzo e un mese fa ho prenotato in questo hotel, curiosa di cenare nel suo ristorante, beh che dire, l'atmosfera era di ghiaccio, ristorante semi deserto, abbiamo mangiato antipasto,secondo e dessert, discreto come cibo nulla di che, per un totale di 102,50 € ,staff sembrava poco preparato, in fine il pagamento nemmeno lo fanno nello stesso piano dove c'è il ristorante, bensì ci fanno scendere in reception a pagare, ok si sono scusati più volte per i vari inceppi, ma caspita un hotel 5 stelle aperto il 19 dicembre 2014 come fa ad essere già messo così. Ci siamo fermati a bere un caffè nel piano intermedio e L aria che si respirava è' stata fredda, come nel ristorante. Peccato davvero speravo di stupire il fidanzato ma siamo rimasti molto delusi.

mi permetto un consiglio per la zona spa; riservare un angolo con la possibilità di sorseggiare qualche varietà di caffè, the, tisane, succhi, acqua, ecc. il tutto con adeguato sottofondo musicale.

09,GIUDIZIO CONTRASTANTE,"Provato nel mese di Giugno, questo hotel ha lasciato alcune perplessità ed un giudizio contrastante. La struttura è nuovissima ed in buona posizione, con comodo garage coperto. La camera che avevamo era spaziosa e con una splendida vista sul massiccio del Bianco. Arredamento nel complesso discreto, con letto comodo e bagno molto ampio con grande doccia. La reception è efficiente e la spa bella, così come la piscina.
Le noti dolenti arrivano dalla cena, non tanto per la qualità quanto per il servizio, che era affidato a giovanissimi camerieri tanto volenterosi quanto inesperti. Mi auguro che questo fosse dovuto al fatto che l'hotel era stato appena aperto e che la situazione sia migliorata nel corso della stagione. Colazione non al livello di un 5 stelle.
Posto dalle grandissime potenzialità.",3,2015,09,21
09,Struttura completamente nuova,"Ho avuto il piacere di soggiornare qualche giorno presso questa fantastica struttura.
La camera era perfetta: accogliente, funzionale e ogni dettaglio curato nei minimi particolari, in più aveva la vista sul  Monte Bianco... super!!!
All'interno della struttura ho approfittato anche della SPA: una vera delizia.
Ringrazio tutto lo Staff per la loro disponibilità e per l ' accoglienza riservata",4,2015,09,13
09,Bellissima vacanza ! ,"Siamo stati in questo hotel per un breve pernottamento di 3 notti. 
L'hotel è nuovissimo arredato in modo moderno e molto molto raffinato. Questo si nota subito appena arrivati perché anche da fuori si distingue molto bene da classico hotel di montagna. 
Appena siamo arrivati ci è stato comunicato che ci sarebbe stata assegnata una camera di livello superiore. Abbiamo molto apprezzato la camera. Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile per qualsiasi richiesta. La colazione varia ( mini brioches, puncakes, marmellatine in vetro, cereali, bacche e frutta secca, pane, prosciutto, formaggio, uova su ordinazione ...). La vista dal bar è davvero strepitosa: si vede un bel prato e il Monte  Bianco. 
Il ristorante ( abbiamo consumato lì  2 cene) è molto raffinato, ambientato in una bella sala. I migliori piatti secondo noi sono i gnocchetti e il petto di pollo. 
5 stelle meritatissime !!! ",5,2015,09,08
09,Stupendo !!!,"Ho trascorso insieme a mio marito e mio figlio di 5 anni solo un week end in questa struttura eccezionale. La camera grandissima con due locali separati da un muro, il bagno enorme con una vasca gigante e con la doccia a parte. Il letto era comodissimo con un materasso alto 20cm mai dormito così bene in hotel. La colazione abbondante e varia sia dolce che salato servita in una sala meravigliosa con una vetrata interminabile con vista sulla vallata innevata. Abbiamo chiesto un lettino con le sponde anziché un terzo letto per il bimbo e dopo una breve passeggiata in Courmayeur al nostro rientro in camera era già tutto pronto. Se avremo di nuovo la possibilità di tornare anche per una breve vacanza, ritorneremo certamente!
",5,2015,09,01
09,struttura nuova e di livello,"Sono stata a ferragosto per una settimana, prezzi non proprio abbordabili a fronte di una stanza confortevole con bagno di design ed enorme (ci hanno accordato un upgrade in una stanza superiore). Piscina interna piccola ma rilassante dopo una giornata di passeggiate. Una nota di demerito alla colazione, il primo giorno il buffet era ricco e vario, completo di frutta secca e disidratata, tutto scomparso a partire dal secondo giorno, colazione termina alle 10.30 ma da 10 minuti prima cominciano a smontare, le pietanze calde sono su ordinazione e a pagamento, forse un po' fuori luogo dopo 270 euro al giorno di costo camera..",4,2015,09,01
09,Cinque stelle?,"Hotel di recentissima apertura: credo abbia aperto solamente da qualche mese. Mi aspettavo pertanto qualche ""problemino"" di gioventù ma mai avrei pensato di imbattermi in tale mediocrità e in una gestione così imbarazzante. 

Per la prima volta in vita mia, ho avuto la sensazione di essere praticamente l'unico ospite della struttura (in due considerando la camera doppia!). Solo un paio di altre persone incontrate in sala breakfast (per sole due mattine su quattro) mi hanno fatto desistere da tale convinzione. 

Per un paio di giorni non abbiamo, in ogni caso, incontrato nessuno. Spesso la reception è risultata priva di presidio come peraltro il desk della spa (l'assistente al mio arrivo è stata presente solo 1 giorno su 4).Come si può definire tale approssimazione un servizio 5 stelle? Mai visto in 15 anni di viaggi una cosa simile.

La struttura in sé stessa non sarebbe nemmeno male. Si tratta di una costruzione nuova, arredata con materiali di ottima qualità. Ci sono all'esterno ampi spazi per prendere il sole (avevamo 30/40 sdraio tutte per noi!), la spa è ottima e le camere sono ampie come peraltro il bagno. Tuttavia, complice anche il fatto che l'albergo fosse praticamente vuoto nonostante il periodo - praticamente 6/7 giorni dopo ferragosto - l'hotel si presentava molto freddo, per niente accogliente. Sembrava di entrare in un grosso centro congressi; mai avuto la sensazione di essere in un albergo di montagna. Per nulla un ambiente caldo e ospitale. Ci sono lunghi corridoi che considerando la lunghezza risultano quasi angoscianti da percorrere.

Per passare ad aspetti più pratici posso dire che la colazione mi è parsa buona, anche se i frutti rossi presenti la prima mattina non sono stati più proposti gli altri giorni. Forse li inseriscono solo nel weekend? Scandaloso che si paghino 10 euro per il salmone e 5 euro per un toast. Una follia. Ottimi, invece, i salumi proposti

Le camere, come ripeto, sono ok. In linea di massima nulla di particolare da segnalare La mia pessima votazione è pertanto dovuta più che altro alla mia esperienza in senso stretto. Mi sono pentito di non aver prenotato presso altre strutture di pari livello in Courmayeur che risultavano molto meno cara e almeno dall' esterno sembravano molto più vive anche in orario di aperitivo e/o cena. Al GHC ho chiesto un caffè al bar alle 20.30 e mi hanno chiesto di pazientare l'arrivo dell' unico cameriere che era impegnato a servire al ristorante (!!) . Per carità un ragazzino bravo e volenteroso, ma come è possibile che un hotel a 5 stelle (spendevo 290 euro notte) non abbia un barista sempre presente al bar? Ma stiamo scherzando? Ma che servizio è questo?  

Superfluo concludere dicendo che non tornerò mai più. Mi permetto di consigliare inoltre al management di mettere il naso in qualche Fairmont, Mandarin Oriental, affiliati LHW, Four Season etc etc per farsi un'idea di quello che offre la concorrenza nel resto del Mondo. Consiglio infine un bagno di umiltà che permetta di contenere i prezzi del tutto, a mio avviso, ingiustificati

Ps: al riassetto serale nemmeno una bottiglia d'acqua e/o un cioccolatino e al check out nemmeno la solita domanda di rito ""tutto bene? Ha trascorso un buon soggiorno?"".",1,2015,08,31
09,Dilettanti cinque stelle,"Quando ho prenotato ho chiesto una camera silenziosa, avendo una bimba di due mesi e ci hanno dato una stanza a piano terra che si affaccia su un incrocio trafficato e su una passerella pedonale, quindi niente silenzio e niente privacy. quando ho chiesto di che legno fossero le camere e in generale l'albergo mi è stato risposto rovere spazzolato in realtà il legno usato è banale multistrato totalmente ricoperto da carta da parati con stampa legno, non si mente ai clienti. La colazione era abbondante, ma poiché si classifica come cinque stelle consiglieri di tenere tutti i quotidiani, per una informazione pluralista, anziché avere solo stampa e gazzetta. Una sera abbiamo ordinato una cena in camera ho chiesto un primo è un toast, specificando solo formaggio ed è arrivato un rist stracolmi di cotto. Il primo giorno abbiamo consumato acqua e birra del frigo bar e nei giorni successivi non hanno reintegrato nulla. Spero che con il tempo la struttura che è nuova possa migliorarsi nei servizi ai clienti ",2,2015,08,27

L'eccessiva modernità e gli ambienti divisi in blocchi rendono però a mio avviso l'hotel una sorta di ' non luogo' , per certi versi un po alienante . Ci si aggira tramite ascensori di non immediata comprensione in questi immensi spazi per nulla caldi ne' accoglienti . Per di più , il personale della reception ti scruta con fredda circospezione . Gentilezza e cordialità prossime al nulla . Trovo inoltre abbastanza scandaloso che ad una cifra del genere si debbano aggiungere 5 euro per avere uova strapazzate a colazione , cosa che è' parte della sezione salata di tutte le colazioni del mondo . Grandi perplessità . ",3,2015,08,22

La camera bella, arredata con gusto,spaziosa e pulitissima con un tocco di arredo contemporaneo e anche ""montanaro"".
La colazione molto buona servita in una sala con bellissime vetrate che danno sul monte Bianco.
Buona la cena al ristorante, gustosa non troppo complessa, con sapori ben equlibrati.
La SPA è ampia, bella la piscina e la sauna, anche qui belle vetrate che danno su un bel panorama.
Decisamente la cosa che più colpisce è l architettura, veramente molto bella.
L Hotel è nuovo, aperto da circa un anno, e ne risente un po sul personale di servizio, quello della sala soprattutto, molto giovane e un po inesperto (non puoi dare il Vetril sul tavolo accanto mentre io faccio colazione... non puoi rovesciare gli avanzi nel piatto per sparecchiare AH Ahah ah!) ma si farà , sono peccati veniali!

09,Le 5 stelle non brillano tutte...,"Recensione divisa a metà, partiamo dai lati negativi:

- dal momento in cui si esce dall'autostrada bisogna affidarsi al proprio navigatore perchè non esistono indicazioni per arrivarci.
- L'hotel non ha insegne, meglio memorizzarlo guardandolo dal sito internet per non sbagliare arrivando.
- Ambiente interno un pò poco accogliente, quasi freddo tanto è essenziale.
- Comoda la cabina armadio ma la luce è a tempo e dura pochissimo, se si è dentro bisogna uscire per far riaccendere la luce: scomodo!
- La piscina e il solarium sono piccoli, peccato ci siano solo sedie a sdraio e nessun lettino per prendere il sole.

Proseguo con i lati positivi:
- Bellissima struttura di design in legno.
- Camere pulite e spaziose con grandi vetrate e un bell'arredo.
- Letti king size. 
- Splendidi bagni di grandi dimensioni (però manca il porta sapone).
- Sala ristorante con una vista spettacolare sul Monte Bianco.
- A 10 minuti dal centro che si può raggiungere comodamente a piedi.

Faccio i miei più sinceri complimenti a questo albergo.

09,Caldamente consigliato,"Struttura nuova, ottimamente inserita nel contesto paesaggistico. 
Camera ampia, molto vivibile, con balcone di generose dimensioni. Insonorizzazione perfetta. 
Bagno bello, ampio, funzionale (qualche veniale difetto c'è : gli architetti progettisti frequentano poco gli alberghi?). 
Arredo camera nella tradizione di montagna ma assolutamente in linea coi tempi odierni. 
Sala della colazione con ampia vetrata su monte Bianco: incantevole!
SPA ottima anche se di dimensioni ""contenute"" (il sabato vi abbiamo rinunciato per affollamento, godibilissima la domenica).
Personale impeccabile per cortesia e professionalità. 
Ottima la decisione di offrire wi-fi e parcheggio coperto senza oneri (cosa ahimè non così comune). Peccato per i prezzi eccessivi del mini bar.
Complimenti. Torneremo certamente.

09,Manca poco alla perfezione,"L’albergo lo ha scelto la mia compagna a cui piace molto viziarsi. A portarci a Courmayeur è stato il caldo afoso della città pertanto la scelta è caduta su questo albergo principalmente per la struttura e le stanze; il fatto che non fossero mansardate e che fossero più ariose rispetto ad altri alberghi le è sembrato subito un plus in fase di prenotazione. Desideravamo infatti un posto dove trascorrere un fresco e rilassante fine settimana e sulla carta questo sembrava l’hotel ideale...e comunque lo è stato nonostante le precisazioni che seguono. La nostra stanza era una confort matrimoniale senza balcone con una spettacolare vista sul Monte Bianco. La temperatura della stanza era 27/28 gradi nonostante fuori ce ne fossero di meno...il sistema del ricircolo dell’aria andrebbe infatti migliorato (vd. anche area fitness dopo). Per ovviare al problema noi abbiamo tenuto le finestre spalancate nel pomeriggio e semi aperte di notte per fare entrare un po’ di aria fresca ed è andata bene così (anche se dormire con la finestra aperta di notte non è sempre un toccasana). La stanza è comunque confortevole, ben arredata, pulita, gli asciugamani vengono cambiati anche più volte al giorno (sarebbe meglio tuttavia rispettare i cartelli fuori dalla porta: se metto NO intendo NON entrare indipendentemente dal fatto che io in quel momento sia o meno presente in stanza. Pur apprezzando l’attenzione al cambio della biancheria non abbiamo apprezzato l’invasione di spazi).  La struttura è nuova e molto bella, a due passi dal centro, la vista sul Monte Bianco è mozzafiato. L’albergo dispone anche di parcheggio interno, il personale è gentile e disponibile (anche se noi non siamo stati avvisati con anticipo che la sera del nostro arrivo ci sarebbe stato un matrimonio e che quindi il ristorante non era a disposizione degli ospiti). La prima colazione è ghiotta con torte fatte in casa, brioches fresche, pan cakes, selezione di cibo salato...e quotidiani da sfogliare...tutto quel che serve per cominciare la mattina in pieno e totale relax. 
Nota dolente per noi (la “5 palla” mancante d trip advisor) è l’area fitness (la SPA non l’abbiamo provata): una stanza piccola e angusta, senza un ricircolo d’aria significativo e con poche attrezzature. Solo 2 tapis-roulant, 2 cyclette, un’altra macchina con i pesi e uno spazietto minimo per fare dello stretching con un solo tappetino. Per un certo periodo di tempo  eravamo lì dentro in 4 e quasi non si respirava più! La sala fitness è infatti a nostro avviso sotto dimensionata (soprattutto ci siamo chiesti...d’inverno, quando l’albergo sarà al suo massimo di capienza, che cosa succede in una giornata in cui non si può sciare per via del maltempo e gli ospiti desiderano fruire dell’area fitness?). Visto che l’hotel è fresco di apertura segnaliamo questa come area di miglioramento:  una volta spostato il fitness in un’area con un bel panorama, un sistema di ricircolo dell’aria più performante e, con l’aggiunta di qualche tapis-roulant in più e magari di una postazione per bere dell'acqua, anche la quinta palla di trip advisor sarà meritata.",4,2015,07,20
09,Ottimo albergo,"Ho soggiornato 4 notti in questo splendido hotel. Vicino al centro di Courmayeur, nuovo, stanze ampie, ottima prima colazione, veduta sul Monte Bianco da un lato e su Courmayeur dall'altro, personale molto premuroso e disponibile.
Penso che non si possa pretendere di più da un Grande albergo.
Il rapporto qualità/prezzo è veramente ottimo. Rimane solo qualche piccola pecca: in bagno i bicchieri sono tutti di plastica, quindi poco utili per tenere gli spazzolini da denti e il dentifricio, manca il portasapone, e ultima pecca, piuttosto grave, non c'è l'aria condizionata in camera, ma solo una distribuzione di aria forzata non regolabile dal cliente.
Malgrado ciò quando ritornerò a Courmayeur sicuramente alloggerò in questo albergo.
Ultima cosa positiva, alla partenza, senza chiedere nulla, mi è stato scontato il garage pattuito in 15 Euro a notte. Molto signorili",5,2015,07,13
09,Bellissima posizione. Nuovo con qualche imperfezione,"Provato per un lungo we, posizione strategica, appena fuori dalla via centrale, comunque raggiungibile a piedi in soli cinque minuti, in area silenziosa e molto tranquilla. La struttura inaugurata in dicembre è bella e molto razionale. Camere belle e spaziose pulizia perfetta, bella doccia in una specie di cabina bagno molto pratica, ottimo letto e tv schermo piatto (manca SKY). La nostra aveva finestra su bel prato molto curato (unico problema ci siamo trovati un gatto in camera). Ristorante di ottimo livello a prezzi di Courmayeur, lo chef è sicuramente molto abile i pitti ben presentati ed eccellenti. Spa bella con piscina ed idromassaggio percorso docce, bagno turco e sauna. Zona relax esterna piacevole. Unico neo, con esclusione del personale della reception (ci hanno anche accompagnato con vettura di cortesia alla partenza della funivia), sicuramente all'altezza del cinque stelle, è costituito dagli addetti al bar/ristorante/colazione che sicuramente non sono adeguati al livello; molto approssimativi, gentilezza non esaltante, traspirazione da dimenticare, professionalità scarsa.
Tutto bene quindi con qualche difettuccio rimediabile.",4,2015,07,13
09,Una favola!,"Bellissima location, hotel nuovo inaugurato a dicembre 2014, le stanze sono a dir poco perfette (noi avevamo una superior) nuovissime moderne un bagno enorme, eccellente la pulizia, staff cordiale, la colazione con vista sul monte bianco forse poco varia ma di ottima qualità. Un vero 5 stelle a Courmayeur ci voleva!",5,2015,07,12
09,buon anniversario a...noi!,"Ho scoperto l'Hotel per caso, navigando in rete alla ricerca di ""una sorpresa"" per mio marito. Lo staff è molto cortese e disponibile, mi hanno aiutato nell'organizzazione di tre giorni spettacolari consigliandomi diverse attività da svolgere.
Le camere sono molto confortevoli e molto curate, la vista sul Monte Bianco è spettacolare. La posizione è ottima e permette di raggiungere il centro a piedi in pochi minuti. Il ristorante è ottimo, io ne ho adorato i dolci.
SPA, solarium e area fitness sono accoglienti e ben organizzate.",5,2015,07,12
09,Piacevole sorpresa a Courmayeur,"Per prima cosa mancava un hotel 5 stelle a courmayeur da un po' di anni. Il vecchio Royal fatica ancora. 
Staff cortese e disponibile, struttura di recente realizzazione con grandi potenzialita'.
Sala della colazione con vista eccesionale sul Bianco. Top. 
Piscina e zona relax assolutamente sopra la media a courmayeur, forse si poteva osare di piu' :-) ma solo perche' e' un hotel nato da zero. Qs avrebbe permesso di estendere l orario di utilizzo anche ai piccoli ospiti. 
Una nota ""stonata"" che rilevo un po' attonito. Nel davvero splendido ed enorme bagno della mia JR ci sono i bicchieri di plastica per deporre spazzolino, dentifricio, etc. mai visti in un 5 stelle, giuro.",4,2015,07,04
09,5 stelle ben meritate,"scoperto per caso per aver ricevuto una proposta da secret escapes, non potevamo fare a meno di approffittare di quest'occasione. Siamo rimasti entusiasti nel vedere il luogo con panorama mozzafiato sul m. bianco, la cortesia adoperata, ottimo il servizio, camere grandi e luminose, oltre a una spa dove non manca niente, l'unica cosa che abbiamo notato, che a nostro parere andrebbe migliorata è la mancanza di qualche oggetto tipico, qualche mazzo di fiori, qualche tappeto, compensato comunque dall'ottimo servizio in sala colazione, e all'ora del tè.",5,2015,06,27
09,Elegante e confortevole,"Hotel nuovissimo, vanta tutti i comfort degli alberghi di lusso. Servizio eccellente, camere silenziose e curatissime, bagni moderni e con tutti gli optional che si possono desiderare. Da non perdere la spa, con piscina, saune e percorsi emozionali. C'è anche una piccola palestra, l'ideale per chi (come me) non scia ma vuole restare in forma. Colazione ottima, così come il pranzo. Se tornassi a Courmayeur, sceglierei sicuramente questo albergo.",5,2015,04,19
09,MANCA POCO ALL'ECCELLENZA,"Albergo nuovissimo in posizione panoramica, che coniuga concetti architettonici modernissimi e minimalisti, alla cura dei particolari ed all'uso diffuso di vetro e legno. A soli 5 minuti a piedi dal centro di Courmayeur dispone anche di servizio navetta per il paese e per gli impianti. Camere confortevoli, curate e pulite. Indubbiamente sistemazione di livello. Ma manca qualcosa per puntare all'eccellenza che un 5 stelle come questo meriterebbe. Pur avendo come attenuamte la recente inaugurazione ci sono alcune cose migliorabili:
Innanzitutto l'Hotel non è segnalato in alcun modo.
Il servizio sia a colazione che a cena lascia un pò a desiderare sia per le tempistiche che per l'attenzione.
La particolare struttura che suddivide le stanze in varie corpi, a volte non rende semplice l'accesso alle camere, dovendo cambiare livelli e dovendo prendere ascensori diversi.
Gli extra sono particolarmente cari.
Ma può un cigar bar/cigar room non avere i sigari?
L'hotel fruisce di un modernissimo impianto di riscaldamento a pavimento centralizzato. Peccato che quando è stato fatto presente in reception che la temperature in stanza era ben oltre i 24 gradi, ci è stato consigliato di aprire la porta balcone.....
Errori di ""gioventu''"" che speriamo vengano presto superati per godere a pieno del fascino della struttura.",4,2015,03,11
09,Giusto pretendere da un 5 stelle a Courmayeur...,"Ancora in ""rodaggio"", essendo stato inaugurato meno di tre mesi fa... Struttura ottimamente posizionata e luminosa, con splendide camere arredate in modo elegantemente essenziale, quasi ""scandinavo"". Ampio parcheggio coperto, servizio navetta e, soprattutto, negozio di articoli sportivi e noleggio sci interno all'hotel sono facilities sicuramente apprezzabili. Gli ospiti meriterebbero però di esser maggiormente ""coccolati"" in sala, sia perché il buffet della colazione non è speciale come richiederebbe il livello qualitativo della location, sia perché a cena non è tollerabile essere osservati da 4 camerieri senza che a nessuno venga in mente di versare altro vino o di servire pane se finito...",3,2015,03,08
09,Fantastica cena !!!,"Abbiamo cenato al ristorante dell 'albergo e come sempre lo chef Massimiliano Villani ci ha emozionato con i suoi piatti e con la sua passione .
Piatti ricercati e non banali : Millefoglie di tartare di branzino e peperoni con salsa al limoncello e pinoli tostati 
Oppure il magnifico Rombo in crosta di curcuma quinoa ,uvetta e latte di cocco.
Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo per il menù proposto in questa occasione.
Da di ritornare!",5,2015,03,08
09,Nuovissimo e bellissimo.,"In questo bellissimo hotel contemporaneo é stato messo in pratica un intelligente utilizzo di (onnipresenti) rivestimenti in legno, senza per questo risultare rustico. Negli ampi spazi comuni, come nelle camere, fino alla spa, le ampissime vetrate permettono una vista sugli esterni montani innevati. Buono il servizio e la presenza di parcheggio coperto. Colazione migliorabile, magari con l'aggiunta di qualche piatto caldo.",5,2015,02,17
09,Giusto equilibrio tra eleganza e sport,"Questo hotel a Courmayeur mette d'accordo tutti. Grandi, piccoli, sciatori e non. Molto bello, nuovo la modernità e il sapore di montagna semplicemente qui si incontrano. Non facile trovare questo equilibrio: il Gran hotel Courmayeur Mont Blanc è sicuramente in grado di offrire eleganza e 5 stelle senza essere stucchevole. La sua posizione è speciale, aperta nella valle. Le stanze sono in caldo legno, i letti comodissimi, lenzuola e dettagli molto ben curati. Ottima colazione.Vista sulle montagne meravigliosa dalla stanza e anche dal ristorante (unica piccola pecca la cottura della pasta..). Ottimo per famiglie ma anche per coppie (noi senza figli questo weekend), è spazioso, orientato allo sport e easy going allo stesso tempo. La Spa piccolina ma accogliente e dotata di tutte le attività e servizi. Un bijoux.
Personale educato e premuroso ovunque, in particolare alla reception, il manager Alberto gentile ed efficiente attento alle esigenze, ha concesso anche un super late check out. Non ultimo questo hotel accetta cani :). Splendido weekend, attraverso questo Hotel ho rivalutato Courmayeur come meta per weekend sciistico. Ah dimenticavo! al check out ci hanno omaggiato un delizioso sacchettino con marmellata, grappa e grissini dolci tipici. Sicuramente un posto dove torneremo volentieri :)",5,2015,02,09
09,Ottimo,"L'albergo è nuovo ma allo stesso tempo molto bello.
Le camere grandi e spaziose degne di un grand hotel a 5 stelle di montagna con bagni lussuosi e cabine armadio spaziose vista la necessità di molto spazio per abbigliamento da sci.
L'albergo e' ben posizionato a due passi dal centro e gode di una vista sul monte bianco.
Il servizio skiroom è degno dei migliori alberghi di montagna e non molto comune.
Il ristorante è sicuramente una delle ragioni per prenotare nell'hotel. Di alto livello sia la scelta dei piatti (non tipicamente valdostani) sia lo chef di primo livello. 
Consigliato.",5,2015,02,08
09,Cinque stelle non a caso,"Il fatto che sia ubicato a due passi dal centro di questa celebre location valdostana ti fa passare sopra a qualche piccolo neo (lo slalom di ascensori per arrivare in stanza ad esempio). La struttura è nuovissima e per gli arredi si fa ampio uso del legno che amplifica la sensazione di calore e accoglienza. Tutto funziona a meraviglia, colazione di ottimo livello, idem per ristorante e bar. Vi è anche una bella SPA per gli incalliti del relax a 360°. Le camere sono abbastanza ampie e ben insonorizzate con una bella vista sui monti (sarebbe preferibile una bella vasca da bagno al posto della monumentale doccia che è comunque ampiamente appagante).",4,2015,02,07
09,Top,"Nuovissimo, architettura molto curata moderna ma piacevolmente tradizionale. Camera silenziosissima, don troppo calda con un confortevolissimo riscaldamento a pavimento. Grande doccia bagno curato. Colazione non abbondantissima ma ottima spa molto bella anche se non enorme.",5,2015,02,05
09,Splendido,"Il meglio in tutto: struttura nuovissima con tutti i comfort, colazione a buffet internazionale, staff gentile e disponibile, servizio navetta gratuito per qualsiasi destinazione (telefonando in albergo ti vengono a prendere persino se sei in giro e ti accompagnano dove vuoi), spa decisamente valida, palestra piccola ma con attrezzatura ottima. Insomma...il meglio!",5,2015,02,01
09,Bene,Comodo hotel molto curato personale che chiede le mance unica pecca il resto direi bene si può tranquillamente frequentare bene i massaggi è la piscina......................................................................……....................................,5,2015,02,01
09,Bellissimo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel nel  periodo di capodanno, fresco di inaugurazione avvenuta solo 15 giorni prima. Bellissima struttura, moderna ma in armonia con la località ed il paesaggio, buona la posizione, tranquilla, ma in cinque minuti si arriva in centro.
Ambi spazi, belle le camere, bellissimo il ristorante e la zona bar ( con un rilassante terrazzo..) 
Personale cortese e disponibile.",5,2015,01,23
09,Molto buono ma costo eccessivo,"Struttura, posizione(pochi minuti a piedi dal centro e pochi minuti di auto da impianti), personale, piscina, colazione(spremuta d'arancia vera che ormai è una rarità), servizio navetta ok; aree comuni fredde; costo comunque un po' alto",4,2015,01,18
