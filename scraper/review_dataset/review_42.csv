42,The amazing Almanac,"We cannot say enough about this wonderful, amazing hotel. My wife and I recently spent 9 nights there. Of course the location is perfect, making most of Barcelona into an easily walkable city. The amenities are quietly elegant, with the perfect level of modern high tech. The complimentary breakfasts are a feast. The housekeeping is prompt and efficient. And best of all is the staff. Everyone is helpful, accommodating, knowledgeable and welcoming, especially the concierges (who made brilliant recommendations and arrangements).  A particular shout out to Sebiana Grs, who all but adopted us during our stay. As far as we’re concerned, there’s no place better to stay,  to enjoy this vibrant city.",5,2024,10,17
42,Barcelona is my new favorite city,"Fantastic people and service. We had an amazing stay and the hotel is both elegant and intimate.

From the front desk staff who greeted us with a delicious glass of Cava - and showed us two rooms to close from - to the Concierge staff - Sebastian and Mario - who expertly guided us in the navigation of day tours, restaurants, and all things Gaudi, this hotel is truly a gem. The rooftop is a chill place to hang out. Breakfast is outrageously fantastic!",5,2024,10,10

The rooms were very comfortable and beautiful, yet the hotel is not pretentious.  We highly recommend the Almanac.",5,2024,09,28
42,Exceptional Staff,"What a beautiful hotel with the friendliest most professional staff I've worked with. From making us feel welcome to assisting with every detail and even calling a doctor in a medical emergency, the staff is so capable and service oriented",5,2024,09,27
42,Best option in Barcelona,"I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude for the wonderful experience I had during my recent stay at the hotel.

From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the warm welcome and the professionalism of your staff. The check-in process was seamless, and I truly appreciated the complimentary upgrade to my room. It was beautifully appointed and provided a perfect retreat after a long day of exploring.

I would like to extend a special thank you to the front desk and housekeeping team, who went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Their attentiveness and genuine care made all the difference.

Thank you once again for a memorable stay. I will certainly recommend Almanac Barcelona to my friends and family and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2024,09,27
42,The best of Barcelona,"What a glorious hotel in the middle of Barcelona. The staff was so attentive with our every move, the room was over the top luxurious, and it was our anniversary and they took care of all the details to surprise my wife from the rose petals to the gift, cava and daily anniversary gifts for her, and making special orderve plates nightly",5,2024,09,25
42,Wonderful Barcelona oasis,"Loved this hotel. Here with my husband for a few days to tour the city.  Staff was amazing!  Food excellent.  Great location that is walking distance to all.  The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was great, which we truly appreciated!  If we return to Barcelona I would definitely stay here again!",5,2024,09,22
42,Perfect location and rooms.,Excellent and friendly service at front desk and restaurant.  Rooms were cleaned daily and well maintained.  However remote control for the TV was not working and not able to be repaired over the 4 days I was there.  Location of hotel is excellent near shopping and restaurants.,4,2024,09,18
42,Almanac,"Services at front desk and concierge were great. Except restaurant recommended was sketchy. 
Room was just ok for the price.
Bathroom area too small. 
Service in restaurant was very slow and hours of operation were inadequate.
Limited number of items in room mini-bar.",4,2024,09,13
42,Stop looking - you’ve found your hotel in Barcelona,"Excellence. The building and the rooms are first class. Perfectly situated, all you need to see and shop at are a short walk or ride away. The hotel staff are professional and friendly, great team. 

When we first got in our room my cheap London-bought charger blew, and tripped the room's fuses. The staff acted like it was their fault, remarkably, and sorted the issue immediately. 

The 'pool' is a bit of a stretch, as it is tiny and shallow, but the rooftop area bar is a gem otherwise. 

My daughter and I loved staying here and will return at some point, for sure.",5,2024,09,12
42,5-Star; Will return,Beautiful hotel and very gracious service. Room was a little larger than most European hotels. Concierge arranged airport transfers and even a last minute spa appointment. Very convenient location to all parts of center. Can't wait to return and spend more time.,5,2024,09,12
42,"Beautiful hotel, impeccably maintained","Probably the best experience we’ve had a hotel — and we are not young. Everything was impeccable: the customer service: the restaurant; the rooftop bar; the concierges and Bess staff were especially accommodating. Only thing — don’t come for a poolside vacation. There’s only a wading pool with 4 deck chairs. :). Finally, the location is perfect for tourists or business trips.",5,2024,09,09
42,Wonderful Stay in Barcelona,"Stayed here with my mom in November 2023 during Thanksgiving Break, our 3rd and final stop on our trip across Spain. We highly enjoyed our stay here and felt welcome. We stayed in an Almanac room with a view of Gran Via. The window had a chaise longue in front of it that was the perfect spot for an afternoon nap. You would think being on Gran Via, it would be loud, but the windows had excellent sound proofing. We slept in on Sunday the 26th and when we looked out the window, we realized there was a race happening! It was the Jean Bouin Race. I wouldn't have known there was race unless I looked out the window. That's how quiet it is. 

The location was excellent. Very walkable and super close to El Nacional which we visited twice during our 4 night stay. 

The breakfast buffet was really nice with a variety of food and hot items made to order. We also had a welcome drink that we enjoyed at Azimuth. We sat outside and they had really warm blankets to use as it was a chilly evening. We also had room service twice, as we were too tired to go out to eat. 

Overall we highly enjoyed out stay. The staff was nice and attentive, the food was excellent, and our room was very nice.",5,2024,09,08
42,5 STAR—First time to Barcelona,"This is definitely a top notch hotel in a great location.  Rooms were modern, bed was sooo comfortable and the roof top bar was very accommodating.  I would recommend staying at the Almanac.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  Safe area.   FIRST CLASS!",5,2024,09,07
42,A wonderful stay.,"Our entire group of 8 people truly enjoyed that hotel, service, friendly staff, breakfast, and rooftop bar.  Almanac is situated perfectly for walking to La Sagrada Familia, shopping, and finding funky hidden gems for food.  We also tried the new TIMEOUT Market which was very cool.  All in all, a great stay in Barcelona.

Thank you.",5,2024,09,07
42,Best Location and Best Staff,"We stayed at the Almanac in Barcelona and our stay was fantastic! The staff are friendly and willing to help you with anything, concierge knows everything and can help with bookings and recommendations, food is fabulous and the rooftop bar has gorgeous views. The bed in our room was super comfortable and we slept well each night. Best part was they have turn down service and leave a chocolate every night! 

The location is perfect and most sites are walkable! Highly recommended as we will be coming back in the future!",5,2024,09,07
42,good location,"a nice hotel within walking distance to La Rambla.

+ location, nice rooftop bar with great food.nice room, friendly staff. there was a good selection at breakfast

- we sat for about 15 minutes before we had to go and get the female staff when we wanted to order something for breakfast, I think she was from some country from Eastern Europe. but a Spanish man at breakfast the day before managed everything perfectly. 

our room door did not close properly so one evening we came back to the room and then the cleaning lady hadn't closed it properly so the door was open. luckily nothing was stolen.",4,2024,09,06
42,An amazing experience!,"I love everything about this hotel (clean, location, friendly staff, beautiful decor, good food). We found all upscale boutiques just a few blocks away. We also found amazing food options nearby. I look forward to staying again on the next visit to Barcelona!",5,2024,09,03
42,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful customer service.","Gorgeous room and hotel! Wonderful service, from check-in to restaurant. Incredible amenities as well and perfect location. The TV unfortunately would not connect via Bluetooth for sharing but we were too tired at the end of the day to have it fixed. Slept very well on the luxurious bed and sheets. Highly recommend!",5,2024,09,01
42,Great stay,"Stayed in the Jr. suite for 5 nights. It was a very comfortable room. Our only issue was that the air conditioning didn't get the room as cold as we would have liked it to, but we tend to always have that issue in hotels. Having breakfast at the hotel was so helpful. There were plenty of options. Sometimes the service was a little slow though. The concierge team as fantastic and a big help to us. We would stay here again.",4,2024,08,31
42,Great hotel !,"Great facility, location and friendly staffs with passions to help you.  Definitely will come back!   You also have to try the breakfast at the VIRONS if you stay here.  Very good foods with variety choices and very detail attended staffs to make your stay unforgettable!",5,2024,08,29
42,Exceeded expectations!,"The Almanac exceeded expectations! From the start of the stay I was greeted by the friendly staff, with a very efficient checkin process. The room was spotless, cozy with a great window nook that was modern but still charming. The location was perfection as it allowed us to be central and easily take an Uber or walk around the city. Would definitely recommend The Almanac and will be back!",5,2024,08,27
42,A top hotel in one of Barcelona‘s nicest neighborhoods,Quite an exceptional staff makes this hotel top-notch. Juan Manuel is one of the friendliest concierge we have ever met. He helped us get a table at a restaurant last minute and did so with an eager smile. Everything about this hotel is very well appointed from the rooftop bar to the breakfast at Viren’s restaurant.  We look forward to staying here again on our next visit to Barcelona.,5,2024,08,25
42,Not as expected from a 5 star hotel,"I wonder why this is a 5 star hotel ?, no bathroom amenities in room,(you must ask for everything except of soap) there is noise 24/7 from trafikk outside the street you never feel relaxed because of the noise. the check in took too long because of too much info from the receptionist.they listed up all info about opening times of restaurants spa etc.. info you don't need on a check in time. there was no feeling of luxury in the hotel. missed the smell (perfume) the 5 star hotel has. The breakfast was very very cheap. the choice of what you could  see  at the buffet was poor. example, no cucumber, no ordinary cheese to put on a toast, no Serrano ham, no apple juice etc etc. you could order omelets and bacon etc, but it didn't come out too your table at the same time, and if you where a couple eating they did not come with the food ordered at same time. ive stayed in many hotels in Barcelona from 3 too 5 star hotels. all of them is better than this hotel. the price you pay for this hotel does not match what you get back.
so sorry will never stay there again.",1,2024,08,24
42,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"The people are so welcoming, always smiling, hotel is perfectly perfect and definitely i’ll have the same stay when i come back to Barcelona. Breakfast is so delicious and have healthy section. Room is spacious, room service is done twice and quickly",5,2024,08,20
42,Guest centered hotel,"Nice centrally located hotel. I checked in late and had a very minor incident upon arrival and the guest relations team’s response was amazing. They went out of the way to make sure the rest of
my stay was comfortable and effortless. Bonus points for the Michelin starred restaurant on premise. Same chef oversees the menu for the rooftop bar and room service. All extremely tasty!",5,2024,08,19
42,Almanac Hotel Barcelona,"Excellent hotel, great location and the best staff. Roof top bar is fantastic! Well done Almanac! We stayed for 3 days and got great recommendations on where to go and what to do from the staff. The location is perfect as you can walk to many things and fast to airport as well.",5,2024,08,14
42,Delightful stay at the Almanac!,"Elegant, modern hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Enjoyed a delicious, vegetarian dinner at Virens, daily breakfast buffet and poolside snacks. Staff was welcoming and attentive to making our trip enjoyable.  Nice, clean gym with all the fitness basics.",5,2024,08,12
42,Great experience ,"We had a wonderful stay for 3 nights. They accommodated everything we asked for. The location is fantastic and the rooms are nicer than they appear in the photos on the hotel website in my opinion. The drinks on the rooftop bar are also very good, as is the included breakfast. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2024,08,12
42,"Amazing hotel, great rooftop","We had a great one night stay before our cruise at Almanac. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with friendly staff to ensure we have the best experience even for the day. Sameer, Sebiana and the remains staff at both restaurants were especially sweet even with our 4 year old twins running around causing ruckus! Thank you, we will be back!",5,2024,08,11
42,"terrible experience , cockroaches x 2 !!!","with the amount that we paid, i expected a much better experience during our 4 night stay. 

first day at checkin we were told all the rooms are occupied and the only available room was near double of the price we have paid originally, we had no choice but to accept it since we were there for a close friends wedding and wanted to stay close to everyone 

second day when we were told with a note on our door from 6pm to 7pm there would be power outage for the entire building, we planned our dinner plan around that time so we can get to relax at the hotel room before and after the power outage at least we can fix out jetlag... but the power went out at 4:20pm for an full hour plus . no ac/lights/internet/etc. when it was brought up to the front desk, it was said oh yes its now not later. ???

third day we had a group brunch at the hotel restaurant and found a live cockroach running around, when we advised to the management, they were given an attitude for us like its a normal thing, casually looked around where we specifically said its near the bench , walked away after a minute and never came back, 2 tables of our friends left because of this. 

after the brunch we didnt really enjoyed we went back to the room to relax again and still trying to fix our jetlag... and we found a dead cockroach inside our hotel room (attached photo ) ... i called the front desk immediately, no one answered then i walked there to let them know the situation and said someone will be there shortly to clean it up, i left that night for dinner and by the time we came back it was still there 

we rarely get a chance to travel and with the amount of money we have spent i truly am not pleased about the outcome of our trip",1,2024,08,10
42,Brilliant stay,Amazing location with exceptional service in all areas of the hotel. Check in was so simple and really made us feel welcome. We were travelling with my elderly parents so the little touches like water when we arrived into the lobby were very welcoming. Rooms are very nice with great views.,5,2024,08,08
42,Great experience.,The rooms were nice.  rooftop bar and small pool was perfect.  Nice shopping in the area.  We got off a cruise and left one of our peices of luggage at the port.  Mario at the front desk spent all morning tracking it down for us.  Finally found it at another hotel just minutes before we left for the airport.  Mario is the BEST!,5,2024,08,04
42,Great location and beautiful rooms,"the good:  Beautiful hotel in a great location, walking distance to all of the designer and high street shops, the Ramblas and the gothic quarter.  The breakfast is very good as are the staff, we couldn't ask for any more.  The beds are comfortable, automatic toilet and black out blinds helped us get an amazing sleep.  We had a tea and coffee making machine and a lovely complimentary bar of chocolate on arrival.

The bad:  the pool is very very small with only 6 sun loungers so on our arrival after a very early start we had to lie on the sofas near the bar area which wasn't great and once we got a bed each the workmen started banging and drilling in a. room at the side of the pool.  We did manage to get beds every other day by getting there before 12.  Again the rooftop bar served delicious chicken tenders.  The pool looks bigger online than it actually is and is only 0.7m deep.  I would say this hotel is more for sightseeing and shopping than sunbathing although you could, its very quiet too.

I was surprised to find no cotton wool, ear buds and general toiletries for a 5 star hotel I had to ask for them, they bought me a small packet of cotton wool and the robes are quite old.  

I would definitely come again",4,2024,08,01
42,A wonderful experience in Barcelona.,"Service was excellent, very friendly and professional staff. Lovely breakfast with wonderful selections of fresh fruit, great menu choices and atmosphere.  We especially enjoyed your rooftop bar for a late night drink. I would highly recommend your hotel.",5,2024,07,26
42,"Great location and staff, comfortable 3 night stay in the heart of Barcelona","Almanac Barcelona was a great place to stay for our 3 night trip to Barcelona. The location can't be beat - super convenient to most every place in the heart of the city. One can easily venture west or north to the less touristy areas or walk to El Born or the Gothic Quarter.

The staff was wonderful - especially Sr. Diego Altamira who checked us in and followed up with us throughout our stay to see if we were doing well. Very professional and warm staff. 

We also enjoyed the lobby upon returning to the hotel where complimentary drinks (wine, cava, OJ) were available for us to cool down.

The breakfast buffet was delicious with plenty of options - all very healthy and tasty. We dined at Virens for lunch and it was a memorable meal, celebrating vegetables and Asian fusion.

The room was comfortable. We booked via AMEX Fine Hotels and were hoping for a complimentary upgrade, which was not available. However, the room was still well appointed, especially the bathroom.

The rooftop bar had good views and was a nice place to hang out in the late afternoon. We tried to use the pool - it is small and shallow, more suitable for dipping/cooling off after laying out in the sun. 

All in all, very positive. We would stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2024,07,24
42,Love BCN and Almanac Hotel,"Best hotel, best location, we walked everywhere from here! Amazing attentive staff (especially the concierge!) wonderful stay! The food is great at rooftop restaurant! Rooftop pool is a perfect respite for mid day siesta time!! Will stay again when we go back to beautiful Barcelona!!",5,2024,07,24
42,This should be at the top of your Barcelona stay list.,"Almanac is one of the very best hotels we have stayed with, and we have stayed with countless luxury names around the world. 
Friendly, professional staff, exquisite food in wonderful surroundings, room is one of the quietest we’ve stayed in and the bed is superb.
Fitness centre is functional if small.
Centrally located, this is a gem.
Thank you!",5,2024,07,24
42,An okay stay,"For a five-star hotel, the bath robes were very old (holes, thin).  As an AMEX platinum member, no room upgrades were available and the rooftop bar had a DJ who played music on a horrible sound system with extreme high volume and awful speakers that crackled, etc.  Despite multiple guests complaining, we were told we had to wait until 22:00 when the DJ was expected to leave.  Perhaps a separate sound system should be used if parties are booked.  It was truly an awful experience",3,2024,07,23
42,Amazing stay!,"We had one of the best hotel experiences of our lives!  We had amazing service, fantastic food, and an overall amazing experience!!  Concierge was very helpful.  The hotel has great amenities like the steam/sauna and a rooftop wading pool.  Highly recommend!!",5,2024,07,22
42,An Excellent Stay at Barcelona's Best Hotel,"I am incredibly grateful for the hospitality and professionalism of the Almanac Barcelona hotel team members. Juanjo and Esme, along with others, made my stay very memorable. This was the start of a 2 week trip for my group of 9 and they accommodated us every step of the way. We added an extra person to our trip, and they helped us increase the room. They provided what we needed when some members of our group had lost luggage. On the last day I missed a train and returned, and they had space for me. The breakfast was incredible, many options and the service was stellar. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2024,07,20
42,Excellent choice.,"Stylish casual elegance in a fantastic section of Barcelona, filled with must-see sights and fabulous restaurants.  Easy to walk to restaurants and sights.  Great breakfast included and loved the rooftop bar.  The staff were very helpful and gracious.",5,2024,07,17
42,Nicest Hotel in Barcelona,"Absolutely the best hotel in barcelona. The staff were amazing, they arranged cars, food, and everything else we ever needed. the food at virens  was incredible definitely recommend his flawless tasting menu. The roof top bar and food tasted amazing with a wide selection of options that made both of us happy! It was also perfect stop after a hot day of exploring! Could not recommend more.",5,2024,07,14
42,Great 5 stars hotel in the best location and amazing service,"Beautiful stay in 5 stars hotel in Barcelona. Amazing location . Very friendly stuff starting from front desk Esmee, Anna and their manager  , Pau, concierge Juan . Great breakfast and of course we got upgrade for a beautiful terrace suit. Thank you so much for your hospitality, will highly recommend your hotel and we will be back.",5,2024,07,12
42,Best choice we made in Barcelona,"It was a wonderful hotel. The rooms were amazingly comfortable and well-designed. How the ceiling illuminates is still a mystery to us. The nightstand lamp is a piece of art, and the sunken sinks were my favorite.  The rooftop was a moderate experience, but the Michelin restaurant can boast all the stars it wants. Breakfast was enjoyable, and the lighting & climate-controlled rooms were a plus.  The staff was superb. They could have clothes steamers in each room so you don't have to ask for them.  The concierge gave us the right advice on what to do in town before check-in.",5,2024,07,09
42,It was a memorable experience.,"It was my first time at the hotel, but hopefully not the last. Everything was superb: the room, the service, the concierge, the spa, the massage, etc., priceless.
I particular I want to indicate that Mario the concierge was really outstanding. He clearly showed me that he is a truly professional in his job.
Highly recommended",5,2024,06,26
42,My Recent Stay,The level of service was excellent and what stood out from my stay.  Nothing was too much trouble and everyone did everything they could to make my stay as good as it could be in a particularly frenetic period for me as I was trying to juggle both work with a little pleasure.  Sandra Jimenez is a wonderful General Manager and Sandra and her Team could not have done more to make my stay memorable.  Thank you.,5,2024,06,25
42,Best Hotel and Staff in Barcelona,"Everything about the Almanac Barcelona was superior.  I arrived early and was greeted with a beverage.  Since my room was not available, I was invited to go down to the spa where I showered and rested. When my room was available, I was escorted to my room where my bags were waiting on me and I was given a thorough tour of the room and the amenities. Everyone made me feel very welcome. The location is also perfect and the restaurant, Virens, was some of the best food I have ever eaten and you must stop by the rooftop bar. Please visit this incredible hotel while in Barcelona.",5,2024,06,24
42,11 out of 10,"This hotel was out favorite! The doorman was incredible. He met us at our taxi before my foot even hit the ground and always had a smile on his face. Room was gorgeous, rooftop restaurant/bar was great, service impeccable, & complimentary breakfast!",5,2024,06,24
42,Good visit but room for improvement,"- gym very small for this type of hotel
-  check in was not until 5pm…not acceptable especially with AMEX reservation 
- what’s up with that bathroom trash can?
- hair dryer requires holding down button - wife not happy 
- had to waive down breakfast staff to place order",4,2024,06,24
42,A great hotel in Barcelona,"Great room, large & spacious with up to date furnishings. We had a great city view as well. Concierge was incredibly helpful with recommendations and setting us up with restaurants. Rooftop is nice with a great staff. Only downside was there was noise at night from the room next door and hallways as walls were a bit thin. However, it would not stop us from staying here again.",4,2024,06,22
42,"Wonderful stay with welcoming, helpful staff at Almanac Hotel in Barcelona.","My husband and I had a wonderful  experience 
at The Almanac Hotel in Barcelona. Every person working at the hotel was welcoming and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and attractive. The breakfast which was included was delicious as was the outside rooftop bar. We enjoyed the view from the bar and relaxing set up. The location of the hotel is very convenient. We will  stay again and highly recommend The Almanac.",5,2024,06,21
42,wonderful experience,rooms were roomy and very comfortable. shower was great. staff was attentive and helpful. the restaurant was excellent for dinner and the daily breakfasts were great.the one suggestion i might make is that you include a top sheet in the bed. the blankets were perfect for my wife but too hot for me. a sheet only would have fixed that.,5,2024,06,20
42,A couple of nights in Barcelona...,"What a great choice in Barcelona.  Perfectly located for site-seeing, shopping and dining.  And don't miss the very special Vegetarian leaning (there is a fish option!) gourmet restaurant in the hotel.  Eat a dinner there one night, splurge on the wine pairing, and you will have a new home in Barcelona...lovely rooms and rooftop as well.",5,2024,06,13
42,"Beautiful, modern property very conveniently located - great staff and food","Beautiful, modern property very conveniently located w/ a terrific breakfast buffet, fabulous Michelin-quality dinner service & food, and uber kind and helpful staff.  When we return to Barcelona, we will certainly stay at the Almanac.",5,2024,06,10
42,Started to feel like home (in a 5 star way),Fabulous hotel. Service was impeccable. Breakfast was always a treat. Location was convenient for Ramblas and more. Very helpful staff. Beds comfy. High tech shades and light controls by the bed. Strong shower. Quiet. Loved the 8th floor bar and pool lounge. Loved our 9 days there.,5,2024,06,05
42,Not a 5 star hotel,"This is not a 5 star hotel first and foremost.   While our stay here was ok, it should be noted this is claimed to be 5 star and this needs to be reevaluated.    I’ll start with the pros. The lobby staff is wonderful and welcoming. The lobby is beautiful and there is a beautiful restaurant (we skipped it) in the lobby as well. The rooftop is gorgeous for drinks and the staff was also great.   The cons - the room was gross, run down, under stocked, under cleaned, under serviced.  See photos.   We had the adjoining “family room” the carpet was repulsive, floors were filthy, floors stained around the toilets, sink grout had mold like browns stains.   The house keeping staff was horrible.   We had to call almost twice a day for issues and then when they arrive to the room they just come in, every single time.   Immediate knock and then entry. Made no attempt to wait for you to come to the door.  Not once, not twice, every time.  We had the do not disturb light on the last morning and they just came in at 10am check out day.  Never have I experienced this anywhere in the world.     Turn down was dependent clearly on who on shift that night.   Always left a chocolate and retrieved the dirty towels, but everything else was sporadic.   Most housekeeping staff looks around at what you’re using and adjusts your service, not here. Short towels daily, never left face towels/wash cloth.    The decor in the room is modern,  but cheap modern.  Iron and board were ikea and cheap/difficult to use. While the location was decent, I would chose to stay elsewhere next time.",3,2024,06,03
42,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We really enjoyed our suite at the Almanac. We would have preferred our terrace suit to have been on the front of the hotel instead of facing the alley and a wall in back but we were not given a choice. 
Breakfast buffet extremely lovely with lots of options.  Coffee service could be quicker and they should add a barista as the poor girl who was singly trying to make the coffee for 100 people could not keep up despite there being plenty of other staff around.  
Roof top bar very nice
Everyone that works at this hotel is very kind and helpful. 
We will return.",4,2024,05,25
42,Underwhelming Stay at a ModernHotel,"The hotel is very modern, clean and with solid amenities. However, the service is quite poor. Prior to arriving to the Almanac, I sent an email informing the hotel that we would arrive around 1 PM and would utilize our early check-in option provided through American Express. I also informed them in the email that I proposed to my fiancé and we were there to celebrate the engagement. We arrived at the Almanac after 2 PM and it was evident that they had not read our email. The room was not ready at the time we had asked, even though we arrived a little later which should have afforded them more time to prepare. We had to wait until they found a room that was ready. I again mentioned that we were celebrating our recent engagement in Barcelona and this was ignored and not even a ""congratulations"" was said by the attendant. The attendant instead was assisting multiple people at once and did not focus on any specific client. When we were shown to our room by the attendant, we entered our room to find bags at the door and on the bed that were not ours. This further showed us that they were not ready and even gave us a room that was already occupied. The attendant had us wait in the room while another attendant came in to remove the bags that were not ours and drop off our bags. This was extremely uncomfortable being a room with bags that are not ours. The new attendant then stated that our room was not ready, grabbed the bags, a chocolate that was sitting on the table and left. Another attendant at this point came in to drop off a room scent and a letter to us. After our stay, while we were leaving, I proceeded to check-out, at which time the hotel pulled up the list of charges for us to find $200+ charges on our room that were not ours. I disputed these charges and at this point the attendant brought out the receipts of the charges. I again confirmed that the $200+ charges were not ours and even showed her comparison of the receipts with my signature to the receipt that was not ours. The receipt that was not ours was obviously not my signature and didn't even have a room number on it. The attendant then has another attendant come over and I have to again explain that the charges were not ours and compared the signatures. I would expect to have been believed the first time I said the charges were not ours. The worst part was the lack of individual care and attention, especially when being informed of the special occasion we were there for and knowing the cost.",2,2024,05,23

42,Fantastic hotel,"This place is fantastic. The staff was amazing. Beautiful design. Our room was large, quiet and comfortable. Easy walking distance to Gothic Quarter, lots of restaurants and shopping. The restaurant seems very good although we only ate breakfast there. Overall our stay in Barcelona was also good. The only negative part was the Flamenco show at the Palau de Music. The building was pretty cool but the show was pretty boring (at least to my wife and I) but was fairly expensive. Sagrada Familia, on the other hand, is a must see despite throngs of tourists.",5,2024,05,18
42,Well finished room and convenient location,Our room was very well finished and generous size for a couple with a toddler. Staff were also very helpful and welcoming. Conveniently located for food and walking around nice areas of Barcelona.,5,2024,05,12
42,Best hotel experience ever!,"Almanac Hotel Barcelona is by far the best hotel I’ve experienced in my life. I have never met more professional and personal staff!  They are generous with their time, and their goal is to make you happy and your experience comfortable.  Our hotel rooms were immaculate, the rooftop service was wonderful. There is no other hotel I would recommend in Barcelona. Thank you to the incredible staff there.  You are the best. Thank you for making our experience incredible.",5,2024,05,06

42,Elegant hotel in excellent location ,"I would describe this as a boutique hotel. The rooms are generally small, but that is common in Europe.

We had dinner and breakfast there. For dinner, you should make reservation.  We ordered from the a la carte menu and shared the food among us. Food and service was excellent.

As for breakfast, the buffet was nicely stocked. The fruits were fresh. You could also order hot food from the menu. We liked the avocado on toast.",4,2024,04,24

42,Best hotel ever,"We had a great time at this hotel.  The front desk staff was awesome.  Mario was attentive to our every need even coming to our room to help carry our luggage at check out.    Anna was awesome.  When showing us our room at check in she and I noticed something was out of place.  Not a big deal, but she sent chocolate covered strawberries to our room.  What a nice gesture. Oh, and they tasted like heaven. She even came to our rescue when she saw we were waiting a while outside for a taxi and told us that she would call us a taxi since we  needed a larger cab.  The rooms had everything we needed.  The automatic black out shades, extra large towels, awesome water pressure shower, and a bidet with heated water, a remote control a must try. The morning breakfast was awesome. The fresh squeezed orange juice was like I’ve never had before. Order the pancakes they’re the best. Conveniently located to everything and when we come back to Barcelona this is the place we will be staying. Five stars.",5,2024,04,02

They are attention to detail incredible.They're genuine interest in their guests amazing. They go out their way to make you feel comfortable.  And welcome. I am a disabled and terminally ill guest. And they were incredibly kind and generous with everything that they did. Every single person that worked at this hotel went above and beyond. I really cannot emphasize enough. How great this hotel is because they know how to provide excellent service to their guests. They know how to talk to people. They know how to make you feel welcome, they are really, really good at what they do. And I am so blessed that the last. trip of my lifetime, was at the almanac hotel wonderful place.

42,Ok but not great,"5 star rooms but not so much a 5 star hotel. Facilities at the hotel just don’t really match up to what I’d expect from a 5 star. Gym had a few things not working and the sauna wasn’t the best but the steam room was very good. Didn’t use the bar or restaurant as they seemed separated from the hotel.
On the only sunny day we had the pool was closed.
No turn down service and no umbrellas when it rained.",4,2024,02,18
42,excellent place to stay in Barcelona,"This is a perfect location to stay in Barcelona, with a lot of Restaurants near by, you are in the middle of the shoping area. Perfect Hotel with a fiendly roof top bar and quiet rooms to sleep in the busy city.",5,2024,02,18
42,Look no further than Almanac Barcelona,"Having stayed at FS Madrid and FS Lisbon for vacations in the past, Almanac Barcelona would fit in perfectly as their boutique middle sibling. The hotel is slightly younger than Four Seasons Madrid. It was an easy choice to make as their Junior Suite has not one but two Juliet balconies overlooking Gran Via and a sunken tub. After flying 16+ hours, I was greeted warmly by the front desk and offered a cool beverage. They were also so kind to assist with my international data plan not engaging. 

The room itself is minimalist in design and quiet (windows are double paned). A modern touchscreen controls lighting, drapes and the thermostat. A Nespresso machine and a hot tea machine are present, as well as daily bottled water. 

I was thoroughly impressed by their restaurant, Virens. Definitely recommend dining here for breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet was incredibly fresh and healthy. There are berries, fruits and fresh pressed green, beet, carrot and orange juices on colorful display. Also available are cereals, yogurts, chia seed pudding, cheeses (even a plant based), homemade jams and different breads, eggs made to order and even an avocado toast with sprouts. Included are Catalan offerings such as tortilla espanola and bocadillos as well. 
Dinner at Virens was also a culinary delight with a plant based tasting menu (meat and fish are also available) that was flavorful, nourishing and artfully prepared. So beneficial for your gut microbiota. 
There is also a rooftop dipping pool which would be enjoyable when warmer. I can attest to the views of the Sagrada Familia. Beautiful at sunset. One can also walk to this largest unfinished Catholic church. I would recommend buying tickets a few weeks in advance as was fully booked for the days of my stay. 

Special thanks to Sammy the bellman who inquired about my phone issues (thankfully resolved) as I passed him heading out for lunch the next day and also checked to see if I needed help w/ my luggage on my arrival and departure. 

It was truly a relaxing and memorable  stay at Almanac Barcelona, which made it possible to thoroughly enjoy all the sights, sounds and tastes of Barcelona. A return visit is definitely needed with a stay at this gem of a hotel.",5,2024,02,17
42,Unparalleled Hospitality at the Almanac,"My recent travels took me to Spain, where I had the fortune of staying at three distinct five-star hotels: While each hotel offered its own brand of luxury, it was the Almanac that left an indelible mark on me, compelling me to share my experience.

From the moment I stepped through its doors, the level of service and hospitality at the Almanac was unparalleled. Each staff member, from the doorman to the concierge, went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable. Their attention to detail, warmth, and professionalism were so impressive that it prompted me to research the company managing the Almanac. I've since decided that my future hotel stays will be exclusively at properties managed by this exemplary company.

What sets the Almanac apart is not just the luxury of its amenities but the genuine hospitality of its staff. Every interaction felt personalized, making me feel valued and welcomed. The contrast with the other five-star hotels I stayed at in Spain was stark; the Almanac's service was in a league of its own, far surpassing others by a country mile.

I am eternally grateful for the experience of staying at the Almanac, under the same roof as such hospitable people. It was not just a stay but a journey into what true hospitality can look like when executed flawlessly. To the team at the Almanac, thank you for making my visit to Spain unforgettable. Your dedication to guest satisfaction is a testament to the excellence that all hotels should aspire to.",5,2024,02,15

It was always a pleasure to return to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing to be greeted by the friendly staff. The concierge gave us fantastic restaurant recommendations that were able to accommodate our food allergies. The food at the restaurant in the hotel, Virens, was also excellent and they were able to accommodate all of our dietary considerations as well. We felt that the staff went above and beyond to make us feel special. We would definitely recommend staying at the Almanac!",5,2024,02,08

42,Tacky Racist Hotel,"I just checked in and I am Asian American. When I walked in they looked at me like I am some kind of intruder - they weren’t friendly at all.  A white American couple walked in right after me and they were really friendly to this couple, they even took their luggage and offered them drinks. This all happened while I was still standing there. I was baffled by the difference in treatment.

Absolutely horrible start to my stay at this tacky hotel. American Express should remove them from their travel portal.

42,Average Hotel at Best,"The front desk was very nice and accommodating. They could not break down 20 euros into smaller  bills. Bathroom fixtures were old and stained.

42,Great hotel,"Stayed 3 nights at the Almanac Barcelona. Perfect hotel, great location, quiet, new contemporary rooms, great food, but most of all staff was terrific. In particular Joan and Tobias. Joan went above and beyond to ensure our dinner reservations including sending complimentary cocktails to our table.

Will recommend to all our friends. Thank you",5,2023,11,05
42,Fabulous hotel in a great location,Very comfortable hotel. Close to the metro and walkable to shopping and lots of sights. It was an easy Uber from the train station. We had neglected to purchase tickets for the sagrada familia and it was all sold out and the concierge helped us find a private guide and while it was more expensive it was worth it because he had late afternoon tickets to the cathedral and the light coming in through the stained glass windows at that time was incredible ,5,2023,10,31

Upon leaving our room for check out, we came across the hotel manager and she insisted on taking our bags. Incredible service and leadership. We would absolutely recommend this hotel to our family and friends. We will certainly stay here again. Outstanding hotel and staff. ",5,2023,10,25
42,Better On Social Media Than In Reality,"Just got back from almost a week in Barcelona and had a two night stay at the Almanac Hotel. Unfortunately, can't recommend this ""five star"" hotel--not worth the money even if it's somewhat reasonable compared to other hotels in a similar category in Barcelona. 

What was off? As quite a few others have mentioned--the overall air conditioning in the rooms is weak at best. If you're fine with a tepid room (not overly hot but not cool either) than you'd be fine. However, I prefer a room that can get chilly at night so I can sleep better and that doesn't seem possible here--you'll see it's a recurring theme in other reviews here on Tripadvisor. While the hotel is indeed in a convenient location to see the various parts of the city, it is nonetheless on a very, very busy street out front. The windows, while certainly double glazed can't block out all of the noise so there's a constant background noise in the room from the outside traffic. And lastly, and this is probably only to be aware of if you book through Orbitz (or Expedia) and you're a Platinum member--don't expect them to provide you with a room upgrade despite the hotel being listed as a ""VIP Access"" hotel. Despite having checked the day of my reservation to see if there were higher room categories available (there were!) I was later told that no upgrades were available. This is actually a common habit among hotels and I think it's more of the vault of Orbitz/Expedia for not having more enforcement of their policies--basically if a hotel wants to take advantage of being promoted as a ""VIP Access"" hotel on these third party websites, then Orbitz/Expedia should do a better job ensuring that hotels live up to the expectations of these agreements--as it's pretty easy to tell if a hotel truly has any upgrades available or not--just check and see what rooms are still available to be sold on the days you're staying. Not the end of the world, obviously, but then I was given what was basically an unpleasant lecture by the front desk agent upon checking out about how they hadn't provided an upgrade because they didn't have any availability, etc, etc. (Keep in mind the original front desk agent upon checking in hadn't even mentioned the reservation being through Orbitz as a Platinum member which goes to show how little this means to the hotel.) 

Any general positives here? Again, location is good, hotel is ""pretty"" (not as pretty as it comes off on their slick Instagram account or website, though) and the bellboy who helps hail cabs (with the almost Salvador Dali-style mustache) is a real pleasure to interact with! (Wish I had gotten his name.) 

Overall, not recommended. ",3,2023,10,15
42,Great hotel in the middle of Barcelona!,"Lovely hotel in the middle of Barcelona city centre! Staff are all very welcoming and ready to help you with whatever you need. If you ate looking for a 5 star personal experience, this is it! Rooms are also nice, and despite a busy road in front of the hotel, the rooms are nice and quiet for outdoor noise! Small gym but just enough to do a full workout. Spa with 2 saunas.",5,2023,10,01
42,Fantastic Hotel at City Center Barcelona,"Don't miss this wonderful hotel.  The staff is incredible, and made our trip effortless and absolutely delightful.

42,Barcelona experience,"First time in Barcelona and we stayed at the Almanac Hotel.  First room smelt like sewage on the 5th floor, they were nice to change and upgrade our room the next day. Rooms are run down, and not clean, tables and toilet seats are sticky.  Ppl in Barcelona are not very honest.  Taxi driver ripped us off thinking we are stupid tourist.  Pls be aware.  A few staff at the hotel are not helpful with dishonest taxi fare.  We are not from here and asked for their help, excuses after another .  I will not come back, ppl are rude and dishonest, feel very unsafe here.",3,2023,09,17
42,Good location in Barcelona,"First time in Barcelona. Location was great, staff very helpful and kind (Cristina super friendly and smiling at breakfast), breakfast was great with many options, room good size and bed was comfortable, bathroom good. Rooftop bar was ok, we always seemed to find the spot on the couches that were dirty and wet. Climate in room not as cool as we would like it compared to other hotels we stayed in Spain. However, good experience for our first time in Barcelona. 
",4,2023,09,16
42,Primitive ,"The hotel looks ok, but in fact service is non existent or super slow. No amenities in the bathroom - no shower Cap, no cotton buds no cotton pads, no nothing. For the amount I am paying this is ridiculous. Housekeeping is lazy and not organized! Had to clean the bathroom myself. All stained! I would not stay here next time. Paper box as a container for hair dryer, broken closet door, smelly toilet. Stained sofa, just a badly managed hotel. ",2,2023,09,15
42,Staff truly goes above and beyond!,"Staff is truly exceptional. Friendly, charismatic, helpful and professional. That is the biggest reason I'm considering coming back to this hotel. Upon arrival I had some issues with my debit- and creditcard. Quite frustrating and.. embarrasing. Yet it was handled in the nicest way. They gave me time to sort it out and in the meantime our luggage was stored and we received a voucher for the welcome drinks. So that made us feel very welcome! 

Now to nitpick: 
The pool on the rooftop is only 70 cm deep and its TINY. There is no privacy. I had planned to go up to the rooftop to cool down, have a cocktail and read a book but it was crowded with other people who had one cocktail too many. Bit obnoxious and it threw off the whole vibe. The rooftop bar is ridicously overpriced, and that comes from someone who loves to splurge. The food is so so. Staff, once again, super friendly. 
Another point of criticism is that there is no cozy lounge to chill with a book or a drink. The rooftop lounge is not it. I felt very let down by the lack of atmosphere there. 

I would consider going back because of the excellent staff, the central location and the delicous breakfast. ",4,2023,09,12
42,Perfect hotel for travel,"The hotel is good place for travel. Breakfast have lots of bread and fruits. The staffs are very kind and try to help everything. It was very nice experience. I will be back absolutely, when I visit barcelona.",5,2023,09,12
42,The Almanac is a great boutique hotel for a stay in Barcelona,"We loved staying at the hotel. The breakfast and rooftop bar were wonderful. To the person, all the staff were very professional and helpful. Irene at the front desk did a great job making (and changing!) restaurant reservations and even recommended a wonderful paper shop when I was looking for wrapping paper. The Almanac’s location is safe and convenient for walking to restaurants, shopping and visiting the Gothic quarter. We definitely look forward to staying here again the next time we visit Barcelona!",5,2023,09,08
42,An enjoyable five days in Barcelona,"The hotel rooms were very comfortable and the city views  were great. The rooftop bar afforded lovely views of the city and a very relaxing environment. The hotel is very centrally located which makes getting two sites of interest very easy. The staff was excellent and very helpful in arranging programs around the city, including wonderful dining reservations at local restaurants. Irene did a phenomenal job assisting us.",5,2023,09,08
42,Really misses the mark,"Instagram style far outweighs the substance at this pretty but underwhelming property. We had a rough start to our check-in, with no one to help with bags from the cab. We were told our room had been upgraded, and when we entered we found a beautiful multi-room suite with a lovely welcome gift, just not for us. It turns out that the hotel had accidentally left the doors open to a multi-room suite, and our room was actually just the bedroom portion. As we couldn’t reach anyone on the phone, we went down to the front desk to clarify where our room should be. In the end, they had made a mistake and an upgrade wasn’t available. On the trip back to the room, the elevator stopped twice to allow staff to board from a staff door, who couldn’t fit because of the small size. One of the women laughed and told us this happens all the time, and not to worry when the doors closed and re-opened on the staff floor a second time: it is just part of the process. After we returned to the room and closed our portion of the connecting door and started unpacking, a staff member opened our door without knocking and looked shocked to find us in the room. When we communicated all this to the front desk staff, we were told the only thing the hotel could do was consider upgrading us on another night, based on availability. Why not at least replicate the welcome gift we didn’t get? To top it off, the automatic shades in our room fully close only about 50% of the time. On the plus side, the windows in the rooms are huge and gorgeous and the bed is the most comfortable we’ve slept in on this trip. Overall, we’re disappointed we left the other Amex Fine Hotels property we were staying at in the city, which was relaxing, warm, and professional, all things lacking from the Almanac.",2,2023,09,03
42,Great Hotel Friendly Staff,"Everyone at the hotel was ""over the top"" friendly and very helpful.  Location was great with easy walking to many of the sights in Barcelona.  Breakfast buffet was very tasty and delicious.  Great recommendations from staff for local restaurants.",5,2023,08,29
42,Unbelievable Hotel and Staff - Loved It,"Unbelievable staff and unbelievable hotel. Helped make all of our reservations and had great recommendations for places to go and things to do and see. Beds were very comfortable, bathrooms were luxurious, and hotel all around far exceeded our expectations. Cannot recommend the hotel enough. Not to mention the cleaning staff did a bang up job and even came back to make sure their services were up to our standards. Rooftop bar was beautiful with great views and the restaurant in the hotel served great breakfast and cocktails. Will 100% stay here again when I return to Barcelona. ",5,2023,08,29
42,UNBEARABLE HEAT,"This review is hard to write because the people are great, the hotel is beautiful, amenities are wonderful but it is unbearable to sleep at night. We have complained over and over again that our AC is broken, our room is currently 85 degrees Fahrenheit. We asked them to fix it and after days they still have not. I am not looking forward to returning to the hotel room tonight because I know I will not be able to sleep for the 5th night in a row.",1,2023,08,24
42,Unbearably hot room,"Our room here is unbearably hot, 28C (about 85F) during the day. We have been calling the front desk and maintenance for 3 days, and each time they say the issue is fixed and it has not been. This has made it impossible for us to be in our room and to sleep at night. Please see the picture - the thermostat is set to 15C, and the actual temperature is 28C. This would be ok if this was a hostel at hostel prices, but it is not. The people working here are nice, but nothing has been done to address this situation. ",1,2023,08,24
42,Good location,"Hotel has a good location, however the rooms were designed in a very modern minimalistic style. I love modern style, but the bathrooms absolutely must have shelves and hooks, there was literary no space to put a make bag or hang the towels. That made our entire stay very inconvenient. The storage area also not designed smart. All our stuff were around the room on the floors. 
They do have a nice rooftop bar. I would not stay here again only because of how unsmart the design of the room was. Beautiful rooms, just no storage ",3,2023,08,16
42,ALL INCLUSIVE!,Amazing hotel. From the front desk to the housekeeping to the amazing service staff. I recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The buffet breakfast was amazing. I only have praise for this hotel. ,5,2023,08,16
42,Amazing,Brian and Irene were the best at the front desk. They located places to eat - showed us how to get there and were helpful in organizing taxis for various events. We are very appreciative of there willingness to help and make our stay enjoyable.,5,2023,08,11
42,First time in Barcelona,"This was a quick first time trip to Barcelona with my 15yo son. The room was spacious and very nice. They staff were the most amazing part, especially Irene and Brian at the front desk took care of our every need. The daily breakfast was perfect, rooftop bar is beautiful,   and the location of the hotel was centrally located to all the city has to offer. I will absolutely stay here again on my 2nd trip to Barcelona!",5,2023,08,11
42,Amazing!,Amazing service and lovely hotel and rooms! Central location within walking distance to all of the great things Barcelona has to offer! Beautiful rooftop with delicious tapas and drinks. Would definitely stay there again! ,5,2023,08,08
42,Best Stay of Our Lives,We're extensive travelers and can easily say this is the best stay we've ever experienced. Every employee went above and beyond. The hotel and room are absolutely gorgeous. The rooftop bar and pool is OUTSTANDING. We used the sauna which was fabulous. We ate breakfast at Virens and have never had such a great breakfast anywhere. ,5,2023,08,08
42,"Excellent location, and service","This was our first stay at the Almanac Barcelona. The hotel is in an excellent location within easy walking distance to the main streets amenities and attractions. The hotel staff is efficient friendly and extremely accommodating. The hotel room is extremely comfortable and well appointed, we had an issue with a fuse tripping requiring one of the staff members to come up in the middle of the night to reset the fuse but otherwise this was a minor issue and didn't affect our enjoyment of the hotel. Their breakfast buffet is fabulous the hotel staff was extremely helpful when we wanted directions or recommendations around the hotel. ",5,2023,08,08
42,If your coming to Barcelona this is the hotel to stay at p,"I want to start off with my first experience as we arrived in Barcelona at the hotel.  Bryan Llamuca was the first person at the hotel I met.  He is a fantastic person and a great hard worker.  When we approached the hotel him and the other staff were FAST to approach our taxi and help with anything we needed.  We had only been in Barcelona for an hour and it was already a fantastic experience.  After checking in we went to get breakfast which was absolutely fantastic in ever way.  Service was top notch.  Food was amazing.  Living up to its Michelin star rating.  We enjoyed everything the hotel had to offer.  The rooftop bar/grill was fantastic.  The service up there was great fast and friendly.  We enjoyed it during the day and at night and both of which were fantastic.  We then had dinner at the restaurant which was absolutely incredible.  Food was fantastic and the presentation was the best I’ve ever seen.  The appetizers, main, and dessert all fantastic.  Service again amazing.  The following day we had to leave to head to our cruise.  The rooms were absolutely incredible in this hotel and we did not want to leave.  When we checked out Bryan was fantastic as always.  His smile and great attitude made checking in and out great.  What a great person this hotel should be proud to have him.  All the staff took such pride and care in everything they do.  We left with the most fantastic time and memories at this hotel.",5,2023,08,05
42,Possibly the best hotel experience I’ve had,I simply cannot say enough about the incredible service I received at this magnificent hotel. The concierge and entire front desk team made my solo trip truly incredible. I felt genuinely cared for…it was lovely!  The rooftop bar provides breathtaking views of the city I fell in love with in a very short time! My love for Barcelona was magnified greatly as a result of the care and service provided by the almanac Barcelona team! ,5,2023,08,01
42,Amazing experience…. One of the best hotel experiences.,The staff was amazing and took care of all our needs.  They were always willing to help with reservations and taxis.  The rooms were excellent and comfortable.  The design of the hotel and the rooms were amazing.  The breakfast was incredible that included honeycomb honey. This will be our go to destination  in barcelona from now on!,5,2023,08,01
42,The perfect hotel in a majestic city.,"Incredible hotel. Every details is perfectly thought out. The service is absolutely incredible, the staff are professional, as well as very warm and friendly, the rooms are gorgeous and extremely comfortable, and all the amenities are exquisite. Will absolutely be staying there again the next time I am in Barcelona.",5,2023,08,01
42,the Place to Stay,"Our experience while staying at the Almanac was amazing. The staff was welcoming, helpful & friendly. The hotel is beautiful, the food at both restaurants on the property was delicious, & the location is perfect to see all the sites of Barcelona. ",5,2023,07,31
42,Almost a five-star experience.,"This is almost a 5-star hotel.  It has minor lapses but the staff works hard and always tries to please.  Our airport pickup was botched and no one at the hotel had confirmed with the service it uses that the pickup was proceeding as planned.  But once we made it to the hotel our experience was very good.  There were minor disappointments, such as dinner at Virens where the menu is very quirky and choices that appealed to us were limited.  Food selections on the rooftop were also limited.  And there are only two English-language TV channels: Sky News and BBC News; no CNN, no CNBC, etc.  On the other hand, the location is very central, the hotel is new and clean, the windows are sealed well so the rooms are very quiet, and the air conditioning works like a charm which us, obviously, very important in July.  Again, the staff is excellent.",5,2023,07,25
42,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"Everything is nearly perfect, room is tastefully designed, clean and spacious.  Location is the best, breakfast is great, we love this hotel very much.  Check in experiment was great, staffs are attentive and patient. The hotel is nicely designed, room is really tidy and clean. ",5,2023,07,24
42,Great location!,"We had a fantastic experience in this hotel! The location it’s great we walked everywhere, the rooftop views are beautiful. Staff very attentive, great breakfast. Nice decorated rooms. We’re traveling with kids, they accommodated all our needs. We’ll be back",5,2023,07,20
42,Look No Further. This is the Right Hotel for You,"I rarely take the time to write reviews and travel often. We stay in upscale hotels and these days -since COVID- I'm underwhelmed. Places are understandably short staffed but I'm paying more than ever.
Hence, I've not written any reviews for hotels until now.
This place though exceeded my expectations in every way. Beautiful and thoughtful design. Excellent service and food. Perfect location. Exceptional value. Look no further.",5,2023,07,15
42,BUGS IN THE BREAKFAST!,"STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!  The hotel is very modern, the location is great, and the staff is friendly, but there are lots of little flying bugs all over the bar area where the breakfast pastries are and in the dining room where the fruit is. I stayed here with my wife and kids for 4 days, and each morning the bugs were all over.  This is not a 5-star hotel.  The main issue with this hotel is the awful air conditioning system.  You can set the room temperature as low as you want, which is amazing, BUT the hotel computer system resets the room temperature after 1 or 2 hours, so it is ALWAYS HOT in the room!  This is an issue for any traveler who needs a cool temperature for a good sleep.",1,2023,07,12
42,Great hotel in a central location,Great hotel in a great location. Decor is a tad dated but very well maintained. Rooms are compact but typical European style hotel.  Rooftop bar service was lousy on two occasions but views from there are great.,4,2023,07,09
42,Great location,"This is a very nice boutique hotel in a great location.  We felt we could walk everywhere.  The bellman, front desk team and concierge team were excellent and very helpful.  Our room was terrific.  We enjoyed both the restaurant and the roof top.  Food was very good but they are still working on the service for breakfast.  Great neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and shopping.  Overall a top experience and We would recommend this hotel for couples.
",5,2023,07,07
42,Perfect Location and Exceptional Staff,The Almanac is centrally located in the heart of Barcelona near the high end shopping district. The team does and exceptional job with service and making your stay perfect. We would highly recommend the Almanac to those looking for a relaxed yet refined experience in the city.,5,2023,06,29
42,Short visit to Barcelona,"Everything and everyone was amazing, very friendly, informative, and accommodating, the food was also amazing. The rooftop bar/pool and view are amazing. The location couldn't be better. I would definitely stay there again and will recommend it to anyone. 5 STARS!!!",5,2023,06,28
42,High-end modern luxury & great service,"Very modern hotel with breathtaking room views, excellent service, and a fantastic restaurant. 

Terrible, unusable gym (so if you want to workout don't come here). See below. 

We came here at the tail end of our honeymoon and were impressed. The rooms are gorgeous with wall-sized windows providing views of the city. Modern, luxury everything...down to lights in the toilet, dual sinks, and an amazing shower. 

Rooftop bar offers views of Barcelona and good bartender service...

The breakfast is really good - maybe one of the best ever for a hotel. If you have the full breakfast included, order from the a la carte menu as the chef will delight your senses. Portions are small though so if you didn't get the unlimited breakfast...it can get pricy fast. I ordered 2 or 3 of the scrambled eggs from their menu for a regular-sized portion and that would have been over 30 euros by itself.

The restaurant is highly acclaimed as well and I encourage guests to visit. The chef and staff are amazing.

Problems during our stay:
* our key cards stopped working during our stay...
* room service kept trying to come in to clean our room twice after it was already cleaned (and we told them so) 
* room AC did not seem to work. It couldn't get our room under 21C even if we set it to it's minimum (10C). It never got cold and I had trouble sleeping. 

Suggestions for hotel:
* add casting to room TVs. Most other 4 and 5 star hotels we stay at have this. You bought the best OLED TVs but guests cannot cast Netflix, Disney, or YouTube from a phone. 
* redo the gym. The gym is a joke and unusable. For a 5 star hotel, putting the gym in a small, single, hot room underground with no windows is awful. The equipment was broken and cluttered. It feels like the gym is there just to satisfy the requirement of having one to get the 5th star for the hotel. You can't actually use it. The hotel is so nice otherwise that having a ""gym"" that bad feels out of place. At the very least keep the equipment working and keep the room ice cold (17-19C). It shouldn't be 25C+ with no one there. If you want to impress hotel guests, move the gym above the lobby somewhere with a window and keep it clean, cold, and working. ",4,2023,06,26
42,"Modern hotel, poor standards.","Firstly the few positives. Generally modern hotel. Well located and staff are generally polite. There’s a nice rooftop bar area and the breakfast was quite good. 

Now all the negatives including some atrocious occurrences. 

While the suite (206) was acceptably modern, there were many impractical things. The bed was too soft for my liking. The lighting system was not good. Controls were too crude. 

The worst was the toilet. It got stuck and was never resolved despite me complaining 3 times to the staff at reception! Unacceptable. I ended up sleeping through a night with a toilet that wasn’t working properly! Imagine that in a do-called 5 star luxury hotel! 

Housekeeping was sloppy and inconsistent. On one day it was fine. On other days it was not complete. On my last day I had specifically asked for a room cleaning to be done at 5 pm which was not done. 

I cannot recommend this hotel. For hundreds of euros per night, you should expect much better.",1,2023,06,25
42,"Nice hotel, Perfect location",Staff always willing tô help. Really good service at front desk and helpers. Nice rooftop with music. The location is really The best. Really good breakfast with good variety. Definatly my hotel In Barcelona ,5,2023,06,24

42,The best hotel in Barcelona. Right in the thick of it yet super quiet!,"This place is BEAUTIFUL!!! The rooms, the beds, the shower and the message was FANTASTIC!!! You must stay here. The surprise when you walk in made me so happy. The curtains!!!! The whole team is super accommodating and happy all the time! ",5,2023,06,20
42,Trusted hotel in Barcelona,Good hotel with a great location. The staff always helpful with recommendations especially Sebiana. The butler Ahmed was always happy to greet the guests and helpful.  The room is modern equipped with bidet and the view is amazing. Highly recommended. ,5,2023,06,13
42,Boutique luxury with attention to details,"Had a very pleasant stay at Almanac, attention to details both looking at interior and service. Felt at home, comfy yet luxorious. Nice rooftop terrace, good food and excellent breakfast - all for a very reasonable price comparing other 5* hotels in BCN some of which feels outdated. ",5,2023,06,07
42,In the heart of Barcelona,The Almanac Hotel is in the heart of Barcelona. Walking distance to almost everything. The room and staff were amazing. The dinner at Virens was a very special experience. The flavors were amazing. Breakfast staff were extremely attentive. We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Barcelona. ,5,2023,05,25
42,Excellent Hotel ,Excellent stay! Room is cutting edge. Would definitely stay here again. Located central to everything in Barcelona. Easy walk to busses and taxis. Staff is very attentive and came to help with our problems immediately.,5,2023,05,24
42,5-Star Boutique Hotel,"First time in Barcelona, and this boutique hotel set the bar high.  Modern, upscale property just a couple blocks outside of the ""touristy"" zone. The staff is Fantastic! Check-in was a breeze.  Love that the property is a smaller one with only 30 rooms. The rooftop bar and pool are very peaceful and serene - a beautiful spot to relax and enjoy a sangria.  The on-site restaurant is also incredibly nice and has a diverse menu that can accommodate different types of diets.  Also worth noting is that there is a convenient Metro entrance a block from the hotel entrance.",5,2023,05,20
42,Amazing service and beautiful hotel!,"We absolutely LOVED the Almanac hotel in Barcelona! The service was top notch, rooms were beautiful and the property has everything you need. When we arrived early, they took us to a room where we could shower and relax. After we were done, they held our bags and we headed out for the day. Our room was incredible and had all the bells and whistles. The concierge was amazing and helped us get hard to get tickets and rearranged things to accommodate for us. The rooftop bar was such a nice place to hang out and drinks were delicious! The location was great to get all over the city and the staff were all so helpful and knowledgeable. Breakfast and all service was top notch, if only there were more Almanac hotels! We can't wait to come back!",5,2023,05,20
42,A wonderful hotel,"After staying in old palaces and convents in Spain the Almanac seemed too modern   But it turned out to be wonderful   The staff was incredible   Friendly and helpful 
The room is high tech with shades opening on coming into the room  and ever controlled electronically 
The bed was large   Called a twin but two beds together   And very comfortable 
A wonderful location near the main square   Walkable to almost everything ",5,2023,05,16
42,Amazing hotel and fantastic staff,"We had an amazing stay at the Almanac. From the moment we arrived to time we left every staff member was truly excellent. 

We were in Barcelona to see Bruce Springsteen- the front of house team organised a car to drop off and pick up. 

Excellent service - would highly recommend ",5,2023,05,11
42,Amazing location!,"You can't beat the location of the hotel, walking distance to great restaurant, shopping and bars. We had a little issue while checking in, but once we were past that we had an overall great experience. Great property, maybe in need of some work in the rooms.",4,2023,05,03
42,Stunning,A perfect stay in Barcelona.  Great roof top pool and bar.  Staff was perfect.  Hotel was clean and in a perfect location.  It's a new hotel maybe 5 years (but with Covid inbetween).  It was just perfect.  We met some great people at the rooftop bar and pool.  Food was great and everyone was accommodating at all time. ,5,2023,05,03
42,Classy hotel,"We had a very nice stay in this classy hotel. Restaurant, service and food all very good. Location is excellent. There was a drain problem problem which could not be solved but they acknowledged it and did their best to solve it. ",5,2023,04,30
42,excellent stay,"excellent structure for a family long weekend. perfect room in terms of both size/decor and amenities. fantastic staff, extremely kind, welcoming and efficient. beautiful location, close (walking distance) to many major tourist attractions and main shopping areas, well connected to public transportation network. very good breakfast for quality and variety of offer",5,2023,04,27
42,Lacking in service,"Centrally located. Great rooms. But seriously misses the mark on service. 
I notified the hotel prior to my visit that I would be arriving around 10 AM. I realize that this is well before check in time, but wanted to let them know just in case a room became available. When I arrived, the room was not ready, so I stored my luggage and went for a walk. I came back to the hotel five hours later and my room was still not ready. Official check in time is at 3 o’clock. My room was not ready at 3 o’clock and Brian at the front desk didn’t really seem to care. He repeatedly told me that they had a lot of guests checking out.  It seems strange to me that they would not prioritize the guests that arrived earlier in the day to check in first and have their rooms cleaned.
When I finally got up into my room, I was happy to see how nice it was. The rooms have a lot of bells and whistles. 
When I went into the bathroom, I noticed it had not been cleaned. There was still garbage in the garbage can and drips of residue on the floor. Gross. 
The next morning, I went to breakfast, and it was very nice. They have lots of food options . But again, service lacked. I asked three times for coffee creamer and finally received it well after I finished my breakfast, and my beverage was lukewarm. This hotel has so much potential. It just didn’t do it for me.",3,2023,04,24
42,Amazing Hotel In Barcelona,"We absolutely loved the Almanac Hotel in Barcelona. Fabulous location, incredible service, beautiful room and amazing daily breakfast. We were also upgraded to a 1BR unit on arrival, which was a nice surprise. Great rooftop bar as well!",5,2023,04,22
42,Fine Quarters,"The Almanac is a first class hotel in every respect.  Spacious rooms which are immaculately clean.  Friendly staff that provide excellent service. While this hotel is pricey, you do in fact get what you pay for.  Very scenic view. ",5,2023,04,20
42,Friendly staff and modern accommodations,"This hotel has excellent service, friendly staff, great amenities such as bidet toilet, strong water pressure, nice sheets, modern technology for adjusting lights, curtain shades, rooftop bar with pool. Great location, near subway stations and easy to get from here to all the city attractions. Safe neighborhood. Would recommend to my family and friends.",5,2023,04,16
42,Relaxing time,"It is a beautiful hotel in a nice part of town. Very clean. Friendly staff. I enjoyed my stay here. Easy to walk to different parts of town. The breakfast buffet was also very nice with fresh produce, nice cheese selection, and a grill. Would come back again.",5,2023,04,13
42,Beautiful hotel in convenient neighborhood,"Modern stylish hotel.   Pleasing ambience.     Clean lovely rooms.    Friendly staff who go out of their way to ensure comfort of guests.   We were there for seven nights and it was a delightful home away from home. 
Convenient location to shopping and restaurants.    Easy access to major sights of interest to tourists",5,2023,04,12
42,Post Cruise Stay,"Stay was very nice, very modern chic rooms with city views. Hotel touts a rooftop pool however,  This isn’t really of a pool, more of a light plunge. There is an intimate bar and tapas nook on rooftop for trendy social drinking. The hotel’s vegan restaurant, on floor 1, is open all day, but breakfast is a must here; it was included with our trip. They have fresh pastries, breads, vegan sausages, cheeses, cashew butter, but you can request omelets, pancakes, or crepes  etc. There are fresh juices, espresso, latte, etc.

Overall, we had a very pleasant experience 😊",5,2023,04,07
42,The Almanac was amazing,"Absolutely fabulous stay at this modern amazing detail oriented hotel!
The staff is wonderful and so helpful and nice!!
The lobby is beautiful and our room was fantastic. Loved the chaise that was in the window!!!
Literally EVERY detail has been meticulously thought out in the design of each aspect of the hotel, rooms and all decor and it shows in all the best ways!!! Everything is done with the consideration of making sure we had a restful and zen break in our “oasis” of a room. Fabulously comfy bed! Great lighting!!!
Love the bathroom…love the electric shades and having everything at your bedside electronically!!!!
The breakfast buffet was excellent!!!!

I had an issue with a piece of medical equipment and the staff went above and beyond to help me!! I was so appreciative of their caring and trying to find a solution and understanding that it was important that I get it fixed… you all were outstanding!!!!

The location is the best!!!
Walking distance to everything and lots of easy places to go and grab a bite close by too!!!!

Barcelona is always one of our favorite cities and now the Almanac is our favorite hotel in Barcelona!!!
Thank you for an amazing stay",5,2023,04,06
42,Glitchy in room system,"Woken up at 6am by room systems refresh, lights flashing. Took photo of the control panel. At checkout the manager said there is nothing they can do. Completely ruined my jet lag schedule. The breakfast was good but roof top bar didn’t have enough server.",1,2023,04,04
42,Great Location,Great staff and location!!! Very clean and confortable !!! Wasn’t sure were to stay and luckily found this spot. Walking distance to everything. Will definitely be back to this spot again. Staff was extra friendly with great recommendations.,5,2023,04,01
42,Perfect choice for Barcelona visit,"Everything about the Almanac was perfect. The room was large, bright, clean and so beautifully decorated and appointed. Cleaning service came twice a day and anything we needed was provided. The public areas were also clean and welcoming - the lobby, rooftop bar. Cleanliness reflects care and attention to details; many 5 star hotels still aren’t clean and free of dust. We ate breakfast every day at the restaurant and it was the best I’ve had in Europe. Lots of vegan/organic options, beautiful local cheeses, fresh squeezed juices, local options and a full hot menu with perfectly cooked eggs, etc. The full hotel staff was friendly, helpful, professional. The hotel location was great with easy access to shopping, cultural sites. Although on a busy street, the room was quiet. We were able to use public transportation easily and walk everywhere from the central location. It has the coziness of a boutique hotel with the amenities of a large hotel, e.g, spa. I will return to the Almanac and strongly recommend choosing for a business or leisure stay. I had to work a little, and internet was fast and reliable, room set up allowed me to sit comfortably with a chair and table. The bar tender/manager was welcoming and mixed creative cocktails and gave us lots of recommendations of things to see and do. I am a critical traveler and I cannot find one thing that disappointed me about my stay.",5,2023,03,31
42,5 star luxury from start to finish!,"Great hotel and real 5 star. Best bed, in any hotel, we have ever slept in! We had lunch which was excellent, and cocktails on the rooftop terrace. All in all, a great experience. Staff were all helpful and courteous. Location is very central.",5,2023,03,27
42,A fun-filled weekend in Barcelona ,"An outstanding stay - fabulous service from start to finish. Highlights: 

1. Amazing corner room - blinds that adjust when you come in / out, super comfortable bed, plenty of water, powerful shower, great toiletries

2. Rooftop bar - simply stunning views and a great place for a glass or two of local red wine - recommend the vegan burger

3. Virens - lovely breakfast and the catalan cheeseboard is a must-try in the afternoon

4. Location - 2 min from all the shops and the underground station 

5. Staff - always smiling, helped flag taxis and explained local places to visit. I enjoyed meeting the intern in the team. 

I would def come back and would highly recommend the hotel. ",5,2023,03,16
42,Perfect night's sleep,"We were fortunate enough to have been upgraded from a junior suite to the Almanac suite thanks to the courtesy of the reservations manager after having postponed (rather than cancel) a reservation made just prior to pandemic restrictions preventing travel. 
The room was perfect in every way, including layout, functionality, and views.  There was nothing to fault with the room (and my wife and I frequently stay in 5 star suites). In particular, sleeping conditions were ideal, with electronic blackout curtains, a warm and cosy bed, absolute silence, and a useful toilet bowl light as a simple guide for midnight visits.
We would definitely stay again.",5,2022,12,29
42,Best Hotel Stay Ever,"Realized I never reviewed this hotel from a stay back a long while ago, but wanted to add to the list of glowing reviews. It's quite literally the best hotel stay I've ever had...and I travel A LOT. Decided to stay an extra day in Barcelona after a group trip ended and treated myself to a night here and it was worth every single penny. The service was impeccable with candy and water during check in, personal escort to my room with demonstrations on how to use the curtains/technology/fancy toilet, bed made every time I left the room, and taxi transport to the airport scheduled. Absolutely gorgeous room with a heavenly bed, plush robe and slippers, free drink ticket for the upstairs bar, and a beautiful view from both my room and the upstairs bar/pool. It even smelled amazing! Wishing I had toiletries, candles, and room spray of whatever that signature scent was because it was the best. Also had an incredible multi course dinner in the hotel restaurant and breakfast before leaving--delicious and gorgeous presentation. When I come back to Barcelona this will absolutely be where I stay and can't recommend it enough.",5,2022,12,08
42,Family trip to Barcelona,"Really liked hotel and great central location. Rooms were modern, light, comfortable beds and had good noise reduction even though we were facing a busy street. Staff spoke wonderful English and they were very helpful with emails pre arrival and during our stay.  Definitely would stay again.",5,2022,11,28
42,Overall experience was excellent,"The location of the hotel is perfect to reach any place near by.

The restaurant Virens offers really good lunch and dinner selections. The breakfast has gluten free section.

I stayed in the suite 110, the room was nice and very comfortable.",5,2022,11,22
42,Excellent stay in Barcelona,"Staying at the Almanac Barcelona was an amazing experience. 
The hotel staff was friendly, prompt, and very responsive to requests.
The quality and cleanliness of the rooms was fantastic. The windows were well sound proofed, making for a calm and comfortable stay.
We loved the hotel rooftop bar and restaurant. The food was great and catered to a wide array of tastes.
The location was perfect for those who want to explore what Barcelona has to offer, with close proximity to attractions, the main streets, and metro lines.
We will be staying here again on our next trip to the city.",5,2022,11,16
42,Amazing,Amazing overall! Staff was incredible-very very friendly and helpful. Also arranged a car to pick us up and take us to the shopping outlets which was lovely. Breakfast was also very yummy. Highly recommend! ,5,2022,11,16
42,Excellent Hotel in the heart of Barca,"This is truly a luxurious hotel with exquisite rooms and great friendly staff. Location was perfect and there are tons of restuarants and bars in walking distance. The rooms was great , big and clean!",5,2022,11,12
42,Spectacular!,"We were very impressed with all aspects of our stay at the Almanac. From the smooth checkin, to the attentive service, to the array of automated technology provided in our room, no detail was missed. Even though we had a very early checkout the next morning, we were greeted at the lobby with a taxi waiting for our luggage to be sure our flight was not missed. Amazing stay. Can't wait to return!",5,2022,11,07
42,Top Quality Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a couple of days in October.  The hotel was arranged by our cruise line.  It was top quality in every way and worth every penny.  The location was perfect for shopping and restaurants.  The staff were all very friendly and extremely accommodating.  We've stayed at many hotels with free breakfasts, but this was many steps above what we had experienced before. I highly recommend staying at this hotel.  ",5,2022,11,06
42,Great location and nice staff,I liked the location and its great if you want to do a lot of shopping and be close to several Gaudi attractions. The staff were very friendly. Breakfast had excellent quality food and friendly staff as well. The roof top bar was nice for a drink but the food was just ok. I would stay here again.,5,2022,10,31
42,Wonderful location and experience,Our 4 day stay was memorable. The hotel is in an excellent location and the staff are attentive.  Our dinner in Virens was a great introduction to experience a vegan meal. Would recommend to anyone visiting BCN. ,5,2022,10,29
42,WOW - Great location and Service,"Such a modern hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  Exceeded expectations.  Many technological advantages. (Automatic electric blinds, Mini Fridge, large bathroom, cell phone for hotel phone, variable lighting)   Great view from the rooftop Bar.  Exception staff.",5,2022,10,28
42,Disappointed,This was disappointing experience.  Stayed 2 nights.  The room is small no table provided for luggage.  The toilet is badly ventilated and right near the room door.  No turn down service so no new towels.  All of ours were sodden messes on the floor mopping up water from the shower.   Not worth the money,2,2022,10,27
42,Great hotel in a great location.,"The room was spacious, clean, and really important for me, it was quiet.  The hotel staff are friendly, courteous, and attentive.  We were within walking distance to many major sights.  This is a great hotel in a great location.",5,2022,10,25
42,Phenomenal!,"Amazing staff, great food, and beautiful rooms. Our flight out of Barcelona was cancelled, and it was an easy decision to stay another night since we got to stay at the Almanac. The staff was super accommodating and helpful with this! The rooms were very comfortable and lovely to stay in.",5,2022,10,21
42,Fantastic Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Almanac prior to a cruise.  It was the perfect way to start our trip.  I have never had such amazing service from hotel staff.  My husband's mobility scooter was destroyed by a cab driver on the first day of our vacation.  The hotel: got us  a free wheelchair from a hotel that they work with, had their mechanic try to fix it, called a scooter company to try help us buy one within 48 hours, contacted DHL to get a quote to ship it back to the US, and held it for us for weeks while we dealt with our insurance company to decide if we should ship it.

I would have rated the Almanac 5 stars without all of the above.  The room was great... good size, with a nice view and a king sized bed.. The complimentary hot breakfast was excellent as was the restaurant for dinner.  They pleasantly booked tickets for us to tour.  They jumped to call cabs for us.  The location is perfect, very near La Familia Sagrada.  Really I cannot say enough.  I am absolutely committed to staying there again if i ever return to Barcelona.  I certainly hope I do. ",5,2022,10,19
42,Stunning & Great Staff!,From the moment we stepped out of the cab in Barcelona we were greeted by the lovely concierge they took the best care of us! We were visiting for a friends wedding and had the welcome party at the Almanac which was stunning! Such a memorable experience! Great trip me and my husband will definitely be back again soon! Thank you <3,5,2022,10,18
42,Great Hotel,"The hotel was great!  Our room had a nice view, was clean and is pretty high tech (blinds that go up and down will wall mounted digital screens). I’d make one recommendation to travelers which is to use their concierge service.  They are especially helpful in booking reservations, etc. ",5,2022,10,18
42,Fantastic Luxury Hotel in Barcelona,"This was an Outstanding Hotel In Every way! Room, little extras, friendly staff all combined to make this one of our favorite hotel experiences in Europe. The breakfast was amazing and the concierge recommendations were great. The front desk did everything possible to accommodate our requests.",5,2022,10,11
42,Wonderful experience,"This was one of my favourite hotel experience that I’ve ever had. Ver comfortable rooms, nice location and everything I look for in a hotel. Nothing I would change, if in Barcelona again, would definitely stay here.",5,2022,10,08
42,"We left 2 days early, not a good experience","We did not have a good experience at this hotel.   Our room was not ready when we arrived after check-in at 4:00.  Our bags were not taken to the room once the room was ready,  we had to go get them.  It felt like they forgot about us after they told us to go to the upper lounge for a drink (not a complimentary drink).

There was no top sheet on the bed!  They also have the thermostats set so they don't cool the room below 70 and the only cover on the bed was a thick comforter.  It was hot in the room in September!
Our room was a standard balcony room ($465.00 nightly rate)and did not have any of bathroom amenities except soap and lotion.    Also the balcony door did not open.    We stayed in 8 different resorts through our travels in Spain and Portugal and we received very nice bathroom amenities, toothbrush, shaver, q tips, etc., in all the other hotel/resorts we visited.   We also received torn bath towel!   

This hotel was the worst experience of any of the other 8 resorts/hotels we visited throughout Spain and Portugal.    We were told ""you Americans are the only ones that complain about not having a top sheet"".     I've read they don't always wash the thick comforters after every guest. 

We booked 5 nights and left after 3.

On a positive note, the breakfast was very good with lots of variety and good service.    The location was good it you want to be located in a very busy and congested area.

The one employee that was outstanding was NELSON!    He is the one that gets 5-STARS at this hotel.",2,2022,10,07
42,Luxury in a beautiful hotel,The room was spotless and well appointed with a Juliette balcony. The bed was quite comfy. Everything is run through an app on the bedside tablet. The service at the front desk was lacking. The service in the roof top bar was also severley slow. The food was nothing spectacular.  ,4,2022,10,04
42,Great location,Easy walkable access to most locations. Hotel was clean and surprisingly quiet even though it’s on a corner of a busy street. Many gadgets in room but we had to play around with them to get them to work properly.,4,2022,10,02
42,Disappointing,For the prices they underserved.  The room was nice and clean but things were broken in the room that they did not notify me about or not there at all like the in door dining menu or any access to one and the 14/7 concierge service was non existent...and I mean non existent.  You had to go down to the front desk to get that service as sending them an email was useless.,3,2022,10,02
42,Short stay in Barcelona,"Lovely hotel to stay in, everything about the Almanac oozes quality. Staff were always attentive and helpful. Roof top pool and bar was a nice place to spend an afternoon, though service was no comparison to the rest of the hotel and could be improved.
Overall would recommend the Almanac. ",5,2022,09,30
42,Barcelona experience,"Absolutely amazing experience. The hotel is a 10/10, from amenities, friendly staff, location, the design of the rooms, the beds are comfortable and great dining options! My first time in Barcelona was memorable for sure. ",5,2022,09,30
42,Fantastic hotel,"Wonderful room with everything controlled at the touch of a button and a very comfortable bed.  The concierge service was incredible.  Very helpful and attentive to your needs.  The food and drink were first class.  The rooftop bar has a nice ambience to it and the view is terrific.  The location is also very good, with excellent restaurant's, bars, and points of interest all within walking distance.  Ideal for a long weekend stay!",5,2022,09,26
42,"Great rooms, location, and staff","We stayed here 4 nights. The rooms were very updated and tech-centric. The walk-in rain shower was lovely and the bath products provided were top notch. The bed was very comfortable! The quietness of the rooms was impressive given the hotel is located on a very lively street---could not hear anything inside the room. The service at the hotel was exceptional and everyone was always smiling. Definitely go have drinks on the rooftop, but most importantly, have dinner at the hotel restaurant Virens----truly exceptional all around. The location of the hotel is prime and very convenient to buses and trains. Lots of upscale shopping and dining all around---very walkable. Would 100% suggest you stay here while in Barcelona. ",5,2022,09,26
42,Terrible service,Emailed weeks ahead asking for early check in. Ordered a car from them to pick us up at the airport after trans Atlantic overnight flight. So concierge knew what time we were arriving. Was informed on arrival there is no early check in. Arrived at 11:30. Now 2:15. Still waiting for our room to be ready. Hotel has made zero effort to accommodate us. Hoping to spend day in Barcelona. But unfortunately still waiting for a shower. So day is a waste.,1,2022,09,23
42,Excellent breakfast buffet,"Excellent breakfast buffet! Very nice, clean room. Attentive staff. Rooftop bar and menu is a nice touch. Great location near many shops, attractions and Hop-on; Hop-off busses. Average value - a bit pricey.",4,2022,09,22
42,Best hotel stuff,"The hotel is in excellent location, it has well designed rooms, roof top bar and dipping pool ( its shallow but its very nice especially during hot wether) with loungers, bar service and outdoor shower. Great spot to cool off and unwind. But the best asset of this hotel is the hotel stuff, always courteous and very helpful. My suitcase was lost by the airline and 
Guest Relations representative Amaya Villullas went above and beyond to help me to get my suitcase back: she filled out lost luggage form and kept pressure on the airline customer service to ensure that my bag was found and sent to the hotel. She was very warm, kind and reassuring during this stressful time. 
",5,2022,09,22
42,"Very nice hotel, short walk from Rambla and shops.","Very nice hotel, great bed and linen, very technical and efficent in the room, blackout electric curtains. Seperate wc and shower rooms.  Great concierge service.  So highly reccomend it, also great rooftop bar and small pool.  ",5,2022,09,19
42,Beautiful but overpriced for service price,"The hotel is beautiful, rooms super clean, great technologies (when they work) and the rooftop pool is stunning with sunset views. 

We couldn’t get hold of reception from our room and breakfast was poor.",3,2022,09,13
42,Amazing!,"The location is excellent, the staff is very cordial and friendly. The rooms are very clean and modern setting. I would definitely recommend this place. The breakfast is excellent. The roof top is nice. ",5,2022,09,08
42,"Great stay, great location","The Almanac is located close to old town, which is a must do in Barcelona.walkable to the Sagrada, Casa Milos and Casa Batillo, all within  a mile and the Picasso museum.
Staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooftop bar had excellent cocktails with views of theSagrada.",5,2022,09,03
42,Must stay here,"We enjoyed everything about this place. Room was great, very high tech. Rooftop was very nice.  Bed and sheets were very comfortable. Breakfast was very good and location was terrific. Highly recommend ",5,2022,08,31
42,Great location and service,"Centrally located modern hotel. Accommodating and kind service, could not be happier with this stay for our 48 hours in Barcelona! The hotel is located on the main shopping area and is also very close to the Gaudi museum.",5,2022,08,29
42,Almanac Barcelona,Went to Barcelona for a 5 day get away. Can not say enough about my experience at the Almanac Hotel. The staff was AMAZING and the accommodations were too. The rooftop bar was an added bonus at the end of a wonderful day. ,5,2022,08,28
42,Great hotel with some minor service issues,"Beautifully designed hotel. We stayed in the terrace suite which was great as it had a nice outdoor area where you can tan. The room was comfortable and high-tech functionality was great. Food was great from breakfast to room service. 

The reason why I did not give it a 5-star rating is:
- pool service: we used the pool on the first day we got there. We got there at 10am (that’s when the pool opens) however there was no one there to give us towels to serve us. The pool man was still cleaning the pool and he finished around 1045. When we asked if we can order water we were told that the pool service starts at 12pm. We felt this wasn’t up to a 5-star hotel service. 

- we had a small issue with toilet in the room and 3 times we had asked someone to come check it out and fix it. But it was never fixed and no one gave us an update on whether they checked it or not. Again as a 5-star hotel (and given that we are paying 1,200+ euro daily for the suite) I expected better service",4,2022,08,26
42,Modern hotel in good location,The hotel and room were clean and modern.  The rooftop was a nice option to grab a drink with good views.  Seemed like a decent location and easily walkable to main points of interest.  Wished the room had a mini fridge.  If back in Barcelona we would consider coming back,4,2022,08,25
42,Hotel Almanac Barcelona,"Visit Barcelona, stay here, relax and enjoy !!!! Friendly staff, excellent rooms, great technology and awesome food Highly recommended to friend and family. To our surprise the location was better than expected Too close to everything we like",5,2022,08,23
42,Very nice modern hotel,"Very nice modern 4.5 star hotel. Room was great and very modern. Rooftop terrace and bar was very cool.

The only reason it wasn't perfect was because the lady at the front desk forgot to send the luggage to our room and I had to go back down to get it. She was not apologetic and just gave the ticket to the baggage attendant, who then was able to give me our luggage.",4,2022,08,18
42,Absolutely impeccable service and rooms!,"We were blown away by this experience - from the moment we walked in, staff made us feel welcome and at home. Upscale but not pretentious. Super kind, patient, and thorough people - especially a blond manager who surprised us with a tray of goodies for our anniversary, and an older man who took our bags and gave us some tips and a room tour upon arrival. Such a special team. Also, the beds could not have been comfier!!! Rooms are super pristine with high tech controls of everything.",5,2022,08,10
42,"Awesome location, tasty breakfast","We were in this hotel for 3 nights.

Check-in was a bit too slow. Needed to fill in some papers that should've been pre-filled by the staff. 

The room (top floor penthouse with terrace) was faboulous. The only downside was that there were very small ants in the room. We weren't bothered about it, though. 

Breakfast is very tasty and the selection is great. Gym is small, but quite OK. SPA services were on par as well. 

The staff could've been friendlier though. Nothing too bad, but some people seemed a bit arrogant. 

Other than that, great hotel and will probably visit again.",4,2022,08,08
42,Wonderful experience,"Never have I seen such keen attention to details, first time I ever saw OLED TV in hotel. The curtains opened up as I entered the room and I was stunned of the presentation.

The window was just the perfect design, the view was on the street but it was nice. 

The only thing I did not like was that there was no luggage rack & the toilet seat bidet did not work.

Pricey stay but quite gorgeous and totally recommend!",5,2022,08,06
42,Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"This is a hotel well located in central city and perfectly managed; the staff is totally friendly, professional and always helpful. There is an amazing rooftop restaurant and pool that is a fun place to relax after exploring. The breakfast is delicious and the room are completely clean and well organized. This is a wonderful hotel experience. ",5,2022,08,04
42,Family Trip,"We stayed here with two teenagers.  Location is good for sightseeing, about a 25 minute walk to marina.  Hotel staff were all happy, kind and very helpful.  Room service food was delicious.  Stayed in room with terrace and it was very spacious.  View wasn't great, but the room amenities and amount of space was great.  Would stay here again.",5,2022,08,01
42,"Almanac Barcelona - good location, but","Very well situated hotel, with a good enough facilities. The roof top has a nice view, but food and drinks are overpriced and simply not good enough. We had a room with a faulty AC that was never addressed, for an expensive stay, which isn’t acceptable. Staff was rude at times and seemed more annoyed than ready to help. Not everyone was like that, but enough people were, possibly because the hotel is understaffed. But that should not be on the paying customers to bear the consequences. ",2,2022,07,28
42,5 stars are not enough!!,"We spent 2 nights at this hotel in July 2022. It was amazing. The rooms are plush. The beds and pillows are some of the best we’ve ever experienced in a hotel. The most important aspect of the entire stay was the people. The staff, especially the concierge’s made the stay. Nothing is ever too much trouble and their recommendations were spot on. 
If you’ve never stayed here, you’re doing yourself an injustice. It was amazing and we will return many times. ",5,2022,07,20
42,Decent hotel but quite disappointing,"We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Almanac Hotel but it unfortunately fell for short of our expectations. I realize that government ratings are based on certain facilities offered by hotels, this five star hotel did not come close to any our prior stays in five-star hotels, and even to most four-star hotels that we have stayed at. I generally give very good reviews to hotels and I really criticize them, but I wanted to be honest so that other TripAdvisor members can understand why we did not love this hotel.

The location is perfect, just a couple of blocks from Placa de Catalunya. Emailed questions prior to our reservation were quickly answered and our specific request was met. 

Our room was a decent size, but someone oddly furnished with a very small sofa, a coffee table and one chair, but no desk. The bed was great. Housekeeping was subpar with no bathmat when we arrived. The towels were certainly not plush, and we’re worn out. One was very worn out with ragged edges and so thin that there was a hole in the middle. There was also a fair amount of dust in the room. The lights and other features were electronically controlled and simple to use. Air conditioning was great. Most of the information regarding the hotel was on a tablet. When we were shown our room, the staff member tried the tablet and said that it was not working. I assume that we were supposed to have called for it to be repaired, because at the end of our stay it was still not working.

Breakfast was mostly good but not up to the caliber of other similar hotels. Selection of breads and rolls, as well as cheese was very limited. Everything seemed fresh. Samson, who checked us in was efficient and friendly and who is greeted us when he saw us after that. The rest of the front desk staff were pleasant, but almost never greeted us, even when they looked at us when we walked in or out of the hotel. One of the front desk staff was extremely surly and borderline rude to us when we asked a question.

Several basics were clearly lacking. There was only one towel hook and no racks on which to hang wet towels. Basics such as cotton ear swabs and make up remover pads were not provided. I cannot think of a another hotel, even a two-story hotel, where they did not provide these simple amenities. Basic body wash and hair conditioner in pump bottles were provided, but no shampoo. There was also a large stain on one of the curtains.

This could be a great hotel but it certainly needs a lot of improvement to reach that level.",3,2022,07,10
42,AVOID IF YOU ARE WITH CHILDREN!,"We booked this property under the American Express Platinum Fine Hotels Program.  HUGE MISTAKE! Once the hotel saw me arrive with my daughter, they treated us differently.  They would not honor any of the American Express FHR program benefits and as a result of our immediate inability to check in, despite already paying, we advised that we would seek alternate arrangements and were in fact encourage by someone named Andrew to do so.  Once I sat in their lobby and located another hotel, Andew had the audacity to then come over and say he now had a ground floor room - not what was described on the FHR program or what we had paid for but yet too late as we had just made alternate arrangements.  We walked out without zero acknowledgement and zero apology for their mistake, their lack of customer service and their rude behavior which was unprofessional.  I would caution anyone looking at this hotel to look at other options especially if you are from the US and you are with any children whatsoever.",1,2022,07,10
42,Awful awful,"Very awful staff I booked a room for two weeks and they forced me to change the room 3 times!
+ most of the stuff in the room dose not work and the tv is very laggy me and all my family will never book there again. I was in Barcelona for doctor’s treatment and they didn’t let me rest even for one day.0 stars rating",1,2022,07,03
42,"Beautiful, ambient hotel","We had a wonderful stay at the Almanac. The rooftop bar and pool is beautiful and has an amazing view of the city. The rooms technology is great to work with, and the shower is very relaxing. Loved having a window to open for fresh air. ",5,2022,06,30
42,Great Stay i Barcelona,Almanac was a great place to stay for our two nights in the city and all the staff were very helpful taking care of all our needs. A short taxi ride or 25 minute walk to the Sagrada Familia and about 20 minute walk to La Rambla.,5,2022,06,29
42,Exceptional hotel with great rooftop,"Staff was great, friendly, helpful and willing to do a little extra. Arranged for in room Covid testing, recommended many great restaurants and places and best times to visit. Rooftop was a lot of fun. Unique drinks, good appetizers, great view and fun staff. Great buzz. Willing to modify menu items if available. Convienent location to walk to many attractions. Recommend higher floors since on main street, but noise level was low at night. Door staff can hail cabs and schedule pickups for airport or cruise port. Thoroughly enjoyed stay.",5,2022,06,24
42,Exceptional!,"This was our second stay at the Almanac and it was truly exceptional.  The staff, the food, the rooftop, the room-- everything is perfect!  The hotel is beautiful and the location is ideal. We can't imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2022,06,21
42,"Great location, beautiful hotel but missing much of the 5 star service","It’s a beautiful hotel. Great location-really close to La Ramblas and Gothic quarter, as well as Sagrada Familia. Lots of shopping in the area. 
Room was lovely but oddly designed. Toilet was on one side of the room and the the rest of the bathroom (shower and sink) were on the other side-a bit awkward when you go to the bathroom then have to cross the whole room to the other side to go wash your hands; should have a small sink in the toilet room then. Beds were comfortable and the auto black out feature was great. 
Roof top was lovely but you can only see the views while standing. Otherwise plants block all views when sitting. 
Pool is also a tiny pool-wouldn’t call it a pool in fact. 
Food at the rooftop restaurant was delicious. Highly recommend any of the tapas. 
We ordered room service (drinks) one evening and after waiting for an hour nothing showed up so we went to bed. 
Overall service was good. But not 5 star. Even at check in, they forgot to bring up our luggage and my husband then brought it up himself. Only 5 star service was with from the front door people who were very helpful at hailing us a cab every time we asked. 
Overall, underwhelmed and would try a different hotel next time. ",3,2022,06,11
42,"Wonderful Stay, Superb Service","Wonderful stay at the Almanac.    Beautiful, modern hotel, with perfect central location and great food at Virens restaurant and Azimuth rooftop bar.   High point is the truly extraordinary, world-class service from Ricard and the concierge team, along with the exception front desk staff.   The Almanac team delivered on every request we had, including securing dinner reservations at multiple Michelin-starred restaurants.   Truly the best and a “hotel gem” to be discovered in Barcelona.",5,2022,06,10
42,4.5/5,"First of all, it is located in the heart of the city and it's yet very quiet. Everything was perfect, from the super comfortable room and bed, the modern amenities (high tech features hidden within the gorgeous design). They also have a very cool rooftop lounge with stunning views of Barcelona. Most importantly, the staff and service were exceptional and they are extremely helpful.",5,2022,06,06
42,Excellent Stay,"Amazing Stay for our Destination Wedding. The overall experience was excellent, very pleasant and positive. I can’t express enough about this hotel and their team. We highly recommend this hotel for those who are looking for a luxurious experience/stay, where location is key, design is an important aspect and where you expect a service who is able to manage your stay in such a great way. The level of English in their Concierge Team was really good. Thank you!!!",5,2022,06,06
42,Excellent Boutique hotel with prime location!,"We had a lovely stay at this excellent boutique hotel with prime location in the centre of Barcelona. Beautiful, clean and silent rooms, perfect for couples and business travellers. The hotel had a lovely rooftop bar and a smart excellent restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Overall very friendly staff.",5,2022,05,31
42,A wonderful place to stay…..,"We spent three nights in this hotel upon completion of an Oceania cruise.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  The rooms were definitely in the year 2002.  Comparing it to hotels in the USA…well no comparison.  Everything in the room is electronic/computerized .  Shades go up and down with a touch of a button as do the lights .  There is a mini iPad with all the info needed about the hotel.  There is also a Samsung cell phone which I realized when I was looking to call reception and could not find an old fashioned phone.  Now, the toilet doubles as a bidet with the use of a hand held device that looks like a TV remote.  Breakfast was included in our stay and the waitstaff was top notch.  Also…..location is wonderful….",5,2022,05,30
42,"Almost, but not quite good enough","My wife and I just stayed here for 5 nights whilst visiting Barcelona and attending the Formula 1 Grand Prix. The Almanac is a very good hotel. It is modern, up to date and our room was spacious. The location, just a block off from psg d gracia is perfect.  Everyone was super friendly, check-in was a breeze and the lady who escorted us to our room was lovely. All sounds great, right? I wish that was the case.

I just struggle to get over the level of inconsistency in the service received in the restaurant for breakfast. Depending on which server we got, we experience quick, efficient, and excellent service OR slow, bordering on the ignoring level. It should not take 10 mins to make a coffee. It should not take 30 mins to bring two poached eggs which, when received, were essentially cooked through to hard-boiled.

The staff at the rooftop bar were great. Just that breakfast experience.",4,2022,05,25
42,Great one night stay at Almanac,"We stayed at Almanac for one night before flying back to US. This hotel is at a perfect location, it is close to the Gothic quarter and other tourist sites in Barcelona. Front desk staff were very nice and appear to be committed and energetic. ",5,2022,05,25
42,A Sleek & Modern Hotel in Barcelona,The Almanac Barcelona is a sleek and modern hotel with an amazing staff.  They will treat you like royalty and attend to your every need.  We were impressed by the attentiveness and attention to detail.  The rooms are modern and full of electronic magic. ,5,2022,05,24
42,Amazing Honeymoon Experience,"This hotel was absolutely amazing. There was nothing they did not offer and the rooftop was amazing. The concierge are incredible and every recommendation they gave us was perfect. Also, the hotel provided a complimentary bottle of wine for our honeymoon! They could not have made our experience any better.",5,2022,05,16
42,Centrally located modern hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights and it was excellent in many ways. First, we found the location to be perfect, away from the hustle and bustle of the La Rambla area but yet close enough to it and other areas like El Born and and El Raval. We walked almost everywhere -- most places were within 20 minutes -- and took the subway once. The station is within 5-min walk. Eixample, where the hotel is located, is full of excellent restaurants and shops.

The hotel itself is modern, with a touch-screen control for lights and curtains.We love the indirect lighting in the shower and the room itself.  Our room rate included complimentary breakfast, which has a menu for hot foods such as eggs, and a buffet for pastries, breads, cold cuts, and fruits. We also had a couple of drinks at the rooftop bar one afternoon, which was a little oasis. 

Overall, the service is excellent, but with one minor hiccup. To be clear, every staff that we encountered was friendly, kind, and courteous. A special shout-out to Natalie at the front desk. When we checked in, we asked about whether a couple of high-end tapas restaurants which we did not have reservations. Even though we didn't ask, she proactively tried to get us a reservation, and when none was available, she found out that they save some seats for walk-in's and informed us how to best get them. Also, the tablet in our room did not work from the start. We told Natalie and the tablet was fixed within the same day. She has been so helpful in many respects and was simply on top of it all.

The one hiccup was one day at breakfast when we were pressed for time to meet a tour and attempted to order the hot items as soon as we were seated. The waiter told us he'd be back, but he never did. When we flagged down another waiter, he said he'd get someone to take our order. It seems only certain waiters can take orders. And then when we did order our eggs, it took 20 minutes for the eggs to come out just when we were about to stand up and leave, even though there were only 2-3 other tables occupied at the time. I didn't deduct any rating here only because our local Spanish friend told us that culturally there is no such thing as ""urgency"" in Spain and meals are taken easy and slow. At the risk of imposing my own  cultural prejudice, I'll simply mark this one as a cultural difference. If only Natalie also works in the restaurant during breakfast. Just give yourself plenty of time if you have an appointment. Despite this, we'd still come back here and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,14
42,Perfect Stay and Location,The hotel was excellent in every way. The staff was super helpful and made my wife and i feel super comfortable and taken care of. They made excellent recommendations for restaurants and the actual hotel was in immaculate condition. We loved all the technology in our suite and the decor was so modern and tasteful. The hotel is centrally located to everything. We could not have been happier.,5,2022,05,11
42,Flawless,"This property is worth the trip to Barcelona just to stay here. Especially loved the design, rooftop pool and location which were all supported by the service oriented staff. The hotel hit the right balance of using technology but not so much that you had to phone the desk for help; the rooftop pool was hip but was welcoming for all ages and the staff were attentive but not overly solicitous. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2022,05,11
42,They cancelled our booking because they told us they had set the right price enough on booking.com,"We booked a suite for my wedding in June through booking.com and they’ve just cancelled it because they said it was the wrong price. If you’ve set the wrong price, you should own your mistake rather than cancelling your guests reservation, we were very excited to stay at your hotel, our wedding is now 4 weeks away and we don’t have accommodation.",1,2022,05,10
42,Beautiful Barcelona,"Very lucky to have stayed here on business. Wonderful hotel with super attentive staff. Great location.  Only negatives were lack of iron and ironing board in room (I’m sure they would’ve sent one up though) and the pool was only 3 foot deep, so more of a plunge pool, but perfect for cooling off after reading a book.",5,2022,05,08
42,Amazing Hotel,"The location was great, walking distance to La Rambla, lots of restaurants nearby. The room was very clean and comfortable bed. Breakfast was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,05,05
42,"Wonderful experience and lovely staff, can’t recommend more","It was our first family trip and we were apprehensive traveling with our twin babies but the whole stay at this hotel made the experience memorable and wonderful! The hotel concierge was prompt to respond to my emails and helped with booking even before our stay started. Once we reached, we were impressed by the beautiful room (although we were given an inside facing room with no view) and the marble toilet with a bidet (big plus point for us) made up for it. The breakfast was very good and sustained us well for the 9 days we were there. I can’t praise the wonderful staff enough who were really friendly, helpful and lovely to us and the babies. Andri, Adria and many others at the front desk (so sorry I couldn’t catch everyone’s names), the attendants/ porter/ bell hops, Catherine and Joan at the breakfast just to name a few, all made our stay in Barcelona excellent and a family holiday to remember. And the small things like surprise gifts for our twins birthday really touched me with their thoughtfulness. It wasn’t cheap but worth every cent! Thank you to all the staff!",5,2022,05,01
42,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"I absolutely loved my stay at the Almanac. I spent the week of my birthday in Barcelona this year and was torn between staying at this property and another popular ""trendy"" hotel in Old Town. I couldn't decide so I stayed at both, 2 days at the other property and 3 days at the Almanac. The other property is beautiful and quite popular but the Almanac blew that one out of the water in my humble opinion. The staff was very friendly, property is stunning - right when you enter the lobby you're surrounded by luxury. And the rooms are beautiful, luxurious, contemporary but welcoming. Everything is high-tech, even the curtains. I also enjoyed the food at Virens, the main hotel restaurant and the rooftop Azimuth. The location is also perfect with lots of shopping and eateries available. I only want to stay here in Barcelona.",5,2022,04,30
42,Luxury Stay & Quality,"The front desk attendant, Daria was also wonderful. She was very clear and extremely accommodating. The entire staff was amazing. We’re so lucky to have found this hotel to stay It was so sweet that the staff was able to get us our room ready at the early hour of 8am. We were able to relax before venturing out. The front desk attendant, Daria was also wonderful. She was very clear and extremely accommodating. The entire staff was amazing. We’re so lucky to have found this hotel to stay at. Wish we could stay longer!  at. Wish we could stay longer! It is definitely one of the most luxurious hotels we have ever stayed at. Even nicer than some of the Ritz Carlton’s we have visited as well. Highly recommend. We will never forget our stay here. ",5,2022,04,24
42,Too much technology!,The hotel is excellently located and extremely comfortable but unfortunately there is an excess of technology. It is impossible to order food or drink here without a phone to download from a QR code. Even for breakfast  there are no menus ..only QR codes.,5,2022,04,24
42,An excellent choice in a perfect location,"Overall the hotel lived up to our expectations of a super high-end choice. The rooms are big and well decorated, and the location is perfect - within walking distance of the gothic quarter, the shops of Eixample and even the Gracia area.
The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. We had some problems with the lighting in the room (definitely too complex and therefore prone to failure...) and they offered us a bottle of wine and some chocolate.
The only point of attention in our view is the breakfast, with a limited choice, especially of fruits and breads. For such a room price, it should be a lot better.
Apart from that, we strongly recommend this place.",5,2022,04,23
42,Great place to stay,"Beautiful hotel with magnificent rooms and great staff.   The staff was very helpful, the room was very modern and comfortable.   Easy to walk to restaurants, historic buildings.   Located in a beautiful part of town",5,2022,04,20
42,An oasis in the middle of Barcelona,"This modern hotel has every amenity you could wish for.  It is beautiful and very secure with a doorman and limited access to hotel rooms.  The rooms have one touch features for lighting, temperature, etc.  The staff speaks perfect English and is extremely helpful.  
There is a rooftop bar and pool with a view of the. City and the Sacra Familia where you can get a light lunch or other meal as well as a downstairs dining room.",5,2022,04,16
42,Family City Break,"The Almanac Barcelona is in an excellent location, perfectly situated for cafes & restaurants, shopping, and cultural activities. The street is a busy one, but the hotel is extremely well insulated, so you hear nothing once inside. The two bedroom Almanac Suite is excellent for families of up to four people. It is spacious, extremely well appointed, and the window seats (we were on the first floor) offer fantastic views of Barcelona life. The staff are friendly, helpful & efficient, and there is always someone to offer their assistance. Virens restaurant is a lovely and relaxed environment for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and Azimuth rooftop bar is a wonderful place to enjoy the late afternoon & evening light. The gym is also well equipped, and there is much to love about this hotel. ",5,2022,04,15
42,A gracious experience,I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff is inviting and helpful. The amenities are wonderful. They offer a small but very appetizing selection of food and their coffee Barista puts a smile on your face in the morning by offering the best cup of Latte in Barcelona.,5,2022,04,14
42,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"Everything about the hotel was excellent. Hotel facilities were beautiful, The service, staff and location were as good as one could ask for.  Would definitely stay there on any trip to Barcelona. You cannot go wrong at the Almanac.",5,2022,04,09
42,Not worth it,"First let’s start with the good stuff,the interior design was amazing I absolutely loved it!It also has an amazing location,

 but I was a little disappointed concerning the Restaurant.We ordered hummus and guacamole for about 15€ each  and got a small portion.With the hummus we got in a paper bag 4 pita breads.When we ordered a little bit more bread it took 1 whole hour for it to arrive.When a waiter was at our table asking us something they took our guacamole which we were saving for the bread that took 1 hour,it wasn’t even half finished and she didn’t ask if she could take it.We also had switching waiters that were all running around nervously.What really was the icing on the cake was what they did when we told them our complaints,they gave us  again 4 pieces of Pita Bread in a paper bag and a little bit of guacamole.While we were eating this we heard mopping from upstairs wich was extremely distracting and annoying.

The Staff were not insanely friendly and didn’t really communicate with us.

There was also no hairdryer in our room.

The pool was a complete scam it was about 70cm deep and we expected a full one swimming pool where you can dive into.

Everything also had insanely weird hours,me and my Family wanted to go to the Rooftop bar and enjoy some snacks and drinks but it was closed,and of course some may not see this as a big deal and i don’t either but it was annoying and maybe saying that the bar is closed at specific  when you check in would be more helpful.

Overall I think it isn’t worth the Money or the 5 Stars,The staff could work on a bit more communication,the bar times could be said at check-in,and the food needs to taste better and either lower the prices or have bigger portions.",2,2022,04,08
42,Brilliant stay and special birthday!,"I stayed here with some friends to celebrate my birthday and couldn't have asked for a nicer stay. The rooms are beautiful and EXTREMELY good value for money, having been to Barcelona multiple times and stayed in different hotels. A lot of the time hotels in Barcelona are beautiful but not necessarily practical or in a bad location, however the rooms at the Almanac were not only stunning but also very functional with access to nearly every part of the city, most major sites within a 15-30 minute walk at the most and brilliant restaurants and shops only a 2-5 minute walk. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful, and breakfast had great selection. Thank you !",5,2022,04,07
42,No privacy,"We put ""Do not Disturb"" and still the staff went into our room without our permission. 
And the front office manager handled our complain really bad. He said for security season, hotel has right to enter the room anytime they want. And we just went out for 5hrs, seems nothing suspicious or reasonable reason to interrupt privacy in my opinion.
Other staffs are amazing. 
They really need to change the bad attitude and not well trained front office manager.",1,2022,04,01
42,Beautiful Rooms- Outstanding Service,"What a beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona! Fabulous amenities, and fantastic value with upgrades for AMEX Platinum cardholders. We were within walking distance to many attractions, and public transportation was easy to access. Service was top-notch with warm greetings from every staff member and willingness to assist us with recommendations and services. The daily breakfast was delicious and expansive. Worth every penny if you're thinking of paying for it. The restaurant itself is also top-notch- we were able to walk-in which I think was a perk of staying there since they usually require reservations (or at least highly recommend them). Our room was spotless and upgraded throughout with fancy tech features. We were on a major street, but it was very quiet with the windows closed. Bed was a cloud- slept like babies! The tub was clutch after long days walking the city. Oh! and the bidet was awesome ;) Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Would book again 100 times over!",5,2022,04,01
42,Barcelona visit,"Leisure travel to visit son studying abroad, great place to stay well situated, the bar at the rooftop was great, very good breakfast, rooms were great, clean would highly recommended it and will be back, ",5,2022,03,31
42,Just Perfect,Very convenient location to walk to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla.  Staff is so courteous and helpful.  The rooms are upscale and comfortable.  Breakfast buffet is very good and our dinner at Virens delicious.,5,2022,03,31
42,One of the BEST,"From check in to check out, the entire experience was great!  I booked through AMEX and never had a single issue and the amenities received from AMEX offer made the hotel that much better!  Staff on site were excellent, truly went out of their way to make our time there the best.",5,2022,03,28
42,Amazing 5 star hotel in the perfect location!,"Incredible 5 star hotel located right in the heart of Barcelona. 2 minutes to major shopping area and 10 to La Rambla. Amazing staff, food, and rooftop bar. Rooms and housekeep were AMAZING - kept everything so neat and clean which was refreshing after long days of sight seeing and drinking! ",5,2022,03,24
42,Great Hotel centrally located in Barcelona,Friendly and helpful staff.  Super cool modern rooms with the latest tech.  Comfortable beds.  Best Showers. Nice Breakfast.  Would definitely recommend and would stay here again on next trip to Barcelona.,5,2022,03,22
42,Unmatched Excellence,"This was our very first time in Barcelona. And I have to say, there couldn't have been a better welcome to the city than the Almanac. 

Located in a lively part of the city, the views from the Azimuth rooftop bar will give you a great view of the city.

The staff provides 5-star service. The rooms are as modern as you will find in any other hotel in the city.

This is as great a hotel as you will find in the city.",5,2022,03,20
42,Great Rooftop Bar,"I came in on the red eye, exhausted at 8:30 a.m. I asked for an early check-in based on my Trip Advisor Plus status, but did not get a room until 2:30 (regular check in was 3pm). The staff was generally nice, but a little aloof. They did offer me coffee while I waited. The room was nice, but did not have the balcony and seating I had read in the description of my booking. The bathrooms were comfortable and well appointed and beds are very comfortable with very good quality sheets and pillows. Generally well located and close to the metro. Would stay here again. ",4,2022,03,17
42,Great Hotel in a great location.,"The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing and shopping and only 25 minutes from the airport.  The hotel is modern, stylish and chic. We were happy with our room which was good in size and had a lovely window seat overlooking the street. Technical gadgets available in the room included iphone and ipad. The black out blinds were useful as our room overlooked the street but there was little in the way of noise at any time. The open bathroom was spacious and clean with a separate shower enclosure off and the shower was fab!  The complimentary toiletries were heavenly. Great having a separate wc too. There was loads of storage and hanging space within the room and a fresh supply of towels every day if needed. Complimentary water and tea and coffee pods were supplied daily. We couldn't fault the room really although an iron/ironing board would have been useful. Breakfast was included in our stay and there was plenty of choice, including cooked options. A nice choice on offer and everything was very fresh. The restaurant staff were lovely and accommodating as were the reception staff. We didn't get the chance to try lunch or dinner as were out for most of the day but we did try the rooftop bar (thanks for the complimentary drinks voucher). Sadly it rained throughout our stay so we couldn't sit outside but the views across the city are fabulous. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would happily visit again.",4,2022,03,17
42,Wonderful stay as always!,"It's the 2nd time we stay at Almanac hotel and everything was great as always! The staff make the difference! They were so friendly, they make us feel very confortable! Thank you for that! It's always a pleasure to come back. We hope to see you soon again.",5,2022,03,15
42,Perfect stay,"It was a very nice experience to stay in Almanac Hotel.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Nice and quiet rooms
Perfect location, just a few minutes walk from placa Catalunya.
Nice breakfast room and enough choice.

42,Almanac Barcelona review,"Amazing hotel, we really enjoyed our stay. Perfect for couples, but also families. Very good location with all the main attractions, restaurants and shops near by. The staff team was very friendly and helpful. 
You have to visit the rooftop bar when you come - amazing cocktails and views. ",5,2022,02,19
42,Outstanding Customer Service,"The hotel staff were truly amazing in helping us with a difficult medical emergency. Beautiful hotel, clean spacious rooms with very helpful staff. Great location for site seeing. Food and drink in bars and restaurants was also excellent.",5,2022,02,01
42,Almanac Barcelona - A+++ across the board,"Stay dates: 01/26-01/27 
We stayed at the Almanac due to its central location to the Gothic Quarter, La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. Had I known how amazing the service, people, and accommodations were going to be - we would have stayed here the entire time. Service was A+ from the moment we were greeted at our taxi to the time we left. We had the pleasure of meeting numerous members of the team from the concierge, breakfast staff, and rooftop bar staff all of whom were amazing to us and extremely helpful. They helped us with dinner recommendations, dinner reservations, and also helped us book tickets for tours when our apps/phones were not working. I cannot reiterate how wonderful these folks were. I wanted to give a special shoutout to Brian who worked at the Rooftop restaurant. He met us with such a positive attitude every evening and gave us great recommendations. We really loved our time at the Almanac and cannot wait to go back!",5,2022,02,01
42,BAD EXPERIENCE,"We came for lunch before staying at the hotel and we liked it very much. Then we came for accommodation the food was good that day. But then everything was very bad unfortunately. There were only 2 people in the hotel that we were satisfied with. One is Sebastian, the food and beverage manager, and Gigi, who took care of us at the restaurant. Its general service is very poor... Even the bathrobes were not changed. Unfortunately, the hotel is very stingy.Our orders from room service were very bad, the hotel needs to seriously improve itself.Unfortunately, our money was wasted, I definitely do not recommend",1,2022,01,28
42,Great experience and atmosphere,"Great rooms, modern up to date design, view, confort. Excellent diner and wine, delivering own chief reputation. Very nice team, warmly welcoming and efficient. Easy use of spectacular roof terrace, and sauna. ",5,2022,01,25
42,Absolutely the best!,"The Almanac is in the most perfect location.  We were close to so many things we had wanted to see with good restaurants, beautiful architecture, and upscale streets surrounding us.  The hotel is really modern with high tech features in the room.  It was clean, stylish, and comfortable.  Even on a busy street, the room was very quiet. 
The staff is incredibly welcoming and accommodating.  The breakfast was one of the best I've had in any hotel anywhere.  One evening we also had a fun and delicious vegetarian tasting dinner at Virens, the restaurant in the hotel.  I can't wait to go back to Barcelona and we'll be staying at the Almanac.",5,2022,01,24
42,Wonderful experience,Clean modern hotel situated near all the fun areas of Barcelona.  Absolutely loved the design of the hotel.  Everyone was super friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast and the rooftop terrace had good food and drinks.  Will definitely come back. ,5,2022,01,24
42,"Modern, cool, central and fun","The Almanac couldn‘t be more centrally located.  Right in the main shopping area nothing is far away. The Gothic quarter is in walking distance, like a lot of the main sites. Sagrada Familia and Park Guell is a a short taxi ride away. The hotel has beautiful modern design, with a touch of 70ties glamour. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. They have great views of Gran Via. The staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant in particular is really good and we love the wait staff. You guys are the sweetest. Thank you for the great upgrade and a good time. We will be back",5,2022,01,03
42,Amazing Hotel!,"We stayed at the almanac Barcelona for 5 nights. We were greeted well and since I booked through my American Express fine hotels and resorts, we were granted hotel credits we used for dinner at Virens (amazing experience). We were also upgraded into a suite which we were very grateful for. The concierge was attentive and answered all our questions. They are fully staffed and equipped with printers, mail service, taxi service, etc. 

The hotel is immaculate, well maintained and smelled fresh. The ambience is calming. A perfect example of luxury meets boutique. We had the Junior suite. The king size bed felt bigger and very comfortable. Marble countertops and sink, shower stall and a separate toilet room. A large closet and two large window that open to a terrace. The view was wonderful. Room service was super fast and attentive. 

Overall, the Almanac Barcelona is one of the most beautiful hotels I’ve ever stayed in. We will definitely come back! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay less than 10 mins away from all of the attractions in Barcelona!",5,2022,01,01
42,great personal experience,"good hotel, very nice location, clean, comfortable. Very friendly staff, above all, the concierge, Nathalie, was so helpful and kind, made us  feel like we had a nice friend who could guide us with every request we  had. Thanks, Nathalie",4,2022,01,01
42,Luxury hotel in the centre of barcelona,"Very personalised luxurious experience. Room is large and beautiful, very stylish. Breakfast was absolutely delicious.
Small comments though: drawback of the ultra central location is the noise of the large road in front. Impossible to really enjoy the open window or balcony, it is a pity. 
We also missed some small gadgets we would expect in such a hotel, such as airplay to project iphone content or watch netflix on our tv.
But we recommend 100%, is a great place to splurge!",5,2021,12,22
42,Excellent,"My second stay at the hotel! Highly recommended!! Great location, comfortable rooms, friendly stuff, delicious food!!!! All you need to enjoy and relax. Any wishes we had were fulfilled. The concierge service makes your live so easy and takes care of all reservations and gets you in the busiest places ;) just amazing ",5,2021,12,19
42,The best in Barcelona,"The Almanac stands out in a city with great hotels. I have stayed at The Majestic, The One, Alma, and The Monument — all really nice hotels. The Almanac, however, stands out. The design is so soothing and everything smells great. The toiletries are excellent. The rooms are beautiful. All of them.  And, I’ve stayed in almost every type of room. They really go above and beyond with service too. The entire staff is incredibly helpful and go out of their way to fulfill any request. ",5,2021,12,02
42,Lovely hotel in a fabulous location with slight niggles,"Visited Almanac this week for a 3 night stay with my boyfriend. We arrived about 11:30am and were told our room was ready - great news after a 4am start which we really appreciated! 

Our room was 603, an Almanac room which ended up being worth the extra £50 a night given the weather wasn’t the best and we spent more time in the room than normal. The room was stunning, well-decorated and classy, with a luxurious feel to it. The bathroom was also nice, and was well-equipped. The shower pressure was amazing - we’re already missing it!! The view from the room was also lovely, and the addition of the window seat was great for people-watching. We loved the high-tech touches such as the automatic blinds which raised when you entered your room, and the tablet which had information about the hotel on it. You could also contact concierge through a mobile phone in the room, however we did try this once to ask for restaurant recommendations and provided our email address but no one got back to us. The TV is massive but it did not have Sky Sports News as it said in the TV guide. The black-out blinds were truly black-out and blocked out the light all night and morning long. The tablet also claims a turndown service is provided in the evening, however this did not happen for any of our three nights which was slightly disappointing and misleading. The bed was very comfy and was huge!

The rooftop bar was lovely, it was raining for the first two days so we had to sit inside, however we managed to sit outside on our final night and the view is just stunning. The drinks were of good quality and we were also given 2 free welcome drinks which was a nice touch.

Breakfast was good, but could definitely be improved. There was no English breakfast tea the whole time we were there, and no cereal either which you just wouldn’t expect from a 5 star hotel. Service was very slow on two of the three mornings, it was difficult to get anyone’s attention and we ended up being there for almost an hour on our first morning. The fresh juices were delicious and the hot food was tasty. My scrambled eggs were average at best.

We didn’t use the pool due to the weather, but we used the sauna and steam room in the basement. Tip: make sure you tell reception you are going to use the sauna as they need to turn it on and it takes about an hour to heat up fully. The steam room wasn’t a proper steam room either, and barely worked. There are also 4 loungers where you can relax, although the website states they are heated which they are not.

Overall we had a great stay and would definitely return given the fabulous location (5 minute walk from Las Ramblas and Plaça de Catalunya) and luxurious rooms, we just would perhaps not pay extra for breakfast.

Restaurant tips for BCN: Bastaix, La Cova Fumada, Bodega Biarritz, Bar Cañete, Bobby’s Free (bar). And go to the Palau Dalmases flamenco show!!",5,2021,11,14
42,"Beautiful property, disappointing service","The hotel is really nice, style and design is second to none. Location is very good however it is located on a very busy road and despite the sound proofing street noise can be heard in the rooms.
The real let down is the service, we spent two nights and at each request we had we were left deeply disappointed.
They would not let us check in a minute earlier than the 3pm check-in time, or check-out a minute later than noon, despite the hotel was clearly not fully booked.
I requested a room at higher floor if available, so obviously first floor it was!
While waiting for check-in we asked for a glass of water, and were asked to wait in the seating area so they could bring it to us, but nobody came for over twenty minutes until I had to approach another member of staff.
So overall for this price range and expectations I will most likely not be back.

42,Real 5 stars hotel,"I had a great stay in Almanac Barcelona, with the great location in the centre, the room was clean and comfy, on top of that, the service was top notch, shout out to the exquisites Pol and Jan from the reception for their kindness and help. Thanks for making my trip memorable ..",5,2021,10,25
42,One of the greatest places on earth!,"I loved this wonderful place and people. The hotel is clean and pretty, with all the ammenities one could ask for. The people were nice, bright, kind ,helpful ,very professional and efficient. It was a great choice and I would go back again in a heartbeat. Great location and just an overall fun time.Loved drinks on the rooftop enjoying the view. They have a hot tub up there if you want it, nice seating, delicious food and drinks and the staff are fun and caring. 5 stars!",5,2021,10,19
42,Love the Almanac,"We arrived at 6:30 am and were very tired from our overnight flight. We were surprised and very relieved that our room was available so that we could rest before enjoying our first day in Barcelona. We appreciated the concierge recommendations, including requesting the covid PCR test in our room. The room was fantastic with great amenities and the bed was very comfortable. When we checked out, the staff had arranged a taxi to take us to the airport very early in the morning as requested. The location was fantastic. We walked everywhere. We were very impressed with Almanac and would love to return soon.",5,2021,10,14
42,Excellent hotel in central Barcelona,"Lovely hotel, very central location. Very comfortable, excellent service- very attentive, friendly staff, nothing is too much trouble. Roof top terrace and bar perfect for relaxing with a book, or simply soaking up the rays of the autumn sun. The rooms are extremely comfortable with some very clever use of space and automatic blinds. It was really easy to access all parts of the city centre, with key monuments and the old city a short walk from the hotel. Strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,10,08
42,Nice interior hotel but the price doesn’t match what it is. Staff is friendly but ther is no 5 star service.,"Nice interior hotel but for the price you expect a bit more. 
Staff is friendly but it is no 5 star service. 
Carpet in room was wet, socks were always soaked in wetness. Even if it’s desinfection or just plain cleaning it shouldn’t be that wet. It didn’t dry by the time of departure. 
Sauna was switched off, after calling they said we can use the spa anytime.so we thought it is on now.  But you have to call an hour before you want to use it. A bit confusing for 5 stars. 
Food wasn’t that great. 
So overall it is a Hotel with good interior and friendly staff but it is not 5 star or worth the price you pay ",2,2021,09,27
42,Favorite hotel,This is in a great location with tons of shopping & restaurants. We chose a package with breakfast which was something that I looked forward to every morning.  The rooftop bar has beautiful views of the city. The staff was very friendly & remembered your name & room number. The rooms were very spacious & modern. I highly recommend that you stay here!,5,2021,09,18
42,Extremly nice stay!,I would recommend the Almanac Barcelona to anybody. Loved it! The room was very nice. I had a balcony which I really recommend. Also the bar on the roof was amazing! Ask them to do a Negroni or a mojito.,5,2021,09,14
42,Best in town,"Trust me, this is as good as MO. Love the services and friendliness as well as what they offer, real passion! Being a global traveler and gourmet, I enjoy the hotel from breakfast to meals and the rooftop bar (as long as Jordi is here) LOL",5,2021,09,13

42,Wonderful experience!,"The accomodations are very up to date with high technology implemented in every room.  All of the valet, front desk and restaurant staff are extremely helpful, courteous and kind.  The hotel is well run and highly functional.  Our only complaint was with the breakfast choices during COVID, as the standard continental breakfast does not provide much variety.",5,2021,09,06
42,Relaxing Mecca,"We came here for 5 days and it was absolutely incredible.  Everything from the airport pickup, the reception, the room/suite, the breakfast, the rooftop bar/pool, met and exceeded our expectations.  Their breakfast was amazing, eggs, continental breakfast, meats&cheeses, Coffee, etc were a great way to start the day.  The beds are very comfortable and they have these windows that have a nice lil day bed next to them and you can sit there and watch the sunrise.  At night my kids would swim at the rooftop and we would have a few drinks, and watch the sunsets.  Everyone we met there was also very nice and we made some really good friends.  The location of Almanac is also very ideal, because you are within minutes of just about any attraction in the city.  We will definitely be back.",5,2021,08,31
42,Best in Barcelona,"There is nothing but praise for this jewel of Barcelona! The staff on welcome are genuine, but discerning, whilst being super responsive and understanding. Quality and balance of facilities outweighs other hotels for this price. We’ll be back and continue to come back here for a bliss visit",5,2021,08,26
42,Best hidden diamond in Barcelona,"Perfect location, amazing room, super clean, modern and in one word impecable hotel! Hidden gam of Barcelona. Who ever designed the property did phenomenal job, room are specious and so well appointed. I have stayed at the Mandarin  and Arts several times and even if service might be better there, Almanac is way better choice and place where I will be back over and over again ",5,2021,08,23
42,Loved this hotel,"This hotel was so great. Loved the location, could walk to Gothic quarter and to shopping and touristy cafes nearby, and also up to lovely restaurants in Eixample.  It's new and is beautifully decorated in a modern but elegant fashion. The breakfast included was really delicious and so much food. Loved the rooftop terrace bar. The pool is quite small and shallow, good for younger kids, but really that isn't why you go to Barcelona.  We were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view and room for a rollaway bed for my son. The price was really reasonable given that I think this is comparable to ritz or 4 season level. Loved this hotel and would definitely go back!",5,2021,08,13
42,Amazing!,This hotel is beautiful and the staff is amazing.  We visited the gorgeous rooftop every day for drinks and snacks. This was our 5th trip to Barcelona in recent years and we will absolutely stay here again in the future. ,5,2021,08,08
42,Best stay ever. Magnificent.,"I can't sum up everything in the review, but I will tell you one thing - If you're looking for the best hotel in Barcelona, it's right here. It's Almanac. The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious and cozy with great technology such as automatic curtains, fantastic design, great TV, you can't expect more. And the staff... My god! They make you feel like at home. Always willing to help, friendly. The breakfast is fantastick and the rooftop bar... You must go there! Will definitly come back.",5,2021,08,03
42,Very good stay in the center of Barcelona,"I highly recommend Almanac hotel which is located in the very center of Barcelona, 5 minutes walking distance to plaça de Catalunya and La Rambla. Hotel is moden, clean & cosy. The staff are very friendly. The roop top café and the swimming pool are definitely the high light. Our family stayed 5 days there this time. We really enjoyed the stay. We will be back next time when we go to Barcelona.",5,2021,08,02
42,I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.,"We had an outstanding stay at Hotel Almanac when we visited the hotel this summer. Every staff member I encountered, from check-in, service, and cleaning staff, went beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Thank you!. The rooms were high quality, and the rooftop pool bar area is perfect in the summertime. We also enjoyed the room service option – and the menu had a palette of very tasting food and drinks. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2021,07,28
42,A piece of tranquility in the busy center,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay at Almanac Barcelona. Located right in the heart of the city, you will enjoy an oasis on the rooftop of Almanac Hotel. A special thanks to staff of the hotel for making our stay remarkable (Barbara, in particular)! Hope to be back soon!",5,2021,07,27
42,Fabulous stay from start to finish,"This hotel was fantastic. Staff were incredibly attentive 100 percent of the time. Our room was spacious, modern and very futuristic! Eg curtains opening as soon as you open the room door. The rooftop bar had a great vibe, great cocktails and again incredibly attentive staff and great service. It’s also very centrally located - highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,07,19
42,Just a lovely place to stay in Barcelona,"I had heard about this hotel from a friend, and the location was prime for some business so booked. My first stay. The staff was very friendly and polite starting with the doormen and all the way thru to restaurant servers. Just a block off of Passeig de Gracia, easy to access both the touristy stuff and business - very central. If you book right, you get a peek view of Sagruda Familia. The terraces are wonderful and the shower that could open to the terrace through a slider that had a trick smart opaque glass that was fun. I would stay again if in Barcelona... and I'm a picky sort.",5,2021,07,14
42,Best hotel and team,"The Almanac Barcelona both as a hotel, and the entire team is the best i've experienced. Not only was the stay amazing (beautiful rooms, delicious food, great rooftop), and centrally located, but the service and support of the team was incredible. 

Unfortunately we had an incident while we were there, and the level of support from Ricard, Andreas, Enrique and the rest of the Almanac team is hard to describe with words. They went above and beyond to help resolve the situation (i.e. spent an entire day helping) and helped to do the impossible. Very thankful for their support. 

Highly recommend the Almanac, and the team to anyone visiting Barcelona, this is the place to stay and will always be back! Thank you Almanac!",5,2021,07,05
42,Great Hotel & Great Service,Sublime hôtel. Very well located. Large room. Great staff. Fantastic food. Great rooftop bar. We really enjoyed this hotel and we will come back definitely. Concierge was top toi to help us find the best spots in town.,5,2020,12,16
42,TEN STARS NOT FIVE!!,"The first stop on a multi-city birthday journey that included five Spanish cities, Marrakesh and Lisbon, turned out to be the most memorable, and magical. And that, thanks to the superlative staff at this hotel. 

Other reviews already addressed the beautifully designed rooms and amenities. I wanted above all those lovely things, to say the loveliest of them all was their staff. 

ALL OF THEM to a person, made my birthday trip begin in a sea of comfort, kindness, elegance and a sincere friendliness that has kept them all in my heart.  The birthday cake, the warm embraces (yes, we Spanish love expressing affection) and the delightful conversations I had with all of them. 

Sandra Neumayr - Front Desk Manager, was an angel and oh so patient with our credit card issues when we first arrived.  

Margot Campa/Concierge Supervisor, Joan Fernández/Concierge, Pol Nóbrega/Reception, Bellboys: Nestor Alarcón, Adna Córoles, Pedro Caldeira, Sameer Kadam, Daniel Román...were all on top of their game and always taking care of us. 

I got sick with Covid by the time I arrived in Lisbon three and a half weeks later. I survived. The world is changed. I am so happy and take much comfort in the lovely memories I have from this hotel and it's wonderful, excellent staff! 

I LOVE YOU ALAMANAC!",5,2020,07,14
42,Outstanding Service,"Do not hesitate to book here if considering a stay in Barcelona. Heartbreakingly our trip to Spain in May 2020 had to be cancelled. We initially chose this hotel due to location, reputation and the service. Although we cannot stay here on this time, I cannot emphasise enough how wonderful Hotel Almanac has been to deal with during this most challenging time. Highly recommended.",5,2020,05,13
42,Almanac Barcelona,"Awesome place.  New, modern, clean, good location and friendly staff.  The breakfast in the morning was very good.  The view from the roof top bar was spectacular.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay there again if we traveled back to Barcelona.  ",5,2020,03,15
42,Incredible Hotel and Service,"We are here on the last day of our Spanish trip. Unfortunately it is during the height of the Coronavirus hitting Europe. That being said, the entire staff at the Almanac has made our stay so enjoyable safe and comfortable. Before the city decided to close all museums, we received so much assistance getting tickets to attractions and dinner reservations. 
Extra special mention to Ricard the concierge, and Paul at front desk. Nela, the guest services manager was incredible. She helped us plan each day, suggesting attractions and routes to walk. 
Our stay was incredible, considering what is happening in Europe. This hotel is so central to all major attractions.  Very clean, modern and luxurious, especially if you can get a room with a view is the Gan Via. The food in the Michelin-star Chef designed restaurant is amazing.",5,2020,03,13
42,Amazing staff and standard,"Best  bed I’ve slept in ! We had a room with an amazing view over Barcelona . Everything from restaurant , staff , quality of room , style - everything had been well thought out and we felt very relaxed and welcomed here . Staff helped us with restaurant recommendations , taxis , bookings - anything we asked they did . ",5,2020,03,11
42,"Pristine hotel, Excellent location, Amazing service!",The Almanac Barcelona rates one of the top five hotels I've ever stayed in. The rooms are stunning- to the point you won't want to leave! The location couldn't be better and the staff is extremely accommodating. ,5,2020,02,24
42,Nearly flawless in every detail,"An incredible hotel, with an incredible staff.  Everything was nearly flawless during our stay.  From check in, to the detailed explanation of how our room works ... to each and every staff member.  So attentive.  The technology of this hotel is amazing, sometimes a bit daunting even for a techie like me.  But the room is stunning and of course it's BCN. This is now our choice hotel, especially when paired with the AMEX Platinum FHR perks.",5,2020,02,20
42,Absolutely impressed!,"I stayed in the junior suite and it was absolutely amazing. The room came with a very open design with high ceiling and direct access to view the streets below.

The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful with recommendations, all their suggestions for food and drinks around the neighborhood were just as appreciated by my local friends. The hotel location is extremely convenient being walking distance to some of the best shopping, drinking and eating in Barcelona.

The hotel itself is extremely shiny and new - the decor is amazing and the bathrooms just make you want to shower or bath forever.

Definitely found a new loyal customer next time I go to Barcelona.",5,2020,02,17
42,THE BEST!,"We stayed here three nights during an eight day stay in Barcelona. 
The service at this truly understated luxury hotel is just the best we have experienced. I regret not staying here for the entire trip( we prepaid at other hotels for a variety of locations in the city). This is a fine location. 
Our room was beautiful with good size and an outstanding bathroom with all amenities.  
The staff was so attentive without pretense. Nella was a fine ambassador, very informative and concerned. Dani and Pedro are Bellmen Supreme!
Breakfast was terrific with outstanding service and selection. 
One of the best places we have stayed in our many years of travel. 
The only place for us on return to Barcelona. ",5,2020,02,11
42,Gem of a property in the best location ,"I stayed here for a week over New Year period so it was a little more expensive due to the festive timing.

I have to say one of the best things about the property is the location and although it feels boutique and small, it truly is a proper 5*. I stayed at the Mandarin last year and honestly couldn’t see much difference in quality of property, location, service and overall experience.

I had a beautiful modern room with a great view (see attached pics). I loved the contemporary design and the shower was awesome. Room service was spot on and everyone working there including concierge was really well versed in providing top notch service.

The rooftop bar and views are pretty epic and remained open in the winter post 5pm which I really thought was amazing. In the summer this place must be a real hot spot.

If you want to stay in this area, in my opinion it’s the best for Tourists or locals in Barcelona this should be the place to stay, it’s worth the money.
",5,2020,02,08
42,"""modern and perfect location""","great location and walking distance to many places and restaurants. All of their staffs are friendly and helpful. the breakfast is delicious, especially their fruits are so sweet. we stay for 3 nights and will definitely come back next time. Don't forget to visit their rooftop bar and have a drink.",5,2020,02,06
42,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was a fantastic experience. The hotel employees are absolutely lovely and pleasant, our room (we had the Almanac Room King) was very comfortable, good size for a couple, very clean, modern (many smart features installed), perfect location to get to the main attractions Barcelona can offer, the room kept on getting cleaned up multiple times a day, the concierge team was super friendly and helpful and provided great recommendations and assistance we asked for. The only minor thing that I could think of that wasn't perfect was the shower experience: even though we had the water turned to hot water all the way, you would still get cold water every 30 seconds for like 1-2 seconds periods. This forced us not the take long showers which might be a good thing :-) but seriously it's not worth deducting any points since the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely come back again the next time I'll be in that area.",5,2020,02,06
42,alessandro lanata opinion about almanc barcelona,"I had a great time at almac. All the staff has benn very Kind and available.
I have received good suggestions for visit Barcelona.
When I'll come back to Barcelona I'll stay again at Almanac.
Thank for all from me and my wife.
Goodbye.",5,2020,02,04
42,Modern upscale hotspot,"Our stay was excellent and we highly recommend this hotel. The design conscious interior is especially pleasant and inspiring. The rooms are exquisite and the highlight of the stay. The dining area and menu offers delay options for all and a great location for meetings others. This is an edgy, design oriented hotel that strives to appeal to clients that appreciate a modern, high quality lifestyle.",5,2020,02,03
42,Perfect location,"Almanac is at a perfect location for most attractions in Barcelona, if you don’t mind a relax 20 mins walk through the city. It’s only minutes from Plaza Catalunya, so it’s very convenient for aerobus to and from the airport. 
Check in was easy with friendly staff. 
Room is modern and clean, but a little smaller than average. Bathroom and toilet are separate, which is very good for busy mornings. 
Very happy with the stay. ",5,2020,01,28
42,Perfect location and a perfect stay,"Really a wonderful hotel in a terrific location.  The staff are very polite, professional, and helpful.  The rooms/suites are beautiful, well equipped, and very quiet.  We were upgraded from a Suite to a Terrace Suite,which was awesome. Be sure to visit the rooftop bar!",5,2020,01,26
42,Christmas visit,"I stayed at the Almanac room for four nights thru Xmas. I received an upgrade since I’m a platinum member with orbitz. My room on 2F was ready even we arrived at the hotel an hour before the check-in time. The check in process from opening the taxi door to in person tour of the room made me felt welcomed. The room was very chic and elegant with the blvd view. The decor and artworks were modern and cohesive with the neighborhood of the city. 
 
We reserved a table at Linia to celebrate Xmas Eve with college friends and we had a good dining experience overall. I was hoping for a set menu with more courses than three but the selections were appropriate for mainstream diners. 

The only disappointment was I was not informed the rooftop bar is closed on Monday and Tuesday which was the two evenings before Xmas thus I missed the chance to have a drink there. ",5,2020,01,15
42,Great stay,"It was a great stay. Everything was perfect. Staffs were kind, and breakfast was tasty. Specially I enjoyed caffe con leche most. It was the best in Barcelona. Housekeeping was  excellent. I didn't want to go out of hotel.",5,2020,01,13
42,visit to the city of Gaudi,"if Gaudi was in advance by the time he decided to build the casa Balto or the Pedrera or even the Sagrada familia, Almanac architects have well thought about the comfort of the visitors as they are like to have thought about very small details that are to ease the visitors experience, since the very beginning of the refurbishment / renovation / construction of the hotel. It definitely worth the tour, especially if you are found of technology as well as willing to stay central from shops and restaurants, when you are visiting Barcelona.",5,2020,01,13
42,Excellent,"i absolutely liked my stay in Almanac Barcelona. It has an ideal location, well organized reception, perfect room service and level of cleanliness, beautiful design. Breakfast was perfect, it was various and tasty. ",5,2020,01,13
42,Great Hotel in Perfect Location,"I researched the 5 star hotel offering in Barcelona at some length - it was our 4th visit to the City and wanted something stylish and with a rooftop bar that was still open in January. We decided to book Almanac and are so pleased we did. Our Terrace room was great with a lovely outdoor terrace that we used as the weather was actually very good for the time of year. Azimuth, the rooftop bar, is small but lovely with good music and light snacks. Breakfast was also good. Location is great - juust a strett away from Passeig de Gracia so convenioent but less noisy. Staff were exceptional. We wouldnt hesitate to return",5,2020,01,07
42,High tech comfort,"We spent 4 nights at the Almanac. The location was perfect - we could walk almost everywhere and the hotel itself is fantastic. It’s new, so the rooms are equipped with modern technology - you can control everything from a touchscreen next to the bed - and the room was spacious and very well laid out. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in.  Breakfast was outstanding and every interaction with the staff was lovely.  We would absolutely stay here again when we return to Barcelona. ",5,2019,12,31
42,A very good experience,"We went to visit the almanac hotel, since we heard about it. When we arrived, the receptionist Philippine directly came to us with a warm smile to offer assistance. She introduced the rooftop bar, and escorted us upstairs. The view is lovely, however the waiter was alone and we had to wait to order. The atmosphere is perfect if you want to have a drink with your friends or family. Once we left the hotel, Phillipine was here again to give us a fond farewell. I recommend this place ! ",4,2019,12,30
42,Fantastic Hotel in Barcelona!,"The hotel is beautifully designed and its location is absolutely perfect. We found ourselves walking to pretty much everywhere because it is super centrally located. Easy access to the Gothic Quarter and Sagrada Familia. The subway line is just a few blocks away. The staff is friendly, the rooms are beautiful and comfortable. Will not stay anywhere else in Barcelona. ",5,2019,12,30
42,December weekend getaway ,"Very good location, walking distance to metro and the city center landmarks.
Hotel in good condition in general. Nice design. Service at the reception could be improved to be more customer-oriented though. ",3,2019,12,30

42,Special,"Nice place, great location, very friendly staff, and really friendly services. They are the nicest thing you can imagine. I have never seen such a great service before. And if there was an expression more than that, I would have said it, but speaking is not enough for them",5,2019,12,24
42,Pleasant visit.,"Very attentive and friendly staff along with a beautiful, clean and very technology friendly room. I would stay again in a heartbeat. Walking distance to Sagrada Familia, fine food and shopping, La Rambla, and the Gothic Quarter. ",5,2019,12,23

42,Dream of a hotel,"My husband and I spent our anniversary in this hotel and it is an absolute dream. Everything is impeccable from the design to the customer service. But the director of guest services, Nela, is just the person who took this hotel above the cut, she is a complete professional, and a fantastic host. Nela made sure we had bubbly and chocolates in the room. She was so elegant and good natured at every turn. I would highly recommend this hotel, they know what they are doing.",5,2019,12,14
42,Fantastic Hotel in Barcelona,"We recently stayed 4 nights at the Almanac and it was one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at.  The rooms, the technology, the breakfasts, the staff -- all wonderful.  Plus, the location can't be beat - right in the middle but also quiet and peaceful compared to a lot of other areas in town.  We didn't have a chance to use the fitness room but it looked like it wasn't just an afterthought -- the equipment is first rate. 
Also, we peaked at the the rooftop bar and outdoor lounge but didn't have the time to relax there.  However, it looks like a nice place to spend some time.  

One last thing -- We also had dinner one night in the hotel restaurant which is something we normally don't do.  However, we had just spent the entire day in Girona and Besalu and were exhausted.  So we walked into Linea and it was actually one of the best meals of our vacation.  All in all, this is a great hotel!",5,2019,12,13
42,Good hotel but stealing my money,"The staff was very friendly, the environment was good and the location was good.
But on the first day they didn't clean my room. The next day I lost money in my wallet about 150 euro. This is the first time in my life. 
Even my friend in another room lost money too.",2,2019,12,13
42,Luxury and style,"Second tune to stay here. Beautifully finished bedrooms and bathrooms. Super comfortable bed. Some rooms have no view, so try and book one with a window overlooking the street. Housekeeping is excellent, as is breakfast, try the Iberian ham. There’s a rooftop bar which has great potential but was lacking in atmosphere as it was mostly empty.  Sauna and steam room are in the basement but the swimming pool is on the roof. If you book direct with hotel you get complimentary breakfast along with a cheaper rate than on some websites.",5,2019,12,08
42,Amazing,"If you are looking for value for money in terms of stacc, ambience and experience, this is your place.

The room was clean and the bed comfortable. We had a terrace in the room and it gave me the perfect opportunity to write and relax while breathing some cool air. Unforgettable!",5,2019,12,06
42,Amazing stay! Everything is perfect.,"The service, the location, the rooms is definitely the best in Barca!  They paid attention to all our needs.  They pay attention to details.  There is zero faults.  It’s only a few places around the world where you will find everything is perfect",5,2019,12,04
42,Missed expectations by a mile,"Upon arrival, the room was not ready for check-in. I booked through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts, which means you can typically expect a noon check-in. The room was not ready until 2, which threw off our plans for the day. Upon checking in, our bags did not arrive to the room until 3:30pm, which again ruined plans because we had tickets for an event at 2:30 that we were not able to attend since the tickets were in one of my bags. The room was absolutely filthy. It was turned over, but that was about it. The hardwood floors were basically black and full of dirt, the carpet very dirty, and there was a baby's pacifier found next to the bed. I informed the front desk about the pacifier, and she said it would be taken care of immediately. It never was. At the bar, we wanted to enjoy the outdoor seating of the rooftop. Of course, the fires could not be lit because apparently they were out of gas. The breakfast staff was the only highlight of our stay. Everyone there was excellent. However, if you are paying for your breakfast, expect to leave hungry as the portions are minuscule. Luckily ours was all inclusive, so that did not matter.  ",2,2019,12,04
42,Modern boutique hotel,"Good location, walking distance to Casa Batilo, a Gaudi building. Also walking distance to good shopping. Friendly, polite and professional hotel staff.  Great rooms with nice modern fittings. It’s spacious, comfortable beds, clean and nice decor. I like the breakfast spread, not too large but big enough with good choices. ",4,2019,12,03
42,A Hotel where you find all you need!,There is a competent and kind stuff who will all wishes comes true. A modern hotel excellent placed in the city with a spectacular roof lounge. The rooms are perfectly equiped and we slept very well !,5,2019,12,02
42,"Beautiful, Luxurious, Incredible Service- Best Hotel!",This was one of the most friendly and luxurious hotels I have ever stayed at.  Everything from the food to the craft cocktails to the amazing amenities in the room were exceptional.  The location was also very central to everything and the concierge was very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations for dinner.  I'll never stay at another hotel in Barcelona.  5 Stars +! ,5,2019,11,30

42,"Romantic visit, beautiful vistas","I can’t say enough about this hotel. The staff was phenomenal, the room was a heavenly oasis, the rooftop bar was laid back and cozy, the tea time deserts were delicious, the neighborhood and views from our terrace were iconic Barcelona. A pure delight! You should visit immediately. Highly recommended! ",5,2019,11,23
42,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful Hotel for an amazing stay . The breakfast was complete with a wide range of suggestions. The room was at the state of the art, fully furnished and nicely equipped. 
Nice staff and amenities . ",5,2019,11,21
42,Great discover and experience ,"We just have 3 days in Barcelona and choose Almanac. It was a great surprise. Everything were perfect. Since the front desk receptionist (all of them are great and could suggest the types of restaurants that’s fits better for us), the concierge that explain the technologies in our room. The breakfast was great with different fruits and no gluten choices. The location couldn’t be better. It was close to the main sightseeing and just 4 blocks from Plaza Catalunya (bus stop from airport). We definitely will come back soon. ",5,2019,11,19
42,Amazing,"The hotel, location, staff and the overall experience was perfect !
I was so delighted with the services of the hotel and staff made a business trip so pleasant and easy. Nothing was too much effort for their team",5,2019,11,19
42,Beyond excellent,"This hotel is beyond excellent and I am particularly referring to the staff.
So friendly and genuinely willing to help.

My family and I stayed here for 5 nights in August.

My children's requests were taken with smiles. Nothing was out of reach.

The interior was lavish in the right way.
Breakfast buffet was excellent by European standards. 
Rooms were very nice - because we arrived early and were accommodated in regular rooms for a few days before moving to our suite.
Even the cleaning staff genuinely asked when we'd prefer room service.

The rooftop lounge was a eutopia for early evening relaxation.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough.

",5,2019,11,19
42,Terrific high end hotel,"Excellent place to stay.  Pricey and they try very hard to make it worth every penny.  The breakfast was perfect, the desk and lobby staff really friendly and helpful, the rooms extremely high tech and luxurious and comfortable.",5,2019,11,18
42,LOVED this incredible hotel,"As someone who travels several times a month for work, I have stayed in many hotels around the world and this rates at one of the best. The rooms were absolutely flawless, facilities beautiful, and service impeccable. The complimentary breakfast spread in the morning was delicious and we were blown away by all the little touches that made this hotel so memorable. The location could not have been better and we would absolutely return back to this beautiful hotel. Thank you Almanac team for such an amazing experience!",5,2019,11,17
42,Great service / Great hotel,"This is a great hotel in heart of Barcelona. Really friendly staff and great breakfast. 
The rooms are tech friendly and is equipped with most essentials. 
Since they are asking for 200 word here are three words 
",5,2019,11,17
42,The Perfect Room,"My husband and I just stayed in a junior suite for (3) nights this past week.  The only thing I can say is “perfection”.  From the fireplace on the balcony overlooking the beautiful streets of Barcelona to the top notch service of the hotel staff this place knocked it out of the park.
Concierge team was informative and had great recommendations for restaurants and other sights around town.
The location is perfect for walking the streets and enjoying the city.  
As far as the city goes I would recommend going to the Born district instead of the Gothic and Las Rambas. The Gothic area is very touristy and crowded.  There is limited culture and locals avoid it completely.  Walking through the Born area is more local and quiet.  If you need a tour guide contact Made for Spain and Portugal they are perfection.  Go to the market in Barcelona that was our favorite place!",5,2019,11,13
42,Great Place to Stay,"We got off a Celebrity cruise ship and spent the day at The Almanac Barcelona before flying to Texas the following afternoon.  Our room was clean and I mean clean, everything was in perfect condition, great bathroom and modern technology.  Nela helped us with airline boarding passes and arranged transportation to airport the next day, she was fanyastic !  We used the roof top pool, great views of Barcelona, towels at pool, chaise lounges and of course a bar by pool, very relaxing. Next time I'm in Barcelona I will stay at the Almanac. Oh and breakfast was very good I had the French toast.",5,2019,11,13
42,Beautiful Hotel & Great Service,"We booked the Almanac to celebrate our wedding anniversary. 
The hotel acknowledged our anniversary with a lovely welcome note, chocolate dipped strawberries & Cava. This was such a nice touch. 
Our room had an amazing view over the street & was spotlessly clean. 
Housekeeping even checked that we were happy with the room. 
There was lots of choice for breakfast & the rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit. 
This was our first visit to Barcelona & we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ",5,2019,11,12

42,1st visit to Barcelona,"The Almanac Barcelona did not disappoint.  Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and the location was very central.

The rooms were extremely comfortable, great nights sleep and a shower that was heaven sent!  It had all the amenities you would ever need plus a phone you could take outside as you explored this amazing city which included with free international calls!

The rooftop bar had amazing views across the city including the cathedral.   I would definitely stay at the Almanac again. ",5,2019,11,02
42,Wonderful,"This hotel is wonderful.  Perfect location near many of the sites.  The staff, service, rooms and restaurants are excellent.  We were a small group of older women traveling together and they took great care of us all while there were demonstrations in the city.  There restaurant recommendations were outstanding and any need accommodated.  Superb service!  The rooms are well appointed, great beds, sufficient space and a wonderful bathroom with two sinks, excellent shower with lots of water force (no trickle shower here) and a private toilet area.  The bathroom doors open to the sleeping area but are can be closed for full privacy.  And the total blackout shades, make sleeping a dream.  Bathrobes and slippers provided.  The room has a US style hairdryer, and there is free coffee, expresso tea (Nespresso) in the room; mini bar too for extra $.  The included breakfast is great, wonderful selection of cooked items, fruit, pastries and ham Iberico etc.  Other food at the main restaurant for lunch or dinner is excellent, try the grilled octopus it is wonderful.  The rooftop bar is a nice place for a glass of wine and view across the city.  Would be lovely if the rooftop bar had a few more food options.  We will stay here the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2019,10,30
42,"Extraordinary hotel, service and comfort - a true gem","Loved this hotel from first standing outside watching it, until checking out.
Extremely friendly personal everywhere - reception, porters, house keeping and bar/restaurant. 
The room was spacious with a gigantic and wonderfully comfortable bed, to not mention the bed linen, I don't think I ever slept as good in any hotel before. The whole room was controlled from these digital terminals by the bed; lights, window blinds etc.
Loved the marble bathroom and the lit up toilet if entering in the dark. All those small things have been considered when creating this fantastic hotel.
We had one of these rooms with a sofa in the built out window. Just sitting there looking at the people in the street was a joy in its own right.
Make sure to not miss a visit to the Rooftop bar with great views over Barcelona.
The location was also superb, within walking distance of everything, the Gaudi house was just some blocks away and the main shopping was literally just around the corner.
Will definitely stay at Almanac then next time we go to Barcelona.",5,2019,10,27
42,Great!,"The hotel is magnificent, excellent location, impeccable cleanliness, very helpful staff. tomorrow we ordered to the room through the app, very convenient, breakfast is delicious. we will definitely come back",5,2019,10,22

42,Fantastic days in Almanac,Amanac hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. The valet parking is efficient. The staffs are always friendly and considering all the details for guests. They even prepare for bottle water for the guests who are going out.,5,2019,10,17
42,wonderful hotel in perfect location,"If only every city had an Almanac! Fabulous achingly cool modern rooms (ours had a  terrace), friendly staff and stunning rooftop bar/lounge with  views. Great central location (though on a busy road). Staff really helpful and friendly. It made for a prefect weekend break.",5,2019,10,16
42,Incredible Hotel,"We stayed at the Almanac and loved everything about our stay. The location is perfect, the rooms are beautiful, immaculate and the beds are amazing! What sets the Almanac apart though, is the EXCELLENT service that you receive from every employee there. Truly top notch. The restaurant was delicious and the roof top bar views were awesome! The hotel is only 2 years old and it’s a gem. We will definitely stay here on all future visits. The only thing I wish it had was Netflix for watching shows in English, they did have CNN and Disney in English but that was all. ",5,2019,10,15
42,Barcelona Gem,"This is a wonderful hotel with thoughtful, friendly and caring staff who go the extra mile to make your stay a great experience. 

We stayed for a few nights whilst we visited the city for the first time. Arriving in the morning we were fortunate to be given early access to our room. 

Despite this being a very central location the room was an excellent size. All the amenities you could imagine including capsule coffee and tea machines. 

The hotel is located on a main road but you can watch the bustle from the street in the quiet of your room as it is calm within. 

The breakfasts are worth including in the stay. They are varied and personal and set you up well for the day. 
The rooftop bar is a great place to see the city at night. 

However the real Stars are the staff. Always happy to help in many ways and we were guided to some excellent restaurants from the concierge. We really felt they all went the extra mile. ",5,2019,10,12
42,First Class all the Way,"From the arrival, to the room, to the restaurants to the departure everything was first class. The people were amazing. The staff were available, knowledgable and spoke great English. The room was comfort all the way and very high tech in a good way. And a perfect location to walk anywhere.",5,2019,10,11
42,Great location and excellent service.  ,"This hotel is in la Gran Via near La Rambla. It is located near all major attractions in Barcelona and good restaurants.  It has modern appliances in the room such as a tablet and an android phone which you can use to control the lightening, curtains and other amenities in the room.  The concierge service was excellent. The staff very professional, helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was great; it offers a lot of options.  In general, we really like this hotel.  The hotel has a very nice rooftop with beautiful views and a bar. My only criticism is the service in the rooftop.  It seems that they were short in staff and the service was very slow and disorganized. I highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2019,10,11
42,Exceptional Property and Staff,"From our arrival to departure, the Almanac Hotel Barcelona was 5 stars.  I would definitely stay here next time we are in Barcelona. The staff treated us with ""White Glove"" service, and the property was exceptional.",5,2019,10,10

42,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights in October at hotel's 6th floor. The hotel/room was very clean, with some view of the sea if you stay at higher floors. The breakfast was excellent, with a good variety of fresh fruit juices and breads and omelets, the staff are friendly and very helpful. We'll stay in the hotel again. Highly recommended.",5,2019,10,09

42,Weekend Barcelona visit,"I landed in Barcelona with my wife and 11 month old baby daughter on Saturday 21 September. We checked in at the Almanac and from the off, the decor, service and lay out of our suite was all magnificent.

Our room was so well set out, with a magnificent window looking out onto Barcelona, excellent  black out blinds and a beautiful en suite.

V good location in Barcelona and super friendly staff. The roof top pool is small but the views are superlative.

I will certainly return....",5,2019,10,08
42,5 Start Hotel in Barcelona All Around,"HIGHLY Recommend The Almanac.  The hotel is in a great location.  Close to many things but not overrun with foot traffic.

42,FANTASTICO,"This hotel is perfectly located 
The service is AMAZING.  The bar manager,  Diego is INCREDIBLE.  He had never heard of Blue Cheese stuffed olives and when we requested them he went and got the cheese and had them for us the next night.
The rooms are spacious, quiet and clean with free phone calls anywhere.
SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE",5,2019,10,03
42,One of the best 5 star boutiques in Barcelona,"We have been here a few times now. 
The place is very consistent in its superior 5 star service and attention to detail. 
The rooms are done to extremely high standard with lots of design, modern art and domotics. 
The restaurant in the evening is fine dining and breakfast is sophisticated. 
They have a superb rooftop bar, pure class and style. 
Great attitude of staff. 
Right in the centre. 
Must go to place. ",5,2019,10,02
42,Almanac short stay,"The hotel is amazing the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The service is remarkable, room technology first class. 
Breakfast is definitely a must buffet and table service all included, champagne and birthday cake for my wife really added to the occasion.",5,2019,10,02
42,Almanac Barcelona,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Almanac Barcelona for 5 nights the first week of September.  We had a truly outstanding experience.  The property is is well maintained and the location is outstanding from a touring perspective.  From the moment you arrive the staff is extremely friendly and eager to assist in any way necessary.  We particularly enjoyed Azimuth both in the afternoon to sit in the sun and relax after sightseeing to having a cocktail in the evening after dinner.  While the entire hotel staff is outstanding, the Azimuth staff could not have treated us any better with particular mention of Luigi, Alex, Oceane, Romane and Diog.  Would not hesitate to recommend the Almanac to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona. ",5,2019,10,01
42,One night in Barcelona,"Passing through Barcelona on the way to Copenhagen, we had the pleasure of staying at the Almanac for a night. The staff couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating. We arrived earlier than the room was available so we were shown to facilities in order to freshen up. The concierge gave us one day ideas in order to get an overview of the city. We were in a great location so the Almanac couldn’t have been a better place to stay. We would stay here again for sure.",5,2019,10,01
42,The staff is fantastic,"The staff is fantastic, everyone made us feel warm and welcome, the concierge was extremely helpful in finding just the right restaurants and details about sites.   We stayed seven nights in one of the suites , with a large balcony .the bed and sheets were extremely plush and comfortable . Be aware breakfast is extremely expensive €70 for breakfast for my husband and myself  At $1000+  Dollars a day it should be included .. The technology of the cell phone is kind of silly took me three days to figure out how to call the front desk  and one day I had to turn the lights on and off .. The location of the property is absolutely perfect and very easy to catch a cab which we did every day . The rooftop deck has wonderful views and a great bar staff. ",4,2019,09,28
42,"Brilliant staff, brilliant location, high tech","We had a most enjoyable stay at the Almanac for a couple of days. Great location, with staff who are the most professional, friendly, helpful and courteous I have encountered for a long time. Their professionalism made a significant positive difference to our Barcelona experience. The hotel is new, and it shows, in a positive way. The high tech is very much that. Open the door to your room to enter, and the curtains automatically slide open, as an example. Impressive. I counted four screens on the table next to our bed. However, there was a hiccup on our first night. We were woken at 1am by a beeping from one of the devices. Deeply asleep, I struggled to identify the source. And then, frustratingly, it stopped, before I could identify where it was coming from. For only a few minutes, before starting again, this time accelerating in frequency, before stopping again. I called reception, but the guy I spoke to was unable to assist, although he did offer to come up to see what he could do to assist. Not much point, as the noise had now stopped and we were in bed. After waiting in a state of high alert for an hour for the noise to resume, I was able to get back to sleep, as it had mercifully lapsed into silence.  In the morning, after considerable effort, I was able to identify the culprit amongst the four screens. The alarm clock. However, the subtle trick was that, to switch it off, you had to turn it upside down. There is no ' off ' switch, believe it or not. Not something you would automatically think of. My tip to the hotel would be to explain this subtlety  to all guests when they check-in, and also to check what time the alarm has been set to by previous guests, changing those that have been set to the wee hours. This aside, every aspect of our stay was impeccable. Very much a top of the range hotel. To be recommended.",5,2019,09,23
42,Deserves the 5 star rating +++,"My wife and I spent 7 perfect night at this very modern and high tech hotel. The room was impeccably clean and the service was exceptional. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly.

We have stayed at many luxury hotels before but I can safely say that the Almanac is high on our list of favorites. The room was extremely comfortable and the shower and bathroom facilities were magnificent. The high tech amenities like the touch screen controls on both side of the bed, the bluetooth connection to the sound on the TV that enables you to stream you own music collection, the ample USB connections and power outlets and the complementary beverages

The location is excellent in that it is very close to Passieg de Gracia and the Metro station as well as the Gothic quarter. We were able to walk to almost all the top tourist locations.

In spite of the central location, the room was not noisy due to the excellent patio door that blocked the sound almost entirely.

We had the perfect stay and are eager to return!",5,2019,09,20
42,Amazing stay,"Excellent very modern hotel. Fantastic location close to the Rambla. Everything was perfect for this short trip with my husband. We have to thank Selim Merichko  for that : he took care of our booking, had very sweet attentions for the decoration of our room when we arrived, recommended nearby places and made our check out smooth and comfortable despite pur very late flight back home. Would definitely come back. ",5,2019,09,20
42,Really 6 star!,"Great hotel ! One of the best I've staid in for a long time !

The rooms are big enough , bathroom is great - even the toilet is great ! ( Bidet and good quality paper !) 
The tech in the rooms is fabulous - walk in the door , the curtain open an the lights come on! 
Best pillows, comfy bed , quiet ...Fantastic shower .

42,Exceptional staff and service first class,"The warmest of welcomes greets you as you arrive at this exceptional establishment. We’ve been so struck by the service level, everything was no bother including the fastest Aperol Spritz to extremely attentive staff, including rapid responses to requests. Already planning a return, especially as the staff genuinely seek to deal with every request and actively want to help in a way I’ve not seen in other hotels. We’re regular travellers to Barcelona but ended up spending most of the time within the stunning facilities. Thank you!",5,2019,08,26
42,Excellent place to stay,Friendly and helpful staff set the tone for this hotel from the minute you drive up upside.  On entering the experience just continues.

42,Excellent hotel and exceptional service,"From the moment you enter the hotel you are given a truly five star service. Every single member of staff from reception, bar staff, waiting staff and cleaners offered a tremendous service delivered with real sincerity. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2019,08,20
42,a wonderful stay in Barcelona,"We booked two nights at the Almanac Barcelona through the AMEX hotel program.   The property, staff and room could not have been nicer.  The staff in particular was amazing-always friendly and looking to help with suggestions and directions.  My wife and I agreed that this was our best hotel experience ever, and that is with an extensive history of travel globally.",5,2019,08,19
42,Great hotel with a great staff ,This hotel was just perfect. The rooms are beautiful and the staff is excellent. We stayed here for 4 nights and had 2 rooms. The rooms are a great size. The breakfast was one of the best breakfasts we had in Spain. The concierge would make us dinner reservations and direct us every night. We had a day trip planned to costa brava and the hotel packed each family a beach bag with towels to take on the bus with us in the morning. The hotel manager Jose was very accommodating. My family loved this hotel! ,5,2019,08,15
42,This hotel and staff is just perfect !,"just Go to this hotel, nice decorated rooms, clean rooms, good beds, best breakfast ever, Staff who want to help you to enjoy your stay in Barcelona ! And a very nice rooftop lounge. Suggestions from the Concierge for places to have diner where amazing. And last but not least every body speaks English !",5,2019,08,14
42,Superb from  start to finish!,"We booked a 4 day trip from the UK to Barcelona to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the hotel Almanac was just the perfect base from which to explore the fabulous city of Barcelona.
We chose the hotel based on its reviews and its location, close to the Gothic Quarter and central and close to the major transport routes and options.
From the minute we arrived the service and welcome from the staff was exceptional, actually prior to our arrival the email exchanges i had with Nela and her team were superb, a personal touch rarely afforded in the majority of hotels.

The décor of the hotel was great and the design of the hotel was definitely one for Instagram! 

The room was beautiful, clean, modern and spacious. It was utterly silent in the evening, given our proximity to the main road outside and the lifts outside our room you could have heard a pin drop at night. This coupled with the brilliant blackout curtains and the beautifully comfortable beds and pillows meant we both had amazing nights sleep after busy days/nights in Barcelona.

The hotel boasts a really nice rooftop bar and pool, nothing was ever too much trouble and when we asked for cocktails off of the menu such as my Old Fashioned it was expertly prepared by the bar staff. The service was friendly and accommodating without being intrusive, just brilliant.

I would advise anybody thinking of booking this hotel to do so. I've travelled both for business and pleasure all over the world and this hotel was in my top 3 and shamed some much more expensive hotels who could do well to replicate this level of comfort.",5,2019,08,13
42,perfect hotel 🥰,"i suggest everybody to go in this hotel, sleep is perfect🥰 , the pool is perfect🥰, the location perfect🥰. is in the center of barcelona , the service is very very good, the personel is more polite and accurate. ",5,2019,08,11
42,Fabulous hotel.,"Arrived at the hotel and it was stunning, decor is amazing and staff are well presented. 
When checking in they wanted £100 a night incase any damages or any room service orders ... I think this was far too expensive to act as a deposit but they waived it and also gave us £50 credit to use in the hotel on food/drinks.

Room wasn’t ready but the manager showed us to the roof top which has the most fabulous views, staff on the rooftop where so nice. We sat on the roof top for just over an hour then was takin to our room.

The room was beautiful, it was a gallery room.. enough space for the two of us.. bathroom was beautiful with an amazing power shower we had lovely fluffy dressing gowns and slippers. Great devices like the Samsung phone and tablet to help contact front desk, order food/drinks and control the lighting and curtains! Very easy to use! 
Room service was very quick, which was great

The management put birthday cake and a bottle of cava in the room to celebrate a birthday, it was complimentary absolutely lovely of them! 

Went for breakfast in the Linia restaurant and both ordered eggs Benedict, it wasn’t cooked to our preference but we was in a rush to go see the sights so didn’t say anything.. 
The reception staff helped us book reservations for a meal later in the evening. They gave us plenty of options but we decided to go the Patagonia a very short walk from hotel and it was the best steak we have ever had!

When checking out early in the morning to get to the airport they did try and charge us for the cava but the manager confirmed it was complimentary, it was a little misunderstanding. 

The hotel was amazing and we would definitely go back there.. perfect spot in The city! I would definitely recommend",4,2019,08,11
42,Form Without Substance and Functionality,"First the good points -
Breakfast was excellent. Very good spread. 
The free flow bar with mineral water and coke was certainly welcome
This 5 star hotel is exemplary of quite a few of today's independent luxury class hoteliers who aspire to be in this segment by naively thinking all it takes is a big budget and a snazzy interior decorator 
But it takes far more than that. Let's first talk about the decor. The toilet door weighs a ton to open. Its one thing to have a main door that is heavy and thick for fire protection purposes.  I need both arms to open the door and I'm a guy that works out in the gym twice a week.
The shower is big but there is NO space to put your personal toiletries. You are compelled to use their stuff as such or place your shampoo on the floor
The trash bin is tucked away with a lid on a plank below the sink. Nice design but the plank is also where they place clean towels. So much for hygiene considerations
There is also no luggage rack to put your luggage. You have to place your check in luggage inside the wardrobe. And you probably cant close the wardrobe fully after that

Operations- the front staff are very helpful but there is disconnect with the backroom ops. Housekeeping is quite a mess and obviously they aren't well trained.
My friends took a 2 room suite. One room was cleaned but the other wasn't. 
As for my room, the room wasn't cleaned when I returned past 3pm. For a 3 night stay, the laundry bag wasn't replaced. And for some strange reason the rooms we were in were given 1 small face towel. My friends had to share 1 small towel between the 2 of them. After paying for all the plush furnishings, they have no more budget to buy more face towels?
The drinks cooler in my room wasn't working as well and I had to drink warm coke. It was only after FOUR requests (the last being a personal face to face request) at the front desk that they sent someone to fix the problem. They should just give a small bar fridge.

Summary.
No expense at decor, but obviously the designer has ruled that form is more important than substance. Clearly he has no clue what a traveller really needs
Operationally, the management also has little inkling of operational deficiencies and line staff suffer from inadequate training (how else can you explain one cleaned and one uncleaned room in same suite)?",3,2019,08,11
42,"Very Good Hotel, Friendly Staff, Great Breakfast","This is a really great hotel! Overall, our experience here was very good. It is a relatively smaller hotel (8 floors...7 floors for rooms, and rooftop bar/pool), so the staff can be very attentive and responsive, and in fact, the the staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and they are ""smart rooms"" and they even have a ""smart toilet!"" LOL. 
The breakfast was very good (especially the made to order items); the juice bar menu was a  nice surprise.  They also give you a cell phone that you can use throughout the city to call anywhere you'd like.",5,2019,08,09
42,Luxury in the City Center,"The Almanac Hotel was beautiful and the staff were charming and helpful. The rooms were luxurious and well done. The breakfast was delicious and reasonable. The staff was always there to help with suggestions, reservations and directions. ",5,2019,08,07
42,wonderful hotel - all aspects,We arrived at Almanac Barcelona after touring the Mediterranean onboard a cruise ship. We requested for early-check in which was granted. My wife had to see an eye doctor and the concierge (Danny) made sure she got an appointment in one of the best eye clinics in Spain. The rooms were in excellent condition with state of the art technology. Perfect stay all round.,5,2019,08,05
42,Great location & service,"The location and service are excellent. The overall design and concept are very nice, but the interior construction quality needs to be improved. Breakfast selection is lower than of expectation, but the service was great unless the long waiting time. ",4,2019,08,03
42,Fantastic stay at the Almanac!,"I highly recommend the Almanac!  We debated which hotel to stay in with our two teenagers and the Almanac was the perfect choice.  The hotel and rooms are modern and well-set up and all of the employees who work there (from reception, concierge, bellman, rooftop bar and housekeeping) are wonderful.  The service is first-rate and the rooftop bar and pool were perfect for relaxing at the end of the day.  And the central location could not be better.  I can’t imagine any other hotel in Barcelona would be a better choice!",5,2019,08,02
42,Beautiful modern hotel ,"The Almanac is a fabulous new hotel, located in one of the most beautiful areas in Barcelona. The location is superb, with most of the main sights within walking distance or a short taxi ride. There are tons of great restaurants, bars and cafes nearby. 
The design of the hotel is beautiful, and the rooms are gorgeous with beautiful white marble bathrooms. We stayed in a junior suite, which was very spacious, with a lovely balcony. Everything is very high tech, but easy to operate. 
Breakfast at Linia was fantastic, with a great buffet spread as well as dishes cooked to order. The rooftop bar/lounge is a wonderful place to just chill and have a drink or bite to eat, with fantastic views of the city. There’s also a small pool on the rooftop, meant for just relaxing by. The small steam/sauna room is also wonderful to relax in after a busy day sightseeing. The couple of times we were there, we had the place to ourselves. 
Now for the best, the staff, who no matter where, at the concierge, in the restaurants, or room service, were absolutely wonderful. They were all so pleasant and so helpful all the time. The concierge made careful selections for us regarding restaurant bookings and shopping which were terrific. A special thank you to all the staff, and a very special thank you to Adria, Joan, and Selim at concierge. Thank you also for the champagne and dessert to celebrate our anniversary! Will definitely be coming back. ",5,2019,07,31
42,Beautiful,I stayed for two days at the Almanac and I can only say it was wonderful. The staff is incredible! Xenia the guest relations welcomed us in the lobby with a big smile and took the time to sit with us and show in a map everything of Barcelona. She also managed to change our room just in minutes as we wanted a twin bed. The rooms are spacious and very nice. For sure we will be back!!,5,2019,07,30
42,top!,Loved the staff and the room accommodations. Would definitely come back and enjoy the surroundings. Concierge is top notch. Great service all the way around. Their breakfast was very good as well. We had lunch  in their restaurant. I will stay again. Enjoy the hotel!,5,2019,07,29
42,excellent hotel,"Perfect beautiful clean hotel with everything you could hope for, great location and wonderful dining. Not much more to say except I would recommend to everyone I know.

42,Amazing,"The hotel is absolutely amazing and the staff couldn’t do enough for me and my guest and it’s so close to the centre of the city, I would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Barcelona. They also helped us book a taxi to the airport. ",5,2019,07,25
42,Will be back!,"This hotel was great. Location is perfect. Rooms, cleanliness, amenities, bed, breakfast, rooftop and most importantly service was just perfect. The concierge was also great in prearranging all our needs prior to arrival. 

Quick story—
At about 1pm we were on our way from the airport to your hotel. My wife wasn’t feeling great. I called your hotel and asked if you could have a room ready for us. When I got to the hotel —-I WAS NEVER CHECKED IN TO A ROOM SO QUICKLY. Literally 3 minutes later we were in our room. Furthermore the staff wanted to know what else we would need assistance with-medicine etc...you delivered water, tea and a kettle to our room moments later. Thank you and the amazing staff. It was really appreciated. WE ARE COMING BACK!!",5,2019,07,25
42,Overrated,Nice hotel with nice rooms.  Staff is eager to please.  Service at breakfast buffet was very slow and disorganized.  Location is good if you want to be near shopping.  Roof top lounge/bar is totally dead.  Quiet and boring compared to other hotels in the city.  ,4,2019,07,14
42,Perfection!,"We visited Barcelona for business (husband) & leisure (me and child).  I debated between hotels Almanac, Majestic, Las Serras and Arts.  Almanac was the perfect choice.
The most distinguishing factor of the hotel is its staff.  I read a prior review suggesting that the staff was not polished.  I could not disagree more.  Every person we encountered at the hotel was kind, considerate, helpful and friendly. They went out of their way to please us, and swiftly facilitated us with upgrading our room to the phenomenal terrace suite when we felt the first was too small for the three of us.  They were amazing with our son and very thoughtful on my birthday. (Special thanks to Jose, who is an asset to this hotel -- our interactions with him will remain a fond memory of our trip.)  
The location was ideal.  Hotel Almanac is on the Fifth Ave. of Barc., aside on a corner, & convenient to sights & shopping.  If unsure whether to stay closer to the beach or here, stay here!  
The hotel facilities sparkle - new in every way, the rooms are comfortable and luxurious, and the bed is dreamy.  The pool is more of a wading pool, but was ideal for our six-year old and for our quick refreshment.  The roof is a gorgeous haven from the bustling city. 
The technology is unmatched.  Every room is equipped with a personal cell phone for you to take as you explore.  The drapery is electronic, the lights are digital… everything is easy.  
Our stay at Hotel Almanac left us wanting for nothing.  We look forward to returning!

Beautiful room...great bathroom/shower...pillows...bed (king...shared with daughter)...super comfortable...LOVEloveLOVE control panels (lights/air/room service)...had to ask for wash cloths each day...but rooms are very clean.

Love this hotel!
Staff excels at helping with any/all issues.",5,2019,07,10
42,Good service boutique hotel with modern rooms,"i love the ambiance of this hotel.
i love the service during check in,my stay and check out.
i love the location of the hotel which situated one block away from the busy main road and close by the catalunya square with less than 5 mins walk.",5,2019,07,08
42,Great hotel! Perfect location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Almanac hotel. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by everybody. Nela, one of the customer service supervisors, was especially welcoming. She sat down with us at a small table in the lobby, oriented us to the hotel, and gave us some great suggestions regarding restaurants and things to do. She patiently marked them all on a map for us. 

The hotel location was perfect! It was within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do. Our room was nicely decorated, spacious, and very comfortable. Although the hotel management appeared to pride themselves on some of the high tech features, we could have done without the complicated lighting switches and power curtains. 

The rooftop pool was small, but had a great view. There were several lounge chairs and other comfortable seating for relaxing. Drinks could be ordered from the rooftop bar. 

All the staff were pleasant and helpful. Besides Nela, one of the bellmen, Samir, was particularly friendly and eager to please. 

Overall an excellent stay and we plan to go back.",5,2019,07,07
42,Best customer service at this lovely boutique hotel,"From the moment we arrived at the Almanac we were greeted with genuine kindness and warm hospitality. My flight arrived early at 11am and although a room wasn't ready staff were able to take my bags and let me freshen up in their wellness/spa area. After doing some exploring in the neighbourhood a room was made available to me well before 3pm - thank you for that! 

Our room was very clean, spacious (for Europe), and decked out with lots of tech stuff. There are several panels on the wall that allow you to control lights, curtains, temperature, etc. We loved it in the mornings when we wanted to open the curtains without getting out of bed. There is also a tablet for all room service orders and booking the spa - we didn't book any spa services but used it for room service and it worked great! The beds are very comfortable, sheets are good quality, pillows were a little soft for my liking but that's totally a personal preference thing. The shower is amazing! 

The rooftop is a highlight. It has lots of seating, nice views, a shallow wading pool which was a great reprieve from the afternoon sun and a gelato station. The gelato was stellar, I wish I had eaten more of it. :) Staff on hand were super friendly. 

Overall we absolutely loved our stay and have already recommended it to friends. A big thank you to all the staff who were so kind, warm and always asking how they can help make our stay better. ",5,2019,07,07
42,"Excellent hotel, fantastic service, fabulous location","We are just back from a week-long stay at Almanac Barcelona. What a wonderful property! We have a fantastic holiday, thanks in large part to the Almanac. 

Start with the location of the hotel. Almanac is located in one block from Passeig de Gracia and three blocks from La Ramblas. Close to all the ""action"" but far enough away to avoid the noise. 

The staff at Almanac are friendly, helpful and efficient. The concierge was only to happy to help with reservations, directions and activity suggestions. When we had a small problem in our room, engineering was up to fix it in less than 10 minutes. 

The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. We thought the automatic curtains were too cool and loved the iPad control center. 

We used the pool area daily. The pool really is only suitable for cooling off, but the rooftop area around it is delightful. In the evening, having cocktails and nibbles rooftop was simply delightful. Plus, the ice cream is sinfully good. 

We very much enjoyed the breakfast (including with our room plan, thank you AmEx) at the hotel. They had a large selection of fruits, cheeses and baked goods along with cooked-to-order hot dishes. 

We loved our stay so much, when we return to Barca in the fall, we will stay there again. This is now our favorite hotel in Barcelona.",5,2019,07,04
42,Best Hotel in Barcelona,We definitely enjoyed our honeymoon stay in this hotel. Our suite had an amazing view with great amenities. Everyone in the hotel were so friendly and accommodating as well! We can't wait to go back again! ,5,2019,07,04
42,Excellent experience with top notch hospitality ,"Super clean, modern and comfortable beds.  

The staff is friendly and genuinely cares about your experience.  

The doors in the hallway opening and closing are loud but that’s literally the only thing wrong.  ",5,2019,06,29
42,Comfortable stay,"Gallery room I stayed is calm by facing inside of the block.  
Staffs have quick and have listened patiently for Japanese English.
A location near subway ""Passeig de Gracia"" is convenient for sightseeing.
Staffs might be young.",4,2019,06,23
42,Quite satisfying stay!,"Room is expensive! But overall we were quite satisfied with the room quality clean and luxurious. We stayed in Junior Suite room. Staff and service is also nice. We have no complain about this hotel. Recommended, if you have space cash to burn!",5,2019,06,22
42,We love the Almanac,"This was a beautiful hotel to stay in. After staying in a few nice hotels in Spain and France, the Almanac was the stand out.
The rooms were big, and beautiful. The technology in the rooms was really good, but the beautiful room design and fit out was the best.
The daily breakfast was very good, and the roof top pool and bar was a gorgeous place to chill, or have a drink and unwind after a busy day.
The staff at the hotel were amazing and went beyond to make sure we were looked after.
Sameer on the concierge desk was very helpful to us, and on check out,was able to quickly help me with an item left in our room while the taxi waited. 
The hotel was within walking distance to the old town, where we would wander to for lunch or dinner each day.
I would highly recommend this beautiful boutique hotel, we loved it.",5,2019,06,22
42,Excellent,"There for my wedding, couldn't have had a better experience. It was amazing, thank you so much.The staff, the food, the room, the overall experience, EXCELLENT. We will be back and look forward to another enjoyable stay.",5,2019,06,18
42,First time in Barcelona ,"The Almanac Hotel is very well located near the high street shopping areas and near a lot of good restaurants.We walked everywhere. It’s service is superb and the breakfast was great. The staff are very friendly and helpful. 
Our room was very well appointed and comfortable. My only gripe, be it trivial , was that the toilet door has a spring loaded arm that closed the door and made me feel like I was closed in a closet. 

",5,2019,06,16
42,Fantastic stay,"Stayed at the Almanac for 3 nights and couldn't have had a more lovely stay. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. Helping us before we checked in with restaurant recommendations and helping to make reservations. We stayed in a junior suite and it was gorgeous! Lovely big room with fantastic amenities. Everything is controlled electronically, such as the lights, curtains and volume on the TV. They provide a tablet and a mobile phone for you to use which includes complimentary local and international phone calls. 

The location is perfect for Barcelona and so many areas within easy walking distance. The best way to discover Barcelona is on foot anyway. 

The staff were so lovely. Although we didn't have breakfast or eat in the main restaurant we did enjoy a lot of time upstairs on their roof terrace and had some food there which was delicious. The roof terrace has something happening each night over the weekend. E.g. Sunday they had live music which was great when enjoying some pre dinner drinks. 

I would definitely return and can't wait to come back!",5,2019,06,13
42,fantastic,"magnificent view from the rooftop bar (your can see the whole centre of Barcelona)
 - very friendly and helpfull staff -
 luxurious and clean rooms -
 very good breakfast 
 minibar is included and that is exceptional.
the hotel is really in the centre of Barcelona, you can do everything by foot
we were there with our 3 kids and we had a wonderful time",5,2019,06,03
42,Disappointing but with glimmers of excellence.,"We had 2 rooms. Many problems with A/C, Engineer disturbing us (could they not have fixed it whilst we were out all day instead of when our son was opening his presents and having cake?) No Hot water one night after a sticky hot day of sightseeing, Broken Blackout blinds waking us very early, Terrible forgetful service on the Roof Terrace and an ability to remove dirty plates and glasses from our table. We booked also because of the pool but you can't swim in it, it's so shallow and small and it's unheated. Final straw - none of the attachments actually fitted the hairdryer (pet hate)

But...Lovely welcome. Super clean Hotel. When we had hot water the showers were great. Beds and pillows comfortable, good towels, nice toiletries. Staff generally very friendly. Huge delicious selection at Breakfast with truly excellent service. Concierge very good. We all loved the ice cream wagon on the Roof Terrace, great ice cream. But watch your bill at check out. Breakfast was supposed to be included in our rate but they had sneaked in extra charges for breakfast which we had to get them to remove. Which after all our problems was the last nail in the coffin.",2,2019,06,02
42,"very contemporary , high tech hotel , bu I expected more form this hotel","I stayed only for one night. it is hard to give reasonable review , but I can tell what I did not like. I arrived at 10 pm and concierge greeted me with with words "" let me check if your room is ready for you "" I would expect that at this late time it shell be ready . When I went to the room 212 , the remote control/cellphone with operates and control all service in the room showed the error , the automatic curtence did not work , without remote control i could not connect with concierge. when I went to the terrace level , part of it was closed for the private event. the rest of terrace had a set up not allowing private table .To my opinion if hotel has a little of common area they cannot have private events , because it puts the guest into inconvenience
what I liked ? Shower and bed , bed was amazing , everything in the room  was extremely clean",4,2019,05,31
42,Best Service Ever,"We've stayed at many 5 star hotels over decades. The level of service we received at the Almanac was the best we've every experienced. In every interaction with their staff, the service was excellent. The location is fantastic and central to everything. The rooms and facilities were also top notch.",5,2019,05,27
42,Absolutley stunning and perfect service!,I joined my husband who was on a work trip in Barcelona and was delighted by the hotel. Firstly by the staff who were all lovely and by the hotel itself. It was modern and stylist with everthing you could want. I enjoyed a lovely lounge by the roof top pool and a message in the treatme t rooms. This trip was my first short trip away from my baby and I'm so glad that the Almanac delivered what I was hoping for and more.,5,2019,05,24
42,Hotel Almanac Barcelona,The location of the hotel is excellent.  The staff was very proficient and contributed greatly to our enjoyment of the City. The food was excellent and service staff attentive. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,05,22
42,Great stay in a great hotel,"We had a lovely time in Hotel Almanac. All the members of the staff were great and very friendly. Our room was excellent, spacious and we had a very warm welcome. We enjoyed a lovely dinner (we chose the set menu) and breakfast was also a good experience. We only visited Azimuth roof terrace to see it but didn't spend time there, but it look as a great place to have a drink and enjoy the nice music. The bed was incredibly comfortable!! We look forward to be back in our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,05,21
42,How do you Amazing in Catalan?,"My two friends and I stayed in this hotel last week and all I can tell you is that it is beyond AMAZING! 

We arrived really early in the morning and the hotel managed to have our rooms ready within 30 minutes of our arrival which really makes all the difference especially when you just got off a 7-hour red-eye flight. 

2 of us stayed in the Almanac rooms were quite spacious for a European hotel and one of our friends stayed in the Terrace Suite which is beyond incredible. The Almanac room is very modern (automatic blinds, sound system etc.) and everything works seamlessly. The toilet is separate from the bathroom which is fantastic from a hygiene perspective. There was a little balcony as well which was a nice touch especially in the morning when you want to step outside for a quick breath of fresh air. 

Location wise you couldn't ask for a better spot in all of Barcelona. You're two minutes away from Plaça de Catalunya and Passeig de Gràcia which has all the nice shops and restaurants. If you're looking to get to the beach, it's about a 20 minute (2 km) walk. If you want the uber-tourist street of La Rambla, it's about a 10-15 minute walk (although I don't recommend it as it's super crowded, touristy and full of pickpockets). 

Back to the hotel itself. My friend stayed in the Almanac terrace suite which is one of the nicest rooms I've seen in Europe. Super spacious, modern and the terrace is massive! If you can afford it, I highly recommend that you check it out. 

My only negative comment is related to the rooftop bar....if wasn't happening on any of the nights and it seemed more like an after-thought. It's a pity because you can convert that space into one of the hottest spots in Barcelona if you get the right chef  and event organizers to manage the space. I'm sure that this will probably happen soon. Lastly, please do something about the coffee in the lobby area, it's really not good at all! 

Lastly and in terms of food, we had breakfast twice at the restaurant in the main lobby and the experience was quite good overall. I like the fact that there aren't a million choices, it's small, great quality and the service is excellent. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place and I'll definitely be staying here the next time I visit the people city of Barca.",5,2019,05,15
42,5 Star rating,"Overall awesome!! Friendly & professional staff who cater to guests every need!!
Room was large with walk in shower & separate water closet!  Decor was very modern & sophisticated!! Spa was well equipped with sauna, showers & steam room.",5,2019,05,12
42,Saved the day,"We got into the hotel early and were told we could not check in to our room for awhile.
After several hours we went back to the desk and asked to get into a room.We wanted to rest after the overnight flight. That is when Nela came to our rescue.She immediately sensed our predicament and got us into a room.

The rest of the visit was excellent everyone did a good job, but Nela was the person that made our stay a positive one.",5,2019,05,10
42,Excellence at its best!,"Our stay at the Almanac was the end of a 3 week tour through Spain and Morocco. The goal was to pamper ourselves with a completely luxury stay and a perfectly located hotel and not have to want for anything. The goal was not only met but exceeded! Every staff member was incredible, so friendly, helpful and truly caring. The accommodations could not have been better! the room was spectacular with a 180 degree view of Barcelona. The technology in the room was killer and the Duravit washlet toilet was a dream!!! Room service was fantastic, the rooftop bar so much fun and breakfast was excellent! The Almanac is the only place I will stay when in Barcelona!!!",5,2019,05,07
42,5* hotel 5* location 5* staff,"We travel to Europe and Spain a lot. This time we stayed at Almanac Barcelona with our 1.5 years old baby. The reception staff and the concierge were so kind, attentive and helpful. We would like to say special thank you to Mr. Ricard Margalef which is one of the most extraordinary hotel concierge we ever enciuntered. He was there for everything and made sure all is ready for us. Also Mr Jose Santos which assisted with checking us in smoothly and other needs as traveling with a baby. Also of course to mention Mr. Michael Cleaver from the management which greeted us when we arrived on behalf of the hotel manager Mr. David Solomon. We believe in service and luxury experience which as you will get when you stay the best hotel in Barcelona - Alamanac. The room was extra clean and high maintained.
Regarding the breakfast it was good but they should work better about the service over there as it was good but not as perfect in other areas :)
We were happy with the parking service as well. 
They left the most beautiful present for our baby, a bath robe and slippers with her name. So cute! We used it during our cruise on that trip it was so thoughtful. 
Don't think twice this a brand new, young and designed hotel with great service at a great location. Can't wait for next time.

42,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"Excellent hotel , friendly accomodating gentke stuff,quiet rooms and relaxing beds.The hole experience staying at Almanac was marvelous,The only thing that I didnt appreciate was the terasse, because when I visited it during an afternoon it was crowdy loud and dirty, Not at all atmospheric",5,2019,05,02
42,Nice stay,"Checked into Hotel Almanac and the service in the lobby was great. Room is clean and well designed. The breakfast was amazing with many options to choose from. The guys in the reception were very helpful and kind. 

Lema, the guest relation manager, (hope you will be reading this) needs however a course on how to treat guests. We had a small issue during our stay, and we think she came ringing on the door two days in a row at 9 in the morning waking us up. And when we stumbled up on her during check-out she kept answering phones serveral times when we were in the middle of a conversation with her and waiting for her to check us out. Not quite the service we are used to... We will despite this give the hotel top rating, since it overall was a good stay, although some people (Lema and the servers at the rooftop bar) could improve on doing their job.",5,2019,04,27
42,Luxury spot in the heart of Barcelona,"Great location and still super quite and comfortable, luxury hotel with amazing interior design . Great staff with good vibes, the roof top is a great plus when the sun is out . Would definitely wait this chain to expand to main Europe cities ",5,2019,04,27
42,Fantastic Hotel,"walking distance to shops, La Rambla, restaurants, metro just about everything.  Excellent hotel with high tech luxurious rooms.  Every member of the staff was beyond polite, friendly and helpful.  Normally I like to try different hotels in different areas when I travel, but if I am fortunate enough to go back to Barcelona I will stay here again!!",5,2019,04,22
42,Wonderful Stay at Almanac Barcelona,"If you have the good fortune to visit Barcelona then the Almanac is terrific place to stay.  The staff was beyond helpful, the design of the hotel and the rooms were outstanding, and the location perfect for us.  I'd highly recommend it.",5,2019,04,22
42,Amazing stay !,"This has to be one of the top hotels in Europe - I was reallly surprised to see the level of hospitality , spacious and tendu room with the latest technology!
The rooms are really elegant and modern and bathroom have this remote controlled bidet spray. The hotel staff was really helpful - especially Sameer (always willing to go out of his way to help out) as well as the concierge / reception staff who guided us on how to get around the city . Would love to stay here again !",5,2019,04,12
42,Excellent Hotel,"Had a brilliant weekend with the wife, hotel was excellent, very up to date as it was only completed in 2018.

We had full electronic control over lighting, heating, cooling and the curtains.

Lovely full height window.

Food was excellent, was a bit unsure about three cost of the breakfast at first but was not disappointed as the quality and choice was excellent and would suit all diners.

Staff were very helpful and a joy to be around.

Will definitely revisit if we go back again and looking forward to new hotels that are opening in other European countries over the next few years.",5,2019,04,11
42,Five star Magic ,"Have just returned from a three night stay at the Almanac in Barcelona. An amazing place with the best staff ever encountered at a hotel. We have stayed at some amazing hotels before (including the Chedi Muscat) and thought the staff at those places were great- they are not a patch as good as everyone at Almanac. The front desk and concierge teams were incredibly polite, professional and helpful. The hotel is modern, with great technology in the bedrooms. It has a lovely roof terrace and very nice restaurant which serves a delicious breakfast. The hotel is perfectly located, close to shops, restaurants and tourist attractions. We couldn’t fault the Almanac and can’t wait to return. ",5,2019,04,08
42,One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in ,"This hotel combines both the advantages of a boutique hotel and of a luxury hotel. The service is incredible (and we used to go to many Four Seasons hotels in Asia!), the place is so beautiful, rooms are first class. You can’t be disappointed.
Areas of improvement:
- It was way too hot in our room. We had to change but it didn’t improve. They had a heat problem during our stay. Hope it’s better now.
- The spa is very small. A pool would have male this hotel perfect.
Anyway, this hotel deserves a 5-star here. Congratulations to the team. We now can’t wait for our next stay in an Almanac hotel somewhere.",5,2019,04,08
42,Trip to Barcelona,"Overall this is a wonderful hotel. Beautiful lobby, very comfortable and modern rooms, great location and the staff is wonderful. I would highly recommend the Almanac Barcelona to anyone looking for first class experience.",5,2019,04,06
42,"Excellent hotel, excellent staff and excellent location","My husband and I recently spent four nights in the Almanac and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel. On Gran Via right in the centre of Barcelona but surprisingly quiet for a city centre hotel (they must have good soundproofing). The taxi from the airport took about 25 mins and cost €27. The staff from the moment we arrived were very friendly and helpful. While we were checking in we were given a glass of water and some sweets along with a voucher for free drinks in the bar. A lovely lady called Victoria checked us in and then showed us to our room 208 on the second floor, an Almanac King Room, overlooking Gran Via. It was a very nice room, quite spacious with a large bed (which was extremely comfortable), table, sofa and leather chair. Plenty of wardrobe and clothes space, a safe and a small fridge with complimentary water and soft drinks as well as a tea and coffee machine. The bathroom has two sinks, a powerful rain shower and a well lit mirror that you can actually see in to put on make up (unlike lots of hotel bathroom mirrors). The toilet is separate from the bathroom. As has been mentioned in other reviews the rooms are very ""techy"" with lighting, a/c and curtains controlled from a panel bedside.
The Azimuth bar on the top floor has amazing views over the city and I am sure it would be a great place when the weather is a bit warmer (just a bit too cold in the evening when we were there in March so we enjoyed the view from inside). There is also a nice bar on the ground floor which was always busy. We did not eat dinner in the restaurant but again it seemed to be busy most evenings. Very nice breakfasts though and the breakfast staff were excellent. Good selection on the buffet and the hot dishes we ordered were very good too.
As I mentioned earlier the location of the hotel is very good and you can walk to most of the popular attractions. We walked to the Sagrada Familia - about 30 minutes (would recommend pre-booking a guided tour), the Gothic quarter, La Rambla, the Boqueria Market. Would also recommend taking the Hop on Hop off tour which leaves from Placa Catalunya and taking a visit to Sant Pau a magnificent art nouveau site an easy stroll up from the Sagrada. Parc Guell needs a taxi, bus or metro to get there. We got a taxi up €10 and then No 24 bus back to the Passeig de Garcia (€4.40 for the two of us)
Lots of shops in the Passeig de Garcia just minutes from the hotel and many restaurants nearby. Would recommend checking out some of the eating places in El National and also Cinco Jotus has very nice tapas.",5,2019,04,04
42,Oleh,"Great experience! Brand new hotel full technologies. Stylish design.Very-very friendly staff. Really high-class service.

42,30th wedding anniversary ,"Can I just say that, this not only is the most stunning hotel I’ve ever stayed at and my hubby and I’ve had  stayed at some stunning  places. Wonderful staff and super informative. Just gorgeous, if I come back to Barcelona we are totally coming back to stay here.  Thank you for up grading us to a Jr Suite for our 30th anniversary, just because I said I wanted a tub. Well I got a tub and a view, they were so helpful And they have a cool phone with directions that you can have locally. They said I can make any international calls anywhere with there phone. 

Love this place!!!
",5,2019,04,01
42,Love this hotel :),"The Almanac is a wonderful hotel in a great central location in Barcelona just steps from the best shopping and walking distance to restaurants and sightseeing/attractions. The rooms are beautiful and modern. The rooms all have individual handheld technology devices that can be used to control room features (temperature, lights, etc), order room service, review hotel features/services, as well as to interact with city guides and maps. We loved the glass window seat which was nice for having a cup of coffee while viewing Barcelona and the city activity below. 

We traveled in late March and the city's weather was comfortable and sunny during the days.

Hotel service was great...front desk help were very friendly and helpful.",5,2019,04,01
42,Treated like Royalty,"I stayed at the Almanac for 2 days between a family vacation and a business trip, and it was one of the nicest hotel experiences I’ve had in a long time!! The hotel itself is lovely - modern, stylish, comfortable and very well located (a short walk to the Gothic quarter and beaches and just off the Passeig de Garcia, Barcelona’s beautiful high end shopping avenue). The rooms are large (by European hotel standards) and well appointed - perfect for catching up on work after a week of vacation. The tech savvy features (curtains that open when you enter, tablet and smartphone available for use during your stay) were nice touches as well. That said, my enthusiastic five star rating is based on the outstanding staff who made me feel like a VIP for the duration of my stay.  From reception to restaurant to spa - to the head of guest relations who greeted me and gave me his card upon arrival (I still don’t know why!), the exceptionally friendly and service oriented staff went above and beyond to make me feel not only welcomed but also important - like my neighborhood walk / meal / coffee / museum tickets / massage / yoga reservations/ taxi scheduling was THE most important thing they were doing that day. In addition, the restaurant is excellent (if somewhat pricey vs other local options) and breakfast (included in my package)  was plentiful and tasty. I took advantage of the hotel gym (clean and adequate) and wellness center (steam room, sauna and treatments) and had an excellent massage after a Bikram yoga class at a studio around the corner.  All in all, I would highly recommend the Almanac for tourists or business travelers! ",5,2019,03,31
42,Nice place,"The Hotel was almost perfect. Extremely friendly personnel.  General view - very good place to stay. Close to many attractions, quiet, comfortable. Stuff is always responsive and friendly. Very important - NO CROWDS. Quiet and clean.

42,Long weekend in Barcelona,"Overall very good and clean hotel with a great location. Everything we needed was at walking distance. Special thanks to Nicolas, a waiter taking care of the restaurant and roof top bar: Top quality service all the time, he made our stay a bit more special and memorable.",4,2019,03,28

The hotel staff is friendly and always looking for help the residents. I strongly recommend to try the hotel and enjoy its facilities.",5,2019,03,25
42,JUST A PERFECT STAY !,"Everything in this hotel is just  perfect , so convenient, warm feelings and clean ! The food in LINIA is very Delicious, don't miss the chance to eat there ! I ate the same steak with goose liver for 3 nights , because it was just exactly the taste I like ! My kid ate the same fish dish for 4 nights, she even didnt want to change for other dishes !

42,Luxurious boutique hotel in Barcelona,"We loved this precious hotel for its location, design and staff. 
If you are willing to pay the extra money book one of the awesome suites on the 7th floor.
The interior design and the private terrace are quite spectacular.   
Also, we highly recommend the rooftop bar where you can meet friends and family. ",5,2019,03,20
42,Top Notch Hotel in Perfect Location,"We spent a few nights in this luxury property, which was perfectly located in an upscale part of the city. It is a short walk to las ramblas, gothic quarter, shopping, and only a 15-20 walk to sagrada familia, so essentially perfect for almost all tourist activities. The staff was courteous, helpful, and provided advice and suggestions. Check in was simple, we got an almanac room. Interiors are well designed, trendy, modern, with plenty of space. The electronic controls for all aspects of the room were easy to use. Refreshments and water were provided free of charge daily. The windows and door to the balcony were well insulated, no noise from the outside traffic. You can however, feel a tiny rumble of the metro running below ground. The only downside to the room was that the bathroom showed wear and tear, not as pristine or well maintained as one might expect. The TV also turned itself on for no reason one night.  Other than this, great hotel and perfect location for a Barcelona trip.",5,2019,03,14
42,"Amazing Hotel, service needs improvement!","This is for sure top 5 most beautiful hotels I ve been to. Rooms are very comfortable, the food at the restaurant is amazing, the roof top is very beautiful and nice, great view. The only issue was the service, a lot of young people working, although helpful, they sure need better training. Order a spanish tortilla for breakfast, the waiter forgot to order, so i asked again and he brought an omelete, I said I had ordered the tortilla and he said the pot was broken... Anyway, I hope they improve the service, because the hotel is a great place to be. Lots of employees were very helpful, they just seem a little unprepared sometimes.",4,2019,03,14
42,Upscale Updated Hotel,"We stayed at Almanac for our honeymoon for 4 nights and had such an amazing experience. Everything in this hotel is top notch from the staff, to the panoramic lounge, rooms and restaurant. We were greeted each time we enetered the hotel and the staff were very happy to help with anything we needed. The girls at breakfast were amazing and even remembered our coffee order and room number each day! The rooms are renovated and very comfortable. I can’t say enough good things about this hotel. This was one of several stops on our honeymoon trip and really the only hotel that didn’t do anything extra/ special for us. They should definitely look into having romantic package options etc. Otherwise everything was perfection!",5,2019,03,06
42,great hotel downtown,Great downtown hotel an excellent clean and spacious room the staff very friendly and polite nothing to complain excellent I have no words to describe everything perfect el hotel está en un lugar para visitar Barcelona,5,2019,03,03
42,Great Barcelona city center hotel with flawless service,"The Almanac Barcelona is an outstanding hotel with a very modern feel and look, but with a touch of relaxed luxury and appeal. Where it stands high above other hotels is in the quality of its care to its guests; the staff are friendly but professional and provide outstanding service. We were there at the end of January to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and the whole staff did everything they could to make it a memorable event for us. The rooms are modern but very comfortable. The view of the city by night from our room was amazing. The Ramblas is a ten minute stroll from the hotel and taxis and buses can get you across the town to any location very quickly if you don’t want to walk. The Linia Mediterrainean Brasserie and Bar on the ground floor serves excellent food and wonderful cava, and the Azimuth Rooftop Terrace and Lounge provides more outstanding views of the city. You would have to go a long way to better a stay in this hotel.",5,2019,02,26
42,Superb ,"First time to Barcelona, this hotel is superb, compared with mandarin, the staff is well trained and helpful.  The room is stylish although is unexpected small, but everything in-room is excellent.  We reserved a junior suite for 4 nites as our last destination of Spain. Located at the center of Barcelona, a true gem of Barcelona.",5,2019,02,22
42,"Superb 5 star Hotel, fabulous roof terrace with pool, personlised service provided by great staff always smilling....","I had the opportunity to stay for the Week End early February in this superb hotel. great staff participating in making us feel very special. Rooms are amazing, very modern (all features with digital commands) with a terrace (view on the Sagrada familia) and a double shower with transparent glass overlooking the outside (if you want). I really appreciate the attention to details and the willing from all staff to please us.
Special thanks to night staff and their Rhum suggestion and service...
I recommend the Roof terrace bar really nice and cosy.
Hope to be able to come back soon in Spring to enjoy the Pool on the roof.",5,2019,02,19
42,Honeymoon,"Hotel Almanac is a very classy 5 star hotel. We were welcomed by accommodating staff with drinks and munchies. We were also given a stub to avail our free welcome drinks from the roof top bar. The room is spacious and has nice room designs. The room lights, curtains and air temperature can be controlled through a smart phone and tablet. You can also choose to order food through their smart phone and can view all other services of the hotel. The bathroom has a unique his and hers sink and offers a generous bottle of bath liquids good for a week! (unlike the small bottles of other hotels that can only be for 1 use) Plus, the scent is very refreshing. The toilet has its own cubicle and is separate from the shower area. They have bidet! Hooray! And the coolest part is that the temperature and angle of the water can be controlled using a remote. All the refreshments inside the refrigerator is free (sodas and water). They also have coffee and tea maker-cool cool cool! During our second day, they surprised us with strawberry coated chocolates on a plate with the greeting “Happy Honeymoon” paired with Rose wine. The staff gives warm smiles everytime we go in and out of the hotel. They are always ready to help. The hotel is situated in the main city surrounded by known shopping stores like Zara, H&M, Mango and other branded stores like Gucci, Chanel, etc. Literally walking distance!  There is a supermarket near the hotel and  A LOT OF good restaurants, tapas etc. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. We had a great time in Barcelona!",5,2019,02,13

42,"Excellent hotel, great staff","The Almanac Barcelona is an excellent hotel. The hotel is very new, with a modern and stylish design. The restaurant and rooftop bar are both great - very nice view from the roof. The room was really nice, I had the junior suite - big windows, tons of light and really luxurious marble bathroom. Also really high-tech. The curtains, lights and dimming are all controlled through an electronic pad. The room comes with a cell phone (instead of standard plug in wall phone) and a tablet on which you can order food / room service. The staff is also fantastic - went on my birthday weekend and they offered a free breakfast and were super attentive with cleaning the room and making it fresh. We missed the dinner time scheduled and they helped us find and book a whole new restaurant, Lomo Alto which is a high end steakhouse and then also helped suggest great nightlife to try afterwards. Lastly they were even great with booking a car to the airport as we were running late. Thanks very much to Pol, Clelia, Enrique, Houssein, Ilaria, Sameer and Sandra!",5,2019,01,27
42,Nice suprise,"The hotel is very modern and quality of material used was good and not cheap. Roomsize is good not to small. Just right for single person or couple.

It is extraordinary on every level,  from the tiny details to the main things.Once you step up out of taxi you are in a safe hands , professional front desk , best room service , they are taking care of every single thing you could ask . Just name it and they will do it for you , it is like you are the only person in the hotel .Francisco,  Diego, elyas and the whole almanac hotel team , THANK YOU VERY MUCH",5,2019,01,14

42,Positively without a doubt the worst hotel so far.,"As I walked into the hotel room, i noticed that everhthing was electronic which may seem cool and as a good thing but, as I was to order room service, they do not bring everything you order. During my stay here I had to wait 1.5 hours to receive my room service, been charged 600 euros without my consent, shower was dirty and they do not change the bedsheets everyday which for not only 5* hotel but for any hotel of the sort is highly unnaceptable. To top it all, there are no windows in suites. This stay was a big fail, I will not be returning to this hotel as the service and staff was very low and they were very rude.",1,2019,01,07
42,Excellent hotel,Great locationGreat staffDon't miss out on this place. From booking online to check out. The hotel staff were very attentive. Gave great recommendations to eat and visit. A very enjoyable stay at the hotel  ,5,2019,01,02
42,Relaxing Vacation at the Almanac,"The rooms were clean and comfortable; the food was pleasantly delicious; the service (namely Pedro, Marta, and Danny) friendly and excellent--we got great tips on what not to miss in Barcelona (museums, neighborhoods, and even restaurants)",5,2019,01,02
42,Not what I was expecting somewhat disappointed,"We checked in to the hotel today. I booked this hotel for two reasons: It had almost a perfect rating and it had a free mini bar!   Mini bar is a lure that will let you down, if you are used to luxury hotels with complimentary mini bars..  I have stayed at many hotel that have these but this one only has free water and coke. There is no other drinks or snacks in the room,  If you feel like a late night splurge you will have to call room service.
The room was very clean and modern but small, Beds comfy, lines high quality. extremely small bathroom
I also was disappointed that the Room does not have a dressing mirror only a full length mirror in the bathroom that is the very very small.
There is a great sauna and steam downstairs.
But all in all for around 800 usd per night it is not a good value.
The rooms are very small and if you have a family be prepared to pay 100 euro per person extra",3,2018,12,30
42,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is the best in Barcelona. My partner and I travel often, and have stayed in amazing hotels all over the world. This hotel is one of the best properties we have ever had the opportunity to stay in. The staff is so friendly and ON IT. Extremely kind and attentive. The actual hotel and rooms are beautiful - exceptionally clean and current. The technology in the rooms is easy to maneuver and was completely reliable for us. Highly recommend having a drink on the rooftop as well, we enjoyed amazing cocktails there.",5,2018,12,28

42,Morden hotel disgraceful service ,"We are coming to Barcelona for a friends reunion after 3 years. I planed this trip with Amex long time ahead. Upon arrival, the check in process is slow with all sorts of mess ups. When we get to the room, the room is freezing cold. We turned on the AC to maximum heat and left for dinner, when we get back, the room is even colder. We called the front desk about the problem, different people come to us at different time, they were two staff come to our room try to figure out the problem after we’ve been informed we need to change room. Such a messy miscommunication. By the time, is already approaching midnight. It took them 1.5 hours to move us to a different room and we literally need to pack ourselves. On that night, they rent out space for private party, we waited like 15mins in our PJs for a elevator. The night shift manager Jose was with us and doing nothing....embarrassing service and hotel. 
By the time we going to bed is already 1:30am, then another issues, due to the party at roof top. They made so much noise and we couldn’t sleep. We have to call reception and they didn’t really do any changes. The cheering and singing shouting is still loud. And the reception was rudely replied me that he can resolve the problem asap. At the end, I just give up contacting them. 
On the night, I asked that I need to talk to the hotel GM the second morning. However, no one came to us, no apologies at all. I just gave up on their disgraceful service at the end. The messed up on breakfast orders just seemed soooooo minor to its service. 
The house keeping was disaster too, dirty mugs were not been replaced and clothes wrongly messed folded. Sigh
Wouldn’t recommend to this hotel to anyone! Seriously! You don’t want this rubbish service ruining ur trip!!

42,Top Barça Hôtel !,We had a fantastic time and we were amaized by the hotel and service offered ! Outstanding room. Full service for family trip. Charming service at the checkin and checkout with flexibility for changes ,5,2018,12,15
42,"Nice hotel, terrible service","Hotel is great but let down by disgraceful service. The staff managed to put our suitcases in someone else’s taxi - totally unacceptable even in a 1 star hotel, let alone a 5 star hotel. They weren’t particularly apologetic and offered us a free coffee. Wasted over an hour of our time whilst waiting for the bags to be returned, which fortunately they were. Will never stay at an Almanac hotel again. Don’t let these cowboys anywhere near your luggage!",1,2018,12,15
42,Wow!!!!,"Amazing staff, amazing service, caring, professional and super helpful.
Almanac is a beautiful gem in Barcelona, luxurious hotel with beautiful rooms in every way that you can imagine and the highlight is not only location but their staff. I don’t know how they do it but they care, so much!!!!! 
Rarely I get the chance to stay at a hotel that I don’t have even one thing to complain about. Almanac is it!
If you are looking for the best hotel in Barcelona, with luxurious service, rooms, amenities and breakfast, this is the place for you. I wish I have known the names of all the great people who gave us amazing service here. I do remember Jose, thank you so much for everything!",5,2018,12,12

42,LOOP ART FAIR,My stay for 2 nights was to participate ate the LOOP FAIR. very good fair. the Hotel is fantastic except the very bad organisation for Breakfast. 25 mn to have a hot tea. a lot of clients were angry. food is here and there. bread was missing. plates and bowls were missing. the offer is average for such a Hotel. just a few breads. corn flakes ?. just a few cheese. eggs not available you have to ask the service. and honestly during breakfast we need to concentrate and be fast. so everything was great EXCEPT the BREAKFAST experience . same for the coffee after lunch experience . the bar is just badly organised and so slow  !,4,2018,11,23
42,An Excellent Hotel with Terrific Staff,"Very new hotel - absolutely every amenity that you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  Staff was exception in helping with any issue - helping us book flights to the interior, to restaurant choices, and interesting sites among other things.

42,Outstanding hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"The team at Almanac were superb from the moment they greeted us from our taxi to the moment they put us back in our taxi for our journey home. The hotel oozes class and style and  the staff are friendly, attentive and full of happiness on every corner of the hotel you see them. The amenities in the room are innovative and forward thinking which is a nice perk to have. The hotel was so clean and well kept, our rooms were made up twice a day and to the highest of standards. The breakfast was a pleasurable experience with a great selection of hot and cold food and staff who are constantly waiting on you and checking if they can offer any further help - great service. The whole place was fantastic and the team at Almanac were just superb - great team in this lovely gem of a hotel. The hotel is situated just near enough to all the hustle and bustle yet far enough away to walk away from it . Thank you to everyone who looked after the Hobbs family - we will be back and we might take the advice from your staff who told us about St George's day in Barcelona in April.",5,2018,11,20
42,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff!,"I loved my stay here. My bed was super comfortable and my room was gorgeous. This hotel is in a great location - a 10 minute walk to la ramblas,close to the shopping area, around the corner from Gaudi’s Casa Batllo and has El Nacional right behind it for food so as a tourist you can eat anytime. 
The hotel is new and in great condition and the restaurant food is great. The roof top pool and bar area are great for relaxing too. 
The very best thing about this hotel however is the staff. They are superb! Every single person I dealt with was helpful and friendly and went the extra mile. I have been travelling for a month and they are the best team I have come across.",5,2018,11,19

42,Best Hotel to stay in Barcelona,"After reading many previous reviews we decided to stay at the Almanac, predominently because of the high ratings of the food and service ratings. This was our first trip to Barcelona and Spain, and the staff at the Almanac left us with a strong impression of the Catalan commitment to hospitality and care. While other hotels have similar amenities and pricing, our next trip will be back at the Almanac. ",5,2018,11,18
42,"Stylish, friendly , best hotel In barca ","Simply for anyone who likes a hotel that is super stylish but not arrogant with it then this is perfect .

42,Cutting-edge design plus dedicated staff,"The Almanac provides a consistently excellent experience.  Location is superb, right in the heart of Barcelona.  The hotel is lovely -- very new and modern with every creature comfort one could imagine.  Rooms are very high-tech but spacious and quite comfortable.  Amenities are of uniformly high quality.  We very much appreciated the double sink and Japanese-style toilet.  I generally liked the tech for lights and curtains, etc. though I wish I could have figured out how to keep on just one light at a time.  

Public spaces and restaurant are lovely.  Nice small touches like flavored water and little snacks in the lobby were emblematic of their entire approach. 

Most of all, the people who were work there are incredibly service-oriented.  Everyone we dealt with was supremely courteous, kind, and helpful.  They are clearly very proud of their hotel and city and are happy to share them.  I recommend the Almanac highly.  It is also a very good value.",5,2018,11,10

42,Beautiful Modern Hotel with luxury bed and friendly staff,"We spent 2 nights at the Almanac and enjoyed it very much.  Good location for easy walking to many sites. It opened in the Fall of 2017.  We usually stay at Four Seasons hotels and this hotel met our expectations.  The staff was very friendly and bent over backwards to accommodate our every need.  The pool is a shallow, unheated, small dipping pool but the rooftop deck is still delightful to relax before and after tours.  And the rooftop bar is a special place to enjoy a cocktail.  The breakfast in the morning has everything you would want or need. The bed linens are excellent as is the bed and pillows.  The bathroom has every amenity of a 5 star hotel.",5,2018,10,31

From the very welcome on arrival by Jose, the team in the Linea restaurant and in the rooftop bar, service was faultless. Room was beautiful and immaculately clean with  a turn down service.Breakfast was first class with a great choice. Complimentary drinks from mini bar was another nice touch. Location is fantastic within walking distance of most tourist attractions. Deserves its 5 stars and very happy to recommend",5,2018,10,30
42,Really fantastic hotel,Beautiful rooms very comfortable beds staff all so smiling and helpful a gorgeous stay highly recommend this hotel if we come back to Barcelona this would be our top choice . Only thing is for summer the pool is really very small indeed and so if you want swimming go for a hotel near the beach otherwise stay here for a great city experience !,5,2018,10,30
42,Beautiful Hotel,"We booked this hotel for 2 nights with the request of early check-in. we arrived early as planned, the location of the hotel is wonderful. The staff was very friendly. Our room was not ready, we were asked to leave our luggage and they would contact us when the room was ready. We left sightseeing and returned 4 hours later and unfortunately they still did not have a room. By then we were exhausted and ready to cancel the reservation. The manager apologized and eventually did find us a room and gave us in upgrade. The hotel is apparently new, so it was spotless and very modern. Everything in the room ran on technology, which was really interesting. The room was very spacious and beautiful. The rooftop bar and pool area was great and relaxing. The view was really nice. 
As for the staff, they are absolutely wonderful and very helpful. We definitely will go back to this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona and I would recomment this hotel.

42,Amazing hotel and amazing staff,"We celebrated our first wedding anniversary at almanac hotel and it was our first time in Barcelona and we couldn’t have asked for anything better! The hotel is centrally located we walked almost everywhere, the best way to see a new city. The staff and concierge particularly Ricardo and his team were so helpful organised our tickets gave us amazing recommendations for dinner organised reservations and also booked us a flamenco show, without their help it would have been very difficult and time consuming process. Our room was lovely spacious and clean. Would highly recommend this place, 5 star hotel from every angle!! ",5,2018,10,24

42,Superb hotel in an excellent location,"We booked this hotel for 3 nights. It was our first visit to Barcelona. Although We did some researches before arriving there but I have to say that the location of the hotel is superb. Very close to plaza de Catalonia  but on a quiet less noisy street. Steps from the main shopping street.
The hotel is spotless. In addition, we loved the high technology of everything in the room.
As for the staff, they are absolutely wonderful. All of them were very helpful and recommended many good places and restaurants. 
We definitely will go back to this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona",5,2018,10,15
42,Favourite in Barcelona with beautiful rooftop,"I chose to stay at Almanac both times I was in Barcelona during the last couple of months. It is beautifully designed and has very comfortable beds. All staff are exceptionally friendly. And I can highly recommend to drink one of the delicious cocktails on the roof top, mixed by lovely Nico! I will be back!",5,2018,10,15
42,Amazing hotel. Outstanding service,"This was my 11th time in Barcelona in the past few years. I usually take my wife to the W but decided to stay a little closer to town and found this place from outstanding reviews. 

From the moment we arrived till the movement we left this place was amazing. The staff were so helpful they couldn’t do enough from the made bringing an ironing board to me to the bar staff helping us choose the best Gin for me. 

The place is modern and clean and has great technology. Free phone calls and iPads in the rooms. Lovely sauna and steam room complimentary and small fitness room. This place is five stars all the way and will be seeing my custom again in the near future and if you are looking for an amazing place to stay in Barcelona. You should go here too. ",5,2018,10,14
42,Amazing staff and great location!,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay at Almanac. This is in a great location - very central to nearly everything we wanted to do. However, the staff at Alamanac is what made this stay truly wonderful.

Clelia is an absolute star - she was remarkably helpful, very nice, and extremely competent. We showed up in Barcelona with little direction and she helped us plan and manage everything. Give this woman a promotion!!! 

Andreas is also fantastic and quite helpful (he gifted me a tie!!!), and we genuinely enjoyed seeing and talking with them both each day. 

Overall, we loved Alamanac and will absolutely return.",5,2018,10,13
42,We will be very sorry to leave.,"We chose Almanac based upon a review by Ben Holbrook, the excellent Barcelona-based travel writer. It was an excellent recommendation. It is a wonderfully stylish hotel, but also has excellent staff and a clear service excellence culture. Our room was beautiful, with stunning decor, a very comfortable bed and sublime bathroom. Front of house were terrific - Young, keen, and eager to be helpful. I would single out Hortense and Francisco as outstanding.
We don't tend to use hotel restaurants, particularly given the abundance of brilliant restaurants in Barcelona, but we used Linia on our last evening, and it was wonderful. it was also extremely good value - a six course prix fixe menu at 39 euros was exceptional. There were nice touches like water and coffee included. There were also nice touches in the room minibar, where beer, soft drinks, nuts and confectionery were complimentary.
We are very sorry to be leaving in the morning. Also, it is probably the best hotel location in Barcelona. Whoops! I forgot to mention the roof terrace bar, which s very special.
This hotel group really understand what the perfect hotel should be like. Very highly recommended.",5,2018,10,12
42,City break ,"
Breakfast was always served very nicely in the mornings. Rooms were spacious and kept clean daily. Staff were very friendly in the lobby. The roof top bar was gorgeous!! Sweet little pool. Shame there aren’t more than a few loungers. 
Airport pick up wasn’t the smoothest after being delayed I did communicate with the hotel about the new eta but they assured us not to worry and that they will check all the times and make sure the driver would be there for our arrival but eventually after searching for the driver for over half an hour the driver then told us he waited for us for 3 hours and then went back to the hotel and then we arrived although I had told the hotel we wouldn’t be there on time?..... I personally next time would just grab a taxi downstairs- a lot easier and cheaper. 
In all honesty the hotel was overpriced for what it offered, it was our first wedding anniversary and my husband asked to see if they could do anything special (which he would have gladly paid for) but nothing unfortunately was to offer.
Great location though and taxis easy to grab. A great tapas recommended by the helpful guys at reception is definitely a must too!! ",4,2018,10,09
42,"Great Staff, Great Location","Weary from a flight from the US, we arrived well before check-in and the wonderful staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  From the welcome beverage and sweet delivered to us while we checked in,  to the super fast clean up and early access to the room we would occupy for the next 2 days, to the suggestions of what to do and where to eat, the staff at the Almanac is on top of everything.  Our room was well outfitted for us, with cold beverages in the complimentary mini bar (so nice to have) and a toilet separate from the sleeping area down a small but welcomed hallway.  The upstairs bar is a very nice place for late night beverages and views - we finished our nights there.  Our only issues were that the pocket door to the bathroom was stuck when we first arrived, but *fixed* by a staff member at our request and that the tablet for the room must have been cracked by a previous guest.  Our other complaint is that our 2nd floor room must have backed onto the elevator shaft and just before waking the woosh of the elevator resonated in the room for me a very light sleeper.   Located in an easy to get anywhere in Barcelona neighborhood with lots of local food options.  I'd stay again!",4,2018,10,09
42,Great Hotel,"The hotel facilities are good.  the GYM is small one but do the job for a couple of days
The room was super clean, but the drainage smell was everywhere 
They tried to fix it but i think HVAC system was having some issue
The staff was super nice especially Fransisco, He was very helpful 
The hotel also offer you a phone to cary on with you all the time and it was free of charge, even international phone calls 
I will come back soon ",4,2018,10,09
42,Loved this hotel- Superb property and beyond superb service!,"We stayed here recently for 5 days and have never had better service than what we received at Almanac Barcelona. 
The rooms were clean and modern. The location is perfect and close to everything. It is not overly crowded but is 2 minutes walk away from amazing restaurants and shopping. 

The staff is superb. Every single staff member that we interacted with during our stay was courteous and friendly. They always had a smile on their face and were proactive about helping guests. 

Sameer, Ricard are just a couple of staff members that provided us help with planning our days and getting information regarding good restaurants around. 

I would recommend this property to everyone.",5,2018,10,06
42,One of the best hotels ever!!! Great stay. Friendly staff,"I specifically joined TripAdvisor to write this review. This was probably the best stay i have ever had in any hotel. What stood out to us was the service was so good; Every staff had smile on their face at all times and took time to listen to our needs.From the minute we arrived the staff couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful. They went out of their way to give you a fantastic experience. Our bell host Sameer was so attentive and attention to detail was what stood to us.  They would follow up with us every day to ensure our stay is going good. 

Location is great and very central. Rooms are very clean and modern with marble furnishing in the washroom. The food in the dining room at dinner, excellent as well. Highly recommended!!! Probably the best hotel i ever stayed in.",5,2018,10,05
42,Simply Superb!,"A gem in the nicest area of Barcelona. 

The rooms are well presented with all kinds of mod-cons. The staff are helpful and friendly. 

Their restaurant was fabulous for dinner. 

Really convenient to walk to all the streets with shopping. 

I’d say this hotel was much better in terms of location and quality than the Hilton we stayed at previously on the seafront. 

Extremely well managed establishment. ",5,2018,10,05
42,Excellent location; new property; friendly service,"LOCATION Located right at the heart of the city but yet quiet on a tree lined street - this is an ideal location for a Barcelona visit.

CHECKIN process was smooth.  Staff is fluent in English and very friendly and welcoming.

ROOM LAYOUT is well thought out.  Our room - Gran Via Cube King - was on the 5th floor close to the elevator (yet very quiet) and facing the tree lined street with an alcove seating at the window (this was the highlight of the room).  Room had state of the art controls monitored through a tablet; everything in the minibar was included gratis; Nespresso coffee machine in the room was a nice perk; and the hotel provided a samsung phone for local use!  The bathroom had a nice size shower area with rainshower; separate toilet; double sink and plenty of storage space and nice toiletries.

SERVICE was very friendly.  My only suggestion for improvement for the Concierge desk to familiarize themselves with less touristy places - shows, restaurants and bars - for well travelled people who are looking for something different and off the beaten path.  
",5,2018,09,23
42,Wonderfully amazing and fabulous in every way ,"From the moment of arrival to the so sad departure some 3 days later, we were completely pampered and spoilt in every way possible. 
The furnishings are of the highest standard, the bed and pillows where so yummy comfortable and the staff.........simply amazing and attentive to every need of the weary traveler. Congratulations team Almanac, stunning, we will defo be back. 
The first choice hotel in Barcelona!! ",5,2018,09,23
42,Not great so far.,"Only checked in this afternoon but so far feeling underwhelmed. 

We arrived an hour early so couldn’t go to our room as it hadn’t been made up yet - not a problem.

What is a little more annoying is that when we did go to the room there were additional, partially consumed items in the fridge / minibar; missing items from the bathroom and the last resident hadn’t had his telephone calls wiped from the phone. Data protection might not be a big issue in the UEA (where the majority of the calls were made to) but since May 25th I would expect a 5* hotel to be a bit more ‘on it’.

On the plus side, the shower’s good.
",2,2018,09,22
42,Trip to Spain ,"Almanac is amazing. Service - second to none. Will see you and your luggage from cab to hotel. Staff extremely friendly made amazing recommendations and bookings for restaurants, gave helpful  directions for sight seeing. Always someone to greet you to and from your taxi opening doors. The rooms are just as wonderful. All the amenities needed with smart technology controlling lighting, windows and more. Definitely coming back again for next trip. Thank you to almanac and it’s friendly professional staff. ",5,2018,09,18
42,Couldn't Have Been Better,"If you can, stay here. Everyone who works in this hotel has been trained to make your experience perfect. The hotel is beautiful, new, clean and I will stay in more Almanac's next time I travel.  The food in the dining room at dinner, excellent as well. 
We went to Madrid after five nights in Barcelona and truly missed the staff and the accomodations, though we stayed in a lovely hotel in Madrid, it didn't have all the electronic bells and whistles that spoiled us at the Almanac.  We had a room with a cube and a chaise that overlooked the city. Just the right size for us. The coffee in the room every morning got me going and as I don't drink soda (coke) or beer, the only thing I should have done was asked them to substitute sparkling water for the cokes  and lemon soda . I am certain they would have done so. Stay at the Almanac !!!!",5,2018,09,10
42,Amazing ,"Such wonderful staff. The hotel is so beautiful. Attention to detail is amazing, so well built. Great location to shopping. Starbucks is just a block away.  Rooftop is perfect for drinks. Can’t say enough good things.  ",5,2018,09,09
42,Very nice stay,Great hotel. Location is great in a nice part of the city. Staff is very nice and helpful. We booked a junior suit and they upgraded us to a suit with a terrace. Definitely recommend to stay there. We had no complaints.,5,2018,09,09
42,Wonderful Hotel,"We recently stayed at The Almanac Hôtel, Barcelona on an extended tour of Spain. We had been on an Iberian Cruise with a golfing emphasis.

We arrived very early in the day and the hotel staff were most accommodating and suggested that they would try to arrange for our room to be available earlier than scheduled. They delivered!

The hotel is extremely well located and a new build, hence the rooms are very modern, unbelievably quiet and spacious. The bed was one of the best hotel beds we have slept on - probably because the hotel is so new.

The night light system is the most advanced we have ever experienced, as the choice of either complete darkness or too much light can make sleeping difficult.

Whilst the hotel food is excellent, we wanted to experience a more Spanish theme. The concierge gave us two outside recommendations and the one we chose was great, and might I add, incredible value. Uncertain of the time to walk and as it had started raining, we jumped a cab and after dinner walked back.

The staff were exceptionally helpful across the board, from room attendants, front desk and all lobby staff.

We will certainly return.",5,2018,09,09
42,From the first moment....WOW!!,"When you’re greeted outside from a bellman to the final goodbye at the front desk, you’re struck by the friendliness of the staff here. Not stuffy or over effusive, just nice and they truly care about every part of the stay.

The hotel is a gem, beautiful and modern with classic touches everywhere. The rooms are quiet and elegant (we were 50 ft from a very busy street and never heard it) with one of the greatest showers ever. Big fluffy towels and a fantastic bed. 

We included breakfast and we were right to do it, the food is amazing. Great buffet. 

Up top at the pool and lounge. Edwardo, Nicolas and Alexandria took such great care of us. Fun place to either start or end a night. Good tapas and wine list for me. 

Now, it wasn’t all perfect.... but the imperfections were outweighed by the staff the their need to make our stay perfect. And it was.... off to Majorca. I hope the hotel matches the Almanac. ",5,2018,09,07
42,Phenominal Hotel,"We arrived in the Almanac Hotel on Friday for my husband's 40th birthday.  I was nervous as I booked it as a surprise and I did not know any hotels in Barcelona.  I aced it with booking the Almanac.  Everyone who works their is focused on best service - always asking if you are enjoying your stay.  The hotel itself is stunning - very funky décor.  We stayed in a corner suite and they upgraded us to a terrace suite - it was magnificent.  The breakfast was delicious, every type of egg you could think of and beautifully presented.  The roof top bar was fabulous.  There was a DJ there both Friday and Saturday night and again the bar staff were so friendly and helpful. Everyone who worked there were exceptional - it was almost as if they owned the hotel they were so interested in the guests.  The location of the hotel was amazing, near the shops and also near El National which is well worth a trip.  I am definitely returning to the Almanac - I loved everything about it and it made our trip so memorable.",5,2018,09,03
42,AMAZING!!! ,"If I could give additional stars I would. Not only is this hotel beautiful, but the service is phenomenal! Walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and sites. Great rooftop with amazing views. 

I’d recommend staying here if you’re planning on visiting Barcelona. I will definitely be back.  ",5,2018,09,01
42,"Exceptional service, great location ","Summary: José is the best. Stay at the Almanac if you can. 

I’ve had the pleasure of staying at 5 star hotels in 50+ cities around the world so It was a wonderful surprise to be so impressed with the Almanac. The service was exceptional from the first moment.

1) we arrived at 9am and room was not ready (check in is at 3). Manager José jumped into action and provided us an option to upgrade to a junior suite that was available immediately (modest upgrade fee, significantly lower than normal junior suite rate). 

2) entire staff was friendly and helpful 

3) rooms are brand new and tech savvy (they even give you a cell phone you can take around town!)

4) rooftop is great 

5) location is great 

There are a few excellent 5 star options in great areas in Barcelona. For me, Almanac is currently the one to beat. ",5,2018,08,28
42,Top flight,"We stayed here for four nights following two weeks in Morocco. This place is really impressive. Modern, attractive, well located. The staff was friendly and consistently helpful. It may not be the place if you are looking for something older and more reflective of the architecture and history of the city. It has an attractive rooftop bar, we did not eat in the restaurant with so many other options nearby. Would not hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2018,08,24
42,CHIC,"Very cozy and truly chic! any problem is solved quickly and delicate! I wish the pool surroundings was bigger, so it could fit everyone and not only 4 people, but anyway - best hotel in Barca!) Don skip the breakfast as you will enjoy a truly restaraunt service. Big pleasant surprise -  free minibar!",5,2018,08,23
42,Excellent!!!,"I’m working in a B2B, wholesale travel agency and I’m checking hotels frequently. Also I’m a frequent traveler. 
I saw many around the world and I was very satisfied with hotel Almanac! 
The staff is really professional and very helpful! 
The rooms are beautiful and clean. 
I was very happy that we could use the whole minibar for free.
Excellent location, lovely rooftop terrace, good breakfast...
Only one thing I missed: some vegetables - salad from the breakfast! 
Aha!! If breakfast: the breakfast staff is the best very nice all! 
Thank you! ",5,2018,08,22
42,Great hotel,"The location of the hotel is fantastic. It is within walking distance to most tourist attractions. It is a short block away from all the shopping.  The staff is very helpful and attentive.  Breakfast buffet is great. The rooms are on the smaller size.  Would recommend getting the junior suite or higher category. But, the rooms are very clean.  Highly recommend it.",5,2018,08,20
42,One of the best hotel I ever been,"An elegant, luxurious hotel, the rooms are decorated in a high standard. Excellent staff. I will definitely return to the hotel on my next visit. Must when visiting Barcelona. Don’t forget to visit the restaurant and top roof bar",5,2018,08,19
42,Beautifully appointed hotel with great location ,"We stayed here for 3 nights in a grand cube twin which was very cute. 
The rooms are new, everything works beautifully, the shower gel etc smells divine and staff are very helpful and forthcoming. The beds are excellent. 
Although our room faced the street (4th floor), you could barely hear the sounds. 
Breakfast is fine. You order your egg dishes, breads, cheese, ham and fruits are buffet-style. There is Müsli but no lin or chia seeds. 
Pool is only „wading“, i. E. Nice to look at but not for swimming. 4 sun beds. Towels are provided. 
Location is fab as the airport bus stop is a 5 min. walk, so are the hop on/off buses and the metro. 
Casa Mila and Battló are a 10 min. walk away. 
Shops are close-by. 
",5,2018,08,15
42,Stunning hotel,"My partner and I stayed here over NYE and we both could not stop singing praises for the hotel and staff. We had a few small issues during heck-in and with some room service, but this was swiftly made right. The hotel itself is stunning and the rooms are spectacular. The swimming pool is more decorative but still a great extra. 
We decided to stay in the hotel for dinner, which we are both usual sceptical about as are not fans of most hotel restaurants. However, the food was so mouth wateringly delicious I wanted to take the chef home. The tasting menu is a must and the wine is equally yummy. 
Thank you Almanac for such a memorable holiday.",5,2018,08,14
42,Magical Almanac,A gem of a hotel in Barcelona! First time in Barcelona and definitely won’t be my last.  We are so happy we found Hotel Almanac. The room was fantastically comfortable. The hotel staff is amazing!  The rooftop bar and pool are perfect. We flew in from the states and they made every effort to accommodate us with 3 hour early checkin.  Thank you Hotel Almanac for making our first trip to Barcelona so fantastic! ,5,2018,08,11
42,Friendliest Team!,"Everything was great! But I think what truly made it special, was the attention of the staff. There was not a single person who wasn’t smiling or helping. From the reception to the rooftop pool/bar. With two young kids (2 & 4) there’s no guarantee of how things are going to go, but everyone was so ridiculously nice and helpful it couldn’t have gone any better. The location of the place is also perfect, bang in the middle of Gran Via, we managed to walk pretty much everywhere from there. If/when we do go back to Barcelona, we’ll definitely come back!",5,2018,08,11
42,A hidden gem! ,"This hotel is the coolest looking place for interior and style. The rooms are amazing and delightfully high tec. Fantastic rooftop with pool and bar, and the view is pure magic. Get a drink up there at night and enjoy it. From the moment you enter, the staff looks after you. And they are just so nice, every single one. The restaurant there is something else. We had the most incredible dinner celebrating our anniversary. Wine pairing was perfect, dinner was fantastic. We recommend staying here 100%. At least, have dinner there! ",5,2018,08,06
42,Amazing hotel in an amazing location.,"This hotel is by far the best I have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world. The rooms are “smart”, and everything is controlled by a tablet pad, and the mini bar is complementary (yep - FREE!). The hotel is walking distance from some amazing attractions, and right across the road from the metro (which was a life-saver as we were there during the taxi strikes!). The staff are wonderful and helpful. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more highly to anyone!",5,2018,08,06
42,Wonderful experience,"This hotel is like none other. The staff are helpful, the rooms are beautiful and very clean and the breakfast is excellent. The hotel is high tech and a lovely boutique hotel. The beds are comfortable and honestly I was sad to leave. This is a MUST stay hotel and I’d give them 10 stars if I could. They even let us check in at 9am.

To the hotel thank you so much! It was truly lovely.

42,Ultra Modern Hotel in heart of City,"The Almanac Barcelona is a very nice, well appointed modern hotel offering all the amenities, including a rooftop pool.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city.",4,2018,08,04
42,Delightful!,"Stayed here for 2 nights for special birthday! My husband and I had the most amazing time, Barcelona was fabulous, as was the Almanac... 5 star all the way.

42,Excellent location & hotel,"We were very happy with our 4 night stay at Almanac and would not hesitate to stay again. It's in a brilliant location close to shops & restaurants. We stayed in the basic room and it was plenty big enough. Bed was excellent. The shower had excellent pressure and was large and the soaps ect were really lovely. Included in the price was the mini bar which included chips, peanuts, soft drinks, waters, juices and 2 beers and this was replenished daily. The staff were brilliant and very friendly, always offering to assist in any way possible. We were also given a welcome drink to use in the bar upstairs. We found the breakfast good although sometimes slow in service. We would highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2018,07,30
42,A gorgeous hotel in a superb location ,"Stayed here for five nights and booked two rooms, one with gran vie view and the other with a different view connected through a private doorway (ie there is a main door which opens up to two separate bedrooms). We have enjoyed it very much. A beautiful hotel with gorgeous rooms, very clean, wonderful staff, situated in a superb location and top it all it has a beautiful roof top bar and wading pool (though small) which is perfect to have cocktails and drinks watching the sun sets (or any other time !). Breakfast is absolutely stunning and international calls and mini bar are free ! ",5,2018,07,29
42,Best hotel in Barcelona!,"My friend and I stayed at the Almanac for a long weekend, and we could not have made a better choice! It is by far the best service I have experience in any hotel! In particular Elias and Danny we're absolutely lovely and could not have been more helpful! The location was great, our room was incredible, especially all of the new technology! We loved the rooftop terrace, it was a perfect place to relax in the day and have cocktails in the evening! We would definitely recommend the Almanac to anyone and will be sure to visit again!",5,2018,07,29
42,Look no further. Almanac is perfect!,"My husband and I celebrated our 10 years aniversary in Barcelona, and booked a Grand  Via Cube at Almanac. We could not have made a better choice. From the moment we walked in we were met by the friendly and professional Almanac team accomodating our every need throughout our stay. The best service I have experienced in any hotel. Our room was super comfortable, absolutely spotless and with cool new technology applied. The hotel is quite new and beatifully decorated. I especially enjoyed the rooftop terrace, a perfect place to relax after a day of exploring the city. Breakfast is great, with a small but very tasty selection in the buffet, fresh juice and coffee of your choice. There is also a menu with warm dishes included and another menu with optional extras. If I had to point out any points of improvents, that would be that it took a little long to get coffee and orders from the hot menu, but than again I am beeing picky. I could not be more pleased with our stay, and will reccomend Almanac to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,07,25
42,Weekend away,Loved the Almanac. Stayed in a junior suite on the boulevard side. Loved all the technology in the room (lighting and curtains all controlled from pad by the bed). The room was well laid out. Nice touch with moving walls in the bathroom room. Also walk in wardrobe and separate toilet. Huge bed. Complimentary mini bar. Lots of added extras including the use of an iPad and phone. The staff were all amazing. Extremely friendly and helpful. The roof top bar and pool was extremely relaxing. Only slight negative was that my husband found the breakfast a little limited (he likes a full english). The location was perfect. Near lots of attractions and great places for food. Wonderful weekend. Hope to return.,5,2018,07,23
42,Best hotel in Barcelona,"My boyfriend and I stayed here this weekend for his birthday. I did a lot of research of different hotels in Barcelona, and I am so pleased I chose the Almanac. 

The hotel is brand new, and very modern. The staff are extremely helpful.

We stayed in a Gran Via room with a “Juliet” balcony. The king size bed was the comfiest I have ever slept in. Pillows were perfect. Complimentary snacks and drinks come with the room and are replaced as you use them - no mini bar charges to worry about here!  Room highlights included high-end furnishings and décor, free Wi-Fi, automated controls through a tablet (for lighting, temperature, the curtains, etc.), A huge large flat screen TV which you can connect to your own phone to play music through, the TV also connected to the bathroom speakers.

Breakfast - also included in the room, and up there as one of the most delicious hotel breakfasts I have had.

Rooftop - the rooftop bar and pool is absolutely beautiful. Lovely cocktails and stunning views of the city. The pool is also the perfect size to cool off in. 

The location of the hotel is great, walking distance to many places or a short taxi to anywhere you need to go in Barcelona.

Best hotel in Barcelona, and we cant wait to go back.",5,2018,07,23
42,5* Customer Service,"The customer service here is amazing. A new hotel (opened November 2017), their dedication to being a premier location is abundant. The breakfast (included with your stay) is phenomenal, their concierge assists with every detail- even towels and a sac for your beach excursion. All staff members are fluent in English, so we were spoiled. Room service is amazingly prompt. Highly recommend this hotel for couples or families. ",5,2018,07,21
42,Others should take lessons from the Almanac,"This is the 10th country I have visited in the past 4 months. I have stayed in all 5 star hotels and this hotel beats all. The staff are wonderful and eager to help. The room is spotless, modern and very comfortable. The hotel is in a great location. Breakfast is fantastic. The concierge are extremely eager to help and have done so on many occasions. They take pride in their work. To the manager, I commend you and your staff. I would not stay anywhere else. 
Thank you for making my stay a wonderful experience. ",5,2018,07,18

42,Beautiful new hotel in Barcelona ,"The hotel is brand new with a perfect location. It is 7 min  walking distance for two of Gaudi's designs and a walk distance to countless other tourists attractions. The interiors are are very well designed in a beautiful contemporary style. The rooftop overlook a beautiful view of Barcelona' unique architecture. The staff are super helpful, kind and caring.

Thanks to the images online I knew when we were almost there and the hotel meets the online images.
The service is friendly and helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and modern with useful technology, even the toilet! Best of all, having the use of a mobile phone while there was very, very helpful! I hope an Almanac opens in Montreal, Quebec!",5,2018,07,16
42,Amazing Hotel - excellent staff,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for five days in June. The staff could not have been more accommodating -- from helping to celebrate my husband's birthday to arranging a rental car for us for a day, they were great. When there was an issue with the AC in our room, they promptly fixed it to our satisfaction. Other than that minor snafu, the room was spotless -- so clean. The perk of a complimentary mini bar and lots of free water was also a really nice touch. Would absolutely recommend and stay here again. Excellent location too -- walking distance or a short taxi to anywhere you need to go in Barcelona.",5,2018,07,12
42,"Central modern and beautiful hotel, but with highly disorganised staff","Hotel Almanac Barcelona is a truly stunning hotel in central Barcelona. The staff are welcoming and friendly. The rooftop bar is trendy with unbelievable views over Barcelona. Rooms are trendy and if you pay more you obviously get a bigger room with the potential of a balcony, again, with stunning views over Barcelona. Beds are extremely comfortable. 

The problem was with the lack of professionalism from the staff. Although everyone I encountered were friendly, they are extremely disorganised and make too many mistakes. Everyday was filled with frustrations from all the mistakes made. It’s a 5-star Hotel, and the staff need to have 5-star training too. Getting the wrong and/or warm drinks at the bar, minibar refilled only if reminded of it several times, food in the restaurant took ages to be served and wasn’t all that good for what you paid, constant misunderstandings by the staff constantly getting things wrong. Making mistakes when checking out too. If there’s only one or two such occurrences, it’s forgivable, but given how much you pay to stay at this hotel, you’d expect top notch service all the time. Barcelona is an international city, staff at a 5-star hotel is supposed to have very good English, but not at this hotel. 

When you pay a lot of money for a hotel it’s also the little things that matter. They need to get this right. No one should leave this hotel shaking their heads in frustration. This could be such an amazing hotel if only they employed staff with previous experience from 5-star hotels, and gave them in depth training on what’s expected of them. The friendliness is there, but the rest is not. I’d give them 5 stars on the actual hotel, but 2 stars because of badly trained staff.",3,2018,07,09
42,Absolutely Perfect!!,"If you, like me, find yourself reading review after review searching for that perfect hotel in Barcelona (a city until last week I had never visited) do yourself a favor and (if a room is available) just book at the Almanac!
Their rating on trip adviser has jumped 50 points in just 2 weeks! This hotel is brand new and doesn’t have the number of reviews the other hotels do which is why they are not yet in the top 10, but mark my words this will be in the top 5 if not number 1 in very short order! 
Simply because it is the best! 
I have stayed in many fine hotels all over the world and this one has to be my favorite!  (I stayed one week Btw so would have seen some flaws during that time if there were any) 
Location - Perfect! Right in the center of the city - close enough to feel its beating heart yet insulated enough that once you step through the lobby doors you are home, in perfect luxury. 
Service - Perfect. Everyone is so gracious and speaks perfect English, eager to help with any issue be it suggesting a restaurant, calling a taxi, kindly and without being asked preparing and offering you a coffee and croissant to go as you head out the door for a very early flight.  (Daily housekeeping was lightning fast and meticulous btw) 
Rooms - Perfect! Stunningly so. I stayed in a Grand Cube and it’s just brilliant - cubes of glass on the side of the building with a beautiful divan so you can seemingly float over the living city below yet so insulated that sound is not an issue - heavy doors, glass, walls so that city noise is very very distant - rooms are peaceful refuges and felt the perfect size for one or two people. 
Rooms are also beautifully automated - climate, lighting, blinds all accessed through flat panels on each side of bed or by a smart phone which actually comes with each room and is yours to use during your stay. 
Do not pay attention to any negative reviews concerning this feature - it is the epitome of ease and comfort and utterly simple to use. 
Bed was fantastic. Pillows perfect. Rain shower was divine. Complimentary snacks and drinks and espresso/tea come with the room and are replaced as you use them - no mini bar charges to worry about here!
Breakfast - Perfect!! And guess what - it also comes with the room! Eggs cooked however you like them, bacon or sausages and coffee are prepared per order while a complementary buffet of fruits and breads and cold meats is laid out fresh daily. 
Rooftop bar - Perfect! Cozy little areas -  on different secluded  levels - of couches and club chairs, intimate lighting and music and a small pool with lounges, give you a sense of privacy while at the same time a spectacular view of the entire city as the moon rises and the night breezes whisper of the next day’s adventure. (Ok ok I got carried away there) 
Design - Perfect! Extremely modern yet so much thought was put into every detail - from the lush robes and slippers and the complimentary (wood!) combs and toothbrushes, to the lighting and architecture. 
I could go on but I think by now you get the point - this is hands down the place to stay in Barcelona - you will not regret it. 
And one more thing to consider - stay here while you still can - mark my words Almanac is soon to be the top ranked, continuously booked hotel in the city! 
Thank you Almanac! Just Perfect! ",5,2018,07,08
42,"Excellent location,building and staff ","This place is simply great from the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted by two doormen who were friendly and polite and took our bags away in seconds and the rest of the staff one we were inside were just as professional and eager to help as the two doormen.

While checking in we were given some nice ice tea to refresh us and were taken through a short induction as to where we were in relation to the sites to see and the hotel times and amenities. 

The outside of the hotel and lobby was very smart and clean and looked on point as did the staff, all were very friendly and well trained. The hotel is very central to a lot of the sites to see and only 5 minutes walk from the city bus collection point.

We were taken up to our room and impressed with the look and cleanliness of the hotel and how smart and modern it was.

But when we got to our grand via junior suite we were just blown away!.it was beautifully done out with marble floors and lovely interior design touches. We were giving a short guide as to how all the remote control lights, curtains and air con worked and what was in the complimentary mini bar and snacks, then our bags turned up followed by some champagne my fiancé had ordered weeks before arrival. We also got some complimentary drinks at the roof bar.
Our stay over 4 nights was excellent. Our room was kept spotless, cool and neat by the cleaners and was great to return to after a long day sight seeing.

The breakfast was also good and very tasty with a good choice in both the buffet and menu.

The roof bar was very smart and looked modern with very pleasant staff. There was an amazing view of the city to be had .It has a nice cool pool, it is only small and about 3 ft deep but refreshing non the less. The one thing that I did have an issue with was the lack of sun loungers as there are only 4.

I think some of the little used seating area could be used for sun loungers and the shower stand adjusted to fit more loungers poolside or nearby.

Now onto dinner! We ate one night at the hotel restaurant. The meal was without doubt one on the best meals myself and fiancé have ever had. We love eating out and have eaten at some of the best rated places around the world. The taster menu was amazing, each dish was a carefully cooked and well flavored delicious work of art!
So good In fact we had the chef come to our table to thank him and his team for the great meal. Again all the staff were great and the lady that served us knew what she was talking about in terms of the food and also had a lot of character and charm.

I did notice that the restaurant was a little short on customers and found that strange as the decor, service, cost and quality of the food should have had the place packed with customers.

I would recommend a advertisement campaign to promote the restaurant and a look at more information on the web page. Advertising the restaurant can only be good for the hotel too. 

If we return to Barcelona we would most definitely stay at this hotel and eat at the restaurant again.

Keep up the good work ! You made our trip to Barcelona perfect.

42,Absolutely amazing !!!,"There is nothing that haven’t thought of, the rooms are full of all modern features, iPad and smart phone to control every thing in the room. The interior detailing is beautiful and the service is excellent :)
We will definitely be returning 

The morning breakfast was equally inpressive",5,2018,06,17
42,Loved everything about this hotel!,"Just spent 3 nights at the Almanac with our 2 teens. We booked a Gallery Room (2 twin beds) and a Gran Via Room (1King). Although I expected them to be “connecting” they were next to each other at the end of the hall on the 3rd floor. There was a door that could potentially be closed to create a 2 bedroom suite but there was an issue with it so we kept it as 2 separate rooms. That being said. This wasn’t an issue at all for our family and in fact our teens enjoyed their privacy:) 
The hotel was gorgeous, new and very hip without feeling pretentious. The staff were friendly and service was impeccable. We booked the breakfast included rate and we were very happy we did - it was delicious and served the best cappuccino!
Great location in a safe & clean neighborhood with many sites & restaurants within walking distance.
Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,06,15
42,Amazing experience,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Almanac in Barcelona last weekend for my first visit to Barcelona. The hotel is not only amazing but the staff are some of the best I have come across in my travels !. The Almanac is relatively new and the fit out has taken everything into account, our room was extremely comfortable and had the latest technology to make the stay super comfortable, the toilet itself even lit up at night !! ( small things ! ). The roof terrace is a fab place to chill out, although the pool is only small, more for cooling off that swimming, its a great place to enjoy a few cocktails and is very popular with the locals. The food was excellent and the breakfast set us up for the day.
Overall I cannot highly recommend the Almanac enough and will definitely stay there again when I visit Barcelona again ... they have a few other hotels around Europe, so also looking into visiting some of those !",5,2018,06,15
42,Beautiful property,"This hotel has been very well designed and appointed with the latest in technology. The staff were excellent, the room very comfortable, the breakfast excellent and the rooftop bar beautiful. Centrally located to everything Barcelona has to offer. 10/10 bravo!",5,2018,06,13
42,"Friendly staff, excelent service in a very nice hotel","My wife an I stayed here for three nights on our trip to Barcelona, and the hotel it self was one of the highlights on our trip. From the moment we arrived the staff welcomed us and they upheld the same friendly and very high service throughout our stay.

The rooms are amazing and very clean. The housekeepers does a fantastic job making you feel welcome every time you return to your room.

I will recomend Almanac to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,06,12
42,Great Hotel Restaurant ,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in May with my 2 year old and we loved every minute of it.  The staff there were always happy and accommodating to our every need.  Big thanks to the concierge who gave us great recommendations to restaurants and  then helped us make all the reservations.  For the nights where we didn’t go out we ordered room service at the Linea restaurant.  Their cockles were the best we ever had and their seafood paella was also very tasty.  Be sure to have a few drinks at the roof top bar/pool.   The sangria is a must. Last, the previous reviews were right about the amazing coffee they have at breakfast.  Unfortunately, the coffee machine broke on the 2nd morning of our stay.  Hopefully it is fixed by now.   Yes,  I would highly recommend this hotel to family and single people.  ",5,2018,06,11
42,New and Minimal Vibe,"Arrived and was given an upgrade to a suite - thanks you!

Location is excellent near to the main drag in Barcelona

Room
VERY comfortable bed and sheets 
All modern digital controls - which sometimes could be a bit awkward to control- like the positioning of the switches next bed. Lights would go on automatically at night and then not go off.
Nespresso machine in suite living room for both coffee n tea.
HUGE living rool TV - but the sofa is at an angle that youwill be watching TV sideways unless you sit at the dinning table

Great bathroom with shower and huge bath - his and her sinks... separate toilet -had the ""Japanese toilet butt washer"" but it's a European brand - that I found was a bit dodgy to use. Going to this expensive they should have opted for the warm toilet seat. ;) I liked the amenities were in large bottles and not little samples sizes

Restaurant  Had a quick dinner - nothing special - found a bit of plastic in my salad - that I pointed out and they comp me the salad and coffee. Very apologetic.

Breakfast was very good - they have a hot order option and my eggs were done nicely. Staff were really nice - but service was patchy. Gotta give a shout out to I think his name was Jorge - looks like a football player- to the point people were taking his photo -LOL.  When I dropped by the hotel before my stay- he showed me around...and really ""sold"" me that I wanted to come back- luckily I had a reservation :))
Roof
There is a wading pool - so you cannot swim - but nice splash down.  Great views all around - relaxing area.
The barman (from Lithuania) was very professional when chatting with me - excellent English. 

Dropped by the gym - which is an OK room with some good new equipment - there's a sauna and steam room.

Lobby area is minimalistic and has a relax feel - there is a nice area with comfy seating and some water and snack bits.

Good stay - hotel needs to address finding more English speaking staff. But good addition to the BCN hotel scene",4,2018,06,08
42,Amazing!,"We just returned from Spain and stayed at the Almanac last week for 4 days. The hotel is  centrally located and yet slightly tucked away from the crowd and noise. Nice views from room. It is very accessible from metro and bus stops and is also within walking distance of several local attractions. Free access to minibar was appreciated. Breakfast selection while not huge, everything tasted good and it is great to have breakfast included. Best part of this hotel is its staff. They are very well trained, friendly, professional and helpful. Fantastic service! Will definitely return here next time.",5,2018,06,07
42,Can’t wait to come back!,"We were hesitant about this place because of the lack of reviews,However, once we arrived and checked in…We realized this place is perfection. Everything from the check in process, housekeeping, breakfast, rooftop bar was seamless. Almost everyone at the hotel speaks perfect English and they were always happy to assist with a smile.  We will be back next time we are Barcelona no doubt. 

With your room comes a cell phone (you can make free international calls) & a tablet. Great pluses.

42,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"Having visited Barcelona several times and never found a good hotel I booked this hotel with trepidation but what an amazing surprise when we arrived beautiful welcoming lobby and helpful and pleasant staff at reception.  We booked a Gran Via Junior suite which was superb in every way, housekeeping was excellent it is one of the nicest hotel rooms I have stayed in and I travel extensively for work all over the world.  Breakfast is unusual and excellent,service was a bit slow but as we were not under pressure to get out in the morning it didn't worry us.  Location excellent would not hesitate to recommend this hotel or return. Thank you for a lovely stay",5,2018,05,28
42,Different and Original,"They have a terrace and restaurant combined sofistication style with a ugly building in contrast, as Mandarin did first and the best idea to restore the buildings so different to the emblematic modernist ones",5,2018,05,28
42,New contemporary high-end technophile hotel; staff were super good to us; thank you Susana and team,"We were amazed by the time we arrived at the hotel foyer; the lobby is ferociously modern with super-cool decor, furniture and glass-lined spiral staircase; you can see that they take design seriously. The first of many Almanac hotels to come. 
The staff were very adept; excellent English speakers; they emailed us before we arrived to make sure our stay was up to par; even the manager who's absolutely brilliant to make our stay extra-special even though she was away. Now, that's service par excellence!
The check-in staff were good; helpful to organise our room, a Grand Via Junior Suite. At the reception, there is cool water available with really delicious popcorn; also supplied in the rooms for free; the minibar including tea maker (for us English-based folks) and coffee maker too and fresh milk anytime and food: popcorn, peanuts, crisps et al in room are all free!
The concierge is really helpful with us looking for authentic Japanese fare; he's that good as he lived in Japan before; also good with Lebanese food as we were looking for halal cuisine.
The front desk were really helpful when our flight back was cancelled and tried to help with Easyjet to find other arrangements. Really good of them. 
The Gran Via Junior Suite totally floored my wife and I; celebrating our anniversary in many ways. 
The bed is massive; the pillows so soft; the room controls brilliant with electronic controls on wall for curtains, lighting et al.
The balcony is nice to take pictures from. 
Breakfast could be improved with more vegetarian options such as vegetarian sausages, or fish fingers or salmon cuts for pescatarians. Otherwise, it's lovely; infused with local touches. We love the fact we could order Spanish omelette as well as other eggs to order. Wow! 
Drinks supplied were super delicious and healthy such as Ginger infused juices.
Rooftop bar is nice; nice pool to sit by; not deep enough to have a proper swim.
The gym downstairs has great machines; didn't get to use them enough as we were busy touring outside. 
Location is second to none. Apparently, the building was an old bank; centrally located.
Loved it. Recommend it. We've always looked for new modern stylish hotels; this ticked the box easily by far in Barcelona. 
Way ahead of even MO....that's not easily done.",5,2018,05,27
42,"Luxury, high tech hotel, but with some glitches ... and it's expensive!","Having visited Barcelona a number of times, I've struggled to find a really good and dependable hotel. This city is heavily visited, but hotels here tend to be lousy and poorly managed, to be frank. 

Firstly let me say the pros of this new hotel which opened in 2017. 

Being very new, you can therefore expect fresh newish furniture, modern decor, clean and new flooring, carpeting and ""hardware"". That is all fine and good. 

Location is great. At the corner or Gran Via and Passig De Gracia. Easy walking to the Metro station and to some of the major shopping areas of Barcelona. 

Reception staff were friendly enough, although a bit aloof. The concierge was helpful. The lobby is simple, yet tastefully designed, modern and minimalist, which I liked. 

The room I booked was a Gran Via Junior Suite. Truth be told, I loved the room, mostly. It was the right size for me (about 40-45 square meters). Everything felt and looked new, so that was great. The bed was firm enough and the bedding was fine. There was a nice view of Gran Via with a very tiny balcony to step on. The real and only problem was the use of technology in the room, which I shall elaborate later. 

Housekeeping was however, excellent and prompt. They did everything according to my liking and requirements, which was great. 

Breakfast was alright, but not fantastic. Staff were attentive and polite. I was glad that they provided fresh fruits but there were limited selections of cereals for example. The portions of the eggs cooked to order were also very small. I could imagine Americans and Australians feeling ""is that it?"". 

Now the cons. The management has decided that almost everything should be paperless and electronically controlled. So while it worked some of the time, it isn't all that intuitive. For example, the phone in the room did not work at times. The ordering of room service was cumbersome. The electronic switches were not intuitive either. So when you got out of bed to go to the toilet, the lights automatically came on and then they don't turn off after that! So you have to do it yourself on the touch screen control system. Whoever designed all of this did not really think through carefully enough. The light in the wardrobe kept switching on and off automatically, which was most irritating. 

There was also no proper work desk in my room. So for those of you who are in Barcelona on business and need a work desk, beware. This hotel may not be for you. 

Room service was sometimes hard to access. One evening, I had to wait for them to call me back, and it was a long wait. Well, at least they called! 

The rooftop lounge / bar area is a great place to unwind and socialise, but the furniture looked quite dirty, especially those that are sun-exposed and rain exposed. 

I paid about 700 Euros per night for the Junior Suite, which I would say is hefty by European standards, but perhaps in Barcelona and in this location, this is about the market rate these days. Yet, I'm not sure that the value for money is all that good. 

Overall, this hotel has great potential. I think the management needs to think more deeply on the electronic room controls and service needs improvement.",3,2018,05,26
42,Amazing new hotel!,"This is a wonderful new hotel in a upscale and perfect location. Cannot think of one thing wrong from the spacious and beautiful room, to the fabulous  breakfast, to the amazing service! Highly recommend stay here,",5,2018,05,17
42,Outstanding boutique hotel,"If you are thinking of a weekend away in Barcelona and you want that little bit of luxury then look no further.
This hotel is absolutely stunning not only visually inside and out the attention to detail is superb.
Having been fortunate to have stayed in some of the most beautiful and expensive hotels in the world I can honestly say the service and breakfast was the best I have ever seen and tasted.
The hotel is in the absolute perfect place to see everything you only need to walk outside and within a 5-10 minute walk you are in las rambles which is stunning with its luxurious shops and fantastic tapas restaurants etc.
A 20minute walk to the port which is close to the beach.
When you’ve spent the day walking you can go back to this wonderful hotel and relax having a glass of your choice on it’s gorgeous roof top terrace which over looks the cathedral and sea views can be seen.
The rooms are outstanding in design with all the latest technology.
The lighting and curtains can all be controlled by touch screen along with a free mini bar tea and coffee maker in each room.
We chose the standard room but we’re still very impressed however if you want a room with a view it maybe worth spending that little bit more.
I would recommend this hotel as one of my favourite hotels in the world and will definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,05,15
42,Great Hotel with even better service!,"We are just checking out after 6 great nights at the Almanac Barcelona. The hotel is great & position within Barcelona is perfect. What was a real standout was the service, hands down the best service we have had from any hotel in Europe, Asia, America or Australia. A special thanks to Francisco & Sergio, thank you very much for your recommendations & assistance!",5,2018,05,13
42,Solid hotel,"Stayed in a Terrace suite . A lot of interesting features, iPad room controls, comfortable beds, spacious rooms, nice roof deck , just not totally blowed away. The arrival was disjointed , food in the restaurant wasn't great , but overall for a Spanish hotel one of the top ones we stayed in.",4,2018,05,11
42,Outstanding experience ,"First time in Barcelona, a good friend recommend this brand new beautiful boutique hotel.  We love it! Contemporary design, outstanding service, room are spacious, clean and yes...location location location, next to all museum sightseeing and shopping! Great experience we definitely coming back!",5,2018,05,05
42,"Triumvirate Bullseye -  Location, Value, Service","I decided to take a chance on the newly opened Almanac Hotel, and was pleasantly surprised with the location, value, service and rooms.  I knocked one point off because things could be slow at times but overall they met our needs as much as possible.  The concierge even scored a last minute reservation at one of the top restaurants in the city! 

As always, I booked on booking.com for a rate of around $250 with breakfast included.  The location was extremely convenient for our stay, a five minute walk from the airport bus stop at placa de catalunya, and steps away from luxury shopping and restaurants. It felt like all tourist sites were less than a 20 minute walk away.  Check in was smooth and the front desk was extremely friendly and pleasant.  Small snacks and lemon water welcomes you upon arrival in the lobby.  The rooms are modern, and have floor to ceiling views to the outside city view.  I loved sitting on the daybed watching the city wake up. 
 Theres also a pleasant pool and bar area on the roof.  While on the small side, the rooms are new and have separate toilets from the shower area.  Beds are comfortable and lighting is just enough.  Blackout curtains assist in excellent nights sleep as well. 

 There was no counter space for anything and only one hook for a towel, but this is a design issue.  Breakfast was delicious, I would look forward to the array of cold cuts and cheeses every morning, which were very tasty.    There's a small buffet and an array of delectable al carte items such as small iberico ham sandwiches and fresh pressed juice. I wish I had time to eat lunch or dinner at the restaurant but there was too little time and too many amazing restaurants in Barcelona.   Also took advantage of room service and the snacks and wine were good as well.  Hotel clientale was a mix of hipsters and stylish professionals. 

All in all, a great stay, one standard of measure is looking forward to retiring at the hotel after long walks around the city. I expect to return soon.",4,2018,05,01
42,Amazing Hotel!,"We stayed in Almanac for 3 nights with my father and it was one of my best hotel experiences! I chose this hotel after a detailed research of Barcelona hotels and it was very much worth it. The service and hospitality was amazing and so were the luxury modern rooms and the food! Breakfast has wide selection and is great quality. We also had a dinner in hotel’s Linia restaurant and it was as quality as a fine dining restaurant - don’t miss it! Hotel’s location is very very central yet still far enough from the noisy crowd. Value for money is the best in Barcelona hotels and they guarantee a great experience for you! If you are going to Barcelona, don’t think twice and book Almanac! ",5,2018,04,30
42,Can’t Beat It!!!,"The most amazing hotel I’ve ever been to! I will now compare every other hotel to the Almanac! The best service I’ve ever experienced. 

Pros: Service, food, rooms are beautiful, curtains and lights controlled by a panel on the wall, they give you a cell phone to take with you for free while you’re there, free mini bar drinks, huge soft bath towels, free breakfast (order off the menu + bread and cheese service + fruit and dessert buffet), room service was superb. 

Cons: The room service menu could have a few more American friendly options. But that is merely a suggestion. ",5,2018,04,25
42,Gem of a Hotel,"Valet parking was nice.

Room had remote controlled blinds and lights. 

Breakfast was abundant. with kombucha and green smoothies also on offer. Continental tray brought to the table had over dry bread. so skipped warm toast in the mornings. Great variety at breakfast if you stayed for several nights.

Gym was good with new equipment although if you find it too small they work with a bigger gym so just ask. Sauna and steam room beautiful. With quiet relaxation area all located in the basement.

On the terrace you can definitely sunbath once the wind stops blowing. Service at the terrace bar is only from 6pm. (although Since the rooms have mobile phones you were allowed to order room service to be delivered to the terrace so no problems.)

will definitely visit again. Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2018,04,19
42,"Tech-Savvy, Luxury Hotel","Background/Booking:  My husband and I found the Almanac by accident; we had researched another hotel on TripAdvisor and were planning to book that hotel on Hotels.com.  While on Hotels.com, this hotel popped up…there weren’t a lot of reviews (as it’s a fairly new hotel) but the available reviews were all excellent, so we decided to take a chance and try it out.

Arrival/Check-in:  Prior to our stay, the hotel contacted us (via Hotels.com) to obtain our estimated arrival time, preferences and to verify if we had any questions?  We arrived at the hotel following a flight delay (thus, not in the best mood) but the hotel staff were nonetheless very kind; they quickly showed us to our room and gave us a tutorial of the room controls and features.  

Hotel:  The Almanac is a new 5-star “tech-savvy” luxury hotel located in Barcelona’s city center.  The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Plaza Catalunya (an Aerobus stop) and is also in walking distance to Las Ramblas, the Arc de Triomf, Casa Batlló, Casa Mila and La Sagrada Família.  Hotel highlights included an on-site restaurant, a rooftop bar/lounge, a rooftop pool, a gym and a treatment room/relaxation area (with a sauna and steam room.)
 
Room:  We stayed in a Gran Via room with a “Juliet” balcony.  Room highlights included high-end furnishings and décor, an extremely comfortable king bed, free Wi-Fi (that worked amazingly well), automated controls (for lighting, temperature, the curtains, etc.), a very large flat screen TV, an in-room tablet, an in-room safe, a hair dryer and bathrobes/slippers.  A unique feature of the room was the complimentary mini-bar!  The mini-bar included an expresso/coffee maker, a selection of beer, juices, soda & water and a variety of snacks & chocolates.  (As I don’t drink beer, I would have loved to see a sangria or wine option?  Despite that, we appreciated the free drinks and snacks!)  Another unique feature of the room was a complimentary smartphone for use during our stay.  We loved this amenity as we did not update our personal phones to an international plan for our trip.  Our only “smartphone” complaint was that the maps feature only allowed you to access your current location or select destinations; it did not allow you to search for any name or address for directions.  (We stayed in another hotel during our trip and their smartphone had fully-enabled map and search features.  I would recommend the hotel consider enhancing the map and search features for guests.)  On a final “technical” note, the room included numerous outlets for charging devices, converters for international guests and allowed guests to access the room controls via the in-room control panel, the in-room tablet or the complimentary smartphone.

Línia Breakfast:  Breakfast was complimentary for all guests and consisted of a bread/pastry platter, an a la carte menu and several buffet stations.  Coffee, tea, water, juices and kombucha were also included.  The service was very attentive and all of the food/drinks were of a high quality.

Notes:  The concierge services were available 24 hours a day and were very helpful!  We utilized the concierge services to book several tours/tickets and for restaurant recommendations.  The hotel staff were great; well-trained, knowledgeable of the area and always friendly.

Overall:  We had disappointing weather during our visit to Barcelona but we still had a great stay thanks to the Almanac. The hotel was superb!  I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers and would like to try another Almanac in the future!",5,2018,04,10
42,Having a nice lunch,"Excellent service,high cuisine,beautiful presentación and the top of it breathtaking view from the roof terrace.A big wow!
Try the menú to share and don't have anything else for the rest of  the day😁!
The pool on the terrace has salty water,so a big yes for this choice too to this fancy hotel.",5,2018,04,08
42,Simply superb,"Stayed here for a family birthday trip and it did not disappoint. From the minute we arrived the staff couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful. Went out of their way to give you a fantastic experience. Even arranged a cake and balloons for the birthday surprise. Stunning new hotel in one of the best locations  in Barcelona, a stone’s throw away from La Rambla and great shops. Cube rooms are amazing and views from the windows stunning. Nice sized room with everything you could want and the free minibar a nice touch. Roof terrace with plunge pool gives great views of the city and a terrific place for a sun downer or late evening drinks. Breakfasts are epic! Nice little fitness suite, sauna and steam room in the basement. Whole Almanac experience was fab- highly recommend.",5,2018,03,30
42,Modern hotel with fantastisk service,"The hotel is new and very modern with automatic lights and curtains in the room. Great breakfast which includes a small buffe and an included a la carte menu. The location is vey central and walking distances to most central attractions, flagship stores of inditex brands (Zara, etc), restaurants and bars. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and although I'm always skeptic of restaurants recommended by the hotel, the staff gave us very good recommendations on local restaurants.

To summarize, it's a great hotel at a great location but what stood out for us compared to other great hotels at great locations is the extremely service-minded staff which made our stay special.",5,2018,03,30
42,Expensive but very good for a special trip,"Stayed here for a 3 night city break with husband and had booked corner cube suite.  Helpful pre arrival emails with hotel - however they are clearly expecting a certain clientele, when asked about transport from airport they offered to arrange limousine to hotel at more than 100 euros!  When I replied that we'd be coming by public transport however they did send helpful links and info about the aerobus (very straightforward 6 euro e/w) and the metro.
Lovely touches on arrival, glass of water offered at the desk, luggage taken up to room without fuss and check in at midday no problem.  Room was lovely, spacious, generous bathroom toiletries etc, slippers/robes of good quality - bed enormous and very comfortable with v good pillows etc.  Climate control and blinds all worked well but a bit complicated - there is an in room tablet and phone - all a bit OTT perhaps for us?  Lovely window seats in bedroom and siitting room with great view over Gran Via - had not been to Barcelona before so hadn't realised would be quite a noisy road.  The soundproofing is pretty good to be fair but still disturbed a little by traffic noise especially in the early morning.  Also heard a little rumbling from the metro underneath (we were on 2nd floor) - not intrusive though.  More disturbing was the noise through the interconnecting door into 205.  There was a couple with young child and we could hear them and the TV from the entrance hall.  The interconnecting door is great if travelling with your own family but not so well insulated for sound if next door to others.  We mentioned both this and the traffic noise to the hotel staff the next day - they were very helpful, apologetic and took trouble to find out that the next door family were actually checking out that day.  They showed us an alternative room (706) on the rear of the hotel - view not so nice and no window seats but very quiet - we decided to move and spent the next 2 nights there - totally undisturbed.
I had room service meal the first night - the restaurant was able to put together a simple pasta dish and salad not on the menu but they were very helpful and also made me a fresh lemonade - also not on the menu.  All were delicious and served quickly (pasta a little cool on arrival but otherwise lovely). Restaurant manager was really helpful and happy to organise this.
We ate in the restaurant the 2nd night.  Atmosphere a bit dull as not many eating in but the food was superb and service good.  An extra tea appeared on the bill but was taken off after speaking to the front desk the next day.
Breakfasts were also delicious, both hot and cold options, free flowing freshly squeezed OJ and quality pastries etc.  Music a bit loud during breakfast.
Little homemade morsels in the lobby all day (the marshmallows are amazing!). Bar area on the roof is lovely but was deserted all the time I checked during our stay - perhaps because it is not yet well known and the hotel was not full.
Overall the service stood out as being really good.  They are clearly keen to give a good impression and make you feel like nothing is too much trouble.  Rooms are expensive but hotel is 5 minute walk from Placa Catalunya so very central.",5,2018,03,24
42,Wonderful ,"The food was great and the hotel in general. We loved every minute of our stay in this most excellent hotel it’s well located and the smell is wonderful and when you asked for foods they are really helpful and we like the food that we ate and the drinks and the decoration is quite nice I really liked it as well because the rooms were beautiful and I think the name is very fitting.They were very nice and treated us very well they couldn’t bring me pancakes so they invited me to any dessert that I wanted ,it was great",5,2018,03,22

42,Fabulous Hotel,"We stay here for 4 nights and loved everything about  this new little hotel. The staff was very welcoming, helpful and friendly. The hotel is new so beautiful decorated with all the moderne amenities, also it is in a great central  location. The breakfast is awesome!  Breads, eggs jellies ham, pancakes , smoked salmon, chocolate, donuts, and KOBUCHA!  Also excellent coffee and juice. We were also lucky to have a nice day, we had drinks on the roof deck which  was beautiful. Would definitely go back, highly recommend!",5,2018,03,21
42,Nice hotel,"Summary: Newly built high-end design hotel with a small gym and a few to many quirks

I guess expectations are everything, and when you stay at a hotel that is #1 on Trip Advisor with a 5.0 rating and the most expensive hotel in the area, expectations are very high indeed.  This hotel is very nice no doubt, but to be honest I didn't really fall for it.

For starters: the service.  Other reviewers just rave about the amazing service.  We didn't feel that.  Every single time we were at reception - and it was far more often than we would have liked - the person working there took a phone call mid-conversation and made us wait.  Every single time.  We were also frequently passed around from person to person, often in conjunction with aforementioned phone calls: when the person helping us understood that the phone call they took was going to take too long, they asked someone else to help us, so we had to start all over again.  Breakfast orders were forgotten.  When we decided we needed to stay another night, it took 4(!) visits to reception to get it sorted.  We didn't receive any room keys when checking in, and when we received new keys, they didn't work.  I'm not saying that the service was catastrophic, but it was below average for a 5-star hotel.

We stayed in a ""Cube"" room, which was beautiful and cool - the room is on the street and features a glass box containing a sofa.  The blinds, lighting, and climate are controlled by touch panels, which my girlfriend found impossible to understand and I also grappled with, despite a (very necessary) run down by hotel staff when we first arrived.  Overall, I would say that the room greatly favors form over function.  For example the lighting controls feature ""scenes"", none of which worked well for us.  Especially the ""relax"" scene I found to be far too cold (color-temperature wise), and I never worked out how to control the lamps individually, if that's even possible.  The shower is beautiful, but impossible to understand: there are three identical taps with no labels so the only way to work things out is to try turning them around randomly and get squirted in the face by freezing water until you finally get it right.  There's a shelf, which is good, but it's tiny and already full, so there was nowhere to put a razor, it had to sit on the floor.  There's a hair dryer, which is great, but the wall contact for it has a magnetic cover which falls off every time you unplug it.  The curtains around the Cube automatically close when you leave the room, which is really smart, however they automatically open again when you come back, which cool, but not always what you want.  On the plus side, the Cube itself is well sound-proofed and the light control is amazing with the curtains closed.  Barcelone is a bustling city, and you can still hear the traffic outside, but it's very muffled, and we slept well.

Breakfast was included, and it was a bit odd.  When arriving at breakfast, there's no person standing at the entrance to greet you, so you're unsure what to do.  There's a tiny buffet, and the first impression is very negative: this is it!?  Upon approaching a staff member, who are busy running around, you eventually work out that the breakfast is a very unusual combination of free seating, a la carte, plus a small buffet.  It's a weird concept, which I don't have anything against, really, but it should be explained clearly.  One staff member assigned to the breakfast entrance to greet all hotel guests could explain this all upon arrival and skip a lot of confusion.  The a la carte menu is almost ridiculously hipsterish.  Want a bowl of corn flakes?  How about some quinoa & blueberry with organic kale flakes and goat yoghurt?  No, just want those corn flakes with milk?  Well you're out of luck, since everything on the menu is straight out of Williamsburg (also: define milk!  They have a milk menu).

The roof terrace is amazing!  The most beautiful I've seen in Barcelona.  We received incorrect info when checking in, though: we were told that it's open from 6pm onwards, however in fact it's open 24 hours a day, but drinks and snacks are only served from 6pm onwards.  This meant that we missed a great photo op the first morning and makes no sense at this time of year: from 6pm, it's freezing up there.  Also, at a 5 star hotel, drinks and snacks should be served all day long.  I would highly recommend having the rooftop staffed from 12 noon onwards.  Hotel Majestic's rooftop has service all day long and is packed with guests all the time.  Almanac should be able to match that.

Overall this is definitely a good hotel and most people will be happy here, however I just didn't feel like we received good value for money.  If you're a hipser, Soho House is a better bet, and if you're not, Majestic does ""classic 5 star"" better.",3,2018,03,20
42,Excellent hotel in a central location,"Stayed here for a short city break and it really is difficult to fault this newly opened (4 months ago) hotel. What did we like about it? Excellent location, super-attentive staff, daily re-stocked free mini bar, great breakfast, lovely walk-in marble shower. And perhaps best of all is the fact that it is centrally located on a busy junction but the rooms are extremely well sound proofed. Also, the door to the corridor is very solidly built so the room was an oasis of tranquility in the centre of a bustling city. The previous reviews are well justified.",5,2018,03,17
42,Fabulous,"This hotel is superb.  The service was terrific, the staff took a lot of time providing advice, getting tickets etc.  the room was excellent, the breakfasts wonderful as was the one dinner we had there.  The location was great.
The hotel is very new, which I think explains why my husband and I could enjoy this quality of service.  
Stay here if you can.",5,2018,03,11
42,Unforgettable stay,"It was my first time to Barcelona and Almanac has sure given me a warm welcome to my stay. Stayed throughout Christmas time, staff were very helpful and super dedicated to their service. Hotel was only 1 month old. Stayed in Gallery Room. Room was very generous and well designed. Got to watch sunrise everyday and had the perfect Barcelona city view. I enjoyed every minute of my stay, Will definitely go back. Lumia is a great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Everything was delicious. Service was impeccable.",5,2018,02,28

42,Great hotel with amazing service,"The location of this hotel is fantastic. So is the cuisine. I can't recommend it high enough.

42,Style & Substance,"We really enjoyed our stay at Almanac. It’s a great location for a long weekend . The Hotel itself has a modern stylish feel about it without being pretentious. The room décor is fantastic and really just feel like you are in a 5 star boutique hotel. The service is exceptional, they really do all they can to help you from simple things like hailing a taxi, providing advice on places to see and also the most important for us nice places to eat that are Veggie friendly. They delivered on this which surprised us within a city that has meat hanging everywhere! Even at breakfast, the staff are so friendly and even remember what drink you ordered the previous visit and its ready when you sit!

 Also special mention to Sergio for helping me on a nice surprise for my wife. Overall I would without question recommend this hotel.",5,2018,02,07

42,The Almanac is Fab!,"Just stayed at the Almanac in Barcelona. Amazing new property with all the high tech elements that we want in a hotel room (USB plugs where we want them - bedside -, buttons to turn up shades and open curtains, fancy Japanese toilets!). Just loved the room and the bed was soooo comfy! The food was also incredible. Ate at Linea, their restaurant and it was truly incredible! Loved it and the staff. Overall, the Almanac is amazing and will be the new ""it"" place to stay! Beautiful decor in common areas as well as the rooms. The rooftop bar and pool are amazing and will be a great spot during hot summer months to hang out and enjoy a cocktail. Views are amazing - including the Sagrada Familia. Can't be that!",5,2017,12,01

42,No vayas,"La verdad es que son auténtico desastre . el día que llegué no me dejaron utilizar la habitación hasta las 4:30 de la tarde. la habitación es pequeña y ni siquiera tiene una mesa para poder trabajar.  los amenITIeS son escasos (solo una pastilla de jabón) y de hecho tuve que pedir pasta de dientes por dos veces hasta que me la trajeron. la persiana que es eléctrica se atasca constantemente. Parece que el idioma oficial del Hotel es el inglés: el personal se dirige a ti en inglés, los mandos de domótica de la habitación están en inglés y la televisión está en inglés. Para más inri teníamos dos habitaciones individuales reservadas y una de las personas no pudo desplazarse a Barcelona por haber dado positivo en COVID y se negaron en redondo a reintegrarnos el importe de la habitación que estaba preparada. Me parecen unos impresentables",1,2022,07,27
42,estuve encantado,"el hotel y ubicacion sensacional, el personas de recepcion, coserje, bellboy muy amables y haciendo la estancia muy familiar y como en casa, con mucha intencion de regresar y ya lo he recomendado a mis amigos y familiares como una gran opcion para viajar a barcelona, sin duda la proxima ocasion ahi llegare. muy notable la amabilidad de todo el personal¡¡¡",5,2022,07,19
42,Schöner Aufenthalt in zentralem 5 Sterne Boutique Hotel,"Das Hotel besticht vor allem durch tolles Interieur und zentrale Lage. Wir waren in der Junior Suite untergebracht, die sowohl ein sehr geräumiges Badezimmer hat - mit zwei Waschbecken - als auch ein wunderbar bequemes Bett, das in Kombination mit den elektronisch zu bedienenden Verdunklungsvorhängen zu einem optimalem Schlaferlebnis geführt hat. 

Zusätzlich verfügt das Hotel über eine schöne Dachterrasse mit Sitzgelegenheiten, Pool und Liegen. Auch der Restaurantbereich, in dem das Frühstück gereicht wird, hat uns optisch sehr zugesagt. 

Abschließend lässt sich noch das Empfangsgeschenk erwähnen, das uns besonders gefallen hat: Eine Tafel Schokolade, auf der die Silhouette der Weltkarte abgezeichnet ist. Die haben wir direkt nachgekauft und als Souvenir zuhause verschenkt :)

Im Ergebnis: Für mich ein rundum gelungener Aufenthalt.",4,2022,07,17

42,Gelungener Aufenthalt:),Tolles 5* Hotel mit sehr gutem service. Wir hatten ein Upgrade in die Almanac suite bekommen. Schön geschnittenes Zimmer mit grosszügigem Schlaf- und Wohnbereich. Das Badezimmer ist ebenfalls sehr geräumig. Wasser und Café stand aussreichen for free zu Verfügung. Das Frühstück war ok. Die Auswahl etwas begrenzt. Trotzdem hat es uns mit seinen a la Card Speisen und dem leckeren Saft Menü überzeugt. Parkservice verfügbar kosten 35 € für 24 h. Die rooftop bar sowie das restaurant haben uns ebenfalls überzeugt. Wir kommen gerne wieder,5,2022,02,07
42,ABER!!!!,"Generell würde ich diesem Hotel wie bei der letzten Bewertung 2019 eigentlich gerne 5 Punkte geben….ABER….von einem 5 Sterne GL erwarte ich in allen Bereichen eben auch 5 GL! Empfang gut….Zimmer nahezu perfekt aber auch nicht mehr….jetzt kommt aber der Knackpunkt….und bei einem Preis von 300 muss halt auch das Frühstück perfekt sein….was ist passiert….Etagere mit Brot und Gebäck….Toast war nicht getoastet….dann frisch gepressten Saft bestellt…leider mit hohem Wasseranteil! Jamon Iberico….Teller serviert mit 80% Fettanteil….Brot mit Avocado und pochierten Ei…leider komplett ins Auge gegangen…..Käse….wir baten um eine Weichkäseauswahl….nicht verfügbar….lediglich eine Käsesorte….eine….neue Lieferung am Montag erwartet….Kaffee aus dem Automaten….sorry….die Liste ist zu lang….Reklamation wurde lediglich zur Kenntnis genommen….

42,Perfekt in jeder Hinsicht!,"Hatten ein verlängertes Wochenende.
Konnten nach Vorankündigung ohne Probleme bereits um 11:00 einchecken.
Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und verfügte über einen großen Kasten mit reichlich Ablage und Hängemöglichkeiten mit mehr als genug Kleiderbügeln (meiner Frau fiel auf, dass auch gepolsterte Kleiderbügel für Seidenblusen dabei waren).
Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen - die U-Bahnen sind in fünf Minuten Fußweg erreichbar. Man ist in drei Minuten am Haupteinkaufsboulevard und in acht Minuten auf der Rambla.
Das Frühstück war von der Qualität her sehr gut - die warmen Speisen werden nach Bestellung frisch zubereitet, was mir persönlich lieber ist als ein Buffett mit einer meist halb lauwarmen Eierspeise - dass man ein paar Minuten darauf warten muss liegt in der Natur der Sache aber auf frisch zubereitetes warte ich gerne!

42,Outstanding Hotel,Eine ganz feine Adresse in der Service wirklich gelebt wird. Herzlicher Empfang und ein sehr schönes geschmackvolles Zimmer. Man kann hier wirklich das gesamte Personal ausnahmslos loben. Keine einzige Schwäche in keinem Bereich. Die rooftop Bar ist wunderbar mit schöner Aussicht.

42,Molto buono,"In una posizione eccellente! 
Ci si sta bene. il personale è cortese.
Pochi consigli: 
- un po più di attenzione  nel risistemare le camere prima della notte (gli addetti passano alle 18 (che è un può presto visto che magari si rientra a quell'ora e ci si vuole riposare prima di cena) e,  se siete in camera e chiedete loro di tornare più tardi, dicono che va bene ma poi non si vede più nessuno;
- la colazione è un pò spartana e il servizio ai tavoli un pò lento.

Estabamos 3 parejas en todo el recinto cubierto por lo que considero que despues de pagar 57 euros por dos sandwiches, 4 bebidas y un par de postres no es mucho pedir que un cafe y un te no te lo hayan servido despues de una espera de 25 minutos.
Pasado este tiempo hemos pedido la cuenta y no se han inmutado en exceso. Han pedido disculpas por el retraso en general pero no han hecho mi ademan de servir el cafe y el te de inmediato. Ahhh y que nadie se manche porque en este hotel no saben lo que es el cebralin",1,2018,08,04

La stanza è dotata dei più noti ed efficaci dispositivi tecnologici (controller digitale per apertura/chiusura tende,  temperatura e velocità dell’aria condizionata, luci, volume dei device collegati al bluetooth), cassaforte, free minibar ben fornito e di qualità (è presente un macchina Nespresso in stanza con le relative cialde), ottima doccia, letto matrimoniale comodissimo, Tv Lg ultima generazione.
Pulizia impeccabile, la camera veniva sistemata più volte al giorno, con relativo cambio degli asciugamani usati.
Il personale oltre ad essere molto professionale è di una cordialità straordinaria.
All’ottavo piano sulla terrazza, si trova un bar con tavoli interni ed esterni, dai quali si può gustare la vista mozzafiato della città, c’è anche una piccola piscina con lettini sdraio king size comodi per relax .
Complimenti, semplicemente perfetto.",5,2018,07,17
42,Excelencia,"un servicio impecable, terraza muy agradable y restauración cuidada, lifestyle, buen rollo y lujo, super recomendable. Tuvimos visitantes amigos y los alojamos alli y ha sido todo un acierto, quedaron encantados y nosotros quedamos a la altura!",5,2018,05,26
42,Una terraza de lujo al lado de paseo de gracia.,"En pleno centro de Barcelona encontrareis un nuevo hotel de cinco estrellas, a cinco minutos del emblemático paseo de gracia y  con una decoración exquisita. Tiene un restaurante y en la planta ocho tiene una espléndida terraza con flores y vegetación increíble. Las vistas son espectaculares, si quieres desconectar y disfrutar de la tranquilidad es una gran idea. Os lo recomiendo muchísimo y el trato es exquisito.",5,2018,05,18
42,Perfektes Hotel für den Barcelona-Aufenthalt,"Ich bin zum ersten Mal in Barcelona und hätte mir kein besseres Hotel wünschen können. Topmoderne stylische Zimmer mit allem Komfort, gefüllte Minibar, schöne Dachterrasse und vor allen Dingen ein perfekter Service. Morgens beim Frühstück sollte man Zeit mitbringen, um die Vielfalt des A-la-Carte-Angebotes genießen zu können, da alles etwas länger dauert, aber mit viel Liebe angerichtet wird.
Wir hatten einen Cube-Room mit tollem Blick über die Dächer der Stadt. Die Lage ist perfekt, um zu den interessantesten Plätzen zu kommen. Eine Oase der Ruhe nach einem Tag in der Stadt. Uneingeschränkt 5 Sterne!!!",5,2018,05,09
42,Grazieeee ,"Abbiamo passato 4 giorni in questo bellissimo hotel,ottima posizione  ,personale molto gentile ,ottima accoglienza ,camera sempre ben pulita, unica pecca poco personale in terrazza.Ci ritorneremo sicuramente.",5,2018,05,08
42,Consigliato,"Mi sono fermato l’ultima notte di vacanza a Barcellona in questo hotel, devo dire che il personale è veramente gentile e sempre attento a ogni esigenza del cliente.
Camere molto pulite e dotate di ogni comfort anche per i più esigenti",4,2018,05,06
42,Vorrei dire eccellente ma ...,"Forse uno degli alberghi più accoglienti in cui sia mai stata sia per la piacevolezza ed eleganza degli ambienti sia per le attenzioni del personale. Pulizia perfetta , la camera veniva sistemata in continuazione, quasi non veniva voglia di uscire e godersi quel bel terrazzo. Se non do’ un eccellente è solo per auspicare che miglior cura sia dedicata al servizio bar del rooftop dove non c’è stato pulito il tavolino ed i cocktail sono stati accompagnati da due tristi vaschette di verdura disidratata. Un appunto ahimè vorrei farlo anche al servizio colazione. Bella l’idea di portare a tavola un vassoio di pane e croissant con marmellata e burro tuttavia il servizio è un po’ lento e poco accurato (la crêpes è arrivata a tavola fredda ed indurita). Peccato! Tuttavia è un ottimo albergo in posizione centralissima e senz’altro da consigliare. ",4,2018,05,01
42,Assolutamente perfetto.,"La struttura è nuova, lo stile è moderno e l'arredamento è curato nei minimi dettagli sia in termini di funzionalità che di eleganza. Il personale è molto disponibile gentile e professionale e riesce ad essere estremamente servizievole senza diventare mai invadente. 

Le stanze sono molto confortevoli e la domotica la fa da padrona: luci, tende e clima sono controllabili dai pannelli touch screen posti ali lati del letto oppure dallo smartphone o dal tablet in dotazione. Dai dispositivi mobili è possibile inoltre accedere ai servizi dell'albergo ed effettuare gratuitamente chiamate nazionali ed internazionali. 

Il letto ed i cuscini sono molto confortevoli, gli armadi sono comodi, capienti e contengono tutti ciò che serve per godere di un soggiorno confortevole. Il mini bar è adeguato. 

Come spesso accade fuori dall'Italia nel bagno non c'è il bidè, ma questa mancanza è colmata dal sistema automatico di igiene intima integrato nel WC ultramoderno che si può controllare con un apposito telecomando. Nemmeno da dire, il servizio di pulizia è ineccepibile.

Assolutamente degno di nota il ristorante Lina nel quale si consuma la colazione o è possibile pranzare e cenare gustando piatti di altissima qualità in un ambiente moderno, accogliente e confortevole e con un servizio impeccabile, insomma in linea con l'hotel. 

Anche la colazione è un'esperienza che va oltre il servizio o la qualità dei cibi proposti, una vera coccola per cominciare alla grande la giornata.

Per finire la terrazza con piscina sul tetto dell'edificio, forse un po' risicata come spazi rispetto ad altri hotel di categoria, ma senza dubbio molto curata ed accogliente.

Concludendo, io viaggio parecchio sia per svago che per lavoro, ma non scrivo molte recensioni (anche perché diventerebbe quasi un lavoro!), ma questa volta ho voluto perdere questi 15 minuti perché devo dire che questo è senza dubbio una delle migliori strutture dove abbia alloggiato. Non è economico, ma il rapporto qualità prezzo c'è tutto.",5,2018,04,26
42,Espectacular!!!,"Una experiencia extraordinaria! El sitio perfecto para pasar una tarde con los compañeros de trabajo, en la terraza! El servicio impecable! Gracias Sergio por la hospitalidad! Y gracias a Nico y Alessandra por el servicio impecable! Volveremos! ",5,2018,04,13
42,TOP LAGE !,"Fangen wir mit der Abholung Airport an - perfektes Timing - im Mercedes S Klasse ein Getränk und auf dem schnellsten Wege ins Hotel. Rascher check in - perfekt - Zimmer angenehme Größe und Minibar inklusive ( Manko : es wurde NIE nachgefüllt - weder Kaffee , Tee noch ein Getränk - aufgefüllt wurde nur das Trinkwasser .. bei dem Preis ist ein oder ein zweites Bierchen im Laufe von 3 Nächten nicht das Thema glaube ich, dto. mit nespresso - wenn wir das gewusst hätten, hätten wir als vielkaffeetrinker welchen mitgenommen  ) - natürlich bekommt man beim Frühstück - trotzdem - das kennen wir besser ;-) - BAR - ein Traum - leider für uns etwas zu kalt und daher sind wir dann in das Hotel an die Bar - Getränk wurde aufgenommen  - Kellnerwechsel und darauf hin haben wir 30 Minuten auf unser Getränk gewartet ... das wir  leider erst auf Nachfrage dann erhalten haben - ich war da ein wenig  sauer. ABER - wir waren jeden Tag an der Bar und der Kellner war einfach zu gut um hier noch böse zu sein . Am nächsten Tag lief das wie am Schnürchen  ! ESSEN : sehr gut - beim Menü jedoch ein schneidiges Tempo - war uns viel zu schnell - der Tisch wird sich vermutlich nicht 2 x drehen - also kann man es absolut ruhiger angehen. Pro Tisch gefühlter 1 Kellner - wir hatten eine Dame - PERFEKT , zuvorkommend , gut beratend und gut erklärend - TOP . Frühstück : zweischneidig - für uns hat es gepasst. Sicher nicht jeder Manns Sache - Kleines Buffet - jedoch eine Karte um a la carte zu bestellen - bin mir sicher man bekommt auch was nicht auf der Karte steht ! Wieder - TOP Bedienung - immer anwesend und sehr bemüht ! Check out - gleich zügig - Taxi gerufen und noch ein Abschiedsgeschenk in  Form eines Parfums - welches hier verwendet wird.    Normalerweise würde ich auf 4 Punkte tendieren und bewerten - ABER - es sind sicherlich Anfangsprobleme , hat definitiv Potential , eine tolle ROOF BAR und vor allem ein absolute TOP LAGE - daher 5 - beim 2. Besuch wird aber wieder rigoros bewertet ;-)))) Dank an das Team was uns einen Tollen Urlaub bescherte !!!",5,2018,04,03
42,Bar y Terraza: calidad,"Detalles como una cerveza artesana con la marca del hotel, son más que destacables. La atención en el lobbybar y las vistas de la terraza son cosas que mencionar. TODO POSITIVO. Deseando que llegue el calorcito para poder disfrutar de la terraza plenamente. Volveremos",5,2018,04,01
42,Una gran opción ,"El hotel tiene lo que busco, céntrico, ese toque de hotel boutique, una mezcla de lujo moderno donde todo es Tan clásico y moderno a la vez, la atención del personal es muy buena.

Además la ubicación es perfecta para moverte por los puntos importantes y destacados de la ciudad a pie.

Las habitaciones son excelentes y los WC tiene ese toqueJapones(quien a ido a Japón lo entenderá)",5,2018,03,08
42,Wochenende in Barcelona ,"Sehr zentral gelegenes modernes und sehr gepflegtes Hotel. Hübsche aber sehr teure Zimmer. Frühstück mehr als dürftig. Auf gar keinen Fall ein Luxushotel! Wir könnten dort am zweiten Abend nicht essen, da geschlossene Gesellschaft ohne das man uns das vorher sagte. Krönung des Ganzen, nach meiner Beschwerde meinte der Manager ab 22:30 Uhr könnte man doch essen, ansonsten solle ich mir was suchen. 5 Sterne???? Wir bestimmt nicht wieder. Ach ja wir bezahlten 420€ pro Nacht für die kleine Juniorsuite.",3,2018,02,27
42,Una joya en El Centro de Barcelona,Un serviço excelente con un mini-bar incluido. El Wifi que se conecta automaticamente sin necesidad de passwords. El room service siempre deseoso de ayudar. Todo hecho con una sonrisa y para satisfacer al viajero mas exigente. La ubicación en increíble en pleno centro de Barcelona!,5,2018,02,12
42,por negocios convertidos en placer,"Visitamos Barcelona por negocios y el hotel que eligió la empresa para nosotros es tan bueno que sentimos estamos en viaje de placer, muy bien atendidos, espacios generosos, buenas camas, limpio inmaculado, desayunos perfectos, que mas se puede pediR",5,2018,02,10

42,Inmejorable!!! ,"Nuestra intención sólo era tomar un café y finalmente nos quedamos 3 horas. Sus instalaciones son magníficas, la terraza preciosa con unas vistas muy bonitas a barcelona, pero sin duda lo mejor el personal que nos atendió. Especialmente Joan, Kike y Javier. Les agradecemos la atención impecable que tuvieron con nosotras. Sin duda, volveremos!! ",5,2018,01,31
42,Gran experiencia,"Es un hotel fantastico, con muy buena ubicación. Innovador y con unas vistas espectaculares. El personal estuvo muy atento i amable, con todas las facilidades que buscas en un hotel de categoria. La habitacion me sorprendió, tiene de todo, comodidad, vistas, glamour. La carta del desayuno simplemente espectacular, hechas por el chef del hotel. Hicimos unas sesiones de spa y masaje que quedamos como nuevos, tambien tienen sala de gimnasio. No dudaria en volver a venir. ",5,2017,12,18
42,Un 10,"Aunque recién inaugurado, es de las mejores experiencias que he tenido. Aunque es muy difícil poder destacar alguna cosa sobre lo demás creo que el personal es lo que más nos ha gustado. Todos súper atentos y muy profesionales. Además, la ubicación es de 10. A apenas unos pasos de Passeig de Gracia. Las habitaciones son espectaculares, con todo cuidado hasta el mínimo detalle. Spa, restaurante con muy buena carta, gimnasio con lo necesario. 
Espectacular! Para repetir!",5,2017,12,17
