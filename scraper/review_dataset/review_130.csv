130,Arrogant manager at the breakfast room,"After many years of visiting the Dorchester for breakfast, we were refused entry by the manager at the dining room, 
She was as arrogant as someone can be, and turned us back, we ended up going to claridges who not only been super accommodating and professional, but also served us with better service and certainly better food.",1,2024,10,19
130,Fabulous stay,"We recently had a wonderful two night stay at this beautiful hotel to celebrate our 80th and 90th birthdays, and were looked after to a legendary degree by all the staff.  We had a lovely surprise when we entered our room to find balloons. a bowl of fruit, a fantastic birthday cake and a bottle of champagne waiting for us.  We had drinks in the exquisite Artists Bar and dinner in the Promenade, plus breakfast and all the Managers and staff were very welcoming, professional and extremely friendly.  Reception staff were superb and nothing was too much trouble for them.  It really was a very special visit for us and we would like to thank everyone involved.  Next year we will be celebrating our Golden Wedding and  hope to be able to celebrate that with you too.",5,2024,10,02
130,Always Enjoyable,"Not sure what isn’t to like about The Dorchester. Incredible service throughout our stay from very thoughtful staff.
It’s been a while since our last stay, so the renovations were interesting to see, which as you would expect are well thought out.
The best part about our stay this time was the visit to The Grill by Tom Booton. Reluctantly tried it  as we couldn’t get into The Promenade. So glad we did as this was magnificent with outstanding fare and service. One little gripe, we failed to get into The Promenade as it was “fully booked” but then tried again in the evening as we used to enjoy sitting at the bar there, but again it was fully booked. On both occasions when we left both the Grill and the other bar later on The Promenade looked far from busy and so it appeared to me we could have been made welcome on both occasions. A little disappointing as we have enjoyed being in that area several times before.
Apart from that the service was as you’d expect, perfect in every other setting and you are made to feel welcome from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. We will be back, but please check on The promenade Mr Manager as they always used to seat us without a reservation yet it was hardly busy on Saturday when we tried and so it was disappointing we couldn’t sample what we have done on many occasions before.",5,2024,09,30
130,Exquisite,"This was a 60th birthday treat from my husband. Would have loved to be more dressed up, but weather and walking didnt allow! Oozes money - treated as good as any guest, but definitely an upper echelon.  How to see how the other half live! Enjoyed being pampered, staff all very welcoming and felt welcomed",5,2024,09,29
130,The Dorchester,"The Dorchester is quintessentially British hospitality at its best. There is simply nothing finer. Steeped in traditional old world charm along with its prime location looking in on Hyde Park makes this an ideal choice when visiting the capital. An experience in the spa is an absolute must. Expertly trained staff, superb products and the latest technology make this spa journey truly memorable. The sound vibration beds are simply extraordinary. My thanks to Sally Pedder and her team for restoring my inner peace.",5,2024,09,24
130,Anniversary made special ,"We have stayed here several times in recent years.it was just one night this time as we were at a matinee at the Palladium the staff made everything very special 
We were amazed to be upgraded from a junior suite to a vast Prestige Suite which is a wonderful room and so large with every facility you could want and a butler service
In the room was a bottle of champagne  cake and a loverly flower arrangement to recognise our special occasion
Breakfast was lovely as always with a vast choice available  all in all we had a lovely stay
Thanks to all involved with making our stay exceptional ",5,2024,09,14
130,Excellent can’t wait to go back,Excellent service from the whole team especially Sunali. Excellent Canepes and champagne in awesome surroundings. If was our 22nd wedding anniversary and it’s always a pleasure to come to this iconic hotel that makes an occasion extra special.,5,2024,09,12
130,Perfect hospitality,"This hotel cannot be reviewed in a few words! Everything from the check in to the flowers in the public spaces to the staff to the rooms.....excellence on every level! We were blown away by the way we were spoiled as we were celebrating a milestone birthday. The way that we were pampered and wished over and over again made it a 3 day celebration that felt like one amongst friends. 
The breakfast service is superb, the food and Green Juice as well as the Sunrise juice that was recommended are beyond description. There are so many small touches and gestures that make the Dorcester a place to return to again and again! Thank you teach and every staff member that made another stay at the Dorcester memorable and perfect!",5,2024,09,06
130,Super,"**5-Star Review for The Dorchester Hotel**

The Dorchester is much more than just a hotel: it’s an icon of luxury hospitality. The name itself is synonymous with excellence, and my recent experience only reinforced this. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by an elegant and refined atmosphere, where every detail is meticulously cared for.

The service is impeccable, with a staff that is attentive, courteous, and always ready to meet every need, making you feel pampered and important. Every request is met with speed and kindness, and nothing is left to chance.

The location, in the heart of London, is simply perfect: overlooking Hyde Park, The Dorchester offers a stunning view and an ideal position for those who want to explore the city while remaining in an oasis of tranquility and luxury.

The rooms are a true dream: tastefully decorated, spacious, and equipped with every comfort. The feeling of well-being is unmatched, and the attention to detail, from fine materials to the most advanced technology, makes every stay unforgettable.

The Dorchester is not just a hotel; it’s an experience of pure perfection. Highly recommended for those seeking the best in service, elegance, and comfort. A name, a guarantee.",5,2024,09,05
130,Afternoon tea my favourite place,"The Dorchester afternoon tea is the epitome of elegance. It is a luxury experience that all can enjoy. The staff skilfully put you at ease. It is a window in time which transports you to another world. No one leaves hungry. If your pleasure is sandwiches, scones or cakes … top ups offered and boxed up to take home if so desired, Of all the afternoon teas available; this is my fav because the food service and ambience all match equally with an apparent effortlessness.",5,2024,08,29
130,"Its the beat hotel in London, No doubt.","We stayed at The Dorchester for the first time, we are regular visitors to London and have tried many hotels, but this is by far the most luxurious and well run hotel we have stayed in.

We were so pleased to be able to stay in The Prestige Suite, Room 306. 
The views from all aspects were wonderful, the lounge area, the stunning bedroom and dining table where we were able to enjoy an evening meal and the Butler service really made our stay.
There is nothing you could wish for from a room or a hotel that The Dorchester did not deliver. The rooms are appointed to the highest level, the drinks cabinet worthy of a standalone bar, The Bed is like nothing we have every slept in. simply amazing.

We visited The Vesper Bar, which is stunning and makes the best cocktails.
And we dined in The Promenade, but when we return will be visiting one of the many other restaurants that looked great also.
 
A special mention to all of the staff, from the moment we pulled up in our taxi to the minute we left, we were made to feel like friends.
Veronica Evers, for arranging such a wonderful room.
Miguel who was was a delight, a genuinely warm character.
The entire front of house team, everyone was welcoming, friendly, and enhanced what is a stunning hotel.

Link all of this to a wonderful location, which allowed us an easy walk to our favourite shopping locations, we genuinely did not want to leave.",5,2024,08,15
130,$1400 was missing from my bag…,"I stayed in the Dorchester for 7 nights. I had a bag with cash, upon arrival at Dorchester I counted the money and put the bag under the table. Until the end of the trip, I didn’t touch this bag and didn’t take any money from it, only on the third day I put this small bag in another bag, which was also lying on the floor. when I left Dorchester for Cambridge, upon arrival in Cambridge I counted the money in the bag again and I was missing 1,400 dollars and 20,000 of my country’s currency in my bag. When my family asked me why I didn’t put the money in the safe, I was surprised because never in my life have I lost money in a hotel in any country in the world and I thought that Dorchester is a very decent hotel. Welcome to London…",1,2024,08,07
130,Afternoon Tea,"I visited for Afternoon Tea to celebrate my mother's birthday. Overall the experience was very good but, there is room for improvement. The sandwiches were delicious and clearly explained when placed on the table. The cakes and scones were equally as delicious. Most staff members and the waitress who served our table were very friendly. As a 5-star Hotel, I would have expected a greeting from one of the doormen/concierge members of staff. A greeting in the reception area would have also been nice and welcoming after not receiving one from the doormen but, instead, this took longer than should have and then directions were provided to us.",4,2024,08,04
130,Outstanding Bar Service by Jasha,"Best Bar Service by Jasha
What a lovely professional and amazing bartender 
She truly gave superb service & was very polite to converse with

130,Excellent Stay - as always,"Another excellent experience and stay at the Dorchester hotel.  All staff were amazing as ever, the spa staff, front desk and the butler.  We had a beautiful suite overlooking Hyde Park which really made our stay truly special. Special mention to the amazing Anuar, at breakfast who is just amazing, friendly and makes you feel so welcome and at ease, we look forward to seeing him again - Thank you again we can't wait to come back - The Beals",5,2024,07,31
130,Thanks again,"Amazing hotel, staff and a great location. Thank you for making the day/night a memorable one. Will definitely be returning. Also thank you to Angelo on front desk who tock the time to show us around the ball room. Mary in the Spa and Stefano, guest experience for making the bookings for us and the beautiful photo in a frame. All these little touches made it just perfect",5,2024,07,07
130,"Afternoon Tea - good, but not quite excellent.","We had afternoon tea on Tuesday 2nd July.

The ambience of the hotel and the food are excellent, with both the cakes and sandwiches being ""straightforward/simple"", but very well done. (We've had tea in other similar hotels and they almost try too hard and are too clever - ""strange"" sandwich fillings/bread, over complex cakes).  The staff get it just right, with a perfect mix of friendliness and service.

The only afternoon tea on offer is the Wimbledon tea (with English ""champagne"") at £125 plus service (so just over £140/head). The price is clearly stated on the menu, BUT this is way above other similar hotels which are around £100 plus service, and (to us) is starting to get out of reach/too high.

The teas (the hotels own afternoon tea blend) were (very) weak; but one of the waiters rescued the situation by making us a ""special"" blend, which echoed his home county of Yorkshire (""thank you"" for such good service""). Additional on the booking form we noted that it was our anniversary, but no reference was made to this (again, this is a small point, but they are a 5 star hotel !!) .

In most hotels our experience would be rated as ""excellent"", but this is one of the best hotels in London, if not in the world.",4,2024,07,03
130,Great afternoon tea meeting,"Well, amazing place for tea and/or my business meetings.
Food and drinks are always very good and overall service was pleasant.
I travel extensively so it is very difficult to please me but they did a good job. The choice of teas and cakes is always wonderful and the ambience is spectacular. I also am a huge fan of the restaurant with 5 star chefs.",4,2024,06,28
130,Perfection at its finest,"A historic grand hotel recently renewed where the level of the quality is almost incomparable.  Beautiful halls and rooms along with the kind professionalism of the staff.  Great and enjoyable stay. 
Every desire of the guests is satisfied in an admirable manner. 
Thank you for the excellent experience",5,2024,06,25
130,An amazing weekend,"What a wonderful weekend stay at The Dorchester.  The newly refurbished public areas are superb and matched by the bedrooms.  The staff whether at the front desk - thank you Annie - or at the Artist’s Bar, Vesper’s Bar or The Promenade were fantastic - they exemplify the meaning of service and going above and beyond.

A very special place and we will be back!",5,2024,06,16
130,Outstanding from start to finish,"We enjoyed an outstanding stay from
Start to finish. Staff are exceptionally professional and kind, they go above and beyond for all guests to ensure experiences are memorable.

We enjoyed High Tea and it was magnificent, the fluffiest and tastiest cakes we have ever been served.

Bedrooms are tastefully decorated and so comfortable, it is always a shame when we check out. Very much looking forward to our next visit",5,2024,06,02
130,Amazing Dorchester Stay,"The Dorchester is quite simply outstanding in every way.
The decor and the rooms are stunning and all of the public spaces are beautiful.
The staff are absolutely fantastic and can’t do enough to help.
The meals and dining were delicious and the service in the bars and restaurants was Impeccable!
They are all so friendly and the customer service experience is second to none.",5,2024,05,29
130,London's VERY BEST,"Wow... what a 'glow up' this beautiful old dame has had since we last stayed in 2017. We had booked a night in London here so we could give our new car a road trip and, as expected, the staff, property, and experience gave us memories we'll never forget.

We arrived early on a sunny Saturday morning, expecting to have to wait until we could check in. Not so... we parked right outside, walked in, and were greeted by the charming, wonderful front desk team who immediately checked us in and showed us to a brand new suite on the (brand new) fourth floor. Jonathan, the Front Desk Manager, seemed genuinely happy to welcome us back and upgraded our room to a beautiful park view suite, complementing us on the new car - just lovely.

Throughout our stay, the staff here were genuinely kind, interested, knowledgeable, and highly competent - without the fussiness of some other hotels (the new bar in the Promenade is incredible... and the team revelled in telling us their piano there was Liberace's... that made me buzz even more!)

A special mention goes to the doormen, Dave and Paul (I hope I have the names correct), who kept my partner's new car safe and sound on the forecourt all night, charged it, and made sure we had all of the essentials needed for our 2.5-hour journey back to the Midlands on Sunday.

How magical it was to check into a stunning suite just two weeks old and smelling of new wood, carpet, and finishes, while maintaining the almost century's worth of tradition of exquisite, personal service in the grandest of grand hotels in London.

We have a love of the Dorchester Group properties, having visited their Windsor sister (Coworth Park) just three weeks before and experiencing the same incredible service.

A stay here is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but one which I hope to repeat every year of my life. Thank you, The Dorchester.",5,2024,05,23
130,Simply perfection,"It was long thinking where to celebrate our anniversary, so we decided to visit The Dorch and I’m glad we did.
Every single thing we were served was perfect. From the tea being strong and full of flavour to the fluffiest cakes. 
Absolute perfection like you would expect in such high end class hotel.",5,2024,05,17
130,Wonderful High Tea experience!,"Wonderful hotel for High Tea. We took our daughter (13) to experience High Tea and it was truly delightful. The ambiance is elegant and traditional, the live piano makes the whole experience private and elevated and the tea and food was excellent.",5,2024,05,17
130,A Birthday Gift,"Amazing service from the moment we arrived, surrounded by a beautifully decorated interior; we had the pleasure of being taken care of by Anuar who served the Afternoon Tea, carefully directed our photos to capture the experience and made us laugh throughout. 

I had the best time celebrating my birthday here with my family thanks to the Dorchester team, huge thanks to Sophie too who also kept us smiling and was very helpful. I will definitely be visiting again!",5,2024,05,16
130,Best service in town.,"This hotel is just so so beautiful. We had a wonderful time here at the Promenade, what a beautiful place to have an Afternoon Tea. Delicious sandwiches, scones served warm and apricot jam was so nice but we thought they need to work on their pastries but a great service compensate for it. We were entertained, professionally by elegant Anuar, our server that afternoon. Our teacup was never empty as it was topped up regularly and we were offered a different tea to try too ! For what they charged as service charge in the bill, he’s worth it, what a fabulous experience. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",5,2024,05,11
130,Fab show rip off food stalls,"Fantastic day for all the family. 
Plenty to do especially with great music and fireworks and very well organised but rip off food , ice cream and drinks stalls. 
Next time I shall take my own food and drink rather than paying a lot for disappointing quality food and ice cream.",5,2024,05,05
130,Something to remember.,"We had Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester, there’s 5 of us to celebrate my mom’s birthday, food was good, sandwiches were freshly made as you can tell how soft the bread is, scones is just to die for and my favourite pastry is the coconut with pineapple jam, love it. Anuar our server made mom’s birthday celebration something to remember, he treat us like a family and he’s a class act and a lovely guy at the same tine and the best photographer too ! Thank you.",5,2024,05,04
130,The ultimate afternoon tea experience,"London isn't short of afternoon tea experiences. From fancy hotels to restaurants and cafes, there's plenty of choice if you want to treat yourself to a nice afternoon tea. Without question though, the afternoon tea offering at The Dorchester is one of the very best in London. Especially if you're celebrating a special occasion. 

I had visited the iconic 5-star London hotel for afternoon tea a few years previously. And, having enjoyed it so much, jumped at the opportunity to go back. On this occasion I was dining with my partner and two friends; in fact, the afternoon tea was to celebrate my partner's birthday. 

On arrival we were shown to our table in the delightful Promenade, which is a very inviting space in the lobby area of the hotel. You certainly feel like you are dining in one of the world's best hotels. The beautiful decor creates just the right ambiance to enhance the experience. And we spent the next couple of hours indulging in one of the best afternoon teas you can have anywhere in the world. 

So, let's talk about the food. The finger sandwiches were delicious. I have a sweet tooth, and it's not often I rave about a savory component. But believe me, these sandwiches were amazing! My favourite was the roast chicken, gem lettuce and lemon thyme mayonnaise on malt bread. The cucumber with dill and horseradish cream, and the egg mayo with mustard and cress were worthy joint runners up. The warm scones with jam and cream were divine, and the mini cakes and tartlets were a treat for our eyes as much as they were our palates. And the tea, of which they have an exceptional range, was plentiful. After all, what is afternoon tea without a good cuppa?! 

Of course, it's not just the food that stands out. The service from The Dorchester team was welcoming, friendly and efficient. We all felt very taken care of, and my partner received a hand written card and a little birthday cake too. These little touches were thoughtful, and made the occasion even more memorable. 

If you're after an afternoon tea experience that is pure indulgence, The Dorchester's offering is the one for you!",5,2024,05,01
130,Elegent service,"My partner was looking online on where to take me for an Afternoon Tea as a surprise treat for my birthday and Dorchester Hotel came on top and there’s a lot of review mention this server Anuar and we were lucky enough to get him as our server and it’s true enough he’s not the best, he’s truly is the greatest.

Arrived at the lobby and was guided to the Promenade where Afternoon tea is served, it’s a gorgeous opulent promenade, it’s just beautiful with amazing flower arrangements. Greeted by lovely hostess, was offered to keep our jackets to cloakroom and tag was given promptly a few moment  after we were seated.

Was greeted elegantly by Anuar and menu were explained well and he definitely know what he’s talking about and he knows champagne offerings in the Afternoon tea service very well and we decided to follow his suggestion with Laurent Perrier Rose Afternoon tea package.

Sandwiches was served shortly, duck egg was my favourite, the Dragon Well tea (was delicious) as suggested by Anuar was served just before scones and pastries were brought to the table but we loves the earl grey flavoured ice cream sorbet palette cleanser. Scones were devine, love the apricot jam but i’m sorry your pastries is just boring and tasteless …… and where’s the chocolate ……. is it too expensive ……. 

Candle lit birthday cake was presented and I was surprised and delighted.

Was thinking to rate the afternoon tea 4 stars because of the pastries but Anuar saves the day, he’s confident, elegant, stylish. We noticed that whatever he did, he just attracted attention from everyone in the room. He’s intelligent too, he can talked about anything, he’s like the Wikipedia, can talk about Bloomberg, forex, stock market, Cornish or Devon way scones, Taylor Swift, John F Kennedy, he’s so smart, a waiter who not only read The Economist, Fortune magazine but also Billboard and MTV.

Thank you the Dorchester for a memorable Afternoon tea and Anuar is just irreplaceable, he’s one of a kind, you won’t find someone like this everyday and keep up the good work.",5,2024,04,27
130,Decent afternoon tea but could use improvement,"We visited The Dorchester for a vegan afternoon tea in April 2024.  The setting was lovely but the food and service were a mixed bag.  The staff were extremely friendly but our teapot was placed on a serving table to the side so that only the server could reach it and our tea cups rarely re-filled.  We weren't offered the chance to change our tea selection until we asked and our tea was cold for most of the service.  We had an appointment two hours after our sitting and the pace of food delivery was so varied and slow we had to ask them to hurry up.  As a result we had large gaps in our service, followed by a rushed end.  We tried several vegan afternoon tea options during our time in London and The Dorchester offered the best savory sandwiches of the bunch but their dessert was very bad.  Overall, we preferred our tea experience at Brown's over the Dorchester.",4,2024,04,21
130,A splendid landmark is even better.,"I returned to The Dorchester after a five year absence and have concluded that this is the most beautiful hotel in London and one of the best in the world. The staff beginning with Madeleine at the front desk and Jeremy Dawson, the front office manager (who personally greeted me), could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. 
I was initially placed in a large executive room that had literally just been beautifully redecorated but it was terribly overheated due to under-functioning AC system. The very conscientious Madeleine offered me two upgrade options: a newly redecorated two room suite or a smaller deluxe Hyde Park view room with a door that opened unto a small balcony. I chose the latter and it was perfect for me: easy to cool off with the door open and exquisitely fitted out. (The bedding remains peerless.) 
It is rare to be someplace where literally everything a guest sees is beautiful but The Dorchester is such a place. Every one of the public spaces from glorious Promenade to the upper floor hallways to the elevator itself reward an aesthete's eye. I can think of no other hotel that deploys colors and pattern so well, bright in its public spaces, pastels in its bedrooms. 
My every interaction with the staff from the housemaids on up was friendly and gracious. I was made to feel very welcome indeed. I know of no better hotel in London. If you can afford it, it is worth every pound.",5,2024,04,14
130,Our First Visit But Not The Last,"Wow, where do we start to explain our Dorchester experience.

This was our first visit to the hotel the purpose was for afternoon tea. 

When we arrived at the hotel the entrance into the Promenade was a real wow. The welcome was very personal. We were seated in comfortable seating the table was impeccable set. We were described as VIP guests and that is how we felt throughout the afternoon.

The afternoon tea and ambience was excellent fresh sandwiches, scones and cakes served with endless fresh pots of fine tea. We are normal people but appreciate being spoilt and that was the case at The Dorchester. Too many staff names to remember all so pristine in their appearance with charm and professionalism to match.

Taylor the Promenade manager was very efficient making regular visits to our table to check everything was to our liking. 

A memorable day at The Dorchester, one that will be repeated in the near future.",5,2024,04,13
130,Dorchester event joy,Went to a charity event at The Dorchester and got exactly what we expected. The event ran beautifully and the food was incredible. The staff were a blur as they ran the well rehearsed plan to serve and feed an event room full of people. It was superb. The day was a sensational experience and we loved every minute.,4,2024,04,07
130,Red carpet treatment,"Customer red carpet treatment at its best. The food, service and atmosphere was amazing 

The hotel looks incredible since they started the refurbishment, it was my wife's birthday, she was treated so well, polite staff, wishing her a happy birthday with a cake at the end of the meal. 

It was a once in a lifetime, the lady playing the piano added to the wow factor 

Thank you",5,2024,03,23
130,A slice of heaven in London,Stayed at the Dorchester for a work event and loved every minute. Great location.. The newly renovated rooms make you feel like you are at home. The service is top notch. Bed was so comfortable. The hotel was very clean and loved the smell fo roses when walking into the lobby. I look forward to returning in the future.,5,2024,03,22
130,"Fantastic as always, brilliant weekend","It’s been a couple of years since we last stayed at The Dorchester, but it felt like yesterday as soon as we walked through the doors. 
The hotel itself has undergone major renovations since we last visited, but it is still The Dorchester! Literally everything has had a makeover and it looks amazing. 

We visited this time to kick off a milestone celebration, and once we were helped through the door, we were met by Michelle at reception who very kindly showed us to our room, which was lovely.  I can’t name every person who helped us, but everyone was so nice and helpful. 

I’ve said this before in other reviews, but I always feel it’s the people who work at a hotel that make the stay special, and literally, from the moment the doormen greet you, until you leave, every single person is there to make you feel welcome, and nothing is a problem. 

Dinner in The Grill and breakfast in The Promenade were amazing. The Vesper Bar is still the place to be for drinks, but honestly, you could spend forever at the hotel. Alas, our one night ended all too quickly, but we will be back and won’t leave it so long next time. 

Thank you everyone for making our weekend special, and for all the extra touches that were very thoughtfully put in place for us 
G & C",5,2024,02,26
130,"Great afternoon tea, inefficient booking process","Wonderful afternoon tea let down by a disorganised booking process.

I got a gift card for my partner for afternoon tea for Christmas, and on the 27th December we booked via phone for a visit in February. 

The morning of our visit, I called ahead as we’d not received any reminders of our booking, and my partner has some dietary requirements I wanted to check they were aware of. 
Upon calling I was informed that my booking had been cancelled by the hotel (with no notice or communication from them) as a result of them not having a card on file, despite the fact that the booking had been paid for in full on a gift card months in advance, which they held on file linked to the booking. We had had no correspondence on this or any request to share card details despite booking over the phone where we would have been able to do this.
I was initially told that they were too busy to honour our booking, but after a few minutes of clearly going away to work some things out - the staff managed to re-instate our booking, it was an overly stressful start to what should be a premium experience. Had we not have called ahead, it would have been very awkward to arrive for a booking only to be told they had cancelled it without informing us. 

The handling of bookings via gift cards is completely flawed, and needs reviewing to avoid this occurring in future. 

Once we arrived, the staff were superb, service was friendly and prompt and the afternoon tea was really enjoyable - it was honestly flawless if not for a completely insufficient level of care taken over their own bookings system which almost derailed our plans.",4,2024,02,24
130,Top notch champagne afternoon tea,"We had a champagne afternoon tea for my partner's birthday and they really pulled out all of the stops to make sure it was a very special day. A special shout out to Anwar who was very accommodating, and ensured we had a relaxing experience - we really appreciated their hospitality.",5,2024,02,24
130,Not infront of the guests please.,"We visited as a group of 3 on the 23/2/24 although the surroundings being opulent as we were leaving we overheard the management dressing down the doorman... not pleasant.
The raised voice and body language were more than apparent, not professional!",2,2024,02,23
130,Sisters First Visit,"Me and my sister visited a couple of weekends ago and had a couple of drinks at the artists bar. I visit often, but this was my sisters first experience. We had a great time as ever!

Staff had given us a few nibbles to enjoy whilst having our cocktails. It’s that kind of top rate service that brings me back time and time again! The only thing that was a bit off was that they forgot to bring over our tap waters and had to be reminded 30 minutes later. But it’s pretty good going if that’s the only thing I could find to complain about!

Such a lovely location to have a catch up with a loved one! Thank you for taking such good care of me… again!",5,2024,02,23
130,Beyond Expectation,"Every time we go to this hotel the staff and surroundings are world class , last night my wife and I popped in and were met by Simon and Jack in the Vesper bar , although not having been in a considerable amount of time their welcome was like Coming Home ! Service beyond expectation, if that is possible! Thank you so much . Kindest regards Marcus and Kathryn",5,2024,02,15
130,Flawless stay and food,"Absolutely flawless stay. 
Check-in was swift, the team took us to our room personally. The service was like that of royalty.
The rooms are newly refurbished, with the latest in tech, no need to bring international sockets.
I loved Vespa Bar and also we did breakfast in The Grill - wow those croissants with matcha filling. 
The most incredible stay in London. We'll be back",5,2024,02,15
130,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"We spent the weekend in London and I took my lovely wife to The Dorchester Hotel for afternoon tea as she has always wanted to experience a top class venue.

The moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff are amazing and highly professional.  They certainly know how to treat everyone with respect and are in our opinion the ultimate professionals in the hotel trade.

The afternoon tea simply delicious and amazing.  

The people watching was on another level.  

What a wonderful afternoon we had.

Highly recommended.",5,2024,02,08
130,Chinese New Year in the Ballroom,"I came for a dinner for 500 people in the ballroom for Chinese New Year. The place looked amazing and the dragon dance was really fun.

The food and wine were good, particularly the pudding. But what brought the whole quality of the Dorchester home to me was that it was jammed packed and bustling and people were everywhere and out of their seats, and the person next to me ordered a decaf coffee. I confess I had absolutely no confidence it was ever going to turn up. But, I’m happy to admit I was wrong and a few minutes later, there it was. This sounds like a small thing, but it’s not.",4,2024,02,07
130,Anuar knows great service,"Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester was lovely with a fabulous service.

I can’t fault anything from arrival until we leave, a warm welcome by the hostess, asked if we would like anything to be kept in the cloakroom and we did and was handed an envelope with a tag in it for pick up later.

Seated to a nice corner table with a full view of the Promenade, it is an amazing place to be in.

Promptly attended by Anuar, a charming waiter who knows how to treat a handbag as much as human :-) He understands what luxury is.

Food presented and explained well, sandwiches were tasty, scones is to die for but I don’t fancy the pastry much other than the mille feuille. Tea was topped up regularly and was offered a different choice of tea pairings during different courses.

Thank you to every staff member including the pianist and the culinary team at the Dorchester, you did very well indeed.

I would like to highlight the service by Anuar, he understood what luxury is, engaging without being intrusive, intelligent too and he provides an attentive and a great service. Anuar should be the ambassador of what luxury service is by the Dorchester.",5,2024,02,04
130,"Attentive, unpretentious, great fun!",We enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea to celebrate a significant life event. All the staff were gracious and attended to us with great care. We luxuriated over a bottle of champagne and shared a giggle with Anaur (who balanced humour and high service like the pro he is!). Thank you all for making an important day even more special. Memory for life.,5,2024,01,18
130,Elegance service by Anuar,"We love Afternoon Tea and my friend decided to bring me/return to the Dorchester for my birthday, we’ve been there many years ago as we also like to check out their just finished refurbishment of their lobby/Promenade and it looks fantastic.

It is not busy as the festive season is over and it’s dry January but not for us, we’re celebrating !

Arrived at the host, received a warm welcome and promptly seated to our table at a very nice corner and can hear the piano just at the back of our ear which is perfect .

Greeted by a charming waiter, Anuar. 

Sandwiches and scones were delicious although we missed the old Pastrami & Chicken Sandwich on Basil Bread as it’s the tastiest Afternoon Tea sandwich we ever had but we think the pastry lacks creativity and taste and too mousy, it’s just boring. Tea was hot, topped up frequently and refresh without the need to ask for it. The birthday card on the table was a nice touch and the birthday cake was a cute surprise.

I would like to highlight the star of the experience today, Anuar, his elegance charming way of engaging with the guest, the way he pour the champagne .….. plus he took a great pictures too ! He’s intelligent and never look at himself as a waiter and that’s what makes him great at what he does, he himself is a ‘brand’ ! What a great personality and a precious asset to the Dorchester.

We love the Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester and we’ll be back. Thank you.

p/s Can you bring back the Chicken Sandwich on Basil Bread …… ?",5,2024,01,17

130,A special festive afternoon tea,"We visit the Dorchester (our favourite hotel in London) each year to celebrate our anniversary over afternoon tea. 

The promenade was magical with all of the christmas decor and the choir. It was wonderful to be back and see the staff. The Artists’ Bar was blissful and the perfect place to sit and watch the world go over a cocktail. 

Afternoon tea in the promenade was exquisite. The chef did a great job at meeting my dietary requirements, as always. The cakes were beautifully presented and tasted good.

Our waiter Sandro was fabulous.Each small detail was well thought of.

A huge thank you to Monika Mazuruk (PA to Director F&B) for arranging our booking and taking on board all of our requirements to make our anniversary  extra special. Your efforts paid off and we had a wonderful time and can't wait to visit again soon. You were truly marvellous. We always make our reservation via Monika, as she goes above and beyond. 

We were also very well looked after by Berna Isik. Berna made numerous updates to our booking and she took it all in her stride. Berna made sure everything was perfect. 

Both Monika and Berna are wonderful, kind, courteous and personable employees who are an asset to the Dorchester hotel. 

Happy Christmas to you all.",5,2023,12,23

130,A dream come true,"I had the pleasure of getting married at the Dorchester last weekend; labelling it a special day would be an understatement.

Everything was taken care of meticulously, and I floated throughout the day without any stress. 

A special thank you to our events manager, Lauren, and our floor manager, Larissa - both of whose attention to detail and co-ordination was exceptional. The entire experience was flawless which meant my husband and I could really embrace each and every moment and enjoy every aspect of the celebration. The vision presented was executed to perfection, and all of guests are still talking about what a wonderful day it was.

I'd also like to thank Head Chef Mario and his team - Russell, Tim, Selwin & Nalaka. My husband and I wanted food & drink to play a prominent part of our celebration. Our customised menu was indeed a treat for all. Each course was balanced well, beautifully presented and most importantly, delicious.

To all the staff, we can't thank you enough - it was a truly unforgettable experience.

Would definitely go again and highly recommend ",5,2023,11,25
130,Afternoon tea,"I went for afternoon tea with my friend. I knew that it was more expensive than others but gave it a try as my friend loves  it there and says it is the best afternoon tea she has ever had.  I had high expectations which were unfortunately not met. First of all, the champagne took about 10 minutes to arrive and it was another few minutes before the sandwiches were served. A few more minutes went by and then the tea was finally served. The tea was not very warm and we had to ask for another pot. I have never had a luke warm pot of tea before. Again this took a few minutes to arrive. The sandwiches were nice enough but nothing special and the cakes were okay. The scones were alright. Having been to The Ritz and Fortnum and Mason, which are less than half the price, I would say that they are both far superior to The Dorchester. The service at both establishments was second to none and they were much more enjoyable experiences. At over £166 per head I expected far more. On the plus side, the actual ambience was nice and, as it is now the Christmas season, the carol singers were a lovely touch. ",2,2023,11,20
130,The ultimate in luxury-for those who appreciate the finer things in life.,"If you liked the ""old"" Dorchester you are going to love the newly renovated hotel.  She is prettier than ever and without a doubt the most glamorous hotel in London.  The rooms are exceptionally comfortable (the beds are heavenly) and the attention to detail of the staff is superb.  This is a grand hotel and you are expected to look the part.  Afterall, with new artwork of famous guests such as Queen Elizabeth II and Elizabeth Taylor looking down on you--you want to be in your best attire, with your shoes well shined.   At the Dorchester, no detail is overlooked and the word ""no"" is never heard.  When a button popped off my jacket at check in, the hotel seamstress had it sewn back on within minutes.  The concierge team are all magicians and every preference is noted and remembered.  If you are looking for unapologetic luxury and pampering, the Dorchester is your hotel.",5,2023,11,07
130,First Time Visiting The Dorchester…,"I honestly had the most wonderful experience at The Dorchester when I visited back in October! I found that all the staff were brilliant and very accommodating. The decor was fabulous as I’d expect for a five-star hotel and the food was excellent and I loved the cute little Coke bottles. There are a few special people who’d I’d like to shoutout. Firstly, Paul at concierge and I would also like to thank the kind lady at the restaurant front desk and our waitress for being so welcoming and accommodating to our needs! I’d definitely come back for afternoon tea ☕️",5,2023,11,03
130,Re : Outstanding Dorchester ,"I usually stayed at the Lanesborough when I goto London, a classical 5 star hotel with butler service that always guarantee me an outstanding stay. This time, I had a one night transit in London and decided to make use othis opportunity to try out out a new hotel that is also within Park Lane / Hyde Park area, the recently renovated Dorchester London. Several months ago while staying at the Lanesborough, I dropped by this place to have a drink and was wowed by the beautiful décor so I made a mental note to try. Just happened I had a one night transit in London so I decided to try. 

The Dorchester Collection is a group of luxury hotels that are located in some of the most prestigious cities. In London, they actually have two, the 45 Park Lane which I had tried before many years ago and the Dorchester London. 

Arrival 

Thankfully, my flight was right on time from Hamburg and I booked a hotel limo. Upon arrival, I was soon whisked away in an excellent and brand new Mercedes S Class. I arrived about an hour later in rainy weather and the bellhop was on hand with an unmbrella. 

Check-in was expected smooth as they have been expecting me. My booking was directly on the website with breakfast as the only benefit. I only booked a standard deluxe room. Their Guest Manager Mrs Katarina welcomed me to the hotel and I took this opportunity to request for a late check-out as my flight the following day is 10pm at night. I was expecting maybe they will give me one or two hours late checkout as I am only a first time guest and was very pleasantly surprised to be granted a late check-out until 6pm the following day. Perhaps me being a Lanesborough regular guest might have made them put in the extra effort to extend me a late checkout. 

Room

Mrs Katrarina personally showed me to my room, a renovated Deluxe room. Along the way, I noticed the entire hotel has been renovated, including the hallways and corridors. They managed to do this in stages without closing down or disturbing the guests which was quite a feat. Upon entering the room, there is a short foyer flanged by a very complete minibar housed in a gold tone cabinet. It’s slightly smaller than my usual junior suite but the room was sumptuously and gorgeously decorated. It simply screams luxury. There is a superbly comfortable King Size Bed, a small sofa sitting area, a work desk and a very large state of the art Bang & Olufsen TV. Very Very nice indeed. There is a window which looks to the backyard, no view.  A minus but not that important to me as I am only here for one night. 

The only area of this room I was not impressed with is the bathroom, not because it’s not as beautifully finished but it lacks the separate walk-in shower that I am so used to. The rainforest shower was directly above the bath tub and it’s quite a hassle to climb into the tub as it’s a very deep tub ( the hotel left a leaflet to proudly proclaim it’s the deepest tub in London ). The tower racks are heated and there’s dual sink. However, it’s actually my mistake for not telling the hotel my preference as later when I checked with the reception, they actually do have Deluxe room with walk in shower. The reception staff quickly offered to change the room for me but I declined as it’s only one night. 

The minibar is not complimentary but does very complete and the futuristic looking coffee machine makes really great coffee. There’s some additional water and fresh strawberries as a welcome gift along with a hand written note from the General Manager. Everything is spot on. And I need to compliment about the bed. It’s really one of the best I have ever slept in, right up there with the best of the best. I think only the beds at the Ritz Paris and De Crillion can compare. It’s a struggle to get out of this bed because it is so comfortable. 

Common Areas and Location

The hotel boast a wide variety of F&B outlets. There are 4 restaurants, the 3-Michelin Alain Ducasse, the all purpose dinning hall Promenade, a Chinese restaurant and the Grill by Tom Booton. In additional there are two bars and each restaurant also seems to have their own separate bar. 

I dinned at the Grill on my first night and I fondly recall the bartender ( Daniel from Italy ) made one of the best mojito in London so I seeked him out and he was very happy I remembered him. We chatted a while and I order a few selection of dishes. The service was excellent and attentive and the Managers and waiters took turn to check out on me. Despite dinning alone, I was given a large sofa table which is just great. The food was great too, the squid Bolognese stands out. The crispy pork dish however was way too salty. But I did not complained as I was in a good mood. After the meal, the Manager showed me their kitchen which also include a chef’s table. 

The following day, I woke up early and had breakfast at the Promenade. It’s quite possibly the most beautiful lobby restaurant I have ever tried. The sofas are sumptuous and comfortable, the décor posh and dare I said decadent. The cutlery and tea set all of extremely high quality. The breakfast was served ala carte from a menu and the menu is the largest I have seen in my travels comprising of every imaginable breaktfast goodie one can think of and it’s all you can eat. Marvelous! Everything is included including of course coffee, tea and juice but strangely water I was told is additional ( why? ). If I were 20 years younger, I would have tried at least 5 to 6 entrees but sadly, I was only able to tried their lobster burger, a near 100% perfectly done egg benedict and Belgium waffles, and some excellent bread and pasteries to go with it. This is really a spectacular 5-star breakfast. Dorchester London got the breakfast spot on. 

Other areas in the hotel include a small gym and a spa. I visited the gym for a short workout but it’s rather under equipped so I didn’t spent too much time there. I didn’t tried the spa. I took a peak at the Chinese restaurant and the décor is kind of dark and having dim sum in London sound a bit strange to me especially for dinner but perhaps I will try next time. 

I was hoping to try the Promenade for lunch again but its fully booked and seems the restaurant is always serving afternoon tea. 

The hotel location is at Park Lane but it’s quite a bit of walk ( 5 to 7 mins? ) from the nearest subway station and a good 15 mins walk to Harrods. However, it’s also walkable to Piccadily and Regent street. I would say the hotel location is central but not so convenient. 

Service

Service at the Dorchester was near perfect. Always warm, friendly and attentive. Staff will greet me when I walked by. They also jumped at the chance to help if there the opportunity present itself. Example was when I was asking a housekeeping staff to show me how to operate the coffee machine, I casually remarked there’s only 4 capsules for the coffee and 2 of them are decaffeinated which I didn’t drink. Immediately she bought 10 more capsules of coffee in a nice bag. Also when I raised the issue of the room not having a walk-in shower, I was immediately offered a room change, which I politely declined as I was only staying for one night. These are all hallmarks of attentive good service. However, they have noted this in my client preference and assured me in my next stay I will be assigned a room with a walk in shower. 

There’s only one hiccup where a cleaning lady enter my room right after pressing the door bell even though I had DND sign on but that’s a small issue. I only worked with the concierge to arrange my transportation and no additional request so I can’t comment if they are up to par with the excellent concierge at the Lanesborough. 

Before I left, I went to have another Mojito and chat with my favourite bartender at the Grill and he was excited to show me some of their rare collection of whiskys and gins in the bar. 

Overall, really nothing to fault. The same guest manager Mrs Katarina was also there to bid me farewell when I checked out. She curiously asked me how the Dorchester compared to Lanesborough and I chuckled as both are so excellent. Anyway, I am going to do a comparion below, just for fun. 

Comparison with Lanesborough

Rooms  :   Both are opulent, palatial, luxuriously decorated and sumptuously furnished in a classical manner, down to the last detail. The Dorchester holds the slight edge in terms of having more modern equipment ( nicer big TV ) but the Lanesborough has high ceiling and adorned with beautiful chandeliers in most rooms. I think it’s a 50/50 here. The bathroom Lanesborough is nicer but the bed at the Dorchester is more comfortable.

Common Area : The Dorchester having been recently renovated, are beautifully and immaculately furnished. It just screams luxury. The Lanesborough by nature is more reserved, understated although the main dining hall is just as beautiful, some of the common areas like the drawing room is getting a bit long in the tooth. Perhaps a quick renovation to touch up will be nice. The Dorchester wins here by sheer wow factor. 

F&B : I love the Grill at the Lanesborough as they got some really standout dishes. However, for breakfast, the Dorchester beats the Lanesborough hands down with an exquisite menu choice and some of the best breakfast goodies I have eaten in any hotels in my travel, and that is saying a a lot. Best of all, I can eat and order everything I want while the Lanesborough has a GBP45 limit or lesser depending on the package booked which by comparison seems “stingy”. Moreover, Dorchester offers more dinning option with more on site restaurants while Lanesborough basically only got one restaurant. Dorchester wins in this case. 

Location : The Dorchester is located at Park Lane, a prime district walkable to many attractions but then it is not like the Lanesborough where the London tube station is right in front of the hotel. The Lanesborough wins. 

Service : It’s probably not fair to compare them as I have stayed at the Lanesborough for ages and basically the staff. managers and everyone there already know my likes and preferences to a “T”. Moreover the Lanesborough’s concierge is always excellent and can work wonders including rising to the challenge of booking the most difficult to book restaurant in London, the CORE in my last stay. However, the Dorchester made a really admirable effect to match. The Lanesborough has another winning card though, the Butler service, which is available for all guests and caters to any request the guest may have including packing and unpacking service. So in this category, the Lanesborough wins, but it’s a “close fight”

Conclusion.

There you have it. My one night stay at the Dorchester is both memorable and wonderful, an excellent hotel right there among the very best in my decades of travel. It’s an excellent 5 out of 5. I can’t wait to return to experience more of the hotel which I couldn't in this one night stay. In fact, I already will. I have just booked 3 nights for April next year 😀

130,Memories are made from this,"This was a birthday celebration for my lovely wife. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. As you would expect from the Dorchester the service was impeccable, the surroundings opulent and the ambience just so relaxing. The sandwiches and the cakes were all faultless. The whole occasion was presided over by the charming Michele who, with his colleagues made it an afternoon to remember. Thanks to you all.",5,2023,10,18
130,Poor poor service and confused,"This review is by someone that simply wanted to buy spa vouchers as a gift. So I call ahead for 45 park lane spa. I am told you need to turn up to buy the voucher. On arriving I am told 45 park lane do not do vouchers. Then after double checking I am told I can actually buy the voucher - it does exist! but I can only buy it from the Dorchester that apparently own 45 park lane. So I go to the Dorchester and firstly I am greeted by a rather aggressive doorman that says “are you dining with us!” I said no I am trying to buy a voucher. So on entering two members of staff cannot help me as they don’t know where the spa is! They work there! Then a nice lady tries to help me but her work access card cannot open the door to the spa. So then I go back to reception to be told yes they can help me and they take me to the spa where the spa lady says “I am so sorry but I do not know why they told you that you can buy a 45 park lane spa voucher as you cannot unless you are in a room in that hotel. Utter waste of time. Why didn’t they tell me this when I phoned up in the first place. Only one lady at reception was helpful (a brunette that I think was relatively new) and the lady actually in the spa, at least she spoke with sense. Everyone else seemed lost, confused and disinterested. I used to frequent the Dorchester a lot between 2000 and 2015 and the service and atmosphere was top class, now no one has a clue. How do the employees not know where the spa is? Will never ever visit this “collection” again with the exception of the Beverly Hills one as they are class. Overall such a waste of my day. PS went to Bvlgari hotel instead where they helped me in 2 seconds flat. Top class outfit.",2,2023,10,17

130,A low blow. Stung at breakfast. ,"We went for breakfast to begin celebrating a friends 60th birthday. 
The surroundings are the height of sophistication. 
The food was ok but I have cooked better myself. Although we were happy to pay over the odds for food that didn’t match up to the beautiful surroundings, the stinger was that we were charged £80 on top of breakfast for tea and coffee. The breakfast menu was not explained to us when we were seated and it should have been made very explicit that each refill of tea and coffee is chargeable. 
We work in the NHS, don’t have loads of spare cash and never would have politely accepted offers of refills had we known this was the case. 
It certainly tainted our experience of the Dorchester and we felt taken advantage of. Poor show! ",4,2023,10,09

As I went outside the staff said, remember you have a bill to settle. Like I was dinning and dashing. That is rude not 5 star. It’s kind of ruined my evening as if the staff remembered me they would know I’ve spent many memories and a lot of money here.. but I guess they’ve just judged me as I’ve come today more casually. to be told that as I popped out, after I let them no was going outside.. where has the trust for loyal customers gone? disrespectful. I’ve been coming here for so many years and gone outside and there was only respect by staff but tonight they made me feel like I was trying to steal. I don’t like that.

The sandwiches were a good mix of fillings and the cakes were delicious. I love the tradition of scones & tea and this was my favourite part.

I didn't expect to take out a second mortgage to get a drink.
Because we ordered a beer (£10 for a small bottle) and 3 coffee's, the rule is if your a non resident we would have to pay £33pp for the privilege of having a hot drink (the beer was fine) but the waitress had a ""word"" with the manager and he wavered it.
If he hadn't we would have just walked out but even so it cost £42.55 for it including 15% service charge.

We were seated over 45 minutes later and although expressed concern having waited so long when we were seated at the table we were not given menus for sometime and pushed to order as we were hungry.  It was an hour from when we arrived that our tea came . I have been to many high teas in london . They had no tea menu , the sandwiches just served on a little plate  the scones were not warm and sweet deserts were awful .  We had to keep asking to fill our tea and water as they don’t leave the pots on the table . The children’s plate was just ok but not £50 worth . Overall for a £100 a head would not go back was expecting better service and quality for such a prestigious location ,",2,2023,08,06
130,Afternoon tea at the Dorchester,We went to have afternoon tea in the dorchester hotel for the first time and after thing was a 10/10. Really recommend you experience it if you are coming to London. Our waiter Anuar made our experience even better and we enjoyed every minute ,5,2023,08,03
130,Amazing customer service from Anuar,"I recently visited on the 22/7/23 for a business meeting and was hosted by Anuar for afternoon tea. He made mine and my guests experience that afternoon. Very friendly, funny and hospitable. I’ve been many times to the Promenade but on this occasion due to the waiter, it was by far the best visit. I’ll be returning and asking for Anuar to host me and guests only going forward!! Thank you!",5,2023,07,25
130,"Food amazing, missing property 😞","Afternoon tea for our friends 50th birthday. Service by Channah was above and beyond. Such a kind, welcoming and friendly person. 
The service, food and tea was perfect however sadly, when collecting our jackets from the cloakroom my brand new storm proof umbrella was missing. After 20 minutes this wasn’t located.  We were given an umbrella which turned inside out and broke immediately leaving us drenched walking to the underground station. Really disappointing after a really lovely afternoon tea.

130,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,Absolutely wonderful! We recently stayed for our 2nd anniversary and my partner Marco and I were enthralled. Nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful team! The hotel is the best in London! Everything was perfect! Thank you all so much. The upgrade to the Stanhope suite was so appreciated!,5,2023,07,11
130,Afternoon tea at the dorchester,I went with the family for afternoon tea and we had a wonderful experience. The food was perfection and our server Anwar was simply delightful. I definitely recommend an experience to anyone who has not tried yet.,5,2023,06,28
130,Beautiful tea room and delicious food but the service was disappointing,"Went to the Dorchester for tea today.  The room was beautiful and food delicious but the service was substandard. Our table was not ready, the service was very slow, the waitress let our tea get stewed and then was surprised when we asked for another pot. After 90 minutes we'd only received our sandwiches, our scones and cakes hadn't arrived. Even after nearly three hours we hadn't got our bill - the waitress had just disappeared. We had to ask another for our bill. We were not pleased to see that the tip of 15% was compulsory and the extra pot of tea was an extra £20.  Not what you expect when you are paying almost £100 per head.  Dorchester, you need to train your staff better. 
",3,2023,06,27
130,Get It On,"If you would like to know what the meaning of service is, come to the Dorchester. As a regular visitor for over twenty years, I'm working class but I save like mad to be able to have a taste of what it is to be enveloped in quality and finesse for just a short time.

Our 17th wedding anniversary (we were married here in 2006.....Penthouse and Pavilion, eighth floor) in the Vesper Bar followed by dinner in the Grill room. Par excellence. 

Great service, food and wine. No corners cut here. Prepare to be amazed. 

I've been used to classical music gently breezing by in the Grill but on hearing T-Rex's 'Get it On' I realised time has indeed moved on and truly the Dorchester Grill really did 'get it on!'

Go there, you won't be disappointed.

Cheers

130,A little disappointing as was expecting a new room....,"I booked the hotel after reading about the huge Reno they just had... but silly me I did not request a new room!
We arrive late at night and the hotel is huge, I was not expecting it to be so large so after going down a long hallway we found our room and it did not look new but was in great shape. But dull dark colors, it had a hallway and large bathroom and the room was spacious, comfortable bed sheets and a bear and cookies and cakes for my daughter. As we travel a lot the small welcome touches really help hotels win for us. 
We woke very early the next day and had to wait until 7.30 to get any breakfast which did shock me given the price point of the hotel, we sat in a beautiful room with lovely flowers but the coffee took 11 minutes which I found very odd as no one else was there. Service not particularly attentive either. 
On checking out I asked and was told only one floor of rooms had been re done so far and they are going little by little, given how many rooms they have I would say it will be some time.",3,2023,06,24
130,Great first time experience of high tea!,"Enjoyed high tea at the Dorchester !!
Our waiter/Attendant ANUAR was excellent!! He was so attentive, Friendly and courteous and professional! 
He let us try each others tea !! Thank you ANUAR you made our high tea experience unforgettable!! Thank for being so kind to us !!",5,2023,05,28
130,Stunning hotel & fabulous service,"24 hours in this beautiful hotel - wish we could have stayed longer. 
Sam on reception checked us in and showed us to our gorgeous room. He was super friendly and showed us everything we needed to know. 
The coronation afternoon tea was delicious and the promenade was such a stunning setting to dine. 
In the evening we ate bar snacks in Vesper along with some delicious cocktails before retiring to the comfiest bed! 
The Dorchester did not disappoint and we will definitely return thank you.",5,2023,05,24
130,The best of the best,"I arrived on the 10th of May alone for a city break. What an amazing place. I stayed in a luxury room that was the best room I have ever been in London, so far. Old and modern style deciration with great quality furniture and bedding. 
I have to highlight a few members of staff. 
Rossana front front desk was exceptional on giving me all support during my stay. 
Tan from breakfast is a star. Her professionalism is the best in the world of F&B  personnel she was a personal touch for detail. 
Rejane from spa at 45 Park Lane is just the best in guest care, and she is a raising star. 
David from the Grill is just incredible. What a huge accept to this amazing restaurant! Young, vibrant, enthusiastic , and full of positive energy. Everything you want in a place like The Grill. 
The hotel is doing a refresh on their decoration. I am so looking forward to seeing it. For sure, a place to go every time you need a place to stay in London. I use these days to have some friends coming to visit me. They absolutely loved it. I am going to be very honest with you guys. I haven't gone out of the hotel for 3 days it was great. I felt like home. ",5,2023,05,13
130,Very rude Female Staff ,"A very very rude Italian female staff asked my mother and me to move away very rudely from near a table as we were simply taking some pictures ! 

She gave us no time at all and kept repeating she needed that table immediately treating us with disrespect .

Please improve your staff training ! Thanks ",1,2023,04,27
130,My Experience at the Dorchester Breakfast,"The second time at the Dorchester London, with my family.
Hotel looks nice,the breakfast hall is amazing,recently renovated, but the service is absolutely terrible.
We waited for over an hour for the food,having three kids,including one toddler,at the table.
After asking about the food several times, it  finally arrived, very late indeed. Moreover, it was missing a lot of what we asked for and the waiter had mixed up our orders. 
Of course,after complaining to the manager everything was perfect.
Considering that The Dorchester is a renowned hotel this shouldn’t happen under any circumstances.",3,2023,04,22
130,Scammers,"The nightmare doesn't end. I visited The Dorchester back in early April which I wrote a review about, it was a horrible experience. After emailing the hotel a few times I was finally told I would receive a refund (which I am still waiting for) A few weeks have passed since I had been there and I began to notice attempted charges being made on my card on two separate occasions. Imagine my surprise when I was told they were both made by The Dorchester! This was not a mere £30 being taken but close to £700, twice! I had paid my bill which was clearly approved and seen on the day of my afternoon tea. It seems very suspect that they would wait a few weeks before trying to change my card again. It makes me wonder how many people they have actually managed to scam who might not have noticed the charges being made to their cards. This is completely unbelievable! ",1,2023,04,15
130,An exquisite afternoon tea,"Our first visit since the renovation project what a marvellous colour scheme, absolutely beautiful. The cake shop on the side of the hotel also looked delightful and it was like entering a magical cake shop from a movie! 

The promenade was magical with all of the new decor. It was wonderful to be back and see the staff. The Artists Bar was blissful and the perfect place to sit and watch the world go over a glass of champagne. 

Afternoon tea in the promenade was exquisite. The chef did a great job at meeting my dietary requirements, as always. The cakes were beautifully presented and tasted good. We loved the pale pink china matching the colour scheme of the hotel. 

Our two waiters Anwar and Harry were fabulous. Anwar is very experienced and goes above and beyond for clients. It was Harry’s first week and we can see him doing well in his career. A good hearted young man and who better than Anwar to guide him in the promenade - we all have to learn somewhere and Harry can learn from one of the best waiters! 

Each small detail was well thought of. 

Thank you to Monika Mazuruk (PA to Director F&B) for making our booking and taking on board all of our requirements to make my partners Birthday extra special. Your efforts paid off and we had a wonderful time and can’t wait to visit again for Christmas. You were marvellous.",5,2023,04,11
130,Birthday Breakfast,I took my mum to The Dorchester for breakfast on her birthday and it was perfect. Anuar made everything so special and we had a brilliant time. It was recently been renovated so the decor was immaculate. I would highly recommend going for breakfast here.,5,2023,04,08
130,A Disappointing Visit to a once Family Favourite Venue.......,"The Dorchester was our absolute favourite place to visit for Lunch, Evening meal, Afternoon Tea or indeed just to celebrate a Birthday. There was something very special about the atmosphere, the people, the décor and indeed The Dorchester for what it represents............ That was before the the revamp and it being closed for around 2 years or so. When it opened we very hurriedly took advantage of the slot for afternoon tea  Feb. 14. We were so excited the place looked absolutely amazing...but at a cost! First and foremost the staff were well below what we were used to. The old faces were gone and fresh faces did not meet up to expectation...very slow service, no attention to detail, tired, no eye contact and positively inexperienced! Shame. The sandwiches were not particularly fantastic and when we ordered a top up we were informed that they don't top up sandwiches but they would bring a plate out of courtesy.....So we were presented with a plate of only 6 finger sandwiches!!! The scones were small, dry and no where near what we were used to prior to the revamp of the place. Overall the the Afternoon tea was a washout . I would rate it the following if it helps Management to improve;
1. Cost 3/10, 2. Quality of Service 2/10, Decor 8/10, 4. Presentation 5/10, 5. Value 2/10,       
 6. Comfort 8/10
As a family we absolutely love The Dorchester but its is with a heavy heart that I write this review. If anything  I hope it will help Management improve on the negative aspects mentioned. We await the day The Dorchester again becomes the place we are so accustomed to and eagerly await to visit. ",2,2023,04,07
130,"Hotel‘s staff are absolutely phenomenal, especially Anwar at the breakfast area.. he made  every breakfast exceptional","Staff are absolutely wonderful. For instance, Anwar serving us at breakfast could always make us laugh yet give us the best dining experience. He truly made my vacation worth remembering. He made sure we got all we need at breakfast.. the small details makes me come back to the dorchester every time.. thank you Anwar",5,2023,04,03
130,Great as always,"This hotel continually goes above and beyond expectations.
We are always greeted with a warm friendly service and the staff ho out of their way to help you.
The new re furbishment on the ground floor and entrance has given the place a refreshing lift, we popped into the new flower and chocolate shop on our way to the vespa  bar. 

",5,2023,03,29
130,What has happened to The Dorchester Afternoon Tea?,"Valentines Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester was simply awful and at £232 ... absolute daylight robbery! I have had Afternoon tea on 5 occasions (£55-65 pp) and i assume the increased price was for the single rose given to the lady? 
Firstly the sandwiches: there are 6 finger sandwiches each and when you ask for more (after sitting waiting for an hour) they arrive half hour later with a paltry plate of 6 sandwiches so you can fight with your Valentine over which 3 sandwiches you get!!!!
The scones were acceptable but a tad dry and the tiny pot of clotted cream for two to share was unacceptable. 
Please take my advice.... when 2 customers come for Afternoon Tea at £232:
... do NOT sit them down and offer their first serving an hour later
... do NOT wait for them to ask for more sandwiches...try offering them instead
... once you do bring sandwiches, do NOT give them 1 portion to halve between them
... do NOT give 4 small scones with 1 tiny pot of clotted cream.

I do NOT recommend anyone to visit The Dorchester for Afternoon Tea anymore. The refurbishments may have improved the surroundings but the level of service and quality/quantity of the Afternoon Tea has very much decreased. 
 
 ",1,2023,03,21
130,"Afternoon Tea in the Promenade - great chef, poor experience.","Certainly one of the more expensive afternoon tea's in London, and the quality of the food matches the prices. There is no question that this is high class work from the Dorchester kitchens.  
Honestly, I suspect the challenge is that when you expect the best, and don't quite get that, the result is disappointment.  I also think the seating is not great, as we were sat at a quartered sofa in the central section - which unfortunately faced us looking at the till, and tow exit doors.  The staff we polite but ...while you never want too much service, but better too much than having to constantly try and grab their attention.  By the time we left I was simply fed up with bending my neck and trying to grab someones attention. 
The room at 2pm felt more like the Institute of Directors, with international business people in conversation over coffee, and the Promenade living up to its name with a procession of other business people passing by our table to go to a meeting in a room just off the far end of the room.  All the more frustrating to then watch one particular member of staff literally run across the room to serve a business man he obviously knows well - and ignore us again in transit.   
So while the food is quality no doubt.  It is just not the place I would recommend for a couple coming into town from the country, looking for an exceptional experience of afternoon tea. 
May be it is just not the place for folk who see £90 a head for afternoon tea as an indicator of a life event to be remembered.",3,2023,03,12
130,FABULOUS DORCHESTER ,"A return visit meeting friends for lunch at The Grill, followed by drinks in the newly renovated Promenade 

My friends are Dorchester regulars and are well known with all the Grill staff
Made to feel very welcome,  just the best food paired with informal but attentive, friendly service

Exquisite lunch, everything is truly 5*

Fabulous surroundings just add to the Dorchester experience 

After lunch, we were taken to a lovely table to continue with post lunch drinks and savour the wonderful ambience of the promenade,  listening to the excellent pianist 

Thank you to everyone for looking after us all so well and making our Dorchester visit simply FABULOUS. ",5,2023,03,05
130,Almost perfect,"Although we received a fairly good welcome, some other Hotels in this area offer their guests a Welcome Drink when arriving, but other than that our stay was pleasant, Restaurant and Bar Staff were also very friendly and helpful. We may be back some other time.",4,2023,03,03
130,3 venues in one day!,"Cocktails in the Artists Bar, lunch in 'The Grill' and post lunch drinks in the Vesper Bar.
All three venue renovations absolutely beautiful! This is The Dorchester at it's VERY best.
Wonderful atmosphere, extremely good customer service and a day surrounded by amazing luxury!
Exquisite cocktails, excellent food and venues amongst the best social places in London.
My wife and I have stayed at The Dorchester many times in years gone by, always loved the hotel and the history. This was in the days when Ted was the Head Doorman. An amazing guy who knew just about everything about the hotel and who he hadn't met weren't worth knowing!
Since then with travel abroad and covid, this was out first visit to this wonderful hotel for sometime. We were not disappointed and as a result of this visit we are planning a further visit to stay in the spring.
The Dorchester always felt like home years ago....and it still does. Once all the rooms and suites are also renovated it will once again confirm it's place as one of the worlds finest hotels!",5,2023,02,21
130,"Post renovation - didn't think it was possible, but beautifully renovated without losing character","The beautifully renovated Dorchester Hotel lobby & Promenade - does not disappoint (although the official website photos don't do it justice). Thought yet another renovation of a 5 star historic hotel, where they strip it of all charm and character for a generic modernist feel. Not here. Thank goodness!! The main staples - beautiful flower arrangements, central table and three row arrangement are intact, but subtlely lifted with slighter brighter pinker hues from the jade/green tone. The floors - beautifully carpeted, although with some marble sections in between (ladies - watch out!! can get a bit slippery). Service - same - impeccable, but, newer uniforms - like the cream jackets for men, the navy for women. Still the cozy feel. The menu has changed. They no longer offer the combined English Breakfast with juice, coffee, etc. The muesli bircher has also sadly changed (used to be the best - this one is a bit simpler, although still smooth, and comes with fresh berries).",5,2023,02,14
130,Wonderful weekend stay (birthday + anniversary),"We had a wonderful stay for two nights, and the experience was perfect from beginning to end. This was a special birthday / anniversary and the staff took care to make sure that everything was perfect. We got surprise champagne for the birthday, and then chocolate covered strawberries for the anniversary. The staff was accommodating of our late checkout request, and all in all this was an experience we will always remember. Thank you to the staff for making this so special for us, and to Alex Lee and his team in particular for the arrangements. This was our first visit, but we will be returning to the Dorchester in the future for any special occasion that calls for celebration.",5,2023,02,12

l enjoyed one of the best lunches I’ve had in a while.
The ethos of this beautiful place and it's staff unchanged by time.

130,Afternoon Tea,"Another lovely expierence in The Orchid Room. Attentive service and friendly staff from start to finish. 

We had the afternoon tea with the non alcoholic drink which was really enjoyable and refreshing. 

Wonderful fresh sandwiches and scones. We had to take the cakes away as simply couldnt finish them all. ",5,2022,12,21
130,Consistently Wonderful,"It’s a family tradition to spend a Christmas weekend in London and the Dorchester wins hands down for location, excellent customer service, beautiful rooms, lovely bar & great restaurants.

Immediately opposite Winter Wonderland, a short walk through the park to Knightsbridge & Chelsea & only moments from Mayfair & Theatreland.  

When working in media, this was our hotel of choice to put up our VIP guests.  Absolutely ticks all of the boxes.

If I had to choose a hotel to live in, would always be this one.  Come away feeling relaxed & spoiled.",5,2022,12,15
130,Perfect anniversary lunch,"What an experience. Many years ago I enjoyed one of the best times in my life at this hotel and this experience was exactly the same. The ethos of this beautiful place and it’s staff unchanged by time. I celebrated an anniversary lunch with my husband, two daughters and their partners. From the arrival , to the staff in the roof top bar to the excellent care and attention in the Grill room, this is what making dream memories are made of. The food, outstanding. A perfect lunch, thank you so much. We will return to eat for sure but we will also return to stay for our 30 wedding anniversary and I can’t wait !",5,2022,11,25
130,Perfection  at its best,"You can travel the world, they rate themselves 5 stars nothing compares to the standards of English hotels and hospitality. Grew up coming here with my parents and every time I come I know I’m at the best. 

Excellent standard and service, again thank you. World class.",5,2022,11,21
130,A memorable 30th wedding anniversary. Thank you Dorchester!,"An amazing stay. It was our 30th wedding anniversary. We were upgraded from our “basic” double room to the Mayfair suite. On our arrival we were treated to celebratory balloons, a fruit bowl, personalised chocolate, a free bottle of champagne and a special gift (which turned out to be pillow case embroidered with our names). The suite was huge. As well as a large bedroom with dressing room attached, there was a large living / dining room, two bathrooms and no less than three mini bars. Some upgrade! 

We had booked a one hour a slot at the spa at 45 Park Lane across the road  as the Dorchester spa was closed as part of the renovations.  Is felt like an upgrade as 45 Park Lane has a great swimming pool as well as a sauna, steamroll and jacuzzi. Our host offered us a free glass of champagne (this was becoming a habit we were getting used to). We stayed for almost two hours and were the only guests there (they restrict the guest numbers but being alone was unusual as I think everyone else was having spa treatments). It felt like we owned the place! 

On leaving I later realised I’d left my swimming trunks in the changing room. One phone call and it was delivered to my room later. Such great service. 

We ate at china tang. I’m disabled and the internal lift to the back entrance wasn’t available. Also it was raining. So we were offered the use of the Dorchester car to take us. There was a 5 minute delay so we were sat down and offered free champagne for the inconvenience! Only time in my life I refused this offer. We felt like royalty being driven such a short distance (just round the block really). The food was great (I’ll write a separate review). On our return we went to the top floor bar for a drink; a cold cheese and meat platter was waiting in our room on our return, I think because we were “inconvenienced” by the taxi delay. I have to say I have never been LESS inconvenienced in a hotel, but took the gift nonetheless in the spirit it was given. 

Next day we had an amazing breakfast in the Orchid room and chilled in our suite till we checked out at 12 (had to get the best use of all that space). 

What to say. A once in a lifetime experience that we might want to repeat! I have never  had such personal service in a hotel before. Everybody knew our names and that it was our anniversary. 

The elephant in the room of course is the renovation work which is still ongoing and very evident. Many of the grand areas you expect to see at the Dorchester were not open and strategically placed curtains hid ongoing building work. We were never disturbed by any noise though. Also, I think this worked in our favour. I suspect there were fewer guests than usual and so we got a better upgrade and even better service than we might otherwise have received. I think the best way to view going to the Dorchester at present is as a “boutique” rather than a “grand” 5 star hotel. The rooms are great and - even if there is less communal space - the service is very personal. You feel special and cared for. Of course even our pre upgrade room cost more than I have ever paid for a hotel room. But  my wife and I relaxed instantly and the one night we spent there was equivalent in great memories to a week anywhere else. So if you can afford it, go!

And thank you once again to all the staff who made our visit so memorable!",5,2022,11,20
130,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"The only sad thing was we walked past the hotel at first, because it is covered in scaffolding! But once there the staff were impeccable.  We were treated like royalty and led into the glorious Orchid Room.  A lady was in the corner from us playing the piano and the ornate room was filled with gorgeous flowers.  The young lady who was our main server was lovely.  She was always there to assist and advise and was cheerful and friendly (as were all the staff we encountered).  The Champagne Tea was a 70th Birthday gift and was wonderful.  The sandwiches were all delicious, as were the lemon curd and scones.  As we left the lovely young lady gave me a box with a tiny strawberry & chocolate delice birthday cake inside - I was very chuffed - a wonderful afternoon thanks Dorchester.",5,2022,11,16
130,Another wonderful stay in our favourite hotel ,"Stayed for 3 nights in an upgraded suite
The suite is so large yet so like home with a separate sitting room as well as the bedroom and a hall too the bathroom
Despite the renovations in the public areas the staff were brilliant and we felt very comfortable in the Orchid room which is been used for breakfast and lunch
All in all a wonderful stay with no inconvenience caused by the works
We look forward to returning next year when the Promenade and New bar are up and running ",5,2022,11,13
130,A Lovely Stay. Thank you Dorchester.,"We recently enjoyed a three night stay at this wonderful hotel.  We encountered the highest standards of hospitality across all departments throughout our visit . We would like to mention Jake and Barry who make superb old fashioned cocktails in the Rooftop Bar which has great views of the London skyline. We would also like to thank Emmanuel for his wonderful welcome and for escorting us personally to the superb inhouse China Tang restaurant which was another great experience for us. Thank you to everyone at the Dorchester for looking after us so well, and good luck with the rest of the phased renovation which did not affect us in the least. Thanks also to Maria for helping us with our booking. We look forward to  returning in the future.

130,Fantastic experience,"First time in London, could not have been more impressed with the accommodations even during renovations. The staff from the Concierge Nikolai to the staff in the grill room and everyone in the main restaurant was extremely friendly, professional and personable it made my husband and I so very happy for our first holiday in the UK would come back again five star review thank you everyone at the Dorchester ",5,2022,10,26
130,"The Dorchester roof top, not great value for a vegan","The view from the roof top was excellent but the meal could have been at the local pub and the staff whilst friendly were not trained.  I am a vegan and had checked before that they could cater for vegans, not exactly a rarity these days. I had they only ‘choice’ humour and crudités followed by ‘wild’ mushroom risotto. 

The staff didn’t know which dishes were vegan, normally one expects them to be marked. And when they had to send out to another restaurant for vegan humous (how can it not be) it sounded like they had done us an enormous favour.  

I would not have minded at a normal bistro but at £304.75 (£87 on alcohol) I was not impressed.",2,2022,09,25
130,Amazing stay and breakfast in The Orchid Room,"My family and I spent the most memorable weekend at this beautiful hotel that is steeped in history. Although it is currently undergoing renovations to the front of the building, you wouldn’t know once you enter. Every member of staff couldn’t have been more attentive. The Dorchester has a wonderfully warm feel to it with amazing attention to detail. Every part of the experience at this beautiful hotel only ever exceeded our expectations. Among the many highlights were the magnificent spacious bedrooms with every facility we wanted, wonderful and delicious food options and the hotel’s location opposite Hyde Park. My family and I especially enjoyed eating  breakfast in the Orchid Room. Our waiter Michele went above and beyond, he is a credit to the hotel. The food was outstanding with perfect portion sizes.  However, by far the best part about The Dorchester is it’s staff, every single team member we met was ready with a smile and to help in any way they could. We cannot wait to stay again when we visit for afternoon tea and to see the hotel after the renovations. ",5,2022,09,13
130,Nice British afternoon tea,"On arrival we were disappointed to find that the front of the hotel was under construction and so we went in the back door with none of the grand entrance. The hotel should have informed us before booking as we would have changed the day had we known. The service of the afternoon tea was very good and the food was nice. Sandwiches were all fresh and you could have ordered many more. The vegetarian selection was also good. The scones were nice but very small and sadly not warm, however the lemon curd was delicious. The cakes were all fairly nice but nothing too special. The piano player was great and the overall atmosphere was nice however I feel like standards were not upheld as they should be with many people turning up in trainers and shorts. Overall nice afternoon tea but not the best in London.",4,2022,09,03
130,Afternoon Tea - wonderful,8 of us (3 generations) had afternoon tea for my daughters 16th birthday. What a wonderful afternoon and evening! Everything was amazing from champagne and tea (try the vanilla!) to the food and ambience. Megan (our waitress was lovely and really made it all that much better). Pianist also superb (we had to stop ourselves singing!) and the lady who greeted us at inception helped make it all perfect. Couldn’t recommend more strongly as a treat.,5,2022,07,29
130,Afternoon Tea for birthday @ Orchid room,"We travelled all the way to this hotel to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday and when we arrived, we were greeted with friendly staff and were escorted to our table. There was selection of different blends of tea on the menu. We tried some blends of tea along with the scones, variety of sandwiches and pastries. We were given a full description of each item and what it contained. Everything was very tasty.
The room was extremely clean with a lot of decor. The ambience was very good and relaxed.",5,2022,07,12
130,"Just Royal Ascot Afternoon Tea @ ORCHID ROOM, (not a stay at the hotel(. ","I've been wanting to have Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester Hotel for a good while. The reputation of the Afternoon Tea at this famous London hotel precedes it. This is one of those institutions that I don't think you can just walk into. You need to make a reservation well ahead of time, so I made sure I booked it online; (a very simple procedure I might add). I was so excited to tick it off my bucket list of things-to-do in London! 👏🏼 At The Dorchester, Afternoon Tea 'happens' at Orchid Room. The Orchid Room is a breathtakingly beautiful restaurant! 😍 It was classically and ornately decorated, with a very regal and sophisticated flair to it; (refer to my posted pictures of the interior). I read that it was inspired by Josiah Wedgwood's 'Jasper' Fine China shade of Pastel Blue. Orchid Room is truly an incredible sight to behold, what with those pastel colours and pretty floral arrangements! They seem to have a resident Pianist who played some of the latest hits; so, so cool! 🎹

I was slightly late for my booking, so I called to inform them, and they were very understanding and pleasant about it. Upon arrival, I was seated and served by KEVIN. Impeccably dressed Kevin was awesome; so polite and professional. Orchid Room has 3 sets/kinds of Afternoon Tea, (based on the menu presented to me). There's the 'English Sparkling Wine Afternoon Tea', 'Royal Ascot Afternoon Tea' and 'Vegan Afternoon Tea', priced accordingly of course. For the Teas and other Beverages, they had 5 Exclusive Tea Blends, 2 Speciality Seasonal Teas, 2 Rare & Limited Teas, 3 Black Teas, 4 Flavoured Black Teas, 4 Green Teas, 3 Flavoured Green Teas, 1 Oolong Tea, 1 White Tea, 1 Flavoured White Tea, 5 Caffeine Free Infusions and 10 Coffees. 

I went for the ROYAL ASCOT AFTERNOON TEA, with its 'Selection of Homemade Finger Sandwiches on Artisan Bread', 'Selection of Pastries', 'A Choice of their Specially Selected Grand and Rare Teas', plus 'A Seasonal Pre-Dessert'. There were 5 Savoury Sandwiches including CRUSHED EGGS WITH HAFOD CHEDDAR CHEESE, MAYONNAISE AND CHOPPED CHIVES ON WHITE BREAD and BLACK ANGUS PASTRAMI WITH HERTFORDSHIRE WATERCRESS, RED ONION MARMALADE AND GRAIN MUSTARD MAYONNAISE ON WHOLEMEAL BREAD and MALDON CURE SMOKED SALMON WITH DORSET WASABI MAYONNAISE AND LEMON BALM ON MALTED GRAIN BREAD and BABY CUCUMBER WITH DICED APPLE AND MINT CREAM CHEESE ON BROWN BREAD and NORFOLK ROASTED CHICKEN WITH MUSTARD MAYONNAISE, ROSEMARY AND ONION STUFFING ON BASIL BREAD. 

For the Pastries, they had TRADITIONAL BRITISH BATTENBERG (Almond Sponge with a Layer of Rose Jam), ELDERFLOWER AND YUZU TART (Lemon Confit and Yuzu Curd with an Elderfower Mousse), STRAWBERRY AND VANILLA CHOIX (Light Cream Cheese Mousse and Strawberry Compote with Vanilla Cream) and CHOCOLATE AND BANANA (Salted Caramel and Crunchy Pecan with Milk Chocolate Cream). For the 'customary' Scones, (that come with most Afternoon Teas), they had WARM RAISIN AND PLAIN SCONES, SERVED WITH EARL GREY TEA JELLY, HOMEMADE STRAWBERRY JAM AND CORNISH CLOTTED CREAM FROM CRAIG'S FARM DAIRY IN DORSET. I have no idea who Craig is, and what his farm is all about! 🤔 A SEASONAL PRE-DESSERT (from The Pastry Chef) was served. Can't remember what it was called. For my tea, I picked the VANILLA FLAVOURED BLACK TEA- ""Whole Sri-Lankan Vanilla Pods and Natural Vanilla Extract are used to infuse Orange Pekoe Ceylon, creating a deliciously creamy and delicate tea"". 

My Afternoon Tea was served with a complimentary glass of WILD IDOL NON-ALCOHOLIC CHAMPAGNE. Wild Idol is a Premium Brand of Alcohol-Free Sparkling Champagne alternative(s). In all honesty, I was a bit disappointed in the Afternoon Tea at Orchid Room! ☹️ Though all the Sandwiches and Pastries tasted very nice, I expected soooooooo much more from an establishment as posh and upscale as a 'Tea Room' in the one and only Dorchester Hotel! When I read the menu, I was super excited because everything, (most notably the Sandwiches) were described so appealingly. They sounded so rich and decadent, yet every single item I ate fell short of what I expected. The Norfolk Roasted Chicken Sandwich was nothing more than a glorified Coronation Chicken Sandwich. The Maldon Cure Smoked Salmon Sandwich tasted like a regular Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese Sandwich. The Black Angus Pastrami Sandwich was just a plain Roast Beef Sandwich. The Crushed Eggs with Hafod Cheddar Cheese was a simple Egg Salad Sandwich as far as I was concerned! 🙄 All the Sandwiches and Pastries tasted very, very ordinary to me; nothing special, nothing to write home about! I also thought they were stingy with the Scones. At least 2 of each should have been served, as opposed to one. The Cornish Clotted Cream and Jam that accompanied the Scones were delicious; so fresh and 'authentic-tasting'. Needless to say, all the Afternoon Tea 'accoutrements' looked amazing, (as you can see from my posted photos). The 'faux' Champagne was okay, but not really my style. What I really enjoyed was the Seasonal Pre-Dessert. It was unusual tasting, yet very cool and refreshing to the palette. 

So to sum it all up, I'd say I had a 'mediocre' experience at Orchid Room in The Dorchester. Service here is splendid, with every member of the hotel's staff- from the Butlers at the main entrance, to the Door Men, to a lady at the reception to Kevin (of course), were fantastic; so poised and well-mannered. I also found the price of my Royal Ascot Afternoon Tea to be reasonable for a city as expensive as London. It was £95, plus a service charge of 15%, (or 14.25). Don't forget, this is one of London's swankiest 5 star hotels with rooms that average about £1,000 to £2,000 per night. I won't and can't go so far as to say that I won't return to Orchid Room for Afternoon Tea, but I think it's safe to say that I'd rather try some other 'High Tea Experience'; perhaps at another high-end hotel. This Afternoon Tea just didn't have that 'Wow' factor. Nothing blew me away whatsoever. Honestly, I've had more impressive Afternoon Teas in Dubai, in much lower rated, less extravagant hotels than The Dorchester. Nevertheless, I enjoyed what I had at the Orchid Room, and Ioved 'perceiving' the gorgeous ambiance of this spectacular, visually stunning restaurant. I'd like to say a big thank you to KEVIN for his exemplary service. A nice Afternoon Tea at London's Dorchester Hotel, just.......'nice'. ",3,2022,06,30
130,Mixed level of food service ,"Well we experienced two levels of food service at The Dorchester Hotel. 

We had afternoon cream tea and served champagne first. Shortly afterwards we received a plate of sandwiches, which when we finished we had to ask if we can place our tea order.  The pots of teas arrived at the same time as the scones, cream and homemade strawberry jam. This was followed with some fancy and delicate cakes, which we could eat, as we was full. So the waiter boxed them up for us. However when we received the bill, there was a 15% service charge, so we asked the waiter to remove it. But he asked why, as his manager would question him. I explained that we shouldn't have to ask for our pots of tea, but the waiter said that they don't normally take the tea order until the sandwiches are served. However I pointed out that other tables the pots of tea where delivered with the sandwiches. Finally the waiter seems annoyed and didn't have the courtesy to say goodbye.

The breakfast service was on a different level and something you expect from a luxury 5 star hotel. I had poached eggs and the waiter asked how I would like them cooked - soft, medium or hard.  With the pastries bowl, he suggested trying the charcoal raspberry crossiant as it was his favourite. It was so lovely and truly unforgettable tasty. I even asked if I could take a charcoal raspberry crossiant with me.... The waiter couldnt do enough for us and completely different level of service to the previous day afternoon cream tea.

Without the experience of the afternoon cream tea service, I would of rated it 5/5",4,2022,06,24
130,Amazing Birthday Stay,"Had the most amazing stay to celebrate my 50th birthday. We were joined by friends who also stayed through and we all said it was the most amazing stay in London that all of us have had and we have been fortunate enough to stay in some amazing places. Everything about The Dorchester is truly spectacular. Rooms are beautifully decorated, the hotel throughout is classic but not stuffy. The service is incredible at every single stage, from reception, to waiting staff and bar staff. Staff just seem to anticipate what you need and nothing is a problem and they will do their best to accommodate in any way they can. I think this is what really elevates this hotel for me is the exceptional staff. They truly made my celebration one to remember, all the little touches such as our room had balloons and a cake as well as a gift of a scarf, all of which made my experience a memory which I will always cherish. The hotel is also very centrally located so easy access to everywhere we needed to go, but we didn't venture out much as just enjoyed the hotel and all it had to offer. You can visit the spa facilities at the sister hotel 45 Park Lane which were truly beautiful and luxurious. All in all a truly fabulous experience that everyone should try at least once in their lifetime.",5,2022,06,11
130,Fabulous Sunday Lunch,"We had Sunday Lunch at the Dorchester to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. 
The food was fabulous, the attention to detail was first class and all the staff were amazing. 
If you are in London and you really want to treat yourself then try the Dorchester it really is 5 star.",5,2022,06,10
130,Anniversary long weekend,"From the very start at check in the staff were amazing, extremely  helpful, polite and courteous, we experienced the same high level of service  throughout the hotel, in the restaurants, the roof top bar. A bottle of Champagne along with  a cake and other little treats were in our room to welcome us during our Anniversary stay. The food was excellent as was the service during our stay nothing was to much trouble, it was a  absolute pleasure for us to stay there and we are looking forward to returning.
Please pass on our thanks and appreciation to all your staff they were all superb many thanks regards vaughan T",5,2022,06,06
130,Classic London Charm,"Absolute perfection. From the moment we booked, to check in, our stay to check out, our entire experience was flawless. The Hotel is classically charming. The staff is extremely well trained and professional. We were fortunate to check in with Fabiana who is so lovely. Every care and need was attended to. Our room was beautifully appointed. They even had a baby gift waiting for us! Room service was correct and delicious every morning. The Mayfair district is an excellent location as the hotel is a block from beautiful Hyde Park. It’s also very near Harrods if shopping is your desire. The Hotel was under construction while we were there but we were not disrupted by this. We look forward to a return visit to The Dorchester once again.",5,2022,06,03
130,"Great, of course","Super expensive but you get what you pay for I guess!
Very smart but a wonderful treat. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and felt we had really experienced London at it's best.
There are quite a lot of people there who want to be seen and it can feel a little intimidating but we expected that and the people watching and the people posing is part of the fun!",5,2022,06,01
130,Wedding Anniversary stay.,I really cannot find enough superlatives to describe this exceptional hotel. We had the most incredible 2 night stay for our Wedding Anniversary. We aren’t used to living like this at all so we felt like a King and Queen. Nothing is too much trouble and every single member of the staff were so attentive and seemed truly happy to have us there.,5,2022,05,30
130,Anniversary Celebration,Stayed for one night here celebrating my first year wedding anniversary. This place is above 10/10. From the moment I arrived all my worries were taken care of. A truly remarkable group of Individuals delivering a service that cannot be mirrored by any hotel I have ever stayed or will ever stay. My wife loved the experience .. Emma and her team at the front desk deserve a massive shoutout and should celebrate there hardwork. Thank you to everyone at the Dorchester :) wonderful touch with the balloond and complimentary cake :),5,2022,05,30
130,Overcharged by £200,"We booked a table for five in celebration for a friend’s birthday. Service was great on the day, sandwiches were average, scones really tasty, ambience fantastic. They overcharged us by two extra afternoon teas, weren’t apologetic about it at the time and we had to spend time the following week chasing up our £200 refund. Poor communication and please do check your bills carefully.",2,2022,05,25
130,Can’t beat it!,"Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester.’Wonderful experience. Great food, excellent service, superb piano player. Just as you would dream from such a great venue and not too expensive for such a great afternoon.",5,2022,05,09
130,As expected...wondeful,"Amazing hotel, history, views, amazing rooms and decor. Well worth the price tag! Breakfast was beautifully cooked. The staff were very friendly and attentive, great stuff team. My wife and I will be back soon.",5,2022,05,06
130,Superb service,Stayed 2 nights. Service at our first breakfast was very very slow. It seemed as if there was a problem in the kitchen rather than the waiting staff. They were very apologetic. What was impressive was their recovery at our 2nd breakfast. The staff knew exactly who were were and what of coffee and juice we wanted. The food came out super fast this time. All the staff tried very hard to please.,5,2022,04,23
130,Birthday afternoon tea,"I booked afternoon tea for my mums 70th birthday, on booking I had notified the orchid room about the special occasion. 
When we were seated there was a birthday card on the table which was a lovely touch. 
The service was amazing and the staff very friendly, the sandwiches and cakes were plentiful, tasty and beautifully presented, more were offered throughout our meal which was great although what you get is filling enough. We opted for the champagne afternoon tea as is was a special occasion. 
The reason I have not given 5 stars is because I had read that if it is your birthday you get a little cake and a candle presented to you, there were several birthdays going on around us and each were presented with a little birthday cake. As our afternoon tea came to an end I was waiting for my mums to come out but it never did which I found disappointing as it would have been a lovely way to end our afternoon tea. 
Having said that the food was lovely and the staff really friendly and the service was great.",4,2022,04,04
130,Dissatisfied ,After having afternoon tea at RHS Chelsea last year and finding it exceptional I thought we'd go to the Dorchester. Same price but with a markup of 15% service charge. 10.00 for first champagne and 15.00 for 2nd.... despite husband not drinking.... followed by giving me the wrong coat when leaving. Disappointed ,3,2022,03,21
130,Wedding anniversary,"This  review is a little late, however i needed to leave a review on this amazing hotel. I took my wife here for our third anniversary and it really did not disappoint. the décor in this hotel is exactly what me and my wife love, very classic very elegant and really has the wow factor when you enter through the doors. I dropped the car off to the guys outside and they took care of that, we then checked in and were brought up to the room, The room was beautiful with the classic look throughout, really was a night to remember. We also used the pool facilities of the other hotel the Dorchester owns over the road, very zen and also very lovely. All in all an amazing weekend we spent in London and a fantastic hotel to choose, we will definitely be returning. Would like to thank all of the staff throughout the whole hotel as everyone was fantastic and a one night stay was made to feel very special.",5,2022,03,11
130,what a welcome,"unfortunately there were building works at the hotel, but we had booked to eat at Alain Ducasse restaurant so we elected to stay at the hotel.
I arrived before my partner as I had been on business in London.greeted by Cristina Rotunno on reception.she checked me in and kept me supplied with coffee as I waited for my partner.All the staff were lovely.the restaurant was beyond brilliant and we had lovely stay",4,2022,03,10
130,Valentine's stay,"Had a wonderful stay at the Dorchester to celebrate valentine's weekend.
As a first stay we could not have been more impressed with the staff who were so friendly and helpful making our stay one we will not forget. We would highly recommend the hotel tour with Chris.",5,2022,02,13
130,I Stayed at The Dorchester Hotel in the Park Suit and in the Executive Room,"Since we arrived we were very welcome at this amazing Hotel. Staff was soo friendly speak in many different languages according to our preference. From Housekeeping, Reception, Room Service and Restaurants it was a brilliant stay; always wanting to know if we were ok. This was during the pandemic and we asked the reception if they had any exams to get tested, straight away one of the staff came to our room to deliver the exams. The service at this Hotel made me feel like a Prince/Princess. Only thing was that the rooftop was apparently open till 00:00 and we got there at 23:00 and they said we would have to go to the bar downstairs which we had an amazing service. I’m the rooftop the only thing i didn’t like was that the floor is in wood with little fences and if you have thin high heels be Carefull cause they might fall in the fences and you can’t équilibrate properly.",5,2022,02,05
130,We stayed at the Dorchester with 2 friends for a short break.,"The Dorchester and the staff team delivered an outstanding exceptional world class service. From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed nothing was too much trouble. The accommodation was beautiful as was the food and dining experience.
I can strongly recommend the Dorchester, the staff even cleaned bird excrement from our car prior to our departure! Amazing!",5,2022,01,11
130,Just fabulous!,"We stayed Christmas Eve and Christmas Day checking out on Boxing Day. The hotel gave us a double upgrade which we really appreciated. The room overlooked Park Lane and Hyde Park. Large, spacious and with lots of natural light. The bed was really comfortable so we slept like logs:-) 2 single lounges, a double seater lounge, a desk, safe, mini bar fridge, good air-conditioning and a large marble bathroom with ‘super-sized’ bath and separate shower. There were lovely touches over the Christmas period. Drinks and a sing a long by the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, a magnificent candied sleigh on Christmas day. Staff were super attentive. On Christmas Eve we had cocktails and light snacks at The Bar. Wow, what a find in London. We will definately be coming back to the bar.  Breakfast in the ground floor promenade was delightful. Just a perfect stay over the Christmas period. We will be back. Recommended.",5,2021,12,27
130,Sunday lunch,"Amazing food especially the lobster bisque scotch egg.  Elena was a fabulous waitress who catered to our every need, my vegetable roast lunch was delicious and much appreciated. Thank you to everyone for making it a memorable afternoon. You made us very happy!",5,2021,12,19
130,A glorious weekend,"World class hotel and a 5 star experience from start to finish!
Special mentions to some brilliant people who made our stay great...
• Natalia as duty manager front desk
• Stefano at guest relations
• J at the pool / spa
• Bobby on the front door area handling our bags & transport with great chat
Thank you all - best weekend of 2021!",5,2021,11,30
130,Excellent. Probably the best…,"Have reviewed The Dorchester at length before so this time I’ll be brief!
This is an exceptional hotel. The service is superb, the staff are very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are immaculately clean and so well equipped. The technology to operate the air con / heating, TV etc is so easy to understand which is such a great help too.
My wife inadvertently damaged the mechanism to our room door and this was fixed immediately with no fuss. Then she left her iPad in the room when we departed and the hotel have emailed this morning to say they are returning it to us by overnight express with no charge. Cannot fault the Dorchester and hopefully will return. Definitely number one choice for us in London.",5,2021,11,26
130,Exceptional In every way,"OMG it has been a few years since we stayed here but was eating at La Gavroche so it made sense to stay and boy I will definitely not leave it a few years before I return.
What a surprise they phoned a couple of days before to see if we wanted any dining reservations and got chatting and  mentioned we had already made plans for my 50th a couple of weeks ago.  Not thinking anything of that when we got to the hotel they wished me a happy birthday and when we got to the room there was balloons, champagne, card and cake which really made me feel special. They also said that they would take us to the restaurant in their car.  So thoughtful!!
We had lunch in hotel and a couple of drinks and our waiter was so lovely with the biggest smile going.  We then visited their cocktail bar after dinner our and the atmosphere was fab.
Breakfast was amazing, like an experience in its self, so much choice and food, it was amazing!  And to top it off overnight they had put up their Christmas decorations and the place looked magical.  
Easily by far for English tradition, service, quality of food it has to the best hotel in England - so can’t wait to return!!!",5,2021,11,20
130,A birthday to remember!,"My husband booked a night in this beautiful hotel to celebrate my 40th birthday and it was just wonderful.
Our suite was stunning. The champagne, dessert in the room and the lovely treat of a bag full of products from the spa was an unexpected, lovely surprise.
Every member of staff we encountered from the gentlemen at the door, to the reception staff and the porters were helpful, courteous and kind.
We had pre dinner drinks and breakfast on the Promenade which were fantastic.
A beautiful dinner at the China Tang was followed by drinks at 45 Park Lane.
I didn’t want to leave! A wonderful weekend.
Thank you to the Dorchester staff for making it so special.",5,2021,11,17
130,Afternoon Tea,Simply outstanding what more could you need absolutely stunning hotel beautiful food wonderful staff made our birthdays perfect thankyou. Such a fantastic hotel pianos playing champagne is flowing will definitely be back.,5,2021,11,16
130,Iconic luxury ,"This is a wonderful place to stay.From the moment you enter it is like stepping back in time to a world of history luxury and nostalgia. We stayed in a lovely suite after a complimentary upgrade a wonderful room with a large lounge bedroom and luxury bathroom all so stunning but the real highlight was the promenade with a superb breakfast Lovely lunch listening to a professional pianist and pre dinner champagne to a singer singing modern songs in a jazz style.i cannot praise the staff enough professional but approachable and despise been busy they always found time for a chat 
Overall three nights of complete luxury that I will be back to repeat soon ",5,2021,11,11
130,Simply stunning,After staying in July with my daughter I treated my husband to night here for his 40th birthday. The staff again excelled themselves they helped me and a set up our room with his 40th gifts for a surprise. A big thank you to the manager that day who helped me with this. We had champagne flowers balloons  chocolates cakes etc waiting for us on arrival in our room.  Attention to detail is they key at this hotel and they get everything right. The spa is exquisite and so relaxed we ate at China tang as the grill was shut and the food and staff were all amazing. We ate in the promenade both days for breakfast and the staff and food were equally amazing. I don’t even want to try any other hotels in London now as I love the Dorchester that much. Will definitely be back in the new year,5,2021,11,11
130,What a privilege!,"We were privileged to stay 3 nights at the Dorchester and enjoyed our stay enormously! The absolute perfect location of the hotel and then the Impeccably serviced rooms, crisp linens and thick, fluffy towels made us feel pampered. Not to mention the friendly staff, the so peaceful spa at 45 Park Lane, the delicious breakfasts, and so much more! We relished this beautiful neighborhood, in walking and cycling distance to parks, theaters, landmarks, restaurants and shopping. Keep up the good work DC team!",4,2021,10,31
130,Magical,"LOVE the Dorchester, had the great opportunity to visit London  many times. Stayed at the hotel at least 4 or 5 times.

It is a magical experience, first time i stayed. Reception knew my name as if i was a name brand ? Then i was cued  into the link-man :)

On one stay , they found out i had a delayed flight & just not feeling well! The hotel was booked and with a EB flight i was checking in at 9am. 
Magically a interim room was offered , and i had a nice rest and ,  tea and digestives were sent up. Until my park view room
( upgraded  to a suite) was all ready. 

Ricci Obertelli   had sent a nice bottle of champagne, fruit , water, chocolates and card awaited us :) 

Now, this is how a deluxe hotel treats you. Love the bar & restaurant and of course the promenade  for scrupulous afternoon tea.
Ive had the opportunity to stay at many of Londons iconic  hotels - however the service , rooms & suites besides the amazing bars & restaurants etc. are the best of the best.
Did i mention the views - amazing  - awaking in the AM with horse hoves echoing down parklane, heading to buck house - let you know ur in London….! 

I LONG for a repeat visit & to be so totally spoiled , just one more time lord - really its just that good - little  slice heaven on parklane .

God  bless you all , at the Dorchester!

Warmest regards, Vincent Strickland",5,2021,10,29
130,The best of the best,"If you want a quintessential hotel experience, then come here when you are in London. It's old yes, rooms can remind you of your granny's room back in the days. Carpets are all over the place, BUT then that is the charm of the place. Friendly and professional staff over shine at this hotel which has been a fixture in London for God knows how long for.

It has a sister hotel called 45 Park Lane where you can use the latest (and the cleanest) gym and swimming facilities. Breakfast is to die for. Restaurants are good. Overall, I was looking for some fault at all times which I had miserably failed. It's that kind of hotel which doesn't exist anymore - they work on perfection all the time.

Highly recommend if you are in London. It's expensive but worth for the money in my opinion.",5,2021,10,25
130,Another Perfect Stay!,"We have been staying at the Dorchester for over 20 years and it is our favorite hotel in London and quite possibly the world! We were celebrating our anniversary and were surprised and delighted to find balloons, champagne, cake and a sweet note from the hotel in our room upon arrival!!  We loved our daily breakfast as well as afternoon tea in the Promenade and got to know our superb server Anwau (not sure of spelling). We also enjoyed a fabulous afternoon in the spa, and I loved my massage with Erica. Thank you for another amazing stay! I can’t wait to return!!",5,2021,10,22
130,"Dorchester lunch, just perfect","Visited Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester today to celebrate our 30 Wedding anniversary delayed from earlier in the year,
Very impressed from the moment we arrived till we left,
Service, food and surroundings fully deserve the credit they get for Michelin stars.
Special thanks go to the Director who spend considerable time with us making sure everything was satisfactory and also having general chat.
Special touches make the experience unique, Cannot recommend this resturant and staff highly enough,
Thanks again for a wonderful lunchtime visit,",5,2021,10,15
130,Not great but we’ll be back.,"We’ve used this stunning hotel frequently over the decades as our go-to London destination for drinks and dining. On this occasion it was clearly being affected by Covid related staff shortages. It seems even this international icon isn’t immune from the affects of staffing shortages. Bars and restaurants were closed and we couldn’t even get a drink on the Promenade, which looked like it hadn’t been serviced for hours. 

Lovely staff as usual but perhaps a bit too keen to share their frustrations and issues. No doubt once the pandemic passes this stunning property will return to first class service. 

We will be back.",3,2021,10,13
130,Best ambiance,"Beautiful cocktails for a relaxing evening/ afternoon. Is extremely hard to find a satisfying margarita but the level they make it is just right! Rest of cocktails are very nice too.

Can not wait to come back.",5,2021,10,12
130,Outstanding weekend stay,"Having the experience to stay at such a prestige hotel and be treated with such kindness and respect I hope many people have the chance to stay here. 
The unexpected added extras just enhanced our experience and we did not feel out of place.
We arrived to a lovely welcome from Emma. Our room wasn’t ready so we were shown to the bar. Then our room was ready, we were shown up to our room. 
It was as we expected, some old charm with some modern features. 
The bed was ridiculously comfortable and we were surprised with champagne. 
The bathroom, kitted out in marble and the deepest bath. 
 The mini bar was well out of our price range, and I did have to request tea and coffee making facilities. 
Breakfast was outstanding and again we were made to feel part of the hotel. Service exceptional. 
We stayed for two nights, we did use the bar and welcomed the fantastic door staff as it rained and they sheltered us with umbrellas. 
We felt included, and it was everything we imagined. I do hope to have the honour of staying again but reality is we probably won’t. 
But thanks for the weekend and pledging the room for me to stay. Best wishes andrea",5,2021,10,11
130,Anwar - Top Hostess at The Dorchester,"04/10/2021, Had afternoon tea at The Dorchester, this place is serene and beyond imagination. The flower arrangements blew me away.  The afternoon tea was great, cannot fault.  Our hostess Anwar made our day, he was truly attentive and catered to our needs as due to religious reasons certain food items were removed.  This was no bother to Anwar.  The whole experience is something I will live to remember.  I would truly recommend.  Also to add is that the rest of the lobby hostesses were also smartly dressed. This is truly English quintessential at it’s finest!! On departing the hotel, we were also given two Dorchester roses, simply class..",5,2021,10,05
130,Afternoon tea,"We came to The Dorchester as part of my birthday celebrations for afternoon tea. It was lovely. The service was exceptionally good and was very attentive but not overwhelming. 
We had arrived early and had a cocktail in the bar before being sat at our table. We were next to the piano which was being beautifully played. The sandwiches and scones were beautiful the cakes were nice but not to my taste. But was a very enjoyable afternoon.",5,2021,10,04
130,Fantastic stay,"We were made to feel so welcome from the moment we stepped out of our car. We felt part of the family, our room was absolutely exquisite overlooking the front of the hotel. I really enjoyed stepping out onto the balcony and watching the fabulous street scene. 
My husband and I were both celebrating our birthday, the hotel gave us a cake, balloons, chocolate and a bottle of champagne.  A lovely thoughtful touch, the staff were all so friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble..
We were greeted at reception and taken to our beautiful room, from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we we made to feel so very special.
Our meal in the Grill was one of the most tastiest that I have ever eaten, the food was presented  so beautifully and we were given a description of everything that we ate.  
We have stayed all over the World in many luxurious hotels, the Dorchester is probably the best experience we have had. Every single detail taken care of but the wonderful staff make this hotel stand out from the others.",5,2021,09,26
130,Beyond 5*. Totally recommended. ,"I spent my birthday at the Stanhope suite for some days and I was soooo delighted I choose the Dorchester. I was well looked after and my birthday was made soooo special by Katie from guest relations. She got my gifts, ensured my room was decorated how I wanted, she saved the day and I was so so happy. I have forgotten the names of the other staffa but  everyone down to the cleaners are soooo lovely. It feels like a family. I felt welcomed. You must try their French toast !! Well certainly be back. Love love it here. ",5,2021,09,19
130,Home away from home!,"Lovely hotel - not my usual style - I generally stay at the 4 seasons - but this is the Dorchester! The name itself is synonymous with luxury! 

The team and wonderful / breakfast is great the lobby atmosphere esp on the weekend is buzzing and exciting.

The rooms are starting to show age but are good size and well maintained - I did have to move rooms after the first night but the new room on 6th floor was much nicer with a Hyde Park  view.

I live in Mayfair and spend a lot of time at the Dorchester anyway at China tang but to stay here has been enjoyable!",5,2021,09,18
130,Afternoon Tea,"Outstanding from start to finish from the decor & service, to the food and drink.
We were all warmly greeted at the door and taken to our table at the time allocated to us. Our waiter was Purna who made the occasion extra special. He was very professional, attentive and nothing was too much trouble for him. As my father and daughter had a few dietary requirements, I had telephoned the Dorchester a week beforehand to speak to a member of staff to discuss the matter. All of their needs were catered for, without any fuss whatsoever. The food presented to us was a work of art from the sandwiches to the scones and cakes. Also towards the end I was presented with a small beautifully decorated birthday cake and the pianist (who was also excellent and played everything beautifully from memory) played 'Happy Birthday'.  It was indeed the best two and half hours my family and I have spent at any hotel/restaurant having afternoon tea. FABULOUS. Thank you Dorchester. You have made my birthday & family trip to London a very memorable one.",5,2021,09,13
130,Sunday treat.....,"Amazing champagne afternoon tea, complimented by a bottle of Verve Clique we purchased. Excellent food, great attentive service from Anwar and Ludwig (couldn't do enough for us) and relaxing time without any rush. Treated like royalty in the splendid Promenade. A must for lovers of this type of experience, we would definitely do it again!",5,2021,09,10
130,First Stay at the Dorchester,"I had previously had dinner and afternoon tea at the Dorchester, and due to travel restrictions abroad, cegidec to stay there over the Bank Holiday weekend. From the moment I arrived, until the moment I left, I was made to fell very welcome and special. The reception team of Angelo and Alberto were very friendly, professional and helpful, and arranged for me to take photos around the hotel as it is a hobby of mine.
I stayed in a King Superior room which had been refurbished, It was very well appointed, spacious clean and comfortable with a decent sized bathroom. The soundproofing in the hotel is excellent, and Sir Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that the Dorchester is the perfect place to commit a murder due to the soundproofing. However, the windows could be better glazed, as there is noise from the street.
I had breakfast in the Promenade during my stay, which was pure theatre and the quality of food and drinks and the service was exceptional. Auran was my waiter on both mornings, and he thoughtfully boxed some of my favourite pastries for the rail journey home. I also had dinner in the Grill, and again the service, food and drinks were excellent, and I was looked after by Celine.
If you want a touch of luxury in a traditional hotel that still maintains the standards and glamour of a bygone age, then I thoroughly recommend the Dorchester.",5,2021,09,04
130,Anniversary weekend.,"Had to write a little about our trip to the Dorchester. We stayed in the Stanhope suite. From when we pulled up in our car. We was greeted by friendly staff, who took our bags and the car was whisked away. We was greeted by Antonio who said our room wasn’t quite ready. So had a light lunch. Then was shown personally by Antonio to our suite. And wow, it was beautiful. Everything you could want from a room. 
Had a great day out and about. The  returned and went down to the Dorchester Grill. Fantastic food. Met Tom who was lovely. 
The only problem was, I was ill with a migraine, and couldn’t have the breakfast which Dean told me was amazing when he came back to the room.
As we booked a staycation, we had late checkout. And the staff again was so caring and couldn’t do enough to get me in the car to get home.
But apart from that we will be returning in the very near future. 
",5,2021,09,03
130,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Service, Amazing Staff","This is without a doubt one of the best hotels in the UK
Every aspect of our stay was perfect in every way.

We would  like to thank the amazing staff at front of house, the restaurants and bars. Every member of staff played a part in making our stay perfect.

Myself and my partner would specifically like to thank Fabiana Marzucco, front office manager, for her professional care and attention to our stay which was amazing in every detail. 

Fabiano is a true asset to the Dorchester.

We will definitely be staying at the Dorchester again and very highly recommend this hotel.

Thank You

130,"Simply amazing, thank you!","We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Dorchester with our 3 children (3, 8 & 9). We had 2 adjoining suites and I must stay, we had probably the best hotel experience ever. The kids had tears in their eyes on the train home, mainly due to the exceptional experience given to us by the world class staff who could not have done enough for us. The hotel is immaculate, the food unbelievable and again, the staff incredible. The location, we found, was superb and just what we wanted. We also had use of the sister hotel over the roads spa which was 10/10 and again the children loved it. We will certainly be back. I cannot think of a single negative thing to stay, we were made to feel like royalty. 11/10 all round, thank you!",5,2021,08,30
130,An absolutely amazing experience,"I came to London on a training course and got slightly lost, I thought the course was at The Dorchester, it wasn’t. I was slightly upset as I was late and before I knew it Dean (chauffeur) and another gentleman had loaded my case into a beautiful Mercedes and drove me to where my course was being held! It was a proper damsel in distress situation, I was so grateful and they were my knights in shining armour! Now that’s 5* service! The next day I returned for afternoon tea, wow oh wow, what a lovely experience! All the staff were friendly and very professional. The tea was out of this world, what a fantastic experience. I will definitely be coming back again, just lovely, I didn’t want to come home.",5,2021,08,26
130,Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff & service.,"A must stay hotel.  We visited for my birthday and from the moment we entered the hotel we were greeted by wonderful staff who all made sure our stay was perfect and special.  Our rooms were beautiful, really spacious with everything we needed and hotel arranged beautiful flowers, champagne, cake and an abundance of birthday balloons for my birthday.  The pool & Spa at 45 Park Lane was a great benefit and easy to book, All staff were very attentive, friendly and extremely helpful in particular Maria and Emma, who really went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect in every way, checking in each day.  They were both genuinely caring and authentic. Maria even arranged a special gift for me for checking out.  We’re already planning our next visit.",5,2021,08,24
130,Underwhelming,"I had the afternoon tea and the menu is underwhelming. Boring sandwiches and no creativity on this menu. I have had afternoon tea at the Ritz, the Savoy and PennyHill park, to name a few. These would be my choices, not the Dorchester.  Halal menu was provided. 
£70 + service charge for afternoon tea is fine, but you expect an exciting and creative afternoon tea for this. Mini bagels, mini baguettes pastries, a selection of breads etc. Scones were dry. Conserve had lumpy strawberries, so difficult to spoon on the scones. Disappointing.",3,2021,08,23
130,Disappointingly Average,"At a cost of £240 for two, the champagne afternoon tea was distinctly average. The sandwiches were not anything special, the ham was chewy. The scones were dry. We chose a tea off the menu only to be told there was an extra £10 charge each for our chosen teas. The service was just average too. We have been to the Ritz, The Savoy and Claridges for Afternoon Tea, all of these are far nicer than The Dorchester and cheaper too. Beautiful setting but very disappointed to have to write this review.",3,2021,08,22
130,Beautiful hotel,"A beautiful old hotel with exceptional service. Every member of staff we encountered was professional, friendly and a credit to the hotel. The rooms are lovely, spacious and well-equipped. 

We had no coffee machine but rang down and one was brought on a trolley with lots of coffee, tea and cups. Bathrooms are marble and look fantastic although some tiling areas are a little rough around the edges (see photos)

Not enough to knock off a star from my review but at this price point you expect perfection and better attention to detail so worth looking at. 

All in all, a great stay in a wonderful hotel that's ideally located to explore London's finest areas and hotspots.",5,2021,08,22
130,Birthday Treat,"When it comes to celebrating my birthday, it’s only a handful of hotels across the world that I trust to make sure I have an amazing time. The hotel I trust the most is The Dorchester, London.

Michelle Sangil reached out to me before the visit to make sure that all of my preferences and requests were noted. I was surprised to me given a wonderful upgrade when I arrived, in honour of my special celebration! 

The suite we were given was sensational, simply breathtaking. If you’ve read any of my reviews before, you’ll probably know that I’ve been to most high-end restaurants in London and I can say that my favourite meal EVER was the room service from the hotel. We had the steak with a truffle butter with some veggies. It was exceptional. I’ll be making a trip to the hotel again soon just for their room service menu!

We had drinks at the promenade area and the pianist played happy birthday to me… just as Rod Stewart of all people walked past! I grabbed a cheeky selfie! The staff were very attentive and had a great conversation with them.

If you’re staying at the hotel, book a complementary history tour with Chris. He did a great job in showing us around, it was like being behind the scenes of a great tv show.

Our suite and the amenities were amazing. We loved every second. We felt too comfortable there. It was hard to leave. It was a Dorchester Suite that we stayed in. Simply amazing!

The hotel gave me a birthday gift. It was beautifully wrapped and very thoughtful. When I opened it, I was very surprised… it was a beautiful tie!!! It was very thoughtful of them and made my trip… as well as the upgrade.

The breakfast each morning was amazing. I wrote a few side notes on the menu, I.e. for a cheese and ham omelette. This wasn’t on the menu, but it arrived! I love that and that’s the very reason I stay at The Dorchester. 

The hotel made a big fuss of me and my special occasion and it’ll always be remembered.

Thank you The Dorchester!",5,2021,08,20
130,It was ok.,"I booked the Polo Lounge Rooftop Outdoor dining for my birthday on Wednesday 18th August at 3pm. 

I cannot fault the food and the main staff who served us. 

However I have placed an average review due to some of the staff I encountered.  On arrival the doorman who greeted us was friendly and very helpful but the next lady who worked/floated around on the lobby floor, when I greeted her to explain why we where there she was basically mute and had a faceless expression. She gestured with her body language to follow her to the lift which she called for us and when I tried to make polite conversation with her I got no response and no smile or facial expression. 

When we got out of the life and when to the desk and explained again we had a table booked the younger females there were again expressionless. When someone smiles at me I smile back, is that not common courtesy? Maybe not at The Dorchester. 

A sullen female showed us to the most awkward table almost in the middle of the main walkway which made us feel like we were an add on. 

On server that day was great and moved us to another table which wasn’t in the way. 

Would I return, probably not, I don’t need to experience such unfriendly people in life.",3,2021,08,19
130,Afternoon Tea,Chose to have afternoon tea at the Promenade to celebrate a birthday and graduation.  Lewis Hunter provided the most amazing service leading up to and during the service.  Could not have asked for anything more.   10/10 service and hospitality.,5,2021,08,15
130,Lovely hotel,Stayed here recently for a London staycation. Loved every minute. Fantastic levels of service and luxury. Booked afternoon tea and dinner too which were both superb. Very beautiful hotel and really nice to be able to stay here. Lovely stroll through Mayfair the day of our check out.,5,2021,08,15
130,Awful,"visited their rooftop restaurant and was sat right in front of the cooking hob.
Yes the cooking was being  done on the hob right behind my back and i could feel the heat and smell the cooking food.
the food here is of very very average standard and the prices are of the very highest standard
Anyone visiting here i would just say DON'T",1,2021,08,15
130,Birthday Afternoon Tea,"A perfect experience from start to end. A handwritten card for my birthday, a beautiful birthday cake, the amazing pianist (he really adds so much to the ambience) snuck in a little happy birthing during his performance with a nod to me. The waiters were so friendly and thoughtful, and helpful about amending my menu and making suggestions as I am pregnant. Beautiful environment. Food was of course delicious. Thank you very much!",5,2021,08,10
130,Fabulous family friendly hotel,I have just come back from the Dorchester after spending the night there for my daughters 8th birthday. Wow wow wow from the moment of arrival we were treated like royalty. The staff are all so friendly and helpful and cater to your every need. The hotel is stunning we stayed in a deluxe king room which was fabulous and beautifully decorated with gifts for my daughter. The spa/pool at the sister hotel at 45 park avenue was amazing and we had the whole pool to ourselves. We ate in the Dorchester grill for our evening meal and the food was delicious they cater for children too. We had our breakfast in the Dorchester the following morning and the breakfast was one of the best I have ever eaten. I cannot recommend this hotel enough it’s location is Perfect and I will definitely be returning. I would rate it much higher than 5 stars if I could  A big thank you again to all the staff again,5,2021,07,30
130,Afternoon tea in the Promenade Room,"I recently took my sister to the Dorchester for afternoon tea.  I was very disappointed. The cakes were sickly sweet, the scones dry and the cream over whipped double cream not the lovely clotted cream that it should be. I wrote to the food and beverage manager and he didn't bother replying. At £160 for two (no alcohol) I would suggest there are many other hotels in London which would supply a lovely afternoon tea. Don't waste your money at the Dorchester.",2,2021,07,29
130,Their motto should be “Let us take care of it”,"We’ve visited the Dorchester countless times over the years for meals and drinks, but we’ve never actually stayed there. We rectified that this weekend, and we can’t believe we waited so long. 

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted with warm smiles and you feel your stresses fall away. The staff go out of their way to make sure everything at their hotel is spot on for their guests. It literally felt like nothing was a problem, and they would absolutely make sure that whatever we wanted would happen. 

While there, we visited The Dorchester Bar, The Promenade for afternoon tea and breakfast and the spa. Everything was just amazing from the quality of the food and drinks to the friendliness of the staff and the massage in the spa finished off the weekend just right. 

The room was large, spotlessly clean (as was the rest of the hotel) and the bed was very large and comfy.  

I can’t recommend a visit to this amazing place enough.",5,2021,07,20
130,Polo lounge misses big time,"Interesting evening and good music and trendy staff uniforms but service misses on all fronts. 30 minute wait for a drink, shell in crab cakes and pouring our wine summed up an evening where style trumps basic substance.",1,2021,07,19
130,Pop Up Polo Lounge,We had lunch at the pop up Polo Lounge on the rooftop at the Dorchester.  The entrance is fully decorated as the original iconic lounge and the seating area has the floral accents. Portions are generous and we can personally recommend the McCarthy Salad and the lobster risotto.  Lovely place to sit with a chilled glass of champagne and enjoy the live saxophonist and DJ.,5,2021,07,19
130,London Elegance At Its Best,"Its always special to stay at The Dorchester London... from the moment you check-in you know you are in the hands of real hotel operators... its hard to capture that at a landmark, large hotel but The Dorchester just gets it right....

Our suite was spectacular and the check-in so engaged and attentive. The butler service is a treat and the care and attention faultless.... I love staying at this hotel....

The Bar is wonderful and the staff look after you famously... Get a negroni!

Everything at this hotel makes me want to stay longer.... 

Breakfast is just a sensational experience again with everything being thought about and making breakfast as it should be....

We have late night drinks the bar after a spectacular dinner ..... didnt want to go to bed....

One of London's best luxury hotels by far!!!!",5,2021,07,17
130,Just wonderful ,"Wow just wow went for afternoon tea with friends to celebrate my birthday was just amazing loved it was so grand and beautifully decorated, loved the piano music food was fantastic amazing cakes in Wimbledon style so tasty our waiter was so attentive to us we really enjoyed would so recommend for a special occasion ",5,2021,07,17
130,Family occasion,"Afternoon tea today with my family for a special birthday. Absolutely fabulous, afternoon tea was beautiful, the environment was exquisite and the staff were so friendly, particularly Anwar who looked after us so well. Would really recommend it. ",5,2021,07,09
130,"Great staff, great food!!","Great food, great staff!!! My girlfriends and I had lunch at the terrace, and food was so nice. Felip, the waiter who served us was attentive and genuine, he made us feel special.
It was nice going back at this historic place. The only downside is that food was delayed more than an hour. ",4,2021,06,29
130,Anniversary trip,"We go to The Dorchester to celebrate really special occasions.  It is without doubt an iconic place filled with the best service and attention that money can buy.  Everything is always absolutely perfect, the room properly prepared, the attention to your requests perfectly observed and the feeling that you are being spoilt ever present.  This weekend was no different.  Flowers, Champagne and a lovely greeting - reflecting on previous visits.  All staff that we came into contact with were amazing.
Simply, we wouldn't go anywhere else.  Thank you to The Dorchester for making our visit, once again, truly special.",5,2021,06,28
130,A quality stay in an exceptional hotel,"A hotel that carries on the traditions of years gone by where nothing is ever too much for their clientele. 

From when you pull up outside the hotel and the guys take your luggage and park your car you know the Dorchester is a special place. 

A visit to the ground floor bar or one of the restaurants is an absolute must. Throughout the hotel the staff are extremely friendly and engaging while the service, food and drink selection are truly superb. 

Breakfast at the Dorchester really is first class with a very wide selection of items on the menu. The breakfast staff operate like a well oiled machine and are very attentive. 

My only slight criticism is that some of the bathroom fittings, were in our opinion within our room,  a little dated but that is a small price to pay for a very high quality stay in what is an exceptional hotel.",5,2021,06,27
130,Pre dinner Drinks,Called in to the bar for pre dinner drinks yesterday for first time in a year. So glad to be welcomed by familiar faces.  Service impeccable as usual. Cant wait to return in next couple of weeks.  In my opinion. The best cocktail bar in london but then im biased. Love it here,5,2021,06,25
130,Brilliant!,"Anua was a brilliant, kind waiter and we enjoyed our tea very much! A brilliant birthday celebration and a lovely atmosphere! The food was amazing, but we weren’t able to finish it all unfortunately! We will visit again soon :)",5,2021,06,24
130,AMAZING SERVICE ! Best experience ever !,"Today, I went to the Dorchester to celebrate a happy occasion and on the same day I am writing a review to express to everyone that The Dorchester was one of the best afternoon tea experiences I have ever had. I would like to thank and compliment the wonderful service, especially from one individual Anua, he was truly wonderful and helpful. I cannot express enough how he has made my experience perfect ! Thank you !",5,2021,06,19
130,Divine treat for special occasion!,"The beautiful interior of the promenade at this historic hotel. All staff were courteous & friendly. We had afternoon tea & a glass of bubbly. Our waiter Anua was charming, making us laugh, explaining the  different fillings of the sandwiches , the scones & jams , each little cake. My two friends were celebrating their 50th & he brought them a chocolate cake & a candle each. We were treated like royalty - a definite treat for a special occasion,",5,2021,06,18
130,Very Average!,Very mediocre experience for afternoon noon tea here as the place was full of Arabs wearing shorts and t-shirts no dress code like the Ritz! And I was the only one that was actually dressed exquisitely and staff here do most certainly not know how to treat a gentleman like myself! The pianist was really burnt out and the tea was cold and they had the nerve to try and charge me for service as well. Most certainly not GOOD ENOUGH for someone like me with exceptional high standards anyway!!!,3,2021,06,16
130,Champagne Afternoon Tea in The Promenade,"An absolutely lovely afternoon spent at The Dorchester with my Mother, Sister and our two daughters. We enjoyed a champagne afternoon tea which was excellent and so much variety. We even got a goody bag to take away with us. Our wonderful waiter Ricky was simply charming and really enhanced our visit. We will see you again very soon ! Thank you.",5,2021,06,15
130,Special afternoon tea,"Even before we arrived the staff were so helpful. We had been unable to use a voucher purchased many months before and they were kind enough to extend the date several times. We decided to celebrate our son's 40th birthday with afternoon tea and were not disappointed. Every member of staff we encountered were so kind and courteous, something we could not say about other 5* establishments in London. 
The atmosphere, food and drink were excellent. They even remembered our son's birthday. The birthday cake and 'sing along even brought a smile to his face. Thank you for the 'take home bag', it extended the experience to the following day. 
We look forward to visiting again.",5,2021,06,11
130,Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester ,"We finally got to use the Mother’s Day gift for my Mum. I really like The Dorchester property and feel it eludes a calm from the bustle of Mayfair. We were served by a lonely gentlemen called Pavan (I think), he was highly knowledgable on all of the teas and delicacies. My Mum was made to feel really special which I really appreciated and to add to all they even brought a baby Afternoon Tea for my 14 months old. He nibbled on a few items and we took the left overs home. A beautiful setting the food was so fresh and the service made the experience rememberable. I would definitely return. ",5,2021,06,11
130,Highly recommend,"We have just returned from the most wonderful 3 night honeymoon at the Dorchester. We were warmly welcomed and lucky enough to be upgraded to a fabulous and totally sumptuous Mayfair suite. We had opted for the romance package so were met with champagne, flowers, chocolates, cake and a Dorchester diffuser. The suite was beyond our wildest dreams. Beautifully decorated and so well appointed.
A big shout out to Housekeeping. They visited twice a day, at a time to suit us. The suite was spotless. 
We ordered room service breakfast twice which was set up beautifully on our dining room table. The food was so delicious and so plentiful. It kept us going all day!
We visited the bar one evening for cocktails. The staff were very friendly and knowledgable. 
We also sampled a complimentary guest experience. A tour of the Dorchester. Our guide gave us an interesting insight into the hotels past and we were lucky enough to be shown the ballroom and Eisenhower Suite. 
If you can afford it, we would totally recommend the Dorchester. You will be truly spoilt and so well looked after. A great hotel!",5,2021,06,10
130,My exceptional Afternoon Tea Experience,"I don't normally write reviews but this visit definitely warrants one.

I visited today (yes- couldn't wait to get home to write it!) and there was one word for my visit- incredible. 

I came for Afternoon Tea and from the moment we walked in, the service, greetings, atmosphere and food was impeccable. You may say that 'it's a 5* hotel- you should expect nothing less;' however, I have been to many 5* hotels and none of them come close.

My friend came with her baby daughter and the staff were so loving, kind and helpful towards them. They brought her balloons to keep her entertained and were so pleasant.

I would like to give a special mention to one particular gentleman who goes by the name Anwar. I have never experienced such exceptional service from an individual before and I have dined in the finest restaurants around the world- Anwar was memorable- to the point where I had to take a photo of him so I could tell my friends to look out for him when they visit! He was so bubbly, professional, attentive, efficient accommodating and funny! He is just the best!  I can't think of any other superlatives to describe him. I have never experienced such service- His love and passion for his job just exudes through his personality. He is so amazing. Thank you for employing him because its people like him that make a visit memorable. 

I will be back again this time for a short stay too- I am certain I will experience the same level of perfect service.
THANK YOU!!",5,2021,06,10
130,Brilliant afternoon tea,Absolutely gorgeous afternoon tea . Lovely staff and the scones are the best here. Beautiful experience always 🥰 My husband and I love celebrating special occasions here. Always a pleasure to be back. Highly recommend the rose tea. Bathrooms are an added bonus,5,2021,06,05
130,Treat yourself,"It was wonderful to stay at The Dorchester Hotel again. 

Some superb highs, including a spectacular room upgrade with many lovely touches and an historic dinner with personal attention from the Executive Chef, Mario Paretta and amazing cooking of his Sri Lankan favourites. 

Room service was another high at both breakfast and dinner. Again, with stunning service and presentation. Yet there were elements where it was clear that this wonderful hotel is just trying to find its feet again having been closed for so long. Don’t get me wrong everyone was very kind and helpful, but things that you’d take for granted in a five star hotel with this reputation just sometimes didn’t happen. Things like missed items at breakfast, service in The Promenade was mixed and similarly sometimes when we arrived back from shopping we were asked were we checking in. Small things, but important too when you’re paying top dollar. But these things aside, The Dorchester does well and we’ll be back as soon as we can.",4,2021,05,27
130,Wife’s birthday,"Unbelievable staff, unbelievable service. The whole team at The Dorchester were so polite, friendly and professional. Again it was a pleasure stopping at this iconic hotel which has some great views of Hyde Park. Until next time thankyou.",5,2021,05,27
130,Great facility but rude and aggressive member of staff,"I attended an event in one of the ballrooms on Saturday 22 May. I encountered this gentleman, I'm not sure if he is the supervisor or manager, but he was rude, unkind and aggressive. His hostility made him slammed the door on my face because he said I shouldn't have exited through that door, all through the evening, he was arrogant. He was lucky that the door didn't hit me, I would have pressed charges.",5,2021,05,22
130,Decadence In Mayfair ,"Stayed for 3 nights straight after easing of lockdown check in easy and due to low occupancy given double upgrade to Mayfair Suite which is stunning breakfast included which is served in the promenade with home made muffins a highlight. This is a decadent place to spend time enjoying the high life and no better time to go while fewer guests staying
We felt very safe with good covid practices observed throughout our stay
All in all felt totally pampered from start to finish ",5,2021,05,21
130,Really Dorchester?,"On arrival the receptionist  immediately informed my wife and I that there was space but there was a minimum spend of £60 per head..........I was aghast that this 5 star, hugely opulent hotel had hired someone who considered it appropriate to inform newly arrived guests that if they wanted to go and sit on the roof terrace and eat they'd have to spend over £120. It was a special occasion and money wasn't on my mind but the insinuation was,  if you can't afford it...leave. I protested but he wasn't to be swayed.

We opted to have lunch on the ground floor bar terrace. (no minimum spend, our gormless receptionist informed us)

We were saved by a familiar voice. A warm and welcoming face, well half a face behind a mask. The wonderful and wholly professional Giuliano Morandin, The Dorchesters bar manager. Here is a man who has served everyone who has ever been anyone. He seated us, welcomed us and recommended the chef special and the tiramisu which we had and it was delicious, all washed down with a beautifully chilled bottle of Veuve Cliquot champagne. After coffee Giuliano asked if we might like to see the dining area on the roof terrace as well as showing us Liberace's piano that had been in the bar when we first went to the Dorchester 2001.

He saved the day. He is why we love The Dorchester. Take note upper management, our spend, though considerable was irrelevant. Our welcome was tantemount to our returning and Giuliano ensured we would. Many thanks, nicely saved.

",5,2021,05,02
130,Lunch ,"I love the Dorchester normally and  was looking forward to terrace lunch first time out of lock down Tom the chef was circulating and very pleasant and that where it ended apart from the music that we thought was was very good. 
We ordered sharing plate that weren’t and were quite a average the prawn scotch eggs over powered by the curry sauce the waterloo cheese in a pithia with honey £45.00 !!
I had the turbot that I thought was very good but my wife and daughter had the cod that was bland and cold!The chips were very salty to almost inedible. 
This was balanced by pleasant but a serviced that was barely acceptable in a low grade pub. 
If your going serve wine make sure it’s good our bottle at £78 tasted like a £10 bottle from majestic 
I would have been happy to pay over a £100 but didn’t think the food warranted it 
So even Alain Duccasse cooking next week I won’t be going back 
Michael Lambert

",2,2021,04,21
130,Tom Booton and team are fabulous,"The final word is GO! I felt like I was at a wealthy friends BBQ. Tom and team were so friendly I felt welcome and happy. The roof top had a party atmosphere and the band were so good. The langoustine and wild garlic mayonnaise were utterly perfectly amazing. I may pick through a few items that I would change, maybe less salt on chips. But for goodness sake, give the Chef a break, he created magic on a roof with no proper kitchen. I LOVED IT!",5,2021,04,18
130,Very disappointing,"We had “lunch on the roof” yesterday to celebrate a 60th birthday and it was awful!
The food was well below average quality with the leak dish not washed and full of grit! To start it took 30mins to get served with  our bottle of champagne and the Chablis. 
Very very disappointing and all in all very unprofessional !
I did not make a fuss at the time as it was an important event for the 4 of us that WAS spoilt however I shall expect the +£500 back or a credit and an apology. Why not?",1,2021,04,16
130,Amazing tea time,I had an afternoon tea at the Dorchester and really it was one of the best i have ever have..the welcoming was very good a professional lady at the reception..the guy in the restaurant was just nice and very helpful introducing and explaining every dish it was a real moment of pleasure,5,2020,12,25
130,Great Service and great knowledge of food.,"Visited on a lunch for business.
I was very happy with the service offered and the great knowledge the people had on food and wine.
A really pleasant experience.
It was very professional and the food was fresh and and looked delicious.",5,2020,12,18
130,Afternoon Tea!,Attended on a Sunday (13 Dec) just before lockdown in London again! It was my wife's birthday (she took me to the Sanderson for mine last year) the afternoon tea was fantastic and the service impeccable..they offered great advice for drinks and food for the kids and even gave a number of complimentary items...they played Happy birthday on the piano for my wife and also gave a lovely cake...unbelievable considering how busy they were during service! Wasn't the cheapest but cheaper than Sanderson (according to my wife!) Suprising as this was miles better...thank you Dorchester :),5,2020,12,14
130,Pure luxury and the best hospitality ,"What a beautiful hotel, it is pure luxury, glam and sophistication. Every detail is thought of and the hotel at Christmas is decorated to an exceptionally high standard and looks wonderful. 
With the current Covid situation the hotel has totally complied with the regulations and we felt safe at all times in the hotel. 
The staff, every single one are friendly, helpful, polite and make you feel very special. 
The food at breakfast was simply divine, fresh food, well prepared, excellent presentation and served by lovely staff, Alan our waiter made us feel very welcome. 
The luxury of the room, the cleanliness and the special touches of champagne and chocolates in our room was lovely. 
A truly wonderful stay. One of the nicest, friendliest, most beautiful hotel we have had the pleasure to stay at. 
We will 100% return. Thank you The Dorchester for our gorgeous stay. ",5,2020,12,11
130,"Excellent service, staff and room ","We stayed here after ordering my new car from BMW Park Lane.
The staff were lovely and very helpful.
We had the lovely afternoon tea which both the food and the staff was excellent and also was given a delicious slice of cake with Congratulations piped on it.
Our room was so comfortable and lovely decor,the shower and the toiletries were lovely and smelt great.Everything very clean and the bathrobe was lovely and snug.We had breakfast in the morning which again was delicious and lots of choice of food.
Receptionist was excellent, helpful and always smiling and also the Doorman ,always helpful and smiling.It was raining so the Receptionist ordered a taxi for us which arrived quickly to take us to Victoria.Thank you for our lovely stay with you.I must say the flower arrangements in the hotel were lovely and smells lovely.Hotel was very clean everywhere.",5,2020,12,09
130,Always again,"We visited almost all restaurants of the Hotel - Several times. Great offer, quality and service in general. Excellent after-noon tea, very traditional. Very busy during the Christmas season. Great tea selection! Wine offer is good. Pricing for regular qualities is not very reasonable but ok and in-line with the location. Rarities and older vintages are too much overprized. Nice selection of prestige Champagne by the glass. ",4,2020,12,07
130,Just .... WOW!!!!!! Christmas Pods. OUTSTANDING.,"I don’t know where to begin.., from start to finish this experience was spectacular. 

We were staying in “ 45 park lane” across the road from the Dorchester when I spotted the Pods/ Christmas trees and fires, from our balcony, we were ever so lucky to get space for the following evening. 

As we turned up at our reservation for 6pm, with it being dark the Christmas lights and trees looked stunning, 
We were greeted by an wonderful gentleman who showed us to our pod. We was a little concerned at first about being cold! But definitely not!! It was lovely and warm (heaters under the table) the decor is just.... dreamy.... fur throws and cushions beautiful linen on the table. 

We had the set “ Winter garden menu”  £160 per person including a glass of Verve Clicquot La Grande Dame. 

Canapés to start which were presented so beautifully on a large wooden tree like stand. 

For our meals, We had selected the : 
Starter-Chestnut soup ( best soup we’ve ever tried) 
Main- côte de boeuf ( this was just mouth watering)
Pudding- now... the menu choices looked lovely but we kindly asked if we could have a chocolate sundae... this... well....Chocolate ice cream mini marshmallows and HOT pouring sauce... yes!! Absolutely beautiful. 

So the food itself was 5* it was up there with the best food we have ever eaten. It wasn’t small potions either so we left stuffed to the brim. 

It was the outstanding service !! 

Every course which was delivered was by the chef themselves! They each in turn explained and described the meal which had been prepared and the background of the ingredients. 
I would especially like to thank “ Mario Perera“ 

He is a truly talented chef, and his food is outstanding. 
So a huge thank you to Mario. And for tweaking the deserts for us. You made the evening even more special for us. 

We also had a Bluetooth speaker in the pod, we were listening to Michael Buble watching the fires snuggled in the blankets... drinking a glass of champagne. Bellies full of amazing food. An experience we will NEVER forget. 

THANK YOU!!!!! x",5,2020,12,06
130,The Promenade,Very great experience at The Promenade at Dorchester Hotel. Very efficient service and great staff. Francesca the manager make us comfortable with her smile and took care of us so well for a first experience there. We will be back for sure for teas and coffees. The live music was perfect for the late afternoon too. Great place I do recommend it,5,2020,11,03
130,Brilliant ,"As we are stopping at The Dorchester it would be rude not to have afternoon tea here. The surrounding was absolutely lovely and so relaxing, the food was so nice with plenty of flavouring. They also catered absolutely brilliantly for my wife who is a vegan and she also loved the food. Our server Anuar was brilliant, and with a great sense of humour always made us laugh and went out of his way to cater for us. As I’m not a big tea drinker I decided to have vodka with my afternoon tea. I would just like to say a big thankyou to Anuar, the chef and everyone at The Dorchester for their kind generous hospitality. ",4,2020,10,19

130,Amazing afternoon tea!,"We had afternoon tea at the Dorchester and it exceeded my expectations. The service was very attentive and personal and the staff were very friendly. The selection of sandwiches were great and very tasty, along with the scones, teas and cakes. They replenished our plates as we desired and we left feeling full to the brim. We went for my birthday and they brought out a surprise small birthday cake and sang to me which was a lovely touch. Highly recommend!",5,2020,10,15
130,The Dorchester ,"This Hotel never fails to amaze me. I've been here a number of times and it's always so welcoming. The staff are warm and friendly and always happe to assist. The pianist in The Promenade was fabulous and took on requests too 😍
If you've never been, this is one of my top 3 places to visit as well as good food!",5,2020,10,12

130,Anniversary delight ,We stayed here for a 2 night anniversary break after having to cancel 3 holidays due to covid! Every touch is designed to make you feel like a million dollars and I cannot understand anyone who can complain about the service! Everyone knows every intimate detail so you feel you are receiving individual and unique service! The hotel is immaculate and there is a quiet serenity about it! The spa was one of the most luxurious I have ever had the pleasure of visiting and the beautiful touches such as champagne and cake on arrival and some beautiful oils for my bath were just on another level! There is luxury and then there is here! I came away feeling like the luckiest person in the world! ,5,2020,09,21

130,Fantastic Opening Weekend Stay,"My wife and I stayed to celebrate our anniversary last Friday and Saturday. This happened to be the re-opening weekend for the hotel so the place looked outstanding and it was clear that all the staff were delighted to get back to work and serve their customers again. 

We were given a very warm welcome upon check in and promptly had an incredible lunch at The Grill to kick off our weekend. Food and service both outstanding, very innovative menu. 

Loved our room, super comfy with some really great features. We slept very well both nights, and especially liked the pillow spray as part of the turn down service. 

On our 2nd night we had dinner at China Tang. Such a treat to get dressed up, have an amazing meal without really leaving the hotel! 

Another real highlight for us was having a few drinks in the Promenade both evenings, whilst listening to the exceptional singer and pianist. Certainly beats a lockdown evening in front of the telly!  

Really great to stay at a hotel again in London and enjoy all the luxuries that come with an outstanding place like The Dorchester.

130,Was fantastic became disappointing..,"It’s my time to book my annual trip and I’m considering booking else where; the berkley or even the hard rock for example. My family and I try our best to come to London once a year and we preferably choose to stay at the Dorchester given that we have a reasonable price. My last stay was rather disappointing with my room service bill amounting to a whopping £1,100 over a 3 day stay. The girl who took my order was an Italian girl whose English was clearly not her first language.. every time we received the order it was wrong. I requested an Eton mess (it is not on the menu and they have always done a fantastic one for me every year) and she said she had never heard of this and immediately rejected my kind request. I was surprised because the girl before was able to tell me my order before I even told her..now that was 5* service. My wife was very disappointed every morning with her breakfast,. The tea wasn’t even be made properly, we even had on one occasion a bucket of ice delivered to us without the champagne we had ordered! It has really gone downhill. I have been visiting for the past 10 years and now I am considering of booking another hotel for this year.",3,2020,07,20
130,Wonderful,"Having enjoyed a fantastic wedding celebration last July, we returned to the Dorchester in March (just prior to the UK lockdown) for a couple of nights whilst on holiday. 

It was so wonderful to be back, and to be greeted by the staff, espeically Valentine, who planned our event last year. It was also so lovely to see Phil and the new florist boutique, which I highly recommend for some of the most stunning flower arrangments in London.  My mum loved her Dorchester Rose, so thank you Phil.

We were kindly upgraded to a Mayfair suite, that are beautifully appointed and an excellent size. The attention to detail in all aspects of the hotel and its service is 
exceptional. 

Thank you also to Valentine, who Kindly arranged us a tour around town in the 1964 Rolls-Royce Phantom V Limousine. This is something we missed out on last year. It is simply the most wonderful way to see London! 

We had a delicious lunch at the grill for a friend's birthday. There is usually a great set menu that I highly recommend trying. 

We were hoping to be back in July for our anniversary - however this has been postponed, of course. We are hoping to be able to return in December instead, depending on the outlook by then. In any case, I highly recommend staying at the Dorchester. 

Wishing all the team all the best & to stay safe,

130,不錯，但仍可更好,"早年一次11月底到倫敦，原本考慮是 Ritz 或 Lanesborough，甚至已在 Ritz 訂了房間及下午茶，可惜他們竟然搞錯我的房型。雖然來回幾次 email 後對方終於“知錯”，但我已對 Ritz 失去信心，最後改才訂了 Dorchester。其實 Dorchester 的位置不近 Underground，不過去海德公園 Winter Wonderland 算方便，加上酒店有英式下午茶也有法式米芝蓮，Dress up 吃完換回牛記笠記是方便之極。

酒店的大堂不大，前檯也小，相對其客房數目以及酒店的級數，我是有點驚訝，不過 check in check out 也剛好沒人排隊。前檯的服務生親切有善之餘，也十分“靚仔”，見我是香港人，帶我們到房間之餘亦談了數句，原來他父母在香港工作，所以他對香港非常熟識，可說是他另一個家。

我們訂的 Executive Deluxe，約五、六百呎左右，有公主牀，獨立衣帽間，亦有向著海德公園的露台。大理石浴室看來很美，有浴缸亦有獨立花灑企缸，可惜設計不佳：浴缸則只能放水浸浴，沒有花灑；企缸只有固定花灑（不是 rain shower），但地方太小，只能開著企缸的門在外邊先調教好水溫，任由水花四濺，否則太熱太冷也沒地方退開，所以未洗澡浴室的地板便濕了。更差的是 Housekeeping：Mini-bar 竟然有上一留下的半份印度薄餅；風筒的手柄有裂縫，甚至看到裡面的銅線。打電話叫人來處理，結果等了十多分鐘。這水準的 Housekeeping，到底有沒有換牀單？我是不敢想像了。

如之前所說，我選擇 Dorchester 的其中一個原因，是餐飲。不過英式下午茶的體驗很一般：桌子小而且排得太密，我們一行三人，只安排了一張約莫 3 呎乘 3 呎的方桌，差點放不下林林總總的餐具；而且我的坐位剛好與對面檯的食客面對面，感覺尷尬。而且服務我們的侍應有點失魂落魄，搞錯我們三人的茶具之餘，上 Scone 時竟然夾不起，問我們可否自己拿/夾？！發生在這級數的酒店，實在是難以想像。幸好食物不差，各款三文治均有水準，Scone 是在吃完三文治才上，保持有足夠的溫度，比起香港人習慣一次過上齊三層架的食物是好得多了。甜點是聖誕節主題，整成聖誕老人和雪人等模樣，但由於吃不完打包了過後才吃，味道不便評價。Afternoon tea 索價每位60-70磅起跳，還未計服務費，比香港貴很多，但倫敦的頂級酒店都是差不多這價錢，是否值得就見仁見智。

相對下午茶，Dorchester 的早餐比較得我心，因為早餐除了有兩間餐廳可選，還可以選 room service - 不另收費。相對於穿著整齊去吃沒有服務的自助早餐，還不如一邊梳洗，一邊叫人預備 English Breakfast - 客房還有露台景觀。如果吃厭了 Bacon，想來個日式早餐也可，而且一樣有水準。若說 Dorchester 的和朝食還不能與頂級溫泉旅館相比，亦要知道溫泉旅館的西式早餐一般也不會有 Dorchester 來的豐富。

至於 Alain Ducasse...我只吃了午餐，也只能說服務正宗而嚴謹。Alain Ducasse 是全球擁有第二多米芝蓮星星的人，他的頂級 3 星餐廳誰敢說不好吃？只能說我不懂欣賞。不過可以說的是，歐洲的 3 星，我喜歡的包括 Yannick Alleno, Paul Bocuse, Joachim Wissler, Peter Knogl......也只有 Alain Ducasse 這間，我不懂得欣賞。",4,2020,06,06
130,Positively underwhelming,"We were booked for breakfast in The Grill for a special occasion. 
Surprised to find we were completely ignored on arrival for at least 3 minutes before being shown to our table (despite several staff looking at us).  
Coffee and juice was served promptly but we then waited ages for our order to be taken, only to be told we then had to be quick as the kitchen was about to close!  
Oh - and that we couldn’t order the champagne breakfast from their menu) as their license didn’t operate before 11am (despite the restaurant being closed by then!)  When the breakfast orders were eventually served, we were told the kitchen had made a mistake and one of the orders wasn’t ready, meaning it arrived sometime after the hot orders 
All in all a rather disappointing experience for a top rated hotel.",3,2020,04,26
130,Good experience ,"The hotel is well located, it’s close to Hyde Park. The hotel is traditionally luxurious and elegant. Classical decor, very charming, the hotel staff is welcoming and warm. The Michelin Chinese restaurant is tasteful. Despite the issues with its owner, the Dorchester is a great choice for a luxurious stay in London ",5,2020,04,04
130,Loved it ,"Have been to so many properties within the Dorchester brand. This is definitely my most favourite one! Classical decor, very charming, the hotel staff is welcoming and helpful. Perfect location, it’s fairly close to Hyde Park! Everywhere’s within a walking distance! There’s even a Michelin Restaurant downstairs! The Promenade is gorgeous. You’ve got to try the tea there. It’s recommended for sure! I don’t even know why people are still boycotting this hotel. I don’t boycott a hotel/airline for political reasons, I’d only do that because of a bad experience! All the best!",5,2020,03,28
130,Lunch,"Went for lunch with my son who lives in London ,I was visiting him for a week,the experience was wonderful from walking in the hotel wow, service second to none and for the food we enjoyed every course.The waiters where amazing very helpful and showed us round the private dining area was really interesting,we loved it from start to finish and took away some beautiful memories.",5,2020,03,11
130,Staff discriminates against Eastern women,"If you are Russian or look like Russian please avoid staying in this hotel. The Dorchester discriminates against Eastern women. 
I have been coming to their spa for many years, so whilst refurbishing our home, I decided that The Dorchester would be a good alternative to stay in- wishful thinking!
I and my husband booked the Dorchester for 1 week. 
In an era of Covid-19 virus outbreak, The Dorchester also fails to provide hygienic standards to its guests. 
I was going to the gym every day but I was unable to use it properly because it was incredibly dirty and some machines full of disgusting sweat! The third day, I made the staff aware that one of their guests leaves the machines in a despicable hygienic state and urged them to clean. They failed to clean and I still could not use them. This fact led to an incident of me being called “uncivilized”, “Go back to your country you Russian b***” by this guest just because I politely asked him to clean after himself since the staff failed to do so.
The Dorchester’s management completely failed to solve the situation, moreover they deepened the feeling of discrimination. The manager of Dorchester, Mr Robert Whitfield, sent me an email asking me NOT to use the spa & the gym anymore during my stay! 
May I remind you that this is a very expensive hotel and this is not the way to solve an incident of this scale. Instead of sending some flowers to my room, a box of chocolate and actually asking BOTH guests not to attend for a while their facilities, this manager asked only me to do so. The way he put it when meeting my husband and I in person: “the other guest has been staying for many years in our hotel”. 
Wow! Another discrimination! I guess it is a case of who pays more in Dorchester hotel.
Needless to say we immediately checked out and payed a handsome bill of £7000 for only 5 nights. 
Not to mention their rooms are dark, old and they don’t even care to change the fruit plate. I had the same rotting tangerines since the check-in.  
Amazing service, amazing discrimination policy.",1,2020,03,08

From the minute we walked in we were met by Kate and she was very welcoming and couldn’t have done more! I had a few requests for my boyfriends birthday and they were all in place when we went to the room. The room was amazing we had a huge suite. Dinner in the evening was also great! They also gave a surprise birthday message for his desert! Will defo be going back and big thanks to the guys at Dorchester!

Made even more special by visiting behind the scenes at this 3 mitchelin star kitchen.
Every course was a work of art and the most amazing 5 hours relaxing in this gorgeous hotel.
The last word to the staff, the best service and exceptional care.

Niek at Check-in was efficient, personable and fast.  One of the smoothest check-ins I have had in any hotel.

Bobby from the Concierge desk made sure that I had all of the information.

China Tang's provided great cuisine.

130,"Good, but not world class","I have been very fortunate to stay in quite a few world class resorts around the world. This, whilst in keeping with that British charm, does not quite hit the spot for a £1,000 a night price tag. On short, I expected more.

The rooms were beautifully and tastefully furnished, but I don’t expect the heating to malfunction in the middle of the night. This was fixed the next morning, but I do expect a little back in return. I did recieve a sincere apology, but when I’m paying that kind of money, I at least expect a bottle of wine or chocolates as an apology.

The service overall was good, especially in the dining area. I always judge my stay based on value, so that is why I am not giving it the full five stars.",4,2020,01,31
130,Weekend away with friends,From the moment we arrived at the front door through to our departure we experienced the most amazing customer service experience. We have stayed in many world class hotels but the Dorchester Collection has surpassed and exceeded our expectations.,5,2020,01,22
130,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"I recently had afternoon tea here with two friends and we had a wonderful time. The setting for afternoon tea is beautiful, we couldn't believe the magnificent roses were real and we really enjoyed being able to watch the coming and going in the lobby from our seat. All the staff were wonderful. The tea was very well paced (they don't bring all the courses together, they bring sandwiches first then scones etc) and this meant we didn't eat too quickly. Great selection of teas and coffee. It is very pricey but I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion or celebration.",5,2020,01,21
130,Top-class service,"The Dorchester has become over the years our number one go-to hotel and it has become better in the last couple of years. Many of the floors and rooms had become tired and these have now been very well upgraded with amazingly comfortable beds and modern amenities and the traditionally fine bathrooms (separate showers). The service remains outstanding so if you are willing to pay for it, this is luxury at your elbow.",5,2020,01,18
130,Afternoon tea,"A birthday treat and what a treat !!! From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, I had to keep pinching myself I was really here. Absolutely everything was perfect, from room to food to atmosphere. The staff were the stars of the show, such service and friendliness, guiding us through the meal. 10 out of 10 seems to be a disservice, should be 100 out of 10. Thank you all so much x",5,2020,01,15
130,Fantastic,"We have stayed at what I think are some of the top hotels in the world.  This is no exception.  What a fabulous place.  Don’t expect any bargains but from the room, to the bars, to the restaurants everything was gorgeous.   Finest room I have ever stayed in.",5,2020,01,12

130,"Personalized Service, Luxury and comfort only begin to tell the story","The Dorchester arranged for us to be picked up at Heathrow airport. We were greeted by Fadima who took us to our room. She was kind and responsive when we discovered that they had assigned us a smoking room. That was not going to work for us. She quickly got on her phone to arrange for another room. This time on a non smoking floor. She guided us about the amenities in the room. She set up our wifi which failed when I tried.
She also was able to get appointments for my wife for her nails and me for a massage. I had tried on line without success.
Gita the receptionist in the Spa has an amazing disposition. She assisted me in making an appointment for my pedicure and haircut.
She took me to the relaxation room yo wait as I was early for my appointment.
I overheard her end of a conversation with a lady who wanted to cancel an appointment that was scheduled for a couple of our away. She was so gentle and professional in arranging a more convenient-time and not having to charge a cancellation fee. It sounded like the lady really appreciated her efforts.
We ultimately had an Executive room that is wonderful and plush. It has a giant walk in closet. There were two men who brought our luggage and helped to set up the suit cases exactly where we wanted. The bed sinks in with both structure and softness. So comfortable.
It also has the pillow top for above the mattress.
I was able to get some clothes cleaned and pressed quickly. In all our travels we have learned to pack less and have clothes cleaned.
The first night we ate a light dinner in the Bar. They were warm friendly and served tasty food.
I received some great help from Emma Fievez who works in the guest relations department.
This was right up her alley. I had ordered some liquor from Provence to be shipped to me at The Dorchester. One of the two boxes appeared missing. Emma called to place in Provence to get the tracking number. (She speaks French) She also called them to make sure that the second box would arrive by Monday. It did and I am so thankful fir her persistance.
Niek on the front desk was really nice and helpful, warm and welcoming. He was interested in making our stay a wonderful experience. Anwar who waited each morning at breakfast attended to my wife’s needs. Including pouring her English breakfast tea out
Of a very heavy tea pot. My wife said “he was helpful and accommodating and nothing was too much trouble”
The doormen have all been great without exceptionThe housekeeping ladies have been wonderful. Twice cleaning up a mess from when I was sick.
The concierge have been great putting up with all my requests for help for restaurant suggestions and reservations.
They have also helped get my liquor packaged so it can go with us as luggage on our flight home. I am sure that I am forgetting a couple of the concierge people’s names. But Harry Deavy the Head Concierge, Nikola Bozannovic, Stuart Aubrey and George( I forget his last name) all helped constantly.
Francesca Gugliemtti the manager of the Promenade and The Spatiserie, and Meret Brunner were helpful in resolving a problem for me. Thank you ladies.
We really appreciate the personal attention that we get from everyone at our home away from home when we are in London.
I wish that I had asked the name of the nice lady who helped me get the items being served at the New Years Eve passing hor d’ourves. She went out of her way to not only get them for me get them printed just like the menu. Look up my review of that New Years Gala. Also look up my review of the massages that I had.

130,Needs refurb,"I felt like I was at Grandmothers house, a bit musty, and needing a remodel. Carpets
in hallways and room need to go. The shower in my exec suite was terrible, not only did the faucet come off in my hand, you could not reach into it to turn on without soaking
the floor. Dated furniture etc. I understand old, I get it, but I've been to plenty of 5 star
hotels in Europe that have retained their charm after a remodel. On the other hand, the
Bar was nice and the bar staff excellent, this was last Friday, I'd give them 5 stars.",3,2020,01,01
130,Good but not Amazing...,"I have travelled to London on many occasions and have stayed at numerous of the top hotels. I had walked past the Dorchester many times and always wanted to stay here as it is of course one of the most iconic hotels in the Capital. I finally tried this out for a few nights last year with my wife. 

The floral arrangement upon walking into the lobby is very impressive and the promenade area where we had breakfast was really lovely. The location in Mayfair is of course excellent. The staff were all efficient and friendly. 

I just felt for the money the hotel charges (which is a lot, even by 5 star London standards) that it could have been a little better. The let down to me was that the hotel felt slightly tired and the room wasn't really all that special, considering the prices being charged. I'm glad to have ticked 'the Dorch' off the list but it just wasn't as memorable as I expected or wanted it to be. 

We stayed at the Savoy after this hotel and that was a cut above. The Dorchester is still a lovely hotel which is why I have given the review a 4/5 (very good).",4,2019,12,30

amazing experience. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat without a shadow of s doubt. Top of the class!",5,2019,12,29
130,21st birthday dinner ,"Beautiful hotel and restaurant with a lovely ambience and tasteful  decor 
The dinner was lovely 😊 and well presented and the staff were very polite and attentive 
Great place to get spoilt for a special birthday treat ",4,2019,12,13
130,Fabulous Hotel and Experience ,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights last week. 
The whole experience was fabulous, from the welcome at the front door, reception, restaurant and bar service, housekeeping and concierge, every member of staff was friendly and very professional .
We were always recognised personally with our name, and any preference acknowledged.
Everything was just perfect and I couldn't have asked for more.
It was our first visit and we will definitely be back.
I wish that I had asked for more names to acknowledge each member of staff personally. However each one was a star!
",5,2019,12,12
130,High Tea,"I asked for the top thee High Tea experiences in London and the Dorchester was named as one.  I was not disappointed.

High Tea experience takes about two hours.

Make a reservation in advance.

Dress smart casual +

They have options for gluten and dairy free food and sweets choices.

Multiple tea choices to pick from.

Elegant decor - was Christmas decorated already.  Absolutely beautiful.

Piano player in back was wonderful but not overpowering.

Service was impeccable,  excellent attention to detail.

Food was delicious, well explained, properly timed.

Despite small portions, its a large meal and fairly rich, so bring your appetite and expect to carry some away with you in a box.

Must do..",5,2019,11,30
130,Wonderful Stay at The Dorchester,What an amazing stay at the Dorchester. The staff was very attentive and made our stay extra comfortable. Our room was beautiful and bed so lux! The bathroom has an amazing soaker tub which we both enjoyed daily! The housekeeping staff kept our room immaculate. The hotel bar was a fun place to visit late night for a night cap and the piano bar was fun for drinks prior to dinner or to meet up with friends. I highly recommend this lovely hotel,5,2019,11,17
130,Luxury hotel ,"I had a luxury stay in this luxury hotel, the hotel staffs are friendly and always with smiley faces
The staff gave me a personal touch on my stay and they assisted me with all my wants on spot ... enjoyed my stay and loved my time in the hotel ... if you have time you can enjoy the restaurants in Dorchester ",5,2019,11,15
130,Wonderful,"A fantastic place for a wedding event a once in a life time experience 
There’s nothing that you could fault them with staff were extremely friendly with a wonderful service the whole day was absolutely fantastic ",5,2019,11,05
130,Great Stay,"We decided to stay at the Dorchester as we had a dinner reservation at Alan Ducasse to celebrate our wedding anniversary . It was great. on being shown to our room, they had decorated it with balloons, a lovely chocolate cake and a bottle of champagne , all a surprise and on the house. As the booking had been done through FHR, they had informed the hotel and this was our surprise. 

Thank you so much for making it memorable .",5,2019,11,05
130,Great Stay!,"We have been staying at The Dorchester for the last four days and are checking out tomorrow. Great stay at all levels. Wonderful breakfast, superb afternoon tea, great à la carte meals. But what really makes the difference is the quality of staff. So professional and smiling at all times. They all make you feel at ease with tailor made style service. We have had an exceptionally beautiful room on the sixth floor overlooking Hyde Park. Special mention to the hotel manager Mirko Cattini, Artemis from the restaurant, Ermis the extremely efficient wide smile bell boy and head barmaid Denise making star cocktails. If you like sweet and sour options we strongly suggest the Old Cuban and the Up in Smoke (if you fancy a strong taste). Keep up this great job! We‘ll be back for sure!",5,2019,11,04
130,One of the best Hotels!,"Which buildings are you most excited to explore during your time in England? Whether you’re an architecture buff or you just want cool angles for Instagram, this visit won’t disappoint. You will definitely love your stay here.",5,2019,11,03
130,Amazing hotel,"The hotel has great location, fantastic view, wonderful decorated and luxurious rooms with big bathrooms. Technology is really updated. Everyone in the hotel is really polite. A really luxurious stay. Enjoyed every minute.",5,2019,10,31
130,Champagne Afternoon Tea,What an amazing afternoon. Highly recommended. The staff couldn’t do enough and very attentive. Food was fantastic and the desserts were out of this world. A very special treat was they overheard us talking about a birthday and a lovely little birthday dessert arrived and the pianist started playing happy birthday. ,5,2019,10,24
130,Very Fine Accomodations,"My wife and I recently stayed here for a week.  Couldn’t have had a more welcoming, comfortable stay. Rooms are excellent, roomy and fresh; and the staff is superb. The super front desk staff even sent up a surprise when they learned it was my wife’s birthday! Enjoyed a live crooner in the bar, again with top notch service. Looking forward to our next stay. Cheers, Dorchester!",5,2019,10,09
130,Traditional English Luxury,"This is one of my favourites. Pure English luxury with those fine details that make a big difference to an overnight experience away from home.

Amazing breakfast, luxury traditional room decor with staff that go above and beyond to make your stay one to remember.

Location is great for shopping in London’s west end and you are spoilt for choice with restaurants close by.

It’s worth the money, even if it is for a special occasion just to tick off the bucket list.

We will be back! ",5,2019,10,08
130,Why Not,We had booked for 4 afternoon tea in the promenade. The decor is just stunning especially the smell of fresh flowers. First we had drinks and oysters at the bar which were devine. High Tea was lovely our waiter explained everything as tea and sandwiches  etc arrived. Probably one of the best high teas i have had. We were lucky to see a wedding come through which was so beautiful and colourful. I would recommend High Tea here for the experience. ,4,2019,10,07
130,One of the finest hotels we have ever stayed at,"the location of the hotel is near perfect---near many wonderful places for lunches and dinners and in a perfectly beautiful section of the city.  the staff is just amazing---they are so sweet and so helpful.   the concierges are a 'dream team' , the decor is simply breathtaking,  the breakfasts served to the room were just amazing for us---they got every single thing we ordered each morning perfectly right.  so if i could give this hotel 10 stars i certainly would. oh and i also just want to add that even the doormen are fantastic, extraordinary helpful at all times and everyone at the place seems to know you after a short time there.    beware the restaurants in london though---while many wonderful places exist a majority of these are extremely extremely noisy.",5,2019,09,19
130,"The Ultimate Hotel, on the Planet!🌈🦄","I spent a week here in July, like wow. It seems to be as close to perfection as a hotel can get. If you get the chance stay here. The staff, restaurants, the bar, are all perfect.
The spa is run by goddesses, the best massage of the summer for sure.",5,2019,09,14
130,Just ok,"Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed with my stay. There were certainly good points. Firstly the history of this place is priceless. And it is the grandest of properties. The staff were most professional. But for the price point....I just expected more. The room was quite small. There was no expreso machine or tea kettle. I also thought given the price, maybe there might be some more modern touches like modern lighting. No such luck. I did like the hotel overall, but I guess I was just expecting more for the price tag. Sorry.",3,2019,09,14
130,Perfection really does just happen...,"We recently hosted our wedding party at the Dorchester. We also stayed for one night in a Park Suite. 

'Perfection just happens' is the Dorchester Collection's tag line. Although you must be aware there are many people working behind the scenes to deliver it, the hotel does a fantastic job of making you forget. Although we were one of three events happening that day, and two of many guests staying, the team made us feel as if we were the only ones they were attending to. We have stayed in some wonderful hotels, yet is something we find to be truly rare in hospitality.

From the first email inquiry to the event, the team at the Dorchester were absolutely wonderful. Nothing was a problem. Living abroad, we arranged most things from afar, yet the team went to great lengths to ensure everything was arranged to our liking, keeping in contact regularly. I want to particularly thank Valentine, our events manager, who is absolutely fantastic, a true events professional and a delight to work with. We would also like to thank Phil for the wonderful flowers, our floor manager Martyn and Emily who were all so helpful on the day.  Everything went so smoothly, the cuisine was delicious and the serving staff all excellent. So many people have told us what a wonderful, unforgettable time they had, and we have been thrilled to hear this.   

The event spaces (we were in the Holford and Orchid rooms, however, this goes for all spaces) are stunning. As you would expect, they are maintained to an exceptionally high standard. I must have looked at over 20 possible event spaces in London, and The Dorchester had by far some of the most beautiful. With the wonderful team working there, I do not think you will go wrong!

We also found our Park suite to be beautifully appointed. It was spacious, elegant and a lovely backdrop for some photos. Thank you again to Valentine who arranged an early check-in, meaning I had some extra time to get ready at the hotel.

The only thing we would have liked to have done is a tour in one of the hotels vintage cars. Unfortunately, no drivers were available on Sunday morning. However, we will certainly be back, and so we will be sure to arrange this on our next trip.

Thanks again for such a wonderful event and stay. 

Jo & Mohamed",5,2019,09,10
130,The Spa is heaven! ,"We visited second time to have a massage each in the Spa. We surely were impressed from the first visit. Second time was 10 out of 10. The Spa is so beautiful, immaculately clean, great facilities with smiley faces and amazing customer service. The relaxation room is  extremely comfortable to start a peaceful journey for a massage.
The receptionist Gita welcomed with the biggest smile, assisted on every query, demonstrated her outstanding warmth in communication. The therapist Roxanne was super friendly, gave advice with the deepest care and did a great massage. 
These girls made me feel like I am in heaven. It was a real heaven for a time spent in this extraordinary spa! So happy! This staff makes you to want come back even before you left. ",5,2019,09,08
130,An other memorable dinner,"I was still in a birthday mood and I cited one of my dearest friends to join me at the Dorchester for dinner. As always I was treated like a VIP although when I asked for the. manager  John Smith was told he had left. The service and the food was as always perfect, but I thought John was a very special person and he was the one that made me welcome from my first visit some 3 years ago. I wish him all the luck in the world in his new employment. My friend was very impressed with the place and enjoyed every mouthful. The decor and the ambiance is second to none. I have the feeling that my guest will visit again in the not too distant future. I had pork my favourite meat and she had fish, although the place became very busy we still had all the attention and we had an enjoyable evening. I was given a card with the name of the assistant manager.",5,2019,09,04
130,Dorchester experience,"Just visited for my wife’s 60th bday and it could not have been nicer with the most attentive, delightful, and genuinely top drawer service I’ve ever experienced. Every one of the staff cared, often remembered your name, and were so very pleasant. Now the price wasn’t cheap, but it lived up to the expectations and made for a great memory and stay. Almost didn’t care about the price given the experience. So glad we stayed there and hated to leave.",5,2019,08,16
130,Finest London hotel,"One of the Finest hotels in the heart of London . Situated in park lane, you will find some of the most beautiful cars and one of the most beautiful decor. Sit in one of the plump sodas at the lobby restaurant, sip afternoon tea in style. It’s one of the few places that truly embodies English culture. With perfect views to Hyde park and spacious rooms. There is nothing not to like about the dorchester. ",5,2019,08,10
130,Birthday treat,"Got taken here for a surprise birthday treat for afternoon tea. On the positive side, what a beautiful building, with great decor and plush fittings and fixtures. The flower arrangements are breath taking. The food was amazing too. Sadly it was the service that let it down which is why I've knocked it down a rating. It was still a great experience",4,2019,08,08
130,Good food,"Had meal in Chinese section of Dorchester, food was ok, not as great as I expected, place was busy. 
seatings were v close together to fellow customers, overall ok, may not visit again, 
overall ok wish.. thanks anyways to the staff for looking after ",4,2019,08,06
130,The best high tea,"We had excellent service, delicious sandwiches, scones and cakes, accompanied by champagne and of course various teas. Everyone who visits London should have high tea at the Dorchester! The Promenade was ornately decorated with the most beautiful flower arrangements. ",5,2019,08,04
130,If You Want To Feel Posh For Two Hours . . .,"Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester will transport you from the hustle and bustle of everyday life to a time when life was slower.  The Promenade is a luxurious room scented with fresh flowers.  Linger over tea and delectable finger sandwiches but save room for the pastry tray.  The tarts and cakes were the essence of a percect bite - or two - intensely flavored, decadent, and indulgent.  Service was impeccable while not being pretentious.  Our server was an absolute delight!! I highly recommend splurging on tea at the Dorechester!  You won't be disappointed!",5,2019,08,04
130,Afternoon tea with children.,"We had the most amazing afternoon tea experience at The Dorchester today. For a birthday treat we booked Afternoon tea which included complementary children’s afternoon tea (August 2019). Our two boys (age 6 and 8) loved their plate of child-friendly treats. We really appreciated a visit by Chef to check if the children’s afternoon tea was Ok. The boys wanted him to know later that the milkshake was the best milkshake ever and the cucumber sandwiches were their favourite. They were happy to get extra sandwiches offered. 
On to the adults...the afternoon tea was lovely. We ended up taking some away at the end as we were full before we finished everything. The tea experience was spot on. The service was brilliant with helpful, friendly, attentive waiters. The venue felt impressive yet relaxing. We all agreed it was a brilliant birthday treat which we won’t forget in a long time.",5,2019,08,03
130,Most beautiful  luxury hotel on Park Lane.,"Most beauutiful luxury hotel on Park Lane.  A haven of tranquility. I must first say that we only fulfilled our reservation after the Sultan -hotels owner- reversed his decision on the new policy of stoning gay men to death in Brunei !! Of course this does not reflect the the beliefs and attitudes of the staff here but you cannot line the pockets of a man who was to get his minions to  stone gay men to death !! London is not short of luxury hotels and we all have a choice.  Enough said !!
 The hotel  is just beautiful. Impressive entrance and seamless check in. Public rooms and bedrooms are extremely well appointed and have the wow factor but in an understated way. Classical and elegant. Afternoon tea here is a memorable event and dining in the Grill was a very relaxed experience- food and service was off the scale in terms of quality  and enjoyment. The  flowers displays in hotel are worthy of any Embassy or Palace ! My favourite London hotel and only the cost prevents me from staying here more frequently now that I have retired to Malaga ! We will be back- hopefully in December  - when the Christmas decorations will be amazing, once more !  My final comment has to be a regarding the staff who were  just wonderful at every point of interaction. Attentive but not overbearing. True professionals in the hospitality sector. Greatly appreciated. Anyone can spend millions to create and furnish a luxury hotel but it is the staff who make the world of difference.",5,2019,06,22
130,One day stay at a fine hotel,"My wife and I were able to stay at the Hotel Dorchester on 12 June 2019 after a Barcelona to Tilbury, (London) cruise. It was a pleasure to stay at this fine establishment in such an historic area of London. Regretfully, we only had one evening to take in this wonderful hotel before our flight home early the next morning. What we did see and experience was top level service, food and lodging. 

The greeting at the door by the very professional staff continued through the check in, breakfast service and escort to our room. The beautiful room, 201, was a pleasure to behold with views from multiple corners. This is a top notch establishment with a staff that compliments the English traditions so very well.",5,2019,06,20
130,Birthday treat,My husband took me here for afternoon tea wait was my birthday and we were in London on holiday. On arrival we were treated by very friendly staff. When we were seated at our table a very friendly waiter came and introduced himself when the sandwiches arrived he explained what each one contained they were absolutely delicious next to arrive were scones with 2 types of jam which was lovely then cakes arrived after we had eaten the waiter brought me s small cake with a candle. I would like to thank all at the Dorchester for making my birthday so very special,5,2019,06,17
130,London Elegance & Hospitality At It's Best,"Its been years since I stayed at The Dorchester but it was nothing short of sensational. From check-in to departure I couldn't fault the service, care & attention of everyone in this hotel.

There was a peaceful calm about the hotel and indeed a genuine care towards making our stay everything a 5 star experience should be in London.

I have read all the media about the issues surrounding the ownership of The Dorchester but lets not forget the staff & people who work in these hotels and their commitment to hospitality and service.... they are the people who make these hotels run from the General Manager to the Kitchen Porters this is a hotel that cares about its guests and not its ownership.

Loved and will most definitely be back!

Bravo Dorchester your one of the greats!",5,2019,06,16
130,Stolen or taken by mistake? regardless horrible service,"I was really looking forward to my stay at the Dorchester but it turned out to be really disappointing. I found my check in and overall service underwhelming but average. However my trip took a turn for the worse when upon packing up my bags I realized that one of my white dress shirts was missing. I addressed this while checking out and was met with ambivalence and an overall lack of urgency on part of the check out staff. It was almost as if this kind of theft was normal to them and didn't surprise them. During my flight back home I talked it over with my colleague and we both assumed that I would receive an email the minute  we landed on Friday the 24th addressing my missing shirt. I didn't receive any such email and upon getting home realized a t-shirt was also missing. I wasn't till I sent an email on the 25th did the hotel respond to me. I made sure to never accuse anybody but was clear that only hotel staff and my colleague had been in my room, btw they had a means to check on this since they had a camera fairly close to my room. Regardless the Dorchester thought it reasonable to tell me that my best option was to contact the Met police to file a claim of theft all the way from New York city. Not sure about the rest of you but when I book a 5 star hotel, not to mention for 5 days, this is not the kind of service I expect. At the end of the day whether my items where taken or mistakenly removed what I found really shocking was the hotels response and overall tone. They clearly don't care and all I can say is buyer beware.",1,2019,06,13
130,Very English and the best in traditions,"One of the best hotels I ever stayed in. I don’t know what to write cause it’s an awesome place with best service and very nice people at reception and concierge desks. The gourmet restaurants have so refined and elegant design and delicious meal by all means.
Location is the best, it’s Mayfair the Westminster Abbey is very close.
I enjoyed my stay here and wish a lot of prosperity to all employees and managers",5,2019,06,12
130,Personable and memorable experience,"We stayed at the Dorchester just over a month ago for the first time, and we were more than impressed by the whole experience. 
All staff members were very helpful and warm, and it was apparent that they felt proud to be working there. 
Over our four nights' stay, we were able to sample the restaurants, the bar, the spa, and the gym, and they were all brilliant. The butler service (part of the suite experience) was really non-fussy and efficient; we were particularly impressed when the butler replenished our cake, even before we had thought of asking for more. 
The overall sense for me was that at the Dorchester, luxury was delivered in the way exactly as it should be; that is, just low-key but precisely and attentively. 
Thank you for a wonderful time, and we hope to return very soon.",5,2019,06,10
130,A Wow Hotel,"This hotel has put a lot of thought into everything. Elegance is definitely the name of the game here. If you want to impress or just feel like you are in luxury this is the hotel for you. I like staying at this hotel. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. 
I especially love the key to the room. Just so different :-)",5,2019,06,09
130,Wonderful service,"Visited  here with my children I cannot fault it, from start to finish was a wonderful time, food was fantastic customer service great highly recommend visiting this Hotel as it’s a lovely experience in amazing central location .",5,2019,06,06
130,Mayfair Must,The Dorchester is a wonderful hotel that's part of the Dorchester collection....if you've stayed at any other of their hotels you know they excel at service.  The staff was very accommodating.  We were there during the Chelsea Flower Show so the lobby was a little more festive than normal with flowers and faux-grass.  The location is perfect.  It's in a very walkable Mayfair neighborhood.  The hotel bar is also a fun spot to pop into regardless if you are a hotel guest or not.  We will be back to this hotel again!,5,2019,06,05
130,Birthday treat,"Thoroughly enjoyed a delicious tea with champagne today.
Beautiful surroundings, friendly approachable staff, delicious finger sandwiches, scones and cakes.  Surprise 'birthday cake'.  Couldn't eat all these goodies, so a 'doggie bag' was provided to bring home.
Pianist played delightful background music.  A memorable, lovely treat!!",5,2019,06,04
130,Quintessential London Perfection.,"The Londen Dorchester Hotel was a fine experience.  The hotel was spotless, staff attentive and helpful, and food excellent.  Our room was absolutely perfect. Clean, comfortable, and well maintained.  The Hotel was walking distance to all we wanted to see and the trains were not far from it.  We stayed at this Hotel since it was part of the Dorchester Collection and planned on also staying at Dorchester Hotels in Paris and Rome which were equally superb. Our first trip to London was perfect and we thank the management and staff of the Dorchester.",5,2019,05,27
130,Outstanding.,"We have just stayed here for our anniversary. From the moment you arrive the doormen, the reception staff, everyone in fact that you meet, cannot do enough for you. The hotel itself is beautiful. The room we had was amazing. Extremely comfy bed and gorgeous bathroom. Very well located for shopping etc. Want to come back every year now. It’s indulgent and expensive but worth every penny. Even sat having breakfast in the Promenade three tables down from Sir Anthony Hopkins! Incredible place and staff were brilliant.",5,2019,05,19
130,Fabulous stay,"We have just have a fabulous stay at this fantastic hotel. From the minute we drove onto the four-court the staff were fantastic, polite and Helpful. Throughout our stay all staff were exemplary hosts. Our room was outstanding. The table service was excellent as was the food. We stay in London at least twice a year, this was our first stay at the Dorchester Park lane. If you’re looking for a treat this is the place to stay. We will be back to celebrate our wedding anniversary later this year.
The valet parking works like clockwork.",5,2019,05,18
130,Just perfect,"Went and had a little afternoon champagne and nibbles for a friends 50th birthday treat ..   what a fabulous place..   obviously you expect pure class and elegance and that is exactly what you get. 
Had a lovely couple of hours here and it was such a lovely experience..  the bar staff were friendly and polite and accommodating... if I was able to go here more often I would...  definitely pop in here if you’re in this part of London...",5,2019,05,18
130,Going downhill Fast,The quality of service has declined very rapidly. While the prices have increase. I find the staff at reception not very hopeful. They act more like Robots. Ms. Emma Deflorian is quite incompetent. She never deals with real issues.,1,2019,05,12
130,ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL,"We have stayed in this great hotel before however I decided to take my family on a two night weekend break at this hotel.
We had a just left a family funeral and my car broke down so we ended up on the train.
I made sure that I kept the hotel informed about this to make sure we would have no problems.
When we arrived at Euston station I realised that my card was left in my car.
I rang the hotel and informed them this and they assured us that we could still check in with my driving license.
We checked in with no problem but I asked if we can get a twin room as there was my wife and daughter.
Within five minutes we had a call saying they needed a payment for the room.
I came to reception and I was told that I had to pay the full amount.
I said that they knew we did not have my card and they insisted that I ask friends to come and pay or if I did not pay we would have to leave the room. 
This was at 23:10 and our last train had just left, I said to Aires the night manager that I rang and informed the hotel that I did not have my card and the hotel said it was fine to check in. I was going to the bank tomorrow morning to sort this out.
I have never been so insulted in my life I had to call my bank which was closed at that time and they heard this. I was told we had to leave the hotel and this was at 23:30 on a Friday night with my wife and 17 year old daughter. Who at this stage was crying and I was then escorted to the room and collected our luggage.
I am in hospitality myself and none of my managers would do this to a family to be turfed out in a hotel knowing that we are from the midlands and our last train had left after they said we could check in. If they had said no when we rang we would have simply gone back home and came down the very next day.
I found the whole experience a complete and utter embarrassment for my family and I. 
Thank you for being so understanding",1,2019,05,10
130,worth every penny,We returned for our 40th anniversary to be warmly greeted. They upgraded us to a suite with champagne balloons cake. Thank you so much the staff as always are delightful on hand helpful . My old man loves hard rock cafe and they made sure we got a table and did not have to queue. Best stay cant wait to return,5,2019,05,05
130,Amazing,"breath taking service Michelin star food in every outlet keep it up, from check in until check out we couldn't find a room to judge or complain this place is a flag ship of all Dorchesters all over the world",5,2019,05,03
130,Brilliant room,"One of the best, great service. Gave us a cake as it was our aniversary and the whole experience was wonderful. We walked down to the Hilton and went to Galvin at windows so great view and met Fred (first dates).",5,2019,05,02
130,Nothing short of exceptional,"My partner booked for 1 night to celebrate my birthday. She couldn’t have chosen better. Arrival relatively early but our room was prepared x upgraded for our celebration with a room that oozed luxury and an enormous bathroom with the best tub x just perfect x cake and balloons greeted us and the stay just got better. Great cocktails in the bar x a superb dinner in the restaurant x a great nights sleep before a hearty and delicious breakfast.

The staff are lovely x friendly and kind x willing to make everything perfect. As we checked out the manager came out to say his goodbyes x a lovely touch. The Dorchester is my favourite hotel and a return I am so looking forward to.",5,2019,05,01
130,Excellent customer service,"I spent one night at the Dorchester and had an excellent experience. Not only is the hotel beautiful, and in a gorgeous part of London, but the customer service really went above and beyond expectations. I am nursing and forgot a charger for my breast pump. After calling about 5 different stores with no luck, I called reception not expecting much, but they forwarded me to the concierge who tracked down Gerald in their tech department who came up to my room immediately to see the pump. Then he came back about 10 minutes later with a charger! Saved me from a very uncomfortable 24 hours until I could get home. I’m so happy that I made that mistake while staying at the wonderful Dorchester hotel.",5,2019,04,28
130,Ball room function,"Absolutely fantastic.
I didn't expect food as good as this at a large function- most hotels do cut corners & supply poor ingredients but dress them up very well. Here we actually got fairly good ingredients. The food could have been hotter though.
We sat with the F & B Manager- a very pleasant fellow.
Staff that pass in the corridor should make way for guests even if they don't bother greeting them- we had to let two young french boys pass by us in the corridor. Not the best hospitality I have experienced.
Lovely toilets!",5,2019,04,23
130,Absolutely wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel,"This is a slightly late review as I stayed in this hotel in March but I will never forget it. 

The stay was a surprise for a proposal and the hotel staff were excellent on every level.  We even got a free room upgrade to the Mayfair Suite which was by far one of the nicest hotel suites I have ever stayed in.  I have not one complaint at all - it was beautiful.

Following on from that, we had butler services, turn down services and 'congratulations' nibbles with wine and the hotel was was great with accommodating our little one (with a robe, slippers, toiletries, baby bath and lovely cot and organised child care for a day).  

Overall, I was very impressed and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2019,04,16
130,Perfect Hotel and Great Location,"We were here for business. Everything about the place is class, from the Doormen, to the Concierge, Housekeeping, Decor, Meals and Service. Decent gym, but with Hyde Park across the street the walks/jogs were beautiful as well. Buckingham Palace, Churchill Bunkers, Harrod’s, Trafalgar Square, and all of the beautiful parks, tulips and shopping are within walking distance. The Dorchester is expensive (as is all of London) but they don’t disappoint.",5,2019,04,13
130,Beautiful Hotel but very poor service,"Had a client meeting here with dinner and overnight stay. The meeting rooms were cold and staff couldn't fix the AC. We weren't provided with all ordered equipment and lunch was not on time.

The overnight stay was ok, but the rooms we expected weren't what we reeived. They were dark with not much natural light. House Keeping didn't do a turndown service, and many other small things missing compared to experiences at similar hotels in London.

Staff tried, but very poor. Again, had better service with other hotels of a similar tier. Won't be returning.",2,2019,04,11
130,Lovely but not for us again ,We took our large family for afternoon tea and whilst it was lovely it certainly wasn’t worth the value versus other afternoon teas we have had across London. We also stayed there afterwards and we couldn’t fault anything with service or accommodation however it just didn’t suit our style as fairly traditional in decor etc. Still worth a visit though if money is no issue! ,4,2019,03,27
130,Fabulous Hotel !,"The Dorchester is one of the nicest hotels in London.

My mum and I were spending the day In London to celebrate our birthdays and decided to try the Dorchester, we were not disappointed, the decor is beautiful and omg the fresh flowers everywhere are just stunning everyone we interacted with was so professional and helpful and no request was a problem. The promonard bar is beautiful with the piano player and the champagne cocktails are to die for and the staff and mixologist at the bar are phenomenal, please do not hesitate to visit this amazing british elegant establishment, can not wait to return    ",5,2019,03,24

130,Opulence,"What an amazing one night stay! We decided to head off from Bristol early in the morning to make the most of our weekend in London, we arrived at the hotel (we were going to have breakfast and drop our bags) at around 10am, to our surprise our room was ready! This meant we could check in straight away and enjoyed a full day of our room. The service in The Dorchester is unrivalled, only such service I’ve ever experienced has been in Dubai. The history of the hotel is incredible and the decor, although probably the same as it was 50 years ago is beautiful and classic! The rooms are large and beautiful and also have some high tech features. The doormen are extremely helpful!

Definitely my favourite hotel in London.",5,2019,03,04
130,Mayfair Magic @ The Dorchester ,"Just enjoyed the most incredibly indulgent stay at this spectacularly opulent Hotel, which simply oozes, classical-sophistication, without being at all stuffy or pretentious! 

Despite the exceptionally impressive grandeur interiors, with every minor detail considered & carefully executed, such as the most fragrant & stunning floral displays throughout reception & the main promenade thoroughfare; the warm, attentive & personable service was consistently excellent amongst all the Staff; all of whom were impeccably presented & immaculately groomed. 

Nothing was too much trouble for any of the Dorchester Team & every single Team Member was superbly welcoming, approachable & magnificently hospitable & friendly, from the Door-Staff, to the Concierge, to the Front of House, House-Keeping, Bar-Staff, Grill-Waiting-Team! 

This is an extremely well ran Team, that clearly operates in synch to achieve such exacting & exceptional standards in every aspect of the Hotel. 

Particular thanks to Maria, whom conducted the most professional, slick & efficient check-in process; extending the ultimate in world-class welcomes to this breathtakingly beautiful hotel. 

The warm herbal tea upon arrival was extremely refreshing after a long journey & being personally escorted to our accommodation by Maria, was a further personal-touch, which was very much appreciated & which also provided the opportunity to share valuable information about the facilities, the locality & acquire some tip-top-tips! 

Our accommodation was simply stunning! Immaculate throughout, with traditional, chintz style, furnishings, yet still providing every modern-day convenience; the bath robes were bright-white, fluffy, as were the towels & the evening turn-down Service was a welcome touch & created the perfect wind-down to prepare for the most comfortable nights sleep, upon the beautifully crisp, white linen bedsheets.

Breakfast was a ceremonial affair, with every taste, whim, fancy & palette catered for; the place settings were perfectly laid & the overall presentation & wonderfully brilliant service, lead by the most charming & attentive, Adele was all-round excellence. 

The live piano performance within the bar upon Saturday evening created a gentile ambience to enjoy & in which to relax, whilst sipping cocktails & bar Tender, Luca was especially helpful & attentive in his provision of outstanding service. 

Thank you all for making our stay so fabulous; it was magical in every respect & we can’t wait to return.

130,A wonderful weekend for my sister in law's big birthday,"I would like to congratulate the team at the Dorchester for providing my family and friends with a wonderful weekend for my sister in law's landmark birthday.
We stayed for two nights had excellent rooms with great meals at the Grill and the Tang restaurant. What really made our stay brilliant was the Dorchester team. Emma the Guest Relations Manager excelled, The head waiter at the Grill on the Friday, The Tang team and Lee the concierge who helped us get a taxi on our departure all showed great skill and experience. Thanks. I look forward to my next big birthday.",5,2019,02,03
130,One word wow,"Book this as a treat for my husband and we where not disappointed it’s an amazing hotel and from the minute you walk through the door your so well looked after the rooms are amazing almost to the point you don’t want to leave the room, my husband was in love with the tv little things. We had dinner in the grill which was a fantastic experience and the concierge helped me arrange a Rolls Royce to take us to the royal Albert hall. Thank you for helping to make our 36 hours in London very memorable.",5,2019,01,28
130,A wonderful stay at an iconic luxury hotel.,"There is something special about the Dorchester and it lives up to its luxurious reputation.  The staff throughout the hotel are friendly and engaging, especially in the restaurants and bars. It only took a day for them to remember my name, where I liked to sit in the elegant Promenade and what special requests I had at breakfast each morning.  
The Grill and China Tang were superb for dinner and the bartender even remembered the wine I preferred and made excellent suggestions based on that.  

The rooms are full of luxury touches and are large by London standards and the location in Mayfair is ideal for shopping, close to Bond Street and Knightsbridge.

There is a warmth to the Dorchester that is not always found in the five starts hotels in London and no one seemed too busy not to talk with me about my stay and to make me feel at home, especially the doormen and Les Clefs d'Or Concierges. 

The hotel decor is just right--elegant without being stuffy and contemporary without loosing its classic elegance.  For me, it is the ideal hotel.",5,2019,01,18
130,Elegance in London,"Another lovely stay at The Dorchester this time during the festive season. The hotel was so beautifully decorated. Great location by Hyde Park. Food is excellent. Staff is wonderful and accommodating. You will always feel like a VIP. It’s a truly elegant hotel. Didn’t use the Spa this time, but have before and highly recommend it. Tip: Always order dessert. The pastry chef here is amazing! ",5,2019,01,10
130,"Overrated, but there is a market for this. ","I have stayed here on numerous occasions. For what you pay, honest there is nothing special. My favourite thing is the spa. It’s the only good part. Lovely relaxing room where when you are, you feel like out of this world and the steam room. That’s all. The facilities end here. The room service is ok and the food is average. The rooms them-self are just basic. The hallway is the flowery carpet and heavy on the eye. Very old school if you like this sort of thing.  The room service come around few times through the day to draw curtains in the evening etc and give you a top up of anything. Everything is chargeable like a pack of sweets is £12 and drinks pricey in the mini bar. But very well stocked. My rating is average. ",3,2019,01,06
130,Waiting for my next visit! ,My last stay at the Dorchester was in December 2016 and I decided to give it some time as I was not 100/ pleased with my stay. Well we came back 2 years later and level of service is better than before and staff is more attentive. Staff at the promenade remembered us ( after 2 years) doormen couldn’t be more pleasant reception staff went out of their way to give us early check in and late check out. Housekeeping is more thorough  than before . I personally do not like the carpeting of the corridors and of the promenade but it actually suits the hotel . It is part of the ambiance. Only drawback room decoration is lovely but a bit on the dark sad side. ,4,2019,01,05
130," the most luxurious hotel in London","In my opinion its the most luxurious hotel in london💕

The staff is beyond lovely and nice, and helpful. With that extra warm touch that makes them different from the rest !",5,2019,01,01
130,Wonderful Hotel,"What can you say about a hotel like this. It is a very traditional hotel, very elegant and very well located. The rooms are very spacious, the amenities provided in the room are nice and the service is amazing. All the staff greats you very politely and are there to assist with anything you need. The beds are amazing and you can walk to Buckingham Palace, Horse Guards, St. James and Green Park, Trafalgar Square or Picadilly Circus. It is expensive but worth it.",5,2018,12,29
130,Leena with Room Service was very accommodating!,"My family and I stayed here for Christmas! It was a beautiful hotel, and the whole staff was amazing - especially Leena. When I did not pack accordingly, she went above and beyond in order to help me out. It was very kind! I’d love to go back!",5,2018,12,26
130,I loved it!,"I loved staying at The Dorchester London, although it was a deluxe King room but I would say it's the largest I've seen in London. the service is wonderful and the location is just perfect. I would totally consider it for any upcoming visit to London.",5,2018,12,22
130,The Dorchester,I loved staying at The Dorchester in London. The service was great and the room was so spacious.  Loved the room decor and the whife marble of the bathroom.

130,"How I wanted to love our stay for our anniversary, but oh what a shame….","My family and I have stayed at the Dorchester MANY times over the past 15 years and held celebrations there, as well as for my 21st birthday when we booked out 14 rooms and I stayed there with all of my friends. In short, I love this hotel – my favourite. But on this occasion, it was oh so disappointing, and even more disappointing that I had chosen it to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend.
When you are paying almost £900 for one night (and that was their cheapest room  - superior room), you expect to receive world class quality and for everything to be perfect. Of course mistakes happen, but the myriad of mistakes that we encountered were unnecessary and annoying. I informed the hotel that we would be celebrating our anniversary well in advance of our stay. We arrived at 12:45pm and were told our room was almost ready (this was brilliant as check in was not until 3pm ). We were off to a good start. We arrived early as we had booked in at 1pm to enjoy their Festive Afternoon Tea. The receptionist asked us if we wanted to order a morning paper, and we went with the Sunday Times. We were then promptly seated at tea, and given one of the best tables by the piano which was greatly appreciated. Our waiter Denny was outstanding. The hotel acknowledged our anniversary and bought a small cake with candles to our table. At around 2:30pm, off we went to our room.

The room was beautiful – clean and fresh, room 820. Another anniversary cake was waiting for us, along with some mince pies and oranges. Shortly after 3pm I called down to reception to request tea making facilities as the Dorchester no long supply these as standard in the room. 3:10pm – a knock on our door, a lady from housekeeping asking to take our room service tray away – I said she must have the wrong room but commented that we did request tea making facilities. She apologised and left. 3:25pm – I called reception again as nothing had arrived yet. 3:40 pm – I called again. 3:50pm, lady from reception called me to make sure the tea had now been delivered, and I said no. She sounded embarrassed. 4:05pm, the tea tray arrives, and the man apologises for the delay. If there are going to be such delays and problems in delivering a simple tea making set, why not just offer this facility in all of the rooms like they used to?! It is appalling that I had to wait so long for a cup of tea. 

At around 4:30pm, I decided I wanted to take a bath. There was no bubble bath etc in the room, and so I called housekeeping and they said they only have bath salts, so I said that’s great and to please send some up. 50 minutes later the bath salts arrived. Unacceptable. 

The next morning when we woke up, (around 10am), we opened our door to collect the newspaper that we had ordered the day previously, which in the past would be hung on the outside door handle. It wasn’t there. I called down to reception, and they sent one up. We did not have to wait too long so that was good.But again, just an annoying mistake.

We then ordered breakfast to our room. The guy that took my order was fantastic and patient. The breakfast arrived around an hour later (no problems there as the guy on the phone had advised us of an approximate 45 min wait). The lady on the way up had spilt our coffee, and we said it was fine, but she said no she must go and change it anyway as she had forgotten one of our other items. I also noticed that the cereal I had ordered was incorrect, and so she took the wrong cereal away also. It took her 20 – 25 minutes to return which again is just unacceptable. We normally like to drink our hot coffee whilst our breakfast is still hot! So three things were wrong with breakfast and it took a long time to rectify. When all these things happen and you're staying in such a world class and expensive hotel, it is just so frustrating.

On check out, I queried the price of our afternoon tea. The man who checked us out said the charge was £95 plus service per person. I showed him the email from The Dorchester for when I booked the tea that said it was £95 per person which included VAT and the 12.5% service charge. I have no problem in having had to pay the higher charge, but not when it was incorrect and we were advised something else via email. I attend the Christmas Carols tea every year and they always tell you the price in the booking confirmation and they have never made this mistake before when charging.  He apologised and immediately amended it. There was also a £22 charge on there for something else, I asked if this was for the tea supplies and he said no, it was a minibar item. I said we did not use anything from the mini bar. He apologised and took it off.  Just yet another annoying incident which is careless and not what you expect when you are staying in one of London’s most prestigious and expensive hotels.

The man who checked us out did not ask how our stay was, but I told him I have stayed there many times and that I have some feedback. He wrote down all of my points above (or I think he did at least), and he said he would pass it onto the manager who would be in touch 'later today or tomorrow'. We checked out 4 days ago and I have not heard anything, all i have received is a survey request asking how my stay was . I only passed on my feedback as it is such a shame really, and I hope a one off, but who knows. This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and next time we are staying at a top London hotel I may reconsider and stay at one The Dorchester’s competitors.

As a final note, the temperature in the room was not great. You were able to set the temperature on the A/C control via the telephone screen, but it did not make a difference and the room kept changing temperature but never actually got to the ‘desired’ temperature. Poor shower temperature system as well. Could either have the water absolutely boiling or cold or freezing – no in between. Both of these things I did not complain about whilst there as we were only staying for one night and it didn't hugely bother me, but I did mention it on check out just so that the hotel could look into it for future guests in that room.

All of these things are not the end of the world, but as I said before, when you are paying a very expensive rate (which we were very happy to pay based on my previous experiences!), you do expect everything to be perfect. I would say to anyone that hasn’t stayed there before, to give it a go, as it is an extremely special hotel, and one would just hope that our experience was a one off.",2,2018,12,13
130,Feels like home,Decided to stay overnight for a wedding. I have to first  say the staff are outstanding. The Spa staff incredible! They bend over backwards to be helpful. Lunch in the Bar was really tasty plated beautifully. The downside for what you get for  a superior deluxe double was dark small. Sumptuously decorated and a fantastic nights sleep. But the toilet flush if you’re a woman with fingernails I do warn you need to use the back end of a hairbrush or you’re going to break your nail. There was no way to lock the room at night as well . Also had to ask for  cotton wool Ear buds  shower gel for the bath body lotion etc. as they only give you a small amount of hidden in the shower which only had a fixed head .was disappointed the water only arrived in the room at night. I had to go to the spa to bring up from there. Very disappointing when you pay that  sort  money would expect the best of the best in the room . ,5,2018,12,10
130,Excellent,"I had a lovely meal for the Every Woman event - the service was amazing and food delicious. Afterwards had a few drinks in the bar and again, the attention to detail was impeccable. Thank you Dorchester team.",5,2018,12,10
130,Christmas Party,"Had our first night at the Dorchester. Very friendly welcome from all, no waiting at reception - we were quite early so the room wasn’t ready. Headed in to town and had lunch. All ready when we came back. 

The room was very clean, all the team very courteous. Ordinarily I am more of a fan of modern hotels but the Forchester has a certain charm and definitely, the very best breakfast I have had anywhere in the UK. Probably only matched by the Four Seasons in New York. 

Overall a great stay.",5,2018,12,10
130,Luxury ,"My mother, sister and I go to London every year for our annual Christmas shopping trip and this year we chose to stay at The Dorchester and want a great choice.

The staff were all very welcoming and attentive, our room was gorgeous and setup for the 3 of us upon arrival with beautiful chocolates and fruit in the room.

I was very surprised how quite the room was for such a central location.

We chose to eat breakfast in the lobby and with the beautiful Christmas decorations it had a lovely festive vibe, breakfast was OK the cooked food came out cold but there was a delightful selection of pastry’s which were a nice treat.

We could not get into the restaurant as it was fully booked but if we stay again we will try and make the reservation beforehand. I was a little surprised that after 6pm the hotel bar had a minimum £30 spend per person. ",5,2018,12,09
130,Constant Issues with Heating and A/C,I have stayed at this hotel many times. One of the biggest problems with this hotel is air circulations. My recent stay ended up complete disaster. I woke up at 3am with 29c temp and in the morning it was 17c. Management  finally moved to another room. This is not the first time that I have had this issues at this hospital. This has been on-going for almost 2 years. Previous manager would actually look at this.,1,2018,12,02
130,Amazing breakfast ,"I have stayed at the Dorchester for three nights and really enjoyed the service and the food. The breakfast was just amazing and they serve everything you could just think of and the presentation of the food is very nice. 
The room was just ok, the view from the window wasn’t so great as it was facing the back yard with waste bins. The TV was placed in strange position on the right hand side from the bed which was very uncomfortable to watch. Surprisingly the  bathroom was very old with two taps (one for cold water and another for hot) which was very annoying and the water in the shower was very hard to adjust due to also having two taps with the hose attached to it. Not sure why is it a 5 star hotel?!
However the staff was very polite and very attentive and the food was amazing. ",3,2018,11,25
130,Perfect,"From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, from the doorman (Nick?) that greeted us to the lovely Sophie who checked us in and showed us to our incredible suite (we were spoilt with a fabulous and unexpected upgrade to a Mayfair Suite!).   Even without the gorgeous spacious suite we would have been incredibly happy.  

The hotel and our room were so so clean, not a speck of dust anywhere - and I’m a clean freak.  

We had a wonderful buffet breakfast at the hotel each morning and had dinner in The Grill Dining Room on our last night of four nights.  

Every time we returned to the hotel after being out we were greeted like we were someone special and Sophie even called us by our name - I don’t know how many other people she would have checked in during this time but we were very impressed. The staff in the restaurants were also  always friendly, polite and attentive.  

The location of this hotel was perfect and we loved being so close to Hyde Park where we loved walking to get out of the hustle and bustle.  

We highly recommend this hotel and we dream of staying here again one day.  A big thank you to everyone who made our stay so wonderful and memorable.",5,2018,11,10
130,Grand hotel but service could be better,Stayed here with my boyfriend to celebrate his 21st birthday. Had a pleasant welcome and was impressed when showed to our room (a good size for London hotels). I had made the staff aware that my boyfriend was allergic to nuts prior to our stay and when we arrived staff had confirmed this was on the notes. At breakfast the next morning we after a bit of a wait we ordered the English breakfast which included a selection of bakery goodies. When this was brought out my boyfriend noticed that nestled in with the bread was some pastries covered in pistachio nuts. If he had touched anything near this he could have had a very serious reaction. When requested the waiter swiftly took them away and brought out a replacement... a few slices of cold toast. Made staff aware about this and they said they would feedback to the kitchen. On checking out the receptionist did bring out the manager to apologise but we were still expected to pay the full amount for breakfast. Definitely not the service I would expect from this standard of hotel. Allergies should be taken very seriously and better alternatives need to be offered.,3,2018,11,05
130,excellent service with a personalised touch.,"We stayed at the Dorchester from the 21st to the 23rd of October, From the time we entered the hotel we were looked after well, the quality of food was excellent with a personalised touch from Chef Mario.  the service was outstanding and we would definitely recommend the Dorchester and would definitely Patronise the Hotel in the future.",5,2018,10,29
130,Perfect End to our European Holiday,"We stayed at the Dorchester for 6 nights at the end of our Mediterranean Cruise. It was a lovely way to finish our holiday. The hotel is quintessential London. It is beautifully presented with the lobby full of fresh flowers. 
The rooms are very spacious, beautifully finished and very clean. They do lack a few of the modern touches, such as smartphone USB charges. The shower over the bath was very difficult to get in and out of, as the bath was so deep. 
We had an interconnecting room and the layout of the rooms and the way the rooms connected was fantastic. 
The food was outstanding and I would highly recommend the breakfast.
The service was not 100% as I was expecting from a hotel of its reputation. The hotel is in a great location.",4,2018,10,26
130,Excellent stay at the incredile Dorchester Hotel,"As a self confessed fan of Dorchester Collection hotels, I couldn't wait to stay at The Dorchester for the first time for my partners birthday.

After email correspondence with the hotel regarding the occasion and my requirements, they confirmed everything and were extremely prompt and professional in response.

On arrival, we were checked in and shown to our room. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded, which was incredible and made for a fantastic stay. There was a bottle of champagne and cake in celebration of my partners birthday.

Everything in the hotel is spotless, and is one of the true 5* hotels in London. Yes you will pay a pretty penny to stay, but the hospitality and service you are provided us second to none.",5,2018,10,25
130,Birthday stay.,"We stayed a few times but on this occasion it was for a birthday celebration it was a beautiful hotel as you would expect.

I will never get tired of the feeling you get walking into such an iconic hotel the history that has went before us just spectacular. 

The staff really go out of their way to help you want for nothing here. 

Ideally located for all of London's attractions too I would highly recommend it for both couples and families.",5,2018,10,23

Great experience is starting from the moment you enter till the moment you leave.

Stunning lobby. Great restaurants on board. Spa is good and the gym is more then good comparing to other hotel gyms.

Looking forward to stay with you next week again!

Fabulous cream teas and the best service ever 
Amy and Emily were fabulous at breakfast every day and Stuart was the best concierge ever and the ladies who serviced the room were fabulous.
The bar was fantastic and we met some lovely people...
My family loved visiting and were greeted warmly.  The hair salon gave me the best blow drys ever....",5,2018,10,02
130,Magnificent,"Needless to say, this hotel's reputation speaks for itself. As a newcomer to such a hotel, I was a little sceptical but it did not disappoint. The opulence and standard of service put it on a different level to any hotel that we have ever stayed at before. Despite such luxury, we found it to be tasteful and rather understated; commendably British. We were personally shown to our room and the receptionist went to a great deal of trouble to make sure that we were comfortably ensconced. When I spoke to her, on the 'phone, later, I asked if I was correct to assume that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room? She replied in the affirmative but then 'phoned me back, to say that she had arranged for a tray, with a kettle, etc., to be sent up to our room, at no charge. The comfort was second to none and we had a wonderful night. Breakfast was excellent and very relaxed. Was it worth the cost? I can't possibly say.",5,2018,10,02
130,“Perfection in London a Touch of Magic” ,"
The Dorchester, absolute perfection, a 5* luxurious hotel in every way. 
We return here lots as we are looked after so well. Every member of the team seems to try that little bit harder to please, from making our reservation to arrival through to departure 
A service  which goes above and beyond what other hotels offer, the team are all cheerful, helpful, happy and all have a natural kindness so much so you never want leave, no wonder we keep returning.
We celebrate our anniversary every year in this wonderful hotel and next year plan to take our family to let them all experience “The Dorchester” as it has some kind of magic about it a sparkle like no other hotel. 
We are always made to feel that we are the most important guests in the Hotel, a talent that all the staff have learned. 
We were served a fantastic breakfast  in our amazing room with everything you could imagine. 
The suites are gorgeous , huge, elegant, immaculate, every detail  thoughtfully included, beautiful fresh flowers, the list is endless and it always makes me feel a little emotional, it’s that good!
Not only is the hotel always exceptional, but the service is second to none. We will keep returning for this beautiful experience.

130,Truly a lovely hotel!,"From the moment we arrived we were 
greeted with professionalism and care from the front desk, concierge, cleaning staff, spa staff to the restaurant(s) staff. Our every whim was taken care of, and taken care of with heartfelt eagerness. My mum got sick on Sunday morning and a doctor was in our room within an hour and meds delivered at 7 a.m. with no problem. Throughout the day different members of the Dorchester inquired about my mum's well being, which was lovely. The Alain Ducasse restaurant is a must! Our tasting lasted almost 4 hours with brilliant food and service! I had a massage and a facial that was excellent, and I also had my hair blowout, which looked lovely! The flowers throughout the hotel are brilliant and the hotel is kept very clean. I highly recommend the Dorchester!",5,2018,09,23
130,A deserved Icon,"Stayed at The Dorchester in August and it continues to be classy, pretentious and up market.
Great  postion and full of class and great service.
Not cheap but reasonable value for what you receive. You can’t expect this caliber of hotel and service for less.
Great eating/drinking on property.
Wonderful gym and spa.
If you looking for upmarket with top service and you can afford the price then check into this London icon and enjoy the trip",5,2018,09,16
130,"Poor service, overrated","The service in this so-called ""grand dame"" hotel in London leaves much to be desired. I had many service flaws during my stay, more in line with a 2 star hotel:

1.  The air conditioner in my room broke in the middle of the night, and the room heated up rapidly, waking me up. I called service, and the engineer promptly arrived. It took him about 45 minutes total to diagnose and fix the problem. I appreciated this. BUT, there was NO followup and NO apology from the hotel management regarding this, despite my sleep being ruined my first night.

2. Also during my first night, at 11p, someone from the hotel mistakenly rang my doorbell, waking me up. Again, NO apology from the hotel.

3. I requested a coffee tray at check-in. Did not receive it. Had to call again to get it. This is a minor complaint, but still at a 5-star hotel where one pays a lot of money per night, I expect a top notch service.

4. I did not receive a turndown service my first night in the hotel.

The room itself is good, spacious.  The room bathrooms are nice. The hotel gym is nice, and well equipped with weights and cardio equipment.

The hotel staff is very detached in their interaction with guests, unlike other London hotels such as the Goring.

The elevators are blocked off at certain times, and it takes forever to get an elevator.

Upon checkout, nobody bothered to ask how my stay was. Nobody followed up on the above issues. Pretty pathetic.

Needless to say, I will not be staying at the Dorchester again.",2,2018,09,15
130,Without question five star," Versa was brilliant in helping us get unpacked. We asked for extra hangers. We had packed for more than three weeks of travel. Rome, Milan, Paris and now Lindon. He suggested and brought in a rack filled with hangers.
It has made getting our clothes so much easier.
The room upgrade to a Executive king has turned out to be plenty large enough. It gas a beautiful bathroom with a walk in shower. It also has a walk-in closet with a safe and more hanging space. 

The bed is very comfortable and the pillows are so soft, just the way I love them.
The people in the included breakfast were very 
service oriented. They even helped to pour the English Breakfast tea for my wife. The tea pots are so heavy you need a crane or help.
The breakfast has lots of tasty options.
The concierge people have been extremely helpful. George, Paul, Harry, Andy, Stuart and Nicola. What a team!!!
They introduced us to A Wong which is the best Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at. I went three times in three days. They also introduced us to Jamavar an amazing Indian restaurant.
I have posted both on Trip Advisor.
The doormen have been very caring and helpful.
The checkin process was seamless. Being a member of the Grand Luxury and Dorchester groups has turned out to give real perks.
Maya helped us through the room acquaintance process.
The housekeeping has been right on.
This has been a really good five star stay.
The location is so central to everything.",5,2018,09,14
130,Wonderful,"We did the three courses off open table and honestly it was amazing, food was delicious and the Eton mess was amazing. The decor and room was so elegant and the staff could not do enough for you. Thoroughly enjoyed, lovely relaxed atmosphere and we were able to talk in a quiet environment. We agreed we will definitely go back. Pics on Instagram. Lovehealthybella. I had the pollack (first time) and was perfect and nice and hot. Definitely recommend.",5,2018,09,03
130,There is non other when it comes to Luxery,The elegant and class that radiates from this hotel is second to non. The staff in my view are from a collection of the best groomed in the Hotel industry. The room was beyond words. Every part of the price paid for this stay was worth it. Life from the eyes of the wealthy... a stay to remember,5,2018,09,02
130,"Elegant, Sophisticated, Absurdly Well Done","I can't afford the Dorchester, period. But a very wealthy client of mine can, and did. I may have been one of the few non-oligarchs in the place, and had no Bentley or Rolls to park conspicuously out front. 

The Dorchester is perfect. And f perfect is what you seek, this is the spot. Before I checked in, I ate in the lavish dining room, and left my jacket draped over a chair. yet when I checked into my room, there it was. How do they do that?

I laughed a lot at The Dorchester, being one of the rare non-billionaires staying there. But I had a riot of a time. The rooms are exquisite, the meeting spaces first-rate, the food impeccable. You have to look past the snooty and over-privileged at this place, the crowd dripping with diamonds and fatigued by the world. But the staff are delightfully friendly, and the location cannot be beaten. Step across the street and you are in Hyde Park.

Will I stay there again? If another client steps up, yes.Otherwise The Dorchester will remain a delightful memory, a great London experience.",5,2018,08,30
130,The best hotel in the world!,"My wife and I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in many 5-star hotels, all over the world.
The Dorchester is simply the best.
There are no 'bells and whistles', just simple good British hospitality at it's very best.",5,2018,08,28
130,Life changing experience of culinary and service excellence,"Booked as an engagement gift, The Dorchester did not disappoint.  This establishment has been so good, for so long, it has become the standard by which all others are judged.  From arriving at the front door until leaving later that night, we were made to feel warmly welcome by all of the staff.  They are fantastically well trained, allowing a seem-less, consistent and knowledgable evening; for example, after leaving a half-finished cocktail glass at the lavishly appointed bar, following the notification of our table being ready, one of the staff went to the trouble of bringing it over from the bar to our table, just incase I wasn’t finished with it.  The art of knowing what a customer will need, before the customer knows they need it exemplified. 

We dined at Alain Ducasse following cocktails at the bar, which is highly recommended in its own right.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, pristine, yet tasteful, with tables well spaced so that any conversation can remain private.  The lighting is well thought out, allowing dark areas between tables, but gentle light on each table, making tables appear like islands in the room. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable regarding everything on the menu, including recommending wines to go with each course.  They are polite, respectful and jovial at the correct times and made sure that we felt special at all times. The food was, without sounding too dramatic, life-changing.  The tastes, flavours and textures of all the dishes are precisely judged and perfectly executed and portion size was excellent (certainly not too small!).  All of the flavours from the dishes we tried, came through beautifully, a trust gastronomic experience.

To finish the evening a French confectionary trolley was brought over and a selection bagged up to be taken away, a really nice way to end the evening and experience.

Wed like to pass our thanks to all at The Dorchester and Alain Ducasse for making our special evening unforgettable, thank you.",5,2018,08,25
130,Wonderful hotel,We visited the Dorchester Hotel while in London.  It is one of the finest  hotels in England .  The food and wines are superb and the decor will amaze you. It is right in Hyde Park with access to all the best London  attractions.  A stay here will enhance you London experience.  It would s a 5 Star hotel and restaurant and bar.,5,2018,08,22
130,"Overated, overpriced, requires an overhaul","This hotel group need to look at the competition. There are better 4 and 5 hotels in the area at a 3rd of the price. 

The rooms are old, cupboard pieces fell of in my hand, the TV is unsuitable in size for the rooms, too small. No refreshment centre for tea and coffee in the rooms as standard, which is very much expected of a hotel that markets as a ‘British’ traditional hotel. 

I waited at the bar for almost 10 minutes before being served as the bar area was left unattended, with out a courteous apology for being kept waiting. I ordered several items to the room that did not arrive. 

All in all, for close to £900 per night, this was very disappointing. I got the impression the hotel caters more towards Arab guests who appreciate the location and care less about the standards. 

We shall not be returning. Very mediocre. 

On the positive, the doorman were attentive and cheerful.",2,2018,08,15
130,"2 night stay for a ""Mini-Moon"" - Overpriced!","I was treated to a 2-night surprise stay by my Husband on the very day of my wedding! I opened the suite doors to find a lovely little chocolate dessert and a welcoming card which was great! However, the room was dusty and had not been properly cleaned (something you expect as a minimum at any hotel!). The breakfast menu that one hangs outside the door for next morning room service had also been filled out! I was also quite disappointed with the rooms themselves, very out of date. Overall, I would not recommend a stay here for the price, which is such a shame as I had high expectations as a frequent visitor of the restaurants in the hotel!",3,2018,08,15
130,Top service and class,"Excellent service from the moment you enter. As part of a trip to London with my Wife we treated ourselves to a week at the Dorchester, dinner at China tang also superb. We will be back! Staff all excellent, highly recomended",5,2018,08,13

130,Enjoyment ,This must be just about the best hotels anywhere in London and the world. From the helpful doormen into a lovely reception area and the 'Promenade'. Magnificent display of flowers and always to remember the Christmas illuminated 'model' made in gingerbread. A very special establishment. ,5,2018,08,08
130,Beautiful classic hotel,"Such an iconic place, you couldn't but enjoy a stay here. Great location. I am not sure if we'll be back though and I docked a mark as I felt it could do with a little upgrade and it doesn't have a bar to have a few drinks in. We were with 2 other couples and wanted to just chill and chat somewhere when we came back to the hotel but there was nowhere to go. 

Service and staff cannot be faulted in any way. They are pleasant, polite and could not do enough for you. ",4,2018,08,07
130,"Iconic, beautiful, top notch service","The Dorchester is elegant sumptuousness.  I stayed in a Studio Suite and my daughters stayed in a Deluxe Queen room.  Gorgeously appointed rooms, spacious, lovely.  We arrived to fresh fruit and champagne in my suite.  The next day my air conditioning wasn't working properly, so Jonathan (assistant front office) moved me without delay to the Belgravia Suite, which was an apartment so beautiful I never wanted to leave.  The Promenade in the Dorchester is a wonderful place where we had breakfast a few times.  We had fallen in love with this hotel last year when we had tea in the Promenade.  The staff here is, of course, attentive, efficient, and friendly.  Maria at the front desk checked us in and invited us to personally call on her for any assistance we might need during our stay.  I will never stay anywhere else in London!",5,2018,08,07
130,Awards ceremony,"Beautifully decorated hotel with an absolutely amazing ballroom for the event. Warm and friendly welcome and service for food and drinks was great. Very clean and immaculate hotel, I would definitely come back again.",5,2018,08,06
130,Everything was perfect - a memorable stay,"My husband and I stayed her for one night and thought it was absolutely charming. The service was impeccable; (any of the staff that pass you in the hallways say 'good morning' or 'good evening') our room was lovely - with a very fair amount of room for two people (a little entrance area with wardrobe and drawers, double bathroom with powerful shower and bath, a generous bedroom with desk and chest of drawers). The best thing though was the comfort of the beds and the pillows. There's even a pillow and duvet menu at the bedside if you want to replicate the comfort at home. Of course the location is magnificent and I would stay here again over almost any other London hotel.",5,2018,08,02
130,"Great Location, Timeless Class","A quick three night stay for business and everything was excellent. The rooftop suite where we had our meetings and the outdoor veranda for lunches were wonderful choices.  One is well spoiled at this hotel and the only negative is the lack of a casual dining, cafe type venue when all one wants is a decent coffee, a sandwich, light salad etc. with minimal fuss.  Service is top drawer.",4,2018,08,01
130,Great location,"Wonderful rooms, great location and super staff. All the staff made us feel so welcome and the room was amazing very spacious and lovely decor. It was the perfect location so close the the park and in easy walk of Sloane Square and Kensington.",5,2018,07,31
130,Stellar,"A very lovely stay in a Dorchester Suite (306 and 307).

Two points particularly stood out.

One was location - such an easy stroll for boating in Hyde Park or brunch at Mount Street Deli.

The other was people.  The quality of staff is an oft repeated compliment, but in this case it is difficult to overstate it.  We were struck by the combination of authenticity, “can do” attitude and never taking oneself too seriously.  It was a common thread - from a leisurely check-in and guided tour to a sumptuous (fun-packed) afternoon tea at The Promenade.  From explaining the range of iced coffees at Parcafe to accommodating a left field vanilla milkshake order at breakfast at The Grill.  Not to mention conspiring to smuggle out some of Mrs Woody’s favourite marmalade when momentarily out of earshot.

Chalking up a couple of birthday cakes and some helium balloons was a nice touch, especially for a forty something. 🤪",5,2018,07,29
130,Quality and good service,"We stayed 4 days in a great room. Excellent sevice and very friendly people, Very expensive but worth the money. We left for our trip back to Norway and checked in at Heathrow. In security I discovered that my PC was left behind at the hotel! I called the concierge and - to my great relief - they found the PC and came driving to Heathrow and gave back my PC to me! Quick and friendly! And no talk of extra payment! My PC is an important tool for work, so that really made the day! Thank you very much! ",5,2018,07,29
130,Summer Stay,"Stayed here for one night in June in a suite at roughly £1,200 per night. Room was of a good size when compared to similar hotels at a similar price point. The bathroom especially was of a good quality with a nice powerful shower. Good breakfast buffet but the menu for the hot food was confusing, at £40 a head it should not be.

Two niggles. On the night we stayed there was a function for The Invictus Games. There were only two bar staff working and therefore it was a long wait for drinks, I would have expected there to be more staff. On checkout our bill was wrong and we had to wait about 10 minutes for them to rectify it, this should not happen at a hotel of this price point.

In the past few months we have stayed in comparable rooms at The Mandarin and The Shangri-La. I would place this hotel above The Mandarin but below The Shangri-La.",4,2018,07,24
130,The best hotel in London,"Whenever I have the opportunity I stay at this hotel. It is so beautiful. Everything is perfect. The staff are exceptional! Fabulous food, incredible comfort and you leave feeling relaxed and looked after. ",5,2018,07,21
130,The Perfect Birthday in a Perfect Hotel,"We stayed in Room 314 which has amazon views of Hyde park, as I was celebrating my birthday we were welcomed with a bottle of champagne, fruit platter and not one but two cakes which were both delicious. 
The service from the staff was lovely and friendly but professional, Claire (I think) checked is in and showed us our room which was spacious comfortable and spotless. 
The bar was lovely and we enjoyed a few drinks before going out for dinner and the Spanish guitarist made a chilled vibe! 
We dined at The Shard but Next time we hope to have dinner at one of the restaurants. 
Breakfast was relaxed but very speedy service and once again staff were attentive and ensure we had everything we needed. 
I can’t say a bad word though our TV did not work on arrival but with in 5min of allied reception a member of staff came and sorted the “connection error”. 
As a Hotel manager myself staying in a place like this is a real show of How it can be done, I hope you don’t mind using your hotel as an example to my staff. 

This was a special treat for my wife and I but we hope to be coming back for longer next time. 
Thank you Dorchester; thank you! 
See you soon.

130,Customer service of the highest level.,"From the doorman to the cleaner, every member of staff made us feel very special. The Dorchester sets the standards that other hotels can only learn from. I would go as far as to say that it was truly inspirational.
Thank you.",5,2018,07,18
130,Stunning dinner ,"I’ve been invited at a private business reception in one exclusive Suite at the Dorchester.
The location is fabulous, the staff extremely caring and the quality of food very good. The service at the table had a few hiccups - e.g. I told before starting that I had an intolerance to lamb meat and was served the lamb: same my neighbour, who was Vegetarian and stressed it at the beginning- but the overall experience still keeps the level and the event went well.",5,2018,07,16
130,Disappointed disappointed ,"Stayed in suite 632 for 2 nights  , as you entered the suite , the smell of sewerage hits you , reported 3 times and spoke with the manager , the just used air freshener which lasted few minutes.
They confirmed they have problems with suites too after the renovation , but they did not have another suite for us to move to - this is totally unacceptable - for a room costing over 1100 overnight this is totally unacceptable. If the room needs repairs don’t let it until they are completely sorted out. 

",1,2018,07,15
130,So special,"Having stayed at The Dorchester previously I knew what an amazing place it was and we were not disappointed. Breakfast was beautiful, the flowers are amazing in itself and the service so attentive.
We were made to feel welcome to linger over our food and champagne.",5,2018,07,14
130,Where’s the wow factor!,"First time visitor to the Dorchester and was really expecting the wow factor! I’ve stopped in numerous five star hotels through London and the world but I wouldn’t  rank this in my top 5 never mind  top 10.
It’s got the history but to me that’s about it and boy do they know how to charge! We had a meal for 4 in the promenade which was as expensive as a top class Michelin star Resturant but NO were near as good!
The staff were ok but should be more attentive especially when they charge a service charge just to pore a drink!
The room was ok but no where worth the price that was charged. My mother found a dirty sock in her room along with no shower soaps. She didn’t complain at the time  as she didn’t want to get anyone into trouble which obviously I wasn’t happy about especially at the price of these rooms they should be immaculate. If anything our room was well overpriced and had no views at all. I looked out over a wall!
Simply there are better hotels in London which are more reasonable priced five start hotels. I get really annoyed when hotels charge nearly the price of a bottle of spirt for a shot! I know this is a 5 star hotel but surely you don’t have to rip people off!",3,2018,07,14
130,The epitome of luxury,Our stay at the Dorchester was simply lovely. From the moment we checked in the hotel felt special. They helped us check in with ease and allowed us to clean up after a long flight. The hotel is decorated in elegant and luxurious fixings that build the nature of the hotel. Their bar was exceptional. Their breakfasts delicious. Our room was quaint but peaceful. It was decorated lavishly. Their service was very good but seemed to fall short on the small things here and there. But overall this is the best hotel choice whilst in London and we will certainly return. ,5,2018,07,11
130,"Great hotel, great service, divine breakfast ","We stayed at the Dorchester for 4 nights in June. We had the most gorgeous rooms, the breakfast was amazing & included as we went through a virtuoso travel agent. Very special stay for us as we came all the way from Australia. ",5,2018,07,11
130,A wonderful hotel in London,"I loved The Dorchester.  The staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to help with anything you might need.  We checked our bags at the hotel and went out for the day.  When we arrived back at the hotel our bags had been delivered to our room.  The handle of one of our bags broke while they were transporting our luggage.  There was a note with the bag asking us to call the manager to make arrangements to repair the bag.  They took care of everything.  The bag was repaired with absolutely no inconvenience to us.  I loved the location of the hotel next to Hyde Park, which is convenient if you like to go for a run or walk to exercise.  We had a park view room which is located on the Park Lane side of the hotel.  Park Lane is a busy street so there is some traffic noise, but I am pretty sensitive to noise and it was ok for me.  The room are very elegant and comfortable.",5,2018,07,10
130,Fantastic location,"Superbly friendly staff which will go out the way to please you along with some great restaurants with every kind of cuisine to delight from.

130,30th birthday,"What can I say about this magnificent hotel.  Customer service is second to none. They made us feel special the minute we walked in side.  
They even sent us to the broadway to watch a show in a limo.   When we would pop out they made us coffee to go.  Rooms are amazing , we drive the Ferrari to the front door where they took our bags and parked it. Best hotel we have stayed in in London.",5,2018,07,09
130,"Fabulous, elegant hotel","We stayed  at theDorchester Hotel, London for 4 wonderful nights with our daughter and grandson.  The location on Hyde Park is fantastic....all very central. The flowers in the lobby are so beautiful.  Our rooms and bathrooms were large and seemed to be newly decorated.  The staff is so nice and helpful from Chambermaid to Concierge.....really first class...they made one feels very special. The restaurants are multiple and each delicious....we loved the Grill Room..an English menu with shepherds pie, etc.  we cannot  recommend this hotel enough.  Cannot wait to return!",5,2018,07,07
130,Beautiful ,"Visited The Dorchester this weekend for my girlfriend’s birthday. Staff were friendly and the hotel is beautifully presented throughout. 

The Saturday night we had a glass or two of champagne in the lounge which was lovely however as expected, not the cheapest (but then again, if you’re at The Dorchester clearly you realise this anyway)

Very pleasant and would definitely return in the future. ",5,2018,06,18
130,What a treat!,"Fabulous staff! From the lady who provided bathroom supplies in a lovely Dorchester Collection bag to the breakfast waiters to the bar staff and finally to the really helpful staff on reception just amazing.
Lovely spacious room and large comfy bed. 
Beautiful public spaces with the most incredible floral displays.
Enjoyed the breakfast thoroughly. Only regret not enough time to enjoy the grill and restaurant.",5,2018,06,15
130,Afraid Claridges is far superior,"Taking a slightly different approach to this review - making comparisons with Claridges hotel which is my usual go-to hotel in London.

I stayed here after several amazing stays at Hotel Bel Air and Beverly Hills Hotel in LA - also part of the Dorchester Collection. I had assumed this hotel would be the jewel in their crown but sadly not.

On arrival the lobby of the Dorchester was a real let down. Claridges is gorgeous and really lets you know you’re somewhere special. The Dorchester was small, dark and the decor was much less impressive that the Art Deco I had expected. Don’t get me started on the tacky cars outside of the hotel and the gangs and mobs that hang around - I am so surprised Dorchester thinks this appeals to guests. 

Check in was fabulous, we had a lovely Italian girl that made an effort to welcome
us and escorted us to our room. Great job! The room was recently renovated and looked lovely. It was spacious and bright with a beautiful marble bathroom. However one towel and the bed spread were stained and I had to ask to have them replaced. The slippers were way too small and they didn’t have any larger sizes. We watched a movie on the gorgeous B&O but was so dark we couldn’t see it - and you cannot adjust the brightness (nor could the technician they sent). They did however comp the cost of the movie. 

I found the restaurant situation at the hotel bizarre.  Their main space - The Promenade - is like a corridor and the decor feels dated. Breakfast and Afternoon tea were both fine but far from exceptional and I constantly wished I was having a magical experience at Claridges.

Service was overall pretty good. Check in was flawless, the concierge was great and service at The Promenade was attentive. My sister did call for some toothpaste which took 25 mins to arrive and she’d already left.

Let me start by saying this is a good hotel. It’s not bad. However when I compare this experience to Claridges it pales in comparison so I could not understand why anyone would choose this hotel over Claridges.

",3,2018,06,15
130,Beautiful hotel,"Perfect seamless service. Very luxurious. Beautiful at Christmas when they have their tree up. Have stayed there once, and it was amazing. Would definitely stay there again. Had a wonderful nights sleep.",5,2018,06,10
130,Perfection,"Perfection is their motto and The Dorchester has definitely raised the bar. Although this iconic Hotel from The Dorchester Collection is rather large, you don’t get lost in the “shuffle”. Personalized  attention from the moment you step on the grounds. We spent two weekends as a part of a short European vacation. Our first leg was London where we had the the absolute delight to stay at The Dorchester for the very first time. Having been to other 5 star hotels hotels London, our expectations were rather high. The Dorchester delivered in a way that was truly impressive. Spent a week in Vienna and returned to the States via London. I can honestly say I was looking forward to coming back to this hotel. If I had one word to describe our stays at The Dorchester, I would say impeccable! Moving forward The Dorchester is the only place to stay while in London. So glad we followed our friends and family’s recommendation to book a room in this most exquisite Hotel. Perfection is their motto. The Staff at the Hotel really lived up to that. The Hotel is GORGEOUS from top bottom  meticulously kept and such a delight to come home to after a busy day with friends, shopping and the like. Special mention to Anuar at the Promenade, Emmy and Isla at the front desk. Worth mentioning, the feeling of being welcomed was unsurpassed. The Tea Service upon arriving was a great touch.",5,2018,06,08
130,Unacceptable for a hotel of this standard,"We had a fabulous meal at China Tang and the staff were excellent.  However, we had one drink at the bar in the main hotel where we felt the staff were quite abrupt and condescending and even as residents were not allowed any more drinks after midnight.  Unbelievable when you see what the charges are for a night in a very average room.  There was not one bar you could obtain a drink after midnight only room service available. Unacceptable in The Dorchester Park Lane W1",3,2018,06,05
130,Superb hotel!,"Once i had stayed here i decided not to go anywhere else, yes its very expensive but you get treated like a king, we had an amazing time with staff and good experience all around, superb building with lots of old stuff to keep you entertained.",5,2018,06,04
130,Its big but still charming.,"This is a British landmark. The service, rooms, restaurants are all 5* but its a big hotel. Similar to the Plaza NYC. Lots of corporate events especially in the ballroom which is HUGE! 
If you are visiting London then stay here - if only for one night.",5,2018,06,03
130,"SO CLASSY, WORTH EVERY PENNY","From the moment we were greeted by the doorman I knew this was going to be special experience. The hotel is stunning and as the Chelsea Flower Show was on the floral displays in reception were spectacular. The room, bathroom, staff, service, quality of breakfast and bars are faultless, not cheap but worth every penny.",5,2018,05,29
130,Second visit to the Dorchester,"Three years ago we visited for a week and chose to return this year based on that experience.  We have stayed at the Dorchester’s Eden Hotel in Rome and at Le Meurice in Paris twice (that is my favorite of the Dorchester group).  
This trip was with my two grown kids, one of whom just graduated from University and the other will be heading off to medical school later this summer, so this was very much a last hurrah and celebration.  We chose this hotel based on its location - just a short walk to Buckingham Palace, many other sites (depending on how much walking you enjoy) and the best of London shopping (Regent and Bond Streets).  We stayed in a Stanhope suite and it was very nice - two bathrooms, a living room and bedroom.  
Service is what makes hotels of this caliber really stand out.  Most staff were extremely nice and helpful, especially those in the Promenade and the Grille.  At times I felt that the doormen were a bit arrogant, and not always very helpful.  We had arranged for private tours and perhaps they were less impressed with the sedans that arrived for us than with the ferraris and maseratis pulling in.  
Housekeeping made sure we had plenty of fresh towels, crisply made beds, and bath products.  There were a few instances when dirty coffee cups and glasses were left even at turndown.  The floral arrangements in the Promenade were stunning and it was fun to watch them being refreshed.  
Overall we enjoyed our stay.  London has a good number of 5 star hotels to choose from and I think this property recognizes that its patrons have solid options.   For the most part it tries to ensure that they feel they made the right choice in staying there.",5,2018,05,26
130,The most amazing Hotel in the World!,"What a great stay. From the first moment of crossng the mains I felt as the most important man on Earth. Rooms lovely arranged. Grill restaurant with some impressive dishes. Fabio at the Promenade Bar and China Tang batenders made my stay as well.
will be back again!",5,2018,05,26
130,60th Birthday. Oh yes and a marriage proposal!,"Wow. All I can say is I have never experienced such wonderful attention and true caring from the most wonderful team headed by Emma Deflorian And the wonderful Richard Spears managing the Promenade as well as fabulous front desk ladies and gentleman. Even the gorgeous Portuguese assistant in the ladies powder room who was the loveliest lady, I can’t express how amazing my experience has been. The gentleman at the door who have served for over a decade each who greeted us with a welcoming smile And warm humour are accessible and professional. I highly recommend the Deanery Suites and the Grill Room for breakfast. French toast to remember. Thank you thank you for making my birthday as well as my first night as a fiancée so memorable. Can’t wait to come back.",5,2018,05,26
130,Amazing staff with the highest integrity,"I work for a client who recently stayed at the Dorchester and lost a lovely jewelry piece, an expensive ring. To our amazement and delight, the ring was found and turned in! This is a true measure of the quality and integrity of your team at the Dorchester. On my client's next upcoming visit, my client will be reunited with their piece. Bravo Dorchester and your team!",5,2018,05,25
130,"Historic and beautiful, but 5 star price 3-4 star comfort","First, this is destination hotel and people come with high expectations. 

It’s historical, and feels luxurious.  Lots of soft furnishings, marble bathrooms, deep carpets. Big flower arrangements in the promenade.

Issue is modern comfort.  

Beds are poor.  Old style spring with a thick top added - lumpy and saggy at same time.  Also my King was two singles together (which is common) but the set up is such that there is a big crevice/slant to the middle.  You just dont get these issues in other modern 5 star hotels.

Shower over bath.  Huge bath nearly a waste high to get in to shower - actually quite dangerous, for elderly it would be impossible.   Yes common in London... but for the price / 5 star... its time for a seperate shower.

Really is time they put in a USB chargeing station/device.  basic free wifi slow, but called up and got a code for faster.  They should start with that. 

Location:  so Park Lane is special... but not a lot of options to eat around that are modern and reasonable price.  If you are planning on shopping in Mayfair - great spot though.

There is a fair amount of road noise from Park Lane.  Heavy curtains help, a little.

Breakfast at the Grill.  High quality (and price), but actually only a modest continential spread and limted a la carte options.  Service hit and miss. 

Similar to some other reviews.  I had some issues with attitude from security a few times.  Signage is poor.",3,2018,05,24
130,Perfection DOES just happen,"From the moment you walk into the hotel, you feel special.
The staff are all so warm and welcoming, they make you feel like you have just come home.
Everything about this hotel oozes quality, from the deep plush carpets in the promenade, the stunning flowers displays, the professionalism of every single member of staff... Faultless.
The room, just stunning, the most comfortable nights sleep you will ever have, the bathroom is so luxurious with complete marble and the deepest baths I have ever seen.
The housekeeping team are discreet, no clanking trollies! If they see you coming, they stop what they are doing, pull to one side, acknowledge you, wait for you to pass before resuming their duties.
You must try the spa, my wife said it was the best massage she has ever had!
Afternoon tea is also something not to be missed- still in my opinion the best in London.
Breakfast again is not just breakfast, but an event, the quality of ingredients and staff is second to none.
Dispute not being uber rich, and saved hard for this treat, the staff never made you feel like you don't belong, quite the opposite, we were made to feel so special from the second we arrived to when we sadly had to leave.
Oh one last point, the best espresso martinis in the world.
The Dorchester is still without a doubt one of the great dames of London and the world.
To sum it up, the Dorchester lives up To its moto...
""Perfection just happens"" all be it with the dedication and hard work of the amazing staff.
Finally, Emma at guest relations is in my opinion one of the biggest assets to the hotel, never have we been treated so well, like an old friend, Emma goes above and beyond, I can never thank you enough for what you done for us, thank you so so much.",5,2018,05,20
130,Worst stayed,"I would like share We had  a very unpleasant time at Dorchester Hotel in London last year . 
We were booked deanery Suit ,about  1400 pound per night ( exclusive breakfast) for 22 days in last May 2017 , When we arrived and check in we have been told our room has been upgraded to Stanhope Suite , We said :i We would  much appreciated if we could have a quiet room please , given that’s we have Jed lag and long flight, it’s really exhausted . 

When we got in to the room  , it’s very dark , small widows with share curtains off , which you can not see outside at all, when you in the room you can not tell is day or night, also the very narrow and small sitting room there is a small sofa  ; which is too small for two people, so we had to one sitting at writing desk chair - 

The room have two very small bathrooms , one with shower  , the shower ; is quite high Steps to get in to the shower , the shower very very narrow and small , hardly turn round, and also quite slippery , when my husband or myself to taking a shower we have to keeping eye for each other at bathroom, it’s great dangerous ! 

The room there isn’t any tea cups and kettle , We went to Lobby , just want to having tea , but really can not find peace quiet place have a cup tea ，we had shared  a Couch with other people at lobby ....... have to listen to other people conversation..... late evening we asked delivery cup and kettle to our room , they delivered one set of cup only , then other cup turned up  and Kettle turned up , take about a hour for cups and kettle to my room, 
following day they collected cups and Kettle way.....We have to repeat again；and waited......

At night  ambulance ,Firetruck and cars quiet noisy and Jed leg very hardly going to sleep, until we went to sleep at early morning, but only 9 O’clock some noise makers us up , We had found out opposite rebuild a building , they put down and pick up steel pipers (?) noise,  how is a quiet room ! 

So So tired 😑 We flight over whole night didn’t sleep well and at Hotel cannot sleep either 😡 about 9 am wake up,, at room can be rest then we went down to have breakfast , we have at 3rd floor, Waiting for the lift going down ,, two days didn’t sleep well , so tried, we have waited lift about 15 minutes the lift never move and the signal  still at lobby , when we waking down, we seen a Security guard Standing at a middle of lift , stopped all the people get in the lift , and second and third lifts are  closed , When we finished breakfast more then one hour late  , the Security guard still there for keeping the lift for someone  (?)  my husband asked the guard , there are three lifts in the hotel  , which lift can be used by hotel gusts ?  He is very rude Blinking his eyes looking at my husband no answer, then my husband asked front desk  , they told my husband that ; 
one lift closed one is broken down, and one only for services “Special important gust “ now ,......... 

My husband asked them , why Hotel didn’t notice gust about lifts 
informations  ? ?? we have waited at up stairs and I am sure will be lots other gust like us waited and waited at each floor.....

Three days we were stayed every morning most busy time the only one lift but Occupation by The guard for a “Special gust ” and Hotels Manager security staff at lobby always waited ‘Special gust  “coming up and down, it’s making very uncomfortable and inconvenient for other gust , also it’s not fair for us too ! 

We have to walked up and Lunch time we went down.,  .........the lift still Keeping for the ‘some special “the guard still at same place, so half days no one can used lift only keeping for “Special  “ We wander if who are really special, Hotel should closed  just services for ‘some special “ otherwise it’s not fair for rest of Hotel Gusts ! We have paid full price for staying hotel and been treated really not fair ! 

I requested hotel reception change a quiet room for us , the front desk Manager ( she said she is Manager ) showed me ; The only ONE SUIT will be available at following day , she told me that , she is very ‘kindly “ introducing the suit  , said hotel very very busy at moment ,only that suit would be available , she said ;normal price is 3700 pounds  ,lovely park view and big dinning table in the sitting room ........she can do very good price for 2500 pounds ONLY ( per night) , it’s very bargain  !,!  very very cheap ONLY 2500 pounds, she repeat again again .......... the suit  facing to main street it’s more noisy ,  I said I am simply asked a quiet room only .......

When I got back my room I had checked THAT there are  several kind of suites available on the hotel website for whole period , She  had forgotten this is  Modern world  so easy find informations ........ !!! 

Follow day  we had  moved out , We went to Ritz Hotel and stayed a Deluxe Suite  , cost 1680 pound but Can not compare , the suit very comfortable it’s near double size of the Dorchester,” Stanhope Suite we were stayed ) and it’s high ceilings , very cheerful colour and French style decor, even one side facing to Piccadilly street with terrace  , but when you closed double doors you can not heard any notice from street , one side looking at Green Park with lovely view, also the bathroom is very nice too ,  staffs much more friendly , very good service ! most important it’s very quiet and comfortable room !!! 

We had bump into Mr Li Ka Shing ,the riches Chinese business men in the lift , he with his son and my husband and I in the lift , no body guard  ....No one holding the lift for him , we said Hello and bye bye to each other......perfectly
 normal ! 

We had very happy and good rest stayed most 20 days  at Rizt Hotel London and now we have just booked at same room for this summer holiday agin  ! Looking forward to go !",1,2018,05,18
130,Wonderful hotel,"My wife booked us in to the Dorchester for my birthday and it is an amazing, wonderful comfortable place, with a true attention to detail. I think we had an executive suite with park views, the room was stunning and elegant and tastefully decorated. We had an entrance hall a four poster bed a balcony, a dressing room and a marble clad bathroom with one of the biggest baths I've ever seen. The highest level of quality runs through the hotel from the lobby, to the champagne bar, lifts, corridors and room. The staff are very attentive and I would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2018,05,14
130,Another fabulous visit but keep standards up,"My wife and I visited The Dorchester the day after our wedding as it’s a place that is special to us. 

Whilst everything was absolutely perfect as always and we were made to feel very welcome and pampered the only slight let down was breakfast the following day.

The Grill was busy and we were asked to wait a few minutes for a table which was fine but the lady on the desk left her post and three guests merrily walked in and were seated by the waitress in the restaurant. 

When we eventually we seated we were given menus and not asked if we wanted a drink by the waitress and yet other tables were.

Whilst a minor issue in the overall scheme of things it was slightly annoying and not what you would expect from a 5 star establishment.

However, the issue was remedied when we mentioned it to our waiter (Ben) who apologised and looked after us perfectly.

Still a fabulous hotel though!

",5,2018,05,09
130,Beautiful and historic hotel,"This hotel is incredibly grand and the rooms are old school glamour!

The service amazing, location is fine (not much around) but 10-15 walking distance to the shops.

The restaurant is very good too, definitely worth a try if you don’t feel like venturing out.

Well appointed rooms and has all the bells and whistles you’ll ever need being in a hotel.",5,2018,05,08
130,Had the most magical Christmas experience,"If I could give the hotel 10 stars I would! 
Staying during December the hotel was decorated beautifully with the gingerbread house pride of place!
The staff were excellent and amazing with both our children, they were made to feel very welcome.
My daughter in particular loved the Christmas sweet shop in the lobby! 
The children’s amenities were a lovely touch and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend The Dorchester to families.
Thank you for a magical stay!",5,2018,05,06
130,Superb Superb Superb,"We stayed at the Dorchester this weekend and it was faultless. The service from the entire staff is impeccable and the Hotel oozes charm and style.
It is expensive at all levels but this is the price you pay for what you get and is well worth it.

There are very few things in life that live up to their iconic status but this does",5,2018,04,29
130,Generally excellent but some niggles,"We booked two nights in a studio suite (Room 221), which was extremely well-appointed, large and very comfortable. 

The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I appreciated the pillow spray, the slippers and the bottle of water that were provided each night as part of the turn down service. There was also fruit and bottled water available on the cabinet by the TV. 

Other amenities included magazines, a reasonably comfortable sofa and chairs on which to relax, a mini bar and a good-quality TV. There was also a desk, with paper and a pen (and a plug adaptor, which was a nice touch but see below). There was also free and reasonably fast Wifi. 

The walk-in wardrobe was exceptionally good. There was enough space to store all the cases, and plenty of drawers and hanging space. There were none of those wretched hangers that clip on and off the rail - just a a decent and plentiful selection of good quality hangers.There was also a safe. 

The bathroom was vast. The shower was powerful and simple to operate, and didn't leek (like so many hotel showers do). The products were plentiful and of good quality, and the bars of soap were nice and big. The towels were big and soft and there were lots of them. Full marks. 

The niggles? There was no mini bar price list in the room when I arrived. And, as is so often with hotels these days, there's a whole pile of gumf about the spa and how amazing the hotel is and how you can book a stay at other hotels in the group and room service ... but nothing to tell you where breakfast is or what times breakfast is open. It's amazing the number of hotels that I go to these days, where one of the first things I have to do is to ring down to reception to get this simple information (since I invariably forget to ask at check in). Just a simple piece of paper would suffice with basic information about the room - breakfast times etc,, where the bar is, how to get things cleaned etc. Ringing down to reception each time you have a question about the room is just rather painful. 

Check in (and check out) were both efficient. But I had to wait for nearly 30 minutes for my luggage to be brought up. 

Sockets. Another bugbear of mine. All of us travellers now arrived with a whole plethora of laptops, iPads, phones, watches etc. etc that all need to be plugged in. I expect to have sockets at table height by the bed, rather than to have to scrabble around moving furniture to plug things into sockets under the bed at floor level. There were no table-height plugs by the bed in the room. Worse, there are some sockets provided in the desk, accessed by a fold down flap. All very nice and decorative but totally useless for plugging in more bulky adaptors. So, pretty much everything was charged by getting down on the floor and plugging things into sockets under the desk. 

And it would have been nice if the receptionist had given me a bit of a tour around the room, before leaving me. 

The view, of air-conditioning ducts, was also rather disappointing for a suite of this calibre (and price).",4,2018,04,19
130,Memorable weekend ,"We booked a weekend stay at the Dorchester for my husbands birthday and what a great weekend it was. We were given an upgrade to a lovely suit and on opening the door to the room, were greeted by a little birthday gateau, champagne and HBD balloons decorating the sitting room. 
We had two marvellous dinners at China Tang and Alain Ducasse (see separate reviews) and on the second evening we had a knock on the door as we were getting ready for dinner and were delighted to have a delivery of pre dinner G&T and a bowl of nuts brought to our suite. What a lovely touch! The surprises didn’t end there. Guest relations had clearly informed Alain Ducasse of my husbands birthday as he was spoilt with a candle in his dessert on finishing off the meal.
We had an extraordinary weekend here at the Dorchester and they made us feel very special during our stay!
Thank you The Dorchester for making this weekend so very very special.",5,2018,04,15
130,Always a pleasure,"The Dorchester offers you everything for a visit to London. It defines luxury and centrality. The welcome at check in to remembering the finer details of a guest, the guest services are the very best. 
I arrived at 9 am and was able to check in to my room by 10 am. The early check in was complimentary. I got the king room and the bed was very comfortable. Only thing which is not there in the room is an electric kettle, which is provided when asked. Honestly I forgot to ask and then didn’t need it. 
For the last night I requested to be moved to a twin bed room and that was taken care of. 
For check out I requested a late check out and that was provided for. 
Honestly it was the most comfortable and luxurious stay. Thank you Dorchester team. Your concierge was also very good in receiving packages and delivering to the room. 
Only thing which was a little on the expensive side was the breakfast of £38 but with their Parcafe, you really don’t need a very pricey breakfast. 
Btw, the Spa is a destination in its own :)",5,2018,04,14
130,Feels like home away from home ,"One of the best comfortable hotels I every stayed in London, for the past 7 years i always stay in the same hotel and I visit London regularly more than once a year. They have the best service on all level: they always try to renovate to the better ! And try to make their customers feel as they are at home ! 
Thank you to the Dorchester and to the management of the Dorchester !",5,2018,04,13
130,The Best Birthday!,"I arranged to take my Mum to The Dorchester to stay overnight as a surprise for her birthday, It was very important to me that this stay would be special as my Mum is a full time carer and only has one week off a year.

I couldn't of asked for a better stay! Emma checked us in and lead us up to our room, we had a park view and it was lovely to look onto Hyde Park. She was so kind and showed us everything we needed to know about the room and facilities in the hotel.

 I had arranged for flowers to be placed in the room as a surprise and they were beautiful! The doorbell then went and a trolley was rolled in with complimentry champagne, cakes, water, fruit and balloons, including a note from Emma wishing us a pleasant stay. The in room dining assistant that delivered it was lovely and even posed for a picture for my Mum when she asked and had a quick chat with us.

I love the extra touches like arranging your toiletries in the bathroom on turndown and the little bottles of sleep spray by the bed.

I am so grateful for the fantastic stay and to all the staff that treated my Mum like a queen for the day, thank you.",5,2018,04,05
130,"Good, but not great","The Dorchester is one of the Grandes Dames of London and probably rightly so.  I stay there often as it is conveniently located for my meetings.  However, given the superb hotel offer in London, I do consider it overpriced.  The lobby is beautiful and the service efficient: the people of the hotel really care for the well-being of their guests.  But the rooms are small by today's standards, the bathrooms tiny and in both my last two visits I had a room overlooking the aircon machinery of the hotel (despite having booked the highest room category).  My stays are always short (1-2 nights) so it is not that important but given the price I would have expected more.
A very good point for the hotel is that it hosts IMHO the best French restaurant of London (Alain Ducasse) and one of the good Chinese one (China Tang)",4,2018,04,02
130,The best,"You get exactly what you pay for. The service, the rooms are simply the best. We were upgraded without even asking.  They can not do enough. We dinned at Alain Ducasse which was equally as fantastic
Maria on reception was amazing
My wife will never forget her 50 th",5,2018,03,30
130,Welcome to First Class,"The Dorchester retains all the elegance of the West End and rightly so. 

Had a nice afternoon lunch steak and wine in the private dining area it’s expensive but then it is the West End so its to be expected. 

First class service with charm and warmth.

130,Special occasion 60th wedding anniversary ,"Steeped in tradition the whole set up is there to make your stay memorable with everybody playing their own part in making a stay special - the doorman that first greets you, the receptionist that beams out a welcoming smile, the chefs that prepare anything you want

On this occasion reception were in on the surprise and it wasn't long before everyone in the place seemed to know. 

Okay some may argue that's what you pay for but every member of staff was key to making this a trip to remember - from the time of stepping out, to the time stepping back into the taxi, nothing seemed to be a problem. 

",5,2018,03,19
130,Lovely hotel but not the best London has to offer,"Stayed here during the Christmas period with my husband.  The Dorchester is a lovely 'grande dame' of a hotel, but I honestly don't think it's worth the price tag. Although opulent it's no where near as gorgeous as Claridges, nor as chic.  That said, the service was good, our room was very nice and our children loved their sweets from the festive sweet shop.  Special mention to the shop assistant who was lovely.",4,2018,03,12
130,Average food,"Stayed at the Dorchester last week excellent rooms , staff to stuffy, food average and bland wish it could have been a better review.
Breakfast was average staff to efficient and cold making us feel uncomfortable .",4,2018,03,11
130,The Gold Standard,"We caught a non-stop flight from Denver to Gatwick on Saturday afternoon, arriving 6am Sunday morning. We arrived in London much the same as most Americans -- bleary-eyed and sleep deprived. When we arrived at the Dorchester, there were no rooms ready as it was very early and check-out had barely begun. We sat down in the lavishly decorated promenade and hoped a room would be available soon. A few minutes later we were approached by Harry, one of the Front Desk managers, bidding us to come down with him to the hotel spa. He had checked with the spa manager to see if we could relax there while waiting for our room and she had agreed, even though the spa wouldn't open until 9am. We were ushered into the Relaxation Room, a dark, quiet room with plush lounge chairs, fluffy pillows and blankets. Absolute heaven!! We stretched out on the lounges and fell fast asleep. Some time later, Harry came back, apologized for the interruption, but with the good news that our room was ready. We got to our room and found our bags were already there. We thanked Harry and then took a long nap!

Our room was large, lovely and very quiet! The king sized bed was fitted with the softest linen sheets that smelled of lavender and the mattress was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was made entirely of marble with two sinks in the vanity, a bidet, a very deep soaking tub and a separate walk-in shower. We were pleasantly surprised to find a basket of fruit and candies from the hotel as a welcome gift.

After a long day exploring London, we'd return and enjoy evening drinks in the hotel bar. If you're not a drinker, you still must stop in to view the beautiful glass ""flames"". And if you are a drinker, I highly recommend the Dorchester Bellini.

The Dorchester is elegant and beautiful and everyone on the staff treated us like royalty. I've never felt so pampered and indulged! If you want a First Class, luxury hotel in London, The Dorchester is THE gold standard.",5,2018,03,08
130,Wedding Bonanza,"Following our daughters wedding in Battersea, we held the reception here, wow, how good are they, the professionalism of all the staff, is ridiculously good, from all the organisation beforehand to the smooth running of the day, to the breakfast for all the wedding guests that stayed the next morning!!! We have to say a massive Thank You to Valentine, who was perfection herself, my daughter Georgina, could not have asked for a more understanding, patient wedding organiser than this lovely lady. Nothing was too much hassle, from choosing the food, the wines, to making sure Phillip Hammond behaved himself with the flowers :). Seriously good, Phillip was a masterclass when it came to the arrangements and getting our flowers delivered to the church in Battersea, Sean was a great toastmaster putting every one at ease, hats off to the chefs and waiters and waitresses, incredible attention to detail. you made a wonderful occasion just perfect, one very grateful father of the bride",5,2018,03,06
130,Not restful,"Ok, the location is great, and the lobby is filled with flowers. Dinner at The Grill was very good.
But the room was a disappointment. The first room was filled with an overwhelming smell of perfume, and I got a headache instantly. Called the front desk, and was escorted to a second room. The front desk attendant agreed that the first - and second room smelled strongly of perfume. She explained that some of their guests use a significant amount of perfume, and rooms are left with an odor that is difficult to clear. I was brought to a third room that smelled neutral.
After dinner in The Grill I went straight to bed. The room was across the hall from a service door. I'm not a light sleeper, but the traffic in the hall (room service?) was loud and disturbing until about 3am. I did not call the front desk, as I'd already moved twice and it was after midnight.
Left promptly at 8 the following morning (after a lovely room service breakfast).
I love some of the other Dorchester Collection hotels, particularly the Hotel Bel-Air. But I would hesitate to stay at the flagship on next trip to London after this experience.",3,2018,03,05
130,Delicious food,"Went to a corporate event last week.
The staff were very efficient and friendly.
The food was lovely very fresh and seasonal.I especially liked the venison ravaloi .
The wine complimented the food well and it was a well run event .",4,2018,03,03
130,Disappointing ,"Lobby - Underwhelming. No grand entrance or wow factor. It felt very dated and lacked any charm. 

Food - We dined in the Grill one night, the ambiance was good but the food was poor. F&B Manager informed & apologised. Didn’t seem sincere. 

Service - Varied. Front desk staff were very attentive but on checkout wasn’t asked how my stay was which was surprising. 

Spa - Treatment very good. Relaxation room was decorated nicely but all the chairs were so uncomfortable. 

If you don’t want to hear cars roaring all night, please ask for a room that doesn’t face onto the park. ",2,2018,03,01
130,Exquisite ,"We stayed here as part of a birthday celebration, the service, the food and the surroundings were all as you would expect if not better! 

We had afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening for a special celebration you could not ask for more.

Would highly recommend a stay here! ",5,2018,02,28
130,"Supreme Service in All Areas, Awful Spa Manager","We are regular visitors of London and decided to visit The Dorchester for the first time as our other preferred hotel was full.  The service at The Dorchester was outstanding from the moment the gentleman took the car key off us to every staff who served and greeted us including house keeping. However, the Spa manager's manners were unprofessional and perhaps discriminatory. I will be writing to the general manager to voice my concern and discomfort, and also describe the unacceptable behaviour of the Spa manager.  Hopefully Mr Whitfield will receive the letter personally.",4,2018,02,24
130,World Class! You would love this place! Amazing service!,"Well, there is nothing to be honest. Just top top top luxury place. We stayed here for 4 days. 4people (2kids) Everyone just loved it. I want to say personal thank you to desk reception people. Very friendly. And you can ask them absolutely everything! Thank you",5,2018,02,22
130,Excellent experience with the doormen!,"My brothers and I would like to thank Ricky the Doorman as well as the manager for such an incredible night to remember for all of us, honestly the goodness of these men are something to be treasured!",5,2018,02,18
130,Valentine's day stay,"arrived at the Dorchester hotel around 1pm. check-in  was smooth, polite and let us have our room early. 

the room was done out in a classic luxuary style...

we enjoyed drinks at the bar in the evening and the waiter was very friendly. 

breakfast in the morning was beautiful at the grill. 

only minor thing was that I found the room heating and water temperature a little erratic. 

all in all very lovely stay. ",5,2018,02,15
130,Mostly good,"The Dorchester is one of the premier hotels in London, and deservedly so, but there are a few problems.  For years I've been staying at other hotels on Park Lane, and this was my first visit to the Dorchester.  Location always depends on where you're going back for tourists this is obviously a great location - in Mayfair and an easy walk to either the West End, Oxford Street or Kensington and right across the street from Hyde Park.  The style is traditional and elegant with a beautiful café as well as Alain Ducasse and an excellent Chinese restaurant, China Tang.  The room is very large and comfortable.  However, the window frames are old and let in the cold air, which was certainly felt in the bathroom.  The biggest issue I had was that the hot water in the sink was never warmer than tepid and I could not shave with hot water during my entire stay.  On the other hand - there was no problem with the shower where hot water was very hot.
The other issue is the gym...  in a small dreary room in the basement.  Moreover, the first time I went there was a terrible odor in the gym, which really made it impossible to stay for long (probably because it's in the basement with all the pipes from the building.  However the other times I was the odor was gone - and in fact there was a pleasant smell, but it is small and a bit depressing.  If the gym is important to you - this is not your hotel.
Breakfast buffet was fairly small, but of very good quality.  The croissants, pains au chocolat, mini-baguettes were of high quality - not imitations of the real thing as in many hotels.
Free wifi was sometimes good and sometimes slow, depending on the time.  Faster wifi was available for 20 GBP.
Aside from that the staff was excellent - everyone was friendly, efficient and clearly happy to be working at the Dorchester.  This hotel is clearly very well managed.
All in all a great hotel, but some real structural problems, which will probably have to wait until the next refurbishment.",4,2018,02,10
130,Awesome luxury hotel,"this is an awesome luxury hotel with excellent location, friendly staff, nice and clean, good and decent sized rooms. nice big spread of breakfast with lot of choices. we had a memorable time. the staff is warm too.",5,2018,02,05
130,Treated My Lovely wife !! What a treat ,"The Dorchester is as part of English History .. as it can get in the city of London. Tail coats and tall hats for the doormen.. who have the secrets to the city.. the concierge.. who really can pull you the best tables and seats ... from shows to resturants. The who' s .. who ... brush shoulders here... 

what did I love ? The opulence.. High tea..an English tradition could not be experienced at a better location and address. Out room was facing Hyde park.. great location to the all shopping areas... the best in house packing valet service.

Thank you Maria.. And Florin for your cherful smile over our breakfast delivery .. the little tips over how special Romania is.. now we are convinced to go there next summer. You are an asset to the happy army of the Dorchester.

Should you stay ? 

Yes .. !!!! Can it get a bit pricey ??

Yes its the Dorchester !!

But enjoy it.. God willing we will be back !!",5,2018,02,04
130,Very Nice Experience,"I stayed 2 nights in this beautiful hotel, for my first visit to London, the location is Perfect to discover the city, the rooms are very nice and the service is Great ! Big thanks to the team for making this stay special !",5,2018,02,02
130,Really not very good - with was a surprise!,"Firstly - I have been a big fan of the Dorchester Collection. The Bel Air is my fav hotel in the world, and I have stayed at most of their hotels - except the Dorchester itself. So, for a special birthday I spent an overnight in a King Deluxe Park View and we also booked a table at the China Tang restaurant. And I am disappointed to report that the visit was poor to say the least. We had to wait to check-in, and when we eventually got to the front - we were asked if it was a special occasion and we told the receptionist it was a birthday - although the hotel did absolutely nothing to recognise this during the stay - so I have no idea why we were asked. We were taken to the room which was fine, but as the photos testify - there was a cigarette burn mark on the curtains and in quite a few places damage around the window. I know it's an old grand dame of a hotel - but this kind of poor room management would be unthinkable at Claridges or the Connaught - both large hotels of the same age. More shocks were to come - we were left on hold for over 5 minutes waiting for room service, who took 45 mins to deliver hot water, the mirror in the bathroom was damaged, the window also would not close properly, high speed WiFi was £20 for 24 hours (shocking), valet parking was £60, and the China Tang was almost industrial in its approach to catering - and so noisy. After yet another long wait to check out to pay £1000 for less than 24 hours, we left massively disappointed that the flagship of the hotel group is more like the Titanic!",2,2018,01,24
130,A birthday treat,"Like many reviewers we were “bucket list” guests and stayed for a friend’s significant birthday.
I left with an overwhelmingly feeling that the staff were the best I’ve ever come across; nothing was too much trouble, everyone was friendly and all seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Even when the receptionist was unable to change our afternoon tea booking or give us a room with a view, she was so lovely about it that we didn’t even mind being told “no”. A really lovely touch was returning to our room after exploring what the hotel had to offer and finding a birthday cake and balloons had been delivered to our room.
Obviously it’s a classy hotel, it is the Dorchester after all, so the opulence was as expected. Just a couple of minor things, and this really is nit-picking ....... being able to make a cup of tea in your room would have been nice as you don’t always want room service and, in spite of it being a luxury hotel, unfortunately the sound proofing isn’t any better than your average budget hotel so we were duly entertained by the couple in the next door room making love at midnight! 
We ate in Alain Ducasse ..... as I said before, it was a “bucket list” trip ..... the food was very nice and the service exceptional. But would I spend that much on a meal again? Absolutely not. 
Overall the stay was a lovely experience and the staff really made it very special.",4,2018,01,19
130,One of the best,I'm lucky enough to have stayed here on several occasions and it has never disappointed. The suites are absolutely superb and some of the best I've ever stayed in and I've had my definite fair share. Service is first class and discreet in a way the British do best. Bars and restaurants are wonderful as is the afternoon tea. Yes it's an expensive hotel but you definitely get what you pay for.,5,2018,01,17
130,Posh and discreet,"If you're looking for a place to stay in London that epitomizes posh and discreet, The Dorchester is it. It's a small fortune to stay there, but you're treated like royalty. Staff bend over backwards for you, rooms are immaculate. Food, drinks are exquisite. I'm vegan and did the vegan high tea -- it's the only thing I found underwhelming of the entire experience as the food wasn't creative or particularly impressive. Everything else about the hotel is though.",5,2018,01,13
130,One of the top hotels in London,"I come to the Dorchester for meetings more often than I stay at it.  But I have enjoyed both experiences.  It is, by all accounts, one of the best hotels in London.  The only issue, if that, is that it caters to many events because it has large ballrooms, as well as some of the glitterati, so there are times when the common areas get a bit busier than I prefer.  But even the crazier guests seem to respect the hotel enough to keep their partying offsite.  Also, sometimes street noise is audible.

Very well appointed.

Staff are helpful.

Cleanliness is of a high standard.

Rooms along Park Lane can be a bit noisy, especially in the Summer when traffic includes rich Middle Easterners racing Bugattis.  

Food is very good but not a standout feature on its own.

Proximity to the Park means one can run by crossing a large road although that requires finding a crossing point or the underground pedestrian walkway.

In Mayfair, so easy to get to meetings.",4,2018,01,11
130,Another faultless stay at the Dorchester,"This was our second time at the Dorchester but this time we were on our own with our children back at home.

Only stayed one night but managed to catch drinks at the cocktail bar pre-dinner and then in the main bar after dinner. All excellent.

Breakfast in the Grill is real treat.

Fantastic stay and looking very much to returning again.",5,2018,01,09
130,Fantastic on every level!,"Everyone should have the opportunity to stay at such a lovely hotel.  Part of a collection of hotels, I have had the good fortune to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Hotel Belair, and 45 Park Lane but the Dorchester is my absolute favorite.  It’s a 5-star establishment on every level - environment/decor, location, restaurants and bars, but the very best thing about the Dorchester is the people.  Ive travelled far and wide and have never stayed at such an exquisite hotel that also had the friendliest, most professional and helpful staff.  My husband has stayed here 5-6 times/ year for the past few years on business and he won’t stay anywhere else.  They greet him by name on arrival.  They have upgraded our room to a larger suite when they knew I was traveling with him.  The bar managers greet him warmly when we stop in for a cocktail before dinner - they are truly happy to see him.  It feels like you are part of an exclusive club yet anyone staying at the hotel is “in” the club.  

All of the restaurants are fantastic.  During our most recent stay we tried the Champagne Afternoon Tea which was delightful but more food than we could possibly eat.  At the end of our meal our waiter asked if we would like the leftovers sent to our room along with some mince pies.  By the time signed the check and returned to our room, the box was there!  

The clientele is very multi-cultural.  The location is great for a peaceful walk through Hyde Park (across the street) as well as getting to Heathrow quickly.  I always get a kick out of the line up of luxury cars out front- G-Wagons, Bentley’s, Rolls Royce’s, just an amazing site.

If you are interested in staying at a luxury hotel in London, do not hesitate to stay at the Dorchester - or even just have s meal here- you will love it!!  It is perfect, it will make you happy!!",5,2018,01,07
130,Nowhere better!,"Our first stay at the Dorchester 21st Dec. and with the beautiful Christmas decorations it looked amazing. Our room also so elegant and so comfortable. A bottle of champagne and birthday cake awaiting arranged by my family. 
The staff as you would expect so helpful and friendly couldn’t do enough to ensure our stay was perfect,and it was. We have stayed in most of London’s top hotels over the years,but if you want a real treat this is the place !",5,2018,01,06
130,3 night break with my godson and wife,"the adjoining rooms were on floor 6 and faced towards the rear of the hotel,quiet as it is not facing park lane.The 2 rooms were beautifully appointed .Complimentary water and fruit platter were provided.Breakfast  in the ground floor was excellent scrambled 
egg cooked to perfection,sandwiches in the promenade bar were most enjoyable and you can sit and watch the world go by,
armand in the promenade bar was, as ,before most engaging.
My grandson developed chronic toothache but thanks to one of the concierges an 
appointment was made for him the next day at  a dental clinic and within an hour his toothache was resolved.excellent service.",5,2017,12,31
130,Exellent,"To be honest I have stayed here a few times and it's on luck what size of room you will get dependant on what's available but honestly this hotel is lovely, even the smallest room I have had has been a nice size. Nice character and a clean feel warm feel. From the entrance to the rooms it's lovely. It has lovely room service to and the Shakshouka for break fast here is my favourite. Better than 45 park lane although they do a good one too but very tomato rich for my liking. Prefer dry. This hotel has a lovely spa and a gym and my favourite is the mood room. It's so calm and you can spend lots of lovely time in there. One of my favourite hotels when in London central. The restaurant does get busy and not my scene so I always use room service which is perfect. ",5,2017,12,29
130,Amazing amazing amazing,"Absolutely love afternoon tea and the Dorchester hotel! Come here for 3 years on the bouncy for afternoon tea around Christmas time to celebrate mother-in-law’s birthday! Nothing is too much trouble! Extra plate of sandwiches? No problem! Not ready for cakes yet? No problem, you just let us know when you’re ready! Waiters are always super polite and attentive! Food is exquisite!! Amazing amazing amazing!!!  ",5,2017,12,29
130,Amazing service!,"The Afternoon Tea at the Promenade was delicious and the cosy ambience invites to relax and indulge your senses. The best? Our server Charlotte!! No doubt she was born for this. I really enjoyed the elegant Dinner in the Grill, both Manager and Felipo, thanks!.
About the breakfast, Daniel sorprised me with a delicious roses tea, and The attention of the Breakfast Manager was lovely he promise me: “I will make everithing posible” I’ll come back soon!",5,2017,12,26
130,Second home ,"Literally when I go back to the Dorchester i feel like going to my second home! 
The hospitality the type of rooms and the service I get I feel like I’m in my second home !
Except to my last visit I was a bit surprise ! With the quality of service I started getting, I was surprised that twice during my 2 weeks stay the room service forget to clean my room while I was out for 8hours! 
And I had to raise the issue until they started taking care of my room. Bare in mind I’m a regular customer who stays in the hotel twice  yearly. 
More so an incident happened with the Concierge as I was trying to book at fire chilter place and he was claiming that their phone is not working! While I was standing in front of him I managed to call and made the reservation on the spot I was a bit surprised with the level of service I used to get and the last visit.!
",5,2017,12,23
130,Family visit ,"Wow!
It was amazing. The staff are superb from the moment you enter the hotel to the moment you leave. 
Drinks in the bar are served well.. which you would expect based on the price! 
Food was amazing and superbly presented when we dined. Great range of wines as you would expect.
The place is amazing and made to feel like a king. 
It holds a special place in my heart..
",5,2017,12,22
130,A reasonably good option.,"We had a four nighter in an Executive room overlooking the park.
Arrived early to a pleasant reception, bags picked up and car whisked away promptly.
Greeted by Anya on reception who was very polite and offered to ring us when the room was ready.
Room (209) was a good size and good views and the tour was given again by Anya who explained the facilities in detail and even give me a birthday cake. The amiable Raul provided the tea making facilities and displayed a willingness to make our stay a good one. Raul got me another birthday cake, thank you Raul.

In general the staff are excellent and among the best in London.
The room was kept clean and tidy and I must give a special mention to the housekeeping staff who were quick to right any shortcomings.

On departure the car was ready and loaded at 5.30 am as requested. The bill was ready and once again a great example of professional staffing.

The not so good stuff-
The shower is powerful but the hot/cold control is so sensitive you scald yourself.
The toilet has a weak flush, it is not a water saving method when you are flushing it three times.
The Breakfast was below par, the Dorchester Bacon Butty was cold. The English Breakfast was tepid to hot depending on the sample.

We are unlikely to return to the Dorchester given that you have a plethora of 5 Star hotels to pick from in London. They are all similar money and equally well staffed so we do not deliberately seek a better option, maybe they have to be 100% perfect to get us to return. Although, we do enjoy trying other hotels in different areas of London too.

Once again, a big thank you to all the staff for making our stay a good one.
Merry Christmas.",5,2017,12,20
130,Perfect Luxury!,"Recently  my colleague and I have been frequenting London due to work. And each time finding the perfect hotel night is always a chore for us. This hotel came highly recommended by my boss and I must say it was well deserved. From the check-in till the check-out, everything was too perfect. The decoration is exquisite and the staff were are all very nice and welcoming. We had the best 3days of relaxation and pampering after long meetings/conference. 100% coming back very soon in the New Year. Thanks a lot for the hospitality. ",5,2017,12,17
130,Immaculate Service ,"The Dorchester has excellent service and a great location in London. I would highly recommend the afternoon tea . They have great finger sandwiches, scones and jam. 
There is also a great selection of teas. The location near Hyde Park and Mayfair makes it very convenient . This is one of the best hotels in the world .",5,2017,12,17
130,Great service,"Recently stayed at The Dorchester for an evening function. It was magical experince with Christmas in full swing, including a choir at the bar.
The staff could not do enough for us from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
The hotel and the team are highly recommended",5,2017,12,15
130,Classic Elegance and Style,"Well luckily enough I've managed to stay in some very nice London Hotels but this was on another level. From the moment you arrive you feel the History and ambiance of the place. Staff at reception could not have been nicer, we were looked after by a very nice Asian intern, who checked us in, showed us upto our suite and ran through all the room facilities. The rooms were spotless as you would expect, Bar area and the promenade area were excellent. Unfortunately we never got to dine there as we had reservations for the weekend, but that will be put right on our next visit. Overall a fantastic hotel in a very good location, right up there with the very best. Definitely our Hotel on the next visit.",5,2017,12,12
130,Christmas meal in the Orchid Room/Holford Room,"The Good Bits

Been quite a few times for our company's Christmas get-together.

A Beautiful place outside , reception, Christmas tree's etc is stunning.  Staff are really good , helpful and well turned out.

Great atmosphere.

Their were 70 of us attending for a 4 course Christmas meal.

Tables were set beautifully.  Wine service excellent - Particularly in the Holford room before hand.  

The best part of the meal were the deserts,  (I had two).  works of art.

The not so good points

Only one roll offered throughout the meal.  Main meal of Beef, were very small although tasty. Not enough extra veg offered no gravy.  A Huge gap between courses, nearly an hour.  Coffee was revolting cold .  

Considering this was around £115 per head - not quite so 5 star.",4,2017,12,12
130,Wedding Anniversary & 51st Birthday Celebrations ,"This year to celebrate our wedding anniversary & my 51st birthday we returned to the Dorchester, upon check-in we were presented with a complimentary room upgrade, a bottle of champagne & mini birthday cake in room; very special touch! 

Disappointingly the rest of our four day stay was not quite up to standard with very slow service at breakfast, hard poached eggs & cool to warm food.  Upon drawing this to the staff's attention we were told all the food is cooked fresh & comes straight to table.

I then ordered one pancake to replace my cold, hard eggs; which sadly after a further 15mins never arrived.

I shared our breakfast experience with one of the 4 hostesses at reception who immediately apologised & promised to follow up & at the very least remove the charge from our final bill.

We arrived back in our room later that afternoon  to a very apologetic handwritten note with another bottle of champagne together with a lovely selection of cheeses.

Upon checkout we were told the Guest Relations Manager did want to speak with us but was busy with other guests & that the hotel was fully booked & rather stretched.

We've always adored the Dorchester & very much look forward to spending time in their lovely hotel, however based on this visit we are seriously considering the Ritz or one of London's other luxury hotels for our celebrations next year.

130,A fabulous stay,"I stayed at the Dorchester for a week long business trip and it did not disappoint! I had been looking forward to staying at the Dorchester ever since booking as it is such an iconic London hotel. My colleagues and I checked in early morning upon arrival which was quick and smooth, and we were taken to our rooms. I was staying in a standard room which wasn't massive but a good enough size for one person. The bath and shower facilities were great - I loved the shower amenities and the shower pressure was just to my liking! The bed was also really comfortable and I really liked the old worldy decor in the hotel. 

As it was late November the hotel was getting in the festive mood so the reception was filled with Christmas decorations including a Dorchester replica gingerbread house which just added to the hotel's ambience! The location of the hotel is fab for seeing some of London's best sights and the staff were very pleasant throughout our stay. I didn't eat at the hotel but had a couple of cocktails at the hotel bar which were delicious.

All in all a fabulous stay and I would love to come back again in the future.",5,2017,12,02
130,Oasis of Luxury in the heart of London,"The Dorchester has been an icon of the London Hotel scene since the 1800's. I can say without question that it still is, tradition and class are at the heart of this hotel and this shows nowhere more true than with the staff, each and everyone was smiling and friendly and always willing to assist, even the security staff who are normally grim and sombre! would recommend it wholeheartedly for a long weekend London break.",5,2017,12,02
130,"Amazing hotel, old English style. Beautiful. ","First time We have stayed here and we loved it. The hotel is stunning, the rooms are small for the money but really beautiful. The bathrooms are all white Carrara marble and fantastic. The staff are brilliant. The entrance and main promenade is so lovely. The breakfast is fantastic. The only problem is a bottle of peroni is £9 plus 12.5% tip for your convenience. Champagne £20 per glass and rose Lp £27. What a place. A real treat. ",5,2017,11,26
130,Didnt live up to expectations,"I stayed at the Dorchester one evening with a friend, and can say it didnt live up to expectations. Its one of those hotels you dream about staying so we took the plunge. Our room was beautifully decorated and our bathroom was amazing, large and wonderful tub, however we had to call down to reception for an iron, and basic items such as water etc. We ordered room service and it took 90 mins for it to arrive and when it did it was the wrong items, when we called down the operator said our food would be 45 mins, but lo and behold within 10 mins the correct food had arrived albeit lukewarm. The beauty and aesthetics of this hotel are unmatched but I think it needs to improve on consistency and service.",3,2017,11,19
130,60th Birthday couples Trip..!,We recently had 3 nights at the Dorchester and it was above & beyond FANTASTIC..!  Would recommend anyone having a special occasion or any other trip to London to consider this hotel.  The Dorchester made us feel special as soon as we arrived & that carried on till we'd checked out.  For my 60th birthday they upgraded our room to a suite and sent several lovely surprises.  Apart from this just the level of service and attention went above & beyond what we'd expected - an absolutely first class hotel with very traditional  high standards...Emma Deflorian the guest services manager was attentive to our every need - as were all of The Dorchester team.  This hotel made us feel very very special and I cant thank them enough.  We will definitely be back.,5,2017,11,16
130,Long walk from Crystal Room to toilets. ,"Attended a lovely dinner in the private function room called the Crystal Room on the first floor. Impeccable service and fine food for 50. 
My only gripe is that there are no toilets close-by and you have to traipse back to the reception area. ",4,2017,11,09
130,Amazing exoerience,"Part of a team that won a night here in company of some famous faces.

A truly memorable experience, I'm more of a air b&q kind or travel lodge, so can't compare with other grand places.
Luxury, comfort, attention to detail, amazing food, attentive staff and the timeless feel of the place gave a glimpse into another world often seen in classic movies..
It was an honour to visit and an honour to have had the chance to do alongside many deserving winners! Fantastic!",5,2017,11,07

I wanted to donate to a charity but rather than write a cheque we decided to live up to mum’s party animal spirits and join this amazing afternoon for Children in Need run by BBC radio 2 at the fabulous Dorchester. The whole building was so gorgeous, staff awesome and food and drink to die for. Will never forget this memorable day. Thank you.",5,2017,11,07
130,As good as it gets,"Enjoyed the most amazing meal at The Dorchester.
I'd booked a table in The Grill but due to unforseen circumstances was unable to be accomodated there and took dinner in The Promenade instead.
This is, without doubt, the best dining experience I have ever enjoyed and worth every penny.
From the valet parking to paying the bill everything was better than I expected and I'll certainly be back.
The staff are simply excellent and perform every duty with grace and genuine concern for your satisfaction.
Thank you staff and management of The Dorchester for such a memorable and enjoyable evening.",5,2017,11,06

130,Fabulous! ,Me and my mum came here for the Sleeping beauty afternoon tea. It was amazing. Me and my mum do afternoon tea often but this is by far one of the best we have had! The food was amazing and the servers were wonderful. The performance was a nice touch. Everything was so delicious ! Took a doggy bag home with us since we couldn’t eat it all. Everything was so well thought out. I am so glad we booked to come here. We will definitely be coming here for afternoon tea again - excited to come back! ,5,2017,10,27

Booked months ago to get a slot and it didn't disappoint.

The Sleeping Beauty performance was a lovely added touch and made the experience extra special.
We couldn't manage all our cakes so we got lovely posh doggy bags to bring our cakes home.",5,2017,10,25
130,Decadent afternoon tea which needs some improvements,"I was looking to book an afternoon tea in London for my friend’s 40th birthday and we thought well why not just go for it at the Dorchester.

We had an enjoyable time but the service was not up to the level we had expected.  When we first arrived we felt ignored and had to wait a couple of minutes before anyone asked to seat us.  I told the waitress I was vegetarian but when she brought the plates she asked whether I eat fish (if I did I wouldn’t be vegetarian) and when I said no had to go back to get me some vegetarian sandwiches.  The sandwiches were not that great and I couldn’t even eat a couple of them.

However, they then started to redeem themselves by bringing delicious scones and cakes, all at once so we didn’t have to wait for anything else.  I had stated when booking that we were there for a birthday and a waiter brought over a delicious looking chocolate cake, exquisitely decorated and with a lit candle.  It looked great and my friend was really chuffed.   However, the timing of it was a bit strange, as you’d think they’d bring it when we were on the cake course. Also, when other people were delivered their cake the singer sang Happy Birthday to them but my friend unfortunately did not get this.

My favourite thing about the tea was the rhubarb conserve they brought with the scones which was absolutely delicious, a lot nicer than the traditional strawberry jam which was too runny to even put on the scones.

The cakes looked lovely but didn’t taste as amazing as they looked.   We were offered a second round of tea and I greatly enjoyed the spicy karak tea. 

We appreciated that we weren’t rushed out.  In fact, our booking was at 5:30pm and we didn’t leave until 9pm, although we did buy an additional glass of champagne.  The only downside was that our table wasn’t cleared so we had to sit looking at our dirty plates until we left. 

All in all, we enjoyed a decadent afternoon but small improvements in the service would have made it perfect.",4,2017,10,23
130,"Authentic Afternoon Tea, teminiscent of a bygone ear","myself and my husband celebrated our wedding anniversary over Afternoon Tea.  The ambience of The Dorchester is second to none, akin to the days of Downtown Abbey.  Food and service were wonderful, highly recommended",4,2017,10,23
130,Sunday afternoon tea to celebrate a birthday,"Did not stay but had a delightful time. Excellent afternoon tea with delicious sandwiches, cakes and scones beautifully served and accompanied by music from the piano. Selection of teas to try and with helpful advice from the server.",5,2017,10,23
130,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed at the Dorchester many times both for business and with my family.  Each stay has always been enjoyable and the staff are super helpful.

On a few occasions there have been press junkets for hollywood films which has been entertaining and my favourite place is always in the downstairs bar, where it is quiet and you can overhear the journalists conversations as to how their interviews with the stars has gone!

However, my favourite stays have always been with my family.  The rooms are as you would expect but the afternoon teas are sublime.  Even when we do not stay at the Dorchester, we always have afternoon tea with them.  I have tried numerous with my wife over the years and this is by far and away the best in London.

I know this is a small thing but when you get out of the lift, take your shoes off and scruntch the carpet between your toes (obviously when no one is around).  It is a great way to unwind after a long day in the city, either for fun or business.",5,2017,10,22
130,Grand as ever,"Had an opportunity to stay at this grand hotel again and was not disappointed. You are greeted warmly when you enter and check in is swift and quick. The receptionist is always willing to show you to your room.  Once inside, the rooms are grand as ever and so are the bathrooms. Amenities in the room and bathroom are great. We normally want to wake up early and make your own cup of tea in the morning. The tea coffee making facility was missing but we called and asked for it. We were immediately delivered an electric kettle, tea and coffee bags and milk for our stay.  The afternoon tea at the hotel is also great. And what to say of the location, excellent!",4,2017,10,21
130,For the luxury lovers,"The place is really nice and service is perfect. Of course it is expensive, but if you do not really think about the money, it is worth visiting.
Many famous TV, sports stars and politicians could be seen here. Dorchester attracts like a magnet all kinds of interesting people.
Food in the restaurants is tasty, deserts are divine :)
Do not even need to comment on wines- you could choose from the best.",5,2017,10,21
130,A memorable meal,"I had visitors from Jenna staying with me and they wanted to thank me for my hospitality. I had the choice and found the Grill Room at the Dorchester on book a table..
We were greeted at the reception  by a handsome and. Dry friendly young man, he asked us if we would like to leave our jackets with him and we said we want to see how warm it is, he said no worry we can give it to him after, he got us seated, took our jackets,  roughy a cloak Room ticket as well as a cushion for my back. Wow what  service.
The menu was very good, a glass of champagne was included in the price I had  a potato and leak soup and my cousins had the smoked almon, All was. very good and very well displayed the service was excellent we got a free email starter as well a free entry after desert, out
R waiter was Etienne very helpful, as mains I had Belly Pork a very big portion, berry tasty it. Are with some vegetables, one cousin had half a Chicken and the other had a Sea. Beim all came with some vegetables, for Afters, I had a pear almond tart with ice cream, one had the chocolate pudding with ice cream and the other just ice cream.
The place is so beautiful, we found the whole experience something I can highly recommend to everyone. The only thing that was not perfect, a couple of man sat with the heir shirt sleeves rolled up. It did not bother me over much, but my cousins where slightly shocked.",5,2017,10,18
130,Not very friendly...,"I've been to the Dorchester many times, some of which were to eat at China Tang and others were visits to the bar. On this occasion myself and a friend simply wanted to stop by for a cup of coffee in their lounge area at 9pm - they said we could but it would be £30 minimum spend per person. It was practically empty and they still wanted to enforce a minimum spend even though we only wanted coffee. We'd just had a huge dinner nearby and only wanted a drink before we went home. We declined and went to The Lanesborough down the road which is always welcoming and you can sit and have as little or as much as you want. I think it's a bit ridiculous to enforce a minimum spend like that especially as no other 5* hotels I've been to do this... (Claridge's, The Berkeley, The Lanesborough, Bulgari Hotel, The Ritz etc..) 
Won't consider The Dorchester as a dining location again ",2,2017,10,14
130,Very expensive!,Class place and brilliant location. Very popular hotel but prices impact the type of clients that stay here as is evidenced by the cars parked outside the hotel. You can get a burger in the bar area ....from £42! A tea and coffee in the cafe ....£13.50.,5,2017,10,12
130,Champagne and Dreams,"WOW! The staff at the hotel is out of this world! Everyone was so kind, helpful knowledgeable and professional. I want to especially thank Purna for the amazing champagne suggestion and detailed history of the partnership with Laurent-Perrier You will not go wrong with this champagne! Also wanted to thank Raj for special room service.  So quick to run back to make my daughter happy. Everyone was amazing in the restaurant.  I wish I remembered all their names.",5,2017,10,11
130,Simply the best,"Myself and the champagne princess have visited The Dorchester, one of Londons flagship hotels, on a number of occasions. This time, for some cocktails and another visit to the Dorchester Grill. 

For those of you who haven't visited before, you're in for a treat. The second you walk through the doors you are treated like royalty. The staff, are all immaculately dressed, super attentive, friendly and the absolute paradigm of professionalism.
The hotel itself is, as expected, extravagant, opulent and refined. Certainly not showy, but rather, understated and typically English. 

The bar, at which my girlfriend valiantly attempted to drink her way through every cocktail, is smaller than you'll think but the cocktails are (in her words) the best you'll ever sample. And she has had considerable experience in this field. Even so, she was hugely impressed by the Shimmer cocktail which came with a lip gloss which subtly altered the taste whilst being worn! Amazing!

After pre dinner cocktails, we were shown to our table. Once again, the staff are simply outstanding. The maître d chatted happily about the architecture of the room and you get the impression that all the staff have been highly trained to converse about pretty much any aspect of the hotel and the services therein. The sommelier was the most knowledgeable we have ever met and Claudia (my resident wine expert) took advice on board and selected a wonderful red with the meal. 
A word of warning though, the freshly made bread (in particular the Stilton bread) was too moorish and I had to ask the overly generous waiter to stop bringing more over for fear that I'd consume so much that I'd bring shame upon my family. 
The food was, and I don't say this lightly, some of the best I've ever eaten. Perfectly cooked and a wide selection to choose from. Service was perfect with the staff excellent at pitching themselves in a friendly and not overly formal way. It's a rare thing to find and very welcome. 

To conclude, eating and drinking here is a truly wonderful experience. Food and drink is exquisite but the staff are the real heroes of the hotel and deserve to be praised. They are a credit to the hotel. You won't ever be disappointed here. ",5,2017,10,08
130,Lovely luxury place,"Two of my Arab friends came to London for a short visit. They stayed in this hotel for few nights. I had to stay with them for two nights. For sure if you are looking for a luxury hotel, without doubt this hotel answer all of your needs. For sure I recommend it.",5,2017,10,04
130,"A five star hotel by any definition, but...","The Dorchester is five star by any definition. The physical plant is beautiful and the service is flawless. My room was beautifully appointed with all the top of the line finishes you would expect. When I had trouble with my thermostat maintenance was there in five minutes and solved the issue. The valet was able to launder and press my suit in half an hour and return it to my room (at 10:45 pm). The only mildly negative thing i can think of is that the other hotels lower on Park Lane are more convenient to the tube but i think I may be the only person who stays at the Hotel who uses the tube.
My only criticism is that unlike a lot of the other four and five star hotels which seem to cater mostly to business travel the Dorchester seems to cater almost exclusively to
Middle Easterners. The result is the atmosphere of the hotel isn't one of business travelers going to meetings but one of Middle Eastern families coming to London for leisure.",5,2017,10,03
130,"""Exceeded Expectations""","

Once again we spent the weekend celebrating our anniversary at The Dorchester Park Lane London, we had a truly memorable weekend and cannot wait to return next year.
Time and time again we return and they always deliver the same level of service from the minute we arrive through to departure. On arrival the concierge and porters take care of the car and luggage, guests are then greeted at reception and no matter who welcomes you it's always with a smile and total professionalism. This is a world class luxurious Hotel and in my opinion the Number 1 Hotel  for central London. We will always recommend this Hotel to all of our friends and colleagues.
We were shown to our suite by a lovely hostess who went through all the controls for the TVs and heating etc. Our luggage was already in the room with our suit holders hanging in the wardrobes.
The suite  was pure luxury in every sense of the word, very spacious with a large entrance hall, a gorgeous lounge dining room where we had breakfast every day this was superb, freshly cooked with a selection second to none all laid out by our own butler service who were all amazing. There was also a massive bedroom and super sized bathroom. 
A card and champagne for our anniversary had been left on the table with best wishes from the General Manager, including chocolate, fresh fruit, fresh flowers and a gorgeous anniversary cake.
They really do help you make memories that will last a lifetime.
Following our stay last year I really didn't think they could do any better but once again I have to say, that everybody excelled and we had the most fantastic stay and we really are looking forward to staying again next year.
We had made a reservation to eat in ""The Grill at The Dorchester"" we had eaten here before and enjoyed the food and service, once again they did not disappoint, we had a fantastic meal which we enjoyed throughly, this is  Michelin star food - without the stuffiness and pretentious of more formal restaurants. The Scallops are amazing cooked to perfection, the steaks were melt in the mouth perfection!
You just couldn't fault the staff they are  impeccably informed, warm and friendly and nothing was too much to ask.
Pre dinner drinks in The Bar is a must.
 The bar area is warm, friendly and very relaxing. They have a very immpressive selection of spirits and a wonderful choice of champagne!
The bar staff were fun and had some great suggestions for pre dinner drinks and after dinner cocktails.
All in all we have to thank the General Manager through to the concierge for another perfect weekend and a wonderful anniversary, many thanks we look forward to seeing you all again next year.

130,Amazing!,"Second year celebrating me and my best friends birthday at the Dorchester! Amazing food, great service and beautiful interior. Only criticism is the waiters not introducing themselves.. constantly had to shout ‘excuse me’ and put my hand up to try and grab someone’s attention. Also, they made such a big deal of us not wanting to pay service charge, it’s optional so we shouldn’t feel pressured to do so. All in all, amazing experience. ",4,2017,10,01
130,Anniversary treat ,"Opulent, comfortable, discretion and professional, celebrity sighting frequently, strives to meet guests every need, rooms wellserviced with amenities, excellent dining options, perfect location close to attractions yet away from the bustling crowds ",5,2017,09,21
130,The best cocktails in town! ,"Went for a few drinks with some family and we were spoilt for choice with the cocktails but we all had different and they were amazing!!!

We had some nibbles as well and our waitress even escorted me to the loo!

The service was flawless and as ever the flowers looked stunning.

Coming back in October and I can't wait! ",5,2017,09,21
130,5 star hotel with 2 star service,"Arrived at 4pm and was told to sit and wait ion a side seat whilst the reception checked with housekeeping to see if the room was ready. (Check-in from 3pm?) Left waiting for 10 mins, the receptionist had clearly forgot and when prompted tried again.
One of the keys didn't work in the lift and the assistant duty Manager said i will get you another one, this didn't appear.
Arrived back in the afternoon to find a cleaning cloth on the bathroom floor, this was even missed by the night turn -down service in the evening.
Newspaper turned up on one day but not on the other.
Noticed a half eaten peach by the lift on a ledge at 6.30pm, this was still there at midnight, clearly ignored by staff.
When i complained at check-out, i was asked if the hotel could contact me about the issues, guess what, i haven't heard anything since. 
Please don't reply to this review and to apologise and say our standards did not meet yours on this occasion but please contact us to make another booking and we will give you a better service, don't bother, put all your efforts into looking after your current guests. My advice is to avoid disappointment, stay at The Rosewood, a far better service!",2,2017,09,21
130,Pre proms in the park lunch,"What can I say-expectation was there for the obvious reasons as an iconic venue for food in the famous grill. Customer journey from start to in between each course and the finale was perfect. Attentive service, naturally executed,not too much and great chats with the various team members who look after you in the 2 hours. They don't need my recommendation as the experience is still fresh as it was 20 years ago.",5,2017,09,21
130,Memories are made of this,"A special birthday surprise and from the moment of arriving after letting the hotel know 
of the event. The birthday boy was greeted by all members in each department 
With a Happy Birthday wish, from Breakfast to Dinner. Elegance,sophisticated 
a huge memory. 
No one could be disappointed even without a celebration 
.",5,2017,09,14
130,Lovely evening ,The hotel decor is really second to none- rows and rows of fresh flowers. The service was great. We had a light bite in the Grill with a lobster Caesar salad which was about £50. So a pricey evening but worth it. Live music only added to the occasion.,5,2017,09,11
130,Does what it says on the tin,"Probaby two types of clientele stay at the Dorchester: the widely reported rich and famous, and then those who are earnestly working through their bucket list and have the Dorchester as one of those things one ought to try (a bit like a parachute jump). The whole package (staff, services and amenities) are all that is promised, and we (of the latter category of visitor) were warmly welcomed, and we thoroughly enjoyed our few nights. The rooms are what any luxury hotel ought to provide, but special mention for the beds which were superb and the bathroom which was quaintly engaging. Breakfast is a holiday treat on its own, and the evening with friends in the Alain Ducasse restaurant was sublime. Don't think about the money (if you need to, don't go) but I fully understand what it must take to run an institution like this. The only murmur was the permanent feeling that we were being ever so very slightly patronised as it was clear this was special for us. Perverse, but there it is. Especially embarrassing to have my (much loved) nine-year-old Audi delivered to me in front of the parade of this year's Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Bentleys and the odd Porsche slumming it like us!",4,2017,09,11
130,Fantastic experience at the Spatisserie at the Dorchester Hotel,"We had the pleasure of dining in the Spatisserie at the Dorchester Hotel for lunch and were astonished to have the whole room to ourselves. It was more or less private dinning and we were very well looked after by the spa staff. 

Very relaxed and calm ambiance which makes you pretty much switch off easily from the world. 

Great and tasty healthy food too - loved it!",5,2017,09,03
130,Saturday lunch,"Wonderful lunch and beautiful dining room. The staff were so attentive throughout with solid knowledge of the menu and wine on offer. Food beautifully presented. 

 Many thanks to all that looked after us on the day. ",5,2017,09,01
130,Excellent,"From you enter the hotel it's obvious that the service is high class. We would have appreciated a more attentive staff in the lobby restaurant / tea room area. The ambience is full score, fantastic tea and food. ",5,2017,08,31
130,Luxury and best customer service,"I been in this hotel visit a friends and we been able to have the best experience ever.  Reception staff really helpful, concierge team elegant and exclusive and always looking for the comfort of the guest.
 The best moment been enjoy the afternoon tea as the options that they offer you in there is quality and the experience is unique.
 Highly recommend it for a exclusive stay in London",5,2017,08,30
130,Amazing Afternoon Tea,We visited for afternoon tea as a group of 6 ladies celebrating our 40th birthdays.   The experience was great.  We had cocktails in the bar then our afternoon tea.  Customer service was excellent and very attentive.  Afternoon tea was fabulous.   Thanks also for the birthday cake.  Afternoon tea was one of the highlights of our visit. ,5,2017,08,26
130,Great experience,"Went to the Dorchester with my colleagues for a conference...
Incredibly amazing service by every single member of staff, kindn and professional.
I'll definitely recommend this place to anyone aiming on quality service and old fashioned elegance.",5,2017,08,25
130,High tea at the Dorchester,"This was a surprise afforded me by my friend whom I was visiting in London. My friend told me in the morning before we headed off to the British Museum that I would probably want to wear a collared shirt that day as he had a surprise in-store for me. I had no idea at all but knowing my friend, knew it would be a goody.
After traipsing around the very beautiful British Museum for 5 hours it was time for a coffee. We left the museum and jumped into a black cab (my first black cab ride) and some muffled instructions were proffered from my friend to the driver.
The next thing I know we were at The Dorchester. The very best high tea I have ever enjoyed. From the first glass of champagne (which had several refills) to the sandwich tasting to start it was a delight. The room itself screams luxury. This is after the liveried doormen have greeted you. The smell of fresh flowers and expensive scents and the overall opulence of the room was truly breath taking. The sandwich selection and the sweet offerings to follow were delicious. Truly spoiled. If ever you want to do something outrageous while you are in London, I cannot recommend this treat too highly. Just do it and to hell with the expense.",5,2017,08,21
130,The devil's in the detail!,"My husband booked the Dorchester up for a surprise 10th anniversary weekend away and we were both very excited about staying for three nights. We arrived at around 19:30 and were efficiently checked into our suite overlooking Park Lane. The suite is superbly appointed, with a separate living / dining room, a marbled bathroom with a deep tub and plush furnishings throughout. 
We were quite hungry by the time we had settled in so opted for in room dining. We ordered fish and chips for my husband and a salad for myself. When the food arrived, they'd only prepared for one cover (even though I clearly pointed out that my husband was having the fish and i was having the salad) so a second set of cutlery was missing as were the mushy peas to the fish course. We just grabbed the cutlery that was out for the fruit basket and tucked in. We were too tired to call up re the missing peas so just enjoyed what was a superb meal. 
On going to bed we noticed that the street noise was quite audible, despite the attempt of dampening the sound by having internal sliding windows in place. These didn't join up, so did little to keep the traffic noise out.
We turned in at around 21:30 and put the do not disturb sign on. As the suite is in fact made up of two interconnecting rooms, we did not realise that we would have had to put the privacy light on at both doors, would have assumed this would have been activated both ends when hitting one button. So at just past 21:30 we had a persistent ring at the door that did not have the light on, making us crawl out of bed to ask re the turn down service.
Surely if you know that a suite has two entrances you check both doors before knocking on the door at that time of the night? Also isn't this rather late for a turn down service.
On waking up the next morning, we noticed that the Nespresso capsules had not been replenished, nor was there any milk available. There were only two capsules left, so clearly had not been checked before our arrival.
Made our way down to breakfast but before then checked at the front desk re making dinner reservations in the inhouse restaurant for the same night. The staff on the desk seemed to be very confused as to what times the restaurants were open and when we enquired about the breakfast options (buffet vs à la carte) more confusion abounded.
Breakfast at the grill was hands down one of the best we've ever had in a 5 star hotel. Selection, quality, service we're outstanding. Very impressive indeed and the highlight of our stay.
We ambled into town soon after and arrived back at around 11:00. Just as we were about to leave again, a staff member checked in re our stay. We asked her to please replenish the Nespresso coffee capsules as well as re stock the mini bar which we'd tucked in the night before. She assured us this would be done.
4 hours later we arrived back at the hotel to find that the above had not been actioned on. My husband called housekeeping to ask to have the mini bar re stocked as well as the coffee capsules replenished! 30 mins later, we were given two cups with a couple of sachets of instant coffee!!! Slightly confused, we communicate to the staff member that this is not what we'd asked for and pointless to boot as we didn't have a kettle in the room.
10 minutes later the staff member returns with a kettle!! By this point my husband was getting rather annoyed. All we wanted was the Nespresso capsules and mini bar restocked!!! We must have had three more interruptions of various staff members to come in, take away the kettle and bits we'd never asked for and finally deliver what we'd wanted in the first place. By the time this was sorted, it was around 16:30! Even then, some items on the mini bar were still not delivered. By then we'd given up on calling yet again!!! Tiresome and all down to not being listened to. Our requests were clearly communicated and very very basic! Come on The Dorchester, the devil's in the detail and all of the above irritations were down to in room dining not listening to our simple requests or not passing on the correct information internally. 

The next day, we left the hotel at 09:30 and arrived back at around 15:00 with last nights mini bar still not having been replenished. We were tired and just wanted a quiet few hours in without a potential ring on the door again later on. Also, by this time my husband had had enough and went to talk to the guest relations manager. He informed her of all the shortcoming mentioned above and to her credit she listened carefully, without becoming defensive. But, as I'm writing this review the morning after, our mini bar still has not been checked or filled up again!!!!!
We got an apology from in room dining re the kettle and room service sloppiness which we appreciate.
In summary, all I can say is, pay more attention to detail, it's sloppy and careless behaviour that soon ads up and tarnishes a stay that should have been perfect. 
That's what we paid a vast amount of money for after all!!!
Based on the above, I'd take my money elsewhere next time and would not recommend the hotel to any of my friends or business connections. What a shame The Dorchester 

",3,2017,08,20
130,"Old World Feel, Great Service","I arrived about 9 a.m. and my room wasn't ready, which is understandable. They allowed me to use the nice spa facilities to shower and change for an appointment that morning. By the time I was finished the room was ready, which was nice.  The room has antique furnishings a nice large bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable. The lobby and common area is definitely old world with elaborate decor and architecture. The small parking area out front had some of the most amazing privately owned cars I've ever seen. Great location across the street from Hyde Park but a bit of a walk to catch the tube. I was working a lot during my two days in and outside of London but would have loved to spend more time there. Perhaps another day.",4,2017,08,18
130,Outstanding!,"This was our third trip back to The Dorchester and once again it exceeded our expectations. 
From the warm and professional greeting to that first sighting of the Promenade I literally love everything about this hotel.
Breakfast each day is a delight with service so unobtrusive you barely notice it.
If only for afternoon tea make sure you give this world class hotel a try. You won't be disappointed!",5,2017,08,12
130,LOVED IT,"Lovely food served with flair and elegance.   Reasonable portions and good quality bread to add to meal if needed.   Be aware of high cost of bottled water which is automatically replaced as used - all of a sudden we had spent 21 pounds on water!   After our three course meal we were offered a further small dessert (gratis) which was a nice touch.  
Elegant decor and excellent service.    Free bottles of water in foyer.    I nearly got into a chaffeured Rolls Royce parked at the door to finish my experience - I wish!
(Check Bookatable for offers)",5,2017,08,09
130,Highly Recommended,"Our group stayed here on several occasions and found the overall service and amenities excellent.  Staff presented as helpful, authentic and professional.  Any issues were dealt with immediately.  Really impressed by the care and support shown by all staff.  A pleasure to stay here.  Hyde Park was handy being right next door, and it was an easy walk to the main shopping hub.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,08,04
130,Elegant ,"We called here on a Sunday evening for a meal. The restaurant had an elegant feel to it, with deco appearance. The food was beautifully presented & the service impeccable. My husband is still raving about his salmon main course and soufflé dessert now. We found the price quite reasonable for London too. We will certainly be back.",5,2017,07,31
130,The Perfect Hotel,"We decided to revisit the Dorchester Hotel on out 1 year wedding anniversary. Once again the service was superb. We got an upgrade to the Mayfair suite which was such a delightful room, or should I say rooms... Their attention to detail is incredible. We received champaign, fruit etc and a lovely anniversary cake all complimentary. We also received 2 'well wishing' letters from the hotel mangers. Made us feel very welcomed. It is 'The Perfect Hotel' and can't wait until next year on our 2nd anniversary.",5,2017,07,31
130,A Fantiastic hotel which helped save my friend!,"I wanted to write and thank the team at the Dorchester. While in the car park my friend had a severe asthma attack and was struggling to breath. While all members were exceedingly helpful - Marcin Jervzal stood out. He came over stood with us for twenty minutes and talked my friend back into a more calm state in which he could survive until the ambulance arrived and upon arrival directed it to us. It was beyond the call of duty and I cannot thank both him and the doormen enough. 

This hotel has set the bar in service and I am not sure the outcome would have been so smooth without the help of the team and Marcin. Whenever I return to London I will be sure to stay with them - not only is the hotel great, the food lovely at China Tang, but they have a life saving team!",5,2017,07,30
130,My favorite hotel,"Located in Park Lane, which is a prime London location this hotel is very luxurious. The feel good experience starts with the doorman and the service throughout is exceptional. 

The rooms are very well furnished. I had a suite facing the park and it was not only massive but the most beautiful room I have stayed in. Luxurious and well appointed.

They serve amazing breakfast at promenade and have a lovely Chinese restaurant. The bar is also very good and they have their own very special gin called Dorchester. 

As you get out of the elevators you smell Arabic perfume. This was the most amazing experience I had till date.",5,2017,07,27
130,"Twenty Four Years since our last visit, still very good but ...","We stayed five nights late June. For our first three days London experienced a heatwave (30-34C). AC in the room was weak, did not reach bathroom or vestibule area, and certainly did not cool public areas well.  Eighth-floor room was very nice but cleaning/turn-down service were lacking/shoddy. Breakfasts were good but crowded, and staff over-loaded. Gym is miniscule and trainer/clients left little space for hotel guests. The hotel is still very nice, notwithstanding, the Bar is very special and the location on Park Lane near Hyde Park Corner the best.",4,2017,07,23
130,"Great hotel, very good location.","Service is impeccable, they will do everything to please the customer. The rooms are comfortable and lovely, everything is clean, decoration beautiful, feels like home. No problems whatsoever! Enjoy the restaurant or room service if you are tired, no problems at this hotel. We will definitely go back when we visit London again.",5,2017,07,22
130,Not what it used to be!,"My husband and I had afternoon tea at The Dorchester on 4 July 2017.  I've always claimed that tea at The Dorchester is the best in London, and enjoyed the event several times during previous UK visits.  We were aware of the dress code (especially as the email reminder went into great detail about the expectations) but were disappointed to see no enforcement of the rules.  Once of the pleasures of taking tea is being in elegant surroundings with well-dressed people.  So I was shocked and very disappointed to see women in jeans, leisure trousers (effectively pyjamas!) and men in polo shirts.  We arrived a few minutes before our 3:45 reservation and were immediately shown to our table.  However, nothing happened until the appointed time, despite there being many empty places.  We were presented with a palate-cleansing floral tea, which was for later in the meal, and then the fresh but very ordinary sandwiches arrived.  I would have appreciated a cup of tea at that stage, but apparently that is not their procedure.  The scones were tolerable, but the ""homemade jam"" with which they were served was so runny it ran straight off the scone!  Embarrassing!   We chose the Wimbledon tea, which was a mistake.  The cakes were designed with a nod to tennis, but they were just clever designs and not delicious food.  For the money, this is absolutely not good value.  There are many other London establishments which offer a far better tea for less.  I think this hotel trades on its past name and reputation and it no longer lives up to either.  I do not recommend this tea.",3,2017,07,19
130,Afternoon tea- fantastic,"We enjoy an English afternoon tea and have visited many interesting places from country tea rooms to luxury hotels. The Dorchester rates as one of the best. Grand surroundings, service that made our anniversary celebration so special and afternoon tea at its best.

Highly recommended........ We will be back.",5,2017,07,19
130,A delightful birthday celebration with my dear hubby,I absolutely love this hotel and restaurant.  The best quality evening meal and stay in a lavish place perfect for a cosy romantic dinner which my dear hubby always gets right!👌🏼have been a few times now...😍,5,2017,07,18
130,Cold tea and hot air,"Went here for afternoon tea. Pleasant surroundings, but ... cold tea? How difficult can it be to get the most simple things right? Astonishing. Even when the refills came, the water wasn't properly hot. Ultimately the grandeur and pomp are lost when a place falls down on the basics. With standards having slipped like this, the impression remains that this is a place living on its past. Just another overpriced London 'experience', unfortunately.",2,2017,07,17
130,Excellent service and luxury,"Impossible to find something to criticize if money is not important. From the moment´you enter the parking lot to the time you leave, you feel like a very important gust. Luxury, but not in an uncomfortable way. Room was great, spa was great, and everything was great. Luckily enough, we paid with air miles. We hope to be able to return.",5,2017,07,16
130,Fantastic ,"Stayed here as a treat. What a amazing place. Loved every minute of our visit. Our room wasn't ready so we went into the bar, complimentary of The Dorchester. Then we was given a free upgrade. The view of the park was a added bonus to. ",5,2017,07,14
130,If you can stay here once in your life - do it,"I have travelled all around the world, staying in lots of different hotels. But as an experience and a story this was amazing as little 8 year old Beth. Yes I must admit my review may be outdated but I am sure they still live up to an amazing expectation. It was my brothers 6th birthday. My dad had ruined it by working and then being ill. So he asked my little brother what he wanted to do to make up for it. Thomas only listened to his mum at this time. You couldn't separate the two of them. My mum had been talking about the Dorchester for some time and so when the opportunity arose - guess what my brother said he wanted to do. 'Dad I want to stay in the Dorchester and I want to go to Hamleys to buy a toy car.' So that's how it happened. I remember being a keen writer even at a young age. anywhere we would go I would write a review of the hotel. So I gave no hesitation about being honest here. I left the review for the maids and somehow it got to the manager of the hotel. I moaned at the time that they had no pool and the television didn't have enough good channels. It was funny really and later I got a personal letter from the manager which I still have. As for the hotel and the room. It was spotless, the bed were the comfiest I have ever stayed in and the people really went out of their way to help. The marble bathrooms were stunning and I remember at the time just finding it so pretty. At breakfast time we all sat round in a very posh dining area. you could hear a pin drop. We all ordered our breakfast and after eating it, my brother very loudly mentioned that 'it wasn't as good as little chef.' My parents died, I laughed and people around dropped cutlery with a loud weighty clang. To him it obviously wasn't satisfactory. But I personally remember preferring it to little chef as that place is rather gross. I tell this story a lot and so just thought I would tell it here. Enjoy! I want to come again as older Beth and hopefully write a better review - we shall see. (The date listed will be wrong for which I apologise)",4,2017,07,14
130,AmaIng afternoon tea,I visited this hotel for my sisters afternoon tea birthday. It is undoubtedly the best afternoon tea I have experienced. The setting is beautiful but it is the customer service which is truly exceptional. I highly recommend visiting this beautiful hotel .,5,2017,07,13
130,A special experience,"Went for afternoon tea during Chelsea flower show.  The aroma and display of flowers when we arrived was breathtaking a great start to a great afternoon.
As one of us did not each sandwiches, we were offered an alternative from the menu and had a Caesar salad which was delicious.
The cakes were amazing to look at  plentiful and delicious to eat, the service was impeccable very attentive but not at all pretentious.

All in all it made for a very special day out and although quite expensive I would say the experience was well worth it.",5,2017,07,11
130,My all time favourite ,"When I was younger I always remember coming here for tea with my family. It's almost a tradition now so whenever I'm in London I try to reserve a table. However I don't only LOVE this place because the amazing atmosphere , service and religious sandwiches and scones but because I really appreciate how they dealt with a certain incident that happened to me while having tea there with my husband last year. I wish I had posted this last year already, but I wasn't so comfortable with trip advisor then.
My husband and I were sitting enjoying our tea when a mother and her daughter were shown to the table next to us and the daughter made a super racist comment ( towards me ), obviously thinking I didn't understand. I ignored them until it just became too much. I turned around and said something back but I became very emotional and started to cry . I think that freaked them out a little so they left . The waiter then came to ask if everything was OK . I managed to explain what happened and he was amazing and so was the manager on duty at the time. To cut a long story short , they didn't let us pay for our tea and were just amazingly professional in the at they dealt with what happened. So to all The Staff at The Dorchester, thank you and so sorry it took me this long to write this review!",5,2017,07,10
130,Afternoon tea,"Had Afternoon tea on a Friday, very nice, the new tea was ok, but the. Real fast blend was better, did not finish the cakes so was given a doggy bag. Champagne nice in the promenade, but more expensive in the bar. ",4,2017,07,04
130,Afternoon tea,"We went for afternoon tea it's was the second time for me, I was not disappointed it was great it is the only place where you can have as many sandwiches as you want and they keep bringing the desserts too it's not cheap but worth the experience. ",5,2017,07,03
130,Perfect English tradition,"This hotel is great
Perfect english tradition
Service is impeccable 
The concierge are very helpful and have great ideas and recommendations
There is a special desk to book the shows
The room was beautiful and offers everything one needs
The massage we had at the spa was very good",5,2017,07,02
130,Poor quality service,"The quality of service spoilt our stay here. The room was not ready by the evening, and my boyfriend was irritated that the champagne and birthday cake he had ordered in advance were also not in the room when he was finally able to check in. There was no answer from the reception desk despite ringing them a few times, so he had to return to the reception desk to make his enquiry. The corridors smelt of stale tobacco smoke. The room was comfortable as you would expect, but the experience was quite disappointing. He complained the following morning and received a discount on the room.",1,2017,07,01
130,Lovely French waiter,We come for dinner on Tuesday night with a voucher we had won at a charity event. The food was amazing we would highly recommend the lobster chowder.  I would like to take the time to thank our lovely French waiter he is training with the Dorchester he made our evening extra special with his great service and friendly chat a great member of the team.,5,2017,06,30
130,Afternoon Tea,"Located in front of Hyde Park , This Hotel is beautiful , the afternoon tea was delicious, the ambiance was great , the service was oustanding specially the italian waiter which was very helpful and answered all our questions in a very efficient way! , there is a pianist too , a must -go if you are visiting London , it is better to make a reservation ahead of time because it is usually pretty booked!",5,2017,06,27
130,Amazing experience ,"My husband had planned a surprise to celebrate our anniversary. We stayed here An had booked spa also... upon arrival we were greeted by there friendly staff. Check in was smooth an the whole experience was outstanding. As soon as you enter it's a ""wow"" kinda reaction very clean an maintained lounge area. The room was a little small but I guess that's how london rooms are. 
We went for drinks in the bar an the live band was amazing. We both are vegetarians An the breakfast I had was defiantly one the best! The staff took great care of our needs. 
The spa was equally great they always went out of the way to ask if we were ok. All the treats were egg free An replaced with fruits An mocktails etc I was surprised how each staff member managed to wish us for ""happy anniversary"" an we're so smiley. 
I have stayed in the Atlantic in Dubai An felt this hotel was as good in customer service as the Atlantic. Definitely would recommend this hotel/spa for family An couples. ",5,2017,06,27
130,FREAKING AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I come here every year and ever time I'm always pleased. The manager Rob, Mari, and other staff was outstanding. We had a few issues but Rob superseded our expectations in accommodating and making sure we were comfortable.

Because of his awesome ability to manage this hotel and great people skills I WILL be back again and again and again.
Congrats to whoever hired him.... you did a great job!",5,2017,06,26
130,Fabulous!!!,"We went on a date night last weekend and from the start of our visit we're wowed by the standard of service and attention to detail from all the members of staff who we met.  They couldn't do enough for you.

The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated with fresh flower displays.  The staff were extremely knowledgeable and attentive whilst discreet - a fine balance.  

Our meal was beautifully presented, well crafted and was absolutely delicious.  

We loved our spending time here and definitely hope to be back!

Would highly recommend!",5,2017,06,26
130,Perfection doesn't ALWAYS just happen,"Finishing up a multi-night stay at the legendary Dorchester...

Plusses
- Great location
- Class and $$ pervade at every corner (a fleet of luxury vehicles surrounds the front entrance)
- Attendants at seemingly every turn wishing you a ""cheery"" good day
- Room very nicely appointed with high quality furnishings (four phones?)

Negatives
- Some carpeting and other areas looking a little tired
- Work out area highly outdated (small, cramped, no windows, but decent equipment)
- Had breakfast, twice.  English Breakfast way overpriced at 34 pounds.  On the second time, literally NOTHING ordered was brought correctly.  Couple next to us was to the moon with frustration on timeliness and quality of service.  Really quite amazing at how bad it was.  It is breakfast for goodness sake, and at 34 pounds, at a place like the Dorchester, it should be more than right.",3,2017,06,22
130,Afternoon tea at its best.,"June the 3rd was my wifes 60th birthday, so i and 2 friends this treat for her. This is our story.
  We pulled up in a taxi which a friend of ours owns, on arrival the door is opened for you and you are ushered into the main foyer. It is amazing like something from the 1930.s. Those of you who have seen the Poirot series will know what i mean. In fact you almost espect to see him appear. 
  You tell one of the attendants reason for your visit and then you are ushered to the Afternoon tea reception desk. Our time was for 4.30 pm but we arrived early but that was no problem as a table was waiting or us. to which you are taken. It is a long room amazinf flower arrangements various size tables are laid out. We had a 2 seater sofa and 2 enormous armchairs. 
 Settled in a tea menu is produced, so many to choose from. We settled for their own mixed blend plus breakfast tea.
 Our waiter was a young Malay gentleman i forget his name but he was brilliant, had not been working there that long.
There are plenty of others in attendence, they seem to glide not walk.Further down a piano is playing.
 Tea is severd in lovely cups each with its own strainer.
Yoy start off with various finger snadwiches, if you look on their website menu it lists them, anything you dont like just mention in advance and they will change it.
  Next comes 2 large warm scones plus stawberry jam and one other.Gorgeous. They also bring a large glass i would say jar of hot fruit tea which you drink between courses ithink it was peach but i stand to be corrected, this clears the pallet for the next course. It is beautiful.
Then come the selection od pastries heaven. As it was my wifes birthday they also provide a small birthday cake and when it is bought to the table the pianist plays Happy Birthday. She did this on at least 6 occassions whilw we were there. It is great for people watching we saw no one famous that day but just to watch is great. Drtess is smart casual and some of the outfits were amazing. We had all bought new items to wear. That is part of the fun of it.
   You are not disturbed but the staff are there if needed,as i said before they just glide. The rest rooms are awesome , i cannot speak for the ladies bur the gentlemens are 1st class. 
   During the course of the afternoon the tea is served again all with fresh cups. You have a 2 hour time slot but unless it is really it is not rigid. We were there from 3,45 pm until just after 6 pm.
  On leaving the doorman asks if you would like a taxi, we did and he just raises his hand and a taxi that is waiting just pulls up and takes you away.
   I was and i think the others a bit should i say nervous about going here, i have been to good hotels but nothing like this. No need to worry all those you meet put you right at ease, they are 1st class.
 This is the place to go for those special days. 
 We had the traditional afternoon tea which is £55.00 plus 12 and a half percent service charge. Well worth it.
You for extra have Champagne which i think is another £29.00 though i stand to be corrected on this.
 Go on give it a try, you will not be dissapointed.",5,2017,06,17
130,Extravagant!,"This is one of the best/most up-scale hotels I've ever stayed in. Be prepared to be amazed. The service is top-notch, food excellent, and entire staff over the top. The hotel itself is gorgeous with beautiful flower bouquets as soon as you enter, plush carpets on the floors, and intricate woodwork throughout. The beds and bedding extremely comfortable (imagine cloudlike and make-you-want-to-sleep in!). They have outlets for US plugs as well as European making the stay very convenient. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Within walking distance to many shops and restaurants.",5,2017,06,15
130,Lots of money... not worth the money ,"I had the highest expectations on this five star property.

Sadly the priority went to the International arrogance who paid the same dollars as I.   Example - elevator was blocked waiting for some sudo important person - problem is they only have two elevators - Oh My Gosh! 

The property is older and I'm sorry just not worth the cash.

",3,2017,06,15
130," Worth it!","My husband (and sometimes me) stay here a couple of times a year for business travel. The Dorchester is such an interesting place to stay - a confluence of British formality with international guests. Expensive, but worth the price. Strong international clientele with great people watching in the promenade. Rooms are decorated in English formality and could use an update, but very tasteful and comfortable. Great restaurants located within the hotel and hotel staff provides the best service one could ask for. On a recent stay my husband became ill and the hotel was able to have a Dr. see him almost immediately.  That is a small example of why this hotel is worth the cost. If you expect excellence when traveling, this hotel will not disappoint. ",5,2017,06,13
130,Weekend break,"Just had three nights at this hotel which was excellent, staff are helpful and cheerful, our room was large with a good view of Hyde Park and public areas are clean and comfortable.  We had breakfast in both the grill and the promenade both of which are good but unless you are in a hurry I would suggest using the promenade as it is all waiter service and has a more extensive hot menu.  We had both a dinner and Sunday lunch in the grill.  The dinner was excellent but the Sunday lunch less so, the roast potatoes left a lot to be desired as did the meagre portion of vegetables.  Looking forward to a return visit in October.",5,2017,06,10
130,Unforgettable,"Unique experience and amazing stay in this Hotel. the hardware /building and rooms/ might look old fashioned and slightly overused, but the sleep quality, the breakfast, the Wifi and room amenities are of outstanding quality.  however want makes the hotel truly different and one of the best i have seen in my relatively good and long life is the service, completely unbeatable and non-comparable by competitors! Bravo for the management. every penny spent here is invested in excellent experience and long-lasting memories",5,2017,06,10
130,A WONDERFUL HOTEL,"It was our second visit to this Hotel and as expected we were treated to a wonderful stay.
The Hotel standards are very high in all departments and nothing is ever too much trouble.
The Room was large and decorated beautifully
The food amazing
and the Staff were wonderful in all areas
A must visit for a Romantic break away...",5,2017,06,09
130,Nice Hotel,"We booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary.  We were only staying the one night, so it suited the purpose.  The location is OK, there is a large park opposite which after a day of sunshine was filled with rubbish.  There are a couple of good bars in the area that my husband and I visited on our way home.  The downside to the hotel is that the rooms are rather on the small side, and the bedroom doors are not sound proof.  Overall a very pleasant stay",4,2017,06,08
130,Afternoon Tea,"I have had afternoon tea in several places in London over the last few years. However, I have to say that afternoon tea at the Dorchester was way above my hopes and expectations, and far exceeded every other venue. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service we received was impeccable. There was a slight issue with our party being put on two tables, which I wasn't advised of when booking, but this was soon resolved and we were all able to sit together.

We were looked after by Punar (apologies I am unsure of the correct spelling) and then Francesco who were both friendly, considerate, attentive and unfailingly polite. The food was excellent in all respects, as were the bubbles and the wide selection of tea.

The venue itself has a unique atmosphere with huge flower displays and beautiful decor. I would highly recommend the Dorchesters afternoon tea.",5,2017,06,04
130,Pre Royal Garden Party,We came to the Dorchester Grill for lunch yesterday it was part of day out in London. The service and food was wonderful as I have experience in the past when I have been in London. The relative that came with me enjoyed all the theatre of the lunch and the surroundings. I would like to say thank you for making our day out wonderful.,5,2017,06,02
130,After theatre drinks," Every city has a bar that is a 'must visit', when in London that is The Dorchester. 
Old world charm combined with knowledgeable well trained staff makes the experience just that, an experience rather than just having a few cocktails.

Oysters and champagne is one experience, sitting at a well-stocked bar having a chat with the South American/Italian bar tender in these surroundings makes you feel 'at home'.

Every eye to detail is taken care off but you are not suffocated by over servicing. There is a fine line that never seems to be crossed that makes the experience more memorable.

Yes, you are spoiled for choice in London, but having tried many upmarket locations that I decided not to even review, The Dochester is the location of choice whenever we are in London.

130,Afternoon Tea,This place is such a delight! I booked afternoon tea for my partners birthday and i have 0 regrets. Everything right from beginning to end was amazing. The service the staff the hotel the atmosphere. I just couldn't say a bad word even if i tried. We were served my a lovely man called franceso he was extremely chatty and well mannered. I guess that is part of his job working in such a fine hotel. But this is definitely a must for anyone planning on a special afternoon tea treat. ,5,2017,05,27
130,Superb!,Top class place. Excellent central location and opposite the Park. From the entrance foyer to the interior it's old world and fantastic. Bar is off to the left and cosy with top class service. Food super. Recommended. ,5,2017,05,25
130,High tea at the Dorchester,There are so many place to go high tea in London.  One place that I always visit is the Dorchester.  The ambience is beautiful and the service is great.  It's a great place to spend the afternoon with friends.  It's seems like this place it getting more causal in their dress code these days.,4,2017,05,22
130,Always good but slightly deteriorated lately,"I have stayed here before but mainly I'm a longstanding and regular user of the hotel's various dining and drinks venues. The Promenade was always great for pre and post dinner drinks but more recently it has disappointed, with awkward rules for non residents and no matter how busy or quiet, it always seems problematic to get a table without some fuss and ultimately then being seated. Also, the nibbles served used to be excellent with superb almond stuffed olives and other lovely accompaniments, fitting with a genuine five start property, however this has all been downgraded and now one receives a bowl of crisps and cheap nuts - small thing but as regulars one notices and cost cutting seems unnecessary/irritating at this level. Service can be great and other times lacks personality and consistency. Overall good but not like it used to be.",3,2017,05,22
130,GORGEOUS IN EVERY WAY,"Amazing Hotel

Every thing is wonderful, the staff, the service the rooms.

The bathrroms are incredible, deep baths and lovely marble.

130,Familiar Luxury,"We love  The Dorchester. We know we will sleep like logs, be treated to the most excellent service and eat and drink the finest food and wine.

130,London's N.1 afternoon Tea with a dedicated service...,"We are a group of European Languages Teachers with the love for afternoon Tea and almost every week end we visit a different location to experience their Afternoon Tea.

Yesterday we had the pleasure to visit the Dorchester. We must say that it was an amazing and unforgettable experience, first of all  for  the food and cakes quality,  but in particular  for the dedicated service we experienced. Francesco,  our waiter was one of the most professional and spectacular entertainer, while he was of course assisting other customers he made sure that we had full attention and we had what we needed at all the time with a big smile on his face!  Every single member of staff came to ask if everything was OK.  I would recommend to anybody to have the same experience...We must say that Afternoon tea at the Dorchester is London's N. 1!

 Although we are sure we will go back soon, i want express my gratitude to Francesco and to the rest of the team for their dedication to service and  for making our experience unforgettable.",5,2017,05,15
130,Great location,"Mighty expensive but you can justify it with the location across from the park and the staff they have on site. They didn't get everything right (the room service in particular) but the gentlemen at the front desk always made up for it and were classy about everything. The spa was as good as any I've been to. Beautiful rooms and views.

130,Quite stunning,"I went for an annual corporate lunch today with over 300 guests

I'm looking forward to next year ",5,2017,05,12
130,The Dorchester  - An Exquisite Look at Old School Luxury,"With it's regal allure and ideal location, The Dorchester certainly lives up to its iconic reputation the moment you arrive. Situated on Park Lane, minutes from Buckingham Palace and Kensington Gardens, and just across the street from Hyde Park, the Dorchester (for me) is a breathing space from standard luxury accommodations. 

My Studio Suite was elegant and insanely spacious. The marbled bathroom and lavish accouterments were the perfect amount of pizzazz without delving into the GRANDMA territory! 

Part of the charm in this glorious five star luxury hotel is the fact that the ambiance retains that RICH and FAMOUS branding it became known for when it opened in the 1930's. If those hallways could talk...well, I know that the floors can because as you're walking along some of them, underneath the carpeting you can hear the sound of creaking boards with every step. 

High Tea at The Promenade is an absolute must on every level. It's sort of like the calm before the storm if you're evening includes cocktails at China Tang. I recommend both experiences at the Dorchester. Afternoon tea at The Promenade for its scrumptious pastries and fingerling sandwiches, and China Tang for its view of intriguing high society minions and moguls as they ""air it up"" among each other. Jump into the mix, it's fun. You can always shower it off when you return to your beautiful room.

The Staff at the Dorchester are second to none, from the top of the ranking tier to the bottom. There is a sense of great pride felt from everyone and it's of no surprise since The Dorchester is one of the worlds most prestigious and expensive hotels. Don't expect to use your coupon book in this deliriously divine establishment.",4,2017,05,10
130,25th Wedding Anniversary ,"This is THE most beautiful hotel. The staff treat you like you are their only guests and they will do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. Andrea on the front desk greated us when we arrived and we had been given an upgrade owing to our special occasion.  She booked us in and took us to our room and explained everything to us. I had been given a bouquet of flowers by my husband and I asked for a vase to keep the flowers fresh until we came home. The florist took the flowers, arranged them in a vase and then the next day re-wrapped them so I could bring them home.
We had a card in the room from the hotel and a cake which was just so lovely. 
The room was amazing. The bed so comfortable with pillows that your head just sinks into. 
Bathroom had a massive bath and separate shower so there was a choice. 
Andrea also arranged for the spa to call so I could book a treatment! Small things that made a big difference to our stay.
The spa was fantastic. The massage by Leanne was lovely, relaxing just perfect (and I have had a lot of massages before). I got a present from the spa staff as well for our anniversary. 
When we checked out the staff again were so helpful. We left our bags so we could have a wander around. 
Treated like royalty doesn't even come close to how everyone looked after us!! I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. I wish there were more words... But I hope you get the drift.",5,2017,05,10
130,Excellent and memorable,We stayed here for a celebratory long weekend and from the minute we arrived the service was faultless. It was so good to stay somewhere where traditional hotel courtesy is observed . This hotel is just so special and  we would return in an instant. ,5,2017,05,09
130,Birthday Surprise ,"From when I started to arrange my husbands 50th Birthday, Emma F, the Sales Support Manager has been FANTASTIC! What a wonderful hotel. The beds are like clouds to sleep on. The baths are as deep as boats! The staff are polite and lovely - nothing is too much trouble! They really made a fuss of my husband inc sending him 3 birthday cakes and a card! Food is glorious and we are just off for a couples massage! Definitely a 5 star hotel! Can't fault it! One very small thing that would be a nice touch would be tea and coffee making facilities in the room. ",5,2017,05,08
130,Wow,"We stayed at The Dorchester years ago, it was very Beautiful , Perfect Location, Great Service , Great food. It was very expensive but well worth it! It is hard sometimes to pick the perfect hotel for everything and this was it. If I go back to London this will be my first choice! ",5,2017,05,06
130,Wonderful Stay at the Dorchester Hotel,"We (2 couples) had the pleasure of staying at the Dorchester Hotel in London, from 4/1 through 4/7/2017.  The iconic Dorchester is a 5-star hotel with a stellar reputation for luxury and service.  When problems arise (and they inevitably do), how the front desk resolves issues is what separates the good from the excellent hotels.  The Dorchester is an excellent hotel and richly deserves its reputation.

Immediately upon entering the ornate lobby, we were warmly welcomed by the smiling receptionist.  Since we were assigned to different floors, we were separately escorted to our rooms.  We had booked Superior King’s, but were both upgraded to Deluxe King’s.  Even in the same category, our 2 rooms had different layouts.  Our room was richly decorated and the bed felt firm. We were on the 3rd floor and had a view of the interior garden/courtyard.  We never heard a peep from neighbors or from the hallway.  After a wonderful dinner at The Grill, we settled in for our first night.  This is where the problems occurred.  My sink filled half way by the time I finished washing my face.  My husband’s sink drained just a tad better.  I stepped into a steaming shower to adjust the water temperature, only to find myself holding the handle -- it had completely come off the wall.  The final issue came at bedtime.  The vent faced the bed, so the air blew on our faces after we laid down.  We could not adjust the vent direction, so had to turn off the heat entirely.  We reported all 3 problems to the front desk and were offered a choice of moving to another room now or the next day.   Their sincere attitude really made the difference.  Rather than being annoyed, we just laughed off the issues and went to bed.  When we came down for breakfast the next day, the receptionist offered to pack our bags and move us to our new room.  Our new room was immaculate and everything worked as expected.   Great job.

The concierge desk arranged our tickets to the Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London.  Due to security issues, Westminster Abbey was closed on the day we wanted to visit.  Our tickets were cheerfully refunded and the service charged was reversed.   The concierge desk went out of their way to mark locations on maps and dispense helpful tips to ensure we would have a good time.  

Throughout our stay, we ate at the Grill (twice – awesome food), Alain Ducasse (good) and China Tang (meh).  With the exception of a surly server at the China Tang, everyone we encountered at the Dorchester, from the wonderful servers throughout the restaurants, smiling receptionists at the front desk, ever helpful concierge, to the doormen who always greeted us and the ladies from housekeeping who said hi, were warm, helpful and courteous.  Morgan, our wonderful waitress who warmly served breakfast every morning at the Grill, is an asset to the Dorchester.

This was our first visit to London and at the Dorchester Hotel.  We will definitely be back.",5,2017,05,06
130,High tea cannot be better,"When you like to experience a level of service and a feeling of luxury that you would associate with decades ago, you should book a high tea at the Dorchester. Service is excellent, food is great and the atmosphere is too exceptional to be described.",5,2017,05,06
130,"""Excellent Afternoon Tea ""","Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester .The service from staff is second to none and couldn't do enough for us.We we're greeted at the door and made to feel very special indeed . The afternoon tea is absolutely first class with lovely surrounding and couldn't wish for anything better .
Waiting for our next visit .",5,2017,05,04
130,Just Fantastic,"Everything about our stay was absolutely wonderful.

We booked a night in a superior room for our 3rd wedding anniversary.

On arrival, we were greeted warmly by Andrea on reception who advised that we’d be upgraded to an executive room due to our diamond status.  She asked the reason for our visit and my wife mentioned that it was our anniversary.  Andrea made a call to check if our room was ready but it was still being checked so we were ushered into the bar for some cocktails.  Andrea came back about 15 minutes later to take us to our room which had been upgraded again to a ridiculously opulent Dorchester Suite complete with butler service.  This suite sells for almost ten times what I’d paid for our room so I was astonished by the upgrade.  The finishing touch was a small anniversary cake which the staff had left for us.

The suite was spectacular.  It had a huge 4-poster bed, a stunning marble bathroom (with the deepest bath in London, apparently) and a very comfortable sitting room.  Everything was exceptionally clean and the suite (and the rest of the hotel) smelled great.

All of the staff we met were fantastic and the service we received from the moment we arrived until we (very reluctantly) left the next day was top notch.  Nothing was too much trouble and everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming.

We’ve eaten at the Dorchester before so we knew that the breakfast would be great and it was.

We had quite a few cocktails in the bar and they were also incredible.

I don’t have a single complaint about any aspect of my stay and would not hesitate to recommend the Dorchester to anyone looking for a taste of luxury for a special occasion.  Everyone went above and beyond to make sure we had a truly memorable anniversary and we can’t wait to return.",5,2017,05,02
130,The meaning of the word Luxury,"This place has it right. You walk through the door having already been greeted by the bell boys and are treated as special as anyone else. 

Lovely friendly smiling staff to book you in and show you to your room. 

The rooms are like something out of a fantasy. The hare a real treat with everything spotlessly clean. 

The teams who sort the rooms really do an amazing job and have an eye for detail giving each detail that special touch as well as smiling and being extremely friendly. There is no RUSH RUSH, WIPE, SWEEP......

The staff will go out of their way to give you anything you need and nay help you need. Ok, you are paying a pretty penny to be there but regardless, you really get the feeling that if you asked for lessons in Wrestling with a woolly Mamouth, they would come to your room leading the beast by the trunk and pass you your leotard.

Definitely one for anyone's bucket list.",5,2017,04,29
130,Excellent ,"Visited with family for 2 nights. This place is pricey but defiantly worth the extra dime, you do feel like royalty the moment you check in. The decor is grand and service can not be faulted. 
Breakfast is great, massive selection. Afternoon tea is delicious. There is live music in the bar area as well which makes the setting perfect. ",5,2017,04,26
130,Wedding Day - Magical,We were lucky enough to get married in the Dorchester. It was a wonderful experience. The hotel staff cannot be faulted in any way.

130,Officially My Favorite Hotel in the World!,"My family visited The Dorchester to celebrate my Parents' Anniversary. The staff at The Dorchester were the most warm and inviting people ever! I cannot commend them enough for all the services they provided for me before, during, and after the trip. We absolutely adored the tastefully dressed doormen. I loved coming back to the hotel after a night out at Leicester Square or shopping from Bond Street to have the doormen welcome me back to the hotel by name. Natalie at the Spa took care of my family so well! She was always smiling and bright. She made sure I was well taken care of, especially when I got a severe fever during my stay. 

I would especially like to commend the wonderful Alice at the front desk who took care of us throughout our five-night stay and made sure all our requests were met with care and precision. Despite checking in very late at night, Alice continued to strive on having our requests executed for room type. She personalized everything, making sure we were able to have a view and separate shower and bath. When she escorted us to our room on the first night, Alice acknowledged we were upgraded to an Executive Deluxe King Room. Alice did a phenomenal job showing us around the huge room; however, my parents and I were slightly disappointed that the room was outdated and not renovated. We did not want to acknowledge the concern that night, as it was already late and we wanted to get to bed. Two days later, we were getting annoyed from the creaks throughout the flooring of the outdated room and the impossible-to-control television. I immediately contacted the front desk to address my concern, and they were extremely accommodating and immediately moved to the Park Suite-such a heavenly suite! Our stay was beyond spectacular from there.

Afternoon Tea was fantastic! The scones are the best I have ever eaten. It was a real gem. I really wish I got the name of our waiter, as he was so fun to talk to! He acknowledged my obsession with the scones and the smoked salmon sandwich, thus he prepared an entire set for me to take upstairs. Security was wonderful. They were always near the elevator after dark, and the room keys were very hi-tech and only allowed guests up to their assigned floors.

Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay. The communication among the staff is one of the most efficient I have ever seen. I bought a box of a dozen Lauduree macaroons for the General Manager, Roland Fasal, acknowledging in a letter his amazing management and thanking him for the wonderful stay. I dropped it off at the front desk, but I have never gotten any confirmation that he received it, so I hope he did! Just like how its pristine service influenced Four Seasons' CEO Isadore Sharpe to open his first hotel in Toronto four decades ago, the hotel has inspires me to continue my dreams of being in the hospitality industry. I hope to continue exploring the world and getting a chance to stay at all Dorchester Collection properties!",5,2017,04,22
130,Excellent as ever,"As ever our stay at the Dorchester was fantastic. We had two junior suites / both are a good size and classically luxurious.

130,Simply Perfect !,"There is nothing that can fault The Dorchester. Everything from the moment of our arrival to our departure was exceptional. The hotel has a very buzzy atmosphere as well which I loved. The staff are wonderful, especially the doormen !! Looking forward to returning soon.",5,2017,04,17
130,Tea at the Promenade - Exceptional,"Make a reservation for afternoon tea.  The Dorchester tea is an experience to savor.  The sandwiches are very good especially the salmon.  Start with the signature blend Dorchester tea, it's delicious and since they allow you to change tea throughout the service you can try a couple of flavored.

The best part of the experience is the service; very handsome young men from various places in Europe will delight you with attention to details and knowledge of tea.  Desserts are beautiful and very tasty but plan on taking with you as it can be quite filling.",5,2017,04,15
130,Treated like royalty,"No question this is one of the finer hotels of the world. Walk through the doors & you feel like royalty. Walk in the room & you know you are. I was here for a casino convention - my Japanese boss offered to either buy me a Louis Vuitton handbag or one night at the Dorchester for working so hard. I take life experiences over material goods any day, so here I was at this lovely, lavish hotel. Thank you Mr Nakamura!",5,2017,04,13
130,Fantastic location and best service in town!,"When we arrived at the doors, we could not believe the location we were in. Just in front of Hyde Park! What a spot! The doormans are lovely and welcoming, the reception staff is efficient and quick. Our room was very big for London and that was a very good point to raise! The cocktails at the Bar are very well created, the offer is large and the staff is absolutely amazing. I did not expect such a level of bespoke service. Thank you again and I will be back!",5,2017,04,12
130,London Break,This hotel is exactly as it says on the tin. Full of history. Very pleasant hotel. Great staff. Great food and drinks. Cannot be more simpler. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were given wonderful service. I would defiantly recommend to anybody.,5,2017,04,12
130,Home away from home,"We stayed here for 3 nights, what a wonderful experience. From the time we walked in I felt at ease and welcome, the check in was very pleasant, although we were early the room was ready, after checkin the luggage was delivered quickly. The rooms are beautiful and very tastefully decorated, they are good size and comfortable. The service is excellent. the staff at reception, concierge, in the promenade, bar and restaurant were always very helpful and efficient. The breakfast is fantastic. 
I can't fault anything, the stay was excellent and really enjoyable. 
A special thanks to Kieran Byrne for organising the whole stay. I have stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels but this is what they should aspire to achieve. we would be back soon.",5,2017,04,12
130,Meeting ,"Had a business meeting at The Grill restaurant amazing restaurant and top class service ,not cheap but worth every penny . 

In the party of four three people were vegetarian and they went out of there way to cater for us . ",5,2017,04,11
130,A beautiful lunch,I went to the grill room in a mixed aged party of 6. We had a beautiful lunch from the set menu which was delicious and beautifully served and the staff were very attentive. The only slight flaw was that one of us ordered a chocolate soufflés and received a pistachio one. Although it was delicious perhaps it could have been replaced or compensated for in some other way. That being said I would certainly return given the chance!,5,2017,04,11
130,Great Hotel,"wonderful reception with a pleasant welcome told me I was going to have a pleasant stay.  My room was small but quite lovely and situated on Park Lane we were near all the attractions London had to offer.
Next time i shall have a slightly larger room, great all round service and dont forget to have a few drinks at the bars.",5,2017,04,07
130,Hustle Bustle in a Fun Way!,"We enjoyed the comings and goings of people who seemed to be both guests and others there to dine in the good selection of restaurants. Rooms were very clean, elegant and hotel staff were friendly and service oriented. People watching was interesting and hotel location is excellent as walking to attractions and shopping was possible. Our breakfasts each morning were absolutely delicious and the spa is gorgeous!",5,2017,04,06
130,AGM and ceremony,"The hotel has a grand feeling as you approach the front steps , have the door opened by the staff and enter the reception. 
It is definitely one of the top hotels in the country with prices to match.   The food is always perfect, and the whole hotel is luxurious",5,2017,04,03
130,A night of elegance,"You are greeted by a soft hum as you enter the beautiful hotel on Park Lane, a world away from the busy London streets. Located a short distance from the famous Hyde Park, at the heart of Mayfair, the Dorchester really has a prime position in the West end of London. We were lucky enough to stay over night, our room being luxurious yet remaining elegant and simple. One thing I will never forget was the comfort of the bed, which we practically had to climb to get into! The staff are above professional going out of their way to ensure you have an amazing stay. Breakfast was held in the main foyer which is also home to several top bars to be frequented in the evening. This is a hotel of real class, definitely a recommendation if only for a drink at the red bar. (If you are able to go in December, you will be blown away by the Christmas decorations!)",5,2017,04,02
130,Expected a lot better! ,"Hotel rooms are very run down.. safe didn't work in our room and shower didn't work properly would either scold you or freeze you. Very rude female member of staff in the bar when having evening drinks. Spa not good for couples as the steam rooms are separated so couldn't spend time as a couple in the spa. 
There was a whole security team of 5 males located just outside our room for another hotel guest who stood there around the clock and made me feel really uneasy and I didn't sleep at all due to this! 
On a better note, when we checked in the receptionist was very welcoming and the food in the bar and restaurants I couldn't fault, but I definitely expected a much nicer stay from a top class hotel. Would not recommend or return for an overnight stay. ",1,2017,04,02
130,Faultless,"Without doubt the best hotel I have stayed in. I have been to many top class hotels around the world but The Dorchester beats them all into a cocked hat!  Outstanding attention to detail and nothing is too much trouble for them. My wheelchair accessible room was perfect as was the wheel in shower room. All hotel staff are thoughtful, attentive and have a respectful informality. Although we were staying for a charity function somehow they knew it happened to be our wedding anniversary and a beautiful cake was delivered to our room completely to our surprise!.",5,2017,03,31
130,Excellent afternoon champagne tea,"My brother in law had booked here in advance for a very special occasion as he was receiving his MBE from Buckingham palace from Prince  Charles. On arrival we received a very warm welcome at the door and on entering found the Dorchester absolutely beautiful with fresh large flower displays everywhere, the hotel is stunning. We were greeted by very polite, pleasant staff and were showed where to take our coats. We were then seated in a beautiful area of the hotel called the promenade where afternoon tea was served, staff were very attentive and made sure we had all we needed. We were first served with a flower bulb which is put in hot water, it slowly opens which is a special tea and served in a glass which you drink as it cleanses your palate. Then we were asked what tea we would like from the menu which was had a very big selection, then we had a glass of champagne, a selection of fine tasting finger sandwiches and when finished asked if we any more, then we had either plain or fruit scones with either strawberry jam or pear jam with clotted cream. We then had a very fine display of small cakes, again we were asked if we wanted any more. Cakes that were not eaten were put in a beautiful box with ""The Dorchester""written on which was a lovely touch. A truly memorable afternoon for a very special day which we will all cherish and never forget. ",5,2017,03,26
130,Nice weekend,3 nights great break . Nothing is  ever too much they deliver with a smile ;-) everything went exactly as we wanted ! Will return ! Great restaurant ! Alain Ducasse fantastic restaurant ! We have dine here a few times !,5,2017,03,24
130,Best weekend of my life!,"From the moment we were welcomed at the airport, the Dorchester staff could not have been more accommodating.  Upon checking in, we were kindly upgraded to a beautiful suite that overlooked the Park.  A sweet welcome note from the General Manager was in our room along with several beautiful flower arrangements.  Dinner at The Grill was fantastic...the food was delicious and the service impeccable.  China Thai was an amazing meal as well...some of the best Asian cuisine that I've ever tasted.  To top it all off, we got engaged!!!  We celebrated with the jazz band after dinner at the piano bar.  Such an unforgettable stay...we will definitely be back!",5,2017,03,21
130,Amazing Surprise Over night stay,My husband bought me to the Dorchester for a surprise over night stay! Lovely hotel full of lovely helpful staff. A little over priced but hey ho that's The Dorchester Experience! Gotta give it to them the breakfast was amazing!!!!! Lovely memories for us to both cherish,5,2017,03,20
130,Best weekend of our lives! ,"We stayed at the Dorchester for one night, ostensibly to celebrate our 6 year anniversary, although unbeknown to my girlfriend, I was actually planning  to propose to her! I rang the Hotel in advance to let them know and they were amazing! They literally couldn't have done more to help me plan everything, down to the smallest detail. Several members of staff contacted me beforehand to discuss different options and ideas and to iron out the practicalities. They kindly upgraded my room to a suite and set it up with champagne, flowers, fresh fruit, cakes and 'will you marry me?' Written in rose petals! They created a CD of our favourite songs which was playing on loop. They took us to a different room first so that she didn't suspect anything, then after leaving us a few minutes, came to the room and offered us an upgrade because a 'better room had just become available.' The hotel even looked after the ring beforehand so it was already in the room and I didn't have to worry about not losing it whilst checking in. After she said yes (hurray) all the staff were incredibly kind and excited for us and keen to congratulate us and sneak us free drinks and cakes and more food than we could eat. Simon from security in particular may actually be the the kindest and most helpful man we have ever met. We were able to check out late so that we could stretch out the occasion. We were quite literally in the company of celebrities and billionaires (there was a £2 million Ferrari outside) however we were made to feel that we the most important two guests in the whole place. We have had the best weekend of our lives and I don't think either of us will ever forget it. Thanks so much! Tom and Linzi. ",5,2017,03,19
130,Outstanding!!! ,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted with warm and friendly staff. A special mention to Tiffany at reception. Our check in process was equal parts of seamless and exciting! She delightfully explained all the facilities and restaurants then continued to escort us to the ""Park Suite"". My mother and I were speechless to say the least! This Suite is fit for a Queen 👑👑👑 Thank you for the most wonderful welcome I ever received in my travels around the world! Especially to Tiffany! 👏🏻👏🏻",5,2017,03,19
130,Afternoon tea,"Going into the hotel it was very welcoming and offered comfortable surroundings.  The indoor staff were very helpful and attentive, without being intrusive.  The food was very fresh: an interesting selection of sandwiches, scones with preserves and cream and a selection of cakes from a cakestand - for each individual customer.  There was a choice of drinks - champagnes, and an extensive list of teas to choose from.  I chose 'Bankok' a honey-coloured tea with an aroma of coconut and enjoyed it greatly.  We were unable to finish all our little cakes although we woulld have liked to, because each individual cake was a triumph of the chef.  The hotel provided an attractive cake box for us to carry away the ones we could not finish. 
Indoors I was very impressed, and wish to compliment our waiter George.
On the forecourt I was shocked by the attitude of a forecourt attendant (who seemed rather full of himself) and this might put me off from booking again.",4,2017,03,18
130,Top marks,"Perfect start to our weekend in London - we had lunch in the Grill at the Dorchester last Saturday.  Our table was not quite ready when we arrived so we had a drink at the bar whilst a pianist entertained us with her talented playing.  The men had bottled IPA London beer, whilst I had a glass of crisp Chablis and my friend had Rosé, and how lovely to be offered olives and nuts without having to pay extra!!

The lunch consisted of three courses with two choices for each course (and a couple of optional extras).  Two of us chose gravlax and the others had the equivalent of breakfast, egg, mushrooms and bacon but prepared and cooked in a light frothy sauce.  Main course my friend had fish and we all had duck confit.  The men raved over theirs but I thought the sauce was a little strong (but I don't like soy sauce, so it was probably just not to my taste).  Deserts - the men chose Rum and sultana soufflés (for a supplement) and we had a lemon tart which was presented as a white meringue dome, filled with a sharp lemon mousse.

Our waiter Max was wonderful, very professional and knowledgeable with a lovely smile and great sense of humour - the sommelier also was a credit to the hotel and steered us through the wine list with his recommendation on wines we hadn't tried before (we generally stick to Rioja's) but will definitely have again.",5,2017,03,16
130,The  iconic hotel at its best. Perfect.,"As soon you  enter the  Dorchester,  you are taken care by zealous hosts, by  the  reception, to the housekeeping, to the restaurants.
Nothing is ever too much and always delivered with a  smile.The breakfast at the Promenade is awesome, so is the Grill restaurant. Have a cocktail  at the Promenade and be serenaded by the  trio . 
it is  a Perfect stay.",5,2017,03,14
130,"Glamorous, fabulous exceedingly luxurious five-star hotel on Park Lane","The grand dame of Mayfair.. stayed at this fabulous hotel with my family for my mother- in- law's birthday. I would like to thank Mr Noel Cortez and his F & B team for baking my mother- in- law 's cake and for making her birthday celebrations a success.  Everything went exactly as we wanted, planned and executed with efficiency and friendliness. I highly recommend this team if you are planning something fabulous. 

We were treated like top VIPs from the very first day I went to meet the F&B team to organise the party to the actual day of the party. Nothing went wrong they were on point. Thank you..

We stayed in the deluxe king rooms which were spacious and overlooking Hyde Park. They had connecting/ adjoining  doors which was very convenient for us. Beautifully decorated in a classic English residential  style. The room was well equipped with premium things to make one's stay marvellous. The bedding was top quality Irish linen, blackout drapes/ curtains, bathrobes and slippers. Minibar and air conditioning. Turn down service. Free bottled water

The bathroom was white/ grey  Italian marble. Separate bath tub and shower which was powerful.  Exclusive toiletries created by Floris also liked that there were 2 basins. Soap, shampoo etc great. 
There are 3 restaurants .. had the joy of dining in China Tang a Cantonese restaurant opened in 2005 by Sir David Tang.  The deco is 30s Shanghai style. The food was delicious. Also dined at The Grill which does modern British dishes. The other restaurant is French  Alain Ducasse  overlooking Hyde Park which I did not dine in on this occasion.

We had afternoon tea in the opulent settings of the promenade. The service was exceptional  it really is indulgent, a must if you are staying here or visiting London. Sandwiches  were a selection of traditional egg, cucumber etc and scones  were hot served  with pots jams with clotted cream were constantly being topped up. The pots of tea refreshed and hot throughout. The pastries are so decadent. The hazelnut and elderflower layered cake was a runaway winner in my opinion. .  The whole experience will leave you very happy indeed. The dress code is smart casual to all out glamour if you wish. 
 The Bar is a magnet for the society darlings and a wealthy international clientele not too worried about the bills. The cocktails are perfectly executed and impeccably presented . Fantastic, sophisticated  buzzy bar. The best place to bump into  movers and shakers. 
There is also a  full service spa which is exquisite.  A fitness centre and valet service. 
It's within walking distance to  Buckingham palace about 15 min walk, Knightsbridge 10 minutes walk. I recommend Mount street gardens a block away from the hotel. 

Things I really liked at this well run opulent hotel:
- service
- great views of Hyde park
-afternoon tea
- The bar
- Exceptional spa
- people watching
-location
-florist 

Cons:
- very expensive 
- some rooms are small
- if you like minimalistic this is not for you
- surcharge for high speed internet

I highly recommend the Dorchester. The staff are outstanding. Attention to detail is exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble You made our family very happy and gave my incomparable mother in law the best birthday ever. Thank you.

",5,2017,03,14
130,By far the best afternoon tea in town,"Forget the rest come to the Dorchester. When you walk into the Dorchester you are transported into another world  For a few hours (if visiting for afternoon tea) you can guarantee you will be treated like someone special. Everyone is treated alike. You are a valued guest. Nothing is too much trouble.

It is grand but not 'stuffy'. The cakes are divine and the artisan bread used in the sandwiches is something a little different and if you can't eat everything there is no problem about taking it home in fact a large majority of guests do, so don't feel uncomfortable asking.

It isn't the cheapest in town but I would say it is the best so if you have got a special occasion or just want to be spoilt just give it a try. I can recommend their Christmas Afternoon tea too - magical.",5,2017,03,12
130,I love this hotel!  They make you feel so special ,"We have stayed at this hotel many times with my husband (with my children and on girls weekends) every time they never fail to make your stay perfect.  I can't recommend this hotel enough.  I have stayed at the Connaught, Savoy, Claridges and other lovely hotels and although they are all of a high standard and very nice, the Dorchester service, staff, 
food and attention to detail never fails to amaze me.  I can't wait to return this week for some quality time with my husband.  ",5,2017,03,11
130,Good location and friendly staff!,"Stayed in a queen room, which was quite well appointed with a nice bathroom outfitted in white marble. Even though I arrived at 8am, way before the 3pm check in time, the room was ready and the staff were extremely friendly. The hotel is located just across Hyde Park so it was easy to get to most attractions. ",5,2017,03,10
130,Afternoon tea ,"We had afternoon tea yesterday was made very welcome. Comfortable and luxurious surroundings a good place for a special treat. We started with sandwiches and were replenished until we had had enough. Then came scones with a choice of jams and clotted cream followed by cakes we couldn't eat them and the staff happily boxed them up for us to take home. 
Staff were all helpful and made it a special afternoon. ",4,2017,03,07
130,Perfection ,"Second stay at the Dorchester, it's a classic hotel with fantastic service. The staff cannot help you enough and the rooms are perfect. Every bit worth the treat me and my partner were spoilt. Hope to return again soon. ",5,2017,03,05
130,Excellent Romantic Break,"My wife and I stayed here for a get away a week ago on Friday evening. The common areas are a little maze like but the room was lovely and the service excellent. The bathroom could do perhaps with some updating but in every other respect the Dorchester was great. Breakfast was nice (room wasn't that grand for breakfast but the quality was great and the service good). We had drinks after dinner at China tang (in the basement of the Dorchester and the best chinese in London) in the piano bar area in the foyer and again, great service and excellent barman. When they brought our car around in the morning there was water and mints placed in each door. That's service and a luxury experience. Faultless and more personal than a Four Seasons style hotel, but an equal standard - there are no more the 6 hotels like this in the world and its a unique London experience.",4,2017,03,04
130,Wonderful ,"Brilliant afternoon tea with friends. Faultless food and service. Lovely decor. Very much enjoyed our afternoon tea here and will definitely be going again! Might be my favourite London afternoon tea so far 

",5,2017,03,03
130,excellent service and top notch food,"we visited the Alain Ducasse restaurant for a family celebration- the whole ambiance of the hotel and the restaurant is  supremely elegant and professional.  the taster menu is excellent, and if you are allergic to any food item, there is no issue about changing it.  the only thing i would comment on was the restaurant was a tad cold- and if you are in evening dress with no sleeves, then it is a bit chilly.  that said, champagne works wonders in warming you up.  well done to all concerned",5,2017,03,02
130,Couldn't have been treated anymore like luxury. (Stayed for 2 nights)," As soon as we arrived we were greeted with such politeness,with a couple of guys taking our bags to the bedroom. We we're lucky enough to say that we got a random upgrade to the deluxe suite and so did our friends (a couple) we came with. I wouldn't have minded either way,we we're situated on the third and fifth floor, our room was incredibly clean, the maids definitely needed a massive thank you from us. They would knock on our door in the morning and in the evening to ask if our room needed to be cleaned otherwise we could turn down the offer and ask for it to be done in the morning. Also Considering I have thee most worst ocd, I wasn't hesitant to sleep in our large Victorian looking bed,neither was I hesitant to get in the massive bath tub. Because they were ever so clean. In the morning we had our breakfast we we're given so many options for free, toast,different varieties of pastries and lots of spreads, we were completely spoilt.  We all as friends and family had an amazing,memorable stay at the Dorchester, me and my boyfriend are definitely coming back to stay weather it's next year or late this year. ",5,2017,03,02
130,Foundation dinner in a Ballroom ,"Stunning Hotel, absolutely out of this world! Bar extremely clean, sparkling with exceptional service and quality. Very expensive, but hey that's what you would expect at this prestigious venue. The dinner was outstanding and the service was a military operation, no spills or mistakes. Speedy tables cleared following each course. Starter Jerk Chicken, my favourite of the evening, really fabulous. Tuna steak was a bit raw for a few peoples liking, but how it was intended. Fillet steak was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth. Dessert was interesting with a fruit salad and almond sorbet, most liked it, but not to my taste. Coffee and delightful little cakes for final course, delicious.
A colleague got the pleasure of staying the night here, and she was so pleased to have such a plush room, it did look amazing. 
Would definitely recommend this to hold an event for those who can afford it! Unfortunately, I will need to save my pennies up first!
",5,2017,03,01
130,Fabulous!!,"If you want cutting edge contemporary decor The Dorchester isn't for you.  If however you want amazing comfort, terrific service and old style opulence then this IS the hotel for you.  
Our bed was amazingly comfortable, the bathroom (with all it's Italian marble) was quite quirky, breakfast was tremendous and as two very ordinary people, we were made to feel like royalty.
Ok it's not cheap, but if you want to treat yourselves don't hesitate, customer service that good in this country and this day and age, is rare - here they have it down to a one art - we LOVED it!!! ",5,2017,03,01
130,Tasteful opulence. Unparalleled service.,"My wife and I were in London visiting friends over the Christmas period and decided to treat ourselves to a couple of nights at The Dorchester. We had heard so much about it and wondered whether it could live up to its reputation. It could.

It is effortlessly brilliant.

Large, classic, stylish rooms. Opulent but tasteful. Wide, grand corridors throughout. It has its own, unique style and we loved it.

The service was the best we've experienced in the UK. Attentive but discreet. At one point I realised I had forgotten something, I called reception to ask if they could recommend where I might purchase a replacement. They said they would get back to me and 15 minutes later there was a knock on the door. I  answered and the item was passed to me in a stylish Dorchester bag. Someone had been to the shop and purchased it for us. The bearer of the gift was down the corridor before I could thank him. All part of the service.

If you want to stay somewhere truly special in London. It has to be The Dorchester.",5,2017,02,27
130,Solid luxury with limitations! ,"Dorchester has a rare combination of history location and glamour and it might be considered one of the most luxurious hotels in London if not in the world .service is courteous but not the most efficient and personalized for a hotel of this caliber several picky requests were just forgotten and restaurant reservations, done by my daughter  were not even confirmed by concierge ! Rooms are beautiful with best amenities you could imagine, but as well a champagne bottle was left watery and no body bothered to change the ice for 4 days , we found toys under the bed!!  The restaurants are amazing specially China tang the promenade is the place to see and to be seen breakfast is one of the best I ever had, high tea is good but not the best . My general impression Dorchester is still very good but personal attention to travelers who are spending less than thousands of pounds per night is not the highest, they only want billionaires I suppose and I would definitely try another option in London next time! ",4,2017,02,26
130,Everything Was Stunning,"Visited with a friend last night having booked the £39 set 3 course menu with a glass of Champagne via BookaTable. The hotel the hotel itself is glamorous and beautiful. The staff are friendly and charming, not at all starchy like some you find at this standard of hotel.

We received our champagne which I was delighted to find was my favourite, Laurent Perrier. No short cuts with cheap champagne here.

We were served a pre-starter, compliments of the chef which was a delicious salmon affair with teeny toasts (pictured).

We then ordered one terrine, one beetroot and goats curd salad, beef short rib for main, one contemporary lemon tart and the chocolate and passion fruit desserts, each were served with their own sorbet. 

The sommelier was fantastic, helping us to select a perfect wine.

Finally we were served another small desert which was a creme anglaise with tendering jam and a crispy sugary top. Similar to a creme brûlée. Again complimentary.

The experience, service and food were divine. I strongly, strongly recommend The Dorchester. It was perfect.",5,2017,02,26
130,Hotel stay,"Just stayed for 1 night. By far one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in, very friendly staff that can't do enough for you. The breakfast was enormous and cooked to perfection! Enjoyed a drink at the piano bar and had a good laugh with the band. Had our dinner at China Tang and it was exceptional. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,25
130,Simply Outstanding,"We frequently visit London for short breaks and we like to stay at different hotels each time.  Service is extremely important to us and at The Dorchester, we get the best possible service from each member of staff.  Good job and thank you guys!",5,2017,02,22
130,Very posh afternoon tea,"I went to the Dorchester with my Auntie and Uncle to have afternoon tea. Lovely cakes, tea, sandwiches and more. Friendly service and lovely decorations. Would go here again and loved receiving a birthday cake as they asked if there was an occasion. I was able to bring home a bag of the leftover cakes to enjoy later!",5,2017,02,22
130,THE DORCHESTER EXPERIENCE,"Every time my husband and I visit London we have morning coffee at The Dorchester.  For my 70th birthday my husband booked us a weekend there.  It was fabulous.  The room and bathroom was amazing and such comfort.  When returning to our room on my birthday after shopping the staff had left me a birthday cake!!  Needless to say we didn't have a pudding after our meal that night.  Dinner was absolutely delicious and breakfast was to die for.   All the staff were so attentive and made a point of knowing our names.   Needless to say this Dorchester experience WILL BE REPEATED.  Do spoil yourselves and stay there, you won't be disappointed.
.",5,2017,02,21
130,Lunch in the Grill,"A lovely experience yesterday...fantastic gin and tonic in the bar followed by a delicious lunch in the Grill and a coffee and cocktail in the Promenade to finish off!
Superb friendly, helpful staff enhance the whole experience!
Will definitely be returning!",5,2017,02,17
130,valentines break,"Hotel was lovely, staff very very attentive.  Doormen were lovely, very knowledgeable and recommended a lovely little shortcut to us to get to the tube station, which led us to find some lovely restaurants.  Air con in the room was freezing at night, but we just turned it off.   Didnt have anything to eat or drink here as it was ridiculously overpriced.  £6.50 for a cup of coffee?  Very luxurious hotel,  pillows in the bedroom were very very soft,  too soft, but i guess everyone likes different things.   Would i stay again?  Not sure,  this trip was a treat as we were given a voucher to use.  Would probably return if i win the lottery :-) ",4,2017,02,15
130,Don't miss tea at the Dorchester,"What an amazing experience. They really treat you like royalty. The tea is delicious and so is the food. You can get refills on whatever you like. Everything was beautiful. The icing on the cake was a pianist playing contemporary music in classical style. A little expensive, but worth every penny.",5,2017,02,15
130,Lunch at the Dorchester Bar,"We had a wonderful lunch in the Bar, the food was absolutely delicious and the service was the very best. What an unbelievable experience, it was divine. My husband and I both agreed the attention to detail by the friendly staff was second to none.
Christine and Dennis.",5,2017,02,15
130,Wonderful 1 night stay,"Stayed here recently for 1 night when at a function in London.  Room was gorgeous, very comfortable and would definitely stay again and recommend.  It is very very expensive and we were a little disappointed with Room Service when we ordered drinks to be delivered to our room which they then got wrong, they took ages and were very snippy on the phone about it when challenged, but it got resolved and there was no need to make a complaint. We would definitely stay again though and it was a wonderful experience.",5,2017,02,14
130,Valentines Dinner,"This is the most enchanting hotel I have ever visited.  First of all the staff are exceptionally friendly attentive and genuinely sincere.  We met the chef who smiled and waved.  Our charming French waiter was delightful.  We had the set dinner in the Grill.  Was gastronomic!  They gave me a gift for my birthday, charged my friends phone.  The lobby was full of red roses that smelt heavenly.  Very reasonably priced.  I will definitely be back!!  ",5,2017,02,12
130,Sunday lunch,"Very good Sunday roast with extra appetisers .... just so delicious!! 
The chocolate dessert with coffee granite was out of this world !! 
Finally the service was second to none ! Really helpful and elegant staff who wanted to make sure our experience was unforgettable! 
Thank you ",5,2017,02,06
130,Has everything ,"This is the fourth time have stayed at this fantastic hotel

Lovely marble bathroom 
Lots of wardrobe space
Tried all bars and all restaurants great choices from 3 star Michelin to Chinese 
Bar men at promenade bar great
Love music in evening 
Doormen always helpful
Great experience 
We will be back!!",5,2017,02,06
130,Great!!,"Lovely room although very dark.  Bathroom rather small & dated but obviously spotlessly clean from top to bottom. 
Breakfast was a very simple affair which surprised me, somewhat because it is The Dorchester after all! I was very impressed with the gluten free pastries that were on offer. Fresh & delicious.",4,2017,02,05
130,Afternoon tea,"Wonderful experience treating a friend to afternoon tea for a special birthday. Marvellous selection of sandwiches although we would have liked a couple of warm savouries too - other hotels offer tiny quiches and sausage rolls. Delicious scones, preserves and pastries. Attentive service in lovely surroundings.",4,2017,02,03
130,Glittering hotel ,"Attended an event here this evening and I can't praise the hotel highly enough. 

Beautiful room that looked stunning, and despite having several hundred there, the food was exquisite. All served together and hot. The cheese soufflé was amazing. 

For anyone looking to book an event here - I thoroughly recommend. The photo doesn't do it justice. ",5,2017,02,02
130,Fabulous ,"Stayed with my wife as she was there for a conference. Obviously be prepared to spend a fortune but it really is a fabulous hotel, from the second I arrived to the second I left I cannot fault anything about my visit. The staff go above and beyond the call of duty, lovely food, lovely rooms!
I'll be back next year.",5,2017,02,01
130,Beautiful afternoon tea and dietary requirements ,"My family and I were greeted by welcoming staff who looked after us. The afternoon tea was perfect especially as one member had a lot of dietary requirements and the Dorchester assisted without any issues. A wonderful suggestion for tea.
We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and would recommend the afternoon tea. ",5,2017,02,01
130,Fantastic Stay,"This is a real WOW hotel from the moment you arrive welcomed by George from concierge introduced to the Front desk escorted to room.
Attended a gala dinner where the quality of food was exceptional accompanied by exceptional service in the stunning setting of the ballroom.
Thank you all at the Dorchester for a truly memorable stay.
",5,2017,01,30
130,Amazing,"A first stay at the Dorchester for my wife and I for a special occasion. It was superb from beginning to end. The standard of the junior suite was fantastic, with a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting on ice. Great meal at Alain Ducasse and a very relaxing afternoon in the cocktail bar. A lovely place with very attentive service.",5,2017,01,27
130,Afternoon Tea / Just Tea / Paracafe,"I've visited 3 times recently:

Afternoon Tea:
Thoroughly enjoyable experience. We are vegetarian and the sandwiches were delicious and frequently replenished. The cakes and patisseries were outstanding and again frequently replenished. The selection of teas were wonderful. The staff were incredible, very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend.

Popped in for tea:

After a significant amount of walking around London and Mayfair we were frantically searching for somewhere to relax with a tea. We didn't have a desperation but thought it was worth asking. We were in luck and were seated by the piano / bar. We had lovely cup of a tea and some biscuits. The staff were again very genuinely friendly and interested in our day. There was no level of snootiness or inferior service just because we were only there for tea.

Paracafe:

Popped in as I was nearby. Note: this isn't within The Dorchester itself, it's about 1 minute walk down the road. It's very small but a lovely little place. Friendly staff and I had a fantastic almond milk flat white.",5,2017,01,26
130,Christmas night at the Dorchester  ,"My wife and I have been visiting the Dorchester  for short stay Just before Christmas for the past 4 years.
We particularly love the floral Christmas decorations along the Promenade , the staff are friendly and very helpful and manage to make you feel welcome 
Our room was first class ,overall a wonderful experience.
Lee and Louise ",5,2017,01,25
130,Best afternoon tea in London,"My friend and I visited The Dorchester today to enjoy their afternoon tea. We enjoy trying different places and have experienced many lovely afternoon teas over the last few years. This was by far the most exceptional we have ever had. From arriving at the hotel every single detail was perfect. The two gentlemen who served us could not have done enough. They were so lovely and attentive and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. The food was delicious and attention to detail was immaculate. We had such a lovely afternoon. Thank you so much, we cannot wait to return.",5,2017,01,22
130,Amazing,"This is my second time staying at the Dorchester and both times have been perfect.
I work in the events industry so very lucky that I get to experience such great hotels. 
We checked in on the 20th January for 1 night. The porters, concierge and receptionist couldn't be more lovely and welcoming which is always nice when first arriving to a hotel. The receptionist showed us to our room and it was beautiful (The bedroom with the four poster bed was from the first time we stayed and the second picture from our most recent stay) We had dinner the the Park Suite (one of the event spaces) and again dinner was faultless. We had entertainment in between courses from The London Essentials who were absolutely incredible!!!! The Dorchester really went above and beyond to make sure we had a lovely stay. I would highly recommended this hotel and I will definitely be returning :) ",5,2017,01,22
130,There are better in this price range....,"Special visit before going on holiday to Mauritius.
Great things? 
They gave us our room on early arrival.. the room is lovely however they do need to replace hairdryers. Shower temperature two extremes lava or ice! £7 for a Diet Coke is unnecessary... it's a mass market product. 
Could be better areas...
The bar is ok - cocktails v good. 
Poor areas...
Breakfast the most disappointing part of the stay. Cold, bland, bread basket forgotten and what seemed to be very very stressed staff. 
Would we stay again? No. 
There are better in this price bracket in London where service comes easier. 
At checkout our comment of it was ok was met with ""oh excellent""... 
We were not made to feel special. It was a transactional stay for the Dorchester I am sure - for us we had hoped to fall in love with it - we did not. ",2,2017,01,22
130,Drinks,"A deliberate visit to the Dorchester bar for drinks. After a late and long lunch, we went to the bar to get the best (in my opinion) expresso martinis in London. It is always great to see the amazing service that the hotel delivers. ",5,2017,01,22
130,Business lunch in the bar,"Faultless. 

Cannot recommend highly enough. Completely out of my price range but I'm going to return for an overnight stay.

Best chicken club sandwich and made to feel so welcome. 

Do not hesitate to book here the service is impeccable. ",5,2017,01,18
130,"A consistently good, well run, large luxury hotel","I have stayed here multiple times, all for business. The hotel is consistently good: excellent service, very good technology (wifi/tv/lighting), nicely appointed and large rooms and good room service. Not a ton of charm but really good always. Location is good in Mayfair and restaurants are nice but pricey. I have been upgraded many times, as well. Highly recommended ",5,2017,01,18
130,special experiance,"i went for a few drinks and the customer service in the bar on the ground floor was outstanding. nice ambiance, great attention to detail and very comfortable chars to sit on, not the normal budget but an amazing experience ",5,2017,01,18
130,Sister's 60th birthday celebration,"We booked a trip to London to celebrate our sister's 60th birthday, and as a special treat had afternoon tea at the Dorchester.  This turned out to be the highlight of the visit.  The service was brilliant, the staff could not have been more friendly, they went out of their way to make my sister feel special.   Must also mention the pianist ""Adam"", who found the time to chat to us and who played a selection of our requested tunes, he could not have been more obliging.  The actual ""tea"" itself was excellent.  We were only sorry that the time went by so quickly.",5,2017,01,13
130,Like stepping back in time (For good reasons),"Unfortunately high end hotels in London are hit and miss whereby they're either ultra modern or disturbingly old fashioned, The Dorchester gets the balance just right.

From reception, through to the public areas and the rooms there is an element of class that one would expect from Parklane. The architecture of the building is a little misleading as it's almost something you'd expect to find from your Benidorm style resorts, but that comparison stops there.

The Reception team were friendly and curteous, possibly a little too rehearsed but very pleasant never the less. 

After checkin in we went to our room and was pleasantly surprised by the size for a 'central london' hotel. The decor was classy and seating and the beds very comfortable.

We ate in the restaurant that evening and this is probably where my own niggle occurred. It took quite a long time to be visited at our table for our food and drinks order. When our drinks arrived we both received Prosecco and not the 2006 Dom Perignon as order, quite the difference. 

We also asked for some water which the waiter somehow managed to spill on to my partner, not an issue accidents happened and they were very apologetic. 

Our food arrived, we ate from Alain Ducasse which was exceptional. 

We both started with the mushrooms and I had the duck for main and my partner the Venison. Again this took a long time to arrive, not because of the kitchen but there seemed like there was some disorganisation going on amongst the front of house team, couldn't quite work out what.

It was a bit of a clouded affair really because we were celebrating moving back to the UK and London particularly and we just felt it was a bit chaotic and rushed, even though the food was literally exceptional.

When I asked the waiter if everything was already this evening he barked at me, yes why wouldn't it be, haven't you been here before?! Nice haha.

That said the stay was wonderful and comfortable but I;m not sure i'd return to eat here again based on this experience. Quite often we'll go to other fine dining establishents where the service is a little more refined.",4,2017,01,12
130,"Gorgeous hotel, let down by breakfast.","We stayed on December 31st for NYE. 

Check in at the hotel was seamless. The lady that checked me was very helpful and went over and above what was required in assisting me. I was especially impressed by this as I could see that the hotel was very busy.

We had a standard room and I was surprised at how large it was. Everything was beautifully decorated, clean and exceptional quality. We had lots of pillows, towels, hangers, toiletries, dressing gowns, slippers etc. 

The bathroom was huge and all white marble. Hot water came out instantly and great water pressure. 

The room had all the latest ""gadgets"" electronic curtains, lights, music, Bang Olson TV and telephone...

We ordered room service which arrived quickly and the food was hot!!

Absolutely nothing to fault until we had breakfast the next day.... There were a number of people waiting for a table because one of the restaurants that serves breakfast on Sundays is closed early for the ""brunch menu"". 
We had breakfast included with the room and did not want brunch. This was obviously the case with a number of guests. The restaurant serving brunch was virtually empty while a group of us sat in the lobby and waited for a table. 

Service at breakfast while polite was chaotic to say the least. We never got what was ordered as the waiter just did not understand the menu!! We ordered a healthy breakfast. It came with fruit, yoghurt, bread basket and omelette. We only received the omelette!! After asking for the accompanying items twice we gave up!! Croissants were not very nice and toasty was cold.

Check out again was very easy and professional. No problems at all. 

Overall I would recommend The Dorchester because the staff were so nice and rooms beautiful. Location is also spot on.",4,2017,01,10
130,"""It's so nice""","""It's so nice"" is all I kept saying during our stay at the Dorchester. From the moment the doormen open your car door, you feel special. Phillip checked us in and showed us to our room. Even carrying my bag during a short tour of the hotel. We saw him in the bar later and he came over to chat. I had a champagne shimmer cocktail, comes with it's own Dorchester light up lip gloss! Just don't wear a hat in the bar, as my husband was told to take it off. The room was lovely with the comfiest bed ever. I also had a treatment at the spa which again ""was so nice"" from the relaxation room to the heated bed that you lay on for treatment, it was lovely. I had the 25 minute de-stress treatment with Ivy. Gorgeous! The only issue we experienced was that the lifts weren't going down to the lower ground floor for some reason. I had already changed into my robe and slippers in our room (as advised by Phillip) ready for the spa. Luckily my husband offered to escort me to the spa reception and lucky he did as he had to go and get help as to why the lift wasn't working. I hid in a corner of the main reception area in my robe in front of lots of people! Ha! Slightly embarrassing, but we were soon shown down to the stairs. Breakfast was part of the room rate and again was so nice. Silver service, and the biggest pile of pastries. We couldn't have managed it all. I ordered scrambled eggs which were done to perfection, just so much food! The room for breakfast is stunning, also where afternoon tea is served. 
All in all I left this hotel brimming with happiness, the staff can't do enough for you and as the lady on the spa reception said, they are like one big family. It really was just so nice. ",5,2017,01,08
130,Birthday Treat ,"Treated myself to a birthday overnight stay. It was amazing.
The bedroom was lovely & staff are friendly....I was definitely spoilt 
Just want to say 'Thank You' to Nina on reception. A lovely birthday to remember.
",5,2017,01,08
130,Christmas Pressie Dad,"We took a trip into London for family evening out. Set menu plus a glass of champagne. But the atmosphere on a wet early evening was delightful due to the staff and the location. A drink in 'The Bar' not cheap but balanced by exceptional service, fuss and attention from all the team. They were so considerate for our older guests with kind and compassionate regard.
The food in The Grill was just excellent even with a limited choice, delicious fish beautiful beef followed  a veloutè, beetroot curd or gravlax. But the stars were homemade ice creams or the passion fruit & chocolate delight (which it was)!
A must for the strong tradition of good food and top service.
",5,2017,01,07
130,Amazing at Christmas!,"Stayed at the Dorchester for a week over christmas / new year's. Highlights include impeccable service, luxurious room, well equiped gym, and beautiful christmas decorations including a bagpiper in front for new year's. Most of the best London restaurants are within a five minute taxi ride and Hyde park is across the street. Only negative was the view from the room looking at another building undergoing some construction. Parents be careful with your children as there is a sweet shop in the lobby that provides free sweets for the entire stay. Overall an excellent visit and would highly recommend!",5,2017,01,07
130,A nice place to eat,"We took advantage of one of their winter offers,three courses and a glass of Champagne for £49 a head.Great food,good service and atmosphere. A bottle of wine on top however isn't cheap! By the time we'd had a bottle of wine,plus the 
''Optional "" 12.5% service charge,it came to nearer £80 a head,which I suppose is still reasonable for a top London restaurant.
 Overall...recommended!",5,2017,01,06
130,Great hotel needs to up its game to compete today,"Just a short stay mainly focussed around the Alain Ducasse restaurant with friends 

The rooms are quite nice not dissimilar to Claridges, I think there is room for improvement in in room facilities escpaially at this price point (when the rates go up around other city activities) 

I do think it would be incredibly costly to modernise the hotel so a tasteful refurb would be great as some hall carpets are very tired.",4,2017,01,04
130,Outstanding Service ,"What can one say about this iconic hotel?
The service is beyond brilliant, the staff are polite professional and amazing 
Our room was comfortable and the bathroom lovely. Staying here has spoilt me for any other hotel
We are and drank in The Grill, The Bar and the Promenade. Food was excellent and the craft cocktails fun and good. One of mine came with lip gloss!",5,2017,01,03
130,Winter Wonderland stop over,"I last stayed at the Dorchester over 20 years ago and had a beautiful experience...nothing's changed😍
The room, the (oh soooo comfortable) bed, the service, the food, the ambience and most of all...the Christmas decoy!!! 
All in all...a wonderful stay and I shall not be leaving it a further 20 years to return. 
Thank you for awakening my memories!",5,2017,01,02
130,Magical,"Amazing hotel and a favorite place for us... this time we experienced the real Christmas spirit with the quaint sweet shop in the entrance as well as the gorgeous Christmas tree and giant gingerbread house. We received a gift of a delicious traditional Christmas pudding in an elegant white gift box too ! The staff from front office to cleaning staff are always pleasant , friendly and most helpful and the beds cannot be described aptly ! Across the road was the fun Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park.... I can't wait to go back !",5,2016,12,26
130,Elegant,"Visited last year, enjoyed so we went back for my 70th birthday on a deal with Book A Table. As last time right from the greeting, taking of our overcoats which were whisked away and a token for collection delivered to our table.
We appreciated the time given to peruse the wine list and the menu, there was no rush to choose even though it was getting busier by the minute. The wine struts at £50 a bottle but the Mclaren Vale we chose from Australia can only be described as chewable. All three courses were excellent along with bread when wanted, the cheesy bread was the best. 
The decor and atmosphere is great and the staff excellent.",5,2016,12,24
130,Sensational Christmas afternoon tea with carols.,"This was second time round for us having afternoon tea at The Dorchester, and it is still the absolute pinnacle of experiences for us in every respect.  Nothing else so far rivals it, and we have sampled many high-end afternoon teas, such as at The Ritz, Brown's, Claridge's and The Savoy.  The food, ambience and service here is peerless, and the live background choir singing carols on this occasion was the icing on the cake. 
Truly OUTSTANDING.",5,2016,12,24
130,Luxury without unnecessary pomp and show,"I have been staying at the Dorchester on my last few business trips to London, and must say it is a standout hotel for business travelers. Undoubtedly the price is a bit on the higher side even compared to other premium hotels, but the Dorchester has an air about it and a standard of service that justifies that positioning. Everything is immaculate and it is expected to be so by not only guests but also the team working there who put their effort in to ensure so. ",5,2016,12,24
130,Another great stay,Stayed at the Dorchester again with group of friends- service was excellent as always. Only down side was breakfast room was full even though a lot of empty tables had reserved signs on and no o e sitting at them. We were put in the bar and had a self service small buffet which wasn't what I expected from the `Dorchester! Service at breakfast was slow.,5,2016,12,21
130,Delightful,"We stayed for one night, in a beautifully appointed room. We also dined at the Chefs table in the hotels main kitchen. The food was absolutely outstanding and the head chef was great, very friendly and eager to help.",4,2016,12,20
130,Flawless ,"We always stay here as a family and it's truly amazing. Great service and always remember us and make us feel welcome. Very clean and HK do a wonderful job. The food and room service is excellent and very children friendly. We will always return to this hotel, it's londons best hotel for kids and the best location to walk everywhere! ",5,2016,12,19
130,Never disappoints ,We booked afternoon tea to celebrate an anniversary. Beautifully decorated for Christmas. We had a lovely young waiter who looked after us. As usual food wonderful and cakes Christmas themed. Also serenaded by choir boys singing carols. I cannot fault this experience and would recommend to anyone who wants to make a celebration extra special. Well done to the Dorchester :),5,2016,12,18
130,Great Sunday brunch!,I ate at The Grill at the Dorchester and had their Sunday roast. Everything was delicious! They offered a nice variety of perfectly cooked vegetables with their roast. Champagne was a nice touch and not something I would have thought to have with a roast. The room is a stunning golden color and is so nice to sit in on a cold day.,5,2016,12,17
130,BazzaRoy.,"I booked afternoon tea as a treat for my partner on her birthday. When we arrived we shown to our table, and given two menus, a tea menu, and a champagne menu. The waiter recommended the Dorchester tea, which was delicious, a very good choice. Next we were served a selection of sandwiches, and the champagne. After that we were served scones, some with dried fruit, and some with jam, all are served with clotted cream. After that came the patisserie, which is one of the reasons I have awarded only three stars. We both thought that the patisserie choices were not as good as we expected, given that we were dining in one of London's premier restaurants. The other reason I awarded three stars was because we had difficulty understanding the waiter, his English wasn't good enough. This establishment isn't cheap which is why my rating is quite harsh. I think that at their prices everything should be just right. Also we've had tea in other establishments, and the tea is constantly topped up. During our visit to this restaurant the tea wasn't topped up which meant that towards the end we were drinking lukewarm tea. In conclusion our afternoon tea experience wasn't bad, but considering Dorchester prices there are better places.",3,2016,12,16
130,"Poor breakfast,room with a poor view","Breakfast very poor,served in the bar!
Serve yourself with a very poor buffet
Dirty tables,
Lack of plates.
No tongues to use on pastries.
Check in poor, room not ready until 15:30, wait in reception,
Check out poor, took 15 mins
View from room of building site,great for a 5 star hotel, no forward notification of building site view.",2,2016,12,12
130,Love...,"Perfect location, great service and luxurious room. Only downside the there is no tea making facilities provided in the room. 
Walkable to Hyde park and all shopping areas. So many great restaurants within walking distance. Will definitely be back again soon!",5,2016,12,11
130,As good as ever,"Just stayed for a long weekend, although the hotel was very busy the service was as good as ever, the rooms since being renovated are to as higher a standard as in and city hotel I've visited and the restaurants first class, The Grill restaurant especially good. My favourite London hotel. ",5,2016,12,09
130,a wonderful Christmassy time!  Dinner,"We arrived at 5pm for a special offer dinner, £39 for a three course dinner with a glass of champagne.
The staff were efficient and helpful.
On our arrival we heard a choir singing so popped along and saw the choir boys standing round the piano singing carols it was a charming start to Christmas for us!
Then we walked back to the reception and looked at the sweet shop all decorated in Christmas goodies and a toy soldier standing guard outside! Then we viewed the remarkable gingerbread model of the dorchester, from behind there was all the rooms an exact copy of the hotel even with a model of the model! Absolutely wonderful! Our meal was good, my daughter had a vegetarian option of a vegetable stew which was rather bland, so I hope there will be more attention given to vegetarians in future. We had a lovely time.",5,2016,12,09
130,Fabulous!,"Having stayed at Coworth Park before, our expectations were exceptionally high. We were not disappointed in any way.
From the warm reception at check in, as we marvelled at the stunning Christmas decorations, to the fabulously friendly service at the Champagne Bar our brief stay was outstanding. 
We had an executive room on the second floor, where the bed was enormous and sooooooo comfortable, which was equipped with everything you could imagine - and if you conjured something else up that you needed, it was only a phone call away.
The Spa team were as welcoming and friendly - we only used the steam rooms and relaxation area but both were excellent.
Breakfast the following morning in the Promenade was wonderful. Excellent service, again, surrounded by Christmas trees and wonderful decor. The food was superb and there was plenty of choice.
Coworth Park is one of the all-round finest hotels I have ever had the pleasure to stay in; their London flagship location, while not benefitting from the wonderful Coworth Park location, was as enjoyable a stay - if only brief. Having stayed in many hotels in London, I would recommend The Dorchester to anyone in search of somewhere special.",5,2016,12,08
130,5 Star,"We recently stayed at the dorchester  it was a Christmas gift from  2015 , luxury hotel very attentive  staff,  beautiful decor,  and lovely room. If you stay you must try the breakfast in your room and have room service amazing. Couple of minor niggles bath is very deep you have to climb in and out , the wc behind the bathroom door with doorstop in front of toilet  pan. Would definitely  stay again has a treat.",5,2016,12,05
130,stunning place and lovely staff.,"The inside of Dorchester is beautiful and lovely atmosphere, had lunch at Alain Ducasse restaurant which was super delicious enjoyed every bit of my chicken sandwich and chips, had an amazing surprise from Adam a member of staff at Dorchester playing Happy Birthday on the piano as it was my sil's birthday and the atmosphere was lovely. ",5,2016,12,04
130,Breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring with wonderful staff,"We had the pleasure of attending The Dorchester hotel for a charity ball this week and were reminded of the wonderful, atmospheric ambience of the place. This is particularly so now that it has festive Christmas decorations. The area for tea has wonderful aromatic smells of cinammon and cost lighting and decor.
Pop in for lunch, tea or dinner with soemone special. You will not be dissapointed. The staff are fantastic.",5,2016,12,03
130,"Great service, beautiful interiors. ","The Dorchester is a luxury hotel with a history. It has beautifully decorated interiors and the service is very attentive and friendly. The rooms are well equipped and the bedding comfortable. One can only regret, like in many hotels in London, that the windows isolation (noise, heat and wind) is really lousy, which means that the room was much colder in the morning because of bad windows (one could also hear some noise from outside, which was not that disturbing though). The hotel is well located, being a gate between MayFair and the sourrounding parks. Shopping at New Bond Street is within walking distance, and so are Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Hyde Park and Belgravia. ",5,2016,12,01
130,Truly A 5% Star Experience,"The Hotel embodies the best aspects of a 5 star establishment,with long traditions and flawless service Being greeted by name having your preferences noted for this and future stays and an immediate reponse to any problems that might arise.This is traditional not trendy or boutique establishment.
Politeness curtersey and charm are by words here as well as the  impeccable apperance and attention of staff at all levels.
The room I was given though traditional as ithas every mod con and tech access you night require .The bed was too comfortable there is ample storage for ones clothes and a spacious bathroom with a hot towel rail which is a personal plus.
Breakfast was served in The Grill semi buffett or a'la carte in the Prominade , I requested an item from one menu whilst in the other room and was served without even a moments hesitation such a pleasure 
Situated on Park Lane is midway between KnightsBridge ,Bond Street / Oxford Streetand Piccadilly/Regent Street a haven for shoppers as well as being well located for museums Monuments The Parks and a brisk walk to Buckingham Palace.",5,2016,11,30

130,Tina Turner,"Simply the best, better than all the rest. This is just the best hotel I have stayed in without doubt in London and top 3 of my limited world experiences, as it manages to combine quality and sophistication with a totally relaxing atmosphere that never even hints at being pompous. The staff are warm and friendly and give you just enough attention without appearing to feign all over you and the main bar area is just the perfect place to relax, have a drink and watch the world go by. A little expensive I agree.......but worth every penny!!",5,2016,11,26
130,Enchanting Jolly Old London,"The location and service at the Dorchester can only be described as superb.  Do you like pubs?  Good, many pubs are located just around the corner.  Do you like strolling in the park?  Perfect, just walk across the street. Up for the theater?  No problem, see the theater coordinator in the lobby. The concierge staff will strive to help you in any way and in a pleasant manner. Bountiful breakfast and wonderful bar rounds out your experience.",5,2016,11,25
130,Spa day - booked via treatwell ,"My husband pre- booked and payed for myself, mum & mother in law as a surprise for a 'me time spa day' via treatwell 

When calling the hotel they booked our treatments (the package included lunch and a facial and use of the facilities) and took a credit card to secure the treatments which I thought was a little odd but didn't question. 
Today we have been to the spa and couldn't fault the whole experience - from checking in, to our bento box lunch, to an amazing rose facial with Tatianna and the relaxing facilities this wonderful hotel has to offer. 
When we were leaving the staff on reception asked how our spa day was and we were all very complimentary until one of the ladies ran after me and asked if I had payed. Walking back into the spa reception I said yes of course  everything had been pre booked and paid by my husband. She then continually said nothing had been paid, so out of horror I found my phone and the confirmation email that my husband has forwarded on and showed it. It clearly said it was booked via treatwell and paid upfront. It was all getting very embarrassing, there were other people in the reception and I went from being very relaxed to very irritated (the whole point of the spa day was to unwind!). After five minutes of back and forward and the lady still staying that the card was not charged and that I needed to pay (£450!!!) another lady on reception came over and took over. She asked my name again and then looked on the system and apologised and said that they have only started using treatwell bookings and not sure how to check the confirmation. 
The other lady (I didn't get her name but she was English, short with a hair parted in the middle) didn't apologise and just said ok all done??!!
What a shame - I left feeling embarrassed and have an extremely annoyed husband too when I told him what had happened - a disappointing ending to what was a lovely afternoon. 

Do not book via treatwell unless you want to be accused of walking out and not paying with no apologies!!!! I suggest you get your staff trained on these systems - or at least some customer service skills. I've only rated this poor due to this, otherwise I would have given excellent five stars. ",2,2016,11,21
130,Now you're taking,What a fantastic hotel. From the moment arriving until we left the staff were great and the environment and facilities were memorable. On arrival a free upgrade and complimentary champagne and breakfast for us. Each and every member the staff were a mix of politeness and charm - particularly the Doormen and Reception staff. Will be returning soon. Thanks for a great stay.,5,2016,11,20
130,40th birthday treat,"Went for Christmas afternoon tea treat with carol singers and champagne.

From the outside this hotel wasn't that impressive but once you step inside its a traditional English hotel with a lovely atmosphere, we never felt out of place. 

Staff really friendly, acknowledged my birthday brought out a cake with a candle which was a great touch to end the afternoon. 

There were so many cakes on offer we couldn't eat them all therefore they put them in a box for us to take home with us. 

Another little thing they did was drop a closed dried up flower into a flask of hot water which opened into a lovely flower and tasted really refreshing.

The whole afternoon was quite emotional, well worth the money and experience for a special occasion.

This hotel is right opposite Hyde park so great for combining winter wonderland as well.",5,2016,11,20
130,Always the Dorchester ," I gladly missed my flight home late one night .. and called up the Dorchester to see if the could accommodate a family for 4 for a night while we sorted out our travel plans during a high season.. not only were we in luck it was the. Est experience of our trip! Ended up staying 5 nights but it was worth it!

The services is still as I always remembered diplomatic and courteous.

The afternoon tea is impeccable second only to the Mandarin hotel.. 

Looking for a taste of refined luxury .. this is the place to be

130,such an amazing stay!,"decided to go for dorchester after we had an amazing afternoon tea experience last time was in london!

we got upgrade at check in which was very nice :)
the halls is amazing, they hold breakfast and afternoon tea there, such a beautiful decor. fresh flower decorations, amazing smell and great service.

the corridors are beautiful, old style, although the a/c on the sides was too cold at times :)

rooms are spacious, walk in wardrobe, huge bathroom, lovely bed :)

room service was done twice a day, with free water bottles and some apples, very nice :)",5,2016,11,17
130,Family treat,"went here with niece and nephew, and the staff made it feel like heaven. tea came almost instantly were able to adjust food because of allergies and not add any extra price. honestly believe one of the best places for afternoon tea in th world",5,2016,11,15
130,Very Luxurious Hotel right in the heart of London,"My husband went to London for business and i and our then 11 month old son accompanied him. We stayed a total of 3 weeks at the Dorchester. 

First impression of the Dorchester is already superb. The valet and concierge staff are very alert and helpful. The service is impressive. And most of all i love the way the hotel is very baby/child-friendly. During booking we had requested for a cot, a microwave, a highchair, a baby bath tub to be provided and upon check-in not only were these items available, plus more. They have baby toiletries as well. Traveled extensively with our son and had never encountered such baby friendly hotel service with all their amenities.

Didnt get a chance to try their restaurants but loved the room service menu. Especially the Kabsa and Chicken Curry.

Location wise, I especially loved the location of the Dorchester in Park Lane. It is walking distance to all the tourist spots, the parks and the shopping centres. Hyde Park, St. James' Park, Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street and many more are all within walking distance. I enjoyed walking out everyday with my 11 month old son taking his pram with me and just loved the places we can go that are so near.

Would definitely be back to stay in this hotel again.",5,2016,11,15
130,Free upgrade,My wife and I booked a 2 night stay in a suite costing £1480 including breakfast. When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded free of charge as it was my 50th birthday. We were taken to our suite and wow we had been given the Dorchester suite which costs £6500 for 2 nights. The staff made my wife and I feel very special and were on call to meet any requests with what I call discreet hospitality because you are never hassled and never see the staff nipping into you're room to clean and make sure the rooms are always perfect. I realise not everyone can afford to pay these costs for hotels however the standards at this great hotel are the best 5 star I have experienced anywhere in the world. The food in the restaurants is top quality. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to feel like a VIP even if you are not. Thank you to all at the Dorchester and look forward to staying again in March 2017.,5,2016,11,15
130,Perfect as always ,"We took three rooms for three nights and you could not find a better hotel in London. Have been a regular guest over the years and the service has gotten better, more attentive and personal over the years. You cannot fault the service quality or delivery, it's impeccable. The restaurants are superb. The concierge is helpful and can organize your plans perfectly. Each detail is taken care of. Room service is exceptional in terms of order taking and execution. Housekeeping staff is efficient and professional. You could not ask for a better experience in London.  Breakfast at the promenade is an experience in itself. The setting is spectacular. ",5,2016,11,13
130,Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester,Recently visited The Dorchester for a wonderful Afternoon Tea.  The food and drink was wonderful and the service was amazing.  Added champagne for a special touch.  Would definitely return here and recommend this lovely hotel.,5,2016,11,13
130,service,"I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world including many in London; The Ritz, 45 Park Lane; Mandarine Oriental; Connaught; Lansborough and more.  The service in the Dorchester was some of the best I have experienced at every turn, from the door man to the duty manager there were was nothing that was too much trouble and one felt they genuinely wanted to help.  Thank you Dorchester",5,2016,11,12
130,The Dorchester - In a league of its own…,"When visiting London there is only one hotel to stay in and that is the Dorchester!

Having just returned from a wonderful two night stay and I cannot praise this hotel highly enough.

A small problem was experienced on room arrival but Andrew Booth; Front of House Manager immediately resolved the issue and completely exceeded our expectations. 

All members of staff were extremely friendly, from the wonderful greeting we received from concierge and the reception teams, to the excellent service delivered by Anuar at breakfast and a special mention to Ciaran Burns, who personally thanked us for visiting upon our departure. 

Everything is immaculate, the beautiful flowers in the lobby to the exceptional and hardworking housekeeping. 

We had dinner in the Grill on both evenings and the menu was outstanding. It was lovely to then relax in the promenade and enjoy the wonderful live music.   

A fabulous stay in an exquisite and refined hotel, I cannot wait to return in December to celebrate the New Year!

Thank you for making our stay special.  
Helen & Anne Rushworth",5,2016,11,10
130,Wonderful!,From the moment we arrived our wonderful Dorchester Experience started. Check in was excellent. Our suite was beautiful! Everything was very homely and cosy. Breakfast was delicious with a large array of choices and the service was first class. Second stay here and we will certainly return again soon! Thank you for a wonderful stay. ,5,2016,11,09
130,High Tea,"To celebrate my birthday this year I decided that I would like to have a High Tea in London and a High Tea in New York.  The Dorchester was my London choice.  The surroundings were sumptuous and elegant and the service faultless.  The actual afternoon tea, though, was a tad disappointing.  Finger sandwiches - fairly ordinary - were the only savrouries, but the scones with jam and cream were delicious. The variety of small cakes and tarts were what disappointed me the most.  They were so obviously 'commercial', heavy on chocolate and lacking any real delicacy or skill in preparation.  I guess you have to be satisfied with the surroundings ..... the High Tea in my home town of Melbourne, Australia, is much better in terms of quality, and the High Tea that was the other half of my birthday celebration - at the Plaza in New York - was excellent.",3,2016,11,08
130,Afternoon tea at the Promenade,"We had afternoon tea with Champagne at the Promenade on a recent Saturday afternoon, what a pleasure! Anuar looked after us and really made the whole experience very special. He had just the right balance of being attentive whilst giving us space and time to enjoy the delicious food and exquisite tea. We throughly enjoyed the pianist, who played everything from Adele to Mozart. The surroundings were pure luxury from the soft furnishings to the floral displays - a fabulous way to spend a Saturday afternoon.",5,2016,11,05
130,"""Faultless""","We return to the Dorchester every year to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
The service and attention to detail is 100% just fabulous in every way possible, so much so that once you have experienced  this hotel you will want to return time and time again.
Our Suite was incredible,  pure luxury, just what you would expect from a hotel of this standard. We had a view of Hyde Park from the suite which was gorgeous in fact our whole suite was stunning with a large entrance hall, huge bedroom,  four poster bed and a sumptuous lounge with marble fireplace and a beautiful  dinning area where we took breakfast. 
The bathroom was huge with a separate bath and shower, luxurious soft towels and generously sized luxury toiletries  We were 'wowed' by the arrangement of fresh flowers and the lovely anniversary cake waiting for us on our arrival .... 
All just faultless!!!
Servicing the suites there is a butler service available (ironing, unpacking and packing etc) l was slightly concerned that this would be overwhelming as it is in some hotels but there is no intrusion at all, just there if needed taking care of you, our suite was tidied and turned down for the evening beautifully.
Breakfast was served to us in our suite, one word, amazing!!! 
The team at the hotel all give a high standard of service and  professionalism,  they are all so happy and friendly. Everybody is without a doubt committed to giving guests the  best possible 
""Dorchester Experience"" they can give. 
We have been fortunate to have stayed at a lot of London's top hotels but our preference will always be the Dorchester.
Well done see you all next year!

130,Best Afternoon Tea on Park lane,"What a wonderful experience, as soon as you enter th Eloy he you know you are in for a top quality experience, met by friendly and helpful staff your experience begins. The food is impeccable, dainty and delicious as you would expect and there is plenty of it. The choices of teas excellent and I have to say the coffee is excellent.

130,Another level . ,"Dorchester is known for its service. 
But evertime they top it. The way everyone knows your name from housekeeping to waiters. 
Attention to your way of doing things is amazing. Example. Im left handed. So they put my coffee on left side and note That im lefty i never said anything.
Consierge are amaizing will get you anything. I went to consierge to ask where can i buy shoelaces. And he opened up the drawer. And ask me ""which color sir""
And had perpect one for me right there. That was pretty cool 😊had to share it. 😊",5,2016,10,19
130,Sumptious surroundings,We enjoyed a cocktail in the main lounge before our meal. We booked through 'book a table' which included 3 courses and a glass of champagne. A choice of three for each course on the menu. We enjoyed the Beef Main course and we we served with little extras between courses by very pleasant staff. Unfortunately we were sat in front of the double doors which opened frequently with a draft form the main lounge but overall an enjoyable time was had.,5,2016,10,18
130,"a week-end overlooking Hyde Park at The Dorchester, London","It is a known fact that some hotels are intimately linked to the cities where they are located, becoming must-see landmarks over time. Landmarks where you can feel and catch the full spirit of the city, in one single place.
Like the other properties of The Dorchester Collection (The Plaza Athénée in Paris or the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles), The Dorchester in London is one of those.

The ultimate Afternoon Tea destination for visitors, guests and many Londoners alike, their award-winning Afternoon Tea has been served with perfection since the first day The Dorchester opened in 1931…

As I wrote in this article, I try to enjoy this quintessentially British habit at The Dorchester everytime I visit the city.

On my last visit to London, I had the chance to take the experience much further, and experience one of those unique, treasured « London moments » only The Dorchester could offer in such an exquisite fashion.
What made my stay so special ? Staying in one of the hotel’s Park Suites, characterised by their splendid wood-panelled sitting rooms full of oh so British details and furniture, and distinct dining area providing an atmosphere of quality and tradition.

As usual with The Dorchester Collection hotels, the bedroom had to be one of my favourite parts, with the fairytale bed I slept and woke up in… On my birthday !

To make my special day even more unforgettable, the ensuite marble bathroom with its spectacular bathtub was the cherry on the cake – not to mention the spacious guest bathroom I had for convenience.",5,2016,10,16
130,Best hotel in London,My stay in Dorchester was just amazing. The staff really make you feel like a vip guest. The rooms are decorated in a British style and are very big. The hotel is very well located and 2 minute walking distance to Hyde Park .,5,2016,10,16
130,Afternoon tea,"My best friend just told me to ""Dress smartly"" and ""make sure your hungry"". This was the sum total of information she gave me for my 50th birthday treat. As we came out of the tube station and walked towards the park my imagination was running rife. When we stopped outside the Dorchester shock was so apparent. 
I don't see myself as the usual type to frequent such a high end hotel. Because of this i expect a certain level of derogatory looks and attitudes from the staff. Nothing could have been further from the truth. From the very cheerful doormen, the ladies on the reception, the manager of the restaurant to the very well dressed waiters and waitresses, my friend and i felt the warmest of welcomes. 
Its not very often i am lost for words but at one point i was overcome with the ambiance of the room. The pianist played all service so beautifully. The food? well it was to die for. From the soft flavorsome sandwiches to the sweet cakes and scrumptious scones. I would highly recommend the Dorchester tea from the tea menu. I wish i could have left with a pack. As an avid coffee drinker it was the tastiest tea I've ever sampled. 
Thank you Dorchester for making my 50th Birthday a truly memorable and special one.",5,2016,10,15
130,High Tea,"High Tea at the Dorchester Hotel and the experience was everything you would want in a high tea. The setting is beautiful and the staff very attentive.  It is not just  a matter of scones and sandwiches put on the table in front of you.  There is a tea menu for you to select your tea, and a palate cleansing tea infused at the table.  Sandwiches, scones and scrumptious cakes are presented with panache. It is costly! but if you are after a special London experience, this is for you.",4,2016,10,14
130,English luxury,"We visited the Dorchester as a special 40th birthday treat and the hotel/staff did everything possible to ensure we had a fantastic stay.
From Philip on check in to Freddie who escorted us to our room and let's not forget Joshua at guest relations who organised a happy birthday cake no request was too small.
Luxury and top service to match.
Thank you.",5,2016,10,13
130,Another wonderful stay,"So relaxing. Not cheap, in fact damn expensive, but worth every penny. This is an oasis of calm existing in the timeless tranquility of understated old world charm. This is THE hotel in London in my view. No scene, no noise, no drama. Functions like clockwork, excellent food, friendly attentive staff, and the most comfortable hotel bed that the world has to offer. And the baths with their luxurious expansive volume that envelops the tired traveler, allowing them to lounge and let the outside world disappear away. A perfect place to get away from it all, especially when, as was the case with me, you have been traveling for some time and just need to slow down the pace and unwind.",5,2016,10,11
130,Simply the best,"I have stayed at this hotel since I was a child every time we went to London with my parents. Since then I come back almost every visit to London. It is in my point of view simply the best of the best in London. It is situated very close to Buckingham Palace (walking Distance). The suites are some of the finest I've stayed in (I've stayed in the best hotels of most Major cities).
The restaurant is Magnificent, service is outstanding and the concierge can get you tickets to just about any play and reservations to almost all restaurants. 
The afternoon tea is one of the highlights of your day after walking around the cities endless museums and attractions. 
In my point of view it is an obligated stay if you love Luxury Hotels as much as I do.",5,2016,10,11
130,Afternoon Tea in delightful surroundings,"Afternoon tea at The Dorchester is a truly memorable experience.   Dainty sandwiches, delicious scones followed by scrumptious mouthwatering cakes.  Helpful staff to guide you through your choice of teas and anything else you may require.  The booking was made for a special birthday and anniversary occasion and we were not disappointed.   Thank you to all at The Promenade for a wonderful afternoon.

I would also like to thank the young man in the cloakroom who chased after me to return a scarf I had dropped without me knowing I had dropped it.

A really lovely afternoon treat.",5,2016,10,09
130,A place to relax,"The welcome was lovely as was our room.after leaving our stuff in our room,we went to be entertained and we were. We had a beautifull meal and drinks.I had beef and boy it was  succulent.\My partner had the fish and it was to die for",4,2016,10,09
130,Business,"First class room
Go for the Queen Junior Suite Executive, anything else is more pretentious and less value!
Great surroundings 
Truly one of the great hotels in Europe
Old style everything !
Restaurants are amazing! See my review of the Dorchester Grill.
One thing pissed me off....
1. I'm a guest in the hotel
2. At some point a guest wants to eat in the  hotel
3. Had a pair of jeans and t shirt on.
4. Got turned away from every restaurant as they were ""full"".
5. Went to the concierge who were quite rude!
6. Needed to ask for a manager before I very politely got shown through to the counter bar at the Grill ( which was more than excellent, exquisite food!)
So my one criticism would be....  ""guys, don't judge everyone upon whether they are wearing a bow tie or not, us t shirt guys can pay our way and might not have such a big mortgage!"" ...... a certain CEO of Apple comes to mind!",4,2016,10,08
130,Outstanding! ,"3 nights ago, I decided to visit The Dorchester for a special occasion.

I contacted the reservations team who did my booking and I spoke to them with regards to what I had planned. 

Freddie from guest relations contacted me on the morning on the visit and he was my life saver! He was very polite, friendly and he went out of his way to provide me and my partner an amazing experience. 

Anyway, we got to The Dorchester and Katarina from guest relations came over to the desk, introduced herself and showers us around the hotel and took us up to our room. Well.... in the lift she told us they had upgraded us to a suite! She was always there for us when I had any questions or problems. She was wonderful and her hosting skills are impeccable. 

They had pulled out all the stops and honestly, the terrace suite was AMAZING!  It was beautiful, modern, clean and the view from the terrace (outside) was sensational. It has the a view of Park Lane and overlooks Hyde park. Stunning!

The butler came and introduced himself and ensured we were settling in well and he was so friendly. I cannot fault anyone at all because everybody was so polite, kind and willing to help. 

Whilst I was out for dinner, I spoke to the hotel and asked if it was possible to set up the in room jacuzzi and when I got back it was done perfectly, to the perfect temperature, lights on, music on and candles and it was bliss!

We ordered our breakfast in room and it came on time as requested from the night before and it was set up so beautifully in the dining room. 

In the morning, we had the couples spa booked from 12-4pm which includes treatments and lunch and so they held our luggage for us and let us check out after lunch. 

The spa itself was subliminal. The night before I had spoken to Natalie and she was one of the most nicest people I have come across and so genuine. She helped me choose a package and made the lunch so special! It was so nice and intimate and me and my partner were given privacy. The lunch was really nice (and healthy) and it was presented so beautifully.

After our spa, my partner and I decided to go shopping and come back later so we let katarina know and off we went. We came back, the front desk had done everything they needed to do including parking charges etc and within minutes I was off. 

I cannot fault The Dorchester at all. The service, the way they pulled out all the stops for me, the way they handled all my queries and requests and everything else. They made our stay a very very special stay and I cannot thank them enough. 

The only one thing I have to complain about is.. I wish I stayed longer! I read reviews before I went and I went feeling a little put off and abit worried. I saw pictures and I thought oh my god what have I done? But honestly, the level of service and the hotel itself is superb and I would definitely go back. Without even a shadow of doubt! 

See you soon!

Excellent on every level. It's such a delight to be able enjoy great food and service.  
Advisable to book it gets very busy. 
Dress code is not very casual. ",5,2016,09,29
130,Good hotel but bad service,I stayed in the hotel on a very short trip to London. I was checking in early morning and was to check out later in the day. The duty manager lady was checking me in and asked to provide a deposit to cover cost of room and another 150£ for incidentals. I gave her cash dollars to cover the deposit. However she refused to give me a receipt for the cash. This was not acceptable and only on my insistence and threatening to walk out she grudgingly gave me a hand written receipt. Her behaviour was bordering on rudeness. Not a pleasent experience for an early morning check in after a long flight. The quality of room was very good but attitude of staff spoilt the stay.,3,2016,09,29
130,Luxury Hotel that lives up to expectations ,The Dorchester is immaculate and whilst a large hotel has an intimate feel.  The rooms are large - even the standard rooms have plenty of space with large bathrooms.  Bath showers vs more modern walk in showers.  The quality of finishing and attention to detail is definitely top end as you would expect from a hotel with the pedigree of the Dorchester. Unlike other traditional brands the hotel is NOT tiered and delivers against its reputation.  Excellent visit although the English breakfast was a little disappointing but you can't have it all.  ,5,2016,09,24
130,Quality without compromise,"Premium product, all was good except my room allocation, a park view would have been nice. Room was luxurious. Internet fast. Restaurants were amazing & service was personal and friendly. Food in the bar was impeccable as was the wine. Location superb. Will certeinly return as beats alm the modern non charecteridtic joints. A bit if Royal English charm, highly appreciated.",4,2016,09,24
130,Quintessential British,"From the minute you are greeted outside, to the check in desk, you will feel like a VIP.
And yes, you will run into a lot of well known business folks,Famous Rock and Rollers lounging at the bar,all no nonchalantly soaking up the atmosphere.The average rooms are on the small side,but it really doesn't matter as they make up for it with the cozy feel of bygone days.It's a great location,and the Concierge is staffed by real pros that can really conjure up magic when it comes to dinner reservations or tickets to events.
The service is impeccable,and understated in the usual British way.As you would expect in London,nothing is cheap anymore.But The Dorch"" is worth the splurge.
The memory will linger long after the Amex Bill ;))))

130,Lovely hotel lived upto expectations,"Lovely hotel which lived up to Brand expectations. I stayed here with my daughters as a treat while and straight after running the London marathon!

I am not usually a fan of historic type period hotels but the loved the period decor in my room and the ladies. 

The mattress and bedding was really comfy! Though we didn't have a view, I really enjoyed the cost, homely feel of the rooms!

Breakfast was delicious and dining area hall (I forget what it was called) was just beautiful!

Lovely hotel and a well deserved treat after running 26.2 miles!

I also had a deep tissue massage at the spa! I've forgotten the name of the lovely lady that gave me the massage. She was brilliant and knowledgeable about post race massages! Love the decor of the spa! It was extremely expensive but well worth it!",5,2016,09,14

130,"Very pleasant stay, just a bit noisy","The Dorchester has a wonderful entrance way with stunning flower arrangements just beyond reception that line the route to the various restaurants. 

We had booked a suite on a special offer so it very spacious with a separate seating area and large bedroom. All the usual facilities as you would expect. 

It was comfortable and would get 5 stars but this room was over the entrance and late into the night and from early morning the porters door was opening and closing with a very loud metallic bang.

We have also eaten in some of the hotel's restaurants which are very nice with a good choice of styles and price ranges.",4,2016,09,09
130,Just love it,"Friendly and helpful staff ..

130,Very disappointing,"We thought we would treat ourselves to a stop over following a shopping trip. Great check in experience. We couldn't get a table at the grill for dinner till 9.30pm. Not great so we decided to have room service. This was okay. Good steak! No mini bar price list, no complimentary tea/coffee on offer or facilities. Air con not heating in room. TV not working. Technician came to fix but couldn't. No offer to change rooms. We had no tv for the stay! Breakfast good. We had been told there would be a £200 reserve on credit card as the room and breakfast had been paid for. Instead over a thousand was reserved on my credit card. The receptionist was very unhelpful snd said it was a mistake and she can't explain it. She shrugged her shoulders and said we could change rooms for the last 45 minutes of our stay! We asked to see a manager and she said she was the manager!! We insisted on someone else. She eventually removed the room service charge which was £116! Offered us an upgrade at our next stay and promised a tv! We wasted a lot of time being dragged through a horrible experience at reception. What a shame!",2,2016,09,04
130,The only true 5-star hotel in London,"There are lots of 5-star hotels in London but only The Dorchester lives up to the expressed and implied expectations of a 5-star hotel.

Every single member of staff was friendly and professional and went out of their way to make our stay perfect from the moment we arrived.

It's the little things that make a true 5-star worthy of such an accolade and The Dorchester excelled in every manner.

My wife and I stayed in the Harlequin Suite with our two boys aged 6 and 8 and the suite was fantastic. We had our own roof terrace with amazing views and were looked after by a team of butlers who could not have done enough for us.

I must have casually mentioned that it was my wife's birthday when booking although I don't even recall doing so.  There was a birthday cake in the room and  a gift for my wife of a complimentary spa treatment. 

The room wasn't cheap but you should get what you pay for and The Dorchester didn't let us down.

After trying several other alleged 5-star hotels in London, The Dorchester will be our first and only choice on future stays in London.

130,Absolute luxury. Long live The Dorchester,"This was my first ever trip to London on a business trip and I enjoyed the most luxurious stay in possibly the most beautifully decorated and maintained hotel. Absolutely luxurious. 

The rooms are decent size with some bigger but all amenities available. The Dorchester takes good care of people. 

We had some meetings in the Pavilion Room on the top floor. What elegantly set up and beautifully decorated that room was.

Visit to the health center and spa is a must. The spa is a destination in its own right. 

The front desk staff is very helpful and do a very good job. Seniors at the concierge are a little less interested but all in all, a perfect debut visit to London. Thank you Dorchester.

I won't talk about location as it is just across Hyde Park and easily accessible.",5,2016,09,02
130,Perfect place for an Anniversary Weekend,"We booked the Dorchester through Amex Fine Resorts and were delighted to be informed that our room upgrade was better than expected.  We ended up in a gorgeous, and very spacious suite for the weekend.  We'd booked a theatre matinee and early dinner and were glad as we could relax and enjoy the room.  The staff were as you would expect, polite and helpful.   We ordered a late supper through room service which was delicious.  We were also delighted to discover that our room service breakfast was allowed as part of our bed and breakfast deal (we expected to have to pay it in addition as we've had to in many other hotels).    Having booked Afternoon Tea (which was also delicious) for the following day, we took advantage of late checkout which meant we could relax and enjoy our afternoon.  The Dorchester was everything we expected it to be and we will definitely repeat the experience in future.",5,2016,08,30
130,Wow! How the other half live!,"I was lucky enough to attend a charity function in the Dorchester Ballroom. Valet parking very reasonable, cheaper to drive and valet park than catch the train and get a taxi - so London.
Beautiful surroundings and lovely food. Staff just as attentive and polite to us 'poorer folk' as to the guests who could afford £10,000 for an action item.",5,2016,08,28
130,The ambiance of tradition in London,"Just spent a few nights at the Dorchester at the recommendation of a friend.  My first time there.  

Fantastic experience.  My room was spacious decorated with the traditions of England.  The room appointments were outstanding with everything being ""crisp"".  The front desk team was nothing short of spectacular handling my early arrival with ease. 

The afternoon tea (one of my favorite English traditions) was wonderful.  Dining in the restaurants was equally pleasant with very good food from the starters to dessert.  

Would I stay there again -- absolutely yes.  A great big thanks to the staff for a tremendous experience.",5,2016,08,24
130,All luxury vehicles parked out front,"Beautiful expensive luxury vehicles outside The Dorchester looked like an exotic car show. Just a hint of the clientelle of famous and rich that stay inside.

Doorman very friendly let us take pictures with all the cars but dont touch,  crowds milling outside.",5,2016,08,23
130,Excellent for everything,"I stayed here for one night . The room was beautiful. The bed was one of the best I've ever slept in.
Breakfast was excellent.
I booked theatre tickets through the theatre desk and it was as simple as pie. It took the stress away from me and the lady behind the desk was efficient and very knowledgable.
The staff were great. Very helpful.
I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a real luxury five star stay.",5,2016,08,12
130,Hmmmm,"As usual the service here is exceptional,  and the position in Mayfair convenient (and it really needs to be as the room rates are on the steep side) but a few slight niggles - shower not great, fruit in room not replenished, TV in room not in the best of positions.  At this level these minor annoyances shouldn't really occur.",4,2016,08,10
130,We just love this hotel,"Although the prices in London are steadily increasing we love this hotel. My husband and I have stayed many times throughout the past 21 years and it never disappoints. 

The room's are all furnished to a high standard, the staff are so friendly and no matter what you want or ask for the staff never give you the impression that it is any trouble. 

It is.also a great place to have dinner or afternoon tea.

Not to be missed even.if it is just for one night special occasion if you can ",5,2016,08,09
130,Great place,"Excellent rooms and service. The staff are so polite. The rooms are made up perfectly. The interior and exterior are so pretty. 
Great location. It's a short walk to almost all the best spots and also close to two underground tube lines. I enjoyed my stay here.",5,2016,08,06
130,wonderful stay,The hotel is in the best part of London -Mayfair- quite posh but full of nice restaurants and clubs. Still close from very young areas such as Soho and Marylebone. The room was perfect with a nice living room and view on the park. Very quiet too. The staff is discreet while being very helpful and professional. The price is the same in all the palaces of London but this one definitely is one of the best with Claridges and Connaught ! Lovely place to stay ,5,2016,07,31
130,London holiday,"We stayed here for 6 days
The quality of the hotel is first class the staff have the ability to read your mind and know your every move
The service they offer is excellent 
We received a room upgrade and could not have been happier
If you need any assistance with theatre or sight seeing the concierge  are very helpful and can arrange anything you need
Rod",5,2016,07,30
130,did not disappoint,"I have been to London a number of times for work and leisure and have always dreamt of staying at this hotel.  I booked what I could afford and was lucky to be given an upgrade to a suite.  As the title implies it truly lived up to my expectations.  The service, especially from the spa staff, was faultless.  Breakfast in the Promenade amongst the decor and flowers, the attention to detail and  the comfort and cleanliness of the suite were outstanding.  And most importantly for me the suite was quiet (including airconditioning and heating).  It is expensive but well worth it.  As I was travelling alone will definitely come back with my husband and book the suite.",5,2016,07,28
130,Timeless elegance,"This was our second stay at The Dorchester. All of the glamour and elegance is still intact. We chose a larger room and enjoyed greatly the extra space. Always request the Hyde Park view, spectacular!  Service is impeccable. The friendly and kind staff at the front desk and the 'best' concierge team make any visit memorable. WE ate breakfast and dinner in the new glamorous Grill and/or the classic Promenade. Excellent food and preparation. Service very professional from a well-trained staff.  The Bar is also a great place for a quick bite. Best Club sandwich in London!

There is a certain haughtiness in the atmosphere. The hotel caters to the well heeled and sometimes seems more interested in those people than your well-traveled patrons.
Security is high, as it should be, however it can seem a bit overbearing on the already 'in residence' guests  Much of this may help accommodate proper billing but does seem too much.  Large families with many children seemed to be the norm on this stay. We were forced to call security to quiet the unsupervised children. Pity for such a high class hotel.

As the room renovations proceed, we look forward to once again returning to the wonderful, The Dorchester.",5,2016,07,28
130,Recent stay,"Food was outstanding, one of the best dinners I've had in a while and the waiter was incredibly helpful when making choices and also with the wine selection.
The hotel bar is also very good, cocktails although slightly expensive are worth it. The room was a little cramped for a ""penthouse"" apartment but incredibly comfortable and the bathroom / bath was excellent.
As always the staff were excellent and more than helpful.",4,2016,07,28
130,Favourite in London,"Having been lucky enough to to stay in some of the best hotels in London, this has got to be my favourite.

The rooms are comfortable, well equipped and stylish and the bars/restaurants are top notch (I particularly enjoy The Bar for cocktails).",5,2016,07,27
130,Wonderful wedding,"We went to a wedding here. The hotel, rooms, service and overall atmosphere is faultless. Amazing service. Staff can not do enough for you; a very special kind of service.
Added to this is the quality foods immaculately presented. 
Can not think of any negatives - obviously price is premium but so is the product. If you can afford to stay here it is well worth a visit.",5,2016,07,26
130,Be careful what you wish for,"One of the grande dames of the London hotel scene, previously the haunt of old money, the elite of UK plc, the occasional celebrity in shades, and even prosperous families on a special treat trip up to London for the weekend. Today the Dorchester resembles (spiritually) nothing so much as the London outpost of the Burj al-Arab. Of course the building's style remains, with its fabulous OTT chintz and swagged luxury. But from the moment you arrive at the front door and see the row of gold spray-painted Bugattis (with six-wheel drive bespoke SUVs for the bodyguards) you will have no doubt about what the hotel has - sadly - become. 

The Dorchester has become the gold-tap capital of London. You will mix with billionaires from Russia, the Middle East and Asia, and will come to relish the pastiche of British gentility now served up by the exquisitely trained staff. Dining options are superb - although the somewhat Hades-like China Tang restaurant in the basement has come to offer a bland, unfortunately sanitized take on Chinese food, which is a pity given the credentials of the team in the kitchen.

It is a difficult place to like. London offers many better hotels and even several more expensive, or with higher bling quotients. The Dorchester finds itself trapped in a gilded, heartless, taste-free no-man's land.",3,2016,07,22
130,SUPERB!!!,"An exquisite hotel full of luxurious atmosphere. Superb service and amenities. Excellent restaurants, friendly staff, beautiful rooms and suites. Excellent location close to all one needs to do in central London and the West End.",5,2016,07,20
130,Cateys awards treat,"We had been short listed for a Catey award at the Grosvenor house hotel so decided to push the boat out for a stinking night at the Dorchester. 

The hotel was magnificent and delivered on each and every category on charm quality and Englishness. 

Simply superb!!

Must be the best hotel in London.",5,2016,07,18
130,"Exceptional service, traditional British luxury at its finest!","We spent three nights at this beautiful hotel, which is very adequately maintained to protect its heritage charm. Our room was delightful and serviced to perfection. The staff were exceptional - always friendly and attentive. 
The Grill's English Breakfast was outstanding, accentuated by the charming team who went above and beyond to make us feel at home.
A visit to the hotel is not complete without the luxury of Afternoon Tea in The Promenade - delightful savoury and sweet treats, and a divine setting to relax and unwind.",5,2016,07,16
130,Service reminiscent of a bygone era...,"Truly exceptional. Comfortable elegance and unsurpassed personal service ...an extension of your own home, Every effort is made to make you feel at home and to meet your needs/requirements. The afternoon tea service is an experience not to be missed. Incredible location for entertaining your guests as well. The staff will go to all ends to make your guests feel home. Highly recommend a visit to the Spa.",5,2016,07,13
130,Seemingly endless luxury,"Received a generous gift of one night's stay in this hotel from my parents. Stayed with my wife and couldn't fault the place. We arrived early and after a very warm and friendly welcome we were given our early check in with no fuss or delay. Our room was positively stunning - incredible bed, ultra-luxe bathroom and tasteful decor. The service is key in this hotel. Despite being rather big, they bend over backwards to make you feel like you are their single concern that day. Location is, obviously, unbeatable. Only minor negatives would be that I would change the decor of their breakfast room and house bar - a bit dated and visually jarring. Other than that, one of the nicer hotels I've ever seen. Strange as it may sound, the broad selection of international papers available to guests really impressed me.",5,2016,07,13
130,All round excellence,"High class but friendly service, from staff for whom nothing seems to be too much trouble. Beautiful hotel in a W1 location.  Top quality food, wonderful breakfast, not to be missed. Allround excellence.",5,2016,07,09
130,Love the smell of this hotel,"This is the second time my husband and I have stayed here this year for a weekend break from Merseyside...
We love it here... The rooms are absolutely divine, the bedding is that exquisite that I actually took the time to contact the supplier and but 4 sets of our own..
This is truly a fabulous 5 star luxury traditional hotel... Lots of things stand out.. The main afternoon tea area is beautiful, service excellent and the flower arrangements are worth checking in to see alone..
We have stayed in a few 5 star hotels in London and this is the top along with Claridges in our opinion...  ",5,2016,07,06
130,Pricey,"Stayed for a night,staff were well scripted,a bit robotic in their delivery. Room was comfortable,but pricey, have stayed in better and cheaper in london £35 for breakfast is a bit out of many people's pockets,won't be rushing back",4,2016,07,05
130,Iconic Hotel Does Not Disappoint,"We selected the Dorchester for our final few nights after being on the road for a month so we could finish off with a little comfort and style. All staff we came into contact with were attentive and exceedingly polite who always appeared genuinely interested and keen to please. The decor the restaurants and public areas was plush, luxuriant and yet welcoming. Food quality was exceptional. Beds were excellent and gave us the best nights sleep in a month. The upgrade to a suite was also much appreciated - thankyou! 

Overall, perhaps the best hotels we have stayed in across the globe and would certainly recommend it, and will return.",5,2016,06,29
130,Wow!,Stayed here on my wedding anniversary. Room was amazing. A small cake with Happy Anniversary was waiting for me which was lovely. The Bar was fantastic with live music. Breakfast was quality. Nothing too much trouble and the staff were simply wonderful. Some guests were extremely rude whilst there but all staff were polite and dignified. Bravo! ,5,2016,06,27
130,Wedding night in a Dorchester suite ,"This hotel is exceptional, without a doubt. It is a London landmark and as I live quite close, I often visit for drinks or dinner. 

This was the first time I actually stayed at the Dorchester and it was because I had my wedding in the amazing Penthouse & Pavilion suite on the 8th floor. The wedding itself was amazing and I can't recommend the events managing team more. 

The Dorchester suite was a lovely, huge suite and superbly luxurious. 

The only reason this is a 4-star review and not a 5-star is that, having stayed at so many other hotels of similar nature, I find the Dorchester is resting on its laurels a bit in terms of service and attention to detail: they are definitely the best super-luxury hotel in London but given the prices I would have expected a touch more. ",4,2016,06,26
130,Warm Welcome at the Promenade,"After a long flight from New York to London unfortunately, our room was not ready when we arrived at the Dorchester. However, a welcoming waitress (Chenga- Hungarian lady) offered us a table in the Promenade bar while we were waiting. My wife has several dietary requirements, however they were well catered. I must say that the service that this lady provided was amongst the best we have ever received! She was incredibly attentive and fun to make conversation with. Also, the hotel is absolutely stunning and very clean!
We would definitely return!",5,2016,06,24
130,Superb chocolate indulgence afternoon tea!,"Lovely experience! Up on the balcony for private dining with our own personal chef. Very attentive, with extensive knowledge about the different chocolates and their origins. Delicious variety of finger sandwiches (including coronation chicken, prawns and smoked salmon etc) and chocolate nibbles. Chocolate tea provided instead of regular english breakfast to prepare the buds. 
Overall, a great experience and will definitely be going back again.",5,2016,06,24
130,"Spectacular, Stupendous, Supreme","Dear Reader,

Those are just the words beginning in ""S"" I'd use to describe our stay at the storied, luxurious Dorchester.  Never before has one property impressed my wife and me in so many ways.  We arrived in from Monte-Carlo late evening and upon checking-in were treated to a room upgrade as it was our honeymoon.  Among the thoughtful touches–a sumptuous chocolate cake waiting for us when we walked in!  We had supper that evening on premise at the beautiful China Tang and the food was superlative.  Each day spent with the kind people at the Dorchester was a delight.  There was not a moment of disappointment or displeasure for me or my wife.  Topping off our wonderful experience, though, was the fabulous breakfast on the famous promenade.  We truly felt like Hollywood royalty during our entire stay.  How special the staff at the Dorchester made a couple from the foothills of East Tennessee feel!  We hope to return for an anniversary trip.

Many thanks,

Tyler Engle",5,2016,06,24
130,"Too many little things not precisely all right, tarnishing the golden picture","My expectations towards this top-class, fast legendary hotel were high. On the whole, this hotel fulfilled most of my expectations, living up to its five-star category. However, the devil is in the details, details that may betray a few weaknesses in management.

The overall setup of the lobbies and the room was awkward, with little mapping and pointers towards the different ground floor rooms. An excessive use of mirrors, as well as doors hidden behind folding screens, make it confusing. Staff are not informed about which room hosts which conference, which does not simplify this apparently trivial matter. Let us add some tea room doubling up as a lobby (and as a prayer room as well when I went through it apparently at the wrong time!) and the piano playing the wrong kind of music at the wrong time (Satie's gymnopedies when a room needed not to be quieted and reassured but excited).

Food-wise, a few items fell short of expectation: croissants and other breakfast pastries were less fresh than expected, and a few deserts bland if not tasteless. Sugar lumps for coffee, for a standing room, came up wrapped up individually: unnecessary and needlessly awkward, when a sugar pinch would have done the trick. But we get drawn down into tiny details.

Some heavier question marks arose when seeing staff at work: none of them wearing any badge, none of them boasting some form of joy of working, and a lot of people standing idle at the wrong place wearing the wrong face, namely that of the supervisor with nothing to supervise. Smiles, hard to come by, were strictly professional. I noticed some failures of teamwork as well.

Apart from these warning signs, shall we repeat the countless songs of praise, which mention the beauty of the building, the incomparable location in Park Lane (Monopoly players would have noticed, the most expensive place on the board), etc.",3,2016,06,23
130,The Quintessential London Hotel,"Everything about this hotel screams class. The property is beautiful. The staff is impeccable. The location is perfect. The cars parked out front will make you drool. We stayed in an executive king deluxe room and it was quiet, roomy and comfortable. The pillows were the best I've ever slept on. 

We ate at China Tang our first night in and every dish was amazing. Not your typical Chinese restaurant. We indulged at Alain Ducasse's restaurant our second night and were treated to an indescribable meal and experience  -- definitely worth the splurge. Don't miss out on breakfast or afternoon tea either in the grill or Promenade. 

Mayfair was a delightful neighborhood with unique restaurants and stores as well as great sights. The hotel was easy walking distance to Harrod's, too.",5,2016,06,23
130,Sheer class,"Reassuringly expensive, beautiful hotel even better staff. I'll be saving for my next visit. A special occasion hotel unless you're a millionaire, which I'm not! Haha. The food was lovely in the Grill,drinks too expensive in the bars so take plenty and spend it enjoy!",5,2016,06,22
130,Weekend break,"Arriving at this hotel we were kindly greeted by Philip in reception who was very helpful, informative and polite. He gave us a small tour of the promenade which was heavily decorated with large flower bouquets, this gave a very nice and impressive impression of what we could expect of our lodgings for the weekend. We was then taken to the newly renovated 6th floor, the carpet in the hallway was so plush you could of slept on it! our room was very nice with all the items you would expect from this standard of hotel it was nice and quite so no issues with getting a good night sleep. The room did have a mini bar with snacks but no tea/coffee making facilities (I don't drink it anyway) but room service is only a call away.
We had paid extra to enjoy a breakfast and was pleasantly satisfied with the options and great service, on the whole we had a great weekend away and would revisit.",5,2016,06,20
130,What a fantastic stay !! We'll be back for sure :),"We have previously stayed at Claridge's with our 2 closest friends and 'The Shard'. However, we wanted to try an alternative to Claridge's so the four of us have just returned home 19/06/16 from a weekend stay at 'The Dorch' (which it has become affectionately called by us all). Upon arrival, the door staff were extremely well presented, professional and polite. The hotel name and history suggests 'top quality' and as we entered the main reception area it became evident to us all we were about to follow in the footsteps of very fortunate people to be able to walk through those rotating doors. The Foyer is narrow and wide but 'quality' hits you, the structure and its decor, the shine, the staff dress code....simply 'top quality'. We were given a tour, then to our rooms. Ours was Room 633, along the most amazingly carpeted corridors and again, so clean and just 'wow'. The room, beautifully decorated, with everything you could need and set out in such a way which complimented the 'period' style of the hotel, the bed, the most comfortable yet !!. We ate in China Tang (see separate review). The Promenade and bar were just outstanding in every respect, food, staff etc the best you could ask for. We were also pleased to meet a previous friend from Claridge's - 'Orlando', one of the best members of staff ever !! we knew he had left Claridge's to take up employment at The Dorch - ""Look after him Hotel manager's, he's a gem !"". Overall, thoroughly recommended, we will return for sure - Thank you to all staff that made our weekend so fantastic.",5,2016,06,19
130,WOW! What an A-Ma-Zing Stay!,"For someone who is well traveled and only stay at luxury properties when traveling, it take a lot to impress me. BUT, After my visit to THE DORCHESTER in London, this is no longer true. I was truly WOW!!!! Everything about this property was amazing!

We had 3 nights/4 days of pure enjoyment: the room... A-Ma-Zing! The beds were like nothing I've experienced before. It made you want to stay in the bed; The Afternoon Tea... Speechless & well worth the cost; The food & services in ALL the restaurants... Top notch!  As we dinned outside of the hotel property for breakfast, lunch & dinner, we felt like we were chasing our dinning experiences at The Dorchester throughout our travels in London & Paris, but NOTHING measured up!

More importantly, the staff at The Dorchester were all awesome. From the first second we stepped onto the property until the second we departed, these incredible staffers made us feel welcome and ensured all our needs were taken care of.  Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!

This was my first trip to London, so Thank You all at The Dorchester for making my first trip to London a wonderful experience. You guys really set the bar through the roof! As we continued our travels to Paris and Geneva over the following 9 days, we found ourselves wishing we could've taken The Dorchester with us because nothing we experienced thereafter measured up to your property (and we stayed in luxury properties throughout)!

You will DEFINITELY see me again soon!!!

I can officially say that I'm a loyal client for life! 😊",5,2016,06,18
130,Very Posh with Great Service,"This must be one of London's finest hotels. The rooms were very lush and maintained a historic feel. The staff are very friendly, being accessible when needed but not being overly visible. They immediately remembered my name and politely addressed me whenever I came and went. The concierge were helpful with reservations, tickets and travel arrangements. The hotel is adjacent to Hyde park and close to anywhere you want to go in London. ",5,2016,06,15
130,Amazing suit,"I stayed here with a Creative Director who was able to afford the room.  Beautiful bedroom, separate leaving Room with very rich deco, flowers and everything on demand! This is a 5 star hotel that needs no reviews really.  You will have more than you expect! ",5,2016,06,15
130,Outstanding hotel in London,"From the moment we step in The Dorchester, Park Lane London, we were treated with impeccable and outstanding service. From the wonderful friendly staff to the awesome food and the wonderful ambiance. Beautiful room and amazing bed made for the best sleep ever. It's in a ideal location across from Hyde park so you have beautiful view of the park. The afternoon tea is definitely something to experience. I absolutely love this property!",5,2016,06,13
130,Luxury personified,"This place takes 5 star to another level. Lovely service and great people working there. It's pricey but perfectly placed within London and enough to keep you busy for weeks.
The best thing for me is the bed linens. They are so soft you don't want to leave!
The Bar is lovely and Cut across the road in 45 Park Lane is excellent.
One of the top hotels in London and I'm sure it will remain so for many years to come!",5,2016,06,13
130,The Best of the Best...,"From start to finish.....simply the best.  Very pricey but so worth it.  Great location across from Hyde Park.  Great restaurants and great service......5 Star Hotel and Service......a must stay!  Centrally located, easy to get around to all the places you want to see.....",5,2016,06,10
130,"The Dorchester, Park Lane London","If you get the chance, stay at The Dorchester.  Here's why...
It was a choice between staying at The Dorchester or staying with colleagues in a 5* hotel near London Wall.  I chose The Dorchester and my colleagues very soon both said they wished they had stayed at The Dorchester.   And their London Wall hotel was more expensive!
The Dorchester was excellent and the staff re simply the best.  No snobbery (they don't have to be as they don't need to prove anything), extremely friendly, always there for you, always attentive and always helpful.  
My room was excellent and large, with a king sized bed - although when I booked it I was told it was one of the 'smaller rooms'.   More than adequate for me, let alone a couple, comfortable chairs to sit in and crisp cotton bed linen.  Not much of a view, though.  
And they provide valet parking.  So if you have to drive to London and worry about parking, they will do all of that for you.  A tad expensive at £50 per day, but very convenient and worth it.  I noticed that there is a NCP nearby, 5 minute walk away, if you want to park the car yourself, which I assume will be cheaper. Watch out for the congestion charge as The Dorchester is exactly on the border of the congestion zone.  One wrong turn and it could cost you.  
Location of the hotel is superb:-
- adjacent to Hyde Park, No 1 London and Piccadilly.  
- Easy walking to Green Park tube and/or Marble Arch - 5-10 mins
- Taxis are also very easy to get.  
- Surrounded by lots of 'local' London pubs (but they can close early, so be warned)
- Hard Rock is 5 minutes away
- Fortnum and Mason, a 10-15 minute stroll (I mean a stroll, not a fast walk)
- Piccadilly Circus, a 15-20 minute stroll
Would I stay again?   I am already booking my next trip.",5,2016,06,05
130,Stupendous in every way,"We stayed at the Dorchester Hotel for 3 nights, it was the most amazing experience of Silver Service I have ever experienced in my life. The ambience was wonderful the Restaurants were extremely great, The staff were A1 . Never to be compared  or forgotten.",5,2016,06,04
130,Gorgeous if pricey cocktails,"A beautiful and surprisingly friendly one night stay. Stunning original Italian marble bathroom and the deepest baths in London. Lovely gushing taps so fill quickly as well. Bed beautiful and super king size in our standard room. Satellite on largish tv too - not as common as you might think. Stunningly decorated, especially for Christmas and a vintage sweet shop on the way in. People paying attention mainly to themselves, and big and bubbly range of cocktails in a somehow serene while happy and noisy bar. Unfortunately full English breakfast in bed cold tho presentation unsurpassable. Fish and chips 4 am had sufficed anyway and most food all night. Excellently stocked mini bar and room. Classical and building itself commands respect worthy of reverence in structure (Churchill and Eisenhower - whom a suite is named after - stayed over WW2 due to solidity of such). Other members of family upgraded at no extra charge to a stunning quiet classical and spacious elegant suite as booked three rooms. Lots of little goodies in room such as shoe and sewing kit perfectly made. Lovely old mirror and dresser. Perfect Friday night, tho would expect at £1,600. Solid walls and no disturbance. Maybe a little pricey, but never slept in such a comfy big bed. No signs of austerity anywhere!! A tip would be to leave the breakfast in bed - though beautifully presented, it was cold. Attendance and courtesy to all quiet and exquisite. Magnificent yet without being in any way too daunting. Interesting past and history - see during WW2 prescience of guests. ",4,2016,06,01

130,Best of the Best,"Fantastic Mayfair location. Park Lane and Hyde Park to the west/south and the beautiful streets of Mayfair to the east/south. The Dorchester is a spectacular building. The cut away so the front of the building is facing away from the corner, giving the building the added architectural treasure of a proper, glamorous entrance. Out of the famous Mayfair hotels, the Dorchester is the liveliest, most fashionable and has the most energy. The service is amazing, of course. And it's nice to be treated beautifully even if you may not be a celebrity. When you enter the hotel it's just a stunning setting with the huge urns of flowers and the well-turned out staff ready to lead you to your beautiful room. I had an executive deluxe. It was clearly fresh and in excellent condition. Everything was beautiful and the colors were subdued but an interesting combination which gave the space some pizazz. The bedding, as always, was pure heaven. Nothing like getting into one of the world's most comfortable beds with excellent pillows and fluffy duvets. The Dorchester is authentic luxury. It is a hotel that has a standard for perfection which has not been replaced with hyper-technological methods in order to replace the true style of great service. To me the hallmark of a true luxury hotel is a hotel that makes its best intentions and exacting standards come through. The fantasy of great service is all to often jarred by the reality of mistakes, imperfections and a weird ethos that anything is ""okay"" as long as a bottle of champagne comes with an apology. My dad used to say don't say your sorry: just do it right and then apologies aren't necessary. Thank you, Dorchester for providing a top presentation in your iconic Promenade, your glamourous and special-night-out worthy bars, delicious room service and a great team that ensures you are delighted to the point you never want to leave!",5,2016,05,25
130,Best hotel I've dined/stayed in,"What a fantastic hotel. Simply the height of class. Incredible cuisine, attentive service, fabulous rooms.

Exquisite.",5,2016,05,25
130,Business Meeting - Fantastic,"This hotel is fantastically located and the service/decor are amazing!

The hotel was within walking distance to shopping. My wife bought a beautiful coat.. We were also able to pick up gifts for our be friends at home like address books, magnets, pens ,etc.  The Dorchester is a world class hotel !",5,2016,05,16
130,Luxury and relaxation,"My wife and I stayed in a suite for four nights for a special occasion and what a wonderful stay we had.

The hotel itself is beautiful and spotless and gives you everything and more from what you would expect from such an instruction of an establishment. The staff couldn't be more attentive or welcoming. Every member of staff that we met whilst on our stay was so friendly and genuine and always smiled and said hello. The staff are clearly trained to a very high standard because anything you ask of them they know the answer and do it for you. We were particularly taken with the efforts of the maid who attended our room - what an asset to the hotel.

The rates are expensive compared to a hotel you just want to 'get your head down' in but if you're looking to stay here for any occasion I cannot recommend it highly enough. I'm a firm believer of you get what you pay for and you 'get' in bucket loads.

Thank you for making our anniversary so special and we will be back with you very soon!",5,2016,05,16

130,Best of The best ,"We stayed There for 4 nights having one suíte and one superior Room. I loved every minute. Extraordinary level of service, while friendly, os far from beeing familiar( it s hard to explain but I have When staff Acts too friendly, Very cómmon In American hotels) Beautiful Rooms even though our suíte Was Not remodeled. Deep bathtubs , great breakfast. Only problems it Is expensive and our Stay Was too short!",4,2016,05,08
130,Perfect Private Dinning,"I was fortunate enough to be invited to a private dinner to celebrate a few of our great medal winners 25th anniversary of their achievement.

The Dorchester is one of the most beautiful hotels in London and just walking in through the main entrance gives you a feeling of the history of this building. The staff are all very attentive and the good was incredible.

I may have to take wife there for afternoon tea.  Thank you to all the hotel team for making this special celebration so memorable.",5,2016,05,07
130,How a 5* hotel should be!,"We stayed in December 2015 for my husband's 30th. Have also stayed a couple of times previously. To sum up this is a perfect 5 star hotel - and how a 5 star London hotel should be! Everything about the hotel is done to perfection. I had pre-arranged a bottle of champagne for the room as it was my husband's birthday. There was also an added extra of a small cake! All staff are friendly and professional, from the door man, to reception, to the bar staff, to housekeeping. The rooms are a good size and have a very classic design, and modern bathrooms. The lounge area is a delight to be in, there are many floral displays to take in. I've not had dinner there, but been lucky enough to have breakfast there. We ate in The Promenade, the staff were exceptionally friendly and there was a variety of food options to have, all of excellent quality.",5,2016,05,04
130,Very Well Done,"I attended an event here at the ballroom, and a group of us had a drink at the bar first.

Service in all places was perfect, and we enjoyed their signature gin and tonics. The bar staff were very knowlageble and happy to advise on advice for cocktails.

For the number of people in the ballroom, the food was excellent and testament that fine dining can be done on a grand scale. Excellent evening.",5,2016,05,02
130,A very grand experience,One doesn't normally get the opportunity of staying at one of London's most iconic hotels but for once I did.  A truly superb place with all that goes with it.  Running shoulders with iconic people and the staff are absolutely spot on.  A franking awe inspiring experience.,5,2016,04,29
130,Never fails to impress,"I have been coming to this hotel for years either for business or pleasure or just to dine in one of the super restaurants. My most recent stay was as excellent as ever. Rooms, whilst not large (but then it is London) are beautifully decorated and the marble bathrooms are really luxurious. All the public areas in the hotel are beautiful and sitting in the main lounge area is a real treat watching the world go by whilst having tea or sipping a cocktail. What makes this hotel so special is the wonderful staff - everyone you encounter is friendly and efficient and seem genuinely interested in you. 

This is definitely one of the best hotels in London.",5,2016,04,28
130,"Excellent, as ever","The Dorchester is one of my long standing favorites in London. While I must admit it is my runner-up to my favorite, it's still one of the finest hotels for many reasons. The Dorchester is, first off, beautiful. The lobby is so lovely, with its huge urns of flowers, it's nearly intimidating. The building is exquisite, the site is unsurpassable and the service is spot-on in the fantastic British tradition of ""only the best will do."" Sadly, very few hotels seem to take the quality of its service, which is not just ""good service "" seriously. Quality service is where the hotel standards are so high it's impossible for the most discerning guest to experience any thing but total  perfection. What makes the Dorchester and only a few other hotels this special is it is all done perfectly on the first try. Most five star hotels decidedly do not attempt to employ these standards.
I much prefer flawless service and pristine housekeeping, along with lovely public areas and comfortable rooms to gadgets galore and high tech and glitzy. I'm not suggesting the Dorchester is not absolutely up to date but the emphasis is on hospitality. My Executive Deluxe Room was polished, elegant and in perfect condition. I was delighted to get my preferred view and some nice welcome treats. Nothing beats a beautifully made bed with spectacular bedding. The Dorchester knows how to pamper me by ensuring their highest standards are continuously met, despite it being a rather large hotel. And the Dorchester's not so secret weapon is The Promenade and the exquisite bar.  My only tiny suggestion is the hotel's front of house and reservations department should be more friendly and welcoming prior to arrival.  I often call ahead to communicate my preferences (being proactive cuts down on disappointments) but this is one hotel of this caliber, where substance and style are matched by service, where my attempt to communicate is invariably met with an implacable, impersonal manner.",4,2016,04,26
130,Stunning,"Sheer opulence in London city centre.  The staff were amazing, looked after every detail of our experience.  Word of warning though for the ""drop-in"" visitors - jeans/ T-shirt/ trainers aren't really the atire for this establishment.",5,2016,04,24
130,Top quality hotel,"A Christmas present from my husband saw us spend two nights in this spectacular hotel, steeped in tradition. Check in was smooth and concierge keen to help with luggage etc. Our room wasn't particularly spacious but had been recently refurbished to a high standard, and the bed! Quite possibly the best two nights sleep I'd had in 46 years!

Breakfast was obscenely overpriced (£34) but worth paying for in order to (1) experience the exceptionally high level of customer service and attentiveness that influenced this 5* rating and (2) to people watch! Breakfast is served in The Promenade, decorated with THE most exquisite and largest, flower displays I've ever seen. The smell of the fresh flowers hit you as soon as you walked into the hotel was magnificent.
 
But, back to people watching! We must have outstayed our welcome on both mornings, not that you would tell from the service by the waiters who were more than happy to engage in conversation. But when faced with the large numbers of guests / visitors to the hotel, I couldn't tear myself away from watching their (at times) bored attitude to receiving the best levels of customer service I've ever experienced. They must be used to places like The Dorchester....I wasn't, loved it and would like to go back - Christmas is only 8 months away! 

Well done Team Dorchester - we thought you were awesome.",5,2016,04,24
130,Good place for a night in a central location,"I enjoyed another pleasant night at the Dorchester whilst transiting London for the day. If you want a luxurious central London place at a reasonable price, this is a great choice. The service is impeccable, the attention to detail is very good and the suites are perfectly appointed and very clean. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is just wonderful. I would really struggle to pick any fault with any single aspect of my stay. The bar in the promenade does a really great selection of signature cocktails and the bartender was more than happy to carefully explain all the new ones to me. Not to be missed.",5,2016,04,23
130,"Opulence I can manage, service that can't be topped. Highly recommend ","I've just had an amazing first time stay at this most magnificent hotel. As someone who doesn't like pretentious opulence I've often stayed in nearby hotels but this time thought I'd give this hotel a try. I couldn't be happier with my choice. 

The staff and management's attention to detail and personal service to each guest is unparalleled. Dare I say done just right without being intrusive? Excellent location - a walk from my fav restaurant in London, Scott's. Hotel restaurants and food also magnificent - I'd highly recommend a treat in their 3 star Michelin restaurant Alain Ducarte. This hotel is now my home of choice when in London. Well done to Management ",5,2016,04,23
130,2015 at The Dorchester,"very nice hotel with a very good location on the park lane , many rooms have hyadpark View.

lobby is very busy , spicily for after noon tea.

the hotel has one of the best spa in London.

very close to most shopping",4,2016,04,20
130,A return visit but ....,"A young lady who checked me in was delightful and showed real hospitality to start my return visit in the right mood. Assigned room is nice and spacious with all the great amenities to make a good stay. However, some items seem to run out during the 3 nights stay and were replaced by similar items. Evening turn down were always after 8 pm.

As previous visit, the only friendly and efficient concierge was Paul (the tall one with bold head). Some of his colleagues could not really bother to follow up on my requests and revert bak timely.

Breakfast in promenade on Sunday morning was terrible with those gentlemen seems not to be alert and happy to be of service. It took 30 minutes for simple egg dish. The breakfast at the Grill on second day was delightful. The young gentleman was alert, very friendly and efficient. The last day of breakfast at promenade was good though with different person (lady staff).",4,2016,04,16
130,Fantastic hotel for a weekend getaway,"As i live so close to London, I don't often find myself in need of a hotel to stay at whilst visiting. However, after deciding to treat myself to a weekend break in the run up to christmas, i decided to stay at the Dorchester after several reviews from friends. 
My hotel was quaint, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The staff were incredibly attentive to my needs and would always greet me with a smile whenever they saw me in the lobby. 
The hotel is busy, but not imposing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone looking for a luxury break in the city.",5,2016,04,15
130,Five Star Conference Experience,"Working in four star hotels for many years and being involved in the preparation and management of major conferences I know the difference between a good conference experience and an excellent one! 

The conference experience here was the best I have ever had and it was clear that everything has been taken into careful consideration from comfortable seating, lighting, stationary and amazing catering options. 

Due to living in Northern Ireland I will probably never be at the Dorchester again however my aim is to get back to try out the accomodation,  afternoon tea and food and beverage in the future. It is a fantastic, welcoming luxury hotel and all of our needs where anticipated.",5,2016,04,10
130,"WONDERFUL HOTEL, FRIENDLY STAFF, GREAT LOCATION !!!","Recently stayed in The Dorchester Hotel with my wife and another couple as part of a Christmas Present for two nights. It was wonderful! The staff are very good, make you feel very welcome and are warm and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The location of the hotel is perfect with the lovely Hyde Park on your right and Regent Street a leisurely 15 minute walk via Berkeley Square on your left. The Breakfast experience served in The Promenade is a delight. The only criticism is no tea and coffee facilities in the room.",5,2016,04,07
130,One of the top hotels in London,"This is one of the top hotels in London. It's in Park Lane which is close to Hyde Park. Obviously there are people who prefer to stay around the Strand and Charing Cross area. By comparison this one is a slightly quieter area.

There is the Alain Ducasse restaurant with 3 Michelin stars, and the guests range from celebrities, millionaires or descendants of Arabic elite - so this is a very very expensive hotel.

It doesn't have a very beautiful view from the window - but in London who has?",5,2016,04,06
130,Amazing hotel in London city,"Gorgeous hotel in London with lots of charm. The staff here are what sets this hotel apart, reception are so welcoming and warm and can't do enough for you. And to the restaurant staff who remember your breakfast order and pre-empt your every need. Room was perfect and huge, bed was really comfortable we slept so well on our three nights there. Didn't get a chance to try out the spa when there but heard it is excellent. Looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2016,04,01
130,Beware Gift Vouchers,"The hotel is superb, one of the best I have ever stayed in. Built in the 30's but don't expect Art Deco , there are some glimpses of inter war modernism but mostly the style is luxurious and classic. My only real gripe is that the stay was bought as a present by a voucher. I rang many months in advance but couldn't secure a Saturday with the voucher so settled for a Friday instead. However, out of curiosity I looked on various websites and the same room could have been booked for my requested Saturday. I suppose the Brunei investment vehicle that owns the hotel needs to maximise revenue. Just be aware if buying an experience for a loved one that you may not get quite what you want.",2,2016,03,31
130,Outstanding Service,"We stayed at the Dorchester as part of my 8 year old sons birthday long weekend. All of the staff were exceptional but particular note should be paid to Joanna who made our stay particularly special.
The hotel is very good but the service is exceptional.",5,2016,03,30
130,Absolutely First Class,"An amazing experience start to finish.
Obviously not cheap but worth every penny.

Perfect hotel to celebrate a special occasion.

The service is second to none.
Rooms are spectacular and exactly what you'd expect from a top London hotel.

Food is excellent whether is breakfast, lunch or dinner. Bars have a great atmosphere and are perfect to relax and enjoy a few drinks after a long day.

Most definitely one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.
 ",5,2016,03,25
130,A lovely stay in London,"I had a very lovely stay in London, the staff is welcoming, the room was gorgeous with a giant marble bathtub and we even enjoyed some cute amenities in the room. I highly recommend The Dorchester for a luxury stay in London!",5,2016,03,25
130,A fairy tale,So I had planned to continue my 50 th birthday celebrations from family in Colombo to friends in London..took 18 of my girlfriends to party and the Dorcester gave me the most happiest moments of my life in just four days ...London will never be the same as it did for us in Feb 2916 ( 18 - 22) .. Their service is unmatchable . We were treated like fairies... The staff and the hotel gave us the comforts of a place.. The food at China Tang was to be shameless and not stop eating. So good . The hotel is centrally located and is epic ... Everything about it is so charming that you never want to believe your stay will end .....I will go back again and again and again ...,5,2016,03,23
130,Superb Venue for Christmas,"We visited for Christmas supper. What a wonderful experience. The food, service and ambience were simply superb. In particular, the decorations were beautiful. This is not a cheap venue but is well worth splashing out for on a special occasion. So glad we did.",5,2016,03,23
130,Consistently wonderful!,"Been coming here for over 25 years and it is always like coming home!

The bar is a lot of fun and the concierge and doormen are just so efficient - they are like swans - always paddling hard beneath the surface!

We love all the rooms and suites. There is such a choice of decor and the front of house team make every effort to keep us in the rooms we like the most!",5,2016,03,23
130,nice place,"This hotel is nice place, and most of rich people visit it. I can say its good to invite some one in the resturan and you will injoy with good service and nice food, there is alot of things to order it.
Many Thanks",4,2016,03,22
130,A little bit of luxury,Stayed in a Superior King Room overnight when attending 2016 Demolition Awards in the hotel.  Very comfortable room.  Took a bit of patience to get the shower temperature to stabilise though. Bowl of fresh fruit in the room was a nice touch.  Very attentive staff throughout.,4,2016,03,20
130,Family weekend away,"Stayed hear for 1 night with my kids and the rooms were very basic and there was no restaurant at all to get some food in the hotel, comfy bed and clean room but only 1 bar off soap in the bathroom and that's all. The TVs kept bussing all the time and was annoying. There was an extension lead for the kettle behind the bed but it didn't work.",2,2016,03,19
130,Lush cocktails and bar,"Ok, we couldn't afford to stay here but we wanted a slice of posh so we went to the bar. To deter people like us wanting a novelty drink in their establishment they put a rather ridiculous service charge on your bar bill if it's under £100. So naturally, we spent £100!! 
And we don't regret it! We had an amazing experience and, even though we clearly don't belong here, we didn't feel out of place! Unlimited bar snacks were brought to our table and we didn't even have to request it. For £100 we had a very nice bottle of wine and 4 cocktails. Not too bad really when you consider which part of London we chose to drink in! The bar man who took orders from our table was very friendly and made  decent conversation with us. Amazing evening.
If I have a spare £100 again I will gladly go for round two! ",5,2016,03,19
130,Another Great Hotel.,The above month is not accurate.  I was attending a board of directors meeting; brought my wife with me.  We were the last plane out of the USA and the last plane from the USA to land at LHR because of the Iceland volcano.  A pretty good place to be stranded for five days.  A lovely English hotel with outstanding food and service.  Fortunately I had purchased four first class Eurostar tickets to Paris.  The other couple were diverted to Brussels.  I gave my two now extra tickets to another director and spouse.  No problem with the train.  First class is nominally more expensive on the Eurostar.   My fourth favourite hotel in London.,5,2016,03,16
130,The Dorchester,"One of the best hotels I have ever visited.Service is excellent.
Excellent restaurants and bars in the hotel.
I was amazed by a member of staff that could see a shopping bag was split and without any request or prompting, came along with a bag to ensure the shoping was not lost. Very attentive and observant.",5,2016,03,16
130,Birthday treat,"I took four rooms for my family as part of a 70th birthday celebration for my Mum.

The rooms were great and the reception staff were very attentive. I may have got this wrong, but think Katherine was the person who looked after us and remembered our family's names throughout the stay and kept making sure we were enjoying ourselves.

I checked in before everyone else and I got a call in my room to let me know that my parents were going to be upgraded which made the birthday even more memorable.

It's a little strange not to have a kettle in the room and ordering tea and coffee to the room was hit and miss - on the Saturday afternoon it didn't turn up and took over an hour in the evening. Reception were kind enough to have a kettle sent to two of the rooms. Only a small distraction from a great weekend. 

I'm booked to go back at the start of July and looking forward to it.",5,2016,03,15
130,Great English service,"I'd been At he Dorchester several times for business
The food at one of the restaurant is great as well at the smile service
Every where you go
The rooms are big for London
And the area is in the centre of the action in London
Some extra charges for room service are a little bit extreme 
But company pay for it so it is ok
",5,2016,03,10
130,AMAZING,Popped in here for a drink on the way to the restaurant for a friends 30th Birthday. An amazing service with lovely internal decoration. I felt like I was famous. I highly recommend going in here. Oh and the toilets are absolutely amazing. ,5,2016,03,10
130,Splendid from start to finish,"Returned from a Friday night stay at the hotel with a friend of mine who was celebrating her birthday. I advised the hotel prior to our arrival that is was my friends birthday and what a lovely surprise first of all for the reception staff to acknowledge this on arrival and also when we got into our room to find a lovely birthday cake waiting for her. We were in a deluxe bedroom which was just luxurious. One thing we did notice was that they were no tea/coffee facilities in the room however that was such a small thing it really didn't make any difference to us. The room was wonderful, very spacious, glorious big bathroom just wonderful. Everything was spotless. 
The whole evening of having drinks and canapes to dinner was just lovely. I could not fault a single thing. The staff were extremely friendly and more than helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. 
The breakfast next day in the pavilion was a delight, we were brought a basket of pastries which was more than enough, although the Eggs Benedict I ordered was also so delicious. 
Would 100% love to return to the hotel and I would certainly recommend it to my friends and family.",5,2016,03,07
130,LOVELY STAY,"Enjoyed afternoon tea, relaxed in the bar with friends and a lovely overnight stay, Room was very small but i never stayed in it other then to sleep so it was not a problem. the staff were attentive if not a bit too rigid for my liking.",5,2016,03,06
130,Luxury and discreet service,"Obviously, this is a famous hotel, so you arrive with great expectations, or at least curiosity. The Dorchester more than lives up to its reputation. Its staff is ever vigilant, but manages to remain unobtrusive; the luxury is there, but feels just right and comfortable, rather than ostentatious.
My room, on the 6th floor, was spacious, and I probably could have fitted my flat into the excellent bathroom. Room service was impeccable; the concierge extremely helpful. I also tried the spa, which was fine - the treatments are great. I did not see a pool, though.
Whether or not you stay in this hotel - you ought to try their High Tea. Note that you should go hungry - there is a lot of food to go with the tea (there is a wide selection), and you will want to at least try it all: sandwiches, scones, tea cakes, and more cakes.",5,2016,03,04
130,Timeless Luxury.,"  Illustrious guests have been flocking to this glamorous hotel since the 1930s and today The Dorchester Hotel continues to embrace the luxurious atmosphere of bygone era. 
   Located  in the heart of London , with great panorama of Hyde Park , this beautiful property manages extremely well to preserve its historical inheritance.
  I was lucky to call the Dorchester home 4 times in the last 12 months and the hotel have managed to impress in every single occasion. Well done .
  Check in was efficient and all relevant info given with class . We were taken to the room where the usual welcome card, lovely fruits and delicious cake were waiting, making you fell really at home .
  This time we stayed in one of the executive rooms looking at the park . It was extremely fresh , spacious and chic . 
  Breakfast is a show apart. Always  served right on time with a big smile. And more : expect nothing less than the best ingredients and the most beautiful presentation that one can dream of . Fantastic. 
   This stunning hotel had different restaurants and bars to suit all moods, none of them is a territory for those on a restricted budget, however , the service and quality are simply great and it is definitely money well spent . 
   What's to fault???? Nothing really but the gym could have a fresher look . 
   Big Plus  : this time we have noticed that the famous promenade is a resident only space after 22:00 . Superb news .
   The Dorchester embodies the highest service values and I can't wait to call this beautiful place home for the 5th time soon . 
   
  ",5,2016,03,02
130,Fabulous!,"In my opinion the Dorchester is the best hotel in London!

We stayed here in December and had a wonderful time - The entire experience was faultless.

Professional service and we enjoyed the most delicious Sunday lunch in the Grill.

The room was stunning - recently re-furbished, extremely spacious and overlooking Hyde Park. 

I cannot wait to return.",5,2016,02,29
130,Wonderful stay,"Upon arrival we had the nice surprise of being upgraded in a ""park suite"" on the 4th floor, overlooking Hyde Park and Park Lane . 

The suite itself was beautiful, spacious and well equiped (large bathroom, very comfortable bed, and a large dining/living room). The decoration is deliciously old- fashionned, and the ambiance is a cosy and warm one.

Service has clearly lived up to our expectations. Breakfast was delicious, and the ""promenade"" room where it is served is simply magnificent. 

The Dorchester is one of the very finest 5 stars hotel ever visited. Congratulations to the management and staff for giving their guests such a refined taste of English finest tradition of hospitality.",5,2016,02,29
130,Nothing special....,"Hotel have a good location, but needs to be refurbished. Rooms are old, bathrooms are totally outdated , TV didn't work properly and rooms have no soundproof. For the price I rather stay at The  Bulgary or The Beaumont.",2,2016,02,28
130,Life of luxury,"I had the pleasure of staying here in May, 2015 for 4 nights. It is in the centre of London.  The service and amenities are totally 5 star.   The bathroom is generous in size and in marble. It has a separate shower and bath tub.  The atmosphere is of quiet luxury.",5,2016,02,28
130,Luxury Plus,"Stayed here several times. Gorgeous hotel. Prime location. Wonderful rooms. Great staff. Impeccable service. Travelling with a small group. Bar manager seated us at same table each evening for drinks pior to dinner. Beautiful people. Vibrant. Gets more so later. 

Rooms are beautiful. Tea is a special treat. Excellent concierge service as would be expected from a hotel of this quality.",5,2016,02,21
130,Stylish,"Excellent service from the very friendly doorman, the reception staff, bar and Grill. Room was spacious and comfortable and the Champagne flight at the Champagne bar is well worth a try. Excellent jazz band and the food at the Grill was superb. The only downside was a slight plumbing fault which was not sorted out although this would not put us off going again.",5,2016,02,21
130,Very comfortable,"Very comfortable and excellent service made it a pleasure to stay. I was on my own so had a basic Queen Room but it was spotlessly clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the staff were very helpful in arranging an early check in for me, which I had requested in advance via email. Although there was no bath in the bathroom the huge walk-in shower and marble tiled bathroom was wonderful.

I was catching up with an old friend. We didn't use the bar in the Dorchester - past experience has shown it to be a real let down. The old bar from years ago was far more tasteful and the clientele more agreeable. Just across the road is 45 Park Lane, the Dorchester's sister 'boutique' hotel and the bar there is fabulous for quality cocktails.",5,2016,02,19
130,First Class in Every Way,"I had booked a weekend in the Dorchester as part of the celebrations for my husband's 70th birthday.  On arrival we were greeted at the door and directed to reception, where we were checked in by Max.  He then said he would take us to our room, on the journey to the first floor he told us we had been given an upgrade to a Dorchester Suite.  The suite was absolutely beautiful and housed every amenity you could wish.  A birthday cake was also delivered.
Over the years we have stayed in many fine hotels in the U.K. and abroad but I have to say The Dorchester knocks spots of the rest.  Not only was the hotel immaculate, the attention to detail perfect, the service was outstanding.  Every member of staff made us feel so welcome, comfortable and gave 100%.
Max who checked us in always acknowledged us, with a smile that could light up a room, every time we passed reception.",5,2016,02,18
130,Beautiful hotel with fantastic service ,"We have just returned from a two night stay at The Dorchester. Service from start to finish was second to none. Staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We ate at The Grill and the food was spectacular. We had breakfast, on both mornings, in our room which was delivered exactly at the time requested and was delicious.
My only criticism of the whole experience is that there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Other than that it is a hard hotel to fault!",5,2016,02,18
130,Just short of perfect but excellent hotel for a family weekend in London,"The decor here is lovely; very elegant throughout. The hotel accommodated us with an 11am check-in. Hotel is somewhat small and easy to get around; most public areas run off the lobby and the spa and gym are on lower level. Very easy to get from your room to the elevator to anywhere in the hotel and we never waited long for one. We had two connected rooms 240 and 241 which had no real view but good interior courtyard light and super quiet and its own walkway between the rooms, which made it feel almost like a 2 bedroom suite. One of the bathrooms was pretty large. Lots of storage areas in the room for clothes and shopping bags. Air conditioning was good and the beds were soft and comfy. Gym was quite decent and there was a trainer in there almost all the time; spa was nice and very white (felt like you died and went to heaven). Food was excellent throughout; breakfast in the promenade, lunch in the bar, dinner in the Grill room -- everything was excellent. Kids enjoyed the children's menu as well as lots of adult food. We enjoyed the nightly live music in the promenade -- different group each of the 3 nights we were there and we appreciated that they reserve it only for hotel residents after 10pm. Concierges work late hours and the bellman remembered us when we came and went. Hotel sent up slippers and robes for the kids.  For some attractions it pays to get flex tickets straight from the concierges (such as the London Eye and Tower of London) that let you skip the lines and the prices are a bit better than those advertised. They sent us the most wonderful chocolate cake in honor of my daughter's 10th birthday (i had to ask for it but they didn't charge for it); it was so good we brought it all the way back to NY with us! The two weaknesses here are that every time we wanted to take a shower or turn on the faucet, you have to wait about 5 full minutes for the hot water to come in (then it's fine); we reported it but i guess it's just old plumbing. Also it's a bit of a walk to the tube station -- Hyde Park is the closest stop about 7 minutes away. Green Park is about 10-12 minutes walk. The Intercontinental or the RItz would put you right on top of these stations respectively. We were attracted to this hotel by the excellent rates and a stay 2, get 3rd night free offer via Amex. I would be inclined to return, but we might prefer a hotel that was closer to the metro.",5,2016,02,16
130,Great Hotel at a great location,"We stayed there for a Valentine's weekend. The hotel was packed.
The rooms are big and great.
The service is perfect
Food everywhere in the hotel lobby and restaurants is also very good
Great value for money.
Only con to the management is that its almost impossible for the hotel guest to get a table to afternoon tea at weekend and that's should be fixed.
",5,2016,02,16
130,A Birthday Treat to Remember!,"I stayed here with my wife as it was her birthday and she's always wanted to. It was definitely a treat for us to stay at a hotel of this quality (and expense!). But we weren't disappointed!

It was stunning. Everything from the time we arrived to the time we left in the morning, the only negative was that we couldn't afford to stay another night!

The room was incredible...so elegant and every small detail was immaculate.

They knew it was my wifes birthday and had left a cake in the room which was a lovely touch.

It's in a great location and would highly recommend staying here to anyone.

For us it was pretty much a once in a lifetime experience, and one we will never forget.

Thanks Dorchester!!",5,2016,02,15
130,Felt like a princess in this iconic old world hotel,"We travelled to London to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary and the Dorchester did not disappoint. Upon entering what seems an unassuming building from the front (apart from the line of super luxury vehicles out front), you are wowed by the stretch of beautiful flowers, draperies and furnishings that line the gallery eating area behind. Both reception (Emma) and the concierge (?George) went that extra mile in assisting my husband to locate his wallet left in the limousine that brought us there and settling me with tea and comfort whilst this was done. Super friendly service everywhere and lovely handmade cakes and champagne in the room to mark the occasion. Afternoon tea with champagne was memorable, comfy old world room & bathroom...my only regret was in leaving. One of my top hotels in the world, expensive but both memorable and rewarding",5,2016,02,15
130,A wonderful 5 star valentines special weekend,"We stayed for Valentine weekend, we arrived on Saturday to wonderful polite,kind and helpful staff upon arrival, our room wasn't ready but that was our fault as we arrived earlier than expected, so we sat in the lovely bar and had a few cocktails, about an hour later a lovely member of staff told us our room was now ready, WOW were our thoughts when we walked into our room we were not disappointed at all fantastic large room very clean and tidy too, we have stayed at many 5 star top London hotels before but never here only for afternoon tea a few times, well we shall definitely be staying here again have to say this is our favourite London hotel now, breakfast brought to our room was delicious and very luxurious, thank to the hotel for making it a very special weekend for us, can't wait to come back soon :) you should be very proud of your staff and you definitely know how to run a wonderful 5 star hotel extremely well.",5,2016,02,15
130,So disappointing,"Went here for dinner recently after looking forward to it for weeks and was so disappointed. 

The service was just terrible. We felt ignored and second class. The food was practically none existant as well. 

Won't be returning. We had a much better time in the savoy ",1,2016,02,13
130,Dinner,"We had a lovely treat of dinner at this wonderful hotel and restaurant as part of our Christmas and New Year celebrations.
Cannot recommend it more highly, wonderful food with excellent service.
Beautifully made cocktails in The Champayne bar!
The Gingerbread model of the actual hotel was pretty impressive too!",5,2016,02,11
130,Best in london ,This one's an old classic. Typically English hotel with Art Deco. Great food and the best bar with the yummiest cocktails. The location is spectacular right off Hyde park. Always have the best time here and I still keep coming back to this property. ,5,2016,02,10
130,Beautiful,"We arrived very early morning tired from an oversees flight and were so delighted to be checked into our room immediately. The room was beautiful and bathroom was as you would expect from a five star hotel. We had a quick refresh before going out and though we were a little disappointed that there was no coffee making facilities, it's amazing how quickly you can forgive, when everything else is so nice. 
Room service breakfast was punctual and although the cooked English was average the croissant was light and flaky and delicious. 
Loved the butterfly wall covering on the fifth floor and the general decor throughout. Stayed at many five stars in London but this may just be my new favourite. Look forward to returning. ",5,2016,02,10
130,Wonderful ,"Have stayed here 3 times now
Lovely welcome very impressed with natalia asst front desk manager who very smoothly changed our room
Prefer traditional can't do with bland beige!!
Breakfast lots of choice and good
Promenade bar excellent barman very good remembered us - hope baby arrives safe and sound!!
Nice to have live music in evening on return from dinner
Lunch at grill very good decorations great especially murano glass
It's all expensive but you feel well looked after
Special thanks to Dave and Richard on door for help in and out of taxis!
Look forward to returning next year ",5,2016,02,09
130,Fabulous birthday treat,"A pre-birthday treat which was wonderful. Fabulous hotel, attentive and welcoming staff. Gorgeous spa, lovely and cosy bar with a great array of cocktails. Room was lovely, my only negative was the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Apart from that we loved every minute and will definitely return.",5,2016,02,09
130,Want luxury treatment? This is the place to stay,"I am fascinated by the traditional decor and manners of these luxury hotels in the UK. The rooms are an experience of their own, the main hall is luxuriously intimate and yet welcoming. And of course, location is key: right in front of the park, steps away from the nicest restaurants, this is, after all, London!",5,2016,02,09
130,Superior Grand Hotel,"A grand dame with a grand reputation - living up to it. 
Wonderful hotel with great staff, excellent service, and superior quality. Rooms are very large with a great bathroom. Finally a tub that can accommodate my 6F4 body. Also the bathrobe was provided in XXL.
Room service and all other facilities we tried are excellent. Will certainly return.
As with many luxury hotels, wifi is free only at a lower speed.",5,2016,02,09
130,certainly exquisite,"This is undoubtedly one of the top hotels in London, and the price is not for the faint of heart.  However, the interiors, the rooms, the amenities, and the service of their extremely professional staff is certainly worth the price.  This is where you want to be seen, if that is your goal.",5,2016,02,08
130,Perfect Hotel for a Weekend in the City,"Stayed here on a complete whim after a long day out in London. We thought it would be a nice treat after shopping and pub hoping and it really lived up to its reputation. The bed was amazing, very spacious with wonderful linens. The bathroom was really spectacular and away from the main room for privacy. We ordered room service for breakfast and the service was spectacular. Amazing Bloody Mary (Which is quite hard to do!) Only downside was that we did not have a great view, our room overlooked an alley but I was very pleased with the rest. Will definitely go back for a longer stay to check out the facilities and restaurant.",5,2016,02,08
130,OUR FAVORITE HOTEL IN THE WORLD,"This was our 5th stay and it was, once again, wonderful. Beautiful room, wonderful linens, great marble bathroom and utter silence--no ambient noise.
The most outstanding facet is the personnel, warm, friendly and competent. Super doormen, concierge, housekeepers, reception, security, etc all of whom made us feel welcome and cared for. Really good food too.
We love this hotel.",5,2016,02,06
130,Our Dream Wedding !!,"This review is for the most important day of our lives and it could not have been more perfect in any way. 
The hotel treated us and our 250 guests like royalty and catered for our every request with finesse. From the staff to the food to the hotel rooms everything was amazing. They say you get what you pay for and with the Dorchester this is 100% true. Thank you Dorchester for making us the happiest couple ever. Would highly recommend staying in one of the suites that overlooks Hyde Park.  A couple of special mentions:
Helen McIntosh - Planned our wedding with complete professionalism.  She was always available, calm and organised.
Chef Uday - The welcome refreshments, the canapes and the dinner service was absolutely impeccable.  The menu choices that were offered to us were adapted to our taste and chef Uday was great at creating unique dishes with the wow factor.  The vegetarian options, the childrens menus, and the various allergen free options were of the same amazing quality. Our flaming creme brule gulab jamuns were the piece de resistance!
Thank you to everyone, from the waiting staff, to the butler, to the welcome guards! 
We couldn't have asked for more Dorchester",5,2016,02,05
130,End of succesful business year and end of year meeting,"My colleague & I had a meeting to set limits for quarter one 2016 so he was bringing his partner so I did same to let them xmas shop whilst we had meeting.  Booked The Dorchester as a luxury treat.  Really not disappointed, fabulous experience, everyone very polite and service exceptional, room was superb.  Yes, top end hotel but very worthwhile albeit your credit card suffers but you really enjoy.  The first evening I met up with my daughter at Le Caprice but second night had dinner with my colleague and partners at the Dorchesters in house 3 star Michelin resturtant.  OMG 4 x taster menus, it was sublime, table booked 6.30 and when we arrived it did not seem busy but that had changed by 7.30 so really pleased we sampled this feast of extravagence.  ""The starter of pink champagne"" set the tone for the girls for the evening adding extra luxurious costs but certainly an evening a stay to remember.",5,2016,01,30
130,Inutile de discuter,"One could argue that there is a better hotel in London but having stayed in quite a few I dont think there is. I usually stay at the Intercontinental as it is close to our head office and to be fair it is a very good hotel. I work from home in Yorkshire Harrogate but have to travel to London once sometimes twice a week. On this occasion I had arranged to meet some people who were staying at the Dorchester so I booked a room for one night. I have to say that my stay was an excellent experience, the service impeccable, the room was large and extremely comfortable, and the food in the restaurant was up there with the best. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants some privacy in relation to business meetings, or just relax …..All in all a first class service, it’s a shame I had only time for one night as I could have done with some much needed pampering. Clearly this has got to be one of the best hotels ive stayed in.",5,2016,01,26
130,Fantastic Experience !!!,What a great property this place is amazing the beds are so comfortable ... The staff is wonderful this is very high quality.. The whole experience was outstanding the location is fantastic and convenient. The food is 5 star ..,5,2016,01,26
130,Dorchester,"Dorchester is a quality hotel which is situated in London and represents high level of service. It meets the requirements of experienced travelers, both for tourism and business trips. It is good for staying in London and feeling the culture.",5,2016,01,24
130,Deservedly one of the strongest brands in London,"From the moment the immaculately dressed, wonderfully friendly door staff welcome you to the professional, efficient and helpful check out, the Dorchester is a fantastic experience.

Of course it is costly but it is one of the most luxurious hotels in London. The facilities are 5 star, the rooms fully equipped and tastefully decorated (we had a Suite) and the staff are world class.

Fully recommended",5,2016,01,21
130,In a class of its own! Exhilarating experience!,"I stayed at the Dorchester Hotel, Park lane for one night and cannot explain how amazing this experience was. Right from the moment you step into the hotel you are treated like royalty. We got upgraded to the executive room thanks to Michelle Sangil! The room was huge! The bathroom was just so beautiful. Had a bath tub and a separate shower space. Everything was just so luxurious in the room. Also included is a Bang and Olufsen TV which I found pretty cool. Service was impeccable. Attention to detail at its finest. We also checked out the spa- really liked it. 

Breakfast was out of this world. Served in fine cutlery and excellent service. It was just extraordinary. 

I would like to thank Michelle Sangil for such a lovely gesture for upgrading us. Thank you Dorchester!",5,2016,01,17
130,Great hotel.,We stayed for 1 night for a Birthday treat. The Hotel and staff are fabulous. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is wonderful. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. This is the 3rd time we have stayed here and wouldn't hesitate to return.,5,2016,01,17
130,Luxury Christmas present,"We stayed one night, our Christmas treat, in this prestigious hotel.  Our room was lovely, tastefully decorated, comfy kingside bed and quality accessories.  The staff were very professional and accommodating.  The promenade is very impressive as is the 'gingerbread' hotel which is a beautiful 'dolls house' at the beginning of the promenade.
Our visit was marred by an unfortunate accident involving a doorstop on the floor which was placed right in front of the toilet.  My husband stubbed his toe which turned black overnight with the possibility of it being broken or fractured!  The duty manager was very apologetic, we brought it to their attention in order that they could change the positioning of the doorstop so that it couldn't happen again to somebody else.  We hope they have heeded our complaint.",4,2016,01,05
130,Classy - Elegant - Total perfection!,"What an unbelievable experience!  My husband treated me to three nights at this beautiful hotel right after Christmas and from the minute we set foot in the door, everything was absolutely, totally, perfect.  

We have traveled a great deal and stayed in many ""five star"" hotels but none even come close to the service experienced here.  From the woman who checked us in, to the concierge, to the housekeeping staff and all the servers in the restaurants, they were all outstanding, pleasant, and unbelievably helpful.  It is clear that everyone working there loves being there which creates a perfect environment for the guests.  

In addition to the spectacular service, our room was out of this world.  We got an upgrade to a huge room and everything about it was perfect.  

I can't say enough good things about this hotel, their service, and the location.  It absolutely deserves the rating of the #1 hotel in London.  We can't wait to return!",5,2016,01,04
130,New Year at the Dorchester!,"After a busy family Christmas we wanted a restful break at our favourite hotel. From the moment we handed the car over we switched into spoilt mode. I had made a gingerbread house for my grandchildren but I only wish they had been with us to view the Dorchester showpiece. Just sensational.

 Our suite was spacious with the most comfortable bed. The champagne and fruit was a lovely touch!
. 
New Years Eve in the Promenade lounge was perfect for us. I was a bit doubtful about eating outside of the Grill on that evening but it really worked . Great cocktails, a super 3 course meal served in style, dancing and more cocktails. There was a fun natural ambience with other guests and staff. Eclectic yes and I felt very privileged to be part of it.

The Grill is a work in process for me. We dined there on our second evening. The food was good and service is faultless but at the moment it just lacks that joie de vivre to bring it to life. Maybe trying too hard but how can that be a fault. 

I hope we'll be back next year with the family. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well.",5,2016,01,04
130,London Classic,"It’s always a challenge for classic hotels to showcase their rich history and architecture, while still attempting to give guests a modern feel. Bravo to the Dorchester as they appear to pull this off with ease.  The lobby was already decked out for Christmas and it was spectacular. The lobby itself was very warm with cozy seating and just provides the first glimpse of the old school elegance throughout the hotel.  I’ve been in older hotels that seem a little dated with the décor.  The Dorchester didn’t have that dated feel to me.   

The room was fairly spacious with modern amenities.  There was no small coffee maker so if you’re looking for a quick cup of tea I imagine room service is an option. That’s about all I noticed as far as what I would find in a Mandarin or W.  The bathroom was wall to wall marble, but with an updated shower that was fantastic.  Bedding was great.

The staff was excellent.  The room was super clean and the front desk staff was always available to assist.  I love staying up by Hyde Park as it’s close to many tourist things and in this case a conference for me at the Marble Arch. 

I read a particular spy novel author that seems to have characters meet at the Dorchester whenever they’re in London.  It’s very cool to be in the hotel while reading one of those stories.  

I will definitely return to the Dorchester on future visits to London.",5,2016,01,03
130,I'm still here on Christmas Day,"My dream has always been to celebrate Christmas in the city of Dickens. My second dream has always been to stay at The Dorchester Hotel. Well, let me start by saying Londoners love Christmas and the Holidays. Everyone has a smile and a ""Merry Christmas"" on their lips! Though the weather outside was frightful, the atmosphere inside The Dorchester was so delightful. This hotel lives up to it's name as one of ""The Best Hotels in the World"" 5 stars all the way. From when first you arrive and throughout our stay, which unfortunately ends tomorrow, the staff has shown such wonderful kindness and friendliness, that we felt like Royalty, or at least  A-list pop stars. I rarely write reviews for anything. But this wonderful place deserves one from a lazy sod like myself. Be sure, that we will return year after year. Thank you Dorchester for the best Christmas ever!",5,2015,12,25
130,Classy!,"Love this hotel. Stayed many times for business and pleasure. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner many times - all great experiences. The rooms are very nice also. There are couple of bars inside the hotel which makes drinking to another level. You will feel like a king and queen when you stay in this hotel. Well worth it!",5,2015,12,24
130,I want to move in!,"A lovely friendly welcome, on this, my second visit and to my great joy I was upgraded to a bigger room with a king bed, recently refurbished. Staff attentive, helpful, friendly; I can find no fault. Service impeccable. The little mince pies served with tea and coffee were tasty, and when I asked if I could take the remaining two to my room, I was instead presented with a BOX of them! It is especially nice to have the mountains of shopping taken up to my room after decanting from the taxi. Coming back next Christmas!",5,2015,12,17
130,One of my Favourite Hotels,I joined my husband here for the Saturday night of his two night stay.  As I didn't check in I felt that I didn't make a connection with the staff but their courtesy and efficiency were still top notch.  We had breakfast at the Grill which I was very disappointed to see had been radicially updated since my last visit 2 years ago. The dining room was beautifully British with heavy plaids and tartans but unfortunately there is nothing to distinguish it from any other 5 star hotel dining room now.  We only ate breakfast which was very good but the waiter did make a mistake taking our order.  We ate at the Alain Ducasse restaurant which was beyond wonderful.  I am reluctant to give it 5 stars as I really miss being able to make a cup of tea in my room.  Come on Dorchester Management just add that finishing touch,4,2015,12,16
130,Wedding! ,"My partner's cousin had a wedding at the Dorchester, naturally I was excited to go. I had already been here for the afternoon tea and dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant (both thoroughly enjoyed). 
The room that the ceremony took place I felt was soulless it didn't have that ""Dorchester"" feel and we could have been anywhere. The room that the champagne reception took place was very nice, although the staff could have been friendlier. The reception room again lacked any personality, the food was just ok. However the staff were great here. To be honest, I wouldn't pay that kind of money to have a wedding here, the rooms have no personality you could have been anywhere. ",4,2015,12,15
130,utterly fabulous,"we booked at this well known hotel, looking forward to great service and quality. we were not disappointed ...!! we were met and greeted by great door staff and reception staff , who asked us to have breakfast whilst our room was prepared (we arrived pretty early in the morning). the staff were fantastic, reassuring us and generally welcoming us into the fantastic hotel. the room was terrific, food terrific, evening bar, fabulous atmosphere and we are looking forward to returning. (if we are lucky enough)... more than 5 stars..!!!",5,2015,12,15
130,absolutely fantastic,"truly fantastic in every way staff fantastic really lives up to its name nothing too much trouble rooms perfect impeccable cleanliness lovely Christmas decorations ,would seriously recommend this hotel .",5,2015,12,15
130,Wonderful stay,"I stayed here recently and had a fabulous time. Its not the type of place i frequent often but the hotel was beautiful, the room i guess had just been renovated and we had views over the park, it lived up to its iconic status. The staff were very friendly and couldn't do more to help.

The only slight annoyance was that when they brought my car back to reception  they bumped my brand new car up the curb and parked on half on the pavement and half in the car park, which as you can imagine i wasn't best pleased.

All in all it was great though.",5,2015,12,15
130,Luxury!,"The Dorchester lives up to its reputation in every way. Great service, lovely surroundings and in the heart of London. It's not cheap but sometimes you have to splash out! The food in China tangs is excellent.",5,2015,12,11
130,Charmingly traditional,"It is a traditional hotel and as long as this is your expectation you wont be disappointed. It is luxurious, the bedrooms are a bit small with a surprisingly spacious bathroom but all very clean and perfect in its own way. My husband and i stayed for a weekend and it is a wonderful setting for a romantic weekend with lovely service. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the breakfast was delicious but more importantly the coffee was hot and steaming just the way we like it!!",4,2015,12,05
130,Great service and attention to detail,"There are certainly more modern hotels and ones with better views, but as far as service is concerned, attention to detail and trying to meet your every need this hotel is simply superb. I stayed here after a draining trip to the US on my way back to South Africa. It felt like reaching an oasis in the desert once I arrived. Restaurant options are excellent. Very good for business meetings. Will be back if I get the opportunity. ",5,2015,12,04
130,Great stay,"Checked in with a lowly Irish gentleman called Kieron who was very charming and gave us a tour of the hotel before arriving in our suite. We had a newly refurbished suite which was beautiful. Other friend was upgraded to the belgravia suite however not refurbished and very much needed to be. 
Hotel is lovely and enjoyed the bar with some great cocktails. 
The Dorchester is reassuringly 5 star and wouldn't hesitate to add this to our list of home from homes.",5,2015,11,29
130,Very courteous staff ,"I was at the Dorchester for a special dinner as it was my wedding anniversary. Ambience was very nice, food was great without a doubt but what impressed me the most was the excellent service delivered by their staff. They are very courteous and look after you very well which you don't always see at such big hotels. They also recommended some good desert options.",5,2015,11,28
130,Amazing-not so!,"For many years  I had fantasised about staying at The Dorchester so when the opportunity arose I jumped at it. Needless  to say, as one of the great British institutions, it's a lovely hotel however it is not fabulous.   It has two lovely dining areas /restaurants albeit pricey. 
 I was extremely disappointed by the rooms!  The corridors were creaky and narrow and the rooms pokey. There's no doubt it was tasteful decorated, however I was noisy -if the internal door wasn't shut and space was tight with a capital T. The double bed was very compact for 2, there was hardly any space to walk around it! Very claustrophobic! On a positive note the bathroom was spacious with delicious toiletries and good high pressure hot showers - and it you are a lover of hotel slippers- this one was good quality. 
All in all - charming but not worth the price or reputation- that is in the standard rooms. 
A word of advise- don't take your car!",3,2015,11,28
130,Four days in London,We checked into the Dorchester the first week in November for a short stay in London. Beautiful hotel with truly outstanding staff at every level. Made us feel comfortable even though we didn't arrive in an Aston Martin. Front desk staff and concierge desk especially helpful. We had requested on our reservation a recently re-done room. Instead we were graciously upgraded to a suite due to our travel agents status. Thought was good but result not so good. The suite was very spacious but in the back overlooking the a/c equipment and very dated. We would have preferred the smaller updated room and I believe should have been asked. The lighting in the suite was so dim it was next to impossible to read anywhere. In addition due to local ordinance there was no place to operate a hair dryer or curling iron in the bathroom. My wife made do in the bedroom with the equipment on the floor and unable to see a mirror. If the curling iron needs to be in a space other than the bathroom there needs to be a desk and outlet for hair and makeup use. In a hotel of this caliber it was a glaring fault. We will definitely return but would not stay in anything other than a redone room and request a park view.,4,2015,11,26
130,The discreet charm of luxury,"Staying at the Dorchester is a wonderful experience, it is unquestionably a fantastic hotel. Great location, excellent service and posh restaurants. I love the afternoon in-room fruit selection. I also like the size of the bathroom although I missed the flat screen tv there. I think the gym is too tiny and not really well-equipped.",5,2015,11,22
130,One of the iconic hotels in uk,"From the revolving doors to the lobby and the rooms .....two words, classic luxury 
we were greeted politely and ushered to the reception,the ambiance and tidiness of the lobby speaks for itself.
The rooms are what you can call traditional the restaurant is very nice,well litted cocooned in soft background classical music.
The food? well nothing special i'll say more of what to expect",5,2015,11,21
130,Every aspect of this hotel is excellent,"We stayed for a weekend, excellent location for shopping, and convenient for theatres. 

Difficult to find fault in any aspect of the hotel, from check in to check out we found the whole experience excellent. Staff are very professional, helpful, and polite. Bar and restaurant excellent, room service fast, accurate, hot.",5,2015,11,20
130,A fantastic weekend.,Recently we stayed at the savoy and had the most fantastic stay we hoped we could say the same about the dorchester and the answer is yes yes yes. Another amazing experience that we could not fault. From time of arrival  to departure we were treated like stars. Every thing was a delight. Oh my goodness the food amazing rooms beautiful and the breakfast what can I say iam still dreaming about thr crossiants and I love the way they serve you at the table with your amazing breakfast. The floral displays were so beautifully arranged I just wish we could have stayed longer but one thing is for sure we will be back a amazing experience and fabulous staff they could not do enough for you so friendly and polite ab fab x,5,2015,11,18
130,My experience,"Trip advisor is the best ever trip maker . I am fully satisfied from the services of them it is a nice hotel and had a best experience of London . it is my promises that I will make my every trip with "" trip advisor "" and would like to advice others to make their trip with ""trip advisor""",5,2015,11,17
130,Good but not great,"We travel to London often and thought we should try a different hotel from out usual few. Though the hotel was nice, I would not choose to stay here again upon our return.  The hotel is nice, and it had plusses and minuses.  That being said, I have stayed in other hotels without the minuses.
Plusses:  service was enthusiastic and attentive; restaurants were very good, especially The Grill; concierges were very effective and happy to help; breakfast was very good.
Minuses:  internet was so slow that a business traveler is incapable of doing work (hotel acknowledged this problem, said they were working on the problem, were to bring a booster, but never followed through); the internet is twenty-years-ago slow not only in the rooms but also in the public areas; the location is not ideal, central but not really in any neighborhood, so one must walk a lot to get to shopping or attractions; housekeeping was not great (I dried my hair in the hallway where the hairdryer sat in the floor for two nights before anyone picked it up.  I thought I would see how long it would take!); the decor is old fashioned and tired (peeling wallpaper and buckled carpets in our suite). 
I could go on and on, but I feel that the great service of this hotel can't overcome its weaknesses.",4,2015,11,15
130,Understated class,Had a weekend away from the kids and enjoyed the understate class of one of the best hotels in London. We ate and drank at the hotel too as there did not seem to be any need to leave the sanctuary and luxury. Get a room up as high as possible for the view. ,4,2015,11,15
130,Little things mean a lot,"One of a handful of 'grande dame' hotels worldwide. Pick any number of superlatives and they would all be appropriate in describing this hotel,
However it is the little things that make this the first among equals. We decided to drive down on this occasion and upon arrival the car was whisked away within seconds and the congestion charge attended to. All with a minimum of fuss.
Inside the ratio of staff to guests must be one of highest we've experienced...all going about their business quietly and efficiently, addressing their guests by name.... from the man fluffing up cushions as guests leave to a colleague cleaning table tops with bacterial spray as they become vacant.
The luxury and opulence is well known and documented but it is the little things that set it aside from it's contemporaries.",5,2015,11,15
130,Amazing hotel ,As soon as you walk into the hotel lobby you see the beautifully decorated flowers and you know you are in the right hotel. The service is always friendly and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The dining options are great with lovely afternoon tea and even chinese food. I would love to return again.,5,2015,11,14
130,"Wonderful experience, lovely hotel.","My husband and I stayed here for one night on my 30th birthday and it was a wonderful experience. As soon as we got to the hotel the doormen greeted us and took our luggage, he was very friendly and showed us to reception. The receptionist was excellent and arranged a table at The Grill at The Dorchester for us and showed us to our room.

The room itself was a standard room but lovely with a very traditional style. The bed was huge and so comfortable, the pillows were amazing. The bath was like a pool it was so big and filled very quick so no hanging around. Although I would say that having stayed in other 5 star hotels there are a couple of improvements to be made however non are essentials, one thing is that there was no facility to make a coffee or tea in the room, nowadays most rooms have a nespresso machine or equivalent however this was not available and I would also say that a TV in the bathroom would be nice as it currently has sound in the bathroom but not an actual TV.

The turndown service was nice, they even left small bottles of water by each side of the bed, which we thought was a nice touch.

Breakfast was included in the room package and was served in The Grill restaurant, we didn't want a big breakfast as we had a lunch reservation later in the day, so we both had eggs benedict with ham which was delicious, when the eggs are served they look hard boiled but they are actually poached so when you chop into the egg the yolk flows out and was perfect, the fresh juice was also lovely. As it was my birthday my husband organised a glass of champagne which was nice. The waiter was very attentive and even gave me a fruit plate with 'Happy Birthday' which was nice. I only have one criticism of breakfast and that is that it wasn't clear from the menu what you could have when the breakfast is included in the room rate, we should have asked but didn't, however what we had was included except our champagne but obviously that was our choice.

All in all a very positive stay in a classic hotel. All the staff were fantastic and I thank them all for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,11,09
130,Outstanding in every way,"We've just returned from a week in London and stayed at the Dorchester.  This past June my husband and I had stayed at the Dorchester's Hotel Eden in Rome, loved it, and chose this property based on our wonderful experience there.  In fact I will be in Rome this June with my kids and was so disappointed that The Eden has closed for a year long renovation.  My loss.  This hotel is located across from Hyde Park in Mayfair -- a fantastic home base just minutes from Buckingham Palace and easy walks (we love to walk) to museums, shopping, and restaurants.  

Our son joined us for three nights so we had booked a suite to accommodate the three of us.  The hotel upgraded us but upon check in I was still concerned about the space -- they were extremely helpful and found another, larger suite (the Mayfair) and we were thrilled beyond measure.  Plenty of space for the three of us (our son is college aged).   This is a hotel that wants each guest to be happy.  We found the room's appointments to be lovely, and housekeeping was extremely attentive.  Fresh fruit was replaced each day as well as bottled water and coffee pods.  A daily newspaper was waiting each morning when we opened our door.  

We were fortunate to have been able to enjoy each of the hotel's restaurants.  Alain Ducasse is an outstanding dining experience and should not be missed.  The Grille was very elegant and our choice before theatre several nights - it opens at 5:30 which is perfect for an early dinner before a show.  China Tang is family friendly, tasty, and the service there is on a par with the hotel.  We enjoyed the people watching while breakfasting in the Promenade each morning.  The flowers in the Promenade, by the way, are the most stunning I've seen in a hotel in a long time.  

Service is what really sets this hotel apart.  It is a very busy property, yet we never felt overlooked in any way.  The concierges helped us make some fantastic dinner reservations (resulting in some truly memorable meals) within and outside of the hotel.  Guests are warmly greeted each time they walk through the doors.  Staff in the promenade remember you -- by day three we didn't need to repeat our room number and even our beverage choices were recalled.  That's particularly impressive with the large number of guests staying here.  

London is expensive, and visitors have a large number of choices for hotels.  We felt The Dorchester was a wonderful choice for us.  We will be staying at the hotel group's Paris property, Le Meurice, in July and based on this experience are already looking forward to that visit.",5,2015,11,06
130,A wonderful stay in a lovely hotel,"We stayed here on business and must say that the hotel is beautiful, the staff are excellent and the service impeccable.
The room was large and very comfortable, the food in the restaurant amazing.
We would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants privacy, first class service, and a little pampering
",5,2015,11,03
130,Fantastic Birthday treat!,"My husband booked me a surprise stay at the Dorchester for my birthday this year - what a lovely place to stay! We were given a fabulous room (321), served some excellent food and drink and treated to some fantastic service by the friendly, efficient and ever smiling staff. As part of my surprise I had some treatments in the spa which were lovely - unhurried treatments given by polished and professional staff in tranquil surroundings. All in all this was a great birthday treat - topped off by the delivery of a surprise Dorchester birthday cake by a singing waiter - marvellous! Thank you to all for making my birthday this year!",5,2015,11,03
130,Wedding reception 'out of this world' ,"I cannot put into words how sensational this hotel is,the very finest of everything,utter perfection!!!! Everything from the flower arrangements as you enter, to the delicious food and drinks, service is impeccable and everything is designed to make you feel both comfortable and special at the same time. Every time I come here I leave feeling wonderful!",5,2015,11,02
130,Lovely stay in classic luxury,"We arrived early and knew we would need to leave our luggage until later but everything was straightforward and easy.  Having left everything with reception and concierge we returned to find it all placed in our room for us. The room was both spacious and comfortable and nothing was too much trouble for staff. My only comment would be that the moulded bath panels are now looking very out of keeping with everything else.  They may be traditional but they now look old and dated against all other fittings, even when the overall feel is ""classic"".
Breakfast was also excellent.  We chose to take it in The Promenade, which is very relaxed and leisurely.  The choice available to you for every aspect is everything that you would expect from this hotel.
The only concern for me is that the staff show such concern over some of the most bizarre, immaterial, inane and downright bizarre things that you can only imagine how high-maintenance and ridiculous some of their clientele must be.",5,2015,11,02
130,Still one of London's finest,"It had been a couple of years since we last stayed here.
I'm pleased to say that nothing has changed, it retains its position of one of London's finest. The Deluxe King Room is 49m2, more than spacious enough for us in a king sized bed, as well as our daughter in a roll-away bed, and still room for a desk with chair and two sitting room chairs, and with a view over Hyde Park or the city. The room decor and furnishings are opulent, the bedding luxurious, and while the white marble bathrooms are a bit dated this doesn't detract from the feeling of luxurious comfort. With London hotel prices being what they are, it does not cost a great deal more than hotels that are considerably inferior. The free Wi-Fi is only just adequate - the speed could certainly be improved.
The concierge service is the best- the staff have been here for years, all British to the core, no eastern european migrants here, if its tickets to a show you need or restaurant bookings, there's a very good chance that they can get it for you-it would be a brave establishment to deny a request from a Dorchester Concierge.
If you want to eat at the 3 Michellin Star Restaurant Alain Ducasse you will need to book well in advance, it was regrettable but understandable we couldn't get in at short notice.",5,2015,11,01
130,Pillow Fluffers,"That's right, pillow fluffers. The level of attention to detail at this hotel can be illustrated by the meticulously fluffed pillows (photos attached). 
 
Though I’d heard of the Dorchester, I wasn’t sure given the (let’s face it) unattractive exterior of the building and photos of room décor that looked a bit traditional. I was traveling with my mother and we were celebrating the good fortune of getting ballot tickets to the Wimbledon final on the same year as a milestone birthday for her, so I wanted it to be special. It was. 
 
Our experience was made more memorable by the attentive staff and the fact that it was, as they say, difficult to fault on the whole. One time, the front desk literally anticipated my request before I could ask and I was definitely impressed by the effort to be accommodating. Other positives: the room was very clean and complete with all the lovely touches such as fresh fruit and flowers, loved the built-in electrical sockets for American electronics, and a huge marble bathroom stocked with a BaByliss hair dryer.  
 
The afternoon tea was in a lovely setting as were the breakfasts, and they were willing to accommodate and customize menu options. And the flower arrangements were truly extraordinary and a beautiful and fragrant backdrop to meals in The Promenade. The location is fantastic overall but since I was with my mother, I noticed that it was not as close to the tube stops as other hotels in the Mayfair region – still great. 
 
Things that could have been better but were overshadowed by the otherwise positive experience: had some issues with wifi connectivity and once connected, it was slow; room service was unusually spendy but nice presentation; and the front doormen could be a bit more welcoming. 

Overall highly recommended and the type of stay that seems even better with time and the recollection of special memories--and by comparison with other hotel experiences.",5,2015,10,31
130,Room size,"Stayed here for 1 nights for my partners birthday. The service and hotel is without a double nice. However, I had booked a standard room and the size was pretty cramped including a modest bathroom. Perhaps if you spend a lot of money you will probably get more space. Not sure if its worth the money",3,2015,10,29
130,Lovely stay.,"We have traveled to London several times, and this was our first stay at the Dorchester.  After years of dining at China Tang, having tea in the Promenade, and drinks in the Dorchester Bar, we were eager to stay here.

We weren't disappointed.  The check-in/check-out staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  The room was beyond spacious - which surprised us, being as London's hotel rooms aren't always large.  The bathroom was gorgeous.
I also enjoyed the closets - they had built-in drawers, motion-sensor lights, and lots of shoe storage.

We love to partake in room service, and this was really where the Dorchester shined.  The china they use is precious, and every detail was considered.  We tried the Japanese breakfast as well one morning, and it was delicious.

My personal favorite has always been tea in the Promenade, and continues to be.  The ambiance is beautiful, serene and classy.  I will always have tea service here any time I am in London.
We also enjoy the Bar - the manager always remembers us, and the drinks are divine.

We dined at Alain Ducasse this time.  It was very good - although the staff had somehow gotten confused that I had a dairy allergy, which I don't.  After correcting them several times, they continued to bring me separate dishes that were dairy-free.  I wouldn't consider this a problem necessarily, but some people might find that a turn-off.

I don't think you can really go wrong with staying at the Dorchester.  Which is why I am rating them 5 stars.
However, we were celebrating a birthday, as well as our engagement, and it would have been nice to receive extra recognition for this.  (Alain Ducasse gave us a dessert).  Perhaps a bottle of champagne in the room...?  Or even the staff wishing us well would have gone a long way.

But again, our stay was lovely, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",5,2015,10,29
130,Sublime,Absolutely dreamy. Spacious rooms. Large bathrooms. High ceilings. Lovely décor. Grand salon. Professional service staff. Excellent room service. Perfect location. Beautifully British. I shall return again and again!,5,2015,10,29
130,If Prince William chose to have his engagement party here then what else needs to be said,"Everything about this hotel is just luxurious and perfect. From the minute one arrives at the hotel, the feeling of not just being a guest but a very special guest is immediately evident. The rooms all have different names with different decor. The spa is heavenly. Afternoon tea with cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey whilst sitting next to a Sheik or another world famous person really makes being there almost feel surreal. The location right on Hyde Park couldn't be better. Everything about this hotel, down to the finest detail, is just immaculate.",5,2015,10,28
130,Visited friends Staying at the Hotel and had Drinks,"Very beautiful hotel, friends were in a 2 bedroom Suite with a living room as they were working for the NFL game.   Absolutely stunning.   The Lobby is fabulous and we had a champagne toast the morning we left for the NFL game.   Go Jaguars!!",5,2015,10,27
130,Lovely Place To Go,"It has been some time since I went to this hotel, but I returned recently for a work event and it was just as lovely as I remembered it.

The food is really quite special, the rooms are nice and clean, well decorated, 'old' but not tatty. 

The location is fantastic - close to many attractions.

The staff were friendly, not exceptional, but friendly enough.

A good experience.",4,2015,10,27
130,An excellent stay,"This was our first stay at the Dorchester, and we weren't really sure what to expect. When you arrive outside you are greeted by an array of some the world's most expensive cars and wonder how someone arriving on foot from the local tube station might be welcomed.
I am delighted to report that the receptionist's treat everyone with the same courtesy and friendly smile. Our room was ready early (2pm) and suitably grand on the 5th floor. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, and for a London hotel the view of a small courtyard was nice.
The hotel decor is very traditional and a bit pink for us, but everywhere is clean and everything works well. 
The Dorchester is an oasis of calm with nothing too much trouble and therefore if you want a treat (for most of us they're not everyday prices) then we'd thoroughly recommend The Dorchester.",5,2015,10,26
130,best hotel in london,"Just love this place,food amazing,just sheer luxury .having travelled all over the world I think this is my favorite,attention to details outstanding,it just oozes class,always made to feel welcome,normally have suite when on business.its fab,thanks for all my stays,just love it",5,2015,10,22
130,Fantastic Experience,The entire experience of staying in The Dorchester from start to finish was simply fantastic.  The attention to detail and quality of the setting was a given and the customer service from the team was beyond excellent.  It was worth every penny to stay in one of the world's most iconic hotels.  ,5,2015,10,21
130,Luxury and Perfection,"There is literally no place more lovely, more genteel, and with better service than the Dorchester.  Having tea there is an experience in itself and not to be missed.  Rooms are lovely and well appointed, bathrooms gorgeous.  The staff is the absolute best.  Even the complimentary bath and shower gels are fantastic.",5,2015,10,20
130,post rugby destress,"The Dorchester has to be my favourite hotel in the world, the level of professionalism, care, attention to detail, and sheer luxury is second to none
the room which was upgraded immediately as we have stayed before was luxurious to say the least",5,2015,10,19
130,A fabulous stay once again,"Our second visit to The Dorchester this year and how wonderful it was yet again.

The customer service just gets better and better. We were made to feel 'at home' almost immediately. 

Everything was perfect and if you haven't been you are missing what we believe is one of the best London hotels.

We will be back.

130,Comfortable ,"Nice hotel, rooms are big with marble bathroom. Well located in the center a lot of restaurants around. Friendly staff that helps you with everything but the gym is very bad, old and small. It's not the best hotel but it's very charming and cozy. ",4,2015,10,18
130,Comfortable ,"Very nice hotel, staff cannot do enough to please. Comfortable homely feel. Would highly recommend. Food is great too. 

Over road from Hyde Park Corner. 

On site spa facilities. 

Concierge go out of their way to book you into where ever you wish to go.

130,A truly grand hotel,"I have stayed at the Dorchester numerous times during the years but not recently. I do know that it deserves a review.  Fine customized service. Excellent Mayfair ovation on Park Lane. Excellent rooms, services and fascilities. The bar is excellent but I liked the old decor and style.  Tge new setting is a bit too modern and gaudy.  The promenade is beautiful for light meals, high tea and drinks. I have bumped into tge late Michael Jackson with his mother in the club, Lionel Richie in the elevator on his way to check out with him toting his bag. Michael Jackson was wearing his famous red jacket.  He was friendly and even told my wife and I that we'd enjoy our night at the Club.  China Tang restaurant is excellent with a nice bar.  Highly recommended",5,2015,10,15
130,Heavenly!,"Stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. What can I say? Could not fault one thing or aspect of our stay. The rooms are fabulous, the ambience is amazing and all those little details you would expect are out of this world.

If you are considering this hotel- consider no more.  We look forward to returning in the very near future.

",5,2015,10,14
130,BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"Ah, what an amazing experience. Stayed here before (and written a review in the past) however my stay here was even better this time. 

First of all, the rooms have been updated and are now nice and modern but still traditional looking, just pure luxury. The beds are super comfortable! The room and bathroom space is large, and I believe I stayed in one the cheaper rooms so I can't even imagine the size of the bigger rooms. 

The food at the hotel is lovely and lovely cocktails too. It's all so posh and wonderful, a real treat. Breakfast was wonderful and the service we got was top notch. Morning staff a little friendlier than evening staff (perhaps they were tired) but all generally very respectful and helpful. 

What shocked me the most was the concierge service. It felt like there was nothing I could ask for that they couldn't provide. Attended a wedding at the hotel and had a wardrobe malfunction, the hotel arranged to send my dress to the tailors nearby at 9am on a Saturday and dress was back in my room before 11:30am. I also wanted to post a parcel to Dubai via DHL but the post office was closed on a Sunday and I had to travel the next morning. The concierge asked me to leave the parcel with them and they would sort out for me. Great great service. 

Cannot wait till my next stay. 

Pure luxury.",5,2015,10,14
130,a very well run Empire,We are at the Dorchester now and have a very quiet nice Deanery Suite with a large marble bathroom and a spacious living room onto a court.Impeccable service as you expect in such a place . The location is very central and the Concierge service outstanding.Lots of Restaurants withing walking distance but also lots of choices inhouse when you come home after walking the whole day at Frieze Art ! I also like that there is a hairdresser inhouse .We have tried many Hotels in London this is the one that works for us !I love the flowers in the lobby !,5,2015,10,14
130,spectacular,"Rooms and public spaces are beautiful but the real beauty is the attentiveness and dedication of the staff. Thoroughly delightful experience which was worth the expense. Central location is a great benefit.
      ",5,2015,10,13
130,Home from home ,"When ever possible I try to stay at the DC hotels. I've stayed in 3 different DC hotels. Dorchester is the finest hotel. With plenty of history. I've stayed there a few times. The staff can't do enough for you. The food is excellent , the location is good.",5,2015,10,13
130,It's not Classic; It's Just Old,"The Dorchester is not horrible, but there are so many better luxury hotels in London now.  

Most of the hotels by Firmdale group (like the Soho Hotel and the Ham Yard Hotel), the Rosewood Hotel, and the Corinthia Hotel are all on a completely different level of modern luxury. 

I stayed one night in a Studio Suite at the Dorchester and left.  It's simply not my taste (which is to say that I have taste). I love great design, including modern interpretations of class concepts and many contemporary hotel.  I do not like to see decades of makeovers, like layering more and more veneer, no matter how nice, on top of what is fundamentally a hotel designed for another era.

In simple terms, hotel design has changed (rapidly over the past decade), and it has left this hotel (like its cousins living off their legacy reputation) in a structurally impossible position.  There's simply no way to change the room layouts or the design of common amenities for modern times.  

For example, bathrooms in luxury hotels today typically have a separate toilet room, and bathrooms tend to be much larger than they were long ago.  But that's not the case at the Dorchester, where even the Studio Suite had a toilet and bidet lined up between the tub and the sinks.

Another example is spa allocated to a gym.  If you are looking for a great gym at a hotel, don't look to the Dorchester.  The ""fitness center"" is a tiny little hole of a room in the deepest recess of the basement of the hotel.  I guess people of the age of their target customers don't work out.

And lastly, i'll comment about a tiny little detail that tells you just how old this property is.  When walking down the hallways, every floorboard squeaks.  And in my room, it was same squeak squeak. ",2,2015,10,10
130,Simply excellent,"We stayed here for four nights recently and I must say that it was worth every penny (or pound). Firstly, I had emailed the hotel for instructions on how to get there from Heathrow and received a detailed reply very promptly.
When we got there, the staff that checked us in was very warm and friendly. The room we stayed in had a super king-sized bed which was very comfortable with equally comfortable pillows. There was a fruit platter awaiting us, which was very nice. Everything that you'd want in the bathroom they have it there. We got in late and wanted to go for a bite to eat. The concierge was most helpful, recommended a restaurant that he thinks would still be open at this time and he even called the hotel up to ask if they are full and if we need reservations!
When we went out the following day, we asked for directions and another concierge was on duty and he was equally helpful. Told us that there is a strong chance of rain, and offered us an umbrella which came in very handy!
All in all, we had a lovely stay. To sum it up, it was expensive but certainly worth it; the staff were all very friendly and welcoming and quite genuine, if you know what I mean. Room and amenities wise, cannot fault. Location wise, it's in Park Lane, self-explanatory! The Dorchester gives an air of elegance and class, without being over the top. Wish I can afford to stay here each time I visit London!",5,2015,10,10
130,Superb Luxury!!,"I was visiting London recently and decided to stay at the Dorchester, as I had heard so much about it.  Very centrally located hotel, right in the middle of Park Lane.  I arrived at around 9.00 AM as I landed in London by an early morning flight.  As I approached the hotel, i could see an array of luxury cars like Roll's and Bentley's parked outside.  Than as I moved towards the entrance I was welcomed by a few immaculately suited doormen.  Than I entered the Lobby and was greeted by a charming lady with a big welcoming smile, at the reception.  I signed the check in document and was told that since it was early morning, the room was not quite ready.  She suggested I visit the Spa or go to the Breakfast room for a hearty Dorchester style breakfast. I had already had my breakfast in the flight so i declined but decided to have a cup of tea.  We moved to the big, luxurious hall and I was seated at a table, where I was served tea and cookies, in the perfect fine china teaset.  In about 20 minutes the charming lady returned and told me my room would be ready in an hour's time.  This was fine with me.  I left my luggage with her, and strolled out towards Oxford street which was only a ten minute walk on the right side.  I returned in an hour and was met by her again.  she told me that the room was ready and the luggage had already been moved to my room.  I moved up and reached the room.  It was wow.  from the main lobby i entered the room, and was encountered by small lobby through the bedroom door opened.  there was a closet through this lobby and the bathroom door also opened here.  The room was reasonably sized with a queen sized bed, three chairs, a desk and another closet.  There was a large window with ample sunlight coming in the room.  the decor was very richly done and made you feel like you were in a a royal kind of room.  The bathroom was fairly nice with all amenities.  Overall a great place.  I stayed for about two days and was very comfortable through out.  Next day also had the opportunity to attend a wedding in the ballroom, which was also very grand and nicely done up.  If you want to enjoy sheer luxury, be very centrally located in central London, this is the best place to stay.",5,2015,10,08
130,Very nice but....,"Our two night stay was part of a very special package booked specifically for the World Cup Rugby. We knew we had booked one of the top hotels in London so were aware as with most hotels prices for anything in the hotel would reflect this. We arrived at midday, were greeted warmly and as we expected were advised the room was not ready, however they stored our luggage for us. My first impression of the lobby and the public areas were lots of mirrors. We met our friends who were also staying in the bar and had a drink, 2 small bottled beers and 2 coca colas = £26! 
We went out for lunch, it is in a very nice location and about 8-10 minutes walk either way to Green Park or Marble Arch stations. On our return our rooms were ready and on reaching them, the luggage was there. Ours was a standard room on the 5th floor, no real view out of the window but a bonus was the windows actually open, there is air-con as well. The room itself was very comfortable, traditional decor, nice bathroom, ours had a seperate shower and bath with twin sinks, our friends said their room had a bath only with shower over it.  There are nice toiletries and the towels are lovely, soft and large. The mini bar is best avoided unless you are desperate and really don't mind paying extortionate money for items ie £3.50 for a small bag of Tyrells crisps, £6.00 for 500ml bottle of water! Furthermore there are no coffee or tea making facilities in the room which, whilst we respect that maybe most people who stay at the hotel would be happy to use room service, we felt this was a bit poor. Not everyone wishes to wait for a cup of tea to be brought to the room. We have certainly stayed in 5 star hotels in many parts of the world where this was available. The beds are turned down in the evening and we had a small bottle of water left by our beds on the second night but not on the first, little bit inconsistent for a hotel of this standard. Another thing was the WI-Fi, there is one day complimentary standard wifi but not superfast, this has to be paid for, this is really archaic considering most hotels offer it free. Included  in our rate was breakfast which we had in the Grill. The staff were very friendly, helpful and we found efficient. Breakfast has a great choice and certainly plenty of it. We all chose the traditional English breakfast which we all had in a variety of combinations. The one thing we all commented on was how well the poached eggs were cooked and the yolks were some of the yellowest I have ever seen. All very nicely presented with excellent service and certainly very yummy. This was consistent on both mornings. Again when checking out the staff were very friendly and efficient and we were able to leave our bags in storage. Whilst we had a very comfortable stay, I suppose the only thing about the hotel which stood out for us are the staff, certainly very pleasant attentive and friendly. The hotel itself was nice but we were certainly not overwhelmed by it. It was a nice experience but not sure I would stay again.",4,2015,10,05
130,Natural ,As always for many  years the hotel keeps their standards and the service provided is excellence  plus the clean rooms and the nice decoration that makes you feel you are not in a business trip.Also the bartenters are professionals,5,2015,10,03
130,Me and Mum had lovely time staying here ❤️,"We're Regulars to London and we usually visit the Dorchester for dinner however never stayed as usually stay in Claridges or Ritz or in Knightsbridge. This time we stayed here and loved it ❤️ Staff were so lovely and everything from check in to check out was fab x 
We had afternoon tea on the Sunday and on the Saturday ate in Novikov however we still prefer China Tang where we usually eat in your beautiful hotel.
We came on the Saturday for wedding dress trials for me and arrived in the room to champagne and spa treats. Breakfast the next day was lovely too. 
Will be staying again and be back soon in Decemeber xx ",5,2015,10,02
130,The Loveliest,"This place is a large but warm and incredibly inviting place to stay. It seems that every time I have visited it is booked and rooms, alas, aren't ready before check in. Not their fault. I have found that if I want to get in quickly after a very early morning flight I should book an extra night with late check-in.
The room sizes are suitable for us, the food is wonderful and the service is A+",5,2015,10,01
130,Beautiful 5 Star Hotel,"Dorchester Hotel England is the best of the Best . In Service .in  Interior Design ,  Beautiful Fresh Flowers everywhere. The Grill restaurant on the first floor is michellin in everyway . From the first course to the wine to the last course is obsolutely Amazing . The China and Silver wares are topnotch
I would like to congratulate the Hotel . The rooms are fit to Royalties in everyway  Will definitely stay there again next time We go to London",5,2015,09,28
130,Food only...,On this occasion. Big banquet and reception in the ballroom. I have to say out of all the hotel in London the Dorchester does better food and the services feels sharper than the rest. I have stayed here before but sadly not on this occasion. The security is also very good.,4,2015,09,27
130,Dissapointing,"I stayed in the Dorchester twice and both times it was a disappointment. The room is never ready for check in before 3pm, even though I have been told the room will be ""prioritized""' they managed to prepare it at 15.10 only. In the morning I called and asked for cappuccino and croissant in the room, after half hour they still did not appear and when I called I was told I had to wait more. There are queues at check-in.

130,Superb! Service was perfection.,"The company had a lunheon in the ball room.
I entered and ask where to go and although he initially was not aware of the large event of 300 people he waked me to the drinks reception.From start to finish was flawless. The waiters and waitresses all came out together and the table was all served together.
The food was very good and the drinks were well chosen.
Great event.",5,2015,09,20
130,"Extraordinary Service, Elegant Property, Luxurious Rooms","I think I will plan trips to London for nothing other than to stay at the Dorchester, it is simply the absolute best at delivering extraordinary service, comfort, and luxury. Our room was lovely, the bathroom was marble from top to bottom with heated floors, an amazing deep soaking tub and a roomy shower.  The bed and pillows were so comfortable, obviously high quality. We had fresh flowers in each room. The property itself is just gorgeous. The flower arrangements are out of the world! It's worth it to have tea there if you can't stay, it's just beautiful. 

As wonderful as the rooms are, the service is better.  We took a red eye to London, so arrived well before our room would be ready. No problem for the Dorchester. The clerk who checked us in provided us small bags of assorted toiletries and escorted us to the spa, where we were able to shower and freshen up before starting our day. She called us as soon as our room was ready, although we were thoroughly enjoying the sites that the concierge had suggested. The hotel is walking distance to Buckingham Palace and a whole slew of shopping, so we had a lot to occupy our time. We hadn't read about the subway and the need to preorder Oyster cards to avoid paying £5 for the card, so the concierge provided us with a couple of them to use while we were in London, which we returned before we left. It was a nice and unexpected gesture. 

The most valuable aspect of the Dorchester's service occurred after we departed. We discovered at the airport that we'd left our passports in the safe in our room. At the time we discovered this, we had about 40 minutes left to check into our flight and get our baggage on the plane. My husband called the Dorchester, and within minutes, they'd located the passports and found a cab driver to bring them to us at the airport. Given that the ride to Heathrow can take upwards of an hour during heavy traffic, we were very lucky that the cabbie made it to us and we made our flight. There's no way this would have happened with any other hotel, and I've stayed at several 5 star hotels, including Four Seasons. I love the Dorchester and am looking forward to returning one day.

The only little bit of room for improvement would be the wifi service, although the Dorchester exceeds hotels standards here too by providing free wifi. The free wifi is slow, but you can pay for faster downloads, I think the up charge was around £25 per day. I think for the cost of the rooms that the free wifi should be faster, or just add a charge and",5,2015,09,18
130,Very Nice,"It's what you would imagine a stay in London should feel like.  The staff really is wonderful and the rooms are elegant.  The bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable, which you can't always say of even the nicest hotels.  The location to everything is perfect...you can walk or cab or tube anywhere very easy, but you're not stuck in the massive crowds down by Big Ben or the London Eye.

I would stay there again...good work by the Dorchester",5,2015,09,18
130,Magnificent Hotel,"Expensive but you get what you pay for!!! Arrival was brilliantly handled with no fuss or delays. Breakfast was amazing, the service impeccable. Great restaurants to chose from and a great cocktail bar. I cannot think of anything that I was not happy with.

Walking distance from all the sites and of course Harrods etc.",5,2015,09,17
130,Elegant..,"Stayed here last week for a work fam trip - of course the hospitality was heightened but I believe they are a very hospitable hotel anyway so no questions regarding customer service here!
Was placed in a penthouse suite so I really couldn't complain.  It was smaller than I had expected compared to other hotels I have stayed in but it was still lovely.
The room itself is bigger than most 1 bed flats in London so that says a lot about London's rental crisis :)
Had dinner in the Crystal Suite which has a lovely chandelier arrangement.
Had beef that literally melted in my mouth!!  The menu was set for functions and events so cannot really suggest it as I wouldn't think it'd be on the regular menu..?
Breakfast was in the Promenade - egg is egg right but I think I had one of THE best sunny side up eggs in a long time - it was just soooo tasty!  
Mixed up my order a little bit by ordering a full English minus the black & white pudding and sausage... instead I added salmon.
I guess that's no longer an 'English' breakfast..?
I also had a very lovely mango and pineapple freshly squeezed juice...mmmm
The Promenade is very good for people watching, it was definitely interesting to see people from all walks of life..
The fact that I really really think my room had a ghost in it, the hotel is definitely a thumbs up for me.
With the recent refurbishments, mixing classic decor with new furnishings, it does work.
Double thumbs up! :)",5,2015,09,15
130,"""Exceeded EVERY expectation""","""Exceeded EVERY expectation 
Both myself and wife have been to many 5 stars Hotels around the globe, by far The Dorchester Park Lane London  goes beyond all of our expectations.
We have stayed here many times each time we stay our experience of the hotel and the team running the hotel exceed our expectations!
Every member of staff is pleasant they greet you and offer to help at the slightest indication. There is an overall outstanding level of customer care and not one person in the hotel let the team down.
We stayed in the Audbury Roof top suite and it was fabulous, decked out with the most sumptuous furniture and staffed by a team who really did look after our every whim.
I had booked this for my anniversary and they really did make it a special  occasion for us.
We took breakfast in our suite each morning, the ladies and gents from the butler service came and laid it all out for us, it was so beautiful we did not want to leave. The breakfast was cooked to perfection with a fantastic choice delivered on time and in style. The views from our private terraces over London were fantastic this just added to the whole experience.
The little touches, like fresh fruit daily,  chocolates, an anniversary cake and a personal welcome note was just a lovely touch to make you feel that you had arrived in a very special place.
We had made a reservation to eat in  The Dorchester Grill Wow! another outstanding experience. The staff are fantastic, the food is exceptional and an ambience to match. 
I would not hesitate to book The Dorchester especially if you want to surprise your wife or partner. I have to say,  that my wife just had the most wonderful anniversary ever! (She told me so.)
So much so that I have made a promise to my wife that every year on our anniversary we will be celebrating in the Dorchester, we have just celebrated our 36th wedding annivasarry so hopefully, we have a few more left so watch this space for next years review and each year after that.
A special mention and thank you to Mr Alan Palmer who organised the entire stay, for me he could not have done better, thank you, we look forward to seeing you all at The Dorchester soon.",5,2015,09,15
130,So helpful,Last night I was separated from my friends in Hyde Park. I had no handbag or phone and needed to get to Southwark.  The charming door man at the Dorchester came to my rescue when I couldn't get a cab. So helpful and kind. Next trip I will be staying,5,2015,09,14
130,What's not to Love...,"As far as London hotels go this is up in the top five. Amazing location, great views and the service is second to none. You pay a premium for the experience but it's worth it...enjoy the room service; you won't find anything like it again.",5,2015,09,13
130,Grandeur yet intimate - Luxury Decor | Flowers In the Promenade Breathtaking,"Right opposite Hyde park a gorgeous leafy park filled with fillers, trees, pathways, ponds, birds, ducks, people walking their dogs, kids playground, a large pond with boats to hire and paddle boats, large green space, the Princess Diana water memorial within laming dsitance in the park - and then continue walking towards Buckingham Palace.

Arrived by car and valet park. What a delightful welcome from the team out front - which is carried throughout the whole stay. The service and staff must get a special mention because no matter how beautiful and unimaginable beautiful this hotel is it would be soulless without the very staff who make it come alive. 
From the promenade staff, to the bar staff, housekeeping, front desk, bell hops, and the welcome team at the front. 
The room was generous in size with a large bathroom, with a deep superb bath, and generous bathroom products, luxury robes and slippers and even if you wished some exquisite cotton PJ you could purchase boxed in a lovely package.
The bed was large, canopied and divinely soft and comfortable. Decor of the room was so delicate in colors and a large lounging chair and seats along with it ha good size desk and two large wardrobes - his and hers. The room looked like it could adjoin on both sides so would be a nice family suite.

Mini bar was well stocked with so many choices and good quality drinks.
The fruit bowl and chocolates delivered upon arrival we're really fresh, generous portions and we really enjoyed taking the on two picnics in the park.
The room overlooked the park and had a small balcony but was not room enough to sit - other rooms I believe have a balcony and we would look at getting that room next stay because we enjoyed the room so much we would have liked to sit and watch the park.

Room service was a fresh menu and fast service - yet still had a ceremony to it being delivered. Housekeeping was fast efficient and carried out early in the day which is really refreshing.
The turn down service was wonderful,and a good tidy up as well with locations and little cotton cloth placed  down for your makeup and bathroom amenities. Was nice having the tidy up as well rather than return to chaos. 

High tea at the Dorchester is second to none - the decor is bright fresh, rich deep colors and fabric design on the chairs, the generous overflowing flowers that are really just so beautiful and make the Promenade even more welcoming - immaculately dressed waiters and waitesses, tails, gloves just enhance the experience even more. Then the food, service and atmosphere just make this a place you want to spend a whole afternoon.

I heard all sorts of requests being made that were simply taken in the stride of the staff. One women requested a super hot frothed milk with cardamom,  cinnamon, and saffron infused into it. The waitress with not missing a beat made it happen. 

This hotel met our expectations and more - we wil be back again for sure.",5,2015,09,11
130,My first time in such a luxury hotel,"It was amazing to stay there even for just one night. Hotel looks beautiful inside, staff is really frendly and helpful. Service was also great, there was no problem with early hour (4:30 am) breakfast request. I found using elevator a bit trouble. You have to be quite quick to push the button.",5,2015,09,11
130,WOW Service Model,"The service at the Dorchester was over the top, absolutely incredible and second only to the Kona Four Seasons of any hotel I've enjoyed my past forty years of traveling around the world!! The Hotel is located in a wonderful location, rooms are great and comfortable, and expected of an older hotel. I give it five stars!!",5,2015,09,10
130,Was ok but did to like the feel of the hotel,"There really is nothing wrong with this hotel, the suite was lovely, but it just did not have the feel for me, it is a difficult hotel to review as i said the hotel really is nice, i think it is just a personal thing, but worth a stop to try it.",4,2015,09,08
130,Excellent hotel ! ,"As many of you may know, the Dorchester is a superb luxury hotel . 

I have stayed four times 

Lovely rooms , great staff , attention to detail is fabulous .

Their Sunday lunch is excellent . 

I recommend this hotel VERY MUCH 

Thank you to all the lovely staff at the Dorchester . ",5,2015,09,08
130,Great Hotel,"Just had the pleasure of staying in the Dorchester Hotel.
The hotel as one would imagine is first class but most of all the staff make it special by being friendly but yet still remaining professional and took extra care of our 8 year old Daughter.
We look forward to visiting again.
Thank you to all the staff from the door men,waiters,bar staff and reception staff.
Chris",5,2015,09,01
130,Absolutely worth the premium (with one important caveat),"They say you get what you pay for...and it's absolutely the case at The Dorchester.  It's one of the most expensive options for hotels in London, but the service and accommodations are impeccable.  Every person in the hotel greets you warmly and works to make your stay special - from the front desk to the restaurants to front driveway.  Beautiful, immaculate rooms are spacious, including extra deep soaking tubs and uncharacteristically (for Europe) large showers.  The linens are appropriately luxurious and beds are extremely comfortable.  And of course, the location is phenomenal - near Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and all the luxury shopping imaginable.  The only hotel feature worth the hotel taking time to upgrade technologically is the wifi which was easily accessed but a very slow connection.

My only real issue with the hotel was the way they treated me as an American Express Platinum member.  The benefits of booking with Amex include a number of complimentary offerings when staying at one of their selected hotels.   But when I asked for an explanation of how it works, I was told I would simply receive a credit off my bill regardless of which benefits I chose.  During checkout, I was told I had not spent the full amount and therefore wouldn't get the credit.  It was an unfortunate end to the stay which would have been prevented by a clear explanation about how to take advantage of the program.  Just made me leave the hotel feeling a little less than fabulous...and truly a shame since the hotel stay until then was so truly lovely!",5,2015,09,01
130,"Alas, what has happened","In the last 18 years of intense travelling and criss crossing the globe, I have stayed many hotels. From the functional airport hotels to hotels in back and beyond to the ultra luxury ones. Till date, 2 hotels have remained the yardstick as to what defines perfection in a hotel and they are the George V in Paris and Dorchester in London. For me, whether it was the Four Seasons in Sydney or the Fullerton Bay in Singapore or the Hotel Castillo Son Vida in Palma, I have always compared each of them with the finest standards of the Dorchie and Georgie (my affectionate nicknames for both of them). Today, I am afraid I have to drop Dorchester from the elite list. I am currently staying at Dorchie and writing this review is difficult because it always is tough when an icon falls from an exalted position. So the question is why? 2 main reasons. Come back to the room at 4 am last nite and the flush of the bathroom does not work. Ok, sometimes mishaps take place so called housekeeping at that hour ( being little buzzed so did not remember exact time) and they came and fixed the flush. It was a tad embarrassing to call house keeping in the early hours of the morning for that. The second thing happened today evening. We leave our room (129) at 8 pm sharp and we ensure there is no DND sign.  As we left in a hurry the room is in a slight mess but we fully expect the turndown service of the hotel to take care and ensure the room is ready for the night. We enter our room at 1.30 am and horror of horrors, there was no turndown service and the room was in the same mess we left it in. Am I being too finicky? Any other hotel I would forget abt it but this is the Dorchester we are talking about. The holy grail as to what perfection is all about in the hotel industry. Is it slipping? Is it going down the Savoy route?? With a heavy heart, I remove Dorchester from the best of the best hotels of the world list leaving King George V of Paris on its own. Sigh.......",3,2015,08,31
130,Girls week in London,"Loved the hotel!  It's a large hotel that feels much more intimate and cozy. The staff are not just well trained, but remember your name after the initial introduction. Concierge helped us plan each day and hired tour guides that were marvelous. Made life so easy and fun for us. We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this ranks right up there. They recommended pubs in the area for some incredible food. London and food has certainly changed since I was last there. Ate in the Tang Restaurant and had the best Chinese food outside Hong Kong. High tea looked beautiful but we were way too busy to indulge. Good reason to go back!  Can't wait. ",5,2015,08,27
130,An Amazing Stay,"So I have stayed at the Dorchester in the past, and the service was good then, this time our Two night was exceptional.

We arrived from their sister property Le Meurice, for a two night stay. le Meurice was amazing, and I thought it would be near impossible to match the quality and service we received there.
We arrived and were greeted by Natalia, who informed us that the room category we had booked was unavailable, and they had taken the liberty of upgrading us to a different category room. Always a surprise, not always a nice one.
This was an excellent room, and we were very pleased.

The staff was impeccible. The service quite remarkable. Yes it's a first class hotel, but its tripadvisor rating, is certainly not a reflection of the stay we had. This is Definately one of the top 5 hotels in London.
From our first greeting by Natalia, to the service we received from the concierge, to room service and housekeeping and the door staff, everyone was amazing, I only wish I had written down all their names, because they all deserve recognition.",5,2015,08,26
130,My son's first evening at The Dorchester,"Last Thursday (August 20th, 2015), me and my son visited The Dorchester.
It was his first time and he was very keen to hear the jazz band in the Promenade Bar; he was delighted as he enjoyed it thoroughly!
I couldn't wish for a more welcome approach by the staff.
They were most attentive and they surely made his evening unforgettable.
Although not yet of an age where he's allowed to have alcoholic beverages, the barstaff made sure that he got the most fabulous (non-alcoholic) cocktails.
To complete the evening, the staff outside the hotel allowed him to view some of the most spectacular cars (he has ever seen) parked outside.

Thank you again for making my son's first visit so memorable!
We'll be back!!",5,2015,08,26
130,They charged us the gift voucher,"We were there because our friend gave us a voucher with one spa-champagne-night-breakfast. We spent more than a month to find a date to use it. We even suggest use it in more than 6 month away, but or they don't have the specific room or they don't know if the spa will be open. 

Finally, we manage a date. When we arrive the receptionist didn't know which voucher we were using! (and we made the booking directly in the hotel showing the voucher). 
He said he should ask, it was ok for us.

So we went to the spa. Afer that we asked again if the voucher was ok or not. The said there was no problem. 

What surprise the next morning! When we did our check out, the new receptionist said he doesn't know anything about the voucher. After speak with several people, finally he said the voucher only is for the room. We show him an email from the Dorchester Hotel which explain that the voucher include everything spa-champagne-room-breakfast, he again spent sometime asking. After some people, they said everything was ok.

But here the most horrible moment, when a week ago I see in my credit card a charge from Dorchester Hotel of everything!!!!!!!!!! 

After several emails to the hotel and the voucher agent, they refunded my money, after a month!!!!! 

One night in the Dorchester hotel, I'm still remember the headache of all these things. 

Hopefully, we had the money to pay it and we live in London to do all these staff easily.",1,2015,08,24
130,Expensive but worth it,"This hotel is best described as ""genteely shabby"" and doesn't pretend to be otherwise. Yes, it's very expensive but then you get the full treatment. (Theatre tickets? No problem sir). It's a wonderful feeling to be staying at the best hotel on Park Lane.

Avoid the dining room though. The food's good but incredibly expensive and not much of it either!",4,2015,08,21
130,Great cars,"My son specifically wanted to visit the hotel to get pics of the super cars and oh my god he wasn't disappointed.  Thank you x
He loved the cars in car park, we had to come back on the second day.
It's the first time he's been to your hotel to see them and what with the Bugatti across the road.....very pleased teenager ha ha",3,2015,08,19
130,The tequila shots are huge! :-) ,"I visited the Dorchester Hotel recently and I had a pleasant experience. I sampled everything from alcohol, to nibbles and cooked food. All I had to do was to look at their extensive menu of F & D and order - I ordered a tequila shot and it looked much bigger than normal shots served in other London bars, I did not mind though, the reason I was there was to have fun together with my date. The bill came to about £500 plus the tip and we were there for about two-hours. Luckily for me my date was generous to pay the bill :-) - another tequila please. X ",4,2015,08,19
130,Christmas Visit,"Visited at Christmas, and was very nicely decorated! Very clean, staff helpful and will make food or drink that's not on the menu and without making a fuss!
Elegant, and classy! Especially the piano bar.
Only down side was a few people boozing too much on their Christmas drinks... But so good it's formed a Christmas memory that I want to repeat every year!
",5,2015,08,18
130,All Time Favorite Hotel,"Ok I planned to visit my daughter who's studying Fashion Design at UAL for few days! I didn't make any hotel bookings until last minute thinking to find a hotel close to Spitalfields where she lives. Finally I decided to a place where I'm used to and been! The Dorchester. Of all hotels I've been to, the one I favor the most is the Dorchester. Starting from the Reception, Lobby, Restaurants, corridors, room, bathroom. They set the landmark of luxury standard hotel & service! I did however noticed that bathroom towels had some aging on them and require replacing with new ones. But everything was clean and neatly folded and placed accordingly. Thank you for a job well done!",4,2015,08,18
130,STUNNING HOTEL,"All the staff are very friendly, welcoming, attentive and professional. The hotel is beautiful.
Room should have been ready by 3.00pm, we arrived at 2.50pm to be told it would be about another 20 minutes, which was fine by us, it was finally ready at 3.50pm. They were very apologetic and put a small bottle of champagne with an apologetic note in our room, enjoyed and appreciated very much.  
But for a King Size Deluxe Room (126), our window view was a dirty blank wall and other room windows, was abit disappointed, I was expecting Hyde Park views. Not worth the money - sorry.
Food is beautiful and in abundance.
Will definitely be staying again and would very highly recommend (but not room 126 at that price).
I missed out on my free glass of champagne though, didn't see the card in the holder until it was too late :(
Beautiful hotel and beautiful staff :)",5,2015,08,17
130,My favourite London hotel,I love the whole atmosphere of the Dorchester. The champagne bar is great and a real people watcher. The hotel is immaculate. We booked with Grand Luxury Hotels and automatically got an upgrade and breakfast included. Breakfast was superb. The rooms are really quiet- we've never had a noisy room. The staff are very attentive and the valet parking is very organised. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2015,08,16
130,Quite Simply Exquisite. The Epitome of English Class.,"Quite possibly my best hotel stay, ever. 
The service was almost utopic. 
The suite beautifully appointed.
The attention to detail incredibly meticulous. 
The attention devoted to my son on the occasion of his first birthday was superb. 
Smiles all round, freebies galore, and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.
I plan to make staying there a family tradition. 
Awesome stay.",5,2015,08,16
130,Superb hotel ,"One of the finest hotels in London. Excellent central location.. Very close to major shopping and tourist attractions.. Very luxurious rooms and lobby.. Immaculate furniture.. Free Wifi,  Excellent food.. It has  2 gourmet restaurants.. Very friendly staff.. Excellent value for the money.. ",5,2015,08,12
130,A lovely experience,"I had a lovely 3 day stay here in July when I came over for business.  The location is excellent and the service was absolutely charming. I particularly enjoyed the lovely breakfasts in the Promenade - a beautiful central room that runs the length of the ground floor – wonderfully 1930’s and evocative of the age of the Grand Hotels.  
 
My room was rather small and overlooked an internal courtyard (unlike many of the other rooms - which overlook Hyde Park), but, although small, the room was “perfectly formed”.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, there was a convenient writing desk, some comfortable chairs and all the other details that you expect in a 5* hotel. The bathroom was also compact but had every feature – a walk-in shower, separate bath, double washbasins, etc. All in all, I was immensely comfortable, despite being a rather large person and normally very distrustful of compact spaces.
 
The service was a particular highlight. Every interaction that I had with members of staff was helpful and charming – from the lady who helped me at check-in, right through to the lovely lady from house-keeping who recommended a small glass of warmed wine for my (rather awful) flu. Because I had managed to become quite ill on the flight over, I needed to work from my room on the first day. My company laptop’s firewall was not happy with the Dorchester’s wifi service, but 2 people from the e-concierge team refused to be defeated and after some complex maneuverings were able to get me set up on a separate system which allowed me to do nearly a full day of work. It was hugely appreciated.  There was only 1 tiny lapse in the excellent service. I used a small knife and plate on my first night’s stay, and also drank one of the complimentary bottles of water – rather oddly, the small knife and used plate remained in the room for my entire stay, and the bottle of water was never replenished.
 
Sadly, I had various outside dinner engagements during my stay, so apart from breakfast in the Promenade, I was not able to try any of the hotel’s reputable restaurants. I do, however, look forward to trying the Afternoon Tea on my return!",5,2015,08,10
130,Perfect,The dorchester is a unique hotel in the heart of london and what can i say it lives up to the 5 star name the staff are professional and attentive and never made u feel out of place decided to have afternoon tea here the foo was perfect and plenty of it if tou are loking for a high standard hotel this is it will be returning to london again soon and the dorchester will be at the top of my list for rest and relaxation thankyou once again,5,2015,08,07
130,Beyond Luxury ,"I've visited this place in March for a spring break. I've been welcomed great fully and been upgraded from an executive room to a 1 bedroom suite.

The suite has two access doors and two toilets with showers and a living room and a dinning table. 

The lobby is also a great place to stay in during the day for a cup of tea. However, the breakfast is a menu style, which I really don't like, I tend to enjoy the buffet more.

I really enjoyed my stay at the Dorchester. ",4,2015,08,05
130,Utter luxury,"This is a very special place, which most people will never visit or, like us, only occasionally. Everything, without exception, is perfect.  The staff go out of their way to make every guest's visit a special occasion. The bedrooms have the most comfortable beds imaginable, and everything that a visitor could want.  The bathrooms are exceptional. Breakfast was a special occasion and the food was to perfection. Bear in mind, though, that the price a guest has to pay is considerable - although most people staying here don't seem worried about expense. Every traveller should experience The Dorchester at least once, as it provides a benchmark against which to judge other hotels.",5,2015,08,05
130,A wedding of a dream at The Dorchester!,"Thank you very much Nigel Sandiford and Henry Brossi for a wedding we couldn't even dare to imagine in our dreams! We are so very grateful to the whole Dorchester Team for an unforgettable wedding! Huge thank you to Helen McIntosh for perfect organisation of our special day, Adriana Prieto and Aleksandra Balinskaja for being exceptionally attentive and making our day so incredible and our guests so happy! The Dorchester and only The Dorchester is the place for a fairytale wedding!!!",5,2015,07,25
130,It's like heaven,"When you talk about The Dorchester you talk about fairytale. It's pure magic. I've been at The Dorchester for about 4 times already, the first time was somewhere around May 2013. I always keep coming back there. Maybe you ask youself why? Or why The Dorchester and not any other hotel/place? Well, firstly I always feel like home (I was born & live in Romania, but my heart is English). The service level is high one, which I love and honestly it's worth the expenses. It is one of the most comfortable stays in any hotel I have ever been to. Always clean, classy, beautiful, absolutely wonderful view location. It's amazing. The tea area is a must. You have to try it. The greatest tea I have ever tasted. About the staff members, all of them are very polite, courteous and all help you enhance your stay. Speaking about The Dorchester Bar, cocktails are of the highest standard and the knowledgeable staff are so helpful. Over the years I've been at The Dorchester during Christmas time and Easter time, the atmosphere there is so great, full of joy, inner peace and happiness.
I don't say that you need to check it out. I just can't say it. All I can say is that you must be there at least once in this lifetime.",5,2015,07,24
130,"A wonderful,charismatic hotel in the centre of London",I have had the most amazing time in this great hotel in London;it is a grand hotel but feels very intimate and homely.The service is probably the best available in the World;the Dorchester bar is great if you want to meet people in a very special environment.,5,2015,07,24
130,It's all it says it is!,"This was a special treat for my wife's birthday. The Dorchester experience is one to enjoy and soak up the atmosphere of a world class hotel. It is expensive but, you do get what you pay for. All the staff members are polite and courteous and all help to enhance your stay. After 3 nights there it was hard work getting back into the swing of normal life! We look forward to returning again at some point in the not too distant future.",5,2015,07,23
130,it was magical,"it was a special anniversary of ours so we wanted to celebrate it in style, we planned a weekend visit to london and decided to stay here, the service was impeccable, the rooms outstanding and the overall feeling was amazing!
i would definitely recommend this for special visits, it just adds to the magic!",5,2015,07,21
130,Expensive but worth it.,"The service level here is quite high. As are the prices. But comparatively speaking the quality level here is well  worth the expense .

High tea was areal treat, themed to coincide with  tennis matches , it was almost too much of a good thing. 

If you want thes best, and the budget will bear, try the Dorchester .",5,2015,07,16
130,Wonderful Hotel,"I only got to stay there for two days during my trip to London; however, it was one of the most comfortable stays in any hotel I have ever been to. One and only drawback was that staff was all around the place at every single moment; it gets a bit uncomfortable as you feel that outside the hotel room you have no privacy because over-attentiveness can be annoying. I have nothing else negative to say; clean, amazing, beautiful, comfortable, classy, absolutely wonderful location. Spacious suites overlooking Hyde Park provide wonderful views and all the space you would ever need in a hotel.",5,2015,07,14
130,2nd Visit this year and just as good,"Another fantastic weekend stay at the Dorchester. Stayed for Royal Ascot and I couldn't think of anywhere better to stay before a day at the races. Breakfast was excellent, The Dorchester Bar cocktails are of the highest standard and the knowledgeable staff are so helpful. Don't let the grandeur of this hotel put you off staying here. The staff treat you the same whether In jeans (Smart ones) or dressed to go to the palace.",5,2015,07,13
130,Old World Elegance with Simplicity,"I visited London and decided to stay at the Dorchester in London.  Pricey but well worth it as it is frequented by diplomats and nobility from around the world.  Although I arrived during a time of remodeling, I was greeted at the door by name as if I was an old friend.  The restaurant was fabulous and provided a vast selection of the finest wines in the world.  The steak rivaled that of the best steak houses in the US.  The room was smallish but well maintained.  Not sure where the communication got crossed as far as the purpose of my stay but each time I arrived from a tourist tromp, there were rose petals on my bed and in my tub.  I am sure that they misunderstood or confused my stay with that of a honeymooner couple.  I of course love the smell and aroma of rose petals at night.  I thoroughly enjoyed my 10-day stay in luxury and extravagance.",4,2015,07,10
130,Superd service!,"Superb service, great rooms, excellent restaurants, bar, traditional English teat time , everything you would not to be perfect was! Great bar atmosphere, have some classy cocktails made just for you, Chinese restaurant was authentic . Recommend to make reservations. Very interesting place to watch people as well.",5,2015,07,08
130,None better in terms of service,"I spend 200 days of the year traveling the world and staying in some of the best hotels out there.

20 years on I have found the hotel that towers above all others when it comes to service. They anticipate your needs precisely and deliver on them. Gone are the days of asking, begging, pleading and complaining. Service at a different level.

Centrally located in beautiful Mayfair across the road from Hyde Park.

Room and bathroom was nice. Amenities good too. Air-conditioning needs some work. Struggles to get below 22deg on a hot day.

A must stay property.",5,2015,07,07
130,British Civility,"Definitely not cheap, but a once in a lifetime splurge for us regular people. Tasteful rooms and beyond courteous staff. If someone in London asks where you're staying, mention The Dorchester and you get excellent service (London cabbies too) ! Lol",4,2015,07,07
130,The Best,"As you would expect from this type of establishment.  Very lavish and well presented reception area.  Floral displays magnificent.  The little touches were wonderful throughout the Hotel.  The dining room was lovely, food very good.  Staff kind, helpful and eager to please and speak to my daughter.  Great staff on hand for everything.  Very welcoming and accommodating.  The bedroom was very comfortable and clean.  All we wanted and needed for our sightseeing holiday and yet comfortable to return to and watch TV before dinner or going back out.  Easy to get a taxi too!",5,2015,07,04
130,A wonderful stay!,"I stayed in this beautiful hotel for two nights and can not praise it or the staff more highly. I was looked after incredibly well, with plenty of smiles and made so welcome it was hard to leave. The promenade and the staff working there were amazing. I'm looking forward to staying here again.",5,2015,07,04
130,Amazing Staff,Every year at Christmas to do our Christmas shopping my Mum and I go to London for what we call Paddington day. It's our yearly Mum & Daughter tradition - very special. We book the best London has to offer. This particular year Dec 2014 we chose to stay at the Dorchester and it did not disappoint. While the hotel is very beautiful and the room was lovely it was the staff that made it an amazing experience! Hats off to the staff who were simply incredible and to be honest my Mum and I felt like movie stars! Go on book it! It's a spoil but it's a must!,5,2015,07,02
130,true luxury,"business trip to the Dorchester, very plush very well staffed to the highest standard. well heeled cosmopolitan clientele, the Dorchester treats the best to the best, any minor complaints are dealt with immediately the reputation as a top quality hotel is maintained throughout. However one will pay for it. Staff can be a little overbearing, but are there to serve and this they do with aplomb. Rooms are as one would expect excellent. excellence throughout.",5,2015,07,02
130,"Delightful, but...","I stayed here in December with my partner and I have to say, it is a wonderful place. The staff are helpful and attentive. The room we stayed in was beautiful. Nicely furnished, if a little twee, but nonetheless a very pleasant room. The concierge was very helpful and things I requested were waiting in the room when we got back to it. 
The only thing I felt was lacking was a place to sit in a comfortable seat with a cup of tea or coffee. The choice is the either The Grill which is not particularly comfortable or the bar which was loud and raucous. In the end, we had room service, which whilst very pleasant, wasn't what we wanted. It's a shame, because it took the shine off an otherwise lovely stay. 
All that said, I would quite happily stay here again.",4,2015,06,30
130,If you want the Best then forget the rest,I have known this hotel for over 30 years and despite living in the same area and am very aware of all the Luxury hotels in the area of Mayfair. Quite frankly this is the best from the bar to the Restaurants. They have never failed in the 30 years to deliver outstanding service of perfection in all aspects. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anybody. I visit this Hotel on a regular basis like 5 days a week when I am home in Mayfair. I have also stayed at the hotel whilst my property was under renovation for some 2 months and this is by far the best I have seen. Please believe me I was looking for faults and could find nothing.,5,2015,06,28
130,Great location for a ball,"My first visit to Dorchester for a ball.  On entering the hotel it is very imposing - decor is gorgeous and the flower arrangements are quite fantastic.  Staff were very eager to take our bags.  Young, management trainee lady was super-courteous and took some pics for us.  Before ball, lots of staff to ensure 270 of us got our welcome drink and copious nibbles.

Food during ball was delicious and service from staff was courteous and attentive.  The band was very competent, and singer Annabel Williams was outstanding.

An outstanding evening",5,2015,06,27
130,The Dorchester Hotel is the Best,The Lobby at The Dorchester Hotel smells so good . Adorned with assorted species of Flowers everywhere in all kind of vases from giant to the smallest flower vase . Alain Ducasse The Grill is the best among all the other Alain Ducasse establishment we sampled . I Highly recommend The Dorchester Hotel .the staff are friendly and helpful .,5,2015,06,20
130,Ambivalent,"The redecorated rooms are very silvery and elegant.  The old room decor was more traditional and warmer.  The employees are first rate, speak English, very helpful in a sincere way, and polite.  But the lobby decor is gauche, bad loud music plays in the evening.  You can sit there and have a nice snack and drinks, yet you don't feel at ease.   It's an expensive hotel.  I would expect it to be classier.",4,2015,06,19
130,Outstanding,"We celebrated our Silver wedding anniversary at the Dorchester last month, and took four rooms so we could join up with our closest friends for the occasion.  From the moment we stepped through the door, we were at home.  Reception was brilliant and very discreet, our friends were greeted like VIPs and service throughout our stay was fantastic.
Our room was gorgeous and nothing we asked for was too much for anyone.  We booked the celebration special (can't remember its name) and had champagne on ice, flowers, fruit, and a gift from the Spa waiting on our arrival.
The cocktail list at the bar is astounding and it would need someone with a lot more stamina than me to cover even the tip of the iceberg - every cocktail was presented like a work of art.
Dinner on the Saturday night at Alain Ducasse was memorable, breakfasts in the Grill were generous, we couldn't fault the hotel and didn't want to leave.
And it is fabulous to hail a taxi and say 'The Dorchester'!  Highly recommended!",5,2015,06,16
130,Wonderful Hotel in Hyde Park,This service at this hotel is wonderful.  The staff and team are extremely friendly and helpful.  The accommodations are good.  The room was very well kept.  I definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a classical city hotel with a vintage feel but modern amenities.,5,2015,06,15
130,Amazing service,"Thank you so much for the amazing service offered by your staff particularly your out of hours waiters in the bar area and in the early hours of Saturday 30th May, nothing was too much for them. 

Also, my thanks go out to your Concierge Paul Stocker who did his best to help me with my Congestion Charge. There were all sorts of issues but he persevered and kept me informed long after I departed from your hotel. I cannot thank these people enough for the excellent service they provided, they are an absolute credit to your hotel.",5,2015,06,15
130,London at its finest without any compromise,The best hotel in London without question. This is the benchmark against all luxury hotels in the world. The service is flawless and the rooms are pure luxury. The prices are high but I suggest you compare this to other luxury hotel prices.,5,2015,06,15
130,Best stay in london,"We have been visiting to london since 12 years, unfortunately this is my first time at the Dorchester. Best stay ever. 
Location is great. Rooms are spacious, clean, and natural lighting is Amazing. Lobby is super. Best breakfast since a long time. 
Staff are wonderful, from the time I called to reserve till we checked out. 
Sure will be back.   ",5,2015,06,09
130,What can you say about such an exquisite hotel. Needs 6 stars not 5!!,"we were so lucky to be able have a night here. It was absolutely fabulous. Wasn't sure how we would be treated , not being one of the super rich, but they were soooo friendly, and made you feel right at home. The rooms were lovely, and the bed was so comfortable. It was a wonderful visit. Could they just make the hot water in the shower come through a bit quicker!
No coffee making equipment in the room , you just ring reception and they bring it up!!
Truly fantastic",5,2015,06,04
130,Faultless,This was our first visit to the Dorchester and we only stayed for the one night whilst visiting friends but it is already one of my favourite hotels. It is without doubt one of the best located hotels with fabulous decor and an air of elegance about that's not found in many hotels nowadays but what made it for me were the staff. Every member of staff I came across couldn't have been friendlier nor more professional with an obvious goal of looking after the guests to the best of their abilities. Simply superb,5,2015,06,03
130,Perfect in every way,"In it's category, I don't think you can't find better than The Dorchester.  Extreme luxury, perfect service, top quality and very good location. Off course, this is a top end hotel with top end prices, but the value for money ratio is extremely good.  If you want a once in a lifetime experience, you should spoil yourself with a stay at The Dorchester.",5,2015,06,01
130,Luxury at its best,"The Dorchester Park lane London. Truly one of the greatest luxury hotels in the world. My parents would take me there as a child & my love of this fine old establishment has never waned. Situated in the center of London in Mayfair & not to be missed. If it is a little to expensive for your special trip at least go there for afternoon tea or dinner in the stunning Grill room. .Allan Ducasse Incredible French food or China Tang some of the best Chinese food I have eaten anywhere for an unforgettable meal.
If you do stay go for a suite at the front of the hotel overlooking the parking lot where they will park your Aston Martin & ""The Tree"" planted the year I was born & lit year round by a thousand white lights. I can also recommend any of the hotels in the Dorchester Collection.  Enjoy!!",5,2015,05,31
130,Ladies night to dine like Queens,"We had a reservation booked in for 17.45pm.  The occasion was just to dine with friends.  We came here for Afternoon Tea a few months back but this time was an evening affair.  We got shown to our seats - it wasn't that full at the time.  The decor was gold with coch shells decorated everywhere.  There was music at the background.  The waiter came over and asked for if we cared for water.  I was quite happy for tap water but my friends obviously got confused and we ended up having to fork out a £6ish bottle of water 😁 we had an aperitif which was mini crackers with salmon mousse.  It was delicious and such an delicate affair.  Our glass of champagne came along with the menu.  I must admit the glasses were a bit different.  
Guess what we all opted the same - starter was mackerel with fennel.  We were offered bread and Stilton bread was in the selection.  It was delicious if you like Stilton.  Had the starter which went down a treat.  I've never eaten fennel before - it's like aniseed.  Our main was the highlight as it was sirloin beef.  Anything with the word beef gets my attention.  We were offered another piece of bread - this time I opted for farmhouse.  The beef came on a silver trolley.  The handsome chap asked if we preferred the edge and he started carving.  It was melt in the mouth sensation and the mash was absolutely smooth and delicious - oh dear diet had to start tomorrow 😱 again the Waiter asked if we wanted more bread - of course why not.  I opted for a piece with seeds on top this time.  The beef was so succulent and the waiter came over and served us with a gravy/jus thing.   Oh yes the waiter asked if we wanted more bread -  I felt rude to not oblige so I opted for the seeds one again as it was the biggest of the whole selection and it tasted delicious.  My plate was so clean as the food was to die for.  Oh I forgot one of my friends treated us to a bottle of Riesling costing a mere £65.  I felt as I have had 5 star treatment as the waiters was so attentive and the food was A+ rated.  The glass of champagne  was such a winner that even a fly liked it.  So glad I drank it all before it perched on my glass!  Next was the final course - dessert!  Definitely had to opt for the Lemon tart.  I was quite surprised to see a Lemon tart which came like a meringue with a side bowl of refreshing lemon sorbet.  Oh my the meringue melted and inside was luscious silky thick lemon custard curd with bits of lemon peel.  It was lovely while the lemon sorbet was such a palate cleanser.  I'm so stuffed along with the Riesling.  Then If that wasn't enough we had a finale little Eton mess with strawberries.  Too rude not to eat.  It was superb.  I had a fantastic time and was definitely 5* dining.  One thing I would mention was that they didn't place the napkin on your lap but hey who cares as it was ace service.  Thank you 😉",4,2015,05,31
130,Lunch deal at the Dorchester Hotel,"Lunch deal of 3-course dinner and a glass of champange. Everything was absolutely brilliant and well worth it.  The menu choice on the meal deal were limited, but the price was so much more affordable than the main menu. All the food was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented.  The service from all the staff we encountered was absolutely brillaint. The champagne cocktails in the bar were expensive, but delicious and worth it in my opinion. I would highly recommend anyone to try this!",5,2015,05,31
130,Luxury in Mayfair,"Stayed in this luxurious property for the first time in London for my 5 days business trip in May.

The booking experience was fairly good, used the property website which provides clear information on the room types, sizes etc. It also has special fairs/promotions.

Check-in experience was shockingly negative: After arriving early in the morning (around 9 am) we we registered at the reception but were told that the room was not ready as the official check in time @3pm which was understood. So we decided to leave our bags and enjoy the lovely weather out.

We came back exhausted @3.30 pm to know that our room is not ready! so we waited for 30 minutes and sent to a room other than the one assigned to us but similar type. 
The bags arrived after 30 minutes to the room after ""extensive search"" !
We complained to the from desk manager Mr. Andrew who was very accommodating and offered waiving the charges of the first night and free breakfast through out our stay. He has totally changed the bad impression we had on this. 

The rooms and restaurants:
The room was very comfortable in size and very elegant, the toilets are also very luxurious and has a separate shower stand.
The breakfast experience was OK in both restaurants The Grill and The Promenade which offers A La carte menus only. We also dined in the next door steak restaurant in 45 Park lane operated by the Dorchester which was good experience but of course pricy.
The hotel has two other dining options and well known for its afternoon tea experience which we haven't got the chance to try.

The location and other services:
The hotel located right on Park Lane facing the Hyde park and within walking distance to Mayfair's renowned restaurants, bars and shopping areas. The closest type station ""Hyde Park Corner"" is 5 minutes walk.
The housekeeping service is superb and the conceive service especially Mr. Paul helped us in booking few of the fine and busy restaurants in London",5,2015,05,30
130,Hotel cancelled a major business event,"I work for a large international company and we had booked an event here, after having the date confirmed the hotel came back to us to say they had someone else interested in this date. When we confirmed that our event was going ahead as previously booked, they withdrew the date from us. Responses took a few weeks and we are now having to look to reschedule/relocate this event which will involve a huge amount of hassle with VIP's etc. 

DO NOT rely on this hotel, they can and will cancel on you.",1,2015,05,29
130,An amazing experience at this hotel where we went for afternoon tea,"The whole experience was marvellous from beginning to end.Excellent service,great food,tasty sandwiches and cakes to die for. My friend and I could not give a high enough rating. Although the Promenade  restaurant was busy the atmosphere was relaxing and friendly. We were looked after by Paco and the rest of the very attentive team.Brilliant and can't wait to return",5,2015,05,28
130,Amazing wonderful experience,"We went for afternoon tea with our daughter who is 18, we had a cocktail in the bar first which was fantastic, we then went in and were seated to have our afternoon tea, a real treat sandwiches and scones and cakes were out of this world tasted fantastic, a great experience, staff are so friendly and helpful this was our second experience and it did not disappoint, can't wait to go again for our wedding anniversary treat :) highly highly recommend.",5,2015,05,28
130,Updated and Charming,Staff are wonderful. Nothing is to much trouble. The hotel is updating some of the rooms but the workers are quiet and friendly. The room is spacious and quiet and very clean. The hotels bar is lovely and again the staff are welcoming and friendly. We have had a wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel,5,2015,05,27
130,Posh nosh,"Upmarket hotel we just went for a conference dinner. The bar is very nice, with a jazz band, great for an early evening drink starter. Marble loos. Banquet hall very nice, service generall was good, served with white gloves. Food for what must have been 500 very good. Very attentive waiter which resulted in filling my wine glass too often. Did not stay the night.",4,2015,05,22
130,"Wonderful atmosphere, exceptional staff, disappointing food.","I visited the dorchester recently for a 3 day conference and very much enjoyed my time working with the staff there. Our events manager, Dharko, was exceptional and I hope we work with him next year. The food put on by the hotel for us and our guests was largely very good, the self serve breakfasts were fantastic and the lighter bites were also delicious. However, as a vegan, I was somewhat dissapointed with the lunches. They were certainly pleasant and filling enough but there seemed to be the opinion that vegan also meant gluten free / fat free/ carb free and 3 of my 6 courses over the two lunches were fruit, one was a salad and the other two consisted solely of vegetables. It migh have been nice to see some carbohydrates or proteins as I know the hotel had them avaliable having enjoyed some of them at other times! 

Nevertheless, as a venue to hold a conference I can confirm the staff are helpful and reliable and the majority of the food put on is fantastic. We are already planning our next conference here next year.",4,2015,05,21
130,Amazing place,This place is amazing what a hotel mega money to stay but if you are going to stay in a hotel in London that offers excellent service this is up there with the ritz or claridges   They turn your bed down put slippers out for you in the evening and if you leave your cloths on the floor of your room like me because you are in a rush to go out they fold your cloths and put them away for you.    The bath in the room was massive and really deep oh my word what a bath   The mini bar in the room was full of some really nice brandy and what a TV there is in your room must cost a fortune.  So to say I enjoyed it here is an understatement.     Breakfast was nice as well but London prices but remember this is a top class hotel    Forgot to mention the cocktail bar is a must its dimly lit with funky lights and they make any drink you can think of,5,2015,05,19
130,Simply perfect!,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for one night whilst on a short trip to London to see the BAFTA'a.  This hotel, its surroundings, beautiful rooms, delightful food and amazing staff truly made our stay a memorable one.  From the minute we arrived we received the most professional, friendly and genuine service from the hotel staff.  Nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel valued and welcome.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We will be back next time we are in London.  Thank you to all the staff at The Dorchester.",5,2015,05,12
130,Iconic Hotel,"I recently stayed at The Dorchester for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. On arrival my room wasn't quite ready but I was seated in the beautiful lobby and served a complimentary drink and some snacks. My room up on the 6th floor was a bit of a trek but as I requested a quiet room this was fine and situated at the back away from the front of the hotel. Luxurious room and well appointed bathroom did not disappoint. Gym was small but had all the essential equipment for a good workout. Breakfast was lavish and thoroughly satisfying which could be served in the grill or lobby. I didn't dine here during my stay but have dined before at Alain Ducasse - a truly wonderful restaurant, some of the best food I've eaten in my life and lovely attentive friendly staff. I've also dined in China Tang several times another really good restaurant but I absolutely adore the China Tang Bar with great mixologists who made some of the best cosmopolitan's I've ever drunk! Overall Dorchester was fantastic and looking forward to returning again soon.",5,2015,05,11
130,Afternoon Tea,"Been today for afternoon tea, greeted with a lovely smiling face and very helpful. 
The surrounding are beautiful all very comfortable, and the staff are excellent, all very pleasant and the sandwich cakes etc were all beautifully presented and very very enjoyable and relaxing.
Well done to all",5,2015,05,08
130,Wonderful experience,"As soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted by reception as if we were special and we mattered. We had the lovely surprise of being up graded as it was my husbands birthday celebration.  We were shown to our room which was beautiful and a lovely touch to find a birthday cake.
The bed extremely comfortable, beautiful marble bathroom with excellent toiletries. 
Our evening meal was devine.We had soufflés both evenings for desert and they were just perfect.  Breakfast was excellent and the service first class.

All the staff were very attentive. The Dorchester now holds very special dear memories for us and we would love to return.  Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful weekend.",5,2015,05,04
130,Find the Butler!,"Amazing visit to The Dorchester. I visited there with my mum and her friend when they were travelling to London. We met the Butler, Paul in the lobby when we arrived and from that moment on we were swept off our feet. The hotel is very grand and you walk in and it could be quite overwhelming but Paul walk us around and talked through all of the areas in the hotel whilst talking about the history of the hotel and the company. We cheekily asked if we could see a suite - Paul gave us a show round and it was really breath-taking. We then had drinks and nibbles in the bar - again the service from the bar team was perfect. We all loved our trip to the Dorchester and would 100% recommend it to anyone travelling to London.",5,2015,05,01
130,Super elegant hotel,"The location is brilliant, very close to Hyde Park and Oxford street. We loved our room so pretty and elegant. Probably the prettiest hotel I have ever stayed in. The bathroom was beautiful with lots of thick marble. The toiletries were disappointing so I would suggest bringing your own. I had a spa treatment during my stay and I would highly recommend this and allow time to use the steam and relaxing room.  We had room service one night and it is VERY expensive my lobster sandwich was pretty good but over priced. 
The staff were excellent in the spa and on reception. There is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and to have coffee delivered cost gbp 20....although as we were leaving I discovered an early morning complimentary tea station in the reception, although this was not advised when I originally asked. I  would absolutely stay there again.",4,2015,04,27
130,Absolutely wonderful,We stayed at The Dorchester as part of my girlfriends 40th birthday surprise weekend. I had mentioned this to the reservations team when I booked the room and they kindly upgraded us to the Harlequin suite which was a fantastic surprise. All of the staff in the hotel have excellent customer service skills and made our stay a very very very pleasurable experience and we will definitely be returning.,5,2015,04,26
130,Amazing,"Amazing hotel experience. Stayed overnight for a birthday in November. From the minute we entered until we left, the staff were amazing, paid attention to detail, wherever we went in the hotel, the staff wished my friends a happy birthday.When we arrived the room was not ready and we were treated to compilmentary afternoon tea. The Grill restaurant had just reopened , and the service was superb. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,24
130,Exceeding expectations ,"As a demanding customer, I couldn't feel more looked after than when I stayed at the Dorchester - nothing was too much trouble, the service, food and comfort made my day so much better. My new London home ? Most defiantly - this is five star at its best .",5,2015,04,23
130,Great experience,"Stayed for a weekend at the end of November. Good location and had a large room over looking Hyde Park. Staff were impeccable, from the concierge to the cleaner who greeted us with a nice smile and ""hello"". Yes it was expensive - but we don't do this very often so a nice treat and the hotel stay is part of the holiday.

Only one gripe - they couldn't find space for us to sample afternoon tea! even if we were residents. Never mind we went to Harrods and enjoyed their afternoon tea instead.

Also, great place to people watch, seen a few ""faces"" over the weekend. But I particularly liked watching the very posh middle aged lady trying to work out how to operate the lifts - after a couple of attempts (doors open - step in - door shuts - door opens - she is still there?) she approaches the concierge who without batting an eyelid or demeaning her in any way escorts her to the lift and onward to her room - that is good service.",4,2015,04,22
130,Fabulous weekend.,"My wife and I stayed from17th-20th April and had the most relaxing weekend. The staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel at home, nothing was too much trouble and every one we came in to contact with were always happy to have a chat.We spent a lot of time in the Promenade Lounge where the service and food were excellent.The room we had was also excellent.The staff are a real credit to the Dorchester and the General Manager should be very proud of them all. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels throughout the World so I would say we are qualified to give this report.",5,2015,04,21
130,Almost perfect,"We spent another 3 nights at the Dorchester over Easter, taking two rooms, with one for the use of our two children.

As usual, service was world class, and the general feel is that of not just a 5 star hotel, but one of the world's very best hotels.

I only have two quibbles....

1. Ok, virtually no one who works at the Dorchester is a native English speaker...and the array of accents (and the level of service that native Brits seldom seem to provide) are charming and welcome. But ffs, can you please put people who speak English well enough to carry on a normal conversation on your first points of contact...i.e., the telephones?

While I had absolutely no problems interacting with any of the hotel staff during our 3 days, my attempt to make some reservations by phone before our arrival found me speaking with a French fellow who simply didn't speak enough English to communicate adequately, and I finally had to speak to someone else at the hotel to make myself understood. Surely, no matter how great an employee otherwise might be, before putting him/her on the reservations desk you would make sure that his English was effortless, not slightly tortured.

Likewise, while trying to reserve a table in the Promenade for dinner/drinks, someone called ""Nani"" just couldn't quite take on board that I just wanted a table at the back near the piano, and that I wanted to make sure it was ok to bring our kids along in the evening. Not a huge issue......but again, it's the UK, and you shouldn't really need to slow down and struggle to make yourself understood in a 5 star hotel in a country in which English is the native language. With housekeeping staff, or other ""back of house"" staff, no problem, but the people who answer the phones shouldn't struggle with the language.

2. We had Easter dinner at the Grill, and found, much to my surprise, that this was the weak link in the Dorchester chain, so to speak. Not bad at all.....but unlike the waiters in the Promenade and other areas of the hotel.....who are world class, and make you feel as if you are in the best hotel in the world, and in the best possible hands.....I found that in the Grill the wait staff, while perfectly ok....was considerably less efficient....friendly, and even brought a bit of attitude to the table, so to speak. Nothing serious.....just nowhere near the quality of service as we find at other areas of the hotel.

Whereas nothing seems to be too much to ask of any other Dorchester staff, in the Grill the reception to requests is a bit more ""Well.....ok"".

More significantly, the food simply isn't that great. Good....sometimes very good, but by NO stretch of the imagination is it great. We got our kids the fish and chips starters (not called that, of course....but rather ""Lemon Sole Goujonettes and chips""). But the reality was that the fish was essentially what you'd expect out of a frozen bag bought at Iceland (but at £17 a tiny serving). The very night before we'd had some mini fish and chip snacks in the Promenade that set a new standard for perfection....light, crunchy and delicious. The same dish (essentially) in the Grill was remarkably less good (I'd also highly recommend the Wagu Beef Sliders in the Promenade, by the way).

The veal chop in the Grill was good, but the sauce had been over-reduced to the point of being almost sickening (and to be picky, this dish should really have morel mushrooms, not common, ordinary mushrooms....this might add a Pound to food costs, but would vastly improve the dish.  The bernaise sauce served with the Salmon was by far the most vinegary I've ever had....and it tasted of little else BUT vinegar. This rendered it virtually un-usable, as it simply overwhelmed anything you put it on, even the Rib of Beef we tried it on. Does no one in the kitchen actually TASTE these things before pronouncing them fit to send out?

The Rib of Beef for two, by the way, gives one the impression of being  roast beef, so you might expect large slices of pink roast beef off the trolley (ala Simpsons, etc), but what comes out is a Rib Steak, just about large enough for two...which is simply cut into chunks, and each person gets a few of these chunks....which taste ok, but are nothing like a roast rib of beef, which is what *I* at least was expecting to come out.

This simply isn't a restaurant that is remotely on the level of the Ritz dining room, in food quality, presentation, ambience or service.....even though the prices are virtually the same. While I love staying in the Dorchester, and love eating in the Promenade, China Tang, and their world class room service...for fine dining I'll be making the short walk over to the Ritz next time.

Still, leaving out the Grill, I have to repeat that this must surely be one of the 10 best hotels on the planet, and I have been lucky enough to stay in a lot of great hotels around the world. 

I will continue to be a regular.",4,2015,04,10
130,Quite simply the best...!,"We've enjoyed a few 5-star hotel stays over the years but this 2-night visit at The Dorchester has simply been the best ever....and by some distance.
The food, the bedroom, the public areas, the service, the staff - all were perfect, and we felt like we were walking on air the whole time.
It is opulent and high-class hotel but somehow never stuffy or over-powering.  It's the staff that are the key I think - everything we saw them do; serve drinks, bring food, clean, prepare, dress rooms - was done with pride and with the guest experience paramount throughout.
This was a very special trip (20yrs marriage anniversary) and not one we will repeat often - but right now, I can think of no other place I would choose to stay, other than The Dorchester of London.  Wonderful.",5,2015,04,09
130,best customer service from GULIO French guy in the breakfast,"i stay in the hotel in he 29 to 30 of march, i love it the breakfast was amazing perfect the waiter Gulio ( sorry if is not the correct name, but no name badge) the french guy was perfect very very nice and always smiling, the rest of the team it s seems like a little bit desmotiveted. 
i must say that i stay in several hotels like Shangri La and Marriott but this one was fantastic

thanks again we gonna came back soon.
tanks french guy for the fantastic servive",5,2015,04,08
130,Unprofessional and Hostile,"I recently attended the Dorchester Hotel in London to dine and for relaxation. On arrival, one of the Receptionists/Managerial staff, was disrespectful. In response, I explained that I was accustomed to staying at 5 Star Hotels and that the behaviour of staff at the Reception desk was offensive. If I had not made a reservation at Alain Ducasse, I would not have remained in the Hotel. When I ordered Room Service, the food and drink arrived and looked as if staff had half eaten and drank some of it! When I arrived at Alain Ducasse, I was offered a seat in a terrible area. I insisted that they seat me somewhere decent. 
Most of the Hotel staff were nasty and should not be working at a Hotel that claims to be 5 Star.",1,2015,04,07
130,"Outstanding service, location and rooms","I travel frequently to London and have stayed all over. No more. I am now a loyal fan of the Dorchester. Service goes beyond the expected. Concierge, front desk and the restaurant service was spectacular. I unfortunately had a 24 hour stomach flu. When I was finally able to eat something, I went down to the promenade bar in the afternoon. Not only did they make me a bowl of plain rice but refused to charge me for it! They really care for their guests! ",5,2015,04,04
130,Not as good as our previous stay.,"We stayed for our second New Year's Eve in a row and we are still taking about how disappointed we are.
Check-in is always friendly and professional.
The bedroom wasn't nearly as nice as before, in fact it probably needed refurbishing.
But our biggest complaint has to be the bar-staff in the Promenade. Half the time they were just joking and mucking about amongst themselves and when you did manage to get served they weren't nearly as friendly and courteous as they should be for such an establishment. It almost ruined our evening.
The entertainment was excellent and breakfast the next day was faultless.
We have booked another London Hotel for this New Year's Eve.",3,2015,04,04
130,"Beautiful suite, a bit messy service but they made up for it","Absolutely loved the suite we had on seventh floor. It wasn't as quiet as Ritz though, I guess, they don't have sound-proof windows, but on the seventh floor facing the back of the building, it was ok. Only later in the mornings, noises of city started to come in. 
They made us to wait 45 min until the suit was ready, put us in a bar downstairs. The room key did not work and the person who welcomed us had to get another one. In the suit, there was someone else's name on the card with welcoming fruits. They compensated this by larger amount of fruits with a new card, complimentary ironing of the jacket, complimentary coffee in the bar. Not too much of the compensation, but we liked the suit so much that we didn't bother to complain. The rest of our stay went very well. 
We might stay here again, as we liked the place.",5,2015,03,31
130,Perfect Luxury,"Stayed here many times both for business and pleasure, alone, with my wife and even with extended family and children. It is in fact impossible to seperate the business and pleasure stays because everytime was a breathtakingly delectable pleasure. Meeting friends and colleagues whether in the lobby one of the resturants always left an impressive memorable impression. Alas, I haven't been able to visit again for sometime - either fully booked or are not able to guarantee convenient parking for my personal chauffeur and car.",1,2015,03,28
130,Very nice,"It's what I expected. The location is very good for the park, shopping, site seeing. The food was good, but not outstanding. Service was mixed - very high standard from some staff, but a bit below par from others. I'd be happy to visit again.",4,2015,03,27
130,nice,"excellent and elegant experience, very freindly staff. nice location quiet. very clean and relatively large rooms for UK standards. nice bathroom. will repeat defenitely 
breakfast needs improvement, very poor selection",5,2015,03,27
130,What's happening at The Dorchester,"We have been visiting the Dorchester for years, but something is happening and it's not good.  The staff on the reception and concierge/doormen are good, but what is going on with the waiting staff?  Either in the Grill (which although prettier since refurbishment has been disappointing food wise), the cocktail area at the end of the promenade has strange service, sometimes prompt and good, others slow with a lack of interest/effort.  We, one time, waited 20 minutes for our cocktails, when we were the only ones waiting for dinks and were sitting at the bar!  Our bartender seemed intent on looking out for anyone else's needs, such as spilt drinks further round the bar, talking to other bar staff (or arguing with them) and indeed wandering around!?  At breakfast, the food appeared only luke warm.  Staying a couple of times a year and booking a couple of rooms each time you would think at Christmas when it came to have some ""sweeties"" from the cute Christmas shop we could scoot in and get a bag without the feeling of being under intense scrutiny from staff.  A couple of large bags of sweets seemed to really concern them with us facing hard stares!!  However paying several thousand pounds for our short visit I felt they could afford 2 bags of sweets!, and we could have done without the disgruntled staff - are the sweets just for show?  Odd things like this were not good, generally, just didn't feel like a flagship London hotel should.  We always love our rooms and how they join together but that was the best we could say of this visit which I think, sadly, will be our last.  After filling in the client questionnaire on my return home and explaining our disappointments I didn't hear a word from the Hotel and can only assume they are happy to lose customers which they have in this case.  We are now looking at the Savoy for our next trip.",3,2015,03,25
130,"Tremendous - Lavish, extravagance","I was fortunate enough to stay the night here and experience dinner at Alan Ducasse's fabulous restaurant.
My husband and I arrived at gone 3pm, when our room should have been ready. It wasn't - so we had a bottle of champgne given to us on the house. That was nice, but we wanted to go to our room. So we got upgraded to a suite! This was very exciting - a suite at the Dorchester!!
Our room(s) were amazing - room 704 I can recommend. Two front doors and a lovely huge fireplace. I have attached some photos of the elegant decor. 
The only thing I would say - the bathroom floor was incredibly slippery - I nearly fell on several occasions. Could have been quite bad.
The restaurant - Alan Ducasse was 'proper! Very exclusive and the courses were very nice. The overall service and food was exquisite. The bill, however was not so great :/ nearly £900 for four of us!! Expect to pay A LOT. I can thoroughly recommend the sea bass - melted in your mouth and also the duck foie gras was delicious. 
If you can, request the private table under the curtain - very private and you are surrounded by a glistening curtain.
I felt special here - it was luxury at its finest and I felt extremely lovely to be here. 
Obviously I will be going back again (someday soon I hope)",5,2015,03,23
130,"Very, very good.","Bang in the middle of London so parking is terrible, but shopping and access to the City is terrific.

Check-in and out were great and very fast. The concierge and door staff are very helpful. They look a little stand-off-ish but they're not.

The restaurants are all first class and very pricey. 

It's a little bit of a maze to find some of the rooms at first so maybe let the bell-boy show you the way.

The WIFI is excruciatingly expensive. But the business center is free.

The currency exchange rates are surprisingly reasonable. 

The business meeting rooms are clearly an after-thought. I'm guessing that these were once store rooms of some kind.",4,2015,03,22
130,Not at all stuffy!,"We were fortunate enough to stay at The Dorchester recently, and what a pleasant surprise! Everyone was very friendly (particularly the house keeper), the food was fantastic (the polenta dish was lovely) the flowers were really impressive, and the (refurbished) room was tastefully done - nice toiletries and tasty fresh fruit.
We had breakfast in the grill - although on reflection we should have eaten in the 'promenade' area. So, if you can afford it, give it a try, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",5,2015,03,17
130,Elegance and class,"Layers of luxury and details from rich fabrics and fine porcelain.  Located next to gorgeous Hyde park, this hotel is the epitome of elegance and class.  Steps from the fine shops of Mayfair and walking distance from the tube, we explored the city and retreated back to our palatial room fit for royalty.  The decor of The Grill is stunning and the food is outstanding and service was perfection.  Afternoon tea in The Promenade was the highlight of our stay.  Do not miss this exquisite tradition!  The staff are warm and knowledgeable in a place that might have been stuffy.  Nice job executing the feel of luxurious British tradition with warmth and kindness!",5,2015,03,16
130,Excellent,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at The Dorchester and the breakfast was excellent 
The staff were friendly & welcoming they were also very helpful. The superb flower arrangements were stunning
Looking forward to our next stay soon we hope
Thank you",5,2015,03,14
130,Yes superb ....but mass events in ballroom such a scrum,"Of course I love the hotel ....but a warning shot , attended a dinner for an awards evening and found it chaotic , crowded , poor service , terrible average food with just dire studgy lamb ...will not return for such an evening again ....",3,2015,03,10
130,Only name to know: Natalie!,"I stayed at the Dorchester this past weekend for the first time. I have stayed in various hotels throughout London, but there is a reason the Dorchester is, well, the Dorchester. It is synonymous with luxury, white-glove service, a superb location and extravagant rooms-- all for good reasons. Although I was only there for two nights and didn't get to necessarily enjoy all of the amenities of the hotel, I can say that it will be the only place I will stay when I return to London. The service was truly impeccable--- from start to finish. Checking in on the later side, Natalie warmly greeted me and escorted me to the room making sure everything was up to par. The following evening I arrived back to the room around Midnight with the room wreaking of smoke (very odd). I called reception where Natalie immediately sent up a porter to pack up my belongings and move me to a brand new room (upgrade, too!). No fuss, whatsoever. The beds were all incredibly comfortable and cannot wait to revisit! I now see why Kim Kardashian chooses The Dorchester for her London stays and can't wait to follow suite!!",5,2015,03,10
130,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea on the Balcony at the Dorchester for our Wedding Anniversary. I have to say it was simply fantastic. Vintage Champagne on arrival, Silver Service from our personal waiter, fabulous sandwiches prepared by the chef, beautiful cakes & scones. All in all a really great experience. Nothing was to much trouble, plenty of food as well. We've had afternoon tea in several places, but have never been offered 2nd's, & 3rd's of all of the courses !! To cap it all, as we were preparing to leave, we were presented with the most perfect cake with anniversary wishes from the chef & staff.
Clearly The Dorchester is not the cheapest place in town, but the whole experience made the expence well worth it.",5,2015,03,10
130,Love this hotel ,"Very nice hotel classic,good service, good restaurants my home away from home great location in the center of London almost everything is a walk distance..too bad took me long time to write a review. this hotel deserves a review every time I visit thank you !!",4,2015,03,09
130,What a wonderful place,"Booked with two friends for afternoon tea. I hadn't been feeling too well, so didn't have the afternoon tea, but was still treated to a lovely afternoon by the staff. They offered me alternatives which made me feel part of the celebration. The surroundings are opulent, but everyone is treated the same and no one made to feel they don't belong there. If I every win the lottery, I would love to stay here for a few nights!",5,2015,03,07
130,Chaine Returne to London,"For anyone who has any aspirations of entering the hospitality industry, go to The Dorchester and see how things should be done. It really is one of our favourite hotels. Every detail is handled with efficiency, yet with a friendly warmth. Unfortunately prior arrangements limited our eating experience to one breakfast, but even that is served with a style and elegance.",5,2015,03,04
130,Grand Hotel - Grand Stay,"It is my first stay back at this hotel for over 15 years even though I had visited for food and drink on numerous occasions during this time. The rooms are very classic, clean and a decent size. But what you pay for at the Dorchester is impeccable service and  quality food & drink. They deliver on all these counts. If you haven't stayed here and can afford it do it. Even if its only the once.",5,2015,03,02
130,excellent service,We went to the Dorchester on Valentines day my husband surprised me by taking me there we  had a fantastic experience the service and food was wonderful.  We have dined at the Ritz but found the Dorchester a lot nicer more lively and friendly.   cannot wait to return. worth every penny.,5,2015,02,28
130,TRADITION WITH A SMILE,"My family and I arrived in London for a five day holiday.Our rooms were not ready when we arrived,  so we went for a walk in the park.The front desk called about ten minutes later and we were given a wonderful upgrade.That is the Dorchester!!!!Perfect breakfast and do not miss the afternoon  tea. The spa is wonderful on rainy days.",5,2015,02,28
130,Comfortable but a bit tired,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Dorchester on two separate occasions.
The hotel is without question one of the grand old Dames of the hospitality field, comfortable, steeped in tradition, very good service, had two excellent waiters at breakfast time in the grill room and the food at Alain Ducasse was exceptional, but it is starting to look a bit tired and in need of a overhaul -interior furnishings and designs as well as technological(in rooms/suites) if the Dorchester wishes to retain its standing in the top hotels of the world",4,2015,02,27
130,Its the Dorchester. Need I say more?,"Its lovely. A winner every time. And I do mean EVERY single time. I've been here many times over the years and the Dorchester never fails to disappoint. An excellent establishment with well trained staff. I've seen some reviews complaining about the prices and I honestly think its very unfair. Its one of the top hotels in London - what on earth are you expecting???

The food is immaculate
The rooms are lovely
Staff are well trained.
And oh, the Grill room is just, just amazing!",5,2015,02,26
130,Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester,"We popped in here on spec after seeing Cirque du Soleil nearby at the Royal Albert Hall as we had a few hours spare prior to our train, and were all hungry, and interested to see how The Dorchester's tea would differ from the Champagne Afternoon Tea we had the evening before at The Savoy.

To our surprise, we were lucky and advised that we could have a table, but not for half an hour.  The lady advised us that if we went for a drink in the bar, she would come and get us once our table was ready.

So, we all trapsed to 'The Bar at The Dorchester' for a stiff drink prior to our cucumber sandwiches, or so we thought . . .

Even though there was 1 person mixing cocktails behind the bar, another filling up the nuts or whatever on tables, plus one other bar staff doing not much at all, we were completely ignored when we sat down at a table, and nobody came to take our drinks order.

This went on for 30 mins - we were waiting to see how long it would take before we were acknowledged.  Just as we were about to walk out in disgust, the nice lady from The Promenade came in and advised us our table was ready, so we left, without being served any drink.

I'm glad to say that once in The Promenade, the whole experience changed, and we enjoyed a delightful afternoon tea consisting of various finger sandwiches on brown and white bread, the infamous jam and cream rain scones, followed by a selection of cakes.  

10 out of 10 to the waiter who even went out of his way to bring us a special selection of vegetarian sandwiches for one of our group.

Everything was constantly topped up by the waiter, until we had to ask him to stop as we were full.

The selection of varied teas grown all over the world was too hard to choose from, so I opted for coffee, which I prefer.

In summary, Bar service very poor, service in The Promenade great.  

Comparing the two, I think The Savoy won, in terms of surroundings, service, quality and choice of food, but not on price.

The service rating is purely due to the lack-lustre performance experienced from the Bar staff.",2,2015,02,24
130,The Dorchester - Enough Said!,"My sister and I booked the Dorchester approximately 9 months in advance, just to give us something to look forward to at the end of last year.  We were celebrating our 30th and 40th birthdays and, after researching and reviewing various hotels in London we settled on the Dorchester.  It was the right decision! Arriving early in the morning our room wasn't ready.  We left our bags and went out and about.  The Dorchester phoned us to let us know our room was ready and upon arriving back at reception the reception asked us to bear with her one minute as she had a very special surprise for us.  She showed us to the lift, where another member of staff joined us.  On entering the lift she produced a plastic ""key"" from her pocket at inserted it into the Penthouse Suite ""keyhole"" on the lift panel.  Oh...my...days! We were then escorted to a suite ... but not just any suite (I'm going to call it the ""secret suite"")!  This suite had a bathroom, a guest bathroom, a formal dining room, a dressing room, a sitting room, a hallway and a master bedroom!  It ... was .... amazing!  We were then told that the other female member of staff who had joined us would be our butler!  If we needed anything we were just to buzz her either using the phone or the big red button beside the bed!  The suite was bigger than my house!  Just outstanding!  I can't say enough about the Dorchester.  Beautiful suite, lovely spa which we used on the Sunday, totally relaxing, beautiful breakfast, lovely cocktails.  They made it so special for us, everyone was so friendly and nothing was too much bother.  I have emailed them to thank them personally for having made it so unforgettable.  If you are considering going ... don't hesitate ... just do it!",5,2015,02,18
130,Simply Perfect.,"I had the pleasure of staying at this magnificent hotel twice this year ( End of January and last weekend ). Perfect service is the biggest accet here. Booked with Grand Luxury Hotels and received lovely benefits....From the moment you arrive you fell special thanks to the warm welcome provided by the staff. We were checked in by James at the reception ( extremely professional and very charismatic) he took us to our suite ( we were upgraded to the Mayfair Suite ) and presented the features of our ""room"" (very traditional English country style) . Fresh fruits , chocolates and a hand written letter welcoming us to to our home for the next 4 days... Service was impeccable : perfect housekeeping, amazing room service and breakfast delivered right on time every single day and the quality of the products were as impressive as the great service ..... We simply felt completely spoiled during our stay. It was hard to leave this Grand Dame behind.
Two weeks later we were lucky to be checking in again ( impressed with the even warmer welcome and the memory of the front desk staff - James 
again). We didn't get the Matfair suite but the deluxe king room was superb. Most importantly, the impeccable service was delivered once again . We can't wait to return to our new London home soon . I have just booked the Plaza Athenee in Paris ( also a Dorchester Collection Hotel) and it will be interesting to see if they can match the great experience we had at the Dorchester .",5,2015,02,18
130,Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea on the balcony a little less busy than the normal tea option.  We were served vintage champagne and the sandwich selection was beautiful, and the cake was superb.  The staff were friendly and very efficient offering us boxes to take home whatever we didn't eat.  Wonderful location for people watching I can highly recommend the Balcony afternoon Tea. ",5,2015,02,18
130,Afternoon Tea ,"Exceptional service, excellent quality tea, sandwiches,  cakes and scones. Spacious, tradional setting with a pionist softly playing. Gorgeous fresh flowers, beautifully decorated for Valentines. A perfect end to Valentines weekend break in London. We will return and this would make a perfect gift for friends or family.",5,2015,02,15
130,A creak or two behind the scenes !!,"For me, there is only one hotel in London, The Dorchester. 

It is wonderfully traditional, luxurious throughout and supported by multiple in excellent in house restaurants.

So when you come to London to stay for a few nights in cold and dreary January !!!!

I am often asked why do I no try one of the many other venerable places, most of which are within a stones throw so its not as if I would be moving out of the Mayfair - Hyde Park area. 

But change for change sake is not my mantra, I like routine as long as you get what you expect, and if you don't, the establishment do something about it.

One or two of the suites are needing serious attention a fact, I understand management are addressing, as they should for the prices they expect, and whilst it is easy to find fault and nit pick, trust me this is one seriously impressive hotel in the Grand Damn class",4,2015,02,13
130,"A week-end overlooking Hyde Park at The Dorchester, London","On my last visit to London, I had the chance to take the experience much further, and experience one of those unique, treasured « London moments » only The Dorchester could offer in such an exquisite fashion. 

What made my stay so special ? Staying in one of the hotel’s Park Suites, characterised by their splendid wood-panelled sitting rooms full of oh so British details and furniture, and distinct dining area providing an atmosphere of quality and tradition.",5,2015,02,11
130,An unforgettable experience…,"We stayed at the Dorchester Hotel for one night in late January as a New Year’s treat. Amazing doesn’t begin to describe it. The Dorchester exceeded all our expectations and is an absolute must for those in need of a little pampering.

The plush decor, spacious and luxurious rooms, a sublime dining experience in the Grill restaurant as well as a delicious breakfast were just some of the highlights.

However the strength of this hotel lies in its staff. We were greeted on arrival by a polite, polished and incredibly professional Front Of House Staff. The impeccable service and consideration we received from James (Front Of House) together with Pierre and Alan in the The Promenade was a delight. In fact every member of staff did their utmost to ensure our stay was a memorable one. A special thank you to the Laundry staff who not only pressed our outfits for the evening but successfully managed to remove a resistant stain that had survived 2 dry cleaning attempts elsewhere! 

An unforgettable experience…",5,2015,02,10
130,Beautiful ,I visited here on the 4th Feb for a work charity dinner. It was amazing. The staff who dealt with us were professional all the time. To get 500+ meals out hot and on time is an achievement in itself. The food was literally to die for! Very well done team Dorchester see you next year!!! ,5,2015,02,10
130,Myths & legends,"Welcome to Mayfair, Take a break to walk through the borough, in between Harrods and regent street (20 min), run around Hyde park in front of the hotel at 6 in the morning before opening your journey for the day.

A wide and spacious room, silent and comfortable! The old fashion British designed bathroom has an outdated charm, very well equipped, and full of nice products for men and women.

Room service 24/7 is ultimately efficient, and thank you for ironing my tuxedo's shirt.

Try the grill! Meat is fine, perfectly grilled, I recommend, the service team is extremely professional, also at the bar.

One tiny regret, no cigar lounge, but a taste of perfection.

130,Simply the best,"I always stay here if I'm in London (business or pleasure) and its simply amazing. A clear example of you get what you pay for. Beautiful, elegant suits, lovely food and excellent cocktails! I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2015,02,02
130,Classic,"I have stayed here on 3 occasions, this is my go to hotel in London. It is not the closest to the airport, but worth the extra time. The classic English experience, rooms are perfect service is amazing. First class experience all the way.",5,2015,02,02
130,A solid 5 star performance,"The last time we stayed at The Dorchester was in 1972 but as we lived in London we had no reason to stay at a London Hotel since. From the time we got out of the taxi with two door men helping us in to the reception staff all young but so professional who escorted us to the room and actually showed us how various controls worked. Very refreshing. Old style yet 21st century furnishings. Housekeeping staff on the floor and always about, the same for the lobby staff. We asked to see some other rooms the morning we were leaving to get an idea for future trios and none other than Boris the front office manager showed us several. True old world service.",5,2015,01,31
130,Superb Hotel,"From arrival you are treated like royalty.
The staff cannot do enough for you.
This is how all hotels should treat their customers.
Loved the cocktails and snacks in the bar too.
Well worth treating yourself if you can afford it.",5,2015,01,29
130,Best festive stay,Stayed here over the festive period. It was a very pleasant experience. Very cosy! Staff was great too. We had the afternoon tea downstairs and it was a lovely experience and our waiter was excellent!,5,2015,01,26
130,All a hotel should be!!!,"Great in every aspect. Excellent rooms, excellent staff, great restaurants (all of them!). 
Stayed with family during the holidays, my kids felt very welcome at all times, the concierge team indicated the perfect tour of London (extremely busy time during New Years), and arranged all restaurant reservations we requested.
There is no reason to stay anywhere else in London with such a perfect hotel!!!!",5,2015,01,25
130,Thank you for making my proposal so special!,"I wanted to make my engagement special, and where better to make it special than at the Dorchester. From when I contacted the guest services team, they were nothing short of incredible. 
On arrival, we were upgraded from a normal double room, to the suite. And I have to say, that the only hotel that comes close to the suite at the Dorchester is the panoramic suite at the Burj Al Arab. It was incredible, a dining room, living room, bedroom, bathroom, all as big as my actual room in my house. It was truly bewildering and mesmerizing. I was so happy. 
We enjoyed an incredible double massage in the very exclusive spa, and then enjoyed some nice tea and relaxation in the spa room. After that we enjoyed dinner on the promenade, which half way through, we decided to move to the room, which the team kindly did for us.
The chicken soup is by far the best soup anywhere around the world. It was out of this world. The chicken biryani was sumptuous- it was all more than expected.
Then whilst my now wife was out, somebody came in to put rose petals all over the bed, and then I proposed! It was perfect.
The professionalism, attention to detail and incredible service is why I chose the Dorchester, and you lived up to every expectation I had. I cannot wait to celebrate more of my life's key moments with you. You truly are the iconic hotel, not only in London, but in the world as well. Thank you!",5,2015,01,24
130,Just Wonderful,"My husband treated me to a long weekend at The Dorchester for my birthday and what an amazing hotel.

For the moment we arrived you can see that you are staying in a luxury establishment, staff are very polite and professional. 

We were booked in then escorted to our room and shown around. Our room was on the eight floor and extremely quiet, you wouldn't think you were staying in a large city.  The bed was huge and very comfortable, the bathroom was incredible with lovely soft white towels and a bath that was enormous.

We had afternoon tea while we were there and this was taken along the promenade, we chose the champagne afternoon tea and the selection of sandwiches and cakes were delicious as was the champagne.  We took breakfast in the hotel one morning and I did think it was a little pricey.  We also had champagne cocktails in the bar one evening and they were incredible. 

This hotel is in a lovely part of London and Green Park railway station is close at hand for getting around London with ease.

We had the most amazing stay while at this hotel and it made my birthday very memorable.  I hope I will have the opportunity to visit again in the not too distant future.",5,2015,01,21
130,Memorable Experience,"Stayed at the Dorchester for the weekend just before Christmas from arrival to departure amazing service. Have stayed at other 5 star hotels in London but none could come close to this hotel in terms of luxury and quality. From the rooms, bars, restaurants and lounges everything was perfection, and the staff were at another level to other hotels we have stayed at previously. Expensive but worth every penny. A particular highlight was the carol singing in the Promenade, really special and a brilliant start to Christmas. Can't wait to return!",5,2015,01,14
130,A Wonderful Stay,"We have returned from our stay at The Dorchester  this weekend with my 16 year old son for the night  with Afternoon Tea for 7 of us on the Saturday afternoon , What a wonderful , relaxed afternoon we had in their wonderful Promenade . 

Our rooms were huge and wonderfully equipped, The bath is enormous,   My husband had ordered champagne in the room which was perfectly chilling on ice for our arrival , My son was very happy with his room and probably got lost in the bed that evening ! 

We had a light lunch in the bar which is a wonderful and very snug area to enjoy perfectly chilled wine and Spicy Prawns for a snack .

The Afternoon Tea was lovely , lots to eat and enjoy and a huge range of teas to choose from .

We sat at our table chatting and drinking fizz until 9.30pm ( from 4pm) . As the table we were at was booked for dinner we were moved nearer to the bar area where there was a singer and musicians , it was a wonderful evening , very relaxing and great for people watching .

Our overnight stay was slightly disturbed due to the buzz from the machinery that heats the building , however I could not complain about this as the hotel itself is a wonderful and very grand place to stay in London.

We ate breakfast here , although not outstanding in any way , the room itself and the service cannot be faulted at all . We would love to return at some point .",5,2015,01,12
130,You get what you pay for,"Our local watering hole in London is the Promenade lounge at the "" Dorchester""."" The slick service and friendly staff, it's an oasis of calm when visiting London. Thanks to Kris the cocktail Barman for his usual friendly approach.",5,2015,01,10
130,My favorite place to stay in London,"We've been to a lot of nice hotels throughout our travels and though The Dorchester isn't the most opulent or most grand, it does have some of the most fabulous food, service, and ambiance that we've experienced.  The service is better than at The Mandarin, the food worthy enough to travel half way around the globe for, and the service so impeccable that I was very sad to leave it and move on.  The staff were friendly, helpful and very accommodating considering we had children in our party and it's always nice when the hotel staff remembers your name and greets the children with a smile and a feeling like we are welcome guests.  Combine all it has to offer along with the location, and I can't really think of another hotel in London that I actually look forward to visiting like this one.  Their one bedroom suite is perfect for us - mom, dad and two small children.  I absolutely love their Indian dishes; better than in India!",5,2015,01,07
130,wonderfull,"we had 3 nights at the Dorchester arriving new years eve I have to say it was fantastic this is truly a 5 star hotel, we got married at this hotel in June and we hoped new year would live up to our wonderful experience we were not disappointed. If your looking for luxury look no further.",5,2015,01,07
130,Christmassy & Lovely,"Our visit to THE Dorchester was fabulous. As part of our Company Christmas Party it couldn't be faulted, the staff were attentive and extremely courteous. Dinner was just lovely and every aspect was first class. The hotel has to be one of the best in London, that is evident at every turn. Just to finish things off, I saw Hugh Grant at the coat check in so he loves it too!!!!!",5,2015,01,06
130,Excellent,"We had an overnight stay at The Dorchester.  We know its sister hotel Coworth Park very well but had never been to The Dorchester.  The Doorman and Reception staff were very helpful and friendly with easy check-in.  The room was newly decorated and was clean with comfy bed, duvet and pillows.  The room looked into a courtyard which whilst not the best 'view',it did mean that it was really quiet which is unusual for a hotel in the middle of London.  The only thing that was missing was a kettle/coffee maker, I know you can get room service but just something I personally would have like.  We did not eat in the hotel as we had other plans but had breakfast.  We did not fancy a full English but had the Dorchester Bacon Buttie which was delicious and can be recommended.  A lovely stay with friendly staff and comfortable room - whats not to like!",5,2015,01,05
130,good stay,"Had a good stay at the Dorchester, the service was good, although the breakfasts i thought could do with looking at.
good location for shopping as oxford street is a minute away from the hotel a little distance to the nightlife which is mainly around liester square and soho",4,2015,01,04
130,Brilliant made our year,"We stayed at The Dorchester for New Years Eve.  On arrival we were advised that we had been upgraded. We were then taken to the most amazing  beautiful suite overlooking Hyde Park, Park Lane and side road.  It was beautiful and spacious. With it's own large hallway, large beautifully furnished lounge with lovely fireplace,
Desk, sofas, chairs, drinks cabinet, dining room table and chairs seating 6-8 people. We also had all the latest technology. I cannot thank the hotel enough as this was the perfect start to a stay one could ever dream of. If we could have stayed longer we would have and definitely will be back. The service we received throughout our stay was exceptional and the best.  The bars are beautiful and choice of drinks excellent. The entertainment provided was great and memorable. The food and service at the newly reopened Grill was excellent and our breakfast in our room simply delicious. I was alo very impressed with the 3 hour laundry/dry cleaning service which is unique and a real value add to the hotel services.  Sadly we did not get time on this occasion to use the spa, barbers, hairdresser and gym which are all excellentl. However we hope to be back soon.  This hotel is the best and the Staff/management exceed all expectations and are the best in the industry.",5,2015,01,03
130,Wonderfully Amazing!!!!,"I decided to treat my mum to a stay at The Dorchester as a Christmas treat on Sunday 28th December. We had an amazing time, with all staff being friendly, warm and welcoming!! Our room (which was upgraded) was quiet, lovely and relaxing, with some little welcoming treats awaiting us as we entered!! Later in the evening we went down to The Bar to have a bite to eat and a few drinks.  The food was delicious, the cocktails scrumptious and the staff wonderful!! As always Giuliano was there to welcome us and he made us feel at home, as did the other staff and bar manager on duty, whose name I'm afraid I don't know!! Following this we had a Hot Chocolate in The Promenade before we retired to our room. This was very tasty and was made even more enjoyable by the presence of Bahu who continued to make our evening so special!! We can't wait to come and visit again in the near future!! Thank you again for a wonderful time The Dorchester and all your amazing staff!!",5,2014,12,29
130,The old lady,"We spent two nights at The Dorchester en route to a family party. The reputation of the hotel drew us. The lady is a little weary, the breakfast average, we shall not revisit, but we have the T-shirt.",4,2014,12,28
130,Great British institution,"My wife and I stayed as part of my employer Christmas party. The service was excellent all round, it makes you proud to be British. My wife was born in Brunei and pleaded to hear that the sultan still owns the hotel - very enjoyable ",5,2014,12,27
130,Food poisoning ruined stay!,"Was very much looking forward to staying at the iconic Dorchester Hotel. This was definitely on my list of hotels to stay in worldwide and I had been extremely excited about my visit.

First impressions were ok but not great. Check-in was smooth but on arrival in the room we found a letter addressed to another guest (Mr Long) and also one of our key cards didn't work. These were  minor issues, but something which shouldn't really happen at the Dorchester.

During our stay we had afternoon tea, evening meal and an attempt at breakfast (more of that later). Afternoon tea was delightful with an amazing abundance of sandwiches and cakes. Service was a little patchy with waiters bordering on the arrogant but this was the only time I experienced arrogance in the hotel. Food in the evening appeared to be of a very high standard with superb service. Breakfast again was amazing in terms of service but I only managed a small piece of toast as by this time I had succumbed to food poisoning which started in the early hours of the morning. My poor wife then had to put up with me being terribly ill and ruining our stay.

My bout of food poisoning lasted the best part of a week and resulted in me losing 7kg of weight and being terribly ill. Having had to fill in various food questionnaires linked to my illness I can only surmise that the relevant foods were eaten earlier in the day at the Dorchester (I hadn't eaten chicken previously for more than a week and chicken was deemed to be the source of the poisoning). 

Samantha (PA to the Director of Food at the Dorchester) has been very thorough in managing my complaint and dealing with me, but more than three weeks have passed since I initially notified the hotel of my food poisoning and so far they have provided me with no results (tests are still being carried out). This is somewhat strange as my test results were back within 48 hours! I can't help but think that I am being strung along until I lose interest.

What this event has taught me is that no matter how amazing the service or how good the setting, food poisoning is terrible and something that no guest should get. In my opinion the Dorchester was responsible for my food poisoning and absolutely ruined what should have been an amazing experience for both my wife and myself. The only positive is that I managed to keep the weight off for Christmas!",1,2014,12,27
130,Dorchester Christmas Eve!,"Is there any better place to be on Xmas eve? There can't be many better!.. Impeccable service, room, hospitality etc etc.. I think we'll have to make this an annual tradition! Also dined in china tang restaurant which was great... TIP: Due to us booking the day prior, we didn't get breakfast included: Try and avoid this because it cost us £80 for two, which was a cost we could have avoided if we'd have been smarter on booking. Nevertheless a spotless experience ",5,2014,12,27
130,top notch,"As part of of christmas trip we stayed here for 4 nights.  The concierge team was extremely helpful with ideas for escaping christmas shoppers, getting last minute dinner reservations etc.  All staff gave friendly helpful service.  This hotel sets the bar extremely high for others.  Our room was remarkably quiet, a great escape from the london noise.
Dining, an adventure, from the burgers in the bar to Alain ducasse 3 Michelin star restaurant.  Although expensive we felt it well worth it, and are looking forward to returning in the future.",5,2014,12,25
130,Lovely venue,"A second time of having lunch at their top restaurant in the Hotel. A lovely venue throughout, an interesting range of dishes which are fairly reasonably priced for their quality. The wine list of course is rather expensive (understatement) but only to be expected. Service all excellent, although things became a little tense when a second bottle of £250 wine was returned as having a significantly different nose to the prior bottle (which we still had as a comparison to show). Anyway, that aside, all lovely and a very enjoyable lunch, with the staff being very accommodating when it ran into early evening! ",4,2014,12,22
130,Different class,"Spectacular, friendly, great service, great food. I love the grand old London hotels and The Dorchester is among the very best. The staff were fantastic and were all really enjoying their jobs with smiles on their faces. Great to see. Our car was parked for us and they even took care of the congestion charge. Nice 'Christmassy' feel to the place too. This is NOT the cheap end of the market but if you want yo treat yourselves I'd defiantly recommend this hotel, well worth it. First class.",5,2014,12,20
130,"""Absolutely Incredible""","We just loved every single second of our stay, what a fantastic weekend,  
We hadn't been for about ten years, so where should we go to celebrate our  Wedding Anniversary, where else? THE DORCHESTER, Park Lane  It's not possible to do anything but to relax and be pampered by a wonderful team, from the moment you arrive, until we left,  nothing was to much trouble What fantastic service with a team who all seem to perform their duties expertly and quietly with true diligence and style. From the moment you drive up to the entrance, you know why this hotel is one of the top hotels in the world it's a totally luxurious experience. Our room was huge, with an enormous bathroom, dressing room, and so quiet for the centre of London we slept in silence all night long, the bed was so comfortable we could have stayed forever.
This is a truly a wonderful place to stay  in fact my favourite trip to date WE WILL RETURN SOON! 
Top tip make sure you book your dinner reservation well in advance as All the restaurants are very popular and always booked up.
Top top Tip The sister hotel in Milan (Hotel Principe di Savoia ) was as nice with fantastic service as well.",5,2014,12,15
130,Bucket List,"I've wanted to stay here since I had dinner in 1978! And it not only lived up to but exceeded my expectations from the moment I stepped out of the taxi until the moment 2 days later, when I regretfully left for the next stage of my holiday. The service was exceptional without being 'smarmy', and the food both at Alain Ducasse and China Tang utterly blew me away. As did the hot chocolate from Room Service when I finally succumbed to my jet lag. Lovely comfy bed too. I'm coming back! I guess the only thing missing was a kettle, but I suppose Dorchester guests are too posh to pour!",5,2014,12,14
130,Mixed feelings on our second visit.,"We stayed for 4 nights as a triple occassion for us as a couple. We previously enjoyed a visit 4 years ago and vowed to return to celebrate our special occassions having had such good service previously.
Overall, the service and food were very unpredictable. The hotel is lovely but spells of poor service, food and lack of respet for guests tainted our second visit.
Breakfast in the Grill came out as a wrong order twice, and when I did get mine eventually, the food was cold.
The staff were kind enough but were unable to understand orders much of the time and we didn't want to make any fuss and humiliate what was already a rather diffiult situation so I ate cold eggs and bacon from a cold plate with cold toast.
Evening meal in the Grill was more successful but subsequent food in the Promenade in the evenings again came out cold; had run out; was a long time coming. We entertained friends on 2 of our 4 nights and felt a little embaressed. Our main complaint though is that guests appear to have to take a back seat to customers who have booked afternoon tea and hang around untl late. On several occassions, we wanted to just sit and have a pot of tea in the Promenade to be told it was full, the bar was full and as there is no tea making facilities in the room, we had no further options but to sit and wait. Bearing in mind that there is also a minimum room service order of £25, ordering  pot of tea for 2 would amount to 12.50 each.
Positively, some of the male waiting staff in the Promenade were lovely and very friendly; the check in desk staff were also very sweet and kind. Rooms are of a good standard (one would expect this of course).
Given the high price tag and amount of 5 star hotels in the area of Mayfair, we would likely look elsewhere when we come to London again. As a guest, I do expect to be able to sit quietly and have a drink in  hotel lounge/bar and read a book or paper after a long day out-particularly if this is not provided in the rooms. It is a shame.",3,2014,12,08
130,Perfect weekend,"I've always dreamed of staying at The Dorchester once in my life, and (as an early christmas present) we stayed there for two nights. I must admit, I found it a bit daunting to enter the high-class world of The Dorchester, but I needn't have worried. The staff was incredibly friendly and made us feel very welcome (even though we don't look rich at all). Unfortunately, we had some problems with noisy neighours, but Emma (the front desk manager) was very helpful and understanding and enabled us to move to a very quiet and comfortable room (with all kinds of amenities). Thank you to all the staff (and Emma especially) for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",5,2014,12,08
130,Pure class,"I had the pleasure to stay here on the 28th November for a black tie dinner with work. 

The welcome was amazing and our room was ready at 11am which was a lovely surprise as we could settle in before doing a little Black Friday shopping. 

However as we went to leave the room, the door handle came of in my hand and we were stuck!
A quick call and two lovely gents came to our rescue and we were on our way.

We also had afternoon tea which was amazingly lovely and I hope to go back again to have afternoon tea soon.

The black tie event was super and again the team were very attentive and nothing was to much trouble.

We took breakfast in the grill and to say it was disappointing is an understatement. The highlights...late food, uncooked, no milk, no toast and on and on.
However I mentioned this on check out and within a couple of hours the manger was on the phone to apologise and to ask me to contact him next time we go to the Dorchester. They also didn't charge for the breakfast before we checked out due to my complaint.

We would return again and it's a hotel that doesn't matter how rich you are or how you look, it just makes you feel welcome and very special even if a few hiccups happen as they normally do in life! 
But they still made our stay fantastic, hope to be back soon.",5,2014,12,07
130,Loved Every Moment!,"I suprised my husband with a stay at the dorchester as he has always wanted to stay there. I booked a supreme king room and the hotel suprised us on the day and  upgraded us to a Dorchester Suite with views of Hyde Park! Husband was over the moon, he had a Birthday cake waiting in the room and they threw in breakfast. We had such a magical experience.
We have stayed at many 5* hotels around the world and this has to be one of the best. The staff and service was amazing and I can't fault a thing. Thankyou so much Dorchester. Miss you!!",5,2014,12,07
130,Staff training needed,"My wife and I stay regularly at London hotels and have stayed several times at the Dorchester in the past, although recently we have preferred both Claridges and the Savoy. Anyway we got a good deal on a 3 night stay in an Executive deluxe king which promised, according to the Hotel's own publicity, Mayfair or Hyde Park views and a walk-in shower. However, on arrival my wife was shown to a room (240) with a view of air-conditioning units and a shower perched over the bath. The room also contained a hand-written note welcoming somebody else to their stay at the Dorchester. He presumably hadn't wanted room 240 either.
A complaint to reception resulted in an immediate transfer to a lovely room (209) overlooking Park Lane and with a walk-in shower.
Breakfast the first day took one hour and 10 minutes to have one bowl of porridge (requested cream missing), two poached eggs on toast, and a cooked English breakfast (requested mushrooms missing). We were asked four times if we wanted a bakery basket by various staff, presumably because they took pity on us sitting there with no food although there was an apology for the long delay. 
We had had breakfast the first day in the newly refurbished Grill room (which is a major improvement on its dingy predecessor), so on the second morning when asked whether we wanted to have breakfast in the Grill room or Promenade opted for the Promenade only to be told there were no tables available there(why were we asked?). When asked how long a table might be the answer, believe it or not, was a terse ""when somebody leaves"".  Even allowing for the fact something may get lost in the translation with the almost exclusively foreign staff, and accepting that I might have been in a very slightly grumpy mood, I am afraid this was too much for me. Despite being on a breakfast inclusive rate I went out for breakfast - my wife stayed without me and reported no problems with her day two breakfast.
Hopefully tomorrow's breakfast will work for both of us!",3,2014,12,07
130,food for thought 77,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, and found it absolutely wonderful, with  nothing to complain about. From first stepping into the hotel, at approximately 11.00am and not expecting our room to be ready, we were told it was, as I had put an approximate arrival time on the reservation form, and we were taken to our room by a young man, who took pains to show us round the room.
We dined in the Alain Ducasse restaurant, which was an experience. The food was fantastic, and the service wonderful.The cost? Wait for it. Including 2 pre dinner drinks, and a nice bottle of wine at £65.00 and 2 A la carte meals the total bill came to £280.50. and a further service charge of £35.06 added. The total cost of our stay for 3 nights came to £1259.00.(Dining only once in the Alain Ducasse restaurant) We thought that it was exceptional value for money in the middle of Mayfair. 
Overall, the service is second to none. The breakfasts were very special, The Promenade were we took breakfast is wonderfully decorated, particularly the fresh flowers. From beginning to end. First Class. Well done.",5,2014,12,05
130,re my review UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED,"want to thank the Dorchester for offering me another nights stay and breakfast for two  in light of my  review for my 50th birthday night of disappointment

I'm very grateful that they have tried to compensate me for my experience....looking forward to staying there again on a happier note this time",4,2014,12,03
130,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at the Dorchester for an extended weekend break as our son was getting married at the Dorchester. The experience was absolutely wonderful.  The staff and food we excellent and could not be faulted in any way. We have visited many places in the world and stayed at 5* hotels in the past but the Dorchester comes out at the top.  Although not cheap, if you want a memorable experience book a few days -  I would not hesitate to stay again",5,2014,12,03
130,Excellent Customer Service,I had a chance to stay at The Dorchester for one night and I have to say it was excellent. The customer service and attention to detail were definitely highlights of the stay in addition to it being a luxurious property. The sandwiches at tea were lovely. I can't say enough about how great the overall experience was. ,5,2014,11,30
130,Didn't live up to expectations ,"We stayed for 1 night for a Christmas event held at the hotel. The service was patchy with a lack of communication between departments. A request to put our luggage in our room and hang up a dress while we went out as the room wasn't ready when we arrived was agreed but didn't happen. A change to the time of a tea booking was confirmed with the restaurant then we were rung up to ask where we were at the previous booked time. 
The room was a bit tired, the bathroom window wasn't double glazed and it was very noisy, the sink plug didn't fit. No tea or coffee in the room which given the cost was surprising. On the positive side the shower was great and the bed very comfortable. 
Overall it didn't live up to its reputation and we wouldn't choose it over many other great hotels in London. ",3,2014,11,29
130,Wonderful !,"Totally and thoroughly recommended - Service, dining, etc..... We always are made to feel very welcome at this hotel/restaurant ..... Cant really say more - But well worth a visit and expriencing one of the best !",5,2014,11,28
130,Simply one of the best!,"An absolutely fantastic experience, from the moment I arrived until the moment I left.  If only everywhere I've stayed took a leaf out of The Dorchester's book!  The service was impeccable, the room absolutely fantastic and you can't really get a better location in London.  Although it's not really going to happen every week, these were moments to savour and I'm looking forward to the next time I have a chance to stay here!",5,2014,11,23
130,"Happy memories, good service - Asia better!","Stayed for one night stop-over - linked to a business trip to USA from Asia. 

No longer used to UK pricing of hotels (have lived in Asia for 20 years now) but coming back to the Dorchester (where we used to hold parties in the 1980s) was fun.

Park Land hotels are much smaller than Asia counterparts. 
But beautiful traditional English service (from young European staff).

Room was quaint - with pristine but quaint bathroom.  Plumbing was fine.
Was allowed to check in early - since landing at 6am and arriving 8:20am - for 10am Piccadilly meeting.

No big gym, no pool.  One glorious steam-room in the basement - so long as no-one else joins you!  
Best bit was location - walking around Buckingham palace at 6am - before the crowds. And using the Boris Bikes to go to business meetings.   

Breakfast was good - but in tea-lounge setting. 
Funny how many PRC tourists are resident - who order beautifully packed take-away breakfasts!

High Tea was a complete disaster - because our re-union group size was 12 people.  High tea only works for two to four people max.   Hotel staff do not have infrastructure to provide top service to large groups - the coffee tables are the wrong size for big groups. 

Hotel brought back happy memories of parties in the main Ballroom - but as a private expense - exceptionally expensive (vs Asia) - but OK pricing for London.

Cute animal statues in from of Hotel (probably temporary?)",4,2014,11,21
130,First class experience,"A real treat staying at The Dorchester with my mum and daughters. Very traditional and tasteful surroundings, excellent service and the place to be around christmas time.
I would definitely go back, hopefully soon.",5,2014,11,21

130,Amazing experiece,"I have recently attended an all day wedding here.  Absolutley fantastic, the staff are definitely first class and so very courteous.  The wedding room for the ceremony was absolutely stunning, in the evening this was transformed once again into a fairytale room with the most amazing lighting, table pieces, music, smoke from the smoke machine,  The atmosphere was so special.  Walking into this room was a fantastic treat.  Well done to all!",5,2014,11,18
130,"Wow, wow, wow","If you are planning on staying anywhere in London, this IS the place to stay. The best staff, the best food, the room was incredible. Everyone is friendly, everyone is approachable and all staff are the best in what they do. THIS HOTEL IS THE PLACE TO STAY.",5,2014,11,17
130,Majestic,"I booked this hotel for my fiancé's birthday after discreetly finding out to stay here was on her 'bucket list'. In fact it had always been a dream of mine to stay at The Dorchester having eaten at The Grill about 2 years previously.

The hotel is majestic and has to be the top hotel of it's kind in London. I actually found it to be pretty good value for money in terms of the room cost which may surprise many readers. I selected their 'weekend escape' rate, £295/night but inclusive of breakfast and found it to be extremely competitive against the likes of The Ritz, The Goring, etc etc.  Considering the location, the quality and the high level of service from it's staff I never felt that anything was a obscenely priced. 

We stayed in a superior king room (328) and one of the newly refurbished rooms and for me, it was exactly how a room in such a hotel should look like. It was elegant and grand with high ceilings and a marble bathroom and a huge bed. 

We did have a slight issue with the room on the first night, despite November temperatures it was quite stuffy and warm in the room over night even with air-conditioning so I left a note for housekeeping to check the air conditioning because the room had been to warm. Unfortunately upon our return to the room later in the afternoon we found that the air conditioning had been set to 27 degrees and the current ambient temperature of the room was 25 and going up! I spoke to reception and explained the problem and they informed the manager that was on duty who came and spoke to us. An engineer was organised and a sincere apology regarding the misinterpretation of the original request to housekeeping and some complimentary drinks in The Promenade were provided while they sorted the room. They also offered me a change of room if the temperature wasn't falling to our desired level. 

After the engineer had been, we returned to our room to get ready for our dinner reservation at Brasserie Chavot later on that evening and found the room temperature was thankfully falling and when we left for dinner it was much more tolerable. The same manager, Andrew, spoke to us as we were leaving and explained he would hand it over to the night manager and a room had been set aside for us should we want to change rooms after we returned from dinner. However that wasn't necessary and we continued to enjoy a pleasant stay.

I specifically mention this slight issue with the room because for me the problem with the air-conditioning and the subsequent sauna setting for the room were dealt with professionally, efficiently and reasonably by hotel management and I am pragmatic to understand that mistakes get made but for me, it's the way they are resolved which is the true test of customer service and something that The Dorchester did not fail on. 

A special thanks to Andrew, who's surname I have forgotten, but he went to check our room while were at dinner and left a note of apology and some petit fours which was a nice gesture and the way he dealt with the whole incident was great. The best part is that I am confident that  I would have received a similar high level of service from each and every member of staff from that hotel.",5,2014,11,17
130,Outstanding,One of the best ever.  You really think you have arrived.  Great dining.  Clearly one of the worlds best.  Rooms elegant ; most luxurious baths you have ever seen.  Staff outstanding.  Can't say too much about this hotel.,5,2014,11,15
130,Excelent,"Hi I had dinner 2 weeks ago. I really enjoy the dinner. It was really decorated. Service was outstanding . I have vegetarian on both stater and main. My table no was 26 by the ballroom entrance. The table was served by one Asian guy . I forget his nam most prob Ahmed,abdin or something like that. The things most encourage me about before he served me the food he ask me for to make sure About the dietary. And offer me to enjoy the meal. Thanks him for everything. I was trying to find the guy to give him tip but I couldn't find him anymore after the desert been serve. Thanks",5,2014,11,15
130,Home away from home,"Activities in town are always demanding. To remove the worry of commuting after the theatre and evening enjoyment, it is best to remain in London. The Dorchester is the perfect place. Peaceful, comfortable (the best beds), perfectly discreet and approachable staff. I adore wiling away the  hours of the ""day after"" with tea and company before returning home. Always wowonderfully relaxing.",5,2014,11,08

130,Solid experience - might need some light refurbishments,"My stay there was almost a perfect one. The staff was so helpful, the service was perfect and the quality of my night spent there was really good. I think they might need to simply revamp a tiny bit the furniture for the hotel to take it to the best level. Other than this, nothing say. China Tang is the best Chinese restaurant in London to me, the location of the hotel is ideal and the crowd is very selective.",4,2014,11,07
130,Magnificent Grand Lady,"We have stayed twice this year and have enjoyed both visits.   We had a suite with a park view.  There are several dining options, the small bar has the best staff.  The fitness center is fine and the location is unbeatable for restaurants and shopping.  Even though the hotel is large it never felt that way.",5,2014,11,06
130,Grand!,"A lot of positives had already been said so no need to repeat.  Just to reiterate, this hotel is def 5* and there is nothing cheap about it, literally.  We were given a night as a gift and we initially inteded to stay put at the hotel to enjoy it's surroundings but everything on the menu is sooo expensive so we went to Traders Vic. @ Hilton for drinks, where cocktails were half the price.  
Full english b'fast would set you back £40 each...
I guess my point is, people that comes here dont need to worry about costs, we do.  So although we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, I doubt I will book it again, if done PA.  ",5,2014,11,04
130,Londons Best,"This is a classic hotel with superior service. The dining is first class. The rooms are elegant with some of the best bathrooms in Europe. A very expensive decision to stay here but compared to others it's worth it.

130,Living (and cooking) The Dorchester Dream,"For the ultimate experience The Dorchester is the “go to hotel” in London.  I was very fortunate to spend 3 nights there recently.  Upon check-in I was upgraded to The Oliver Messel Suite, this is just the most amazing suite with a stunning terrace enjoying amazing views over London.  This suite also has the benefit of butler service, if only I had one at home!!
The service throughout the hotel is first class and all public areas are immaculate.
I also had the good fortune to participate in the kitchen master class with chef Henri Brosi and his sous chef Rosa.  This was the most amazing experience conducted in the main kitchens of The Dorchester, it was difficult not to be distracted with the other chefs working.  Cooking was followed by lunch and specially paired wines with Chef Brosi at the Chef’s Table in the main kitchen.  1st class lunch and wines, maybe too much wine!!  The finale was a stunning chocolate statue, everybody else on the masterclass was too polite to eat it, not us Northern Girls, we took it apart and took it home to eat in the office (as per pictures!!).  Big thanks to Henri and Rosa and the team for a fab day, we will be back.
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff here.  We had the last drink in the bar before departing, the bar staff did us proud, they packed us up some afternoon tea sandwiches to eat on the train on the way home, there were even enough left to pack my husband up the next day for his lunch.  
Big thanks to everyone for the most amazing time.",5,2014,11,01

However as I was celebrating a significant birthday and we didn't have time to have a proper holiday we decided to spend a couple of nights in London. After thorough research I decided the Dorchester was the place for us. We were not disappointed. On arrival I was told we had been upgraded to a Park Suite, which was huge. The bedroom was comfortable, the bathroom very clean and well appointed. We also had a sitting room, complete with dining table. All was clean and well maintained. I had a good Thai massage in the well-appointed spa. The Front desk were friendly, efficient and remembered who we were - quite an achievement in a large, busy hotel.
Slight niggles... The complimentary wifi was slow, and out of action for a few hours on our second evening. 
The breakfast menu seemed overly complicated. The quality of the food was very good but service was slow as things were cooked to order. It would not be possible to have a quick breakfast before heading out. The banana smoothie was disappointing, whilst the Orange juice was excellent.
The Dorchester contributed to me having a really memorable birthday, the highlight of which was dinner in Alain Ducasse. ( see separate review.)",5,2014,10,24
130,"Such detail, that you could miss how great this hotel is",I spent 4 days here in a suite and didn't want to leave the bed it was so comfortable. When I did though I was greeted by the most professional hotel staff I've ever encountered. I was greeted by name upon entering or walking through the expansive lobby / dinning area which is such a great touch. It's classic British old school and if you want that extra special touch of class the this is the place to stay. ,5,2014,10,23
130,Excellent.,"A wonderful institution deserving of all the positive reviews. Stunning interiors, beautiful suites and the most helpful lovely staff of all hotels I have visited. Happy to carry your bags, direct you and generally amazing service. The main bar is wonderful, the building is gorgeous inside and I can find no faults at all. We were upgraded to a massive suite on the house and had a 5* experience there.",5,2014,10,23
130,A superb hotel management,"The overall impression is that this is a truly well managed hotel. All personnel are discreet and, beyond their austere kindness, they have all answers ready at hand for any instance and they really give you the impression that they know exactly what they are doing within a sublimized range of perfectly efficient procedures that they struggle to comply with, to make everything work out perfectly. Personalisation of service has unquestionably been thought in advance in every aspect and it is offered in such a solid environment of detailed planning that they make you think it is absolutely natural for them to fulfill any request and that they simply can't miss it or go wrong anyhow. Which is not true, of course. But I can guarantee that if you point out an imperfection, you will be glad to see the precise and knowledgeable dedication they use to amend and regain their drive to perfection. In a typical British style of orderly elegance and planned efficiency. It made our stay congenial and enjoyable. Family asked me to prolong our stay over the weekend - we were celebrating an eighth birthday - so we stayed a total of six nights.
One drawback, we couldn't find a table for lunch in the main lobby restaurant. We were sent to the cafeteria, instead, which was very pleasant. But I still think that every hotel should have a number of tables available to their resident guests, and give them priority. Resting and eating at their best should be guaranteed to every hotel customer, I believe. 
Anyhow, the Dorch is a number one address in London, indeed, comfortable, safe and well located, and we will be back.",5,2014,10,22
130,Lose the Concierges and you will have a Great Hotel,"In September, tired of boutique hotels, chic, but without facilities, my daughter and I stayed at the Dorchester for four nights in a Deluxe Twin.  I have stayed there before, and have had tea there twice before as well. Early arrival was beautifully handled with an excellent cup of tea in the The Promenade. The Promenade is one of the most beautiful London venues with spectacular flowers and upholstery rarely seen outside of a real palace. But more on that later.

Our room was absolutely wonderful. It was in an irregular corner.  Very large, a fireplace, newly refurbished in restful and luxurious fabrics.  The room itself was reached through its own corridor, and off the same corridor was an enormous bath with two sinks, a bidet and goodness knows what else!  We were shown it by a competent and charming guest manager who enquired after us whenever we saw him.  Throughout our stay, the room was meticulously kept up by crisply uniformed maids overseen by The Housekeeper who looked like something out of Harry Potter.  Needless to say, little gifts and lots of toiletries abounded.

So far so good.  But....once you leave your room, service is, ah, strange.  I had dealt with the Concierge personally and on the telephone as did my travel agent. Knowing we would be tired, I asked for tea (specifying a good table) late in the afternoon.  We arrived at the time specified, but  had to wait almost half an hour in a cramped little spot for the table (actually, i found this a bit humiliating), and in the end, this produced  the closest table to the front door in the entire, huge Promenade.  There was no note that we were hotel guests.  When I mentioned this, there was an effort to seat us sooner....but the table was poor.  Mind you, there are no terrible tables, but, a great hotel works these things out for guests.  The English Afternoon Tea scene, which I recently endured at the Ritz has become crowded, with wave after wave of people dining.  Obviously an enormous money-maker for all hotels, but, goodness, does it have to be made so obvious?  The food and service were good, by the way, but certainly we did not feel in any way special.

Back to the Concierge.  First of all, they kept getting times all mixed up. We had asked for a particular recommendation for Sunday night.  They brilliantly came up with the Biggest Tourist Trap in town, Simpson's!  Go, by all means, if you like that kind of thing, but a person with multiple little symbols on their shoulder need not involve themselves in this kind of nonsense.  They also couldn't get the time we wanted at another restaurant several weeks ahead, and when we got to that restaurant, it would have been easy to get the reservation.  I do not think the Concierge ventured a telephone call.

And don't get me started on the hotel-arranged pick-up at the airport!  

None of it was horrible, it was just all sub-mediocre.  So, I decided to have a one-on-one chat with the Concierge (who was attempting a good imitation of an Edwardian butler) about these issues.  He sort of tut tutted, really, like in the movies.  I expected a nice note, perhaps with a mint or something...but of course not.

And, I wouldn't be bothering all of you with this nonsense, but I got a ""special"" ten- minute survey where I laid  these things out in some detail.  The survey asked if they could call me back.  I wrote, of course, and gave my contact information.  A month or so later, nothing.  Big Surprise.

So, beautiful hotel, with that side of the house, exquisite.  Food and service, both in the Promenade and in the Bar, outstanding.  The Concierges, however, are superannuated and clearly living on an imagined past.  Time for a change!",4,2014,10,21
130,Timeless Grandeur,"Stayed overnight at the Dorchester for a special occasion (I was going to propose to my Fiancee on the night at Restaurant Alain Ducasse). Everything was absolutely flawless from when I checked in to the moment we left the hotel. We stayed at the Park Suite with stunning views overlooking Hyde Park. Room was extremely spacious and the decor classy. Comparing other 5-star hotels, the Dorchester is definitely a class above the rest.",5,2014,10,20
130,Luxury in London,"Recently, I had the extraordinary good fortune to stay at The Dorchester. I usually stay at 3-stars or maybe, if I am lucky, 4-stars. This was a rare and unforgettable brush with exclusivity and luxury. If you can afford it, you will truly have one of the hotel experiences of your life. From the intoxicating aroma of fresh flowers in the lobby to the incredible cocktails in the bar, this is a place I will never forget.",5,2014,10,15
130,Seamless service,"We just had one night here (mainly so we could visit the Restaurant Alain Ducasse - see separate review) and the main feature was the service. From the time we arrived, somewhat frazzled, having come through heavy traffic, to realise we'd just entered the Congestion Charging Zone (which we usually manage to avoid), until the time we left (when our car reappeared, as if by magic) all the staff we came in contact with were excellent. 
Our room was very satisfactory and quite large, with really comfy chairs (unusual these days). The minibar had everything one might ask for (though we didn't actually use it). The bed was probably the most comfortable we'd ever slept in - suberb bed linen and pillows - sounds a bit silly to praise such things but they do make an impression. The TV in the room didn't quite work as it should have done (at one point the audio was only available in the bathroom, not in the bedroom) but it was fixed while we were at dinner. The bathroom had one of the most powerful showers I'd every experienced. We were lucky enough to have a quiet room, overlooking a sort of internal courtyard. 
After an extensive meal the night before we decided just to have the continental breakfast next morning - it was extremely good. 
I'd expected it to feel like a typically English hotel but somehow it feels quite international (certainly compared to Claridges). I'd certainly stay here again if I get the chance.",5,2014,10,15
130,Business / couples occasion - impeccable throughout,"We were in the ballroom or an afternoon corporate long service event.  From arrival to close service was excellent.  Staff were unobtrusive but polite and helpful.  From leaving our coats to finding our way to the rest rooms, all was professionally done.  This is the first place I have ever eaten in where I haven't had to turn away the meat option about to be put in front of me and remind the staff that I have ordered the veggie option.  That was impressive and meant I didn't have to feel awkward.  Food was put on the table with millitary provision.  Decor was lovely, bar staff and pianist great.  The only thing we felt a bit let down on was that we wanted to get a glass of champagne later in the afternoon, after the champagne reception had ended and were happy to pay but one member of staff said yes and then disappeared and the other said he couldn't do it - even though we said we had no problem paying for the drink and in fact the bar next door to the ballroom was freely serving champagne.  Other than that one blip though, we had a lovely day.",5,2014,10,14
130,Always loved this place,"Over the years, have been to balls and works dos here. Have eaten in the main resturant and had private dining. The staff, food and drink have always been the very best. Haven't stayed, would love to one day, but if you get the chance, I think this really is a top hotel. Enjoy.",5,2014,10,12
130,good deal,"relative to hotels like claridge's or the connaught, the dorchester was a very good deal, and a great location. booking through Grand Luxury Hotels site,we got an upgrade to an executive deluxe room, free full breakfast, and 100 pounds a night to use in the hotel. the room was lovely, the bath spectacular, and we got the room for early arrival! only minor issues: we didn't get the quiet room we requested [we were on park lane], the dorchester grill was closed for renovation, and i couldn't get a last minute massage in the spa. check it out!! M",4,2014,10,11
130,A five star hotel delivering 5 star service,"Excellent service. Food was mostly very very good. Catering for a few hundred people at an awards dinner cannot be easy. Salmon with pea shoots starter was delicious. The sauce with the corn fed chicken was exceptional. Desserts and petits fours were executed ok but quite  ordinary. Service was spot on and the best service at a big dinner I've been to. (Grosvenor, Marriott, Connaught rooms, Hilton park lane etc sometimes seem to have amateur jobbers doing it reluctantly for the evening). The area for the pre-meal drinks got way too hot and busy. The banqueting area was a perfect size where everyone could see and hear the speakers clearly.",5,2014,10,04
130,"Love, love this hotel ,","We have stayed in the Dorchester hotel for the pass 23 years every sept we go for my hubby birthday and I love it, the rooms are lovely bed is so comfy , staff are excellent  and so friendly ,  afternoon tea divine , could not fault this hotel definitely worth a visit",5,2014,10,01
130,Classy place,I stayed there for one night as the location was perfect for a Grosvenor House bash!  It's hard to compare it like for like to somewhere like the Langham or the Berkeley because they all offer something different. At the Langham we were upgraded to a massive suite too.  This place ouzes with class though and seems smaller than the Langham. Nice pillows with yummy feathers and what a comfy bed.  That's half the job done.  A well stacked mini mar with jellys and the Toblerone! Tickedbox.  The only negative was the room service fish n chips was small and watery! Would definately stay here again! The Massa outside might look nice too! Kieron on reception was particulary nice.,5,2014,09,30
130,Excellant,"We stayed at the Dorchester for the first time,we usually stay at The Savoy ,it was a excellent  stay and we really enjoyed the fantastic service and suite we had.
We will visit again in the very near future.
The service for afternoon tea and in the French restraunt was fantastic.",5,2014,09,28
130,Ultimate Service and Exceptional Comfort,"What can be said about The Dorchester that hasn't been said before ?
Not much.
I fully understand that one cannot satisfy all the people all the time ;  but one thing that few reviewers have commented on is that any deficiencies which are brought to the attention of the hotel management are immediately rectified with superior satisfaction.  This is just one of the points that makes this hotel one of the best anywhere.
Throughout the hotel, from the doormen at the front entrance to the housekeeping staff, the level of service is truly exceptional.  More importantly, service is offered with a smile.
Management has obviously invested much in training all the employees on how to treat guests and this pays off with a fantastic hotel experience.  Kudos are most well deserved.
We had the great pleasure of being shown to our room by the manager, Mr. John Scanlon.  This man is to be congratulated not only for his fine qualities, but also for the way he runs this establishment.  Over the course of a week, he greeted us very often (by name) in the warmest fashion, and constantly asked if everything was to our satisfaction.  Actually, everything was always beyond satisfaction !
The hotel is simply wonderful and truly one of the great hotels of the world.
One other thing worth mentioning is the sister hotel across the street, 45 Park Lane.  We went there on two occasions and found the atmosphere, service, food and drink to be outstanding.  It's a really cool place !
Whether you are in London for business or pleasure, you cannot go wrong by staying at The Dorchester.",5,2014,09,24
130,a little on the old side,"the hotel rooms are a maze to figure out at first and service quality at the front desk varies from really average to good at times. The concierge are definitely worth commending given their knowledge and ability to provide guests with timely advice.

My only gripe is on the price and the seemingly lack of attention for meeting rooms being booked for business meetings.",4,2014,09,17
130,So Refined.,"Ive had several very enjoyable visits. The attention to detail from the rooms to the barber shop is quite extraordinary. The location and the hotel's restaurants and bars - exceptional. A home from home, and a great place to conduct business meetings too.",5,2014,09,17
130,Business at my pleasure,"Awesome visit to this fabulous hotel, sadly I did not get the opportunity to stay however we did enjoy a large banquet meal for over 20 guests with a full show round of the hotel! What an amazing evening with great food fantastic service and one I would love to repeat with the wife! Thank you",5,2014,09,15
130,Very average for business,"Used conference rooms here recently for business.  Very average.  The room had no AC, they never came to refill beverages, service was missing in the afternoon.  We ordered food for lunch -- it was late, very expensive and not very good.  This hotel is for the mega-rich who don't know any better.  Skip this hotel.",2,2014,09,13
130,Top draw hotel in London...,"We booked a deluxe room for the evening, but we were given a free upgrade to the Oliver Messel a £3700+ per night room, we were told that this was Elizabeth Taylor's favorite room to stay in whilst in London (which added to the enjoyment of receiving the free upgrade).

The suite offered a 270 degree balcony and superb views of Londons skyline, a very large sitting room / dinning area and a gold themed bathroom. In terms of space you could not ask for any more, and this room would have comfortably catered for a family of 4.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful (along with being discrete, the porter refused to disclose the name of the famous celebrity staying at the hotel at that time).

The question is, would I have paid £3700 for this room for each night? The answer is sadly no. As nice as the room is, along with its history, the room itself is tired, and needs a refresh. We have stayed at many top hotels in London and around the world, and though prestige and heritage of the Dorchester cannot be questioned, it should not rest on its laurels in terms of the room decor.

Would I suggest you stay at the Dorchester? Certainly, I have a favorite hotel in London (due to its less flamboyant nature), but I'd firmly put this as my second favorite hotel in London. The promenade is unrivaled where you can eat and drink. Its also great if you want to spot a Bugatti Veyron, we had a gold encrusted one parked up at the hotel during our stay.",4,2014,09,13
130,Amazing five star luxury!!! Pricey but worth it.,"I love love love the Dorchester.   I stayed here two times last December and both stays were excellent.  The hotel is old world elegance and so close to everything in London.  

My specific London hotel experience is probably more limited but I travel a lot. The rooms are not particularly exceptional nor modern but beautifully appointed and extremely charming. I think the service and constant attention from staff makes me love the Dorchester.   Cost wise I think it's pretty pricey.  I had a corporate rate but hey who comes to London to save money???",5,2014,09,13
130,Pure luxury,"I was lucky enough to spend two days here recently for a training conference. We were not staying in the hotel but were here for two full days and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. 

The hotel in a word is stunning. 

When first entering the staff our absolutely wonderful, so helpful and friendly and as the two days consisted of various meetings and training activities we got to experience different rooms of the hotel - each one just as beautiful as the last. 

At the end of our first days training we had a huge dinner/dance which was amazing. Our company had clearly put in huge effort to organise it all down to the last detail, but the staff at the Dorchester made sure everything ran smoothly. 

I can't wait to come back here with my fiancé so we can experience the hotel from a non-business point of view and enjoy the champagne afternoon tea in such beautiful surroundings.",5,2014,09,12
130,"When I had a tie on they were perfect, with no tie rude and nasty.","If you want a stuffy, rude and uptight hotel this is your best option. It's the first and last time I will ever stay here. The property is old and tired and so are their values of people. I have stayed at many better places in London for less and been treated better. They need a renovation of both employees and the property.",1,2014,09,11
130,Excellent,"This Five Star Hotel is an Old traditionall England Hotel as you Know it from the Old Movies. Its in the Heart of the City in London and everythink is very close. You have an amazing view to the Park. The Service is Snob but very good. Typical english! By the Way, you can also Meeting a Lot of the High Society.",5,2014,09,06
130,"How do you justify a $1,200 room?","Staying at The Dorchester is certainly an experience of a lifetime.  It's a beautiful facility with exceptional service but it's also going to start at a base price of $1,200 US / night for a room.  The owners political stance hasn't impacted the population of the patronage either.  The hotel is a bustling hive of activity, glamour, beauty and power business meetings.

On any given day you're likely to find at least one Lamborghini and Bugatti parked out front which is a photo-op for London's citizens and tourists alike.

It's a storied hotel which boasts many an anecdote including being the choice for all of Elizabeth Taylor's honeymoons...

The food is delicious, the dining room and staff is pristine and there are many bars within the establishment where one can find a drink (but don't look for a proper pint on this property.)

It's clearly a property for those whom money is no object, but to those of us who still care about how we spend our Dollars, Pounds, Euros and Yen The Dorchester is tough to justify.",5,2014,09,05
130,Pure decadence.,This was a hotel I never wanted to leave after three days being totally spoilt. The staff are dedicated to making your every wish come true. The room was excellent although not large but every little extra was catered for like the beautiful bowl of fruit and a choice of current magazines in the room on your arrival. I would happily stay there again when I return to London. It's location is great for shopping a or a stroll through Hyde Park.,5,2014,09,04
130,AAAAA Service,Gorgeous hotel and fabulous service. It was a very expensive hotel due to the cost of the food but the experience was memorable. We stayed in a room that had not been updated and it was fine. I would have liked to see what a newly remodeled room looked like. We had a Junior Suite and it was huge!,5,2014,09,03
130,Thank you,My fabulous in laws cane to stay for a few days to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary and were treated with great kindness and respect. The manager even remembered to ask if they enjoyed their evening at the phantom of the opera. Just attention to detail . Thank you,5,2014,08,25
130,Amazing Family Experience,"I took my family to the Dorchester (my wife and two sons) and it far exceeded our expectations. I was concerned that we would be a little cramped in our room, but as they had upgraded is to a Mayfair suite there was no risk of that. The service was impeccable and the staff extra attentive to my children, although the valet service could have been a little smoother as my wife's umbrella and evening shoes were not brought to the room. After a couple phone calls and visit to reception, they failed to turn up meaning my wife had to wear her sandals with her dress to an evening meal. When we returned to the room the two had turned up and unfortunately the maid had not been yet to turn down the room - which was now too late as the children needed to go to bed. This didn't ruin our experience and is not a complaint and we were very impressed with our return to this great hotel. Hope to return soon! ",5,2014,08,25
130,Excellent but!,"We stayed in July for three days with our youngest daughter. Mix up on arrival led to an unnecessary wait, although we were given a complementary drink. Room was excellent couldn't find a fault. We ate breakfast in the bar area which although good was expensive. £34 each for my wife to have yogurt and fruit. We had breakfast in the promenade the following day and again charged full price despite my wife and daughter only having continental breakfast. We didn't say at the time and perhaps we should but didn't want to spoil what was a lovely part of our holiday. 
Had afternoon tea and a late dinner in the Promenade both of which were  excellent.
We also ate in China Tang which was fantastic.
Overall a fantastic hotel lovely public and private rooms ,great staff, and fantastic location. Just a little irritated over being what Americans would say ""nickel and dimmed""",5,2014,08,24
130,Mr john smith,"What a brilliant experience I had at the Dorchester, the room was beautiful and the people were the most pleasant people I've had the honer of meeting, at dinner my waiter Marvin was amazing, he catered to my every need nothing was a hassle for him, (give this man a promotion) will be defiantly be visiting again.",5,2014,08,20
130,Great hotel but the lobby lounge is a little gaudy,"The sleeping rooms are very nice, service is great, location is perfect for business travelers and tourists.  I had a lot of business meetings in the Promenade and it was a bit too frilly and old English - not very modern.  But many people love that about the Dorchester. The hotel restaurants are great and the event space on the first floor is excellent with an entrance right on the street level.",3,2014,08,19
130,Excellent Hotel for business or pleasure,"My husband and I have stayed at the Dorchester many times. I cannot seem to find fault with it. The staff is quietly competent and attentive. The high tea is quite an experience, particularly for people watching. The rooms are spacious and contain every amenity. The location is great; my husband and I walked all over London and always found our way back to the Dorchester with no problem. You can walk anywhere from this Park Lane location.",5,2014,08,19
130,Exemplary service where everyone is important,"Having stayed at other Dorchester collection hotels before and used the bar and afternoon tea facilities several times it was high time that we stayed at this icon of the London hotel scene. The perfect excuse was the RideLondon 100 which necessitated a stay in London and so the Dorchester was our chosen hotel.

Arriving with a cycle did not phase the team and it was safely stored until I needed it at 5am the next day! Check in was a pleasure and we were shown to our lovely room and made to feel valued customers - not always the case at other top hotels.

We had guests for Afternoon Tea and as always it was very enjoyable - the mini ice creams went down well with my nieces! Marvyn - our server - was excellent with a great mix of service and style with a smile - a true asset for the hotel. The tea was as would be expected - well crafted, plentiful and of the highest quality. cocktails in the bar preceded and followed the tea - the only disappointment being that the special ""lipstick"" cocktail was not available as they had run out of lipstick! My wife was despondent - until the next drink arrived!

Breakfast was a joy as should be expected and indeed I find that I do not need anything else until tea time after a lovely full English.

Whilst it is not cheap I would say that it is not expensive either. Especially if you can get one of the special deals offered by the hotel. I look forward to staying at the Dorchester Collection hotels again - perhaps next time I wont have to cycle 100 miles before 10:30 am during our next stay!",5,2014,08,19
130,Always exceeds expectations,"We have stayed here on many occasions and they are truly the experts in discrete and consistent service regardless of the type or cost of room we have stayed in. During the school holidays they also offer an adjoining children's room included in the parents room price which is exceptional value. They treat the children like royalty and they even get their own slippers and robes. Sometimes there are surprise gifts for them also which they love. Nothing is too much trouble, the beds are the most comfortable that we have ever slept on and the bathrooms are spotless. I would encourage people to try and stay here at least once in a lifetime and look out for their very affordable rates they have from time to time with their special offers.",5,2014,08,18
130,Not expected.,"The bad smell in the corridor was very unexpected and surprising. Also, I expected to have a tea in my room, this was disappointing as well. 
Otherwise the hotel is fine, clean and peaceful. The pillows are very bad. It is a very huge hotel, it seems like you are going forever to your room.
The hotel is across the Hyde Park, so there is an option for recreation. Also, in 30 minutes walking distance from the Piccadilly Circus area with bars, restaurants and shops. 
It is almost frustrating how this hotel has bad tube connection.",4,2014,08,13
130,Excellent Afternoon Tea,This is our favourite place for afternoon tea and far better than other London venues. We always take special friends to eat there in the summer. The selection of sandwiches and pastries is superb and the staff always offer a selection of teas which is the classic English afternoon tea touch.,5,2014,08,12
130,Hard to beat,"Over the last quarter of a century I visited London time and again ; for most of the time we used the Dorchester for obvious reasons . The quality of the property is enhanced by the quality of the staff and both were nicely preserved for long. 
As they open the door of your car as you arrive you feel the professionals . The glamorous way the lobby is ornate with huge flower arrangements , the incredible know-how of the concierge team, the attention to detail within the rooms and so on .
It is an experience hard to beat in London . It reminds me of the Plaza Athenee in Paris",5,2014,08,06
130,Superb service and location,"My wife and I had a very good stay at The Dorchester. Reception at arrival was very good. Our room, although nicely equiped, was at the first floor facing the roof of the ground. After a short complaint we were immediately given a nicer room at a higher floor. The team of concierges is the best we ever experienced. There is even a boot for direct purchase of theatre tickets. The breakfast is good albeit served either at the bar (buffet) or at the main lobby (a la carte). The location is very convenient, walking distance to Hyde Park, Mayfair, Piccadily and Knightsbridge as well excellent restautants in the neighbourhood. But the best experience is the afternoon tea: we were treated as lords! Actually the ambiance reminded us of Dowton Abbey. Worth every penny (or -lots of - pounds).",5,2014,08,05
130,Prime Hotel in a Prime Location,"My wife and I finished a month in Europe with 2 nights at this iconic property. Expensive, but fairly priced for Mayfair with the price justified be a lovely, spacious, quiet room with a view of Hyde Park, and friendly, impeccable service. Breakfast buffet was also outstanding with requests for non buffet items quickly met.
Weddings at the hotel did not interfere with the quiet which is critical for us.
We'll return.",5,2014,08,05
130,Christmas in London,"We decided to stay here for a few days with our 4 kids. We used the family room offer which including breakfast and we had 2 lovely adjoining rooms on the 5th floor. The hotel staff were exceptional - esp. at breakfast, the reception and the doormen. We loved the Christmas gingerbread house and sweet shop - that made the whole experience for the kids. The location is excellent for walking, getting buses and the underground. We were unable to have tea as was booked and would ensure we booked early next time. This is where we got engaged so is a special place. Hopefully we will get back for another special celebration.",5,2014,08,02
130,Pure Class,"The Dorchester is a first rate 5 star experience, ideally situated in London. I stayed there recently with my wife for a special occasion.  Everything was absolutely perfect, and the staff were extremely helpful, Rooms spotless and breakfast to die for. The whole experience was positive, and I will defintly return when next in London.",5,2014,08,02
130,London Classic - great for families ,"Good choice to stay in London. On the edge of Mayfair and across the road to Hyde Park. Under ME ownership it has lost its Englishness and fabled stiff upper lip so if you prefer a more subdued, exclusive atmosphere you'd find it flashy perhaps bordering on naff. Still a luxury hotel so rooms are lovely, service is superb. If you book through Amex it becomes quite a good deal. China Tang food is tasty. If you are pragmatic and don't look for what used to be but take as it is without doubt you will enjoy it. ",5,2014,07,31
130,Perfect overall.. But lost my shopping bags,"Stuff friendly and efficient .. Food is simply perfect in all aspects, rooms are cleaned , everything is very organised .. The only thing that I was annoyed about it that, me and my friends we were staying in a suite which has 2 doors, I arrived to the main gate with hands full of shopping bags , one of the doorman took the bag to send it to my room, I've waited for 25 minutes in my room, nothing came and when I called the reception and concierge , no one knew where's my bag.. After almost an hour of searching and investigating , they found one of the people down stairs, he opened one of the rooms doors and put the bags!",4,2014,07,30
130,The most special hotel i have ever been to,"This was our second dorchester stay and i had chosen it as the place to propose to my girlfriend, the hotel were incredibly helpful, they arranged everything i asked for and much much more, the room looked so beautiful, they organised an upgrade for us to a suite and organised chocolates to spell out marry me (which were delicious) and rose petals everywhere! the rooms themselves are amazing, so comfortable and they have everything you would need! the only thing slightly missing is that the tvs don't have the best range of channels or reception, but honestly it is a pleasure to stay in the hotel. from the beautiful flower arrangements in the lobby to the exceptional staff and rooms it is worth going for!

with special thanks to johanna in guest relations who bent over backwards to accommodate all of my requests and to the rest of the team who were so eager to find out the answer the next morning!!! (she said yes btw!)",5,2014,07,27
130,Disappointing,"My husband has wanted to stay at here for some time so on our return from Europe we decided to stay for one night and eat at the legendary Alain Ducasse Restaurant .

Upon arrival we were met by the wonderful doormen who offered to have our car valeted for us (it was quite mucky !) . We entered the lobby and hung around for a bit as it was very busy . After about 15 minutes we were given our room key and went off to the room, we had booked a suite and it was the most disappointing suite we've ever stayed in . It was like a narrow corridor there was no flow to the room, walking in you were faced with the bathroom , through to a very small bedroom, another door and a small sitting room another door and another bathroom . It was very dated in decoration and did not feel in any way luxurious , there was no view to speak of !

We had afternoon drunks in the bar and that was nice but a bit of a scrum to get a seat !

We dined at Alain Ducasse that evening which is a stunning restaurant and a great treat .

We fancied an after dinner drink but the Promenade was unappealing , it's corridor like with no atmosphere and so we skipped it and went to bed .

We had breakfast the next morning and it was not a 5 star experience , nothing came together , first we got toast , no butter , that arrived , then tea, my breakfast arrived but not my husbands. It was a bit comical really as all I could hear were people complaining alongside myself !

So we checked out feeling decidedly underwhelmed with our experience , I'm glad it wasn't for a special occasion otherwise I would have been very disappointed.

130,"200 Not Out – and a review fit for a King, Queen or Head of State!!","I was wondering a few weeks ago what my 200th TA Review would be. Yes, I know, a little sad….

A review of a Pizzeria perhaps?  A great hotel? Or what about a world famous sight? 
Well as luck would have it, I couldn’t have been luckier.  The superb Dorchester Hotel on London’s Park Lane and incredibly a unique fund raising lunch for the Beyond Food Foundation in partnership with Le Club des Chefs des Chefs!!

I must admit, I had not heard of the LCdCdC.  I soon found out that The Club is seen as the world’s most exclusive gastronomic society, and has extremely strict membership criteria.  To be accepted you need to be the current personal chef of a Head of State!!

The Beyond Food Foundation lead by Chef Founder Simon Boyle is an amazing organisation based in the restaurant called Brigade in Tooley Street, London SE1  Simon and his team work with people who have been at risk of or experienced homelessness to motivate and inspire them through an Apprentice Programme of Food Skills to gain meaningful employment.

On the day, 6 Apprentices had the opportunity to work in the kitchens at the Dorchester to prepare the superb 4 course lunch designed by the Club Chefs.  And my goodness what they prepared was fit for any King or Queen.

But, no pressure for the Dorchester Team/Apprentices, awaiting their lunch were the 30 Club Chefs INCLUDING those whose dishes they had prepared!

We kicked off with Ouef Drumkilbo, the recipe of Mark Flanagan, Chef to Her Majesty the Queen – not bad for starters.  Next up was the superb Pave de vivaneau rouge avec ‘Summer Succotash’, the creation of President’ Obama’s Chef, Cristeta Comerford.  The Filet de Boeuf aux truffes was beautiful, thanks to Guillaume Gomez the French President’s main man.  Last but not least Christiam Garcia who is Chef to His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco created a lasting impression with his Macaron Monegasque a la framboise.  Fantastique!

It should be remembered that this superb meal had been prepared by the 6 Apprentices with the excellent support of the Dorchester brigade.

Service was impeccable – just wished we could have stayed.  But we couldn’t.

So 200 not out – a bit like Joe Root really.  

Which makes me think why didn’t they serve Yorkshire Pudding, after all it was a Sunday lunch and as we all know Yorkshire is an independent state and is God’s country… food for thought.",5,2014,07,26
130,My favorite hotel experience ever.,"I've stayed in many upscale hotels such as the Four Seasons, W Hotel, etc (we're from the US) and I have to say that this is by far my favorite hotel experience ever! With upscale hotels you can receive great service but what makes this place different is that service is excellent AND sincere / genuine. Everyone from the doorman, front desk, house keeping and waiters are so incredibly kind and caring. We especially loved having Sandro as our server at The Bar Restaurant ...the breakfast buffet was incredibly delicious but Sandro anticipated all of our needs and made our experience so much better each morning! My kids adored him and even said ""they wish they could live here!"" Ask for the poached eggs, waffles and latte! The rooms are fantastic. Usually I can find a flaw or two but I can't find any here. Bed was comfy and clean, bathrooms spacious with great water pressure, nice closet, there's a refrigerator, they provide free water, fruits and sweets, and they even had a package for my kids which included an activity book, a book about London, etc)....just great over all! We are definitely coming back!!!",5,2014,07,21
130,Outstanding,"This is a wonderful hotel for absolutely everything.   The room we had was beautiful and spacious.   The service was really exceptional from everyone, and that is an understatement.   And then there is Alain Ducasse!   What can I say!!!!    Fortunately we are members of a SKI club (Spend Kids Inheritance) otherwise we could not have afforded it.   But if you take the top wine pairing you will be in for a treat of a life time.   Great white Burgundy (Chassagne-Montrachet) and red Bordeaux (Chateau Cos d'estournal), and finally, Chateau d'yquem, along with a few other great wines, including an unusual vintage Madeira (not my favourite but interesting).   Also in the hotel tried China Tang and in my opinion you should not bother.   It pretends to be a great Cantonese Restaurant, but honestly, it is a real travesty of that and I should know because I live in SE Asia.   It is  ""Cantonese food for those who have no idea what that is"".   Probably explains why there were no Chinese eating there....   Say no more.",5,2014,07,20
130,Grand Dame of London,"Convenient location for our summer sales shopping. Newly renovated room was nice with very warm colour. The set up is elegant with Bang Olufsen TV. Bathroom amenity is specially made by Aromatherapy Associates, London which are very high quality and give a good feel and smell. Breakfast is in the promenade and we did enjoy our breakfast with very good and friendly service. The highlight for us would be the service from Andy, Concierge before we arrived. He made every requests possible and Paul, another Concierge did some adjustment and turn the impossible to be possible for us. Front desk and door staff were efficient but not as warm and friendly as the rest of the team, which otherwise, it would have been excellent as overall.",4,2014,07,20
130,Very Nice London Hotel,"This is a very nice hotel and exudes a certain old-world London charm. My room was very well appointed, clean, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The concierge was great, arranging a number of requests and the front desk staff was courteous and professional. Meeting a friend at the Dorchester Bar was nice, as the staff was superb and the drinks made perfectly. Breakfast via room service was tasty and very quickly delivered, which was great as I had overslept and was in need of some quick nourishment. With so many choices in London for great hotels one can certainly not go wrong with the Dorchester.",4,2014,07,19
130,Perfect,"This hotel is beautiful, my room was like a palace and the breakfast I had delivered to my room was the best breakfast I've ever seen in my entire life! Fresh, delicious and plenty if it. Staff were helpful.",5,2014,07,19
130,Dorchester - so far best Hotel 'ever'!,"Well worth every penny spent and that didn't come cheap, but you get what you pay for and at the Dorchester I would say you get that extra bit more.  Brilliant from the time you left your car to be parked right up to the time you left and received one of their lovely pens as a remembrance. All staff were polite, accommodating and the food exquisite. Nothing was out of place and they made you feel like royalty from beginning to end.  Well done to all the staff and the Management that employed all the staff plus those behind the scenes, cleaners and all. The Chef's were excellent in all their food preparations, I only wish I could have taken a 'doggy' bag home. A very special time to be remembered, so a very big THANK YOU to you all at The Dorchester Hotel.",5,2014,07,17
130,Elegance and Service,My husband and I just spent a week at the Dorchester and it was wonderful. It is a quietly elegant place and everyone is ready to do anything to make you feel comfortable or help you.  The 24 hour concierge was amazing and helped us time and again to do the things we wanted. We especially loved the breakfast and luxuriated over it every day.  Our room was beautiful and quiet.  To add to all this the location in Mayfair is ideal for any London stay. You are walkable close to just about everything. I can highly recommend the Dorchester to anyone.,5,2014,07,10
130,An experience not to be missed,"We visited The Dorchester as part of birthday celebrations for my Wife's 60th. From beginning to end the Staff at The Dorchester treated us like ""royalty"". This Hotel and its staff deserve every accolade they are given. Anyone who is thinking of going there, dont hesitate. iTS NOT CHEAP but for a celebration its perfect.",5,2014,07,09
130,Great Weekend,"We stayed over Wimbledon Final weekend in a junior suite for two nights. The staff are brilliant, nothing is too much trouble and for a large hotel they make you feel like you are the only guests. From the moment we arrive we were greeted by friendly porters and doormen. Then the reception staff had us laughing and as we were early our room was not quite ready. No problem they whisked us off to the Pavilion for free tea while we waited.The room was excellent and even when I managed to completely flood the bathroom they just smiled and cleaned it up. The food is very good also. We dined in China Tang but that is a separate review",5,2014,07,07
130,old world elegance across Hyde Park,"Spend the weekend in this lovely property situated across Hyde Park. Reception was graciously polite, we were in a corner suite 517/518. Room service breakfast took a rather long 37 mins on a saturday for a continental order but bread basket truly fresh and worth the wait!",5,2014,07,07
130,another great london place,"excellent hotel with large rooms, and international guests, beautiful suites, amenities are up to scratch, gorgeous reception and efficient service, mostly a palace than an hotel,and great situation, near all the luxury shopping district",5,2014,07,04
130,Wonderful stay,"We just finished our visit to London, and  had a wonderful time at The Dorchester Hotel .  We love hotels
That are relevant to the places where we stay and London has a stiff competition as it has the greater number of best hotels in one city.  Also the most expensive in the world.  I picked The Dorchester  because it's location across  Hyde Park.  The history
As a traditional British  hotel and 
Well known service.  We were not disappointed,  the service is what makes this hotel wonderful.  From the moment we were greeted at the door  until we left.
The valet told us our rental car will
Need a special fee to drive our car
On days we are not supposed to, a congestion fee. They asked for the days we will be taking the car out
And took care of it.
Francisco at reception show us our wonderful rooms, the beautiful Promenade room  and even took me on a tour of the spa to see the
Amazing pearl chandelier and patisserie  room for tea while at the spa.  He was very pleasant  and kind  and very happy to show you
Around.  The ladies are the Promenade were also wonderful and helpful as we were late for our High tea experience , Rassa was our waiter for our table and she was most wonderful through this experience.  In essence they may you feel very comfortable in this wonderful establishment.  My last 
Comment  are the beds, they were the best we ever had, soft, the linen best quality and we slept  like babies.

130,WOW!,"It was the holidays and what better place to go than London! For shopping! At Harrods! We had a FUNtatstic time in London. We loved the sights especially Windsor Castle and Bath. 
This hotel is a WOW! From the suite, restaurants, amenities.....GREAT! The staff was warm and cordial. Love the afternoon tea....it's the best in London! The GM was great! Love it!",5,2014,06,23
130,Unexpectedly Average Afternoon Tea,"I got afternoon tea at The Dorchester as a Christmas gift from a relative. I've had a couple of afternoon teas before in London and this was quite frankly poor. The location, interior and service were excellent. The sandwiches were OK as was the tea. The deserts and scones however were really average. It seems trivial but the jam for example was really runny so provided difficult to use on the scones. A lot of the deserts weren't really that sweet and to be honest nowhere near what I expected. I had better deserts at a Hilton Double Tree afternoon tea once. It's worth a visit but not as good as I had expected. The Ritz for me is still by far and away the best afternoon tea in London.",3,2014,06,23
130,Wonderful stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the Dorchester, it is certainly a 5 star hotel. If your planning on a visit, afternoon tea is a must on your list. It's an excellent location for everything in London. Hyde park is just across the road if you like to walk or go for a jog.",5,2014,06,22
130,Spectacular,This hotel was absolutely magnificent... My room was amazing the bed was the largest bed I ever slept in... The hotel was meticulously clean... The staff was very accommodating no request was too small... Room service was absolutely fabulous... The beauty of this hotel is its location it is close to everything... The Royal Palace was within walking distance to see the changing of the guard... I cannot say enough about the quality of this hotel... This hotel is far from cheap however you absolutely get what you pay for....,5,2014,06,19
130,Amazing,"The nicest hotel iv ever been to and the rooms are wonderfully decorated and comfortable. The restaurant downstairs is delicious and perfect for lighter meals and then my most favorite place in the world is the underground Chinese restaurant where the food is beyond words. The staff are as you'd expect of a hotel of such high value and treated us more than well. Not a hotel to stay in if your looking for a traditional English place, but it's a lovely and luxurious hotel close to all the great Mayfair bars.",5,2014,06,19
130,Outstanding.,"Have just attended a wedding at this beautiful hotel and everything about the occasion was perfect. The food the service the ambiance the actual ceremony could not have been performed any better.
The room the bride and groom stayed in was stunning with two huge bathrooms a lovely seating area and a beautiful comfortable bed , All in all a fantastic experience.",5,2014,06,16
130,Birthday treat,"We stayed at the Dorchester on the 14th of June as a birthday treat. We arrived early, left our luggage and went sightseeing. We walked for miles and returned tired early afternoon. The reception was well covered with plenty of friendly and helpful staff. The enormous flower displays smelt and looked beautiful. We sat at the promenade bar with a cold drink as we were lucky the weather was very warm and sunny. Christopher the barman had worked in lots of countries and we had a very interesting conversation while waiting for our room to be available. We were escorted to the room where our luggage was In situ. The room was slightly smaller than expected but it was very well decorated in lovely colours and rich fabrics. The bathroom was all marble with walk in shower as well as a very deep bath and double wash basins very well done. We had our evening meal in the China Tang restaurant  in the lower ground floor of the hotel. There were too many tables and space between was very limited. My husband started with a sweetcorn soup with crab and cha Siu, roast duck platter as main dish, and both dishes were very tasty. 
I ordered lobster tail braised in bouillon but I only ate a small amount as it was horrible. As most of the dish was wasted I expected some kind of reaction but nothing was said and at £44, the dish was a total disappointment. The decor of the China Tang was exceptional and the cocktail bar also had a good atmosphere.
The Dorchester breakfast on the Sunday was 5 star for taste and service. 
As the location is also very central for shopping and sightseeing I would heartily recommend this hotel.",5,2014,06,16
130,Fantastic Stay...****,"Stayed at the hotel on the 5th June  for a luxury and well deserved birthday treat with my husband. Service at its best, friendly greeting by the doorman. Luggage literally disappeared on arrival we were upgraded from a superior king room to a luxury king so we were really happy.
Had lunch in the promenade, the yummiest steak sandwich. The pianist started playing happy birthday and a lovely chocolate mouse cake and candle arrived. Started feeling very special indeed. Headed to our room and was shown around by a lovely lady on reception, greeted by complimentary fruit and another chocolate birthday cake. A beautiful room with the deepest bath, that filled amazingly quickly.  Popped down to the Spa for a steam and sat in the relaxation area..bliss. Got dressed up for dinner, made the mistake of leaving the hotel. wish we hadn't, missed the professional service. Couldn't wait to get back. Was met in  the bar by a couple of good friends , finished the evening with a couple of Kir Royal's. A fab stay and a fab birthday..will definitely return again. Lovely for a special occasion or just to stay if you can afford it. My one and only gripe was I assumed that breakfast was included. Bit of a shock to find it would cost and additional £34 each for a full English. We chose not to have it, bit of a shame as it would have finished off our stay superbly. None the less we didn't let this spoil our stay and will definitely be back!!!",5,2014,06,11
130,lovely stay,"My third stay at hotel was  excellent.We had 2 interconnecting deluxe rooms which were recently refurbished, one with a modern look and the other with an art deco one.
Rooms-spacious with modern amenities and lovely marble bathrooms.
Location-walking distance to oxford street,piccadilly,hyde park,green park and many other places.
Service-extremely efficient,polite and helpful.
food-breakfast at the promenade was a fantastic experience,china tang food was worth the price,room service menu had a lot of choices even for kids.
gym-well equipped .
spa-expensive but massages were good.
This is the best city hotel that i have stayed in and plan to return soon.",5,2014,06,10
130,Disappointing ...,"Having tried the Dorchester hotel in LA and Paris and was very satisfied, I decided to give it try at the iconic Dorchester in London, and what a disappointment. I booked a deluxe king bed room, 2 categories above the standard room, and I was given a room facing a big air conditioning unit and the room was designed for handicapped guests. My request to change the room was rejected till the following day when I made a fuss that they agreed to change the room, and was moved to a smaller room overlooking the air conditioning unit from the 3rd floor :) ... The description in the room on the web site clearly indicated that a deluxe king should be facing Mayfair or the Park. This a deceiving description, and most certainly this property is not good value for money and for the budget better stay at the four season next door.",2,2014,06,08
130,Easily my favourite hotel ever,"I've never stayed over but have helped run events in the venue in the past and have eaten there on many occasions. The service, the quality and the experience cannot be beaten! It is simply stunning and must be visited, especially for afternoon tea and around Christmas as the decorations are beautiful.",5,2014,06,08
130,Very pleased.,I recently spent a night in this hotel with my husband and we were delighted with it. The lobby is opulent and impressive. The flower displays are the most beautiful I've seen in any hotel. We had a nice lunch in the bar and it was fun to people watch. The location is the best in London.,5,2014,06,05
130,Nothing short of Perfect,"My wife and I visited London to celebrate her 50th birthday.  We had previously stayed at many of London's finest hotels, but had not visited the Dorchester for about 10 years.  What a wonderful stay!  The staff could not have been more friendly and responsive, the common areas are opulent and the room was exquisite.  John, the hotel manager, was a gracious, thoughtful and generous host.  We will definitely be back!",5,2014,06,05
130,"Top Notch, as you would expect","Knew we would have a fantastic stay here and no disappointments whatsoever. The concierge was extremely helpful and we received a room upgrade which was unexpected.  Goodies in our room, free of charge too.  Didnt eat in the restaurants this time but did go to the bar for a few cocktails at the end of the night.  Have to say, the bar is o.k. but could be better in terms of ambience. Will definitely return here.",5,2014,06,05
130,Outstanding Experience,"We started off our 7 night European adventure with 2 nights at The Dorchester, which set the bar incredibly high for the hotels that we stayed in for the balance of the trip. Our experience was outstanding. The service from the hotel staff was unparalleled. Our room was spacious, and beautiful. We had breakfast included in our room rate, and it was delightful both mornings. The location next to Hyde Park, and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, etc. was perfect for us. The concierge arranged tickets to the London Eye for us, suggested other tours, and found a great pub for us to have dinner one night when we wanted to eat some casual food. Our 5 year old son was treated like a King at the hotel, and welcomed with a box full of activities and gifts that he was so excited to receive. Honestly, I can't say a negative word about our experience at the hotel. We will most certainly stay here each and every next visit to London. Totally worth the cost.",5,2014,06,03
130,Virtually flawless,"To be honest, I'm normally a Ritz man, and had only ever once stayed at the Dorchester. But last week we elected to spend three nights there......and in all fairness, it's virtually at the same level as the Ritz. The two experiences are completely different, as the Ritz is VERY old world, and in all honesty, a bit stuffy, while the Dorchester, despite being indisputably opulent, manages to convey quite a casual feel.....no ties required in the lobby, for example....or even jackets (in fact, it almost appears that anything goes in the lobby area, as I saw everything from dark suits to extremely casual clothes).

The rooms (we had two, with one for the kids), are fairly plush...though my wife felt obliged to opine that they ""looked like old lady's rooms"", no doubt in reference to the no doubt-intentionally classic decor. Having said that, I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with the rooms, and the common areas are fantastic. I commented to my wife that the hallways reminded me of the Beverly Hills Hotel, which I love. Sure enough it turns out that they are part of the same exclusive group.....so a bit of design crossover, apparently.

We tried China Tang, the Chinese restaurant in the basement. 'Very good (if not spectacular) food, in a gorgeous room (at about double to treble the price of your local Chinese....but the room and location explain that). 'Well worth a visit. Room service is of course over-the-top expensive, but also quite good.

The ONLY weak point, and it wasn't nearly enough to put me off giving the full 5 star rating, was the breakfast service in the gorgeous Promenade area. It's one of the prettiest hotel common areas I've seen....and a wonderful place to have a meal. The service, to be a bit picky, was slightly spotty. We had breakfast two days on the spin, and both days our first request for a high chair for the baby required a follow-up request. One day our table had a basket of various breads/pastries put on the table with breakfast......the next day, despite the same orders, no basket. A supplement of smoked salmon brought out.........smoked salmon. No bread, creme fraiche....no accompaniments at all...not even a lemon. We had some toast on the table, and used that, as our waiter was hard to find and it wasn't worth a fuss. 

One morning my son had a pancake, and it came with a lot of nice berries arranged on top. The next day......'the same order....but out came a plain, unadorned pancake (much to his disappointment). Again....a very minor gripe, but I'd have expected some standard quality control on these sort of things.

In a hotel of this quality, my guess is that we were just a bit unlucky and met with a couple of unusual (and admittedly relatively insignificant) shortfalls. And it's perhaps a sign of how good this hotel is that I can't find anything else to grouse about:-)

Anyway, I very highly recommend the Dorchester, and will no doubt be back.",5,2014,06,02
130,Luxury in London,"I'm so glad I selected this hotel for my most recent stay in London. From the moment we arrived, the experience was five star. The front desk manager asked if we were in town for business or leisure, and after informing him we were on a romantic getaway he swiftly sent a bottle of champagne to our suite. 

We stayed in one of the Park Suites, overlooking Hyde Park. Absolutely gorgeous, inside and out. The wood paneling in the sitting area was warm and chic, and the TWO bathrooms were well stocked and rather luxurious. 

The bed was perfection, and we slept like the dead after each day and nights' adventures. We enjoyed room service breakfasts, which were served in our suite's dining area. There was a proper space for everything, and we used each. 

I also used the spa and, once again, had a marvelous experience! I had a 90-minute facial with Valmont products (my favorite for facials!!) as well as a 60-minute massage. 

From start to finish, our stay was perfect in every way. While most certainly a splurge, we felt it was money well spent. You simply can't beat the location, luxurious quarters and amenities. Did I mention the Alain Ducasse restaurant on-site? Separate review to follow. Heaven.",5,2014,05,30
130,Not that perfect,"When you pay 850 quids for a night, you sort of expect the room to be ready when you check in at the 3pm advertized time. If the room is not ready, which might happen, you sort of expect not to be let to dry off on a chair without an offer for a complimentary glass of water or cup of coffee. The rest was ok, great yet smallish room with zero view contrarily to what I was led to believe, perfect service. As with so many such top notch 5**** hotels, if you only stay for a night, you're a 2nd class citizen compared to their uber-wealthy long-stay customers. Quid for quid, Holiday Inn is probably a better option.",3,2014,05,29
130,"First-rate service, good location, opulent without stuffiness","My husband and I recently stayed at the Dorchester for three nights while on a trip through England and France.  When Gloria discovered at check-in that we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, she upgraded us to an enormous and lovely Belgravia suite overlooking the park.  We had fresh flowers and fruit delivered to our room each day, as well as a beautifully decorated chocolate cake.  The public spaces are opulent but comfortable.  Breakfasts, which were included in our room rate, were delicious and so extensive that we skipped lunch every day.  The staff could not have been more helpful, friendly, and professional.  The hotel's location enabled us to walk EVERYWHERE (parks, Piccadilly Circus, shopping on Bond Street, Covent Garden, South Bank).  I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return.",5,2014,05,29
130,Excellence in Everything,"My wife and I regularly stay at the Dorchester and I'm glad to say that our recent stay confirmed the wisdom of this choice. You can take it as read that the standards of the facilities and rooms are exactly what you should expect from a prestige hotel. What is more worthy of comment is the outstanding quality of service which begins at the Check- in desk and doesn't stop until the door-men wave you off in a taxi at the end of the stay. Even although the Grill was closed for refurbishment, I'm glad to say that there was no noticeable noise or disruption as a result. Our meals and service in both Ducasse and China Tang were a notable highlight of our stay.",5,2014,05,28
130,Wonderful Stay,"The hotel has world class service, the check-in was great, the room was spotless.

We only stayed one night but we had a wonderful time.

The location is excellent just a few moments walk from Hyde park, a short walk to the shops of Bond Street and Knightsbridge

It's great to still see British hospitality at it's best,  there are always plenty of staff in the lobby to help you as well.

We ordered room service for breakfast which was also excellent.",5,2014,05,25
130,Lovely experience but meal cold,"I had  the opportunity to be a guest at a function in the Grand room of the Dorchester. The room was displayed perfectly. The waiters on arrival were attentive and kept your glasses full.
It's a shame the meal was a little bit of a let down. I understand they were catering for just under a 1000 guests but surely a hotel of this standing should be used to this. The main meal was just about room temperature, another notch on the thermostat and it would of been cold. It would of helped if we had been given steak knives as the steak was quite hard to cut and rather chewy. The dessert was boarding on frozen. Overall I have to say it was a lovely evening, they just need to take these comments as they are intended.",4,2014,05,25
130,"Famous, but with a reason","Earlier this month I spent three nights in The Dorchester. During the seventies my wife lived 4 1/2 years in Knightsbridge. Staying at The Dorchster was a dream for her. The hotel is unique, extremely stylisch, typically British, beautiful archtecture, decoration, every day fresh flowers, excellent service, attended a conference at The Dorchester, slept well,good facilities etc",5,2014,05,23
130,Best of the Best,"World class hotel, bar and service all around. Best location in Mayfair with easy access to Hyde Park, 10 minutes to Palace and good 'ole Pubs closeby. Excellent security. Not cheap but worth every penny. Added bonus - If you love oggling fine cars then their car park will not disappoint. Just don't touch.",5,2014,05,23
130,Experience traditional British style in the centre of London,"Located in the heart of London, you can expect a top level service on a luxury environment. Expect a traditional-style hotel with well kept rooms with on a classic atmosphere. Expensive as you would imagine, you will be paying the premium location and heritage.

130,Excellent Stay,Great break had at this Hotel. you pay for what you get and we certainly got it. Food service bedroom bar restaurant were top notch. the sound proofing was good to as we had a room close to the busy road. Shame there was no swimming pool as this would had been a 5 star rating by me but we did know that before we booked. Doorman welcome was excellent.,4,2014,05,17
130,"A well maintained luxury hotel, with friendly and (on the whole) attentive staff.","An enjoyable stay in a luxurious hotel, with a few lapses in service. Would I stay again – yes, however the lack of a swimming pool was a bit of a disappointment. 

Arrival:-
The welcome by the doorman, and reception was warm. Check-in was informative, with an offer of a brief orientation before being shown to our rooms. The hotel is very well maintained, with stunning flower displays in the main lobby and promenade.

The Guest Room:-
The Deluxe King room was a reasonable size. The bathroom, although small and with a rather strange layout (the toilet located behind the door), had a separate shower and bath. The bed was comfortable. The turn down service was average, noting the slippers are the worst I’ve been provided and certainly not the level of quality I’d associate with a hotel commanding circa £500 per night. See photos. 

Deluxe King versus Executive Deluxe King:-
Having booked two rooms as treating my parents to a few nights in London, I had opted for the Deluxe King for myself and the Executive Deluxe King for my parents. Aside from a slightly largely bathroom, and more recent décor, there was no noticeable difference between the rooms – certainly not given the ~£200 price premium for the Executive Deluxe.

The Bar:-
Good service; a reasonable selection of drinks and cocktails.

The Promenade:- 
For reviews of breakfast and afternoon tea in the Promenade, please see my separate review.

The Gym:-
A small gym for the size of the hotel, with a couple of treadmills, a bike, a cross-trainer, a couple of weight machines and free weights. Surprisingly the hotel has no swimming pool. 

Service:- 
Throughout the hotel, staff were friendly and on the whole attentive. However attention to detail was lacking on a few occasions. E.g. my parents being provided with a room which had a letter advising of a prayer mat, etc being provided (one had not been requested) and breakfast on the second day not having an unused place setting removed. Pretty minor but not what I’d expect from such a renowned hotel which commands such a premium.",4,2014,05,15
130,That's a Great Hotel :),"I went there in April for a WE, and it was really a great experience ! 
Beautiful place, friendly staff but very professional.

The only thing I would complain about is that we hear the cars on the park lane avenue from the bedrooms (maybe not all of them but the one I had), but don’t worry you can sleep even with this (little) background noise ! 

(Sorry if I made mistakes I’m French ! )",5,2014,05,15
130,Want to go back again,"best hotel in london you will feel the luaxury everywhere , room is the biggest in london and bathroom is nice marble, the staff are very helpfull 
the house keeping are the best , best clean i ever seen in london 
i cant forget how soft their sheets , i didnt have the chance to ask them about the brand 
the breakfast is expensive i wish if they add it to the room rate",5,2014,05,12
130,Turn down service is the best I have ever had,wonderful hotel and wonderful experience! turn down is the best -fresh bowl of fruit every night! it was just what I needed after a long day of shopping. the hotel can be a little stuffy (english) if you know what i mean.,4,2014,05,09
130,Fabulous weekend,"I have stayed at The Dorchester on a number of occasions and despite current negative media attention, it has never failed to live up to expectations and irrespective of who owns it, the staff are always very polite and attentive. We booked for a major birthday with friends and were pleasantly surprised that having asked for adjoining rooms, that we had been upgraded to a suite, with a four poster bed and balcony overlooking Park Lane along with a second bedroom, 3 bathrooms, a sumptuous lounge and dining area. We enjoyed a luxurious meal at Alain Ducasse, which whilst expensive, was a superb dining experience.  Breakfast in the grill, the following morning was from an extensive menu and almost took us to lunchtime. The most thoughtful touch was a beautiful birthday cake and handwritten card waiting for us when we arrived in our room.  A weekend my husband will never forget and we're just looking forward to visiting again.",4,2014,05,08
130,World Class,"Special World class 5 star experience.
Excellent staff, extremely professional.Nothing seemed to be a problem.Smiling, happy and genuine staff. Even the gentleman cleaning the brass was doing so with a smile.
Breakfast delivered to the room top class.
Room old fashioned chintzy decor which somehow added to the charm.
Can`t wait to return.",5,2014,05,08
130,The best of the best,"Staying or dining at The Dorchester is an exquisite experience.  From the first point of contact at the door and right through the hotel the staff greet you and assist you in a very friendly and efficient way.   The beds are the best you will ever sleep in, and if you've slept in a Westin Hotel bed you have been close to the best, but these are better.  Room Service is fast, friendly and not over expensive, given this is at the very top or the luxury hotels.   

The dining opportunities are several, from the legendary China Tang to the semi-casual Promenade, where traditional afternoon tea is served all afternoon. 

During our stay, we were reminded that even the best hotels can have selfish and inconsiderate guests when at 2.00am we had to ask the staff to deal with a noisy party in the next room.   This was quickly silenced, within 10 minutes, no more noise after that.   

I have held business meetings and seminars at The Dorchester regularly over the last 20 years, but rarely stated there, so I was pleased to see the exceptional standards demonstrated in their Banqueting and Conference dept is carried through in the bedrooms, the restaurants and the common areas.    

We will try and come back soon, but meanwhile, our thanks to the Dorchester team for a wonderful stay.",5,2014,05,07
130,So little to fault about this grand hotel,"We stayed in the Dorchester from the 3rd to 6th May for a special trip and it was a wonderful experience.
The room was tranquil and beautifully appointed, all the staff were lovely, they gave us an anniversary cake and fruit in our room, most of the food was delicious. 

Some small gripes would be that sometimes we didn't feel known by the staff as 'residents' of the Dorchester. I do appreciate the challenges of this of course but I wonder if anything could be done to make guests feel special? An example would be, when taking breakfast, for the staff to be aware that we haven't just walked in off the street and were in fact staying there.  

The only thing I did not really enjoy at this wonderful hotel was the afternoon tea. The atmosphere was wonderful but the cakes really rather disappointing. 

Anyway, it is the little touches that make this place special and it would be churlish to give this amazing establishment less than the full five stars it deserves.

Thanks to all the staff at The Dorchester who went out of their way to make our stay special.",5,2014,05,07
130,Simply the best,"This hotel is simply a dream. The staff are great, the rooms fantastic and the location excellent. This is probably one of the best, if not the best hotels in London. It is a real decadence. Lobby area is very impressive and leaves nothing to be desired for. Either having an afternoon tea or an evening drink you will not go wrong, on the contrary, enjoyment is guaranteed. The only thing that was slightly below my expectations, mind you they were extremely high, was an english breakfast. I have to be honest and say that I have had better in places much less expensive. But despite that, The Dorcehster is definitely a place to stay at least once in a lifetime, and if you can manage it, as many times as you can.",5,2014,05,05
130,Love!!!!,"I so love this hotel!  Our family stayed there for four days last summer and loved every minute of it.
The hotel is beautiful and centrally located.  The staff and the service is great.  We loved having breakfast each morning in the beautiful promenade.",5,2014,05,04
130,Fabulous time - When can I return!,"I stayed here for 3 nights in March and then 2 nights just last weekend with my children. Well I have to say that it was faultless. All the staff were attentive, chatty and pleasent. From the reception desk to the room service team. Most recently we stayed in rooms 240/241 which are 2 ajoinning rooms. Well they are just excellent. They were large with a long corridor joining the rooms. Well appointed and so comfortable. What more can you say.. We all had a fabulous stay..",5,2014,04,28
130,"Great hotel, perfect service, we will definitely come back","A perfect choice for a week end in London. Great location, refined restaurants. Standard rooms are nicely decorated. The only bad comment would be regarding the noise during our second night as there was a  wedding celebration.",4,2014,04,26
130,"very nice hotel, staff are a credit to the hotel",I stayed here for a night with my family when we went to London for the weekend. it is a very luxurious well designed hotel. on arrival the staff are straight away very helpful with our bags etc. The location of the hotel is very central but not too central to be in the hustle and bustle of London city centre. The breakfast and Chinese restaurant in the hotel are highly recommended. My family particularly enjoyed the smoothies at breakfast as you could pick whatever flavours and combinations you want. I was especially impressed with the design and decor of the hotel. Our room was one of the family rooms and was very spacious as it had two separate bedrooms each going off a mini hallway. the bathroom was very clean and spacious. My only criticism was that after we had been out for dinner our TV failed to work however due to the punctuality and fantastic staff this shortly was fixed. A fantastic hotel and after a long day of walking around London it was nice to be greeted by the staff and the immaculate rooms. We even managed to spot 2 celebrities during our stay! however i do think it is a little over priced for what you are getting.,4,2014,04,24
130,One of the world's finest hotels,"London has an incredible selection of very high quality hotels. I did a lot of research prior to making a choice since a week's stay at a 5 star hotel in arguably the world's most expensive city would add an extra column on my Visa statement.

I selected the Dorchester and stayed in a Junior Suite. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and welcoming during check in. I was accompanied to my room and it was large and very beautiful, decorated in stunning authentic art deco style. The construction of the hotel is such that it was considered a safe place to stay for VIPs during the blitz (worthwhile to read Wikipedia on the history of the hotel) and as a result the rooms (or at least the one I stayed in) are the ultimate sanctuary in terms of snuggling under the covers and sleeping soundly. The room did not have a terrace and it faced a beautiful inner courtyard, but also a large bank of ventilation fans.

Although the room was excellent, it was the experience of the hotel itself that is indelible. The lobby, the bars, the restaurants, the general magnificence of the place and above all the service of all levels of staff is the reason you stay at this hotel.

The location of the hotel is excellent. I am a runner and Hyde Park is right across the street, with a traffic light to take you across busy Park Lane and entrance to the park right across the street. It is a 4 mile run around the park, one of the most beautiful runs (or walks) imaginable. All major attractions of central London can be walked to (took me an hour and a half to walk slowly to the Tower Bridge which is the furthest you need to go). Most things are much less than that. Mayfair itself is so nice to come back to after the throngs of central London - and a great pleasure to explore especially in the evening. I love going to the pubs in the evening and there are some amazing pubs in Mayfair. I recommend downloading the ""London's Best Pubs"" App for your phone so that at any time you can hit the ""nearest pub"" button and it will show where you are on the map and the nearest pub and give you all the info. Cool spot five minutes walk from the Dorchester is called the ""Little Square"" with 4 or 5 top notch pubs all next to one another (""Ye Grapes"" being the most ""memorable"")

The Dorchester has 2 bars and 2 restaurants, and in addition to that has a slightly separate bar&restaurant called China Tang. I did not eat at the 3Mich star Alain Ducasse but I did have breakfast every day in the Promenade (lobby) which is extremely Downton Abbey-esque. The Promenade bar is a beautiful bar open late which serves food as well as ""The Bar"", and China Tang which are all stunning, opulent evening to late night options (also serving food). There are many other boffo bars close by at the Connaught, Four Seasons, Berkely, Claridges and Mandarin Oriental, all within a 15 minute walk (note - none are more opulent than any of the bars at the Dorchester). The service I experienced at all the restaurants and bars at the Dorchester was excellent. Never any attitude and always remembered my name and always very quick, witty and helpful. Food was excellent.

I have had the good fortune to stay at some of the finer hotels in the western world. This one is at the top of the list. Pack your best clothes and go!",5,2014,04,23
130,"Looked after impeccably, as usual","Having chosen to enter the London marathon we booked to stay in the Dorchester. 
The first time we have stayed here for a specific event, other than just for shopping and spending time in London. 
We were looked after with amazing care, as usual. 
Complementary water, flapjacks, bananas etc were all waiting in reception for us to take on the way to the start. 
The reception staff couldn't do enough, even printing out our result sheets from the marathon for us. 
Thank you, once again, for making our time with you so memorable for the right reasons.",5,2014,04,20
130,Anniversary stay,"Came back for our wedding anniversary and as ever,  a delightful and luxurious stay. 
The room was immaculate; all staff extremely courteous and helpful; guest relations remembered us from last year and gave us a room upgrade with an anniversary cake awaiting our arrival. In addition complimentary tea was delivered to our room. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing stay.
Dorchester understand the meaning of personalizing one's stay.
Definitely we will try and return next year.",5,2014,04,19
130,Excellent Hotel . . .Pricey but worth it!,"The Dorchester is an amazing hotel.  The rich and famous stay here for a reason.  We spent our Honeymoon in London and stayed at the hotel.  The Bar should not be missed.  Amazing décor and outstanding surroundings.  The Promenade is the heart of the hotel.  Flowers, beautiful furniture and statues are everywhere.   We had a deluxe room and it was decorated in a very British décor.   Our bathroom was huge and done in all white marble with an extra deep soaking tub.  This hotel is second to none. A+ across the board.",5,2014,04,11
130,Unforgetable one month stay,"I have stayed in The Dorchester for one month, i have heard so much about it but living the experince for a long period was just amazing, the classic rooms made you feel like you back in the 30's ( as seen in the movies). The service was great and the staff were very helpful, the awesome conceirge can get you in any guest list even if you have given them a short notice.

The location is almost in the middle of everywhere with a short walk you could reach to key sites in london.

Overall it was a wonderful experince.",5,2014,04,10
130,Blissful but expensive,"Top class and first rate, though disgustingly expensive. I visited through a recommendation from a family member and the experience  less the expense was good. I have stayed in more relaxed hotels with similar experiences around the world for a much more reasonable price. My lasting memory are the cocktails - very good but  exorbitantly expensive. Waiting staff are too apologetic!",5,2014,04,10
130,Possibly the best London Hotel.,"The Dorchester is a haven of tranquility away from the fast flowing life that is Park Lane, Mayfair and London generally.
Across the road from Hyde Park and a 15 minute walk from Knightsbridge with iconic shopping such as Harrods, Harvey Nic's and so on, this Hotel is ideally located for easy acces to ALL Central London.
If you like walking The London Eye (and Parliament) Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Royal Albert Hall, Horseguards, even Madame Tussauds are all in easy walking distance.
THE HOTEL
Rooms are generally in good condition, as for an Executive or Delux they have a bit more room than standard and usually have a seperate shower. Beds are usually enormous (unless you have twin) Most rooms are quite a walk from the lifts. 
Views from the hotel are limited as many have internal views, although some do have Hyde Park/Park Lane views.
The Junior suites are quite cramped.
Proper suites are large and well appointed, some have terraces with great views ( I was fortunate enough to receive an upgrade to the Sir Gorwie Beguin suite ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC)
Such a fantastic suite that it isn't even listed as part of their regular accomodation.
Service, food, luxury...all without fault.
Well worth the money, even though it is pricey...HINT..Book a weekend rate and get free breakfast.",5,2014,04,09
130,Lovely ambience- sets a new bar for service,"What can I say- The Dorchester is a lovely hotel, the doormen remember your name, the concierge offer a level of service that rivals only the best of the best hotels, the rooms/beds are comfortable and the hot water is plentiful.  My only suggestion would be to modify the bath products offered- they have a very masculine smell (husband loved this though).  Located in an ideal part of London.  Even though we have platinum SPG status, we would choose to stay at The Dorchester when we return to London.",5,2014,04,07
130,Lovely Experience But Disappointing,"I stayed at The Dorchester Hotel from Sunday 25th November 2012 to Wednesday 28th November 2012.

Our first impressions, as my partner and I arrived at the hotel, were that it was very clean and well presented. There were people at the entrance to greet you and take your suitcases, and we were made to feel very welcome by them and the receptionist. My only complaint was that the hotel required payment up front to cover the room and any expenses we were likely to incur during our stay, which we weren't pre-warned about. This caused embarrassment when my partner’s card declined as he’d ask for his funds to clear in time for the end of the holiday, not the start; so I had to put the payment on my credit card instead.

The room we’d paid for was £450 per night and we discovered we’d been given a free upgrade because we’d booked through grandluxuryhotels.com. We had been given a bottle of champagne and some canapés too. The space was smaller than I was expecting but was still a decent size. There was a king sized bed, along with a desk, side tables, numerous lamps, two chairs, a chaise longue, a small wardrobe and a television hidden in a cupboard. I was disappointed to discover that the television didn't actually have that many channels, but I wasn't planning on watching that much television during our stay.

I discovered we had to pay to use the Wi-Fi which I thought was ridiculous. When you are spending that much money per night I assumed the hotel would provide Wi-Fi for free.

There was a mini-bar in the room with various alcoholic and non-alcohol drinks, and there were snacks in a drawer. I was shocked to discover how expensive the items were – £6 per bottle of coke, £6 per packet of crisps, £10 for a jar of nuts, to name a few. There wasn't an area to make your own hot drinks which was a disappointment because I didn't want to have to phone for room service every time I wanted a drink, especially with there being a £3.50 surcharge whenever somebody brought something to your room.

There was a separate bathroom with a medium sized shower and a massive bath (apparently the deepest you’d find in the whole of London). The hotel provided us with dressing gowns, towels, flannels, body lotion, soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower hat and nail file. My only negative comment I would say is that housekeeping gave brand new items every day, even if they had barely been used, which I found quite wasteful – but I supposed others would want fresh products every day.

My partner and I decided to dine in our room for dinner. We chose our food by telephoning down to the reception and were told our food would arrive in the next 30 minutes. It arrived in plenty of time and was presented on a trolley, complete with tablecloth, which was wheeled into the room and acted as our dining table. The waiter organised our chairs and ensured we were happy before he left the room. The food was delicious, but very expensive – nearly £50 for a chicken Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza.

After dinner we decided to have a drink in the Promenade Bar. The staff were very friendly and were very knowledgeable in the different cocktails, but again everything was very expensive. My partner and I had two cocktails each and the bill came to £99. There was a man playing the piano which made the environment feel very pleasant and he chatted with us and took requests from the diners around the room.

To order breakfast we had to fill out a menu of our requirements and hang it on the door the previous night so it could be collected. I chose the full English and my partner chose the scrambled eggs with salmon which came with toast, croissants, pain au chocolat, cereal, fresh orange juice and a hot drink of your choice. The breakfast arrived on time, again on the table clothed trolley, and we were delighted with the amount of food on offer and felt it was definitely worth the money.

My partner and I spent a lot of time outside the hotel, sight-seeing and enjoying the Winter Wonderland. We would have spent more time in the hotel but it was so expensive we couldn't afford it. When I fancied a snack at one point I ordered a tuna sandwich and it was £20 so we had to limit how often we ate in the hotel.

For dinner the second night my partner and I ordered steak, mashed potatoes and vegetables; and a truffle & foie gras burger with chips. The bill came to about £70!! The steak tasted lovely and the vegetables were adequate but the mashed potato was disgusting. My partner thoroughly enjoyed his burger and chips though.

When we went to check out I was shocked to discover that the room service bill was just over £500! I honestly didn't think we had spent that much money. Along with the room bill the total came to about £1850 for the three night’s stay. I had always wanted to stay at The Dorchester as my dad had worked there when he was younger and I wanted to experience the hotel first hand, but I found it a bit disappointing.

Personally I would not recommend The Dorchester to any of my family or friends because I know they wouldn't be able to afford it. I could not fault the building or the staff; the environment was lovely and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. It was an experience but a ridiculously expensive experience and I wouldn't return as I don’t think it was worth the money.",4,2014,04,03
130,Top Service - Fabulous bed linens,"It's lovely to arrive and find that you have been upgraded to a nice suite with a living room and two baths. From the check in to the check out the service is impeccable, they greet you by name, they are polite to a fault, and pay attention; I used most of my body lotion and next morning they had left me an extra one. The bed linens are fabulous, lots of fluffy pillows. We left early in the morning and ended up forgetting the computer charger in the room, we stopped after the weekend and they could not immediately locate it, it happens sometimes, it's a big hotel... Well... They were so upset about it, made it their mission to find it, the manager John and the front desk staff were all over it. They found it and messengered to us. If I forget something again I want it to be there. The location is great, close to everything. The bar is nice and the bartender a great old school one. Would return again. One has to give thumbs up to top service. Thank you again. ",5,2014,04,03
130,A very special place,"A wonderful long weekend in a hotel that fully deserves its reputation as one of the top hotels in London. The service was exceptional from beginning to end, with everything made possible and easy. Being given an upgrade was a pleasant and very welcome surprise which made the stay even more memorable. Of course it is a very expensive place to stay but with a 3 for 2 offer plus the upgrade it was well worth it. Dining in the Grill was another terrific experience, as was afternoon tea in the Promenade. A return some day is a must. If you can afford it, go!",5,2014,04,02
130,The Dorchester - Meeting,"Exqusite hotel. The highest level of service possible. Amazing restaurants and bar reminding you of a time past. Champagne in the Promenade.
Greeted immediately at the door and efficient check-in. The room was on a high floor but had no view, that would be the only minus but after staying for 3 nights I never really missed it. Huge bathroom and comfortable room.
The Bar, Promenade and The Grill all delivered excellent products. I highly recommend to stay at the Dorchester.",5,2014,04,01
130,Perfection,"Amazing experience.

Took my fiance for her birthday and could not pick fault with a single thing. Service is amazing (concierge have even helped me since), food great and the room was stunning.

Even told reception it was my fiance's birthday and they bought up a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries (on the house) to the room 5 mins after checking in.

Simply perfection!",5,2014,03,31
130,Brilliant for the weekend,"Just spent a great weekend in town for a friend's wedding. All the arrangements were brilliant including a nice upgrade to a lovely suite due to the special nature of our visit. Flowers for the wedding were prepared and even my favourite Twiglets, which I cannot get at home in Switzerland were waiting for me. Huge plus to have 45 Park Lane next door of the same company for a lovely breakfast or great steak dinner at Cut and you can sign it back to your room. Staff went overboard to assist and many recognised me from a previous stay. Nice housekeeping touches like Aromatherapy amenities and complimentary Wifi around both hotels. Must try Coworth Park next time for their country house hotel. Will be back",5,2014,03,28
130,The best night and morning of my life!,"I booked The Dorchester for my girlfriends 30th birthday to really impress and it has to go down as the best night and morning ever. Situated in a great location, near enough to all the shops and some great views just a walk away. The reception is fantastic and you are made to feel special as soon as you arrive and the front door is opened for you. Once in the room you are welcomed with a massive bed and a really nice style of room. As it was my mrs birthday they also supplied a little cake which was a really nice touch. The bed felt like it was made of air and was big enough for each of us to stretch out. The bathroom was simply divine! Really deep big bath so you can relax and unwind or get ready for the big night out. After the best nights sleep i paid a little extra to have breakfast brought to our room. Not only did we feel so special but also very full as it was the biggest and best breakfast i have ever had! The bar area downstairs is a great place to start your night off with a cocktail or two although a little pricey they are really worth it. My mrs was extremely happy with her present and I was too as it was just the best place! Fully recommend it to anyone!",5,2014,03,24
130,Still better than ever,"Yet another stay at the Dorchester as good as ever. Considering the amount of time we spend at the Dorchester it is our second home in London. We were treated well from the moment of our arrival, we were upgraded to the top floor suite with a bottle of Alain Ducasse champagne to sooth our relaxing rest in the deepest of baths. We were resident for several days and I could not fault the service, every member of staff from reception to house keeping were wonderful. The maître d of the promenade breakfast restaurant was very attentive, pleasant and perceptive, he deserves a special mention as does Francois on reception. No doubt we will return again. This is still my favourite hotel in London and I have stayed at all the top hotels in the capital, and on occasion still continue to do so for variety and to compare.",5,2014,03,18
130,Wonderful Experience,Staying at The Dorchester was a wonderful experience.  The room was perfect and the customer service was incredible.  I had the most amazing food and wine.  I really look forward to staying at this hotel again in the future.,5,2014,03,17
130,Dorchester Charm,"Just returned from a week long girls trip to London and was fortunate to stay at The Dorchester.  The location is good.  Who doesn't love the Mayfair area?  It is a quick walk to Buckingham Palace, Harrods and more. 

We were upgraded to a junior suite which afforded us a lot more space both in our room and the bathroom as well with a double vanity, separate shower and bathtub.  Our room overlooked a courtyard which was lovely and very quiet.

The room was very clean.  They offer daily housekeeping with a nightly turn down service.

The service at the Dorchester is some of the best I have ever experienced.  Everyone (and I mean everyone) in the hotel is courteous, helpful and seems to genuinely want to make your stay enjoyable.  

Breakfast was included with our rate and was thoroughly enjoyed by us each day as it was fun to sit in the Promenade and people watch. 

Despite its formal charm, it is not a stuffy hotel at all.  We went to breakfast in our yoga pants each day and never felt uncomfortable or out of place. 

We did go to the Spa for massages.  It was nice but not quite what we are used to in the states as far as it was much more spartan and sterile (all white).  They do offer a steam room and a post relaxation room.  Once again, everyone was very friendly and helpful in the spa as well. 

The Bar was also fun and the bartenders were a wealth of information as far as good, non-touristy restaurants to try during our stay.

Overall, I would stay at The Dorchester again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,03,10
130,Glad we went back………..,After having been persuaded by friends to give The Dorchester another try I'm glad we did.  Everyone deserves a second chance. This time I could not fault the service that I received from each and every member of the Dorchester team.  From check in to check out and in between the service was exemplary. The hotel is placed in a perfect location to enjoy many of our fabulous capitals offering.  From a run in the park in the morning to dinner in the evening at 34 the hotel was perfectly placed.  We did have a problem with the first room and we were moved immediately and shown the room before hand by the front of house manager to make sure that we were happy before we moved.  We throughly enjoyed our stay and we are thinking of trying 45 Park Lane next!  Thank you Dorchester Group.,5,2014,03,10
130,Old fashioned rooms but still superb all around.,If you love your room to have a 1930s feel to it then you will love The Dorchester. Personally I think its a little too old fashioned. But the bathrooms are nice and the service is top class. Also The Promenade is beautiful and the bar and choice of restaurants is pure 5 star class!! Location is perfect and if you want a younger and more modern Dorchester experience their sister hotel 45 Park Lane is right across from The Dorchester,5,2014,03,10
130,"Nada Especial, mas el nombre","Solo me quede una noche, es muy caro, la habitación doble era enana, mis suegros también se quedaron una noche y su habitación enana también, decorada muy estilo antiguo, con muchas cosas, muy rimbombante...el bar genial, estaba Rod Steward tomandose una copa y se puso a tocar el piano!!eso fue lo único memorable, y la ubicacion.
We stayed one night, also my parents in law, the rooms are tiny and very old fashion. not value for money, the only thing that was great was the bar, we were there for a drink and Rod Steward was there having a drink and he got up and starting playing the piano and singing....that was great. Also de location.",3,2014,03,08
130,bitterly disappointed,"celebrated my 50th birthday 2days ago  and was treated to a nights stay at the dorchester by  my daughter.....waking up on the day of  your 50th at such a sumptuous establishment was indeed a treat for me  or so thought.
i was in room 841 which is adjacent to the automatic doors ad not far from the lift.
room was fab to look at, comfy , clean and a real treat to look at however the nightmare started when tried to fall asleep.
the banging and clanging of he lift and automatic doors kept me awake till gods cows what time. if ever i did drift off to sleep i would abruptly woken by the noise .
i woke up on my birthday with a horrid headache with the lack of sleep  and was bitterly disappointed because i informed reception and they did nothing to compensate.....thats why i wont be going back to the dorchester ...a nightmare birthday  that i won't forget.
must say however the room was beautiful but what uses that when you can't sleep soundly?
bitterly disappointed",3,2014,03,07
130,off the bucket list,"Its one of those places you just want to stay.  I am glad I did and had a great experience.  I probably felt a little out of place as everyone treated you like royalty.  staff are amazing,  A must stay for sure :)",4,2014,03,07
130,"AMAZING STAFF, FABULOUS HOTEL!","Last weekend, I treated my parents to a long weekend at this fabulous hotel,and along, with other members of the family, we joined them for various overnight stays. My parents were celebrating their anniversary and joint 80th birthdays, and the hotel couldn't do enough to make sure the stay was a trip to remember. 
We all had an amazing time, thank you to all the staff, and a special thank you to James on the Front Desk, who went the extra mile.
I would highly recommend this hotel, whether you want a weekend away, holiday or business trip.
Thank you again, and I wish the hotel well.",5,2014,03,06
130,Great hotel and staff,"We stayed and dined in the grill, only having the set menu, the whole experience was just wonderful, excellent service and food throughout our stay, we will recommend this to everyone. Can't wait to return, a big thank you to all staff.",5,2014,03,05
130,weekend at the dorchester,"Took my wife and companion for the weekend.we had a fabulous stay.
Terrific food,wonderful service from the staff as we watched the world go by in the promenadewhilst enjoying a drink.
The housekeeper for our room,112,was wonderful,as nothing was too much trouble.
the balloons in our room for the wifes 50th were made into a nice display.
all the staff were most helpful.
Hope to return in march.",5,2014,02,27
130,First Class Luxury Hotel - Simply Fantastic,"We stayed here for 2 nights in November as we had our wedding reception in China Tang at The Dorchester. We stayed in the Junior Suite and our families stayed in the deluxe rooms.

On arrival the service was impeccable and nothing was too much of a hassle. 

The room was lovely, we had a separate seating area, walk in wardrobe and lovely big bed. The bathroom in the junior suite was a bit disappointing, the deluxe rooms had a much larger bathroom in comparison but no complaints it was lovely all the same. I had a lovely bouquet of flowers left for me on the second night which was really thoughtful and you can understand why rich people get used to this lifestyle!

I had room service breakfast for the first morning and this was very nice indeed. The second morning I had breakfast in the dining room and this was lovely as well.

My stay was made even more memorable when I passed Michelle Mone staying on the same floor and she commented on how beautiful my dress was!!

Possibly one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in and if money was no object I would most certainly stay again.

Top luxury hotel and hopefully I will be back for our first wedding anniversary :)",5,2014,02,17
130,Well worth the experience,Love this place. Actually had my photo taken with simon cowel. Went there again for dads birthday/parents anniversary. They bought out cakes and sang to them. No matter who you are you're treated equally which is something I was happy about especially since we are from inner london estates and don't look or talk posh. Would recommend anyone of whatever class attend. Fabulous experience. ,5,2014,02,15
130,Customer Service,"I found the level of customer service second to none.they were always happy to help

Very helpful staff, always polite and obliging.

I went for a long weekend with friends and family food was always nice",5,2014,02,14
130,Wow!,"My partner booked a weekend stay for us as a treat and this was the best hotel we have stayed in EVER.  As ordinary people this isn't the sort of hotel we could afford everyday, but the standard of food, service and facilities made the cost worthwhile.  The promenade room was breathtaking and the afternoon tea something else.  Staying at the Dorchester you are left with the feeling of being transported back to another time. It provides a standard of service and service which is rarely experienced.  Highly recommended for the rich and not so rich!",5,2014,02,14
130,Good hotel,"I like this hotel & have a good location , beautiful room & good service . Tasty food , good lobby with bar . I recommend this hotel . 
The room has a soft bed with a canopy and a beautiful design. Good and rich public lives in the hotel. China Tang good restaurant & bar with real music near this hotel. ",5,2014,02,12
130,Fantastic hotel with exceptional service,"We stayed here for New Year Eve and also  last summer where we were  upgraded us to the most wonderful suite with not just one bathroom but two!  The service we have personally received is the best and has persuaded us to come back here during the past year and hopefully for years to come.  On site there is a small gym, barbers, hairdressers and excellent spa.  The only missing item is a pool.  The bar is beautiful, promenade area lovely.  All restaurants here are simply excellent.  The Dorchester Grill offering a very reasonably priced menu. Alan Ducasse restaurant is fantastic, food and service fabulous and worthy of its Michelin star status.  Similarly China Tang is fantastic, the restaurant and bar within beautiful with good food and service.  Having stayed at other lovely hotels in London - Claridges, The Savoy, The Ritz, Mayfair.  The Dorchester currently  overall offers the best value for us and highly recommend a stay.  In terms of service they have the edge and must now be the benchmark for others to aspire to.",5,2014,02,11
130,Luxury and indulgence... nowhere does it better!,"We stayed at The Dorch for my partner’s parents’ fortieth anniversary. What a wonderful day/night’s stay we had. We had booked two standard rooms however having informed the booking office of the anniversary we discovered they had upgraded the one room up three levels – yes THREE levels to a stunning suite with a balcony that looked out the front of the hotel, just above the hotel’s sign.

The concierge took care of all our bookings before arrival and even managed to secure a seat at Scott’s on a Saturday night (we had already tried to book direct but were informed it was fully booked) and they got us dress circle tickets at Sadlers Wells to watch Swan Lake, again, while the internet showed all tickets had sold out (they must have a very well connected concierge!). 
If that wasn’t all, the maître d’ advised one of the bottles of champagne we had for lunch in the Promenade was “on him” (approx £80) and my partner’s parents had not one but two incredible cakes delivered to their room iced with ‘Happy Anniversary’… just magical!

There really is no better place to treat somebody than the grandest of the old dames, The Dorchester on Park Lane!",5,2014,02,10
130,Overnight stay,"It was our first time at the hotel. First contact with staff was impressive as one would expect. As we were early for check in our rom wasn't quite ready so we decided to have a light lunch in the promenade area. My husband's steak sandwich with salad garnish was good but the falafel which I had was a little disappointing especially in view of the prices charged, it was a little overdone and rather crisp. An irritation to us was, as far as we could ascertain, that the VAT and  included service charge wasn't as obvious on the menu as perhaps it could have been, so for a snack and coffee cost over £55.00, pricey for what it was. As we got out of the lift each time we walked to our room there was an unpleasant smell of smoke although this didn't permeate the room itself. The room, a superior, was lovely, the bath huge but a real warning here for anyone of limited stature or mobility, it was a real stretch to get in with no handles to assist. I am tall and I really had to stretch to get into it. As the shower is an over the bath one this could prove difficult for some. The staff were all lovely, helpful, without any condescension and friendly. We had drinks in the promenade that evening as there was a pianist and singer, so a lovely way to end our evening. Breakfast was good although a limited hot choice for non meat eaters, the kipper I had was huge but very strong, perhaps a matter of taste but I couldn't eat it all which always annoys me as I dislike wasting food. Suggestions to the Dorchester would be have a clearer pricing structure, do something about the smoke smell which is very off putting and increase the range of allergy friendly vegetarian choices. Unfortunately but husband failed to mention any of this on the review form.",4,2014,02,08
130,Average food for vegetarians,"I have stayed at the Dorchester one day after my wedding and I found the place to be elegant and the rooms superb. We asked for a non alcoholic champagne and they brought us a cheap non-alcoholic champagne from Sainsbury's. The food was average and I could smell cigarettes on my floor. I was shocked to find this at the Dorchester. The spa is fantastic, you can really relax in style there. 

Overall, it was a nice experience but it could have been better.",4,2014,01,28
130,Good Service,"Wonderful, attentive service at check-in, staff acknowledged and were most friendly to my 6 year old. We were then taken up to our room, which was lovely and as expected. Cosy room, tastefully furnished and very comfortable bed! Very happy with our large size marble bathroom.

Only slight irritation: no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Its either an additional £20 to have a kettle with coffee and tea sachets in your room, or room service at just under £10 per hot drink. Our room did however contain two bottles of water and some apples.

Breakfast was superb! Again, very attentive service and delicious English breakfast as well as other choices. 
My overall impression of my stay, is that The Dorchester, attracts not only an international clientele, but very much a new wealth one.",4,2014,01,28
130,Your Estate on Hyde Park,"This Grand Dame of London hotels perched on the edge of Hyde Park offers one a very personal lavish experience where service, public rooms, accommodations, and food can satisfy the most demanding. We were greeted at Heathrow with Phantom Rolls car transfer service offered by the D . It is a joy to arrive at the circle drive and be welcomed by the friendly efficient doorman. The D always has fabulous flowers in its gardens and planter boxes on the hotel facade that are positively inspirational. Entering the gilt and wooden lobby you know you have arrived. I always stop and stare at the definition of grand floral bouquet on the center table. The D is Grand but warm and intimate....an estate on Hyde Park. Check in has always been easy, last time we were early from the US  but was offered a complimentary continental breakfast in the gallery, with its beautiful columns and stunning silks, as the room was made ready. I will say that in the 5 stays  I have always received an upgrade with my Virtuoso reservation and this time placed in chic art deco 2 room junior suite with fine design. The style was so moving I wanted to sell all my antiques at home and redo my home in art deco (same thing happens to me at Claridges). We had come over to celebrate the royal wedding and we walked everywhere from this perfect location. I truly love the upstairs hallways as the handmade carpets with beautiful designs that are echoed in color palates on the walls and trim are beyond special and different on every floor. I walk down the stairs from the top every time just to look at the stunning hallways (ok...a little weird but you'll understand) Ive also stayed in very traditional rooms that are quintessential english country estate style that you feel like you are at your estate in the Cotswalds.... Colefax and Fowler chintz deluxe. Honestly the rooms are done so well you want to hang out in your room and read a good book. Food is very good. Dinner at Alain Ducasse was beyond special. First, have your reservations well in advance as this is a top table in town. Then take the Chef Menu with 8 plus courses. BEST squab ever!!!!! The  meal was 750 pounds/1100 $ for 2 therefore a huge splurge for most but definitely one of the top 5 dinners in my life and our ""royal"" experience for the weekend events.In our dining room that night was The Sultan (owner I believe), Karl Lagerfeld , a group of 5 privileged Japanese teenagers that were in residence there (due to the tsunami) taking photos of every course (that I wish I had copies of), just to give an indication of interesting people you might encounter. The spa is beautiful in white and crystals art deco style with traditional services and soothing water features (earlier I had a 12 h layover on the way to Africa and I was welcomed and pampered for 5 hours here and then headed back to Heathrow a new person... again, a splurge once in a lifetime) When I travel to London I always have a difficult time picking out my residence as there are so many wonderful places to stay from my experiences. The Dorchester is always at the top of my list and I will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,01,28
130,Wonderful memories,"It was my 60th birthday on Sunday and I am delighted that we stayed again at the fabulous Dorchester.  We've stayed at the hotel at least once a year since my 50th, and it has never ever disappointed.  The staff are all lovely and helpful and nothing is too much trouble.  At this hotel it doesn't matter who you are all guests get the five star treatment  We can not wait to return in December......",5,2014,01,20
130,The Internet isn't free!,"I'm regular guest at The Dorchester and I always enjoy staying there. The food, service, ambiance, staff and facilities are excellent. The only comment that I always mention that they should make the high speed WiFi internet connection free of charge for all guests and visitors at the hotel. I know that there is a free 512 Kbps connection! But better to not provide a free connection than providing such slow internet to the guests!!",4,2014,01,20
130,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband during a weekend. We were very warmly welcomed and upgraded to a junior suite. Staff was very friendly and helped us during our entire stay (especially the concierge). Our room and bathroom were impressive, beds were extremely comfortable.  We were a bit apprehensive as we already had booked the hotel when friends told us it was more appropriate for business stay. However, we were very delighted and enjoyed being in the center of Park Lane. We strongly recommend this hotel even for a romantic weekend.",5,2014,01,16
130,Beautiful hotel & fantastic service,"My friend and myself visited the Dorchester when my friend booked a room for my birthday.
The service was fantastic, every member of staff was polite and would always chat with us. 
We had afternoon tea and it was lovely. The promenade is beautiful and the pianist made it even more enjoyable. The sandwiches and cakes were spectacular and our waitress was brilliant (think her name was Leila?) 
Our room was stunning also, shame we didn't have a view of the park however we didn't spend much time in the room to notice. 
The location of the hotel is convenient and the staff make you feel very safe and welcome.
I will highly recommend the Dorchester to all of my friends. 
Thankyou :-)",5,2014,01,15
130,We'll be back…...,"From the moment we arrived to a lovely welcome from all the gentlemen on the door who looked after our car we knew we had made the right choice. Nothing is too much trouble. We checked in at 10.30am no problem at all. We were then whisked up to our room where our bags arrived within minutes then an order for coffee was made which too arrived very quickly. It was our daughters 15th birthday and a cake with candles was in the room when we came back at tea time, not only that, a plate of hand made chocolates and biscuits and fruit too had been left for us to enjoy. The only thing that was a shame, was that the excellent sound system in the room did not have a good enough signal for the radio to work. Nor could we find a price list for the mini bar, but then I'm not sure there are many people who stay here and worry about prices!? It would have been lovely to have a view of the park but I had asked for a quiet room so maybe that is why we weren't overlooking Park Lane? The room was lovely all the same.

The staff here really know their job and you will be made to feel special at every possible moment.
Breakfast was lovely and our daughter was made to feel like a Princess. The staff all remember you and will take care to ask all the right questions to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We will definitely be visiting again, for longer next time, I hope. Thank you to all the lovely staff.",5,2014,01,14
130,So nearly 5 Star,"We stayed at the Dorchester for a 2 night week-end break from January 10th to the 12th January 2014. We had travelled with 2 friends and booked the two rooms at the same time. 

There was just one or two incidents that stopped my review being 5 star which is a pity because generally this is an excellent hotel. 

We were received courteously and effectively by the excellent doormen and the luggage was quickly removed from the car and the car parked for us - we opted for valet parking which makes life very easy. 

Because their web-site doesn't easily allow the booking of two room (or at least I couldn't see how to do it) I had to make two separate bookings. This caused the first minor embarrassment when checking in. I checked in first with my friends booking in just after. I presented all the confirmation documents so the reception knew we were together - they upgraded our friends and realised as soon as they did it that this was probably a bit of a mistake. After quite a long period of time they managed to also upgrade our room. To be honest this incident was quite funny but the web-site should allow group bookings and / or the reception should spot the obvious and either upgrade the whole party or none of the party.

We were then left to find the rooms ourselves and waited a few minutes for the cases to find us?

The rooms were excellent, large and spotlessly clean. The furniture was of very good quality and the bed large and very comfortable - good night sleep guaranteed. The TV was of very high quality (Bang and Olufsen) with many free satellite channels. The bathroom was extremely large with and well furnished with marble and high quality fittings. In short the room could not be faulted - Ok, I hate those reviews that try and pick fault with absolutely everything but there was just one tiny little thing where I thought I was being pedantic about and wasn't going to mention until  totally unprompted my friend joked over breakfast that you would think a 5 star hotel would have a toilet roll holder that fitted toilet rolls - they weren't wide enough so every time you used them they dropped on the floor - so I have done just that kind of review!

All of the communal areas, corridors, bars etc. were totally in keeping of a top class hotel.

We had the full English breakfast, which was served in 'The Grill' restaurant. The food was superb and the service exemplary - the room itself is a little tired now and perhaps in need of a refurb.

We had dinner in Alain Ducasse which I have reviewed separately.

Now on to the incident that stopped a the 5 star review. When I checked out the invoice given to me quoted a price higher than what I booked - I queried this and was told that the on-line price excluded VAT. I have to admit I was a little slow here and failed to work out that the figures didn't work out. When I got home I checked the price on my confirmation invoice and the price included VAT and was £30 / night cheaper per room. So they had overcharged us £120 in total fro the two rooms. This really is unacceptable and whilst they have told me that they have corrected this I feel they have spoiled the experience. A 5 star hotel should not make this kind of mistake. There has been no offer of compensation just a straight refund - pity.

I may stop at the Dorchester again but at the moment I would probably recommend the Savoy, Langham, Berkeley or Claridges as better options.",4,2014,01,13
130,"Great location, great staff, bedrooms need work","Our weekend at the Dorchester was generally very good however breakfast on the Saturday was very disorganised and took well over 90minutes with a number of errors in service.Some of this was due to the volume however the hotel seemed to be taking custom from non residents which was rather annoying when residents should have had priority. Sunday breakfast was perfect.

We had a few small points of concern nothing major however I might have expected better from the Dorchester. I was however impressed with the receptionist who had made an error on the morning paper, however she made sure that she made contact and apologised personally.
On the Sunday the wrong paper was delivered.

The Bar staff in the main area were great and very accommodating with all their customers.",4,2014,01,07
130,Nice but expensive,"Very nice foyer and friendly staff.  The bar is great for cocktails.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and are well kept.  The guys out front are really great.  I probably wouldn't stay again as I think you can get better value elsewhere, still, as an experience, very nice indeed.",4,2014,01,05
130,Great Stay,One of the best Hotels in the WOrld. Always good service. We come for business and occupy quite a few rooms and they always make us feel at home. Management is very efficient is always there to help. Great Spa and Lobby. Bathrooms are large.,4,2014,01,05
130,Memorable stay,"We stayed here November 2013. You're greeted by possibly the best team of doormen in London. Whether turning up in a Rolls Royce or a Taxi, they give everyone the same level of service and cannot do enough for you.
As for the hotel itself, very plush, impressive, traditional and comfortable. The only thing I would say is that it tends to attract a lot of well-off Eastern Europeans & Russians, who on our occasion of stay, seemed to be very rude to the staff. Not the fault of the Hotel.
It isn't as relaxed an atmosphere as I was hoping for as everything is quite formal. The breakfast service is excellent, but as I said, very formal.
The rooms are all very high specification and the team of staff all willing to do whatever they can to make your stay the best it can be.",4,2014,01,03
130,Loosing its edge but still makes very good rating,I have stayed here before but usually just visit the wonderful promenade bar or the bar itself. On this occasion we were in the promenade bar for drinks after our meal elsewhere. The service was excellent as always and the prices are about what you'd expect from this type of place. What concerns me is the obvious nature of women of a certain job description hovering around the bar area. Given that this is a family hotel and there are always a fair number of children in the hotel areas this is a concern. Still if you want some opulence and 5 star service this is the place to go. Live music with the piano and bass is always entertaining. ,4,2014,01,03
130,Outstanding!,"My wife, daughter, parents and I stayed at The Dorchester as a treat for one night before Christmas.  It was amazing and fully lived-up to its stellar reputation.

The hotel was wonderful and Christmasy and the atmosphere inside made up for the miserable weather outside.  The Christmas trees were fantastic and the Gingerbread hotel wonderful.  Our rooms were extremely well furnished and designed, and the staff met all our requests for adjoining rooms with a cot in one.

What marked The Dorchester out from other high end establishments was the sincere friendliness and helpfulness of every one of the staff who we engaged with.  This includes the doormen, front desk team, concierge, room-service assistant and restaurant staff.  A whole-hearted thank you to all of you for making our short stay so enjoyable!",5,2014,01,01
130,Excellent!,"Well, it's the Dorchester, what do you expect? Perfect from start to finish. Very friendly and helpful staff. The house keepers work incredibly hard and it shows as every part of the hotel was immaculate. Our room was wonderful with a huge comfy bed and and a sumptuous en suite bathroom. The food is to die for. We had the carvery and the beef was carved at our talbeside and the slices were like thin sirloin steak! This is a 5 star luxury hotel so don't expect to get a cheap deal but it is well worth paying the extra money. I had to work like a dog to get the money together for our weekend away but I would certainly do it again.",5,2014,01,01
130,A great place to be in the heart of London,"I have to say that it is a great place to be in the heart of London.
Incredible service and very high service. Not too pricey for what you get.
Staff very caring and serviceable. Good selection of food. I stayed there with my son and friends and it happened an amusement park, a great one, was open across the street at Hyde Park.
Great location and I would recommend it at anytime.
We will be back.
Thanks",5,2014,01,01
130,3 night stay,"Lovely hotel, staff very helpful most comfortable bed. Breakfast is epic with the best scrambled eggs I've ever tried. Our room was quite small but had everything you needed. The bath is enormous & fills very quickly, the height of luxury!",4,2013,12,30
130,Excellence,"After a recent bereavement we just needed a change of environment, too late to go abroad and too much hassle. We were fortunate enough to locate 2 rooms at The Dorchester so booked in for 2 nights and 3 days. Ok let me be honest, the arrival and check in was perfectly smooth and encouraging. The place was suitably Christmassy but not overbearingly so, in fact it even took me back to the grandiose feel of yesteryear in a most modern way. So whilst you ponder on that let me tell you in a whisper, there was a tiny bump in the otherwise smooth process but that was rectified 10folds. First a possible downside for some, there was no swimming pool which my 2 grandsons (9 and 11) would have loved. To my knowledge there was no sauna which for me was the only real let down. There is a spa but that's not for me and I believe there was a gym but again that's not my thing. My advice is be clear of your needs before booking and when you do go, if you have any quirks or unusual requests make them known. I found the manager and staff helpful and accommodating once things had been clarified. It is also excellent for a disabled person, I am wheelchair bound and had no problems getting around, the shower was a dream to access and use as was the entire bathroom. There was also umpteen offers to help push my wheelchair on the plush carpets because for me alone it was darned difficult. Watch out for the mini bar best to go to the bar which is a more sobering price. The mini bar is way over the top so avoid unless desperate. I was fortunate enough to meet the ever so efficient and polite promenade manager Pierre who miraculously got the bumps ironed out in the twinkle of an eye. By the time we left all of us felt a return to repeat and savour the experience is a must. I certainly felt we were special and even though the hotel was full and staff were clearly very busy we could quite easily be the only guests around. The food was lovely, the service was excellent. The cleanliness was evident and the smooth jazz accompanying dinner just melted the stress away. Did we enjoy it? my 2 young grandsons thought they had died and gone to heaven (yeah! I admit there was some bribery and corruption in the form of a free chitty chitty bang bang style candy store) and they can't wait to return. Their father was able to rest, relax, unwind and rejuvenated he also feels a return will be eagerly awaited. His wife loved the decadence of the salubrious setting and the detail to attending our needs. I shall be keeping my eyes peeled for any good deals but if you are into Christmas without having it smash you in the face, try The Dorchester you will love it. See you there next Christmas and enjoy.",5,2013,12,30
130,Work Christmas Party,"Wow!  My first visit  and I was blown away!  I have been to some great hotels in my life but this certainly was spectacular.  The entrance hall was welcoming and smelled wonderful.  Walking through the promenade (no-one famous!) set the scene and then walking into the where our Christmas party was to be held was amazing!  The food - how did they turn out nearly 400 plates of food all to such a high standard?!!  The service - was the best I have ever encountered!  The music - oh, the band.......  I can be quite cynical about 'bands' playing at these type of events - but they could not be faulted.  From modern to old they hit it every tune!  One day, I will stay in this hotel.  Absolutely and highly recommended.
Lesley.",5,2013,12,24
130,"Posh in reputation, but a bit dated in actuality","We stayed at The Dorchester (my wife for vacation, me on business) for four nights in 2011.  Although the hotel's reputation as a place to be seen is well deserved (it is indeed filled with a very well-heeled clientele), we found the room to be disappointingly small and dated.  It may have been updated in the interim, but it was not up to par with similar properties at which we have stayed in other cities.",3,2013,12,23
130,English luxury,"One truly appreciates the sumptuousness of this English establishment.  Fantastic english breakfast in the morning in the Promenade (long waits to sit down after 8:30 am). Relatively small rooms but with classic design.  

Highly recommend asking for a room away from the elevator as the elevators doors are very noisy. My room smelled as if it was a smoking room.  I asked for air purifier.",4,2013,12,22
130,Sparkly Festive Loveliness!,"My mum and I had a festive afternoon tea yesterday. The promenade was decorated beautifully and really got me in the festive mood. There was even a very dashing young pianist to listen to! All staff were very helpful, polite and friendly. The best thing was at no point did I feel uncomfortable as you sometimes can do in upmarket hotels. 
The tea consisted of champagne, open sandwiches, cakes, pastries with your choice of tea. It was very tasty, although the cake selection could have looked more impressive. There is plenty to eat...don't even think about eating lunch beforehand!
My mum says that it was much better than the Ritz for tea, so this is a good choice should you wish to treat someone.",4,2013,12,21
130,A real Christmas treat.,"I didn't want to get out of bed at 6am in order to meet friends from South Africa for breakfast. They were staying at the Dorchester so it was a little more tempting. We arrived at 8am to the warmest of receptions. Staff were wonderfully attentive and welcoming. The newly devised breakfast buffet was made all the more special when a member of staff carefully helped me to my choices, the scrambled eggs were voluminous and creamy and the delicious coffee flowed. We chatted and laughed for over an hour attended by discrete, helpful and charming staff. A real Christmas treat in a beautiful, friendly, special place. (PS its not cheap!)",5,2013,12,21
130,Best hotel in london,"After staying here 4 times, the last being January 2013, i thought i would review all of my stays at the hotel. This hotel is truly 5*. We come here whenever we want to stay in London because we know we will receive excellent service (and have amazing afternoon tea). The rooms here are lovely and my favorite is the spa. I have a massage every time i come and i am never disappointed, also the spatisserie is a lovely place to have afternoon tea for a bit of a change.
I love the breakfast here there is so much to choose from you feel spoilt for choice! The staff are really lovely here and will try and attend to anything you want or need food wise, i wanted an apple pie with custard even though not on the menu, it was made for me and tasted divine.
The only downside i have is sometimes we have a really large bathroom , and the other time our bathroom was tiny but the same type of room, i did ask and they said its down to availability.
Overall if your coming to London stay here you wont be disappointed.",5,2013,12,20
130,The Best Hotel In London,"I stayed here for one night on the 22nd of November for my 21st Birthday, on arrival the doorman were quick to open my door and help me out insisting on taking all the bags straight away, when checking in we were served by an Irish man, who was the most friendly, genuine man i have ever met! 

My boyfriend booked the standard double room, when booking he told them it was for my 21st, on arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Mayfair suite, (2 bathrooms, 1 bedroom and a dining room/living room) the bed had petal hearts on the bed and a little birthday cake!!!

THE BED was the comfiest bed i have ever slept in, the best night sleep !!!
the maids in the morning were very friendly and polite. 
Overall i had the best stay in this hotel and it was made super special for me, and this is hat you get at hotels of this kind.!!!

VERY pleased and can't wait to return!!!

also had afternoon tea last Christmas here and it was so special! there was a pianist and a few children sang.",5,2013,12,15
130,Lovely Stay,"Just returned from a one night stay at The Dorchester, a retirement treat for my husband and myself, we mentioned this to the very helpful young lady who checked us in. Our room was large as was the bathroom, there was complimentary bottled water and fruit also. We spent the evening out some friends, on returning to our room, we discovered a lovely chocolate decorated cake had been left for us, such a nice touch. The bed had been turned down, pyjamas laid out and my untidy pile of clothes folded up. The next morning we asked at breakfast if the cake could be boxed for us to carry, we were told this could be arranged and sure enough when we got back to our room the cake was inside a Dorchester carry box. Our breakfast was lovely, freshly cooked with lovely breads and pastries. This is not a cheap place to stay and really was a treat for us, but we were impressed with all the staff, the attitude seems to be nothing is too much trouble for a guest. Finally, I am not the best sleeper, but have to say our room was quiet, the bed and pillows were so comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud. All in all a lovely stay. Just as an extra tip there was a comment from another reviewer that the hotel is a fair walk from Green Park tube station, we got off at Hyde Park Corner which seemed fairly close to the hotel.",5,2013,12,15
130,Best hotel service in London,"This is by far the best luxury hotel in London. Stayed for a few nights and every part of it was amazing. From the check in to the room, food, service, spa and the most hospitable staff. Will return soon. You will find you don't want to leave.  ",5,2013,12,12
130,Dated and Stuffy,"I stayed here for a week for a business trip and I was not impressed. It is very over the top with most of the decor and really needs an update. The room was small, smaller than some similar hotels in the area. It's also a bit of a walk to the green park tube station and the main area of Mayfair. For the price, I think you can certainly find a place that's nicer. ",4,2013,12,10
130,Disappointed,"I have travelled a lot over the last few years and stayed in some beautiful hotels around the world.I was at last looking forward to staying at the Dorchester hotel, somewhere I had always wanted to stay as it is one of the hotels that stand out worldwide. 

The hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of Park Lane right next to the park and the winter wonderland that was on. I was so looking forward to my stay. As I arrived at the hotel in a black cab I was impressed with the look of the hotel infact, it looked perfect. Unfortunately, the car park area was full of very expensive cars with their occupants revving their engines, which took the gloss off my first impressions, but I later found out that this is the sort of people the hotel attracts and they have no consideration to other people (all money and no class, as my mother would say!)

The reception staff were all very helpful but at times I thought over helpful. Despite being 50+ I have not lost my ability to do some things for myself! 

The room was fantastic and the bathroom was fabulous , the bed was very comfortable and the linen was fantastic. I was amazed that the room had no tea making facilities there was no trouser press , no fruit and no water as these things are standard in a lot of other hotels in which I stay and they cost substantially less than the room rate at this hotel which is breathtakingly expensive by anyone's standards.

The promenade restaurant is very strange and you feel like you are eating in a corridor and the chairs are low so makes eating difficult, the food on the other hand was very good.

I had to move to north London after the Dorchester and stay in a Hilton hotel. I found the quality of the service and level of amenities  in the hilton far better than the Dorchester.

The Dorchester hotel should be the best hotel in the land but I feel they have lost the plot a bit , the staff need to be more individual as it sometimes comes across as fake and over helpful .
I am pleased to have had the experience but at these prices for the service I will not be going back .",3,2013,12,06
130,Almost perfect,"Returned to the Dorchester after many years to find the hotel completely refurbished & updated for new technology. Staff was almost perfect in every way. A few minor hiccups in service in The Grill & The Promenade but something that probably would go unnoticed elsewhere. Room was very comfortable, as was the bath. Always loved the deep soaking tubs. 
Where you used to have to press a button for the maid, valet, etc. everything is now incorporated into the phone system. TV remote controls the lights in the room, etc. Housekeeping was always done promptly twice a day. I find that even in a lot of five star hotels, you have to call housekeeping to remind them to do turndown service (as if you weren't going to need towels, etc. in the morning). I defected to Claridges for a few years but will probably return to the Dorchester next time.",5,2013,12,06
130,An average hotel living on its' reputation,"This was my first visit to the iconic Dorchester. I had an executive room for 2 nights for work. Check in was okay but the sweet Irish clerk was so anxious that he asked me most questions more than once. Endlessly asking how my day was, my journey was, I was (etc) just isn't required. I expect he was just following his training.....but there in lies the problem with the Dorchester....more of that shortly, dear reader. 

My room was fine. It was at the back on a high floor but still noisy. The bathroom was awesome but the rest of the amenities no better than Sofitel or Mercure. In fact, given the extraordinary price of the room, I was disappointed with the lack of mineral water, fruit, a tea tray, a trouser press and so on. There was, of course, a massive 'mini bar' (poor English, sorry) containing everything you can imagine. On day 2, the room wasn't properly serviced. 

I had dinner and drinks at the bar. The Promenade bar is disappointing. The furniture is cheap, faux antique junk shop stuff and battered. The prices are typical of central London and the staff (with exception of Caesar) patronising (again, endless but false and insincere questions about my 'day'). Caesar obviously skipped the training and is natural and has an intact personality! Thank Goodness! 

Food in the restaurant was average. 

Breakfast was a disaster in the Promenade. Again, endless insincere questions about my sleep patterns (!) and VERY slow service. One French staff member had obviously been on the training course about advising customers where to visit in London! Given that I lived in London for 30 years I was keen to hear his recommendations.....it was priceless.....""there's not much to do in London on a Saturday (sic) so I'd recommend Portobello Market"". No comment.

There is a very small gym, which I used but its only just adequate. 

This hotel really is living on its' reputation. They need some local staff who can welcome staff properly to London. They need to radically review their training and 'ditch' their training by rote. 

I wouldn't stay here again and don't recommend it - especially for the price.",3,2013,12,03
130,Exceptional - as always!,"As always, we had a great time at The Dorchester! This hotel has got it SO right! From the moment you arrive you are treated like you are the most important person in the building, nothing is too much trouble. We stayed for just one night as we were attending a luncheon event the next day, tried to stay for two nights but unfortunately the hotel was full. On arrival, we were greated by Gloria at reception, a more helpful, pleasant and accommodating young lady would be hard to find. We were offered an upgrade from a Deluxe room which we had booked, to a newly refurbished Junior suite which we were delighted to accept, meant waiting about 30 minutes but a glass of bubbly in the bar whilst waiting soon made the time pass swiftly. I asked also for a late checkout on the Monday which Gloria readily agreed for us. On entering 'The Promenade' we were faced with a huge 'Gingerbread house' made as a replica of the Hotel itself, it was magnificent! Also, the sounds of carol singers serenading the afternoon tea customers was heard in the distance which really set the scene for Christmas. When we arrived in our room, our luggage was alread in situ, the room was lovely with an enormous bathroom, only negative was that it was at the back of the hotel overlooking some appartments and not with a 'park' view that I always ask for, had we been staying for more than one night I would have asked to have been  moved. We had cockatails and dinner in the Hotel that evening, dinner being in the Grill Room which was excellent and better than I can remember. All in all a wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel, thank you to all the staff which make The Dorchester such a VERY special place to stay in London.",5,2013,12,03
130,Exceptional,"Attended an awards ceremony here in ""The Ballroom"". It has been some time since i last visited and i pleased to report that all aspects of the hotel have maintained the same immaculate level of excellence. In every respect, food, service, staff attitude and knowledge, ambiance, cleanliness, i could go on, you will not find a better establishment in London.",5,2013,12,03
130,One of the best hotels in the world,"This is by far one of the best hotels in the world.  The rooms are sumptuous and comfortable.  We stayed for a week, and they put an extra rail in the hallway of our room for my dresses.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and they are so polite and pleasant.  I particularly loved the concierge staff who were without a doubt the most professional group I have encountered.   

The bathtub was like a swimming pool, and the room maid gave me a little stool to help me climb in as I am so small.  

I will ALWAYS stay in this hotel in London.",5,2013,12,02
130,By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in,My stay in the Belgravia Suite at The Dorchester was fantastically faultless. The staff were amazing and food was delicious. The decor is absolutely stunning and I will certainly be visiting again some day.,5,2013,11,29
130,Luxury,"I attended a 3 day training course here and was very impressed by the quality of the product/produce used. The pillows/linens are ultra high quality, the bed perfect and the food incredible (if you get a macaron, don't bite too hard or you will bite your fingers off)

Tv controls a/c and lighting and I am sure the baths are deep enough to dive into.

The private dining in the penthouse was excellent and particularly recommend the white wine which taste of lychee, the 2010 chateau neuf du pape and the wagyu beef.

Well done the Dorchester.",5,2013,11,29
130,Beyond Expectations,"If you are willing to splurge, the only place to stay is The Dorchester Hotel.

Perfectly located in the heart of London's Mayfair on Park Lane, between Marble Arch and Hyde Park Corner, The Dorchester is close to exclusive London shopping in Bond Street and Knightsbridge and is within easy access of many London attractions including Buckingham Palace, West End theatres, the Royal Albert Hall and the National Gallery.

The Dorchester is one of the most famous and best hotels in London. It's a 5 star hotel and a Travelers' Choice® 2013 Winner by TripAdvisor. The Dorchester does bring in some big name celebrities so if you are not into celebrity sightings, don't stay here.

Inside the Dorchester is Alain Ducasse, a three star Michelin restaurant serving contemporary French cuisine. It's still the very best dining experience my wife and I have ever had. World class food, excellent service as we had 8 different people serving us! Reservations are mandatory, at least 3-4 weeks in advance.

We'll be staying at the Dorchester any time we are in London.",5,2013,11,28
130,The Best in London!,"Incredible place, stayed for a night in November for my otherhalfs Birthday, upgraded to a huge suite,all the staff made us feel special. Best nights sleep I've had all year!

 No Hotel in London compares to the interior design and quality of the Dorchester it's perfect and everything you expect!!!",5,2013,11,28
130,One of London's greatest treasures,"What a beautiful, elegant and timeless hotel. Whilst it is traditional in style (long may that continue) it is right up to the minute with all the amenities you could possibly want for a stay in complete luxury and right in the centre of London.

Our bedroom was perfect - not huge but oh so comfortable, clean with not a sign of wear & tear - we felt very cossetted. The hotel team offered effortless service always there with a smile. Unobtrusive and totally professional, there are many hotels that could learn a thing or to from this magnificent brigade. 

The Dorchester Collection should be very proud of the standards they are setting within the hotel industry - Coworth Park near Ascot (another property within the collection) is equally delightful.",5,2013,11,26
130,Perfect honeymoon treat,I planned an afternoon tea at the Dorchester as a surprise for my wife to start our honeymoon in style. From start to finish it was fantastic Leyla was exceptional very professional but at the same time very friendly. The surprise congratulation cake was a great touch and my wife really enjoyed it. We will defiantly be returning!! ,5,2013,11,25
130,My second visit in the last year - and definitely not the last!,"I arrived around 12 noon, and my room wasn't quite ready. I expected this as I was so early - but the lovely receptionist (Daniela) offered me a complimentary drink at the bar, and asked me to wait around an hour. She told me I'd been upgraded, and the room would be worth the wait. I sat in the bar... where I ordered a delicious Dorchester Chicken Salad... and relaxed... and after 45 minutes, Daniela personally came to tell me the room was ready. We walked up to my room - I walked in, and said ""wow"". The room was huge! She told me it was an executive room, which had a king bed - a sitting area and one of those famous balconies overlooking the front of the hotel. I was so happy with the room. The bathroom was bigger than last time, with the deepest bath you can imagine, and a separate walk-in shower. This time I visited the Dorchester Barber shop for the first time. The owner was very friendly - and it was a great experience. He has been at The Dorchester since 1988. I would definitely return. I decided to order room service for dinner as I wanted to take full advantage of the room upgrade. How great that you can order room-service from the Wolfgang Puck restaurant located next door at the Dorchester's sister hotel ""45 Park Lane"". I thoroughly enjoyed my petit mignon steak, which arrived hot, and beautifully presented with home-made breads, high quality butter, delicious fries - and a wonderful steak sauce (highly recommended!). Thanks to The Dorchester for taking care of me again. I can't wait to return.",5,2013,11,24
130,Not for those who lean toward a contemporary/hip feel...,"The flower arrangements are so huge in the lobby that i worried about anyone having a severe allergy attack.  The staff were all very helpful and polite.  It seems from the cars parked in the driveway, the paparazzi sometimes at the front door and the body guards in the lobby, that this is a hotel that the very wealthy and famous stay at and so it felt a little intimidating to relax in the lobby or in the restaurants. Our room was tiny (cramped) and felt very outdated. The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  I just felt that it is a hotel for those who want to feel like royalty (and maybe are?) but not for those who are (or want to feel) young, hip or current.",3,2013,11,22
130,Amazing stay,"What a wonderful hotel - pleasure to the full. The Superior room was really nice and the breakfast so delicious. The staff at breakfast time was so attentive and polite. The gentleman with French accent was first class, delivering very personal yet professional service. We will be back.",5,2013,11,21
130,"Oh No ""Dorchester"" You ruined our event!!","I attended my best friends wedding on 16th Nov at The Dorchester. Although I had never been here before, I had heard so great about it from word of mouth but so wrong was I. As they say, the grass is greener on the other side, so true for The Dorchester. We had dinner event for 350 guests and it was poorly organised. I had the misfortune of having a long table where half of my friends had been served the main course and we had to wait for almost 40 minutes for ours to arrive. When asking the waiters, few of them spoke bare English, and our waitress confirmed that the problem was in kitchen where the food had finished. Initially we thought that they were joking but they weren't. It just ruined our evening. When our main course (beef) came, it was cold and not upto 5 star standard. My girlfriend was supposed to have fish as ladies were having fish, but all our table was served beef. When questioned, the waiters did not respond and just left the food on the table expressionless. My other friends who were lucky to be served the food, were embarrassed to eat the food and were rather offering a portion from their plate to each other. No manageres were to be seen for help and we just felt left stranded. 
I am surprised that this is how Dorchester treats their guests. To tell you the truth, I was considering bringing my partner for an afternoon tea as I had never been there before, but now, I will NEVER  ever dare go there. Oh no Dorchester, you really ruined our experience. I work for a multinational company in EC1 and this is going to every one of my friends and colleagues in my company. No one should be lured of the hype of ""Dorchester"". Its nothing special and in fact their service and class is just an average one except the sky high prices.  Stop fooling people Dorchester! Never again !! Shame on you!!",1,2013,11,17
130,Oh dear must try harder………..,"As we were attending a huge wedding at the Dorchester we decided to stay the night.  Check in was fine and we were taken to our room which was adequate.   All ok so far and the wedding was absolutely fabulous so full marks to The Dorchester for such a great venue.  After midnight the lifts only work when you use your key.  What we didn't realise was that you can only access the floor that you are staying on - so three couples, staying on three different floors after a very merry wedding found that tricky.  Did the night porter help - did he heck he was rude and very unhelpful.  When I returned to our room to sleep it was impossible due to the noise of a generator outside.  I phoned reception to say that it was impossible to sleep due to the noise, which obviously hadn't been evident when we arrived due to us running baths, watching TV etc.  Reception insisted on sending up security?  Someone arrived after 15 minutes so we stood awkwardly listening to the noise which he acknowledged and said he would report back.  Enough - this was plainly ridiculous so I again phoned reception who agreed to give me another room to sleep in, clearly we weren't going to pack up at 3am and move.  The other room was pretty dreadful but quieter so managed some sleep.  When we tried to get back into our original room in the morning we found all our keys had been cancelled.  A security measure apparently - fine perhaps if someone had told us but we looked like we had done the walk of shame lurking outside a room, dressed in last nights gear with a toothbrush in hand trying to find someone to help.  We had breakfast, staff were eager but just didn't really seem to have a clue.  Another couple dining with us had to ask for a latte four times before it arrived and getting milk with my tea seemed  a feat to say the least - i could go on but I guess you are getting the picture.

There are some very good people on the staff but overall I was completely underwhelmed with the attitude and level of service on offer.  It all summed it up for me when the bellboy putting our luggage in the car took my carefully hung full length suit carrier with my ball gown in screwed it up and threw it in the back of the car whilst sticking his hand out for  a tip - words fail me.",3,2013,11,17
130,A Splendid Time,"This was for a special treat with my Partner. Greeted well from reception and given a lovely room. Bars, Lounge, room service and the Grill room for breakfast were all of a high standard for service and drinks/meals.

Its just so special and welcoming.",5,2013,11,17
130,#1 FOR SERVICE,"I do believe that this is the best city hotel in the world  The owner has unlimited money and uses it to make perfection   There is more staff in this hotel than anywhere else   The lobby the rooms are in perfect condition, never a scratch, never a tear   Your robes are changed twice a day   The people who work there are very friendly and warm whether you are a movie star or just an ordinary hotel guest   I have stayed here 4 times this year alone and I never can find fault   I have stayed at all the other London top hotels and they pale in comparison to this one",5,2013,11,17
130,Fabulous experience,"Having stayed for 4 nights at The Dorchester around the same time as Cr4igdonovan, I would agree with the observations made by him regarding the patchy service at breakfast. Fortunately for us, Pierre, the Promenade manager was on hand to put things right.
My other observation would be that in the afternoon and early evening, there is no comfortable seating available in the public areas, as it reserved for people having afternoon tea. As a guest of the hotel I find this disappointing and being a lady of a certain age, I have no desire to perch on a bar stool, sit on bench seating in the bar or worse, sit in a draughty foyer. 
Despite this, the hotel was fabulous and I loved my stay.",4,2013,11,16
130,1 night of luxery,"We spent 1 night here when checked in the man in check in could not do enough for us bags to room  he showed us around the room which was specious had coffee in the promenade  had a drink in the bar which was expensive but not bad for a 5 star hotel the bed was excellent , breakfast was great , cannot fault the hotel or restaurant and staff thanks for the expereince",5,2013,11,16
130,"Great hotel, disappointing service","My wife and I stayed at the Dorchester for a few days away from our busy work lives. On arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and were shown to our room. Our room was of great size and decorated exceptionally! The solid marble bathroom was fantastic and the bath was the deepest I have ever seen. Once settled and unpacked we went to the bar for a few drinks before heading out into Mayfair. We expected the high pricing for the drinks, however the unnecessary service charges seemed a little unnecessary, especially as we sat at the bar and had to keep reminding the bar staff of our drink choices. The breakfast the next morning was delicious, however the service was again disappointing. The waitress, kept forgetting our orders and asked again 4 times. When it did arrive my wife's breakfast was wrong and I then had to wait a further 5 mins for hers to be replaced. Whilst waiting my breakfast was going cold. 

Anyway we ignored this as not to ruin our experience of our break and headed out to London. 

The next day breakfast again the service was disappointing, again, this time a different waitress again kept asking our orders and forgot to ask what we wanted to drink, again food was good but this level of service was not what we expected. Please remember this breakfast for each morning costs £32 per person, so for £70 each morning including the service charge i would have expected the experience to be of a far higher standard.

Other points we found disappointing was our room had no facility within the room to make our own hot drinks. - I am unsure why this is not included?

Also on two occasions. We had to remind the house keeping staff to make up our room?

Overall as per my title, our stay was good, however the price it costs for this experience, we were surprised how very average the overall service was service was. It felt like just because we were not famous and jumping up and down and complaining we were given an average service rather than that we were paying for.",4,2013,11,13
130,Anniversary,"Booked for our 10th wedding anniversary, staff not very professional, presented with a happy birthday cake instead of anniversary cake. Room good, breakfast average and did not get what was ordered. It's ticked off the bucket list and a big cost and certainly did not live up to expectations. ",3,2013,11,09
130,Excellent stay after a poor start,"Stayed here for a weekend break, excellent location for shopping, sightseeing and if you wanted to get away from it all, Hyde Park is just across the road. Upon arrival we were told that our room was not ready. Check in was 15.00 hrs, we arrived at 16.30 hrs ? We were told that our room would be ready in 15 minutes. We were meeting freinds for pre-dinner drinks at 18.00 hrs so we had to get a move on, anyway at 17.00 hrs we stepped up to the reception desk to ask if our room was ready only to be told it would be another 15 minutes. I had to check if we were in the correct Hotel, this was not what I expected to hear at the Dorchester.
  After explaining to the receptionist our arrangements she reluctantly found another room which to be fair was upgraded from what was booked. The room was very comfortable and spacious, marble bathroom complete with one of the deepest baths I have ever seen.
  Once the room situation was sorted out we had a great evening, the bar is a realy chic place to be and be seen, we even came back for a night cap.
  We had breakfast in the promenade which had a very relaxed atmosphere and exceptional service.",4,2013,11,06
130,Where to start? The most amazing experience!,"I have been meaning to write this review for a year now so my apologies to the Hotel for the delay.

My wife and I had the good forture to stay here last year for one night to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary as present from a member of our family. We arrived early to drop our bags off and enjoyed some drinks before going out for the afternoon. We were initially a little worried about it being a bit 'stuffy' but the staff were lovely offering exception service whilst being very friendly.

When we returned to be booked in the the lady at check in knew it was our anniversary although we had not told her. We got the impression something was afoot when we were told that we had been given an upgrade from our standard room and the staff exchanged soem smiles.

We were taken to the lift up to the 8th floor and then asked to wait for our butler! We then found that we had been upgraded to The Harlequin Suite which I can only describe as paradise.

Unfortunately we cannot afford to stay in establishments such as this but I can honestly say we were made to feel like millionaires. The staff made us feel so special (including breakfast in our own dining room served by our butler!) and it really made our anniversary the most amazing experience. The morning we were due to depart we were advised that the room was free that night and we did not need to worry about the usual departure time and could leave whenever we were ready.

Thanks so much to all the fantastic staff at the Dorchester, it is a beautiful place and if we ever win the lottery we will be regular visitors.",5,2013,11,06
130,Pampered luxury,"I was lucky enough to stay at the Dorchester for five nights.  The hotel is beautifully decorated in a traditional English style - especially the Promenade.  The floral arrangements were amazing.  The level of quality and service was consistent throughout - we had a beautiful room with large, marble bathroom), the women's locker rooms, spa and gym were small but well appointed, and the daily breakfast in the Promenade was a luxurious way to start the day.  Every request was attended to promptly and the staff was professional, yet warm.  I truly felt like a special, valued guest.",5,2013,11,05
130,A truly wonderful hotel,"I cannot praise The Dorchester and it's staff highly enough. My friend and I regularly visit the bar and restaurants when we are in London. However, this weekend was the first time we have stayed at the hotel as guests. It has always been a dream of mine to stay at the hotel and thought my 30th birthday was the perfect excuse to do so. Upon arrival we received a very personal greeting and were told that there was a very special surprise for me......... A free upgrade to the beautiful Oliver Messel Suite! As if this wasn't enough we were provided with a bottle of champagne on ice in the Suite. Over the weekend we had the pleasure of dining at China Tang and The Grill.  The food and service at both restaurants being exceptional. However, as always, it was the fantastic service in The Bar which stood out. Paolo and his colleagues not only know how to make the best cocktails in town but how to treat guests. Thank you to everyone at The Dorchester for a memorable stay.... I hope it will be the first of many! ",5,2013,11,03
130,UKHA Business Lunch,"UKHA just hosted the annual Business Lunch at the Dorchester. 400 people attended that lunch. Knowing the reputation of this hotel the expectations were very high. We were certainly not disappointed it was just perfect. The employees were so professional everything went smoothly, was timely and organised. We had to ask for nothing; even what we did not think of was pre-empted. The Managers working the rooms attended to everything. 
Well done to the chefs who prepared such a fine menu for so many people, to the Housekeeper and florist for the beautiful floral arrangements and to the BQ team for this superb achievement and very welcoming manner.",5,2013,10,29
130,A fairy tale in the city,"Pure luxury! The afternoon tea after London sightseeing in this hotel is simply astonishing...and also the room service (we ordered dinner in room since I was slightly sick). Staff is helpful and friendly, not superb as one could expect in a Hotel like this. Ideal choice for Russian guests...but also for all the others! Looking forward to be back, especially to the enchanting SPA.

130,Perfect Wedding Venue!,"My partner and I held our Civil Partnership at The Dorchesters Penthouse and Pavilion and it really was the most perfect day from start to finish.

The staff are a real asset to this hotel from the doorman to the house keepers, the waiting staff and the managers.  We received nothing short of exceptional service.

The food was outstanding, the Park Suite we stayed in mind blowing, the spa treatments heavenly,  I could go on and on.
 
Anybody looking for the perfect wedding venue look no further than The Dorchester.

A HUGE thank you to The Dorchester and all the staff involved for making our wedding day so special.

We look forward to returning again very soon.",5,2013,10,17
130,Top of the Pops,"I visited recently and took my friend out for a meal as a treat. We had a fabulous time

The Positives:

Great food, location, warm welcome and the ambience is magnificent. I find the Dorchester better and much more friendlier than the Ritz or the Waldorf.

The Negitives:

This is difficult as the food is always very good and it is a lovely place to eat & drink. The only issue this time was the wait for drinks to be served, however to be fair it was very busy and we were in no rush.",5,2013,10,16
130,Top notch,"We got a very good rate for this hotel, booked as a birthday treat. The room did not have a good view, but it was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. A bowl of fruit was provided.
We had afternoon tea, which is definitely recommended. Magnificent service and a lovely ambience on The Promenade.
We had a few cocktails in the bar, which was expensive and a little claustrophobic, but atmospheric.
The hotel is well located for a stroll around London's landmarks and we felt very pleased to be staying there.",5,2013,10,12
130,Great Hotel,I stayed in the Dorchester last year. I had a fabulous time. The Reception and the main lobby is absolutely stunning with its massive flower vases and fresh flowers. It has the old traditional style and everything is to a very high standard. You can feel the grant atmosphere form the first time you enter the Hotel. I would recommend this Hotel at any time.,5,2013,10,11
130,One of my favorite of all time,"This is by far the best in London and one of my favorite in the entire world. The staff are very professional and super friendly. The hotel is rich in history and is fabulously classic. 

A great number of world celebrities and heads of states have stayed here. Amazing food indeed and wonderful restaurants! The rooms are so great and each room has its own style and decor. The lobby lounge (The Promenade) is one of the most over booked place in London for a fine afternoon tea.The location is well appointed in Park Lane. To summarize, this is #1 in london.",5,2013,10,08
130,The brand is bigger than the experience,"I had always wanted to stay at The Dorchester.  It seems so grand and quintessentially British.  Well, the lobby is anyway.  We stayed six nights and after the first night asked to change rooms.  We were staying in a standard king room and all I can say is it was shabby without the chic.  Furniture is worn out, rug unraveling, and really no light as there was only a small window.   For the pleasure of $100 USD more per night, we got moved to a refurbished room (ask when you check in). 

The hallways really smell like grandma's attic - no kidding.

The service was also very hit and miss (as it turns out).  

-- We tried on two separate evenings to get a bottle of champagne put on ice before we returned to the hotel but both times we returned to the room with no ice bucket (and this was with several hours notice).  To be fair, after whining about it (because I was not happy), two complimentary glasses of champagne did show up with a nice bowl of nuts.

-- Thinking it was an apology, a fruit plate also showed up (it was put in our room but not meant for us).  Sorry Mr. Smith but you will not be getting your welcome fruit plate.

-- When we moved rooms they didn't bring the guard railing for the toddler bed.  We called and called.  When we got back to the room late, there was a guard rail but it was literally in about 20 pieces laying on the ground by the door with the box next to it.  Where we suppose to put it together for them?

On the plus side, the housekeeping staff are really good.  Your room looks great when you return.  They adjust the number of towels you need based on how you use them. The sheets are also extremely soft.  

I've read all the reviews of how fabulous the service is and how special they make you feel -- we just didn't get that.  We have been fortunate to stay in some fabulous five-star hotels around the world and this experience just didn't stack up.",2,2013,10,03
130,"Grandeur, but with a price tag to match","Attended a wedding reception here in the Orchid Suite a few weeks ago and was very impressed with the everything from the level of staff attentiveness to the decor and design. This was definitely a step out of my normal life and my wife and I appreciated the little touches. For example my wife is breastfeeding so needed to express during the night and the staff quickly found her somewhere private to do so. I was clearly aware that a hotel such as the Dorchester things don't come cheap but a couple of times I had to say ""Ouch!"" when the barman told me the price of the drinks at the bar. £7 bottles of cider were the cheapest I think.

Overall the bride and groom were happy and my wife and I got to enjoy the opulence of a posh London hotel. Shame my wallet is so much lighter but oh well.",4,2013,10,01
130,Superb Hotel,"We stayed again at the Dorchester on Saturday, 28th September; my wife claimed that she was in need of a dose of retail therapy!

I can only describe how we were treated by the staff as quite outstanding. We arrived early and were taken down to the bar for a drink. The staff at reception and all of the bar staff really looked as if they were enjoying their jobs and that we were the most important people in the hotel.

I know that one should expect excellent customer service from a quality hotel but this was on another level. Our room was extremely good, very clean and comfortable with a full range of TV channels which is unusual these days.

Our only disappointment was that we were, once again, unable to book into either of the 2 great restaurants in the hotel. I will clearly have to plan much further in advance!",5,2013,09,30
130,Cheaper than you would think. Service you couldn't imagine.,"Having stayed here many a time, I feel it only right to say how fabulous The Dorchester makes you feel. It really turns a weekend in London, into an amazing weekend in London. 
We booked a family time weekend break (two rooms for the price of one) to do some Christmas shopping with the kids. The free sweet shop won the kids over. 
From the start you have no worries. Drive up to the door, let the doormen park your car (reasonable rates for Central London), if you need the congestion charge paid they will sort that out too!
The whole atmosphere is relaxing and almost makes you forget you are in the hussle and bustle of London. The rooms are lovely and are some of the only hotel rooms I have been to that are a pleasure to just sit in and relax. 
The breakfast if perfect, you can have exactly what you want, how could you criticise that!? 
We love it there, so much that we are on our way back at the end of October. 
",5,2013,09,30
130,Conference Venue with Style,"After all the glowing reviews for its main hotel service I was interested to see how The Dorchester handled conference events. We were in The Ballroom, which has its own entrance on Park Lane so not disturbing the hotel guests, and on entering you are welcomed by the opulent décor and general wow factor.
Breakfast consisted of a wide range of coffees, teas and juices (including what I took to be one of those green healthy concoctions) served with style by the hotel staff, with a lovely selection of pastries, muffins and other healthy nibbles.
The Ballroom provides an airy and attractive area for a conference and was well air conditioned. The morning break saw the same wide range of drinks being served with giant pretzels, and the buffet lunch provided an excellent and tasty range of dishes including marinated chicken breast, fish in black bean sauce and king prawns in a sticky glaze. The desserts were equality stylish and tasty.
In the current economic climate, and mass of conference / meeting venues on offer, I should imagine that The Dorchester are highly competitive if you are looking for a venue that will really look after and impress your delegates. 10 / 10 for the whole experience.",5,2013,09,28
130,"Excellent hotel, friendly, helpful and efficient staff, but unreasonably pricey for drinks, laundry etc","This is an excellent hotel alround. The rooms are very comfortable, the staff very efficient and friendly, but the drinks, laundry, etc are unreasonably priced. However, I would go there again anyway. It is that good!",5,2013,09,25
130,Can't Put a Price on Quality,"I used to stay here regularly with my father when I was a child, and even as a young lad I could appreciate the perfection of this wonderful hotel.  I was lucky enough to dine there recently as I was passing through, and it's just as spectacular as it ever was.  I only wish there were words that could describe how perfect this hotel is, but none would do it justice.",5,2013,09,24
130,Very Expensive,"This is a lovely old hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Our room and the corridors were old and tired but nothing that a bit of decorating wouldn't fix. I was shocked at our bill when we checked out. Over $4,000 for two nights which was much more than the quoted rate. I was told it was because of the 20% vat tax that was not included in the advertised rate.",3,2013,09,24
130,Everything it should be - complete and utter satisfaction and more,"We ate here yesterday.

Wow.

Champagne, salmon, fillet steak, dessert and fine wines and liquers recommended by the sommelier.

It was the best food I have eaten in England.

Period.

Its worth every penny. You wont regret it. Well worth a splash if you have the chance.",5,2013,09,24
130,Perfect stay,"Our stay was everything we had hoped for, the staff were very polite and nothing was to much trouble would stay again in a heartbeat. We are not very rich people but it was money well spent, everyone should stop here even if its just once .",5,2013,09,23
130,Shai on The Dorchester,"The bed hugs you like a sea of feathers. Its mattress enwraps you with the warmth of a fresh morning. I found myself in slumber without knowing, shoes still on both feet, and slept for a whole 6 hours in an autumn afternoon. Simply the best bed I have ever laid myself in.

This hotel is a great option for the London visitor. A walking distance to the park and a good taxi supply to zip through nearby Oxford Street or anywhere London has to offer, I found my short stay the most unfortunate fate.

Its lobby is subdued in luxury light you are basked with the imagery of diamond clad guests and preppy lounge suits. The service impeccable the staff never shorthanded. For all its grandeur it still retains a big part of its boutique heritage, with wooden emblazoned lifts and creaky floors heavily carpetted. These aesthetic additions are a pleasing change from the hotels you tend to get around big cities. 

My room was snug and had a narrow floor space but the furniture were inviting, as I enjoyed the work desk and appreciate its antiquated facade. Step into a spacious washroom with deep tubs to help unwind those tense nerves. Everything of the room is splendid, down to the stationary set. Their pens, heavy to the hand, is far and wide the best pens I have ever encountered from my list of visited hotels. 

Overall the hotel is an inviting change. Perhaps My opinions have been made biased by my recent experiences in modern hotels and the Dorchester brought me back home to that coziness of a luxurious and exquisite city slumber. A very welcoming hotel where you lose the weight off your shoulders.",5,2013,09,21
130,"Wonderful Hotel, great location!","We just returned from a European vacation and we kicked it off by staying at the Dorchester! We were traveling with our 4 children and we booked the ""family deal"" where you get 2 rooms for the price of 1!!  It was a great deal as we basically got a 2 room suite with plenty of space to spread out!  The beds were amazing, the bathrooms were lovely with all the marble, and we loved the fresh fruit that was restocked daily!!  

The staff were also very kind and helpful towards our large family!  We had great service at breakfast and during the afternoon tea!  I highly recommend having the tea at some point during your stay!! 

The location of the hotel was also great!  It's a very short walk to the underground (hyde park corner), and the park is across the street and it's a quick walk to Buckingham Palace as well!

Oh, and you can't miss the cars that are always parked out front! Our kids got a kick out of seeing the most amazing cars in the world parked just out front! We will definitely be staying at the Dorchester again!!",5,2013,09,20
130,Among the nicest hotels I've stayed in; exceptionally tasteful,"The Dorchester ranks among the nicest hotels I've stayed in with exceptionally tasteful decor, an old school feel to it, incredibly comfortable bed (especially nice pillows) with a great warm staff. I was put there for work and welcomed with a courtesy room upgrade. I look forward to my next visit. Only complaint was the free Internet wasn't too fast and the paid upgrade to a faster speed would have been £20/day-ouch. London I guess.",5,2013,09,18
130,Stay at Dorchester and afternoon tea,"We stayed at Dorchester 4th September for presentation at the Mall Galleries of. Photographic prize for my husband.  We met friends for afternoon tea. It was exceptional and they catered for one of my friends with non gluten diet, even down to the scones.  They also presented her with the remainder of the gluten free cakes she couldnt eat.   Arrival was greeted by concierge service to park my car, taken to our room and shown all the facilities.  On departure rapid collection of my car.  I cannot fault my stay and the service at the hotel we received.",5,2013,09,17
130,As Good As It Gets,"When The Dorchester staff get it right it really is something else. They did and it was. From the bedroom ambience and thoughtful in-room touches to the terrific meals in The Promenade we found it all first class. Even though the hotel was full, and with some recognisably important guests on board, we were treated to the full attentive experience. Thank you!",5,2013,09,12
130,Wonderful escape on a Monday morning,"I decided on monday to take a day off work on a whim and treat the wife and kid to a day out.
decided to book the dorchester as it was on our to do list for some time.
rang reservations who were very helpful and made booking in an instant.
we arrived at about 3pm and check in was seamless, the gentleman had upgraded us which was great to hear. the room was as expected very well appointed and had all the mod cons.
the mini bar selection was good and i was pleased that there was suitable halal meal choices available with room service.

we left at about 5 pm to explore london and returned for 9pm. 

we decided to dine at China tang which I have reviewed separately, it was very good food indeed.
after dinner we were hoping to spend some time in the lounge area but it was fully booked so we headed back to our room. we did order some arabic food just to get a taste for it and we got the chicken kebsay which was really nice and we were infact unable to finish it which was a shame.

the overall experience was great, the hotel, the room, the bath, the bed, even the lovely salmon pink carpet in hallway are all fab,
keep it up dorchester

the breakfast in the morning was excellent and really filled us up nicely.",4,2013,09,11
130,The Dorchester is perfect!!!,"I regard The Dorchester as my London home from home and feel happy and relaxed as soon as I walked through its doors.  Petronella, Anika and Katarina in guests relations do amazing jobs, George and the rest of the Hallporters/Concierges are outstanding and Roland Fasel (the hotel’s General Manager), and his PA Janice, always go out of their way to help me. The staff make this hotel but the rooms refurbished by Alexandra Champalimaud with Aromatherapy Associations bath products, Lalique light fittings and Bang & Olufsen plasma televisions are a dream too.",5,2013,09,08
130,This hotel can really get it wrong,"This is my third stay at the Dorchester in 6 weeks, each time the room gets worse, my current one is just depressing.There are bits missing off taps in the bathroom the mini bar is empty, the toiletries are half missing, staff come to the wrong room, generally the hotel has an air of staff being too busy to actually fix the basics. It's not the most expensive room but at 600 pounds it could be hoped to be not so run down.",2,2013,09,08
130,Fabulous !,"Decided to try the Dorchester during my recent visit to London. Booked through AMEX Centurion and I was in for a treat. All the benefits were furnished, the receptionist even went the extra mile to upgrade me to a much higher category, without me asking. In conclusion, I will definately come back as i was impressed by the service and the staff and the quality of the rooms, very comfortable. Breakfast at the Promenade is not to be missed. 
The difference between this hotel and other hotels in London is that the staff are eager to deliver what is promised rather than come up with un justified excuses. That in itself is what is going to make me stay at the Dorchester again.",5,2013,09,08
130,Drink & Dinner .... Impeccable from all points of view!,"I know that you are allowed to expect excellence when going to such palaces, The Dorchester Bar and Restaurant kept his promises.
I do not think I have ever met staff as attentive and caring than at the Dorchester. Though discrete, there is always one member of the staff near you to look after you or even better anticipate what you might want or look for.
The dinner was exquisite. We booked for a 3 course meal (for 35£!!, hello you cannot dine for that price in most regular restaurants) and have been offered a 7 course one: baskets of 7 different kind of homemade breads, amuse-bouche, starter, meal, palet cleanser, dessert, petits fours, and complimentary wine. All were more than delicious, and served with such elegance.
I definitely recommend it and would gladly go back to the Dorchester at the next occasion! Who does not like being treated like a princess?? ;-)",5,2013,09,03
130,Usual high standard,"Most of the reviews it seems cover the standard points. However. The wine list is also excellent and the comparrative cost makes this an ideal base from which to explore the best London has to offer.

The staff are attentative and immaculate. Waiters excell and the chefs cook andcreate food which is outstanding.",5,2013,08,29
130,"One fine weekend at the Dorchester, Mayfair","A breathtaking hotel located in the city centre.  Elegant, refined and majestic.  The suites absolutely gorgeous with antique furniture and beautiful clean bathrooms with sparkling floors.  Perfectly located on Park Lane overlooking Hyde Park and the wonderful city of London.  The Dorchester has a variety of renound restaurants where one can savour the culinary skills of the various chefs.  Breakfast is luxurious and oustanding.  Afternoon tea, most probably one of the best in London.  Exceptional staff.  A truly traditional British hotel full of glamour and elegance.  
Families are more than welcome at the Dorchester and the children enjoy being spoilt.  Truly oustanding and an absolute must.",5,2013,08,25
130,Melting chocolate pudding to die for. Incredible!,"My husband participated in Lindon Ride 100 & we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here to prepare & relax. 

The incredible and totally enveloping aroma if fresh rises on arrival is simply Devine. 

The grill staff are second to none and the food top notch. 

Prices are so reasonable; wine list as to be expected just choose wisely according to your budget

Delightful!",5,2013,08,23
130,good job,"My husband and I just returned from our 17 day trip to the UK.  The first part for 8 days was at the Dorchester.  We shipped our luggage with a luggage service and I got a note from the hotel saying it had arrived (before we even left the US) and then to say it was placed in our room, would we like it unpacked (we declined the offer).  We booked through Amex Platinum Fine hotel and resorts and we were given a lovely complimentary upgrade to a lovely room.  Yes we did book the room for the night before as we knew we would be arriving at 6:30 am.  We asked for a car to pick us up at the airport and he was there just as promised and what a lovely man as well.  Filled me in on all the latest happenings of Corrie Street that I have not seen for 4 years, thanks Rupert, what a great start to a vacation to be picked up by such a fantastic fun person regardless of the early hour.

High Tea was great one afternoon.  The concierges, to many to name and the doormen again to many to name were all fantastic as were all the front of line employees including bar staff, and everyone we came in contact with. The theatre  desk was most helpful as well.

One of my favorite things was the entertainment in the evening, after high tea and till maybe 11 pm give or take, they have a piano player, singer.  This was very pleasant and really makes you feel like you are on holiday as there is nothing like it in our city.

The bar had my husband's favorite vodka again not available  in our ""big"" city and we do live in a large city.  

Overall the Dorchester delivers all it promises, honors all you are promised from Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts (not all hotels were that honorable) and we were not disappointed.

Thanks to all the staff to numerous to mention by name individually, for making our stay very pleasant, enjoyable and comfortable.",5,2013,08,21
130,Lovely!,"I went to the Dorchester for some evening tea with a few friends. I was delighted with the attentive service right from the start! We enjoyed the lovely live music , and were served by a smiling waiter, even though  it was 1:30am!  The tea was worth the money, and there was no hesitation to any request, from outr table. We never felt unimportant, even though we were just there for coffee and tea, and the magnificent floral displays werea heavenly addition! I will definitely be visiting again!",5,2013,08,16
130,Delightful Dorchester,"We visited the Grill at the Dorchester two weeks ago and enjoyed every moment of our time there.  Wonderful pre-dinner drinks were followed by a delicious meal. The service was efficient yet not stuffy or over-bearing and we felt comfortable and well looked after, particularly my husband who was celebrating his Birthday. We dined next to a table occupied by Mr Anton Mosimann, a culinary 'hero' of mine.  What better recommendation could there be for fine dining? Excellent value for money and we shall return.",5,2013,08,11
130,Pleasant Hotel,"Stayed just one night and did not use any facilities. The room was fine, check in good, pleasant people, overall a nice stay. We have eaten in China Tang on a desperate occasion and found this to be very expensive for a very average restaurant.",4,2013,08,10
130,Not quite everything you'd expect for such a price,"It has such a reputation that I found the rooms and the staff just a little disappointing. The breakfast was a tad meager and I found some members of staff a little terse. Maybe I was just expecting more- there was nothing tremendously wrong with it, but just didn't blow my socks off...",3,2013,08,10
130,Spectacular !!!!,"Me & my family, we stayed at The Dorchester from the 15th uptill the 19th of July
Our family decided to stay back a few days after a family wedding and we chose The Dorchester.. 
A simply wonderful & a must repeat experience.. The service at the hotel was superb.. very professional, courteous helpful and friendly...We were Royally treated.. 
  
The rooms were large, air conditioned with a king sized bed, large flat screen TV, Bose sound system with iPod connection, good wardrobe space. A large Bathroom with a huge bath and walk-in shower.
Breakfasts in 'The Grill' and 'On the Promenade' were superb.
This is a expensive hotel,  but I think it was excellent value given the overall quality of our stay. 
Location is unbeatable, right in the heart of the London´s most wanted locations.",4,2013,08,09
130,AMAZING STAY !!!!,"Well , where do I start!.....
My husband and I treated ourselves to an overnight stay at this iconic hotel . From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty- whether it be by the Guest Services Manager who greeted us at check in  ( A very early check in at 1pm which I requested via email before arrival ) or by the fantastic staff in the Dorchester Bar 
I have stayed here several times prior to this stay and this place never disappoints - If you are looking for five star service in an iconic and oppulent location then The Dorchester is for you
I sneaked out for a bit of shopping while my husband treated himself to a traditional shave in the barbers next to the spa, who I believe have been resident in the hotel for 20 years or more
Afternoon Tea is yummy as are the Champagne Shimmer Cocktails - which come with your own little drizzle of edible gold and a lip gloss - at £28 a go , they are definately naughty but very nice and worth every sip! 
Several members of staff remembered our names during our stay , the attention to detail is what makes hotels like The Dorchester stand out from the rest, genuinely excellent, personal service without being pretentious
We shall definately return in the near future- cant wait!",5,2013,08,06
130,Simply Excellent,"CCelebrated my wife's 50th birthday with a weekend here.

The service was superb, with perhaps the most helpful and courteous hotel staff I have ever experienced. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone and we were made to feel like royalty.

I booked the stay about two months prior to the event and only just managed to get a table at Alain Ducasse (one of only four - three star Michelin restaurants in the UK), located inside the hotel, on the Friday evening.  This was spectacularly good and the subject of a separate review.

Other things to book well in advance include afternoon tea - 'On the Balcony' which is a different (and higher priced) option to afternoon tea on the 'Promenade', and Spa sessions.

We were give a free room upgrade when we arrived - this was part of deal that was available via making the booking directly with The Dorchester, rather than a web site or agency. Our room was large, fully air conditioned with a king sized bed, large flat screen TV, Bose sound system with iPod connection, good wardrobe space with one of the best stocked mini bars I have ever seen.  Bathroom was excellent too with a huge bath and walk-in shower. It over looked the nicely maintained roof garden.

Food (apart from Alain Ducasse) was excellent - breakfasts in 'The Grill' and 'On the Promenade' were superb, with a full a la carte menu on offer, and of course, exquisite service.

This is not a cheap hotel, having said that, you can easily pay more in London, but I think it was excellent value given the overall quality of our stay.  I thoroughly recommend The Dorchester and will seek out other ""Dorchester Collection"" establishments around the world, should the opportunity arise.",5,2013,08,04
130,MARVELOUS HOTEL,"We stayed here after crossing the ocean on the Queen Mary II.This was a lovely hotel,with a beautiful lobby type restaurant for breakfast.Most fascinating was the t.v. set which presented a screen opening when you turned it on.(How did they do that?)The doormen and concierge were very pleasant and helpful,the room was lovely,and through American Express booking we got a full breakfast daily and 85 pounds to spend in the hotel.The neighborhood was great and we took many walks to Hyde Park across the way and to see the marvelous architecture of the area.",5,2013,08,04

130,"Fabulous dinner, excellent staff, made the birthday girl feel really special","Had a really good meal on a Saturday evening in The Grill . Staff are welcoming and attentive without being overbearing .

Just lovely and much appreciated . Will return !",5,2013,07,31
130,The only place to stay in London as long as your not on a budget,"I've been lucky enough to stay at the Dorchestor hotel,london many times, the service is second to none, the hotel itself is immaculate and very well maintained, although this hotel is expensive if its luxury and service you are looking for you won't go far wrong with the Dorchestor, if I were to look for something negative to say, the only thing I could think of is the breakfast is overpriced",5,2013,07,29
130,Excellent,"Just attended a wedding here so we decided to stay overnight. 
On arrival we were welcomed cordially and entered the reception. There are a lot of staff standing around which felt a bit uncomfortable at times.

130,Buzzing London,"Just spent a great holiday at The Dorchester Hotel in London as a special treat with my younger sister. This hotel has all the luxuries that you want out of a holiday, from the fluffy bathrobes to the French cuisine, wonderful British food,cocktails at the bar and tea on  the Promenade and not forgetting the polite and wonderful staff at your beck and call. We were there the week the royal baby arrived and the atmosphere was electric with people from all around the world joining in the celebrations. The hotel is situated in Mayfair overlooking Hyde Park, it is a ten minute walk to Knightsbridge and Oxford Street where you can shop till you drop. I have visited London many times in the summer and the weather has never disappointed, this year it was hot hot but lovely.So if you want  to know and enjoy how the rich live then visit The Dorchester, London it will not disappoint you ,so go on indulge yourself ?",5,2013,07,28
130,Great hotel to stay in,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Dorchester. While not the cheapest hotel in London, it is certainly one of the best. The hotel mixes tradition well with modern touches to ensure that there is a unique identity which isn't lacking the facilities you would expect in a modern hotel.

The staff were friendly and excellent, despite it being a hotel frequented by celebrities and VIP's we were never made to feel second rate even if we were walking around in daggy clothes in the British heat.

The breakfast is top notch and the bar makes very good martini's. All round pleasure",5,2013,07,28
130,An Amazing experience,"Have returned home after an amazing day had afternoon tea at the Dorchester with three friends. It was very special, service was first class staff very very friendly and nothing was to much bother we were made to feel welcome and special. Thank you so very much",5,2013,07,27
130,Loved it.,"We stayed 10 days at The Dorchester and now we will compare everything else to that.  The bed was very comfortable.  The pillows nice and smooshy.  The shower was incredible....the amount of water pressure was heavenly.  Usually, I have to find the perfect spot under the shower to get all the shampoo and conditioner out of my hair....not at The Dorchester!  It was like a fire hose!  Big fluffy towels, not small ones like you get everywhere else, but bath sheets.  Everyone was very friendly and concerned that we were getting everything we needed.  Our laundry was retuned within hours....we were completely amazed.  And the way they put tissue paper in the t-shirts and cute little cardboard belts around the socks made me giggle.  Oh there were a few times I felt like I didn't quite measure up to their standards, but it was because we were in t-shirts and shorts after 5pm.
We absolutely loved 2 of the bartenders and the Promenade Bar: Chris and Diego.  They were so friendly and efficient and well as knowledgeable.  The drinks they made were the best I've ever had. Amazing.  We also loved the location.  It was just a quick skitter across the road to Hyde Park where I ran every morning.  The Metro station was super close as well.  We walked to most places during the day.",5,2013,07,26
130,Great Weekend,"We stayed at The Dorchester for 1 night whilst visiting the 100 celebration of Aston Martin in Kensington Palace Gardens. As you walk in the fragrance from hundreds of lilies in reception hits you . It's amazing. The reception staff were excellent, quick and very friendly.The room was lovely and bed extremely comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was great and large portions ! I had pancakes and it was actually1 pancake but the size of a dinner plate! Yum yum really good , All the staff were really friendly and helpful, and I would definitely recommend it.",5,2013,07,22
130,The definition of Five Star Luxury.,"My husband and I had our fifth wedding anniversary on July 19th. We had decided to book Afternoon Tea and an overnight stay at The Dorchester as our means of celebration. My expectations were already heightened having previously enjoyed some excellent Afternoon Teas there in recent years. 
We cannot thank the staff enough for making what was already a special day into something we will truly treasure for the rest of our lives. We were completely looked after from start to finish. Our room was upgraded to a suite so luxurious it took a good half an hour of walking around with our mouths open for it to sink in we would be spending the night here. The service was faultless - from our dietary difficulties with afternoon tea (I am dairy intolerant, my husband is lactose intolerant) to providing a complimentary bottle of excellent champagne on ice in our room. All the staff we encountered were helpful, friendly, discreet and attentive. We enjoyed some mouthwatering cocktails in the comfortable bar, and our breakfast the next morning was divine - plentiful and delicious. The bed was so comfortable I actually took down a note of the mattress and linen make! I cannot recommend spending a special occasion here highly enough. I use TripAdvisor regularly to carry out holiday research but this is the first time I've felt inspired to write a review of my own. Well done The Dorchester, and thank you again!",5,2013,07,22
130,"exceptional service, treated like royalty, Marisa and Pat, Southend","I came to the Dorchester for tea on 18th July. I treated my friend for her birthday. From the minute we stepped through the door the service was amazing. We had Marvin the marvellous Malteser! waiting on us, he made us feel so welcome and engaged everyone he served in conversation, nothing was too much trouble for him. To those people who may be wary about visiting after reading bad reviews, I would say, go and find out for yourself and then form an opinion, and ask to be served by Marvin,  and to those people who think the service is bad and isn't value for money one can only assume you are perhaps not used to dining out regularly. We enjoyed it so much I have already told other friends about it and we will be visiting again as soon as possible. p.s. Marvin, if you see Michael Buble, tell him Marisa loves him! ",5,2013,07,21

The concierge, are the absolute cream. No problem, request too large or too small. The are the seamless, can do everything engine room of the hotel.
Beds very comfortable, room service excellent...
Faultless.
I will stay here every time I visit London.
We ate at the Chinese restaurant in house which was ok.....just...service here not so fab, but many great restaurants in Lindon to choose from.",5,2013,07,21
130,Quintessentially English.,"This was my first stay at this Amazing hotel and it definately won't be the last! The lady at reception called Emma was an absolute joy! Attentive, polite and just a lovely girl. In fact all the staff were wonderful. The promenade was delightful for lunch and breakfast and I didn't want to leave the wonderful room. I need a bed like that in my home! We will 110% be visiting The Dorchester again very soon.",5,2013,07,20
130,Excellent,"My boyfriend took me to The Dorchester for 2 nights for a treat and wow I was amazed. From arriving and the staff at the front door helping us in with our bags and asking how we were to the staff on reception upgrading us on arrival. I was very impressed. Although we had about a 30 minute wait for our room we didn't care as it was so lovely to sit in the reception area, people watching and knowing we had a room upgrade. Our room was absolutely exquisite.... I cannot tell you how happy we were. Everything was immaculate  and perfect. I would highly recommend having your breakfast delivered to your room, we certainly did both mornings and it was fantastic. Yes a bit pricier but you don't mind as it is fab! 

Unfortunately there was one problem with our stay :( 
On check out at 12 noon, we had to wait until 1pm for our car to pick us up for our journey back to the airport.... So we checked out and we asked if it was ok to sit and wait. The lady at reception assured us it was perfectly ok to sit and wait in the lobby area (where people sit and have a coffee or snacks) also another lady serving there said it was fine and asked us if we would like anything. So we were sat there waiting....no one had asked us to take our bags and the most rude man ever who worked there whispered to another member of staff what we were doing just sitting there and they all started staring at us. It was extremely uncomfortable. Then another member of staff came over and done the same. So basically a few members of staff were not happy with us sitting there waiting for our car, although we were like all the other guests in the hotel who had spend about £2000 for our 2 nights stay!! I was very hurt at this, simply because we were away to travel home, yes we were not dressed up, Infact dressed down but you do not treat guests of your hotel like this. We also did not get a goodbye as we left....just a stare! Extremely rude. Also I went back up to reception to enquire about the possibility of us staying at the Dorchester again in January, but the lady I got was very vague and said hmm I don't have those rates available. I then asked when she would or could she check for me....no she couldn't. Wow we obviously were not the type of guests the Dorchester want?! It's such a shame we received this 'service' as we were leaving as the rest of the stay was amazing and all of the staff we had met before that had been fantastic. 
So...not really sure we will be staying in January!! It's such a shame as every guest should be treated the same.",5,2013,07,18
130,Appalling service,"I had a terrible experience during afternoon tea at the Dorchester.  As reflected in other reviews the service was the slowest I have ever encountered- as someone else mentioned the staff quickly moved their focus to other tables.  We were there for 2 and a half hours before the cakes arrived and when they did the waitress couldn't even recall what they were.  Our tea by then was stone cold and not an offer of a refill came our way.  A glass of champagne was pushed over into my lap, onto my belongings.  Barely a sorry left the young girls mouth.  Please, please if you have any sense take your money elsewhere.  I have since heard great things about Claridges.",1,2013,07,17
130,A Real Treat,"A special birthday treat for my wife's 40th Birthday.  Live up to all expectation.  Lovely room and bed, excellent service and attention to detail. The mini-bar has to be seen to be believed but wasn't used after a rather large dinner. Breakfast (I had lambs kidneys) thrown in for free for our celebration and complimentary champagne in the room too.  Cheap? No, but you get what you pay for.",5,2013,07,17
130,"Superb ultra-helpful staff, beautiful venue","When we sought directions at Reception, to the Spa where we had booked afternoon tea, the really helpful representative did more than give directions- she took us downstairs to the Spa.  At the lovely Spa, the staffer recognized us to be foreign visitors and suggested we might want to experience the superb elegance of the Promenade, upstairs.  She made multiple efforts to get us a table there even though it had been fully booked, even sending a colleague to speak to the maitre D in person.  The very friendly and helpful maitre d arranged a table.  Service at  the restaurant was extraordinarily attentive and the tea and sandwiches delicious and plentiful.  Scones and accompaniments and pastries were also delightful.  When I later found the lobby shop closed when I attempted to buy the special tea, the wonderful woman at Reception said she could have it opened for me and sought the help of the night manager, who looked through the shop for tea without success except for a small bag he offered to me (and boxed) with his compliments.  Meanwhile the reception rep went over to the restaurant and arranged to get a large bag from them, for which they kindly improvised a fair price.  Needless to say the marble-columned  and flower-bedecked Promenade was the most beautiful spot in which we have ever dined. ",5,2013,07,15
130,"Fantastic experience , watch out for the bar !","Fantastic experience but be warned that the cost of pre-meal drinks in the bar are a bit excessive at 2 basic drinks for  more than £20.00 for mere mortals like myself who are not used to frequenting such establishments !
However staff , service , food and value for money with a voucher, was second to none !!",5,2013,07,15
130,Elegant hotel adjacent to Hyde Park,The Dorchester is one of the truly grand hotels of London. Friendly staff greets you at the front desk as the scent of the beautiful towering arrangement of cut flowers wafts by. The rooms are pretty and spacious. Bathrooms are huge and well lit. Room service arrives quickly. Concierge incredibly helpful. People watching in the bar is fun thanks to the eclectic international set that stays here. A really lovely experience!,5,2013,07,14
130,Fabulous,"My Mother and I had afternoon tea at the Dorchester and it was wonderful. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the staff could not do enough for us. Really lovely service, Serena the sweet Italian waitress made the experience really special for us both. We were offered more more of everything and it was all delicious. Perfect.",5,2013,06,27
130,Apaling service,"I have been going to Dorchester for some time but I must say because of what happend I don't think I will be returning .
As we walk unto the premadd the waitress name aza I think an Eastern European was very rude and refuse to give us a seat and told us to go by the bar and just seat when I was about to seat near the bar she came and shouted at us as if we where nothing and said I told you not to seat there . As we sat by the bar we waited for 20 min as we where ignored until I call a waiter and order an expensive bottle of champagne that's when they became really nice and attention ate when I asked to speak to the manager he came and try to tell me the waitress's was unabailabke as she went home but she was walking past him so I pointed to him and he was covered in shame . He apologise and the waitress came after being told off to apologise which I didn't accept . Dorchester don't just recruit anyone screen those people's properly because they are damaging your name and for this reason I prefere to spend my money elsewhere .",3,2013,06,22
130,Spot on every time,"I stayed here with my partner to celebrate my birthday.

It was perfect-from start to finish, as always.

The staff are extremely professional yet friendly, and the rooms are faultless.

We also stayed here for Christmas, we had a suite and 2 rooms as we took some family with us, and everyone made us so welcome it was like Christmas at home without any clearing up!

We visit a few times a year, even though we live 30 mins away!

Would recommend to anyone and everyone!",5,2013,06,22
130,Great place to honeymoon,"After several frustrating days in airports trying to get to London, we arrived at the Dorchester on our honeymoon and were SO glad we had splurged on this hotel.  The service was amazing from start to finish.  When we arrived, my husband had left his jacket in the cab, and the doorman ran after the car and got it back.  We were greeted with champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a hand-written note in our room (what a nice touch!)  The gentleman at the front desk who checked us in remembered our names several days later when we asked a question about check out.  And the housekeeping went above and beyond (she even fluffed the chair cushions and pillows twice a day!)

Meals and tea were also wonderful. We had breakfast included each day (you could choose between sitting in the Grille and the Promenade-- we preferred to eat in the Promenade). The freshly squeezed orange juice and eggs benedict were great.  My husband got the Traditional English Breakfast each morning. Afternoon tea was also excellent-- save room though because by the time we got to the scones we were getting pretty full!  They also brought out a little ""congratulations"" cake for our honeymoon.

The only tiny issue was that the free wi-fi was somewhat inconsistent in our room.  It always worked fine in the lobby, so we used breakfast to catch up on email, etc.

We spent several days in Scotland after we left London, and anytime something went slightly awry at the hotel, we kept saying ""this would NEVER happen at the Dorchester!""

I would highly recommend the Dorchester as a place to spend a honeymoon!",5,2013,06,18
130,Birthday Celebration,"My husband and I had a night at the Dorchester to celebrate his birthday. It was a fabulous experience. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendlier, and nothing was too much trouble for them. When we arrived in to our room, there was a fruit platter and a birthday cake waiting for us.
The flowers are truly out of this world. 
I can not wait to return again one day.",5,2013,06,18
130,Surprise Surprise!,"Looking forward to my 60th birthday treat - to see War Horse in London - fully expecting to stay at the usual place, Covent Garden Travel Lodge. Imagine when husband takes us to Park Lane and we arrive at The Dorchester. First reaction OMG how much? Second am I dressed OK? Needn't have worried - he got a reasonable (gulp)  deal and it was WONDERFUL. The best! With champagne, cake, afternoon tea and breakfast. Lush, plush and the most amazing service we have ever (or will ever - probably!) experienced - friendly, unpompous, fun, entertaining and interesting. The staff made the experience. Thank you!",5,2013,06,18
130,an absolute dream,"what can you say about the Dorchester?! it really lives up to its reputation. incredible food, beautiful room, gorgeous bed. really feel like royalty staying here. wish we could move in permanently. went to a wedding here last summer and decided to get a room as we had a wee baby. best decision i could have made. used the spa which was so nice, staff very helpful.",5,2013,06,08
130,3rd time back and already booked again,"Simply the most friendly and professional hotel around. Special thanks to Avi for his complimentary  champagne in our room and at the table. Plus putting up with my demands. Lol  We have booked again in August for 2 nights as you know your going to get the same perfect service. 

Tips - promenade bar is a must very classy and chilled.",5,2013,06,08
130,Imaculate Service,"I stay here for three days and the service is a standout feature of this grand hotel. The day and night managers bent over backward to help, even when the request (at midnight) was for a change of room when there was an issue with the air conditioning . Firstly the engineer arrived in 2 minutes and quickly determined that the problem was not a ""quick fix"" then 3 staff including the night manger arrived to move everything to a new room. In the morning I talked to the manager again mentioned that I preferred the original rooms decor rather than the recently redecorated ""modern"" rooms. The day manager found a room for me and moved everything again! What more could you ask for in service!
The rooms are large by London standards, well appointed, and immaculately clean. All the linen was plush and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was large with everything that is needed for a comfortable stay and the location is excellent.
We also went to the Bar, The Grill, and had Afternoon Tea in the ""Promenade"" all were of very good quality, but once again it was the service which shone.",5,2013,06,01
130,Step back in time....,"Step into a different world as you pass through the revolving door. The fragrance of roses mixed with a dash of cigar was the first thing I noticed ( the inviting smell of "" old money "").  We stayed 10 days and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay, except maybe some of the food ( see restaurant reviews if interested ). Our room was done in antiques complete with creaky floors. All mod cons are cleverly concealed behind or within furnishings, including TV, minibar, and even some plug- ins on the desk ( take the time to have everything explained when escorted to your room after check- in ). While the room was not large- we were too tired to notice we had not been upgraded as requested- it was supremely comfortable and everything was in good repair. 
We loved our room service breakfasts, wheeled in daily by a delightful gent who never missed a beat and remembered our strawberry allergy. There was so much food we often stashed the pastry basket for later, and it was all delicious, though the gammon bacon was a tad salty. 
Bathroom was lovely and included a frosted window which opened. A word of caution, if you have ANY mobility issues, make sure you get a room with a walk- in shower. The tub/ shower combo we had was very deep, and rather difficult to get into and out of. 
Staff deserves very high praise throughout. I fell ill the day after check- in, and within a few hours a housecalll was all arranged, and the Dr. was kind and efficient. We found some of the concierge team to be snobby, but just dealt with others who could not have been nicer or more efficient. 
I had read some reviews complaining about the stuffy outdated decor,but personally I loved it and found it perfect for London. The place is steeped in history; if you're lucky enough to stay here, imagine all the famous or infamous people who have walked down the same hallways. Just before check in I heard a great story of a singer songwriter in the '60 s who was staying here. He heard a knock on the door, and when he opened it, before him stood the most famous actress in the world, dressed in a revealing negligee and holding 2 kittens sporting diamond collars. Anything can happen here....",5,2013,06,01
130,fantastic service!,Me and my friends went for a birthday lunch and the service was 5* plus!. food was lovely and staff were very attentive even came upto our table just to wish us happy birthday....And the staff took it upon themselves to bring out a cake with a candle on it with no prompting whatsoever...Absolutely delightful afternoon! cant wait to go back!!,5,2013,06,01
130,A lovely treat,"A select group of work colleagues set off for a day of development and indulgence and happened upon the £55 per head set menu option at the Dorchester. Not an every day price but perfect for this occasion and group. We had several courses with the superbly attentive staff guiding us through the wine list and describing our food before service. 

The one bottle of wine we bought (the meal came with a glass each) was the lowest price on the menu at £25 but prices went up to about £8000 to suit every budget.

I also managed to squeeze in a business meeting in the lobby which is perfectly suited for such events and acted as a most impressive backdrop to the prospective business partner. 

A superb visit and great value for money.",5,2013,05,31
130,Fabulous!,"Stayed for one evening in May, on my way to Scotland.  I was meeting a group in Edinburgh the next day, so I checked in after a transatlantic flight.  The Plaza Athenee Paris is one of my all time favorite hotels and the Dorchester certainly belongs in that group as well.  I enjoyed a great massage in the spa, a nice dinner in the Grill and a nightcap in the bar with a jazz trio.  Just a sublime evening.  The room was terrific and the entire ambience of the hotel s just perfect.  

I cannot wait to return with the entire family.",5,2013,05,29
130,Never Disappoints,"Having stayed here on several other occasions the level of service is always outstanding.My wife and i arrived early and they accommodated us with a room strait away and then shifted us to another newly refurbished room we didn't like it because the bed was extremely hard and the decor was not in keeping with other rooms and the aircon was noisy so we asked to change but could not accommodate as the hotel was full.They shifted us on the 3 rd night to and old style room overlooking the park which was very nice this was very good service.
My son and i had a late  dinner at the chinese restaurant which was good.A special thank you to Katerina who help sort out the room for us and really went out of the way to make sure we were happy.Also kurt at concierge who help sort out a problem with other transfer to the airport.
I would not stay anywhere else when staying in London expensive but value for money you are made welcomed and not snobby like other hotel in London. The only positive feedback on can give when you refurbish the rooms please try to keep the same feel which we are used to if it isn't broken in doesn't  need to be fixed.",5,2013,05,28
130,Great hotel,"Excellent service, great location, great bars and restaurants make this one of the best places to stay in London.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Only problem is the heavy floral theme.

Will be returning again.",4,2013,05,28
130,Had lunch,"Great! Very clean, service was impeccable (best I have ever had) food was good and they was not stingy on the food. This is a must. The piano player was good too. I really enjoyed lunch. The scenery really relaxed n the tea kept on coming.",5,2013,05,27
130,Very nice hotel with outstanding service,Well located in Hyde Park Hotel. Grandious terrace for breakfast and afternoon tea with impecable service. Although the Dorchester is an Icon it may lack some of the ameneties of more modern or newer hotels.,4,2013,05,25
130,Must be included in your 'do before I die list',"This hotel amazing, luxurious, welcoming and beyond words,  I only had the opportunity to sample this dream hotel luxury as the company I work for paid for a weekend in London which included The Dorchester, having arrived in jeans and anoraks (due to our great British weather) I felt well out of place, however the staff still treated us like royalty and could not have been more helpful, friendly or accommodating.  The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the best night sleep Ive ever had in any hotel",5,2013,05,23
130,Wow! Perfection!,We stayed for one night for my birthday and I can only say what an experience. Top marks to all the staff that made me feel so special! We ate in the Alain ducasse restaurant which was the best food I have ever eaten and again the service was excellent! This was the best birthday I have ever had! Thanks so much to everyone! ,5,2013,05,21
130,The best hotel in London!  The best anywhere!,"Pure heaven!  These four days at the Dorchester were beyond any doubt the finest hotel experience of my life, and I have known quite a few world-class hotels.  Staff at all levels have been trained to excel in their contact with guests.  Bravo!",5,2013,05,21
130,The Very Best!,"The Dorchester is once again at the very top of London's galaxy of luxury hotels.   With a staff trained to perfection, no detail is too small.  Client recognizability is impressive.

The Park Suites are just breathtaking.  If money is no object, or if you can swing one of their off-season ""specials"", a stay in a Hyde Park-view suite can be the experience of a lifetime.  Flowers, chocolates, fruit, champagne, first-rate butlers, it's all there.

Four days in May 2013 was just wonderful, absolutely no false note.  This grandest of London's grand hotels runs rings around some of its luxury competition.",5,2013,05,21
130,"Great vodka martinis, super slow dining room service","Nice ambience, décor, setting, super seeing exotic cars in lot outside Lobby
Great Bar service.
But Slow Food Service for dinner.
& Yet hotel is booked solid but lack food service wait staff, doesn't add up.
Great for meet others in lobby & head out to see city etc.
Food Service was for PM dinner.",3,2013,05,19
130,dorchester,"great location for restaurants  and shopping in mayfair belgravia and Knightsbridge,its in park lane so easy access every where , rooms are clean smart but no wow factor, they have ruined the down stairs art deco bar, by referb into an arab style club type bar  so tacky now.  afternoon tea is nice in the hall , i would pass on the restaurant  very expensive , service average, had duck for lunch was not able  to eat, would not be my first choice of london  hotel to stay in, but would be in my top ten in london",3,2013,05,19
130,Love Love Love,"Stayed at this hotel for my birthday a few months ago and loved it. After my mum had an awful Savoy experience it was refreshing to stay in a lovely 5 star hotel. Room lovely, staff lovely. I could not fault the hotel one bit. I shall be returning at the end of my honeymoon next month for another lovely time.",5,2013,05,14
130,A Truly 5 Star Experience,"It is very easy to find fault when ever you reach a standard of hotel that is, or is similar to, The Dorchester. Having been a regular for 20 plus years I can very easily tell you what's wrong with the place but trust me, this is an ""institution"" that few in the world can compare.. Rooms, suites, bathrooms are all of the highest standard and constantly being re decorated - re furnished. In room dining caters 24 hours a day for just about every type of cuisine out there. And then there's the dining facilities .. Where else can you find a first class Grill Room, a superb Italian menu bar, a 3 Michelin star French restaurant, a truly top Chinese experience along side a all day every day Promenade serving a light menu from breakfast onward. Located within walking distance of London's Mayfair, Bond St' and Oxford St' shops it is hard, if not impossible to compare !!! ",5,2013,05,14
130,Excellent,"I have stayed in a number of the luxury hotels in London and this is always our favourite.  Check in is a breeze, we had a spacious, exquisitely furnished room with views over Hyde Park, a good size luxury bathroom with nice toiletries. Our room had a four poster bed and was very clean.  The staff were all well mannered and friendly and our service experience has always been impeccable.  We had cocktails at the bar, breakfast was good, We had dinner at the Dorchester grill one evening  when we were too lazy to go out and the food was good. the Dorchester's Mayfair location is good for visiting Buckingham Palace etc. and it is an easy walk to both Knightsbridge and the Bond Street area for shopping.  One piece of advice if you have afternoon tea, you probably wont have enough room left for dinner that evening!!!!!",5,2013,05,14
130,Excellent,"Excellent in every way. A 5 star hotel that has earned its stars with no exception. Our room was newly redecorated and outstanding. The concierge and front desk were extremely helpful, professional and attentive. The wait staff and doormen also. Mayfair is a great location with lots of lovely streets to wander through. Hyde Park is across the street, St. James's within walking distance, and we even walked back from Kensington Palace to the hotel, but more like a meander through stores and Kensington Gardens...",5,2013,05,13
130,"NO LONGER AN ENGLISH HOTEL, BELIEVE ME","I first starting staying at the Dorchester twenty seven years ago on an average of
every three years.  I loved that hotel, it was so English and that was what I was
looking for.  The staff went out of their way with kindness toward my children and
absolute friendliness toward me. The service was impecccable, the food
top quality and beautifully prepared and the rooms were beautiful and well
appointed. The lobby was beautifully decorated and  fresh flowers abounded
filling the space with a lovely fragrance.  What more could one ask for?
I was at the Dorchester the week of May 3, 2013 and while I've seen changes
occurring nothing prepared me for what I saw at that time.  While the service
is still up to par and the decor is still lovely, the clientel is mostly Middle Eastern.
Arabic is wildly spoken and many women are dressed in Burkas.  Hardly what
I'd call an English hotel.  English high tea is very expensive and one should expect
that, however, it was a disaster. I believe in dressing comfortably and casually
when the occasion calls, however, I saw men walk in wearing t-shirts with various
logos such as, Dubai, Now is the time to gather, etc. Definitely not appropriate dress
for high tea.
  No longer visable are the tiered trays laden with
all manner of sweets and pastries. Trays yes, but with very little offerings.
 No chocolates, the food offered was minimal
and not very tasty and the scones were small, hard and cold. I know clotted cream
and what they served was more  a combination of whipped cream and butter, greasy.
The cost for English high tea with a glass of champagne (only one glass unlike
other hotels which keep refilling) was 69 pounds which roughly  converts to $114.00
before the tip at the then current rate exchange.  If you are looking for a truly
English experience go to Claridges, Connaught or Browns hotels.  Hope this
helped. .Thank you.",3,2013,05,10
130,Excellent service,"I stayed at the Dorchester on Easter weekend. We got an upgrade without asking. The rooms were very clean and luxurious  and had everything you need.
The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you, probably the most attentive staff without being intrusive I have experienced. 
The food was fabulous, especially the breakfast. We spent time in the Bar and enjoyed a couple of cocktails, they are not cheap but are similar prices to other top hotels in London.
The Location was great especially for a walk in Hyde park, we actually walked to Knightsbridge through the gardens which was very pleasant.
If you want a bit of Luxury then a stay at the Dorchester is a must.",5,2013,05,09
130,Best hotel in London,"I keep coming back to The Dorchester, having tried most of the 5 star hotels in London. A previous reviewer has called the hotel quintessentially English and I cannot disagree. Something wonderful about that experience, difficult to get anywhere else in the world",5,2013,05,08
130,"""Quintessentially English"".",The Dorchester has and always will be my favourite London Hotel...It upholds all the elegance and sophistication that you would expect from a traditional english hotel...staff are eager to please...food is delicious...especially afternoon tea...linen etc is clean and crisp...and to enhance all its finery... to the degree which makes me never want to leave...are the lavishly arranged fragrant floral displays...I'm not surprised celebrities choose this establishment as their base when visiting the capital...why wouldn't you?...Kx,5,2013,05,07
130,Sheer Indulgence,"It really is one of the great hotels and, unless you are the sort of person who may take this level of surrounding/service for granted, a real treat. Small observations: On the odd occasion when not busy too many staff can cluster and then try to be overhelpful (gets quite wearysome). I also think it a great mistake to put staff with a more limited command of English on reception - I completely get the need for multi-cultural approach (especially languages) but having to slowly go through a simple check-in, courteous though it was, is rather odd.The Dorchester is a great LONDON hotel and I believe it is totally right that it be fronted accordingly.",5,2013,05,06
130,Almost excellent stay at The Dorchester.,"I stayed two nights at this property in May 2012.  Upon arrival, I was greeted by the bellman and my luggage was promptly handled by the porter and I was led inside.  At Reception, I was  greeted by name and my check-in was handled courteously and efficiently.  Minutes later I was escorted to my room and provided a quick tour and made sure any questions I had about my accommodations were addressed.  The staff presented me with not one, but two welcome plates of fruit which was a nice touch.  My room was situated on the 7th floor with a view of Deanery Street so there was very little street noise but also no view of Hyde Park.  I also did not detect any noise from the hallway or from adjacent rooms.  One thing I noticed about the room (#701) was that it had an unusual layout being slightly long and narrow making it feel slightly smaller.  Some of the furniture appeared well worn and looked like it could use some refurbishment.  More importantly, the bed was well kept and comfortable.  Although the bathroom was large and had excellent toiletries, it's layout was even more quirky and there was no separate shower.  On the positive side, I enjoyed my stay, slept well every night and had no issues with comfort, cleanliness, and service at this hotel.

Pros: 
1. Great location near Hyde Park, Piccadilly Circus, Pall Mall and Buckingham Palace.
2. Large quiet rooms
3. Comfortable beds.
4. Excellent breakfast.
5. Consistent 5-star service.  
6. Variety of on-premise amenities.

Cons: 
My room had an unusual layout and did not have a separate shower.",4,2013,05,05
130,Slightly disappointing,"We'd enjoyed a stay last year so booked again for two nights to celebrate my 60th.  

Disappointingly we didn't get the park view we'd requested, even though the reservations staff knew this was a special occasion.  Worse still, our room on the north (and therefore dark) side of the building had been refurbished in a dingy grey-green colour with dark wood furniture and gloomy lighting.  I knew how much trouble and expense my husband had gone to so didn't kick up a fuss, but I certainly won't be asking for a repeat visit.

On the plus side, breakfast was superb and the bathroom fabulous.  Just a real shame the room was so depressing.",4,2013,05,04
130,Fantastic Experience,"Stayed for 3 nights last November and had a ""perfect"" stay.  What an amazing hotel and was worth the extra cost.  Everyone was super helpful and service was spot on at all times.  I was upgraded into a most amazing suite and treated like royalty.  Life does not get too much better I tell you.  Will visit again.",5,2013,05,03
130,Fantastic Hotel in perfect location,"We stayed 4 nights over an extended weekend and enjoyed everything this wonderful hotel has to offer. Exquisite dinner at China Tang, one of my best Chinese dinner ever. Afternoon tea in the Promenade accompanied with champagne is the perfect way to end a day of shopping. Breakfasts are great. Rooms in mint conditions with all you need. Beds an absolute dream to sleep in. Staff..perfect in every way. All in all, if you want to spend a few pounds extra on accommodations this is the place!",5,2013,04,24
130,Wonderful stay,"As a treat for an anniversary, we stopped here after dinner at Alain Ducasse (a must).  The staff were aware it was a treat and had treated us to some little extras in our room, which was very thoughtful.  Thank you!

The room itself was a Deluxe King (I think), which was delightful.  The bed was a dream to sleep on and you couldn't help but wake rested, ready to read the paper and head for breakfast.  I would love to go and have a bath and a sleep in that room every Friday after work.

The breakfast was great, delicious fruit salad, pastries and waffles in the Grill.  The service was always friendly and helpful.  A zero-fault stay.",5,2013,04,24
130,All as expected.,"Stayed for one night on a recent shopping trip. First time we have stayed here. From check in to check out everything ran perfectly, we stayed in a Superior King on the eighth floor overlooking Hyde Park. Great tasting breakfast in the Grill, possibly not £32 worth but everything else seemed quite reasonable, so happy to overlook that, cocktails in 'The Bar' were delicious, will certainly consider the Dorchester again",5,2013,04,23
130,bad experience,"I booked this hotel for a friend and myself to celebrate 20 years of friendship, we were only staying the night going to a show. when we arrived the doormen were very nice and put us at ease straight away , the person who took us to our room was very professional, we went to see our show as planned, on our return to the hotel being a saturday night it was extremely busy, we went to the bar to have a drink before going to our rooms , the barman was extremely rude to ,  we only wanted a diet coke and a water he looked me up and down and said in a very profesional manner there is a twenty pound minimum order unless of course you are staying here . i got my room key out at which point he got me my drink . i found this attitude unwaranted just because i was not dripping in diamonds he thought he could speak down to me. i have been offered a free stay at the hotel to make up for the experience , but have not and will not be takeing them up on the offer if i cant be treated correctly the first time im not going back for them to try again",2,2013,04,19
130,I hope to come and for the fourth time,"Should not talk too much when it comes to this hotel. 
Cleanliness is perfect, which is what attracted me to come for the third time. 
Breakfast is very nice as service, of course. 
Staff very professional and kind, also patient, witch is very important to me.",5,2013,04,18
130,The Dorchester - Simply the best hotel in London,"I had the pleasure to stay at the Dorchester Suite a few weeks ago with my partner. It was not my first time at the Dorchester and surely not the last time. Even though we live in London we find a night or two at the Dorchester and a visit to the Dorchester Spa always an incredibly relaxing experience. 

The hotel is very central located with lots of great restaurants just around the corner, not to forget the restaurants at the Dorchester Hotel. The staff is fantastic, the food delicious and the interior design a dream.",5,2013,04,18
130,"Good ambience, good service","I like the coziness of the hotel, and it's location. Not too crowded yet close enough to all the good restaurants. Enjoyed some people watching at the hotel lobby coffee house. 

Walking distance to the playboy casino which is a plus for a night out to relax. 

Hotel rate is a little pricey but it's for work and company is paying for. Otherwise",4,2013,04,17
130,Super suite!,We had the great pleasure of staying in the Harlequin suite at the hotel which had an amazing view over Hyde Park with a nice balcony to enjoy as well. The rooms were spacious and the staff extremely accommodating. The hotel of course is very central a stone's throw away from most London hot spots. We loved it and will definitely come back again!,5,2013,04,15
130,Exquisite,"My Sister-in-Law and I took Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester on the 6th April. We had booked 
' Vintage Afternoon Tea on the Balcony'. 

We were welcomed by the host and brought upstairs to the balcony. This was done with genuine warmth and enthusiasm and we felt instantly at ease. 

We were looked after by a lovely gentleman called Juan. He was charming, and extremely accomodating. A glass of Laurent Perrier is part of the treat, and my dining companion was delighted to enjoy this. However I am pregnant and on ascertaining this fact Juan immediately organised a delicious fruit cocktail. I was taken aback by this unrequested and thoughtful act.

We both found the sandwiches particularly delicious. The scones were warm and just baked and the delicious cakes moist and scrumptious! Juan presented us with a box containing our pastries as it would have been impossible to eat another thing. 

We had both looked forward immensely to our Afternoon Tea and I often find that I am disappointed by much anticipated dining experiences. On this occasion not only did my hopes meet the actuality they were truly surpassed. 

I recommend The Dorchester Afternoon Tea wholeheartedly. The staff are such an asset and are what made our visit so memorable.",5,2013,04,13
130,Step into the most glamorous chintz luxury bubble- with service that is best described as telepathic!,"You really do pay for what you get. I got the best hospitality service ever, I slept in the most comfortable bed ever, watched the best TV, the best (& obviously deepest) bath & the, drank the best drinks & ate the best food (oh Alain Ducasse- WOW!) But boy, did we empty our pockets- even if I was absolutely minted; this would be a rare treat. I will have very fond memories of my Dorchester experience though; very special!",5,2013,04,08
130,As good as expected,"Great place. The Manager took a real interest in our comfort. Staff in the gift shop, who used to be on switchboard was terrific. Mezzanine food was good for Beakfast and afternoon tea. The other reataurants are too pricey even for the Dorchester. Spent a week here and entertained some out of town guests. Wonderful Bathrooms. Rooms a little small but very nice.  It's a great place to stay.",4,2013,04,08
130,So special,"My husband and I were married at the Dorchester over the Easter weekend and we could not fault anything. The service was exactly as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre and the venue was absolutely beautiful. 

Sophie and Lee in the Events department were so brilliant, they made our event truly special and it wouldn't have been the same without their help.

All the small details were taken care of and we weren't allowed to worry about a thing, they made sure everything was perfect and we cant thank them enough. 

We looked at a number of hotels including the Savoy, Berkley, Connaught and Claridges before deciding to hold our wedding at the Dorchester because we wanted to celebrate in a venue which is truly iconic to London. We couldn't be happier with our decision and it is service like this that sets the Dorchester apart from other great hotels in its league.

We have decided that as long as we are living in the UK we will return to stay at the hotel on our anniversary weekend to celebrate where we spent our special day. 

Thank you so much for making it wonderful. x",5,2013,04,08
130,Beware of hidden charges,Yesterday went to one of their afternoon champagne teas with a group of us celebrating a 60th birthday . Tea was ok as well as service. However the extras were cunningly added on. We had glass of champagne and my daughter and friend wanted coffee they were encouraged to have another champagne which was implied that it was same price as coffee but it wasn't. The champagne was flowing freely implying we were finishing a bottle but every glass was a price. This was a rip off and the waiters knew how to do this and really they should have let us know that champagne was extra and not just replacement for coffee at same price. Anyone going here ask prices or better still maybe keep tab on your bill!!!!!',3,2013,04,07
130,"Mmhhh, too many little things were not right","I was looking forward to my stay at The Dorchester but was rather disappointed. The two main issues were:

1) they were renovating some of the corridors and for some obscure reason they decided it would be a good idea to place me and one of our business partners in that section: this meant that from 7am there was noise from the workmen re-doing the wallpaper. On my last morning it also seemed like they were renovating the bathroom in the room above mine as there was very lound ongoing noise of building work. Complaints to the hotel manager seems to have had little effect although at the end they did provide a discount. Surely for a hotel of their standing they should close the wings they are renovating and place customers in the quiet part: secret of a good hotel? A good night's sleep.

2) the service at breakfast was really very poor, especially on the 2nd day when the waiter kept forgetting most of the order, and then the easiest of the orders (a salmon bagel) took nearly 30' to arrive but then it was cold. Promptly we sent it back and asked to have a different waiter, the 2nd was much better but at some stage all appeared to have gone on a breack and there was no one around.

Also, the place is just incredibly busy that it's difficult to find it a relaxing place. The rooms on the whole were very good although the decor is a bit dated. Don't be misled by the video on the website, it's only the most exclusive suits which have yet had the refurbishment. Although the batrooms are very nice and spacious. The minibar was also well stocked although it's beyond me why they cannot provide a kettle and tea/coffee facilities.

We tried most of the restaurants in the hotel and the bar. The food is good without being spectacular (only the bill is), but the cocktails are excellent. I recommend trying the bar of China Tang which does superb Lychee Martinis.

Overall, if I have the choice I won't stay here again.",3,2013,04,05
130,In A Class of It's Own,"This is a follow up to an earlier review just to say I've not found better service or facilities anywhere else and will not stay in any other establishments if there is a Dorchester Collection hotel available.

Staying in other 5* hotels only goes to show how much better the Dorchester is in every way.",5,2013,04,03
130,A needed medicine left behind--problem solved by the professionals at the Dorchester.,"I had been very happy with my five or six prior stays at the Dorchester.  My single rooms have always been beautifully appointed, the business center is more than well equipped and the bar and breakfast areas are stunning. But the hotel staff was the star this month when I arrived in London without the one medicine I needed for a three week stay in Europe. After an unsuccessful consultation with a London pharmacy, I explained my problem to the Dorchester Concierge. Within the hour, the hotels' Doctor had scheduled a consultation. After he confirmed my medical problem, he prescribed the medication I had left across the pond and ordered it delivered to the hotel before the afternoon was over. And the cost was less than a visit to a Florida ""Doc in a Box"".  My trip went on, thanks to the Dorchester staff.",5,2013,03,29
130,The Chaine Young Professionals Awards Dinner,"This iconic London establishment is truely one of the great hotels of the World. You get what you pay for was never more true - and at The Dorchester, it's done with style. The attention to detail is quite outstanding and quality is unquestionable.

We had an amazing weekend - the highlight being an awards dinner - where the food on service were quite exceptional.

The rooms too are beautifully appointed - we had a recently refurbished room and were very impressed even though there was no view.

A word of warning - take care in the bar - ones bar tab can soon mount up without much effort.",5,2013,03,25
130,"Wonderfully luxurious, yet friendly","Maybe it's just me, but, some of the worlds great hotels seem to have a certain air about them, sort of ""are you sure you should be here""?

Well that's not The Dorchester. 

It's every bit as grand and luxurious as you imagine / expect, yet from the chauffeurs to pick you up, the doormen, concierge, reception staff (offering to escort to the room) through all other staff I saw in my 24 hour stay, everybody genuinely seemed happy to be working there and for you to be their guest. 

Every company is only as good as its employees and this is one great hotel. 

Great Dorchester English breakfast in The Grill also....",5,2013,03,24
130,A totally magnificent experience!,"This hotel is superb! The service is outstanding and the whole package from room service breakfast  to cocktails in the excellent bar, with celebrities, is just magnificent! 
I would recommend this to everyone for at least a once in a lifetime experience.
I can't wait to return again. Both my wife and I loved every second!",5,2013,03,23
130,Red Carpet Treatment,"My last hotel review was of a Super 8 Motel in North Carolina, so take this review as you see fit.  The Dorchester is at the opposite end of the spectrum -- from redneck to red carpet.  We stayed there for one night in late November 2012, and it was fantastic.  We were given a small suite, I think.  It was a large room with a sitting area, and a bathroom to die for, all marble, glass and chrome. See photos.

A welcome plate of fruit was delivered to us shortly after we got to our room.  The windows opened a bit, which was nice for some fresh air, if not necessarily energy efficient, as the weather was cold, gloomy and damp.

We spent little time exploring the hotel.  Yet the brief experience I had there was divine.  We had dinner at the hotel, a large group event in one of the meeting rooms, cocktails first, then food.  It was good and fun and festive, but not especially memorable.

Two comments: a lamp beside the bed was short-circuiting each time I turned it on.  We called the front desk and an electrician arrived shortly afterwards.  He changed the light bulb and thought that had taken care of the problem, but as he turned and walked away, it went out again.  So he immediately unplugged the lamp, took it with him,and brought us another one right away.  No real problem for us, just a glitch, maybe no one had turned on that lamp recently.  We had great service throughout our stay.

Secondly, my husband stayed at The Dorchester, again for one night, in mid-December 2012. I'd gone home to the US, he was at the end of a multi-continent tour.  He said that his room on the return leg was nothing like our luxurious digs three weeks earlier, just a small  space without many special touches.  So the moral is that not all first experiences repeat themselves.

Still, I'd go for it -- live in the lap of luxury.

And as a P.S., after checking in early in the day, we went to explore and found The Athenaeum Hotel nearby, which serves a delicious -- and deliciously expensive -- cream tea.  Pure pampering.  Put that on your to-do list, also.",5,2013,03,20
130,Couldn't ask for more - superb,"Booked the Dorchester for a special weekend break as a christmas gift for my wife. To be fair, we don't normally stay at such lavish hotels but this was a special occasion. 

It's hard to explain why its so special, it just is. The staff are so attentive, but not over the top. The hotel interior is amazing and our room was beyond comfortable. 

Breakfast on the Promenade was out of this world.

Yep, it's eye wateringly expensive, but as a special treat its well worth every penny.",5,2013,03,17
130,Awesome.  One of the nicest hotels in London.,"If you can afford it, this is the place to be.  Great location, glitzy neighborhood.  The staff is the best I've ever seen.  Hotel of stars and famous statesmen.  It is an easy walk to three tube stops, shopping, and great food.  And one of the best parks in the city, Hyde Park, is right across the street.  I could not recommend this more. ",5,2013,03,15
130,Just too amazing for words,"Took my husband to this hotel for his 60th birthday. it was amazing from the moment we stepped up to the reception desk. We were received like celebrities and given room upgrades without even asking. Everything was incredible. We had a birthday cake and huge bowl of fruit plus champagne in the room. They even gave my husband a birthday card. Attention to detail was outstanding. Bars, restaurants and staff were all the best ever. we have stayed in top class hotels all over the world but the Dorchester is our number I. Can't wait to go back, but this time it will be for two nights! Many thanks to a truly great team x",5,2013,03,15
130,Daughters 21st Birthday stay.,"We came to the Dorchester for our daughters 21st Birthday celebration, 6 People and 23 month old, we have stayed at the Dorchester several times and always been very happy, on this particular stay as always the staff and service from all areas of the hotel was fantastic, we had 3 rooms all excellent, a very nice cot for the little fellor and a high chair fully available whenever required, our daughters had some treatments in the spa which they enjoyed very much, we had afternoon tea in the promanade and also an evening meal later, the staff catered for all our requirements on this special trip and made the experience exceptional, we had room service which was prompt, The hotel and rooms are of excellent standard, lovely flowers throughout, we had some special requests to celebrate our daughters birthday with particular thanks to Petronella and Emily for attending to our requirements, they made the weekend extremely welcoming and special, the entire experience was brilliant, all staff friendly and helpfull, they could not have done any more to make our daughters and grandson more welcome, check in and out was prompt thanks to Emma on reception, what more can i say, just how service from a quality hotel should be, professional, caring, attentive just Brilliant.",5,2013,03,14
130,superb,"We have not tried the dorchester rooms (YET) but we visited for a meal which i could only say was superb.Staff provide a warm and friendly service although i have to agree with a few comments down some spoke very little english which was slightly hard to speak in general terms ( had to break it down a little) But we wasn't to bothered about this.More importantly the food was a delight ,food cooked to highest quality of foods.
For a treat i would suggest you visit",4,2013,03,14
130,Wonderful Birthday,"I came here for my Mum's 50th and had afternoon tea in the Promenade. I have never been to this Hotel but I can definitely say I would come again! We were greeted by the staff who were very friendly and helpful. Our Waiters were lovely and the overall experience was fantastic!
Due to it being my Mum's Birthday, they brought out a cake for her and the pianist played the Birthday song. Was a fab day and my Mum thoroughly enjoyed herself!",5,2013,03,13
130,"Grand, but in need of some re-trimming.","Never having needed hotels in the great city of London, the Dorchester has long been my ideal grand hotel. A opportunity to sample the inner functions of this renowned institution left me with most of my expectations fulfilled, but also left me with some disappointments as well. Grand public areas and a selection of jolly good eateries are present. The waiters were helpful, if too attentive rather than obsequiously discreet -the latter being preferable, and the room service was efficient, but struggled with English (all-too-predictable in modern London). The room was large and comfortable, but some of the wood and fabric decor had seen better days and the Axminster-esque carpets in the corridors needed renewing. No apparent dress code was enforced downstairs, disappointingly, and some of the foreign clientele enjoyed temporary companions rather too publicly for civilised standards. Anyone expecting a modern-day Earl of Grantham to maintain standards would be disappointed. The Ritz, it seems, keeps civilised sartorial and behavioural formalities better enforced.",4,2013,03,09
130,Excellent - Service is outstanding,"We booked dinner, bed and breakfast for 1 night as a Christmas present. We have always been put off a little by the exterior of the hotel with its Ferraris, Rolls Royce’s etc parked outside as we always felt we would not fit in, how wrong we were. The hotel is excellent and the service is exceptional. We checked in and where taken to our rooms by a lovely young lady who explained that they had put us in a newly refurbished room and she checked if we needed anything else. The rooms was stunning, marble bathroom and a massive queen size bed, the decor id beautiful and topped off with a Bang & Olufsen on the wall. A man turned up 10 minutes later with some water and a fruit platter. We had booked into The Grill restaurant which was very nice, if not a little expensive. The breakfast was good, no requests seemed to challenge the waiter and that’s what you pay for, it's not the stuff you see it's the stuff that don't see behind the scenes. During our stay we were treated like all the other guests and didn't feel inferior in any way. The only little minus point was the view from the room, it was not great but as it was only for 1 night we put up with it. Checkout was smooth and efficient and we came away with a big smile on our faces. Yes it's not cheap, but I would certainly find a bit extra cash to stay with them again.",5,2013,03,08
130,Incorrect billing left a bitter aftertaste,"Lovely surroundings, with good sandwiches, but the afternoon was spoilt by being overcharged by £37 each! No acknowledgement or apology, which left a surprisingly poor aftertaste. This is the first time this has happened to us. Therefore, by all means go, but do state clearly how you would like your card to be charged prior to handing it over.",3,2013,03,08
130,Great,"The service was excellent as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The prices are not cheap, but its worth it once in a while!  We had afternoon tea after a long day of sight seeing and it was worth it!  My wife especially enjoyed the experience!",5,2013,03,06
130,Girly Weekend,My friend and I had a girly wend and she booked the Dorchester as a suprise it was fantastic room tip top service excellent food exquisit what more can you ask for. I would return i felt so at home fabrics decor opulant x,5,2013,03,04
130,The Finest Hotel I Ever Stayed In,"I stayed in the Dorchester quite some time ago now, but the experience still lives with me a couple of years on. I became engaged to my wife here, and staff went out of their way to accommodate my plans. I am not the kind of visitor who can usually afford to stay in such luxury, and even a single night's stay in the cheapest possible room required some significant saving on my part, but at no time was I made to feel unwelcome or that the hotel was ""beyond me"". On the contrary, everything about my experience was as good as it possibly could have been.

The suite we were in was exceptional - immaculately clean, tastefully furnished and of outstanding quality, finished off with unbeatable views over Hyde Park. There was even a bottle of Champagne on ice waiting for us in the room, compliments of the manager. This touch was the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me - especially in a hotel. The bath in the room was deep and spacious, and the bed was plump and relaxing - I just didn't want to go to sleep!

The Dorchester Grill is equally amazing. Again, it was the most expensive meal I have ever eaten, costing something in the region of £150 for three courses with wine (and several different ones at that) for two. This may be a standard spend for some people at this hotel, but for me, it was unique - and a memorable treat at that. I was greeted at my table by the head waiter by name, and made to feel like a welcome house guest. The wine list was well-chosen and of an excellent variety. The food was simply outstanding, and two years later I can still taste the steak and chips I had. They are yet to be beaten.

The following morning's breakfast was served in our room - again, making us feel extra special. It was the most memorable breakfast I've ever had, and not just because I'd got engaged the night before. The selection catered to a variety of world tastes, but even my (now) wife's choice of ""Coco Pops"" was taken care of - ""Sir, they are one of our most popular choices,"" I was told in all sincerity by the catering team. Almost needless to say, the cooked offerings were of the highest order. It was like something out of a Bond movie, having Champagne at breakfast in a luxury hotel.

Two years on and I'm still raving about that one night I spent at the Dorchester. I heartily recommend it to all of my friends and family, even though I've never been able to afford to go back. If you have a special occasion, or just want to experience the best that the hotel industry can offer, then you owe it to yourself to try the Dorchester. One night here is worth a fortnight anywhere else. Simply exceptional.",5,2013,03,03
130,what a wonderful place,"My husband and I went to London for a business weekend. The business meeting and the luncheon that followed were at the Dorchester Hotel.
I cannot find one negative thing to say. It was fantastic from start to finish.
The food was superb, I complimented the service from the waiting staff on many occations as being outstanding.
This hotel is perfect as a business venue or as an individual or family taking in the sights of London. The hotel cannot do enough to help you.
The decor is stunning.
What more can I say. The whole experience was wonderful and we will certainly be returning.
Thank you the staff of the Dorcester for making our stay so memorable",5,2013,03,02
130,The Dorchester is still the best hotel in London,"The Dorchester is always my hotel of choice in London, the rooms are extremely comfortable and the service is reliable. I recently visited the Dorchester as I have done regularly over the last 15 years or so. However since then I have received a personal message direct to my tripadvisor identity. The message complemented me on the standard of the writing of my tripadvisor reviews and stated that I had been selected to write reviews for an exclusive internet site. However they required my personal email address so that they could send the login details of their site to me. I pointed out that revealing my personal email address to someone who I did not know would be foolhardy so they then suggested that I contact them via their email address for this purpose, (therefore there not being any improvement in my security). My people set up a ghost email address and out of curiosity I sent an email very politely offering to be involved. I have not received a reply several weeks later despite their initial reply by trip advisor messaging being immediate. 

Some people have suggested to me that this may allegedly be a cause for concern. The person or persons concerned selected a regular guest at the Dorchester, a hotel that is well known as the London home of some of the most wealthy, powerful, distinguished, well connected and famous people visiting London. I am writing this to inform other members of the Tripadvisor community, also those who stay at the Dorchester who don't contribute but who may read the reviews and for the information of the management of the hotel. I also hope that Tripadvisor themselves will pick up on this. In these times we all have to be ever mindful of security. The tripadvisor address the message was sent from was sarahstephens84, this member has no contributions or other entries on Tripadvisor which some people have suggested to me may allegedly indicate that they have joined in order to obtain access to members. If you receive a similar message and if you feel inclined to do so,  please let me know.",5,2013,02,25
130,Wow! fantastic hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a trip to London to celebrate her 50th birthday. We booked the Dorchester for lunch at the Grill and an overnight stay in an accessible deluxe king room. Everything about the stay was fantastic, the ambience of the hotel and room and the very attentive and impressive service from all the staff we came into contact with. It was a very special weekend and we are both very grateful to the Dorchester for helping to make it so great. Little touches such as the birthday cake in the room were really appreciated but the service throughout was exemplary, especially our  lunch and breakfast experience in the Grill. The Aberdeen Angus was just great and worth the supplement on the Menu of the Day. We will definetly return for another special celebration and next time try the Afternoon Tea in the Promenade which is a fabulous room.",5,2013,02,24
130,Afternoon Tea for Two,"I took my Mum for a surprise trip to The Dorchester for Afternoon Tea as a special surprise treat for her after a difficult few months dealing with the death of her own Mum. 

We got the hotel having walked from Hyde Park Corner and there was no doorman present, they were all be the far corner talking to some taxi drivers so we let ourselves in the hotel but we were not greeted to and I had to ask one of the staff members standing around the foyer where we should go. He suggested we might like to freshen up first and indicated the way to the toilets and cloakroom. When ready we went to the lady who was dealing with seating guests for Afternoon Tea who was very friendly and showed us straight to our seats. We were left for a bit with the tea menus before our waistcoat and tails bedecked waiter arrived to take our orders. 

I am not a tea drinker and so ordered orange juice which was 100% fresh and delicious whilst my Mum ordered decaf tea. He brought the drinks and the tea I could see was very pale and throughout the experience it did not seem to develop any better. The waiter poured the tea once and then my Mum was left to top up herself for the rest of the afternoon. She only really drank a few cups out of duty as I was paying for the treat rather than because she was enjoying it.

The sandwiches were served and we had a choice of salmon, tuna, cucumber with cream cheese and chicken. My favourites were the tuna and the chicken sandwiches which were served in a greenish basil bread which did look unusual but tasted nice. We polished of two rounds (6 finger sandwiches each) and a chocolate cup with (lightly) coffee flavoured mousse before moving on to scones.

The scones are miniature rather than full size and there were plain ones and fruit ones served with pots of clotted cream, compote and strawberry jam which you can help yourself to. The scones were served warm and were very nice. We would have had seconds but three scones each had left us feeling a bit full!

Next came the cakes, however I must say these were very disappointing. There was a tasteless yellow concoction which was apparently a lychee mousse atop a biscuit, a tasteless green macaroon, a small pear tart thing, a pastry case with fresh fruit and meringue and also a peanut butter mousse on top a biscuit base. We tried each of these cakes and none of them had much flavour at all and so we did not have seconds.

As we had booked for the second to last sitting we were pretty much able to stay as long as we wanted until we asked for the bill. The gentleman who brought it asked if we had enjoyed the tea so we said we had but that the cakes had been a disappointment. He promptly suggested that he could give us some alternative ones in our box to take away to try and see if we liked better for next time. When we opened our box later on at our hotel, the only cakes in there were the same tasteless ones we hadn't liked originally.

Overall our experience at The Dorchester did not fully live up to our expectations. We enjoyed the atmosphere and people watching, with the scones and sandwiches being delicious and the staff being eager to please but the actual tea itself and the cakes were very disappointing. I think the next time we try to go to afternoon tea we would try somewhere else to see if we can find find the whole package as, for us, The Dorchester did not have it.",3,2013,02,24

130,Should have written this sooner......,"We actually took this trip in Dec 2011 for our annual Xmas trip to shop and visit friends..It was a bit last minute s i didnt have time to book one f the regular hotels we usually stay at but a friend recommended the Dorchester and i am glad i took his advice ... I originally booked a deluxe room which was nice and spacious but had a view of the roof so not so appealing but the room itself was great.
 After meeting my dear friend HH Prince Mansoor he called the hotel mgmt and in moments i had a call from the duty mgr Cindy and we were whisked away to a one bedroom suite.... great reaction time..and great room...i tend to like a bit more room to move around in when staying at any hotel..lol.
 As i said the hotel itself is fantastic...they can pull off ""old world charm"" like no one else in the world... and everyone from the door staff to the mgmt strives to do their very best to make sure all of your needs are addressed.
 The lobby is a ""great"" place to people watch and they serve the best Club sandwich in london... China Tang was soo good that we ate dinner there almost every night...Spa apparently was great since i lost my spouse to them everyday for about 2-3 hrs..lol
 Have not had the oppurtunity to visit again as a guest but will definately in the near furture.. Hotel and Staff are top notch...",5,2013,02,10
130,Lovely,"I stayed here for the night with my nan's for her 75th birthday and I was not disappointed. They My nan who is not easily please also had a wonderful stay asthey really did make it special for her. leaving a birthday cake and champange in the room when we checked in.. 

Of course it is expensive but I think worth every penny. 

The bed was so comfortable I think I would have have paid for that alone. 

The staff was lovely and helpful.

Will be staying there again.",5,2013,02,04
130,Very disappointing,"When my husband and I stayed at The Dorchester we were very disappointed. We have stayed in many hotels in London and thought staying here would mean no problems, good service and everything as it should be - but it was not. When we first arrived the doorman and the lady at reception were very welcoming but during our stay we found some staff, especially in the breakfast and dining room were just indifferent. Our superier king room was large, chintzy and a little old fashioned and we have certainly been in better. What did surprise us was the lack of tea making facilities. I would have thought, especially to 'The English' that would be important! Almost all hotels in UK have such a facility even though in other parts of Europe they do not. We did eventually have a tea tray well over two hours later but with only a huge (not very clean) kettle on it as if it had been taken from the staff room, two lovely tiny china teacups and nothing else! Only to find the whole thing was taken away by the turn down service while we were at dinner. No morning cuppa then! I realise there is room service but there is no point in ringing for them as by the time the tea arrives at the door it would be cold or stewed. Throughout our stay little things kept going wrong which on there own would not have been a problem but all together annoyed us. I think the hotel was too large for us as on our arrival the reception area was chaos, filled with people as there seemed to be several events going on as well as the whole of London drifting in and out or having afternoon tea. Our dining experience in The Grill which was a very cold room both for dinner and breakfast was very disappointing and breakfast was ordinary.
That visit will be our one and only stay at this hotel. Having said all that I emailed the hotel after our stay and asked for the managers personal email address which was sent to me immediately. I then emailed my complaints and concerns about our stay at The Dorchester and had a response almost by return email from John Scanlon who responed well to my critisims. I have to give them ten out of ten for that.",3,2013,01,31
130,Don't think twice!,"We live abroad now thanks to work commitments so travel regularly to London where our daughters live and work. We have stayed in many of the top London hotels just to 'tick a few boxes' and check out the competition
Suffice to say we always return to The Dorchester.....the entire experience is wonderful
It's difficult to fault the hotel.....you can usually find a small item of dissatisfaction but not here!
We will return again in a couple of months.....without hesitation!
Thanks to the staff and management who are spindly becoming friends
Don't think twice, just book it!",5,2013,01,30
130,Exceptional hotel,"This hotel is what every luxury hotel should be.  My husband, adult daughter and I stayed at the Dorchester after Christmas through New Years day. Our visit exceeded our expectations.  The staff is exceptional. Not only are they knowledgeable and attentive, they are absolutely charming and engaged.  Rooms are elegant, comfortable and well appointed.  We tried several restaurants and each, though different, was a perfect dining experience.  Dinner  New Year's Eve at the Grill will be a family memory, treasured forever.  I want to go back!!!. Soon.!!!",5,2013,01,30
130,Loved It,"“From the minute our car pulled up to the entrance, I knew this would a special stay. The doormen and reception were super kind and welcoming. Walking into the lobby I was overwhelmed by the enormous flower arrangements, which were too stunning for words. We settled into our suite, enjoying the views of Hyde Park and grapes from a lovely fruit basket. (Room tip: Request a newly renovated Park Suite for your stay, if budget allows.) Later we got massages to ward off the jet lag; the spa is incredible, so beautiful and serene (Ladies – the nail station is the prettiest little jewel of a salon, worth a visit). We ate dinner at The Grill one night, which was just delicious, and I very much enjoyed the bar downstairs at China Tang for cocktail hour. Be sure to consult with George the concierge to set up reservations around the city, we found him incredibly helpful. Our few days at The Dorchester were such a treat!”",5,2013,01,29
130,Not quite as good as l had hoped,"I booked the Dorchester for the night as a special treat for my birthday. I had booked the Superior King Room at the special festive rate which was approx. 50% discount off normal rate. On arrival my room wasn't quite ready so they asked me to wait and have a tea or coffee whilst waiting, after about 15 minutes the Head of the Promenade Room asked if l was waiting for anything, he was fantastic, Pierre was his name, told him l was waiting for coffee (obviously the guy l checked in with had not ordered this) and he very kindly gave me lots of information about the hotel which was great. After coffee my room was ready. I asked for a room on a low floor as l don't do lifts, which was arranged. On entering the room l was pleasantly surprised how lovely the room was, but felt pleased that l had received a 50% discount as l would not have paid full rate for such a room, the window overlooked other rooms and a fire escape so nothing pleasant to look out too. On returning to the hotel later in the evening, l wanted to charge my mobile, hunted high and low for a power point and found one by the window.... couldn't find anymore though, just glad l didn't want to dry my hair at the same time! The bed had been turned down and two pairs of comfy slippers were supplied. I decided to put on the tv.... it was very grainy picture on most channels but ok if you wanted BBC1! thought about buying the movie skyfall at £15 but decided against this with the picture so grainy. It was time for bed.....and after about an hour wished l could have got in my car and gone home.... is was the worst bed and pillows l have ever laid on.... it was like laying on a bed of marshmallows... it was the softest bed you could imagine, the pillows were even worse... l can honestly say it was the worst night sleep l had ever had. Usually on my birthday l stay in nice hotels in London, last year l stayed at the Savoy and the year before the Lanesborough......  l have to say the previous hotels were much better sleep wise, customer service wise infact everything. The whole point of booking of this calibre for a special treat is because of the treatment and facilities they provide. The previous two hotels because it was a birthday not only upgraded me but also gave a birthday cake because it was a special occasion... the Dorchester supplied nothing..... to which l have to say was surprised. Even breakfast the following morning... it was ok but have had better served up at other hotels. Such a shame..... but next year l will be going back to the Savoy or Lanesborough, l won't be hurrying back to the Dorchester",3,2013,01,28
130,"Excellent, excellent, excellent","Beautiful Grand Dame of London.  This hotel is well situated to London attractions but once you're in the hotel, you never want to leave.  Restaurants are excellent, service is great and the hotel is very comfortable.  Don't forget to check out the spa--fantastic!  We will be returning soon.",5,2013,01,23
130,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"This is a great hotel in every respect. The common areas are gorgeous as are the rooms. I'm very particular and critical and I can't say a bad word. 
This is one of the greatest hotels in the world.
The service is exemplary and what makes it so special is that, unlike some of its competitors, there is no ""attitude"" or condescension--the staff are genuinely caring. For instance, if you want a cup of coffee/ tea in the promenade bar, there is no dress code; instead be comfortable. I really appreciate this--who wants to dress up to relax?
Ate at the Grill room twice and was exceptional both times.Both times we  shared a dinner and ""no problem"".
Also had dinner at the Promenade Bar on 2 occasions and it too was perfect.
Magnificent sheets,pillows, towels. It was so comfortable, we didn't get out of bed til 11am.
 What a pleasure to stay here--I've never been to hotel that is better.",5,2013,01,20
130,If only there were 6 stars,"Attended a conference in London and took the opportunity to stay at the Dorchester. From the professional and equally friendly greeting by the door team, this experience continued throughout our stay. The room exceeded expectations and the icing on the cake was a 'Dorchester' bookmark placed in my bedside book by the turn down team.
After taking the opportunity to see a musical, we returned to have roomservice and regardless that it was mid night, the service and quality was superb.
My final comment is that I've never stayed in a hotel with such soft and comfortable pillows. Your head 'melts' into them and anybody thinking of treating themselves to a stay, I would personally highly recommend this hotel",5,2013,01,18
130,2nd time and going back 5 star without the ponce,"This was our second time at the Dorchester, what makes it ? The staff. Special mention to the piano bar staff in particular Stacey the sax player and double bass guy who remembered my wife from our last time and played some lovely take that tunes in fantastic venue. We have booked again for 15th feb but have had to cancel due to business but we will certainly be back this year. I would advise a exec room as over looks Hyde park. 

Thanks for great time 

Special mention to piano bar and avi the manager who has been uber helpful even after a few bottles of Dom perigon.",5,2013,01,18
130,amazing everyone should try it,"We were on holiday from Tasmania and I had always wanted to go there and have high tea in the Promanade, as my mother went there when she was at school, and had often spoken of it. Well we went and what a treat, the high tea is on another level completely from other places. Loved it and next time we will also stay at the hotel. Thankyou for a memorable evening.",5,2013,01,18
130,A Fabulous Experience,"Part of my Christmas present from my Sons this year included lunch at The Dorchester.  What a superb idea!  The whole experience was exquisite. Pre-lunch drinks in the bar from their award winning cocktail maker were delicious.  The overall service was perfect from attentive and interested staff.  Lunch was extraordinarily superb.  Colours, textures and taste jumping off our plates throughout the meal.  A wonderful restaurant and I can highly recommend it.",5,2013,01,15
130,one of the best,"This hotel is definitely one of the best in London, location opposite the park is very nice, some very important people in and around the hotel. Breakfast should have more choice, but good. Room was good, but a bit more 'traditional' then that of the Savoy. I don't think there is a swimming pool here? Christmas tree was up and looked very festive and the lobby had a nice atmosphere.",4,2013,01,14
130,Traditional England at its finest,"This is the best hotel that we have ever stayed in London.  It really does not get any better than this here, so if you ever get the opportunity to stay I really could not recommend it highly enough.  It was a surprise weekend for Christmas off my husband who knew I had always wanted to stay here and it really exceeded all my expectations, fabulous attentive staff, gorgeous food from breakfast to afternoon tea and lunch in China Tang.
It really is a truly exceptional hotel to stay and I would love to return soon.",5,2013,01,13
130,The Dorchester - a little slice of heaven!,"I have just returned home from a truly memorable weekend at The Dorchester to celebrate my daughter’s 18th birthday and it was probably one of the most enjoyable few days I have ever experienced. Everything from our early arrival on Friday to collecting our bags from the Concierge after a final trip to the shops on Sunday was effortless and gracefully managed. There are far too many high points to list all of them but if we were to select just a few, the supremely delicious birthday cake that magically appeared in our room while we were out, the indescribable luxuriousness of the beds, whose comfort levels have to be experienced to be truly believed, the wonderful Promenade, where we enjoyed Afternoon Tea on Friday and some great music late Saturday evening, and the friendliness and warmth of all the staff, particularly the housekeeping staff who were unfailingly polite with a ready smile and friendly greeting. We would also like to say a special word to the young man who served us breakfast. Sadly we do not know his name but we do know he comes from Switzerland and The Dorchester is very lucky to have him! We have experienced a small slice of heaven and will definitely be returning for more!",5,2013,01,06
130,Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester,"What a lovely treat, gorgeous sandwiches with the crusts off of course!! Glass of pink fizz  plenty of choices of teas to choose. Then scones cream and jam followed by pastries. Staff very friendly, and no end to how much you could eat, it just kept coming.....a bit pricey approx 50.00 per head, champagne was 20 pounds per glass. I have to say its not quite as good as the Ritz for tea, but definitely just as decadent!!!!",4,2013,01,06
130,The Dorchester,"Classic English style, this hotel which has a reputation for service does not disappoint. The restaurant and bar areas will accommodate most requests. Located opposite  Hyde park, the  hotel has a beautiful outlook and provides an unbelievable experience for those who love beautiful scenery and the option of healthy activities.",5,2013,01,05
130,Tea at The Dorchester,"Our daughter treated my husband and I to tea the Friday before Christmas. What a wonderful treat. Everything was exceptional; service, sandwiches, cream scones, pastries, champagne and the selection of teas. The ambiance created by twinkling christmas tree lights and the pianist reeling out old and new christmas tunes  was lovely. Thank you for a very special evening to the Dorchester staff.",5,2013,01,05
130,Beautiful Hotel ~ Good location,"I was interested in staying at The Dorchester because I wanted an English experience in a hotel that had history and character.  This hotel definitely has all of that.  Door Staff were excellent and helpful, Concierge Staff helped with restaurant reservations although I do think this particular staff, at any hotel, get a litttle burned out with countless reservations and directions and tend to just do the easy quick thing, without really finding out what the guest might be looking for in a dining experience, or the directions given are a little too vague.  Front desk staff were welcoming.  That said, the hotel exuded charm and elegance, the corridors were brightly decorated and looked like jewel boxes.  Our room was a middle priced option (King with a view of Hyde Park).  Everything was superb about the room, ample closets, beautiful bathroom, handy reading lights with switches by the bed, excellent linens and comfortable bed.  THe only draw back was that right outside this room were 2 large spot lights that I assume light up the hotel and add to the exterior presentation...these however shine right in the windows all night.  The room darkening curtains help, but when you are trying to adjust to a major time zone change I find it helpful to have the curtains open so you can begin to wake up with the morning light.  THis was not possible. (RM 215). We had tea in ""the Lobby"" flanked by huge pillars and comfortable couches and chairs.  Excellent.  This area seemed quite busy most of the time with many groups settling there for the day.This hotel seems very popular with Middle Eastern guests and the menus throughout the hotel offer many interesting options.  Great place  to stay, easy walk to Harrods and other shopping as well as neighborhood shops and quiet (very good)restaurants.",4,2013,01,03
130,Could be better,"Everyone thinks ""on my.......The Dorchester"" when really it's nothing more than a very nice place to go.
My friend and I had dinner in The Grill which was rather fancy but not exceptional.
The one thing which really let it down was the very long wait for the bill which i could have done without considering i had a train to catch and then had to rush.
All in all a nice experience but will look for better next time.",3,2013,01,03
130,Dissapointing,"Well, when I check in at famous hotels I expect nothing but highest quality. The Dorchester disapppointed me. Maybe I was just unlucky, as other reviews are extatic. Let's start with the beginning. I stayed in a deluxe room, which was spacious and nicely decorated. The view was to a nearby building but I didn't care. The bathroom was lovely, with great toiletries from Aromatherapy Associates. Soon after checking in, I wanted to have a shower when...guess what? A hotel male employee entered in my room carrying a luggage - of course he didn't knock on the door... Oh, I forgot to mention that I am a woman and lucklily, I was still dressed. Following the hotel employee was a hotel guest, who was assigned the wrong room...my room! Ten minutes after, I got a phone call from the Reception: ""Hello, are you Mrs.X?"" ""Yes. What happened?"" ""Nothing, just checking."" No excuse was offered for employee's mistake! My colleagues who stayed in the same room category had fruit baskets in their rooms...not me. The breakfast was dissapointing: no buffet just a fixed menu - pastries, fruit salad, eggs (omlette). The waiter forgot to bring the bread at the table, the eggs were cold and only one pastry basket was served for two people. I also had lunches at the hotel, the food was good but not exceptional. Overall it was OK but I expect more from The Dorchester. I got better services in other London hotels so I will certainly stay somewhere else.",3,2013,01,02
130,every year,"We stay every New Years Eve have done for probably 7 of the last 8 anyway.
Lovely relaxed hotel, reasonable rates too, just book it early and you can have a superior king at £265 plus the VAT for NYE, not bad when you consider people trying to get on later are quoted double.
So the room was nice as usual, the buzz was good around the hotel and Park Lane and its hotels is as good a place as any this time of year.
Had a chinese in China Tang which was dire, but doesnt effect the hotel experience.
One thing is that its ever so dry in the hotel when you wake up you need fresh air.
Not a dealbreaker though.
Our favourite in London.
Quality.",5,2013,01,01
130,Business Dinner!!,"Recently attended the Passenger Shipping Association annual dinner at The Dorchester. From arrival with the top hatted doormen, to the bar staff and waiters I was thoroughly impressed by the staff and the venue as a whole. As a frequent traveller and a lover of food and wine everything was exceptional without exception.",5,2012,12,31
130,The best Hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed at the Dorchester on Saturday, 22 December 2012 for the first time. We have in the past stayed at many hotels in London from the Savoy (our favourite prior to refurbishment), Claridges through the many Hiltons to some quite ordinary ones.

I have to say that based on our experience, the Dorchester was quite exceptional. From arrival, through check-in to our first drink in the bar, we found the staff to be totally focused on our well-being.

Our room was big and comfortable, spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated.

Breakfast the following day was a pleasure.

My only regret was that we did not dine at the Dorchester but rather made the mistake of eating at Langan's Brasserie off Piccadilly!",5,2012,12,30
130,Christmas Treat,"This was our 2nd stay at the Dorchester mainly to visit and have some fun at the Winter Wonderland accross the road in Hyde Park.  From our arrival to departure, the service was outstanding with no attention to detail missed.  The atmosphere screamed ""CHRISTMAS LUXURY"" I would also like to say a huge thank you to Juan in the Promenade and Mr Scanlon for making this stay truly memorable.",5,2012,12,29
130,Better and better!,"I have stayed at The Dorchester two more times this fall and both times I was upgraded to newly redecorated rooms. Redecorating an icon like The Dorchester isn't easy: it has a distinct look (sumptuous glamor one might say) and I suspect its repeat guests get very attached to rooms being just as they remember them. That said, the new decors, while less 'English country house,' are splendid: handsome, harmonious and expensive-looking, just what you'd expect in this paragon of luxury hostelry. The beds, pillows and sheets are still divinely comfortable. And of course the staff remains the same: ever eager to be helpful and a delight to deal with. My last stay was early in December and The Promenade featured the biggest gingerbread house I had ever seen, a superb recreation of the front facade of the hotel. Bravo to the manager for commissioning this piece!",5,2012,12,27
130,Welcome to London,"Relocating back to Europe from SE Asia, having my first night back home in a ""proper"" hotel seemed a good idea.

I'd just spent the previous ten days at The Peninsula in Bangkok, but even their attention to detail and service paled in comparison to the Dorchester experience.

I won't bang on with hyperbole over the service, food, facilities and so on. The bottom line is they provided a warm welcome in London where you are made to feel at home - which after all is what hospitality is all about.

Perfect.",5,2012,12,24
130,Surly unfriendly bar staff,"Went to the Dorchester last night for a drink in the bar which is straight ahead of you as you walk in the front entrance. I was really disappointed to find the bar staff to be surly, unfriendly and didn't once raise a smile. We were not offered a drinks menu, we had to ask for it and it was practically thrown at me. My partner order me a Spicy Margarita and the barman did not ask what my partner wanted just assumed he was having the same. Which he was not. I do not understand why they had to be so unfriendly especially as the price we paid for 2 drinks with £40!!! I was however impressed with the pianist and his band members as they were ever so friendly and even played a song dedicated to me, which was really sweet. Shame the bar staff were not the same.  So we then headed off the The Grosvenor Hotel which was a welcome change as we were immediately welcomed by there staff and made to feel wanted.",2,2012,12,23
130,Can't beat it ..............,"A great place to stay while in London.  Conveniently located and top notch in every way.  The room I had was extraordinary for its size and attention to detail, as each is valuable in London. I'm from Texas, so I love my Dunkin Donuts coffee, but I can always dilute the coffee served in most English places.  ;-)  Highly recommend the Dorchester while in London.",5,2012,12,23
130,The Dorchester experience,"The nice thing about this hotel is the team that work here...all are helpful and smiling, and young and enthusiastic. This is great, a lot less stuffy and formal than I expected, pretty much all the time. Food is great, breakfast very good, a little quiet in the morning and a bit doctors waiting room ish, could do with some background music or something. Anyway, the issue is the value for money in space. I booked a suite and compared to what else you can get in central London found it to be very compact, too much so. There was no view, just a brick wall opposite. It is quiet and dark at night which is good though for the area. A couple of touches I am used to were missing, no DVD player in the room and no tea/coffee facilities which I found odd. When we asked for a DVD player we were told it was an additional GBP 30 per day! So, yes, it is very nice, oldy worldy and an experience. Unlikely one I would repeat as there are just so many options in London, especially if you want a suite with some space.",4,2012,12,20
130,A magical experience,"It took me quite a while to persuade my husband that it would be really nice to stay at the Dorchester and last year we stayed for a weekend just before Christmas. We had such a wonderful time that as we stood at the desk and checked out he looked at me and said that we should stay every year! True to his word we have just returned from our second stay.
Just like last year it did not disappoint, I can only describe it as magical. From the moment you walk through the doors you feel as though you are in different world. The level of service is excellent, throughout our entire stay we were made to feel so welcome, the hotel seems to draw you in and makes you feel as though you will be there forever. It's incredibly addictive, I never want to leave.
From breakfast  in the Promenade, to dinner in The Grill Room, with cocktails in the bar and the Christmas Carol festive afternoon tea, we thought we should try everything and I have just spent the weekend feeling like a princess sprinkled with fairy dust.
It's heaven on earth and I can not recommend it highly enough.",5,2012,12,17
130,Disappointed,"Attended a function at the hotel last night, and was disappointed to see how the feeding was organized. Waited for an hour and a half and then left as we couldnt get fed.

Was so looking foward to seeing the hotel, it is a beautiful building, however can't say the same for the hotel organization... cloak collection was also poorly done...",2,2012,12,14
130,Wonderful,"It was my boyfriends 40th birthday and we went here to celebrate the ocassion with some of his friends. When we pulled up outside after a lovely limo ride from Kent,the hotel looked magical,inside it just got better,the tree was perfect and the gingerbread hotel was out of this world. We had an evening meal in The Grill,we were a party of 8,the room itself was understated luxury,the table was just so. We were very lucky to receive two complimentry courses. I had smoked salmon which was of course THE best I have ever tasted,carved wafer thin,my boyfriend had wood pigeon for starters and it was beautifully presented too,as well as tasting lovely. I had the suckling pig and he had the venison both,again tasted wonderful,alas we were all too full for the tempting deserts but had coffee,tea and hot chocolate and some sweets which were a lovely touch. The bill for 8 of us,including two kids meals and of course drinks came to £500 which we all thought wasn't bad considering. I will definately go again,maybe for afternoon tea or a mid day meal. Thank you for the lovely staff,nothing was too much trouble there and for an unforgettable experience and Christmas memory.",5,2012,12,12
130,The Perfect Place for a Celebration,"We visited for a weekend to celebrate my 18th birthday and the stay was nothing short of amazing. We were looked after fantastically and it was a hugely memorable weekend. 

The hotel kindly laid on special touches for my birthday which included a bottle of Champagne and a delicious and beautifully presented birthday cake. The Christmas Tree in the lobby was stunning, as were the decorations in the Promenade which made breakfast even more special. The breakfasts were enormous and cooked to perfection. The staff were so obliging and seemed like nothing was too much trouble. The gingerbread model of the hotel in the lobby is a feat of engineering! 

Would definitely return!",5,2012,12,10
130,Magical weekend,"Stayed two nights at the Dorchester lovely room with a very comfy bed , the service was excellent all the staff could not do enough for you . Food was superb loved the breakfast served in the room 
Well worth the money. The Dochester has a lovely comfy feel and the Christmas tree and decoration definately made me feel in the Christmas mood. Thanks to all the staff for making our weekend magical",5,2012,12,08
130,A fabulous Christmas treat,"I booked for a one night stay for my annual Christmas trip to London with a friend. I had searched a few hotels but decided upon The Dorchester.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely.
Everything from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, everything was flawlesss.  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff (even delivering a toothbrush and toothpaste to me at 2am when I realised I had not packed mine).   The cocktails are amazing, the breakfast to die for and the genuine care and consideration from the staff second to none.
There was an unfortunate incident when my friend checked a bag into the cloakroom and an item was broken when the attendant dropped her bag.  The hotel sent someone to go to Fortnum & Mason's and replace the  broken item for her.  What fantastic service is that?
I am looking to spend a couple of days in London in the Spring and believe I will be hard pushed to find a better hotel than this for my stay.",5,2012,12,07
130,Superb customer service,"Me and my mother visited for her birthday late November, we are still overwhelmed by our stay and the service we received. We were treated like royalty the while time, nothing was too much trouble for them, everything tied up, all previous planned arrangements went perfectly. A lovely free bottle of bubbly. If a place like the Dorchester can treat 'nobodies' like this when they are dealing with the rich and famous day in day out then they deserve all the praise they get. Oh and the pillows were heavenly! ",5,2012,12,04
130,Still a top place to stay but breakfast was a little chaotic,"We love staying at the dorchester and always enjoy our overnight stay at the beginning of December when we go to London for Christmas shopping. As ever the room and staff were great.
However, arriving for breakfast at around 10.00am on Sunday morning we found people having to queue and we were being told of a wait time of 30-40 minutes. The two girls behind the lecturn were getting a little flustered as people were getting angry and walking away. I accept that there are only so many seats and tables but the staff must have had some idea as to when people turn up for breakfast plus, it's the Dorchester and we're are paying good money for great service. Things seemed to improve a little when management arrived, but by then the damage had been done. Our actual wait was still around 20 minutes. It won't stop us visiting again but you don't expect this sort of issue at London's best.",4,2012,12,03
130,A Special Birthday Treat,"I decided to take my mum to The Dorchester for 3 nights for her birthday. We were treated like royalty from before we even arrived. I emailed ahead to explain the purpose of our visit, and they ensured that notes were added to our booking. To our surprise we were upgraded on arrival. On a side note, Rod Stewart was standing in the lobby! When we arrived to our very spacious room, there was a lovely Birthday Cake on display, with a huge fruit bowl, box of chocolates, and a letter from the manager welcoming us to the hotel. What a great start to our trip. I made a reservation at China Tang, the in-house chinese restaurant. It was probably the best Chinese restaurant we have ever dined at. The quality of the meat was superb. I'd highly recommend it. We used the bar a few times during our stay. Sat next to Chris Eubank and Matt Goss. Another lovely experience for my mum! Breakfast was probably the best thing about our stay. The amount/quality was second to none, and the service was very attentive. I will return as soon as possible.",5,2012,12,03
130,"OMG, what a fantastic experience","Having gone to London for a random day out, our car decided to misbehave, so knowing we were unable to get home (2hrs away) we checked into the Dorchester....we were not dressed to the nines, and probably looked a little dishevelled, yet the staff couldn't have been more helpful, friendly and accomodating, upgrading us to a wonderful suite with a jacuzzi bath, lounge and dining room! We've stayed in many hotels, but will now go out of our way to stay here! The front of house staff were fantastic.",5,2012,12,02
130,Keep everything under the lock,"I agree it has the history and great location but i don't think the service no longer befits the definition of a luxury hotel. I woke up in the morning to find that there is no toothbrush and no toothpaste available in our room. For the amount that they charge you would think that they can afford a toothpaste right? I then called up room service to send me one, waited hour and no one showed up. Now the worst part is that this place has I think most neglected security service. What I lost was an insignificant and perhaps a trivial stuff. Oh well, so what someone else wanted it. Not jewelry and not cash money. After checking out I called back the hotel to request them to look for the item I lost. I informed them that I either left it in the hotel room or someone just snatched it while it was under storage with concierge. The security personel promised to call me back. It's been two days now and I haven't even received an apology call. It doesn't matter what I lost but it's lack of attention and negligence that really bothered me. For fellow travellers, not worth staying. The hotel has become somewhat lackluster in service and attention. ",3,2012,12,01
130,Another flawless stay,"Revisited The Dorchester Nov.18-28. The festive season was in full swing and the hotel decorations were terrific - especially in the Promenade. As always, the service was perfect - with special mention to the breakfast, bar, and housekeeping staff. But more important was the feeling that the folks know this is my London home away from home - from the minute I arrive, it's like stepping through my front door. Thanks to all - and have a wonderful Christmas!",5,2012,11,30
130,Didn't meet expectations,"I have just returned from a three-night stay at The Dorchester and found the hotel, whilst undoubtedly very good, fell short of expectations. 

Let me begin by saying that the staff were all excellent. Everybody we dealt with was polite, professional and friendly. My girlfriend and I were usually greeted by name and room service was always quick and courteous. 

My main gripe is the blatant avarice of the hotel's owners. Now, I know that other top flight hotels adopt similar practices but there are much more affordable places to stay which offer such facilities as full satellite television (The Dorchester offers a very limited selection of channels), complimentary wifi (£19.50 per day here) and a complimentary minibar (£3.50 for a packet of crisps, when I've just paid £450 for the room? Really?) as a matter of course. 

Further to this, the room service menu states that a delivery charge of four pounds would be added to each order. I assume that this surcharge doesn't reach the waiter, who is probably on not much more than the national minimum wage, so it is most rapacious of the hotel's owners to exploit customers in this way. I'd rather not have to pay a delivery charge and tip the waiter in cash. 

At least they notify you in advance that you'll be charged for room service. At check-in, the hotel informed me that as well as the total cost of the room, they would be taking an up-front fee of £200 per night to cover room service and other charges. I would have had no objection had I been forewarned of this, but no mention of this policy was made at any point during the reservation process. 

As far as the hotel is concerned, the public areas are all of a high standard and The Promenade Bar, in particular, stands out. All food and drink was of a high standard but our room, whilst spacious and with a beautifully appointed bathroom, had a few minor flaws, ill becoming of such a prestigious property: not one of the lampshades in our room was correctly aligned; the docking station for iPods was so worn that it would only play if the device was physically held in place; there was dust on one of the bathroom shelves; the television wasn't correctly formatted, so that widescreen broadcasts reached beyond the parameters of the screen; the fruit bowl wasn't replenished on a daily basis. 

Overall, I'd say that The Dorchester is a fairly average five-star hotel and doubt that I'll be going back there. ",3,2012,11,28
130,Comfortable home away from home,"This hotel is superb in every way.  The service is attentive and helpful while allowing a high degree of privacy without incessant interruptions.  The staff is wonderful.  Our room is large and traditionally furnished in understated elegance.  The hotel has a lively chic international clientele.  The food is very good.  Reception was efficient, elevators quick, bath water very hot and fast, room service delivery less than 30 minutes, wall outlets convenient for charging phones, room lighting varied and abundant....really am enjoying my stay!",5,2012,11,28
130,"Excellent Service, Wonderful Vacation!","I was in London with my partner and our very wonderful friend from November 10th  through the 18th. We were treated royally!  This was our (my partners' and mine) first visit to London, we were thinking it was going to be more formal and, well, snooty. We couldn't be more wrong. Everyone was friendly and welcoming.
From the first step into the lobby, to our rooms, the Dorchester certainly does not disappoint!  Our first meeting of the reception staff was memorable, we were waited on by Alfonso and lovely blond young lady, I'm sorry i didn't get her name..... They were polite, knowledgeable and accommodating.   Our room.... well, it was beautiful!  Vintage charm with modern updates.....
 I've read other reviews where they complained about the old style of the hotel, we were certainly enamored.... The bathroom was luxurious, deep soaking tub, large shower stall, with excellent water pressure!  The bed was quite comfortable and view of Hyde Park was terrific to wake up to. 
Our visits to the Grill and Promenade were equally appealing. The attention to detail was amazing, with professional service and excellent food. We usually had either breakfast or dinner at the Hotel, among traveling through the city and visiting various pubs and restaurants. The food was delicious and presented quite beautifully! Our servers at the Grill welcomed us daily, remembering what we liked, recommending new things that we might like, and asking about our visit. I have to say, we were really impressed. We were at the front desk on the 14th and were talking with Alfonso, and he heard that it was my birthday, wishing me a warm Happy Birthday and hoping that we enjoyed our afternoon. Upon return from a shopping trip to Harrod's, we returned to our room to find a chocolate mousse and a bottle of champagne waiting for us!  I was certainly touched at this gesture, it meant a lot to me that he would take the time to make us that much more welcome!
I would like to take a moment to thank the hotel staff for taking such wonderful care of us! I spoke with Martin, I believe his name was, at the theater desk, and he was able to get us tickets for Wicked, excellent seats my friend!! And the gentlemen at the concierge desk were always knowledgeable and helpful!
Alfonso left on holiday before we checked out, so I was unable to thank him, so, Thank you Alfonso, I hope that next time we are in London, we have the good fortune to see you again!

If you are looking to be treated like a Queen or King, you certainly need to visit this wonderful place!

Thank you again!",5,2012,11,27
130,High Tea in the Promenade,"Enjoyed afternoon High Tea in the Promenade the food and service was exceptional and the Promenade its self is lovely.  A great way to spend an afternoon, pure luxury, the scones were the best I have ever tasted and the selection of pastries contained some truly unique combinations of flavours.",4,2012,11,26
130,Superb stay. Perfect hotel,"This hotel was excellent. Our stay was superb. The staff were exceptional, everyone of them very friendly and polite. The room was amazing and on checking in we were upgraded.
Afternoon Tea in the promenade was an experience i will never forget. If you are looking for a luxury hotel in London i believe the Dorchester is at the top. Thank you for such a fantastic stay. We will be back.",5,2012,11,25
130,A Perfect Intro to London,"Can enough things ever be said about The Dorchester? We are a family of Aussies who arrived in London for the first time. We had all been so looking forward to our stay there, but must have presented a treat as we piled in, jetlagged from the horrible 24 hour flight and in much dissarray. We are from Tasmania, so London was a huge confrontation to us in such a state. I will never forget the ready welcome from the doorman as I came out of the car, and the surroundings as we entered were almost intimidating - that same doorman was to be most helpful to us several times. The rooms were lovely, the beautiful bathrooms so welcoming to someone tired and aching, and the selection of food from the room service menu was so gratefully used at 3am when we were wide awake. The beds were just beautiful and luxurious. Breakfast in The Promenade was an experience, and a waiter named Michael was particularly delightful. Too much formality can be very oppressive to teenagers, but he had them laughing at at their ease in no time, without losing his professional manner - he was wonderful and we still talk about how charming he was. The Promenade itself is stunning, and I would happily have sat looking at it for hours, the food was wonderful and the service second to none. The Dorchester manager has much to be proud of and the staff are trained to perfection. It was an extravagance to be sure, but I hope I am never jaded enough to fail to be delighted in such surroundings.",5,2012,11,24
130,Afternoon Tea in Style,"Enjoyed a champagne afternoon tea to celebrate my friend's birthday.  The promenade within the hotel is where you are seated and it is English style at its best.  Beautiful colours, lighting and staff as well as a wonderful array of sandwiches, scones and pastries.  A glass of champagne was included in our tea and then the pianist played Happy birthday for my friend and the waiter brought out a complementary individual chocolate birthday cake complete with candles ... a lovely touch that really made my friend smile.

If you want to experience one of London's finest landmark hotels then you won't e disappointed.",5,2012,11,23
130,WONDERFUL STAY! RECOMMEND!!,"We had a wonderful stay for my husbands 50th Birthday, we received a room upgrade on checking in. The room was very comfortable. The staff and service throughout the hotel was superb, we have already booked to come back in December for 2 nights. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel! Breakfast is exceptional. Wonderful hotel, great friendly atmosphere.",5,2012,11,20
130,Superb,"I was taken to The Dorchester for afternoon tea as a birthday gift and loved it! The atmosphere is far friendlier and less OTT than the Ritz. The Dorchester is the type of place you can imagine going to regularly and feeling comfortable, rather than a place you go to once for a special occasion and never re-visit! We didn't feel awkward asking for more (and more!) sandwiches, and the variety of breads was wonderful. They gave me a complimentary cake, additional set of desserts and two Dorchester pens to take away because it was my birthday, which was a nice touch. The waiting staff took a genuine interest in why you were there, and stopped to chat rather than serving you and running away, but it was the personal touch of our server Oliver which really made the experience. Would recommend without hesitation!",5,2012,11,19
130,Perfect,"It was my first stay at The Dorchester and it most certainly will not be my last. The whole experience was quite superb and l completely fell in love with the hotel.
Service was impeccable as was the delicious breakfast enjoyed either in the Grill or Promenade each morning.
The whole ambience is delightful and very relaxing and although there were a few famous people in residence during our stay we were always greeted very warmly with a genuine smile and a warm welcome back. 
I have stayed in most of the five star establishments in London, many of which could learn a thing or two from this beautiful hotel and the delightful people who work there.",5,2012,11,16
130,Disappointingly snooty service,"While I didn't stay in the hotel itself, I was visiting for a business meeting recently. The person I was due to meet was delayed so myself and some colleagues decided a late breakfast would be nice to pass the time. I asked three times in the main foyer lounge for us to be looked after. In the end I fetched a menu myself from behind the desk, only to discover there were no breakfast items on it. 
Dismayed a colleague went into the bar off the main lounge and thankfully the staff there were more interested in us. The manager found us a table in the main lounge and ordered the coffee and pastries we'd been trying to get for over 30 minutes.
When it all arrived it was delicious and very well presented, however the service at such a swanky hotel put me off ever staying there. Never had such a problem at Claridges. A real shame.",3,2012,11,15
130,Simply the best,"There is no where like the Dorchester. Even though I was there with the Kardashians and there were 200 fans outside, inside was an oasis of tranquillity, with the exceptional personal service that the Dorchester is famous for.  This was my fifth stay there and I am a firm afficionado.  Just a wonderfiul place to stay.",5,2012,11,13
130,A great place for that special occasion,"We visited as a consequence of a gift from my daughter (thanks, Jenn and Adam!).
We had tea in the lounge with a glass of Champagne.

Of course it was all OTT, but we loved it. A good selection of speciality teas, sandwiches, scones, cakes...

Above all, it's a great place to people-watch. Who was that distinguished looking Arab gentleman??",5,2012,11,10
130,Delighful Dorchester,"The Dorchester is a wonderful hotel. The rooms are magnificent and the resturants fantastic led by Alain DuCass and China Tang.
I was there in September but you would be better there before August and after October",5,2012,10,31
130,Our favorite !,"We Have stayed at the Dorchester many times and still love the experience. Right from the moment when you pull up to the moment you leave it's a fantastic experience. 
The most magical time to stay at the Dorchester is leading up to Christmas.",5,2012,10,28
130,Rod Stewart,"Imagine my surprise when I noticed I was sipping a martini next to Rod Stewart.  What I loved about it is that Rod Stewart had the luxury of having a drink at this establishment without being bothered or even approached.  The hotel is elegant, service is attentive and efficient.  Our room was rather small for a suite but so are all those in Europe.  I loved that the hotel was across the street from Hyde Park which made it easier for me to go for my runs in the morning.  The concierges went out of their way to purchase show tickets and to advise wonderful entertainment venues.  The doormen attentive and ready to obtain a cab at anytime.",4,2012,10,25
130,Everything you would expect,"Fantastic hotel, excellent service.  Great service in The Prommanade bar - champagne and fruit in room.  Breakfast excellent especially the muesli.  The kind of hotel that makes you feel special.  Stayed here when attending Ascot and hotel staff superb in organising driver etc.  faultless in every respect.  Book with confidence, it is worth every penny!",5,2012,10,24
130,"Superb hotel, incredible service..","My wife and I stayed at the Dorchester for just one night earlier this week as I had a business meeting to attend during the day and in the evening we had a theatre visit planned.

It was our first stay at the Dorchester and in fact although we are fairly regular visitors to the capital, we had never set foot inside this hotel before.

On other recent visits to London we have stayed at the Lanesborough, Landmark and the Savoy, lunched at Claridges (but not stayed at the last one).

I haven't written any reports on the other hotels even though they were all excellent. However I am taking the time to write a few lines about our stay at the Dorchester because it was exceptionally good. Above the norm for a five star hotel.

The greeting, the room, the service, the food, the ambiance - in fact every aspect of our stay was perfect.

We didn't eat in the restaurant as we were going to the theatre but we did have afternoon tea and I have to say that the quality of the food and the standard of service was the finest that we had ever experienced.

The cleanliness of our room and bathroom was beyond reproach and the furnishings and fittings were above and beyond expectations.

There was one small glitch with the iPod dock; the power lead was present but the connection lead between this and the Bose unit was missing so I thought oh well I won't be able to play my own music but it's only one night - it wasn't really that important to us. However, I remembered about this on the way out to the theatre and mentioned it to the concierge in passing. On our return it had been replaced and although not a big deal to me I was able to play my latest downloads after all!

The staff at this hotel made our stay so enjoyable it will be impossible for us not to stay at the Dorchester again on our next trip - funds permitting!",5,2012,10,24
130,Superb!,"We spent 3 nights here at the end of September and thoroughly enjoyed it. We were upgraded from a deluxe room to a junior suite which was lovely. The room was pristine with a very comfortable bed, lovely bath 'smellies' and a fruit platter to welcome us. The staff were very friendly and attentive and it's a great place for celeb spotting! We dined in the hotel all 3 nights - China Tang, bustling and lively with excellent food, Alain Ducasse - also busy and superb (reservations a must to avoid disappointment), then a club sandwich in the bar late on the last night. We only had breakfast in The Grill on the first morning and there was a great selection with huge platefuls. Breakfast and afternoon tea are also served in the gorgeous foyer just around the corner from the showcases with lots of luxury goodies in them. We enjoyed it so much we're going back next year, this time in June.",5,2012,10,21
130,"Great location , superb service","My wife and I stayed two nights end of May 2012. Check in very cordial, without asking were upgraded to a huge room with hallway, door to bedroom. Lots of space for clothes, comfortable bed, nice shower and bath in large bathroom. In Park lane about 5 minutes brisk walk from Marble Arch in the heart of Oxford Street. On the way we passed luxury car dealerships. The hotel offers transport in a beautiful Rolls Royce, price do not ask. The value was great, satisfactory breakfast included but not a buffet. It was low season so rates were discounted by half, about 400 pds per night. The service is just exceptional, the fixtures outstanding. On the downside the bags took about an hour to reach the room, and the concierge was not representative of the standard of service elsewhere. You may not get the advertised view.",5,2012,10,17
130,World Class,"A beautiful hotel. Our deluxe room was extremely spacious, noise free, and richly furnished, with an abundance of storage space, lovely products and a very comfortable large bed.  Staff were courteous, helpful and efficient throughout. Location is good and the promenade/foyer is such a delightful space for breakfast, afternoon tea or a drink or two. No pool though there is a Spa. Definitely one of Londons' best.",5,2012,10,15
130,The most beautiful Hotel I´ve ever been,"This hotel is simply perfect. I stay here with my friend two years ago. The breakfast was brilliant, servise was very kind and nice. Bed was perfect and the bathroom....Luxury... I really enjoyed this stay.. I reccomend this to everybody who loves nice and luxury equipment, which this hotel present. Love it",5,2012,10,15
130,Great Service and Style,"It was my first visit to The Dorchester and my goodness was I impressed. A couple of friends and I organised afternoon tea and it was delightful. What a decadent afternoon.

The pastries were just as good as in Paris and the atmosphere was wonderful.

The staff excelled themselves especially a charming young man called Scott, who worked as a flower arranger. who was more than happy to show me the way to the powder room as I was a little disorientated. He was just so vibrant and really cared not only about the guests but the hotel. I will without a doubt recommend The Dorchester to all of my friends.

Thankyou Scott

Best Wishes

130,"High end hotel, good service, but not great value","While The Dorchester's location and service are excellent, and it is clearly a five star hotel, the hallways smell very smoky, and rooms vary pretty significantly in their size and view. Bathrooms are lovely and amenities are excellent. Very nice hotel, but others in the same circle - Lanesborough, fir example, deliver more with better style.",4,2012,10,11
130,Still the most comfortable hotel in London,"I have often stayed at the Dorchester for over a decade and a half. Out of curiosity I have also stayed several times over the years at the Lanesborough, Claridges, the Ritz and the new Savoy. But I have kept returning to the Dorchester, I think for me this says something. The foyer, promenade and rooms are very welcoming and comfortable, the staff are very friendly, efficient and to a high standard. We usually have breakfast in the promenade for which lately the hotel has been charging an extra £8, if this allows me to eat there whilst other people don't select this option then that's fine with me. The staff at breakfast were excellent and the breakfast itself was very good indeed, good quality ingredients and very well cooked, a nice experience as usual. My wife noticed on this occasion that the staff were more friendly and accommodating compared with previous times we have visited, we got the feeling that this is management style, however if it is'nt then an accolade to the staff is due. There is no doubt in my mind and I know there is no doubt in the mind of others that I know that the design of the grill restaurant is unbelievably bad. No doubt the designer received a fat fee but try and find anyone who thinks it's a good design compared to the remainder of the hotel. I suppose the Dorchester can't afford to change it now, in my opnion someone should have beed sacked over it. Still the rest of the hotel is lovely.",5,2012,10,10
130,What an experience,"What can you say about the Dorchester Grill Experience.

Everybody should eat here at least once in their lifetime!

From the moment of arrival, you are treated like royalty.

Excellent food, service & atmosphere!

130,"Superb decor, service and ambience permeates throughout!","The Dorchester is one of London's ""grand"" hotels. With it's elegant lobby, superb service, lovely afternoon tea, wonderful restaurant, and impeccably appointed rooms, you'll feel very comfortable and right at home the minute you check into this hotel. The bathrooms are well stocked and roomy, and the beds and pillows/linens are perfectly lovely and you won't miss anything from home---in fact, after a few days here, you'll want to move right in---it's that comfortable here!! Love it here.",5,2012,10,07
130,Simply perfect!,"Totally faultless! What a great stay- room was amazing! We stayed for 2 nights, whilst attending a family wedding nearby. For the price it still represents good value for money- service is second to none in London.",5,2012,09,26
130,The Grande Dame Redeemed,"Last year I posted a review to Tripadvisor detailing my disappointment with the Dorchester in London.  For years, I had visited it annually and considered it the crème de la crème of its kind.  Last year was so disappointing, I had to speak out.

To my surprise, a manager contacted me regarding my review and asked if I would return to give them another chance.  This summer, I took her up on her offer.  I was upgraded to a suite upon arrival (no doubt due to the negative experience of the prior summer).  

The suite was stunning.  The master bedroom featured a four-poster bed, the master bathroom had a large whirlpool bath and the living area was adorned with cherry wood and comfortable furnishings.  A Bose sound system was hooked up to the room and the mini bar was elaborately set up with spirits and snacks.  Despite its proximity to the front of the hotel, the room itself was quiet.  Housekeeping was very efficient and punctual.

With such a large dining room table, we took advantage of room service and are glad we did.  Everything was set up formally- tablecloth and silverware to match. The smoked salmon was strikingly fresh and the Caesar salad was nice and tart.  We actually cancelled our dinner plans one evening to dine in, the service and food was so enjoyable.

I am impressed at the Dorchester’s response to my original Tripadvisor review and pleased to say my faith has been restored.  I look forward to my return visit.",5,2012,09,25
130,Good hotel but....,"Stayed for 5 nights, went to Paris for 2 nights and checked back into Dorchester for another 4 nights. 

Check-in was smooth but they didn't receive my telegraphic transfer payment from 4 days ago so I had to plonk down some money as security. Not a big issue. We had 2 Deluxe King rooms and 1 of them required an extra bed which we had to pay for. When we got to our rooms, we realized they had put in an extra bed in both rooms so we asked them to remove it from the smaller of the room as it was really cramped. The 2 deluxe rooms were different in size and layout. And 1 was markedly smaller than the other. Still we were tired after a 14-hr flight and didn't ask to change. In all fairness the room was adequate but I expected more from a £500 per night room. But I heard that was the going rate for a 5-star hotel in London. 
Breakfast next morning was great. We ordered the British Breakfast and everything was super nice. Granted it was pricey- £34 per set but it came with the freshest bread and we get 2 eggs cooked our way with sides of bacon, ham, black and white puddings, mushrooms and tomatoes. Plus juice, coffee/tea, cereals or fruit salad. Service was nice and friendly and you can't beat the atmosphere at The Promenade. 
Overall stay was pleasant but Housekeeping was a little erratic. Some days they don't replace the bottled water in the rooms and they keep throwing my bedroom slippers away. I was happy to wear the same pair for my entire stay. They offer a turndown service but once they came knocking at 1030pm when we were already in bed. So that's a little strange. 
Location was not great in my opinion. It was quite a long walk to either Hyde Park Cnr tube station or Green Park tube station. After a few days we just took a cab everywhere and realized all the shopping was so close to our hotel. Not close enough to walk, but less than 10 mins by cab. In some cases less than 5 min. 
All in all it was pleasant but I've stayed in far better hotels ( not in London though). That said, I might possibly return if I were ever in London again. 
",4,2012,09,24
130,Not a patch on the Ritz,"We spent one night here recently. Nothing went wrong and we were upgraded to an executive room. Having stayed at the Ritz earlier this year we assumed the Dorchester would be similar, but we discovered it's not in the same league. At the Ritz we were saying 'wow' so many times with everything. At the Dorchester we never said it once . 

The hotel looked tired in most places. The bar/cafe/room used to hold guests while waiting for their room to be prepared - who the hell designed it > A mortician? So gloomy and very dated. The one at the Ritz is so palatial you don't want to leave it.

Breakfast is by comparison with the Ritz, is like McDonalds with posh seating. Eggs served were cool. Muesli was the most pathetic quality I've ever experienced. Overall very disappointing breakfast.

Our room rate included breakfast, so when I checked the bill I was suprised to find an £8 'service charge' added with no explanation....as if they assumed you would pay it - I did not.
Breakfast, if I remember rightly, was £32, so another £8 on top is rediculous.

Overall, disappointing.",4,2012,09,23
130,"Dorchester, London","My girlfriend and I stayed at the Dorchester for four days prior to embarking on a cruise leaving from Dover.  When we arrived, our room was not quite ready, so the staff seated us in their breakfast tea area and gave us some complimentary snacks until the room was ready.  All the staff were friendly and superb.  Our morning waiter for breakfast, Micheal, was absolutely wonderful.  He was dressed in tie and tails.  His service was impeccable and he was extremely friendly- giving us a number of hints of things to do in London.  The English breakfasts were excellent.  The concierge was very helpful in obtaining tickets to plays and for recommendations for restaurants in the area.
The hotel is across the street from Hyde Park, which is delightful to stroll through. 
Our room was very spacious for Europe and was decorated very nicely.  The bathroom was marble and had a separate shower and tub.
The bar was also very nice.  It was nicely decoarted and the staff were very friendly and competent.  I had the probably the bestgin and tonic there that I have ever tasted.
Overall, it was a delightful stay and I would certainly go back the next time I am in London.",5,2012,09,13

130,They Just don't get it????,"Before I start can I just say it not about the money that I am writing this it's about Principle

As anyone that has stayed at the Dorchester will know it is a beautiful hotel and the location is very good, but why do I have to pay £4 delivery service for a room service Cheese burger when they are charging me £ 26 for it already??
And then they want to charge me £19-50 a day for wifi which I can get in Starbucks or mcDonalds for FREE oh and there is another 12.5% added as "" discretionary "" for everything you get
Other than the Penny pinching what they should do is put an extra amount on the cost of the stay then make you feel better by saying all these things are complimentary anyway that's just my point of view.",3,2012,09,09
130,Expensive but worth every penny,"Opulent yes, decadent yes, expensive, yes.  But for a reason - everything was pretty much PERFECT.  Elegant furnishings in the room, deep marble bathtub was fantastic.  Complimentary bottle of champagne and fruit basket on arrival was an unexpected nice touch.  The bar is a touch pricy and seems to be frequented by some less-desirable members of society (think escorts, not bankers!), but overall yes, we'd stay here again.",4,2012,09,08
130,"Yes it's expensive, but it's worth every single penny","Came here for my wife's birthday (sat 25th August).  She loves afternoon tea, she's been to the rtiz and various other in and around London.  She claims to have never had such a fantastic afternoon tea.

We were served by a French chap (it wasn't Anton, but he came over and was lovely as well).  The guy was fantastic, you can tell he loved his job (if he doesn't he should be an actor) nothing was too much trouble, his bater was terrific, so attentive.

The food was lovely, sandwiches first class, scones delicious, the cakes were great as well.  As many as you want, I was stuffed by the time we left.  

Explained at reception it was my wife's birthday, they brought out a little cake and the pianist played happy birthday, a few people clapped., a lovely moment that topped off a really really lovely afternoon.

I'm not one of these types of people who really enjoys these affairs, but honest to god, the place, the food and the whole experience was amazing.  Will return without a doubt,",5,2012,09,03
130,Lovely afternoon tea,"My husband treated me to afternoon tea for my 30th birthday. It was such a lovely afternoon. The service was excellent and we felt very spoilt.
We were at the end of the afternoon tea, so the sandwiches were not as fresh as they could of been but they were still very tasty. I was catered well for as a veggie, but there wasn't as much sandwich choice, however it was still excellent.
We had drinks at the bar in the evening and it was also really special there and we felt very well looked after. We can't wait to visit again.",5,2012,08,28
130,Great Hotel,"The Dorchester is a classic luxury hotel. The location is terrific, and the service is superb. As is typical for London hotels, the rooms are not huge, although ours was quite comfortable. Virtually every other London hotel is cheaper; The Dorchester is very expensive, but for a special trip to London this is a great choice.",5,2012,08,26
130,What makes our country great the world over!,"The Dorchester displays everything that is good about true England. A wonderful, traditional hotel, retaining all the touches of excellence found only in the very best hotels.
The interior is decadent and luxurious, and the service is impeccable.

Dinner was lovely in China Tang, but be careful in the bar as a few drinks turns into a session, and at the Dorchester a 'session' will cost hundreds (as we found out). That's not a complaint, as I'd do it over having had so much fun.

Keep up the cracking good work, keep giving us Brits a good reputation!",5,2012,08,24
130,Elegant Hyde Park Hotel,"The Dorchester is an elegant, high-end hotel across the street from Hyde Park. The style is traditional, formal and exclusive. The service is impeccable, with everyone from housekeepers to front desk staff greeting us by name. The rooms were serviced immediately following our departure each day. The rooms range in size from intimate to grand suites; they feature flat screen TVs, internet (high speed requires a daily fee), comfortable seating areas, well-appointed bathrooms, fluffy robes, slippers and nightly turn-down service. 
This hotel attracts an older, well-traveled clientele.",5,2012,08,23
130,Thanks to the Bar,"Love the bar at the Dorch, Simon, the bar manager is a true gent and still remembers us after all these years. I would recommend the signature cocktail, followed by a glass of LP in the Promenade bar as the barmen there will look after you very well!",5,2012,08,21
130,The most amazing hotel,i had a family occasion celebration at this hotel and we all stayed for a couple of days despite living in London.The hotel is in the centre of London and offers brilliant views of Hyde Park opposite.The rooms spacious and tastefully decorated.Food and service is exemplary and we could not have asked or expected anything better.It is expensive to stay here but if you want a very special experience and can afford it don't hesitate.,5,2012,08,21
130,"Hands down, best afternoon tea ANYWHERE!","My family attended afternoon tea at the Dorchester and it couldn't have been more perfect.  The tea was excellent.  They gave us two servings (and sent a whole serving to go) of sandwiches and several extra scones.  Service was impeccable.

This is one place in London where it would behoove you to dress up a bit.  No tennis shoes or jeans.",5,2012,08,20
130,Loved it,Had an anniversary dinner at the Grill restuarant. The staff/service was impeccible and the food was fantastic. The waiters were aware of the occasion and came out with a cake which impressed me! I could not fault anything.,5,2012,08,20
130,A Very Fine Holiday Experience!,"It's been two years since our visit to London for the Christmas Holiday, and our visit to the Dorchester for high tea is as vivid a memory as if it were yesterday. The Promenade Room was transformed into a strikingly beautiful blend of warm colors with wreaths and bows complementing the leather seats and dense carpet. I could not have imagined a more welcoming sight in the foyer than the exquisitely festive tree. Truly a feast for the mouth and the eyes!",5,2012,08,14
130,The best afternoon tea... full stop!,"We've had the pleasure of afternoon tea at the The Dorchester a few times now and it is impossible to fault. The Promenade provides opulent surroundings and furnishings and is wonderful for people watching. Service is exemplory, the staff being most helpful and impeccably well mannered. A good selection of teas with unlimited supply and more than ample portions of delicious sandwiches, scones and delightfully imaginative cakes and fancies - absolutely splendid. We are fortunate enough to enjoy afternoon teas all over the country and in London too (including The Langham recently), but as yet nowhere can top the Dorchester!",5,2012,08,08
130,Excellent London hotel for business travellers,"Stayed at the Dorchester for 2 nights. I was in town on business and everything throughout my  stay was very efficient and to the level as would be expected from a 5 star hotel. Service was prompt, check-in/out quick, and I encountered no issues whatsoever. As I was traveling on business, it was important to me that I did not have to deal with any hassles or headaches - meaning, no errors on room charges, slow check-in, or any troubles with wifi. The Dorchester ended up fulfilling what I needed - excellent location in Mayfair, close to Green Park and Hyde Park (for morning jog), and prompt, efficient service with no extra hassles or headaches. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly to those looking for quality, excellent service, and a stress free stay.",5,2012,08,07
130,"Great service, good location, so so rooms","First let me say the service level at the Dorchester is exemplary;absolutely faultless (should be at these price but in London often not the case 
).  The location is very good, convenient to Mayfair and a number of tube stations. The rooms (at least my room) however was only so so.   

I have been tothe grill and the public spaces a number of times, but this was the first time I have stayed in one of the rooms.  Perhaps, because of the high level of service and general reputation of the Hotel, I expected more from the room. It is my understanding that the rooms here have a great deal of variation so perhaps I just got a particularly poor draw. The room while clean had a slightly odd layout and was is serious need of a remodel; a number of the hinges on the cabinetry were starting to fail, bathroom was seriuosly out of date.  I was staying as part of a group during the Olympics and the hotel was absolutely full so did Not ask to get a different room (if traveling solo at a different time would have).

The hotel was very good for why and when I was staying there, would go back for the Grill or Tea not sure if it would be near the top of my list as a place to stay.",4,2012,08,05
130,Exceptional!,"Exceptional in every way. Over the top service from the front desk to the Concierge to the chamber staff.  First class in every way. Beds and pillows are amazing.  The only draw back was the cost of breakfast in the lobby.  Very expensive for very little. Pass on the pastry basket unless you plan on eating it. It comes to your table automatically and  costs 10 pounds.  24 hour gym is a nice perk!   I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Walking distance to everything including Oxford street, Harrods and the palace. ",5,2012,08,03
130,Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful time having afternoon tea at The Dorchester celebrating my husband's 50th Birthday.  We both throughly enjoyed the experience and the staff made us feel very welcome, including playing happy birthday on the piano and giving my husband a very delicious cake.  Thank you so much, highly recommend it to anyone and would certainly come again.",5,2012,08,03
130,The best afternoon tea in London,"I visited The Dorchester for the third time for afternoon tea, and it is still superb. The Promenade where tea is served is a gorgeous, tranquil and very comfortable room. The staff are excellent and the food was superb. Unlike other places, there is unlimited tea and I was offered second and third helpings of sandwiches. A wonderful experience, and vastly superior to other afternoon tea offerings in town.",5,2012,08,02
130,"WOW, I was impressed!!","I stayed in this hotel for two nights and I find this hotel the most exclusive I have ever visited. Everything starting from reception staff, interior design (English:)), meals, rooms were perfect. Of course it is very expensive and I would never pay so much money by myself to stay there:). Surrounding are is quite OK., you can find there lot of trees and it is not so far from Oxford Street.  At the end I meet there in lobby Rowan Atkinson … and that made my stay here even better:))",5,2012,07,31
130,Perfect afternoon tea,"Beautiful surroundings, friendly but highly efficient and welcoming staff.  Tea was perfection. We were never hurried and would certainly go back for more, a welcome oasis of calm in the hustle of London",5,2012,07,31
130,Incredibly unprofessional front desk; mediocre tea. Skip it.,"My partner and I were spending a Sunday night in London before a long flight the following day and she opted to book us into the Dorchester based on its exceptional reputation and its high ratings for its afternoon tea. This was our first--and last--stay at the Dorchester. We were hoping that this hotel could become our new go-to in London (my partner is a native Londoner, and we are there quite frequently) but sadly, this grand old hotel is no longer up to snuff.

Our first interaction was with the doorman, who was gracious, removed our luggage from the taxi for us, and provided a warm, unobtrusive welcome--precisely what you would expect. Our bags were moved for us (I mention this only because some of the other reviewers had issues getting their baggage handled) and we were then moved on to the front desk.

The young woman at the front desk was polite, but didn't remember to introduce herself. She seemed to have an extremely difficult time figuring out how to charge my partner's card, then attempted to put through a higher pre-authorization on the card, which was then declined (we keep a card with a small limit specifically as a safety against fraud, and since they had *already* pre-authorized the card for the room rate and now attempted to pre-authorize it again for the same amount, it was declined). This appeared to cause the woman more confusion, and finally I just handed over one of my own credit cards for only the £200 pre-authorization. (Reading other reviews, it appears that they had not had a £200 pre-authorization on top of the pre-authorization for the room itself unless they booked with a debit card.) All in all, check-in was far from smooth and appeared extremely amateur at best. More on the card issues--which were worse than what appeared to be incompetent fumbling--later.

She gave us a very perfunctory tour--we stood in the center of the lobby and she pointed in the directions where things were located. We did ask whether we would be able to have tea the same day, and they did squeeze us in with little fuss--but still the hint of ""we're doing you a favour"", not something you want at this level of hotel. The woman who checked us in then took us to our room, and a few minutes later our bags appeared with a young gentleman who very heavily hinted at wanting a tip--while I am happy to tip for service, I refuse on principle when someone looms over me and lingers in expectation, and practically has to be asked to leave the room when two women are in it. He hovered by the bed, I waited for him at the door. Rude, and unprofessional. Also a touch menacing.

The room itself was pleasant. I found it interesting that complimentary water was not available. While we did have a view towards some duct work, we were on the 5th floor and this limited the damage (and eliminated the potential noise). A minor quibble is that the slippers provided were both huge (we're both women, and don't wear a men's size 44) as were the bathrobes. It would be nice to have sizing preferences asked for in advance. Since we were staying only one night, we didn't inquire as to whether other sizes were available.

We dressed for tea but found that most people didn't. We waiteded for several minutes by a Middle Eastern camera crew and press team in full swing--very odd, and at first had two waiters, a blond-haired man and a dark-haired man, but the blonde disappeared and we were left in the darker-haired waiter's very capable hands. He was polite, friendly, charming: perfect. When he didn't know the answer to a question, he quickly found someone who did. While after a day of transit we didn't mind sitting around for three hours, it did seem as though tea service was very understaffed. There were lulls in service where someone could have topped up our tea etc that seemed to be caused by too few servers for too many tables, though the place was not completely full.

Since our decision to stay here was heavily swayed by Sunday tea reviews, we had high expectations. We opted for the Dorchester High Tea with champagne. Unfortunately, the food was extremely underwhelming. Sandwiches were bland, and too large for high tea. They were offered at least three times (which we declined), perhaps a nod to people coming in for a full meal, which isn't what tea is about. The impression was one of wanting to ""fill you up"" with heavy, bland sandwiches. 

Our mains were likewise bland and underwhelming, and my partner left almost all of hers. Scones and accompaniments appeared next. I found the scones too eggy and dense, though the home-made jams and Cornish cream were lovely. The desserts were an utter disaster: flavourless cherry-based gelee in a waxy chocolate cup, a lime and strawberry tart with pastry so hard we abandoned it altogether (perhaps someone left it in the mixer?), a soggy macaron, some sort of chocolate brownie with plasticky raspberry topping. The only edible cake was a coconut sponge with mango coulis, which was only fine--not exceptional. 

The tea itself was left to over-steep, and the initial bitter note of the first-flush Darjeeling told me that it had been steeped in water which was too hot (something one should never do to a more delicate tea). We were left utterly underwhelmed by everything but the service at tea, and it was an atrocious value for the quality of the meal itself. I can't fathom how the Dorchester continues to win awards if that is the sort of food it provides.

After tea, we went out for the evening and returned late at night. Turn-down service had been provided in the interim. While the bathroom was mostly clean, there was noticeable blue toothpaste splatter on the marble backdrop on one of the sinks. (Our toothpaste was white; this was from a previous guest.) The glass door on the tub/shower combination did not keep water from spraying all over the floor during the course of a shower. 

I'm not sure what sort of water softener the Dorchester uses, but the water was extremely, unpleasantly soft--used to London's water, we were both baffled by how soft the water in the hotel was, and neither of us had a positive experience in the shower because of it. (Filmy feeling left on our skin, hair dried out, etc.) The toiletries provided were fine, not exceptional, and we were left wishing we had packed our own.

We ordered breakfast to be delivered the following morning and settled in for a lovely night's rest. That is one thing I can say was a clear positive. The mattress was just firm enough, the pillows lovely, and the duvet appropriately-selected for the season. (I do agree with another reviewer saying that the sheets were starched within an inch of their life and therefore not soft, but this wasn't a problem for us.) Namely, the bed was what you would expect at a luxury hotel. This was about the only thing at the Dorchester that met (rather than exceeded) five-star standards.

Breakfast arrived on-time. Pancakes and waffles were ok, and warm, though not exceptional; my request for fresh mango was honoured with a mango which was a bit hard (another menu option had fresh mango standard, so I thought they would have ripe mango ready to go). The Bircher muesli was far too sweet and the coffee was absolutely undrinkable--stale, pre-ground, awful.

Check-out was a disaster. We ended up standing awkwardly at the desk for a good half hour (I'm glad we timed our departure to the airport early) as our card details were once again fumbled, this time by three separate people. I had a feeling of dread about the whole process and this is where the true face of the Dorchester's failed front desk infrastructure shows: my card (the one I gave permission to use for the £200 pre-authorization and NOTHING else) was pre-authorized for the £200 pre-authorization, the cost of the room, and then charged (correctly) for tea and breakfast. I at no point gave the Dorchester permission to pre-authorize me for the room, which my partner booked, and for which they pre-authorized her card TWICE. 

I was at no point told that I would be pre-authorized for the room rate. My name did not appear on the booking. I cannot fathom how this is even legal, and have never had anything similar happen anywhere in the world. I find it appalling and in extremely poor taste. Calling the young front desk staff incompetent is about the kindest word I can find, and I am baffled at the Dorchester's management permitting that sort of service to be their ""face."" Reading other reviews, it appears that a blatant misunderstanding of payment etiquette is the norm at this hotel.

Overall, this appears to be a grand hotel past its prime. We are contacting the management to express our concerns, but that doesn't change the fact that we will not be staying at the Dorchester again. London offers many hotels in this category, and one good waiter and a comfortable bed (which I would consider the bare basics at a hotel such as this rather than something exceptional) do not make up for terrible front desk service and other shortfalls which make the Dorchester only vaguely acceptable as a place to spend the night, presuming you don't mind unauthorized charges to your card, and a terrible value for your money.

FOLLOW-UP: We received the following e-mail from Ms Richter at the front desk: ""I clearly remember the situation as I was one of the two receptionists who were involved in your check-in and I was also the one who showed you to your room. Therefore, I hope I can shed some light on the situation and offer a genuine explanation. I must apologize for the inconveniences caused to you and your friend as it can be entirely put down to a miscommunication error on our side. The total authorization needed for your stay amounted to £XXX which included the room rate of £XXX, 20% VAT and £200 for incidentals. As a result I authorized £XXX on your credit card and £150 on your friend’s credit card. The additional authorization on your friend’s credit card of £XXX was authorized thinking we were not holding enough authorization and without the knowledge of the first authorization on your credit card. I have taken the steps of having the authorization on your and your friend’s credit cards released and they will be available to you within a couple of days. I would like to apologize for this mistake and I hope we can welcome you or your friend to the Dorchester again in the future.""

Read for yourself and consider whether a ""miscommunication error"" (not knowing, despite my partner telling them, that the card had already been pre-authorized) gives them permission to place a hold on someone else's card *without their consent*. It's curious that this came from the front desk, and not from management--and tells me that management doesn't see this as a problem.",1,2012,07,30
130,First class,We have stayed at The Dorchester many times and every time have received exceptionally good service from the time you arrive outside and they take your car to park it to the time you leave.  The rooms are very comfortable and clean.  We always have our breakfast in our room which has always been very good.  Will continue to go back there when staying in London as nothing is too much trouble for the staff to make your stay as pleasurable as possible.,5,2012,07,28
130,Sheer Luxury,"I have been staying at The Dorchester, off and on, since 1958 and it is simply THE BEST.
Wonderful decor and rooms, beautiful food in every restaurant and total efficiency and charm from all staff.

Will just keep going back.",5,2012,07,26
130,Afternoon Tea,"For a friend's birthday we all went for afternoon tea at the Dorchester and it was yum.  Beautiful setting, lavish tea with champagne to start and a time to really enjoy and remember.  Lovely and indulgent - expensive but worth it for the experience.",4,2012,07,22
130,great old fashioned london,"excellent location and the best afternoon in town. Lobby is a little dark but still service is superb, classic stuffy english in a good way. The chinese in the basement is one of the best in London with nice atmosphere and fantastic dim sum. Breakfast excellent. There seemed to be a ball every night but that did not bother us, it was interesting to watch.",5,2012,07,20
130,"Long on location, a tad short elsewhere!","A great and prestigous property frequented generally by an elite clientele and In most respects deserving of a five star rating.  Sadly, however, the main dining room is rarely available and, as I was informed, must be booked weeks in advance because of its popularity. The catch-phrase that it is all cooked by the same chef should be ignored!   The only option is to dine in the Bistro, with a fixed menu which becomes very tedious after day 2.  Certainly great fare for a drop-in or a quick lunch, but not an evening meal in an establishment with such a reputation.
Staff endevoured to provide vegatarian alternatives to the Bistro menu but with an obvious lack of enthusiasm which was reflected in the meals provided.
The option of trawling the nearby streets for a decent restaurant is not recommended! 
Our room was comfortable and immacualte, the bathroom amazing - In summary, a great place to stay but take a cut lunch!",4,2012,07,18
130,Gets better every time!,"This hotel is a huge favourite of mine! I have stayed over Christmas for 2 years in a row and I have to say there is nothing bad to say about this hotel. 

From the service to the food, to the beautiful decor and building it takes my breath away every time. 

If anyone has any doubt about visiting here, please dont. I would say that Christmas is one of the best times to go as they really do go all out and make it as festive as possible. 

Cream tea in your room looking over hyde park is a must!

130,Lovely treat,"We went for afternoon tea on 17/07/12 and it was lovely. Firstly, a doorman opened our taxi door and welcomed us through the revolving door of the hotel. The interior of the 'hallway' is amazing with stunning displays of flowers and decor - loved those marble pillars! The seating was sumptuous and the service excellent. The waiters were all very polite and constantly refilled our sandwich/scone/pastry plates - the food was gorgeous. Breakfast tea was mediocre though and although we enjoyed the whole experience immensely, I was disappointed that when leaving the hotel, the doormen virtually ignore you! I watched others come and go and no-one is acknowledged when leaving which is a shame. Other plus points are the amazing cars parked outside and the ladies cloakroom - beautiful. Would highly recommend this afternoon treat although there will be little change from a hundred pounds - without the champagne. Would have champagne next time!",4,2012,07,18
130,iconic,"its been 30 years i reside at The Dorchester occasionally when i am in London, and i have never been disappointed.  No wonder its one of the main choices for tasteful vips. even through its refurbishment, it has never lost the classic, elegant and relaxing feel.  Sometimes you feel like in 'Richie Rich' home. The restaurants are exquisite, the tea room wonderful, and the service unmatched.  peace of mind for me every time.... and when i need something done, trust the efficient concierge to handle your every whim.
not to mention the eye candy of the limited series cars that can be found as soon as you walk out of the hotel. the hotel is extremely pricey, of course, but that is all to be expected. 

thank you to the whole staff for making my 0 complaint stays possible.",5,2012,07,16
130,Everything one would expect and more,"Stayed here recently and was not disappointed.  Although the design is of a more traditional style and not what I would normally go for, the experience was outstanding.  From check in to departure everything was seemless and the staff where most professional. As you would expect the quality of everything is outstanding and this place really sets the standard of any five star establishment we have stayed in elsewhere.",5,2012,07,15
130,Immaculate,"My wife and I stayed here recently and cannot fully comprehend on here how immaculate this hotel is . From the moment you are greeted by the friendly concierge team it becomes immediately apparent how things are going to go from this moment on. The oppulence of the foyer, then the grandness of the tea room stretching down into the hotel is stunning . We checked in and the girl at the reception then escorted us to our room on the fourth floor . Me and the wife were in two minds as to whether we should take our shoes off when the lift door opened, the carpets looked brand new, the walk to the room took us around the floor space which was absolutely spotless. 
The room was lovely, it had a sort of historic feel without being dated . Because it is one of the most famous and grandios hotels in London I was expecting it to be really good , but it was excellent to be fair. We had drinks on the balcony of one of the suites on the 8th floor as we were attending an awards evening as my wife had won an award for the Company she works for . We then went and had dinner in one the suites , the waiting staff were great , there was about 20 of us eating, and they were attentive , friendly and polite.The food was excellent . Visited the bar for a drink after dinner , very plush bar with friendly bar staff.",5,2012,07,14
130,Amazing!,My Husband treated me to a surprise afternoon tea at The Dorchester. We had the most amazing time. The food was beautiful and you can eat & drink as little or as much as you can manage. The scones were so lovely and warm that we ate a few more... It would have been rude not to finish off the Cornish clotted cream and home made preserves. The staff made you feel so welcome and nothing was too much for them. Wonderful experience!,5,2012,07,14
130,Excellent,"Words are not enough to describe it.Our room 231 was beautifully furnished,spacious, very clean, the bathroom huge and fully equiped. The staff more than helpfull, smiley and polite. The concierge very helpfull in anything we asked for. Everything was just excellent! ",5,2012,07,09

130,Luxury pure and simple!,"My husband and I just had a weekend stay at the Dorchester - yes, the Dorchester, Park Lane!  This is not a usual occurence but it was my daughter's wedding and has wanted her wedding reception there since being a 5 year old when her father took her there for tea.  We had a standard room but it was not standard by any means.  A huge bed with pillows like marshmallows and a bathroom that I would love in my own home.  His and hers wash basins and a bath you could swim in it was so deep!  As you would expect, the food and service was fabulous in every way.  A wonderful stay but not one that I am likely to repeat unless I win the lottery!",5,2012,06,05
130,Anniversary Treat,On Wednesday 30th May we had the most amazing few hours having Afternoon Tea in the Promenade at the Dorchester. I really cannot recommend this highly enough. The setting was obviously very plush but not intimidatingly so. It was our Silver Wedding Anniversay and our special thanks must go to Marvin the waiter who was absolutley wonderful. He helped to make this visit so special. We will be back when next in London.,5,2012,06,02
130,On Top its Game,"We stayed at the Dorcherster at the end of may.It is one of the best hotel i have ever stayed in the world the staff are fantastic and very professional. On checkin we were welcomed back as previous guest and promptly upgraded to a suite which was great we were also warmly greeted by the concierge who remembered us from our previous visit. This is a great hotel with great staff the only thing is that the internet is not complimentary like other hotels of this level.
I will most certainlity staying he again when next in London.",5,2012,05,31
130,Victorian Paradise!,"Very beautiful victorian style hotel with all the royal trimmings! Me and my boyfriend stayed over for a holiday. Their breakfast was absolutely wonderful, with options that could wet your palate every morining! The concierge was very helpful with guiding us what to do and where. The rooms are very old style, a little creepy with little access to the internet accept if you are in the foyer area. The gym is very small but with everything that you could possible need. Really enjoyed my stay!",5,2012,05,30
130,sunday lunch,"booked for Sunday Lunch at the Dorchester grill room.  Have been before and all very nice as we expected.  The only criticism is that the dessert menu was not very exciting - i always think that desserts should be very naughty - but these were a bit boring, nothing decadent or exciting.  Otherwise the service was perfect, with good food as it should be.",5,2012,05,28
130,Best in breed,Stayed twice during April and May. Arguably the best urban hotel experience anywhere. The staff is unfailingly courteous yet easygoing - a rare combination. Special thanks to the housekeeping ladies who somehow knew exactly when I would take my morning walk and had the room refreshed by the time I returned. Bravo to all!,5,2012,05,27
130,Beautifully British...,"We stayed at The Dorchestor at the end of our travels and were not disappointed. A beautifully British hotel with outstanding service and rooms. 
We were collected from the Airport by a Rolls specially organised by the hotel for our arrival. Upon check in we were whisked away to our suite and our luggage promptly unpacked for us. 
The High Tea is the best in London - a delightful way to pass the time, and so much food you won't be needing dinner!
Fantastic location for shopping on the high street or exploring the Park.",5,2012,05,27
130,Very special,"Stayed here recently to attend a wedding at the hotel, very inpressed with our overall experience. The hotel is full of the opulence and grandeur one would expect the foyer was breathtaking with the beautiful smell from the huge flower arrangements. Our room was classic in design with huge queen bed and gorgeous marble stone bathroom. The decor is not my prefered contemporary style, more traditional but everything very chic and of the higest quality. The staff are extremely friendly & helpful one even showering my 1 year old son with free gifts from the hotel. The wedding was wonderful, food delicious. Breakfast in the promenade lovely and service indeed impeccable. Yes it's expensive, however to stay on Park Lane in one of London's most prestigious and celebrated hotels and be treated like royalty shouldn't and wouldn't come cheap. For a truly British and luxurious treat stay here and cherish it forever.",5,2012,05,22
130,Great Hotel!,"The dorchester is a great hotel, the champaign afternoon tea is amazing!!
The rooms are well sized and nice and quiet.. Fantastic customer service.
Breakfast was also fab!

130,Disappointing-better to visit than to stay!,"Wow, I've never stayed at The Dorchester Group Hotels, but have, of course, visited many times, the various locations-The Bel Air, 45 Park Lane, and the Grande Dame, The Dorchester! I can't tell you how disappointed I am with the rooms-everything is so old, I'm not sure my Grand-mother would have liked it here!
The rooms need a complete redo and overhaul-everything is old and not charming. I've received very mediocre service, so far-I'm very unimpressed! The public areas are beautiful-bar, restaurant, lobby, hallways. But once you get inside a room, it's kind of a dump! I'm very disappointed with the quality of the rooms at this hotel. That's why I say-don't bother to stay; just visit!",3,2012,05,21
130,Never miss its afternoon tea at the Promenade,"It was very unfortunate that our itinerary in Europe allowed only a night stay in this hotel in the heart of London, however, a day was long enough to become one of the hotel supporters by its ‘grace and comfort’. In addition, the friendliness felt at the reception was unforgettable.

Although the Hyde Park side rooms were fully booked, ours, superior queen room, with big windows still provided us with nice view of the landscaped terraces. Its very English floral pattern interiors and classy furniture met nicely with our expectation. We are sure that you will be pleased with the ‘real’ queen size bed and spacious marble stone bathroom with separate shower booth.
There were welcome fruits and green tea, may be for us, ready in the room. 

It is highly recommendable for you to reserve a table, when checking in, for the award-winning afternoon tea at the ‘Promenade’. Enjoying cups of tea there with live piano music should not be missed. Favors of tea and tastes of sandwiches and scorns were perfect, but it may need slight improvement upon tastes and way of serving for the mini-cakes. However the atmosphere is so ‘rich, warm and intimate’ that you can only experience in the Dorchester. 

We are sure that we will come back here again for longer stay.",5,2012,05,18
130,lost for words,We stayed for one night and I must admit when we arrived we were expecting nothing as goods as the savoy where we normally stay. But the place is so much more relaxing and friendly and the promenade is probably the best breakfast experience I have ever had. Only downside would be the prices as some a little kick in the teeth and also we felt really uncomfortable at the cocktail bar at the end of the promoenade as a lovely couple turned up (1 was blind !!) and as they were not dressed as well as other folk the bartender really turned his nose up and made a point that this bar is £20 for non guest min spend. I really do hope the management read this as the lady was a guest of your hotel and had to find her key which really made her feel very embarrased including me I these are the basics in service and that is why I mark you down 2 stars. Staff at such a nice hotel should never judge clients whatever they are dressed like in my opinion. She was even blind with a stick my busienss would be closed if I judged every phone call and meeting!!. Overall though this is just one member of staff and I would seriously recommend and will be staying again very soon. Oh and finally I would recommend seeing the live music near the cocktail bar as this was just sublime and they even mentioned my wifes name in the songs after I tipped them.,5,2012,05,14
130,fantastic,"The hotel is amazing the service and friendliness of all the staff is exceptional. You are made to feel very welcome and nothing is too much trouble. You are treated like an old friend and all front desk staff and concierge seemed to know our names within an hour of arriving. Thank you, we will be back.",5,2012,05,13
130,Afternoon tea a sublime experience,"Staff very helpful from beginning to end. From service calls to check our booking, instructions when we got lost in Hyde park (it was a lovely day and we thought we would walk) and the  extremely courteous welcome when we arrived. The selection of teas was overwhelming but the advice from the waiter was spot on. Infact everything was sublime from the champagne to the finger sandwiches made from diifferent breads with subtle but delicious fillings, which were replenished as needed. Then our selected tea (at the required strength was bought to to the table and poured (after brewing). It was quite simply the best cup of tea I have even had, a first flush darjeeling,it was refreshing and light, so much so that my companion and I drank 2 pots each We had a raspberry vanilla panacotta palate cleanser and then came  warmed scones, plain and fruited, with homemade strawberry and rhubarb and angelica jams with clotted cream. This was followed by fine french pastries, the lemon and mango, macaroon and the strawberry and pistachio cream tarts were to die for. We stayed the whole 2 hours of our siiting. Listened to the pianist and sipped in the whole ambiance. When it came to leave we had cakes left and the waiter put them in a box for us to carry home. If you like good service, delicious food and drink and a  sumptious environment then this is the place for you.Service charge is added to your bill and you need to book, they like you out when the 2 hours are up but some only give you an hour and half so quite reasonable. The dress code is relaxed no jeans etc but not too formal.  This was bought for a special birthday treat but would hope to return soon to relive the experience. Gave us excellent instructions at front desk to find tube and 2 maps. Can't rate the whole experience highly enough.",5,2012,05,13
130,Dinner the best I have had,We came for dinner and I have to say it was a very enjoyable few hours. The food was excellent and the waiters really made us feel special. The service was impeccable and the recommendations for the options were spot on. Often in some of the high end establishments you get the feeling the service is false but here the waiters were fun and we could share a joke or to with them. We will definately be back and see about staying at the hotel also.,5,2012,05,13
130,Rooms and service = top standard,"The stay begins with an extremely nice welcome.  Professional and cordial.  Receptionist escorted me to the room. Showed everything.  

Room: fruit plate with mandarins, peach etc was waiting in the room. Also pack of Dorchester chocolates. Beautifully decorated room in not too bright colors. Bose music system. Bang and olufsen tv. Queen size room was not large ca 25 sqmr but very comfortable.  Impeccably clean. Bathroom with shower. 

Hotel: Corridor and its carpet beautiful. 

Lobby: was a bit too crowded so was not easy to find place.  Service at reception and in restaurants very  friendly and efficient.  

Breakfast: only a la-carte so there was some wait.  Would be more efficient to have buffet but I guess they are like Ritz prefer to serve their customers.

130,Lovley hotel,Great service enjoyed myself and it was my birthday and they acknowledged that which was nice.Spa nice and three different dining experiences. Only issue was that on booking they failed to tell me that I needed to give them a four hundred pound holding fee two hundred per day!!!!,5,2012,05,11
130,anniversary holiday at the dorchester,"just returned from the dorchester hotel where we spent 4 wonderful days. the hotel is truly beautiful as are the rooms. the promenade and lobby are magnificent.our english breakfasts and afternoon tea were outstanding.the location of the hotel was literally minutes from everywhere we wanted to go.
as for the staff- every concierge was wonderful,including the 2 pauls,stuart,harry,andy, and george. they helped us so much in procuring for us difficult dinner and lunch reservations and all were so knowledgable in giving us advice on shopping and sightseeing.i must also commend the most charming joe mcbean-the theater desk manager- who was able to get us the best seats at the 2 shows we wished to see.also, joanna, in guest relations, made sure we had a beautiful room.
all in all, it was a spectacular trip. we had previouslly stayed at the claridge's and the lanesborough hotels and the dorchester is definitely a step above. we cannot wait to return.

130,Fantastic conference venue,"My company held an exclusive business conference with a small group of 18 people at the Dorchester.  The meeting was held in both the Penthouse and Pavilion rooms to include lunch and evening drinks.  The service we received were outstanding from start to finish. The staff awaited us and all our guests by the lifts and escorted us to the Penthouse suite where we were given welcome drinks as we enjoyed the fantastic view from the terrace.  Our three-course lunch in the Pavilion was superb, the set-up conducive to conversation and networking.  We didn't encounter any technical difficulties or glitches and the meeting concluded smoothly and successfully.  During our evening drinks, we were served ample snacks that would easily be considered a separate meal itself.   The Dorchester's reputation is undisputed and we will certainly consider it again as a venue for future meetings.",5,2012,05,07
130,"Luxury, Service & Style","A stay at the Dorchester is a real treat.  Have had this luxury twice now and both times an excellent experience.  Very helpful concierge, desk staff and beautiful room.
The breakfast is wonderful, generous, tasty and a great selection with great service.
This is one of the most comfortable sleeps I have had in a hotel.",5,2012,05,07
130,Perfect Location,"Great Rooms, Fabulous service, Amazing Restaurant.",5,2012,05,05
130,True luxury in all respects,"This is probably the best overall hotel I have ever stayed in. To give context, I am a frequent traveler, having stayed at several 5* properties throughout Europe and rest of the world.  From the moment we arrived to checkout, everything about this hotel exhudes and embodies the feel of luxury.  We were upgraded to a junior suite which was a great bonus. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the room was very modern, and very well furnished.  From looking at photos on TripAdvisor, it appeared that many of the rooms had very dated floral patterns, and looked a bit old fashioned.  That wasn't the case in the room we received.  It was very spacious with a large living room area, as well as a great bedroom space.  We also had afternoon tea here, which was a great experience, though it can be a bit pricey. The hotel itself is in a convenient location, being only a stone's throw away from Shepherd Market, so there are a number of pubs and restaurants nearby. It is, however, a bit farther away from the Mayfair area if one is looking for a bit more lively nightlife and shopping. The only downside of this property is the price, but you get what you pay for. It is a bit expensive, but that is expected when dealing with this level of service and the amenities provided. I would highly recommend The Dorchester to anyone looking for a luxury stay in London.",5,2012,05,01
130,You get what you pay for,"Great service, rooms and food, would book again without a doubt",4,2012,04,28
130,5* EXCELLENT SERVICE,"As expected the Dorchester lives up to its reputation, excellent staff, service and food and confortable rooms.",5,2012,04,27
130,Fantastic hotel and service,Thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay. Beautiful hotel with discreet excellent service. We'll be back.,5,2012,04,25
130,Afternoon tea and overnight stay,"Fabulous! Would recommend to anyone with deep pockets. Attention to detail was first class, no complaints at all. If you have the money, enjoy!",5,2012,04,25
130,Great Experience,"I like the feel of this place, obviously high standard, but it is not stuffy or impersonal.
Arrived by taxi and showed to reception by the doorman. Reception very clear, precise and welcoming.
The room was very good, had a warm feeling to it, a room you felt comfortable in. They had put a small bed at the bottom of ours for our young boy, which was just fine.
The appeal to me in the Dorchester is the public areas. We visited the bar which was superb, then later the main seating area, which again was very appealing and you were happy to just sit there and be waited on.
I must admit, I had drank too much champagne during the evening, but you just felt really comfortable here and the staff are just outstanding. 
Its hard to put your finger on it, but it just feels special, not stuffy, everyone appears happy and you just feel great here in everyway.
I have stopped in a few similar places, but they can be void of personality. This isn't, it just feels fantastic.
The bad news is it costs a fortune. Everything you have is expensive, so you need to accept that before you go, else it could cause you a little niggle. Luckily I wasn't for bothering about it, I went to enjoy it at any cost and it was absolutely amazing.
Breakfast was great too, service the best ever and I never normally get worked up about a hotel breakfast. My partner and our young son loved it too.
This is very special. Some can charge the earth, but they cannot offer an atmosphere like The Dorchester.
We will be back for sure, it was memorable.",5,2012,04,25
130,Wow.,"Having stayed in a good many of the worlds top hotels, I can safely say that Elizabeth Taylor had excellent taste. This was a glamorous and oh so over the top (but in a subtle way) experience, we had 3 suites booked after eating at the Table Lumiere at Alain Ducasse, and the whole experience was smooth, fluid, and totally delectable. The whole weekend for us just oozed opulence and understated good living. The suites were beautiful, full of light, and plenty of well thought out amenities, we can usually find minor fault with this type of hotel, but The Dorchester left nothing out. Eager to return as soon as possible.",5,2012,04,23
130,Nice hotel,"In march I visited England and stayed two nights in this hotel. It was nice...btw  nothing extra special but the stuff was very hepful, nice and profesional. Food was also very nice and i like this hotel.",4,2012,04,21
130,Truly exceptional,"We travelled as a family for 2 nights in Easter Week (sharing a room with our 10 year old). The room was outstanding and our son loved the room service dinners and the staff who absolutely spoilt him. The room was plenty big enough for the three of us and we loved the decor, the only snag was a broken hair dryer but I mention this to highlight the excellent service as this was replaced within 5 minutes and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The spa is stunning and I wish that I had discovered it sooner as I did not have time for a treat. The bar and cocktails were some of the nicest I have ever had (second only to The Queen Mary 2 my husband disputes this, so I sense a replay soon). The staff throughout the Dorchester were spectacular from the moment we arrived at the door to the moment when we left, right up to closing the car door! That's service! Juan in the promenade bar deserves a mention for his kindness and professionalism. We have only 2 negative comments, firstly there were groups of single men and women gathered in the promenade bar on weekday evenings, perhaps we were sensitive but it had a slightly uncomfortable feel about it and some of the behaviour was creepy. Secondly, The Grill was exquisite at both dinner and breakfast, again the only slight niggle (and we were not looking for any) was one member of staff who was brisk with us on both evenings, and the wine service was a bit hit and miss, just a shame really as the rest of the staff went beyond the call of duty at all times. On a final note, the gift shop is superb both for service and gifts and so much less crowded than Harrods! The issues raised have not stopped us from recommending this as a family hotel and we are planning to return with friends in July, but for 3 nights this time! This is a truly lovely hotel, chic, clean and mostly exceptional.",5,2012,04,19
130,The Dorchester delivers,"This was Liz Taylor's favorite hotel, and one can see why: it's luxurious, glamorous and just over-the-top enough. The public spaces are superb: both tasteful and bold, and on a scale that lets you know you are in a grand hotel. Not for The Dorchester a muted palette of earth tones, rather a rainbow of colors and a well-mannered riot of pattern. The bedrooms are supremely comfortable and furnished as if one were staying in an English country house. Pillows for every taste and sheets as smooth as silk. A very attentive staff and a warm welcome. And if you can snag one of the special offers, such as the weekend rate with a sumptuous breakfast included, you'll really feel it's worth every penny, shilling and pound!",5,2012,04,18
130,Great Place to stay,"Me and my partner stayed here for a romantic break after a theatre night out, I booked it well early in advance.

Great room, am only used to B&B and hotels at a much lower price tag so was very happy with the room and breakfast that was brought to our room the next morning.

5*****",4,2012,04,17
130,Everything you would expect from this great hotel,"Return visitor. Completely met and exceeded our expectations! Great location at the top of Hyde Park, close to the many sights in London. Outstanding staff and room. Excellent full English breakfast.  Well equipped fitness center. Loved the steam room.
The only complaint is the outrageous fee for Internet - 19.5 pounds sterling PER DAY! No need for this classy a place to have this high fee with essentially no cost - come on Sultan  - fix this irritation!!!",5,2012,04,11
130,Wonderful!,"We have just returned from The Dorchester and it was wonderful. From the moment we drove to the door, to the moment we left the service was impeccable. We have been lucky enough to say at some lovely hotels but this is probably the best. The staff have a way of making you feel that you are the only person they are attending to, all wrapped up in a warm & friendly package and it is certainly not snobbish. Breakfast in the promenade was a special experience and something I would highly recommend. We opted for a superior double room and it was just the right size.  I wouldn't want to go any smaller really.  The room had a lovely homely feel to it and it was very easy to settle right in..

My only gripe is that they charge you £19.50 for wifi access per day which I think is bad seeing as most hotels give it for free. Other than that, it was superb!",5,2012,04,09
130,Old style luxury,"We are just back from a two night stay,back to reality!Its a fabulous hotel with old style luxury.We stayed there with our kids and they loved it,the bath was so deep that they hid in it!The beds and pillows are the best I've ever slept on.George,the concierge, is such a gent no matter what the problem he seemed to have the solution.Hopefully we'll return some day...",5,2012,04,03
130,Unforgettable High Tea Experience,"I recently took my mother and brother to the Dorchester for tea. We all wanted a stellar experience and found it at the Dorchester hands down. Not only do they make you feel special, it's just a lovely presentation with delicious food. Helen our Tea Hostess was just perfection, from her skilled manner to her comments she made it come alive. We settled on the 80 year old Dorchester blend and loved it. Charlotte Martin, my contact at the Dorchester was such a gregarious and entertaining beautiful lady. We had such a great time sharing travel stories, Charlotte was most gracious and accomodating. After my two glasses of champagne to begin with I was ready for anything !
It was such a lovely time I highly recommend High Tea at the Dorchester for anyone seeking an unforgettable time.

130,"Luxurious hotel, a real treat.","A wonderful hotel, staff very polite, professional, and not snobbish like some staff in hotels we have stayed at, they  couldn't do enough for u? Our room was spotless, and quiet. Champaign, cake and chocolates complimentary in our room. Bed and pillows very comfortable. We had cocktails in the bar which were lovely, and breakfast was great.",5,2012,04,02
130,A tea-time to remember,"Afternoon tea at the Dorchester is a great experience.  The restaurant, the staff, the atmosphere and the food are all excellent - you are made to feel very special.  Last year we had tea at the Dorchester, this year at the Ritz, (both visits were Christmas presents) and the Dorchester knocked the Ritz into a cocked hat.  Both serve wonderful food and plenty of it, but the cakes at the Dorchester were to die for.  We were shown to seats while we waited for our table to be prepared and the staff couldn't do enough for us, appearing every few minutes to pour out more tea, or to refresh the pot.  We loved it.",5,2012,03,27
130,First Class!,"We have stayed at The Dorchester on many occasions since 2008 and every visit has been exceptional. 

We have tried other Luxury London hotels but always come back here.

For a truly luxurious experience you can't do better.

Enjoy breakfast in your room, rather than the Promenade or Grill, it will arrive on a trolly table with fabulous china and gets your day off to a great start.

Some of the superior rooms (cheapest) are a little small but still lovely and unless you prefer a bath, request a walk in shower as not all rooms have them!

Enjoy your stay.",5,2012,03,26
130,Top class hotel,"We have stayed at the Dorchester numerous times, however I have only been contributing to tripadvisor for 18 months or so. We have always found the hotel to provide a top class experience, if anything I think the standard has improved, the staff are very friendly, efficient and pleasant. The rooms and beds are very comfortable indeed.The only negative on this occasion was the noise of a band until past 1 am on Friday night,, we usually have a deluxe room but this time had a lower grade superior room with interior roof view, I don't know whether this is why we had trouble with the noise, the deluxe rooms overlook Hyde Park. In any case it kept my wife awake ( I wore ear plugs and consumed plenty of alcohol). We have stayed numerous times at other hotels in London. The Ritz - a beautiful palace hotel with gorgeous large bathrooms, the Lanesborough - an old fashioned elegant hotel with butler service, Claridges - a beautiful elegant art deco hotel with a wonderful atmosphere, the Savoy which has recently had a fantastic high quality make over.  I would recommend all of these hotels to anyone looking for a top class hotel in London but our overall favourite is the Dorchester, hopefully we will return in the not too distant future if we can raise the extra cash for a deluxe room.",5,2012,03,22
130,Fantastic Experience,"Our first stay at The Dorchester, very impressive lovely room, comfortable bed with gorgeous pillows. Superb bathroom with fantastic shower.
All staff very attentive, would certainly visit again",5,2012,03,21
130,English elegance,"Having had the wonderful afternoon tea at the Dorchester many times, my husband and I decided to stay for the night as we were at a concert at the royal Albert hall.
The staff are always welcoming polite and friendly.
Our room wasn't ready but we had a quick complimentary coffee before we were taken to our room 10 minutes later.
Unfortunately the room I had booked was far too small and without any hesitation we were upgraded to a beautiful room with a far bigger bed!
The room wasn't huge but was beautifully decorated in traditional English style and the bed was big which is always a must as ours is at home!
The bathrooms are large and old fashioned but have beautiful toiletries in lovely large tubes and bottles.
We ate in the promenade restaurant after the concert at about 11pm and it was still buzzing. The food is always gorgeous and beautifully presented.
The bill was pleasantly not a shock and I would stay again if going to the Albert hall although probably stay nearer the west end if going to a show.
",5,2012,03,20
130,Old School Excellence,"The Dorchester lived up to its impeccable reputation last weekend when I treated my partner to a romantic getaway! We were certainly impressed by the flawless room, public area and fantastic service!
 
We dined at the Grill both nights where the food was obviously a product of carefully selected ingredients and hours of hard work resulting in nothing less than perfection. The original plan was to try a different restaurant each night, but we were so taken with Brian Hughson’s menu we couldn’t help but be drawn back in for a second night! The Service was also a huge credit to the restaurant and hotel, in particular Jack and Jose who were there on both evenings. At the end of one of the meals Jose distracted my Partner while Jack slipped a red rose into my hand and whispered give it to her outside. A lovely touch at the end of a lovely evening!
 
Breakfast in the promenade was wonderful; we were served by a very friendly Karin who was happy to give advice on what to do in the area! The promenade was immaculately kept and adorned with the most exquisite bouquets of flower arrangements and the polished interior gleamed in the morning light.
 
The reception and concierge were very professional and were able to answer questions and had advice on travelling around the City.
 
A fantastic Two days!",5,2012,03,19
130,Wonderful,My girlfriend and I had high tea here and it was a wonderful experience during our overseas travels. The food and hotel were amazing. We weren't hurried at all and were made to feel very special!! It's all now a wonderful memory!!,5,2012,03,07
130,Afternoon tea - superb!,We celebrated my mother-in- law's 70th birthday with afternoon tea. The food was fantastic and the service first class. They even gave her a birthday cake and boxed up those we couldn't eat to take home. The whole experience from booking to leaving was excellent - ending with meeting Lionel Ritchie in the hotel lobby!,5,2012,03,06
130,20 YEARS OF VISITS - ALWAYS **NUMBER ONE**,"We live in Hampshire and for the last twenty years or so have come up to town about once a month - we always drop into The Dorchester during the day, generally to the Bar for a drink, maybe a bite to eat - I suppose it's become a bit of a ritual but our day would not be complete otherwise. Since that first visit all those years ago, we return I guess in the same way as one drops in to see an old friend. Yes - the surroundings are beautiful, the atmosphere relaxing, the quality of the food & drink consistently excellent but it's the 'people' that make the place.  I hesitate to use the word 'staff' - everyone who works there is obviously very proud to represent the hotel - they feel special and that in turn results in us, the guests, being made to feel very special indeed.
So......why have I decided to write a review after all these years ?  Well simply because we had a VERY SPECIAL day last Wednesday 29th February and The Dorchester played a small but very big part of that day.  We got married !!!  No fuss after 20 odd years together - a day in London, quick ceremony at Chelsea Register Office (just the two of us plus a couple of suprised witnesses dragged out of the pub next door !!), a show in the evening and back to work the next day ! BUT...no visit to London would be complete without our aforementioned time at The Dorchester so for once (and I believe for the first time) I thought I'd better book especially as we would be turning up at around 3pm in the afternoon which can be very busy.  From the time our booking was reconfirmed the day before by Jennifer in The Promenade, I am sure the Dorchester's hospitality wheels must have been set in motion !
We were made to feel so special that day, from the moment the Doorman greeted us personally from our cab, the bonhomie in the bar with the barman and fellow hotel guests over a bottle of Champagne.  A divine Lobster Salad, continual 'Congratulations' throughout the afternoon from everyone and a divine 'Just Married' dessert from the Chef brought to the table to the sounds of the Pianist playing 'our' music and a round of applause from everyone.
What more can I say - 20 years of visits and still No.1 ! 
Thank you to everyone at The Dorchester and we'll see you in a month or so !!",5,2012,03,04
130,The perfect hotel for a special occassion,"Having being lucky enough to have stayed here before, my wife and I chose the Dorchester as the hotel to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary - and we were so glad we did.  This hotel just knows how to make you feel special.  We were greeted like friends by the hotel doormen, greeted with 'welcome back' by the reception staff (even though it was 3 years ago since we last stayed there) and we were given a fabulous room including complimentary champagne.  Every member of staff is just so friendly, the decor is stunning and the food and drink is of the highest quality.  We had our 1st lunch in the Promenade Bar, our 2nd lunch in the superb Alain Ducasse restaurant (I've written a separate review on this), had in-room dining on our last evening and had 2 wonderful breakfasts in the Grill restaurant.  We thoroughly enjoyed every meal.   If you can afford to, I strongly recommend you experience this hotel at least once in your life.",5,2012,03,01
130,Afternoon Tea,"I was taken to the Dorchester by my daughter for Afternoon Tea on 25 February, there were six in the party and we were told our table was not quite ready and would we accept a complimentary glass of champagne, what a hardship!  We were only waiting for 5 minutes then shown to our table and served with the most wonderful array of sandwiches, the breads were delicious, scones, pastries etc.  The staff were all outstanding, especially Shyam, our waiter who was delightful.  Fantastic experience.",5,2012,02,26
130,Afternoon Tea,"After our wonderful experience last year for my sister's 60th Birthday, we booked again without hesitation to celebrate my wife's 50th (on 25th Feb).  Given that we were taking our (teenage) children I spoke twice to the hotel regarding the fact that neither of the children drank tea or coffee so was it possible to substitute the tea/coffee for a soft drink.  No problem - soft drinks could be substituted.  As such my son had 7-up and my daugther a fruit cocktail.  Great.  Until the drinks were shown as extra on the bill!  Not wishing to be churlish I did not query the bill as I did not want to spoil the day - but it did mean that our childrens tea was the more expensive than the adult tea £ 38.50 + ca £10 each for drinks ( 7-up at £5 percan x2 and the cocktail £9.50).  I think that occassion had the edge knocked off it due to children's drinks ( I was happy to pay for extra drinks, but what about the subsitute drink!?) .   Nowithstanding the foregoing comments, we had a wonderful time - service was impeccable, lots of doggie bags, birthday cake etc.  We will be back, but hopefully the kids will be drinking tea by then!!!",4,2012,02,26
130,poping in for one night,"I stayed in the dorchesr for a night with my mum and dad and it was an excellent experience. they treat you really well, and you feel like your at home. the rooms are a very high standed and a vary of prices of what kind of room you want.",5,2012,02,23
130,Superb,It was a great experience. The room was very clean and spacious. The service was amazing. The breakfast was excellent.,5,2012,02,19
130,truely amazing,"The most beautifull food in london without a doubt , staff were very helpfull and knowledgeable .Would recomend the Dorchester to anybody who wants a nice treat",5,2012,02,19
130,"Cocktails, delicious but little atmosphere",As part of my mums visits to see me in London we've been trying afternoon tea and cocktails at various hotels. This time we decided that cocktails at the dorchester were in order. Whilst the hotel is lovely it can lookma little more tired than some of it's counterparts and is more understated. The bar I would say is too modern and doesn't fit in with the atmosphere of the hotel. The barmen were friendly and the cocktails were delicious if quite small for the price however there is no getting away from the lack of atmosphere that you get at other bars such as the bar at the Savoy.,3,2012,02,17
130,Just fabulous,"Stayed here just before Christmas, what a fantastic hotel, wonderful service, beautiful room, its really classy but without that stuffiness so many of the top class hotels have. A stones throw from Oxford street, 10min easy walk, Can,t recommend this place highly enough.",5,2012,02,13
130,Traditional English comfort in the heart of Mayfair,"We just returned from a seven night stay at this wonderful hotel and loved every minute of it.  From the time you enter the Art Deco styled lobby, to checking in with the warm and friendly staff (one of whom then accompanies you up to your room), this is a fantastic experience at one of the world's best hotels.  For 80 years, this hotel has been catering to the most demanding guests, and they know what they are doing!
The rooms are done in an English country manor style,  are large by London standards, and the marble bathroom enormous (complete with a heated towel rack).  The location is right across the street from Hyde Park and is close to the restaurants in Shepards Market and the shops in Knightsbridge.  Overall, a great experience.",5,2012,02,10
130,spendid,"After attending a conference I was delighted to be shown to a spacious well equipped room with a fabulous view over the park. I felt very welcome and staff were always helpful and informative.
Food at the evening function was excellent.",5,2012,02,08
130,special place in our heart,"I have reviewed five hotels now and will continue to review more but this hotel is without doubt our favourite and will always hold a special place in our hearts. In May 2010 my wife and I had our wedding reception here and have since stayed six further times and on each occasion have not been disappointed, not including the numerous visits to their bar for cocktails :-)

The other hotels we have reviewed are all 5 star rated hotel but this hotel is the only one with the 'wow' factor.

Other hotels could learn a lot from the Dorchester's level of service alone.",5,2012,02,04
130,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"I have spent 2 nights at the Dorchester, and the room, service and food is just amazing.

The bar is great and service very professional the waitress was very friendly and the Caesar Salad one of the best in town

Room was very cozy with beautiful view on Hyde Park",5,2012,01,30
130,Good value and good sized rooms,"Excellent service from the word go. On arrival our car was driven away and parked and a speedy check in followed by an escort to the room and an explanation of the services.Really good sized room but bewarned that they have the DEEPEST baths and you really need a good step up to get in!! Excellent afternoon tea, not stuffy.Great bar to meet friends and relax.Good, free biz centre. Nice breakfast.
Only gripe, I requested a high floor which they achknowledged at check in and toook us to the 3rd floor.....out of 7!!!! Couldn't be bothered to say anything as we needed to go out.
I would stay again.",5,2012,01,27
130,Treat yourself - it's worth it,"Although expensive, the service and quality of food are worth it for a treat. The beds were so comfortable we considered staying in instead of the night we had planned. Great location, right on Hyde Park, but no road noise, so, best of both worlds. Breakfast was fabulous, and was brought to the room within 20 minutes of ordering, quicker than the queue for coffee in the take away deli!!!",4,2012,01,27

130,A well oiled machine which keeps producing the goods,"The Dorchester never fails to disappoint. Nothing is too much trouble. They seem to pride themselves in going that one stage further and offering that personal service. I find it hard to fault in any department and it just works like a well oiled machine. 
If you are after this class of hotel, then the Dorchester would be a good choice.",5,2012,01,22
130,Impeccable,"Everything during our stay, 13-17 Jan 2012, was handled impeccably by The Dorchester staff; from our early morning check-in to check out. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was deliciously comfortable, and room service breakfasts simple delicious. Afternoon tea on The Promenade is several cuts above any other we´ve experienced in London, and in a setting that´s simply sumptuous.",5,2012,01,20
130,Our Stay at the Dorchester,"Having stayed at the Dorchester many times over the years we never tire of pulling up in front of this majestic hotel.Truly one of the worlds greatest.The rooms are superb & comfortable.The service is first class 24 hours a day & the restaurants are excellent.
If you are visiting London but cannot afford the Dorchester at least book afternoon tea a couple or 3 weeks ahead it is so elegant & tasty.
The best afternoon tea in a stunning setting in one of the greatest hotels in one of the greatest Cities in the world.",5,2012,01,19
130,"Awesome Bathroom, great location, Superb service","Unfortunately my review is a bit old, as I stayed here a couple of months ago, but I have to comment on this great hotel.
I am a ""bathroom-person"", so if you like beautiful spotless bathrooms, with soft towels and a range of excellent toiletries, this is the place to go!  Usually hotel-shampoo are really un-usable, but let me assure you that you can actually use all the products in the bathroom!

Although not the way I will decorate my house, or my style at all, the room was beautifully done with a very comfortable pillow.

The breakfast was really good. Felt like having breakfast the whole day :)

If you can in any way.. stay here, you won't regret it!",5,2012,01,19
130,A classic that only gets better!,From the stunning lobby to the beautiful rooms--the Dorchester gets better with every visit.  The service is amazing--the staff charming and engaging and the restaurants were superb.  Everything about the hotel is first rate and we felt pampered every moment of our seven day stay.   The Executive King room--overlooking Hyde park was beautiful and breakfast in the Promenade every morning was the ultimate luxury!   The concierge staff were outstanding as well.,5,2012,01,19
130,great hotel,"i stayed here for my birthday and had a great night in the bar , expensive but very chic , beautiful art deco rooms and full of stars.",5,2012,01,17
130,Impeccable,"I stay for 8 nigths at The dorchester during the cristhimas period and I can say only good words about it. Since the moment we arrive we were treat like royals. They gave us a up grade, so our room was fantastic, evean I can say was huge. The service works like a swiss watch. The food was very good. 
Defenitely I stay there again.",5,2012,01,16
130,Fabulous Room and a Benchmark for other hotels,"We had a fabulous room with a Queen sized bed,It felt like pure luxury,and every thing was provided from a great selection of soaps,lotions and cream to dressing gowns ,slippers, shoecare,treats on arrival to a bottle of water each and Dorchester candies.Well stocked fridge with varied selection of drinks or champagne,or snacks.(n.b.chargeable)Overall very impressive,and if you can stretch to the cost at least spend one night here.",5,2012,01,15
130,Dependable Perfection,"You expect 5 Star hotels to be perfect but few are.  The Dorchester must have a world class training for its staff. Everyone gives you the impression that they want to make your experience  memorable in a good way.  The public and private rooms are elegantly designed and decorated in that English country house way that makes comfort as important as style.  The bedrooms are unusually large for a prime location London hotel. Impeccably maintained, the staff does the daily make up quickly and unobtrusively.  The two restaurants that we tried were both excellent.  Unfortunately the vaunted Alain Ducasse was closed for winter break.  The fitness center, spa and business center are frusta rate.  The hotel's rack rates but high but when comparing them with other lesser known and completely unknown hotels which charge as much, the Dorchester can offer surprising value.  The reason we chose to stay here was the uniformly outstanding reviews it gets on all the web sites we checked.  Other 5 star hotel get variable ratings but the Dorchester seems to please all its guests and our thinking was, why take a chance when here we have a sure thing.",5,2012,01,14
130,simply superb..,"Service was excellent and faultless. I had such a lovely time and you were made to feel special. (But you are paying a premium) I would defo stay here again..
The room I had was lovely and eating in the hotel was a pleasure.. excellent location for shopping.",5,2012,01,11
130,Old & still a bit comfortable,"Historic? Absolutely. Outdated in many ways? Yes. 

Yet, it felt like I'd come home once in the room. Not sure about 5-star (see also old fashioned decor and London-esque, odd flooring under carpet) but the staff was great. The bathroom, especially the towels,  was wonderful. Location next to Hyde Park and close to Buckingham Palace was great and, although I didn't make it, farmer's market in Marleybone near as well. A couple of tube stops close by for easy access to the rest of London. I was able to get a good  rate since it was the first week of the year but that may not be the case year-round. Options for dining locally diminish rapidly from breakfast to dinner but then it is London.",4,2012,01,10
130,Just Fantastic - Lovely 40th!,"I spent 2 nights here for my 40th and it was fantastic.  Staff are all really lovely, the suite we had was excellent, on the 8th Floor, so a real treat, where all the extra special suites are.  We only ate breakfast here, as we were always busy in the evening, we also had Christmas lunch on The Orient Express, which is a must for a Special Occassion also.  When we got to our room, there was cards in our room wishing me Happy 40th, then they delivered a Birthday Cake to our room from The Dorchester!  The breakfast selection was great as well and so was the food.  I only have one negative comment, I have stayed in many 5 Star Hotels in this Country and also around the World and they have all provided tea/coffee making facilities to make in the room.  Other 5 Star Hotels have hidden them in a decorated box so not to be seen.  A great hotel, will go back again for sure.",5,2011,12,27
130,Honeymoon at the dorchester,What a fantastic time we had staying at the Dorchester for our honeymoon earlier this week. The staff went out of their way to make the stay really special for us. The hotel is stunning and our breakfast in the Grill was just perfect.I really can't wait to stay here again next time we come to London.,5,2011,12,22
130,"Top class staff, everything else is good too!","Of course the Dorchester offers a magnificent experience (at a price)! From start to finish, the real stars of the whole thing were the fantastically well trained and friendly staff. Management must be very proud of the sunny outlook and professionalism of the Dorchester team.

If being picky I would say that the hotel itself - the rooms especially - are a little dated. I can imagine the excuse for not modernising being a ""need to keep the character"" but some of the fittings in our room were long past being old and ""charming"" (desk light for example). That's a minor criticism and standards and space were generally excellent.

Breakfast was nothing short of sumptuous and delivered with precision and a certain quality of service that you don't often experience. All the food was beautifully prepared.

I have to thoroughly recommend the Dorchester but couldn't argue with the view that it is pretty expensive and not perfectly placed if you are looking for more than Mayfair activities!",5,2011,12,21
130,"No charm, no class, a nightmare","It is so sad when you visit an old rich, aristocratic friend who is now struggling to keep the air of class and dignity.  The Hotel is packed with Russians and Middle eastern  and is for those kind of new money bearers that the staff is focused to render their services.  That explains why everything is over offered and over rated as well.  For instance:  I was appalled when keeping a Non Disturb sign hanging at my door a cleaning lady knocked to see “if everything was fine”.  When I lived in London, many years ago, I always dreamed in staying by The Dorchester, for its class, location and atmosphere.    The dream turned to be a nightmare.  Never have I felt so bad treated in my life.  More than that, I felt like Woody Woodpecker when any predator look at him like roasted chicken turning over the fire.  The young men of the Concierge are a case apart.  They were quite rude, impolite, useless and not at all attentive, since everything they could offer seemed to be a form to take the highest value from the Hotel guests pockets.  For instance, transportation to Heathrow Airport was 148 POUNDS!!   And they said that as the best value for money.  If you dare to say transportation could range from 45 (in Mini-Cabs) to 70 (in London´s  Black Taxis) they would give you that kind of look that a seller of a shop in Rodeo Drive  once gave to Julia Roberts in the movie Lady in Red.  Nevertheless they are probably from low English working class or from eastern countries drowning in the lack of employment of the European crisis, they behave like they are better than their guests.  Perhaps because the big tips comes from Russians and middle eastern as mentioned, people from other nationalities and countries were completely ignored.  You pay much and get low.  There are many other Hotels in that area.  Don’t be fooled, your old aristocratic rich  friend is now running a different kind of job, not pleasant, not classy, but expensive.",1,2011,12,21
130,just divine,"Our stay at this hotel was the start of a wonderful holiday in London and then travelling on the Orient Express to Venice. For pure luxury this was our hotel of choice and it exceeded all our expectations.  We booked a superior room which was quite large and had all the comforts we could of hoped for. The linen and pillows were just heaven. We chose to dine in the Scottish restaurant for dinner and again for breakfast. We were very impressed with the quality of produce sourced. Our meals were beautifully presented and tasted ""out of this world"". A real must when visiting this hotel is ""the bar"". Very good service and wonderful atmosphere. All the staff were professional and very helpful.

We really can't wait for next visit to this world famous hotel.",5,2011,12,18
130,Another Exceptional Experience,"This was our second 2 night stay at this fabulous  hotel and as i had previously omitted to  write a review i thought it was only fair that i did so on this occasion.
The hotel is perfectly situated to explore all the main areas of London , all the staff from the doormen , receptionist and cleaners all seem to want to make your stay very memorable and are all proud to be working for such a prestigious organisation and i would like to thank them for making our stay so enjoyable.
I was fortunate that on our first visit around May 2010 we were able to experience a "" Behind the Scenes Tour "" taking in the Kitchens , Florist , Laundry , Carpentry and lots of other areas that make this hotel so slick in delivering an exceptional experience for all their guests , nothing is too much trouble for them.
This really is a hotel that makes you feel very special , the floral displays have to be seen to be appreciated , the breakfasts are without doubt the best that i have ever had anywhere , in a fantastic setting 
As you can probably guess , i would highly recommend this hotel as somewhere that ticks all the boxes , and yet retains that Traditional British feel , well done to everyone",5,2011,12,14
130,afternoon tea treat.........a must!!!,we really enjoyed our afternoon tea at the dorchester and found it a fantastic experience. we were made very welcome and the staff were extremely professional. our sandwiches  and cakes were lovely and a great selection of teas etc. we had a drink in the bar while waiting for our table which was expensive but worth it just to feel the ambiance of this iconic hotel. staff seemed to enjoy working there and were very passionate about their roles i felt.,5,2011,12,12
130,"Wonderful afternoon tea experience, impeccable service and delightful food","My husband and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about our afternoon tea at The Dorchester.  We were visiting London for our honeymoon and I insisted that he take me to a tea and The Dorchester did not disappoint.  

The hotel itself is lovely to walk through; all of the staff were gracious,  accommodating, and very nice; and the food and tea were superb and plentiful!  I really feel that I need to emphasize that the staff were all so lovely and nice.  That is really something you don't see everywhere and I appreciate it very much.  

In terms of food, there were finger sandwiches (all delicious but the seafood was the best), scones with clotted cream and jam, and then mini desserts.  They even came around and kept offering us more of everything!  We could not eat another bite by the time we left!  Everything was very tasty and it was basically a full meal.  

We chose whatever their basic tea experience was (no champagne, etc.) but it was entirely delightful and we did not want for anything.  It was not an inexpensive visit, but it is certainly comparable in price to other higher end afternoon tea venues.  For what we experienced, we both feel it was entirely worth it.  

All in all, we HIGHLY recommend taking tea at The Dorchester!",5,2011,12,10
130,Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester,"I booked afternoon tea at The Dorchester as a 90th birthday treat for my grandmother.  The food, service, staff and whole experience was wonderful.

My grandmother had a wonderful and memorable afternoon with the staff presenting her with a birthday cake and Happy Birthday being played on the piano.

We were both made to feel special. The staff were attentive taking photographs of the occasion for my grandmother.  Nothing was to much trouble.

I would recommend The Dorchester for afternoon tea i thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",5,2011,12,08
130,Brilliant Hotel,"Had a Brilliant time at the hotel, really worth the money and also the restaurant Alain Duchassee was fantastic my best restaurant, great staff and not over bearing",5,2011,12,02
130,Amazing experience,"Stayed here just before Christmas 2010 and it was an amazing experience.  The room was fantastic and staff were first class.  There was nothing I could criticise, and it's not very often I write that in a review!  We are planning to make it an annual event so will be returning in a few weeks' time, can't wait!  My favourite hotel in the world is Dar al Masyaf in Dubai but this one comes an extremely close second (only the weather lets it down!)",5,2011,11,30
130,Worth the money.,"The staff go beyond their way to help you. They put candles in my scrambed egg for my birthday which I thought was very impressionable and something I shall remember. Rooms though I thought slightly outdated, others might call it traditional charm. The beds where comfy and the rooms cleaned flawlessly of couse.The bathrooms are amazing and the bath a great size! It's situated in a great location with taxis allways ready to take you where you need to go, and the oxford street-selfridges it was about £14. The dinners are so-so but the breakfasts are amaaazing! I would recomend this hotel to anyone.",4,2011,11,29
130,"My first review of the Dorchester detailed it needed improvement, no i can confirm everything is exemplary!","I am a huge fan of grandiose, old fashioned hotels such as the Dorchester, I have stayed here no less then 10 times, and felt it worthwhile to re-affirm The Dorchester's status as one of the worlds best hotels.
I love the levels of service, the pride that goes into every aspect of the hotel, i love the fact that i once arrived in a friends old heap of a car rather than my usual one off classic super car, and i was offered the same glowing welcome (it's the simple things in life eh?)
The rooms are always a delight, the cocktails are second to none, the room service is magnificent.
I had one bad trip to the Dorchester a couple of years ago, but now i feel they have stepped up their service levels to maintain their fantastic levels of service!!!

a huge well done to everyone at the hotel in their monumental levels of service.",5,2011,11,22
130,Worth every penny,"I am not in the habit of staying in such luxerious places, but through a combination of a special offer and a 50th birthday, the opportunity finally presented itself.

Was it worth it?

I must say that it was worth every penny. The luxury and relaxed charm was evident everywhere and unlike other grand London Hotels, everything was very bright and beautiful.

The staff were brilliant and there was a total lack of snobbery that made you feel very welcome no matter what your personal circumstances were.

Breakfast was faultless and the bed was the largest and the most comfortable that i have ever stayed in.

There was one very small criticism. Despite the price of the room, there is no complimentary tea/coffee facilities in the room. We had to fill our boots with extra tea at Breakfast.",5,2011,11,22
130,Afternoon Tea,"I took my daughter and friend to The Dorchester Hotel, London, for an Afternoon Tea as a treat for her 40th birthday. I must say, wow. It was lovely. We had a choice of four diff menus, from £34.50 each or  highter depending if you had Champagne with the tea. We did, just the one glass each, different sandwichs (with crust cut off of course), scones with jam and clotted cream, and an assortment of cakes, great. The icing on the cake was the pianist played Happy Birthday and the hotel supplied a small birthday cake on the house. A lovely experience had by all.",4,2011,11,22
130,Deserves it's reputation,"This was my first but not my last stay here; Check in was done by 2 male reception staff members; true professionals. Very polite and easy to talk with. The building is beautiful inside; high Art - Deco at its best. The room was lovely and the bathroom large and marbled. 
I could go on all night and bore you!!,  but all I can say is give this place a try; its worth the cost for the experience. True class",5,2011,11,21
130,Posh London Hotel,"The Dorchester is truly one of the poshest and most exclusive hotels in Central London. It has a very traditional feel as its been around for a while but is still very well kept and beautiful inside. The lobby area is spectacular and the interior truly gorgeous. The staff are very polite and helpful. This is one hotel where you are likely to rub shoulders with the Elite, Upper class and Celebrities of the world. Spotted George Clooney with his girlfriend hanging out with Topshop owner, Phillip Green! Stayed here for about four nights on a short trip to London and it was well worth the price. Always thought it would be more expensive as it has such a good reputation but got a pretty good deal. Had a great time going to the Bar downstairs in the Chinese restaurant every single day - a great place to let your hair down, have a drink and chill away from the 'uptight' Aristocratic feel of the rest of the hotel. Note this is not a 'party' hotel so if you are looking for that check out the W in Leicester Square or the Sanderson. However if you are looking for real 'upper class' treatment this is the place to be. It is definitely worth the stay. The location of the hotel is ideal, 2-5min taxi ride to Oxford Circus/Bond Street/Knightsbridge so perfect for shopping. The rooms are pretty traditional looking but didn't have a problem with it - it's spacious, clean, bathrooms clean, no faults. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and hope to stay here again sometime.",5,2011,11,15
130,Prestige all over,"This hotel is a classic well known luxury hotel, ideally located at parklane. Staff is kind and helpfull at check-in, although reserved and not over-fiendly. My room was located on the 4th floor, at the side- back of the building! The room was enjoyable of temperature, but the bathroom on the other hand was freezing cold. Nice healthy fruit attention next to the bed. I had a classic english room with a double door from my entrance door, which blocked all noise coming from the corridor. Although the windows are not sound proof, especially the one in the bathroom not. If you're planning a luxury quit bath, please be advised it will be one with car sound. I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and enjoyed it. I just would like to advise some male staff to put on their smile and greet guests with a simple goodmorning, good afternoon or good evening. I missed the extra touch in this hotel! ",4,2011,11,12
130,Pure luxury - love the lobby,"Great location for business and leisure. The lobby area has an excellent decor and ideal for short meetings. Rooms, service, breakfast - all fab !!",5,2011,11,10
130,beautiful hotel,"We have been to The Dorchester several times and love the hotel .
The Hotel is always bustling ,Usualy we have done bed with breakfast but on this last occasion we booked dinner in the Grill.
Breakfast is always spot on and more than adequate portions.
always very enjoyable .
We took Family with us who as first timers at the Dorchester thought it was marvelous.starters were good
However 3 of us were not too impressed with the main on this occasion,,mother in law had Lobster which came with a sort of Rissotto didnt look to apetising and left most of it at the side of her plate 2 had the taster menu and were impressed with thier meal Deserts were ok  but at Around£400.00 for 5 of us okay isnt quite good enough however i love The Dorchester and we will return but not for dinner .",5,2011,11,07
130,Our favourite place in the World,"We have been staying here for the past few years, and without doubt it is the best Hotel in the World. Perfect service, wonderful surroundings, such high standards in all aspects. If you want to stay in London and spoil yourself this is THE place to stay. Have stayed in all the other top Hotels in London and nothing compares to The Dorchester !",5,2011,11,07
130,A perfect afternoon,"Like many reviewers, we have enjoyed afternoon tea in various establishments but none meet the impeccable standards of the Dorchester. From the attentive, friendly and efficient service to the delicious treats, the whole afternoon left us with a warm glow which matched our surroundings. Imagine sinking into your most favourite comy sofa, a pianist skilfully playing at just the right volume, a gentle, smiling face offering you any tea of your choosing with delicate offerings of sandwiches, pastries and scones. Add to that, the joys of conversation with friends of some thirty years and you have a recipe for a perfect afternoon. The most skilful of service kept the pace moving so that we left in time for them to set up for the final sitting. Of course it would have been great to stay and linger but why deny others this delightful experience.",5,2011,11,05
130,Exceeding expectations,"Having read some of the negative reviews I cannot believe that I stayed in the same hotel. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi and the welcome we received, until we left, every member of staff was friendly, helpful and extremely professional. The suite we had was exceptional, room service could not have been better and we really appreciated the extra touches left in our room.
From the Champagne served in the Promenade to the cocktails in China Tangs and breakfast in The Grill - everything exceeded our expectations. The concierge and reception staff could not have been more helpful with special mention made of Alberto who made us feel so special.
Joe at the theatre ticket desk was just a star and completed the wonderful experience to perfection.
We booked lunch at Cut at 45 Park Lane on Joe's recommendation and yet again the experience was exceptional and cannot be praised highly enough. The reason we were making the trip to London was to experience some things on my ""Bucket List"" - things to do before I die (not that I intend to do in the near future)
We can say without doubt that The Dochester made this trip better than we could ever have hoped and can recommend it without reservation. Thank you so much.
Moira and Cathy",5,2011,11,05
130,Afternoon tea at the dorchester,A truely memorable afternoon tea at The Dorechester.  Luxury without arrogance. Very few places can be so luxurios yet also make you feel comfortable.,5,2011,11,04
130,My favourite place in the world!,"I have spend so many nights here and cant fault a single one.  At one point i was staying once or twice a week and became a home from home.  I met all the staff who are wonderful.  My kids loved it when treated to afternoon tea (especially when they were shown where the chocolate was made and my son  (2 yrs) came up with a face covered in it and the biggest smile ive ever seen).  Rooms - perfect, Staff - Best Ever,  Food - Amazing (but please bring back the bread trolley)  Had some wonderful times here :-)",5,2011,11,01
130,The perfect Dorchester proposal,"My partner and I recently travelled to the Dorchester in London. I had chosen the Dorchester due to the fact my partner Sarah had booked here for a surprise birthday treat a couple of years ago and it was so amazing that I had to book it for this occasion.

The occasion in question was the opportunity for me to propose!!

I had told Sarah that we were travelling to London (from Brighton) for a business dinner with clients and were staying at the Dorchester. I booked the room over the phone with Anett in reservations and from this moment everything went perfectly with a lot of help from all of the staff at the Dorchester. 

I have copied and pasted below the thank you e-mail to Anett which contains all of the details of our stay. I hope that you enjoy your stay as much as we did:-

Hello Anett,

I just wanted to say a huge thank you for arranging everything for me on Friday night for my marriage proposal to my partner. Everything was absolutely perfect and we even got an upgrade and bottle of champagne in our room thanks to you!!

Everyone without exception made our stay the most wonderful experience of our lives. We were greeted at reception and everything was arranged for us and I met with the duty manager (unfortunately there were too many people we met from the Dorchester that evening for me to remember their names) who kindly showed me to the table you had reserved for us in the piano bar next to the piano.

When we came down to the bar we had a bottle of champagne and all the bar staff again without exception were amazing. The service was the best that we have ever experienced even better than the Burj al Arab in Dubai by far!! We had a glass and on cue the pianist started playing ""Beyond the Sea"" at which point I got up and proposed. Fortunately for me Sarah said 'yes' and the whole bar clapped!!!!

We then went to the Ivy where I had booked a table and the food was very good but would have preferred to stay at the hotel but your restaurant was full. Although your restaurant did call me the day before we arrived to say that they could accommodate us (in hindsight I should have taken the booking) I did not want to cancel our commitment with the Ivy as Fernando had made special arrangements for us and it was very nice. When we come to you next time I will definitely book in your restaurant.

We then returned to the hotel and had cocktails in China Tang and again the bar staff were very helpful. After sleeping in the most wonderful bed in the most wonderful room we went to the restaurant for breakfast and I had the best bacon sandwich I have ever had (with belly pork) and served by a very helpful waitress.

Sarah and I did not want to leave the hotel and I made a point of going to all of the staff to thank them personally for their service and friendliness before we left.

The surprise engagement party on Saturday was also a wonderful success in Brighton and I am sure that some of our friends will be booking with your hotel following our glowing reference about you.

Please could you make sure that this message gets passed to all the relevant people and also to the managers of the hotel as when you experience service like we did you really do want to make sure the right people hear about it.

We look forward to seeing over Christmas (if not before) and every year on the anniversary of our engagement!!

Thank you very much again for making it such a memorable occasion.

Kind regards,

Jamie & Sarah.",5,2011,10,25
130,AMAZING,"amazing hotel,great service, rooms very luxuries , big and very clean ( its hard to find a London hotel with no carpet stains..but ours looked like just been bought). the only drawback was the breakfast service which was extremely slow (considering we were the only people dining ) .overall 5+ star hotel ! can't wait to come back !",5,2011,10,25
130,Beautiful hotel with great service,We stayed 5 nights in the Dorchester in August and thoroughly enjoyed it. The theatre desk was very helpful and the concierge team were just incredible. We found the hotel exceptionally clean and well laid out. It is however rather expensive compared to other top hotels in London.,5,2011,10,23
130,"PERFECT DORCHESTER, PERFECT TEA","I have just had the afternoon champagne tea with three friends at the Dorchester Hotel and wish to say it was one of the most perfect occasions.   Two years ago we started meeting four times a year in London and try a different tea venue each time - we have been to some lovely places but I think The Dorchester is very nearly the tops.   I wish to thank the staff for being so friendly and quietly efficient and to the staff behind the scenes who made such a delectable tea for us all.   Anyone choosing to take tea here will not be disappointed!   Also, one cannot but be astounded at the beautiful flowers that are everywhere.   I can't wait to return.",5,2011,10,21
130,Afternoon Tea a must!,"Just got back from a trip to the UK where I took my mother, uncle and mother-in-law to the Dorcester for Afternoon Tea.  It was devine!  Absolutely fantastic and would strongly recommend the experience.  The hotels was welcoming and friendly, the setting and atmosphere was relaxed as afternoon tea should be.  The service impecable and the Tea itself was more than we could all manage.  In fact they offered us a doggy bag which surprised me as we didn't ask and thought it too nice an experience for that.  Well done I will come again next time I am in the UK.  We went to a famous competitor for afternoon tea a year ago and although the tea was good the service was far too formal and the setting stiff and not very friendly.  Go to the Dorcester you won't be disappointed.",5,2011,10,18
130,Afternoon tea at the Dorchester,"I have just returned from a weekend in London and was lucky enough to be treated by a friend for afternoon tea at the Dorchester, in celebration of my birthday.

On arrival, we were warmly greeted and advised where the clockrooms and ladies were situated. On returning, we were shown to our table and introduced to our waitress (unfortunately I'm terrible with names, so can't pass on our delight directly). Although we had booked the standard afternoon tea, we were shown the menu to see if we wanted any extras. As it was the day of my birthday, we treated ourselves to a glass of champers, which was delicious. Although you are given a time limit when booking, we certainly didn't feel rush and it was a very nice paced afternoon.

We ordered our tea and then our sandwiches arrived. They were so fresh and full of flavour and you were given the opportunity to have as many as you liked. Warm scones followed, together with an amazing selection of cakes. Our waitress was warm, friendly and the service was perfect.

As a lovely touch, I was then presented with a small birthday cake, which really made my day :). The birthday cake and small cakes that we hadn't been able to eat, were boxed, to enable them to take us home.

So all in all, I would throughly recommend the Dorchester for any special occasion, the surroundings are beautiful, the food divine and the staff so warm and friendly!",5,2011,10,13
130,Beautiful place to stay,"Perfect position to explore London, we drove in and used there car park which is conveniently placed and very reasonable. The room was very nicely furnished the bed was comfy and very large, bathroom was very clean shower powerful.
Breakfast was a treat food was excellent all very fresh from a full cooked English to fresh fruit,meats and pastry.  
All staff very pleasant, they bring the car up to you when you ready to leave.",4,2011,10,07
130,First time in London - From U.S.,"The Dorchester was recommended by a friend, and I must say I was very pleased with the overall service.  The staff was extremely attentive, polite, and helpful.  I stayed in a Queen size room where the bathroom was amazing. I loved the marble tiles and fabulous bathtub.  The only minor disappointment was the decor of the bedroom. It reminded me of an old cottage with a countryside floral print on the bedspread and curtains.  An updated and more modern look would have topped it off.  The bed was comfortable, and the room was well structured to silence any potential noise in adjacent rooms.  

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE SPA!!! What an amazing experience.  I pampered myself to The Lavender Crush spa treatment.  If you stay at The Dorchester, you must receive a spa treatment while visiting.  

I give this hotel a 4-star rating because I did feel it was slightly overpriced for the services I received. The hotel is located in Hyde Park which is a very safe neighborhood.  There is a cafe called Cafe Richoux that I visited quite often during my weekend travels.  It is in walking distance from The Dorchester...about 5 minutes.

I would probably stay at this hotel again during my next trip to London.",4,2011,10,03
130,Small rooms average service high cost,"A classic landmark hotel no doubt but there are so many better places to stay.
Anyone who has ever stayed in a  real 5 star hotel in Asia or the mniddle east knows this can never  be a 5 star hotel in their league . 

If you like history thats fine but I prefer bigger rooms and less stuffy  environment. 
 
As a plus its well located for the west end and the park  and teh chinese restaurant is very good",3,2011,09,30
130,I don't understand the hype!,"The Dorchester obviously has a strong following amongst the well heeled looking for that old school charm. However I never really understood exactly what was so fantastic to justify the £500 pn for what was essentially a small room with a shower inside the bath. Something I really loath as climbing into a bath for a shower and invariably struggling with he night if the shower head pretty much is guaranteed to put me in a bad mood. Yes the staff are smiling and efficient but I would expect that at any 5 star hotel. Breakfast to be honest pretty average. A pancake, 2 pieces od crispy bacon, orange juice and coffee will set you back £32. A bit heavy considering the bacon had burnt edges and 1 day the pancake came with a compote and the next day it didn't! Wireless access in the rooms was intermittent with varying strength and costs a hefty £19 p.d. Laundery of socks at £5 had me just go out and buy a 3 pack. All in all this is a place for the wealthy to enjoy without consideration of the price but left me feeling pretty ambivalent. Maybe the new 45 Park Lane would suit my more modern needs.

130,Great hotel shame about the food.,"We took advantage of a deal on the internet for a 2 night stay including breakfast, the hotel , rooms and entrance area are superb, the main hall is one of the best looking lounge area's of any hotel I have stayed in, the big disapointment was the breakfast, after trying to order scambled eggs three times we gave up, everyone of them were well over done! we could not get over to the kichen staff via the waiter to do them lightly, cardboard tasting eggs should not happen or be expected in a 5 star hotel, in the end I offered to the waiter my services in order to show the kitchen staff how to cook scrambled eggs correctly, my offer was declined politely, in the end my wife had the english breakfast which was nothing to shout about, so good hotel but the food is dissapointing,  we asked the hotel conseiage  to order afternoon tea in the Langham hotel which was great, we also went in the London eye and went to a show in the westend, all in all a very pleasent little trip.",4,2011,09,24
130,Spa - an opulent day of pampering!,"This is the 4th occasion when I have been lucky enough to spend a day at this Spa - and on each occasion it has more than lived up to its reputation.

The decor provides an oasis of calm - in a setting which is so glamorous you can imagine yourself whisked back to a 1940's or 50's flm set!  All the main areas are cream and brightly lit with lots of mirrors and draped organza curtains - with a sweeping chandelier in reception and a locker room with a unique 4 seater ""dressing table"" in the centre (and not a smelly pair of trainers in sight!)

The treatment rooms are spacious and very comfortable - with showers attached - and the dressing robes and towels are luxuriously soft and thick

The lavender crush treatment is one of my favourites - although I have also had an aromatherapy massage and facial on previous occasions, which were also excellent

The showers are well appointed and powerful - although there are only 2 regular showers (and a greater number of treatment rooms) - which could cause a bit of congestion 

The relaxation room is dark and serene - with comfortable sofas with plumped up cushions and a table full of healthy nibbles

I usually opt to have a light lunch in the Spatisserie which is within the Spa area - and so it is perfectly acceptable to eat in a robe if inbetween treatments.  It is beautifully appointed, albeit simple - and the food is healthy and first rate.  On each occasion it been known the occasion was a special one (eg my niece's 18th birthday) we have been presented with a complimentary Congratulations chocolate cake!

The staff are delightful - and the therapists seemed genuinely concerned to ensure our experience was made as pleasurable as possible 

My only slight irritation is that the music in the treatment rooms appears ""piped"" - and was slightly irritating - some of it was too fast to accord with the wonderfully relaxing treatment!

Not a cheap day - but absolutely value for money!",5,2011,09,19
130,fabulous stay,"I stayed at The Dorchester with my partner for an evening before we flew off to Paris the next day. The Hotel was lovely the staff very polite and professional, true 5 star service from the staff. The lobby is impressive and the rooms comfortable (the bed was so comfortable in fact that I went home and ordered the same pillows lol) 

A couple of friends met us at the bar and we had lovely cocktails before heading out to Hakkasan (Which the Dorchester managed to book for us) 

Breakfast was sensational the best Egg Benedict was fantastic! the waiter was charming and very friendly. 

The only down point was the housekeeping in our room - unfortunately there was several hairs occupying our bathtub and bathroom floor - presumably from the last guest - small details that should be addressed. Apart from this slight downfall - A brilliant Hotel that is truly 5 Stars.",5,2011,09,19
130,"A london Lanmark, but not for me !","The Dorchester is definitely one of London famous Landmarks where it resides on the famous Park lane and having a long reputation for catering towards the rich and famous. The hotel service is no doubt excellent when it comes to the afternoon tea (which requires an early booking, and very good) and their room service. The front desk has a team of eastern European who seem to talk to their guests with slight attitude and in a very computerized manner. The promenade at night turns into a social club where all the rich from the middle east seem to socialize till the early hours of the morning, not mentioned the fleet of one million dollar price tagged cars casually parked outside.

But I have to mention, if you do have the opportunity to stay in this hotel, you have to make sure to fully abuse the concierge as he is one of the best concierges you might ever meet. The word ""NO"" or ""Sorry"" does not exist in his vocab.

I must say that the rooms are very average and dated. They are done with very vintage British interiors (which I don’t mind) and the toilets are fully marbled and well equipped.

To end this, this hotel is used to catering a certain crowd where money is not an issue for them. If you are watching the pennies, then its best to look at other nearby hotels.

Overall, good for an experience. But not the best that I have tried.",3,2011,09,19
130,Afternoon Tea,"Went to The Dortchester for traditional afternoon tea today. Unfortunately we spent most of our time here having to listen to an alarm going off in the hotel which none of the staff were able to turn off. To be fair to them, they did offer us a free glass of champagne to make up for this, but even a free drink was not enough to distract from the nuisance of it or the headache it left you with.
 The actual afternoon tea was nice - You get to choose from a vast collection of tea's which is then bought to you in a teapot. Then come the sandwiches- there were 5 different finger sandwiches which the waiters will offer you more of when your plate is empty. This was followed by a nice little rhubarb dessert and then small scones and a selection of small cakes. I am very keen on cake so was dissapointed that the cake selection only had 5 types of cake- and only one of each : o ( not great for two people. Again though, if you eat all of these you will be offered more, but only a repeat of the same 5 items (berry macaroon, victoria sponge, chocolate mousse cake, choux bun, lemon tart). Would have been nice if there was a wider variety, and if you were given two of everything so that both people can try each item.
 We were dissapointed again when we were moved to the bar area at the back of the 'promenade' as our table was needed (wouldn't have been so bad had we been given some warning of this rather than having a waitress saying ' we need this table right now so I will have to move you now'.) We had been there for under 2 hours at this point which doesn't feel like a very long time when you have several 'courses' to get through - tea to drink, sandwiches, dessert, scones and then cake. 
 Aside from this, the staff were all welcoming and keen to serve. The hotel is grand, in a very English way. 
We do feel very disappointed that our experience today wasn't as perfect as we would have liked but I would still say it is a nice way to spend an afternoon (well, if you didn't have to listen to an alarm going off for an hour and until your time runs out on your table and you are moved!), although it is very expensive for what you actually get.",4,2011,09,18
130,"Good intentions without a doubt, but a bit too many shortcomings","We have reserved online and requested a bouquet of seasonal flowers on arrival (one of their standard suggested experience enhancers) and a chauffeured car to pick us up from the airport, meeting and greeting included.
After I have communicated by mail all the requested detailed information to enable the car to be there and the meeting and greeting to happen when it should, and got a written confirmation that my arrival time, flight number, terminal, number of people and bags were duly noted, I have got a strange call from a lady introducing herself with a heavy accent as being Valentina with The Dorchester’s reservation department and called to clarify important aspects of my airport pick-up request. I had to call her back as she caught me in a meeting but when I did so she was confusingly and unnecessarily repeating the details I had already given and the hotel confirmed they have received. When I did ask her rather abruptly what does she really want she admitted the call was an error. (???)
Arriving at the hotel we were greeted very warmly by Ismail Suarez, a talented guest service agent, who proudly introduced us to the legendary hotel and graciously led us personally to our (upgraded!) room but, to everyone’s surprise, the housekeeping were still there, hard at work. Ismail had to apologize and offered drinks in the bar. Correct one would say, but unnecessary and embarrassing if better communication would of have been employed between the front desk and the housekeeping department.
When we have finally gained access to the room we have noticed the absence of the flowers we’ve ordered but did not really mind that much the fact until we finally found them! But not in the room as you would expect but as a charge on the bill. Not delivering on a request may be a forgivable mistake. Charging for a service you did not deliver although requested is a bit more disturbing, don’t you think? When we confronted the cashier with this he immediately apologized and graciously offered to comp the internet charges. Correct again but again embarrassing and unnecessary.
The breakfast they pride themselves as being one of the best in the city is not as legendary as they wish to think. Although the Promenade setting is truly fantastic, the food and the service are not memorable. The components of the pastry basket are stale and poor quality and the service is inconsistent. Sometimes they go around with the juice carafes offering a choice of orange or grapefruit, sometimes they simply don’t. Sometimes the toast comes naturally with one’s choice of eggs, sometimes one has to ask for it and wait until the eggs get cold. Butter is sometimes brought to the table as a standard setting and sometimes it has to be requested for as an extra. There is no choice of poultry cold cuts whatsoever, the very elegant silver salt mills lack …salt.
Other than that, the rooms are well attended to by the housekeeping staff, classy and well appointed in true country-house style featuring good quality antique furniture but state-of-the-art entertainment, the bathrooms well supplied with good quality amenities, the hotel lobby and hallways are clean and well decorated in classic good taste style. A true gem perfectly located in the city.
The bell and door staff are extremely helpful and genuinely interested in solving whatever problem one may have. A knowledgeable and well connected concierge desk that gets you in almost anywhere and give valuable advice. The chauffeurs are elegant, helpful and very nice. The front desk staff is very helpfull and is doing their best to be efficient. Absolutely all the hotel employees smile genuinely and greet the guests at all times throughout the property making one feel welcome and cared for.",3,2011,09,18
130,Wonderfully Grand Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel, very grand, yet modern. Excellant location.",5,2011,09,14
130,What's left to say...,"I had an interview on Friday morning, so we decided to make the visit to London a pleasant break for both of us. We checked in after travelling up by train & were booked into the Grill for dinner later (Alain Duchasse's restaurant was closed because of the tradiitonal French summer holiday...) We have stayed several times at The Dorchester before & simply love it. It oozes style. Everything is just perfect. There was one glitch when a member of staff attempted to enter the bedroom on Sunday morning at, shall we say, a rather inappropriate moment. Luckily the door had the safety lock on so we were not embarassed by the incident. It did not spoil our lovely luxurious long weekend.",5,2011,09,13
130,The elegance of it all!,"Loved our stay here!  The doormen with their top hats tipped was quite memorable.  Hotel exudes old time elegance.  Great location, beautiful room, huge bathroom.... We'll be back!",5,2011,09,12
130,perfection!!,"I am just back from an amazing 2 night stay in the Dorchester Hotel with my family. From the moment we got there until the moment we left we were treated with impeccable 5 star service. We were particularly happy with the service from one of their employees, Arnau, who looked after us and our every need in the most professional and friendly manner possible and really made our stay that little bit more special. The breakfast was beautiful and had so much variety and on one of the mornings that we ordered breakfast in bed it was delivered fast and efficiently and was still piping hot...nothing better to wake up to. i cant wait to return to London and I without a doubt know where I will be booking myself into.",5,2011,09,07
130,Great Breakfast,"I'm a sucker for a good breakfast, and I think that the Dorchester provides the best in town. Comfortable seats, great pastries, love all that crockery. Best part is the service. 

It's tricky to get that 'everything all right sir' when you actually need something (as opposed to just being irritating) but they manage it. I've never been served with less than total charm and professionalism. Where other places can have stressed staff, they seem relaxed.

Only drawback is surrounding tables selling each other missiles and stuff.",5,2011,09,06
130,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","Delightful hotel, utterly charming, fantastic service, ultra comfy beds, very soundproof rooms, lovely marble bathrooms and a real sense of christmas cheer.  You are really made to feel part of a special Dorchester family.  Would definitely stay again.  We also dined at the Alain Ducasse restaurant. Superb.",5,2011,09,04
130,Truly Spoilt on our Ruby Wedding Anniversary,"My husband & I decided to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary at The Dorchester & we are so glad we did.
On arrival we found we had been upgraded to a executive deluxe room, over looking Hyde Park. Sheer luxury! I have to say the bed, linen & pillows were to die for!!
On arrival to our room we found chamapgne on ice, strawberries dipped in chocolate & a bowl of fruit. This was a most unexpected & kind gesture. Very much appreciated.
My husband had also arranged delivery of a beautiful bouquet of flowers, created by the Dorchester florists. This is still being much enjoyed since our arrival home.
We enjoyed both lunch & breakfast in the Grill. Thanks there for our anniversary cake!
The staff were all polite, friendly & very helpful. A credit to the hotel.
Thank you to all at the Dorchester for making our special day EXTRA special.
We are already planning a return visit.
In the evening we went to the London Palladium to see ""The Wizard of Oz"", which was excellent.
Certainly an anniversary we will never forget.",5,2011,09,03
130,Excellent,"I was a little concerned regarding our stay at the Dorcester due to some comments posted on this site, however I needn't have been
We stayed at the Dorcester at the end of August as a suprise birthday treat for my husband.I had mentioned this on booking, and when we checked in it was commented upon - the communication channels work at the Dorcester. We arrived around 1pm and were shown to our room straight away that had been upgraded from a deluxe to an executive. The room was superb and looked over the front of the hotel, with a side view of Hyde Park and Park Lane. All staff were friendly and helpful. Everywhere, as you would expect was spotless, and the abundance of fresh flowers are superb. My husband was made to feel special over our stay, and birthday cakes arrived each day! We ate in The Grill and had the 7 course taster menu which was lovely however I would opt in future for only 5 courses and not be greedy! The concierge were really helpful and we were able to obtain tickets for attractions from them, which negated the need to queue. A very enjoyable stay in luxurious surroundings, with attentive staff.",5,2011,09,03
130,Everything we expected ... and more!,"We stayed for 2 nights as an anniversary treat - and what a treat!

We were upgraded on arrival, and also had a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us - a lovely, and much appreciated, gesture. All staff we encountered were friendly, professional and approachable. Our room was both impeccable and impressive but above all, incredibly comfortable - the bath being easily the deepest I have ever had the pleasure of sinking into! Breakfast in the Promenade was a relaxing start to each day, the fare did not disappoint.

The Dorchester manages to combine an effortless style and quality leaving you feeling extremely well looked after. And looking forward to a return visit.",5,2011,08,31
130,Fantastic - expensive but you are truly spoilt,"My husband and I stayed here for a night as a birthday gift for me.  We had a luxury room (I think) which was enormous, with a huge bed, and a bath tub you could sink in.  Although the view wasnt great, this wasn't an issue at all - the only time I looked out was to see if we had a view - at night the curtains are closed, and in the day there are nets so you just see sunlight rather than the view itself.

We ate at The Grill, and the food was incredible.  Everybody there was very friendly and helpful, recommending wine for each course, and nothing was too much effort for them - something we found with every member of staff.  The surprise birthday chocolate cake was also great - and when we couldn't eat it (after such a great dinner) The Dorchester boxed it up for us to take home.

My only ""complaint"" (although it's far from a complaint) is that you have to pay nearly £20 for internet access.  At the price of the rooms I find this grates a bit - even cheap hotels tend to offer free internet (or at most charge about £5 for it), and I really do think this should be included in the room rate.",5,2011,08,29
130,Beautiful accommodations close to the park,"We stayed at the Dorchester for 3 nights before a cruise vacation. Two rooms, connected--both a little on the small side, but we made the most of the space. The bedding, toiletries, etc., were excellent.

As part of our package we received the daily breakfast which is VERY pricey--not crowded, as no one except someone on a package would use it. The waitstaff was extremely accommodating. Afternoon tea was wonderful, highly recommend it.

The location is great, right off the park and close (5-10 minute walk) to Tube stations on two different lines. It's in a beautiful neighborhood with high-priced homes and other hotels. The only negative is there are really no stores or restaurants, per se, close to the hotel. I had to go down to a gas station convenience store (5 minutes away).",5,2011,08,21
130,Fabulous Afternoon Tea Experience,"My daughter wanted to celebrate her 21st birthday by taking Afternoon Tea in London, and we couldn't have chosen better than the Dorchester.  The Promenade Room is beautiful and the staff, without exception, were friendly and attentive. Our waitress (Rasa?) in particular was charming and kept appearing with platters of sandwiches and delectable pastries. The Champagne Afternoon Tea starts with a glass of delicious Laurent-Perrier, we were then served a selection of finger sandwiches - all mouthwateringly good. Then scones with homemade jams, and lastly some cakes and pastries which looked so beautiful it was almost a shame to eat them.  Generous quantities of everything - to the point we felt we could not eat another morsel.  They even asked the pianist to play 'Happy Birthday' and presented my daughter with a gorgeous chocolate birthday cake with candles - she felt like a princess.  Yes, afternoon tea is expensive but the food was exquisite and the ambiance delightful.  Thank you to everyone at the Dorchester for making my daughter's birthday so memorable.",5,2011,08,16
130,Large Rooms in London,"I wanted to stay right near a tube stop during our March visit to London, to avoid long soggy walks, but the Dorchester offered a very tempting package for our 8 night stay.  Rooms were really quite large - a bit grandmotherly with cabbage roses and chintz, yes, but bed in all three rooms (moved once then stayed with my daughter when husband left ) was very comfortable.  Bathrooms are new though in ours the shower meant climbing up into a high tub which was amazingly awkward and undoubtedly dangerous.  Service was very nice and within hours we were greeted by name.   Both breakfast and tea were delicious and elegant but without pretension.  A bit of hike to tube stops but all in all worth getting soggy.",4,2011,08,14
130,Excellent as always,"Great room, overlooked Park lane.
Staff are superb, service is excellent - nothing is too much trouble.

Breakfast in The Promenade was the best start to any day.

Love this hotel for the staff, the location and room sizes are fantastic especially for London.",5,2011,08,13
130,Nice old hotel in great location,"This old classic hotel is in a fabulous location just across the street from Hyde Park and near wonderful shops and cafes in Mayfair, Knightsbridge and nearly Berkeley Square area.  The decor in the beautiful, spacious, expensive rooms is lovely and kudos to the chefs as the cuisine is divine in the restaurants.  Room service is outstanding and if you request an 8:03 am breakfast, then it arrives to the minute exactly.  Rooms facing Park Lane can be a bit noisy from the unrelenting traffic, so I suggest taking one of the quieter suites at another part of the hotel.   Now for the staff -- why is it such a British tradition for staff working in posh places to be so arrogant, I wonder.  If you aren't a foreign dignitary, or a British mucky-muck possessing an exalted rank, or a famous person, then you are treated subordinately, even though your pounds sterling spend just the same - and we're talking about a lot of pounds sterling at this hotel.  The most polite person who lacked a superior air that I dealt with was an exceptionally nice security guard who personally escorted me to and from a small shop down the street at night so I would be safe.  It's a comfortable, old grand dame and a pleasant stay for a couple of weeks in London, although there are many other 5 star choices in London that are less stuffy.",4,2011,08,11
130,"Quintessentially English Afternoon Tea. Superb, Lovely.","I visited the Dorchester for afternoon tea with my future daughter-in-law & friends in May a little celebration before the wedding day. Right from entering this beautiful hotel all was fantastic, we were treated like royalty. Our waiter was so attentive, unobtrusive & helpful. Individual tea & coffee pots for each guest which were replenished quickly & quietly.  The food was excellent, the pianist played the Wedding March, a little celebration cake was produced & we all received a keepsake tin of Dorchester tea home with us. We had cocktails in the bar first & what can I say about these, out of this world comes to mind. 
This experience was second to none, highly reccommended to all.
I wish qll hotels I visit had staff like the Dorchester.
The service we received was just great.",5,2011,08,07
130,"Amazing place, wonderful service","Booked the hotel for my Dads 70th Birthday for two nights.  Mum and Dad had an incredible time, the hotel gave my Dad a bottle of champagne and birthday cake (unexpected, but wonderful touch), and they so looked after them both.
I have stayed here a couple of times myself, and after my parents amazing stay, I can't wait to get back.
Thank you Dorchester",5,2011,08,07
130,Superb afternoon tea,"How much better can it be than beautiful surroundings, excellent service, wonderful teas and champagne and a superb and never ending choice of goodies to eat?

Highly recommended, especially the humble cheese and pickle sandwich which the Dorchester has elevated to an art form. It must be down to their home beaked specialty breads.

If you love a high tea then this treat is one not to be missed.",5,2011,08,06
130,wonderful,"Travelling alone for the first time and never having stayed there before, I didnt know what to expect. I felt safe and comfortable and all the staff were helpful and friendly , they all knew my name and couldnt do enough for me. I even stayed an extra night and the concierge went to the station for me and changed my  train ticket  whilst I visited Buckingham Palace , on the State room tour ( which on my request the concierge had arranged for me) If you can afford to stay at the Dorchester  DO IT !!  If thats what heavens like i promise to be really good from now on!!",4,2011,07,31
130,Not great,"Stayed here on business with my client. The rooms are ok but I found the décor in general in serious need of modernisation.  Flowery wall paper is actually quite disgusting.  The bathroom, however, was great.  The shower was perfect with monsoon shower, the linen was as you would expect and the toiletries were high quality and in abundance.

What really put me off was when ironing a brand new white shirt, the iron provided was completely burnt out and ruined my shirt.  When the 20 something year old house keeper came and started to lecture a seasoned soldier how to use an iron, it was somewhat annoying.

I wouldn't stay here again if I could avoid it and although the staff are professional and helpful, the feel for me was a lot less than many other 5* hotels...

Now, China Tang on the other hand is a completely different story...!",3,2011,07,29
130,The Grande Dame Has Lost Her Luster,"I have been visiting London with my family for over a decade now and usually the highlight of my trip has been staying at The Dorchester.  This summer, however, service and quality was far below what I would have expected in a luxury hotel and I am going to seek an alternate hotel for my next stay.

CHECK-IN:  I arrived off a Cunard cruise at 10 a.m.   Despite having stayed at the hotel several times, I was greeted as if I were a first time guest.  Even after I explained how often I had visited the city, I was still asked if I needed directions/maps or a guide to the city.  I had reserved two connecting rooms and I understood that check in was at 3.   After an enjoyable day in the city, I returned at 3:15 to find neither room ready and a rather apathetic reception.  This should have been unacceptable in a hotel of the Dorchester's quality.  I was told the room would be ready in twenty minutes and was offered a complimentary drink in the bar.  However, when I was taken to the bar by reception, they sat my family at a table that had been reserved.  So we had to get up again!  I don't fault the bar staff, who were quite sympathetic and offered excellent service.  I do fault reception...someone was supposed to have come back for us when the room was ready.  No one ever did.  We kept having to check to see if the room was ready!   When we complained (again) about the wait, we were told the rooms were 'too nice' and reception had other rooms that weren't 'as nice' ready but didn't want to give them to us, so it would be best for us to wait.  Huh?  Does this mean there are rooms at the hotel they wouldn't recommend?  As it was we didn't get in our room with our luggage until 5:00.

THE ROOM:   Both rooms were rather small considering they were supposed to be 'so nice'.  The furnishings were comfortable (though we missed a glass shower stall as we had on previous visits).  The air conditioning was quite loud and had to be placed on high to get any sort of cooling. What was really unacceptable was the noise...there was construction being done above us.  One day it go particularly bad and we called reception to complain.  We were assured someone would call us back.  No one every did.  Half an hour later, I took the initiative to call and was told that there was no construction being done!  I asked to have someone come to the room to listen (as the wall was shaking, I found it hard to believe this was an 'outside effect') and was told someone could get back to me.  No one ever did.  A total of four phone calls occurred before the noise 'stopped'.  Never once were they initiated by reception.

HOUSEKEEPING:  Came about five seconds after we checked in for turn down service.  Left a bag of garbage in our room.  Kept stopping by the day we were checking out to see when we would finally leave so they could clean the room.  

ROOM SERVICE:  Expensive and slow...most meals for four took over forty five minutes with an estimated half hour time.  Twice they forgot part of our order.  A meal from the express menu (which offered 15 minute items) took over half an hour.  Scottish lobster was delicious though.  

AFTERNOON TEA:  Imperative to have a reservation, which we did.  We sat for over 25 minutes before someone came over to take our order.  We weren't even served by our normal waiter, another waiter took pity on us.  Our waiter, meanwhile, just kept walking past our table.  We ordered the champagne tea.  I have always gotten the champagne with the tea, this time our waiter did not bring out the tea until after our champagne was done and we had to request it.   When it was brought out (45 minutes after we sat down) it was unsteeped and had to sit for a while before it could be drunk.
We had previously emailed some dietary requirements and the kitchen went out of their way.  The deserts were some of the best pastries I have ever had.  

CHECK OUT:  We ordered a car for the airport and asked reception to call us when the car was ready.  Of course, they never did.  When we called after the car was close to twenty minutes late, we were told it had 'just driven up'.  Convenient.

OVERALL:  Not every hotel can be 'perfect.' For years, however, the Dorchester came pretty close.  There were too many issues on our visit this summer though to be excused.",4,2011,07,27
130,LOVE IT!!!,"Have yet to stay in other hotels but i love this place to the max!

Was speaking to the front office manager, Andreas and he is superbly patient and explained to me the history of the hotel about how the brunei sultan (if i recalled correctly) bought the place, gave it a unique design etc.

More importantly, the hotel boasts the deepest bath-tub one can have. I am a huge huge bath tub fan and being able to sink in one of those is pure bliss

Overall, thumbs up for the service, the place and the location",5,2011,07,26
130,Great hotel but wanted a view of Hyde Park and didn't get it.,"Loved the hotel, but we booked in January for a July stay and requested a room with a view of Hyde Park. When we arrived we had a room with absolutely no view. I don't understand why you can't get the view you requested when you make the reservation 6 months in advance- very puzzling. Other than this irritating issue we really enjoyed our stay. ",4,2011,07,16
130,Afternoon tea - FABULOUS,"We booked afternoon tea some time ago for a party of 6 (2 ladies celebrating 40th birthday parties) what a fantastic experience!
The food was excellent, the service was the finest I have experienced for a very very long time, and it made me proud to be English as the experience also transcended nationalities.
From the doormen at front of house, the receptionist at the desk, Sam behind the Promenade bar to Nellie the lady who served us tea, and the backroom staff that prepared the fantastic food ,the service was faultless, all of our party (attendees of afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason, the Ritz, the Pump rooms in Bath) commented on how relaxed, professional and enjoyable the experience was, from the high tea to the doggy bags and the gift bags we received.
We as a representative group of professional people who have travelled extensively  and understand quality and service agreed wholeheartedly that this was a tour de force.
I am not normally given to hyperbole but this experience was an exception, we shall be writing to the Dorchester to commend them on a truly memorable experience. If you ever book an afternoon tea book the Dorchester. . I assurey you, you won't regret it",5,2011,07,10
130,A great hotel fades away,"I stayed at the Dorchester in 1997.  It was a tremendous experience of first class service in a London landmark. I revisited there in November 2010 to dine in the Promenade.  This was a disappointment.  The waiter forgot our order, then served it cold, without interest. The  entertainment was an off-key singer.  The building is the same, the decor is the same, but the original spirit of British warmth and excellence is gone.  We were saddened by it all and left.  We won't return.",3,2011,07,08
130,Stayed there before and loved it,"Having stayed at the Dorchester before and having received great service i decided to stay there again. The only problem was at check in was that we were not welcomed back as previous guest and when i queried this i was told that we were not on the system as they had upgraded and lost there data i thought this was a bit poor
The staff were fantastic and it is the best hotel i have stayed in london of which i have stayed at some of the other hotels at this level in the city",5,2011,07,08
130,Afternoon tea - amazing!,"My wife and I called in here for afternoon tea and we were fortunate to obtain a table without a reservation (though seeing how busy it was and usually is we were very lucky, thank you!) 
Fantastic teas (lapsang and green oolong) beautifully served and with cakes to die for. Linen everywhere which is what you would expect. Very professional and discreet service, I usually have my eyes everywhere, but the staff managed to clear and replenish two tables next to me without my noticing, that's what I mean when I say discreet and professional! Everyone in fantastic clean and smart uniforms and everyone with a smile on their faces, they all seemed to be happy to be working on a warm sunny day, and you couldn't say that about many hotels or restaurants of that high standard in London.
If you only have time to do a few things in London, put afternoon tea at the Dorchester high on your list, you won't regret it
Thanks to everyone who looked after us on 2nd June!",5,2011,06,03
130,Shame about the Restaurant,"Ok, the rooms are hideous, unless you like that sort of thing, they are certainly overpriced, but then it is in the centre of London and they do charge for the internet which really bugs me and they don't include breakfast, but they do assure you that if you have breakfast before 12 noon you won't have to be offended by being asked to sign the bill! (Over £30 for an English)

But those carpets don't come cheap and in many ways it is faultless, so why you may wonder did I ask to see the Duty Manager as I checked out?

Well at 1440 on the previous afternoon I had rung down to the Grill to ask for a table for lunch. Only to be told that they were absolutely full and, in any case, stopped serving at 1500. But, I was assured should things change I would be called straight away!

At 1455 I tired of waiting and trotted down to the Grill, which to my surprise was only some 60% full. I spoke to the same woman, she even reminded me that I had just called down (just was stretching a point but in that timeless atmosphere who's arguing about a few minutes here or there) and then without so much as a blush trotted me straight in to the restaurant and sat me down at a table! I gave myself a very good pinch and tried to work out how it was that I was sitting in the very restaurant i had been told only 15 minutes before was full and fully booked! I'm using the singular here and it should, of course, be the plural to which I will now change.
Time moved on and 1500 came and went and still people arrived, were shown tables and were served food, in fact when I left at about 1615 they were still coming in and were still being served. I wondered out loud to my companion if we would have been left stranded in the room!
As I pointed out to a very apologetic Duty Manager the next morning, perhaps they just didn't need (or was it want) any more customers. Which only goes to prove that even in the best places it's easy to lie over a telephone but not so easy face to face!
By the way it was an excellent lunch!
Half a bottle of vin ordinaire Chablis in the minibar for £40 (plus plus) was too far for even my exhausted Amex card!
Would I go back? Probably, but I'd leave my glasses behind",3,2011,05,31
130,THE best 5* luxury hotel in london by a mile !,"stayed on may 29th with a friend for the bupa london 10k run on the bank holiday monday,
On arrival we were escorted to the reception desk and promptly given our room keys along with signing all the usual forms upon check in.
the receptionist gave us a tour of the hotel then took us to our room , 614 , which is a deluxe double room and gave us another tour of the featuress of the room.
After this , the valet was sent up , where not 1 but 2 people came to unpack my luggage ! luxury at its finest i must say.
during the rest of the day we had a few requests for the maid and conceirge and all requests were handled with a true yes anything ' attitude , whereby nothig was too much trouble.all the staff we met were very courteous and friendly
upon coming back to the hotel in the evening we had a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us along with a playstation 3 and a few games which were brand new and unopened , the controllers fpr this were placedon each bedside table , so no need to get up and down .
had a wake up call which arrived dead on 6.30am with a follow up call 10 minutes later , when i got asked if there was anything i wanted before i even spoke :P
breakfast arrived at 7 am ( again with 2 waiters ) and everything was opened for me to check , along with my shoes shined and my newspaper set up on the desk area !
my mum came to visit at the hotel around 2pm , where she was given a seperate key and escorted up to the room , and referred to by name by all the staff she met , which was amazing considering she was not an official guest of the hotel.
porter was then called to collect luggage and he asked if we would like him to have a taxi or car waiting for our departure
I have stayed at many 5 stars in london , including claridges and the connaught , but now i think i may have been converted thanks to the amazing , super efficient and friendly staff , and a hotel where you do not want for anything as all the small things are taken care of before you even think of them yourself!
truly a fantastic stay and i look forward to returning !",5,2011,05,31
130,The only place to stay whilst you are in London - simply the best,"I have stayed at the Dorchester on numerous occasions and recently went for my husband's birthday as it is our favourite hotel in London. A very warm reception as always from the helpful staff and the beautiful lobby, I always LOVE the amazing flower arrangements they have as you enter the hotel.

We were upgraded to a beautiful room - just look at the pictures to see what a luxury this hotel is! We even popped out for a walk around to come back to a delicious chocolate cake saying Happy Birthday to my husband with a card which was a lovely touch.

The rooms are of an impeccable standard so grand, clean, spacious and elegant. The furniture and décor is magnificent and the beds are some of the comfiest I have ever slept in, you won't want to get out of them in the morning!!

Breakfast downstairs is great but sometimes the room service food is not up to the same standard so would advise if you can to eat in the restaurants rather than order to the room.

This hotel is an absolute must and worth every penny!!",5,2011,05,24
130,Afternoon Tea - Simply Superb!,"Afternoon Tea at The Dorchester is simply the best experience you could wish for. Professional service. Quality food. Beautiful surroundings. Relaxed atmosphere. 

A must if you are ever in London.",5,2011,05,21
130,Expensive but worth every penny,"Was in London for a friend's engagement so decided to treat my partner and totally blow the budget by booking a junior suite someplace special to act as our base for 2 nights in early May. Our stay at the Dorchester was very comfortable, one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed. To begin with the concierge was amazing, very professional in arranging a couple of reservations and an excellent car service - I really didn't want to mess up my ""just done"" hair and perfect party dress riding in some dirty taxi. (Huge thanks to Al, our chauffeur who inspirationally gave us his number so we could call him when we finally needed picking up, well past midnight from Battersea power station).

The Dorchester's reception team too was very helpful with supporting enquiries and arranging extra flowers for our room. The room service staff were the best - the suite was immaculate, clean and fresh. The turndown service maid actually folded my clothes that I left out, super efficient!

The jnr suite was beautifully presented and large with a seating area. The emphasis is on the small details that make for a feeling of relaxed well being. I found the dressing room a bit small, but the room can be divided by a sliding curtain, which makes for a great private space if needed.  The bathroom was beautifully appointed with a great range of nice yummy toiletries.  The bath so deep I was just able to peek over the top of the rim heehee, a great tub for sharing a long soak ;) 

I can't comment on the hotel dining experience as we didn't use the hotel's restaurant, even though China Tang nearly tempted. BUT London is not short of options so we decided to explore the local eats and bars, again the concierge's knowledge proved invaluable to what was happening in the area.

Breakfast was yummy and the service was very attentive with good choice and options that catered to my low sodium diet.

Overall I would love to return back someday to enjoy the city more.",5,2011,05,20
130,An absolute must,Well looked after the moment we arrived The front end staff ie the doormen and reception staff were welcoming and friendly The room and service was top drawer and would recommend this fantastic place to absolutely anyone Thank You to everyone who made our stay a happy and pleasant one,5,2011,05,13
130,The last of the great London hotels,"The mark of a great hotel is to make its guests feel genuinely welcome and at home, and the Dorchester does this with a genuine charm that I thought long lost in modern London.  Every member of staff we met was infinitely helpful, friendly and professional - we felt comfortable and looked after as soon as we handed over the car keys at the entrance.

London is full of identikit 'luxury' hotels, many of which we've stayed in, but none comes close to the Dorchester for service.  Our room was elegant, spacious, comfortable and quiet - a real sense of sanctuary from the mayhem of Park Lane.  The spacious marble bathroom was beautiful, with gorgeous Floris toiletries. The Dorchester has resisted the temptation to set trends or be cool,  and it has paid off handsomely - it's now one of the very few hotels left in London with a sense of its own history and style.  Yes it's expensive, but worth every penny.",5,2011,05,10
130,"A lovely experience""","Stayed for one night on the eve of  'The Wedding"" - took advantage of the Easter offer.  From check in to check out everything was perfect (almost).  Gloria at reception was super professional and lovely, escorted us to our room where our wonderfully chilled bottle of champagne and canapes awaited.   We enjoyed cocktails at the bar later and were afforded a late check-out without hesitation. If I had to be super picky the room was a little dark with no central lighting - it overlooked the terrace, however the bed linen was the smoothest/softest I've ever encountered on my travels and the pillows sheer clouds of heaven......Tea/coffee making facilities would be nice although a kettle and cups were delivered upon request...... an unforgettable experience!! which we hope to repeat.",5,2011,05,10
130,Glitzy with poor breakfasts,"Firstly, this is a superb hotel that everyone will be very happy to stay at but it does come at a price.

The rooms are nice and the service is excellent but it is a little glitzy. 

No point in going on about all the great things – you’ll know those already. 

What about the downsides?

1	It’s a bit glitzy
2	The bar seems to be full of ladies of the night
3	The choice of TV stations is limited
4	There’s no sleep timer on the TV
5	The breakfast is awful for £32 per person. We could have done better down at the greasy spoon around the corner.
6                   The view over the park isn't worth pying for as all you see are the AC units on the roof below",5,2011,05,08
130,Faultless experience,"I recently stayed for two nights, over Easter. Expectations are always high when you stay in a hotel with such notoriety, and they were exceeded. Location is great, room was immaculate and service outstanding. Bed felt like you were lying on a cloud, reminded me of the ones at Qualia, even better than 5 star chain hotels. Check out Guy Ritchie's Punchbowl five minutes walk away. This was my first stay in Mayfair, it is a short cab from Paddington if you get the Heathrow Express. Very posh area but nice to stroll near the hotel, parks,etc. We landed at 1810 and we were standing at reception at 1920. You could have sat at breakfast for a long time, not cheap, but helped my hangover. High ratio of staff to guest, if you want something, you will not have to wait long for it. The only thing I would change is to have tea making facilities in the room. With jetlag, sometimes you do not want to have to call room service at 2am for a chamomile tea. Recommended bars - W Hotel, Soho House and The Wellington in Knightsbridge.",5,2011,05,06
130,fab stay,"Loved The Dorchester, certainly lived up to my expectations. Food, service and room were perfect, especially impressed with the bed linen - apparently from a company something like the best bed linen in the world - sublime! All in all made a business trip very enjoyable.",5,2011,05,04
130,2nd wedding anniversary treat,My husband and I were married in the Dorchester in 2009 and choose to spend each anniversary back at the hotel. We took advantage of the Easter offer and stayed for one night over the bank holiday weekend. The doorman was helpful and friendly and offered to see if our room was ready early but as we had breakfast booked elsewhere we decided to check in that afternoon. We were checked in by a friendly guy at reception who welcomed us back and took us to a lovely room with a park view where the team had layed on champagne and strawberries for us to celebrate. We had a wonderful cocktail in the bar and breakfast in the promenade where the staff made us feel very special and welcome. Great treat for a special occassion.,5,2011,05,04
130,Embodies the highest service values.....NOT!,"Having stayed at other Dorchester Collection Hotels in the past (such as the Beverly Hills Hotel), we were very excited about staying at the Dorchester in London as this was our first trip to the UK and this hotel boasts on it's web site that it ""embodies the highest service values"".  I beg to differ!  Upon arriving after 20 plus hours of traveling from Hawaii, we were told by a very young looking Eric (at reception) that our room was not ready.  This surprised us, as we were not asking to check-in early (it was already about 3PM in the afternoon London time) and we saw other VIP travelers being checked-in (I will drop a name here...Jane Seymour the actress).  We were not even offered a complimentary drink at the bar or a room to freshen up in, as other hotels of this 5 star standard usually do when your room is not ready.  So trying not to be ""Ugly Americans"" (even though we felt the need to shower and very jet lagged) we said nothing and took about a 1 hour walk in nearby Hyde Park.   When we returned, fully expecting to be checked-in, we were again told that our room was not ready.  Being totally exhausted at this point, we sat in the beautiful lobby and promptly fell asleep. Sometime later, we were woken up, escorted up to our room and dumped.  The room was nice (not great) and the bathroom exquisite but the damage was already done, being that first impressions are everything.  We were not even offered an apology of any type for any of our inconvenience.  I think if the management of the Dorchester is going to let teenagers drive the Rolls- Royce of hotels, so to speak, they should at least give them a few driving lessons first.  We found London to be a one of the most wonderful cities that we have ever visited....so don't stay here if you truly want to experience the true warmth and hospitality of this great city and her people.",2,2011,05,01
130,very nearly perfect,"We stayed recently for some well deserved R&R and overall we had a great time,  we took advantage of the spa for a massage and dined one evening at Alain Ducasse both of which were excellent. All staff were courteous and unfailingly polite.

2 things meant that my praise is not unreserved - irrespective of what I am paying for a room I would like to have the facility to make myself a tea or a coffee and not have to order it through room service.

Also breakfast was very nice and waitered service with no notepad is very impressive but on both days the staff got our order wrong, not a major problem but with 12% service charge I'd expect better.

Minor quibbles though as I say overall it was great",4,2011,04,26
130,Excellent as always,"Have stayed at the Dorchester a few times usually in a suite but this time in a single room as it was a quick business visit.
Everything is perfect here, the staff are certainly very professional and can't do enough for you. Everything is of the highest standard as you would expect for the price you pay.
My only negative comment would be that we couldn't get a drink after getting back to the hotel at 1.30-2PM. It would have been nice to finish off the night in the bar & when I asked about it I was simply told it was shut.
Nevermind-it wouldn't stop me going there again!",5,2011,04,24
130,Good location for tourists,"On the West End, a good location for tourists.  The price is a little high, but this is London.  Rooms better than others in the UK.  Service is excellent.",4,2011,04,23
130,Great when not in Summer as room air-conditioning poor,"I've stayed a numerous amount of times, sometimes just for a break, other times for special occasions. All the other reviewers comments are correct, wonderful place, staff in all areas tend to be very customer focused and make an effort to make your stay perfect from check-in to housekeeping to restaurant teams. A special note is Hadi in the reception team, I only stay sporadically in the hotel on and off and yet he's always made me welcome and always made me feel at home and if he's on duty, the first to say ""Welcome back! Nice to see you again"".

Rooms large by London standards, a bit twee some of the rooms decor, bathtubs are lovely and deep and beds are very comfortable. Their SPA is GORGEOUS and lovely way to pass an afternoon very quickly. Afternoon tea was average but Grill was nice. 

One niggling thing that has occurred a few times in my stay, there is one area/wing of the hotel where the air-conditioning struggles to perform in the rooms there during summer. If I get rooms in that wing, always the air-conditioning doesn't work and I lose a night's worth of sleep as it's very warm because I think that side of the building gets the full blast of the afternoon heat on a hot day and it's doesn't cool down by night. Often when you walk out of your room, you find the corridors cooler.

I've made that known to the reception team upon check-out each time it's happened and they always say they will follow up and invariably I find that the next time, I'm re-allocated back to that wing and I get hit by the same problem. I think I have to start tracking what room numbers I find this problem in and ensure that I'm not stuck in that wing. It's just hard that I have to recall that each time and I'm surprised no one else has raised this compliant especially in summer.

On the last time in March when I stayed, I had to change rooms late at night (around 1am) as it was unbearably warm and the lady (Oriental, I didn't catch her name) who come to attend to me from the front desk was so apologetic and helpful and even moved my heavy suitcase by herself without waiting to call for the concierge. She was also unwilling to take a tip from me saying she was sorry I had to move rooms so late at night. So I have to say kudos to the team for their service and customer focus......just sort out that air-conditioning or else avoid putting me in those rooms.......I'm very sensitive to heat.:-)",4,2011,04,20
130,Pure luxury!,Stayed at the hotel for 1 night as a birthday celebration. Got a £660 room for £360 on Booking.com. We were upgraded on arrival. First class reception service. Room was lovely with lots of attention to detail. Breakfast was lovely - room service was a nice treat (£35 pp). A wonderful experience.,5,2011,04,17
130,Scary and old room for more of  1.000 GBP,"Scary junior suite with old facilities with poor view from the window,  .... 
Over 1000 pounds a day!
 In addition to the credit card was charged 2 times",1,2011,04,15
130,The bar,"One of several bars in the hotel, very good drinks, music OK and not too loud, ugly interior and the waiters are way too pushy: your glass is not yet empty when they already ask what you want to drink; clear instructions from management to boost the consumption??!!!",4,2011,04,13
130,fabulous hotel,"Ive stayed at the dorchester many times and even had a week here for christmas a couple of years back, a charming hotel very exclusive and I love china teng one of the restaurants especially the whole aromatic duck which is carved at the table for you...very lovely for special occasions and a nice bar too",5,2011,03,20
130,FANTASTIC STAY,"I was the luckiest girl in the world on my 40th birthday in Jan 20111 my lovely boyfriend treated me to a night stay at the Dorchester in London , the staff were fantastic all the staff that is,  absolutely next to none. We had dinner at the grill restaurant which was lovely and I was also treated to a birthday cake surprise. We had cocktails in the promonade room and also in the bar all together a fantastic time would recommend to all and would without a doubt return for another treat",5,2011,03,19
130,Anachronistically fantastic,"This is it! It is the ideal prototype of the ultra-best 5-start hotel imaginable, something that essentially is no longer there -- except for the Dorchester.",5,2011,03,14
130,"Elegant, stylish and classy","I recently stayed at the Dorchester for the first time with my husband, not for a special occasion just to enjoy some time together without the children.  From the moment I booked with the lovely manager of reservations, I won't mention her name in fear of embarrassing her, it was clear this hotel was one that took great pride and care ensuring every guest is perfectly looked after.  
We had booked a standard room but on arrival were treated to a complimentry upgrade and our room was magnificent.  Extremely comfortable beds and a bath so deep you could only just see out the top!  That evening we dined at Alain Ducasse and the meal was outstanding, the food tasted exquisite and the staff were professional but friendly the perfect mix.  This hotel still retains the one thing that many other grand hotels in London have lost and that's class.  It's not just in the lovely furnishings and gorgeous food, although that obviously helps, it's more in the making every guest feel welcome and special and that is where the Dorchester exceeds expectations.  
Having read a review below of the doorman, I feel compelled to add that they took great care of my husbands car, ( his 4th baby) and were extremely charming every time we arrived or left the hotel.  So all in all a glowing review and I would definately recommend this hotel to couples seeking a romantic break.  I am returning in April with my family for an overnight visit and am looking forward to seeing how they cope with my young children...",5,2011,03,11
130,Special Place!,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Dorchester for a weekend as a birthday treat. It's somewhere that we've always wanted to stay and I have to say that I was apprehensive about whether or not it would live up to expectations. 
Suffice to say that it managed to exceed our expectations in almost every way and then some more!
It really is the little things that make the difference between somewhere being good or great and the Dorchester staff go out of their way to make you feel special. They genuinely appear to be proud of their hotel and they really want their guests to enjoy the experience of staying with them.
Everything from the cutlery, to the crockery to the beds to the tolietries to the food to the ambience is special. Yes it's expensive. Yes it's probably (for most people) only for special occasions but you really do get value for your money. 
We've stayed at a lot of truly great hotels around the world but this is almost certainly the best. It's got tradition and style in spades but it's also got character and you really do feel like a welcome guest - it isn't snooty in the way that some grand hotels can be.
I'd definitely recommend a stay if you can afford it.",5,2011,03,07
130,Wonderful Experience,"We booked to stay at The Dorchester to celebrate a very,very special event.  We also booked Lunch at The Grill for our family.  What can we say?  It was a wonderful experience.  Absolutley every member of staff was gracious, welcoming and attentive in the extreme.  The hotel had upgraded our booking, beyond our imagination and it really added to this special day.  We have stayed in a few luxury hotels around the world, but The Dorchester topped them all.  Thank you to everyone concerned.",5,2011,03,02
130,Excellence,"The best thing i can really remember about what made the Dorchester hotel very special is the staff
extremely friendly staff, very helpful, very polite, and extremely nice
rooms are very clean, everything was great
i enjoyed my stay there",5,2011,02,26
130,What a hotel...,The Dorchester is an incredible hotel. I loved my stay and the rooms are all beautiful. Best hotel in London by a clear margin.,5,2011,02,23
130,car parking,i had a function to go to over christmas so i asked the doorman if he could park my car yes sir of course its a £30. i thought this was a bit steep and asked were are you going to park it. in our garage sir ok  so off i went to the function later in the evening i went outside for a smoke and had a walk round the block to find my car parked on a side street. the doorman wear green but sould wear black and white strips bunch of crooks it's a lovely hotel and the outlets are great just don't ask the doorman to park your car!,4,2011,02,22
130,An amazing hotel,"Stayed at the Dorchester for my husbands birthday in Feb.

The plus - we travelled with our 5 month old daughter. All of us were made to feel welcome,
Doorman - friendly and very helpful especially when it came to moving the pushchair in and out the property.
Reception - Polite and effecient as it should be.
Promenade restaurant - on the whole very friendly great for people watching. Breakfast was excellent no buffet but if you ask they have almost everything...(its the asking thats the problem, since its not clear from the menu what is included in each rate) 
We had high tea there, which I am talking to the hotel about seperately.
The housekeeping staff were very friendly nothing was too much trouble and they took care to provide everything for the baby.
On the whole this is a fantastic hotel, passionate staff and a fab location for shopping / sight seeing in london.
Could become my default place to stay in the future - its amazing.",5,2011,02,20
130,Stayed Mar 2010 for my 60th,"I stay with my daughter and grandaughter last year for my 60th for 2 nights -  loved every minute and have re-booked for my 61st which is coming up in a few weeks. The staff made us feel quite special. 

 We used the spa facilites, had a facial, and again the service was excellent.

Can't wait to return.",5,2011,02,18
130,great location for a magical weekend,we spent an anniversary weekend at the dorchester. we booked a junior suite but were upgraded to THE  very grand Oliver Messel Suite which offered spectacular views of London from Hyde Park to Big Ben. The view from the wrap around terrace was breathtaking. The staff were attentive and the concierge was extremely helpful in securing us a reservation that night at Alain Ducasse as we were on a waiting list. Although the hotel is very traditional this grand dame has been superbly renovated to its former splendour. Our weekend was magical..  we walked everywhere and the weather was wonderful.,5,2011,02,15
130,Superb!,"My daughter  started her new job in the City ,January this year  .  She treated me to the Dinner at the Grill from her first paycheck  . She is not earning an huge amount so it had to be very special - it was . Hotel , dinning room  and especially the staff made it a very memorable evening . We have been very fortunate to stay in some amazing places but in our opinion  The Dorchester is on of the best hotels in the world .",5,2011,01,29
130,Party in the Orchid Room- and 2nd stay at the DORCH;),"Hello what can I say, 

I love the promenade- feel like a star, I walk and feel like a million dollars. 
I have close friends who party at the dorch on regular basis- and who have booked me rooms here-, first stay fantastic,ordered room service at 4am and got a piping hot piuzza within 15 mins! brill the bathrooms are amazing love the floris range especially the oil, and cute grey and white slippers I had each time. 

However- after my friend booked me a room here, for the party they were hosting down stairs, I decided to go shopping and a quick cigarette before coming back to my room to get ready, only to find a very snoopy room cleaner in my room, looking through my suitcase (i could clearly tell had been rummaged through) and and clothes esp my suit pockets pulled out, which I was quite shocked too see, i didnt really know what to say I walked in and just put my key down- black plastic key thing with D on it, and said could you please leave as I need to get ready. After that i got ready and quite luckily came back in time as did have some valuables in my suitcase, since then I have never been back other then to the restaurant china tang, i felt let down but did not want to say anything to my friend as it was her party and I also believe she has close links with the hotel. but overall very glam, and clean. 

left undecided now

would i recommend? this is the next question id say yes, but my experience has defo left me slightly undecided- im sure it was a one off incident- but it still makes you think, what could have gone missing if I did not come back in time.",4,2011,01,18
130,Simply wonderful,"We stayed at The Dorchester for a long weekend and as this was my first time in London, we wanted to stay somewhere special.  The entrance is truely beautiful and as we stayed the week before Christmas, the decorations were fabulous, complete with a lovely grotto area.  Our room was not ready, so we had a drink at the bar and were then shown to our room, where there was a complimentary bottle of champagne. We stayed in a executive room and had a separate dressing room, a fabulous bathroom with the biggest bath ever, and a huge room overlooking Hyde park, complete with four poster bed.  We had afternoon tea on The Promenade, very elegant and a lovely experience, the scones in particular were good.  They boxed the rest of the cakes as we were too full.  We also dined at the Alaine Duccasse and the China Tsang, both highly recommended but the food at Alaine Duccasse was sumblime. We had breakfast on The Promenade and also in The Grill which again, I cannot fault.  We drank wonderful cocktails in both bars and enjoyed listening to the choir one afternoon and live band another night.

I cannot wait to go back here, my experience was one of utter luxury.  The hotel is impeccably clean, the staff are polite and attentive and you feel like royalty.  If you enjoy luxury, quality and a wonderful service, this hotel is for you.",5,2011,01,09
130,VERY DISAPPOINTING BADLY MANAGED,"My partner and I stayed at the Dorchester on Jan 1st and 2nd. We checked in as usual and the receptionist (male) took us on a tour as it was our first visit, and one I was really looking forward to. He advised us of the signature restaurants at the hotel namely China Tsang and Alain Ducasse. We went for a nap in the evening and as we rose late around 9pm we decided to eat at the China Tsang which had been recommended. We were badly received and had to signal to the waiter to come and take our order.My partner ordered hot and sour soup &Lemon Chicked and I ordered Prawn stir fry. We knew the moment we got our dishes that it would be disappointing. The Soup was like glue. My partner tried a few spoons hoping it would get better but it didn't. The chicken was old and of the plastic type you get in very cheap chinese. My prawn dish was tasteless and covered in some clear gluey texture again with a side portion of the worst black bean sauce I have ever had. As we were very hungry we actually ate a few bites, once again hoping it would get better. It didn't. It was awful. We didn't complain at the restaurant as we are not complainers by nature. We went upstairs to the hotel bar to have a few drinks. However we had to ask for soda water and my partner had to go and walk outside for an hour to relieve himself of severe indigestion and upset tummy. The following morning we were still not feeling well and we had to have further upset tummy remedies. Later that afternoon I decided I should say something to a manager as we had suffered so much. I asked the receptionist could I see a manager. She sent out a duty manager to me ( cant remember his name but he had blond hair) I advised him of our experience. All he said was ""oh China Tsang has nothing to do with the hotel they just rent the hotel space"" I advised him that it was recommended when we checked in as one of the Hotel Restaurants. He had no response. I actually grew up in the hotel business so I would have dealt with instances in my experience. The normal practice would be to apologise 
profusely and make an attempt to compensate for the dissatisfaction the guest has experienced. This did not happen. We heard nothing more from management and check out the following day. We had arranged to stay on in London another few nights and we would have gladly extended our stay had we been treated properly so we checked into another hotel nearby and had a wonderful stay. My advice is to stay at Claridges or The Levin. Management is competent and reacts to guests needs/preferences.
I would not be able to recommend this hotel to anyone.",3,2011,01,07
130,World Class,"The Dorchester is one of the best hotels in the world. Everytime I stay they seem to be trying to improve a very good product. Standard of service seems to be improving!
The food in the Dorchester Grill Room was exceptional. I appreciate that this isn't the cheapest hotel but you most definitely get what you pay for.",5,2011,01,06
130,"Excellent Hotel, friendly staff and excellent service, rooms and afternoon tea","I recently (14th November) stayed for two nights at the Dorchester and I have to say it was a fantastic hotel. I would say from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated very well and the staff are friendly and helpful.

I was travelling alone and tried out the 'in room' dining - what a treat! The best room service food I have ever had (actually better than a lot of top restaurants, I want to try out theirs next!)  it was wonderful and again the staff bringing it to the room amazing as nothing was too much trouble. As a women on her own I was made to feel very comfortable and the service was spot on - thank you!

I also had 4 treatments in the Spa again the staff were great and the treatments lovely. I run my own massage training school and I would say they have a wonderful Spa which I would highly recommend.

I also treated myself to afternoon tea which again was wonderful, I was joined by a friend and we had a lovely afternoon enjoying the sandwiches and tea. One thing I would say is sometimes when you are in a restaurant and you get no service which drives you mad the Dorchester however is the opposite! You find the staff are constantly coming up to you asking if everything is ok. I would say as lovely as they are maybe it was over kill and hard to have a conversation with your friend when getting interrupted every few minutes - a minor thing but something that could be improved upon. However friendly service is better (even if it is a little intrusive) than no service at all!!

The only negative thing I would agree with other reviews is the smell of smoke. I am allergic to smoke and even though I requested a non smoking room it must have been used for smoking before or they allow people to smoke in the corridors (not good) as I found it hard to sleep with the smell of smoke which gives me bad headaches which was unfortunate.

However I did feel the need to write a good review as I recently stayed at the Ritz and it was terrible. The staff were unfriendly rude and the room was freezing and their heating system was too old to cope. The Dorchester however no such problem great heating system nice and cosy and the staff were amazing. Just a shame about the smoky room which ruined it a bit for me but I hope if I return that can be sorted out.

I would recommend this hotel as it is beautiful and the staff are spot on - even if you just treat yourself to afternoon tea you won't be disappointed. Avoid the Ritz for afternoon tea it is cheap and not worth the money and the staff are rude - my tip go to the Dorchester instead they are far nicer!

130,Just average for price,"I would give it a two-and-a-half star rating, were there such a thing as a half star on Tripadvisor. 
My wife and I stayed overnight in the world's biggest traffic jam, otherwise known as London, to visit my family.   The Dorchester was a hotel I was longing to try, as I belived it was possibly the best London had to offer, plus we regularly stay at hotels of the same group, and trust the brand. 
After the initial excitement of seeing the famous art deco  façade of the building, I was quickly underwhelmed when entering the jam-packed reception area and foyer.
The staff were trying to cope as well as they could with the amount of demands and request thrown at them, but were clearly short of personnel. They try to remain polite, but looked understandably stressed.
Checking in at three o'clock, the receptionist was unable to tell me if our room was ready or not.  He nervously dialed his phone no less than five times to try to reach houskeeping, but could reach no one. With an embarrased smile he suggested that we went to have a drink and came back in twenty minutes. Fortunately we had reserved two spa treatment for that time and headed there directly. A good thing since the main foyer looked as hellish as Harrods during the first day of sale. That's saying a lot.

We finally got the room. No upgrade, which I normally get when booking via Amex platininum, but the hotel was full,  so fair enough. 
The room was an executive, supposedly the best category there is before suites.
 Well, I found it dark and dreary, overlooking the uggliest set of noisy pipes. The decoration reminded me of provincial english hotel of some twenty years ago, with brownish/beige heavy floral patern. There was not enough lights in the room, adding to the gloom, and due to the 30's archicture, there were lots of strange triangular angles. A feng shui's nightmare!
On the plus side the bathroom was vast and most attractive, with its very deep bath tub, seperate shower, and wonderful Floris toiletries.
When shown into the room I was also offered tea,  which was a nice touch.
We enjoyed the spa, and the treatments which were good. 

I was not too keen on the main bar of the Dorchester, which at about 6 o'clock doubles up as an after office-hour drinks,  and fills with flash lads and girls who, though polyester-suited, boasted loudly to eachother about thier great success at work and in life in general. Good for them!

Late in the evening we went to the other bar, the China Tang, which although very crowded, was good fun and looked like a  30's film set.  The cocktails were marvelous, the service excellent
We then dined in the China Tang.  Summed up, it's just another chinese restaurant, just three or four times more expensive.  I did not enjoy my evening there.

So there we are;  I left the Dorchester with no more than a lukewarm impression, feeling that I had paid overall too much for what I got in return. The only two positive points of the place is its location, hard to beat,  and the doormen/porters who did a fantastic job in finding cabs, when there were  queues of people waiting.

Next time, we'll try the newly renovated Savoy",3,2010,12,28
130,My favourite hotel in London,"If you want five star service and old fashioned British glamour you won't go far wrong here. Rooms are a decent size for London, bathrooms are huge, elegantly appointed with fabulous full sized Floris toiletries. Ok it could all do with a little updating and i wasn't a fan of the cigarette smoke smell in the hallways but the service more than made up for these little issues. You are made to feel like a queen the minute you step inside, service is impeccable, they can even organise paying your congestion charge for you, a service i imagine is invaluable to foreign visitors who might be somewhat baffled by this ridiculous road tax. Best of all it is home to my favourite restaurant in London - Alain Ducasse - well worthy of it's three Michelin stars for the dessert trolly alone.",5,2010,12,26
130,Festive Champagne Afternoon Tea - Self Service,"We arrived promptly on time to be told that we had booked for 2 people and not four, which was not correct and I had booking confirmation. I was told to wait to one side and we would be seated when they could find extra space.

The surroundings and ambience are very impressive and luxurious but the service was non existent. As a regular guest of Claridges, I have high expectations as they never fail to impress.

We had to ask for everything. Tea didn't arrive until an hour after we sat down and even then it was placed on the table until we had to pour it ourselves. There was also an hour wait for a glass of water and I had to ask for a knife that at one point I wanted to go looking for myself.

Cakes eventually arrived but by this time we didn't have time to eat them and had to leave.

The staff were polite but just too busy.

It's back to Claridges!",3,2010,12,22
130,fairytale,"just perfect

was there with my boyfriend and we were treated like Lords

I loved the high tea",5,2010,12,16
130,Christmas champagne afternoon tea,"I visited the Dorchester today for afternoon tea, with my mother and sister. We have been visiting as a Christmas treat for over 10 years and it never fails to impress. The staff are always exceptionally professional, polite and above all appear to be genuinely concerned that you enjoy your experience. Fantastic - would recommend without hesitation.",5,2010,12,13
130,What a great place to be stranded,Our connection to Barcelona was cancelled due to snow so our travel agent set us up here for the night.  We had a wonderful time and it was a great location for such a short stay.,5,2010,12,07
130,The dorchester -Afternoon tea,"Absoloutely amazing , the very best ever. We didnt want it to end. My daughter and myself go to afternoon tea every year on the same weekend every year. We have been to The Savoy, fortnum and masons and the Ritz so far.. The dorchester beat them all hands down. The service was fab from the girls at the entrance to our lovely waiter Daniel serving us sandwiches and more sandwiches!! There was no snobbery (unlike the Ritz which wasnt friendly at all) It was regal and sooo tasteful and elegant but welcoming. Spot on.Even with people walking in with Uggs and heavy winter clothing and getting chasnged in the ladies rest rooms they were fine and quite expected it due to the horrendous cold weather unlike the Ritz which looked down on us very much so.Added to the fact Dawn French was sat there as was a famous Male italian Tenor, who they unfortunately would give us his name .. Fab fab fab..... cant wait to go back next year...",5,2010,12,06
130,Love that High Tea,"Staying at the Dorchester is something I will talk about for the rest of my life. The people who are regulars at this hotel are a glamourous set so it's memorable.The High Tea service at the Dorchester is something everyone should have at least once in their life. It's heavenly.

The Dorchester has so much staff that they do mess up the details. If you speak to someone who goes off duty you start from scratch again with the next person. The Dorchester picked us up in their car, drove us to the hotel, and then told me at the front desk my reservation was for another year. So why did you pick me up for the airport today? 

Everything was eventually fixed but the airport service never bothered to mention the hotel was  under the impression we were arriving in 2012. A case of the right hand not speaking to the left. While our reservation was being fixed I was made to sit on the couch like I was in a time out for bad behavior.  No offer of food etc. Had I not had my confirmation e-mail on my Ipad I believe I would have been sent away. 

Room service at the hotel is extremely over priced and then they would go and  forget a  part of our order. Wifi should be free and not 20 plus pounds a night.  The hotel arranged our train tickets and made me go downstairs to get them. The concierge didn't return phone calls promptly. I had to call him back. 

Other reviewers have commented on the decor. The print that hung in our room is the same print/basket of flowers hanging in my co-traveller's mother's dinning room in Tampa, Florida. The Dorchester Hotel should have real art.  If it's made it's way to suburban Floridan it's not high English? 

This is a business hotel.We were the only guests to frequent the theater desk and ask for directions to museums. They look at you kind of goofy when you ask for directions to tacky tourist things. Overall a memorable experience that could only happen in England. Staying at the Dorchester makes for a great story to tell friends.",5,2010,12,05
130,Very very disappointed - maggots in my room,"I was sent a review to complete after my stay which I completed straight away as I had found a disgusting maggot in my fruit in the room and I was very disappointed. My response was ignored.  I was at the hotel this week for an awards ceremony and just asked to sit down for 2 minutes to have a cup of tea as I was waiting for a very important customer - the waiter was rude, quite agressive and I felt awful. He just wanted me out of the way as quickly as possible. I went into the bar area and a cordon was put up in a section which fell on me and eventually I found a seat but hurt my leg in the process not to mention felt embrarassed. Needless to say I couldnt meet my customer there as there wasnt enough room in the corner. I took my customer elsewhere but it was truly upsetting and I felt like a second class citizen.  This is not what I had expected. I hope you do listen to this message!",3,2010,12,04
130,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH ALAIN DUCASSE,"We made a reservation for the Alain Ducasse restaurant on the 12th of November at 8.30 pm for 4 people.On arrival we contacted reception who pointed us to the bar in the main entrance hall where all seats where take,i therefore went to the two young ladies on the entrance to the restaurant to inform them of our arrival at 8pm,they also pointed to the bar area that was full, i then cleared the glasses myself and rearranged the chairs so we had someone to sit not assistance was offered by any member of staff.
After being seated know one came to us for over 10 minutes so i stood at the bar without any response to get some drinks,eventually a waiter arrived very embarrassed by the whole situation.
We entered the restaurant and the service was exceptional throughout the whole meal.
The food was another stories tasteless and three dishes covered in white truffle making the food sickly ,even the cheese course contained truffle,the main came which was beef and this was pale and insipid we guessed this had being cooked in a water bath so again was tasteless and slimy 
The whole meal experience was a huge disappointment by all our party,just the week before we had eaten at Le Manoir which was in a different class and deserved its Michelin stars, the Dorchester in my experience did not deserve any!! 
CWM LEEDS",2,2010,11,30
130,An overall pleasant experience,"I am used to staying in top luxury hotels around the world.  

My recent stay in the Dorchester was overall a good experience.  I arrived a quite early in the morning and the hotel did their best to check me in around 10 AM.  Check in staff were quite attentive and professional and I was also quite impressed with the Concierge since I sent them a list of top London restaurants a week before my arrival and I received confirmations for all of the 7 restaurants within 2 hours of sending my email.

With regards to rooms, I stayed in a King Deluxe room, which was spacious with a nice bathroom with strongest water pressure I ever seen, but I think the rooms need renovation sometime soon.

In general, the hotel has a high standard of service and the Spa is also amazing.  The only setback in this hotel is the promenade, which is the sitting area in the Lobby. Firstly, they ask you, if you are having lunch or afternoon tea and if not they wouldn’t bother to give you a table.  I invited guests there a couple of times for lunch and in both times, I was given the bill without asking for it in a very rude manner.  When I asked, they said that the table was booked for other guests.  What was surprising is that I came back to the same table 45 minutes later and it was empty and there were plenty of other tables empty.  This was very disappointing from a hotel that claims to be one of the best in London.

A couple of other minor points, I ordered one banana for breakfast and was charged 10 pounds for the banana.  In addition, they charged french-fries separate from any sandwich you ordered, which was the first time I have seen this ever.  The issue here is not money (My bill was £5,000, but since the guest is paying a hefty amount of money, the hotel shouldn’t give them the feeling that they are being overcharged unnecessarily. 

With the exception of the promenade issue, the rest are minor issues and I would still call this hotel one of the best in London, if not the best.  If you like large hotels (Non boutique).  The only hotel that I would put in the same category is the Mandarin Oriental.  However, no hotel in London has achieved the level of service of Plaza Athénée or Le Marais which are the part of the Dorchester connection.

In general,  it was a quite pleasant experience",5,2010,11,25
130,Outstanding in Every Respect,"We stayed at The Dorchester for one night to celebrate my wife's birthday with some family members.  From the time we arrived to Christmas carols in the promenade, to the time we left, everything was perfect.  The staff were very friendly and helpful whilst at the same time being professional and efficient.  Alain Ducasse, where we ate dinner, was expensive but extremely good and very much worthy of a special occasion meal.  Faultless.",5,2010,11,23
130,Stay at a boutique hotel instead,"The Dorchester is a grand old hotel but is showing its age.  Our room was tiny and felt like it needed some updating.

The Dorchester has a few major drawbacks - 1. they still allow smoking in many of the rooms and it spills out into the hallways  2. after 11 the bar is overtaken by working ladies and the hotel seemingly allows it  3.  Try getting a cup of coffee as you are running out to get a cab.",2,2010,11,23
130,Perfect in every detail,"The Dorchester is as fantastic and flawless a hotel as I have ever enjoyed.  

The hotel is beautiful, the service is excellent, the food is delicious--none of this is news, so here are some details I appreciated on my last visit:

-my room was beautifully lit (and with the nicest/most like incandescent CFL energy bulbs I've ever seen)
-The silverware at my meals was beautiful, reminded me of George Jensen's 
-The wallpaper in my room was real, printed wallpaper
-The B&O TV and Bose iphone/CD player were flawlessly incorporated in my room
-I really like the Floris bath soaps here—citrus, mint, and lavender 
-instead of note pads, the hotel provides thick cards (like place cards or invitations) and nice pens
-the welcome, macaroons, and chocolate were beautiful and very tasty

and a couple of things I wish had been automatically provided (and free):
-internet access 
-water by my bed in the evening

My experience with the Dorchester (and Dorchester Hotels in general) is that they are more thoughtfully luxurious and more enjoyable than any other group of hotels.  Everything is slightly (or substantially) better than at four seasons, mandarin oriental, or Rosewood hotels.  The dorchester does a wonderful job of celebrating it's character, location, and history while providing the best contemporary service.  I love staying here.",5,2010,11,21
130,"Fantastic,Marvellous,Superb 5 stars in all its glory.","We had stayed at the Park Plaza Riverbank for 2 nights,prior to going to The Dorchester.
On our arrival outside the Dorchester you are met by a very welcoming doorman,who asked if we were checking in,as we already knew that check in was 3.00pm and we arrived at 10.00am,so we would have the concierge take our suitcase.The doorman said thats okay I'll take it and send it to our room when we check in.Easy.
Anyway off we went and came back about 4.00pm,when I booked I'd said that it was the wifes birthday.I was keeping my fingers crossed we would be blessed with a room upgrade?
At reception we were welcomed and informed that yes indeed we had a room upgrade.The receptionist took us up to the 6th floor,and led us to our room.Followed immediately by our suitcase etc.
To say the bedroom was nice would be an understatement,it was marvellous.It was we think a King deluxe,the bed was the size of a room.You didn't appreciate how big the bed was until you got onto it to sleep,.The room itself is what you'd expect from such an iconic hotel.Also forgot to say that there was a small Birthday cake in the room waiting for the wife- marvellous once again.
The bathroom was fantastic all marble and mirrors,with every luxury you would want,a very large towel rail,toileteries etc.
The room itself looked over Hyde Park,the tree's still had some glorious golden leaves left on,being a little further south from us.
The previous night (Saturday)we had come to the Dorchester to dine at Alain Ducasse,which we expected to be very nice and expensive.We weren't disapointed at all,very expensive and superb food,some of which was memorable.The service in this restaurant is something else,nothing was too much trouble,the staff were there at your beck and call.The somellier was very good,informative,knowledgable but not pushy,very pleasant and helpful.
We can't speak highly enough of this restaurant,we've tried lots of good restaurants over the years,but had never dined at a 3 Michelin starred place.You can understand why it has 3 of them,and we can say perhaps the best we've been to.
On the Sunday evening we dined at the grill,this was also exemplary in respect of service
perhaps not as good as AD,but again what you'd expect of a 5 star hotel.The food itself was very nice,perhaps a little expensive but again something we knew of before we booked.Plus another birthday cake for the wife,which we took away with us.
Breakfast again was great,the service was impeccable and food of usual 5 star standard.
We can't speak/rate the Dorchester highly enough,to say we enthuse about the place and our visit,would be the usual understatement.
If you are ever looking for a beautiful experience,memorable visit,special occasion then you've found the place.If you can't afford it,save for it. It'll repay you with respect and fond memories.
We were going to stay at the Savoy,but Gordon Ramsay's grill room wasn't to be opened until late November.He the did the Savoy a diservice by opening late,but in doing so gave  us the opportunity to sample the delights of The Dorchester.
And to write a 5star review as a  result
Thank you The Dorchester and all the staff that served us.",5,2010,11,19
130,Wonderful Stay,"This was a one-night stay at The Dorchester.  The hotel looked beautiful from the outside.  Doormen attentive and took our luggage and helped us into the hotel lobby. Staff at reception very helpful and escorted us to our room.  The room was very, very clean. Beautifully decorated in 'English' style. The bed was huge with the most comfortable pillows I have ever had. Wonderful Bose sound system and B&O TV.  The bathroom was white marble with excellent Floris shampoo, bath oil etc. and soft white towels, bathrobes and slippers.  We dined in The Grill - experienced, knowledgeable staff who were very attentive but now overpowering.  The food was excellent , the decor wonderful and flower arrangements everywhere.  Drinks followed in the Cocktail Bar.  Did not want to leave the next day. Very homely feeling - for a short while the hotel became our 'home'.  Would I return - Oh yes.  (Have stayed at many 5star hotels worldwide and would definitely recommend this hotel - its history and location are top rate, staff and service excellent.  It was a truly wonderful experience to celebrate my Birthday).",5,2010,11,19
130,A complete let down. The WORST hotel I have ever stayed at.,"I was incredibly excited to stay at the Dorchester as it is a legendary hotel. I have been to London many times but I usually stay at the Baglioni or The Berkeley. My travel agent convinced me that the Dorchester was worth a stay and that the red carpet would certainly be rolled out upon my arrival. I had arranged for my travel agent to book me a suite and was very specific that I wanted an art deco suite; nothing too country cottage style. He assured me the Dorchester would deliver. I arrived at the hotel late in the evening and was escorted to my suite quickly. Upon entering the room I am immediately disappointed to see that although I have been given a suite, it is completely styled in country cottage decor. I politely make my displeasure known only to get the response that I had been upgraded and that no other suites were available for that evening. This was completely unacceptable. For a hotel with such a reputation as the Dorchester they should live up to their reputation and serve to satisfy their guests. I had specifically arranged NOT to have this type of suite. There are many luxury hotels in London that would love to have my business. Why should I pay 900 GBP a night for a suite I do not want to stay in? After absolutely refusing to stay in the suite I was given I was moved to an art deco suite that was smaller, dirty, and just plain disgusting! I was shocked that they would actually put someone in that room! I have included pictures in my review to verify. There were hairs that were not mine in the bathroom sink, stains on the drapes and the carpet, chipped and broken furniture, soap scum on the shower door and worst of all the medicine cabinet doors opened up to a crawl space with exposed piping and insulation. I could not believe this was coming from a 5 star hotel. Being that it was already in the AM and I was exhausted, I went to sleep. The next morning I called reception to see if they had any clean suites available. I let them know how upset I was with the conditions of the suite I was in. I was told there were no suites available and that they were sorry the suite did not meet my expectations. So, I quickly made a reservation for the Royal suite over at the Baglioni, where Paul, the concierge, (he is just FAB!) was happy to greet me when I arrived. Before leaving the Dorchester I snapped some photos with my phone and checked out. Upon checking out I complained that the room I spent the night in was horrific and that someone had bungled my reservation. I showed them the photos on my phone and was told that they usually wouldn't put a guest in a room of that condition but since I insisted on an art deco room they had no alternative. They also reduced my rate but I still ended up paying a ridiculous amount for one night in hell.",2,2010,11,16
130,Need a refit,It is ok but only ok. Room very small. Staff not really friendly. Food just average. Bar has no window. Just in front of Hyde park. This is good if you like jogging.,3,2010,11,07
130,Perfect - should be number one in London,"Having stayed at the Hotel 41 last time we were in London, because it was at the top of the Tripadvisor list for London, and being HUGELY underawed by it we thought we'd give the Dorchester a try as it is a name that is synonymous with luxury and quality. We were not disappointed. We stayed in a suite and I really cannot fault it - and I was quite prepared to be very critical because they do know how to charge! But, I really couldn't find any faults. We had a fabulous view, lots of space and it was absolutely spotless. Yes, it is expensive but that's what you would expect. We wanted for nothing throughout our stay. The staff were attentive and helpful without being smothering. The breakfast was excellent (unlike the mess we got at Hotel 41 - I didn't write a review on that hotel because it would have been so negative). The chef at the Dorchester actually managed to produce a poached egg for breakfast that my partner was happy with - it doesn't happen very often because he is very hard to please. It is a lovely place for a weekend treat and we will definitely be back. Thank you Dorchester.",5,2010,11,03
130,Absolute Bliss,"During a stay in London, for a family wedding,  I had the good fortune to stay in a Deluxe Double Room in The Dorchester and it was superb, from the evening turn down (indulgent I know) to 24 hour room service, I could find fault with nothing. The food in the Alain Ducasse restaurant was out of this world and the service was to match. This hotel is utterly fabulous and I would recomment it anyone.",5,2010,10,27
130,Gorgeous Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights as a 40th birthday treat for my partner. We were treated wonderfully & my partner received complimentary champagne in the room, a gift of two Dorchester mugs, & a delicious birthday cake in the Alain Ducasse restaurant. The attention to detail to a special occassion was lovely & greatly appreciated.   

Out entire stay lived up to expectations. All of the staff were extremely professional, friendly, & efficient. Our spa treatments were heavenly, the food in the Alain Ducasse restaurant was exceptional & the breakfasts in the Grill & Promenade were scrumptious!

Our beautiful room was extremely comfortable with a huge bed & all requirements were met.

Yes, it is very expensive, but considereing you are in one of the most famous & exclusive hotels in the world, this is bound to come with a premium. We will certainly be returning as soon as we possibly can! Let's get saving!",5,2010,10,27
130,Not quite as exceptional as we remembered from our last visit,"Not the same as our last visit (in June).  Room was not as beautiful, service not as exceptional.  Dinner was still lovely.",4,2010,10,18
130,Disappointed,"We have been visiting the Dorchester for more than twenty-five years and have always been very impressed by the level of service.  This visit was a distinct disappointment.  

We typically book a suite and this vist was no exception.  We had booked  our suite two months in advance and received an received an acknowledgement. When we arrived we were told that our suite was not ready and they had now idea when during the week we had booked, it would become available.  We were offered an ""upgrade"" to their Audley penthouse but since we had already stayed in one of their other penthouses on a previous vist and were not happy with it, we declined the offer.  Finally at 5 pm the guest relations manager who was helping us finally came up with a Dorchester suite.  ( I have no idea what machinations he had to go through, but he was very helpful.  He even comped  us to dinner at the Grill Room.)  I was upset that we did have a confirmed reservation, I had been in touch with the hotel earlier in the week about particular amenities, and still they could not provide room we reserved with a big fuss on our part.  
Since this was a business trip, we were traveling with two i-phones, a laptop and an i-pad.  I was told by the e-butler that in addition to the normal twenty+ pound internet charge I would have to pay separate chages for wi-fi for each device.  He told me that I could probably argue with the management to avoid these additional charges.  Interestingly enough, when I did try the wifi connection for my i-pad, it did not work.  He then acknowledged that wi-fi connectivity was a problem in this part of the building, i.e. a corner suite.

Room service was extremely disappointing.  Our first morning we ordered an omlet and oatmeal.  Both were cold.  The next morning my husband ordered muelsli it it was good but the portion was miniscule.  We ordered proper brewed tea and pumpkin muffins and were served bag tea and some other kind of unwarmed muffins.  We had wanted to have a tea with friends in their Promenade.  We could not get reservations so I ordered room service for five.  The offered two pots of tea for five people and inadequate sandwiches.  We also seemed to have a ""splenda"" crises.  Every time they served us tea or coffee, only three small sacks of splenda were offered.  It felt like we were going through rationing in wartime London. 

I did write a letter to the manager the day before we left telling him about our disappointmet.  In addition, I filled out their form asking someone is guest relations to contact me with via e-mail or cell phone.  I have not received any contact from the Dorchester.",3,2010,10,17
130,Incredible! Treated like royalty!,"We stayed at The Dorchester for 4 nights over Labor Day weekend, and we were treated like Kings and Queens! It was a fabulous hotel with gorgeous decor and flowers, luxurious linens, great bathroom products, and an unbeatable location central to many great sites and parks--it's close to 2 Tube stations, so it's easy to get around London and to/from the airports from those stops. While there, we ate at the Grill, as well as the Alain Ducasse restaurant. Both had top notch food, service and wine lists. High tea was also a grand experience with champagne, tea, 5 tasty varieties of finger sandwiches, scones and other desserts. The drinks in the bar are pricey, but they are quite unique and fun--the Hibiscus Royale and The Shimmer were my faves--never had anything like those two!

Wireless internet was quite expensive in the room, so we did not opt into that service while there. The gym is somewhat small but has top-notch equipment.",5,2010,10,12
130,"Very nice, but over-rated","We stayed 3 nights at The Dorchester. While the rooms are quite nice and well-supplied, we had a view of an alley and it was extremely expensive. The food wasn't that good either.",4,2010,10,10
130,Classy lady,"My husband and I stayed at the Dorchester for three nights with our two young sons - one of which is only 5 months old.

We had three rooms in total - a one bedroom suite overlooking the front of the hotel and an interconnecting double room for our young son.  Previously we have stayed in the Terrace Suite which is a one bedroom suite overlooking the rear of the hotel and we felt our suite this time had better views.

The Dorchester prides itself on customer service.  My husband exchanged many emails with the booking staff before we even arrived at the hotel and they were always prompt and courteous.  A particular point are the doormen.  They were wonderful, really helpful with our pushchair for our baby, friendly and chatty with our young son and a mine of information.  One of them arranged for a taxi to Hamleys toys in the morning and on our arrival back in the afternoon he came over to see what toys my toddler had acquired!  Great memory, such a personal service.  They always made us feel really welcome.

The suite was nice with french doors opening onto a thin balcony.  You could walk out there, but not sit easily.  It was great to watch the comings and goings at the front of the hotel and to people watch.  Our toddler loved to look at the cars and taxis!  The suite was painted a horrible shade of yellow and I thought it could do with updating, but this is a minor point.

The beds are incredibly comfortable and really wide and spacious.  Puts our bed at home to shame!  The carpet throughout the suite was a uniform beige colour, but it was very clean and well kept.  The only disappointment was that when we arrived in our room and went out onto the balcony there were a number of cigarette butts from a previous occupant.  My husband immediately rang down to the front desk who promised to inform housekeeping (and were very apologetic).  We went for afternoon tea but on our return they were still on the balcony and our toddler was keen to pick them up.  This shouldn't have happened - if you are staying at a hotel which prices itself as part of the elite, then I expect nothing but the best.  It took another phone call to get them picked up.

I used the recently refurbished spa which was wonderful.  Really immaculate and so relaxing.  I had the new mother cocoon which was so relaxing that I fell asleep!  The therapist was great, she didn't want to chat constantly and I could just switch off.

Room service was efficient and food arrived when they said it would.  All the staff in the hotel were very nice to our sons.  We didn't feel uncomfortable staying with two children so young.

The Dorchester is an iconic part of the London hotel scene.  Great central location.  If you have the money and value good service then it is one to book.  Just watch for the cigarette butts....!",4,2010,09,15
130,"Excellent service, good hotel, food average","I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The room was very nice, great toiletries in the bathroom, the only thing that would have been nice is tea / coffee making facilities in the room. The service throughout the hotel was simply excellent. The only thing that let the hotel down was the food, I ate breakfast 3 times, room service once and dinner one evening and every time the food was just ok.",4,2010,09,14
130,What can I say,"We stopped in London for a few nights before heading to our vacation in Ireland.  We decided to stay a few nights here and catch some shows and to really spalsh out on the accomodation.

WOW - This is really something else.  We had heard that many of the stars stay here when in London so thought why not.

The rooms are so fine and elegant that you almost don't want to sleep in the beds.  By the way they are so comfy.  This is a 5 star hotel with a 6 star feeling.  It is a little impersonal as it is a hotel but you quickly get over that when you see the rooms and the location.

We decided to have dinner in the grill room one of the eveings.  I didn't know food tasted this good.  Didn't catch any major stars but we made up for that the following evening in the Iveagh restaurant.

Book in advance here and the Iveagh as otherwise you just wont get in.  Beware it is expensive here but if your looking to stay here then you don't need to worry about your bak balance.

Paul if you read this thanks for the stay and making things so great fo us.",5,2010,09,09
130,An update to my previous review,"Over the few years I've stayed at the Dorchester couple of times. This review reflects my last stay (Dec. 2009) in the hotel.

All in all I found that in terms of service - whether it was concierge, waiters in the restaurants/bars etc.- everything was top-notch. Even better than in my previous visits.

However, the check-in procedure was very strange and almost insulting for two reasons:

(1) I was told that as I had a debit/credit card (which for them was not a REAL credit card I was told) they will precharge the card with 200 pounds for hotel services. In the check-out they will refund the deposit.
(2) They also offered me a room upgrade if I pay some extra (I don't recall the precise sum). However, the difference would have exactly been the same if I had book the better room in the first place.

This was something new in the hotel as I did not experience it in my previous visits. I've travelled a lot in 5-star hotels and to be honest I found both of these precedures very unprofessional and especially precharging the card (after I had spent several thousand pounds on my previous visits to the hotel servoces) was insulting and showing that they don't trust you as a customer.

Just to go to the Claridge's and you truly feel a valued customer where a free room upgrade seems to be a standard procedure (and often to a lovely suite) and your not treated as a second class citizen in the check-in.

This small but an important incident is a pity as a really think that the Dorchester is a high-class hotel where I would love to stay in the future. However, I'm not sure if I would give the hotel another chance - this is up to the hotel management how they treat they customers in the future.",3,2010,09,07
130,A treat in so many ways,"Just went for a night away as wanted a special treat for me and otehr half and this place was perfect.  Good old english charm, worth the money",5,2010,09,03
130,amazing experience,Me and my girlfriend stayed here for one night on our 1 year anniversary and i can truly say it was one of the most wonderful experiences we have shared together.from the service to the room to the decor and wonderful restaraunts inside i can not praise this hotel enough.we had dinner at the grill which was fantastic.great menu and service.Breakfast was also amazing.Great choice and made to perfection.The staff can not do enough for you. We left feeling like royalty and will be returning again on our next anniversary.,5,2010,08,30
130,Sensational Service - Just as long as money is no object.,"Without doubt this hotel offers one of THE great service experiences. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Truly awesome. That being said, as they say, your pay your money you take your choice. Everything in the hotel is eye-wateringly expensive. £30 for breakfast (its a great fry-up), £11 for a whisky, £7 for a peroni - i could just about stomach those but £15 ( i think it was £15 but it was there or there abouts)  for 24 hours wifi ? Thats just being naughty. Great stay - fabulous hotel - out of this world service. Will be back soon hopefully (once I have saved up the pennies....)",4,2010,08,29
130,The Dorchester  - truly memorable,"We were celebrating a significant anniversary and stayed at The Dorchester before joining the Orient Express and the final destination of Venice. From the very beginning the level of service was totally faultless and this continued throughout our stay. The bedroom was luxurious as you would expect, and the upgrade to a view of Hyde Park was a nice touch. Nothing was too much trouble, and what made it especially pleasant were the staff who all took time to talk to us with genuine interest. We didn't have an evening meal at the hotel but the breakfast had everything you could wish for. During our stay we lost a ring, we mentioned this at check out and followed this with an e-mail. On our return to the UK the hotel's security contacted us and forwarded the lost item. This is where The Dorchester stands out from the crowd. If you are looking for a hotel that prides itself on service levels that go above and beyond the norm then stay here, you will not regret it.",5,2010,08,26
130,Exceptional and very special place to stay,"We stayed at the Dorchester to celebrate my 50th Birthday and our 25th Wedding Anniversary.  We were treated like VIP's from the moment of our arrival and cannot thank the hotel enough for  the very special manner in which we were treated from the reservation team to the room service staff.  Everything was just exceptional and outstanding but the real difference that shone through to us was the pride that all the staff have for the hotel.  Our biggest thanks go to Joe MacBean, the Theatre desk manager, for not only arranging wonderful theatre seats and the wonderful welcome but for also imparting lots of helpful local knowledge and tips.  He really went the extra mile for us.",5,2010,08,23
130,Perfection!,"I stayed there for one night for my girlfriend's birthday. Everything was perfect. They upgraded my room as it was my girlfriend's birthday which was a lovely surprise. The service was personal and not obtrusive. The room was impeccable in terms of quality and cleanliness.

We had dinner at the Alain Ducasse which wad an amazing experience. The food was outstanding as was the service. The quantity and quality was spot on, and the taste was out of this world.",5,2010,08,23
130,Always excellent,"I have stayed, dined and taken afternoon tea at The Dorchester a number of times and can only heap praise on every aspect of this magical establishment. Christmas high tea is a must, followed by cocktails in the bar followed by a Barcelonan feast and a night of luxury in one of the sumptuous rooms or suites is an experience to be forever valued.

10 out of 10",5,2010,08,23
130,beautiful hotel,An exceptional experience.  You do not need to be a millionaire to welcomed in this hotel.  The staff were fantastic from the minute you are welcomed at the door to the minute your luggage is placed in your taxi for your journey home.  The rooms are luxurious and immaculately clean.  Food very nice all provided with excellent service.  This stay was for a special occasion and I feel my hard earned money has been well spent.,5,2010,08,09
130,"perfect, everything a top London hotel should be","Stayed there this weekend, had a great time, as expected. room and service were perfect. If you want a luxury stay in London you can't go wrong with this hotel.",5,2010,08,09
130,"Lovely hotel, central to everything","Great stay at the hotel. The rooms, while not large, were perfectly adequate in size and the beds and pillows were just divine. It was also very quiet which makes sleeping much easier. The valet parking was very quick. We ate in the Grill which while excellent, was quite expensive, but I guess what else would I expect from The Dorchester? The food was divine, so it was worth it. It was walking distance to shopping on Bond Street, Regent Street and also Oxford Street. Check in and out was quick for us, though at other times I saw that there were queues. The concierge was also very helpful in recommending a great Italian restaurant on our first night, and also making the booking for us.",5,2010,08,04
130,"Average Hotel, too much hype.","Our Stay at the Dorchester was pleasent but nothing more. Our Suite was actually 2 rooms put together which felt outdated and very old.. They had 2 bathrooms.....That was a disapointment as well.
Found the gym very small and claustrophobic. The breakfast in the gallery was quite pleasent. All in all it was nothing special and I would not return.",3,2010,08,04
130,"Expensive, Decadent...but i have to say it was slightly disappointing","Firstly i will start by highlighting that i frequent 5* hotels around the world on a daily basis.
The Dorchester has always been a dream, but in my humble opinion i was left somewhat disappointed.
I am a believer in 110% from hotels at this end of the market, i believe in feeling comfortable in your surroundings and being greeted with a smile come rain or shine.

We were shown to our room, which is fine, but then we were quizzed by our guide on ""which type of light switch we prefer, dimmer switches or pre-set modes""...all very peculiar.
I had pre-ordered champagne for the room (as i always do) only for the door to knock/ring on a further 3 occasions with 3 more bottles of champagne, when in all honesty all we really wanted at the time was some privacy. 
At no point when we were in our rooms did we spend more than 15 minutes without a call from the front desk asking if everything was OK or the door knocking.
All in all, I had a pleasant stay, some good champagne, and a good nights sleep before our car arrived early morning to take us to the airport....but in all honesty, I would rather spend my money at the Lanesborough.",5,2010,07,27
130,embarrassing,"Hotel is beautiful, stunning and elegant.  Staff were as expected but oh dear, bar manager let the rest of the staff down. While waiting for client and enjoying a quiet chat with the barman the(presumed) bar manager walked past, seemed pleasant, smiled and then he heard i had northern accent. His attittude turned unpleasant, even making the nice barman uncomfortable and i decided to spend my companies money elsewhere rather than embarrass my client. I really do hope he was just having a bad day and this is not normal.",4,2010,07,22
130,Lunch at the Dorchester,"Did not stay at this hotel so cannot rate rooms or sleep quality.  I went to meet up with friends and family.  Very good lunch, excellent service and beautiful surroundings, very peaceful inside the hotel lobby (considering we are in central London).  Food good quality and really enjoyed myself whilst there.  Would certain like the opportunity of going there again for lunch or afternoon tea! My mum who is 87 yrs old really loved it! Value for money is pricey but probably worth it for a special occasion, very clean throughout the reception, lobby and restaurant.  Wine waiter was particularly helpful in choosing the right wine for the right meal choice.",4,2010,07,18
130,Fantastic,"Stayed for a weekend with my Wife. Had a fantastic time from arrival to departure. The Hotel was lovely,the staff couldn't be faulted. Nothing was too much trouble. The bedroom was bigger than I expected  and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was in art deco style and done to the highest standard. Breakfast was very good and the fresh apple juice was the best I have ever tasted. I can't find a fault with the hotel at all. We did eat at Alain  Ducasse which was a big disappointment I don't know if it was just too high an expectation but they were not met. We didn't make a fuss  as the hotel itself was excellent. Definitely would stay again.",5,2010,07,04
130,"Amazing hotel, very attentive staff and beautifully decorated","We stayed at the Dorchester for a long weekend in June 2010. I was actually proposed to at the Dorchester so I am a bit biased, but this really is an excellent hotel! 

The staff are incredibly polite and it is one of those 5 star hotels where they really take notice of their guests and look after them. We were very pleasantly surprised to find walking along the corridor to our room that the maid knew our names despite the fact we had not been introduced before!

Flowers from the florist are absolutely stunning; there are displays all around the communal areas of the hotel and my fiancé ordered 2 large bouquets for our room. When it was time to leave the hotel I asked for the flowers to be wrapped and the florist came to our room, took the flowers and returned them with each rose stem individually wrapped in water for no extra charge!

The staff at the spa are very helpful and friendly and as one would expect from a hotel like the Dorchester the spa is luxurious and spotless.

Breakfast is served in the promenade, which is also the afternoon tea area, the food was excellent and pastries were served on the afternoon tea cake stands, the whole room looked beautiful, it was a pleasure to eat there. On the last morning we ordered room service breakfast and it actually came on its own table- none of this balancing the tray on your lap! 

The rooms are luxurious, the bathroom has the deepest bath I have ever been in, the shower is huge and the complimentary toiletries are full size and really good quality.

I would very highly recommend this hotel as a treat- well worth it!",5,2010,06,24
130,"Afternoon Tea,  Wonderful!!!","We have just spent a wonderful afternoon at The Dorcherster for a Champagne Afternoon Tea..  From the moment we arrived and were greeted at the door we were made to feel special.   As I had a vegetarian and a mother who is allegic to cucumber,  in our group, I had to ring ahead to change the sandwiches which they were more than happy to do.  The sandwiches were freshly made with lots of different fillings and after two rounds bring on the cakes!!!    The cakes, I have to say were wonderful from the freshly made warm scones with clotted cream and home-made preserves, to the delightful pastries all explained to which was which and when finshed,  it was quickly refilled...  As it was my mothers birthday they brought out a small birthday cake for her and played happy birthday on the piano.. A great treat...     This is silver service all the way and we could not fault it at all..  Now got to start saving to go and stay the night!!",5,2010,06,21
130,Afternoon tea: style over substance?,"Didn't stay at the Dorchester; merely visited for afternoon tea.  The surroundings are elegant and opulent, and it is all fantastically staged.  The service is very much on show: white gloved waiters advise on what tea to choose, and serve everything with enormous care, while the resident pianist plays unobtrusively.  The food is labourious and exquisite: a whole tea menu; miniature sandwiches; scones and cakes - each a work of art.  If you like the kind of service that borders on the intrusive, and you enjoy formality, this will appeal to you.  It made me yearn for a mug of PG Tips and a biscuit to dunk in.  Clearly just a question of style.",4,2010,05,31
130,Just fabulous!,"Absolutely brilliant! One of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. Great for a treat and located on Park Lane in one of the best areas of London. Pure luxury that gives that home away from home feel and you really never want to leave this place. Our room was large with a big comfortable bed, great bathroom and all the pleasures to make your stay a wondeful one. 
Hotel staff are really good. Room service is great and The Spatisserie has the best to die for desserts and teas. Whatever you do please pop in and have an afternoon tea. My girlfriends and I are thinking about coming back for one of the Girls Weekends here. 
Overall service is excellent! Give it a go!",5,2010,05,07
130,My favourite place on earth,"I have grown up visiting and staying in the Dorchester and so thought it was finally time that I gave it the fabulous review it deserves. As soon as those ever so dapper doormen greet you in, you know you are about to be whisked away into your own swirling  fantasy and spend your time whiling away the hours in dreamlike reverie, drifting amongst the indulgent romantiscm of the bespoke interiors and delicate, gentle manner of all staff that help to create your idyllic notions of a world with quirks to be treasured, far away from any monotony found in the ordinary.  Every touch seems entwined within magic- go there, discover it and innocently escape from normality, if only for a few hours.",5,2010,04,15
130,AFTERNOON TEA!!,"Have been here before for afternoon tea, but went again this time to take my Mother In Law as a late Christmas treat.  The service is impeccable, all staff will go out of their way to make you feel like royalty.  The champagne, tea, sandwiches (without crusts lol!!), cakes and scones were out of this world.  My husband also came with us and he thorughly enjoyed himself aswell.  I would definately recommend afternoon tea at The Dorchester.  Ok so its not cheap BUT..... everyone has to treat themselves once in a while don't they?!!",5,2010,04,15
130,Luxery,"Stayed one night at The Dorchester and it was an unforgetable experience. I have never stayed in such a 5* luxery hotel but could easily get used to it if i had the money! 

All staff as youd expect were pofessional and a plesure to deal with. We arrived dead on 1500 and our junior suite wasnt ready, we were taken to the bar to have a complimentry drink each which was great considerig price was £50 for 2! Soon after we were told our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a Belgravia suite. The suite was just perfect, over looking the front of the hotel and Hyde Park. Both the bedrom, living room and bathroom were fantastic, comfy and sheer luxery. Every room amenity you could think of was there.

Plenty of places to eat, we choose Alain Ducasse and table Lumiere. A magical and unforgettable experience.

Only problem i couldnt pick the WIfi up in the room but that didnt effect what was a truly awsome time of luxery we had at the Dorchester.",5,2010,04,12
130,intuitive service at it's best,"My wife and I stayed at the Dorchester for the first time for 4 nights over Easter. All  I can say is that we were truly impressed by the way in which we were treated, especially as upon arrival we were informed that we had been given a free upgrade to a Junior Suite.  The staff were friendly and attentive without being over bearing and our Suite was pure luxury,  exceeding our best expectations.
No task was too much trouble and everyone seemed genuinely keen to please.
Breakfast was more than ample and kept us going for most of the day and the choice of evening dining options (Alain Ducasse,The Grill, China Tang) should be enough to accommodate the most discerning palate.
We opted to try The Grill and China Tang and found both to be quite simply excellent.
All in all we could find nothing bad to say about our stay and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2010,04,06
130,no wonder famous people choose to stay here,"We stayed in Dorchester for four nights.Our room was very beautiful,well and classicly (but not old fashionly!) decorated and gave an immediate warm and homy feeling .We came to London to celebrate our 12 year old son birthday and the hotel receptionist received him with a cake , candles and lots of candies and received us with a great champagne bottle.Thanks!!!!!Room service was efficient and the room was spotless every single day.Theatre desk managed to get great tickets to Wicked and Hair.Concierge was very helpful,doormen very nice-offering taxis,umbrellas etc.We did not go to the hotels restaurants but went to the afternoon tea which was wonderful -really getting pampered by the generous staff.Well ,despite the fact that the hotel is pricey,it worth it! (especially for people who  emphasizie  the importance of accomodations in a trip.I am sure that you know people telling ""hotel is not important because we come only to sleep"").The location of the hotel is very well though we found it a bit far from the tube station.
We really enjoyed our trip and Dorchester has certainly its contribution to that,Thanks again and hopefully will come again to the Dorchester.",5,2010,04,04
130,Better second time around,"Stayed here a few years back; and while I was impressed with the hotel itself, service wise it just didn't stand out. 

Thought I'd give it another go tough, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay this time. While the decor of the hotel is largely unchanged, the surroundings are still very impressive. The only thing that seems to have changed is the spa faciities; they seemed to have refurbished the entire area. I was very impressed with the new design-and the relaxition room was just lovely (worth going quite early if you like a bit of peace and quiet-not sure if it gets busy at all during the day).

Service wise seems to have improved all round, so Im not sure if when I last stayed it was just one those off days for staff; but the difference was noticable in attitude, efficiency, etc.

I had room 701 which was lovely-there seems to have been a lot of thought going in to rooms, from the design, layout and the little touches in the room. Not really a gripe as it wasn't particularly important to me but the view wasn't brilliant; so for those who this is important to, it is maybe worth asking for a room with a slightly better view. 

Would I return, I'd like to; but I think that there still some other hotels I'd like to give a shot at in the near future, so I may just work my way round back to the Dorchester eventually.",5,2010,04,03
130,Discreet Luxury,"Just returned from a relaxing week at The Dorchester in London. Five Star Perfection.
There is a reason celebrities stay here. Unlike the George V in Paris where the staff are fake and are simply going through the motions to get every dollar they can out of your wallet,  The Dorchester has a staff that is properly and  completely at your service.  If you can reside here sometime and you will thank yourself for it.",5,2010,03,25
130,The best Eggs Benedict I have ever had....,I have only visited the hotel a couple of times but found the afternoon tea to be lovely and the Eggs Benedict for breakfast was historic. As a handy aside the barber shop on the LG floor provides the best wetshave in London. Totally top drawer!,5,2010,03,24
130,Simply The Best Hotel in The World,"I’ve written a review of the Dorchester before after we came to this fabulous hotel for afternoon tea. From that moment & after how well the amazing the staff treated us on that occasion I knew that I & my partner would have to stay at the hotel.

I also wanted to propose to my girlfriend and the one place I wanted to do it was at the Dorchester and after booking the room I started correspondence with the reservation team & all I can say is that they took my dreams and surpassed them with all the help they gave us! (Sigrid thank you so much!) 

When we arrived the hotel manager met us and knew mine & my girlfriend’s name which was a lovely touch and then a member of staff showed us around and took us to our room. Now the room I booked was the double room & I had no idea that they would upgrade us to the Terrace Suite!  This was such a lovely & amazing gesture that I almost cried.

The penthouse is an amazing room with Jacuzzi over looking Hyde Park and amazing shower & is such an amazing place to stay. The only problem I had was my girlfriend thought I had won the lottery!  This hotel in my own humble experience is the best hotel in the world without doubt from the generous staff to the personal touches they make, it is also one of the most beautiful places I have seen.

They made an engagement box cake for us for when I proposed at dinner & a special mention has to go to Roland in the Grill for minding the engagement ring all day and for also relaxing me when I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown the food is the best me or my fiancée have ever eaten if you ever get the chance try the duck main course it’s divine. When we went back to our room there was rose petals on the bed and chocolates, champagne & strawberries awaiting us.

Sadly we only stayed one night because we were flying to the Maldives the next day & the biggest compliment I can make is we didn’t want to go on holiday but stay for another night at the Dorchester.

This hotel holds so many special memories for us & we can’t wait to return and have so many more special memories.",5,2010,03,21
130,Defines Luxury......,"My wife and I used to stay at the Savoy on special occasions, and became engaged in the hotel. When it closed we felt slightly bereft. Then last February we went to The Dorchester and felt completely at home. Our third visit was at the end of February this year when we stayed for two nights in a ""basic"" room.

Basic. Cheapest. Neither really applies, but then you wouldn't expect it to, would you? We had a lovely room, which had everything that we could reasonably require although the minibar prices brought tears to my eyes. There comes a point when these turn from expensive to usurious and I felt that point had been well and truly passed. However I expect this and therefore shut my mind to it - at least the mini bar is of the type where one can remove the stock so that one can chill a bottle of champagne - I'd wanted to introduce my wife to the Veuve Clicquot Rich Reserve 2002 and I had managed to source a bottle at Fortnum & Mason.

We met friends for afternoon tea in the Promenade, which was superb. Service was excellent and everything was absolutely spot on. Proper clotted cream too. Sitting watching people go by is also great fun - it was a lovely occasion. To follow we asked staff to arrange a table for us in the bar, which they did, and we then had a lovely cocktail each.

My wife and I had been to Fortnum & Mason earlier and had bought some special food, and had what she calls a carpet picnic - a nice way of chilling out and not having to get dressed and go downstairs. We had a meal booked in the Grill for the second night and wanted some peace and quiet chilling out. 

After a superbly comfortable night we woke and had breakfast delivered. It was lovely - we both had a full English breakfast. Very efficiently delivered. And - and this is the real test - still lovely and hot.

Eventually we made our way down to Hyde Park Corner and visited Apsley House and the Wellington Arch - nice things to do and Apsley is surprisingly impressive inside. Certainly recommended.

Dinner in the Grill was superb. The food was perfect - we had a superb Chateaubriand between us as well as the most gorgeous pudding - service was spot on, with a lovely young waitress who was both deferential and humorous - a very difficult trick to pull off and one that makes such a difference. 

Another superbly comfortable night, and another gorgeous breakfast (my wife had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs which were very well done - and that really is a test for room service!) before very sadly checking out.

Hugely recommended. Expensive, but worth every penny.",5,2010,03,09
130,Grill Room dull but overall lives up to its name,"We were here for 1 night on the 7th on the lazy sunday package (346 gbp for 1 night incl. tax and dinner for 2 in the grill) plus breakfast.  DVD player 20 gbp per day, internet (superfast wi fi) 15 gbp, ipod dock provided free of charge (didnt work). 

Check in was smooth with prompt baggage send up. The room itself very charming and well sound proofed (apart from the sound of draining water from the bathroom above in the morning). In addition the small hallway and door to close it off ensured no noise from house keeping in the moring.  Climate a little difficult to control as it was too hot and dry with the AC on in the day. We slept with windows open at night as room felt stuffy otherwise. But often hotel rooms lack the facility for fresh air.  Since its February it was good to discover extra duvets in the wardrobe (something you usually have to ask for in most hotels!).  Bedding was excellent although mattress was slightly concave or perhaps it was just too soft for me.

Due to a mistake of my own (assuming there was a hotel pool) I booked 2 nights. When I found out there was no pool I called reception and without any issues they let me cancel the next night. They were also incredibly helpful recommending the hotels that do have pools..The gym was medium sized for a london hotel (about 45-50 sqm) but nicely done in white decor and with new equipment.    All in all the very attentive service of most of the hotel staff made the stay more special. The lobby which leads into the tea room makes the entrance very beautiful and the decor is stunning in these areas. 

We ate in the Grill on our package. On being seated we were not asked which menu we might be interested in and on asking which menu was relevant to the 'lazy sunday package' the waiter announced (almost!) to the entire restaurant that we were 'on the package' in true Basil Fawlty style.   It was a set menu which was a little uninspiring with the main course (pollock) being totally undercooked.  For starters was a choice of scallops and gnocchi or celeraic soup- both were good although gnocchi/scallops was a strange pairing.  The desserts sounded interesting (white chocolate fondant/ praline mousse) but by the time it came to them we were desperate to leave the stale atmosphere of the GRill Room with the stiff waiters adding to the insipid atmosphere. In all the dinner seemed to try the principles of a low budget hollywood movie- keep the beginning interesting and the end ok and everyone will forget the middle or how bad it was.  Best to eat at China Tang if you want to stay in the hotel...it is always consistently good and for similar prices although unfortunately only the Grill Room is covered in the package and now perhaps we can see why.

Dinner was however made up for the next morning by an excellent choice of full breakfast (4gbp surcharge for in room) that was delivered efficiently and attentively to the room.

Overall I would stay at this hotel again because of the service and the room but probably not on this package.  The Spa is supposed to be one of the the big features of this hotel but I did not try it so can not comment.",4,2010,02,09
130,Absolutely Flawless,"My partner and I often wonder whether, by liquidating our assets, we could afford to live in The Dorchester for the rest of our lives.  Being in our mid 30's, there's a chance we might have to check out of the hotel before checking out of life, so we will have to satisfy ourselves with the occassional visit.

Everything is faultless.  We love the 'country house' look of the rooms, the wonderfully deep baths and that feeling of being at home whilst being waited on hand and foot.  The staff are impeccable but never snooty, the food divine, the new Spa beautiful, the rooms sumptuous and the public areas luxurious.

Our most recent trip comprised 3 nights in two Deluxe Rooms between Christmas and New Year for ourselves and my parents.  When making the reservation, I mentioned that it was my parents' anniversary and that the trip was our treat.  When arriving at the hotel, we were delighted to find that my parents had been complementarily upgraded to a delightful Executive room.  It was a entirely unexpected, but greatly appreciated.

We thoroughly enjoyed their 'champagne afternoon tea' and were supplied with limitless finger sandwiches that melted in the mouth.  If we did not have a reservation at Maze that evening, I could have eaten my own bodyweight in cucumber sandwiches.  

There is not one thing I would change at The Dorchester and, if you seek an indulgent break, there is simply no better place.",5,2010,02,09
130,Third time lucky,This was my third stay at the Dorchester since first visiting in September.  The room was beautiful and the staff friendly and knowledgeable.  We ordered room service and it was delivered quickly and was incredible.,5,2010,02,09
130,Probably the best hotel in the world,"If you are coming to London please be aware there are hotels pretending to be five-star but after tens of years of going to London and staying in most of the hotels who pretend to be five-star I have come to the conclusion that there is only one and it's called the Dorchester!!
From the moment you arrive at the doors, to the moment you leave the service you receive will probably be the best you have ever received!!
The new spa in this hotel is excellent and would truly recommend it.
Room service, as you can imagine in such a famous hotel it to be excellent please trust me when I say ""the best room service I have ever had"".
The cheaper rooms are well designed and have a luxury feel to them.
Afternoon tea at the Dorchester is something that you must try but be advised to book early as it gets busy and would be a shame to miss.
I must say all the staff are very helpful and very polite.
Do not be surprised to bump into somebody very famous in this hotel.",5,2010,01,28
130,The Grill - Fabulous restaurant,I visitited The Grill at the Dorchester for my birthday and I would describe the restaurant as heaven.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food quite delicious. The highlight was Jason (The sommelier) who chose the most delicious wine and made the whole experience more magical.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a wonderful lunch which is excellent value in one of the most gorgeous hotels in London.,5,2010,01,20
130,Perfection in every sense,"What can I say if you can get there go! Absolutely the best accommodation I have ever stayed in. Also Marc - manager in the grill restaurant provided professional and friendly service, thanks so much!",5,2010,01,18
130,A Perfect Week,"It was a pleasure to be back at the Dorchester for another wonderful stay.  The staff was charming and engaging and made me feel at home.  My room was delightful with lots of closet space and a superb King size bed.  

Breakfast at the Promenade was very enjoyable and dinner at the Dorchester Grill was the best meal I had in London.  

Of all the luxury hotels in London-- the Dorchester seems the most relaxed---posh without being stuffy.  

Housekeeping was amazing--every day and evening my room was in perfect condition.  

On my last day--my flight was canceled due to the snow--but the remarkable concierge was able to get me booked on the last seat on the last flight out to the next closest city-- and I was able to get home without too much trouble.  I could never have done that on my own.  

For an outstanding hotel in a wonderful city--the Dorchester is on the top of my list.",5,2010,01,12
130,Bad service for a supposed luxury hotel,"I stayed here with my Wife and children prior to travelling on to the Eurostar (provided a good quality service as an aside) whilst the Hotel itself was nice, the service was a let down with the room service hap making us feel very uncomfortable. We asked for some dental product and after 3 requests still never received this through the evening into the morning. If you are willing to throw your money about then they will probably give you as much service as possible if you want to treat yourself as we did then look somewhere else.",3,2010,01,09
130,Overrated,"While a London landmark (the reason we stayed there), its dramatically over priced for what it is - much better to be had in London for a third of the price. The bar is great but the rooms are a bit Laura Ashley.",2,2010,01,08
130,Magnificent Hotel which beats the boutiques by a country mile,"I stayed here for three nights just before Christmas. If you're in the mood to be pampered, then this hotel is the place for you. Though it cost me a little more than I usually spend, the Dorchester exudes comfort, great service and a joie de vivre which is particularly infectious around Christmas-time. Try their afternoon tea in the downstairs lounge ; so pleasant just to sink into their sofas and spend an hour or so watching the world go by!

My room was a haven of warmth and serenity in the midst of one of the coldest December's London has ever experienced. The bathroom was so aesthetically alluring and cleverly designed that it  must have been ergonomically imagineered by a native of Copenhagen. Room service was of the highest calibre. Piping hot filet steak a poivre with fresh creamed spinach and fries delivered to my room with care and attention. Bliss just to sit there and sip a bottle of Czech Budvar beer as an accompaniment to my meal. 

I tried the Grill restaurant for breakfast on the final morning of my sojourn in the Dorchester. Delicious breakfast punctuated by the same stratospheric levels of professional service I had experienced for the entire duration of my stay. The staff of this hotel really know the meaning of the word 'hospitality'. Indeed they must be amongst its leading exponents.

In the past, I have written very positive reviews of different boutique hotels in London. In truth, however, the Dorchester leaves these hotels trailing in its wake. It is in a different class altogether. Truly a hotel which deserves to be celebrated. It is easily amongst the top five hotels in London (at least in my opinion). I intend to return there early in the New Year.",5,2009,12,31
130,Very nice stay but suite could be improved slightly!,"Just returned from a lovely stay at the Dorchester.

The service is always impeccable and the waiters at the Promenade Bar were great, felt a valued customer and had a few laughs throughout the evening.

We stayed in a suite which was huge and very beautiful but being ultra fussy I was slightly disappointed that a room of this size (dining room, lounge area etc) did not have a separate shower area, just a shower head over the bath!! Still can not find a shower to beat Claridges.

Our suite overlooked ther front which was great but the down side was, as a light sleeper,  I did hear the lifts quite often, particulalry when trying to sleep.  For the management - if you are to have a dressing table in the bedroom, please make sure that there is a plug close enough for the hairdryer to work and also have the mirror at a height we can see in to!!!

Overall,  a very nice stay with great, friendly and sincere staff and great food.

Lotus Flower Champagne cocktails are coming home with me.",5,2009,12,30
130,5 star class,"this is by far and away my favorite london hotel, from the initial greeting in reception right through to checkout this is a slick operation with a real foucus on quality, both bars and all 3 resturants are first class and if you have the time their afternoon tea should be taken at least once.

a real class act",5,2009,12,11
130,Loved the Dorchester,Its THE place to stay in London. Its where all the Hollywood royalty stays everytime there's a premiere in London. For one such premiere I had to interview some of the stars staying there and I ended up staying there. Its an amazing hotel. Though it might be too posh for some. The hotel staff are polite to everyone but you can tell when they think you're not upto their usual royal standard. Would recommend it for celebrity spotting!,4,2009,12,04

130,"Afternoon Tea - a wonderful, memorable experience","Although I didn't actually stay at the Dorchester, I had such a lovely experience with their traditional afternoon tea I thought I better write a review! I did much research on where I wanted to have afternoon tea and picked the Dorchester because it was one of the best value for money I could find (and I was was paying, so it better be good!). 

The lobby is warm and inviting and the Christmas tree was well decorated. I also got to check out the bathrooms while I was there - very private and elegant. Anyway, I absolutely loved the whole afternoon tea experience. Our waiter was so friendly and charming, he bent over backwards to help us. After seeing us looking confused at a map, he came to our assistance and gave us helpful directions to our destination. Two out of three of us are vegetarian and we thought the Dorchester catered really well to our needs, offering a simple yet delicious variety of both meat and meat-free options that we were all satisfied with. The sandwiches were offered at least three times before we served with a honey yoghurt parfait thing which was a welcomed surprise - it was delicious. The scones were of a high quality and the clotted cream, jam and marmalade were delicious. While the french pastries weren't to my taste (I am just not a pastry person, that's all, but I can appreciate them) they were perfectly presented. 

The ambience is wonderful and just like it appears on the website. The signature Dorchester blend was also fantastic. I just thought the service was brilliant, they make you feel like a movie star and are totally welcoming, professional yet approachable. I paid 33.50 pounds per person and I think it was such a memorable experience that I will take with me forever (but certainly will do next time I'm in London!!). It was worth every penny.",5,2009,11,17
130,Next they'll probably charge for electricity,"The Dorchester is an iconic British hotel. I've stayed in it many times. You can't beat the Mayfair location right across from Hyde Park. The lobby is lovely and a perfect spot for enjoying a cocktail or beautiful English tea. But now with the dollar at an all time low staying at the Dorchester has become prohibitive. That said, I decided to bite the bullet, and spend the ridiculous sum  to stay where I feel most comfortable. For almost three thousand pounds a night I was shown to a ""Dorchester Suite"". It's a little snug (under 800 sq. feet) but very nicely decorated and comfortable. There were fresh flowers and a welcome back note from the manager. Here's why I will not return to the Dorchester: there is a 20 pound charge per day per computer in every room and suite. I was there for seven days. Do the math. I find this ridiculously short sided and tacky. So while in London I visited at least a dozen 5 star hotels to see if I could find a suitable replacement. Truth be told not all the suites I was shown were as beautiful as the suites at the Dorchester.  But several were and besides having a considerably lower price NOT ONE OTHER HOTEL CHARGED FOR INTERNET. At the end of my week I checked out of the Dorchester and told the desk clerk that I was not happy about the internet charge. He apologized and said it's a frequent complaint but that management was not willing to change it.  He suggested I negotiate the charge on my next visit and they would probably cut the price in half. I asked if he would cut the fee in half this time and he said he couldn't.  I thanked him and told him there wouldn't be a next time. After years of loyal patronage this idiotic charge was the straw that broke the camel's back. I  have booked my next London visit at the Stafford. For almost a thousand pounds less per night I'm staying in a beautifully decorated suite that is larger than the Dorchester Suite and yes, comes with free internet. It's also in a terrific location and has a fabulously cozy and charming bar and the staff I met could not be nicer. And best of all, I won't feel like a schmuck spending a lot of money and feeling fleeced.",4,2009,11,09
130,Absolutely Fantastic,Just came back from a night at the Dorchester. There where no problems whatsoever the staff where so helpful and the hotel and bedrooms are beautiful. It deserves every star it has.,5,2009,11,03
130,excellent all round,"Spent half term with the family in London.
Despite the fact that we arrived dragging our suitcases from the underground,we were warmly welcomed with none of the supposed snobbery suggested by some of the previous reviewers.
Two great interconnecting rooms,complimentary champagne and chocolate.
Great position for attending shows in the west end,and even paparazzi waiting outside on our return in the evening-but not waiting for us!
Will definitely stay again when visiting London.",5,2009,11,03
130,Want the best service and location for a client thank you event? Book the Penthouse Suite - remarkable,"Used the Penthouse Suite for a private function to celebrate achievements of four outstanding individuals in their field (with partners) and to present them with awards. 
Simply the best service I have experienced in the UK. The private balcony complete with fountains and views across the iconic London skyline was breath taking. 
Not many places could have given our guests this type of experience.

Very grateful to the outstanding staff for a memorable evening.",5,2009,10,25
130,I'm not sure what all the hype is about,"Good hotel but I’m not sure what the hype is about.

Summary:

·	Good location for West End
·	Great beds and sheets
·	Spotlessly clean
·	Friendly front desk and doormen
·	Overall decoration in rooms needs to be freshened up
·	Room Service food wasn’t that good
·	Breakfast was ok but a very long way off 5 stars both in terms of the food and the ambience.

A good impression, the hotel is spotless, nice lobby, doorman very helpful.

Reception staff very pleasant.

I booked a superior Queen room as I was staying for 1 night for a business meeting, it wasn’t a big room but it wasn’t bad given I wasn’t staying long. The room was in relatively good condition couple of bulbs hadn’t been replaced but bed very comfortable and sheets fantastic, quite bright and had nice B&O TV. The air con vents face the bed and some people may not necessarily like that. 

Bathroom was in good condition and marble everywhere however the bath/shower over felt tired plus they had those rubber mats in the bath when you shower which is good but felt dated and I’m not sure it’s terribly hygienic really. Nice Floris toiletries and great towels.

When you enter the floor from the lift you feel like your transported back to some type of 1950s hotel in terms of décor, but not in a good way. That combined with the rooms which if you like chintz you love it here. But chintz in a 1980s Laura Ashley way. It didn’t feel elegant or bygone era, simply old really like visiting an elderly relatives house.

I ordered room service, which took slightly longer than they said it would, I wasn’t that fussed but hey its 5 star I expect it within 30mins if they tell me that’s what it will be. That wasn’t the worst part though. I felt the food wasn’t particularly good. I ordered a prawn pasts dish, frankly the prawns were well overcooked and like bullets and overall it was bland. The desert wasn’t that much better. I won’t bore you with the details suffice it to say I’ve had much better for lesser establishments.

After room service I went down to the bar but I have to say personally to me it looked like a 1980s night club, lots of black and some bright lights, again it didn’t do much for me personally but some people may love it because it’s the Dorchester.

However the final nail in the Dorchester coffin for me was the breakfast the next morning. After the room service the previous evening I decided to go down for breakfast, its held in the Dorchester Grill. Mmmm it’s a very large virtually windowless room, which has been tarted up, with some gold, tartan and a large flower display. If felt like I was eating breakfast in a well decorated conference all, it had that lack of ambience. I think it hit home particularly as it was 7.30am. Frankly I felt it quite depressing room for breakfast it just didn’t feel right at all. Perhaps it would be ok in the evening but I’m not convinced. However it’s certainly not a good place to have breakfast, the waiter served my food, which he promptly got wrong. I didn’t complain, as I didn’t see the point. I had scrambled eggs and smoked salmon both which tasted again bland but given the lighting speed it arrived after I ordered it I don’t believe they made the eggs to order and that also came across in the presentation. Compared to the Connaught, which had a fabulous breakfast room and fantastic breakfast, this was no where near as good.

Overall I found my Dorchester experience quite odd, I wanted to love it, but ended up feeling sorry for it. It needs to be freshened up and someone needs to overhaul catering. Given the prices I’d rather stay in other London hotels.",4,2009,10,24
130,Didn't expect to be staying above a night club - they should have told us,"We've stayed at The Dorchester before. Largely this hotel delivers in terms of the standards of it's accommodation and amenities and you can read about all of that in detail from numerous reviews elsewhere. However one thing really surprised me on our stay this past Friday. We stayed in room #130 and from 1030pm until 130am there was a pretty loud function being hosted at the ballroom downstairs. The noise was more than loud enough to prevent us from going to sleep - honestly it was pretty loud! I eventually phoned the Night Manager at 1230pm and at first he didn't know what I was talking about, then advised that the noise was towards ""the upper end of their acceptable range"" and that they were monitoring it, then offered for us to change rooms. I thanked him for the offer, but didn't want to get dressed, pack and move at that time of night (especially as we were leaving the next day anyway). 

I think that they have a problem with sound proofing from the ballroom, and so recommend asking for a higher floor if available. My main gripe is that we were never informed that a function was going to take place and so couldn't avoid this ourselves. Not great from a hotel of this standard and price.",2,2009,10,19
130,Fourth Stay---Heavenly!,"I'm very sorry some of the reviewers have had unpleasant experiences with the Dorchester.  I've stayed at this hotel 3 times this year, and one time in 2005.    I found the hotel fabulous for several reasons:

1. Customer service was attentive and welcoming.  

At no time (contrary to the perceptions of the critical reviews posted on this website) did I receive or perceive second-rate treatment simply because I arrived by taxi.   The doormen and bellhops were extraordinarily accommodating.   Perhaps the guests in the prior reviews were a bit unhappy about their modest mode of transportation, but I've never perceived the Dorchester staff to be concerned about this.  

2.  The public areas are spacious and beautiful--replete with amazing flower arrangements.  The rooms are large (the smallest is approximately 346 sq. ft).  and, as the website states,  ""inherently British""--with modern technology and antique, plush furnishings.    The bathroom is covered in beautiful marble, the bath tub is very large and your hot bath is ready in less than two minutes!  

Most impressive is the bed-- the most heavenly bed in which I have ever slept.  The sheets and pillows feel like creamy butter.  Their gift shop sells their pillows--I am tempted to buy.  I've read that the Dorchester beds are considered the most luxurious in London--and I'm a believer.  

3.  The front desk staff has been consistently warm, friendly, professional and attentive.  No matter how I looked upon arrival following an 11 hour flight in very casual attire, the staff has always provided a warm welcome and made me feel at home.   Additionally, on my last visit, the concierge spent more than one hour attempting to track down my concert ticket number because I had left my tickets at home.  He was fantastic.

4.  The Dorchester often offers great week-end rates, with breakfast included.   I overheard one guest stating that he usually stays at the Hilton, but he was staying at the Dorchester   because the hotel offered a more competitive price.    The breakfast is both delicious and indulgent, offering a variety of eggs,  cereals, meats, toast and an array of warm, baked muffins. 

I can't say enough about my wonderful experiences at the Dorchester.  For this reason, I will continue to return.  I'm returning in December!",5,2009,10,03
130,charging creditcard in express,"My wife and I stayed for 4 nights at Dorchester in may last year. We are from Stavanger in Norway and have been in London several times. We like Londom very mutch.  At the reseption the reseptonist would have my creditcard. I told him that we had payed it to our travelcompany in Stavanger several weeks ago. He would not accept that and charged my card for about Nkr. 24.000,- what would bee about 2.400 pounds ?  The rom cost about Nkr.16.000,- / 1.600 pounds.   It did not help that I showed him the reciept from the travellagenci in Stavanger.   He said the amount would be for possible dammage of the room ! ! ! !      If this hotel is a hotel witch have many guests dammaging the rooms, it's not the kind og hotel we want to stay at.  It took about 2 weeks before the amount of Nkr.24.000,- was returned to my creditcard.  So WE will not stay any more times at the Dorchester.   The people in the reseption was not ofthe nice kind.  But we did not arrive in a Rolls Royce or simmilar.  We arrived in a taxi.    When we shold lleave we had ordered a Mercedes we chaffour to take us to Heathrow. The chaufour was not allowed by the people outside the hotell to wait for us outside the hotel. He had to wait for us in a street  oppersit of the hotel.",5,2009,09,26
130,appalling !!!!,"Booked a weekend at The Dorchester for a weekend to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and my sixtieth birthday, on arrival the staff appeared to be very courteous  and obliging but after we had been out for a walk in the afternoon we received a telephone message to say the hotel needed to authorise our credit card, I attended reception and said it was not a problem but then I was advised I should telephone my bank and release more funds to cover the bill, it became very apparent the Dorchester thought we were fraudsters and fully expected us to do a ""moonlight flit"". That evening we had booked a table at Langans for dinner but the evening was completely spoiled as all we could talk about was the indignity of The Dorchesters apparent appraisal of our financial circumstances, I confronted the duty manager and advised him we had more than sufficient funds to cover whatever came our way. I also advised my wife and I had stayed in some of the best hotels in the world (Raffles, Waldorf Astoria and many top class Hiltons) and had never experienced anything like the embarrassment The Dorchester has inflicted on us. The duty manager offered us a champagne tea as way of compensation but we declined, we do not need ""free-bees"", we can pay our our way.
All we ask is that all guests are treated with respect and not made to feel insignificant because the do not turn up in a Rolls Royce or wear armani suits.
It looks suspiciously like the Hotel runs a ""postcode"" appraisal of guests, obviously ours (Sheffield)  was on their  risky  list and they wanted to make sure we did not leave without paying. What was supposed to be a celebratory weekend turned in to a nightmare and one we will remember for a long time to come and no, we will not be going back to The Dorchester, even if was free.",1,2009,09,19
130,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"As a treat for us we opted for ""Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester"" What an excellent choice it turned out to be - From the moment we arrived the Staff we polite and friendly – when we stepped out of the taxi our bags were taken off us and we went into the bar for a drink. Here we had cocktails and relaxed.  We were then shown to our table, the waiter was delightful and could not do enough for us – he made our afternoon tea very special. We started with a glass of champagne and then he went on to explain all the different teas, sandwiches and pastries we would be having. 
     The floral displays are wonderful the décor is beautiful, you feel like you’re in another world with the pianist playing through the afternoon. We did not feel hurried or rushed as the ambience in the Dorchester is very calm and unhurried. Whilst this is a real treat and not cheap it is really worth every penny and we all have wonderful memories of our trip to London.",5,2009,09,04
130,A bit disappointing...,"Stayed at the Dorchester for a romantic getaway last year. I had booked champagne and flowers in advance but unfortunately it took 3 phone calls to reception to get this organised which took the surprise element away and left a bad impression. Initially our room overlooked an air conditioning unit which was disappointing for the money we paid, the staff did however move us to a better room on request.
Breakfast was lovely, very luxurious, impeccable service. Overall, a luxurious hotel, great location but not really worth the money or hype.",3,2009,08,30
130,"no blacks, asians or dogs??","i went to the  Bar in the dorchester after eating in the allan ducaisse restaurant, i was accosted by a security thug/manager at the door who said that the bar was only for residents, I said I was a resident and this security thug continued to shout at me to show my hotel key.even when i hgav ethe key he wouldnt believe me and went ot recepytion to confirm. Im  black .on sitting down, i saw  three skimply dressed blonde hookers,chatting very cordially with the barmen. i met and chatted with a white couple who said they were not residents,. so i was sure i had been a victim of racism and discrimaination, this experience ruined my evening, and my stay in the hotel and i would think twice about staying or recommeding it.I warn other ethnic minorities about this racist policy.even when i complained to the duty manager there were no apologies from him or upper management , even though i stayed for two more days.",1,2009,08,15
130,Magical and Pure Luxury!!!,"My husband and I decided to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary by treating ourselves to a London show and a night at the Dorchester, however we had no idea that the management and staff at the Dorchester would make our special occasion even more special.

From the minute we arrived at the hotel we were treated like royalty by everyone.   Our room was upgraded to a Suite where a bottle of champagne on ice and a bowl of fruit was awaiting our arrival, followed by a tray of chocolates and flowers.   

We had afternoon tea in the Promenade and everything was just perfect - there was plenty to eat and I couldn't believe that a sandwich could be so delicious!     Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and again made us feel very special - he even brought out two small tartlets with candles to wish us a Happy Anniversary.  Breakfast was the same, perfect in every way.  

We have nothing but praise for the staff, who were all so friendly and always smiling.   Thank you to all at the Dorchester for making our 40th Anniversary an unforgettable occasion.",5,2009,08,09

It was a royal welcome for us, people were very nice, I would say personalise service 
for everything. had high  tea at the promenade its was more than a main meal.

and  we had some nibble in the room,It was a mini BBQ in your room, 
We stayed at the Belgravia  suite simply stunning views of the Hyde park,
 Toilets was better than the bed room, everything was so much in to detail.

Service was best we have ever experience in a hotel, simply extraordinary team, 
We spotted few celebrities while we are on the promenade including Prince Andrew 
we were  too shy to photograph him the experience  worth lot of money.

We had a memorable stay, highly recommend this place if you are after a treat.

We are already planning our next trip",5,2009,08,08
130,5 Star Afternoon Tea!,"After much research we opted for Afternoon Tea at the Dorchester.  An older review on Trip advisor was very helpful, and we hoped all would be still the same.   Indeed, I can confirm all the other reviewer said.   The price for the full afternoon tea (excluding champagne) is now £33.50,  plus 12% service charge, but for a truly unforgettable afternoon we felt it was worth paying.

For any special occasion it will make a perfect treat.  The staff are very friendly and hepful, and if you are not used to frequenting 5 star hotels you will not feel at all on edge!

The afternoon tea includes as many sandwiches as you can eat!  A nice selection of chicken, cheese, smoked salmon, egg mayonaise was offered.  Then a small dessert, followed by warm dainty scones (plain and fruit) with cream and jam.   You are served seconds, if requested. (we managed 4 each!)   There is a selection of small delicate cakes to finish.  

The tea menu is extensive, but not being an expert I took the waiters advise and went for the Dorchester Blend.  This was perfect - in fact you will never want a tetley tea bag again!  

The ambience in the Dorchester is very calm and unhurried.  There are only 2 sittings so you have almost 2 hours before you have to vacate the table. The pianist plays throughout the afternoon and you really feel you are in another world.  The decor is lovely, with beautiful floral displays, potted palms etc.",5,2009,07,12
130,First class,"I stayed at the Dorchester for one night only for the purpose of a special occasion. This is a world class hotel located in an exclusive part of central London. The small amount of reserved parking spaces in front of the hotel are only ever full with Ferraris, Aston Martins, and Bentleys etc.
On arrival, the lady at reception was 100% welcoming, polite and professional.
Room was luxurious, spacious and perfect.
On a separate occasion in 2007 I had dinner at the Dorchester and again the service and quality was 100% at all times.
This hotel will not come cheap, but for a special occasion/treat, you should certainly not be disappointed.",5,2009,07,12
130,Expected more....,"This was my first stay at The Dorchester - travelling with my sister who was 50 on the day of our arrival.
Check-in was great, with friendly reception staff and we were taken up to our room and shown all the amenities.
Our room was fantastic, great decor, very spacious - we had a deluxe twin room. The only downside to the room was that there was absolutely no view as we looked out on a hedge (decor as part of the front of the hotel I think). The bathroom was massive - great toiletries and an extremely deep bath.
We took Afternoon Tea in the hotel and this was a little disappointing. Tea consisted of a round of 5 types of sandwich, two very small scones each and a variety of dainty cakes and a pot of tea. All very nice, but I was disappointed that our server didn't offer a top up of tea, or more scones. In fact, once we had been served there was not much attention at all. Now, having taken tea at The Ritz I found this was a very different experience - at The Ritz the server came around on multiple occasions to check whether we required more tea, scones etc.
The hotel did excel in remembering my sisters birthday and they delivered a birthday cake and a big bunch of flowers to our room. What a great surpise and thank you very much to the management - it made my sisters day.
Breakfast the following day was a great disappointment again. My breakfast came first, while my sister had to wait 20 minutes for a Dorchester Bacon Buttie to arrive. When it did finally arrive the bacon was so fatty that she was unable to eat it. No-one came to check that we were ok or to offer us anything further to eat, or top up our tea pot. In fact we were left to it. Considering that the bill for this was £57 (luckily included in our room price) I was less than happy. Now having stayed in many Ritz Carltons and JW Marriotts breakfast came as a massive disappointment having enjoyed many fantastic breakfasts (with much more than you could ever eat) in these hotels. Granted these were in America, but why should it be so different in the UK?
We checked out after breakfast and the last comment I have to make is about the Door Staff/Concierge. The only way I could describe them was surly. I think they are used to dealing with middle eastern, or Russian, or celebrity type people and when it came to looking after 2 middle aged english ladies, they really couldn't be bothered. They left us to look for our own taxis and literally ignored us to the point of being rude. 
So - would I return to The Dorchester? No - absolutely not. It was an experience, but one not to be repeated. The food, restaurant servce and the attitude of the door staff left much to be desired.",4,2009,07,04
130,Elegant and Calm,I've never stayed at a more fabulous hotel.  The staff were beyond helpful - both at the fore and behind the scenes - and after a hectic day of touring returning to the Dorchester was like coming back to an oasis.   Travelling solo can you can sometimes feel like an anomaly - but at this hotel you will be treated with respect  many helpful hints to facilitate your experience.,5,2009,06,26
130,"In every way, worthy of its reputation.","Once in a while it is lovely to spend a little extra and stay somewhere special.  My daughter and I came to London for business for a couple of days and decided to see why my husband spoke so fondly of The Dorchester. Now, we know. Discretion, luxury, style, and every possible amenity.  The Alain Ducasse restaurant was truly outstanding - and very good value in its class for the lunch menu. View of Hyde Park on a perfect spring day was a bonus.  I can't think why I would ever pay about fifty pounds less for an ordinary hotel, when I could spend a little more and feel this papmpered.  A personal treat I shall repeat soon!",5,2009,06,24
130,Loved the Dorchester,"what can you say about the hotel that is legendary for its service and hospitality.
they do more than more to keep that reputation..",5,2009,06,02
130,A Top Notch London Hotel,"The Dorchester is the top of London elegance. Many celebs are spotted in the lobby or staying here. We chose this hotel because of it's fine reputation. We stayed in a Dorchester Suite which had two bedrooms and magnificent views of Hyde Park. The Rolls Royce picked us up from the airport and took us promptly to the hotel, the front staff (who are dressed to the nines) greeted us extremely friendly). The staff are wonderful and keen to help you. The Theatre Desk is extremely helpful in securing last minute tickets to hot shows, which in our case was the Sound of Music. The Promenade features award winning afternoon tea which we had one afternoon as well as breakfast most mornings. One day we had breakfast in the Grill Room was was a little too formal for our taste. The Bar serves lovely light lunches (we had the day we got there). Alain Ducasse is a gastronomic experience and one of the best meals I have had in my life. The Dorchester Spa is outstanding for massages as well as facials. The location of the hotel is hard to beat and overall just a great experience, no flaws in my opinion and would certainly return.",5,2009,05,20
130,"""Ultimate Luxury""","We stayed at The Dorchester in the easter half term for 2 nights. It was our second visit to the Hotel and just as good. The only draw back to staying here , is that it completely spoils you from staying anywhere else. We have as a family stayed in some beautiful hotels all over the world, but The Dorchester in our opinion is the best and most luxurious. It has a perfect position at Hyde Park Corner, which allows you to be out of the hussel and bussel , but within walking distance to most of the attractions. The hotel itself is beautiful, very classy and luxurious. The bedrooms are sumptuious with almost every amenity( no tea or coffee making facilities though). From the crisp white bedlinen, to the gorgeous marble bathrooms with floris toiletries ,it is literally a dream to stay here. On this, our second visit, there was a complimentry bottle of champagne in our room  on arrival, and handmade chocolates and gifts for the children, the Dorchester certainly  go out of their way to make you feel special . We had booked a show for our first night stay, so after a long soak in the deepest bath ever, we ordered room service and had a lovely meal brought to the room. The room service menu is quite substanial with lots to choose from and actually not as expensive as you would think, considering your in London.  You can get quite a good deal from their website, they do lots of spring and summer offers and xmas specials, which can make it affordable to stay there. 
The restaurants in the hotel seem very good also. Weve eaten in the grill room and had afternoon tea in the promenard but havent tried the alan ducasse restaurant. Also as well, the spa has undergone a refurbishment and wasnt in use  until may, so could not use the spa and pool which was a bit disappointing but hey i bet it will be superb when its done. I defy anyone not to like The Dorchester, its one of the most famous , luxurious hotels in the world, whats not to like...........!",5,2009,05,01
130,A Palace and great value too!,"There are 2 brilliant hotels at the top of the London market and this is one of them.It is a favourite of film stars.I amnot one but always receive the genuinely warm welcome that one expects at a hotel but rarely receives.
There is not a bad bedroom here.All are a decent size with crisp bed linen and superb bathrooms overloaded with Floris toiletries and fluffy towels.
The staff are kind to all,particularly children.
Room rates are fair and not as high as one might expect! The set lunch in the Ducasse restaurant is the best and best value in London today.See my recent review on Tripadvisor.
The manager here used to run the other perfect hotel,Claridges.It shows.",5,2009,04,12
130,great place top for service,"stayed here 20 dec very nice hotel we usually stay at the savoy in riverside suite but as it was a little tired its now closed for major refurb. the dorchester  roomsEXECUTIVE DELUXE DOUBLE  quite large and very nice decorated nice touch was a tea on silver tray on arrival the service in this hotel was totally spot on. the bars very nice. we eat at rodes24 in a private dinning suite which was not up to the great standard you would expect. my advice would be go to china tang or if you can eat at the krug room if you cross the road the at the top of the hilton  galvin at windows the food here was first class book a window table in advance 
in a nut shell this hotel is one of the best in london we will return and a big thanks to the management and staff totally A1",5,2009,04,10
130,the staff worried me...,"we paid over £300 for a night at the dorchester, the hotel is amazing you feel very special.The staff were most polite on the front desk and altho we were early found us a room already at no extra cost. The hotel is luxuary in every way form marble bathrooms to £80 bath robes ( take the free slippers instead!) however i went shopping in selfridges and purchased items one of which was a handbag, not being able to wait i unwrapped my bag and left the cloth bag along with tissue paper in the large selfridges bag and placed it with all my other shopping in the corner of the room and went to the 99 comedy club. when i returned some later hours i went to put my new bag away and the selfridges bag along with cloth bag and tissue paper had gone,i rung house keeping who were sent bin diving to find it but didnt understand i wanted the cloth bag they kept comming up with selfridges bags. In the end it all got silly and we said not to bother as at this point we had found out staff were trawling through bins. The dorchester didnt seem fussed and explained it was all rubbish i kept explaining it wasnt and this made me angry that they had gone through my shopping and thrown items away. If it had of been rubbish i would have put it by the bins but the fact it was with all my other shopping i would've thought i made it clear it wasnt rubbish?

upon my return home i was sent a letter stating they had taken the liberty of charging the mini bar to my card furious that i had not had anything from the mini bar i contacted the manager who i the end refunded me.

Now what bothers me are the staff , if my items were thrown out and then i am charged for a mini bar i did not use items such as champange! i really do wonder about the house keeping!

The hotel was wonderful and yes i would recommend it but at the same time i would say put your belongings away and ask for the mini bar to be emptied on arrival if you have no plans to use it.",5,2009,04,10
130,The Dorchester made my anniversary super special,"We had a wonderful one night stay at The Dorchester last weekend. My husband had booked it as a surprise for our anniversary and we were upgraded on arrival, which was nice. In our room there was complimentary champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries, along with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary from the manager. 

We left the freebies and went down to have afternoon tea, which my husband had booked. The service was excellent, and just before we left we were presented with a lovely cake, again wishing us a Happy Anniversary. A bonus for us was spotting Russell Crowe striding through the hotel lobby! 

We have stayed at The Dorchester before (we got married there) and have always found the bedrooms spacious (for London) and well equipped. The best thing about The Dorchester is the baths! They are wonderfully deep and the water pressure means they fill very quickly.

Making use of the information that the hotel gives you we took a running route map with us on a jog around Hyde Park the next morning, which was fun. We followed this up with a hearty breakfast in The Promenade. In addition to the full English they also do a health breakfast which is absolutely great…the carrot muffins are really, really good.

Another wonderful stay at The Dorchester, where we were spoilt rotten in spite of being mere proles staying in the cheapest room available.",5,2009,04,06
130,Simply Stunning,"There is no other way to describe our 7 nights at the Dorchester, but ""simply stunning"".
We recieved a phone call a week prior to departure from Melbourne Australia confirming our booking- that I had made on line. When making the booking I had mentioned in the e-mail that my partner was celebrating his 60th birthday and they rang to ask his name,  so we discovered later they could wish him a happy birthday, everything about the Dorchester was 5 star.
On arrival we were upgraded to a beautful room with large sitting area and huge marble bathroom. Champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries were waiting for the the two of us with a hand written happy birthday card for my partner, from the Hotel's General Manager.
A valet was sent to unpack our luggage immediately.
We had room service twice for dinner over the 7 night stay and the standard was way above the normal room service dinner offering of most 5 star hotels.
The Dorchester makes everything appear seamless. No matter what time of day you left your room it was always made up on your return. Even if you only went downstairs for a drink- the staff knew and the bathroom was refreshed etc etc.
Evening turndown service was excellent and the location in the middle of everything as walking is so easy and pleasurable around Mayfair.
I have stayed in many other hotels in London in the Mayfair area and while the Dorchester is without doubt the most expensive, it is worth every cent.
Every member of the Dorchester team should be congratulated for not only what they deliver but the way the deliver it.
We cannot wait to return to the Simply Stunning Dorchester.",5,2009,04,06
130,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing.","As a treat for my daughter's birthday we recently went to the Dorchester for Afternoon tea.  From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel so welcome and with smiles and hellos from everyone.  We were quickly shown to our table,  The Promenade, where afternoon tea is served is sumptuously decorated and I sat on a beautiful sofa with plumped cushions and my daughter in an oversized extremely comfortable armchair.  The staff were courteous, prompt, and efficient and yet everything felt relaxed, the piano player in the middle of the room played easy on the ear numbers, just at the right level so you could carry on a conversation with ease.  The food was great,  I loved the selection of sandwiches, which the waiter came and offered more of and as much of them as we liked, the scones were melt in the mouth with the best jam ever and of course the delicious clotted cream to go with them.  The pastries were a delight on the palate and the waiter, as with all the food explained what each one was and what was in them.  I joked with one waiter if he had tried all the cakes himself to the reply of ""yes I admit I tried them all""  but, he, like me loved the scones best though my daughter adored the cakes, actually it was hard to decide.  A well known personality passed by at one stage, but at the Dorchester everyone is made to feel special so it was no big deal.   The best was yet to come for as I mentioned it was my daughter's birthday and one of the waiters came out with a gorgeous chocolate cake complete with candle and the piano player played Happy Birthday.  Of course we had to have some, it was amazing and what was left  they put in a box for us.  There is a time limit on your stay  however this was never an issue as we were never hurried and and at all times were made to feel totally relaxed.  I cant wait to go back again it was the best afternoon tea experience ever.",5,2009,03,29
130,Lived up to its name!,"Having stayed and was impressed by its sister hotel in Milan, I had made a two nights reservation at The Dorchester months ahead. Enjoyed special weekend rates (265 pounds) for a Deluxe room with full English breakfasts included. 

Upon arrival, we were shown to a """"suite-like"""" room, which I learnt later  was a small upgrade to their Executive room, about 50 pounds extra a night. What a gesture, I thought! The room, number 709, was located at the corner of the building, rather large but not overly so - walk in area leads to separated small closet area, bathroom (very deep tub indeed!) and a door leading to the bedroom. 

The bedroom is quite spacious, with a lovely four poster bed - very romantic indeed. There was a sofa chair in the room, with work desk, make up table and mirror. I had asked for a Hyde Park view room earlier, but wasn't too impressed with the view when I actually saw it ... lots of greenery but with no flowers in sight, slightly disappointed. 

The hotel is facing a busy road, so there was some road noise during the day. At night, it was rather quiet for a good nights sleep though. Common areas though very classy and elegant, surprisingly, is not overly large. It basically contains two restaurants, The Promenade and The Grill.

Breakfasts at The Promenade was both yummy and high quality. 3 course set lunch at The Grill was rather good value and tasty. However, I had food poisoning a few hours after eating my medium cooked ''Wild Salmon"" - do be careful if ordering this dish.. ...My husband's roast beef was pretty good, though.  

Overall, our two nights stay here was as wonderful and memorable as it could be. However, these are some areas the Hotel could improve upon -
1. there was no iron and ironing board in the room
2. no coffee or tea making facility in the room
3. the Queen sized bed was a tad small 
4. location to the neartest tube station was a 10-12 minutes walk (not the hotel's fault) 
5. slightly noisy during the day, even when room was on the 7th floor

This famous hotel is located in the classy Mayfair residential district, where you could see some Bently, Mercedes S-class, Rolls Royce etc. However, to get to some shopping or some eating, you would have to walk at least 8-10 minutes. Staff are all well trained and polite. 

Book this hotel and you won't regret staying here!",5,2009,03,28
130,Excellent hotel,"This was my first time at the Dorchester and hope to visit again.  The location is excellent right across from Hyde Park and a short walk to the Hyde Park Circle Tube stop.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  Had breakfast in the lounge and ordered room service, both of which were prompt and yummy!  Large rooms with wonderful bathrooms.   Just an overall excellent hotel.",5,2009,03,26
130,Classic & Elegant,"If you are used to staying at 5 star hotels in the US this is going to be a little different in that its not new and huge.  Rather it has a classic feel to it.  Its an older hotel.  The service is very good and the tea lounge is fantastic.  The rooms felt average, but a good size.  Again this is probably because I'm used to newer plush hotel rooms.  But the bathroom was superb.  Huge tub, towel warmers, marble, etc.  
The hotel location was pretty good in that it was central, but you need a cab to get to something.  Unlike the Ritz or the Mandarin which are across the street from lots of shopping opportunities.  There is also an excellent but pricey French restaurant in this hotel.",4,2009,03,23
130,Didn't live up to expectation,"Having stayed once before was looking forward to a three night stay in a junior suite, booked direct with hotel.

Helpful, courteous pick up at airport from an early morning flight. Was informed at check in that the room type we had booked was not yet ready, hardly surprising as it was still only 0800. We were offered a ""very nice superior room"" as being available immediately. having slept adequately in overnight first on TG and being keen to get out and explore we were happy to wait for the junior suite to become ready later in the day. I wasn't given any other information on the room we were being offered to know whether to accept it or not and was concerned not to end up paying for a basic room when i had booked a ""junior suite"".

What a mistake! The ""suite"" was adjacent to intrusive AC compressors, and was best described as low ceilinged council house 1980s chic overlooking more of the same - think Peabody trust without the altrusitic pricing structure. Lots of swaggy curtains, yet nowhere to unpack a suitcase and a Holiday Inn style bathroom with a marble tiled makeover. Except the shower screen din't fit and meant the bathroom floor was drenched whenever one showered.

Despite assurances that our luggage would be in the room when we returned at 2.30 pm, it wasn't. The receptionist who escorted us to the room assured me he would arrange for it immediately once the oversight was realised. I imagine he forgot. 20 minutes later I called the bell desk, the luggage arrived about 10 minutes later.

We decided to freshen up before dinner with a steam to sweat out 11 hours of flying. The spa / steam room was closed for renovation. I was starting to get a bit tetchy by this stage, but the concierge was helpful and arranged for us to use the steam room at the Park Lane Hilton. That, followed by a pint in Shepherds Market, made me realise that there were numerous alternative hotels that would work for us and offering better value too. On our return I informed the receptionist that we planned to check out early. She helpfully informed me that we had already been given a room upgrade and that there was nothing to be done. I'd hoped for service  - not freebie upgrades. Shame.

We returned to the room just after 8pm. It hadn't been made up. 

I called the Duty Manager, more to vent frustration at the P--- poor service and VFM that the Dorchester was peddling. To his credit he seemed concerned and to want to make a difference. He asked what he could do to make amends. Having irretrievably lost faith in the Dorchester's ability to deliver service or value it might have helped more if he could have suggested something himself. In my jetlagged state I could only suggest he made sure our revised check out date was noted by reception so that I could move to a hotel that ""did what it says on the tin"".

A bill of around 800 pounds for an overnight stay was presented in the morning. We moved to the Park Lane Sheraton, which promises rather less but delivered substantially more - at half the price.

The positives? Breakfast is pretty good. Should be at 35 pounds or so, but I don't begrudge paying for quality. 

Sadly, the rest of our Dorchester ""experience"" fell shamefully short.",2,2009,03,16
130,Wonderful hotel with great service,"My daughter and I spent 2 nights at the hotel with her friend to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Our room was ready when we checked in at 1030am which was a nice surprise.  The room was beautiful and there was more than enough room for the 3 of us.  When we got back from our day out there was a huge dessert tray with a small birthday cake for my daughter.  The girls loved it to say the least.  The staff is extremely accomodating and look to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need.  My only complaint would be that they charge you renting a DVD player whereas other hotels in this class all have DVD players in the rooms and they are complimentary.  While the hotel is not the cheapest in London, the service, location  and rooms are fantastic.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,03,02
130,"Great staff, professional staff","We stayed at the Dorchester for a Wedding at the end of December and can say that the standards of the hotel lived up to expectation.  

It isn't cheap but you are in a central London hotel and can get some good deals.  The rooms were well decorated and spacious with a large bathroom. 

All staff were very profssional and courteous and couldnt do enough to help.

 The only slight disappointment was the very poor service at breakfast but staff were very apologetic and removed service charge from the bill.",4,2009,02,21
130,Fantastic totally wonderful,"stayed for one night, had booked one one room but staff said would be more comfortable with an adjoining room for kids so offered one complimentary!! The staff cannot help enough they are so friendly. We had breakfast in our room and it arrived boiling hot perfectly cooked even the boiled eggs were just right.  We ate at the chinese restaurant on site Tangs and had the most amazing meal ever.  The staff there were just as wonderful. The hotel is truly fantastic and we are booking again for a few nights at Easter. If you want fantastic service then this is the hotel for you.",5,2009,02,20
130,Reliable quality,"I have stayed at The Dorchester several times now on business. Whilst expensive there are some excellent rates to be obtained on the hotel website.  This time I had a Park View room which was worth the extra.   Quality and service is on a level rarely seen in London and all the staff always go out of their way to ensure you are happy.  My only niggle is the price of any extras.....a late night room -service supper cost almost £70, if I had put on a movie it would have cost £13 and as for the mini-bar....I would have needed to take out a loan.  So avoid the extras but enjoy the best  hotel in London.",5,2009,02,13
130,Fantastic week-end at The Dorchester,"My wife and I booked into The Dorchester to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday.  We told the staff and were upgraded to a superior suite.  While at the hotel we ate at the Alain Ducasse restaurant on the ground floor.  All the staff, the room, the attention to detail and the hotel atmosphere were truly fantastic.  Nothing could be faulted - we had champagne in the room, a surprise birthday cake, rose petals on the bed and a view over Hyde park.  The staff greeted us by name, we were escorted to our room by the on-duty manager and the food in the Alain Ducasse restaurant beat some I have had in Michelin-starred restaurants in France.  We paid a lot for the experience, but would not hesitate to go to this hotel again, for a celebration or for a relaxing week-end retreat.  I give it 6 stars!",5,2008,11,30
130,A solid 5-star experience,"The Dorchester hotel is a true 5-star property. I prebooked an airport transportation to the hotel which was worth the money (£145). Room wasn't ready (10 am) so I was offered a complimentary breakfast. It seems that the hotel is very busy from 10am 'tll 2 pm  so it took quite time before my luggages arrived in my room (I had to call the front desk). Room was nice and clean in the 8th floor of the hotel.

Service in general is very attentive. I really enjoyed the bar where the service was fabulous. I disliked the breakfast where the service was a bit slow. I personally prefer buffet breakfasts instead of the ones ordered from the menus.

Although I enjoyed staying at the Dorchester I may try some other hotel next time.",4,2008,11,25
130,Mad Hatter's Tea Party,"Afternoon tea at this outstanding hotel was the highlight of our 30th anniversery celebrations. Luxurious but not pretentious, the service could not have been better and all the staff excellent. Everything was personal and the food outstanding!

Considering what we got staying at The Russell, for very little less cost but torn wallpaper, very basic accomodation and indifferent service, we now rate The Dorchester as an excellent experience and true value for money. It is a time capsule of old fashioned courtesy and service in outstanding surroundings.",5,2008,11,13
130,Luxury with a capital L,"Booked  room direct with hotel, no problems encountered on arrival greeted and shown to upgraded room which was outstanding, however my daughter was in an executive suite and we would have preferred her large bathroom, but our room was more individual.

Staff were pleasant and helpful at all times, breakfast yummy try the white pudding delicious on the whole we would definately stay again",4,2008,11,09
130,A great surprise,"We normally stay at The Berkeley however it was full so decided to try here. We found: rooms great, gym - dark but contained above average equipment, location good and the bar well worth a visit.

A few niggles: Internet difficult to use, VERY expensive even by London standards for anything purchased in the hotel. We ate at the Scottish themed restaurant [can't remember the name] the food was VERY VERY expensive and awful.",4,2008,11,06
130,gorgeous hotel but lacks in service !,"stayed at the dorchester on 31st october for 2 nights with my husband and 2 yr old daughter and i will make it brief.The room was gorgeous really classy and old style decorated but super massive marble bathrooms, with excellent floris toiletries, although we had a few niggles with the room the sound system didnt work very well and was too loud so you also couldnt turn it down so you had to leave it switched off, so told the front desk a few times and it took them 3 hrs before anyone appered to fix it, although they didnt they just switched the speakers off so we only had sound from the tv and not the sound in the bathroom and our lobby?

the promenade is lovely and spotless with loads of staff but very slow in parts and it sometimes was very hard to get a table here as lots of people not booked into the hotel would while there afternoons here at the promenade which was a problem for us as if we wanted a drink to celebrate our 10yrs wedding anniversary we had to try for a table here as our daughter wasnt allowed in the bar. Also at breakfast although very nice was slow and had to ask about 4-5 people and wait around 20 mins before we would get a highchair?

During our stay here our daughter hurt her arm and was screaming in pain with it but they said they couldnt help so i had to get a taxi there and back to a chemist somewhere in london on saturady night just to get calpol childrens paracetamol they said they couldnt get this for me? 

overall the hotel is good but the service is not great at all, well not 5 stars anyway andit is also a little impersonal i think if they can sort out some of the niggles then they would truly be deserving of there 5 stars but when you pay 300 pounds + a night you expect a lot more than this. 

I would try somewhere else next time, and having stayed at the chesterfield and the milestone these hotels were far better in service standards so the dorchester could learn from these hotels!!!",3,2008,11,04
130,Tranquility and Luxury in London,"We stayed at the Dorchester for a short break, this is not a cheap hotel but you get what you pay for! The art of a good hotel is making you feel comfortable and special and the hotel managed this beautifully. 

This hotel is a real taste of tranquillity within the hustle and bustle of London. The location to Hyde Park was great and we walked to Kensington without any problems. 

We were impressed by the décor and the comfort and found our room (king deluxe) to be large and elegant, yet comfortable. We ate in the restaurant one night and although this is not the price we would normally pay we felt that we had a very special and memorable meal. (Vegetarians were well catered for!) Breakfast was unhurried and you would be hard pushed to not find something on the menu to suit your taste buds!

My only comment would be that the rooms needed tea and coffee making facilities, (£16 for two teas seemed quite steep to us!) but if that is the only negative who’s complaining!

Overall  this was fabulous experience, a real taste of the deluxe end of the market and well worth the money for a special occasion.",5,2008,11,03
130,First Class Luxury Hotel!,"I stayed in the Dorchester with my husband Saturday just gone for 2nights. We had a wonderful stay. I booked about 5days in adavance on the website, got a great deal for £529 in a Superior double room. Its the lowest grade room they do, but you wouldn't think it! It was amazingly comfortable. Classic English beauty, a gorgeous bathroom with the most luxurious deep bath! :)
When we checked in, we were told we had a complimetary upgrade as we were celebrating a birthday, but was soon told there had been a mistake...We wasn't too fussed. Our room wasnt ready so they offered us drinks in the bar.

When we arrived in our room there was complimentary champagne on ice, chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely choc birthday cake which was all lovely.

I really cnt fault anything about this hotel, we wil definatley be returning. 
I wouln't reccomend it to anyone on  budget though...2hours in th bar with about 6drinks 3of which non-alcoholic and a club sandwich came to about £166....Second night we had dinner in the promenade, which was wonderful. Fairly priced too £75 for 2meals, 1 desert and 4soft drinks.
Service is second to none, especially the room service breakfast. Cooked to perfection and enough to feed a small army!

Will definatley be returning this year and cant wait! A true Gem of London.",5,2008,10,23
130,Treated like royalty,"My husband and i stayed at The Dorchester for 1 night. We booked a deluxe room which was a large size room with a wonderful bathroom.

It was our anniversary upon arrival we were shown to our room and within 10 minutes of us being there we were suprised with chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne, what a lovely touch.

Everywhere we went in the hotel we were greeted by name and wished a happy anniversary.

I would recommend this hotel without a moments hesitation as it is in a great location, has excellent breakfast which we had in our room and is well appointed.",5,2008,10,15
130,loved The Dorchester,"We have been in London several times this year and stayed in quite a few really good hotels, but, I think The Dorchester wins top prize for that extra special  stay.  We have only just returned today and already I have been on their website to check availability for our next stay.  We were celebrating a 50th birthday and on check in found that our room had been upgraded to an executive suite. I mentioned when booking that it was for a birthday present, can you imagine the surprise when we also received a birthday cake and a card from the hotel.   I don't think anything could have been any better.  The staff were fantastic, really helpful.  I think you know from the minute you arrive outside the front of the hotel that you're going somewhere special.",5,2008,09,28
130,Great English Hotel - Not so Great English Breakfast,"Chose the Dorchester for an overnight stay in London after lunch at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Claridges because we love the feel of the established London hotels. 

The hotel itself is lovely, room was great, fantastic bathroom etc..

My only issue is with the breakfast. We were booked on a B&B rate but if I had paid the menu price of £29.50 for the English breakfast I would have refused to settle the bill (when I was checking out I heard someone making the same point to the receptionist). The food was cold, the sausage was like something from the local cafe, and the eggs were overdone. My wife's scrambled eggs were like rubber. 

We normally would have stayed at Claridges but fancied a change - please visit there to see how breakfast should be made and presented. 

What a shame Dorchester - we will not return and will not recommend you to friends.",3,2008,09,28
130,Classical Charm with a Modern Twist,"We have just returned from a short break in London having stayed at The Dorchester as part of a 20th Wedding Anniversary treat.  All I can say is this that it was worth every penny spent.  The hotel is amazing and not pretentious in anyway,  as it could quite easily be.

A great asset to the hotel is their staff who help to create a wonderful relaxed atmosphere.  They were all extremely welcoming, from the doorman to the maids, nothing was too much trouble and everyone spoke to you. All I can say is that it my visit way surpassed my expectations and I am  already saving up for my next visit.  The hotel has recently be refurbished and  has been done very sympathetically especially the Promenade which is a lovely area to take tea/breakfast etc.  

Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Not the cheapest but if you want to a mix of relaxed seer luxury then this is an absolute must. I am pleased we chose this over the Ritz however I have warned my husband that it would be good to compare them at some point!",5,2008,09,22
130,You get what you pay for,"Given the minimum amount of time and wanting the maximum refreshing break, I booked my wife and I into the Dorchester for a weekend. We'd had drinks and eaten at the hotel before, so were looking forward to staying overnight. 
Quality of staff is pretty much everything at a premium hotel, and the friendliness of everyone, from the doorman to the maitre'd was very welcoming. No pretension here.
The room was very comfortable, though it lacked a view, facing on to the inner courtyard. The bed, and partiuclarly the pillows, were excellent. Breakfast in the morning was a real treat of just about anything you could wish for, though a better choice of fish may have suited others better.
To while away an evening in the Promenade listening to the live trio, sipping a few glasses of wine, is one of the treats in life. The Dorchester does exaclty what a five star hotel should do - it indulges and provides an escape from the stresses of modern life. That it does so with a complete lack of pretension makes it close to perfect.
One word of advice - the spa is tired and not particuarly well equipped, though I understand a refurbishment is coming soon.
Overall I would throughly recommend the hotel",5,2008,09,09
130,Classic full 5-star experience,"A true 5-star experience but in the classic mode.  May feel a bit too 'old world' for a more contempory/younger traveller (i.e., Mr and Mrs Hip Hotels).  Remains a benchmark for the lover of classic hotels/older traveller.

Great location, very high standard of fit-out (this is not an aging 5-star like several other London properties), classic style (heavily carpetted, velvet wallpaper, white marble bathrooms etc.).

Lovely luxury gound floor lounge (lot of money changing hands and walking around this area !).  Donetalla Versache passed me one day and Celiene Dion the next.  Bar is a bit small.

Contains series of amazing restaurants including China Tang (one of the best chinese restaurants in London).

Brilliant service - one of the best concierage desks in London (got me straight into the Woolsley on a busy Friday night).

You may not love it but you will never hate it !",5,2008,09,04
130,Avoid at all cost !!,"Check in was the worst I have ever experienced,the staff was so arrogant and unpleasant...The hotel is filled with people from the Middle East and Russians, so if you do not fit in this category you are not considered at all and the atmosphere in the lobby is somehow unpleasant..We had booked a deluxe category , the room we were shown  was so small and dark that we asked to change and we finally were given a room of a more decent size, the carpet had just been changed so there was a strong smell. We had to call three times housekeeping in order to get an extra duvet, it took just under an hour to have it brought to our room.
Next morning breakfast was a disgrace, the scrambled eggs were cold , the service was sloppy.",1,2008,08,31
130,Loved it!,"Stayed in the Dorchester last month and loved it. Yes its expensive but the hotel is beautiful. Staff were excellent and very friendly. Rooms were very nice and location is great, with nice restaurants in the area. All I can say is I can't wait to return.",5,2008,08,03
130,Love The Dorchester,"The Dorchester is not hip or cool or stylish.  It's old fashioned all the way & yet it's wonderful.  

We had one night there on the 25 May for a treat.  It's our second visit.  We'd booked a junior suite & were upgraded to a suite which was large & decorated in the elaborate english floral fabric style which works well in this setting.

The housekeeping is impeccable & generous.  The products in the bathroom are great.

The bed was comfortable.  The sound proofing worked very well.

The staff were without exception lovely & warm.  There was no hovering for tips & in one instance a tip was actually refused !

We ate a light dinner in The Promenade & again it's old fashioned a bit like a hollywood movie with a pianist playing dated songs & singing in a passable voice.  But for all that we had a nice meal - it was very comfortable & the food was fresh & plentiful & very tasty & the staff were helpful without being intrusive.

We had a lovely stay.",5,2008,05,26
130,Beautiful place but letchy tip-hogging staff and stiff clientele,"Upon spending £300 for a night here, I was expecting a wonderfully relaxing stay.

I knew that wasn't going to happen when a letchy check-in boy from eastern europe showed us to our room and showed us a bedroom, a bathroom and er, is there anything else sir?  Urr, no, why, should there be?  Okay, it's a bedroom and er, yes, so it is, it's a bathroom.

Of course, he was hanging around like a bad smell for his ahem, tip and he wasn't half brazen about it.

The tip culture really ruined this hotel for me and my wife.  It was really in your face and blatent.  You couldn't break wind without someone hinting heavily for a tip.

The porter came to take our bags and pointed loudely to the number of bags, repeating the number of bags that were on his trolley.  I wouldn't mind but I put most of them on his trolley in the first place!

To get out of the hotel cost me £30 in tips!  £10 for the porter, £10 for the maids (who I insist on tipping because they do all the work and get the least credit whilst the mini-bar letchers are rolling in it), and £10 for the guy who got my car (the car parking having cost me £50 for parking there for about 12 hours!).

We went to the restaurant early because we had a baby with us.  That was fine until the stuffy clientele made us feel like we were sat there with two heads.  The helpful manager having sat us down in the corner and then despite a large empty restaurant, put a romancing couple directly next to us.

The food was from the chinese place, tiger something maybe?  Food was at best, below average and the atmosphere very stuffy. Wouldn't recommend it.

I would love this place if it were more child friendly, staff who are friendly because they're actually pleasant people rather than fighting to please you for a big tip (most of whom looked scared to loosen up a bit in case of ""the frown"".

My best advice would be stay here, enjoy it and don't give them letches tips.",2,2008,05,12
130,The BEST!,"The staff and service here are first class all the way.  The rooms are very luxurious.   My room overlooked the park.     Great location for easy walking if you want.   We were treated like royalty.  In fact, royalty was actually there at the time.    Pricey, but if you can afford it, you can't do much better in London.",5,2008,05,04
130,If you think the Dorchester if poor...........,"Service in hotels is not what is used to be anywhere in the world.

I have stayed at many of  the best over the years, and consider the Dorchester up there among the World Class leaders with its World Class prices!!!

If you want to visit a poorly run 5* hotel, then walk five hundred meters down Park Lane to the Hilton Flagship! It gives new meaning to the word POORLY RUN!!!!

Why oh why are London Hotels so damned expensive...... Rip Off Britain.",5,2008,04,26
130,Failed Completely to Live Up to its Reputation,"What could go wrong did go wrong during our recent stay at The Dorchester.  And a previous guest, I can say without qualitifcation that the hotel is not even close to what it used to be.  

Starting with our arrival at the hotel on foot, the doorman did not even offer to help us with our bags but, rather, pointed to the door adjacent to the revolving door through which we pulled our own bags.

Once in, there was a protracted wait at check in, and then when I produced the confirmation number for the Hyde Park view 39 sq. metre room I had booked through my travel agent, I was told abruptly that there had been a mistake, that the rate I was quoted was only for a Mayfair rooftoop room of smaller dimensions.  I insisted on the room we reserved and a manager was called, who said we could have it but only if we agreed to pay 65 GPB ($130) more each night.  Only when I produced the written confirmation for the room at the rate I was promised, did the manager ungraciously relent, and agree to the agreed-upon rate.

Then, through a comedy of errors, the mini-bar inspector woke us from our jet lag nap, and the piercing fire alarms sounded during  a test that concluded our rest.  The phones all failed to work for a number of hours, for which the front desk barely apologized.

Housekeeping twice forgot to provide turn-down service, and room service took a full 40 minutes for breakfast delivery.

Moreover, the charming, art deco ambiance is long gone, replaced by a Hotel Monaco kitschy-looking orange lobby.

Once worth the splurge, the Dorchester is one of the poorest values in London where one feels like an imposition rather than a welcome guest.",2,2008,04,20
130,Unexciting Hotel Rooms with Fabulous Afternoon Tea in The Promenade,"The Dorchester is famous, one of the Grande Dames of London. Celebrities galore used to stay here, and the hotel has a 5 star rating.

The hotel's web site is stunning. The lobby really does look like that.

However, in reality, the bedrooms themselves bear little resemblance to the glorious pictures you will see on their website.

It is an old-fashioned rabbit warren of a hotel. Long, stuffy hallways are without windows to let in light or air.

The rooms were all redone perhaps five years ago. 

Smoking is allowed in each of them. 

The front desk manager, Aiden Griffin, claims that housekeeping has machines that bring the air quality up to standard after each guest has checked out.

Since I can smell the lingering odor of cigarettes the second I walked into each room, I disagree.

Aiden shows me to three different room types.

The Stanhope Suite is on the 8th flor, and has no view. It is depressing, and could be found in any corporate hotel in the U.S.

The Jr. Suite has no view either, and is done in an art deco style. There is a shower over the tub, rather than a separate shower and tub.

The Executive Room has a park view, and is nice, done with a traditional decor.

If you are a smoker, and you choose a room with a park view, this hotel may work for you.

Now comes the fun part :

Afternoon Tea

It is served in the famous Promenade, a high ceilinged room with gilt crown molding on two enormous soffets.

The green and gold room is magnificent, recalling times when dressing up was expected.

Blue jeans or sneakers would not dare to make an appearance here.

A gray-and-white marble floor covered by rugs in the center of the room.

Heavily tufted benches with backs and green armchairs beckon invitingly. My back rests against an incredibly comfortable pillow.

The room is not noisy, despite being full. Thanks to the good acoustics of abundant use of fabrics throughout, conversations are skillfully muted.

The piano player is playing something nice.

Orange and gold silk curtains flank gilt mirrors above each of the sofa benches, and add to the lushness.

Arrangements of orange tulips, potted palms, and 4 politically incorrect blackamoor women statues bearing fresh flowers or carrying spears accessorize the room.

Orange and gold marble pillars with gold trim at the tops define the spaces, which are nicely lit by chandeliers and floor lamps..

Wearing a black tailcoat and tie, quite formally dressed, Gavin was my server.

3 orange roses in a bud vase on the table are tired looking and need replacing.

White Haviland Limoge China ""Illusion"" by Barbara Barry has silver edging and delicate handles.

The Robbe & Berking silver-plated service is lovely.

Sugar cubes in a chine pot come with silver tongs.

I am offered a choice of tea, and choose jasmine. It is poured through a strainer from a heavily decorated silver pot.

One cucumber sandwich on rye with the crusts removed and one smoked salmon sandwich on farmhouse brown bread with the crusts removed are served, both tasteless. More sandwiches are brought around, and I decline.

A parfait is brought around, consisting of orange segments with pastry cream and lemon crumbs. It is lightly chilled and overly sweet.

Scones are to be next.

Strawberry and black currant jam are brought in china bowls on a plate, accompanied by clotted cream.

The freshly made plain scone is delicious. Soft and slightly warm, it melts in my mouth, the clotted cream spreading like room temperature butter.

The fruit scone studded with raisins is equally delicious.

By now, I'm totally stuffed, but Afternoon Tea still has another surprise - a tray of pastries is still there to be tasted.

A delicate almond paste with candied grape and powdered sugar, and a dollop of whipped cream in a scallop shape.

A chocolate and cream cake.

An incredible fruit tart without any glaze. One raspberry, blueberry, blackberry and strawberry on a soft french macaroon.

I just want to sit back and bask in the comfort of it all :) This is something to do when you have time to relax and simply savor, unhurried.

An indulgent afternoon treat. I don't want to leave...",4,2008,04,08
130,The Dorchester is a Total 5* Experience!,"My family of five (3 children ages 8, 10 and 12) just stayed with the Dorchester for 5 nights.  We had interconnecting rooms, one with a king for the parents and one room with three twin beds for the kids.  The accomodations were beautiful, spacious, clean.  We booked through the hotel directly and paid 275 British pounds per night for our stay, due to a wonderful Easter promotion.  (Parents stay in one room and the children's room was complimentary!)  The bathrooms are huge.  It is located on Park between Hyde Park and Marble Hill tube stops.  We enjoyed afternoon tea on Easter (quite costly!)  We didn't really fit in to the luxurious lobby and Promenade when we would return from sightseeing each day in our sneakers (trainers) and jeans but who cares?  I highly recommend this hotel and hope to return one day.  Great location!",5,2008,03,30
130,Top stay,"The Dorchester,

Maybe i have been extremely lucky but when looking for a hotel in London, close to the area where i had to attend a dinner, i came across 'The Dorchester'.
Having heard a lot about 'The Dorchester ',  they happened to have a promotion in February and could book a single room at  £200 (excl taxes, 15%), which for London standards is very, very good price for a hotel with that class.
The reception was rather cool, but the good news was that for one or the other reason i got  'an upgrade'. Frankly speaking when booking i thought i would get an overpriced,small, crampy London hotel room but all of a sudden i found myself in a very nice luxury top class room with marble bathroom. 
During my stay i had nothing to complain and treated myself the next morning with an (overpriced) Englisk breakfast, but all in all a lovery experience.

Thanks Dorchester, a stay to remember...",5,2008,03,12
130,I was very very impressed,"My friend and I stayed here in January for one night.  We got a really good deal of £235 direct from the hotel, so we decided to treat ourselves.  

We were met at the reception by a really nice lady, it was only 10.30am yet our room was ready for us.  She escorted us up to the room, showed us where everything was and was really helpful with our questions.

We had complimentary fruit delivered by a nice little man.

The beds are sooo comfy!!  we stayed in them until the last minute possible the next day - we didnt want to leave.

I would say this is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in, and I've just booked again for March for 2 nights to treat my mum.",5,2008,02,18
130,Deserves it's 5 stars,"The Dorchester offers all you would expect but with the bonus of exceptional staff.

Our room, although small, was well equipped. The bed was blissfully comfy. Lovely large bathroom (the enormous bath filled in about 2 mins) with a good selection of Floris products. The minibar was well stocked.

The public areas are a bit garish for my tastes but well maintained with stunning flower arrangements. 

Spent an hour in the spa which was  disappointing because the mens & womens areas are separate, so no lounging in the jacuzzi with my husband. The spa reception is a lovely place to relax with tea after treatments. I didn't have any treatments but met a lady in the changing rooms who offered good reports.

Breafast was good. I  got the impression that you could order anything & the staff would try & provide it. Morning coffee in bed arrivred within 5 mins of ordering.

What sets this hotel ahead from it's rivals is the staff. From the moment we checked in until departure we found the staff unfailing helful. Not fawning, just friendly. The service cannot be faulted.

For central London I don't think you could do much better.

PS. if driving I'd use the  hotel valet parking. We used the underground car park up Park lane which was dark, damp & seedy. I felt uncomfortable even in daylight.",4,2008,01,21
130,Its still one of the great hotels of the world,"We always have a weekend at the Dorchester in January to get over the christmas blues.
Once again the Dorchester didn't disappoint. 
The reception staff were very friendly and we were able to check in early and get in the room. The room as always was stunning, The bathroom is about the size of most hotel rooms. 
The bath (WOW) ,easily fits 2 and you can fill it so deep its heaven on earth !!!.
Everything you would expect from a 5*, linen, decor, top quality TV,
We had breakfast sent up to the room, full english cooked to perfection, big plate of pastries, fresh orange juice etc etc all presented on a table wheeled in to the room with fresh flowers (quality)
They even gave us a late check out (no charge)
If you go out of season this hotel is great value for money £240 per night with breakfast, for the quality of room and the service you get it is great value.

Cant wait to go back !!!",5,2008,01,06
130,"Great to experience it, loved most of it, but some parts a little bit lacking","Stayed here after a news years break to Paris, arriving on a later Eurostar service so decided to try the Dorchester. I have alwasy wondered whehter such a renowned hotel would live up to its reputation. 

Its certainly elegant and pretty and has a definite aura of grandure. If anything lets it down (and perhaps stops it being as good as some of its competitors such as Four Seasons and Mandarin Orinetal for example) it can be the staff. Dont get me wrong the service is good, but all too often just a little bit curt and abrupt and lacking sincerity. I understand that New Years Day, being a bank holiday etc and at the end of what must have been a very busy season for the staff, however when a hotel charges what they charge and i suspect has aspirations of being ranked amongst the best in the world, then it really needs the service to be exceptional. That sounds like im expecting perfection, and im not, just some sincerity. 

Only main niggle with the public areas of the hotel was that the main bar closed at 12 midnight (no issue with this - we moved to the promenade area). We ordered a drink and 3 minutes later were told that it was going to be last orders there in 10 minutes. Seems a bit odd for such a classical establishment to close all their bars like that. There were still plenty people drinking etc, and no alternative was suggested so i assume that was the only option. 

The Room was very well appointed. Spacious and comfortable and everything clean and as it should be. Everything worked and the bed was extremely comfortable. TV - Bang and Olefsen, very good sound. The bathroom was marble, and quite spacious, situated along a little hallway. My only gripe with the room was the ceiling in this hallway was a suspended ceiling (and a badly suspended one at that - just not what you expect)

Selection from the mini bar and toiletries etc were very good. Yes expensive but these hotels always are. 

Overall am i gald i tried it - yes. Would i recommend it - yes. Do i feel like i was over charged - No but then again we did get a ""January Special Rate"" so if i had paid their higher rates i perhaps would feel cheated. 

If there was one piece of advice i would offer to the hotel it would be this. 95% of everyting you do is great. The staff need to figure out the other 5% and then you will be close to perfection.",4,2008,01,03
130,the best as always,"For many years we have regularly stayed at The Dorchester and in our opinion every visit has been faultless. The staff from the front desk make your arrival very special and once checked in escort your to show you to your room, on our last visit we were upgraded to a magnificent suite which was huge.

The hotel is always spotless and all the staff are extremley polite and courteous and nothing is a problem The new bar is a really buzzing place and The Promanade is an excellent place for lunch or dinner.

Well done to all the staff at The Dorchester you have made it one of the finest hotels in the world",5,2007,12,31
130,minor moans,"we booked the hotel direct by telephone and agreed a rate for 3 nights in a junior suite for a birthday weekend. on arrival we were upgraded to a fantastic park suite and given a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake, what a brilliant start!!!
its difficult to moan when you have been given a free upgrade but here we go ;-

no mineral water in rooms unless you get it from the minibar and the tapwater is not healthy.
no cotton buds in bathroom
breakfasts meagre and although included in price the 12.5% gratuity isnt!!!
£6.50 plus 12.5% for a bottle of beer in the bar

the hotel service is generally good and friendly, very good housekeeping staff and informative reception / concierge etc.

id rate this hotel better than the mandarin oriental and i will probably return due to the good location , general aura and atmosphere the dorchester has.",4,2007,12,19
130,Prepare to be a little disapointed!,"My daughter and I have just returned from a weekend at The Dorchester and I cannot pretend it was anything but a bit of a disappointment. The hotel lobby is lovely and the staff were extremely nice and very helpful. Our room itself was what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, good bed, quality linens and furniture etc.  But that was really where it ended. 
They brought the wrong luggage to our room which is unforgivable in such an exclusive hotel. But it was sorted. In such an expensive hotel complimentary mineral water really should always be available in the room, especially for those people who have arrived after a long flight but no, not even the ubiquitus chocolates at turndown.  
We returned late from the theatre on Saturday night and decided to have room service. We tried the number a couple of times before we could get a reply.The food came quite quickly and was OK nothing special, no marks for presentation but it tasted good as we were hungry. 
The following morning we looked forward to breakfast in the dining room (and at £28 each we expected something special). Sad to say it was very poor. We ordered the English Breakfast which consists of ONE small glass of juice, tea or coffee, cold toast no butter. We ordered poached eggs with bacon and sausage. sadly it was cold and very overcooked, although at the time you try to make the best of it,  in truth it was very poor. They never offered us any more coffee or juice or inquired if we had enjoyed our food even though the food was only half eaten. I looked at the stains on the table cloth and no matter how hard I tried to ignore the many faults I had to admit to myself I wouldn't stay here or recommend this hotel to anyone. Go for a smaller hotel like Dukes or the Draycott where attention to detail is just beautiful and they make you feel very special. We paid our bill which of course was incorrect with a £50.00 charge for parking, strange as we had arrived by train and taxi. Needless to say quite a few people were questioning their bills, not suprising as when we checked in a man next to us was asking the receptionist can it be true that 4 bottles of house wine on his bill came to £208.00?  ""I'm afraid so sir "" came the reply. Which leaves me only to say you don't always get what you pay for or what you deserve!",2,2007,11,26
130,Lovely!,"We stayed at the Dorchester for 3 nights with our 2 kids. The accomodations & staff were top notch. The traditional English Staff was professional, but also warm & helpful. The morning breakfast was great. We loved the Dorchester-really gave our kids a taste of English
charm.",4,2007,11,22
130,Treated like royalty!,"We spent 3 days at the Dorchester and loved it. The place oozes luxury and you definitely see where your money goes. The staff is extremely courteous. Our executive deluxe room was spacious and elegant. The bathroom was spectacular, with very high-end towels and amenties. The bed was super-comfy.

Room service was terriffic for breakfast, The piano bar is a nice spot for drinks. The place is a celebrity magnet, apparently. Tom Cruise and the King of Saudi Arabia were ther, but we were most excited about sharing an elevator with Dustin Hoffman and his wife and pretending not to recognize them.

Highly recommended.",5,2007,11,16
130,A favourite hotel for plush acoomodations and good service,"I have stayed three times over the past 2 years at The Dorchester. This is one of the best, value-for-money, hotel in London. The rooms are huge, especially the Deluxe and Executive rooms and most afford really nice views of Hyde Park. The in-room amenities are great even if their DVD-TV-Radio flat screen system is a tad capricious and often needs to be rebooted by the technical staff. Tea, breakfast and room service are just wonderful even if prices are steep. Would definitely return in a heartbeat.Try it and you will not bve disappointed.",4,2007,10,26
130,Sub Par Hotel,"The Dorchester is a nice hotel but that is about it. It is by no means a deluxe hotel. The hotel lacked any kind of movie PPV system, which seemed odd to me considering it is supposed to be a luxurious, full service hotel. The rooms are decorated in a terrible old English
style and need to be gutted and renovated. I really don't need a tassled headboard that surly hasn't been cleaned since it's installation. The halls smelled musty, probably because of the heavy old English style of decor..(The Four Seasons is only now renovating their hotel. When it is completed, it will be the best hotel in London.)

The service is abyssmal. The ""famous"" afternoon tea service was impossible to attend. I had just arrived in London and decided that I would like to have a nice afternoon tea. I approached the counter where two women eyed me suspiciously. When I told them I would like to sit down for tea, they informed that if I didn't have a reservation I couldn't have a table since they were full. I looked across the tea room to find not a SINGLE table was occupied. When I mentioned this to the two women, they again informed me that I needed
a reservation! When I complained to the Concierge they simply
shrugged and did nothing. I find it impossible that I stay in a hotel
(in a suite no less) and they can't get me a table at tea! You would think they would hold a table or two for their own guests.

I didn't like the place and the train station of a lobby does not make someone feel at home. It is only a good hotel for people who want to see and be seen, not for people looking for a 5 start experience.",4,2007,10,10
130,Skip The Dorch unless you are a movie/rock star.,"I arrived and was checked into The Dorchester with great service. Everything AFTER that was poor. When I put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out, I was surprised to see an employee knocking on the door. That would never happen elsewhere. Then the front desk called my room and hung up at night. I called back and they knew nothing of what I was saying. When I explained the phone said where the call was from and that I was not making this up, they were flippant. When my breakfast was delivered to my room on the second day of a four day stay he actually had the guts to call me out and complain that I didn't answer the door when he knocked. I then explained I had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out because I took and bath and needed a nap after the long flight and no sleep. All of which I had already explained to the front desk.
I had to leave very early in the morning so I left a comment card at the front desk, which I doubt made it to the General Manager. So I wrote a letter, not an email but an actual letter.
The other thing that bothered me was the staff kept referring to me as Mr. & Mrs. When I made my reservations I filled out as Ms. I had to remind them time and time again I am not a Mrs. or a Mr. for that fact. I am a single female traveler. I think the only way you will get stellar treatment is be a movie star and not just an ordinary girl. The only good thing was the location. I did get a call after they got my letter. They left a message for ""either Mr. or Mrs.....""
At this point I give up.",1,2007,10,06
130,A Weekend Of Luxury and Elegance,"We stayed at this hotel as a treat as we felt we needed a bit of pampering; we were not disappointed.

Check in was fairly smooth. Our room wasn't ready so we offered complimentary teas and coffees in the bar. It was very welcome after travelling all the way to London by train. 

After our room was ready we were shown around the lobby area and the restaurant, bar and shops were explained to us and we were shown to our room. It was an amazing room at that. The bathroom was huge with a deep bath and big shower. Our room itself was very well presented, clean, tidy and the complimentary champagne was a very welcome touch. After they have turned your bed down at night you also get a rose petal heart on your bed, very sweet I thought.

We had spa treatments while we were there. My boyfriend had an Indian Head Massage and I had the delux manicure and pedicure. The ladies that did them were very friendly and professional and the spa was very clean.

Then came the highlight of the stay, Afternoon tea. I recommend it to everyone and it should be a compulsary part of your stay. Try the Dorchester blend tea it is amazing. The clotted cream scones were to die for and if there is nothing you can eat on the menu they will make you sandwiches to your liking. There is as much champagne and tea as you can drink.

I will say that the bar in the evening is a little expensive, but if you are staying there what do you expect? You do not book into one of the Dorchester Collection hotels if you are on a budget!!

Breakfast was not disappointing either and they serve it till 12pm. Usually the more you pay for food the less you get, in this case, happily this isn't true. 

I would stay here again any time.

130,One of the great London hotels,"We usually stay in the Dorchester once per year on our regular London visits. It's well located for Oxford Street shopping and for Hyde Park. We had a special ""July Only"" deal for an amazing GBP 275 (only) for the room, although this ended up being GBP 705 having added dinner, breakfast, a third person in the room (14 year old) and the usual taxes.

The room was the utimate in opulence as is usual at the Dorchester. The view was nothing special, but in our price category, this is normal. The bathroom is vast and amazing as is to be expected here. 

We had dinner in the Asian restaurant which wasn't as good as in previous years. However, the breakfast was as usual something special. There is no buffet, everything is brought to your table, which is a refreshing change to the usual buffet queues. The  service at breakfast sets the standard for how service should be as far as I am concerned.

In summary, it's always a special treat to stay at the Dorchester whenever my wallet allows it.
",5,2007,08,17
130,Almost perfect,"This has London's best lobby, and among London's biggest rooms. The beds are extremely comfortable and the hotel is, generally, well managed. Having said that, however, a few flaws showed up on this stay: room had a bad smell (so the hotel switched my room), the property is leaving Leading Hotels at the end of the year, so benefits were not forthcoming (until I asked). Room Service was slow--though the food was fine when it finally arrived. Gym was OK, though the jacuzzi pool was broken. Just enough to make this less than a perfect stay. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer place to stay in London. Good weekend rates make it exceptional value, for London at least.
",5,2007,08,13
130,A very enjoyable stay!,"We stayed at The Dorchester just over last weekend and overall had a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  We booked a room via the The Dorchester's own website at a fairly competitive rate considering we would be staying at one of the best hotels in London.

Firstly, the room was light , beautifully furnished but a little on the small side and with an amazing bathroom (nearly the same size as the room!).     It had a 'Mayfair' view however looked out, rather boringly, onto the buildings opposite.

Us Brits like our tea and coffee making facilities in hotel rooms and we were surprised that there were none here, as room service always usually takes up to 30 mins.  We telephoned and asked for the above to be delivered in order that we could make our own and this was not a problem - we were advised this would be complimentary.  However on collecting our bill a £25.00 charge had been added.  We queried this and the amount was then removed.  We really would expect a 5 star British hotel to provide these facilities, even if guests did not want to use them and call room service instead. 
 
Dinner at the Grill Room was excellent from a food and service perspective, one thing about this hotel is that the staff are all exceptionally polite and unstuffy.  One glitch that spoilt out dining experience a little was that our table for two was rather close to the next, unfortunately with a rather loud lady next door who was obviously not staying at the hotel and totally in awe of that fact that she was dining at The Dorchester!   We did inform restaurant staff of this the next day who were apologetic.

After dinner we sat at The Promenade and listened to the pianist and double-bass playing down near the bar area. It would be good if the hotel had a residents lounge area or designated part of The Promenade as a 'resident only' as I did object a little having to wait to be seated at The Promenade.

Just before we went down to breakfast  the next morning I happened to lose an earing in the room and had to move the bed.  I think housekeeping need to check and hoover underneath their beds more often as it was dusty and there were old luggage labels, hairgrips there which showed it had not been cleaned for sometime.  Going back to breakfast! It was definitely one of the best English breakfasts we have ever had in any hotel.       

Obviously the hotel is very central and only a 15 minute walk to Harrods.  We decided, last minute, to go in and see Buckingham Palace, which was well worth the visit and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London this summer. Concierge can issue a voucher for this tour however you still have to queue to redeem the voucher for the tickets at the Palace.
",4,2007,08,13
130,The best place,"Plush and super fancy.  The rooms are sumptious.  You'll never want to leave.  Service goes above and beyond.  Tea here is awesome.  Very English.  Overall, it's very expensive, but money well spent.
",5,2007,07,18
130,A True Pleasure,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Dorchester on two separate occasions for business on Thanksgiving 2006 and in January 2007.  Simply splendid accomodations.  Gorgeous lobby.  Elegant rooms - I enjoyed a suite on one stay and a four poster bed room on another.  Super comfortable beds.  Fabulous lighting.  Lovely views.  Superb service - from reception to housekeeping to room service to concierge.  The spa is also a delight.  If you want to enjoy the epitome of lavish comfort, do yourself a favor and stay at The Dorechester.
",5,2007,07,08
130,Wow,"Impossible to fault.  My wife and stayed here for one night in a suite and I must say everything was perfect.

Room size was excellent given the average London hotel.  Food was amazing and service was perfect.  The decor throughout the hotel was very tasteful and elegant.
",5,2007,06,17
130,Special!,"My friend and I booked the Dorchester because it was opposite Hyde Park and we had entered the ""Playtex Moonwalk"" for Breast Cancer Research.  When we arrived our room was not ready so we had a pot of tea in the Promenade. However our room still was not ready but it wasn't a problem as everyone was very polite. We went off to have a spot of lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe, which was great. 

The room was ready when we arrived back, and it was a great room with lovely decoration, poor view but this did not bother us.  I ordered a pot of tea through room service as they do not provide tea and coffee making facilities in the room. However, this experience was not a great one as we had to wait for over an hour, I rang after 45 minutes and then waited another 20.  Everyone apologised so I thought well not to worry.  We went off to do our ""Moonwalk"" and arrived back approximately 5.00am on arriving in our room we ordered another pot of tea, again we had a long wait, if this had been the first time as it was 5:00am I would have thought fair enough, but ....

Breakfast was the best and afternoon tea superb.  Our overall experience was excellent as the service in every other area was special.

I did give them feedback about the wait for room service and they were very apologetic.  It wouldn't have really been anything to complain about but we English enjoy our tea.

The Doorman was the most friendly I have ever come across and made us feel really special.

Thank you Dorchester

130,"Great, but lots of working being done...","Stayed here in the summer of 2005 and they were extensively renovating, resulting in closed restaurants and lots of noise.  Looking at recent reviews it appears that the work still hasn't stopped to be careful.  Other than the renovating the hotel was great.  Very large rooms, great bathrooms (along with those famous bathtubs) and overall very wonderful staff.  The location is very pretty but not exactly near all the tourist areas.

Overall a very good experience at the Dorchester.  It seems to be showing its age lately but I guess that’s why they've been working on it for so long.  If you prefer the more traditional hotel, this is the hotel for you.  If you're looking for a more modern touch (what i typically prefer, you might want to look elsewhere).

",4,2007,05,13
130,A class act of perfection,"We stayed at the Dorchester for four nights over Easter having not stayed there for several years. The experience was wonderful with smooth and sniling service in plush surroundings.

Our room was a deluxe room which overlooked Mayfair which is not the best view - the Hyde Park rooms would have a more picturesque view. However the room was large with lovely traditional, quality furnishings and a great bathroom - natural light, one of the biggest baths in London and a shower that could accomodate four should you so wish! Toiletries were all Floris with luxury robes and a surfeit of towels.

The in room entertainment facility was good with internet and films reasonably priced. There were two soft chairs and a chaise longue and working desk.

The public areas of the hotel can only be described as stunning, especially the Promenade where breakfast, teas etc are served. The Grill Room is done in grand Scottish decor and is really impressive.

Throughout our stay theservice from all staff was exemplary and there was always staff on hand.

The hotel is in a great situation with Hyde Park across the road, Mayfair on your doorstep and Knightsbidge ten minutes walk away. There is always plenty of taxis if one of the Ferraris, Lamborghinis or Rolls parked outside does not belong to you.

Our Easter rate was a good deal for the class of hotel and included a bottle of Champagne and breakfast each day ( which if we were paying would seriously mount up).

Great experience.
",5,2007,04,18
130,"Still good, but be careful!","Well I have been lucky enough to go back to the Dorchester and it had a few issues!

Firstly they are working on the 9th floor and as such, there is noise from 9 to 5 Mon to Fri and 11 to 5 sat & Sun (which did surprise me!)  The hotel did not advise me of this when I called earlier int he week to book the room, I also had to call them the day of arrival to say that there was a cheaper rate on their website, and they did agree to use that rate (a saving of £200 per night!).

When we arrived no mention of building work at reception, nothing form the receptionist as she showed us the room, it was only when a maintenance guy arrived to fit a door stop and I asked him what the noise was, he mentioned the work and there should be a letter on the desk form the General Manager!  I would have preferred to know in advance!

One thing I was very surprised at for such a high class 5* hotel, is it depends on the rate you are on if you get complimentary water left by your bed! I didn't and when I for some, I was told I would have to pay for it!

Also slightly surprised you are not allowed to drink alcohol near the lobby while they are serving afternoon tea (with Champagne) at the nearby tables even though at lunchtime I was more than happily served a pre lunch G&T at the very same table!  When I mentioned this to the lady who refused to serve me, I was told I was mistaken!!  Not all the staff as as pleasant this time round, they must have been having a bad day!

The final night we didn't sleep much at all due to what I assumed was noisy neighbors int he upstairs room whop were insomniacs!  But it turns out the hotel was having the room above us re-decorated and they work through the night and due to the fact that they remove the carpet, we could hear everything!  When I checked out as we were leaving, they lady at the cash desk advised we should not have been in that room at all and if we had told them we would have been moved (Shame as it was our last night, otherwise yes we would have asked to be moved!)

I will certainly remember that next time, I will ask if any work is being carried out in the hotel, I want a room no where near it!

Other than those minor niggles the weekend was perfect and the weather was wonderful!!

130,A Really Swell Stay,"Young, elegant and thoroughly professional staff.  Attended to every and all needs.  Exquisite rooms, luxurious bath - a great bar  - and the lobby area for tea or breakfast is just the tops.  Could not have been more well looked after.  Especially after an endless overseas flight.  P.S. Bring bags of money!

130,Just perfect !,"Just spent a wonderful week-end at the Dorchester with my daughter. Everything was so perfect, the room was gorgeous (de luxe twin), massage ( try it, it's worth it !) at the spa, dinner at the Grill ( the menu seems at first a bit ""special"" for a continental, but it's very original and very good), the baths (ever so deep, a divine experience!) and most of all the service : everybody is there to please you and make you happy, from the minute you are in front of the hotel till the minute you leave, all the staff is ever so kind and helpful. Thank you very much, the Dorchester.

130,Lovely hotel,"Just returned from a long weekend and decided to try the Dorchester for a change from either the Met or from private clubs. I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews but I had a great rate from the hotel website so I thought I'd give it a try. On arrival in the morning from the overnight flight from the States, my ""assigned"" room wasn't ready, so I was upgraded to a larger room. The room was beautiful and very well appointed, and the bathroom was even more so. The deepest tub I've ever seen and a great separate shower. If I had one complaint, it woudl be that the satellite tv was very slow and often ""frozen"", but that is nothing. The concierge, front desk and room service staff were all wonderful. I had an Eve Lom facial in the spa, which was one of the best I've ever had. The spa did appear to need a little freshening, but not so much so that it detracted from the exerience.  

All in all, a great experience. I think this hotel suffers from what other higer-end luxury hotels suffer from: unrealistic expectations. An over-critical nit-picker might have negative things to say about the Dorchester, but I found my experience to be one of the nicest I've ever had in London.
",5,2007,01,25
130,Loved the Dorch,"First class all the way.  One of the top deluxe London hotels.  Overlooking Hyde Park, a few blocks walk to Shepards Market, Tube, but somewhat tucked away from the mainstream tourism.  Taxi line at hotel waiting as you exit most times, or arriving within a few minutes.  Concierge desk the most helpful in London.  The restaurants, bar, and afternoon tea all fabulous;  room service extraordinary.  Pinch yourself!  
Only drawbacks are family accommodation; must book a suite or 2 rooms if traveling with 2 children. $$$$
Park Lane active, but surrounding streets deserted at night.  Safe, but if you can't find a cab you will find yourself walking alone through several blocks late at night when returning from pubs.
",5,2007,01,23
130,Like a great traditional English pudding...,"We moved here following several disappointing stays at the Mandarin Oriental across the park.  The Dorchester has a homely, personal feeling which you will not find in a corporate chain like the Mandarin or the Four Seasons.  The service is friendly and faultless from the moment you arrive.

Room service provides a good range of well presented dishes and once again service is quick, friendly and efficient.

The common areas of the hotel are well maintained and extremely traditional, with the highlight being afternoon tea in the Conservatory (make sure you book ahead!).  The bar was very smoky due to poor ventilation but that will cease when the long overdue smoking ban comes in this year.

There is a great choice of dining options from the tradition of the Grill to the cutting edge oriental cuisine of China Tang.

The Rooms?  Not overly large for the price but generous enough and you can always upgrade to a sumptuous suite if space is important and (considerable) budget permits.  You will feel like you have fallen into a period drama - no stainless steel or black marble in sight!  If you want cutting edge, The Metropolitan is 100 yards away but if you want indulgent, comforting luxury with amazing service The Dorchester will feel like home from the minute you arrive.
",4,2007,01,03
130,Not the Best London Option,"Arriving at the well-known Dorchester following a hard week-long slog through Europe on a marketing trip, I was looking forward to a brief (one night) but relaxing stay at this top-bracket property before heading off to Japan. 

6 pm check-in was a bit chaotic, but the lobby and first floor is beautiful, and I was finally conducted to what turned out to be a pleasant room, slightly marred by stains on the carpeting and a collection of hairs in the bathtub. It took 2 calls and almost 30 minutes to the porter to have my bags delivered, despite being assured upon check-in that they would be ""brought up immediately"". 

As I was looking forward to a bath, I put in a call to housekeeping to have the bathtub cleaned, but after 20 minutes no one had shown up. After another call and a further 10 minute wait, a perspiring maid finally arrived muttering under her breath whenever the beeper on her belt went off, and cleaned up without enthusiasm.  The bathroom fixtures themselves could have used a  good polishing, but they worked. 

Comfortable bed, and very good good room service breakfast. However, the bill for overnight laundry of 5 shirts and underwear tipped the scales at 300 pounds, which seemed a tad high, to say the least.

On Saturday, looking to eat lunch at the hotel before heading to Heathrow, I presented myself at the main court only to be told (as expected) that the then empty room was fully-booked for high tea and I would have to look elsewhere. My request for help with where to get a light lunch initially resulted in baffled stares, but ultimately the hotel bar was the recommended alternative. The Dorchester's bar has been written up as ""one of the best hotel bars"" in London, and if you are looking for a gin and tonic priced at 18 pounds (not including the bottle of tonic, which is extra), thudding eurotrash music, and a strange menu of expensive snacks in a bordello decor, this place is for you.  A sloppy wrap of curry chicken salad and one drink set me back over 50 pounds, which is an outrageous price considering what it was. 

One could do better at the Savoy or Claridges for the same 
price.

130,Not the best hotel in London.,"The Front of the building is wonderful, renovations were very good, service was spot on as you would expect. HOWEVER!!  we had to move 3 times to get a non smoking room, the smell of old cigarettes was everywhere.  After our final move, we woke up on Sunday morning to the smell of cigarette smoke, which was coming under the adjoining bedroom door.  Took an hour to check out as they did not take down the correct security number from the credit card.
",3,2006,10,10
130,Some flaws,"Central location, splendid building (after the recent renovations, although I prefered the old Grill and the bar is too modern for my taste) and very luxurious rooms.

Dinner at the grill was good but not memorable, and the quality of the service has dropped. Service at the bar was not great, but the waiting staff was especially bad at breakfast in the Promenade. Breakfast itself is also of a lesser quality than in the past (especially the bread) and is now a neglected meal (like at so many hotels).

The spa (ok but not a destination in itself) did not look clean (used towels and empty water bottles everywhere). I reported this several times to the reception but it had no effect.

The hardware (public areas and rooms) is certainly back where it should be, but there is a problem with the software (poorly trained young waiting staff having replaced the older and distinguished staff).
",3,2006,09,11
130,Great!,"My partner and I had a two night stay at The Dorchester at the end of August.  We were impressed with the checking in service which included the receptionist showing us around the facilities and to our room. Our room was on the second floor. The room was exceptionally spacious and the bed was huge. The bathroom was a decent size with a deep bathtub. (If you had a mobility problem you may not be able to lift your leg high enough to get in) A little disappointingly, our room overlooked the aircon units/kitchen? however, my view is that I do not go to London to spend my time looking out of the window. The new bar was very beautifully done although the prices are definitely London/5* prices! The Promenade is gorgeous and a delight to have either breakfast/ afternoon tea or a late afternoon drink.
Our stay inThe Dorchester was very good. We stayed in both The Lanesborough and The Ritz last year and The Dorchester is faring execptionally well in 'our places to stay test'!
",5,2006,09,01
130,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"A large group of us went for afternoon tea on a Sunday at the Dorchester.  On arrival at the hotel I was very impressed with the surroundings and decor.  We were warmly welcomed and shown to our tables, which looked beautiful- the china was the finest and daintiest I have seen!  The choice of teas were quite bewildering but I finally decided on the Dorchester Blend and was not disappointed.  We were firstly served sandwiches, as much as we could eat. I tried most varieties and they were all fantastic! Next came a peach and Vanilla desert- which was followed by warm scones- delicious! We had a selection of pastries which were quickly refilled as I had to try most of them- they were all very tasty! We offered more of everything, although after my second cake I was rather full.  The ambience is lovely, a piano playing throughout and even the ladies restrooms were impressive! 10/10 I enjoyed myself immensely as well as the rest of my party- I would love to go again!!!
",4,2006,08,29
130,Afternoon Tea overpriced.,"June, my wife and I went to the Dorchester for Afternoon Tea.
Sandwiches were good,   desserts were just average and the whole affair was overpriced.  Service was slow,  our server disappeared and we ended up with someone else.
Beautiful setting,,, but as I was about the only man with a necktie, I wondered why I carried it 4000 miles for this...
Will go elsewhere next time:

130,Wonderful tea at the Dorchester,"I wanted to take my parents to London for the day as a treat. They are comfortably off and are used to some of the nicer things in life, but I'm not - so the budget was important to me. However, I wanted to take them to see Buckingham Palace and then for a smart tea afterwards. I used Tripadvisor and read all the reviews of lots of nice London Hotels which do tea and eventually settled on the Dorchester, mainly because of the reviews which said the staff at the Ritz were condescending to guests. I wanted to my parents to feel special, not unworthy!

The best bit was flagging down a taxi and announcing 'the Dorchester' to the driver - my parents were so surprised; they had never been before. We were dropped off outside and the doorman helped us in. The staff inside were courteous and discreet - not snobbish, disinterested or over-the-top. We sat down (the tea area is right inside in the lobby area) and it is beautifully decorated with huge comfortable banquettes or big old-fashioned chairs. A cake stand, silver plate cutlery and tea-strainers, linen cloths and napkins and Limoges crockery were on the table when we arrived. Immediately a waitress came to see if we were ok and said she'd give us a while (which she did twice as we weren't ready.) The only thing which threw me was that another waitress immediately offered champagne, which my parents accepted happily, thinking it was part of the deal - but I hadn't chosen the champagne tea as it was another six pounds each and I'd bought some for later. Anyway, the tea was fantastic. They bought little sandwiches with the crusts cut off - five kinds - and then brought more and more. Unfortunately I ate too many as the pear and stilton one which had sounded so revolting was so nice and I had several. So, by the time the warm scones (plain or with raisins) arrived wrapped in a napkin, I was feeling a little full. The cakes arrived then too, and were a real treat. Some had gold leaf on and all were beautifully presented and tasted lovely. They offered more, and to my eternal and horrified regret I had to decline. A waiter in tails kept topping up the tea, which we thought was great but we realised at the fourth top up that he was just adding boiling water and it was getting weaker and weaker. I had Bangkok tea and it was fabulous! 

The service was very good and we were surprised to find we'd been there two hours. As we left, I thought we'd go and have a look at the other end of the room just to see what was up there (let's face it, I don't go there every day) and the cocktail bar caught my Dad's eye... he knows I love a cocktail and offered me one. So there we all were having cocktails beautifully prepared by the barman in the Dorchester. It was fantastic and felt so special. As we were leaving, a lady behind the bar offered us a top-up. My mum's always one for a joke and asked if it was free. Yes, she said...so we had another, and it was free, and it was excellent!

By the time we left we felt we'd had such a lovely day and the surroundings, decor, ambience (everyone else looked crashingly wealthy and as though having tea at the Dorchester was sooo tedious dahlink) were perfect. I'm really glad I chose this hotel and (if only there weren't so many other places in the world to see!) would be back in a flash. Just fantastic
",5,2006,08,07
130,Perfect as always,".As a regular at The Dorchester i must comment on the superb service that they provide time after time.On our latest visit, to celebrate a friends birthday,we were informed on arrival that we had been upgraded,we were shown to our room which turned out to be a beautiful park suite.To make sure we made the most of it we invited our friends to join us for lunch in the suite.The six of us had a wonderful lunch over looking Hyde Park before going to an afternoon matinee at the theatre.The staff are always extremely polite and attentive,we have stayed at three or four of the other top hotels in London but for the past few years The Dorchester has been our firm favourite and we highly recommend it.
",5,2006,06,28
130,"The Grand Dame of Grand Brittania is outrageously overpriced,","A 4 night stay with the wife (left the kids in Chicago with Grandma!) on vacation- exec king set us back $3500 (room, tax, service only).  Full breakfast included, thanks to American Express FH&R program.  Reasonably spacious room toward the back (read: quiet) of the hotel- two closets in the entry foyer- spacious bathroom with his/her sinks, separate bath and shower.  There was also a bidet that provided us with at least several minutes of amusement.

The Dorch is on the east end of hyde park, across Park Lane.  It is a brisk 5 minute walk to HP since you can't directly cross Park Lane (unless you have a death wish) unless you walk south to the pedestrian underpass.  Green Park and Hyde Park tube stops are closest, both about 5 min walk from hotel.

Otherwise, there is not much immediately around the dorch- 5 min walk to Shepard's market (a small, socioeconomically normal enclave in the middle of an otherwise outrageously posh Mayfair neighborhood) or Oxford St and a hideously barricaded US Embassy (don't get me started).  Kensington (Harrods, etc) is a good 12-15 min walk- but at least you can cut through Hyde Park and the lovely flower gardens along the southeast edge.

Had tea at the Dorch- $135/two people.  It is unbelievable to me that the English, who readily voice their disdain for loud, tactless Americans, allow constantly ringing cellphones during tea!  Shockingly inappropriate, if you ask this ugly american.

Meals in general at the D are ridiculously expensive, especially given the overall mediocre quality.  We did not eat in The Grill or China Tang- unbelievably pricey.  Given the multitude of superb restaurants in London, we pretty much limited ourselves to breakfast.

The clientele are an interesting mixture of arabs, tourists, and englishmen wearing tophats (Royal Ascot horse races were happening).  We were low-key Americans doing the usual tourist thing in jeans and casual clothing- we definitely stuck out but I didn't feel particularly ostracized.  No one ever hassled us, except when we tried to unsuccesfully cut through the back door of the hotel as a ""shortcut.""  My bad.

Service is fine- not outstanding though.  Calls to the concierge desk in the middle of the day went unanswered a few times.  Maid service was excellent- discrete, fast, and thorough.  Check in and check out went fine- they got the bill right on the first try pretty much.  Overall, service is comparable to Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, but not as good as Peninsula.

Summary: Although the location is considered great, I would suggest that the Dorch is actually a little bit off the beaten path, particularly if you like being able to easily walk (within 5-7 minutes) to restaurants, lounges, shopping, etc.  It is outrageously expensive but I am hard-pressed to say it was really worth spending so much for what we hoped would be the quintessential English experience, especially with the constantly ringing cellphones during breakfast and tea.  I would stay elsewhere if we went back.  

P.S. Selfridges is far superior to Harrods- less tourists and WAAAAAYYY less emphasis on their own brand.  For example, if you want to buy tea at Harrods, you can really only buy Harrods brand.  If you go to Selfridges though, you'll have a ton of choices, only one of which is the Selfridges brand.  Selfridges' foodhall is just as impressive as Harrods.  Similarly, Selfridges also has an amazing array of clothing, electronics, books, etc.  Skip Harrods- Selfridges is a much more entertaining and productive shopping experience with way fewer people to push through.

130,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed at the Dorchester last week and it really is beautifully appointed. The room however, was not what I expected for a top hotel, as it was quite small. The linens were beautiful, the bed comfortable, but the size of the room and the lack of any view was disappointing. All I had to look at really was the ugly top of the roof. The tub, was very deep and the bathroom was fairly large and everything seemed fresh and clean. They are not very generous with toilet paper and fruit plates and at these prices, you should be able to expect more. I never ate at the hotel as the prices were astronomical after the conversion to USD. The lounge area seemed a bit stuffy but the staff for the most part, especially the front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. I might consider staying there again, but be careful where they put you - you'll either be delighted or disappointed. And of course, there was a celebrity sighting- Lionel Ritchie in the lobby.

130,The Genuine Article,"The Dorchester is a seriously good, genuine 5-red-star London hotel. It has lovely, immaculately applied rooms, faultless service, and superb ambience. The whole place has a warm and friendly almosphere. Afternoon tea in the Promenade was a delight, with food as good as you will find anywhere, including the Ritz. The room service breakfast was as excellent, as is the location, with Hyde park across the road, Oxford Street ten minutes walk away, and theatreland just a short cab ride. Anyone looking for a superb, traditional, top-rate London hotel need look no further than the Dorchester.

130,Absolutely Fabulous,"Just got back from staying at this wonderful hotel. From check in to check out our stay was nothing short of perfect. The room was a generous size, absolutely immaculate. The staff were a real pleasure. This hotel definitely deserves its 5 star rating. I have stayed at numerous 5 star hotels around the world and without a doubt I would rank this amongst the best. I have finally found my hotel of choice in London.

130,Shame about the decor,"I have been going to The Grill Room for some time.I enjoyed the tranquil surroundings and the 3 course meal for £38 including service.Very good value for money.when i went in October i was disturbed to find that it was closed for refurbishment.I went back recently.What have they done to the place!The walls are now covered by garish Rob Roy figures,supposedly to highlight the new Scottish influenced menu.Alas this means that the old fixed price menu has gone out and in comes a menu  which is almost twice as expensive.There is no longer a desert trolley but you are handed a menu with about 6 desserts from  £8.Petite fours and coffee are no longer included and they of course add 12 1/2% service charge on the bill.The food itself is less interesting and i have to say vastly overpriced.So i will not be going back there.So if you think that you are going to get anything special at The Grill Room ,well it will only be the bill.Alas this is no longer a venue i shall visit.

130,Trouble with payments and truly awful service.,"We had tea on sunday afternoon at the dorchester. It was embarassingly bad, really, truly, appalling. Basil Faulty could not have done better!

I was especially upset as it had been my idea. I have stayed many times at the dorchester's sister hotels for business, mainly The Principe, in Milan. I have always found it a delight. A respite from mindless business travel with a wonderful friendly staff. It has gorgeous big old fashioned rooms and a truly awesome spa and pool on the top floor. However, even with the fabulous surrondings, it is, to my mind, the staff that make the difference between a good and a great hotel.

The Dorchester obviously does not believe this.

The staff are arrogant, unpleasant and unhelpful. A previous reviewer put it very well when he said, that the staff regard the guests as a bother. I would concur with this completely.

At tea, we were treated as a bunch of annoying idiots. Who were bothering the staff. Imagine, we were so spoilt, we wanted our tea to be served! At nearly £40+ per person for tea, you would have hoped they might make a small effort... Don't count on it. You are upsetting their afternoon by being there. That's how they make you feel.

After a few glasses of champagne, we asked for our tea to be served. We would have liked our sandwiches to be brought to the table at roughly the same time as the tea, not when the tea was cold. That didn't happen. When we asked for hot tea we were told it was on its way. By the third time of trying to get some more tea we had to get up and ask the gentleman/manager at the service stand to bring it.

We ordered water, again it never appeared. I had to get up, physically stand infront of a waiter and ask for it. Guess what? Yup, it never appeared. The trick is to ask for everything three times, and then it arrives. But actually the really clever bit is finding someone to ask three times! Elusive is obviously a word they learn quickly!

When we asked for scones they arrived. We had only asked once! Hurray, it was a blip in the service. It was all going to be fine. Well....no. The scones arrived warm and wrapped in a lovely white linen napkin. Sadly by the time the butter, cream and jam arrived, the scones were cold. 

The finaly insult was when we tried to pay. The bill arrived very very promptly. I duly handed over my switch card to pay. The man came back and informed everyone at the table, that my card was not acceptable - they don't take solo cards. I pointed out it was a switch card. He went away. He then came back in a loud voice informed us all that it had not been authorised. (I got home and checked my balance online, I had not been wippped out overnight!) So very unlikely, but I'm too old and have stayed in too many hotels, to be bothered by this stuff. Technology cannot always be relied on.

So I handed over my Visa card. He swiped it, returned the slip for signing. Then he returned, again, he said  my card had not been authorised. Deja Vu! Even though the slip I had in my hand had an authorisation code on it, he said it was not authorised.

I just wanted to leave at this point. He became a bit belligerent and annoying and just keep repeating loudly that my card had not been authorised. I asked for my signed slip back, and gave him cash. They would not give me a cash receipt, I even asked him to sign a piece of paper saying he had said received £50 in cash. He would not. 

Guess what? Yup. I had paid twice, I paid cash, and my visa card has indeed been charged. At the time of writing, I cannot be 100% sure they have not charged my switch card as well, as my bank inform me it can take up to 3/4 days for debits to go through.

I have spend a whole morning sorting out a payment for a small amount of money. I have eventually contacted the hotel, G.M., (general manager) and he assures me they are sorting it out. He has, in their defence, been charming, and as good as his word. He has phoned me back, and assures me not only that my card has been credited, but they are crediting me with the cash I paid. So I may, have ended up not paying at all. 

However, I still feel, it should not have happened in the first place. And when I called yesterday to sort it out, the Food and Beverage Manager should have taken care of it. They didn't. Hence I bounced it up the GM. (Go to the top if there's a problem!)

My advice. Go somewhere else. Claridge's is fabulous for tea. The staff are friendly, courteous and charming. Sadly The Dorchester, even with a charming GM, does not deserve our hard earned cash.

130,Incredible,"I am always amazed that people can find something to criticise about the Dorchester. I've been lucky enough to stay there three times and every visit has been exquisite: beautiful rooms, furnished in a classic, English country house style. Incredible, incredible bathrooms. Amazing food. Wonderful service. 

If you like sleek, modern rooms, you probably won't like the Dorchester. It's chintzy and frilly, the furnishings are oversized and the upholstery florid. But that's because of its style and the hotel's USP - every visit makes you feel like stepping back in time to around 1910. A spotless 1910, I hasten to add.

I've always had a room overlooking Hyde Park, which is perfect. But not all rooms have that luxury. That's because you're in a central London hotel, surrounded by shops and offices. I guess some rooms might have a less than perfect view. So request a park view if that bothers you.

The rooms aren't massive - unless you have a suite, in which case they're huge -but they certainly aren't mean. And the bathrooms make up for that anyhow. 

The staff are absolute professionals who take the time to make sure you have a wonderful stay. Which is what you would expect for such a pricey hotel. But if you're in town for a special occasion, there is no finer place to stay.

130,Just the best....!,"We stayed here for 4 nights during October/November and have to say that we were not disappointed. The hotel is in a great location. We love to walk and found that all the great tourist places were all around. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a DEluxe King Room which was just great. Heaps of room, roomy bathroom with HUGE bath and VERY comfy bed.
The staff are just gorgeous, nothing was to much trouble. We had a bit of an issue with the printer, but they fixed it...even though it meant replacing their computer....!!! I would recommend this hotel to everyone, although it isn't cheap ($900 AUD p/night) it really was worth every cent.

130,Fabulous - worth every penny!,"My fiance took me to The Dorchester to celebrate our engagement. It is fantastic. The service, food, atmosphere.... I couldn't fault a thing. If you have the opportunity, don't think twice and don't miss the afternoon tea!

I dont know where you all stayed but The Dorchester was perfect for me, lovely, helpful staff, amazing food and HUGE bed and bathrooms...even better was bumping into George Clooney in THE LIFT!!!

The Dorchester is wonderful and if you can afford it go right now!!

130,"This is not a good hotel, it is a Bad hotel.  Seriously bad.","The Dorchester is a classic example of what a hotel should not be.  The level of service here is very poor.  First, upon checking in, I was lectured about why my room wasn't ready (it is not yet check-in time) though I have not only requested an early check-in, but also called from the Heathrow pick-up arranged by the hotel to let them know that I was on the way (during the conversation they confirmed that my room was ready and waiting for me).

Security is horrible.  A drunken hotel guest was wandering my floor for over an hour, ringing the VERY loud doorbells (further enhancing my jet lag).  When I called the frint desk to let then know that I had been awoken four times (and asked if they had security or a camera) I was not given a simple apology.

Okay, on to the room.  At around $900 US dollars per night, the room is 0 out of 10 on value.  The bed is not comfortable, the sheets and pillowcases are starched to the point that they can almost stand on their own.  The bathroom is very nice and the honor bar well-stocked.  The TV is horrible with two volumes, it seemed:  no sound or really loud.

Back to the service.  Though my inquiries were very few and I am not at all rude (I travel all the time and genuinely like people who work at hotels) the attitude at The Dorchester is that guests are an unwanted bother.

Location is good, but not great.  There are MANY better-situated hotels to the city center.  

The fitness room is fair at best.  Very small, poor TVs, aging equipment.

Finally, the hotel has a smell.  It smells...old...like your grandmother's house when she's either too infirm to tend to it or getting too old to care.

This is NOT a good hotel.  Take the huge sack of money required to stay here and go elsewhere.

130,great bath tub but the room is the luck of the draw,"We stayed at The Dorchester  for two nights, courtesy of the BAFTA awards.  The front desk staff wasn't very accommodating.  When we were shown to our room I have to say I was a bit shocked.  The hallways were very dismal and claustrophobic.  our room was unremarkable. The view out the one small window was of a roof sandwiched in between an alcove of the exterior of the hotel.  In other words we had no view and no light coming in the room.  The carpet was dirty and basically the furnishings felt very worn.  I asked the front desk if they could switch us to another room and they said no.  We offered to pay the difference for an upgrade and again they said no.  so we settled in and I basically spent my time in the room asleep or in the wonderful big marble bath tub.  we visited two other rooms while we were in the hotel.  One was far worse than ours. The other was absolutely gorgeous.  I suppose it's typical of older hotels for the rooms to vary so much. But all I could think about was the crummy room we were stuck in and the gorgeous one we could have had. 
I do have to say that the location was great and the concierge was one of the nicest I have ever come across.  I would, however, stay at The Claridges down the street and around a few corners.  That was a great hotel.

130,Its the best in London.,"The afternoon tea is better than the Ritz, even though you have to squat on low chairs. All round its better. 

The Spa is first rate.  Good barbers and excellent hairdressers.

The security is ham-fisted. They are pretty obvious if your aware and if they can't make you out, they 'talk' to you out of the blue. Kinda strange at first, but after they recognise you (if you visit more than once) your OKed.

Taking about the Doorman, he actually made a quip about where I was going when he pulled the cab over, as if to say ""Now we know where you go"".

What do expect with the bombings and superstar guests, the security have got to be on their toes.
",5,2005,09,19
130,Afternoon Tea - an addendum,"My wife and I had afternoon tea at the Dochester and would echo all the plus points of the previous review. However, we disagree over the 'pastries'. They were exquisitely made (apparently in-house) and were just as much a delight to the tastebuds as they were to the eyes. 

A truly marvellous experience.
",5,2005,08,17
130,poor choice,"Stayed here at the time of the second London bombing.  A disappointment.  Hotel was undergoing extensive refurbishment, with workers everywhere.  At check-in, the hotel attempted to put us in a smoking room and initially made a fuss when we objected.  Then they attempted to charge us a higher rate than our guaranteed reservation.  Fortunately, having a print out of the reservation solved that - except that they then tried to re-institute the higher charge at check out!  Dated decor and a dated clientele.  Not a patch on other luxury hotels - Four Seasons just down the road has much nicer rooms and a more friendly staff.  Not recommended, and we won't go back.
",2,2005,08,08
130,Almost excellent,"I stayed at the Dorchester late May 2005. I booked a standard room through the LHW-website. When I checked in I was upgraded to a larger deluxe room, which was a very nice room overlooking Hyde Park. I loved the room: large and good bed, sitting group and a large bathroom. The room was spacious. And the in-room entertainment system was genious. The service the employes provide is one of the best in Europe. The atmosphere of the hotel is casual and good. I ordered some food from the roomservice, and the portions was among the largest and most generous I have ever seen in the hotel business. I even catched a sight of both Goldie Hawn and Mickey Rourke in the hotel lobby.

However, when I was returning to the hotel one night I was approached by a man from security who in a rude way asked me if he could help me with something. This made me kinda angry, because I don't accept to be treated like this in establishments such as the Dorchester. I told the duty manager and the general manager about this, and they promised to handle this in a proper way. Which they did. Overall, I am very satisfied, and would really recommend the Dorchester to anyone who truly appreciate good service and luxury. But for all those who appreciate the little extra I recommend Claridge's. Which is my favourite hotel in London.

130,"Beautiful hotel, but surprisingly bad service","Sad to be the only one to have received a poor standard of service at this beautiful and luxurious hotel.

My problems occurred before and after leaving the hotel - the service during my stay was wonderful. The staff are attentive, the rooms are luxurious, the atmosphere is stuffy but not stifling.

Unfortunately, the online booking system encountered some errors when I booked my room. Despite receiving confirmation for one price, I was told I'd be charged another. This necessitated a phone call to the hotel, who advised they would honour their original confirmation. 

Had a great stay. Met with some friends from the US and Ireland. On check-out the bill was incorrect due to aforementioned 'problem with the computer system'. Found it annoying to be stood at the cashiers desk whilst waiting for them to sort it out. They did, I left on my merry way.

That evening, on my return home, I realised that I had left two items in my room when hurriedly departing. Jacket and ring. Phoned immediately and reported it. Retrieved jacket, NO ring. Called several times to check status of ring. Was advised that it had not been found and was unlikely to be found. Seemed a rather unsatisfactory response and wrote letter to the general manager. However, I do realise that this was partly an error on my part as I left it in the room.

Meanwhile, before receiving a reply about my ring, I received an invoice for £340.00, which was taken off my credit card (three weeks after I checked out). This was all in ERROR. I had paid my bill on departure. Due to (once again) a system malfunction, they had taken another nights accommodation off my credit card. Absolutely appalled that they had retained my credit card details and charged it without my knowledge. 

Since then there has been endless calls to the hotel and manager expressing dissatisfaction with their service, yet not one gesture of goodwill has been made except some rather lame apologies from about a million members of staff (NOT the manager). And still no ring. I know it's considered wonderful that The Dorchester has 3 members of staff per guest, however it means that maintaining a complaint with them is next to impossible.

I am supposed to be visiting there later this year for another reunion, but I'm loathe to do so, despite how wonderful a time I had there in May. Considering the cost of staying at The Dorchester compared with other 5* hotels in London, it is appalling how bad their service is.

130,My Favorite Hotel in the World,"How else to say it?  The Dorchester is my favorite hotel in the world.  It combines beauty, elegance, and outstanding service with a surprisingly friendly and unpretentious attitude.  Whenever I arrive, I am welcomed as a repeat visitor, both at the front desk and with a note from the manager (and fruits and sweets) in my room.  On the rare occasion when something is amiss, they simply take care of the problem with good cheer.  To cite just one example, on one trip my television went on the fritz.  When they determined that it would take a little while to fix it, they offered to move me to a suite.  When I demurred on the grounds that moving my things probably wasn't worth the troubles, they offered to buy me a drink in the (very fun) bar and relocate all of my possessions to precisely the same spot, drawer, nightstand, etc. in the new room, which they did.  Beyond the great service, it's in a wonderful location near Hyde Park and Mayfair; the rooms are beautifully furnished in classic English style; the bathrooms are elegant and spotless; it has excellent restaurants; and it even has a good health club and excellent spa.

We especially loved the bar....music, interesting people-watching and great drinks!  We stayed in the deluxe King room and we impressed with the fabulous linens, etc.  The location in Mayfair is perfect for walking everywhere.  Beautiful Hyde Park is right across the street and the flowers are beginning to bloom!

130,Service beyond expected,"I would like to share this story as an example of the wonderful service at the Dorchester.  

At about 2AM on our first night my wife and I were awakened by sounds above our room.  It was as though someone was dragging something across the floor and dropping it periodically.  This lasted possibly ten minutes and stopped.  On the second night, we were again awakened by the same sound at a similar time.  I called the office slightly after 2AM to report the noise... perhaps they could ask the people in the room above to be a bit quieter.  After a brief pause, the manager came to the phone.  ""There is no one in the room above you.""  He asked if we could meet him in the hall outside our room in a few minutes.  Within 5 minutes he was there with two people who moved us to a new room at 2:30 in the morning.  The room was a VERY high priced suite and absolutely gorgeous.   There were no additional charges for the upgrade for the remainder of our 6 day stay.  

We had asked for none of this and will never forget how well we were treated at one of the greatest hotels in the world.",5,2005,03,05
130,"Gorgeous decor, fantastic knowledgeable staff","My friend and I popped into the hotel bar for a cocktails. The service was wonderful (and at £11 per drink you would hope so!) and the cocktails were lovely. 

We were served lots of nice nibbles (aka snacks) and a lounge singer and piano player performed.

As we were leaving, I asked the concierge which tube station was the closest. He asked me which line I needed, and he was able to tell me which station (to save me changing tube lines)

I was impressed all around.

130,A magical experience,"Having stayed on several occasions during the past year at The Dorchester Hotel in London, and also at their sister hotel in Los Angeles California,The Beverley Hills,  I would most certainly recommend The Dorchester Hotel to overseas business guests and tourist visitors alike.
First impressions are superb, attention to detail and quality of accommodation is outstanding and the bedroom technology is very futuristic.  The location is ideal for Mayfair, Knightsbridge and all the major tourist attractions within London.  The concierge desk can assist you in finding tickets for all sold out shows and concerts, when everyone else is showing full.
The Dorchester in London is more expensive than their sister hotel in Beverley Hills, California, but if you are prepared to pay upwards of 400 per night, all your expectations will be exceeded.  
Enjoy the experience.

130,Close to perfection.,"Difficult to detect imperfections at this illustrious hotel . Rooms, decor, common areas, service, manners and style, reception, reservations, bars, location and feeling to be at the centre of everything : all spectacular according to all standards.
 Expensive, but who cares ? You'll have just a few  euros or greenbacks less in your bank account in exchange of a lovely ,lost-lasting memory.
 Pity for that American stationing in the hall in fitness shorts(little could be done, I presume) and for the mildly haughty doormen ostensibly craving for tipping. No other possible ""complaints"" after four stays.
 You'll have plenty of celebrities-watching, if you wish so. But understated customers will find their space and satisfaction in equal manner.

130,A very special hotel indeed,"We stayed here for two days earlier this year to both celebrate our wedding anniversary and to see a concert that was being held at the Royal Albert Hall.  

I cannot fault anything at all about this hotel; it is a very special place indeed and we were treated by all the staff with both respect and kindness.  The outstanding service started from the moment we arrived up till the time we left.  My husband asked one of the staff at the front desk where the ATM machine was; she came out from behind her desk, took us to the entrance and gave us detailed directions.  Everyone was at pains to make sure that we were enjoying our stay.

The room we had overlook Hyde Park and was luxurious.  Separate bath and shower in our bathroom; the bath was massive and deep and the shower huge.  The bed was most comfortable (one of the best night's sleep I've ever had) with a choice of six pillows to choose from.  Turndown service was done with due care and attention; we had chocolates left, they turned the tv towards the bed, they even put down a thin mat by the side of your bed (have never seen that done anywhere else) and left you slippers.

Would certainly stay here again without question.

130,"Top Quality, top service","We stayed at the Dorchester for a friends wedding in May 2004.  We travel down to London semi-regularly and usually pay £1/200 per night for a room, so even the deal of £350 I'd negotiated over the web seemed like a lot for just another 5 star hotel.

The Dorchester is far from 'just another 5 star hotel' though!  It needs a new rating, one that takes into account the attitude and usefulness of the staff, the care and upkeep of the decor, carpets and furniture (so many London hotels are terribly shabby and worn), the size of the room and bathroom, and generally the way you are made to feel like a 5 star guest.

We arrived at 11:30am with a 2:30 check-in, but were immediately shown to our room in person by the receptionist and given a guided tour of hotel facilities first.  Similarly, we wanted to spend Sunday shopping without having to take our bags or car with us, and this was equally no problem - they loaded them into our car for us when we'd had enough around 6pm.  Room service were there within 2 minutes each and every time we called them - even the same guy came back 5 minutes later when we realised my dress needed pressing as well as his suit.

All in all it was by far the best 5 star hotel we've stayed in in London by a very large margin, and we will be returning - even if it is twice the price!",5,2004,06,23

The food in The Grill Room (dinner) was excellent. The hotel is perfectly maintained and in a quiet and charming section of London. After leaving the hustle and bustle of Picadilly it was nice to return to the quiet atmosphere at the Dorchester. For Americans it is very expensive (as is all of London). I would not hesitate to recommend this as one of the nicest hotels I have ever visited.

130,Experience Royal Treatment !,"If you want 5 star quality go elsewhere, because this is 6 star quality! The charm begins as a doorman in tails with a top hat greets you. The hotel is luxurious. Hallways are clean and there are no musty odors. The lobby dining area is the spot for the elite to conduct business. Celebrities of the world stay here. The rooms are first class and clean. Huge marble bathroom. Separate tub, shower & bidet. Internet access in the room, but too expensive for me. I went up to Oxford St. to an Internet café for a fraction of the price. Phone calls from the room cost too much for me as well, so I went to the very private phone booths in the lobby to use my calling card. Best to buy your calling card in London. My US calling card didnt work there. Telephoned the front desk to have a problem with a sink draining corrected and in less than 1 minute an engineer was knocking at the door and fixed it! The staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel food was of excellent quality. There was always security visible so we felt safe. Located across from beautiful Hyde Park.

130,Terrible management,"We stayed there in the hotel for December, my partner and I and 2 other friends and we had lunch there at the restaurant, the thing that struck all 4 of us was the lack of elegance on the part of the staff both inside the reception and in the restaurant, a general manager should impart to his staff the courtesy and kindness required to work within a prestigious chain like this.
Being snobbish and thinking you are superior to the guests does not lead to any results.
Ps very high bill not proportionate to what was received.",1,2024,02,20
130,London 2024,"We visited London last week, always a beautiful city, full of museums and attractions to visit, worth mentioning and not to miss the Tower of London, science museum, Camden district with its little shops and picturesque houses.

130,Manager incapace e stanze sporche che puzzano di fumo,"Abbiamo prenotato una stanza con Amex, che garantisce upgrade alla categoria superiore. Non ci hanno fatto upgrade ma in compenso ci hanno proposto di pagare per lo stesso. Abbiamo detto no e siamo andati nella stanza che ci hanno assegnato : deluxe room city view. 
La city view secondo loro è la vista di un cortile, buio e in disuso. 
La stanza puzzava di fumo impregnato e in bagno c’erano dei capelli dei precedenti inquilini. 
Abbiamo dunque deciso di andarcene e la loro risposta è stata: capiamo.

Danach folgen Scones,  Marmelade und clottet creme, Dessert und kleine süße Naschereien. Übrigens alles auf Wunsch auch milchfrei für Allergiker. Es gibt zu den Produkten,  die die anderen bekommen optisch keinen Unterschied. Man bekommt übrigens so viel wie man  möchte,  es wird immer wieder aufgefüllt und nachgefragt.

130,Soggiorno perfetto,"L'HOTEL

RECEPTION attiva 24/24h, check-in rapidissimo 

L'hotel si trova in un CONTESTO circondato dal verde (Green Park è a due passi), in cui si può apprezzare il fatto di non uscire e trovarsi subito nella caotica quotidianità londinese

La STRUTTURA è imponente e maestosa, classica, ma con un tocco di modernità

Gli INTERNI sono decisamente sfarzosi e lussuosi, rispecchiano appieno lo stile Dorchester che si può notare anche al Principe di Savoia ad esempio

Il PERSONALE è gentilissimo nonché disponibilissimo praticamente ad ogni ora del giorno e della notte

CAMERE

La nostra CAMERA era decisamente confortevole, con un mini ingresso che conduceva da una parte al bagno e dall'altra alla spaziosissima camera con il suo enorme letto matrimoniale. 
Prese della corrente solo con spina inglese, però con adattatori gentilmente forniti dalla struttura.
Frigo Bar molto ricco e vario.

Il BAGNO abbastanza grande, rivestito interamente in marmo, con una comoda vasca da bagno, doppio lavandino, e pieno di asciugamani morbidissimi. Unica nota negativa, solo 2 accappatoi per 3 persone.

CIBO

La COLAZIONE era incredibilmente buona e ricca.
Succo a scelta, uova cucinate a proprio piacimento con accompagnamento di svariate cose (bacon, salsiccia, funghi, hash browns, sanguinaccio e altro), muesli/granola con yogurt o latte, pane tostato e croissant in gran quantità, carpaccio di frutta, più chiaramente una bevanda calda a scelta.

L'ultima sera abbiamo usufruito del bar ordinando del Whisky: non tantissima scelta (3 tipi soltanto) e quindi abbiamo puntato su un Johnnie Walker Black Label.

In generale posso dire che ho avuto una bellissima esperienza al Dorchester. A Londra è sicuramente la scelta migliore che si possa fare per un breve soggiorno città. 

CONSIGLIATO!!!",5,2017,05,09
130,Ottimo,"Hotel di alto livello, personale attento e professionale,internet gratuito, colazione ottima, camere perfette....il migliore te all'inglese di Londra, un vero trionfo di tramezzini, dolci e pasticcini.assolutamente da non mancare .Un vero peccato dover partire...",5,2017,01,17
130,Enttäuschung pur !!!!,"Die Suite 601/602 war bei meiner Ankunft eiskalt, 2 Anrufe beim Housekeeping mit der Bitte um"" assistance ""blieben ohne Reaktion. Das Bad ( Marmor bis unter die Decke, Einfachverglasung, nur die Handtuchhalter als Heizung)war auch erst nach 2 Tagen wenigstens lauwarm. Wattepads und Q-tips wurden erst nach 3-maliger Nachfrage geliefert. Eine Preisliste für die Minibar gab es auch erst nach mehrmaliger Nachfrage.
Auf meine bescheidene Frage am ""spartanischem Frühstücksbuffet"" ob eine Käsesorte und zwei versch. Schinken wohl alles sei, beantwortete man mit dem Hinweis, daß ich ja auch im à la carte Restaurant essen könne ...Die Marmeladen-Portions-Gläschen auf den Tischen wurden nicht ergänzt, was weg war war weg !
Ein reichhaltigeres Frühstücksbuffet gibt es in jedem Mittelklassehotel ! und dies macht ja auch den Reiz aus, daß man von jedem ein wenig nehmen kann . Man bracht mir schließlich einen ganzen Mozarella - 80% wären zurückgegangen, hätte nicht der Nebentisch Interesse gezeigt. Eine ""Platte"" mit je 5 dünnen Scheibchen Ananas, Papaya und Melone für alle Gäste ? Lachhaft !
Einer der beiden Safes funktionierte weder bei der Anreise - noch bei der Abreise !  Informationsmaterial ausschließlich in Englisch - bei einem (lt. eigener Homepage)   London Best Luxury Hotel einfach ein absolutes NO GO !
Nach meiner Abreise erhielt ich einen ausführlichen Fragebogen - in Englisch natürlich, als ich ihn nicht ausfüllte, wurde ich - in englisch nochmals daran erinnert !
Auf meinen Versuch meine ""Nichtreaktion"" auf den Fragebogen in einer mail an die mail-Adresse der homepage zu erklären- wurde damit beantwortet, daß diese Adresse nicht die direkte des Hotels sei und man daher nicht zuständig wäre. Leider habe ich bisher keine Möglichkeit gefunden mich direkt an das Hotel zu wenden !

Im Zeitalter der Computer und dem Wissen, daß man internationales Publikum beherbergt, reichen großartige Blumenarrangements und antike Möbel m.E. nicht aus, Service (nicht nur freundliches Lächeln) sollte Standard sein.

Ich jedenfalls werde dieses Hotel freiwillig nicht wieder betreten !

Als ich diese Bewertung mit ""ungenügend "" abgeben wollte, nahm der Computer es nicht an, ebenso ""mangelhaft"" wurde nicht akzeptiert. Ich versuche es jetzt nacheinander mit allen Punkten - Gemeint ist allerdeings  UNGENÜGEND !!!!!",1,2017,01,01

130,Un 5 stelle senza se e senza ma.,"Certamente uno dei migliori hotel di Londra e d'Europa.
Ci sono stato per lavoro due notti (solo due purtroppo). 
Devo dire che la camera (interna di quelle non enormi) è all'altezza della fama, come tutte le aree comuni. Il bagno in marmo riporta ai bei tempi...
Il bar è di fatto gestito da italiani (tutti i barman lo sono, alcuni vengono dal Gallia di Milano). Dopo qualche minuto ti chiamano rispettosmente per cognome, come alla reception, dove dopo 5 minuti che sei lì sembra che tu ci sia stato centinaia di volte!
L'atmosfera british è unica. Peccato per il traffico intorno (ma non da fastidio).
La stanza (allego le foto) è assolutamente perfetta, in un ordine che direi maniacale, come erano le stanze degli alberghi della CIGA un tempo. Difficile fare critiche. L'unico aspetto negativo (ma per alcuni può essere positivo) è la colazione. Non c'è il classico self che amo (quello di Villa d'Este e quello del Sofitel a fianco della stazione di Francoforte sono dei capolavori), ma si ordina... certo che 45 £, circa 60 euro, per una colazione con bacon e uova e non c'era il sanguinaccio! Invece il bar ha prezzi più ""umani"" mi pare 12 £ per una birra... curiosamente non c'è la spina ma solo le bottiglie. Andato e venuto in taxi. Il Conciege è di una efficenza impeccabile. La parte comune dell'albergo è semplicemente bellissima, certo non è il posto dove puoi girare in maglietta e jeans...",5,2016,03,03
130,Más allá de las cinco estrellas,"Situado en Mayfair, frente a Hyde Park, The Dorchester es un hotel magnífico. De principio a fin, una estadía de primera con muy pocas observaciones.

Los Bugattis y Lamborghinis estacionados a la entrada son los primeros en recibirte. Pronto, pierdes de vista tu equipaje para encontrarlo poco después en tu habitación, después de un servicio de recepción muy cordial. Dos llaves: una para la habitación y para activar el ascensor y otra para los ambientes especiales del hotel (salón de trabajo, gimnasio, sauna). 

La habitación te recibe con una bandeja de fruta fresca (que vuelven a llenar constantemente a lo largo de los días): ciertamente, no hay mejor manera de comenzar a disfrutar la estadía que con un racimo de uvas blancas. La habitación en perfecto estado, como habría de esperarse. Baño de mármol con una tina particularmente amplia (puntos extra por ello). La despensa surtida y elegante, aunque con algunos años encima (primera pequeña observación). 

Quizás el único detalle que no me agradó (segunda pequeña observación) fue que el control del televisor tenía las baterías gastadas y no funcionaba bien. Llamé a recepción y para cuando regresé a la habitación ya habían solucionado el problema. Nada grave, pero uno esperaría que verifiquen detalles como ese antes de entregar una habitación. De todos modos, el servicio fue superlativo a lo largo de toda la estadía. Simplemente impecable.

Necesitaba imprimir unos documentos. Ningún problema, fui al salón de trabajo. Dos computadoras, impresora, todo lo necesario. Deseaba hacer ejercicio, el gimnasio estaba en el sótano. Pequeño, pero funcional, con todo lo indispensable. Está conectado con el área de sauna y camerinos, por lo que se puede pasar rápidamente de un lado a otro. El único detalle (tercera pequeña observación) es que no todos los ascensores bajan al nivel donde se encuentra el gimnasio y no falta alguien que toma el ascensor equivocado y se ve obligado a ""hacer trasbordo"" en el primer piso.

El periódico de su elección lo encontrará todas las mañanas colgando de la puerta de su habitación. El desayuno lo sirven en el restaurante The Grill, en el primer piso. La culinaria inglesa no es mi favorita por lo que el desayuno no me pareció delicioso, aunque ciertamente se podía pedir cualquier cosa que uno desease. Lo mejor, de lejos, los tés. De hecho, el hotel es muy reconocido para ir a tomar el té a media tarde, sentarse en uno de los sofás de The Promenade y escuchar tocar al pianista. 

Dentro de todo, una experiencia más que agradable.",5,2016,02,08
130,Aussegewöhnlich gut,"Das Dorchester ist ein wirklich empfehlenswertes Hotel, für alle die den alten Glanz eines traditionelen Grandhotel mögen. Der Übergang von alten Stil und Service zu moderner Einrichtung wurde wirklich gut hinbekommen. Der Service war erstklassig, wir hatten lediglich ein paar kleinere Mängel in unserer Suite, die aber nicht weiter relevant waren. ",4,2016,01,16
130,Una continua conferma,"Il Dorchester era e resta uno dei migliori hotel di Londra. Massima attenzione ai dettagli, personale di altissimo livello, attento e mai invadente.
Personalmente sconsiglio le Deanery Suites (quelle che una volta erano classificate come Junior), non per l'ampiezza, quanto per le posizioni infelici in cui sono collocate.
Meglio optare per una suite Mayfair od una Stanhope.
Imperdibile un tea pomeridiano con club-sandwiches alla Promenade; la sera, se si decide di restare in hotel e di non cenare in camera, il China Tang offre una delle migliori interpretazioni di cucina fusion di tutta Londra.
Non ho mai cenato da Alain Ducasse, ma se la qualità è la stessa che aveva  Les Ambassadeurs au Crillon credo non serva alcuna recensione.
Unica pecca, proprio a voler essere ipersensibili, la zona fitness non è e non è mai stata particolarmente attrezzata, cosa comune alla maggior parte degli hotel di lusso storici.",5,2015,11,20
130,Stupendo!,"Non solo un hotel, un'esperienza sensoriale! Quando entri nella hall sembra di essere in un giardino fiorito... Un trionfo di fiori accoglie i clienti con una scenografia ed un profumo che soddisfa tutti i sensi! Camere grandi ed arredate con gusto... Molto opulenti! Servizio ineccepibile. Hotel abbastanza centrale! Vale la pena fare colazione nella ""promenade"" dell albergo. Valore aggiunto il ristorante China Tang, secondo me il miglior cinese di Londra! ",5,2015,10,22

Tutto è rimasto invariato, semplicemente perfetto, ad iniziare dell'accoglienza molto cortese con un caloroso ""bentornato al Dorchester"". Quest'anno ho provato la cucina durante un breve e semplice pranzo e devo dire che è stata un'ottima esperienza.
Per gli amanti della tranquillità notturna consiglio di chiedere una camera sulla corte. Si rinuncia alla vista su Hyde Park ma almeno si possono aprire di notte le finestre senza problemi di rumore dalla strada (molto trafficata) sottostante.

la stanza era fantastica, in tipico stile classico.
Unica pecca che il personale non ha fatto la couverture serale e quindi non ci ha fatto trovare l'acqua in camera, necessaria vista la temperatura tropicale della stanza.
Per il resto molto bello!
Il bagno non era vicinissimo, infatti la camera è progettata per comunicare con un'altra stanza e il bagno si trova in mezzo.
Molto bello THE GRILL dove fare colazione e la promenade dove ho preso un fantastico Afternoon Tea! Consiglio!",4,2015,01,27
130,Non mi ha mai deluso,"Tornato recentemente per qualche giorno, continuo ad apprezzare certi particolari che lo rendono unico: la cortesia del personale, l'ampiezza delle camere (molte delle quali rinnovate e secondo me migliorate esteticamente) e il comfort dei  materassi :D, il food and beverage gestito impeccabilmente sia in camera che nei ristoranti/bar e le decorazioni floreali, Un discorso a parte meritano le colazioni e il tè pomeridiano. In attesa di scoprire cosa sostituirà la stanza 'Scottish', ho testato lo spazio alternativo all'insostituibile 'Promenade' che ho amato meno se non altro perché -bevande e poco altro esclusi- è self-service. La posizione è perfetta, ma quella non cambia da decenni.",5,2014,12,02
130,High Tea im Dorchester – ein Höhepunkt bei jeder Englandreise,"Das Hotel Dorchester in der Park Lane am Hyde Park ist eines der elegantesten Hotels Londons, viele sagen, es ist eindeutig das beste. High Tea, für den es täglich mehrere Termine von 14 Uhr bis 17:30 Uhr gibt, ist ein besonderes Ereignis, da Qualität und Ambiente einzigartig sind. Eine Buchung wird sowohl per SMS auf das Mobiltelefon als auch per e-mail bestätigt und es ist ratsam, lange vor dem geplanten Termin zu reservieren. Die Eleganz der „Promenade“, wie die exquisite Lounge des Dorchester heißt, wo High Tea serviert wird, ist unübertrefflich. Kleine Sitzgruppen in großzügigem Abstand gewährleisten private Sphäre und Raum für entspannte Gespräche im Geschäftsbereich oder auf privater Ebene. Dezente Klaviermusik gibt der Atmosphäre auch eine akustische Note. Ein Beispiel der angebotenen High Tea - Varianten: der „Champagne Afternoon Tea.“, der in mehreren Gängen serviert wird. Es beginnt mit einem Glas Laurent-Perrier NV Champagne und einer Auswahl hochwertiger Sandwiches:  “Cucumber with cream cheese on caraway seed bread, Egg mayonnaise with shiso cress on white bread, Chicken with wholegrain mustard mayonnaise on basil bread, Smoked salmon on granary bread”, gefolgt von: “Warm raisin and plain scones served with homemade strawberry jam, a seasonal jam and Cornish clotted cream”, wieder gefolgt von einer Auswahl an French pastries, alles begleitet vom wichtigsten, einer Auswahl an speziell ausgewählten seltenen Teesorten, unter denen man wählen kann. Schließlich sorgt ein perfekter Service, dezent, schnell und freundlich für ein absolutes Wohlgefühl beim Genießen dieses klassischen High Tea.",5,2014,11,18
130,Come giocare in Serie A,"Mi capita di viaggiare un bel po', per lavoro ma non solo. Ho soggiornato in diversi hotel 5 stelle, magari di grandi catene con presenza globale. 
In generale, per rendere l'idea, è stato un po' come passare da uno stadio di in una cittadina di provincia in serie C a uno splendido di una grande città in Serie A. 
Cambiano i clienti, il servizio, il personale, l'attenzione maniacale ai dettagli, l'eleganza classica di chi sa di poterselo permettere per blasone indiscutibilmente superiore. Cambiano anche i prezzi ma chi osa approcciare questa struttura lo sa bene e sa di poterselo permettere. 
Ho provato il bar, la colazione, il ristorante cinese. Tutto straordinario. 
La posizione è perfetta. 
Un soggiorno che ricorderò a lungo. ",5,2014,10,15
130,Ma il Principe...,"In questo hotel è tutto perfetto come è sempre perfetto negli hotel della Dorchester Collection...ma chi è stato al Principe di Savoia resta un pò deluso: niente piscina, niente sauna, niente hamam... Ma insomma, trascurato questo, la Spa  è comunque molto elegante e dispone sia di trattamenti di ultima generazione che di aromaterapia. I ristoranti sono diversi e tutti interessanti. Molto bello il bar dove fare colazione con sculture in vetro e rare bottiglie nelle teche. Strategica la posizione, vicinissimo all'Hard Rock Cafè, al Maze, all'Hakkasan, al Nobu, ad Hyde Park, a Oxford Street.  Grazie di tutto per la settimana di belle vacanze. Per chi vuole essere meno classico e più stiloso, di fronte c'è il 45 Park Lane, sempre della stessa Dorchester.",5,2014,09,22
130,"Muy bueno, pero muy caro","Es un hotel caro, eso tendría que ser su principal característica. Si es un lindo hotel, pero a juzgar de la oferta en Londres, hay mejores por menos precio.

Al bar personale italiano dedito a viziare i clienti.
La zona è splendida per chi il mattino, prima di iniziare la giornata, gradisce fare una corsa o una passeggiata nel parco. In 15 minuti si raggiunge regent street a piedi.

Lo peor del hotel en general es el área de alimentos y bebidas, el Room service terrible, si el mesero hubiera podido deja todo en la puerta, en el desayuno todo fatal, a pesar que todo lo dejamos escrito, mandaron todo mal, el servicio es descortés y frío, los meseros no son agradables. Lo que se lleva el premio al peor restaurante del hotel es el restaurante CHINO, definitivamente es terrible, la atención es exageradamente mala, llegamos al lugar y nos recibieron mal, las chicas de recepción son prepotentes y parece que les pides un regalo en vez de un servicio que vas a pagar, se creen que la tierra no las merece, cero cordiales. Nos asignan una mesa y 5 minutos después llega diciendo que nos teníamos que cambiar porque esa área estaba reservada para 16 personas y que no podíamos quedarnos ahí, nos mueve a otra mesa, nos pasan el menú de comida, 20 minutos después regresan a tomarnos la orden, nunca nos ofrecen nada de tomar hasta mucho después que estábamos comiendo las entradas, yo no pedí nada antes porque quería ver a que hora se tomarían la molestia de tomarnos la orden de bebidas, pase más de 2 horas en el restaurante, su reservación nunca la vi, entonces no se porque nos movieron y el servicio fue muy malo. Ah pero eso si, cargaron el servicio sin preguntarnos sí deseaba dejarlo o no.
Por otro lado el recepcionista dijo que no habían lugares disponibles para la hora del te cuando en realidad si había disponibilidad.
El check in y out muy normales, nada relevantes, nos dieron un up grade a suit y listo, pero no es un gran hotel, no tiene nada de especial, los centros de consumo terribles y el servicio muy pobre.
Eso si los precios que cobran son como sí merecieran la excelencia",1,2013,12,16
130,""" Das beste Hotel in London ""","Ein Besuch im "" The Dorchester "" in London sollte ein jeder einmal in seinem Leben gemacht haben. Es ist ein Hotel dass beim Aufenthalt in dieser Zeit einem alles vergessen läßt, jeglicher Streß und die hecktig im Leben, man kann die Seele einfach baumeln lassen.
Der fünf Uhr Tea iin der Adventszeit ist sehr zu empfehlen. Eine Rservierung ist schwer und man sollte sie Anfang des Jahres schon tätigen. Die Speisen und Getränke die während des fünf Uhr Tea`s serviert werden sind perfekt zubereitet und werden durch den Tea Butler sehr gut erklärt und präsentiert. Wir möchten uns bei Juan besonders bedanken der uns sehr verwöhnt hat und uns sogar eine Führung durch das Hotel ermöglichte.
Die Atmosphäre im "" The Dorchester "" ist wie in einem Märchen aus Tausend und eine Nacht.
Es ist eines der letzten waren Traumhotels die es noch gibt.
Das gesammte Personal ist äußerst freundlich und hilfsbereit, wir haben uns sehr Wohl gefüllt und es war ein unvergesslicher fünf Uhr Tea am 2. Advent gewesen.
Vielen Dank....",5,2013,12,16

130,Giorni da Principesse!!!!,"Il Dorchester si presenta al suo interno come una struttura lussosa, di classe e molto principesca. Siamo in 3 amiche, e veniamo accolte di buon mattino con un sorriso sia dal doormen che dal gentilissimo personale della reception, che ci avverte, che dato l'orario la stanza al momento non è ancora disponibile...poco male!!! facciamo ceck-in, depositiamo i bagagli e via per una bella passeggiata, dopo aver lasciato il recapito telefonico nel caso la stanza fosse stata pronta prima del previsto.
Tornate nel primo pomeriggio, veniamo gentilmente accompagnate in stanza, che, con nostro stupore non è una stanza ma bensì una immensa suite!!!! composta da doppi servizi, salotto meraviglioso con caminetto, doppio televisore, camera da letto comodossima e letto aggiuntivo grande come una piscina. Temperatura dell'aria condizionata sempre perfetta, minibar completo e con prodotti ottimi, coverture notturna puntuale e precisa, insonorizzazione per un sonno da sogno, guanciali molto confortevoli, confort assoluto in tutto....unica nota non stonata, ma che potrebbe essere migliorata, la marca dei prodotti da toilette, buona ma non all'altezza del resto dell'eccellenza dell'hotel. 
Siamo state sia al Bar e devo dire che i drinks e le chiacchere di Giuliano e del suo staff, professionale e preciso, sono stati un toccasana serale prima del sonno notturno che davvero ci hanno fatto sentire coccolate e in vacanza.
Complimenti allo staff del Bkf per la selezione dei formaggi con frutta fresca e secca e il cestino dei croissant, ottima la presentazione del salmone. Simpatici e carini nel procurarci il giornale ogni giorno e tenerci aggiornate dell'arrivo del Royal Baby...dopotutto eravamo "" future zie davvero Royal""!!!",5,2013,07,28
130,GRAZIE SERENA!,"l'8 di gennaio sono stata con il mio compagno e i suoi genitori per partecipare al rinomato afternoon tea.
Esperienza davvero piacevole.
In un posto così non ti aspetti di trovare persone così disponibili: concierge e camerieri impeccabili, anche nelle piccolezze.
Da notare le raffinatezze:
- siamo arrivati qualche minuto prima, e ci hanno fatto attendere in un salottino davanti a un pianista bravissimo
- la tavola era apparecchiata perfettamente e le porcellane erano davvero raffinate
- tutte le portate (dolci e salate) sono squisite e al gusto si percepisce la freschezza degli ingredienti
- Marvin e Serena, il personale che ha curato il nostro tavolo, sono stati così premurosi da prepararci dei box per portare a casa degli assaggi di pasticceria freschissima.
Relax puro, consigliato e tanti complimenti ancora!",5,2013,01,15
130,Lujo y simpatía,"Siempre a disposición del cliente. Todo está perfecto: las habitaciones, el personal, los salones... Además es el hotel de las ""stars"", solo tienes que sentarte en el lobby o el gran salón de te y mirar. Es un continuo espectáculo.

El único inconveniente es el desayuno. Me parece que el continental es bastante escaso. Al no tener un buffet, el servicio de mesa no te sirve ni unos cereales...",5,2012,12,07
130,week end splendido,"abbiamo soggiornato all'inizio di ottobre al Dorchester, è stata una speldida esperienza.
L'inizio è stato perfetto, grazie al pacchetto acquistato, ci hanno conferito un up grade sulla camera prenotata ed abbiamo avuto in camera una bottiglia di champagne e per cominciare non è male.
All'atto del check in, alla reception abbiamo trovato che  il front supervisor era italiano, il Sig. Alfonso, che in modo super professionale ed amichevole ci ha illustrato l'hotel, cosa fare a Londra ecc., saputo che l'occasione del w.e. era il compleanno della mia compagna, ci ha fatto avere in camera una torta di buon compleanno, omaggio molto gradito e di classe.
L'hotel è veramente perfetto, pulizia, stato della camera dove eravamo alloggiati, personale  disponibile, gentile e professionale che ci ha sempre messo a ns. agio e coccolati.
Anche la colazione servita al tavolo è stata un esempio di professionalità , qualità ed ottimo sevizio
La posizione è splendida, una bellissima esperienza da raccomandare.",5,2012,10,28
130,very cool hotel,"während meines aufenthaltes in London wohnte ich im dorchester und ich kann das hotel sehr empfehlen. es fängt man mit dem herzlichen und warem empfang und auch die zimmer und deren ausstattung ist wirklich einzigartig. der service ist einfach großartig und die zimmer sehr geräumig. die lage der hotels ist auch besonders gut, denn es liegt direkt an der park lane.",5,2012,07,30
130,afternoon tea divino!!,"sono stata all'hotel dorchester solo per l'afternoon tea perchè avevo letto dei premi vinti per il miglior tea e l'esperienza è stata unica!! siamo giunti in un lussuosissimo hotel, elegantemente arredato e con gigantesche composizioni di fiori freschi, personale molto accogliente eprofessionale, ci hanno fatto accomodare in una grande sala da tea su un divano e ci hanno servito tramezzii di 4 tipi freschissimi e gustosissimi che riproponevano continuamente, poi è stata la volta di scones di due tipi con marmellata e clotted cream ed infine pasticcini il tutto in quantità infinita, il tea è stato servito in prezioso servizi di porcellana finissima con molta cura per la temperatura ed il camerire molto gentile ed educato. esperienza sensoriale indescrivible. cara ma sicuramente un'esperienza unica!! da rifare ogni volta che si va in London!!",5,2012,06,07
130,The Epitome of Quality,"Il Dorchester è uno dei 3 hotel che preferisco in Europa e dove mi sento davvero a casa.
Sono stato qui la prima volta nel 2002 quando cercavo casa a Londra ed avendoci soggiornato per oltre un mese ho avuto modo di apprezzarne tutti gli aspetti.
Forse non è il miglior hotel di Londra (il Ritz mi è stato detto essere ancora più lussuoso), ma a me piace tantissimo anche per la posizione in cui sorge (di fronte ad Hyde Park) su Park Lane e nel contesto di Mayfair che è una delle zone più lussuose di Londra (uscite a fare una passeggiata a piedi di 4 o 5 blocchi e contate il numero di RR e Bentley posteggiate e provate a trovare un termine di paragone in Europa Continentale che non sia Monaco).
Non mi dilungo in elogi per lo staff che è all'altezza dello standard dell'hotel, ma racconto un piccolo aneddoto: una sera ero stato con amici al Boujis ed ho bevuto talmente tanto da non ricordare nemmeno chi mi avesse pietosamente riaccompagnato nella hall dell'hotel, so solo che sono stato spogliato e messo a letto dal personale dell'albergo e queste attenzioni per me fidelizzano un cliente per la vita.
Le Junior Suites sono ampie ed accoglienti, difettano solo per la vista non propriamente appagante (di massima guardano verso l'interno dell'hotel e sulle cucine); potendo meglio optare per una Suite Stanhope.
Per uno snack veloce o un pranzo di affari è d'obbligo attendere la Promenade, per qualcosa di più formale o una cena romantica c'è Alain Ducasse ed ho detto tutto.
Nel basement dell'hotel si trovano la SPA dove però non sono mai stato e la sala fitness, che non è ampissima, ma ben attrezzata: occorre fare attenzione agli orari perché può essere frequentata anche da terzi non ospiti dell'hotel.
Entusiasticamente consigliato.",5,2012,05,07
130,Gemischte Eindrücke,"Das Dorchester liegt perfekt am Hyde Park und bietet eine Vielzahl von Restaurants, Spa und Fitness. Es gilt als eines der besten Hotels in London. Ja, es ist schön, die Auswahl und Qualität an Bars und Restaurant beeindruckt. Die Zimmer sind auch schön, aber mein Zimmer hat in der billigsten Kategorie 350 Pfund gekostet - da hätte ich mehr erwartet, zB das das Fenster richtig schliesst und der Teppich frei von Flecken ist. Das Fitnesszentrum ist ein kleiner Raum im Keller, enttäuschend.
Sehr teuer, gut aber nicht sehr gut. Muss nicht sein, es sei denn, man muss nicht zahlen....",4,2012,05,07
130,uno dei migliori bar della citta per bere champagne!,"un ottimo posto per festeggiare un evento speciale, certo non costa poco ma hanno una grande varieta di champagne. i baristi sono quasi tutti italiani, sono bravissimi a fare i cocktail classici, e vengono offerte olive giganti ripiene, davvero buone! anche i bicchieri sono di cristallo e il servizio e' ottimo, molto tranquillo e familiare, scherzoso! certo, si vedono prostitute che vagano tra i clienti alla ricerca di uomini facoltosi pronti a stappare una bottiglia con loro e poi procedere verso le lussuosissime stanze dei piani di sopra. l'ingresso e' pieno di auto di lusso che attirano turisti e curiosi!",5,2012,03,21
130,Mejor de los esperado,"Fuimos 3 dias a Londres en familia, con dos niñas pequeñas. Cogimos una oferta familiar en la que la habitacion de las niñas sale gratis. La verdad es que por el precio esperaba menos, pero la verdad es que las habitaciones eran bastante grandes y al estar comunicadas el espacio sería de unos 100 mts. Es cierto que necesitaban alguna reforma y que las vistas no eran bonitas, pero por el precio era más que sufuciente. Otra cosa a destacar es el personal, muy amables y profesionales, sólo tengo buenas palabras para ellos y a destacar al encargado del theater desk y a Laura Pineiro de central de reservas de Dorchester Collection.
El desayuno bien",5,2012,03,20
130,Immer noch bei den Besten,"Die Lage des 'Dorchester' am Hyde Park London ist schon etwas spezielles. Das Haus strahlt die luxuriöse Atmosphäre des Grand Hotels aus. die Mitarbeiter sind dienstbeflissen und wollen einen den Aufenthalt so angenehm wie nur möglich machen. 
Wir wohnten in einer grossen Suite mit Aussicht auf den Park, bei der wirklich nichts fehlt. Luxuriöses Badezimmer. Geräumige Einrichtung, eleganter Salon - alles vom Feinsten. 
Frühstück an einem Tag in der legendären Halle und am andern Tag im Grill - nach Auswahl-Menu-Karte, sehr gepflegt.",5,2011,07,12
130,hotel da sogno,"posizionato di fronte ad hyde park il Dorchester è davvero il grande hotel per antonomasia, la classe è davvero unica, le camere finemente arredate, il servizio impeccabile, concierge soddisfa ogni vostra esigenza.
Consiglio di prenotare il te servito nel pomeriggio,e la sera il club dove si può cenare fino a tardi e sentire musica o ballare.",5,2011,07,11
130,Eine Klasse für sich,"Wunderbares Hotel. Typisch Britisch. Lage sehr gut nur die Zimmer etwas klein. Der Service war sehr gut nur für meinen Geschmack alles etwas zu steif. Aber ansonsten fantastisch. In der Nähe gibt es viele sehr gute Hotels, aber dieses ist mit Abstand das beste. Ich komme gerne wieder und das nächste mal nehme ich mir auch mehr Zeit die Stadt kennen zu lernen!",5,2011,03,15
130,Ein Klassiker - very British eben!,"Das Dorchester ist eines der klassischen Luxushotels in London. Man muß diesen Stil mögen! Dann gibt es aber nichts auszusetzen - denn alle Zimmer sind in London klein! Sehr freundlicher Service und die Lage ist eben auch perfekt! Die Zimmer sind sehr ruhig! Ansonsten ist ein ständiges Kommen und Gehen, Sehen und Gesehen werden!",5,2010,12,29
130,"Schönes Hotel, guter Service, etwas verstaubt","Ein sehr schönes Hotel, man fühlt sich in die alten Tage versetzt, was auch für die Zimmer gilt. Allerdiungs sind die Armaturen teilweise auch noch aus den alten Tagen, also teilweise nicht wirklich gut in Stand gehalten. Der Service kam bei sehr viel Andrang etwas ins schwimmen. Alles in allem kam das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis etwas zu kurz, es war aber trotzdem eine sehr schöne Erfahrung, freundliche und vorallem zuvorkommende Mitarbeiter (jeder einzelne!).",4,2010,08,05
130,Pure Eleganz,"Dieses Hotel schafft es durch seinen zurückhaltenden und doch tadellosen Service, dass man sich als Gast wie Zuhause fühlt. Der Concierge kam höchstpersönlich um mir beim binden meiner Fliege zu helfen, die Art Deco Zimmer sind mit wunderschönen Antiquitäten eingerichtet, der High Tea ist ein Erlebniss.",5,2010,06,25
130,Un hotel excelente,"Era la tercera vez que ibamos a Londres y siempre estuve interesado en alojarme en The Dorchester y debo decir que no me decepcionó en absoluto.Habitaciones clasicas y cómodas, excelentes cuartos de baño y personal muy atento.
Tuvimos un pequeño problema al llegar con el equipaje que tardaron en subirlo a la habitación y tuvimos que reclamarlo.Salimos a dar un paseo y al regresar nos habían enviado una bandeja de bombones para disculparse.
Buen restaurante el Grill y excelente el Alain Ducasse con un menú al mediodia con una excelentisima relación calidad-precio y un servicio atentisimo en los dos restaurantes.
Muy bonito el Promenade donde tambien puedes tomar el desayuno.
Una mención muy especial para dos personas.Joe el encargado del Theatre Desk atentisimo y encantador y Laura en reservas una compatriota española tambien atentisima.
Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, era como dije antes la tercera vez que viajabamos a Londres y este viaje fue muy diferente sobre todo por el hotel.",5,2010,06,22
130,"Vorzeige Hotel, dennoch ein wenig ""verstaubt""","Eingeladen von meinem Chef reisten wir im Oktober 08 nach London.
Das Hotel, indem häufig auch Stars absteigen ist wirklich ein sehr luxuriöses Ambiente. Das Personal ist bestens geschult- ich habe nie solch hilfsbereites Personal erlebt!

Die Zimmer sind riesig und luxuriös, dennoch wirkt das gesamte Hotel etwas ""historisch"" auf mich. Mag daran liegen, dass mir moderne Designhotels mehr zusprechen. 

Das Frühstück war sehr gut und sehr vielfältig. Sehr lobend möchte ich noch die Bar des Hotels loben. In erstaunlich moderner Umgebung kann man seinen Drink bei schöner Jazzmusik genießen.

Der Wellnessbereich war ebenfalls sehr einladend, besonders weil er sehr ruhig war.",4,2010,06,21
130,Altmodisch aber sehr britisch,"The Dorchester ist ein Luxushotel in London. London ist ein sehr teures Pflaster, aber selbst unter den teuren Häusern fällt das Dorchester in Bezug auf die Grösse des Bades und des Zimmers sehr positiv auf.

Die Bar und auch das Restaurant sind sehr ansprechend.

Mein Fazit beeindruckend, aber zu teuer",4,2010,06,13
130,The Dorchester London,super geniales sehr elegantes hotel - naomi champell war auch hier,5,2010,02,01
130,Große Klasse,"Große Klasse, großer Stil, das ist The Dorchester Hotel. Mehr London auf höchstem Niveau geht nicht. 

Erstklassiger, rundum professioneller, sehr persönlicher Service. Ein tiptop gastronomisches Angebot mit einer beeindruckenden Vielfalt von drei vollwertigen, parallel operierenden Restaurants und drei Bars. Das ist schon außergewöhnlich für ein Hotel in der heutigen Zeit. Blitzsaubere Zimmer ohne Schnickschnack. Ankommen, wohlfühlen!

Der neue Spa ist shocking in seinem Mut und seiner filmreifen Eleganz. Hollywood in London, a MUST SEE and MUST RELAX ! 

Das Geheimnis und der Erfolg des Dorchesters sind offensichtlich seine gelungene Zusammenstellung ( und das heißt keine Ver-Mischung ! ) von klassischem Londoner High Style der ganz traditionellen Art und modernen Elementen wie dem luxeriösen Spa und den super eleganten Erlebniswelten der drei Restaurants (britisch, französisch, chinesisch). 

Nichts in diesem Hotel wirkt übertrieben und nichts ist eine mühsame Kopie von irgendwas, alles ist authentisch, großzügig und sehr gut. 
Dieses Hotel ist ein Himmel für Individualisten. The Dorchester ist große Klasse !",5,2009,09,08
