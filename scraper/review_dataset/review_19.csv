19,Clean and classy boutique hotel,"Excellent location
Friendly and competent staff
Rooms were clean and turndown service welcome
Only negative is very limited pool hours.",5,2024,10,17
19,Amazing,"Great location, staff extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Can’t fault it really but to be picky it would be handy if the tv had a few more English speaking channels as the News got a bit depressing, but I wasn’t there to watch TV and the city had amazing sights. ",5,2023,02,26
19,Great location,"Excellent location, close to many attractions. A calm oasis, lovely rooftop terrace and attentive service by all staff. ",5,2024,10,15
19,Nice 5 stars hotel,"Near the center of Barcelona, near public transportation, clean and with good service. Roof Coffie shop (and pool in the right weather). Breakfast is very expensive but there is an exelent coffie shop a few meters away on the street near by where we had a great breakfast ('Efecte').",4,2024,10,13
19,Quick Stay at Hotel Claris,"Service

We arrived from the airport about noon time, so our rooms were not quite ready. They indeed were sold out during our stay. Not unexpected as they are truly a boutique hotel with only 124 rooms. However, they did have our rooms ready pretty quickly and before the standard check in time. Check in was smooth and we waited up at the rooftop pool and bar area, so no issues there. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.

As you might imagine, we were in direct communication with the hotel via email for a variety of items, including transportation. They were very responsive and took care of all the issues. We were not really expecting that from half way around the world and the fact they left Hyatt, but definitely not the case. This was outstanding and they were ready for our arrival. Remember, this was a group of 8, so making sure things go smoothly is not always a sure thing.

Room and Amenities

We booked a lower level superior room which is a smaller room, but more than adequate for what we needed. We typically book lower level rooms as our World of Hyatt status is supposed to provide room upgrades when available. This did not work out given the termination of their Hyatt affiliation.  

We were on the 4th floor facing the street and the street noise was pretty considerable. Some noise dampening glass windows would have been nice, but it was fine. The room had a mini fridge, safe, and decent storage given its smaller overall size. The bathroom was ample and had a large tub area. The bed was comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. It appears that throughout Europe the hotels use the key cards as a master switch for all the electrical lights and outlets throughout the room. Once powered, there are the standard switches and such.

Breakfast was included with our rooms and included some buffet options and also made to order items. It was more than ample for what we needed. We did do dinner items on the rooftop one night which was good. Service in these areas was also good.

They also had a spa on site but we did not use that amenity.

Transfers

As mentioned, we set up our airport to hotel to seaport transfers through the hotel. Ken was a bit nervous with this as there were no official confirmation documents or items to provide to the driver upon pick up. The hotel concierge said the driver will be at the airport with our name on a sign when we exit out the terminal. This was a bit nerve racking as we had no names or contact information for the transportation people. 

Well, smooth as silk. The driver was waiting with a sign as promised. They took good care of us. Trust and relax. 

The bottom line is we would definitely recommend this hotel for those looking to travel to Barcelona. The price was reasonable in comparison to other hotels and its central location is nice for visiting those must see places in Barcelona.",5,2024,10,09
19,Luxury at its best,"Perfect located Hotel, wonderful staff and furthermore the Breakfast Team did more than expected. We totally enjoyed our stay, many thanks!",5,2024,10,09
19,Faultless!,"This was my first trip (and hopefully not the last) to the beautiful city of Barcelona, and I do not often offer recommendations.  However, I would never choose to stay anywhere else… the staff, service, cleanliness, location and quality of the facilities were fabulous!",5,2024,10,05
19,My Stay at Claris Hotel & Spa,"Warm greetings and reception. Easy and informative check in. Courtesy, knowledge and warm staff. Fabulous and comfortable room and amazing amenities.",5,2024,10,03
19,"Excellent stay,  fantastic staff!","Rooms are very nice, with all the amenities. The front desk team was awesome.. we arrived early and they were able to get our room ready quickly.  They also gave us good suggestions on nearby places to go to. The rooftop restaurant is great for an evening meal and drinks! Will be back!",5,2024,10,03
19,Barcelona Dream,The location in Barcelona was perfect.  This boutique hotel is beautiful and located in an ideal place close to high end shopping and numerous restaurants.  The staff is exceptional.  Everyone was very accommodating to any of our needs.  This is a very special place and I highly recommend it!,5,2024,10,02
19,Stay was Fantastic!,"We landed in Barcelona and spent 4 nights.  Amazing city but this hotel, Claris Hotel, made it even more amazing.   I have traveled a lot but not sure I have ever met a more friendly and attentive staff.   We were not in the room/hotel much but every staff member that we interacted with was truly awesome.  

And of course the facilities were excellent…just the staff…what an excellent group at that hotel.",5,2024,10,01
19,Hotel Claris Barcelona/Home,"This is not my first time at Hotel Claris Barcelona. More important than the excellent welcome and service of the hotel staff, what is amazing is the consistency.
Perfectly located close to the city attractions the hotel remains a calm and chill place. 
The rooftop bar is where I conclude the day with a cava and a cigar…",5,2024,09,28
19,"Amazing staff, truly great customer service","Amazing hotel, impeccable, nicest staff. We stayed here for 1 impromptu night due to our flight home being cancelled. This hotel made all the rough travel and delays feel like a non issue. We were greeted with champagne and incredible service.",5,2024,09,26
19,"Claris Hotel, Barcelona.","I love the hotel. everything went smoothly and the staff was unbelievably kind. Especially Cornejo & Sammy. they would do everything in their power to provide you with a pleasant stay. An issue I had was with the hotel manager. He isnt very helpful. We had a situation with our luggage and needed assistance, he said his hotel staff is not responsible for assisting us carrying the luggage…which is something ive never heard before in a 5-star hotel.",5,2024,09,26
19,Not a true 5 star experience,"First, was only able to check in 30 mins early despite there being many early checkouts. While this is obviously not a guarantee, most 5 star luxury hotels would accommodate an earlier checkin. At a minimum, the proper expectation should have been set. Instead, they told us we would get a room soon after checkouts began to happen only for us to see a bunch of early checkouts and no update. Second, there is an overpowering fragrance throughout the entire property. It is a very strong perfume that almost leads me to believe they might be trying to mask another odor. It is everywhere from the lobby to the room. Lastly, the room and bedding is extremely small and uncomfortable. Not a typical 5 star experience that I have had at other Small Luxury Hotels anywhere in the world. While the location is perfect, this property is more like 3 or maybe 4 star hotel. ",3,2024,09,25
19,Exceptional service,Cornejo the bell hop and Jesús the concierge were just amazing to individuals. In fact the entire staff made our stay so pleasant. Treat us as if we were 5 star patrons. From common courtesy to using exceptional manners helping women first with luggage and doors. Was an amazing stay.,5,2024,09,21
19,Disappointing stay!,"I stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway with my mother, expecting a luxurious experience. Unfortunately, our stay fell short of expectations.

Upon arrival, we received an upgrade, but the room's dismal lighting and wall-facing view were immediate letdowns. For a 5-star hotel, paying top dollar to face a wall, unsure of day or night, was underwhelming.

The room's condition was subpar: stained couch, scratched table, chipped dresser housing the coffee machine and minibar. Thin walls allowed noise from neighboring rooms to seep in, disrupting our peace.

Given these issues, we cut our stay short and checked out after one night. I advise others to seek a hotel that truly justifies its price. This one fell far short of 5-star standards.",1,2024,09,19
19,Claris Hotel in Barcelona is an ABSOLUTE 10 plus,"Such a wonderful hotel.  The staff and door service were spectacular, taking care of our every need.  The food in the dining room for breakfast was cooked to order and everything was delicious.  The hotel is appointed with amazing art work and is so clean and fresh.  Also, a very great location near Las Ramblas.",5,2024,09,19
19,Great intimate quiet arty hotel in the middle of all the action in Barcelona centre,"I enjoyed my stay in the Claris, the staff were excellent (especially the breakfast people), hotel was very clean, comfortable and stylish on the inside, fabulous Japanese atrium viewed from glass backed lifts and lovely roof top bar and restaurant which was quite reasonable cost wise. 
Few minor points like no tissues in the bathroom or desk chair in the bedroom but all in all a fine place to stay.",4,2024,09,18
19,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Stayed 5 nights. Great service! Amazing staff, beautiful building and great location. They really do care.
Amazing breakfast and allowed me to take breakfast to go too if I’d like! Thank you! I would def recommend to friends and family and would stay again!",5,2024,09,18
19,"Unique rooms, GREAT staff!","Beautiful European hotel in the center of everything! All of the staff were very accommodating, meeting every need we had promptly and always with a smile. Very unique and worth a stay! By the way, very upscale shopping one short block away.",5,2024,09,14
19,Hotel Claris,Very Nice. Everyone was awesome. It was our first time in Barcelona. We were very pleased with the hotel and the service. We are definitely going to return for a longer stay.,4,2024,09,12
19,Bst of the best.,"We have stayed in 2 other nice hotels in Barcelona but I have to say this was one of the Best hotel for service, friendliness and attention to detail we have stayed in around the world.
    From time of getting out of our cab till we got up to our room, the staff was First Class. They are now be our go to Hotel in Barcelona and we give them 5 stars.

Other pluses were :
     - Nice pool and restaurant on the roof (one of 3).
     - Very nicely appointed room with artwork and sculptures. 
     - The Breakfast restaurant was nicely decorated with nice spacing of tables and enough offerings for even my wife who is Gluten free.
     - The concierge was also very knowledgeable and gave us a nice Gluten free Pizza and Pasta restaurant for dinner that was a 15 minute walk for the Hotel.

19,Loveliest stay,"All the staff were so kind and attentive and it made our holiday even better, being in such a lovely hotel. Cornejo in particular was amazing and was very helpful and provided a great service, always with a smile! The reception team were so helpful too, particularly when we needed help with making restaurant reservations.",5,2024,08,31
19,Great stay in Barca,"The staff was FANTASTIC!  Rooms were big. Perfect location. Couldn’t recommend more. I liked that the hotel was one street over from the main shopping district, so you are right in the action but still get a more local neighborhood feel. Egyptian decor is a little odd, but not a big deal lol. Roof and pool was a great way to start and end the day.",5,2024,08,31
19,"Exceptional service, cleanliness, and quality!","The hotel and decor are beautiful, boasting unique historical artifacts, exceptional customer service/reception, cleanliness, beautifully appointed room, and wonderful breakfast! This was one of our favorite hotel experiences ever! ",5,2024,08,30

19,Amazing stay!,"We had a quick stay in Barcelona for a cruise, we had lunch and breakfast at the rooftop restaurant and both were delicious! The service was impeccable! The concierge service set up private transportation for us for a seamless visit. ",5,2024,08,24
19,The kind and service minded attitude of the staff,"The rooms are very clean and classy, the staff are very professional and kind and the interior design of the hotel is amazing. We will definitely be staying at Clair’s hotel again once re visiting Barcelona.
It’s a very Luxurious hotel situated at a nice location with walking distance to a lot of cafes and restaurants.",5,2024,08,23
19,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"This hotel is stylish, comfortable, clean, friendly and in a great location.  Beds are so comfortable and the welcome from all the staff is genuine and warm.  Special shout out to Oskar who helped us everyday with restaurant recommendations, places to visit, our luggage and taxis - his friendly face every day will be a big part of our memories of this hotel.  Will definitely return - the root top pool is perfect for some sun bathing and chilling out with cocktails in the evening",5,2024,08,22
19,Great value with everything to be expected at a 5 star hotel,Had a great time with Claris - have everything to be expected from a 5 star hotel whilst having a very competetivt price point. Very happy visitor!,5,2024,08,19
19,Hôtel claris - Barcelone 2024,"My husband and I like to stay in 5 star hotels and we thought we would experience the same level of quality and service of a 5* hotel consistent with the price.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with the quality of service and the rooms.  The rooms have no windows and are poorly insulated.  We had to change the room to a smaller room in order to have some light.  Every morning we were woken up by the noise of cleaning ladies in the corridors.  Screams, hubbub and the sound of cleaning tools.  No respect!  We reported this to reception when leaving, the receptionist did not seem to be very receptive.  What we criticize about this hotel is that it does not quite meet the classification of a true 5 star.  we must not forget that the purpose of a hotel is to be able to sleep well.
However, the hotel have a good location near to the centre.",2,2024,08,18
19,What a wonderful hotel with exceptional service!,"What a wonderful hotel! As a very picky person, I must say that this is truly a 5-star hotel. The rooms are clean, and the service is amazing, from the front desk staff to the breakfast service - it's unbelievable! They are so kind and extremely accommodating. We've visited three countries before coming to Barcelona, Spain, and this hotel surpasses all the others we've stayed at so far. When I return to Spain, I will definitely return to this hotel! Jimmy, Ashraf, Alvin, and all the wonderful staff at breakfast provide exceptional, white-glove service. Thank you!",5,2024,08,17
19,5 star????,"I wish I could say we had a great stay at the Claris, but it was kind of an international travelers nightmare. 

The WiFi didn’t work in our room — at all. The coffee machine was broken, and they “fixed it” but for the 3 days there never gave us coffee to use after using our pods to “fix”. 

The walls were so thin that we had even taken a video because we couldn’t believe there wasn’t a door open or window. Not super comfortable to sleep and recover from jet lag. 

The amenities weren’t explained, the staff was rather rude, and the beds were so hard. I actually found them ok, but my partner was unable to sleep well. 

Our door wouldn’t automatically close when we entered the room, so many times we found the door was literally open and we had to slam it. 

The pool view was lovely, but there are 6 chaise loungers for a pretty large hotel. 

The staff at the pool were lovely, and I thought “maybe this will redeem it!” But no, the drinks were undrinkable (and we don’t discriminate when it comes to drinking really ha). 

Overall, the location was fantastic and the views great, but the stay was so uncomfortable that we got late check out and ended up leaving EARLY because the noise was so loud we couldn’t sleep anyway. Would rather be zombies walking around while they had our bags vs try and get any rest and have no wifi or service. ",1,2024,08,16
19,Great,"Very good location 
Chic hotel grest service staff were very kind welcoming and helpful with everything I needed 
There is a beautiful roof top with a restaurant and bar . In my opinion it lacks atmosphere 
",5,2024,08,08
19,How can it be so luxurious and so welcoming at the same time?,"I wish I could leave more than 5 stars!! Such a welcoming, thoughtful, and luxurious hotel!! The smell is incredible - Claris, please box that stuff up!! The staff was SO KIND, especially precious Eddie at the front desk. We also met housekeeping staff that were such lovely people. We DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE!!",5,2024,08,06
19,The perfect hotel in Barcelona,Such a great hotel. The most friendly staf. We loved everything. Beautiful rooms. The food (breakfast and restaurant) very good. ,5,2024,08,05
19,Great Experience!!,"Truly enjoyed our stay here! The rooms were kept clean and restocked. The decor is definitely different but cleanliness is what’s important to us and we had no complaints there. The staff was very friendly and attentive to any requests. Our stay was only 3 nights and we wish it was longer! Our first night we didn’t have a dinner plan so we asked the front desk for a recommendation and they made a reservation for us at a lovely local restaurant that we really enjoyed! 
Our days were packed full of things to do in Barcelona so my only regret is not having time to visit the spa and Japanese restaurant! Would definitely recommend this hotel to others and if we ever make our way back to Barcelona we will definitely be coming back!",5,2024,07,29
19,"Nice, but so noisy. Impossible to handle","The hotel itself is nice, the service and the breakfast are indeed 5 stars.
The key problem is the noise in the rooms. The walls must be made of paper as you can hear every word from your neighbour's.
A quiet relaxing 5 star vacation is not possible. What a shame.",2,2024,07,22
19,my stay at Claris Barcelona,"excellent hotel, in the center of Barcelona, excellent service and staff. my best wishes to the staff. excellent sumptuous breakfast and room service.",5,2024,07,16

Breakfast very good also. Special thanks to Jimmy , the Maitre, who is adorable and made  our breakfast great !
All the staff are adorable ! 
For sure I will return to Claris in my next travel to Barcelona .",5,2024,07,08
19,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this 5 stars hotel. The room wasn't what I expected, with a weird decoration, with to many elements, the internet failed twice in 30 min while working and the breakfast is very poor, almost nothing in the buffet and everything must be requested to the staff a la carte, like you may ask for some type of bread because there's only one type in the buffet. Besided this, the cleaning was excelent as well the staff that were always very kind during the days I were there. The restaurant La Terraza is great, with great food and a great view.",3,2024,07,05
19,Perfect for us,"The service from all the staff has really really made our trip to Barcelona special.

Perfect location for us. The rooftop was amazing within the city to chill and unwind.

Will be back for sure! We have plenty of exploring left to do in Barcelona",5,2024,07,01
19,Luxury experience!,"We stayed from Sunday to Thursday in a grand suite duplex. Room was spectacular! Bed was comfy, lounge area was spotless, silique and had an array of beautiful art and sculptures. Roof terrace is a great area for drinks and food. Staff couldn’t have made us feel more comfortable and special for the duration of our stay. Would recommend to anyone looking for some luxury! My only regret is not having time to eat at the Japanese restaurant.",5,2024,06,21
19,Best hotel in Barcelona,"This was my second stay here. My previous stay was in 2022 for 5 days post cruise. Because of that experience i booked the hotel for 2 day stay pre cruise. I will continue to stay here for future visits and will continue to recommend Hotel Claris to anyone i know that will be traveling to Barcelona. You get a welcome glass of Cava as you check in. The hotel is beautify and always clean. Many of the staff were the same this time as 2 years ago so its also nice to see familiar faces and likely the hotel is treating their staff well. I love the turn down service at night and the chocolates left on the pillows. You dont get this kind of service at most hotels ive stayed at. Got a free bottle of Cava on my wife's birthday which we had no idea they did. The breakfast is the best ive had at any hotel stay. Make sure you pay for the breakfast. Lots of fresh fruit, cold cuts, and pastries. Mimosas if you want, and they have a chef cook eggs/bacon etc to order. Great location as well. You can walk to most site seeing locations in 20 minutes or less. If walking isnt your thing, there is a bus stop right across the street for further destinations. One block away from the Fashion shopping street(Pg. de Gràcia) 25 mintue cab ride to/from airport with traffic, 15 minute taxi ride to cruise port.",5,2024,06,17
19,Best hotel ever,This hotel is truly wonderful. The staff are superb. The location is fantastic. Best hotel ever. The doormen go above and beyond. The ambience begins as soon as you step inside. Absolutely love Barcelona and this hotel. We will definitely stay longer next visit.,5,2024,06,15
19,Nothing short of Amazing!!!,"After a dreadful 14 hour flight we were tired and cranky when arriving to Barcelona.
It was so nice to check in and room was ready. Front desk was so nice and friendly.
Offering glass of cava and lobby was so pretty. Room was very nice complete with
mini fridge. We slept very well with little to zero noise from neighbors. Location is 
outstanding. Tours found hotel easy for pick up and we walked with ease to other
places like Sagrada Familia and Casa Ballto. Don't forget to try rooftop bar it was 
fantastic.  Keep up the good work Hotel Claris. We will be back and next time stay
much longer!",5,2024,06,07
19,Great hotel in great location,"Upsides - fabulous hotel in a great location, and plenty of room for 3 in our duplex. Downsides - expensive drinks prices at the bar, and our room was noisy but it was on the second floor at the front overlooking the road.  ",4,2024,06,03
19,Great Hotel ,The hotel is in a great location.  Outstanding service was provided.  The staff was charming and helpful.  A very comfortable room with a sitting area.

19,Beautiful Hotel in a great location,"This hotel is beautiful and in a great location. The entrance and reception area is stunning. The art and stylish layout is very classy and the water feature gives a beautiful ambience after travelling. We stayed in a Duplex Suite and I couldn't fault one thing. It was spotless and the room had everything you could possibly need. Again very stylish and the bed was super comfy. The living area was beautifully decorated with more attractive pieces of art that complemented old with new and the sofa was huge. Added room bonus coffee machine with pods, clothes steamer, free minibar and robes and slippers. I've travelled to Barcelona a few times now but the Claris is by far one the best hotels I've stayed at. The rooftop part of the hotel was my favourite part of the hotel. We were lucky enough to have a really hot day and thoroughly enjoyed the pool and bar area. The cocktails were lovely and the food at the restaurant was so tasty. Breakfast was served in the lower restaurant and the service from the staff and choice of food was amazing. Something available for everyone even if you were a fussy eater.
What makes this hotel special is without a doubt the staff. From the reception, bar, restaurant, doormen and domestic staff. Every member of staff I encountered was so happy and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I have to make a special mention about  Carina from reception especially who is a credit to your company. Her lovely friendly and helpful manner made us feel so relaxed and welcomed and she went above and beyond to help in any way she could. She gave us lots of tips and valuable information on where to visit and the best ways to get there. Her caring nature certainly showed us that her clients receive 5-star top-class treatment. Well done on recruiting such a lovely member of staff.",5,2024,05,24
19,Will stay here on our next trip to Barcelona,"The hotel personnel is well trained, they fully understand the meaning of a five star hotel. They were very helpful (recommendations, service etc) and certainly made our trip a pleasing one. Location is an asset, right next to Paseo de Gracia and Rambla Catalunya but not close to noisy streets. Will definitely stay again.",5,2024,05,20
19,5 Nights in Hotel Claris,"The hotel was very nice. The restaurant on the top floor was one of the best restaurants that we ate at during our 5 night stay. HOWEVER, the bed was too HARD. We did not have one good nights sleep.",3,2024,05,19
19,"Great Hotel, Nice Staff","Lovely hotel in a convenient location.  The room was classy and comfortable.  The front desk staff was very helpful and respectful.  They recommended a nearby restaurant and assisted with a reservation.   The doormen made us feel welcome and assisted with taxis.  I cannot say enough about the beautiful breakfast room (with red roses), the delicious breakfast served, and the staff.  I witnessed them assist an elderly lady who was struggling due to some mobility issues; they were kind, and it was heartwarming to see the care they provided for their guests.  A wonderful stay overall.   ",5,2024,05,19
19,Highly recommend hotel and Spa,"Lovely hotel and we had a beautiful room. The staff were helpful and friendly. It is in a great location with easy access to local attractions. We also visited the Spa and it was excellent would definitely recommend a visit.
We enjoyed the rooftop bar and drinks were lovely. We didn't eat in the hotel but only due to eating out on various trips.",5,2024,05,19
19,Barcelona city break,From first stepping out of our taxis rhe doorman helped us to reception checking in was first class even though we arrived early our luggage arrived with the porter who explained everything in the room he was fantastic answered any questions the room was more than we expected and the bed was to die for. The hotel has luxury throughout the building and the roof terrace with the pool is like the icing on the cake nothing is too much trouble food at breakfast is everything you want cooked how you like.The hotel is right in the center ideally placed for shops bars and resterants and when you go out the doorman and the porter allways ask if you need directions or recomendations and all done with a smile cant wait to come back and thankyou to the porter who helped sort out the problems with our transfer to the airport,5,2024,05,17
19,Just what we needed.,Just what we needed. We could walk to shopping and restaurants from the hotel. They had a reasonable rate taxi to us in under a minute. ,5,2024,05,15

19,Brilliantly luxurious Hotel,"Very clean, very well dressed hotel with a great level of luxury. Lovely plants everywhere, water features and interesting statues. The bedroom was fabulous and the roof terrace was the icing on the cake.
The staff were very attentive and extremely friendly. The breakfast was superb, with Cava being offered as well as a la carte all being part of the price.
Can’t recommend enough.",5,2024,05,08
19,Good location but quirky,"Nice hotel in a great location, close to lots of sites, restaurants etc. Our room was spacious but it did not have much of a window so was very very dark. They were doing construction and it was very loud throughout the day and into the evening. They only gave us 2 espresso pods for four night and charged 3 euro for another pod so they did not really offer coffee which was super weird. Otherwise, nice hotel with good service. The rooftop pool looked nice but it rained most of our stay. Decent price for the size of our room.",4,2024,05,04
19,Princess Cruises - Cruisers Hotel,"Princess Cruises brought us here! My husband and I, and 5 other friends stayed here for a few days before our Grand Meditteranean cruise. Location was great. Clean room and friendly staff although check-in was a bit of a nightmare. We didn't mind waiting as we were early, the problem was, it's past check in time, after waiting for 3 hours and our room wasn't ready. My husband was so close into throwing a fit, also very tired from a 15 hour flight, when the Front Desk agent gave us an excuse that  the room was under my name and has been ready since noon. It didn't make sense because we have the same last name, and second, both of our names were registered as guests. Our experience with the hotel service got better the next day when we requested if we can take our complimentary breakfast with us for a whole day trip in France. Kudos to the Kitchen and the early morning Front Desk agent and Valet! I didn't get the Front Desk agent's name but he saved us from pick pockets while waiting for Valet to bring our rental car around 6am.",4,2024,05,01
19,"Excellent service and attention from all staff, fabulous breakfast and great location","From the moment we approached the hotel doors we were warmly greeted, our bags swept away and glasses of bubbly placed in our hands. Although we arrived early our room was mostly ready so we were able to use. We booked a Junior suite which was spacious enough to comfortably accommodate our daughter in her own separate space. The beds were very comfortable and room kept very clean. The mini fridge was promptly replenished daily with complimentary water, juices, beers and sodas. The breakfast was scrumptious with an extensive selection of eggs/pastries/cold cuts/breads/fruits/cereals/juices/wine/tea/coffee etc. The location was within walking distance to some attractions and shopping but also allowed for easy access to public transport when needed. This was one of the best hotel experience and value.",5,2024,04,29
19,Perfect stay in the heart of Barcelona,Everything was perfect. Attention to the smallest details. Very nice and helpful staff. Best ever: the quality of the bed and the pillows.,5,2024,04,28

19,Just perfect,"Went there for 4 night for my wives birthday. Everything was perfect. Spacious room, excellent VIP breakfast on the terrace that made us feel like royals and to top it off a bottle of Cava was waiting for us in the room on her birthday.",5,2024,04,23
19,Great job Team Claris,"Awesome team at the Claris hotel and spa. Overall great experience. From the door men, reception, restaurant staff to cleaners.

",5,2024,04,22
19,Renovations may be disruptive.,"They are renovating. If you happen to get a room next to a room getting new tile put in either plan your time in your room around the workers schedule or wear some nice headphones.
We were in a nice slightly larger interior newly renovated room. My wife needed to work and I was hoping for a nap. The desk staff were great. They didn’t hesitate to relocate us. Quick and easy move. It was a downgrade to a smaller street side not yet updated room. But available & quiet! Well quiet until lunch was over. Then the pounding and hammering started. Still the noise level was better than the other room until the tile saw started up!  High pitched whine of a tile saw is hard to overcome. No siesta for me. Luckily my wife didn’t have a live meeting that afternoon.
The breakfast service was interesting. The lead or head waiter clearly didn’t want the other staff to take orders. But though he was willing to stop them from taking orders he was not good at taking them himself. It was entertaining to watch person after person have to ask a second time for items.
I got my cappuccino on my third order and that only because I bypassed him. The food was good but nothing special. Good service can make okay food so much better. The other clearing/bussing staff appeared very good at their jobs.
It may have just been a bad day.
We will see how tomorrow morning goes!
I would still highly recommend this hotel as it is beautifully designed and has an incredible location.",3,2024,04,17
19,Location and staff are top notch.,"Great location, welcoming helpful staff, excellent breakfast. Being in the Eixample is a convenient home base. The rooms facing the interior have plenty of light and are much quieter than those facing the street. You are welcomed and helped throughout your stay by the front staff: Alex is particularly helpful",5,2024,04,16
19,An oasis in a gorgeous city,"This hotel is amazing, from the warm welcome by the front desk team to a drink while you check in. Eddie checked us in and was very knowledgeable about the city and all the places to stop by.  Although our room did not have a view of the city, it was lovely.  I found my happy place in the jetted bathtub, and this hotel pays attention to the details and provides bath salts for your bubble bath concert moment. We were given dinner recommendations by the front desk team in the evening, and 9reinas almost brought tears to my eyes about how good the food was. The breakfast team were so welcoming and made sure everyone was well looked after, and the breakfast was incredibly yummy. If you are staying in this hotel, do not miss an opportunity to use the spa. Anais has gifted hands, and I felt floating on cloud nine after my secret massage. The Mayan Suana was a treat, and I enjoyed the chromotherapy shower, which was a unique experience.",5,2024,04,08
19,Wonderfully friendly and attentive staff at a very nice well-positioned hotel.,"Wonderfully friendly and attentive staff. On arrival we were offered a couple of glasses of Cava, which was very nice. Our bed was made up twice on one day, and there appears to be a turndown service in the evening with a chocolate. Complimentary minibar with cokes, a couple of beers and some water. The room and ensuite were kept very clean. Excellent position for all the main tourist locations and public transport. On my partner's birthday we arrived back after a long day to find a complimentary bottle of cava in the room.

We are light sleepers, and I'm pleased to report the hotel is very quiet during the night, and we slept well.

The room safe is large enough to take a 17"" laptop and easily supports multiple iPads, phones etc.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends visiting Barcelona. Well done and thank you to the team for a memorable stay.",5,2024,04,08
19,Fabulous hotel!,"The location in Eixample is very convenient for visiting Casa Mila & Casa Batllo.  The hotel’s owner has an extensive collection of Egyptian art as well as a museum nearby the hotel ( free for hotel guests).
All of the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful.  I was traveling with my grandchild and both of us loved the hotel.  We felt very safe in this area. I highly recommend staying here if you go to Barcelona.",5,2024,04,07
19,Nice hotel,"Was a fair stay but expected a bit more space for having upgraded to a junior suite. Bathroom was cramped and a step down was dangerous.

Breakfast didn't taste of anything and coffee was poor/weak for having spent so much money.",4,2024,04,01
19,Great hotel - would recommend!,"Great hotel ! Nice room, rooftop bar and a good location. The breakfast was good with plenty of choice and all hot food made to order.

19,Happy to be back!,"Second visit to the Claris did not miss our expectations! Lovely staff, especially at the front desk, they are true masters of hospitality. Lovely smiles everytime we got back. We choose to upgrade into a two floors suite this time and we cannot be happier. Rooftop Bar staff not as welcoming as the rest of staff but cocktails are worth a visit! Can't wait to be back in late summer!",5,2024,03,25
19,Excellent stay,Great service and stay.  Room was clean and well maintained.  Excellent breakfast included.  Complimentary mini fridge drinks and large bottle of water provided daily.  Nice rooftop bar.  Helpful in arranging transportation and recommended an excellent restaurant nearby,5,2024,03,11
19,Awesome hospitality,"I stayed here for my business trip. Unfortunately, I had the high fever during the trip and couldn't wake up for a wholde day. The staffs of this hotel were very kind and supported me to get helathy foods and plenty bottles of drinks. This was awesome experience.",5,2024,03,09

19,Super Location,"This location and the entire staff were100% Totally Professional. and although we went with two couples and no two rooms were the same, my only complaint would be that the Bed in room 411 were smaller than the Beds in the other 2 couples rooms that were in our small group. but Over all still Excellent and I would recommend and also re book this Hotel on my/our next visit. ",5,2024,02,23
19,"Nice, modern but without sunlight.","Great design, perfect location, sexy rooms, but unfortunately there is no sunlight, which is something you have to be prepared for in rooms of a lower standard. Definitely great for couples. Excellent drinks in the restaurant on the terrace, it's a pity that the pool is not heated in the cold season.",4,2024,02,19
19,I would recommend this hotel,Nice room-clean-great rooftop with small pool. very friendly and helpfull staff all over the hotel.it is not in the middle of the center but the hotel is based at an excellent spot to go to all the different visiting sites of barcelona..nice restaurants around the hotel,5,2024,02,15

19,Hotel Claris,"This is a fantastic property that is great value.  The staff are exemplary. Our suite was spectacular.  We ate at the Japanese restaurant twice, it was delicious. George and Mariano at the entrance are worth their weight in gold.We didn’t want to go.",5,2024,02,11
19,Great place with good service  - but some noise from the street,"Great place - but could do with better noise insulation for the windows facing the street. Stayed on the 5th floor, room facing Carrer de Pau Claris on a weekend. Some good points:
- Great staff, service minded 
- Nice breakfast, and likewise the staff here was very attentive (was there at 8 am in morning a weekend, quite few guests around then)
- Good location

Would have rated it a 5 / 5 if it was not for the poor noise insulation of the windows (noise from the street).",4,2024,02,11

19,"Well-placed, friendly and comfortable.","From its elegantly low-key entrance to the spacious and comfortable room, the Claris was a totally positive experience.  The staff were invariably as courteous and friendly as one could wish.  And the location is perfect, a short walk from La Pedreira.",5,2024,01,20
19,Beautiful hotel with AMAZING staff,"Wonderful! While the hotel is absolutely beautiful, what separates this hotel from all others is the AMAZING staff. I have never felt so important! Every time I turned around there was a happy staff member there to greet me and offer their help. They genuinely want to make sure that you have the best experience possible. Oh, and don’t get me started on their delicious breakfast! The best I’ve ever had!",5,2024,01,19
19,The perfect place from which explore Barcelona,"Lovely hotel and staff. Breakfast was enjoyable and had a good selection of goods. Received excellent recommendations for food from the Front Desk, always with a smile on their faces. Your service is out of the ordinary! 
We will definitely stay here again!
Muchas gracias por todo!",5,2024,01,11
19,We felt spoiled!,"This is a great hotel! We felt welcoming from the first time we entered the doors of the hotel. We were very spoiled by Jimmy at the restaurant. We felt he was a father to us that was taking care of us. Jimmy was very caring, welcoming and cheerful. It was a happiness to see him every time we entered the restaurant. The hotel had a great decorated environment and eye-captivating decorations. A fresh smelling bedroom and lobby.",5,2024,01,10
19,Great stay at Barcelona,"Fantástic Hotel …..everything 
I think is the best in Barcelona…Location,rooms …..superb breakfast ….
The unique staff Paula, Valeria y Fernando….I would like to stay  here for a long time .This time I’ll stay for 5 nights.",5,2024,01,08
19,Ferran the man!!,"Ferran is a credit to the hotel. We experienced many problems during our 5 day stay in Barcelona which were nothing to do with the hotel. But Ferran went out of his way to help us find solutions to our issues. 

The hotel itself.oozes elegance and ambiance and is in a great spot.to explore Barcelona. 

I look forward to going again  in the future and hopefully see Ferran",5,2023,12,26
19,Excellent Stay,This was a lovely hotel in a good location. We stayed here in December 2023 and would certainly stay again. The rooms and hotel were clean and tidy with good facilities. The staff were friendly and helpful.,5,2023,12,20
19,Incredible hotel,"The hotel was very luxurious and luminous. I had an excellent time, I would recommend it.
The rooftop offer a fantastic view, the sauna in the gym is wonderful. But the thing I will remember the most is the quality of the service on the breakfast. The waiters are so nice and give personalized care !",5,2023,12,17
19,Visit to Barcelona,"I booked this hotel because it is a Hyatt property. I used points and when we checked in, they offered a fantastic upgrade for a reasonable price. Very nice room which was very comfortable. They provided a complementary bottle of Champaigne as well. ",5,2023,12,13
19,Perfectly meets expectations,"The location is excellent. The rooms are roomy and neat. I resided in a junior suite and it had a whirlpool bathtub, intelligent television and a sturdy bed which is extremely cozy. The internet speed is satisfactory. You have the option to park your vehicle directly in the hotel's garage or the one situated just behind the hotel which is less expensive. The absence of a picturesque view is because the hotel is located within the city. The rooftop bar provides an amazing experience with a lovely outdoor pool. The breakfast is plentiful and delicious. I highly suggest using the spa. Even though the gym is small, it serves its purpose. All staff members are quite friendly and supportive. Overall, I would rate it with 5 stars. It provides the greatest value for the price and perfectly meets one's expectations.",5,2023,12,13
19,Best property in Barcelona,"Very close to city center, best rooms in town.

19,Best property ever!!!,"The property is beautiful and the location is great! The staff was amazing and very kind and helpful.

There is an amazing spa offering many various options for facials, massage and more. I highly recommend this property!!",5,2023,12,11
19,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS,"Such an amazing staff. Clean, excellent food, great ambiance. The hotel goes above and beyond to make you feel special and welcome. This hotel has a particular eye for art and culture, with a private gallery in the hotel itself. 11/10 stars",5,2023,12,08
19,Lovely place,"This was my 4th stay at the Claris. The location is very convenient and the front desk staff is excellent. I have always had a duplex room, they give separation and are good for longer stays. The bathtubs are a little deep so if you have trouble getting out of tubs this might not be the place for you. ",4,2023,12,08
19,Ideal hotel in central Barcelona,"This was my second stay at the Claris.
Ideal for visiting everything on foot, I highly recommend it for its warm welcome. Many thanks to the friendly, attentive staff. 
The bedding is perfect.

The room seemed small for a suite as it was a duplex and we didn't make much use of the floor. In the end, I had the same feeling as in a classic room. ",4,2023,12,05
19,Short Mother Daughter trip to Barcelona,"The Hotel Claris was ideally located one block from the main strip and a short 20-25 minute walk to main attractions like the Gothic Quarters and Sagrada Familia. We had an Executive Room that had a small sitting area that was perfect for my mom and I to sit and watch TV together in the evenings. The staff was super friendly and the rooms were clean. Also a nice surprise for the ladies, they had flat iron in addition to a hair dryer.",5,2023,12,03
19,Outstanding in every way,"We have chosen the Claris for our November escape in Barcelona, the Hotel is a real hidden gem in the city center. Great decor and attention to details. What really makes the experience though is the Staff. Doorman and reception were on top of their game, always eager to go the extra mile to make your day! Management must be proud of them! Breakfast is delicious although not a huge buffet, but plenty of options for every taste. Room was excellent and stylish. We will definitelly be back!",5,2023,12,02
19,If I had a house in Barcelona it would be this comfortable,everything is perfect.  The staff works super.  The hotel decor and room are very nice.  The breakfast is incredibly enjoyable and delicious.  The terrace bar is very nice.The location of the hotel is excellent.  thank you for everything,5,2023,11,30
19,Hidden Gem,"I was a little nervous booking this hotel as the pictures did not do it justice.  This hotel not only met my expectations but exceeded them.  The hotel is located one block off the famous shopping avenue (which has all the high end store).  The hotel alone is gorgeous.  It has it's own art gallery which you can walk through and affiliated with the Egyptian art gallery down the road.  The staff was simply so professional, and I love being greeted by a class of  champagne.  The hotel offers breakfast (which is included). The really pay attention to all details.  I would definitely go back to this hotel, and highly encourage others to stay here if they are in Barcelona.  ",5,2023,11,29
19,Value for money,"The hotel is right outside big branded shops and very convenient if you are only staying for short period and enjoy shopping. Roof top restaurant is great with best views. All staff from reception, concierge were friendly and helpful. ",5,2023,11,28
19,Solo cruise,Did a 1 night stay for a Mediterranean cruise out of Barcelona. This hotel was fabulous. Upon arrival they had a bottle of champagne. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and they arranged a taxi to the cruise port the next morning. Every was perfect and I would definitely stay again in the future. The room was a perfect size and the bed was extremely comfortable.,5,2023,11,25
19,Not a 5 star hotel as advertised,"We stayed for 4 nights. Customer service overall was a hit and miss. Hotel decor was dated and room lighting was dark. Breakfast was decent. Location was nearby attractions, shopping and convenient to metro. ",3,2023,11,20
19,Elegant and stylish stay in Barcelona!,"It was our first visit to the Claris and we couldn't have chosen better for our stay in Barcelona! Lovely hotel with a 5 star service. Reception and concierge were the cherry on top of our stay, they were so professional, polite with a true elegant touch! Alesio has been a great hotel manager and host. Complementary boubbles in the room and a marvelous breakfast made the rest! We were offered to upgrade our room for a small extra and it was totally worth it! Can't wait to be back next year! Kudos",5,2023,11,18
19,A wonderful gem in the city center,"Excellent hotel in one of the best city location. Service was just outstanding, from the door reception until the rooftop service. Rooms are not huge but stylish and unique. We felt like a true five star service has been delivered constantly. We will be back!",5,2023,11,18
19,Congratulation to the Management!,"I have been visiting Barcelona few times with my wife and the Claris is without any doubt the best 5 star choice we had in town. Their service is top notch, especially the Front Desk. I have never seen another service at this level in terms of availability, kindness and elegance! We will be back next year and we already know where to stay! Congratulation on the management for such a great staff!

P.s. Make sure to upgrade your room into a Duplex Room, you will love it!",5,2023,11,14
19,Wonderful Stay,"The location was wonderful, and the amenities were perfect for our short stay in Barcelona. The staff was very nice and helpful. Had a great experience. It was clean, comfortable and convenient. Everything we wanted to do was walking distance and staff was helpful when we needed a taxi.",5,2023,11,14
19,Exceptional,"The experience at the Claris hotel it’s always great. I keep coming back to this hotel every time I am in Barcelona and this is because the atmosphere is warm, the rooms are incredible and the service it’s impeccable. Thank you Claris for always welcome me in such a pleasant way.
",5,2023,11,12
19,We had a very good time,We found a very good staff and services. The hotel is near the metro and the rambla and casa batllo Gaudi. We are italians and all the receptionist speak italian. We had a very good time and we think we will come back.,5,2023,11,12
19,Beautuiful Hotel,"I would highly rate this hotel it is a beautiful building and rooms. The staff here make you so welcome. Lovely terrace bar area and superb breakfast. Close to all the local areas, restaurants and metro station.",5,2023,11,06

19,Perfect stay in Barcelona!,"Travelled with my 2 sons 7 and 10 and this place was perfect. Rooms were spacious and very well equipped . The jacuzzi bath went down a treat. The staff couldn’t help us enough and everyone was so pleasant from the cleaning staff to the concierge. The free mini bar was a bonus and was a nice touch after a day of exploring Barcelona. The location is great and taxis were really easy to get straight outside the door. The pool terrace is beautiful and my two boys even got in a swim in early November although it was a little cold. 

We loved our stay at the Claris and it was our first time in Barcelona. It’s our new favourite European city but this was helped by the wonderful stay we had in this hotel. We we’ll definitely be back in the future when the Camp Nou is completed hopefully in the summer to make the best of the roof top pool. 

Thanks for a lovely weekend!",5,2023,11,05
19,Great Great Hotel,"if you are ever in Barcelona, you’ve got to stay at the Hotel Claris. You must also have dinner at the rooftop restaurant and breakfast as well. It’s well worth it. Our stay was exquisite. a great, romantic hotel. Thank you",5,2023,11,04
19,Beautiful hotel - Only wish could’ve stayed longer ,"Fantastic experience. All staff go above and beyond. Superb food - highly recommend if visiting Barcelona and the sights, perfect location a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of main tourist areas. Would love to return. ",5,2023,10,31
19,What a wonderful service!,"Our third visit to the Claris did not disappoint. Loved every aspect of it as usually, but above all the Front Desk service! Helpful, kind and curteous in every way, the reception team goes beyond every request with a smile, congratulation to the Management for this amazing staff! Make sure you don’t miss the Breakfast either!",5,2023,10,31
19,They Made It Better,"Soooo- everything that went wrong in the beginning of the trip was corrected by the second day. Without boring you —- I would say- emailing in advance for an early check in with an elderly mom won’t work! DO Specify you want a room with a window (!!!!), and then again, with an exterior window, not of an interior lobby, and if you have an elderly person- get a walk-in shower not a tub shower. 

Little drama- BUT ultimately a fabulous experience! Thank you to the Manager for making it right- the true sign of a good hotel, and  for a more suitable room and  the lovely bottle of cava. We loved the cool Mayan museum and free tickets to the awesome Egyptian Museum across the street. Barcelona is a wonderland - but ending every single evening on the BEAUTIFUL rooftop bar and pool was pure heaven! 

And the breakfast - well we never actually got to lunch because of the true old-world elegant breakfast. 

EH and my",5,2023,10,19
19,Superb Hotel,"Great Hotel with a perfect
Location. All the staff are so friendly and helpful. We had a junior suite and it was really nice and comfortable with modern style. Breakfast area is so relaxing and the staff cant do enough for you. Rooftop bar and pool area is a really lovely place to have a drink. When we go back to Barcelona we will definitely stay here again.",5,2023,10,19
19,Weekend break,Late anniversary trip. The hotel was fabulous. Staff were so attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We are already planning our next visit. The small museum was a welcome surprise and so was the access to the Egyptian museum. Ideally located to all areas we wanted and had planned to visit.,5,2023,10,16
19,Great hotel with a cool rooftop bar,"The rooms are very clean and the personnel is friendly and helps you with every demand.
The rooftop bar with a pool for guests is a good place to relax. Also the hotel has a Spa with many different and relaxing treatments.",5,2023,10,14
19,"Outstanding hotel, should have 10 stars!","The service was top and rooms were clean, comfortable, and beautiful. The breakfast was outstanding, drinks on rooftop terrace as well. Highly recommend, worth the rate. The location is in a great neighborhood, buildings are art nouveau.",5,2023,10,07
19,Great stay in Barcelona,"Claris Hotel was a great place for our first trip to Barcelona. It was within walking distance to most of the major sites, yet out of the hub of the tourist areas. The staff were all so helpful with directions, taxis, restaurant suggestions and more. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",5,2023,10,02
19,Wonderful service,"Great service personnel and superior location for seeing Barcelona. My only criticism is that the bathtubs are difficult to get in and out. They are very deep. If you have any mobility issues, it's a problem.",5,2023,10,01
19,Incredible hotel in a great location!,"Beautiful, unique boutique (although a chain) hotel very close to the collection of Gaudi houses and world class shopping. We walked to most of our sites and felt very safe. A lot of good restaurants around and close to transportation. 
The hotel was beautifully decorated and we received several extras including water, entrance to the Egyptian Museum and The Gaudi Pedrero House. Staff was incredibly nice and professional.  
This hotel earns and deserves it's ratings. When we travel we will now look for Derby/Claris hotels.  ",5,2023,09,30
19,Luxury accomodation,The Claris is very comfortable and centrally located.  The roof top bar has great views and is a lovely spot to relax by the pool. The rooms are well appointed and clean.  The door staff are always friendly and helpful,4,2023,09,27
19,Really high-quality hotel,"The Claris is ideally situated in Barcelona, close to the old town without being stuck in the middle, and close to restaurants and cafes. The hotel itself is the perfect mixture of contemporary and traditional style, our standard room was consistently clean and certainly very comfortable. The staff are without exception warm, friendly, understanding while always being professional. And even if you don't normally take breakfast, make sure that you do here so that you can see the maitre d' (Jimmy) in action. Quiet, unobtrusive but with endless attention to detail he turned a great breakfast into a wonderful performance if you watched him in action.",5,2023,09,27
19,Exceptional Customer Service!,We stayed here for 1 night before we flew home from Barcelona.  Absolutely wonderful staff! Went above and beyond to help us with everything we needed and provide a memorable stay.  They were so friendly.  Great location to walk to attractions in the L'Exiample area of Barcelona.  ,5,2023,09,24
19,Spectacular service and staff! Friendly and helpful! ,"All of the staff were absolutely amazing and accommodating and friendly! The front desk and concierge were spectacular and the dining maître d’ was so fun! He made such an a fabulous experience along with the porters, front desk and concierge! You will truly enjoy your stay here! ",5,2023,09,19
19,We love the Claris,We love this hotel. It’s equally beautiful and comfortable and I actually slept better there than I do at home. We especially adored the rooftop breakfast. It was one of the best ways to feel like you’re in Barcelona and Mario was especially friendly and attentive.,5,2023,09,19
19,Wonderful Stay,We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the hotel Clarence. Without a doubt the best service we experienced throughout our visit to Barcelona. The service of the concierge was very good and it was wonderful to meet Michele again after so many years. The breakfast was a very good experience to start the day. The location of the hotel is superb. We would definitely return to this hotel on a future visit to Barcelona.,5,2023,09,16
19,Warm and Welcoming,"Hotel Claris is everything you'd expect of a 5* hotel: the rooms are luxurious, and location is fantastic - super close to the main shopping boulevards, and the staff make this an exceptional stay. Very welcoming and attentive, nothing was too much trouble. 
Our room - a Junior Suite was divine. So cozy yet spacious. The minibar was restocked daily free of charge - and the bathroom included a hair straightener! [which was great because I forgot mine].
The rooftop pool was a welcome relief from the heat but space is limited as we expected  - so if you're hoping for a 'laze by the pool' hotel - this is not it.
Just a quick stroll and you're on Rambla de Catalunya - and close to some of Gaudi's delights! The hop-on-off bus is right there and a must do to get your bearings. 
Overall an amazing stay - can't fault the hotel!",5,2023,09,11
19,Good overall,"There is much to recommend about this hotel. Great location. Friendly staff (I read reviews saying otherwise, but I never caught a whiff of an unfriendly staff person). And so on. It is an older building, so sometimes you will see some of that reflected in the tiles/walls (which probably should be repainted in the guest rooms). We also found one cockroach in our bathroom on our last night (of five nights total). We had a junior suite that slept three people. One person slept on the pullout sofa, which was so worn the coils were very present. The other two slept in two single beds that were pushed together with separate linens. A minor inconvenience is that we were not offered a welcome drink like the other guests were. Overall, it was fine, and I would stay here again, but I would likely get two separate rooms rather than one bigger suite.",4,2023,09,11
19,Unbelievable place to stay!,"Claris is an amazing place.  The location is wonderful and the room was so nice and clean!
They have great amenities 
The pool is great too!
The service is impeccable.
Breakfast was fantastic and had a great variety to choose from.
I would stay there again!!!

19,Perfect location and place to stay in Barcelona.,"Claris is a fabulous 5* centrally located in Barcelona, with excellent service and a wonderfully relaxing spa. Inside and out their hotel is unique and fabulously appointed.  Your experience seeing the beautiful streets of the city will blend seamlessly with the hotel's excellent juxtapositions of modern and timeless architecture, decor, and furnishings.",5,2023,09,06
19,First Time in Spain,"Great location. Wonderful staff.  The spa is amazing - very unique.  There is a cozy pool on the roof .  Try the VIP breakfast at least once, it was delicious.  The room service was very good and there are so many things to check out walking around the hotel.",5,2023,08,28
19,Great spa treatment and facilities and really nice breakfast,"We arrived from a long haul overnight flight and while the room we booked was not available when we arrived at the hotel at 7AM, they offered us the option to upgrade to a higher category room for +EUR30 which was immediately available.  The room was a junior suite and very spacious, with a large bathroom.  

The hotel staff were helpful and friendly and the check-in and check-out process very quick and efficient.  We had massages at the spa and it was excellent.  The spa staff were lovely and the facilities were spotless.

The hotel itself is very nice, with its own ""mini museum"" inside.   It's in a convenient area, close to shops and restaurants.  It's still an easy walk to the old quarters of Barcelona, or you can take one of the many train options nearby.

Breakfast at the hotel was very good with lots of options, including cava and mimosas.

I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because there was not much natural light in our room at all as it was facing the wall of another building.   Also while I understand hotels in Spain do not usually have an iron and ironing board in the room, they should at least have one onsite that guests can borrow.  There is a handheld steamer in the room which did not work well at all. ",4,2023,08,27
19,Great hotel,"The hotel was fantastic. A friend and I had cycled from London and our bike bags hadn't arrived for the flight the following day. The hotel were extremely helpful and arranged alternative packaging etc.
The hotel was very comfortable. The roof top bar/terrace is beautiful in the evening. Although not on the menu, the staff were able to make Margaritas to order.
A fabulous stay.

19,You won't regret staying  here!,Beautiful hotel and wonderful service. Loved the location and that they went the extra mile helping us celebrating my husband's  50th b-day. Service was well above the usual average. Super clean rooms and very comfortable beds!,5,2023,08,24
19,Fantastic dining,"My visit to the restaurant at Claris Hotel in Barcelona was a true delight. The food, view, and ambiance were all excellent. 
While we enjoyed our dinner within an hour, and were the only ones there, the staff's attentive glances didn't diminish the overall experience. The exquisite design added a touch of elegance to the evening. Highly recommend!",5,2023,08,18
19,A great stay in barcelona,"My first time with family in barcelona and booked this hotel due to location to casa Mila and casa batllo. Such an amazing stay, friendly staff, room is comfy, couple of min walk to pessig de Gracia metro and bus stop to park guell and other places around the city. A few convenience store nearby and food options, a few tapas places nearby as well. Overall excellent and will stay again next time in barcelona",5,2023,08,16
19,"Fantastic location, nice staff but the rooms are not great","Junior suites in the 1st floor need updating. Furniture and decor is very tired. Bathrooms also need attention - the old fashioned jet bath would be best removed as many of the jet covers were either faulty or falling off making the bath unusable. Sofa bed was tiny and dirty. An old piece of red stained foam was provided as a mattress - we took it off and didn’t use as a bed. Size is only really suitable for a young or small child. 
However the staff were friendly enough and the location is fantastic!",2,2023,08,12
19,Not a 5 stars ,"
NOT a 5 stars luxury at all.
During the check in and 40 degree outside could be polite to offer fresh water.
The reception should be trained to give the same service, some receptionist are nice and some sounds rude.
Extremely loud noises from all the ways around the room and last but not least they start to reform a room with hummer and drill sounds during the morning, 
The cleaning was pretty poor , in the room hair on the floor and from the shower walls you get crunchy stuff coming down during the shower .
The housekeeping staff it's the best , polite and smiling.
The elevators didn't work few times and the rooftop bar staff justify with "" lately they are crazy"" .
Sorry but there are much better 5 stars in Barcelona where spend the same money and with a luxurious feeling that you actually expect from a 5 stars luxury hotel .",2,2023,08,12
19,Barcelona Hotel Gem,We had the most comfortable and enjoyable stay at Claris Hotel. The staff were all very very helpful and welcoming especially Jimmy in the dinning room. The reception and hotel staff helped with phoning and confirming our lunch booking and our car hire which was very helpful. The Hotel is also in a great position. I can highly recommend staying at Claris Hotel. The Spa experience was also very enjoyable. ,5,2023,08,12
19,Outstanding!,"The experience at Hotel Claris went above and beyond our expectations! From the moment we were greeted to the moment we left, the service was outstanding! Adding all the nice “personal touches”, I couldn’t ask for a better hotel during our stay in Barcelona!",5,2023,08,09
19,Pampered perfection in the heart of Barcelona,"From the moment we were greeted at the door to the time we left at 5 am to the airport we were treated with the best service, smiles and complete care. They thought of everything we needed and were always there to make our stay more comfortable. We were greeted at the reception with champagne, given excellent restaurant recommendations within walking distance, and then came back to a perfectly comfortable and air conditioned room after walking in the heat.  The room had amazing toiletries, slippers , robes and convenient plugs. When we left to the airport at 5 am they arranged for a taxi and breakfast with a smile. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants a restful stay in an awesome location.  Thank you Hotel Claris!",5,2023,07,30
19,Lovely stay in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel in the center of Barcelona. New, beautifully decorated rooms, excellent state of the hotel itself. Very friendly, professional and fast service!

Highly recommend.",5,2023,07,19
19,Beautiful Egyptian themed hotel,"Weekend break for my wife’s belated birthday present. 

We stayed in Room 401.

We’ve been to Barcelona 5 times. We have a favourite hotel but it was fully booked, so went for this hotel due to photos and reviews.

It’s a stunning hotel. Can clearly see why it’s 5 stars! 

Location is good, near the high-end expensive shops (Gucci, Prada etc) however was a 20 min walk from La Rambla, our favourite place. 

Rooms were kept immaculate and they even do a turndown service at night. One night they left us a rose. Lovely touch. 

If you’re into Egyptian history, you’ll love it here as it’s Egyptian themed and you get free access to the Egyptian museum opposite. 

All in all, a lovely stay, however, a bit too far away from La Rambla and the Marina for our liking but that’s completely personal preference. 

Plenty of taxis available outside. Cost about €10 to get to the marina. 

If you’ve booked here, you won’t be disappointed. 

Tip - There’s a coffee shop opposite the hotel entrance which you must try. Really good prices and lovely decor. Had breakfast there every day.",5,2023,07,17
19,Good Experience ,"The hotel has a very good location, beautiful decoration, good breakfast, nice staff and client service. Nice view from the bar in the rooftop. Check in time is a little bit late (only at 15h no exception).   ",5,2023,07,14
19,Fantastic hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Great hotel in a fantastic location, with amazing staff that could not do enough for us during our stay.
The food on the terrace and the breakfast was great and the pool became a retreat from the scorching hot weather. 
We would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back",5,2023,07,14
19,Nothing special,"This hotel was average at best across the board. 

The walls are extremely thin. We were taking a nap one afternoon and set an alarm. We snoozed the alarm and it went off again — next thing we know someone is banging on our door so hard as if there is an emergency. When we asked the front desk staff about this they said the guest next to us was unhappy with our alarm sound and apologized for his uncalled for behavior. 

I will not stay here again the next time I am in Barcelona.",3,2023,07,12
19,Excellent front desk service,"I stayed here last night 
With my wife for the honeymoon.  i really like this resort and enjoy everything here. Nice service, clean room, large space, nice view. Hospitality. Welcoming champagne. Soft drinks still and sparkling water, etc are free in the minibar. ",5,2023,07,12
19,Amazing experience . Hotel is highly recommended!,"Great Staff, very accommodating and friendly! The hotel is a great location, waking distance to most of the tourist sites ( Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, Sagrada Familia etc). The rooms are spacious and clean. They even turn down your bed for the night!
Great roof top bar and ambiance! ",5,2023,07,05
19,Welcoming hotel that felt like home with amazing amenities,Great staff and great accommodations.  Highly recommend as location is excellent yet quiet.  Staff was most welcoming and helpful.  Enjoyed our stay tremendously and would consider for both leisure or business.,5,2023,07,04
19,Great hotel,"Great hotel. central location - anything is within walkable distance, very clean, friendly staff. Could not wish for anything else. Very good spa services. Very good breakfast. Cozy roof top bar. Definitely a great stay in Barcelona. ",5,2023,07,03
19,BED BUGS  - Claris Hotel Barcelona / ROOM 304,"First off,  let me start with saying that I have been a loyal Hyatt member for over 15 years and travel very frequently around the world for work and I am writing this review with a heavy heart because the the hotel itself and the staff were for the most part great and the location is perfect.  Let me get right to the point,  My wife and I were guest in mid March of 2023 for one week and about midway through our week we started noticing what we though were mosquito bites on our ankles and legs and didn't think much of it, then the next day my wife had even more bites so she jokingly said, ""I wonder if it's bed bugs"".  We have never had bed bug issues in all of our years traveling so i didn't even know what to look for.  After a quick google search, i ripped the bed sheets off and flipped up the corners and sides of the mattress and to our horror, it looked just like the videos, Bed Bug Excrement and Stains  all around the edges of the mattress.  I took lots of pictures and a video  of the mattress and bug bites and went to the front desk and quietly (I didn't want the other guest to hear) told the manager our concerns and they said they would check and take any necessary measures to resolve the issue while we were out that morning. while we were out I received an email from the director of room, Alessio Rinella, ""Greetings from the Hotel Claris 5*GL Barcelona. My name is Alessio Rinella, Director of Rooms, and I would like to follow up with your note received regarding the room cleaniness.
 
I have personally inspected your room 304 together with our Housekeeping Manager and after the inspection we did not detected any bug in the room space, nor in the mattress/bed.
 
Please be informed that as per procedure we are conducting a deep cleaning service of the room and we all remain at your disposal may you wish to add any further information or comment.""

 I found this very odd,  they didn't find any evidence or offer to change our room,  just said they did deep clean and that was it.  I replied back to His email asking how that was possible and sent him the photos and video showing him once again the actual photos adn video of the mattress and Bed Bug Egg Casings, Excrement and stains from that morning.  After returning to the Hotel after lunch i went back to the front desk and very politely voiced my concerns  and was told that they have a lot of expertise on the subject and that there were zero signs of bed bug even after me showing them the pictures once again.  

I didn't want to make a big deal of it, mainly because we only had one more day and we were having a wonderful week so i decided to just wait and contact Hyatt after we returned home because I knew that being a loyal customer for so many years that they would make this right, boy was I wrong.  

A day or so after returning home we made set up a doctors visit to check and confirm our bites and our doctor confirmed that the bites were in his option consistent with Bed Bug bites.  We also called a local pest company and showed them the photos and videos and they also confirmed without a doubt that the mattress had obvious signs of bed bugs.  After this  i called Hyatt customer service and after hearing it was a bed bug issue they immediately transferred me to their consumer affairs, ""Global Care Center"" team and they promptly told me to send them the detail and they would investigate""  I sent them all of the photos, doctors statements, etc. and they told me please be patient , since this was a partner hotel and not a Hyatt owned property it might take a few weeks to resolve. That call and follow up email was on March 20 and as of April 24th i still hadn't heard back, so i called again and was told that the issue had been resolved???  They said they called the Claris and the management said they had resolved the issue directly with me and case closed.  No one at Hyatt had even bother to email me back or call to confirm,  I again politely told them that the case was not closed and i had heard anything from the Hotel since checking out.  They told me to call the hotel and ask them to fix it directly and I told them that i booked and paid for this via Hyatt directly and as a loyal member i expected, ""Hyatt"" to help resolve this.  They said they would escalate once again.   Same story once again,  another month passed and nothing.  So i emailed them again, ccing as many Hyatt executives as i could find email address for in the hopes of someone from Hyatt actually trying to help.  At this point in time all I was asking for were my Hyatt Points back for that stay.  Finally on June 8th, nearly 3 months later i received an email from Hyatt Guest Care Support, offering me 30,000 points (which seams like a lot but that is only the enough to cover 1 nights stay there).  for our inconvenience and with that the case was closed.   

I love Barcelona and I love Hyatt but after this experience i am thinking twice about Staying at any none, ""Hyatt Branded"" hotel in the future.  It's really a shame!

reception and door staff very helpful
Rooftop pool very relaxing 
AC in room very good 
WiFi very fast
Bathroom well equipped with white company toiletries

Cons-Breakfast very disorganised and overpriced ( 64 euros for 2 people)

19,Wonderful Restaurant Team at Breakfast,"Excellent guest care provided by the team at breakfast. Led by long time manager, the staff was attentive and always gracious as they served us. The hotel room was what you would expect at a 5 star property. The location just off the main shopping street was part of what made the experience so perfect this time and five years ago when we last stayed. Look forward to returning in a few years and staying again. ",5,2023,06,27
19,The most warm and wonderful stay!,Claris Hotel & Spa is the best place to lodge if you are planning to stay in Barcelona. It’s close to the Center and easy access to all attractions places. Worth every penny of it and take advantage of all amenities. My stay was wonderful and the staff made me feel I was at home 🙏🏾. The food at the restaurant was muy rica y deliciosa. My trip was short so next I will explore the Japanese restaurant as well. Gracias 🙏🏾,5,2023,06,26
19,Perfect home base for Barcelona visit,"My family spent three nights here (in two rooms) before a cruise. It was a great home base for Barcelona. The rooms were quiet and comfortable, and the location could not be beat. We loved this part of the city. There were many excellent restaurants and world-class shopping within a few blocks. The area was upscale and seemed very safe. My husband joined us a few days late, and my teen daughters and I felt perfectly comfortable walking in the area.

The breakfast was delicious, including a made-to-order omelet that was fantastic. It would have been nice to have had a little variety in the menu because by the third morning, we would have liked something new. But we really can't complain because the food was very good, and it was free (presumably because of our Hyatt status).

We also enjoyed the rooftop restaurant for lunch right after our arrival. The food was very good and although we barely got to the restaurant before closing time, they were very gracious and did not make us feel rushed.

They left a botlle of Cava in each of our rooms, and we  enjoyed drinking it on the rooftop terrace. What a great way to start our trip! 

We'll definitely return if we are ever lucky enough to find ourselves in Barcelona again.",5,2023,06,22
19,Worth every penny!!! 11/10 rating from me,"¿Quieres relajarte, comer bien, sentirte seguro, estar cerca de una de las calles comerciales más grandes de Barcelona, ​​cerca de la ciudad, ir a lugares de interés y lo más importante, dormir bien en un hotel fantástico? Oh I forgot, it has fantastic staff? Well, Claris & Hotel Spa, is the hotel to book to make your stay in Barcelona a memorable trip 😊

If you are a spoiled person or very very picky, or doesn’t know anything/has no taste, please find somewhere else. But if you appreciate a very good hospitality in a small
Luxury Hotel that has good food and great trabajadoras who would make your stay a pleasant stay with smile 😊 book it and you won’t regret it! The hotel website clearly indicates what they offer for each suite i.e upgrade, credits for their restaurant and spa, etc. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to enjoy the spa as I didn’t have much time, but I did enjoy a good dinner at the restaurant. They are no,” bad”,surprises you get what you reserve for and better! I am writing the review while I am still staying at the Hotel and 😒 for those wondering…no “I am not getting anything for writing ✍️ this”… just like to give credit where credit is due. Gracias para todo Claris & Hotel Spa, leaving Barcelona with a smile and I’ll come back for sure for a longer stay!!!
 
P.S. Practice your Spanish while in Barcelona, if you know Spanish, they are very helpful! I understand it very well, but bad/shy at speaking! ",5,2023,06,21

19,Great stay in Barcelona at the Claris Hotel and Spa. We went for the Spanish Grand Prix looking forward to next year.,"The service was excellent, very friendly and helpful. When we arrived there was a problem with the reservation but they quickly resolved it and with a smile and sense of humor.

Breakfast was also fantastic great food and service, great rooftop bar and restaurant.",5,2023,06,05

Big selection of local  restaurants & shops . Nice area in general.. lots of close by sightseeing and easily accessible to different transportation.",5,2023,06,02
19,"Rude and condescending staff, horrible accessibility accommodations, worst hotel I have ever stayed in","Very rude and condescending staff. Horrible facilities for accessibility needs. One accessible room that is right next to the reception desk and very loud, but worst of all, had a horrific smell. Manager was aloof and rude, rest of the staff was terrible except Angela and Juan were great. After having countless horrible experiences with my accessible room and the staff, to top it off, they were moths in my room. I’ve stayed in 20 hotels over the last year alone and this by far was my worst experience. I had to get out of there after two days and transferred to a different hotel.",1,2023,06,01
19,Definitely recommend it,We just completed our 1 week stay at this hotel and had a great experience. The room is very spacious and housekeeping did a great job cleaning it daily. We were given unlimited beverages which is a nice perk. Breakfast was yummy and there were many options. We enjoyed the roof top terrace with the pool and nice views. Everyone was friendly there and the location is excellent. We highly recommend this hotel!,5,2023,05,31
19,"Americans need to run, not walk to this property","The Hotel Claris is in an excellent location to take in the sights of Barcelona. This was a trip for my husband and I, and the location made it so that we could enjoy most of what makes Barcelona exceptional. We thought the world of the staff, from the Front Desk, to the door staff, and housekeeping, they made our comfort their priority. Housekeeping actually irons your sheets and hand towels! (I knew I was in Europe when I saw that) The breakfast was included with our reservation and I thought it had everything we could need, there are hot options available at no extra charge if you have breakfast included in your reservation.  The restaurant staff was kind enough to send me off with ""take away"" coffee as well. The room came with an excellent coffee maker which we appreciated, coming from the US. A word of warning, the ""king"" bed is actually two twin beds pressed together, they have the bedding to format the beds into a king, just make sure you ask for that at check in.",5,2023,05,29
19,Good hotel,"The location was good and the room was not large but clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, when the elevator was running, it made a strange noise that disturbed my sleep.

19,Shocked and in disbelief!,"My travel agent booked my sister and I into the Claris Hotel.  The reservation was made in March and we were to arrive on May 19, 2023.  We had a hotel confirmation and had been in constant contact with the concierge who helped us make several reservations.  We even had booked a private car to pick us up from the airport to take us to the hotel.  When we arrived at the hotel, I went to check in and they could not find our reservation.  The two people at the front desk looked a bit nervous and were mumbling to each other.  I showed them my hotel confirmation and they told me a manager would come out to speak to us.  Long story short, they cancelled our reservation the night before because the credit card did not go through.  I found out that my travel agent had given them an old card number.  What I don't understand is why they would cancel the reservation the night before we were due to arrive.  As stated, I had this reservation for 3 months and now they tell me that the hotel is fully booked and can't accommodate us.  Needless to say, we were shocked and with no where to go it was quite upsetting after an 8 hour plane ride.  Something does not sit right with me.  How or why would they cancel the reservation the night before and that is when they contacted the travel agent but with  the time change, the agent did not get the message.  Needless to say, this was very upsetting and the whole thing sounds very fishy.  We were lucky enough to find a room two blocks away at The One Hotel, which was lovely.  Be careful when you book at this hotel as they may give your room away at the 11th hour.",1,2023,05,28
19,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Hotel Claris for three days, and were not disappointed. The entire staff was warm and welcoming, and they were adept at handling all our issues. We especially appreciated their ability to summons taxis for us at a moment’s notice.  Their housekeeping was also excellent. Its location is great, as well.  It is within easy walking distance of many attractions. We highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,05,27
19,"A beautiful hotel, with a great staff","The Claris Hotel is well-located and beautifully appointed.  The staff is fantastically service-oriented and patient.   Also, the hotel is well-accented with both Mayan and Egyptian art, and there is a Mayan Gallery within the hotel (as well as a spa by that name) and a great Egyptian Museum diagonally across the street.",5,2023,05,27
19,Amazing hotel!,"Had an amazing stay! Centrally located hotel and felt like a VIP staying here. Such cute rooms and loved the design, loved the rooftop, had an amazing breakfast every morning included in our stay and loved the nightly chocolates (and the fact that the mini bar stuff was complimentary!).

Truly had a great time here. Room for improvement is just the fact that the gym is very small, the rooftop bar/restaurant couldn’t accommodate my gluten allergy (and didn’t let me bring up food from another restaurant to even go by the pool and enjoy the views), and sometimes in the hallway it smelled a bit like sewage. But despite all this, I highly recommend staying here in Barcelona and hope to return in the future!",5,2023,05,25
19,Claris Hotel - Amazing Hotel Experience,"We had a fantastic visit to the Claris Hotel. The location is in a great part of town surrounded by bars, restaurants, and La Rambla area. The hotel rooms were incredibly nice with a view of the street, comfortable beds, and a cozy atomsphere. 

The staff was some of the best I've ever experienced. Everyone - from the front desk, to the cleaning staff, to the restuarant staff - were professional, kind, and went above and beyond our expectations.

As a first time trip to Barcelona, I highly recommend the Claris Hotel. ",5,2023,05,19

19,Great breakfast and cozy rooftop,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our 5th trip to Barcelona. The breakfast restaurant was a calm space and cooked what I wanted. The time spent relaxing by the pool on the rooftop was also great.
However, when I checked in, I was told that the room was not ready, so I was disappointed that I had to wait for more than 30 minutes.",5,2023,05,10
19,A Fantastic Place to Stay in Barcelona,"This was our first visit to Barcelona in many years.  A friend stayed at the Claris Hotel a few years ago and highly recommended it.  We were not disappointed.  Our room was large and comfortable.  The hotel itself is very nice and the staff always went out of their way to be helpful.  Marta was fantastic, booking dinner reservations for each night we were there - every choice was excellent!  She even arranged a tour of Montserrat for us with a reputable tour group.  The hotel's location is very good, walkable to many of Barcelona's attractions.  Taxi's are always nearby if the destination is further away.  We hope to return to the Claris, our new go-to hotel in Barcelona. TIP-staying at the Claris allows free admission to the amazing Egyptian Museum across the street.",5,2023,05,08
19,Worst experience of my entire life - everything but a 5 star hotel,"We booked a suite that had no window (a tiny opening giving directly on a wall that is 30 cm away is not a window), the sauna and spa installation are to be booked in advance and to go one by one (and not because of covid reason - this is their policy) and are at additional cost. We wanted to go to the gym which was closed for « works » and we asked the reception people who just said « yes it’s closed » without explaining or letting us know that it would reopen the next day. So basically a very expensive bunker with no gym and no spa is not a 5 star hotel.",1,2023,04,30
19,Wonderful Stay,"We had the pleasure of staying here while in Barcelona. We stayed in a junior suite with our daughter and the room gave her a bit of privacy. The staff is very friendly and often greeted us by name. The breakfast was plentiful, service was wonderful and the food was delicious. My only complaint would be the lighting in the bathroom, a black bathroom needs more lights! A little too dark.",4,2023,04,28

19,Stolen items and bad service,"First of all, not happy with the service. My £400 watch was stolen from my room by the cleaners while out. I did put a complaint which took a while to get back to me. They logged in with the police and I still haven’t heard from them.

Followed up with an email since I live in a different country, all of heard from the rooms director that they did an investigation and no proof that anything was taken from the room.

Absolutely disgusting customer service, I have stayed in 5 star hotels across the world but these guys are the worse!",1,2023,03,30
19,Excellent value compared to other 5 star hotels nearby,"Really cool Hotel. Very helpful staff and a number of really lovely touches. Complimentary bottle of cava and vox of chocolates. Complimentary mini bar which was refilled every day.

The rooftop pool area was lovely and relaxed and there was a small but tasty selection of tapas food available.

More options were available in the restaurant.

Great location for Gaudi tourism. 

The room was extremely nice and the complete blackout was exceptional at nighttime.

The bed wasn't the most comfortable and was very squeaky every time you move... but the furnishings were great otherwise and that was really the only slight negative",5,2023,03,30
19,Excellent location and superb  hotel,Stayed here for 4 nights celebrating my daughters birthday.From the minute we walked in until we left we were made so welcome All the staff were super  friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble  .Great location too  ,5,2023,03,28
19,Wonderful experience during our 3 nights there,"Excellent service. They went above and beyond to help us celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. Wonderful location, friendly staff, super clean and spacious room with very nice amenities, such as rain shower, flat iron, robes, chocolates every night :), etc. Loved it! 100% recommended!",5,2023,03,25
19,Fantastic stay,"We stayed for 3 nights in a Junior suite duplex. The hotel is fantastically located close to all the main tourist spots. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly and gave us a great restaurant recommendation. The rooftop area is stunning, a lovely place to enjoy a cocktail in the evening before heading out. We opted for the VIP breakfast one morning on the terrace and it was possibly the best breakfast we’ve ever eaten, Mario our host was exceptional. The eggs Benedict was incredible. 

We’d definitely chose to stay here again when visiting Barcelona.",5,2023,03,17
19,Weekend in Barcelona,"We spent 4 days at the hotel claris and had an amazing stay. The room was fantastic and location was great. The staff were all so kind and very helpful, which made the stay so amazing! i would highly recommend this hotel..  ",5,2023,03,13
19,Astounding Service!,"There are not enough circles to adequately rate the service we received at Claris. We spent 10 days in Barcelona  (3 nights at Claris) . In every aspect the staff went above and beyond expectations. This evening when we arrived back at our hotel (a different location) we realized my husband’s work ipad had been left behind in our previous hotel room. We arrived at Claris at nearly 11pm. Two of the staff had finished their shifts and were ready to leave when we arrived. Both stayed, made phone calls to the head of housekeeping and did absolutely everything they could do to ensure we would leave town with his iPad. It would have been so easy for them to say there was nothing they could do, but they stayed until the iPad was located and returned to us. Their service was both astounding and very appreciated. I would return to this hotel in an instant!",5,2023,03,12
19,A Magical Weekend,"Myself and my partner travel ALOT, 10s and 10s of times a year and we have stayed in multiple hotels, and this is by far, the best service we have ever received in a hotel. From the minute we walked in, we had a glass of champagne in our hands, the staff then went above and beyond to have our room ready earlier than the normal 3pm check In time. We then received a knock on our apartment door to a complimentary welcome bottle of champagne as well as a further knock with chocolates. The staff couldn’t do enough for us. The room was absolutely stunning, everything was thought of.. a clothes steamer, hair straighteners, slippers, a thick robe, a Nespresso coffee machine and mini bar .. the list goes on. The main guy at breakfast again, couldn’t do enough for us, he was so friendly and welcoming, just like every single member of staff we met. The roof top is gorgeous, the food and singer at dinner was unbelievable. To be honest, the whole experience made us feel like VIPs. Location was perfect! There honestly isn’t one fault I can say. 
Thank you for a stay! We would 1000% love to come back.",5,2023,03,05
19,Fabulous Hotel,"Lovely room (a junior suite) - very quiet and plenty of space for three of us, with good private space for our teenage daughter. Everywhere clean and tidy and super helpful staff.

19,Just perfect!,"We originally booked a 3 bedroom apartment across the rd from the hotel the apartments are part of the hotel. The apartment is perfect for a family of 5 but we had problems with a leaking boiler. 

The hotel moved us over to the main hotel into 2 junior rooms which was amazing this hotel is perfect the staff are some of the friendliest people I’ve met they are so welcoming they couldn’t do more for you, helped us with dinner reservations. 

The breakfast is great. The waiter is very good at his job he knew what we would be ordering as soon as we sat down. 

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,02,16

19,Made to feel special,"We had a wonderful stay here for 4 nights for husband’s 50th. We were upgraded and given Prosecco on arrival as celebration. Beautiful hotel with very friendly and welcoming staff. 
We had a duplex room which felt unique. 
Great location. Would 100% recommend. ",5,2023,01,29
19,Gorgeous historical room and 5 star service. Great value,"This historic  hotel is in the great Eixample neighborhood. Best of historical and modern. The rooms are stunning. Worth an upgrade to a junior suite. We had a two story room. The staff is phenomenal. All front desk act like concierges and they contacted us before we arrived with a wonderful list of restaurants, bars and clubs. Also we needed help to get soccer tickets and that was done promptly. Such friendly service. We stayed 6 nights and if you stay 5 nights or more you get a very good discount. Nice to do that and do a same day trip with high speed train to Figueres or Girona. There’s a spa there but we didn’t get a chance to use it since it was our first time there. Next time! I hope to be a repeat customer. ",5,2023,01,28
19,Simply the Best,"Óscar the door man set the tones, from the moment he greet you at the taxi. Service is great, front desk, breakfast buffet and house keeping. The regular buffet manage by Jim was great, mind you they have a VIP Breakfast, so one can just imagine. The wet bar man comes in the morning to make sure your fridge is refilled daily. The front desk boss booked our dinner reservations for my birthday great choice. There’s a saying my cup runners over, your cup will run over with cava here. The rooms are well lit and decorated, black out blinds if you need to sleep during the day. All the staff was friendly and would ask if you needed anything  a carry over from Oscar. This was our tenth trip to Barcelona in the last three years, and definitely the best hotel we have stayed at.",5,2023,01,24
19,An Exceptional Hotel Experience,"Highly recommend Claris Hotel. Spacious, opulent rooms with everything you can imagine. Amazing location close to all the finest shops and restaurants. (Especially Entrecote next door). Service was exceptional. Can't wait to go back.",5,2023,01,20
19,Amazing!!,"Wonderful hotel, definitely very worth the price. Did have one minor incident where there was a bug in my room, but the staff were up in an instant, killed the bug and then apologised with champagne the following day.
They look after you exceptionally well, especially Alvin who looked after us every day during breakfast.",5,2023,01,16
19,Amazing experience,"Amazing service, great and friendly staff, perfect value for money, super clean, amenities, room service, internet, spacious room, welcoming reception, and unforgettable experience.

19,Perfect hotel for visiting Barcelona,Perfect location just few steps from Passaig de Gracia. Very clean and with really supportive service. Fully recommended for few days stay in Barcelona. Restaurant with delicious breakfasts. Rooftop bar with realy nice view,5,2023,01,08
19,"Simply FLAWLESS! Classy, Comfortable and Beautiful!","I stayed one week at Claris during the Christmas/New Year period with my family and I can't wait to go back.  I have been at many 5 stars in the world but the attention to detail, kindness and professionalism of the staff make this hotel a real gem in Barcelona. 

Before our arrival, the communication with Marta was fantastic and she was very kind and patient with all our questions.  We finally checked in, and were given an upgrade and a bottle of cava almost every evening which was a nice touch.  We stayed at one of the Executive rooms (511) and we had a nice corner street view. The room was spacious, and very clean.  Actually, I need to thank the housekeeping staff for keeping up with our crazy schedules and always leave the space immaculate. The turn down service was also very cute. 

The breakfast is delicious and the staff is also incredible - I really appreciated the kindness and attention of the 2 gentleman running the hall.  

Rooftop is beautiful and the swimming pool is quite big compared to the standard pools you find across Barcelona, I am tempted to go back in the summer to try it out while sipping one of the great cocktails they serve.

Location is FANTASTIC, just a block off Passeig de Gracia with all the shopping and restaurants - we were able to literally walk everywhere. 

I can't wait to go back and if possible, I would give this hotel more than 5 stars - truly IMPECCABLE! Thank you Claris for making our stay unforgettable!",5,2023,01,04
19,"Great location, within walking distance of many attractions, including restaurants.","The staff were all friendly and helpful.  The concierges found reservations for us at two great restaurants.  The breakfast buffet on the lower level was terrific.  Our room spacious, comfortable, and convenient.  The price was also reasonable.",5,2023,01,02
19,Great hotel for great vacation!,"Best location
Best service
Great room & food!
We will be happy to return soon :)
The bar is always full.
The resturant & the pool at the upper floor are amazing.
So kind staff. Waiting for my next vacation at barcelona returing to the hotel",5,2023,01,01
19,This hotel just smells really good,"For our trip to Barcelona last summer of 2022, our family chose this hotel to stay for 6 days and 5 nights.

It was so unfortunate that on our first day, there was no electricity and water. It did last for quite long time actually (e.g. around 6h) — for a hotel with a category of GL, I would say that having no electricity and water for quite long time was a NO-NO. So instead of enjoying the room, we were forced to go out and when we returned, alas, there is still no electricity and water. 

But aside from this mishap, one thing that really strikes me was the moment I have stepped in the corridor or the hotel’s lobby — it really smells really, really good. The smell was so refreshing and knowing that it was summer and it was so hot, but it had a calming and refreshing effect to me. 

For the room, we have booked the Junior Suite — it was smaller compared to other Junior Suite rooms we have booked in the past in different hotel lines e.g. Hilton and Radisson. Though the interior was actually unique, I would say that it did not really fit my taste.

Don’t get me wrong, but I love the toilet and bathroom design — the combination of black and bronze is perfect. The small black and bronze tile pieces is like an art and it looks elegant to me.

Like other high end hotels, they also offer free slippers but I think their slippers are one of the best ones and way, way better than the others. 

The swimming pool on the roof top is also one fo the amenities the hotel offers — it was also the reason why we have actually booked this hotel. However, my son got disappointed as the swimming pool was also small. He was not really able to use it as a lot of people were actually there as the pool apparently is on the same level where the bar is.

For the location, it is only few blocks away from the Passeig de Gracia, however it was around 1.2 km away from the centre which is the Plaza de Catalunya — that would be around 15-20 minutes walk.

We have not tried the breakfast but I think it was around 25 euro per person and it is the same price for the child.

Should our family stay again in this hotel? Aside from the scent that I really love, there is no other reason for us to come back. Probably we just have not really experienced the GL* service we were looking forward to and there was no big difference at all compared to other 5-star hotels we stayed in or should I say, we had better experience in the other hotels when it comes to customer service. We might try another hotel of the same category as this room in this hotel is not cheap.",3,2022,12,30
19,Lovely hotel in the world,Hotel room was really clean and fabullous. All managers and staffs is lovely and kind. I would love to recommend this hotel who want to visit Barcelona. Spa was good and roof top bar was really pretty to see the view around. The location is really close to luxury shopping.,5,2022,12,27
19,"Claris Hotel Gl, Best Location , best quality","Service is really Good , nice Design , Good Location , 2 minutes to Passaig Gracia , Lovely Roof Garden with pool ! Special Meuseum inside the hotel !!   Stuffs are very kind . Breakfast is Special ... Ambience is perfect . ....................",5,2022,12,27
19,Wonderful in every way,"We had a rough year and decided to get away for Christmas.  The Claris Hotel, the staff, our suites, the spa, the service and comfort has been the most perfectly beautiful end to our year.  The location is also fabulous for excellent restaurants and exploring the city.",5,2022,12,27
19,Happy at the Claris,"The 3 day stay before a cruise was a huge success, our bedroom being fine, the breakfasts excellent, and the helpfulness of the staff was absolutely outstanding.  A really great group, and they played a significant part in making our stay so good.",5,2022,12,08
19,Business trip,"Came to Barcelona on business for two nights and stayed at the Claris Hotel. Location was fantastic (a minute walk to Paseo de Gracia), hotel itself very clean (both the public areas and the room), service was excellent (both front-desk and room up-keeping - and mostly excellent service by the staff at breakfast hall). Was good value for money (at least when I stayed...) and will definitely return.",5,2022,12,05
19,Wonderful service in a great location!,"We had an amazing stay at Hotel Claris. We stayed for 4 nights in a Junior Suite. Every staff member we encountered couldn’t have been friendlier. The mini bar was complimentary, the breakfast selection fresh, tasty and generous, the rooms were freshly cleaned each day with a turn down service. It’s a 2 block walk from Casa Batllo in the heart of Barcelona and 20 min from La Rambla. Staying in Exaimple was the right decision, great shopping and cafes nearby, beautiful buildings all around. There are taxis right outside the hotel & a train station close by as well. A delightful and rare experience to find a hotel that ticks all the boxes.",5,2022,11,30
19,"Beautiful Hotel, less than beautiful service","The hotel itself is very nice, our room was comfortable and spacious. The bellmen and breakfast staff were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately the service of the reception staff was less than what you'd expect at a hotel of this caliber.  Any questions or requests were quickly dismissed and denied without any explanation. Overall I would not recommend staying here. Stay at the Hotel Majestic, it's a block away, is just as nice and with staff happy to have you there.",3,2022,11,30
19,Inforgetable,"Excellent Facilities and Service. 
Staff always available and extremely attentive.
The head of the room at breakfast makes anyone feel welcome and in a good mood
The Hotel Fragance is  just wonderful.",5,2022,11,17
19,Great hotel in a great location,Great hotel and would definitely recommend staying in the Eixample neighborhood over the gotchic quarter. Only 10-15 min walk to gotchic quarter.  Could not hear any road noise from the room and they had great blackout curtains so we slept great.  ,5,2022,11,17
19,Weekend away with girlfriends,"A lovely luxurious weekend away with girlfriends. Beautiful hotel which was ideally located. They looked after us so we’ll, especially Jimmy at breakfast and Costin at reception. The breakfast was delicious. The rooms so comfortable. We were very happy.",5,2022,11,13
19,Chilling at the Claris,"The hotel was terrific find.
Great staff, rooms, decor and amenities. outstanding location and decor. A must stay for your next trip to Barcelona My only complaint was the very limited menu for the dinner service",5,2022,11,07
19,Staff five star plus. Hotel 3 + stars ,"The staff at the hotel or 2nd to none they were all incredibly helpful and friendly. Without these people there would be no hotel. As for being a five star I have my doubts. The room is nothing like a photograph on their website, much smaller and in need of a little attention, the towelling robes have seen better days and serve the towels. The beds are extremely comfortable and the pillows are fabulous. The housekeepers are very friendly and very helpful and do a beautiful job on the whole is very enjoyable stay but that’s thanks to the staff and not the surroundings of the room  they gave me a bottle of champagne for my birthday which was much appreciated and a very kind thought. Not sure I’ve come back but it was a wonderful stay all in all. Love Barcelona ",3,2022,11,02
19,Unbeatable in Barcelona!,"Absolutely exceptional!!

We stayed at the Claris Hotel & Spa for 3 weeks during October 22 in one of the Grand Suite (Duplex) rooms (219). The initial welcome from Valeria at the hotel was superb, striking the perfect balance between friendliness and professionalism, and check-in was rapid.

The room itself wasn't quite as big as expected, but this is common with all hotels in Barcelona and certainly not unique to this hotel. The room was well appointed, beautifully adorned and offered us a very comfortable stay. Housekeeping staff were hard working yet discreet and remarkably adept at managing to clean our room around our very unpredictable schedule.

Each time we left or returned to the hotel, we were greeted by the great team of doorstaff who were utterly professional and always willing to offer advice, or directions, coupled with an avid wit - their encyclopedic local knowledge was invaluable throughout our stay and their continued upbeat attitude very much appreciated.

The standard of food and service in the rooftop bar and restaurant, La Terraza, deserves special praise of its own. Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. We spent much time there throughout our stay, both of an afternoon and an evening, where the relaxed atmosphere and fabulous array of tapas sustained us well and kept us very pleasantly 'hydrated'. The standard of fare in the actual restaurant was exquisite and cannot be beaten, close to Michelin starred in my opinion, yet not pretentious. The service received throughout matched this incredibly high standard and our time spent on the 7th Floor undoubtedly made the singular biggest difference to our time in Barcelona. Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of all staff, but a massive big thank you to Mario and the Matre'd team, and to bar staff Elena, Valeria, Rädu, Mario, Joulian and Bertha. Without you our stay would have been so much more dull.

After 3 weeks of pure joy, our room bill was settled with consummate professionalism leaving me the last few hours to soak up everything this fantastic city has to offer. This necessitated a very kind (unbooked and unplanned) wake up call at 4am from the superb through-night staff, which resulted in me NOT missing my outbound flight. This kindness, forethought, attention to detail and dedication from all staff set this hotel far above the many others I have stayed in.

Barcelona, as the staff will validate, I have lived and loved every second.

Would I go back to the Claris Hotel & Spa in the future to revisit the staff I now consider friends?

In a heartbeat - absolutely exceptional from start to finish!

Thank you so very much for looking after us with so much attention and affection. I hope to see you all again soon.",5,2022,11,01
19,Beautiful Hotel,Absolutely love this hotel! Beautiful and great cost for the price. Staff is super friendly and rooms are great value for the price! Centrally located in Barcelona to all of the main areas you would want to visit and see!,5,2022,10,31
19,COMFORT AT ITS BEST!!!!,"The room was sufficient. The best thing about it was our bed. It was soft yet firm enough. The pillows (3 different sizes) were perfect-soft yet not over fluffy and most of all the linens (sheets, pillow cases, comforter cover) were so silky smooth that we really enjoyed sleeping on our bed! Housekeeping was also super. Drinks and coffee replenished daily and complimentary! Overall comfort and service were outstandingly superb! Highly recommended!!",5,2022,10,31
19,"Convenient location, friendly and professional staff.","Stayed here from from the 24th-27th Oct for a special birthday celebration week with friends. Very friendly, welcoming, professional staff all round. Everything was dealt with in a friendly professional manner. Breakfast was amazing and the service was excellent. Rooms were large enough with complimentary drinks. My friends and I have no complaints about our stay here and can highly recommend you staying here. Ask for suggestions on where to go for tapas at reception, they gave good suggestions. Thank you everyone at Claris hotel for making our special girls trip so special.",5,2022,10,29
19,Outstanding & Lucurious,"I’ve never stayed in a Hotel with a hair straightener and rarely one that the hair dryer works well!  I stayed in Room 101 - great position - had a Mayan Archaeological exhibit as my neighbour.  100% of all staff were excellent, the restaurant food is exquisite.   The drink service, concierge and doormen are better than I have ever experienced - I don’t stay in this standard of global excellence often - but I did not feel uncomfortable.  Always had a sense that I was most important!",5,2022,10,24
19,Exceptional location for things to see and  places to eat.,"The front desk was very helpful with everything. There was some confusion on how to use the shower, tub, and coffee maker, but with a little ""trial and error"" all went well. Almost everything we wanted to see was within walking distance from the hotel. Also, the transportation to the hotel from the cruise terminal and to the airport was purchased through the hotel and was well worth the extra cost.",5,2022,10,20
19,Fantastic,"Checked here with no notice, found a junior suite and the staff couldn’t do any more. Welcomed like a lost brother and looked after. Next stay will be with my wife as I have to show her the Barcelona hospitality.
Big shout out to - Alex, Meritxell, Paula , Wisa, Valeria, Marta    and Mario in the terrace restaurant. 
Would I recommend? - absolutely without a doubt as they made my stay extremely great 👍🏻 
Well done Hotel Claris",5,2022,10,19
19,Claris Barcelona Excellent Stay,"I need to start by staying that what made this hotel excellent was the front desk.  They  were friendly, helpful and accommodating.  This is my third trip to Europe in the past few months and this was by far the best hotel service.  The bell staff was also excellent.  If you are looking for a small boutique hotel this is not that type of hotel but that is not the norm in this area of Barcelona.  I would say that the Claris has the feel of a smaller Westin in the US.  We stayed in two different rooms and both were good (we left to travel and came back)  I would say that if you have mobility issues ask for a walk in shower.  The bath tub shower could be difficult to get in if you have any issues.  We were fine but just wanted to note.  The location of the hotel is excellent. I much preferred it to the Gothic and Born where our friends stayed.  Easier to get around and not so tight with tourists.  All the recommendations given by the front desk for restaurants were excellent.  The other part of the hotel that we loved was the outdoor terrace for drinlks.  We used it almost every night.  The view and setting are fabulous.  Our friends stayed in much more expensive hotels in the Gothic and we would gather on the claris hotel at night.  I think this is a great choice for Barcelona.",5,2022,10,19
19,Excellent hôtel in the heart of Barcelona,"Great boutique hotel. The staff are exceptionally helpful and dynamic. The hotel is beautiful. Room comfortable and beautiful. Large bathroom with shower, jacuzzi and even small sauna!  Hotel perfectly located near all the points of interest.",5,2022,10,18
19,Great location in Barcelona,"The Claris is definitely a five-star hotel, and the location is excellent.  Walking distance to the Sagrada, Boqueria and more.  Their restaurant is very good with a lovely rooftop view of the city. But what makes it special is the staff.  From greeting you with water or prosecco when you enter to giving directions, they make you feel welcome.",5,2022,10,17
19,Excellent Barcelona location ,We thoroughly enjoyed this contemporary hotel. Very comfortable beds and nice black out shades. We were seranaded while enjoying wine on the roof top terrace. Unfortunately we never tried out the pool but it definitely looked inviting.  Also make sure to try the complimentary Cava sparkling wine in the reception area.  A big shout out to the reception desk personnel. Thank you!,5,2022,10,17
19,Very disappointed in the Claris hotel,"I lost my wallet while staying at the hotel.
I realized that I had no wallet when I checked out, so I went back to the room where I stayed. But a cleaning staff had already visited my room.(It was before cleaning, but the tip I put on the bed was not there, and the beer I put in the mini refrigerator was taken out.)

There was a wallet until I entered the hotel room last night. I remember because I always kept the card key(for hotel room I stayed) in my wallet and took it out to used.

In the morning, except for going to the hotel's underground restaurant for a breakfast, I didn't leave the hotel room until I checked out. (When I went to eat breakfast, I only carried the card key.)

I didn't think the staff of a five-star hotel would steal the lost item without returning it. So I thought my wallet was in my big luggage. I didn't have cash or any other card so I have to use the app version(on my smart-phone) of the missing card. So I lowered the card limit just in case.

When someone use the card, I get a text message right away, but I didn't get any text message until I got on the 6 p.m. flight. So I believed my wallet was somewhere in my big suitcase.

However, when I arrived at Paris Airport for a transfer and turned on my phone again, I found out that someone had used the card until the limit was exceeded after I got on the plane. Even after limit was exceeded he/she attempted to pay by card twice more. There was a cash in the wallet. I think he/she was waiting to got off work to use my card.

I can't believe this happened in a five-star hotel and they didn't answer my e-mail about this. I'm very disappointed in the Claris hotel.",1,2022,10,14
19,A day in Barcelona !,"We really enjoyed  it and were pleased with our hotel service and accommodations . The staff and servers were very friendly and professional .

19,"Beautiful, comfortable hotel with friendly staff.","The hotel was beautiful, comfortable, and very accommodating.  The location was perfect for most of our city touring. The staff were warm, friendly, and very helpful. We had a standard room which was perfect. The bed and sofa were very comfortable which is rare in hotels. The bathroom and shower/tub were of a perfect size.  There was a coffee machine and coffee pods and bottled water in the room which was great.  In fact the drinks in the refrigerator were complimentary.  My only complaint about our room was lighting. Even with all lights on, the  lighting wasn’t bright enough to be able to read.  My other complaint was the restaurant pricing for breakfast was very expensive at 59 Euros per person for buffet style so we never ate there.  There were so many other outside cafes and breakfast restaurants so we ate out.  We’re glad we stayed here and would come back again.",5,2022,10,11
19,Beautiful Hotel,"Wonderful stay at Hotel Claris. From the moment we arrived the service was excellent, the front desk, luggage concierge, wait staff at the pool bar, and room service staff were all so friendly throughout our stay. Arrived early and our room was not ready, but the hotel allowed us to change/freshen up and held our bags while we went out exploring until our room was ready. We stayed in a duplex suite which was awesome, the upstairs area was cool and made the room much more spacious. Rooftop pool was nice but small, so at times a little crowded, but we still enjoyed going up to enjoy the sun with a glass of cava. Wish we had time to try the spa. Location of the hotel is excellent! The area is nice and safe, we loved being able to walk all over the city from here! Would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,10,10

19,"Si, Claris!","Claris Hotel & Spa is a haven nestled in a wonderful location just one block off Passeig de Gracia. The hotel does most things right: from a warm welcome reception from the doorman, the luggage assistants, front desk staff, to the fun and attentive bar and restaurant staff at La Terrazza Claris bar and restaurant which offered a wonderful dinner selection of full-sized dishes (one can eat only so much tapas) including steaks. Here's a run down of the great stuff to the needs improvement:

The great stuff that Claris does to claim 5 stars:
- Towels - big, absorbent sheets of thick cotton. 
- Fresh, clean, thick thread count cotton.
- Evening turndown service with chocolates.
- Very clean common areas and rooms.
- Uniquely designed rooms and suites. 
- La Terrazza Claris had a chill vibe, beautiful seating areas, and a great restaurant.
- Attentive staff and service. We loved hanging out at the Claris rooftop terrace. Thanks to Massimo, Jose, Jonathan, Mario, and Vicente for the great service!

The good stuff:
- Big spacious rooms with ample seating areas.
- Nice bathrooms, although the shower controls are a bit tricky.
- Breakfast buffet was good but not great. Having been to many European hotels with generous varieties of continental breakfast fare, I found Claris' spread to be limited. There is, however, a hot breakfast menu from which to order for an additional charge.

Needs improvement:
- The sheet that is placed next to the bed at turndown service needs to be rubber-backed or non-slip to prevent guests from slipping on it.
- Rooms are not well insulated from outside noise.",5,2022,09,28
19,Say Yes to the Claris,"From the minute we walked through the door at an ungodly early hour, until the time we left at an ungodly early hour, we referred to the Claris as ""home"". The staff, the room, the public spaces were just wonderful, and lived up to all of our expectations. This is a property we would definitely visit again!",5,2022,09,24
19,Fabulous stay,"We had a fabulous stay at Hotel Claris. We arrived early and was allowed to check in early along with a room upgrade! Lovely staff and services. Excellent location, only 1-2 blocks away from one of the main the metro stations.",5,2022,09,19
19,I had expected more,"Great location and friendly staff but I had expected more. The room had no desk to work on, no decent chair and a strange little step in the middle of the room over which I almost fell in the middle of the night. We had business meetings in the hotel but the meeting room we were in did not meet our business expectations (it was like the name said: Museo) but was not really suited for business meetings.",4,2022,09,19
19,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed two nights at Hotel Claris following a Celebrity Beyond cruise to Greek islands and Malta. The location of this hotel is good.  This hotel is a gem full of antiquity items while with excellent modern amenities. The staffs are impeccably helpful throughout our stay. I will definitely stay there next time.  Thanks, Hotel Claris!",5,2022,09,18
19,Terrible customer experience and rude staff. Definitely one to avoid.,"Truly terrible experience to date.
With the exception of the front of house door-men, rude service by reception staff in particular. Disinterested and unhelpful with room problems.
This is not five star in either comfort or customer service.
Vacuous hotel entrance with what appear to be cheap looking  plastic carp in water in reception.  Slow registration. Room uninspiring with poor finish, missing and mouldy grout in bathroom and  cheap repairs. Road side rooms very noisy. Bed extremely hard. Old fashioned shower over bath so prepare to climb.
Breakfast very dull with dry pastries and uninspiring fruit/yoghurt selection. Numerous requests for hot drinks and toast that never did arrive.
The cooked breakfast was the only redeeming factor being cooked to order.
Positives? Location and a few artefacts seen in rooms.
Overview - Not five  star by any stretch of the imagination and needs to up its game . This hotel lags significantly behind - predominantly due to poor customer service which is inexcusable.",1,2022,09,17
19,BEST HOTEL STAY THANKS TO PAULA,"We had an Excellent stay at the Claris Hotel and Spa in Barcelona.

This is mainly due to the intern Paula at the Concierge Desk and Martha at the Front Desk.

Paula treated us like friends.

She was always helpful, smiling, courteous and wonderful.

She truly made our stay the best.

We have stayed at many 5 Star properties and Paula is the best Concierge we have ever had.

Claris would do well to hire Paula and make her a leader at the property.

Martha was also very helpful in resolving the issue with our room.

Martha was also very nice and wonderful to us.

Thank you Paula and Martha for taking so good care of us while we were in Barcelona.",5,2022,09,12
19,Wonderful hotel,The hotel was in a great location. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. Rooftop deck and pool was amazing. Bartenders were extremely nice and welcoming. Room was clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2022,09,12
19,Average,Our experience at Claris hotel was ok but overall everything was overpriced and not value for money at all. I had booked a twin room for my daughter and I but on arrival we were given a double room. Staff were slow to sort this out.. it took them 24hours to change the beds.  The restaurant staff were quite unfriendly which made us not want to hang around so we went elsewhere for dinner.,2,2022,09,11
19,"Lovely property, disappointing Front Desk experiences","I have stayed at this hotel many times, and it is a prime hotel, in a prime location in Barcelona.

During my last visit however, they completely missed the mark on Service.

As an Expedia Rewards Gold member, I am entitled to several benefits.

The hotel did not recognize my status upon check-in such as complimentary room upgrade (subject to availability), free bottle of champagne and guaranteed late check out. I had to point these things out to the check-in staff.

I noticed the hotel had availability in junior suites and asked if it was possible to get an upgrade due to my status, and the fact that there was availability. The young lady at the Reception was not authorized to make this decision, and deferred to a manager. The manager said I was welcome to pay for the upgrade, but a complimentary upgrade was not possible. 

Okay....  

What's the point of booking at a Hotels.com VIP Rewards property if you are asked to pay for an upgrade for a better room that just so happens to be available?

I politely declined to pay for the upgrade and asked if they would instead consider  providing complimentary breakfast. The manager agreed to this, and I thought that was a fine gesture/service.

The champagne was not delivered to the room on our first day. Hence, I asked Reception to ensure that the champagne would be delivered by 4 p.m. on Day 2 so that we might enjoy it prior to dinner.  By 5 p.m. it still had not arrived and a call to Reception revealed that it would be there ""any minute."". By 5:30 p.m. I just gave up.

The champagne was in the room when we returned for dinner, which was way to late to enjoy it. Such disappointing service from a 5 star hotel.  

I hope the maid enjoyed the champagne.

Lessons learned for this hotel. If you are entitled to your benefits make sure you ask about them and avoid being charged for an upgrade which should be complimentary.",2,2022,09,10
19,Disrespectful customer service,"They made me wait 3 hours in the lobby to give me a room different than the one promised. They said I need to wait 1 hour originally, then kept dragging it 30 minutes each time I check till 3 hours passed. After that they gave me a different one than the originally assigned, a downgrade. Many customers checked in during these 3 hours. They probably gave my assigned room to someone who checked after me while making me wait. Very disrespectful and inappropriate. I refused to check in and cancelled my reservation with them, then walked to Majestic hotel where I was treated much better.",1,2022,09,09
19,Great hotel,We were greeted by a polite and courteous crew.  All services were top notch. Highly recommended. Staff were extremely polite and helpful. They assisted us 0n every step of our trip from the start to the end. ,5,2022,09,08
19,Best Hotel In Barcelona,"Claris was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, The staff are so friendly, kind and professional at all times. I would recommend this hotel over any other hotel in the city. We had such a pleasant stay, thank you for everything! ",5,2022,09,07
19,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Everything was perfect, I really recommend this place. I have already my reservation for in 2 weeks .
Beautiful and clean room , amazing front desk, terrasse and restaurant was perfect and delicious , and congratulations for the cocktails 🍹👌",5,2022,09,04
19,Fantastic hotel,Fantastic hotel. Loved this place. Everyone was super lovely. Had a great time. Very comfortable. Lots of great touches. Wonderful service and staff. Great pool on the rooftop… What more do you need? Thank you!,5,2022,09,03
19,Safety,"The area is supposed to be safer than downtown. However. My incident speaks otherwise. Around 11pm, three men attacked me, I defended and they ran away after attempting to taking my cheap watch. In a brief fight, I got few bruises and abrasion.  The location is not as safe as the hotel claims to be. Be careful and do not wear any jewelry or bag. 

What bothers me the most is the careless attitude of the front desk personnels. When I mentioned this incident and asked to the importance of reporting to police, they seemed really indifferent. They told me that it is not so uncommon to hear the incident like mine, that since nothing was actually stolen the police will not pursue the case and that my physical altercation is not consequential, and that nothing could be done.

The location is not safe and please be careful.",1,2022,09,03
19,Best experience!,"My partner and I stayed here a few months ago when we contracted Covid. The hotel staff were incredibly kind and supportive. They would bring up our food, provide us with cutlery so we didn't have to eat out of take-out boxes, head to the pharmacy to purchase supplies for us and navigate every possible inconvenience two guests stuck in quarantine might have thrown their way. We must have had, by far, the most enjoyable quarantine experience and it was all thanks to the front desk, kitchen, and housekeeping staff at Claris.",5,2022,09,01
19,DINNER AT THE TERRACE RESTAURANT,"It's a place with nice atmosphere, greenery and soft music, next to the  pool.
Very attentive service and very little noise around.
The menu is correct in terms of options as well as its presentation.
Perhaps what could be improved would be to enhance the flavor of the dishes a little more, somewhat bland in general, although with good quality.
I think it is a good option to enjoy a dinner with your couple as well as for business",4,2022,08,31
19,Anniversary stay amazing!!!,"Everything was amazing!! 

Appreciated the anniversary Cava - such a nice touch! Check in with Luisa was amazing. Rooftop Pool Bar staff - Beni, Ash and Berta were the best with service quality and friendliness. Extra thanks to Beni for looking after us. 

Breakfast crew were very attentive and generally the entire hotel staff ensured our stay was an amazing experience. 

We return to Australia with fond memories and will let everyone know to stay at the Claris Hotel, Barcelona.

Gracias. 🙏🏾❤️",5,2022,08,26
19,Stolen items from my room in Claris Hotel,"Hotel to avoid: Two of my personal items have been stolen from my room. I reported it to the reception but unfortunately their service was very poor as well as the cleaning service. This is actually the worst 5 star hotel experience I have ever had. I called the reception multiple times before being robbed in the final days to tell them about bathrobes not being replaced or mini-bar or even the coffee machine not working. 
Also, as it seems I'm not the only person facing such robbery issues as I talked with other clients and heard someone that the receptionist called to give him back his stuff.
This is shameful for a luxury hotel.",2,2022,08,25
19,Woww a service at this hotels.,"Top nice hotel-and prima service.
Pool at the roof top--and lovely room at the grand suite duplex.
Lovely restaurants nearby and lots off shops--Passeig de Gracia nearby
If you want value for money then book this lovely hotel :-)",5,2022,08,22
19,Luxury hotel in the heart of the city…,An excellent place to stay within walking distance of lots of the sights. Welcoming and helpful staff from the start. Parking facilities. A very good restaurant with room service as well. Would recommend the VIP breakfast! Fantastic suite.,5,2022,08,20
19,Claris Hotel and spa Mounument,"Excellent care and service. Stayed at Claris Hotel  Barcelona for 7 days.
And breakfast was great our waiter Jimmy took care of our order above and beyond on so little time he knew what we liked always smiling and asking if everything is ok. It made our day a lot easier Jimmy was very kind.
Thank you Jimmy. My daughter loved the pancakes and hot chocolate.",5,2022,08,17
19,I didn’t feel valued,3 night stay at the Claris. For the first day and a half my room air conditioner didn’t work. I notified the front desk and they attempted to fix it not once not twice but three times. Because my room felt like a sauna I couldn’t sleep that first night because it was so hot.  I called world of Hyatt customer service the next day for support and they advocated to get my room changed. However even after the hotel staff was told by customer service to change my room the staff resisted In putting me into a new room they wanted to try and fix it a forth time. I just wanted a new room and this ruined 1/2 of the 2nd day in Barcelona. Because of the resistance my site seeing of famous landmarks in Barcelona was ruined I missed my reservation at the Park Guell. There was one worker who was the main resistance he was very disrespectful and unprofessional. When they finally gave me my new room the air conditioner work! But my television didn’t work. I called and they said ok but after 5 hours no one came up to fix it. I called a 2nd time after the staff change and the tv finally got fixed. I don’t recommend staying at this place because of the very poor customer service.  I don’t know if I was being ethnically profiled/ prejudice. ,1,2022,08,16
19,GREAT STAY,we had a lovely stay at Claris Spa Hotel. The hotel is perfectly situated in Barcelona to be able to access the main sightseeing activities. Bus routes are accessible to travel to the beach and the hotel is extremely helpful with accessing taxis or other forms of transport. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling for holiday to Barcelona and we will definitely be back!,5,2022,08,16
19,Highly recommended,"Really enjoyed the stay at the Claris Barcelona.  Great location, lovely staff & beautiful hotel.  If your looking for a decent gym probably not for you but in terms of location and quality of rooms hard to beat.  Link to Egyptian antiquity an added bonus",5,2022,08,13
19,Great hotel,"We were in Barcelona for a 4 day vacation after our week long cruise.  Arrived July 31 and stayed until August 4th.  The people were very nice, the complimentary breakfast was so good that we didn't have to spend money on lunch.

Complimentary mini bar stocked with water, coke and beer was a great addition as well.",5,2022,08,12
19,Do not hesitate to book a stay,"Great location, beautiful rooms, helpful staff and has anyone mentioned that everyone who works here looks like a model.  My family had a great three night stay.  We had 2 duplex rooms.  Each one had a different design but both were great.  We used the rooftop pool in the late afternoon each day.  Great cocktails (service a bit slow) and a great spot to unwind after a day of sightseeing.",5,2022,08,10
19,Excellent service and loaction,The service at this hotel is outstandig. You feel welcome the moment you get to the door. Check in was a bit slow. We booked a suite and the room was beautiful. Free minibar and even complimentary bottle of cava on the day we arrived. Location is great. The suite was supposed to be sooundproof which is absolutely wrong. We woke up early every morning due to much noise in the hallway and the room was not sound proof at all. Nice rooftop bar and restaurant but quite expensive. Expected more noise cancelling room of a 5 star hotel.,4,2022,08,08
19,Beautiful hotel and excellent service,"Service and staff were excellent, I had the best stay at Claris during my Barcelona trip. Clean, nice, good location, nice sheets and comfortable bed, beautiful marble tiled bathroom. Could not ask for more.",5,2022,08,06
19,Ideal base for exploring the city,An ideal base from which to spend a few days exploring Barcelona as only a few minutes walk from several of the key places to visit. The roof terrace and pool provide an ideal place to spend a couple of hours enjoying the sun between sightseeing and dinner and we found ourselves returning there for a relaxed nightcap above the bustle of the city to end the day. The hotel was very clean and the staff helpful. The complimentary mini bar (mainly non-alcoholic but with a couple of beers) was appreciated in the warm weather. We only had the standard restaurant breakfast once - it was OK but we found more creative and cost-effective alternatives in small local cafés.,5,2022,08,01
19,Not a 5 star. Very average.,"Not 5 star

This hotel is a disappointment. Not 5 star. Should not be part of a luxury collection of hotels. 

Rooms appear very dated. Walls need to be painted. Looks dirty. May be clean but the decor makes it appear dark and dingy. 

There are many other hotels to stay in Barcelona that are 5 star. Stay elsewhere.",3,2022,07,29
19,"Average room, poor service","We booked a junior suite duplex through luxury escapes. Unfortunately the room did not look like the pictures on the website, so we asked to change room. There were no other rooms available until the next day after 3pm, which was disappointing as we were only there for two nights. The room we were upgraded to wasn’t much better! 

On our second night there was an extremely loud party who came into the hotel at 6am and woke us up by shouting and playing very loud music. We called reception twice to ask them to have a word but the noice continued. When we told the reception desk about this the next day, they told us we should have called a third time! Generally the service was pretty hit and miss for the three days that we were there. 

On a more positive note, the spa and staff in the spa were very good.   

I wouldn’t stay here again. ",2,2022,07,26
19,Good location with excellent service,"Stayed in July for 2 nights. Location is good, 3-4 mins walk to center. Have lot of restaurants nearby.

We got upgraded to Duplex suite as we were traveling with a kid. 

Overall, very nice experience and staff was helpful. 

Recommend this hotel if you want a boutique style hotel. 

Also to mention, the pool area and restaurant had one of the best view in city.",4,2022,07,23
19,Excellent Service,"From the first moment of being greeted by a team to help with luggage, offer a drink etc. the staff is top notch.  There was always a friendly face in the lobby to offer an umbrella, or help with directions.  
I was especially touched when the hotel sent a complimentary bottle of bubbles to make my birthday a bit more special!",5,2022,07,16
19,Could be worst service in Europe!,"We stayed at the Claris in Barcelona for 4 nights. Far from a five star hotel! The Service was atrocious with rooms only serviced close on 17:00 daily. Impossible to get a lounger at the pool ever. Not enough linen in the hotel and have had to wait 45 minutes to get shower towels. 

In addition to this, we chose this hotel as along with the location, it marketed having a gym. The gym is a tiny “glass box” on the roof of hotel that is unusable! At a reasonable hour in summer, it is simply way too hot and not functional. 

I have flagged our concerns with the rooms division manager, Alessio Rinella who did nothing to address our concerns but rather justified it on the basis that rooms are often cleaned up to 18:00 daily. 

There are far better hotels to stay at it Barcelona and I wouldn’t recommend staying at Hotel Claris.",1,2022,07,13
19,Great hotel for a few days in Barcelona.,"A wonderful hotel in a very central location. The staff are incredibly helpful. The welcome champagne on arrival was a lovely touch. Stunning roof top pool area and bar. The rooms are comfortable, with a lovely bath. I would really recommend this hotel as nothing is too much trouble. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly.",4,2022,07,12
19,Amazing hotel!!!,Amazing hotel! I would always use this hotel in the future and can recommend it very highly. Staff have been fantastic. Very clean and great facilities. Roof top pool is fabulous. Valet parking also part of the service. Location is perfect as it’s very close to the designer shops and main sites.,5,2022,07,10
19,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"We loved this hotel. It is in a lovely location and even has a rooftop pool and bar. The rooms were stunning. We had a suite with an upstairs loft area, which was just beautiful. The art in the room is so unique! In fact the hotel itself is like a work of art. 
We found the service to be friendly and efficient and will recommend it to anyone who is visiting Barcelona. 
Thank you for a great stay in Barcelona.",5,2022,07,10
19,Amazing break,"Currently on our last day at Hotel Claris and it is one of the best hotels I've stayed at.  The room is amazing is junior suite duplex and the staff that work here are so polite and helpful.  

The rooftop bar is lovely where the staff are on hand to get you drinks and are always smiling.

My partner has promised to bring me back here because we love it so much, just wish we could have stayed here longer 

The hotel isn't far from the main attractions and the furthest we have walked is to park guell which was about 40 minutes

I have seen reviews saying the pool isn't good but I disagree, it is a perfect size for the amount of people who sit on the rooftop.

Thank you Hotel Claris",5,2022,06,30
19,Absolutely outstanding hotel!,"We’re on our last day of our stay at dvd Claris Hotel & Spa and have found it absolutely faultless! We booked a Grand Suite as we found this to be not much difference in price to the smaller rooms. The suite is stunning! I had seen photos of the two storey suites online but wasn’t sure if they were the grand suite or not. When we arrived I was thrilled to see this is what we had been allocated. The bed is very comfortable and the upstairs bathroom is sublime with beautiful decoration. A bonus to have another shower room downstairs. We ate out each evening and came back to the roof terrace for cocktails and a few tapas. I don’t know what the reviews are talking about when they complain about the service. It’s exemplary! We will definitely stay again in the future. It’s also a great central location with everything in easy reach. Book with confidence, you won’t be disappointed! 💙💙",5,2022,06,28
19,Lovely people,The Claris is a hotel and a museum in one. Rooms and facilities are sprinkled with Pre-Columbian art in a tasteful way. The staff are really the treasures of this hotel though. Everyone was cheerful and extremely helpful. Local attractions are generally walkable. La Sagrada Familia is close as is the stop for the hop on- hop off bus.,5,2022,06,20
19,Is it really 5 star?,"We stayed here as it has a lovely location. Great welcome from the doormen on arrival, the rooms felt small but to be expected in a city hotel. Housekeeping were top notch. 
The down side is the catering and pool. Dinner was less than special, food was average and service stretched for example we got warm sparkling water.
The pool is a car crash, very little room, hard to find service. I tried to get a coffee 3 times on 3 occasions and was either blanked or told table service only, I went to the bar because they never came near the sun area 
All in all it uis a good hotel but avoid the resturant and pool. Go to Josephine's across the road (breakfast and or dinner)",3,2022,06,19
19,A Gem in the Heart of Barcelona,"One of the best hotels that i’ve stayed in a while. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. You are greeted with a glass of champagne from the moment you step in. The room we were staying at was very spacious, clean and comfy. The hotel is in a very central location. You are a couple block away from Passeig de gracia and further down La rambla. Would 10/10 recommend and visit again!",5,2022,06,19
19,Top tier hotel!,"This was the perfect stay, location, and comfort. We have never stayed in something this luxurious and the premium customer service was out of this world. So incredibly clean and the decor was a piece of art. ",5,2022,06,17
19,Ok experience. Service excellent.,"Service was excellent, as was the shower and water pressure and we liked breakfast. The rooms are smaller than they appear online. While they do quote square feet, our bedroom was configured to create a tight squeeze to get to one side of the bed. the bedroom itself was positioned on an inner hotel wall so the window faced the elevator and other rooms. It was very loud at night as you could hear the restaurant above. 

We didn’t have shampoo. Room service food was ok. 

Overall it was about 100 € over priced for what we received.",4,2022,06,17
19,Excellent hotel and great location,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful with an amazing rooftop pool, tapas bar and restaurant! The staff is exceptional and were happy to help with any and all requests. The bedding was wonderful! The only drawback was the lack of English TV channels, but who needs to watch TV when you're in Barcelona!",5,2022,06,06
19,Substandard by many measures,"Air conditioning in room did not work two of the nights we were there. The gym is substandard by any measure. Breakfast is served in a dingy utilitarian room. Concierge made recommendations to mediocre restaurants with extortionate prices. Overall substandard by many measures, overpriced but good location. I would not this recommend hotel.",1,2022,06,06
19,great location  completly overpriced,"Front desk and concierge, Have minimal customer service skills .  They Forget to book our covid test.  three requests for information went unanswered.  They refused to give me the credit (for bar and food) listed on the confirmation.  Room was decorated for show not comfort,  to much room taken up with statues and art.  No closet space.  Location was great.  Doormen where fabulous and friendly.  Just not worth the price when the Mandarin Orient is just down the street for a comparable price.",2,2022,06,05
19,A lovely boutique hotel with charm and wamth,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Hotel Claris. The service was fantastic, the room was beautiful and comfortable, and the rooftop pool and bar were excellent. Plus, the location can't be beat. Their spa is truly a relaxing retreat and they have nice treatments for kids too (which my daughter loved - Augustina took great care of her). Overall, my family and I greatly enjoyed our stay at the Claris and we would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Barcelona.",5,2022,06,03
19,Long weekend,"3 of us stayed here for 4 nights in a junior suite and had a perfect stay.
The hotel is in an excellent central  location,spotlessly clean and has very attentive staff and a complimentary minibar,we stayed room only but did pay for breakfast on one of the mornings and found a large choice all with very fresh ingredients.
Our room was not initially set up for 3 guests with only 2 of everything in the room but within 5 minutes of a call to reception the issue was resolved.
The only other concern we had with the room was there is no door to the bathroom and although when the shower door opens it  partially covers the gap it did make it difficult to relax in the jacuzzi bath as you can be seen.
This is not an issue for couples but for friends sharing a room it felt a bit uncomfortable.
All the staff were very pleasant and accommodating.",4,2022,06,02
19,Outstanding!,"We stayed in two Barcelona hotels and one in Madrid this trip, and Claris was far and away the best. The value was incredible. The staff were exceptional. The location can't be beat. I will only stay here in Barcelona now and look forward to visiting others in the collection. ",5,2022,05,30
19,Wonderful Hotel,"We were on a Trans- Atlantic Cruise ( NY to Barcelona )  We spent a week at this Hotel. Room was great, staff went above and beyond. Roof top restraunt & bar were top notch. I would stay there again , if we were ever back in town",5,2022,05,28
19,Barcelona delight,"Hotel Claris was fantastic.  From the reception, the room, housekeeping, rooftop pool and restaurant, and breakfast.  In fact, best hotel breakfast ever!  And, location was perfect - great access, easy walking, not too noisy.  We will be back!",5,2022,05,25
19,High Quality HQ for Barcelona Adventuring,"From the perspective of a Hyatt Globalist: This was my first stay at a SLH hotel booked through Hyatt. We were supposed to stay 8 nights on points, but only stayed 7 due to United Airlines snafus. I was not aware that I do not get full Globalist benefits with SLH (that's on me). I was told we were ""upgraded"". It was a very small room, but a good floor and view, so I assume that was the upgrade.  The superior room is very small and may not be sufficient for those on longer stays, but we made it work.

PROS:
ALL the staff were very professional and friendly. All front of house staff, breakfast staff, and the staff on the rooftop. The maid service was great, and we got turn down service every night.  The hotel is in a great location. You can walk to most tourist destinations. All the best shopping in the city is near by (Gracia street) if that is your thing, and there are lots of good places to eat, all though it is a touristy area. The room had a minibar with complimentary beer,water, juices, restocked every day. Also a nespresso machine.

The free breakfast for Hyatt members was not overwhelming, but we found it to be perfect for us. It is simple, yet very high quality. There are different selections available to be ordered (eggs, pancakes, etc) and a selection of breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, fruits. The dining room is also very nice and comfortable.

There is a taxi stand directly across from the hotel and we were able to get a Taxi at a moments notice whenever we wanted one. 

CONS:
The hotel is a renovated old aristocratic residence from 1889. You will hear upstairs footsteps, flushing next door, etc.  The wifi at our room location was pretty bad. Rooms are small. Beds are small (not a king bed in lots of rooms, check your booking)",4,2022,05,23
19,Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"We spent 5 nights at Claris Hotel & Spa.  Great location, immaculate hotel and professional yet friendly staff.  
There was a good choice of menu for breakfast and we had one lunch at the roof top terrace restaurant which was delicious.  
The pool area is small but we managed to get loungers when we wanted them (there are only 7).
We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,20
19,Lovely small boutique hotel,Excellent hotel - lovely rooms and ammenities.  Only complaint was check in - delayed over an hour after travelling all night - MANY guests waiting for rooms - not a good start to our visit!  Bed was very comfortable and we very much enjoyed roof top terrace!,4,2022,05,18
19,Quick Trip to Barcelona,"The hotel is lovely and well located.  Our room was perfectly nice for what we needed.  My only issue - and it is relatively minor - is with the cleaning staff logistics.  Our room was across from the stairwell and space the cleaning staff used to organize servicing the rooms.  There appeared to be no effort to be quiet even with “do not disturb” signs displayed.  There was a lot of shouting, moving equipment, slamming doors… as if it wasn’t a hotel with guests in the rooms.  On the one day we wanted to sleep in,  this kind of messed up the morning.  ",4,2022,05,17
19,Week end break,"Location is excellent, hotel really nice and comfortable. Staff very helpful and friendly. The food across the road at Josephine's was really good also. A nightcap at the roof top bar to end your evening highly recommended",5,2022,05,16
19,"A uniquely designed hotel that’s worth a visit, even if you don’t plan a stay.","The lobby is gorgeous & has a luxurious scent to it! The hotel rooms is showing it’s age but they have great taste in decor and furnishing that makes this hotel unique to its own. The manager appears unfriendly but the concierge (Marta), the staffs at the breakfast lounge and the bellhop (Oscar) makes it a 5-star luxury experience. I myself work in the luxury hospitality sector exclusively for high net-worth clients so I can validate this with my expertise.",5,2022,05,07
19,Perfect hotel for a weekend gateway,"Everything was perfect during our stay; the staff at the reception, terrace restaurant, breakfast and spa is nice, kind and always ready to make you feel the most important person on earth. The hotel style is unique, you are surrounded by beautiful pieces of Art everywhere. ",5,2022,05,06
19,As advertised- beautiful w/ super helpful staff,My wife and I began a vacation here end of April and we agree with the majority of positive reviews. Beautiful facility/rooms and super helpful staff. The porters were especially friendly and enthusiastic in their efforts to help us. The neighborhood is great with high end shops and restaurants abound. Complementary admission to the Egyptian museum was a bonus.  We are in our 50’s  and walking to La Ramblas and Sangrata Familia was 20+ minutes- but there is a metro line 1.5 blocks away that will take you to Las Ramblas. When retuning at the end of a day we looked forward to a glass of cava in the lobby!  We would definitely return!!,5,2022,04,27
19,Beautiful Hotel Lacking Customer Service,"The hotel is beautiful the location is great!  The customer service is non existent. Omg all the things that went wrong and they just didn’t care!  Day 1 leave my bags there had a tour. That was great. I really liked the woman that checked me in. No clue her name as opposed to the Kimpton, where everyone told you their name, I found this hotel snooty and they acted like I was a problem. Anyway the lady who checked me in was nice,  I gave her my bags then ran out the door for a tour. 4 hours later I arrive back get my bags get my keys go to the room and the keys don’t work. Did I say I was tired. So I carry all my stuff downstairs to wait in line and get new keys. Not much sorry going on!    So later I stop at desk to ask about Covid test. Only time is 11 am for 80 EU😱. I ask where I can get. He tells me but tried to show me on map. I ask 3 times if he can print out for me he does. I got the test for 35 EU 2 blocks away .   I then ask the woman who checked me in about breakfast. She checks my Hyatt account says I have complimentary breakfast that starts at 7:30. I told her I have a tour at 8.  She says you can run in and get something. So I go down and wait for breakfast to open. I get a coffee and a juice and leave. No time for much else.   Upon checkout the man was charging me some 25 EU for breakfast. I had to argue with him to remove. 

One day 1 at evening I asked one of the gentleman to make me a reservation. We do for 8:30 on Monday night.  I get up from bed at 8 dress for dinner walk to restaurant where they inform me I have no reservation. I go back to hotel the man that made the reservation remembered making the reservation. Which I heard him make. He really wasn’t upset about it. No apologies pretty much nothing.   Makes me a new reservation for a different place 3 blocks away. 

Day 2. Monserrate I’m gone from 7:45 am to 3 pm. I get back. I’m tired. We hiked 5 miles with 2000 ft gain.  My key doesn’t work!!!!  I go back down inform them my key doesn’t work. They make me a new one after I answer all the questions.  New keys go to room. Nothing has been cleaned. I’ve been gone all day. I’m tired. I change my clothes lay down for a nap. And 40 mins later they are knocking on my door to clean my room.  😱. So I get up go to the desk and ask about shopping. The woman helps me. 

Come back at 6. I’m still exhausted. I decide to go back to bed and get some rest before I need to get up for my reservation so I doze off about 6:30 to be woken up again at 7:30 for turn down service. Ok restaurants don’t open till 8. Wtf are you disturbing people when they are getting rest or preparing for dinner.  Just horrible. 

Checkout. I go down at 6:30 the man’s trying to charge me for breakfast. Can’t print my covid cause it’s s Screenshot. Can’t order me s taxi and can’t just charge stuff to my room that the woman took my card for when getting to hotel. 

Never ever did anyone apologize or try to make anything g right. Horrible customer service.",2,2022,04,26
19,Totally worth the Price,"The personnel, services and location of the hotel make this place  a gem! It is close to everything and the staff is amazing, we felt at home! Thank you for making our vacation so memorable!
Yasmin- NY USA",5,2022,04,18
19,The Place to Stay in Barcelona,"We spent three separate weekends at the Claris during February and April and each time it just got better. Sadly our first visit was due to a bereavement and the empathy of the staff was simply overwhelming.
The Staff from the person who meets you at the door to the check in are professional, more than helpful and welcoming. and when you want any recommendation for food, shopping or just information the knowledgeable staff not only gave an great choice but made sure there was a reservation for you. Nothing is too much trouble
All the staff have managed to get the balance just right between the elegance of a 5 star hotel and the warmth of a valued guest. The rooms are specious, the beds comfortable and our rooms had everything you needed including a Nexpresso machine for coffee.
The breakfast was excellent and I would definitely recommend the 'breakfast-included' package. If you are taking your car use the parking option its simple and makes the stress out of arrival and departure. We did not eat at the restaurant but the menu on display was quite reasonable  
This is now our “go to” hotel in Barcelona!",5,2022,04,04
19,ok,"Overall good hotel but I wouldnt give it 5 stars due to the lack of customer care by the leading manager.  Also one should know that you buy a spare service if you want to go to spa, which is hilarious. ",4,2022,03,29
19,Stay at the Claris Hotel & Spa in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed for several days mid-March and it was lovely.  The staff were courteous and responsive, the hotel modern and well-kept. The rooms and beds were comfortable, incredibly clean and had everything needed including a Nexpresso machine for coffee.  We did not use the Spa or restaurant facilities so I can't comment there, but the breakfast was excellent - I would definitely recommend the 'breakfast-included' package.  This hotel is within easy walking distance of La Rambla, the water-front and several Gaudi attractions - so very well positioned. ",5,2022,03,28
19,Amazing hotel,"I love this hotel, with good food, a perfect location and an amazing staff.  So very professional, helpful and friendly. I will definitely come back soon and I highly recommend this hotel. Thank you for making our weekend trip so wonderful.",5,2022,03,21
19,A delightful hotel to escape the city,"While some people come to Barcelona for the architecture and incredible gastronomy, I usually come to escape my day-to-day life (and I live not too far so it's a regular destination for me) and when I do, I always like staying at a hotel that can provide me with everything I might need for my escape, starting with a great service, an outstanding spa and comfortable rooms. Luckily for me, the Claris Hotel has all that and more! It is perfectly located in the city to be close to all major attractions but just slightly out of the action to be calm and it offers one of the best rooftops in Barcelona. It's not the first time I come to this hotel and it definitely won't be the last. ",5,2022,02,28
19,Best Hotel I stayed at,"I'd enjoyed this hotel. This was the second 5 start Hotel I stayed at and it was great. The staff and butlers were extremely helpful, convenient, and extremely respectful. Many spoke English as well and there were no language barrier. The maid was very good at cleaning and consistent. I also loved the pool on the rooftop and the environment on the rooftop; hopefully, next time I come it will be warm enough to swim. ",5,2022,02,26
19,3 days in Barcelona,"Not a 5* Hotel, nice lobby and that's it. Rooms are old and small. No SPA included, Sauna is rated as treatment. Refrigreator was not refilled. ""Steambath"" in the ""Gym"" (both are a joke) smelled strongly of mold. ",2,2022,02,22
19,AMAZING ROOM + SERVICE,"Stayed here in the duplex grand suite- one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in and priced very reasonably. Service from the reception staff is impeccable- every single time we called to ask for anything it arrived almost instantly. 

Would recommend to anyone staying in Barcelona",5,2022,02,04
19,Excellent stay,We stayed at the Claris Hotel for 3 nights. They upgraded us to a Junior suite room because we celebrated a milestone birthday. They also allowed us to store and charge the scooters we rented in the Hotel. They also created us with fine champagne inside the our room. We didn’t get to drink to champagne but decided to give it to our favorite hospitality person Mario who works at the Terraza del Claris Hotel. He made our stay even more special.,5,2022,01,20
19,Amazing,"A wonderful stay in this amazing hotel. Very professional staff, in particular José was so accommodating each night and made the most delicious cocktails. José prepared great cocktails and deserts to our room.",5,2022,01,11
19,Pay staff more - they are worht it,"stayed here for 2 weeks over NYE 21-22. staff we're ace though obvs they need to be paid more. they were doing their best despit minimal mngmt efforts.

Most room serive was great, though sometimes they seemed too busy despite low occupancy, they always did their best,

I think staff should unionize. I think management should realise they operate at the discretion of us all, clients and staff, and they are the servents. 

Everyone deserves more than a living wage. shareholders need to respect the workers, and more needs to ""trikle down"" here or the enterprise risks deestruction from the clients.",4,2022,01,06
19,Beautiful Hotel. Poorly managed.,"Plumbing issues in our sink, bath tub and shower. No maintenance on staff. 

Poor housekeeping. Blood stain on our sheets, and thick layer of dust under our bed indicating that it hadn't been cleaned in months. Only received turn down service on our second night, after complaining that our room hadn't been cleaned at all.

COVID test was improperly scheduled by the front desk and I almost missed my flight home due to their error. 

With the exception of few, staff is unapologetic for their incompetence. It's a beautiful property but management is severely lacking. After all we suffered, we were only offered 15% off of our room service charges. They then did not apply it to all charges, so we only got a $7 discount. It was more offensive than if they had done nothing at all. There are plenty of beautiful hotels in the world. Avoid this one.",1,2021,12,23
19,Lovely unique hotel,"Lovely, luxurious art hotel in the center of Barcelona! Beautiful decor super comfortable and clean. The breakfast was amazing lots of healthy food options and great for vegetarians and vegans. The spa was a unique experience and reasonable prices which include free use of a  private sauna ",5,2021,12,14
19,Thank you!,"For sure, the Suite Duplex is not the best option and this charming hotel has got much better rooms...in terms of climate control and bathroom practicality, it was not the best choice. Rest of the topics, quite good.",4,2021,12,13
19,Top Tier Service,I had a great stay at Claris in Barcelona recently. Mesitxell and Carlos were my main points of contacts and really appreciate the assistance they provided throughout my stay. I look forward to visiting the hotel again in the near future.,5,2021,12,12
19,Good but could be GREAT,"We stayed at the Claris Hotel on November 19 and 20, 2021.  Prior to that we stayed two nights at the Cotton House Hotel.

Reception: Reception was excellent.  I appreciated that the persons at reception did not force English upon me but indulged my attempt to improve my Spanish.  They were patient and helpful.  This is one reason we are really considering returning to this hotel.

Room:  We rented the two level suite.  Great historic decor.  Could use a bit of paint here and there.  Cool room though and I would recommend it.  Our room smelled of smoke from the prior guest and lower level shower (this had upstairs and downstairs full bathrooms) flooded each time I used it (clogged drain) but I would still try this same room type again.

Facilities: This place is cool!  Walk through it even if you don't stay.  A prior castle, I think, that has been completely remodeled.  One of the most architecturally, and design, unique places we have stayed.

Service:  The rooftop bar SHOULD be a highlight.  The service at this place was so dismissive and nonchalant (particularly the older camerero) that we decided to NEVER eat within our hotel again.  That is not a problem since there is no less than hundreds of restaurants within a five minute walk (or closer).

Location: The best you can get!  The ""gold coast"" of Barcelona.  FENDI,  CHANNEL etc are within a stones throw (if you like that type of thing).  Best part of being in such an exclusive neighborhood is the feeling of safety and also the quality of the plethora of restaurants.

Overall this experience was VERY GOOD.  Could have been GREAT were it not for service issues on roof restaurant and some minor room issues.  We would stay here again and just plan on a different room type and not eating at the hotel.",4,2021,11,22
19,Wonderful Hotel,"We arrived for a week stay in Barcelona and was staright away upgraded to a Junior suite room, 116 which was so big and very comfortable facing the street but was very quiet,The staff from the front desk to the Breakfast services all that we came in contact with were surperb helpful.Well done to you all.a well positioned hotel with in walking distance to the High streets and Marina.",5,2021,11,18
19,Amazing Hotel,"Simply love this hotel. Great location, staff, rooms and so clean. I would 100% recommend the Claris and will use it for all my future visits. Have already re-booked for December. The Roof top terrace is the cherry on the cake with this hotel.  ",5,2021,11,12
19,Nice hotel but expected a little more for a 5*,Nice hotel. Wonderful Spa. But lacking some basics in the room eg kettle /coffee/tea making facilities although rooms are beautiful and unique. Restaurants/bar lack any atmosphere so maybe not the best place for solo travellers. I looked elsewhere for breakfast after day one and unable to get a pot of strong coffee. Most attractions walkable within 30 mins. Concierge and reception staff very helpful/friendly.,4,2021,11,03
19,Not really a five star hotel,"I’ve stayed in hotel Claris in beautiful Barcelona, for three nights, with service option BB, together with my friend.
The hotel location is good, in the city center, but standard room for two person was smaller than usual. The bathroom amenities were poor - for instance - two shower gel bottles were so small that it couldn’t be used for shower niether one person properly, and we got two of these in total (per day), so we need to purchase additional shower gel. The bad was pretty comfortable, though. Wi-fi is available but with not the same strength in the whole hotel… so sometimes in the room was really poor. The breakfast  was ok, but with the same offer during the whole our stay ( not big choice of fruit and pastry), not really typical for five star hotel.
The hotel staff is pleasent but willing to assist and to provide support only during your stay - if you have any problem in addition - don’t count! The same comment is for managment staff.
For instance, I’ve unfortunatelly forgotten my shirt ( not an ordinary one) but while we were exiting our room to do check out, cleaning lady was finishing the room next to ours, and entered ours, as soon as we got out.
I have realised that I’ve forgotten my shirt as soon as I got back home - the same day - and urgently contacted hotel. The response I got that day and next ten days was they ‘ve found nothing and finally they are confident in their cleaning staff. They didn’t want to consider the option of eventual compensation  in any way, and didn’t want to assist further.
So, if you decide to visit this definitely NOT FIVE STAR hotel, take good care about your belongings, if you don’t want to miss them in future.
I certainly won’t visit it again!",2,2021,10,29
19,Excellent Hotel. Perfect location!,"This hotel has incredible service, the food and the terrace has a good atmosphere.The cleaning service is impeccable and all the staff is available with the best energy to collaborate in whatever you need. I would definitely returned without any doubt. ",5,2021,10,28
19,Very good hotel for the price but some things could be improved.,"The hotel is in a great location and my room was very nice. The cleaning service was consistent and the bar on the roof too was cute. Internet was intermittent and spotty and the front desk didn’t do anything to help. The help desk that called me was a joke and not listening to the issue, which I am sure was bandwidth and poor coverage in certain locations of the hotel. This forced me to work from the rooftop where internet was solid. 

My checking was good and the person who checked me in was very nice. He did offer me my Expedia gold perks and gave me a nice room upgrade. ",4,2021,10,24
19,Magnificent Hotel,"We enjoyed one glorious week in this great hotel. From the moment we entered the lobby we felt that staff had a very dedicated and guest-centric approach. Nothing was too much trouble for them and each time, service with a genuine smile!",5,2021,10,19
19,Exceptional attention,"This was our wedding night and the front desk staff were so attentive, offering an upgrade to our initial reservation. We enjoyed every bit of our stay, helping make our wedding all the more special. Thanks!",5,2021,10,02
19,"Exceptional Service, impeccable rooms","We Prepaid for a luxury suite and recurve a warm welcome from the doorman to the desk host, however the night didn't go as planned.  The guests in the adjacent room were beyond vocal and clearly intended to sleep by day.  Fortunately we were relocated and upgraded.  The room was a treat. I think that Claris made every effort to make up for our lost sleep and rude neighbors.  It's centrally located and impeccable.  I would say that Jimmy and his breakfast staff made our mornings absolutely 'perfecto'. Charming and delightful, the breakfast is outstanding. Everything is fresh and carefully prepared. My 4 comes with a caveat, you must know that you're in a busy city and will hear city noises wherever you stay.",4,2021,09,28
19,Don’t go there if you are a light sleeper and like to be treated fairly!,"Don’t go there if you are a light sleeper!
They say that the rooms are sound proofed, but that is not the case.
We have spent 10 days at this hotel and told the staff from day one that the elevator was making a horrible noise that woke me up several times at night. Nothing happened. I have told them that I can hear my neighbors TV, and all they did is to offer me a room that was in between two other rooms and half the size of our suite. I told them the laundry cart woke me up every morning because it was squeaking loudly. Nothing was done...
At the end of our expensive prepaid stay we asked the manager for a partial refund. He was rude, didn’t take us serious and was not sorry. The only thing he offered us was a late check out and a 5 euro bottle of alcohol.
The hotel and most of the staff is nice, but not worth the prime rate per night.
When I tryed to contact the main office, the online form did not work at all. Seems like they don’t care about their customers.
So if you are looking for a luxury and quiet place to stay in Barcelona, don’t go there!",1,2021,09,19
19,There are plenty of other nice hotels!,"The hotel was lovely, location is great and there are plenty of nice restaurants around. We requested a large bed on the booking and confirmation of this request was sent to us by the hotel, however, on arrival we were advised we could only have a twin room with two single beds unless we paid to upgrade. We chose the executive room anyway so not the cheapest. If the hotel doesn’t have the room we booked available then they shouldn’t charge guests 40€ a night extra for the privilege. The handling of this was a disappointment especially at the start of your holiday.

In summary, hotel is nicely decorated, staff or friendly and location is great, definitely not worth the rates especially when taking in to account “paying for another upgrade” which for us cost around £300/£350 more on arrival.",3,2021,09,19
19,"Nice hotel, good location","Nice and modern hotel almost in the city center. Most attractions are within walking distance. The rooftop bar and restaurant is currently one of the most trendy places in Barcelona - fully booked on a Thursday evening. Underground parking next door, friendly and attentive staff... only the bathroom of my executive room was a little small",5,2021,09,17
19,Great location and decent stay overall,"We recently stayed here for our first holiday in 19months and wanted to make sure we had a luxury 5* hotel.
The location is perfect, just one road off Passeig de Gracia where all the main shops/restaurants/cafes are found in the Gothic Quarter.

We really enjoyed using the hotel facilities including the rooftop pool. Pool and sun beds were a great bonus, however staff never seemed to take orders so we had to go over to the indoor bar area, where prices were astronomical. €6.50 for a 300ml coke or €14.50 for amaretto and coke! Las Vegas prices but this is certainly not on the level of Vegas so felt they were taking the mick here. There was also no access to clean towels on either trip to the pool.

Service was fantastic overall and we felt looked after by the highly trained and friendly staff. The only real problem we had was the noise. The room we originally had looked out onto the main road and even at 1am on a Sunday all we could hear was the traffic and beeping horns. Staff were great though as soon as we mentioned this to them in the morning they immediately changed rooms for an equivalent on the other side of the hotel and we had no noise at all here.
One other thing I would mention is the beds are very hard/stiff and staff mentioned they have the same beds in all rooms including suites etc.

Overall a great stay in a great location but not enough to give 5*",4,2021,09,01
19,Great Barcelona Hotel,"We stayed at the Claris hotel primarily because we got a great deal , it had a swimming pool on the roof and it was in the area we wanted to stay in Barcelona.

The hotel is very clean ,
and stylized and the service throughout is excellent .

The pool on the roof was a great place to relax after a day of exploring the city and the roof bar and restaurant were excellent . 

The breakfast was first class and the room had a real boutique feel to it .

I will use this hotel again the next time I come to Barcelona .",5,2021,08,31
19,Excellent Hotel,"We were booked at a different Derby Hotel and at the last minute we’re moved for unknown reasons to this hotel. We hit the jackpot. This is truly a 5 star hotel. The location is excellent, the rooms are fabulous and the service is top notch. Love it!",5,2021,08,31
19,Good value for your money,"Unexpected 1 night stay on s sunday when all of Barcelona is closed,.Professional welcome  great massage and wonderful rooftop pool  terrace and lounge  restaurant.

The service is very professional and the food is very good, although a little pticey 

This is a nice 5star in the city",4,2021,08,22
19,A great stay in a great hotel,"Great hotel, great staff, wonderful service.

And most of all heart melting food with no exceptions what so ever.

The sky bar is to see and a must visit.

The pool is great to just lie there and enjoy the sun,

Alessio and Dmitry have helped in such a way that made me feel like I’m the owner of the hotel. They are absolutely the masters of hospitality",5,2021,08,18
19,An “upgrade” that turned out to be a downgrade…,"We originally booked ourselves into another hotel, but we were moved to Claris due to the COVID situation. 

At first, being “upgraded” from a four to a five star hotel might seem like a good thing, but  in retrospect we would’ve much rather stayed at Granados 83,  since our last stay there was fantastic, which was also where our original booking was. 

So, overall Claris is a pretty average hotel wrapped in glamour and the whole “five star”-thing. 
Upon arrival we were received by a rather condescending receptionist, which we both agreed on on our elevator ride to our room, felt like a “ah, so you’re one of those people that were moved here”. We did however get our room before schedule, so that was a plus. He spoke extremely fast, mumbled, and just seemed like he had better things to do than be at our service, which was further emphasized in him picking up the phone 3 times, even though there were other people there to do it. Mind you that i am not in the service industry, so i don’t know if that is what one does. I tried talking with him a few times but he never actually responded to anything i said. As i said, felt like we were a burden. 

The rooms were pretty, but not very practical. Big, but we had two single beds squished into one, which we’d specifically asked for in our original room reservation. They were also not very comfortable, and my girlfriend had to sleep on her duvet due to the hardiness of the bed. Soft/hard beds are of course subjective likings, but they were very stiff, so if that’s your thing, you’ll like it.

The rooms were also very noisy, and it was hard to fall asleep before the rooftop closed (we stayed on the 6th floor, right under the restaurant). 
Everything that happened on the hallway, the other rooms or the streets could be heard clearly. Again, soundproofing was a thing Granados 83 had. 

We had free mini bar which was really nice, since we didn’t have to buy “regular” drinking stuff like soda or juices. Refilled every day by a very sweet cleaning lady whom I would have tipped if i knew how to. 

Rooftop was great. Pool was good and a solid size (as expected for a rooftop pool) Drinks were good and the same price as in Copenhagen, but kind of expensive compared to the nearby bars and restaurants. 

Location was pretty much perfect, and the surrounding bars (Babula especially) and restaurants were top notch. 

We didn’t bother with the spa since it seemed like something that would be included in the stay to try, but ended up being 100€ for two people, which to us seemed better spent elsewhere. 

Barcelona is one of our favorite vacation cities, and we will definitely be returning; but at the moment i doubt that it will be at Claris.
First staff impression lasted the whole stay (and is still stuck with me as i’m writing this review from my couch at home) and left us not feeling welcome, which resulted in us not bothering “complaining” about the noise or the beds… 

In the end I’m sorry we were moved here from Granados, since we loved our first stay there.",3,2021,08,16
19,The service is awesome!,"The staff at the Claris is incredible!  I was staying on points and they double upgraded my room, let me check in early and treated me like a royalty!  Everyone at the front desk went far and above my expectations to help with any questions, from where to get a Covid test to how to best get around the city.  I will be back for a longer stay next time!",5,2021,08,12
19,5 STARS all the way!,"I hcant even begin to tell you how amazing this little boutique hotel is. It’s an art gallery within itself and just had hidden treasures around every corner. Not only is the hotel top notch, the staff is equally amazing. A very warm welcome with champagne and the kindest front desk staff ever! I look forward to another stay here in the very near future! Keep doing what you guys are doing, because this is well worth every penny spent here!",5,2021,08,05
19,Excellent Boutique Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Really nice hotel, excellent quality of service, rooms and hotel facilities. Location is perfect. Very good breakfast, gorgeous and cosy room, very nice pool on the rooftop. 
I definitely want to return there and csn recommend it to everyone who likes small inner city hotels with the ambition to stand out from the mainstream. ",5,2021,07,11
19,Take the good with the bad.,"I stayed for four nights after having originally booked at a 4* sister property which they opted to keep closed due to low booking volume. I totally understand that the times are different and COVID has changed the landscape for hospitality and am willing to go with the flow. I had originally booked an executive room with a balcony at the other property because sleep quality and space are of utmost importance to me; upon receiving notification that my hotel was switched to the Claris, I responded to confirm that my originally booked room type was honored, although, I did not realize that none of the rooms at the Claris have a balcony. I checked in, being exhausted from traveling, and they put me in the smallest possible room right on the street. It was dark, tight, and cave-like. The noise from traffic was just terrible and there was a clicking coming from the broken closet light, so after not being able to nap, I asked if I could be switched at least to a room away from the street. They moved me down the hall to a ""junior suite"" after having been told at check- in that they were ""Sold-out"" and I wouldn't have an option for any other room. Although the room was a little bigger and quieter, there was only a tiny little window overlooking an internal courtyard. Initially, the AC was broken, but they were able to fix it quickly.
 Here are the pros and cons as it were:
Pros:
The room was quiet and larger than a standard room (although by no means would I call it a junior suite)
The room was very clean
The bed was comfortable (very very firm)
The location was wonderful
The roof terrace had great cocktails and the pool was lovely
Customer service was good overall
The bathroom was large

Cons
The junior suite was a tight little dungeon with not much light
Storage was awkward
You could hear the upstairs neighbors flushing and walking
The toilet was super noisy

I think that my biggest issue with my experience was that I was emailed two days before check in to let me know that I was moved to the Claris to ""enjoy my stay in Barcelona at the greatest luxury""- and was asked to respond if I need additional information and approve the change. I did actually respond and my concerns were left unacknowledged until check-in. I am a fairly deliberate person in the accommodations that I book as I am claustrophobic and a very light sleeper- the room I originally booked (at their other hotel) was an upgraded room and light, bright, contemporary, and had access to outdoor space in the form of a balcony. What the Claris offered did not meet those requirements and I wish they had responded to me in advance so that I could have booked an alternative.",3,2021,07,06
19,Mobile World Congress visit,"A perfect haven in the centre of Barcelona - the staff provided a personal and friendly service unusual in a capital city hotel. 
The roof bar is perfect for reading or relaxing with friends. Breakfast is a meal not to be missed.
 The Claris is my new home from home in Barcelona.",5,2021,07,04
19,Amazing,"Worth every penny. Everyone is super nice. Amazing service, polite staff. We felt line princesses staying there. Whoever did the hiring has a good knowledge. And the hotel is breathtaking! We were so sad to leave.. ",5,2021,06,09
19,"Service 5, Facilities 5, Room 4, Smell 3","A very warm welcome to this hotel and a feel of cleanliness and safety, so important right now. Front desk staff were great, though amusingly mystified hearing me speak Catalan.

Check in was quick and hassle free, with clear guidance on rules.

The room was very good, well appointed though a little cramped around the bed. (203) In order to put anything on the bedside table you had to remove the phone and the free mobile they provide (yes, you read that right)

The shower and bath were great and the loft upstairs was excellent, although the sofa has seen better days and should be re-covered.

 Breakfast was excellent, with safe service and you run the risk of spoiling your lunch, nomatter what time you eat lunch.

In the room there was a slight smell of smoke, or fumes would be more accurate, which went after 5 minutes of aircon, I assume this is down to lack of use more than anything.

We are planning a return visit.

Oh, and eat in the Terraza, you won't be disappointed.",5,2021,05,04
19,Untrustworthy reservation procedure,"After booking a prepaid stay with my (valid and correct) credit card and receiving a booking confirmation, i receive requests by email with second payment requests. These emails look like fishing and won't be executed for security purposes. They've confirmed and got my credit card details already - there should be need for further action.",1,2021,04,13
19,Christmas ,"Thank you for the wonderful stay!
The staff was amazing, we were upgraded to the Jr Suite, the bartender brought the cocktails to the room personally and breakfast was served in the room.
Due to Covid-19 restrictions there were limited slots for meal times but the attention made up for that.

The room was very comfortable and tidy and all the hotel exposes antique art so it has a very unique feel unlike any other hotel I stayed in. 

Booking directly with the hotel, welcome treats, Spa discounts and museum entries are included so I would definitely recommend to contact the hotel via their website",5,2020,12,28
19,Amazing hotel,"Together with my family we choose the hotel Claris for a escape in Barcelona. It has been a marvelous stay in every detail. The Hotel is filled with unique pieces of artworks, the staff is highly attentive and always keen to help you. Try the breakfast, you will not be disappointed! Overall a fantastic experience.",5,2020,12,26
19,Great Customer Service,"My trip to Barcelona was cancelled due to COVID.  I was charged one night fee penalty and Hotels.com led me to believe that this was the Hotel Claris policy.  Hotel Claris manager reached out to me personally to explain the situation and offer several options for resolution.  I was not able to get a hold of hotels.com ( wasted hours trying to reach  them via phone/ chat).  As a result, Claris Hotel offered me a 12 month credit for the one night fee that I was charged.  They went above and beyond to help me and I really appreciate their quick response time.  In the future I will book with them directly instead of going through a third party.  ",5,2020,09,21
19,La Terraza del Claris - Restaurant,"I visited this hotel for the purpose of having a meal in their beautiful restaurant that is situated on the top floor terrace. The atmosphere was very pleasant, the meals were wonderful, but most of all, Jose and Ana provided excellent service and made this whole experience exceptional.",5,2020,08,31
19,Excellent location and experience! Amazing breakfast!,"I stayed at the Claris Hotel in January 2020, which feels like 3 years ago given COVID-19.  I booked directly through the website as the offers were much better than booking directly with Hyatt.  There were also perks with a direct booking, such as a bottle of Cava upon arrival.

The Claris Hotel is an on old museum and has all the charm and personality one would expect from a hotel of this type in the heart of Barcelona.  The room, while small, was perfect for two people and had everything we needed, including a fridge and nicely stocked free minibar. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom function, even though it was a huge step in and out of the tub.  Those with mobility issues should be aware of this.

The breakfast (included with the rate I booked) was the highlight of the trip.  The ambiance of the restaurant was great and the staff was even better.  Wonderful people that made you feel so welcomed!  The food was fresh and delicious with a good variety of options.  Highly recommend breakfast here! 

The rooftop pool and restaurant are really nice and provide great views.  There are a ton of fantastic restaurants in the area within walking distance or a short metro ride. 

Overall, a perfectly located hotel for a first-time visit to Barcelona!  While 5-star hotels are quite different between US/Asia standards and Europe, this is nonetheless a great hotel with a friendly staff and peaceful environment!",5,2020,07,17
19,Lovely stay with top-notch service,"The Hotel Claris has a fabulous location, only a block or two from Passeig de Gràcia. Dining choices and access to the metro could not have been better. Every single staff member we interacted with went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We were celebrating a birthday and anniversary, and we were given a room upgrade and a surprise bottle of Cava. The rooms were spotless and the complimentary minibar (beer, cokes, juice and water) was a nice touch at the end of the day. Thank you! ",5,2020,03,15
19,claris - your oasis in the heart of busy barcelona,"more than the place, it's the people who matter. and the people at claris are amazing. they made the difference. I will definitely go back, or at least, recommend this to anyone looking for a place in busy barcelona. ",5,2020,03,12
19,Great Staff and Service!,I stayed at the Claris during my last visit in late february. Positive experience in every single aspect of it. The staff is well trained and it showed sincere interest in our experience since our arrival. We were advised at the check in about useful recommendations and given a wonderful room with a lovely city view. Breakfast is absolutely delicious and the rooftop bar is cozy and glamorous. We constantly feel looked after and we will bring home some amazing memory of this little luxury gem! Looking forward to be back soon!,5,2020,03,11
19,Beautiful Hotel & Fantastic Location,"The staff at every level of contact were Amazingly competent & sincerely helpful.
With any requests of towels, restaurants or site directions we were advised with patience & care. The appointments in each room are 
beautiful & unique. Karen at the GUEST RELATIONS desk went above & beyond to make our stay most memorable.
Thank you to a very professional team .

19,Made useful very special,"Cannot praise the hotel well enough. Fantastic room, fantastic breakfast - but the Star Of The Show was the staff who made us feel very special. I have been lucky enough before retiring to have stayed in some very exclusive hotels throughout the world - the Claris is firmly in the top 5!",5,2020,03,06
19,Wonderful,"Just returned from a three night stay at Claris Hotel and had a delightful experience. All the staff are friendly, efficient and welcoming so feels like home! Spotlessly clean and tidy and room 407 was lovely with a very large queen bed that was so wonderful and comfy to sleep in. Breakfast was adequate for a day's sightseeing or exploring around Barcelona. Cereals, bread / toast, cooked for eggs and bacon, pastries, fresh fruit, cheeses and meats, whatever takes your fancy. Endless juice and coffee if desired. Wi-fi was strong, free and  available in the room. Location is excellent if travelling from the airport as RENFE stop is Passeig de Gracia on the next street corner and a short walk to Pau Claris where the hotel is situated. Very easy to find. Also location of hotel is fantastic for all the sites of Barcelona. One block from Gaudi house and ten minutes from Segrada Familia with Las Ramblas is also ten minutes the opposite direction.",5,2020,02,26
19,Lovely Hotel in Our Favorite Area of Barcelona...,"We normally like to stay in an apartment when we travel, so this was a rare time when we actually stayed in a hotel. Other than the room being a bit dark, we really liked the Claris a lot and it had everything we needed for a short stay abroad. The hotel and room were elegantly designed and the room was a comfortable size with tasteful accents. The staff we encountered (at the desk, bellman and doorman) were all quite friendly and accommodating and we were well taken care of for our stay. 

If you're a hotel person coming to Barcelona...this one's for you!",5,2020,02,24
19,Lovely staff,"Perhaps a little initial disappointment. My review is based on two adults and one 6 foot 1 inch 15 year old son. I had informed the hotel of this when we booked the junior suite. Sofa bed not made up on arrival as I asked and when laid on was terrible. Housekeeping appeared and literally dropped a 1/4 inch topper on it making no difference. We went out and I asked for it to be fully made up on return. It was with the topper and seat cushion added. If you slept the opposite way to it was made up the bar was not in your back. I’d also asked for a decent view. Floor 3 looking out the back at the back of flats. We were offered a duplex room but this was no better. Were it just the two of us, the sofa bed would not have been an issue. Room struggled to sleep three adequately. Smaller children would be ok. I also booked the hotel for use of a sauna. The one in the spa was for treatments. The one on floor 7 is a glass box looking into the tiny gym where working out people can’t but help stare at you. I didn’t use it. I gave them the 30 mins I was told to warm it up. It didn’t even get moderately hot and smelt. I knew the pool wasn’t heated but it was freezing. The coldest unheated pool I’ve ever experienced.  Gripes aside the staff were exemplary. Very polite helpful and courteous. We were B and B and the breakfast was delicious. Staff very attentive and a variety of things to select and cooked breakfast available on request. Coffee, fresh juice, cava, pastries, cold meats and cheeses, toast, fresh delicious fruit, yoghurts, cereals, dried fruits, and more.  The roof top bar is lovely. Hotel not too far from Gaudi’s cathedral and a 20 minute walk in to the Gothic area and a little further to the marina. Turn down service very nice and rooms clean and well equipped. Mini bar confusing. All items complimentary until restocked...or not? 2 beers, 2 cokes, 2
 orangena and 2 waters. Big bottle of water replaced daily. Capsule coffee machine very nice. Mechanical blind makes room pitch black and no issue with traffic noise.  Jacuzzi bath, with shower, separate shower and enclosed toilet. Bathroom area has no door?  Bit strange. Opening the shower door closes the gap off to a degree. Plenty of  complementary toiletries replaced daily.  Taxi rank outside and the door person calls one over. Confusing it was €36 to the hotel and €27 back??  If I was looking for a 2-3 night stay I’d go back but I had singled this out for a pool and sauna which were not used. Plenty of other hotels don’t offer these so I might try there. In the summer though the roof top pool would be amazing.",4,2020,02,22
19,Amazing hotel to recharge your batteries!,"Just returned from a couple of days of calm relaxation after staying at this contempory yet restful centrally situated hotel.

Lovely, helpful staff, peaceful, tranquil atmosphere, delicious breakfast, huge comfortable beds and a gorgeous roof terrace for catching the sun. What more could you need?",5,2020,02,21
19,A pleasant surprise!,"Together with my wife we have chosen the Claris for our anniversary and third visit to Barcelona. Our first experience in this hotel, we must admit, passes every other 5 stars hotels we tried in town. The dedication and the attention to the details of its staff makes is a wonderful gem to discover day by day. The hotel is filled with artworks and even the room had a unique piece of Mayan art, which really impressed us. The front desk and concierge were the cherry on top of our stay, always welcoming you with smile and little attentions that made our experience just perfect! We will definitely repeat",5,2020,02,20
19,Blood stained sheets,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel last weekend and whilst the hotel was beautiful, we had a dreadful experience with regards to the service and state of our bedroom. When we arrived at the hotel on Saturday morning the receptionist on the day was welcoming, she told us our room would be ready within the hour and would call us to confirm when we could come back and pick up the key. We utilised the rooftop bar which had a fantastic front of hour and waited for an hour for our suite to become available, after no contact for 90 minutes we went to check with the receptionist on the availability of our room. We were told to wait in the lobby and after another half an hour had passed we chased again and eventually got given a key. We would have utilised either the breakfast facilities had the staff made us aware of this which we were still in time for or ventured out of the hotel had we known it would 
in fact be a 2hour wait, the service was not 5 star and communication poor. The suite that we originally checked into was lovely however upon returning to the hotel after spending the day sightseeing, we were horrified to find upon pulling back the bed sheets an old blood stained fitted sheet, it was horrifying and absolutely disgusting! There was so much blood it had in fact soaked through to the under sheet. We immediately complained to reception about the same, reception ensured we would receive a visit from housekeeping straight away. After a 1 hour wait and 3 phone calls to reception, the head of house keeping arrived and implied that the blood was possibly ours, she then quickly apologised and offered to change the sheets. Considering that there was blood on the bed that could potentially carry disease such as HIV, aids or hepatitis, we told the hotel that we would like a new room ASAP.

After another hour of our evening being wasted and having to reschedule our dinner plans we eventually got to our new suite which to be perfectly frank was badly designed and noisy. We were given a bottle of champagne but no acknowledgment from management for what had happened, we were just shoved in a sub par room and chucked some alcohol. 

Upon checking out we were not even given the opportunity to feedback our experience as your staff didn’t even ask us how our staff was.

Frankly I’m absolutely disgusted and appalled by the treatment we received from your hotel and would certainly not entertain staying at your hotel again. 

Having stayed in many 5 stars hotels before this is not the level of service or hygiene we would expect from a hotel.

We were so disappointed  with our stay, I feel it is only right that we submit this review on Trip-advisor so no one experiences the same.",1,2020,02,19
19,Anniversary,"The Staff were brilliant! They offered us an upgrade suite for the stay and we loved it!

They also helped me to prepare some surprise gifts for her and made a path of roses. She absolute loves it!!!

Truly to repeat!

Thanks.",5,2020,02,16
19,Perfect Place For Holiday,"Hotel has Perfect Location Excelent Service and Very Nice and clean premisses.
I come for weekend short visit and I had great time.
It is close to all touristic atractions and hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.",5,2020,02,16
19,Unexpected Stay,"We weren't expecting to stay at Hotel Claris or in fact even to be visiting Barcelona, right from the outset the booking was easy and we made this as we waited to board our flight. We arrived to the most beautiful hotel reception which allowed my partner and I to breath. The room was perfect, clean, modern and was ideal. On returning each afternoon it was always such a pleasant surprise to find the room immaculate no matter the state it was in when we left and the turn down service made it all that more special. We booked two spa treatments the second day, all the staff were exceptionally accommodating since we had only booked the room not even 12 hrs before. The Spa treatments were worth every single Euro. Feeling invigorated we walked to everything worth walking too. The Roof terrace was a huge bonus, open during the day and at night we were blessed with beautiful weather and so enjoyed a speculator lunch on our final afternoon and enjoyed some amazing cocktails on a couple of the evenings. People reading this may think this is a planted review, it is simply not, this is the first time I have posted and that's because people need to know about this great hotel in Barcelona. If you are looking for a weekend break or even longer, seriously look no further you need to stay here. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",5,2020,02,11
19,One of the nicest rooms I stayed in,"I had the chance to stay at Hotel Claris for business. They gave me room 210. What an amazing room. Loved it. It is a duplex room, with a lounge area on the top. I used it to practice yoga (I always carry my yoga mat with me). TOP! Fully recommended.",5,2020,02,05
19,Perfect winter Barcelona location,Great stay at the hotel. Brilliant location in the heart of the city. Hotel was very clean and the service was impeccable. Also used the Spa which was original in style and very exclusive. Only downside was the size of the bed was the sound reducing noise of the windows. ,5,2020,02,04
19,"Excellent Location,  excellent cost/benefit","Excellent rooftop, with pool and very cool restaurant, the food was remarkable and the setting out of this world, great ambience! Great place for drinks with friends! we went for lunch but if must be nice even for dinner in the summer ! I will certainly go back!",5,2020,02,04
19,Cool and contemporary,"Really good location and very clean,comfortable surroundings. Staff friendly, approachable and attentive. 
Excellent quality facilities and really comfy beds. Nothing too much trouble. Nice touches such as complimentary drinks in minibar- welcome after a day sight seeing. 
Really convenient for a city break as it’s close to all the main  attractions. Great rooftop bar/pool and restaurant and yummy breakfasts. Yet within a few minute walk are really nice cafes/ tapas /bars if you don’t feel like spending 22 euros  on breakfast e.g cafe prices for coffee and croissant from 2:50 eu! Would recommend at least one breakfast at the hotel though as food is delicious and staff are very attentive. A nice experience all round.",5,2020,02,02
19,Great hotel; great location; great stay!,"Claris is a very special hotel located in one of the nicest areas of Barcelona. It is beautifully appointed, with large comfortable rooms, and a wonderful collection of pre Colombian artefacts and antiques! The staff are very friendly, extremely helpful, and full of great suggestions for restaurants and activities. Located within walking distance of some of the best sights in the city, the Claris hotel is highly recommended.",5,2020,02,02
19,Spectacular Experience,"Hotel Claris was such a wonderful experience during my stay in Barcelona. The staff went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable and satisfied with my accommodations. The room service and rooftop restaurant food was great quality. Just as important, the service was unmatched. Jose from the room service team and Mossimo as my server at La Terraza del Claris both made my dining experiences so enjoyable. 

As a bonus, the location is great - walking distance to many amazing sites/experiences that Barcelona has to offer. 

I would highly recommend Hotel Claris whether your stay is for business or holiday. You will not be disappointed. ",5,2020,01,28
19,Love the views,"5*GL hotel centrally located with over 100 rooms very well decorated and eclectic  art collection it’s like sleeping in a museum really!  like a private house and  up on the terraze A restaurant that at night is the delight of the DJs, perfect for vacational or business  with high-end quality service.",4,2020,01,26
19,Friendly Staff/Walkable location,"My husband and I and our young adult son stayed 2 nights in an upgraded duplex suite while in Barcelona celebrating his Masters degree. Our room was nicely furnished with a king bed and large bathroom on the main floor and a daybed with additional TV on an open loft style second floor. A nice breakfast was included, the concierge was helpful and we found it easy to walk to most everything. The decor was a bit quirky with lots of Egyptian art.",5,2020,01,24
19,Little Jewel of a Hotel,"This boutique hotel is close to everything you need. Amazing restaurants, world class shopping and close to the metro as well as walking distance from some of the main tourist attractions.  All this without being touristy. The staff is friendly and helpful. And the hotel is Uber clean and sophisticated and their lobby has the most amazing smell. They should sell the scent. It’s so fresh!  We could not recommend this hotel enough!",5,2020,01,23
19,"Great location and lovely, caring staff","Hotel Claris is in a great location, with a view from the roof up to the old libary on the hill, and then over the rooftops of Barcelona. We walked everywhere, up to Parc Guel and down to the sea, from the hotel. It's 30 minute drive from the airport, which was Euro 30 each way. 
Reception is spacious and stylish, and staff are so happy to see you, and English is superb. We were kindly given an early check in and an upgrade, and when we left, we were kindly given a very late check out. This was so very welcome.  Our room was very spacious, with a huge bathroom. Sadly, no bathroom door from the bedroom, and only a glass sliding door for the lavatory, but that was a minor issue with the huge double shower, and jacuzzi bath. The bed was ginormous and comfy, and we also had a large sofa in our room, as well as table and chairs. I asked for a kettle and tea cups, and they arrived with a smile within 5 minutes. The pool, and rooftop bar, are both stunning, and on advice of reviews, we had some really superb cocktails on the roof one night.  The gym is also up on the roof, and was bigger than I had expected, but we didn't have time to use it, or sample the hotel's food or restaurant. There's so much to do on your doorstep.... I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,19
19,Fantastic stay at Hotel Claris will be back!,"Have just returned from a three night short stay at Hotel Claris would 100% recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona.

The breakfast was fantastic with everything you could wish for with fresh fruit and made to order cooked breakfasts!
Staff were so helpful in recommending food places to eat at nearby (must visit El National and try the fish restaurant there was fantastic).

The room was cleaned twice a day and we really loved The White Company toiletries provided including bath salts etc.
The roof terrace is a lovely added extra to this hotel although we didn’t get much time to chill we would definitely take full advantage of this in the warmer weather.

We will definitely be back in the future thank you for the best stay one of the best hotels we have stayed in!",5,2020,01,18
19,Experience true luxury!,"The Claris hotel in Barcelona is exactly what you would expect from a small luxury property, but the fantastic experience we had there was enriched by its attentive and professional staff.

The Frontdesk staff was absolutely marvelous! We will repeat soon.",5,2020,01,17

19,Not worth it,"For a 5 star hotel, this was a real disappointment.  The staff were lovely and our highlight was the pumpkin soup on the roof terrace which was delicious.  We booked a junior suite: lots of marble, an all singing and dancing bath and comfortable main bed (pull out sofa very short) but our main concern was that the room was very poorly insulated.  We had to call reception one night due to the noise above.  Also woken by a baby crying above us.  Sink didn't drain well which wasn't very nice.  There was no view - room looked out onto inner 'courtyard' which meant you had no sense of the weather or the city for that matter.  None of us felt the hotel had any sort of vibe either.  Would definitely not come here again or recommend it - average is not good enough for this sort of hotel.  It may be central but there are plenty other hotels in this area.",3,2019,12,31

19,Bad customer service not 5 star,"The hotel appears to be nice but it is not a 5 star so don’t come here expecting that. I’m most disappointed in the customer service or lack thereof. We got back to our room one night which smelled of smoke, so bad I could barely breathe and I’m pregnant. Hotel did nothing to help me and basically told me it is what it is. Would never come back.",1,2019,12,04
19,Beware of their extra charges especially for breakfast,"Management does not care.  They promise different and checkin and charge you extra at checkout.  You don't have time to defend at that time.  When i emailed them, they just repeated standard management lines.",1,2019,12,04

The Jacuzzi bath was an added bonus with all the walking we did throughout our stay.
Location was fabulous to get to everywhere we needed to and was quiet at night
The rooftop pool / bar area was very relaxing",5,2019,12,03
19,You can do better,"Not really sure how this hotel got the 5* rating. Sure it has a nice location, but the rooms are dated and require a lot of maintenance. I am an Explorist member with Hyatt, so the front desk has told us we have been ""upgraded"" to room 316.  If that was an upgrade, I'm afraid to even think what the original room was. After flushing, the toilet makes the ""jet take off noise"" for about a minute, while the water refills. Somehow the noise is more prevalent in the room. If you lift the toilet seat, it doesn't stay up, so you have to hold it with your hand or leg. The light inside the closet never turns off, so it never gets dark in the room. And finally, the Nespresso machine is ""conveniently"" located on the ottoman by the couch....4 meters away from the nearest power receptacle. Also, on our early departure, noone offered to help us with our luggage. Breakfast was also subpar to many local 3-4* hotels.",3,2019,12,01
19,A heartfelt THANK YOU from Taiwan,"I would like to express our great appreciation for the staffs at Hotel Claris in Barcelona at the night of October 16.

With their brave and in-time help, we, a tour group of 11 people on our last night of the trip in Spain, were safely sheltered from the potential danger of the protest on our way back to our own hotel.

They provided very generous support to host us there, and they even dispatched a staff to guide us back to our hotel at the earliest safe moment.

We are very grateful for what the hotel has done for us, especially when the city and the hotel itself were also at a critical moment during that time - THANK YOU!!!

Our tour group departed from Barcelona airport for Taiwan on October 17, and safely arrived home as planned - without your great help, this might not be possible or at least could have been much more difficult.

This unfortunate event in Barcelona would a painful memory to many people and we would like to wish all the people in this great city all the best, and hope the city and the people can recover soon and show the world again how wonderful you are!
 
To many of us in the tour group, the visit to Barcelona was definitely the best part of our trip, and the short visit to your hotel that night was definitely the pinnacle of the trip!

We will remember what great things you have done for us, and I will take your hotel as my first priority next time when I visit Barcelona with my wife and daughter (this time I visited Spain with my father in a tour group).

Again, thank you for everything!",5,2019,12,01
19,Great Hospitality,"Nothing is too much for the staff and they all went the extra mile during our stay.

19,Pretty but ...,"This is a lovely hotel centrally located in the heart of the Eixample.  The lobby and rooms are tastefully decorated but a bit on the small size.  I stayed in a two level suite and the lower level with the bed and bath was small.  The bath itself contained a rain shower but unfortunately the small size meant that it was impossible to move anywhere but directly under the water.  Great if one likes walking in a downpour sans hat and rain gear, but otherwise not so great.  The hotel would also benefit with more sound proofing, especially when the cleaning staff are making their rounds early in the mornings.  I did not use the restaurants or other facilities during my week stay so cannot comment on those.  ",4,2019,11,22
19,Great experiences,"As a member of Hyatt, this booking was made they the loyalty program. The hotel has an excellent  in Barcelona. The reception and concierge were extremely helpful, so was the bellman also. Our stay was short but good, my wife's birthday got a special attention in the room with a bottle of cava and some sweets. THANK YOU Hotel Claris! ",5,2019,11,17
19,Outstanding service and overall experience,"Having stayed in many hotels around the world we must say that the Claris Hotel Barcelona clearly stood out, mainly thanks to the exceptional service the staff has demonstrated. 

A special thanks goes to Mrs. Caduz from the reception for being extremely helpful and friendly in assisting us with all our questions and for understanding our needs. She clearly did the extra-mile to exceed client satisfaction.

We can definitely recommend booking a VIP gourmet breakfast on the rooftop (la Terrazza de Claris) with Mario who did a great job in proactively providing us with the best in class service and an unforgettable romantic experience.

Thank you for the great time we had at the Claris Hotel and for making us feel so special!",5,2019,11,17
19,AN AMAZING STAY AT THE HOTEL CLARIS,The hotel was a very pleasant surprise.  The staff was very efficient and very pleasant.  They made us feel they existed just for us.  The room was small but adequate and when we realized that the heat and air conditioning went off with the lights when the card was removed we left the card in and turned off all the lights.  I had read review before we went about being too cold or too hot but we didn't have that experience.  We would definitely go back there and would recommend it.,5,2019,11,15
19,Mrs Joyce B.,Excellent hotel very inviting helpful staff.  Great room and breakfast buffet is wonderful and last until 10:30! So sleep in! Central to sites within walking distance and great taxi point. Two restaurants! Had a great stay! Thank you Hotel Claris and staff!,5,2019,11,14
19,"Great hotel, uper rooms, spa is not the best","On a business trip. Liked the hotel a lot, good service, good rooms, great bed and bathroom.
Breakfast ok but can be more choice and more capacity for the cook.
Spa is very small and small pool is outside on the top floor, so not ideal at this time of year (temperature and wind)",4,2019,11,10
19,Surprise!,"Booked this hotel as a surprise for my mum as an early Christmas present. And it did not disappoint absolutely perfect all the staff where lovely and so accommodating. I was in touch with the hotel sorting out extra amenities and the guest relation team where unbelievable. Quick responds and happy to help attitude. 

The spa in the hotel was lovely as well so relaxing. 

This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in would 100% recommend. ",5,2019,11,10
19,A special hotel! A new favourite ,Lovely hotel. Excellent staff and service... made to feel really special and additional little touches making our stay so comfortable. Duplex room absolutely spectacular. Makes a refreshing change to have a popular hotel that treat their customers like people and do anything to make you feel welcome and at home. Visited for my partner birthday and this was also taken into consideration which made our weekend. Cannot praise the hotel enough well done indeed!,5,2019,11,09
19,Shop around before you book this hotel,"Overall, for a 5-star hotel: fair. I stayed in a Delux Jr. Suite: The room was dark, lighting was very poor; the couch was stained and not usable due to configuration and construction. A lamp was placed on the couch for a additional lighting - dangerous. 2 plastic chairs for casual sitting. PLASTIC - in a 5-star hotel?? Bathroom offers zero bathroom privacy.

Reception, staff, breakfast: Met expectations.
Location: Very convenient.

As Claris is listed as a 5-star hotel, I suggest consumers shop and compare before selecting Claris.",3,2019,11,09
19,A Gem in Barcelona city center,"I choose the Claris for my stay in Barcelona with my wife and our expectations were not disappointed. The staff is greatly trained and makes you feel pampered since your arrival. The front desk was one of the most helpful and kind we have ever experienced, the breakfast service is classy and delicious and the location unbeatable, everything within 10 minutes walk! Totally recommend",5,2019,11,09
19,Beyond expectations,"A beautiful, clean hotel with very attentive staff. Made to feel very welcome and special as guests. Breakfast was amazing- would say the best we've had in a hotel. Catered for gluten free requirements too. Overall 10/10 for this hotel.",5,2019,11,08
19,Best place to stay in Barcelona,"We have stayed at several locations in Barcelona over the years - the Hotel Claris is the very top of the line! In the best area to visit - everything within walking distance, and the service was well beyond compare! We will be returning to this stunning hotel! From the Doorman, to the Concierges, to the Front Desk, to the porter - we were welcomed and indulged in every step of the way! And the rooftop bar and pool is wonderful after a day of fun in this magical city!",5,2019,10,25
19,Beautiful rooftop and pool but some issues,"Room perfume everywhere in the hotel, very disturbing. The jamon served on the top floor was very disappointing and the spritz without any taste but the area where the hotel is located is good and the rooftop is nice, private and the pool right next to it.",3,2019,10,24
19,Beautiful Property with 5 star service!,"We loved our stay at the Claris. The room was wonderful from the sauna in bathroom, to the comfortable bed, the roof top bar and pool and amazing service from the moment we checked in. The location cannot be beat and we loved every minute of our stay. Thank you Claris for an amazing anniversary!",5,2019,10,18
19,Could have been better,We had a superior King bed room.  No king bed. 2 twin beds put together. Not good. Bathroom completely ridiculous. No hooks. No light over the mirror. Small counterspace  Rain head shower not centered correctly so bathroom floor soaked. Toiletries smelled awful. We did not find the reception people warm and friendly.  No one smiled. Doormen were very nice and helpful.  Breakfast buffet limited. Had to ask for things that weren’t displayed. We were hoping to be upgraded to a better room since my travel agent booked it stating it was my husbands birthday and we arrived distressed after having to walk many blocks with suitcases because of demonstrations and road blocks near the hotel. Would have been a nice touch for us.  ,3,2019,10,17
19,Theft of travel bag in lobby,"We were taken by bus to Hotel Claris as part of cruise package after disembarking.  There was a group of some 25 of us. Luggage was placed  in lobby adjacent to registration desk.  Within one minute, my wife's large travel bag was stolen from the pile of luggage.  Immediately reported it to manager.  He first tried to tell us it probably was left on the bus.  IT WAS NOT.  He said he would review closed circuit video of lobby ""later"".  A few hours later, he said he ""saw nothing"" on the video.  The surly, ""ho-hum"" attitude of the staff didn't help. No ""sorry"", etc.  So, we spent our time in Barcelona at police station filling out report.  My advise if you stay here:  HOLD ONTO ALL YOUR POSSESSIONS AT ALL TIMES.",1,2019,10,15
19,Great hotel with perfect location in Barcelona,Loved this hotel in based in the center of Barcelona. Great service and very nice hotel. Everything was fresh and the staff where very friendly and professional. Pool area at the roof was nice and clean. Great breakfast venue and awesome service.,5,2019,10,15
19,Not 5 Star; a mix of style and frustration,"We stayed 10 nights here on business in a loft suite. On the plus side, most of the staff are great, the lobby is cool, the rooftop bar and pool very stylish and the breakfast fantastic. On the negatives - which are not acceptable for a 5 star hotel, the rooms are a hot mess. No storage or counter space, our shower leaked everywhere, lights were problematic, the pillows like rocks and the room NOISY - from the street and the corridors.  The gym too is the size of a king bed - with virtually no equipment. A very mixed review for a very mixed hotel",3,2019,10,11
19,Nice hotel but overpriced,Nice hotel with excellent location and restaurant but rooms are small and regular service. I was in a nice suite but the noise in the street was high and the closet was quite small for more than three days. For an average of 550$ night I think the service and rooms can be better,4,2019,10,06
19,A Lovely stayi in Barcelona,"I will start by saying the location of the hotel is fantastic and the staff is wonderful. We felt very well taken care of by every person who works at the Claris. The location is perfect, easy access to public transportation and also an easy walk to so many neighborhoods and sights. The only failing of the hotel is some of the design features. It is very chic and hip, but form seems to be more important then function in a number of ways, particularly in the bathroom where the very attractive glass shower enclosure leaked and the the vanity is overpowered by large sinks leaving almost no room for personal items. No rods for hanging towels was also a problem. The light in the bedroom closet was on a motion detector so even when the closet door was shut if you walked by it it went on. This was problematic in the middle of the night because if you got up the light would go on and would wake up my husband who was sleeping.",4,2019,10,06
19,"  Not glamorous!","We booked this hotel with high expectations from great online reviews. The hotel itself is beautiful. But.....we booked a king size bed. Upon arriving in our room we found two twin beds pushed together. I contacted the front desk and asked why we didn’t have a king size bed. I was told that “if a king is requested then two two twins are pushed together”🤨I found this to be quite odd for a hotel of this caliber. Our first night was awful. I had to get up and physically push the beds back together several times during the night. So much for romance- !!! Even the sheets were made up as if it were two twin beds. Couldn’t they have at least used king size sheets and put something on the bed frames to keep the beds from separating? The room was very small and I had to call the desk for an iron as they are not provided in the rooms. The shower was also a huge let down. It was a tub shower with an attached adjustable head that sprayed out all over the bathroom floor. There was no sliding door, just one glass panel covering half of the tub. So we had to rush through our showers to avoid soaking the bathroom floor. Not peaceful or relaxing!!!! ",3,2019,10,04
19,Great Stay,"Great stay. One of the best hotels we have stayed in. Barcelona was great. From the check in until we left. Everything was great. We even got to check in a little early and after 18 hours of traveling, it was needed.",5,2019,09,30
19,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent location.","My Wife and Daughter recently returned from a 3 night break at this beautiful hotel They stayed  in a duplex room which exceeded expectations and was spotless. The staff were all lovely. The breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice and eggs cooked to order. They made plenty of use of the roof top terrace which they loved. The location of the hotel, for them, could not be beaten, right in the heart of the up-market shopping area. You will not be disappointed if you book this hotel.",5,2019,09,29
19,Excellent location in the heart of Barcelona,This is a first class hotel in the heart of this beautiful city.  The staff are helpful and the breakfast was excellent.  We could walk to a lot of the important tourist spots and there were good restaurants nearby.  The area is lovely with big Victorian blocks of flats and shops and restaurants.  The locals drive very fast so you need to be careful crossing streets and the traffic is quite heavy at times but most cities these days have the same problem.  We would stay in this hotel again.  The towel re-use policy did work some of the time but some staff still do not understand it!,5,2019,09,29
19,Muséum hotel,"Very good star at thé Claris , thé room are incredible and thé roof top restaurant is a 5 stars .Thank you Claris for this wonderful stay.We appréciée also thé chineuse restaurant in the hôtel , very good service .",5,2019,09,28
19,Loved our stay,"It was perfect! We are very pleased with this hotel. I want to give a special shout-out to Oscar for his above and beyond customer service. 

The staff was extremely helpful and kind.

The breakfast buffet was exquisite. ",5,2019,09,27
19,Stylish hotel in Barcelona,"Great location in a really good area nearby to many attractions, restaurants and shops which are an easy walk from the hotel. Staff very friendly and accommodating and upgraded our rooms due to a wedding anniversary and honeymoon as well as complimentary bottles of Cava. Bar prices are on the high side and I found the air conditioning in the room not very efficient but I think this is controlled centrally as it was cool in communal areas. Nice roof top pool and generous breakfasts with lots of choice. Didn't use the spa during our stay as ran out of time but treatments looked great and the whole hotel was spotless.",5,2019,09,27
19,We had a lovely stay ,"Claris
Here’s my bullet points I noted whilst I was a Claris ....
Welcoming friendly helpful - all of the staff 
Warm decent room size and bathroom
Clean rooms bathrooms towels changed frequently 
Small gym 3 cardio  machines small selection of weights 
Small roof top pool..
Nice toiletries 
I Like design of hotel and rooms 
I Like artefacts in rooms and in general areas/ reception areas  
On Main Roads so could hear traffic rooms not so sound proof but an internal door in our room 
A mobile phone provided in all of our parties rooms to use in Barcelona as well as calls to some other countries includes data for maps.
All in all a lovely hotel did not once eat here so unsure of price or quality..",5,2019,09,15
19,Poor follow up when something goes wrong,"The hotel is in a great location, near many subway stops. It's just a block away from shopping, 2 Gaudi buildings, and restaurants. It's actually a pretty central location for everything. The room size is spacious for two people, however the walls are thin so you will hear your neighbors and staff. The windows block the street noise well. The roof pool has a nice view but just a quick note that seats fill up early and it's not heated... it's cold! The door staff are very friendly, helpful, and prompt fulfilling any requests we had.

Housekeeping kept the room clean, but did not consistently replenish items like waters, shampoos, and coffee glasses. Also, the radio in the room does not charge properly so we couldn't use it.

The front desk staff was friendly enough but did was not familiar with our Hyatt reservations (some paid nights, some award nights). On arrival we were given a card outlining the breakfast as well as the cost per person. At checkout we were told that the award nights included breakfast- great to know after the fact. Why were we given a card that listed a price then? Also, we were initially told the award nights were paid for, but were later presented with a bill. We ended up not paying it but it felt sloppy.

The biggest issue was that cigarette smoke was being pumped into the room through the HVAC unit. This happened at 11pm and we were told it would be taken care of. There is no way to turn off the HVAC so it happened again in the middle of the night and we were given another room. At checkout we were told that the guest who was smoking would be charged $250 because they signed papers to not smoke, but that no compensation could be made to us without talking to the manager (who was not in) and we should email them. Why should I reach out to the manager. Shouldn't they reach out to a guest that knowingly had an issue? What do I care what the hotel charges the smoker? It's not like they gave me any of that penalty fee. I understand smokers happen, but the follow up was poor. The morning after our ruined sleep there was nothing more than one person saying sorry and presenting our folios, it felt insincere for a hotel that prides itself in other reviews.",1,2019,09,14
19,Superb Hotel,"Don't hesitate to book this hotel, it is absolutely wonderful.
The service is excellent, second to none. The staff our wonderful, very customer focused. 
I would go back and stay there every time I am in Barcelona - beautiful!",5,2019,09,13
19,Awesome staff!,"We spent three full days in Barcelona, Spain and at the Hotel Claris. The Staff was awesome as were the accommodations. My only comment is don't rent the rooms on the front (street) side of the building on the sixth floor as these rooms (ours was 609) is directly below the roof top restaurant and in this room, every chair that moved was heard, no matter the hour. I suspect it was just normal restaurant and cleaning activity but you will hear it.I had to wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Perhaps the opposite side of floor six is okay and of course, any floor below the sixth floor would be okay. Again, the staff was very helpful and patient and the building was in superb condition. The bath tub shower combo was a little awkward due to partially swinging glass door (only swings inward and stops at the water controls. This means you have to be in the tub to operate the control valve. A little weird. The breakfast were very good with many options and great service. There's even a small museum with a surprising and interesting collection of Mayan artifacts. My suggestion would be to alert the sixth floor room room renters under the restaurant and pool area to the potential of the noise and offer significant rate reduction. Enjoy!",5,2019,09,10
19,A Stroke of Luck,"When I was planning my end-of-summer vacation in Sitges, I decided to tack on a few days in Barcelona, an amazing city. (If you’ve never been, go now.) I checked @TripAdvisor and a couple of other travel review sites and zeroed in on a hotel that looked great in the neighborhood I wanted to be in, Eixample.

Then I received a promotional offer from Small Luxury Hotels, an affiliation of, well, small luxury hotels. They had a property in Barcelona, Claris Hotel (in Eixample, in fact) that I could book for 40% off. Furthermore, when I put in my travel dates, I could get any room category from standard to junior suite at the same price of a little more than 200 Euros/night. I am not sure who would book a standard room under that promotion, but I was more than happy to grab a junior suite.

It was a great choice. My junior suite was generous in size, and decorated individually in a very eclectic style — mixing and matching modern, traditional with pre-Columbian art (they have a small gallery highlighting their collection off the lobby.) The bed was great. The marble bathroom was huge with a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower. Together, the whole thing managed to be spectacular while still being comfortable.

My one big criticism is that had the worst fitness center of any hotel I’ve ever stayed at, it’s on the roof of the building and it’s made of glass, It was a sweat box. There was one small air conditioner that was basically useless. There was one treadmill, and two stationary bikes of dubious quality (they looked like they were bought on a late-night infomercial). There was one bench, and a series of free weights that maxed out at 10k (about 22 lbs). Really, why bother? There is a better gym close by that I did not get to visit, but you will have to pay the entry fee.

The Claris is not terribly highly rated and it was not my first choice; but it might be next time.",5,2019,09,10
19,Appreciation of a three day stay,"As a lebanese family delighted to  spend some days in Barcelona,  we found this hotel  really great (from the luxurious decoration to the great services provided) and all the staff as well but most specifically one member of it, namely Meritxell. She's an extremely kind and joyful person. Besides being professional at the highest point, she was always dedicated and did everything in her power to meet our needs and expectations. This was our first time there and surely not the last.",4,2019,09,08
19,"Service was exceptional, could not fault it!","Service was exceptional, could not fault it! From the moment we checked in not one member of staff, or one service we used was less than perfect, we would return to Barcelona just to stay at this hotel.
",5,2019,09,04
19,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for 5 days. Rooms are spacious and clean. We arrived at the hotel early however they checked us in and while we were waiting for our room to be ready we sat at the roof terrace which has a lovely pool/cocktail bar. The waiter there was very friendly. 
Nice pool and enough sun beds. We didn’t eat the restaurant but the food offered by the pool was really nice. 
Location:
Great location. 5 min walk to the main road where all the shops, cafe’s and restaurants are. Took us 10-15 mins drive to reach the beach by taxi, which would cost us less than €8.",4,2019,09,03
19,Can't Say Enough!,"My family (which includes 5 and 8 year old boys) stayed at this hotel for several days in Barcelona, and it made our trip!  The staff was so welcoming and accommodating.  We arrived very early, and they graciously checked our bags, allowed us to get what we needed for the next few hours and freshen up.  We then headed out to explore, which was so much fun because the location is so central.  They texted us just a few hours later (well before noon) to let us know that the rooms were ready.  The rooms are beautiful and well appointed.  When we weren't enjoying exploring the city, we used the pool, which was a nice break with a great view.  We also had a lovely dinner at their restaurant on the roof, which we won't soon forget.  Although the hotel is every bit as fancy as you see online, they were incredibly welcoming to us, and we felt right at home.  If we come to Barcelona again, we'll be sure to stay here.  ",5,2019,09,03
19,Short stay with teenage daughters,"The hotel has a fantastic location, really central.  The facilities are definitely 5 star and the staff go over and above to make your stay easy and memorable.  With teenage daughters, the roof top area was perfect, a pool during the day and a bar we could all share (safely) in the evening.  The gym was a little small but had everything you needed and was never crowded.  We stayed in a junior suite (there were 3 of us) and the room was a perfect size and the bathroom facilities lovely with a jacuzzi bath and separate toilet and shower.  I'd definitely recommend the hotel, it was an oasis of luxury in amongst a bustling city.  We had a great time.",5,2019,09,03
19,One of my favourite hotels ever! ,"This hotel has went straight to the top of my list of favourite hotels. There’s not a single thing I could fault. We were greeted so warmly and made to feel special right from the second we arrived. Our room was spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated and very well-appointed. The beds were comfortable and the linen of a very good quality. The glass of Cava on arrival is a fantastic touch as well as the little box of handmade chocolates that were brought to the room in the early evening. All of the staff were exceptional. The breakfast was superb and the rooftop pool area and terrace/bar truly lovely spaces for relaxing - both day and night. Food and drinks all of an extremely high standard and very reasonably priced - I returned each night to the terrace to have some of the wonderful homemade ice cream! We loved the fragrance in the lobby and corridors and appreciated the fresh rose in our bathroom. Location was 10/10 - and the metro so very easy to use. Would definitely recommend purchasing the T-10 ticket, for €10.20, which gives ten single journeys (including transfers between lines, of required, and travel to/from El-Prat Airport (to the Passeig de Gràcia RENFRE/Metro Station just a few minutes walk away); it‘s a real bargain! We learnt that the Majestic Hotel (just a few seconds down the road from the Claris), has a tenth floor rooftop terrace with 360° view over all of Barcelona so we went there one evening for drinks. The view was terrific no doubt, but the ambience and service at the Claris is far superior in general and it was a treat to get back to our hotel again. Lots of other little things that contributed to a top stay, but the wonderful experience we had is mostly down to the Hotel Claris team; all of whom seem to genuinely care about delivering the absolute best guest experience and charmed us, just as much as their beautiful city did! I wish I could name them all but do hope they know how much we appreciated them! Can’t wait to come back...",5,2019,09,02
19,Wonderful stay at the Claris hotel,"We had a very pleasant Stay at the Claris hotel in
BarcelonaThe hotel is truly a five star hotel the manager Alex the front desk manager was so accommodating he even upgraded our room to  an executive room which was lovely we checked in before time the entire staff was exceptional, from the front Dorman Oscar to Caroline that changed our flight tickets the whole experience the turndown service the extra water that was given the breakfast it was absolutely amazing we will definitely be returning to Barcelona to stay at the Claris hotel & Spa thank you very much to the entire team.

Highly recommend this hotel if you really want a 5star experience.

Thanks again hope to see you you again real soon.",5,2019,09,02
19,Gem of a hotel! ,"I just completed a visit here with my daughter. Let me say, first that the service, attentiveness and cleanliness of this hotel
Was amazing! The location is perfect for
Walking to  sights such as Casa Batllo, restaurants, shopping and a quick cab ride to major attractions including  Sagrada Familia and the beaches etc . It’s a great neighborhood to stay in. 

We arrived quite flustered following the airport. We were greeted excitedly
And with such warmth,  as if we were long lost friends finally returning home. 

Check in immediately put us at ease. I felt as if they were just waiting for us ! Wine, sangria, champagne, water etc was offered and They took care of everything seamlessly. Before I knew it this overly friendly staff had me checked in, bags on cart and We were being escorted to our immaculate room. Oscar took his time explaining the hotel  and the room amenities. He fulfilled every request we had (and we had many) quickly, efficiently and happily! 

The room was facing the street  which can be noisy- but you have to remember you are in the center of a City -a bustling busy alive city. This did not hamper our at efforts at all to fall asleep. Although, we are used to a noisy city. If you are not- then I would recommend you ask for a room that is not facing the front of the hotel.  
 
This hotel offers breakfast, lunch,dinner and cocktails. 2 restaurants, a pool on the rooftop terrace a Mayan inspired spa  and a mini Egyptian museum. Each room has some sort of art Work, and very nice amenities such as robes, slippers, (one pair for room usage and one for pool area) complimentary nespreaso, and water and , a mini bar. The  included breakfast was very nice with an ample Selection. The service there too was wonderful. 

Irons, ironing boards and transformers available Upon request. They have daily turn down service and any and all requests we made were cheerfully granted! 

The terrace area has the restaurant La Teraza   (Upon check in they give you a coupon for 25% off “a la Carte”  items).  we had small plates there on the couches while enjoying an early evening breeze. 

The concierge was so helpful and informative. The front reception desk staff were beyond friendly... always ready with a warm Smile , wave or a cheerful hello and can I get you anything. All The door men, bell service (Oscar and Felix) were outstanding. Always on point with cab calling, guidance,  advice and information.  
 This hotel is geared to exceptional customer service and customer satisfaction. We felt a true warmth and concern from them. They take pride in their hotel and it shows In the most glowing outstanding way. It may have been adios on our last day there but it was hola to a new beginning of stays at the Claris. We will be back !! Muchas Gracias a todos!!!❤️

19,Amazing hotel,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay here. We only had one night in Barcelona and booked a standard room. We were immediately updated two tiers to a duplex room and given a free bottle of cava. The room, hotel and included breakfast were amazing.

My kids enjoyed the pool and extra touches.  Food was tasty.  Lovely stay!  Quiet and peaceful.  Comfortable beds.  I would recommend.  ,5,2019,08,21
19,TOP HOSPITALITY ,"I have traveled to Barcelona a few dozen times both for business and pleasure and I have stayed at many different five star hotels, but the Claris Hotel is by far the best for many reasons - great location, stylish accommodations, relaxed atmosphere, delicious cuisine, Mayan spa, beautiful rooftop and last but certainly not least the service. 

The service is impeccable and it starts with Alba Valado the assistant front office manager at the reception. She is so warm, attentive, expeditious and most of all epitomizes the full definition of the word, hospitality. She along with her entire team which includes Karutz, Mary Xtell, Jesus, Luana, Katy and Diogo have all been extremely pleasant and helpful during my stay. As a property developer, I know that a good team must have a good head and Alba is one of the best! 

In addition, I’d like to thank many others such as Poncho, Felix, Jordi and Uzman  at the front door, as they set in motion the first impression and a great first impression they do make indeed! 

I know there are many others that helped make our stay exceptional whom I do not know by name, but certainly I know them by their kind hospitality. These individuals are part of housekeeping staff, the terrace restaurant staff and the pool staff as well. 

For all of the above reasons, I have decided to make a 3 night stay at the Claris Hotel a 6 night stay. Thank you and you shall see us again and again!

19,Great service and superb rooftop breakfast,"We stayed for only a night at Claris in Barcelona and truely enjoyed it. The staff is extremely friendly and from check-in onwards we were always treated very well. The location of the hotel is great, ie walking distance to most central places in Barcelona, and also close to public transport if needed. The icing of the cake for us was the roof top breakfast (booked the night before). Fantastic doesn’t describe it well enough. This is highly recommended when staying at Claris",5,2019,08,13
19,Brilliant Honeymoon Destination,We had an amazing stay at the Claris Hotel for our Honeymoon. We stayed for 6 nights and they could not do enough for us.

19,Excellent service and experience,We stayed here for 4 nights with a 15 month old baby.  The staff were super accommodating and helped in every way they could.

Accommodations were outstanding and we were very happy with our stay.,5,2019,08,09
19,Great stay at Barcelona,"Great location near historical sites, courteous and helpful staff, good amenities. Very clean room and bathroom. Did not try the restaurant or pool area; too much to do and see in Barcelona. Would certainly stay here again. ",5,2019,08,09
19,Terrific,My daughter and I stayed here for a week.  The hotel is beautiful with a wonderful and helpful staff.  It's location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing.

Everyone we encountered was incredibly helpful and professional and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!,5,2019,08,08
19,Great hotel and really nice staff.,It was really nice 5* with great location. It was a special occasion and they gave a gift which was really nice touch.

19,Claris Hotel & Spa is the BEST,"My name is Sandra Nunez

I stayed at the Claris Hotel & Spa from July 12 to July 14, 2019 to then go on Norwegian Cruise for vacation. I wanted to deeply thank you and all the staff for making my stay wonderful.

The front desk ladies were awesome providing me information about places, metro and things to do in Barcelona. The Food and room service was amazing. The complimentary breakfast and upgrade to a Suite was also appreciated. The staff (servers, front desk, bellman, door man and cleaning lady) were outstanding. They were all rewarded with monetary tips, due to their outstanding service.  

This Hotel deserves 10 stars. I can't thank you enough for all the service, attention and for making feel welcomed.

The Welcoming Letter with all the extras was also incredible.

I am looking forward for another stay at Claris Hotel and to explore Barcelona once again.

God Bless.

Respectfully,

Sandra Nunez-",5,2019,07,28
19,Claris Hotel,"Very beautiful hotel, with excellent service and very polished staff. Rooms are tastefully decorated with top quality linens and amenities. The hotel's subtle elegance makes it stand out from bigger hotels in the luxury category. ",5,2019,07,26
19,Barcelona trip,"Recently I went to Barcelona for vacation. I really enjoyed the city. While there I stayed at Hotel Claris, what a fabulous hotel. From reception to check out, it was a wonderful experience. Great rooms and amenities including roof top pool and bar, Mayan Secret Spa and 2 onsite museums really added to the ambiance of this converted 19th century palace. The staff was very accommodating and helpful.
We were able to walk to most of the major tourist attractions or a short reasonably priced taxi ride, which the hotel doorman gladly summoned. 

There is no shortage of great food, there are eateries every few feet it seems. Try Restaurant 2254 for great meal of small plates",5,2019,07,21
19,My enjoyable stay at the Claris Hotel,"It was my first time to stay at the Claris Hotel.  The hotel is located in a great and centrally located area, simply a block away from Passeig de Gracia.  It was a pretty quick and easy check in process; the welcome drink at reception was very much appreciated.

The room was very nice and modern; quite comfortable.  However, the air conditioning system was not working well during my first night and I was unable to sleep well.  Maintenance was able to rectify the problem and the room temperature was perfect during the rest of my stay.  Also, why was there only 1 set of ironing board and iron for the entire hotel?  

The hotel staff was great overall; service was quite wonderful.  The Filipino manager overseeing breakfast at the coffee shop was so helpful and accommodating, he was the epitome of five star luxury service.

I would definitely go back and recommend the Claris to family and friends.

19,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great central position. Loved the pool and the room and the staff were incredibly helpful. Felt like an oasis of calm in a busy city. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go because of the central position. Will definitely return!",5,2019,07,12
19,Our celebration of decades,A beautiful hotel in a great location-all the staff wonderfully helpful-breakfast downstairs a delight! The concierge was incredible with us making recommendations and reservations. Our stay in Barcelona could not have been better!,5,2019,07,11
19,Beatiful hotel with top service ,"Spent 5 days with my daughter at this amazing hotel. We loved to stay at the pool an restaurant on top of the hotel, where the service by Mario and his team was outstanding. Highly recommended! ☺️⭐️👌🏻",5,2019,07,10
19,Suitcase missing,"After the bellman told us to leave our luggage at the front desk he told us they would be delivered to our rooms. We were missing a suitcase and they told us there was no other suitcase and perhaps it was left at the airport. We know for a fact that it was taken to the hotel and the lady at the front desk stated ""the only reason why it would be stolen is if the suitcase had luxury, expensive, one of a kind items"". No manager was available to speak with us, the receptionist did not have access to security cameras and manager wouldn't be in until after we had to leave for our cruise ship. Receptionist asked if bellman had given us a receipt after delivery of other suitcases and we did not. Some of our tags from airport were taken off without asking us. If you stay at this hotel do not leave luggage at front lobby no matter what they say I would not trust them. I am highly upset with them. Customer service was not great, door man told us to lighten up and not be upset because out facial expressions were noticeable that we were really upset. Not professional at all.",1,2019,07,09
19,Barcelo-no,"We looked hard and long before deciding on the Claris for our break in Barcelona but we ended up disappointed with our choice. Little things added up to an overall feeling that we could have done better.
We had already paid a deposit in advance so were surprised to be asked to pay in full for our stay on arrival. Having requested in advance for kettle & milk to be in our room it took four more requests after we got to the hotel before it arrived.
We had booked a junior suite and were shown a very small and dark interior room which we asked to change. Eventually we were given a room that was not much bigger but at least had a window to the outside. There was constant noise from above and the aircon temperature could not be changed.
It was without doubt the smallest suite that we have ever experienced in a five star hotel - sitting on the WC the toilet roll was resting on your knee!",2,2019,07,08
19,FANTASTIC BARCELONA HOTEL!,"This hotel is very special and welcoming, from the time of check-in, during stay and on departure.  Particular thanks to Alex(Alessandro) whose professionalism
was exemplary from the time we arrived, assisting with information on everything!  All the staff were very caring and friendly.  The hotel has a grand Palace facade, but has been modernised behind with Spanish architectural flair.  Our room was very comfortable, quiet and stylish.  Breakfast was excellent.  The location of the Hotel is perfect for a visitor to Barcelona and within walking distance of many attractions.  Highly recommended!",5,2019,07,07
19,Loud!,"I booked a room at his property months before my planned stay. I was assured a quiet room when assigned my room by the front desk. I was in room 211, an expensive duplex on the street. Very loud because  F street noise all night long. This was an expensive mistake. If you stay at this property definitely insist on a room that is not facing the street.",3,2019,07,06
19,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"This hotel was located in a perfect spot.  It walking distance to all the shopping,eating and walking distance to the Sagradia Familia church. The rooms were very nice with an egyptian decor.  They had a little museum located in the hotel, very interesting.  The rooms had a nespresso machine and a cell phone to use for free during your stay.  The refilled our bottles of water and nespresso capsules daily.  Service was excellent.  They had a roof top restuarant and pool and it was very nice.  If you want to dine in the restaurant, I suggest you make a reservation or you will end up eating at the bar area by the pool. But eating by the pool area means you get the best views.  Definitely would stay here again if I came back.",5,2019,07,02
19,"Great staff, very clean, good hotel","Great place to stay in Barcelona, the location depends on what you are planning on doing, but the likelihood is if you are doing the tourist things then it's as good as any. Near to the main run/shops, and about 15minute walk to the Gothic area and other well known areas to visit.",5,2019,06,30
19,Extremely disappointing end to a decent stay,"My stay at the Claris was more or less positive until it ended with a really negative experience.

Room (a duplex suite) - I like the design. Enough space for myself and wife. Bathroom clean and nice shower. Overall a really good room.

Pool - great rooftop pool, although in the busy season you will struggle to find a lounge chair. Not really their fault. They do have limited space.

Gym - for a smallish hotel, not bad. The treadmill did have an error message, which made it unusable. The airconditioning in the gym does not work very well, making the room a hotbox. 

Rooftop bar - great service and drink selection. 

Breakfast - at 18 euros p.p. not bad value considering what some of the other hotels charge. Really impressed with the quality and selection of their food.

Doorman - I forget his name, but an absolute gentelman and super helpful in flagging a taxi.

Concierge/Guest Relations - mixed experience here. Their restaurant suggestions were great. On the 2 occassions they provided us with suggestions, they were able to book for us and the food was fantastic. However on a separate occassion i was sitting in front on the guest relations desk for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to address me, but everyone seemed to look through me like I was a ghost. Granted it was busy and there were other people checking in. However, I was waiting before most of them, but they received priority over me. Eventually I just got up and walked away. At least tell me that you are sorry and will be with me shortly. Really not acceptable from a ""5 Star"" hotel. A real 5 Star hotel (e.g. St Regis in Abu Dhabi where I stayed a 5 days ago) does not keep their clientele sitting their like an idiot. I felt like an absolute fool sitting there.

Late Checkout - this was the biggest disappointment out of everything. The day before checking out, I asked the reception whether I could get late checkout. She said that until 1pm, no worries, but if you want until 4pm, then it would be 50 euros. My wife and I were not 100% sure at the time whether we wanted the 4pm checkout. The lady at the desk said that is not a problem, she will lock in the 1pm checkout and if we wanted the 4pm checkout then to let them know in the morning. We subsequently informed the gentleman at the front desk this morning that we wanted to get 4pm checkout. He advised us that this would not be possible as the hotel was fully booked. I advised him that the lady the day before said it would be possible and she did not mention that it was subject to availablity. He was not sympathetic and basically told us there was nothing he could do and to take it up with management. Not a very friendly person to be honest - he was the same person that did not address me when I was sitting down at the guest relations desk. I am not an unreasonable person, but I detest incompetence and that girl misled us. Had i known that 4pm checkout would not have been possible, I would have planned my day completely differently. 

Normally i wouldn't write such a review, but the gentleman at the front desk did not provide me with the manager's contact details. We still have not checked out and I hope the Claris can redeem themselves before we do.

19,Mini moon,"A great hotel in a great location
 Beautiful roof terrace, reception area and rooms. 
I would recommend this hotel for couples wanting a romantic city break.
We didn't try the food as it was in such a great location with so much choice to eat out. ",5,2019,06,21
19,Barcelona,The Hotel Claris made my stay in Barcelona amazing the staff outstanding everything was top notch they pay attention to details simply amazing. I will recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Barcelona is well centralized closed to everything.,5,2019,06,18
19,A Beautiful Hotel That Disappoints,"The Hotel Claris in Barcelona, a member of the Derby Hotels collection, is a highly aesthetic facility with beautiful rooms and personnel that cannot do enough to assist its guests. But the facility falls far from the mark when it comes to overall guest comfort. The buffet breakfasts are outstanding, and the maire d’ dotes upon his guests as if they were in his home. However, the rooftop breakfast alternative offers little more than the normal breakfast at a premium price and with subpar service. Dinner at the rooftop restaurant disappoints with a strange menu of distasteful offerings and unfriendly and sparse service. We had a reservation which we decided to abandon after we visited the restaurant and viewed the menu, so we elected to order a hamburger and fries to eat in our room. The fries were outstanding. Aside from their pleasant appearance, the rooms are almost totally dysfunctional. We chose the two-story upgrade and found the second floor unappealing. Because the stairs were missing a handrail, they were dangerous and uncomfortable to navigate. Since the upper-story room had little lighting, we significantly limited our activities there. Although it contained a soundbar that synced with our iPhones, the bellhop did not provide with sufficient training to enable us to take advantage of it. Because the coffee machine was located on this floor, we were required to navigate the dangerous staircase to access it. There was no spare electric outlet on the second floor. Whoever designed the rooms, seemed to focus on their appearance almost to the total exclusion of function. The bathroom had two huge sinks that left marginal room for any other use. The stoppers were set so that water accumulated faster than the drains could empty it. Complaints to staff went unanswered, so we learned ho to correct the problem by ourselves. The bathroom contained only one plug outlet and one small trash can, which was intended to service all three rooms. We requested two additional trash cans for our convenience in using the accommodations. There were only two hooks in the bathroom, so we had to improvise to create places to lay our wet towels and wash cloths. The shower faucet was complicated to work, and the Hotel provided no instructions for assistance for its use. When the shower was in use, the water on the flowed under the shower door onto the bathroom floor.  The shower head was in the ceiling and soaked our heads when we learned how to turn on the water. Although there were two LED TV sets, one on each floor, the channel selection was meager, and there was no pure easy-listening or classical music selection. Therefore, we never used either TV. The desk on the first floor was too small for comfortable use, and the chair was too low for the desk height. The A/C system was confusing, and there were no instructions available to explain its use. The main room contained a smartphone for telephone calls free of charge within Europe. However, service for “800” numbers was not available on the phone. There was no clock in the room, but we were told that the smartphone could function as a clock. Unfortunately, it automatically turned itself while we slept, so we could not view the clock face to determine the time from our bed before we arose in the morning. For this Hotel to be user-friendly, the owner must make a substantial investment to redesign the guest rooms and live up to its-self-designated “5* Grand Luxe” rating displayed on its website. In our view, the Claris now struggles to deserve a four-star rating.",3,2019,06,15
19,Amazing stay at the Claris,"We stayed at the Claris for two nights and I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It was my birthday the day that we had arrived and the hotel concierge truly made me feel special by sending sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries to the room. We were in a great location as well- within walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and bars. Also, but the hotel breakfast buffet and personalized breakfast included great food and service. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a truly personalized and excellent experience.",5,2019,06,14
19,Wonderful,We stayed for 4 nights at the end of April 19 & had a wonderful time. It was an uplifting experience. There was no downside. An effortless blend of luxury & friendliness. Great rooms. great location & great service.,5,2019,06,14
19,Excellance in Barcelona,"We had a first rate stay at the Hotel Claris. The hotel was close to the historic Gaudi buildings with excellent dining choices within walking distance.
Accommodations were near perfection and the staff was extremely helpful",5,2019,06,12
19,Fantastic Hotel,"5 star hotel which provided a 5 star service. Everyone was only to happy to help with any assistance which was required. From front desk, to house keeping and the doorman. All extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions. Rooms were lovely too. Loved the blockout blinds and very peaceful location.  Would highly recommend. ",5,2019,06,11
19,Lovely 5* Hotel,"This was a gorgeous hotel to enjoy while we were in Barcelona for 4 days! Close to everything!!! 
They know how to treat their guests... start you off with a glass of champagne when you check in.... the Doormen are so nice and helpful!!! Our room was gorgeous and clean!!
We would recommend this to anyone visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona!!!
The rooftop bar is an added bonus!!!",5,2019,06,07
19,Gorgeous hotel,"The staff at Claris are very helpful and very detailed, I told them I was coming in for my partners birthday and they left a kind hand written note in the room and a small bottle of wine. The hotel is immaculate, just as gorgeous outdoors as it is indoors, our room had a lovely gold chandelier over the bed that was very pretty, and a small kitchen area and fridge, plus the bathroom was very big, dual shower and bathtub, we felt very relaxed and comfortable. The rooftop bar and restaurant on the 7th floor are the perfect chill place in the hotel. Superb and gorgeous.",5,2019,06,05
19,Can not fault this place,Extremely close to everything and the service was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the room itself was excellent. Very close to all the major points of interest and attractions. Would definitely stay here again,5,2019,06,04
19,Claris Barcelona May 2019,"I highly recommend Claris. I connected with it on European destinations.com and it met and exceeded all expectations.   It's a beautiful hotel in a great location.  The doormen, front desk, concierge and everyone we encountered were so helpful and polite.",5,2019,06,03
19,Long weekend in Barcelona,"We arrived at Hotel Claris to a warm welcome and a glass of champagne. Very helpful desk staff who were attentive to our needs. 
The room was perfect, nice and quiet as I requested with a street view. Lovely linens well appointed amenities in room. White company toiletries.
The location of the hotel is very central and we walked everywhere. I had a massage in the spa which was heaven. We made good use of the roof top pool bar and restaurant which was incredibly special. Highly recommend. Fabulous stay. Thank you Hotel Claris",5,2019,05,30
19,Amazing service.,The service was amazing. The hotel looks great. I had no issues with the entire trip. They even offered umbrellas for the days it was raining. Champagne when I arrived. The rooftop was great also. It was an amazing experience ,5,2019,05,30
19,"Incredible room, air condition could be better.","The check-process is quick, smooth and painless. The concierge gave us a lot of details about the hotel and some info on the immediate area. They offer you an assortment of drinks while you wait.

The staff is great. Kind, polite and very friendly.

The room (202) layout/design is incredible. I couldn't believe how nice it was. I honestly expected a slightly larger room when we booked but didn't expect a two-level unit. The quality of the room is impressive and that alone will make sure that I book in this hotel again if I travel to Barcelona in the future.

You walk in and there's a little foyer. It's clean, orderly and just well done. If you're a sock wearer like I am, I would be careful walking up the staircase. Its cleaned well and slippery. 

The bathroom layout is an open layout. If you're traveling with a friend, you might want to make a note of this. There's a little privacy door when you're on the toilet. My only gripe is that the water in the shower comes out of the shower area and kind of makes the bathroom floor all well. If you're ok with that, no issues.

The king size bed is a real king and not two twins. Bed and pillows are very comfortable. 

The bad stuff:

Our room was right in front of the house cleanings washing station. Around 7-8am is when they start and you hear the water running and the door slamming. Its annoying when you're on vacation and you're woken up by all of that. 

The air conditioning takes forever to cool down the room. When we arrived, the room was 24 C and humid. After closing the blinds and turning the AC on at full blast (trying to bring it down to 18 C), it took almost two hours to cool off. Also, ""full blast"" is kind of weak.

On the second to last night of our stay, I also noticed a huge stain on our blanket. This was disgusting but, because we were basically on our way out in a day and didn't want to go through house cleaning again, we just flipped the blanket around.

Lastly, the hotel itself is situated in the middle of a lot of things. It makes it easy to go out, do things and then come back to freshen up before heading out again. 

If we come back to Barcelona, we'll probably stay here again unless we found a better deal elsewhere.

Also, for shoppers, all the expensive name brand shops are a block away.",4,2019,05,30
19,Class and Charm.,"We stayed in the Claris Hotel in May after a Transatlantic cruise. The hotel is in a wonderful part of Barcelona close to almost everything you might want to do or see. The Claris is quite different, it is a modern hotel in a old mansion and it has been done in impeccable taste, each room holds something unique in it, and no two rooms are the same. The staff at this hotel are some of the friendliest people you will ever meet, they are warm and happy, always smiling even at busy check-in times. Another bonus wine and water in the lobby all the time.",5,2019,05,27
19,Modern Boutique hotel,Great location. Room was quiet. We were upgraded to a duplex. Actual room to sleep  is small and narrow - king bed width with 2 small side tables. High ceiling gave impression of more room. No chair in actual room area. Lighting in bathroom was  terrible and no makeup mirror. Only one trash can situated in the bathroom. Good shower but hand shower was very fierce and leaked onto the bathroom floor. Large bathroom sinks with no space to put toiletries alongside. There were small drawers underneath sink. Sitting area above was nicely done but I prefer space in the room. Rooftop pool and bar area is small. We went up there late afternoon but it was crowded with nowhere to sit. Breakfast room was delightful with good food. Staff were good. Hotel had modern finishes and interesting layout but would not stay here again. I prefer a larger room with at least one chair and a bathroom with decent lighting. This was the worst lighting I have ever experienced. ,4,2019,05,26
19,Highly Recommend,"I highly recommend the Hotel Claris. The experience was superb from check (yay for a welcome drink) to check out. The hotel is conveniently located near excellent shopping, restaurants and not a far drive from the beach and nightlife. The concierge was great and had excellent recommendations for dinner and things to do in Barcelona. The decor in the room was well appointed and had a very boutique feel. The waterfall shower was cozy but refreshing.  The size was typical of most European hotels. The only gripe we had was that housekeeping's post was up against the wall of our hotel room so we could hear them every morning.",4,2019,05,22
19,The best city hotel I have ever stayed at!,"Great location close to all main attractions in Barcelona, beautiful decor, quiet, wonderful service,  The hotel has a beautiful pool on the top floor and a charming museum with it's pre Columbian art.  ",5,2019,05,21
19,Well located,"The hotel is well located and the roof top is lovely, however, we did enjoy the nightlife and therefore like a lie-in. 

The hotel has hardwood floors. So the irony of our room being street facing but the noise from around the room was greater in the mornings amused me but not my good lady with a sore head! LOL!

Also the room service did not match the quality of the food from what I saw in the restaurant on the terrace. Sadly due to the quality of room service we didn’t book the restaurant. But wish I had!

The bathroom was generous and the staff were nearly always welcoming. It’s a trait of Barcelona to have mediocre service in even the best places across the town so don’t expect too much.

To note if you like a good night Boca Grande was lovely, they even had a DJ in the toilet!",4,2019,05,21
19,20 year anniversary,"Sublime hotel set in a lovely part of Barcelona in the eixample district. Perfectly positioned for everything either by foot or the metro at passieg de gracia. Really recommend the roof top bar, the service was excellent from the bar staff.",5,2019,05,19
19,Great Hotel!,"The hotel staff goes beyond in having a clean room, helping you with your luggage, the room was great and having a free travel buddy a smart phone during your stay when it is your time in Barcelona made it an awesome experience. 
",5,2019,05,19
19,It started off ok,"So we had booked a suite for 3 nights in the hotel bagues for a getaway break, we received a telephone call from the hotel saying the floor with the suites was under maintenance and they had booked us into the hotel Claris, a sister hotel of theirs.
 They said we could have the suite for the same price! thats nice of them seeing as they are the same price on booking website anyway.
when we arrived at the Claris it was a nice welcome and the concierge phillipe was very good and we thought we would like this hotel.
Unfortunatly the suite was nothing special it had a mezzanine floor but still very small for the 400 euros a night price tag, A windo with 2 electric blinds, i found out why after i opened them... it looked out to..... other rooms so no view whatsoever, the shower took an age to get warm. No tea/coffee facilities, not even a vanity desk where my wife can apply her makeup.... 
then to top it off we get stuck in a broken elevator that kept jerking up and down and the doors kept opening between floors, very distraughtfull if you dont like lifts anyway, not even an apology. 
we love barcelona and visit often so would i stay here or their sister hotel again?
 definately NOT",2,2019,05,17
19,Fabulous Hotel with great staff,We went for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. We had a Junior Suite and complementary Cava. The staff were so attentive especially Alba who did everything to ensure a great stay.The pool although small was great after a day sight seeing.,5,2019,05,17

19,5 star feels,"Amazing artsy hotel with a modern yet boho twist. Rooftop pool served amazing craft drinks with a knowledgeable bartender that gave us restaurant advice. Drinks were around 15 by the pool but realllllllly good. Demian walked me to my room and did an excellent job describing the property along with its history. Requests were delivered in a appropriate amount of time and I felt personalized with the wine I received. I would highly recommend especially for the price, you can’t get this service anywhere else. Only thing this hotel lacked was name recognition.  ",5,2019,05,13
19,Delightful place to stay in Barcelona,Loved our stay at the Hotel Claris!  Make sure you venture up to the rooftop bar for a relaxing atmosphere poolside.  We found the staff from the doorman to the reception desk and restaurant to be very warm and welcoming.,5,2019,05,11

Very clean hotel. Lovely room with coffee machine, mini bar and snacks (at extra cost)
The spa was great they even celebrated my birthday with cake and champagne and sang to me without me mentioning it to them. 
They also left a bottle of champagne in my room when I got back from the spa.

19,Memorable Hotel in Barcelona,"All of Hotel staffs are very kind and supportive, we enjoyed the stay very much.
The breakfast is ecellent, both staffs and foods. Especially floor manager is very kind and he is sometimes funny to make us very happy.",4,2019,05,09
19,Excellently appointed 5 star Hotel in the midst of bustling Barcelona,"Love this hotel. It's one of the best hotels I've stayed at, the others being like the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore & the Pullman Hotel in Shanghai. Got the junior suite cos the duplex was not available. Very nicely decorated with Yucatán theme. The hotel even boasts a gallery with authentic  Yucatán artifacts. 

7th floor houses a rooftop restaurant that allows a grand view of the junction the hotel ulis situated on. Gives a nice aerial view of the roofs around the vicinity. Prices are on the €€€ side but you'd expect that given that Claris Hotel is a 5🌟hotel. 

Service when we arrived was impeccable. Doorman helped unload the luggages & concierge was really diligent in making sure the luggages we're safely kept as we arrived earlier than the stipulated check in time. Reception was great taking the time to explain the details of the room & hotel. They even expedited the room turn around for us and got it done in an hour. 

Only complaint my wife & I had was that the room was not very brightly lit, which probably was to keep in line with the theme & poshness feel. It did make it difficult to see when I was shaving & when she was putting on makeup, but I'm really picking bones here. Haha.... 

Would definitely recommend a stay at this upscale hotel if you are looking at 5 atars hotels in Barcelona. Do note that other hotels might claim to be 5 stars here but may not be really one.",5,2019,05,02
19,Great hotel in the middle of Barcelona,Great location - walking distance to many major attractions and metro stations. We got the most basic room type but it is still roomy (particularly in Europe). Very comfortable bed and pillows. Great amenities - Nespresso machine and a local phone to use in the city. Tasty deco in the hotel lobby and the room. Nearby there are some nice cafe/restaurants.,4,2019,05,02
19,Good choice for first time traveller in Barcelona ,"This is my first time in Barcelona and found the hotel location is quite convenient (in between) to both Sagrada Familia church and Gothic area, where you can stop by at Picasso museum.
The reception team (especially Ms. Kati and Oscar) are very friendly and helpful .. 
Breakfast was really excellent.. toasts came wrapped with napkin to maintain its temperature and moist .. omelette was made in unusually square wrap shape and it was superb.. the breakfast team led by Jimmy was so friendly and accommodating and attentive .. what a great way to start your day !! 
The room was nice and bright and big enough.. and toilet with view of Barcelona street .. haha
I also tried its award winning spa .. Mayan .. interesting concept.. however the sauna I like it hotter .. massage was good.. 
Recommended for first time visitor in Barcelona!
",5,2019,04,27
19,Well desig hotel,"The claris hotel is well design and up to date hotel
Thr room (junior Suite) is beautiful, big and  very clean .,  
The bathroom is decorated with bisazza mosaic and have a big shower, jacuzzi and small sauna
The staf clean the room twice a day 
The reception team is very kind and give personal attention",5,2019,04,26
19,Barcelona Trip,A fabulous hotel with amazing staff. Ideal location and ten minutes walk to La Ramblas. Would highly recommend. The pool area was nice but small so not good for young families however older children would be quite happy. We did not eat on site so cannot comment on the food. Good hotel for families with older children. Ours were 11 and 13. ,5,2019,04,26
19,Great Boutique Hotel with Exceptional Service ,"The location of this hotel was perfect for my holiday in Barcelona.  Located near all all the high end retail shops like, Gucci, Hermes... as well as walking distance to great restaurants and great sight seeing. 

The hotel has doorman and large lobby the Front Desk staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  My check in was easy and we were shown to our room.

The room is adequate.  Actually quite large for a European boutique hotel room.  We did upgrade from a standard room.   The bathroom is a good size with hair dryer and flat iron,  plenty of paper products and shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The sleeping area is cramped and there is very little closet space which is located on the far wall of the room -  there is a loft with sofa, coffee maker, mini fridge, television which is where we put our clothes.  

Pros:  great location,  rooftop bar and pool,  exceptional service and very friendly customer service focused staff.

Cons:  closet configuration and location within room in my opinion is horrible and not nearly enough space for two people.   
 We had issue with our AC and getting the room cool and conformance for us.  ( this is partly because we run hot all the time and the high ceilings). I will say they staff addressed the issue quickly with a maintenance worker addressing our issue.  ",4,2019,04,26
19,Not a great experience,"Definitely not a five star hotel, It didn't come close to my expectations. It has 'spa' in the name but they definitely do not have spa facilities. We had to venture to a FOUR star hotel to use their spa and overall that hotel was A LOT better. Checking in was not a friendly experience, there was no warmth towards us and it was just very rushed... From the pictures the rooms look nice but maybe we were just unlucky as the first room they put us in was in the corner of a corridor next to a fire exit which when staff were coming in and out of the door made a LOUD bang every time. It stunk of cigarettes. We asked to be moved as the room was dark and the bathroom was SO outdated. The walls were messy and after speaking with reception they actually said this room was an upgrade... We saw the second room and decided to go with that, purely on the basis that the bathroom was a lot better and it wasn't next to a fire exit, other than that it was basic. The rooms have ZERO sound proofing, we could hear someone running a bath either upstairs or next door as well as flushing the loo etc. At 8am the cleaners started cleaning the room next door to us and we could hear EVERYTHING. Overall, I have stayed in many amazing five star hotels in my time, this hotel didn't even come close.. I recommend Yurbban Passage Hotel & Spa as that hotel had a great atmosphere when you walk in, better price as well as an actual spa that you can use without having to book a treatment.",2,2019,04,24
19,Rip off,"The hotel charged us twice for our stay. They retained our card details and after 6month of our stay they charged us again on our card. The email communication with them was very poor about returning our money back. They were very rude and not apologetic at all. Finally I had to contact my bank for reversing card payment on the charge. I am an avid traveller and something like this has never happened to me. 
Point 1: they charged us for the stay twice without even prior acknowledgement.
Point 2: they didn’t want to pay our international fees back.
Point 3: it caused unnecessary stress dealing with them.",1,2019,04,21
19,Hotel Claris ,I was there in Barcelona and I stayed there in this Hotel Claris.This is one of the best Hotel. The staffs are very friendly and they take very care of their guest.The hotel was very neat and clean.We can also see the beautiful and sunset view from the roof top of this hotel ,5,2019,04,15
19,Linda Taylor ,"Amazing hotel,wonderful staff team who attend to all of our needs and more. Both myself and daughter had a bottle of bubbles brought to our room from the management to help us celebrate our birthdays. Can’t wait to return here as perfect hotel in a perfect location. ",5,2019,04,15
19,Luxury break,Fabulous hotel with friendly staff who go out of their way to ensure you have everything you need. Within walking distance from all of the 'must see' locations in Barcelona but far enough away from the crowds to ensure a relaxing stay. We loved it.,5,2019,04,14
19,"amazingly nice folks, clean, modern, great outdoors rooftop!","nothing like a bottle of wine watching the sunset on the rooftop. Service folks were efficient and very accommodating, recognizing us whenever we entered/exited. They also had recommended a tour guide, who was super!",5,2019,04,13
19,Hotel Claris,The hotel room decor and facilities were very beautiful and clean! The front desk staff was very friendly. We had booked the hotel originally for just 3 nights however decided to book for one additional night after we traveled to Madrid for 2 days. They were able to store our luggage while away. Both times our room was upgraded. There was a slight miscommunication on the reservation for the additional night but the front desk staff promptly solved the issue and upgraded us to a junior suite for the inconvenience. Would definitely recommend.,5,2019,04,09
19,Claris Hotel - Barcelona,"Loved the Claris Hotel. Staff could not have been any nicer, and incredibly helpful.  They provided us with every detail that we requested (directions, restaurant recommendations for locals, etc) with a smile.  So friendly.  The hotel is a great boutique hotel, the rooms nice size for a european hotel, and the location was good, we walked everywhere from the hotel.  Highly recommend it for your trip to Barcelona.",5,2019,04,09
19,Mr S Robinson,"Excellent hotel in every sense of the word, clean tidy great location excellent bar and pool great staff.

All attraction are within walkable distance from hotel, staff could not help enough 

We will return soon with friends",5,2019,04,09
19,This IS Five star!,"First, a very warm and welcoming staff. Next, quite breathtaking rooms, ours with a mezzanine level (we stayed in two different rooms on different ends of a week in Catalonia) that are beautifully decorated. There’s a lounge area with comfortable sofas and all you need - coffee, wine snacks. Splendid bathrooms with lots of deep pile towels. Huge beds. This is called luxury! Fabulous roof terrace for an aperitif. All this and it’s wonderfully placed in central Barcelona. Concierge recommendations were fabulous (wow, that tapas!). You can skip an overpriced breakfast at great local bakeries. A wonderful hotel. ",5,2019,04,08
19,Not as good as you thought ,"The hotel isolation of noise is very bad, what is happening outside the corridor you are affected,  people with luggage move in and out, workers cleaning trolley in and out, it is not easy to stay rest in your room.  ",1,2019,04,08
19,Very good time at Claris,"every thing was good at Claris.
Especially it was good location, so we came back to hotel and took break for a while, and then went out again.
all room elements were comfortable.
Room was everyday cleaned up perfect.
",5,2019,04,02
19,Very nice place to stay,"The hotel was a beautifully updated old building.  The rooms are as modern as the building is old...a terrific and very satisfying mix, old and new. The staff is as good as you will find; friendly and efficient.Carlos welcomed us warmly and checked us in. Veorges handled our gear and showed us all of the wonderful features in our room.Our breakfast host was Alvin who is the kindest and most helpful man.  The breakfast was spectacular; nothing is not included.  The food in the restaurant on the top floor has a limited menu, is good,expensive and a bit fussy for my taste. My wife might not agree.
The only thing I really found deficient was the fancy bathtub/shower.  It just didn’t seem safe for an elderly person.",5,2019,04,02
19,Great hotel location for all attractions,"Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Quality rooms, great restaurant great pool, location was walking distance to all major attractions within the city. Staff attitude was excellent too, clean and apotlspo hotel we will be returning ",5,2019,03,29
19,Please be aware that the hotel management can decide to cancel your reservation at any time,"I have a terrible experience with the Claris hotel and their management. Please have in mind that my reservation made through the booking.com site was canceled illegally by the hotel. Some days after my reservation they sent me an email urging me to reconfirm my reservation at a 60% higher price due a mistake from their side. Being a frequent booking.com user I was quite surprised to receive such an answer. It was not the first time I had found an attractive rate in a hotel having in mind the hotel promotion campaigns and discounts. In addition, I had not done anything wrong in the reservation process. 
However, it is the first time a hotel decides to cancel my reservation due an error on their side.",1,2019,03,26
19,A perfect example of why you shouldn't pick a hotel based on it's stars,"Until this experience I thought 5* vouched for luxury, stylish interior and excellent customer service, but Claris turned out to be the exception. 

I expected a 5* hotel offered a king or queen bed with a confortable top mattress and not 2 hard single bed matresses sliding apart.

I expected a 5* hotel to find it relevant to install soundproof windows towards the busy street so I could sleep through the night and not wake up everytime a truck or motorcycle passed by.

I  expected a 5* hotel paid some attention to the consequences for the rooms on the floor below when having a bar and restaurant open till late on the roof of the hotel so their guests below could go to bed before midnight at get some sleep.

I expected a 5* hotel was more stylish and consistent in its interior style and not a place that looks like a huge compromise between a handful of different interior designers with completely different perspecitves on what a hotel should look like. 

I would have expected a 5* hotel staff to be more solution oriented and interested in resolving the issues once and for all when customers have complaints - rather than going for a quick fix with questionable results.

Having said that Claris isn't a bad choice. I found the price for a room at Claris reasonable for what you get - as long as you do not compare it to other 5* hotels",3,2019,03,25
19,Barcelona on Business,"The hotel was suggested to me as base of operations for business meeting while in Barcelona. It met all my expectations and found very friendly and helpful staff throughout my stay. They coordinated transportation pick up arrangements from and back to the airport. The room was spacious enough, I had business conversations with my colleagues. It is also within walking distance of Paseo de Gracia to take the city tour bus or walk to Plaza de Cataluña or Las Ramblas. I will definitely recommend and will be back next time I visit the city on business.",5,2019,03,24
19,Claris apartments,"Claris apartments a located near the hotel and you should pass to the hotel reciption to finalize the check in and take the keys and all the information about your stay.
The apartment was clean and all what you need is available specialy at the kitchen.",5,2019,03,24
19,Pure luxury in the heart of Barcelona,The Claris hotel is a very chic hotel in a central area of Barcelona close to many attractions. The room we stayed in was absolutely stunning with a unique interior of ancient art works. The service of the staff were excellent and made our stay more pleasurable.,5,2019,03,19
19,Classy yet not stuffy,"Great hotel right next to Paseig de Gracia, in the prettiest part if Barcelona. The hotel is well-appointed, with beautiful Egyptian relics throughout. As a frequent traveler that appreciates comfort w/o attitude, the Claris hit a home-run: I am definitely going back on my next trip to Barcelona; tons of value here!",5,2019,03,17
19,Definitely would not stay there again,"I am a regular Traveller and love finding new cozy hotels along the way. This is definitely not one that made the cut. 
I booked an executive room. They put us in a very cramped room with an awkward bathroom with no counterplace whatsoever and sink and tub drains that didnt work. The phone in the room they give you for convenience and window blinds also did not work. A light flipped on every time someone moved making it very difficult to sleep. When I checked online the next morning I realized they put us in a cheaper superior room. They ended up changing us but refused to acknowledge their mistake and credit the difference for the first night.  Even in the upgraded room it was like a herd of elephants resided above us. And I did not appreciate housekeeping blowing in without any hesitation while I was just coming out of the shower. Additionally they tried to bill my credit card three days prior to our arrival. They say that's their protocol. I've NEVER heard of a hotel billing three days before you arrive. And my cc fraud alert would not allow it so for three days they threatened to cancel my reservation. Their rooftop pool staff were not efficient and occasionally downright rude. And for some reason the cushions were never on the lounge chairs. There were just too many reasons to be disappointed in this hotel. With all of the options available I will never stay with Claris or derby hotels again.

Thanks much! Wendy",2,2019,03,17
19,Our number one,"Just perfect. What a wonderful place. The location was perfect, just 20 minutes by foot from the Sagrada Familia and within walking distance to pretty much everything :0) We walked literally everywhere, didn’t use metro or taxis. 
Our room was beautiful and despite having windows on the side to the main street it was quite and we could sleep very well. The room was spacious and beautifully furnished. The bathroom was also nice and quite spacious, with a large and beautiful bathtub. 
We had breakfast in the hotel (only once) because we wanted to try different foods in the city, but this one was absolutely delicious. There were many things to choose from, cheeses, meats, and breads. There is a small a‘ la carte menu as well with scrambled, pouched and fried eggs etc. Very tasty and beautifully presented. We also had variety of fresh fruit and yoghurt. The service in the breakfast restaurant was so friendly and smiling. 
The employees at the reception and front entrance were wonderful, very warm and empathetic (we had a little accident in the city centre). They asked us if we need something to drink and politely advised us what to do next. Simply genuine, considerate and  professional. Thank you guys. 
As we asked for our car to be parked in front of the hotel upon leaving, we found two bottles of water inside it. This was such a nice and touching gesture. They knew we will be driving a long way... We will definetely be back to this hotel and its people. ",5,2019,03,10
19,Best Stay,"We are currently staying at the Claris Hotel and loving every minute. The second we arrived the front desk staff were so kind with helping us - we were offered a complimentary glass of cava at the desk and were upgraded to a suite! Within minutes of being in our room the doorbell rings - they brought in a complimentary bottle of cava & chocolate covered strawberries to treat us for our anniversary! So so kind of them. What a treat. We love our gorgeous room which has every amenity you need - bathtub with massagers, large room for Europe and sitting room with large sofa. We have spent time on the terrace with the impeccable service and amazing drinks as well. We have loved our stay and wish we could stay here longer! Thank you Claris Hotel for an incredible time. Xx, Emma & Zach",5,2019,03,10
19,Best experience in Barcelona ever!,"This was not the first time we stayed in Barcelona but the Claris has been without any doubt the best choice so far. Literally everything from the location to their staff goes above and beyond what you may expect from a 5 star hotel. The reception has such an amazing touch in pampering you and accommodating every single request with smile and professionalism, the breakfast is outstanding and their rooftop terrace a gem! Must visit again!",5,2019,03,09
19,Excellent with capital E,"Hotel  Clarins was a great surprise, as we had very high expectations.
We have stayed for longer holidays at its sisters hotels in Madrid (Urban) and Paris (Banke), and had a very good experience, particularly in Madrid, where one can’t find faults in any party of its services or installations.

However the Claris exceeded our expectations, from the moment you we were welcomed in with big friendly smiles and a glass of bubble. As you step in the hotel the wonderful smell and beautiful, tranquil art and decoration, transform your mood positively. 
And so, throughout  our stay of five nights, not for a moment we felt let down. 
The rooms are beautifully decorated yet cosy and the beds extremely comfortable, the service impeccable and friendly.

We will definitely return.",5,2019,03,06
19,Highly recommend,"Originally decorated hotel with a classy feel. Excellent service and reception with high pro and reactivity 
 Highly recommend. 
Great area too with two tour bus lines stops less than a five minute walk away.  
",5,2019,03,05
19,Fantastic ,"My husband and I spent the weekend at The Claris for our 18th wedding anniversary. We couldn’t have picked a better hotel. Checking in was efficient and pleasant. We were unable to check in early, however they took our case to allow us to go sightseeing. Our room was just gorgeous, executive, it was a great size, decor lovely and the bed massive and comfortable. Staff all friendly and helpful. Location ideal. I would definitely return ",5,2019,03,04
19,It's the money worth.,"It's the money worth. Obviously not cheap, but it took us through an unforgettable experience. 
A special hotel, full of small details. A flower, a glass of cava... Amazingly relaxing room, very comfortable bed, great breakfast. ",5,2019,03,04
19,Unique boutique hotel in an ideal city location,"My wife and I recently stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel staff were magnificent and a credit to the hotel ... nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel special from our arrival .. special thanks to Nelle, Lorena and Oscar for all their care and time taken to answer our questions.",5,2019,03,04
19,Excellent stay,"I loved the service. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Great location. Nice food. The gym is kind of small, though. I would recommended it to all my friends and colleagues. Keep up the good work. See you next visit. ",5,2019,03,02
19,Waste of money,"Before arrival requested a quiet room, instead given room below roof top terrace-- probably one of loudest rooms I have ever stayed in.  Shower/tub grout showing mold building.  ""Gift"" promised by booking directly with hotel never materialized.  Upon check-in, had to request exact amount to be charged to my credit card before running payment.  ",2,2019,02,27
19,A Great Birthday Getaway,"The Claris Hotel in Barcelona Spain by far made my birthday celebration a warm and welcoming experience. The staff is very accommodating, friendly and professional, from the front door to housekeeping service. The location is perfect because it’s central to accessing transportation to get you to sightseeing, shopping and feeding your appetite. The hotel’s decor is sleek with artwork that graces each guest room and a special private gallery especially for the guest. If you are looking for a a hotel to add to your travel experience, book the Claris Hotel and Spa you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,02,24
19,Great for a short break,"We spent New Years Eve here for three day and were well cared for and had a wonderful time,the sky roof terrace is a delight mornings and evening . This area also has a great pool and heated of course at this time of the year .",5,2019,02,20
19,The Standard,"This is the standard against which all other hotels will be measured.  Incredible staff, beautiful room, wonderful dining, a great location and a very artful environment.  A fantastic portal to Barcelona. Do not hesitate to book your experience!",5,2019,02,18

Barcelona feels even better when you stay at claris hotel
we will definitely come back here and hopefully there'll be availability in this hotel",5,2019,02,14
19,Exceptionally Warm and Helpful Staff,"Recently stayed at this wonderful hotel - ideally centrally located just off the main avenues but within 100 metres to avoid the traffic. From the moment we arrived the reception we received from staff was so warm and welcoming. A nice glass of cava was most appreciated, prior to being informed that as our trip was a ‘special occasion’ our accommodation had been upgraded from normal rooms to junior suites! Our rooms were both beautiful, functional and individual with every amenity. Lovely roof top terrace with a small pool, (not appropriate given the time of year), restaurant and bar. From the informative doorman, the reception staff et al - thank you for making our trip so special - can not wait to return.",5,2019,02,12
19,Fantastic service!!,"My wife and I visited for a few days recently for our anniversary, from the moment we arrived (including a complementary upgrade) to the moment we left we received exceptional service. Didn’t use the restaurants but the breakfast was fantastic, the location perfect only bettered by the people who work there. Loved the city and the stay, highly recommended!",5,2019,02,11
19,Super worth it!,"We stayed at Claris for a few days and we found it impeccable. From the warm reception to the  harmonious spaces, the beautiful rooms. Breakfast was to die for, I’m looking forward to the next stay! The style is unique and combines pre-colombian art with modern furniture.",5,2019,02,10
19,Room with a view,"Very nice location and friendly staff and nice rooms , superb rooftop bar and restaurant ,breakfast was great and very nice eggs Benedict, the location was near all the shopping aérea and the spa in hotel was very relaxing after a working day ",5,2019,01,28
19,Impressive,"Never have I felt more at home and at ease in a hotel. The Claris has something that one rarely finds: It’s a combination of very friendly people that do their utmost best to make your stay one that you’ll always remember, and a warm and truely interest in life and it’s meaning. I’ve never slept near statues and pottery of many, many hundreds years old, that made me become more aware of what is important in life. Parts of the Mayan legacy are exhibited near our room, and just 100 meter from here is a rare treasure, a museum about ancient Egypt, from the owner of this hotel that really is very impressive. What a beauty all together. Hope to be able to return here!",5,2019,01,27
19,The best hotel in Barcelona,"I travel to Barcelona often.  Nowhere else do I feel as welcome as I do in the Claris.  The staff is genuinely kind and helpful, the rooms are comfortable, charming and with a lot of character, and breakfast is top quality.  The location is simply perfect: very close to all that Barcelona has to offer, but away from the noise. ",5,2019,01,27
19,An extraordinary experience,"It was my first time staying in the Claris Hotel, and I adored the experience. The staff were all warm, friendly and helpful. I have not a single complaint. We enjoyed the attention to detail from the floral scent to the design of the room. We frequently need to stay in Barcelona so we will return. Many thanks.",5,2019,01,26
19,Service could not be any better ,"Stayed here for a few days sightseeing. The location is ideal as it is close to the main tourist attractions. The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable. The quality of the breakfast was good and there was a good choice. Used the small gym on the top floor, it is fine and the view from the treadmill is great. However what makes this hotel stand out is the staff, everyone is so friendly and so helpful. The management should be really proud of their team. If you are looking for a modern hotel with good old fashioned service, this is the place to come. ",5,2019,01,18
19,Great Location and Quality Hotel,One block away from Passaig de Gracia and only a quick 10 minute walk to historic downtown.  Hotel staff was very friendly.   Great food options in historic downtown and great shopping.  Would stay here again.,5,2019,01,16

19,Good experience,location good far from noise and very close to The Rambla  staff & reception excellent very fast check in & check outroom size goodcomfort & clean & very goodbreakfast not match with five star hotels,5,2019,01,08
19,5 Star Hotel / 6 Star Service,"There are a few 5 star hotel options in the area, but we decided to try Hotel Claris based on other reviews and their own posted pictures, which are accurate.  This art themed hotel was beautifully designed with attention to every detail.  However, the staff was even more impressive.  Everyone is consistently professional, courteous and knowledgeable of the area.  Their concierge service is top notch and very responsive in every aspect even before we got to Barcelona.  Nicolas (at the front desk) and Anastasya definitely represented these principals, which is appreciated, especially when you are paying for a high end stay.  

Some minor inconveniences would include thin walls where you can hear neighboring conversations.  The stand up shower had a poor drainage design which would get the bathroom floor wet when used.  There was a small refrigerator, but it was stocked with items for a cost.   So, there was no room for your own drinks or food, if needed.  

Overall, the location, design and service will definitely have us look for Derby Collection Hotels when traveling to other countries.  Thank you.

19,Great New Years ,Okay here we go staff perfect probably one of the best so far ... location just of the main drag ideal for the attractions possible an extra 10 minute walk over and above .. room good minus has to be the walls very thin ... art work dotted all over the hotel lovely ... roof top bar and pool fantastic ..

19,Great Birthday Trip,The Staff at the Claris was very attentive and sent me a bottle of champagne to our room for my birthday.  You are certainly made extremely comfortable and will feel right at home in this hotel.  I would highly recommend the Claris to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona.  ,5,2019,01,01
19,Return visit number 4,"Fourth time to stay at this 5 star gem in the very heart of Barcelona. The hotel has been refurbished since my last visit and is completely on trend, well appointed junior suite delivering a new luxurious bathroom and providing 6 perfect nights sleep. Staff at this hotel are amount the most helpful, courteous and charming in all my travels. Always my first choice when visiting Barcelona. ",5,2018,12,28

19,50th birthday bash in Barcelona,"Amazing hotel perfect location staff excellent couldn’t do enough for you rooms beautiful. pillows amazing. The best roof top terrace and bar, excellent value cocktails start from €8. Prosecco on arrival and allowed to check in early. Absolutely perfect weekend. ",5,2018,12,18
19,Nice but not 5*,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Claris and it served us well as a central base to explore Barcelona. The hotel and room were clean and the staff generally pleasant. The hotel did not, however, feel like a 5*. The room decor was a bit tired, the toilet flush was intermittently working, the bed was quite hard and the lack of tea making facilities or even an ironing board just didn’t give a luxury feel. We were looking forward to spending a few hours relaxing in the hotel spa but on arrival discovered that it’s only really a sauna and treatment rooms, and the prices seemed to just be made up on the spot, with €30 per person quoted just to simply use the sauna, or €130 for a massage, which just seemed astronomical! In summary, it’s a pleasant hotel if you can get it at a reasonable price but don’t expect 5* luxury. ",3,2018,12,08
19,Beautiful hotel,"Excellent stay, great service from the glass of cava on arrival to the speedy checkout. The recommendation they gave us for a steak restaurant was an absolute find! Lovely spacious room and although not cheap, definitely worth the money.",5,2018,12,03
19,beautiful hotel in barcelona,"Hotel was first class. Internet was very fast. Very friendly staff.  Location was walking distance to all the places we wanted to go to like eating places, shopping and Sagrada Familia churchWould definitely stay here again when I come back.  It is pricey but I get what i pay for and it was worth it. ",5,2018,11,29
19,Pleasant stay,"Wonderful staff right from the very first steps into the hotel. A special mention to OSCAR who has been incredibly friendly, helpful and shared many good tips with us.
Hotel has 5 star services and treats. No complaints.
Rooms and pleasant and cultural features are present everywhere. 
Many complementary extras very much appreciated: handy phone with unltd international calls and data, free entry to the Egyptian Museum and much more...
Location is great too.",5,2018,11,28
19,Hotel Claris Barcelona,"If you fancy a long weekend break in Barcelona and you want to be spoilt, then book this hotel.

From the minute we arrived till the minute we left, the management and staff of this small 5* hotel treated us like we were there only guests in the hotel. The detail to service was first class.

It is central to everything you would want in Barcelona, with designer shops and good restaurants and bars all on the doorstep.

But it's the attention to detail that stands out. They must see hundreds if not thousands of guests,  yet they remembered our names, what drinks we liked, how we liked our omelette at breakfast etc.

We cannot wait to visit this fabulous hotel in this fabulous city again.",5,2018,11,26
19,A Wonderful hotel,"A unique hotel , with ancient artifacts in the rooms. Clean , classy , efficient well situated. Superb breakfast, Staff efficient , pleasant and courteous. Rooms well furnished . Ours was quiet and peaceful ",5,2018,11,26
19,Great little hotel near upscale shopping,"Nice hotel for the € really. Get a 2 level suite with street facing windows! The interior rooms are cave-like FYI. Decor is really cool, but dark. Skip the KAO restaurant - no flavor. Breakfast was amazing! Great service all around.",5,2018,11,25
19,A perfect experience,We began our honeymoon here and were immediately accommodated upon arrival (7 am). We were upgraded to a suite for our 4 night stay and we're treated with such kindness. The breakfast is AMAZING. the rooftop pool was beautiful and a great place to relax in afternoon after sightseeing the whole morning. It is PRIME LOCATION as it is close walking distance to many tourist destinations but it's not right in the middle of the tourist mess. I will definitely be returning to this hotel when we return to Barcelona.,5,2018,11,23
19,Great Location and a bit different ,"Stayed here for business for nearly a week 

Interesting rooms with all the right luxury appointments.   

Interesting art work which is not really my thing.    Good rooftop pool and restaurant.

Fantastic front desk friendly and very effective, especially when I needed a doctor.   They just handled it and made the process so easy, I really appreciate their efforts. ",4,2018,11,19
19,first time to Barcelona,"Great hotel the service was excellent. The location is great in the middle of everything shopping, restaurants..
The roof top restaurant was beautiful. The reception was awesome not only did they recommend great restaurants they called and made reservation for us and had a taxi waiting.",5,2018,11,13
19,Great location and wonderful service,This was our irate visit to Barcelona.  HotelClris is in a great location and you can walk to many of the most interesting and important places in the city.  Great shopping and restaurants are also nearby.  I especially enjoyed walking to the Segrada Familia early in the morning!,5,2018,11,11
19,Poor customer service,"Nobody answer phone in reception, after request to bring iron, next 20 minuts nothing. I had to go to reception myself. No place for work. At the end cleaning service came to my room, when I have been in bathroom. They thought I left hotel!!!!!",3,2018,11,11
19,Very nice,"Lovely 5 stars hotel ,we stayed there one night . The hotel is very modern . It carries a beautiful pre- Colombian artwork  collection and is only a block away from the Eixample neighborhood and  the shops on the Main Street Passeig de Gràcia .Our room ( a junior suite )was beautifully decorated with pieces of Mayan art . Nice size bathroom , i I loved the mosaïque design on the floor . There is a small fitness on the top floor next to the outdoor swimming pool . The view from the  terrace and the bar is nice there is also a restaurant .",4,2018,11,08
19,"Great food, great staff and service",We were starting a Mediterranean Cruise but we stayed one here at the Claris Hotel before we started the cruise.  Very nice and clean hotel.  All employees could speak English and were very helpful to answer all our questions as this was our first trip to Spain.,5,2018,11,07
19,Great hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Claris for 3 nights in a duplex suite, we had an amazing stay. The hotel is lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was stunning and spotlessly clean. The location of the hotel is great, it is in a really nice area which is a walk or taxi journey away from all amenities. We loved Barcelona !The only negative for us was the transfer to/from the airport which was booked through the agent so does not reflect on the hotel. We received a very poor service and would recommend guests to get a private taxi instead. Apart from this, we had a really great few days and would not hesitate to return to Hotel Claris, it is a beautiful hotel.",5,2018,11,07
19,Top but,"Top location 
Top place
Excellent service 
Really unique 
But 
We booked a junior suite and the bed in one of the rooms was broken 
After four nights the only solution was change rooms , too much trouble so we stayed 
Sorry but at this level of stars we expected something more ....",4,2018,11,06
19,Hotel Claris great location and great staff ,"Myself and my wife had a wonderful time in Barcelona 
And to have chosen the Hotel Claris was a great bonus 
Breakfast was great 
Restaurant was on the rooftop and the food and service were amazing 
Would definitely recommend this hotel 
",5,2018,11,04
19,Contemporary with the addition of ancient artifacts,"We stayed at the Claris Barcelona for 4 days the end of October 2018. The lobby was imaginative, contemporary architecture with the addition of a collection of ancient artifacts from two very different centuries. The front dest staff was eager to help with any request and spoke excellent English. The breakfasts were sumptuous with fresh fruits and made-to-order omelets, eggs, meats, etc. On the roof was a wonderful terrace with a swimming pool, bar and roof-top view of the city. The room was a little small but a good value for the money. The hotel was centrally located. I would stay there again without question.",4,2018,11,04
19,A bad experience,I'm not recommending!! To aggresive girls on the reception!!!!I come  to Barcelona every 2 months to for a business  and I'm saying only in 5 star hotel... Claris hotel Not worth this  stars!!! Too bad!,1,2018,11,04
19,My trip to Barcelona ,"I stayed in Claris apartment for 5 days, it was excellent. I will reserve it again and again.The location,cleanliness,facilities and the staff were very nice. I would like to thank the staff everyone of them , sorry I didn’t get the names .
Finally thanks again to the staff ",5,2018,11,04
19,Romantic weekend,I had a lovely stay here with my husband.Every amenity was thought of and we felt well cared for. Next time I would plan to book the room a day in advance of arrival so there wasn't a long wait in the lobby but I was able to use the roof to relax and able to explore the museum in the hotel.,5,2018,11,01
19,Short holidays in Barcelona,"Located near the famous La pedrera a modern 5 star hotel.Helpfull staff, big and clean rooms nice and healthy breakfast.Everything around the corner.I would definately stay there again.Also had spa facilities and gave us free pass for the Egyptian museum",5,2018,10,31
19,Love Barcelona,"We could not have asked for a better or safer location. We walked every place! There was always someone at the hotel to give directions or assistance. They made everything run smoothly for us.If we needed something from housekeeping they arrived promptly.Fabulous espresso coffee machine in the room. Beautiful decor and bedding.A complimentary bottle of wine was sent to our room (suggestion, ask them to open..not an easy corkscrew).You can't go wrong staying here!",5,2018,10,29
19,Fabulous Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,Fantastic experience. Excellent service!!Lorena from Concierge was amazing. Nicolas from Reception was awesome!! Breakfast was delicious. Location of the hotel was great. Very safe area. delicious food. ,5,2018,10,28
19,Excellent ,"Perfect location 
Great service 
Well designed 
Very clean 
Good conference equipment 
Great location 
Only two concerns 
1. The elevators are extremely slow 
2. Conference was on level 7th while copy brakes were on level minus 1

We will definitely return for vacation ",4,2018,10,27
19,Great Hotel,The hotel was in a great location. The second floor loft rooms are really nice. The rooftop restaraunt and terrace were very handy for a night cap and the hotel staff were very attentive and helpful. Overall a great hotel that I would not hesitate recommending.,5,2018,10,22
19,Pleasant Stay,"I was hoping to *love* this hotel; I do like it a lot. Very elegant surroundings, beautiful roof top pool, bar and restaurant. Exceptional staff....really warm and welcoming and well trained. But...the walls are paper-thin. For those who like to sleep, that created an issue more than once in our five night stay. People yelling in the hallways at midnight? A few nights in a row? And i could hear my neighbor use their bathroom -every time. 

Don’t get me wrong...this is a really nice place, and our two level suite was very pleasant.it could, however, be so much better.
",4,2018,10,22
19,5* hotel brilliant,"Booked the hotel Claris through Expedia.  What an absolute gem. 5 * rating all the way, beautiful rooftop pool, very helpful staff, beautiful room, fantastic views. 😁😁😁😁😁. Will come back to this hotel and try anouther unique room 😁",5,2018,10,21
19,An extremely comfortable hotel in a busy city,"We spent three nights at the Hotel Claris in Barcelona.  It's location is great - everything that we wanted to see was within walking distance.  The hotel staff was welcoming and spent time explaining where everything was in the hotel.  At first we were a little disappointed in the size of the room - it seemed on the small side.  It, however, had all the amenities that one could ask for and we had a very comfortable stay.",5,2018,10,20
19,Hotel Claris stay,"We stayed at Hotel Claris for 4 nights Oct. 14-19 in a 2 room suite on the 6th floor. Overall we really liked the hotel, its services and personnel. The 2 restaurants & breakfast room are very different in offerings but service and quality are consistent and high.  Unless you are still very flexible, avoid the room with combo shower and tub. Was awkward for us to get in and avoid the fixed glass shower shield.",4,2018,10,20
19,What an amazing welcome to Barcelona ,"We just arrived yesterday to the hotel, our first time here, but not our first in Derby hotels In Europe , they keep high standard and consistent one..

The welcome was just wonderful, the team is highly service oriented and they make sure you are most welcomed.

The hotel is in a great location, and rooms are with sexy design and atmosphere . 

We love it , great for romantic vacation.

",5,2018,10,18
19,"Hotel Claris, I heart you!","Aside from the normal stuff like clean and great location, this place was AMAZING.  The staff was so nice and professional!  From the doorman to the front desk to the cleaning staff.  They have slippers in the room as well as pool slippers, love.  They also have a cell phone in the room you can use for your whole stay! For no charge!  You can call, google, maps, etc... how awesome!  It was my husbands birthday while we were there so they sent a bottle or cava and chocolate dipped strawberries to our room.  We were brought bottles of water daily.  There is a rooftop bar and a pool.  Everything is a 10-15 minute walk away pretty much.  We were on the 5th floor and the noise from the cars was a little louder than I expected so if you are a light sleeper take ear plugs.  I 100% recommend this hotel!",5,2018,10,17
19,Amazing service ,"I arrived at Hotel Claris 18 hours after starting my day so I was somewhat tired. Checking in was not only easy and informative but complemented by a glass of champagne. Simply wonderful way to commence my stay.

I was shown to my room by a porter; I found this unnecessary and embarrassing as I wasn’t carrying euros for this short business trip. I can see how some may enjoy this but not for me.

The room was ok, just not really 5*. Safe, minibar, complimentary water, coffee machine were all as standard and there was a lovely collection of White Company toiletries. Plenty of towels and robes plus of course, slippers.

I found the room quite oppressive and small. There were shutters and blinds covering the window that overlooked a shared terrace. Disappointing too, that many of my colleagues were upgraded to a suite.

On the day of check-in, I was taking a nap before dinner and was disturbed by  constant knocking at the door, ringing of the doorbell and finally ringing of the telephone: the hotel had a complimentary bottle of Rioja for me which although lovely in sentiment should have been brought back when the porter was unable to open my door and didn’t receive an answer from the first knock.

Taxis from outside were easy and all employees around the reception were always very nice and polite when we arrived/left.",4,2018,10,14
19,DO NOT STAY HERE,"Wouldn't stay here again if it was for free or if they paid me to stay there. This 'luxury' hotel is nothing but a farce - some cosmetic lipstick and the appearance of being high-end, with nothing but stale, dark rooms, surfaces that are full of fingerprints, old pillows and rugs in the rooms which are full of dust - the whole experience was awful. I felt like I didn't want to really touch anything in the room, the bathroom was terribly outdated, like the rest of the hotel. Room also incredibly noisy - both from guests above and outside noise. Metal art piece hung above bed looks like its 100 years old and collecting dust from the last 5,000 guests. The 'gym' is a storage room with a few older than dirt machines thrown in - no towels, forget about water. I turned the treadmill up to a running speed and it started to shake and the belt was uneven. Tried twice and gave up. This isn't a hotel that is proactive about these things or really cares - because the entrance looks high-end enough and once they have you in it doesn't matter.",2,2018,10,10
19,Excellent location. Room functionality could be improved.,"We liked many things about this hotel. 
Location is excellent.  
We could walk just about everywhere from this location. 

Staff is very friendly and helpful. 
We were greeted with glass of Cava. Very nice. 
We were upgraded to a junior suite which was spacious enough and had a very pleasing decor. 

The room includes slippers and bottled water daily which I appreciate. 
There are black out shades and sound proof windows which made sleep very restful. 

My only issue was room functionality.  It may just be our room as other rooms may be different.  
Our bathroom had no counter space we had to keep our toiletries on the desk. 
Bathroom lighting was poor and made it hard to get ready.  There was a makeup mirror which I like in a room but it was situated high and over a tall faucet so I was unable to use it. Bathroom functionality is very important when away from home. 
Desk was unusable because it didn’t have the correct chair. 

I would stay here again but request a more functional room.",4,2018,10,09
19,Wonderful Stay At Hotel Claris,We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Claris.  Very conveniently located near Casa Batllo and excellent stores and restaurants.  The staff were very attentive and helpful and the hotel lobby smelled like fresh bouquets of flowers all the time.  Most welcoming.  The breakfast was delicious with lots of choices.  We would definitely stay here again if ever in Barcelona!,5,2018,10,09
19,Wonderful hotel in an excellent position,"This hotel is wonderful. Situated in the heart of the city near the Gaudi house, it is in a perfect position to enjoy this beautiful city. The hotel is perfect, the staff are welcoming and the rooms are amazing. Try out the rooftop bar and restaurant. ",5,2018,10,06
19,Best Hotel,I cant recommend this Hotel enough  the location is central . The staff are caring and courteous .Value for money for 5 star . Excellent rooms very spacious and modern . Great roof top swimming pool ! Amazing Hotel . Look forward to going back ! ,5,2018,10,03
19,While in Spain,"The service was excellent. There was always someone there to help us.The room was spacious, clean. Not a spec of dirt in the room.The location was easy to find, and always someone eager to help us to take around Barcelona.What I like to most is watching the stars on top roof with my friends with a glass of wine.",5,2018,10,03
19,GEM!,Wonderful stay.  great staff. The location cannot be beat.  We ordered Chinese from Room service every night because it was so good.Only problem was that television in salon did not work but we hardly missed it,5,2018,10,03
19,One night stay,"Fab night spent in Barcelona at the Claris and an amazing meal on the roof terrace. Comfortable room with some exceptional artwork, and staff were amazing. An early departure meant a missed breakfast but the staff prepared a bag of food items to take to the airport.",5,2018,10,02
19,Beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood!,Walking distance to two Gaudi apt. buildings &  La Sagrada Familia.  We cabbed to Park Guell but walked back to hotel down the hill--   Hotel staff was great-- request a room at the back side of the hotel as Barcelona is a busy nighttime city--  Some great restaurants walking distance--  Would definitely return!,5,2018,10,02
19,Elegant hotel in the city,Lovely room with amazing facilities. Enjoyed the scattered art pieces around the room. Close to Passeig de Gracia where the shops and metro station were. Staff were also helpful to recommend places to eat.,4,2018,10,01
19,inattention to fire alarm in the middle of the night,"The room cleaner cleaned the next door room in the late afternoon very loud so that we  couldn't take a nap.Then in the middle of the night there were 3 fire alarm, yet there were no representative of the hotel staff who knew what was going on, who could tell the guests what to do.The guest have to decide for themselves what to do.Terrible.",1,2018,09,26
19,It was amazing,"We were the First time in Spain and everything worked as planned. Hotel was amazing, perfect location, great friendly staff, well decorated and clean room,and easy valet parking. We will stay there again. ",5,2018,09,25
19,Best hotel experience in Europe,"I stayed at Claris during my business trip. Staffs are really kind and helping. Breakfast was nice. I also loved little exhibition there even the small statue in my own room. The slippers were heavenly and shades on the window were perfect - I could not sleep better.

The only downfall is their elevator- It is bit old and clunky.

But overall I really enjoyed staying here and maybe next time if I visit Barcelona again, I would love to stay here.",5,2018,09,25
19,Loved the hotel.,Ambuance was fantastic. Location was fabulous. Was able to walk almost everywhere. Breakfast service and food was outstanding. Top floor restaurant food was not the best. Maybe a new chef. Wait staff gr8!,4,2018,09,25
19,Go there!,"Very nice place, checked out some 5 star hotels in Barcelona, liked Hotel Claris best.
Nice terrace, beautiful illumination of the hotel during night time. Very strong price-perfomance ratio, i highly recommand it!",5,2018,09,24
19,Sophisticated and great location,Loved our 3 nights here. Perfect location close to Gaudi houses and Metro station. Art collection in lobby and rooms is really distinctive. Our room had a loft with upper lounge perfect for relaxing after walking all day. Rooftop bar and pool was great for cocktails. Would recommend to our friends visiting Barcelona. ,5,2018,09,24
19,The hidden Gem in Barcelona,"This 5 star Hotel will not dissapoint. We arrived for a 4 night stay in Sept 2018 and from the moment we were greated by the doorman , till the time we said goodbye - I could find no fault - really !!
The staff are welcoming, friendly, and go way beyond what would be classed as necessary to ensure you feel pampered. The room we stayed in was luxurious, well planned out and really had everything to hand. The special touches , such as preparing your room for the evening - putting the black out blinds down, leaving chocolates on your pillow and turning on you night light , shows this hotel  makes every effort to make you feel special.
The roof terrace pool is a treat , where you can relax in your robe and slippers , whilst the bar staff are close at hand to offer drinks and nibbles  - and the spa facilities are first class .
As we pre planned our trip to maximise the potential of what all Barcelona had to offer, we did not eat at the hotel, so cannot review this facility ,however , we did drop into the burger bar next door for a quick meal which was fantastic - it looks like a little cafe, but it owned by a great chef , who makes the most delicious food with top quality aged beef - this is not your regular burger bar - the cocktails are also worth a try !",5,2018,09,21
19,Superb hotel,"Loved our stay here. Can highly recommended a stay here. Perhaps the threw top reasons are 1) location - beautiful sophisticated address 2) recommendations for places to eat and drink from the hotel reception, concierge and doorman. Everywhere we ate was excellent as a result and took all the effort of researching good places to eat away 3) the spacious rooms and complimentary gifts. Will definitely go back. Michelle",5,2018,09,17
19,A good stay,"The hotel is far enough away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough that getting anywhere is easy. Hotel service is very good. Notably the breakfast staff. Alvin stood out, he provided the detailed and attentive service that I expect in a 5-Star hotel.My room was clean, but the bed was squeaky and the shower leaked water all over the floor. Overall a good stay.",4,2018,09,17
19,"Great stay, great service!",This was a great hotel in a perfect part of town - in between the old city and new city. The hotel staff gave us perfect recommendations on what to do around town and wonderful places to eat. The rooftop pool is a great amenity was wonderful food and drinks. ,5,2018,09,17
19,A genuine 5star hotel on all counts,"This was one of the best hotels we have stayed at with everything looked after extremely well. The front desk was very friendly and in fact we got our room hours early ,the room was very comfortable ,the top floor pool and dining was excellent ,the latter for a special birthday and the staff generally very friendly and helpful. But the best person was the maitre de in the breakfast room who was always  very courteous effective and very efficient. The food range was great and the fruits selection superb. 
One to strongly recommend. Ron",5,2018,09,15
19,A beautiful hotel!,"We stayed at the Hotel Claris in Barcelona before our cruise. The room was small but beautifully appointed. The bathroom was marble with an oversized tub perfect for soaking after a long flight. The included breakfast was as elegant as can be, including cava, an assortment of juices, a variety of regional meat and cheese sections, fresh vegetables, fruits, pastries and more. Hot egg dishes were also available. The maitre de was especially delightful, suggesting dishes and insisting we try combinations he thought we would like. In addition, Doorman was very helpful. He saw us walking past the hotel and asked us if we were walking further? We realized we almost missed the hotel, were it not for his pointing us out. He also gave us good directions to La Sagrada Familia and corrected the way we were going to go. It was a wonderful stay! ",5,2018,09,15
19,Appreciate great service here....,"Interesting; unique, great service, convenient, nice but surprisingly kind & welcoming....I was amused when I heard I would be sleeping in s room with a Mayan work of art but it was so interesting.  The museum in the hotel of Mayan art is petite & the works are beautifully displayed.",5,2018,09,11
19,VERY FRIENDLY/HELPFUL STAFF,"excellent location if you like high end shopping, all big names round the corner, due to this it attracts a more mature clientele and but close to amazing restaurants and amenities making a stay here very enjoyable.",5,2018,09,07
19,"Clarissa Hotel, Barcelona","Beautiful room, great food and the staff and service were exceptional. Excellent location and  wonderful rooftop pool area. The gym and sauna were an added  bonus. We really enjoyed  breakfast in the Hotel each morning too.",5,2018,09,05
19,Nice room/good wifi!,"We used the hotel for a day room after a cruise awaiting a flight out of Barcelona.  Staff were very helpful and the rooms had complimentary nespresso coffee, water and wifi.  Comfortable bed and even a mobile phone device to take out with you that shows shops, restaurants etc.  Good central spot.",4,2018,09,04
19,Excellent,"Very well located, close to Passeig de Gracia. Its a grand old Palace conerted to a Hotel. The Building dated back to 19th Century. Impressive for sure. I stayed in the Junior Suite. Its spacious with Egyptian and Pre-Columbian artifacts. Loved the food at the La Terraza Mediterranean restaurant. Will surely return to this lovely property.",5,2018,09,04
19,Friendly with delicious food.,"Spent 2 nights at The Claris. From the moment of stepping into the hotel everyone is friendly and polite. English is spoken by virtually all the staff and a warmth generates them when interacting. Art is a theme with this hotel which extends to the room we were allocated. For us the room was too unusual but art can be such a personal thing. As we were only staying 2 nights we didn’t need to fully unpack which was just as well as the wardrobe space was very limited. We booked dinner on the roof terrace and what a wonderful dining experience it was. The passion for food from our hosts was reflected in the tastes, even some of our boundaries were pushed, much to our surprise and delight. Attention to detail came at breakfast when I needed to blow my nose, almost out of nowhere the Maitre D placed a box of tissues on my table. Such a small gesture can leave a big impression. Well done to Hotel Claris, you deserve your success.",4,2018,09,03
19,Lovely hotel,"Hotel great and service, only slight fault ( the same it appears for other high end hotels in Barcelona) you have to pay for the extra coffee capsules in your room- should be free, they’re cheap enough, otherwise a great stay 
(",5,2018,09,03
19,Beautiful hotel,Location is good. Breakfast was delicious.Swimming pool is a little bit smaller but it's okay. Very beautiful room. Good for couples without kids.Everyone was very polite. You feel those five stars GL.Everything was great.,5,2018,08,28
19,"Not good, a five-star hotel unworthy !","I have stayed in Hotel Claris 5 times in the past 18 years, a number of times for several consecutive days. Now we stayed with the family for 1 day in mid-August. However, it was not good, a five-star hotel unworthy.
It all started at check-in. We arrived around 2 pm and were told by the reception that the room was not yet available, it would take half an hour. No problem in itself, we wanted to have lunch on the roof terrace. After lunch (around 15.30) the reception indicated that the room was still not finished and that a quarter of an hour was needed. That was already annoying, but we waited once again. When we wanted to check in again more than a quarter of an hour later, the room was still not ready. I have indicated that I find this unprofessional and that this really can't be true it was now 4 pm in the afternoon! Another 10 minutes later the room was finally ready and we could go to our room. The way the people behind the reception solved this was cold and not very understanding. Not a good entrance therefore.

The room was spacious and good.

The rest of the afternoon we spent at the pool on the roof. In itself pleasant and comfortable. But the prices for drinks are really excessively expensive. A simple café cortado costs EUR 6,-. Why? That really doesn't make sense, and even a beer or a cola is extremely expensive.

We went to sleep around 11 pm. We noticed that the air conditioning worked very moderately and that it was far too warm in the room. Whatever we tried, the temperature didn't get any better and only a tiny amount of fresh air came out of the ventilation grids. Around 1 o'clock in the night woke up with an incredible amount of noise from the room next to us. It kept on going and it was a combination of screaming and music and infinite flushing of the WC. At half past three in the night I walked down to the reception to make my complaint, whereupon the security went to solve the problem. 

When waking up in the morning we wanted to use the Nespresso device available in the room. But despite the long time it took the day before to get the room in order, they forgot to add to the coffee: not a single cup was available; this is really bad, top class of a good hotel is precisely in these kinds of things that need to be right. Once again, we faced a disappointment. 

Was there nothing good at all? Yes, the lunch on the roof terrace was delicious with also extremely friendly and competent staff in the service. And the doorman who has been working there since 1992 is a fantastic man.

The next time in Barcelona is unlikley to be in Claris again, it was just not good, and a five star hotel unworthy.",2,2018,08,23
19,Good location,The hotel is nice with very comfy location. But women from reception were very unpleasant and rude. I loved the Terrasse zone. Sun beds were so comfortable and the atmosphere was also very pleasant!!!,4,2018,08,23
19,5 STAR PERFECTION FOR OUR FAMILY CELEBRATION !!!!!,We have just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Claris.I travelled with my family.My husband e-mailed the hotel to let them know it was a special family celebration.We arrived at the hotel we were offered a glass of champagne Check-in  was smooth and efficient then the  receptionist  told us we had all been upgraded to Duplex suites!!The rooms had two levels with bedroom on the ground floor and sitting area above.They were absolutely stunning!!!There was also a bottle of champagne in each room which was another lovely surprise.We started the day with a delicious breakfast which was a combination of buffet and cooked breakfast .After a busy day sight seeing we returned to the hotel were we would go to the roof terrace and relax by the pool which we really enjoyed.Many thanks to our waiter Mark who looked after us so well. I would not to hesitate to recommend this beautiful boutique hotel which is in a great location.There are some really good restaurants close by.Many thanks to all the staff who were so kind and helpful.They all helped to make our family celebration in Barcelona truly special and we returned home with many happy memories.5 stars all the way!!

19,10 days of fun!,"The whole staff was excellent! We would stay here again for sure! Roberta at the front desk, the doorman, Borga, Daniel on the rooftop bar/restaurant, the 2 ladies in the spa, the room service manager, Jimmy, Pilar and The Asian Gentleman in the breakfast area all went above and beyond to make our every request happen!",5,2018,08,20
19,Nice location and beautiful boutique hotel ,"I wanted to visit Barcelona for my birthday. 
We stayed here in Feb 2018. 

We spend 4 nights at the hotel. 

The rooms were nice and big. They had two separate rooms instead of one joined family room. Which got my son super excited as he got his own room and TV. 

We took breakfast only option. Rest of the times we were eating out. Couple of times we ordered room service and food was tasty. 

There bathroom was really nice. The bathtub has jacussi function. 

The hotel itself has nothing special for kids. 
The restaurants within hotel do not offer much for vegetarians. 

The hotel’s roof top bar and pool is nice. But pool itself was too small and it was not heated. 

It is a nice, small and cozy hotel. 

Hotel staff were friendly. Reception staff were really helpful and suggested some really good places to us to eat. 

However for next time I would like to stay in another hotel in Barcelona.

19,Great location & 5* service,"Located in the heart of Barcelona and steps from luxury shopping and fabulous food. The team was extremely helpful with amazing recommendations of restaurants, sights and personalized shopping. The spa was magical and perfect solution to our jet lag. Highly recommended!",5,2018,08,17
19,"Staff excellent, hotel lovely, guests allowed to blare music at midnight","We stayed as a family of five over a weekend in August. Everyone in the hotel was nice, the hotel was clean, beds comfortable, swimming pool small but relaxing. Staff super helpful for advising re things to do in barcelona and where to eat. 

However there was no regulation re noise in the hotel. At midnight we asked if the blasting music with doors open could stop, but nothing much done. Music started again at 4 am... when the clubbers returned. Not the hotels fault at all, but they did nothing to address it for the following evenings...",4,2018,08,14
19,Bring your ear muffs!,"If I owned this hotel I would feel fortunate for the beautiful building my hotel occupied. I would feel even more fortunate for the incredible team that I had assembled. The staff here are some of the nicest and most friendly people we came across during our travelling. Just fantastic. I tipped the maitre'd at breakfast on our last morning and he looked at me as if I was from outer space. It was not expected at all.

The reason why I would never stay at this hotel again is that part of what I pay for is a good nights rest, and you will hear everything at this hotel. The walls seem paper thin. You'll hear regular conversations, doors opening and closing, furniture being moved around....you name it. The housekeeping staff were cleaning outside of our room between 10:30-11:00 pm one evening. It is a beautiful hotel with maybe the best staff in Barcelona, but it is not a quiet hotel. If you don't mind sounds/noise, you'll love it.",2,2018,08,12
19,"Outstanding customer service, location and facilities.","Was extremely impressed with the customer service from all staff in the hotel, the location could not of been better - everything within walking distance. Didn’t try the restaurants as ate out every night but looked nice and reasonably priced. Would 100% reccomend.",5,2018,08,12
19,Great Choice!,"Unbearably hot in Barcelona during our stay.  Experience was saved by having our home base at the Hotel Claris.  Location enabled us to easily walk to sites and restaurants.  Train to airport was a block away.  We rented a car to drive to Girona and it was delivered and picked up at the location and had a relatively low fee. Thanks to Juan the concierge who helped us with rental, tickets and our many questions. He, like all the staff, was generous and delightful.  Our room was one of the suites that have a second story sitting area. We were  glad we'd opted for that as it gave us lots of room during our three-day stay Wonderful art and the high ceilings made room seem luxurious and like an apartment  We used the separate sitting area to watch a movie and eat some take-in after a long day.  Bathroom had soaking tub with shower, large sink and vanity as well as toilet.  Good size room and spa-like with bath salts and lovely smelling soaps and lotions. Very clean as well. Definitely recommend and would consider staying there again if we ever have the chance to return to Barcelona.",5,2018,08,11
19,Great hotel with top notch staff,"I have visited the Claris with my wife for the first time this year and is always great to be positively surprised by a new hotel: the staff was by far one of the best I have ever dealt with around the world, expecially the concierge and the front desk, always smiling and ready to help you in any possible way. They made our stay perfect with great suggestions and advice. Breakfast is a must try as well as their rooftop terrace bar! Can't wait to go back next year.",5,2018,08,07
19,Nice place but would not go back to it,"We stayed in room 519 .. the furnishing were very stylish .. lots black .. there was one window facing inside the hotel, so you can see other people .. so we just left the iron shade closed.  The amenities were very nice, but my biggest issue with our room was the hard bed and the rain drop shower. It would take me 10 minutes just to get wet as the water pressure was very low .. please put another shower head in there so you can choose between the 2 heads.  the daily breakfast was very nice and the hotel staff was very nice",3,2018,08,06
19,"Wonderful place, but with a wrong note","The Claris is a favorite place for me living here in Barcelona; a comforting place for drinks and just relaxing. The Hotel Claris has much to offer, but I must seriously question one of their guest reception policies.
They have two Black doormen that have worked there for a very long time - Pancho and Euserio(?) - and are often the first contact arriving guests have of the hotel.  They project good humor, ready smiles, and fine nature that set the tone for a great experience at the hotel. I have to say my distaste for the costumes they are forced to wear is inconsistent with the quality image of the hotel and the exemplary service of both men.. This week however increased my concern even more.The heat and humidity in Barcelona have been intolerable and unseasonable, yet the management still forces the men to wear long coats and hats best suited for the Fall or Winter, while the other staff has Summer uniforms. There are better ways to convey a luxury image of a property without causing your employees discomfort. I would hope that the Hotel Claris can change this policy.",4,2018,08,04
19,Excellent hotel,"Centrally located, with a mostly helpful staff, and a nice boutique vibe! Checkin was a bit inefficiently done but from there on everything was great. The rooms are beautifully appointed and not overdone. The bathrooms are large, clean, and with all modern amenities. The housing staff is efficient and professional. The concierge desk is top notch and was quite helpful in creating tour plans for us. The basement restaurant had great breakfast and was at par with any fine dining restaurant, with great management staff that looked after every need and went out of their way to make our children satisfied. 
Centrally located within walking distance to Las Ramblas, and many restaurants. 
Very much recommended.",5,2018,08,04
19,Very noisy and staff was rude & dismissive,"We booked our room 3 months in advance, the room should have been ready at 3pm when we arrived. It was not. The staff was very rude and dismissive, they told us to wait on the couch and did not give us an estimated time when the room would be ready. 30 minutes roll by ... the room still isn't ready. Another 30 minutes roll by ... still not ready. Now we are getting angry. After threatening to leave they finally tell us a cleaner is going UP to clean it now. Wow what were they doing for the last 60 minutes?

The room was full of ""art"" all over the surfaces. There wasn't any room to actually use the tables, pretty poorly thought out.

The room was also VERY NOISY. The glass window was NOT SOUND PROOF. The noise was like sleeping on the road!

After two nights of getting now sleep we checked out early and stayed somewhere else. Guess what? They still charged us for 7 nights! This hotel was a disaster.",1,2018,08,01
19,Excellent stay,"Staff was very helpful in every way,  Food in restaurant was good, breakfast outstanding.  Help to get baggage onto  bus for delivery to cruise ship was wonderful, totally handled.  Could not have been more pleased with the hotel,",5,2018,08,01
19,Amazing stay,"If you are looking for a luxury and affordable stay in Barcelona this is the perfect hotel.
Claris hotel is one of the best hotels I stayed in.
The customer service from the doorman until the house keeping helpers are excellent. The restaurant they have in the rooftops is delicious and elegant. The hotel is really close to one of the main Avenues.
You can walk to some main attractions. The front desk attendants directed me as of where to buy a cell phone chip for just 10 Euros. Very impressed with the cleanliness and location. Strongly recommended",5,2018,08,01
19,Good,Nice vibes and good mojito with fruits . Not alot of people 15 euros for all cocktails. Good waitress. The food or the snacks was delicious aswell . This is a place you should visit just for the rooftops,4,2018,07,29
19,Roof top !,"This review is for the roof top bar, pool, and seating area only. 

Good size roof area with pool area and sun beds, lounging area with sofas, drinks tables and restaurant. Loved the mature planting. Staff were very pleasant and attentive ! Drinks and food are reasonably priced (at hotel prices) - it’s a very pleasant area to spend some down time. Whist this area is on the roof, unfortunately there is no real view of anything - just the surrounding roof tops and buildings. ",4,2018,07,22
19,Poor service,"We were left without a bed for our son (11) until midnight on our first night after being told at checkin that it would be set up in the evening. We were out for dinner and had to request it when we returned. It was exceptionally uncomfortable and was not made or packed away each day for 4 days. Taking up the whole of the living space in our “Junior Suite”, breakfast was good and the head waiter lovely, since we left we have emailed and called about a pair of shoes that were definitely left in the room and we have had no response. Food service was also super slow on the terrace, Would not recommend, especially for the price. ",2,2018,07,17
19,A Gem in the city,"I had expected the Claris to be a fine city hotel but I was delighted to find such an exceptional property. The staff is so warm, professional and helpful in every way. Every one who worked in the reception area, the concierge could not have been more gracious
Housekeeping did a phenomenal job keeping the rooms in impeccable condition.
The food at breakfast was delicious and served in a beautiful room. 
The hotel is,exquisite in all its artistic details.
The location is also,excellent and very close to the metro, a few of Gaudi's masterpieces and elegant shopping.
Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful stay. Congratulations,to the General Manager.
I was fortunate to stay in room 306 which was so beautiful and spacious.",5,2018,07,15
19,1 STAR Customer Service....5 STAR Hotel,"We were very excited to return to Barcelona and to revisit  The Claris...which  we consider to be a 5 star hotel.  
We stayed The Claris  several years ago and had loved our previous experience.
However, we soon learned that the true test of a hotel's rating is when one encounters a problem and  finds that the management is inflexible and more importantly unwilling to remedy a small problem.
It has always been my belief  that the number one priority of any hotel should be customer satisfaction,  especially in so small a matter as this.
We never thought that The Claris....a hotel chain of this caliber would make such a minor problem so large.
It was more important for The Claris management  to stick to their no refund policy and be inflexible in our matter....rather than to support  a customer....especially a returning one.
The story : 
Last April I made a 2 night reservation for our stay in June....thru Hotels.com.
The day before our vacation began.....I reviewed my travel plan paperwork....and to my surprise....found that I had no confirmation  about the reservation that I thought I had made.
Not remembering that the first attempted reservation was made thru Hotels.com...
I then called Expedia who told me that the  system showed that we had no reservation at all.....thru anyone....Fortunately I was able to get a booking  just in time before flying out the next day.
Upon arriving at The Claris....we were told we did have 2 rooms booked for the same dates.
 We were also told that according to their policy....there was nothing they could do to reimburse us...as they have a no refund policy.
They did suggest that WE speak to  Hotels.com... as that was the first place used to make the initial reservation.
They called Hotels.com....handed US the phone....and after  explaining the story...we were told that Hotels.com understood the problem....and they were agreeable to credit my account....$693.35 which had been billed on 4/26/18.
We were told by both Hotels.com AND the Claris Hotel that there was a glitch in the system which sometimes happens....and was told by a VERY helpful desk clerk (Roberta)....that management would have to make the final decision but that it almost certainly would be rectified....as it was a ""no fault error"" .....it will be worked out.
Hotels.com agreed....and was willing to recredit us.
The desk staff was extremely helpful and sympathetic and very understanding.
They were almost certain that there would be no problem.....especially since Hotels.com agreed with us.
The Claris management however disagreed.
I even went so far as being willing to share in 1/3 of the expense.
There was no reason for us to pay double....almost $ 1,400 for our 2 night stay.
We were on the phone for far too long on this matter while we should have been enjoying the start of our vacation.
We feel that the hotel itself should have been behind us and easily dealt with Hotels.com.....
A hotel of such distinction and class should have been far more supportive than they were.
I always thought that customer satisfaction was important....especially when the problem was not out fault.
The hotel treated this problem as a cancellation....which it wasn't....and made us pay for 2 rooms.
Our stressful situation should have been treated with ease.....but The Claris cared more about policy....than a returning customer.
The decision maker would not even speak with us.
How sad and disappointing to have spent spent our anniversary celebration  in this way.
We will not be returning to The Claris again.",1,2018,07,15
19,our review,good accommodation and the service was good and the facilities good  but the room lacked sufficient space to work at  and there was no arrangement that suited meals in room. It was conveniently located to the areas we wanted to access.,5,2018,07,14
19,Barcelona Into,We were fortunate to stay at this establishment during the first stage of our Honeymoon.  The staff were all very hospitable and welcoming. The rooms were very nice and comfortable and the continental breakfasts were more than expected. We were very pleased.,4,2018,07,04
19,Darker than a dungeon,This 5 star hotel has to be the darkest we have ever stayed in. Our room on the 1st floor seemed to have no natural light. Even with the blinds open we had no idea of the time of day.  Breakfast matre D wandered around talking into a microphone and then placing unwanted orders on wrong tables and generally being ineffective.  The egg station cook's idea of an omellette was to chop it up as though it was scrambled egg.  Burnt and inedible..  5 star it aint!,2,2018,07,03
19,A Great Say!!!,"We recently stayed at the Claris for 3 days after completing a 10 day Med cruise. The hotel is centrally located for all activities.  It was a great stay. 

Upon arrival Oscar (Bellman Staff Member) assisted us with our luggage and provided great suggestions for places close to eat and directions to local attractions.  He was extremely helpful and welcoming. 

Kati (Reception Staff Member) helped us check in and likewise did a great job. She was able to get us into our rooms early as they were ready. Very welcoming and professional. 

 A great place to stay.",5,2018,07,01
19,Barcelona Trip,"If you are looking for a 5 Star hotel at a good price this Hotel should be considered, We stayed here 2 times. The rooms and the staff were great! The location is excellent also. Centrally located but not in the middle of a congested area. Very close to all of the high end shopping and less than a 30min walk or short cab ride to everything else. ",5,2018,06,29
19,Beautiful Artistic Design Affordable Luxury in a Great Location ,"A truly Great 5 star luxury hotel at a very affordable price!  We changed to Hotel Claris after one night at a nearby hotel that claims to be 4 star and isn’t - at a similar price for a much larger beautifully designed room in a unique boutique hotel!
From the moment you enter the large lobby and are welcomed by the friendly and helpful front desk staff - along with a glass of good champagne which was much appreciated - We knew we were in the right place and So Happy we made the change! 

It’s a reminder to never accept a bad hotel situation as it affects your entire stay - in this case our vacation! We had a large junior corner suite on the top floor on the quiet side street with a good view. The artistic luxury design is very unique for a hotel room and very comfortable. It is very well appointed with a comfortable bed and large sofa, ample lighting and a large bathroom with unique fixtures. Also appreciated the motorized blackout window drape. 
We appreciated our bellman (think Phillip) who in only a few minutes provided a very friendly and helpful welcome with very good recommendations in the city. 
The front desk people also gave us great restaurant recommendations-especially 2254! The concierge was very helpful and made reservations for us at several attractions. 
There is a good sized pool on the roof along with a bar and restaurant. We enjoyed drinks and a very good dinner with excellent service. 
A couple recommendations: a night light is needed for safety - which we requested and received immediately. 
English speaking tv channels are only news - need entertainment options. 
Additional gym equipment or a local gym visit option. 
Overall Hotel Claris is one of the best hotels in Barcelona in a great location and we will definitely stay there again!
",5,2018,06,26
19,"Great Hotel, Fabulous Service",This hotel is excellent.  Be sure to get at least a Junior Suite and request the window face the back and not to the street. The breakfast is wonderful but be sure to get a package with the breakfast included as the cost is 40 Euro per person. Be aware that Thursday - Saturday they have music on the roof terrace.  You do not want a window facing the internal court or the street.  Again go for one that faces the back if you are sensitive to noise.  The jr suite is large enough so you can feel comfortable.,5,2018,06,24
19,Nice hotel with a good location and friendly service.,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Claris. Our room was comfortable with a separate lounge area, and the location near the Passeig de Gracia was convenient for sightseeing. It’s within easy walking distance of Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, and Casa Battlo and walkable to Palau de la Musica, the Cathedral, and El Born (~20 minutes). The decor was lovely, and the pre-Colombian theme added an interesting touch. The service was very friendly, and the front desk was helpful with museum tickets, transportation, and overall guidance. The rooftop is nice with a bar, restaurant, and small pool, and the food and drinks were good. We’d stay here again on a return trip to Barcelona.",5,2018,06,21
19,Outstanding experience,"Amazing hotel in the very center of Barcelona! I had the chance to stay with my wife a couple of weeks ago and we can't wait to go back.
The Claris is a small property full of charm and personality. Absolutely amazing breakfast, the quality of service is top notch (Alexio has welcomed us at the front desk and has been a great ambassador during the whole stay) and the rooftop terrace though is small offers unique cocktails and a wonderful place to disconnect from city's hustle. Rooms are in line with the hotel tone, indeed glamorous and styilish!
We'll be back, hopefully quite soon!",5,2018,06,20
19,Position ,"Great position . Walking distance to everything .
We were upgraded when we arrived to what only can be described as the most unusual room I have ever seen .
Two stories with sauna on one level and bed on another . Full of antiquities the room was almost like a museum .
Loved the breakfast here and nothing was too much trouble .
Roof top bar had great cocktails .
A great hotel ",4,2018,06,19
19,Good place!,"Friendly and comfortable hotel, clean rooms, good stuff. A lot of restaurants nearby! I will stay here with enjoy. The  location is the best to the all sightseeing and to the beach and malls. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends!",5,2018,06,18
19,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","Beautiful small hotel in a great area of Barcelona.  Surrounded by restaurants and cafes, and walking distance to most sites in the downtown area (beach - 30 min, Park Guell - 30 min, Gracia and Rambla shopping - 10 min).  Service was excellent and rooms were spacious and comfortable.  Breakfast is extensive and of high quality, but a little on the pricey side (although Barcelona in general is not cheap).  Great place, I'd return for sure.",5,2018,06,17
19,Stunning Hotel in a Quiet Neighborhood Near Top Attractions!,"From the moment we arrived till the moment we left we felt at ease here. The room was always clean and kept orderly, even if we stepped out for a half hour. The staff were friendly and we were able to get to all the top attractions with a swift walk or a brief cab ride. 

The rooftop terrace is terrific and a great spot to grab a drink before heading out or to relax and have a swim after a long day of touring. 

Would highly recommend this hotel if your looking to see the sights and come home to a quiet more sophsticated atmosphere. The price was also very agreeable for what you get.",5,2018,06,13
19,Amazing in all ways!,"Hotel Claris exceeded our expectations on every level. The ambiance, the service, the exceptional breakfast and the unique dining in Mr. Kao. We also loved the hotel’s central location and the entire Eixample area. Special kudos to Karen and the concierge staff for their help and guidance. We will spread the word!",5,2018,06,13
19,excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel 10 out of 10 totally enjoyed my stay the staff where amazing very helpful. The hotel facilities are very good, pool, spa and food I will defiantly stay again and would recommend this hotel to my friends and Business colleagues. ",5,2018,06,13
19,The ideal boutique hotel,"My stay in Claris was wonderful. I stayed for 2 days only but will certainly go back. The hotel itself is rich on artistic features -in accordance to Barcelona's vibrant culture- and it is tastefully luxurious. The terrace is beautifully designed to take advantage of the views, and there is a lovely swimming pool. The best of this hotel? Without doubt, Claris' team; all members of staff I met were professional, helpful and friendly. Great hotel, thank you to everyone at Claris.",5,2018,06,12
19,Hotel Claris Stay,"Beautiful Hotel.  Very friendly staff, Rooms were well decorated and very comfortable.  The service was outstanding.  definitely would stay there again.  Centrally located, one block from City Center. The bar location on the roof had some great views.  Service was outstanding and very friendly",5,2018,06,11
19,Disappointing stay,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights and were disappointed with the hotel.

Service by the staff was great but sadly, we felt the hotel was overrated and overpriced

Rooms were small for its price point compared to other hotels around the area. You’ll only be provided with two bottles of water throughout your entire stay (though tap water in Barcelona is perfectly drinkable) 

Gym is non existent, with close-to-broken facilities and ventilation. 

All in all, we would say the hotel is a borderline four star hotel (border of three and four, not four and five) 

Plenty of other better hotels nearby ",2,2018,06,08
19,Beware of hidden charges,It wasn’t clear that there would be a charge taken at booking which is refunded seperately after departure ..Local tax added was significant .Executive room was pleasant with good bed .No window with natural light but quiet.,4,2018,06,07
19,A small luxury!,"A beautiful little hotel, very central, full of smiling, helpful people.  Our room was great, more than enough space for two.  The location is brilliant: central enough to be easy walking distance from all the sights we wanted to see, but not in the middle of the maddening crowd.",5,2018,06,04
19,The Hotel design is EPIC,"I loved this hotel, i come here for a work day and it was superb, i loved the ambient lightening it had many amenities and the staff were extremely helpful to everyone and if we needed anything it was done immediately. Loved it!",5,2018,06,04
19,Best hotel ever,This is arguably the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  The rooms are fantastic.  Excellent location for vacation or business.  Close to shopping and Barcelona attractions.  Impeccable service.  Great breakfast.  What more could you want?,5,2018,05,30
19,True 5 star hotel,"From the doormen to reception and dining, Hotel Claris will not disappoint. Art laden rooms with evening service of the luxurious bedding is complete with dark chocolate. The bathroom is cpmplete with bidet, toiletries, oversized towels and a rose. The breakfast buffet offers Spanish and continental choices and has a cooked to order menu as well. The rooftop bar offers awesome views. Thirty to 45 minutes walk to the usual sites. Lots of bars and restaurants within 10 minutes walk. Highly recommended.",5,2018,05,28
19,Wonderful hotel!,"The Hotel Claris was simply lovely.  The staff was attentive and very, VERY helpful.  They gave us restaurant recommendations, grabbed taxis and even let us ride in the hotel van to the airport when we left.  The rooftop pool and restaurant are the perfect way to spend the afternoon.  I HIGHLY recommend this hotel if you are traveling to Barcelona",5,2018,05,27
19,Still Good.,"This is still a great place to stay: central, stylish, comfortable and with great staff.
Last stayed in December, when it was quiet. This time the hotel was full and so staff a bit more stretched and perhaps a less personal feel ? A minor gripe. 
Rooftop pool and terrace was great and had a very good feel. Enough people to make it feel buzzy, but there was always somewhere to sit. Cocktails are seriously good.
Rooftop restaurant was closed for some refurbishment, which was the only real disappointment, as the food was very good in December. Lose a point !
If we return to Barcelona, we will stay here again: which says it all, really.",4,2018,05,26
19,Exceptional 5* hotel,"We were treated like royalty. The hotel and our room (superior) was delightful with high end furnishings. The bed was really comfortable as was the bed linen. The staff are exceptionally helpful, competent and very friendly. I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. The location is central. If I had to identify a downside the pool area is very small but, in saying this it is a city hotel and most central hotels don’t have this facility so it could be looked at as an extra benefit. My advice - book it, I doubt you’ll be disappointed.",5,2018,05,25
19,OUTSTANDING HOTEL IN BARCELONA,"The Claris Hotel is outstanding... the service is excellent, the furnishings are beautiful, and it is centrally located to everything (2 blocks from Casa Mila, 9 blocks to Sagrada Familia, and a short walk to La Rambla.  The hotel staff goes out of their way to accommodate anything that you need.  Also, the roof top bar is beautiful!  I highly recommend this hotel when staying in Barcelona!",5,2018,05,22
19,Good location,"We stayed in this hotel for four nights. The Claris is centrally situated for easy access to the city's main tourist interests and we really enjoyed our Barcelona stay. The hotel had a few niggles for us if it wants to call itself five star and I must add these are personal to our experience.
Firstly the room didn't feel comfortable, which became very apparent when we wanted to read in bed. No bedside lamps. The only lights were in the ceiling so you had to lean forward to get the light onto your reading page, not good. Secondly the bedside table was tiny and taken up entirely with a telephone so no place for your book, glasses, phone or bedside water. Next, the coffee machine was very good but the plug socket was buried under the work top and the lead as tight as a bow string. We had to very small espresso cups two complimentary coffee capsules, two crème capsules, and were invited to purchase additional coffee capsules at 3 euros each, oh, and no tea bags. We were provided with a kettle but it had to be plugged in standing on the floor next to the wardrobe which meant you couldn't open the wardrobe door.Not very hospitable in my opinion. Another small thing which didn't add to our comfort was you couldn't watch the TV from your bed. To sum up, and the only way to describe our room is,  the whole ""feng shui"" was wrong. The staff were very friendly so three stars.",3,2018,05,21
19,Wonderful hotel!,"I found the hotel to be quite exceptional, especially the staff and concierge team. They were always responsive to our requests and always made us feel like a priority. The rooms were incredibly clean and housekeeping came morning and evening to freshen up the room. The amenities were also great-the spa was out of this world. My only negative comment would be that the walls seemed very thin-we heard quite a bit of noise throughout the hallways every morning and night, making it a bit less enjoyable. But, all in all, I’d stay here again. The location was superb, as well! Just steps from the main shops and about a 15 min walk (through beautiful streets) to La Rambla!",5,2018,05,17
19,Impeccable Service,We have visited several hotels in Barcelona in the past years and the Claris is without any doubt the first in our ranking. The service and the attention of the staff is beyond impeccable. The Front Desk Team went above and beyond any request as well as the concierge sharing great succestions. We now have a favourite hotel in Barcelona!,5,2018,05,14
19,Disappointed by claims to,"I went with this place because I thought the room was going to be bigger, it wasn't particularly large... 

The room was cute and well decorated and all that, but still felt cozy for my company and I. 

I was especially disappointed by how they handle property left in the room.  I left a 300 dollars hand sized electronics device on the table, along with some personal hygiene items in the bathroom.  I was shocked at how unhelpful staff was and that I'll never see these things again.  I called the very day  I checked out, a couple hours after I checked out and realized I left some things there, , and they said they'd check and get back to me. They never did.  I called again the next day and they said nothing was found in the room.

I'm surprised that at a 5 star hotel that claims to anticipate your needs, that I paid nearly 500 a night for, lets that happen.  I imagine things left in hotel rooms is fairly routine so I'm surprised at how this was handled. 

I've had friends forget books in hotels that the hotels call to alert them have been left behind, then shipped them to their place.

The aesthetics were perfectly nice, the building is lovely, staff is friendly, though there was nothing particularly memorable about it over other 5 star hotels I've stayed in.",2,2018,05,11
19,Great upscale hotel,From the moment we stepped in the door and were offered a glass of champagne to the time we checked out this hotel exceeded all expectations.  The rooms were well appointed modern and spacious.  The view from the rooftop bar was great and the food and drinks were outstanding. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona,5,2018,05,09
19,Hotel Claris - Barcelona,"This Hotel was a uniquely pleasant discovery!
I’ve stayed at many different hotels in North America, Europe & Southeast Asia - this hotel was by far the best experience!
Excellent location - superb room & facilities - staff who look after your every need...",5,2018,05,08
19,"Beautiful hotel , wouldn’t accept room 201 due to noise","Couldn’t fault hotel other than the Room being located next to cleaning cupbaord very noisy in morning (take ear plugs if you wish to lay in) staff were very polite and helpful , located close to bars and shops ",4,2018,05,08
19,Nice Hotel,"Me and my friend checked into this hotel for 6 nights, we got a free upgrade to a superior room.  The room was nice and the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was especially nice with a deep bath and a good shower.
The location was good for Casa Batllo and Casa Mila but it was a 10-15 minute walk to Las Ramblas and Placa Catalanya. 
Room Service and Reception were very nice and helpful - overall it was a good experience.
The only thing I think was missing was that there was no tea making facilities, they had a espresso machine and we had complimentary capsules, but I like to drink tea and that was not available.",4,2018,05,08
19,Barcelona,"It was our first time to Barcelona, the Claris Hotel was beautiful  great location. Staff friendly and extremely professional.  Breakfast could have been a bit more diverse. It was the same menus everyday.  Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,05,07
19,Pretentious hotel without genuine concern for guests,"In my assessment, the Claris is trying to be stylish but is merely pretentious.  If you want to be 'seen' in a high design place, then the following comments won't bother you.  The true, genuine, attention to the guest is missing.  Here are a few examples:  In the 'precious' box of coffee accoutrements (marked ""For our very special guests"") in the room, there was no actual coffee.  And each pod was 3 euros extra. When I mentioned the lack of coffee at 7:30am to the reception, the person was not really concerned, merely indifferent.
 And what if you are a tea drinker?  No kettle for hot water.  Or tea.  So, am I really a very special guest?
The bathroom sink wouldn't drain.  The lights above the bed flashed - probably because one bulb was missing and should have been replaced.
The terrace bar had no waiter.  So we couldn't order a drink.  Then he finally appeared and said he was busy elsewhere.  After asking for our check he forgot to bring it.  Clearly we are not so special!
The staff are not genuinely attentive.  
When seeking a taxi to the airport, the greeter suggested we take the hotel car which he assured us was the same price.  Actually not.  A taxi waiting across the street was less. These things matter.
On a personal note, I fail to see the design choice of a step up to the bathroom.  In the middle of the night when you are unfamiliar with the layout finding a step is a challenge.  But since 'design' is what the hotel wants, guests be damned.",2,2018,05,07
19,wonderful,"Thank you, for the wonderful stay, which we were allowed to enjoy in your hotel. Great room, great location, very friendly and courteous service at the reception desk in the restaurant. Breakfast of very good quality. Lovely again.",5,2018,05,03
19,Sightseeing,INCREDIBLE! IS NOT OUR LAST VISIT HERE. For Gaudi fans and all others. The Hotel is central and have an excellent service. Its a small Luxury Hotel. So friendly personal and a always very clean area. for connoisseurs,5,2018,05,01
19,Perfect location and the kindest staff,"The breakfast is amazing, the rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. Each one is unique, with a something special, and the decoration is very original yet welcoming and homy. Absolutely recommended.",5,2018,04,30
19,Hotel Claris - Barcelona,"An exceptional hotel. Beautiful rooms that were quiet and well appointed.   Relaxed atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, wonderful breakfast!  Located close to restaurants, cafes, shopping, local attractions and public transportation.  ",5,2018,04,30
19,"Luxury hotel, well located bit for business trips.","This a luxury hotel very well located,just one block away from the Passeig de Gracia. This hotel is OK to enjoy sight seeing Barcelona City. The bed is comfortable and the complimentary articles on the bathroom are very nice. The HD TV picture is very good with several European channels, there is also a Bluetooth speaker available. Working in the room as part of a business trip is not easy, the micro-desk does not have enough outlets to connect laptop, cell phone and any other gadget at the same time. The wood bench to sit and work is very uncomfortable, you will probably ended seating on the bed. 
I could not find a place to work with my laptop on the hotel lobby and it seems that there are no AC outlets available, only a desk with two Macs to send emails.
Any way, I could have marked 5 starts but just when leaving the room with my luggage I found a disgusting insect inside my room by the door.  Picture attached.",4,2018,04,30
19,First visit to Barcelona,"This is an excellent hotel and the staff are great, always attentive and very helpful. The room was very well equipped and cleaned to a very high standard daily. We did not use the hotel to dine as we like to eat out but from what we saw would recommend the Chinese restaurant.",5,2018,04,29
19,Noise was like sleeping on the road,I booked 2 rooms for ourselves and our daughter and we needed 2 rooms together. We were placed into rooms on the third floor looking out to the main road. At night it sounded as if we were sleeping on the road rather than in our room. There was absolutely no sound installation from the windows in these rooms - even with a pillow over heads we struggled to get to sleep. Also when I went down to reception at 1 in the morning the night manager confided in me that they had received many complaints about these rooms yet they still sell them and at full price. They say they offered to move us - at 1 in the morning!! Why should we have had to re-pack they should never have sold these rooms. I will never return here - it spoilt our holiday and recommend anyone considering this place to give it a wide berth,1,2018,04,27
19,"outstanding stay in Claris Barcelona Great service , and restaurant !","very nice welcome ! service to go to the room , luggage care,... and a super restaurant ! with beautiful wines ,...... and a greaaaat breakfast ,.... big congrats and big thank you all !! and last but not least I love the DerbyHotels philosophy to showcase pieces of Arts , I had the experience at the Urban hotel in MAdrid , and now this one at Claris !! keep it up !!",5,2018,04,24
19,Great location!,"Loved staying at the Hotel Claris. The rooms were comfortable, with plenty of room. Location was fabulous - centrally located. Breakfast was great - lots of options and the restaurant staff was very accommodating. Concierge was nice and knowledgeable, but front desk staff could have been a little friendlier at check-in.",4,2018,04,22
19,Clean hotel with attentive staff but some issues ,"I spent two nights at Hotel Claris on a solo trip to Barcelona. 

Positives:
-Attentive staff. Not overly friendly, but immediately addressed any requests or concerns.
-Great rooftop pool
-Very clean and in a great location near some popular restaurants (try tapas at Vinitus but either get there early or prepare to wait)

Negatives:
-The walls are PAPER thin. I am not a light sleeper, and I have slept in noisy group dorms just fine. However, on my second night at the hotel my neighbors arrived back at the room around 12:30 am and proceeded to blast music and talk so loudly I was woken up and could no longer sleep. I could hear every single word of their conversation, even with silicon ear plugs in (usually I can sleep through anything with them on), which is disconcerting. I called the front desk to complain and within a minute heard a knock on my neighbors' door and the hotel staff asked them to keep the noise down. I appreciated the urgency, however, despite turning down the music the walls were so thin I could still hear their entire conversation (which was amplified due to alcohol consumption). 
-The room I originally received faced an internal courtyard and didn't have a window outside at all. I was extremely disappointed and asked for a change and the staff was able to work out a new room which had a good city view.

Overall, while it was a decent experience I would not stay at the Hotel Claris again. Shoutout to the staff who is very professional; however, for a 5-star resort I had too many problems to consider staying again (namely had to change rooms from a poor room assignment initially and was unable to sleep the night before a long international flight due to thin walls in the hotel and noisy neighbors). If you do decide to stay at Hotel Claris bring ear plugs and ask for an exterior facing room.

19,Fantastic Accommodations ,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Claris and had a terrific experience.  All of the staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. We actually stayed for a few days, traveled and then returned and both of our rooms were beautiful and more than comfortable.  The breakfasts were great too!  Hotel Claris is the only hotel we will be recommending to your friends. ",5,2018,04,16
19,Outstanding!,"This has been undoubtedly the best hotel stay I’ve ever experienced! Part from my tastefully decorated room the service has been professionally on point! If you have a little extra to spend then this is would definitely be worth it. 
",5,2018,04,13
19,Best roof top restaurant in Barcelona,"We had a super lunch three course meal at the roof top restaurant. The food was delicious, and the waiters  Mario and Massimo went out of their way to make everything perfect. The rooftop is very beatuful with lounge furniture and plants as well as a sitting area with oriental rugs and shade. Worth the trip!",5,2018,04,09
19,Great hotel,"Beautiful room,great bad. Quite. Clean. Super friendly stuff, great breakfast- really great! 

all the small things that make a difference 

Worth the few xtra euros. Highly recommended 

As for location- its 25 minutes walk from gothic quarter - we had a scooter. Its also close to garcia- but its not in the middle of everything",5,2018,04,07
19,Weekend away,"Brilliant hotel 
Definitely 5stars 
Would recommend staying here, friendly, helpful staff 
Cosy rooms and lovely roof terrace! Close to all the shops, restaurant and transportation, the doormen always Happy to call you a taxi if you need one, 
Well worth a visit ",5,2018,04,07

19,"Loved it-great location,lovely hotel","Stayed here in February for a weekend break in Barcelona. It's a fabulous hotel and I highly recommend it. The staff were so lovely, friendly and helpful right from the minute we arrived. They were exceptional. 
Our room was so comfortable and very nice. There are historical artefacts in protective cases in the rooms which is quite cool. The bed was really comfortable and the room was spotless. It was lovely and quiet too.
 Breakfast was fantastic- a small but plentiful buffet and a menu which you could order anything from. It was excellent. There is a very nice rooftop pool and sitting area which we enjoyed. The location is perfect- in the centre of the city but not too hectic. We absolutely loved our stay here and highly recommend it. ",5,2018,04,01
19,Don't go there,"I travel a lot all around the Europe,and I can't understand how this hotel can be with 5 stars ,it's a scandal, nothing except the place in the center is good, bedrooms, services breakfast really DON'T GO THERE!!!!!!!!!!",1,2018,03,28
19,Superb service ,We are here for a conference and the whole experience from being greeted at the door through to the drinks service is top notch. Lovely food and wine too - very impressed overall with this beautiful hotel.,5,2018,03,22

19,perfect,"This hotel is carefully decorated with antics, the staff is profesional and ready to help. We needed parking and were glad for the valet parking. The beds are confortable with great quality linen. All in all a perfect 5 star hotel with a special touch.The rooms are spacy.Roomservice is fast and on time.",5,2018,03,19
19,Long weekend,"Noisy rooms during the week. Lots of traffic noise even though we were on 4th floor.

Good location. 5 minute walk to Metro station. 

Metro passes are must to get around. You can buy a 10 trip pass for €10 that more than one person can use or a two day pass for €15

Rooms are reasonable size etc. 

Excellent breakfast & service.",5,2018,03,18
19,Exactly what you would hope and expect from a 5* hotel,"The hotel is unique, boutique and exceptionally well run. 

The employees are what makes the hotel so special, from the guy that waits in the weather on the only impossible day (snow in Barcelona) of the year to hail a taxi to the butler-esq breakfast service that made me smile every day.

I usually like to look after myself but I appreciated the overindulgence from a service perspective this week.

10 out of 10 Hotel Claris :-)

P.s. The food and service at Mr KAO's (Dim-Sum) restaurant was equally exceptional.

Thank you all for a memorable stay.",5,2018,03,02
19,Wonderful stay at the Hotel Claris!,"We just returned from our honeymoon in Barcelona, and choosing the Hotel Claris for our trip was one of the best choices we made!! Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was so kind and helpful. They even gave us a room upgrade and some goodies in our room to help us celebrate!! The room was spotlessly clean and so spacious, and even had a real double bed (unlike those pushed-together twins...). The rooftop terrace was also quite lovely, with excellent food, courteous staff, and lovely views! They even give you a cellphone you can use for a hotspot and for international calls, so you don't need to spend money on international service!! AND, it's really well located -- close to several subway lines and the beautiful Casa Batllo. Such a great experience!",5,2018,02,25
19,Perfection!,"First and foremost the customer service at The Claris is second to none.  I have stayed at The Four Seasons many times and I would compare their attention to detail on the same level.  The setting itself is so peaceful with the concept of tranquilly throughout.  The pictures do not do it justice because it is an experience.  As you enter the hotel you are greeted by the front door by the door man and after that you are entirely and completely on vacation.  The sounds and sights of water and nature surround the concept of the this hotel.  Tranquility surrounds while hospitality is the main focal point.  
I had written in advance to let the staff know that my husband and I were celebrating an occasion and they went out of their way to make us feel special.   Upon arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful loft space, as well as upon our return from sight seeing they left champagne and chocolate and beautifully decorated our room for Valentine's Day with one large heart in the center of our bed and many small hearts around it.  It was so thoughtful and so beautifully done.  The room itself was SPOTLESS and newly renovated with a great double sink in the bathroom and gorgeous tile work. There are two levels to the room with a spiral staircase that leads to the second floor.  The upstairs loft had a seating area that could easily accommodate 6 people that also included at table and chairs if you care to have a meal in your room and just relax. I was thinking this situation would be a great one if I were traveling with a young child.  The furniture was all  new, clean and pleasing to the eye.  I requested a non smoking room and I can honestly say, not a trace of any smoke, anywhere in the building.  That in itself is a small miracle in Europe. There is a lovely clean smell that permeates the air and brings the outdoors inside.  If you are traveling in the summer there is a lovely pool area which is roof top that has a restaurant and bar as well. There is nightly turn down service complete with high quality chocolates.   Alessio Rinella the front desk manager is a delightful man who delivers first class customer service.  I can not say enough about  how professional he is. He went out of his way to make our stay memorable and enjoyable.  His restaurant and sight seeing recommendations were excellent.  
Now let's talk location.  If you want to make the most of your time in any city, location is key.   You CAN NOT beat this location, truly central to everything.  It is  located within a three minute walk to Paseo de la gracia if you walk 4 short blocks and turn to your left you will see Gaudi's Casa Batilo and so many cafe's and restaurants as well as affordable shopping. If you turn to your right all of the high end shopping is right there and Gaudi's Casa Milla is a 3 minute walk from that point.  The train station which can take you to anywhere you want to go including day trips seaside resorts such as Sitges is also only a four minute walk.  Almost all of the sites are within walking distance of this hotel.  You can walk to Las Ramblas, Plaza Real, Sagrada Familia, and all of the Gaudi houses.A walk down to the water is only about 20 minutes.  Parc Guiel is a short 10 minute cab ride which is only 8 euro or you could take the train.

I would highly recommend staying at the Claris.  It is stylish, centrally located and extremely well thought out.  If you want a stress free vacation, stay here, you won't regret it.",5,2018,02,25
19,Superb hotel in excellent location.,"What’s not to like about having two of Gaudi’s wonders on your doorstep and a pleasant walk away from the Ramblas and Gothic quarter. Great staff, lovely room and very nice rooftop pool, terrace and bar/restaurant. Very large and comfortable bed plus our very own piece of 600 BC Egyptian pottery in the room.",5,2018,02,23
19,Felt like home,"We just came back from a fabulous vacation on Barcelona, and are very glad we decided to stay at Hotel Claris. 

Set in a former 19th-century palace, this arty, upscale hotel is opulence at its best.  The rooms come with original works of art, marble bathrooms, and plush sofas.

We couldn't be more happy with the level of service we received. The hotel welcomed us with friendly service and a glass of cava as soon as we arrived. Best part, we were upgraded to a suite with an upstairs living room and a luxurious bathroom. 

We booked with the hotel directly and received a complimentary bottle of wine during turndown service. Turndown also included a bottle of water, a personal note, and some delicious chocolates.

Every room comes equipped with a mobile phone that can be used as a mobile hotspot. This came in handy when we needed to use our maps or communicate with our family back home. 

We didn't get to go to the rooftop because of the rain. I would love to go back to Barcelona and enjoy this hotel to its fullest.",5,2018,02,18
19,Great place to stay!,"Loved it! Perfect location! Would defo recommend and would return! Friendly, helpful staff makes a nice change. Plus the location is 2 minutes from about 6 excellent restaurants and bars. Lots of added extras too. ",5,2018,02,09
19,Very comfortable,"A block from Passeig de Gracia near the Renfe stop is this great hotel. Very clean and well fitted with coffee machinrs in the room, inexpensive mini bar and good sized rooms.  The wifi was a bit slow and prevented me from streaming Netflix and the breakfasr coffee was awful for Spanish standards. I didn’t pay the bill so I don’t know how much it cost but if you ge5 a good rate here its well worth a stay.",4,2018,02,04
19,Loved our hotel!,"We liiked the location, just near the center but not too noisy. Staff was helpful and friendly too. We wanted to stay more night, but next time we will stay there again. Very comfortable! Roof top was awesome!",5,2018,02,03
19,"Home away from home to perfection, offering a new benchmark in Barcelona","The welcome has been amazing, from the car valet parking through the amazing concierge Loena Dominguez, and the highly attentive team. The stay has been without any fault- just to perfection! The rooftop restaurant is a genuine gourmet restaurant while the MAYAN SPA is at a level of surrounding and treatments are at par with the world leading SPA's.
We have made a decision to make it our home away from home anytime we drive up to Barcelona.",5,2018,01,30
19,Fantastic from start to finish!,"This year, the thought of spending shocking amounts of money on plastic rubbish for my daughter's Christmas presents, quickly followed by her 9th birthday - was simply too much.  So I decided to give her an experience instead and chose a weekend in Barcelona - a chance to practise her Spanish, see some wonderful sights and be treated like a princess for a few days.  In choosing a hotel, I wanted somewhere really special so the treat would start as soon as we arrived and I couldn't have picked better.  Right from the second we entered reception we were looked after, we were given a wonderful room upgrade to a suite which delighted my daughter beyond explanation.  The room was extremely nice, beautifully decorated and fantastically comfortable (suffice to say both of us rather wished we could bring the beds and pillows home!), the coffee machine ensured I had the necessary boost in between hours and hours of shopping (!), the towels and bathrobes fluffy - I really cannot find a single negative.  The hotel is perfectly placed in the city to enable you to be able to walk easily to shop, to eat and to see (and goodness - we did all of those things!!).  The hotel is also connected to the Egyptian museum which we very much enjoyed.    The staff and the hotel itself are absolutely first class and I am told by my daughter that she wants the same Christmas and Birthday present from now on!!",5,2018,01,22
19,Beautiful with excellent service,"Allow me to clarify that I didn't stay at this hotel, I simply visited it for research for one of my books. However, the day I showed up I was completely unannounced, and I was really impressed with the staff I interacted with, the beauty of the warm but modern decor. There is something interesting to see around every corner, and the rooftop is gorgeous. Definitely worth a drink and a nibble, which I did enjoy there. The POOL looks amazing.

Hopefully I'll stay next time I go!

19,5 star Hotel with 1 star service,"Other than the bellboys who are always welcoming, the rest of the service standard is utterly disappointing. Firstly, despite settling all outstanding charges via cash over the front desk, my card was subsequently charged without my authorisation. Dropped them several emails to no avail. I do not tolerate such dishonesty. Charges were collected despite no basis of receipts. That is the most upsetting issue. 
The stay started off on a sour note because the front desk watched me struggle with my luggage yet did not arrange for assistance. Rigid and stiff welcome that isn’t the least inviting at all. During the stay, despite a do not disturb sign, numerous times the Housekeeping still came into the room. That is very worrying. 
Overall, only stay for the rooms offered. Besides that, there is nothing pleasant about the stay here. I was anticipating a decadent last stay on my Europe tour, but by the end of 4 nights in Claris, I was very much looking forward to home. 
To the manager - Please get back to me on the double charges on my card. I’m still waiting. ",1,2018,01,18
19,Great hotel in Barcelona!,"Wonderful hotel!  The staff are lovely and helpful, and the entire hotel smells so good!  I highly recommend Claris hotel.  The location is amazing.  Barcelona is a great city, and if you have a chance to go you should check out this hotel!",5,2018,01,16
19,Fantastic Hotel,The location of the hotel is ideal for visiting several sites. The team is so welcoming and helpful even before our stay by assisting with transfers and tickets to sights we wanted to visit. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona!,5,2018,01,15
19,First stay in Barcelona,Loved the loft living room with its unique decor - pleasantly surprised with  an upgrade. :) Great location with excellent service. Good selection for breakfast. Room was a little noisy from road traffic at night but otherwise very comfortable. Would have loved to stay longer. Highly recommend Hotel Claris.,5,2018,01,13
19,Most beautiful unique hotel,"Loved our room with a loft living room and beautiful furnishings!!!! We went up to the roof top bar every night to watch the sunset, eat olives, and drink wine. The bed was extremely comfortable with tons of pillows! One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. Perfect for our honeymoon ❤.",5,2018,01,10
19,Wonderful Hotel,"We spent three nights at this hotel in Barcelona. It was a great choice. The staff members were all very nice. We were greeted with a smile and hola every time we returned. The staff spoke English well. Could not pick a better location. We enjoyed the unique decor and atmosphere of the hotel. An unexpected plus was that they provided a smart phone for our use during the stay. The phone allowed us to use basic features like maps, calling locally, and serving as a mobile hot spot.",5,2018,01,10
19,Very disappointing Christmas meal,"My partner and I booked the tasting menu for Christmas day. I really wish we hadn't.

We arrived early and were greeted by a charming young man at the door who showed us upstairs. Upon arrival, the restaurant was empty. We decided to sit outside and have a drink before our meal. 

Upon being seated it was clear the staff were disillusioned and not really interested. It was just us and one other couple, and the restaurant had no atmosphere whatsoever.

Each course came, and from my experience of tasting menus, we expected a description of each course. Instead the food was just put in front of us. The accompanying wine also arrived with no explanation. 

The food was nothing special, and again the staff seemed happier chatting away and not engaging with customers.

At 200 euros, I felt cheated and upset.

What a shame.",2,2018,01,03
19,Wonderful hotel! ,"What a wonderful hotel! We stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of our winter holiday in Spain. The hotel is located in an area with so many shops and restaurants within walking distance. We never needed a car or even the metro. We literally walked everywhere we visited in Barcelona from the hotel. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had 2 rooms right next to each other for myself and my husband and my 2 teenage children. Each room was spacious, with comfortable beds and a beautiful bathroom. The only improvement I recommend is better pillows - the pillows were lumpy stuffed cotton — I would’ve expected a luxurious down at this price point. Another highlight of the hotel is the breakfast which was included in our package. The breakfast was absolutely delicious!!!! There was something for all of us!! For example... egg white omelette to order, fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals, dried fruits, pastries galore and freshly brewed coffee and teas. The gentleman in charge of the breakfast room was one of the best hotel employees we’ve ever met - he was kind, helpful and a delight! A big shout out to him!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Claris and would love to come back next time we’re in Barcelona. ",5,2018,01,02

We were not disappointed .What a fabulous hotel ,made fabulous with the help of their amazing staff .Very professional & extremely friendly at the same time. The best cocktails of our holiday were in the hotels rooftop bar.I can not rate the food as we didn't eat at the hotel as there were so many tapas bars to choose from in the area. I was lucky enough to be up graded to a duplex suite,which i can honestly say was one of the nicest rooms i have ever stayed in ,& i have stayed in some lovely hotels...Will i stay there again ...Absolutely...Thank you Claris, you made my Birthday very special",5,2017,12,19

Lovely hotel, staff and ideally positioned, definitely worth staying here.",4,2017,12,14
19,Great Hotel,"Well located with good facilities: does exactly what it says on the tin.
Nice decor, great staff who get the balance right between great service and not being pushy. Very good food on the terrace, although a bit chilly in December (!) and excellent breakfast with a wonderful manager .
Very relaxed, and nice to arrive to a glass of champagne and then to be offered at breakfast as well !
As a minor point, there was some road noise for our second floor room on the front, but perfectly livable.

There will be cheaper hotels and more expensive and swanky hotels: but for a nice city break, it ticked all the boxes.",5,2017,12,12
19,Very good price/quality ratio.,"Very good price/quality ratio, and very friendly and professional staff. Location is excellent, decoration is marvellous. If travelling with kids, I recommend booking a jr suite with a normal superior room, so that both are connected internally (two superior rooms are not connected normally).",5,2017,12,11
19,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I love our time here. We received an upgrade free of charge which always helps, the position of the hotel is ideal for citywide exploring and the facilities are excellent.

Would highly recommend",5,2017,12,08
19,Beautiful hotel.  Welcoming staff.  Good location.," The hotel Claris is both beautiful and charming.  We stayed for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We dined in the restaurant on our first night and found it very nice.  The hotel staff could not do enough for us and were very helpful and welcoming.  The only drawback for me was it was a very noisy room,  with both internal and external and noise disrupting my sleep constantly. If you are a light sleeper I would suggest asking if there is room setback from the road and not near to the cleaning station.",4,2017,12,01
19,Great 5 Star for the price,Location and service could not be better. Highly recommended. The hotel is very close to the Sagrada  Familia and the Casa Battlo for all you Gaudi fans ans in walking distance to most places of interest. Also easy an easy ride to the airport via taxi.. ,5,2017,11,29
19,Excellent Hotel and Location!,"Hotel Claris is in a perfect location for sightseeing in Barcelona.  It's near the center, on a quiet street in an upscale area.  Slightly away from all the craziness of Las Ramblas which is a good thing.  Everything is in walking distance from the hotel.  There's a lovely wine/tapas bar around the corner called Torres Vinoteca.  And just a few blocks away is Tapas 24 which is excellent!

The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  There's a great rooftop terrace with a small pool and restaurant/bar.  Great for a drink at sunset!  Also, the hotel offers a wifi hotspot you can take with you while seeing Barcelona...but we were only there 1 night and didn't get a chance to use it.  All in all the location is incredible and it's a beautiful and classy hotel.  Definitely recommend.",5,2017,11,27
19,Wonderful hotel,"This is a great hotel, with an excellent location. The staff is super friendly and accommodating!!! My room was hot and they gave me a fan that they used in their back room (that was so nice). The bed was so comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,11,22
19,Wonderful hotel and location,"The service in this hotel is great! The trust relations department is more than helpful and has some great advise regarding restaurants and things to do in the area.
The front desk staff was also great! They take the time to be of service and go the extra mile. Especially Jaap at the front desk had some really nice tips! Thanks again Jaap! 

Enjoy a glass of great wine or a delightful gin and tonic next to the pool on the rooftop! ",5,2017,11,21
19,Great hotel near Gracia,"Located near the high-end shopping street Passeig de Gracia, this is a fantastic option if you want to stay away from the crowds of La Rambla. Plenty of excellent restaurants, shops, and even a few specialty coffee shops in the area. 

The rooftop bar is excellent for evening drinks. Breakfast was great and I'm amazed how efficient the service staff were. 

The towels were extra fluffy - particularly nice during cold weather. 

2 drawbacks - there was no work table and chair in my room. I had to sit on a small stool while doing some work. The soundproofing could have been better. You can hear the street noise and also noise from the hall.",5,2017,11,18
19,Perfect!,"We were here for Barcelona Smart Cities Expo so it was necessary to have a good sleep at night. That's way we switched from the second night to a room away from the street. The hotel was very comprehensive and took all the effort to satisfy every need. Great personnel, Really perfect service, very friendly and if we come back to the expo next year, we know were to stay! Only th efirst night costs you the fifth star",4,2017,11,18
19,Amazing A1 ,"Hotel Claris was by far the most wonderful hotel experience I have ever had 
I found it as I made an appointment with the spa which was just as amazing 
The staff were great A1 service and I’m fussy !!
The room was fantastic , wonderfully presented immaculate and totally inviting there was nothing at all we required , room service was even at tension to detail !
We enjoyed roof top drinks with waiters giving us a wonderful pleasant relaxing experience pouring us wonderful local gin that was amazing !!!!
We were flying home the next day I should have found this place earlier two nights would have been great for a luxury treat 
If it in within your budget book this hotel I would again if I was in Barcelona 
Beautiful ❤️

19,Really Lovely Hotel,"Great hotel and service, from the moment we arrived to our departure. When we arrived, we were offered Cava and personally shown to our rooms. The room itself was really nice. I really appreciated the second door to the bedroom area as it kept more noise out. We also really appreciated all the big pillows and the complementary water and coffee. The bath tub was deep and great for baths - and they also provide bath salts. Nice big window with city view and comfy nesting couch for reading or relaxing. The Egyptian decor and artifact in the room was a really nice touch. Overall, the room (6th floor) was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,11,15
19,Very well Located!,"Value for Money, high level of customer attention. Very well located, very near to the heart of Paseo de Gracia.

Breakfast is very nice and freshs, perhaps more food options could bve valuable.

Perhaps some noisy rooms is some hours.",4,2017,11,13
19,Just perfect,We only stayed in the Claris for one night but it was a perfect experience from checking in to the amazing room to the location and the super friendly staff - all was just fantastic and I will be staying again in the future. ,5,2017,11,11
19,Duty Of Care,"We arrived at the hotel which is well located and were offered a cold drink which was welcome. Our room was quirky and clean etc which was the very least we would expect from a 5 star hotel.
It was my sisters birthday and I had ordered wine for the room. It wasn't there and I had to re-organise it.
We decided to have a dip in the much advertised pool, but (a) didn't know how to get there (b) were there dressing rooms or did we need to walk through the hotel in bathrobes/swimsuites?
When we did get to the pool, there was no waiter/waitress to get us a drink so we rang reception and they obliged. These are just small examples but the point I am making is that the beauty of staying in a 5 star hotel is that you don't need to have to worry about the simple things. 

After a day walking through deserted Barcelona we got back to the Hotel where the street had been shut off and asked the staff to let us know what was happening (the Catalan people were on strike in a bid for independence) I have no view on this politically but when I questioned the staff  about how safe etc it was the go out that night,they said everything was closed and their restaurant was fully booked as a consequence, so no dinner. I understand that it was a unique situation but feel aggrieved that the hotel had not felt a duty of care towards its customers. We were aware of the situation through the news but no staff warned us about the strike or demonstrations before we left the hotel in the morning and we were effectively caught up in an unpleasant situation.
Politics aside, this was a very average hotel in a beautiful city.",3,2017,11,07
19,"Excellent location, poor soundproofing","Pros: Location, location, location. A smartphone equipped with data.
Cons: NOISE

Hotel Claris offers all of the luxury that you would expect from a 5-star hotel. You arrive to cheerful staff offering you sparkling water/wine. The rooms have everything you need from slippers to sewing kit, and then some. If you travel often and have stayed in 5-star resorts, this hotel won't disappoint. It doesn't exceed standards, but it's what you would expect for what you've paid for. Personally, I prefer homier accommodations, but this hotel came highly recommended to us. 

The best part (which also came as a surprise) was the smartphone that's equipped with data. We were able to use the GPS to get around town and also stay in touch with our peeps back at home via whatsapp. Very convenient and a nice touch.

The worst part was the noise. We could hear our neighbours very clearly and also, the scraping of chairs from just above. I stayed in two different rooms during my stay; level 5 and level 6, and in both rooms, I could hear noises during the nighttime and early morning. Kind of bizarre. At first, we thought it was the bar/pool above, but even with another floor between us, there was the sound of furniture moving around. Anyway, this is my one complaint. Only one, but it's a pretty big one. It detracted an entire star from my experience. 

Worth mentioning is the location. If you enjoy walking, then this is prime location for you. It's like a 10-15 minute walk to the main strip (La Rambla) and if you're REALLY into walking, it's about an hour walk to Park Guell. (La Sagrada Famila is also a walkable distance away, but it's in the opposite direction of Park Guell.) The waterfront is also walkable distance away. Note: when I say ""walkable"", it's for people who enjoy it and wear comfortable walking shoes. 

Tips: Breakfast in the basement restaurant is crazy steep. There are a bunch of diners, cafes, and restaurants around. I recommend you walk around and try them out. Also, taxis are super easy to flag, so don't bother booking the airport shuttle bus. When we arrived in BCN, there was apparently a traffic jam on the highway and we had to wait for the shuttle bus for over an hour. Not pleasant, especially when landing after a long flight. On the other hand, when we flew back from Ibiza, we took a taxi and boy, was that fast and convenient. The costs are about the same.

P. S. Each room is uniquely decorated.

Picking a room: The higher your room, the closer (and louder) the chairs from the pool/bar; the lower your room, the closer (and louder) the outside traffic. Personally, I thought the Level 6 room was nicer decorated than the Level 5 room.",4,2017,11,03
19,"Good staff, beautiful room, awesome location","I would like to thank “Jimmy” from the breakfast buffet. He was warm , kind and paid attention to details. When i said i love Mediterranean food, he even went home & cook falafel from home the next day for us!! Roberta from front desk too! Thank for all your kind help! Our honeymoon was so memorable!",5,2017,10,31
19,Great Experience at Claris Hotel/ Barcelona,"Last October was my 2nd time at Hotel Claris -- Staff superb across all departments, friendly, professional and great attention to detail; room is cosy, bed very comfortable, quiet room-no noise, Terrace at the top is superb; location is quiet but lot of bars & restaurants nearby and very centric - Looking forward to going back, since I know.",5,2017,10,30
19,Recent stay,Excellent hotel and very accommodating hotel employees. They made us feel very welcome and wanted our stay to exceptional - which they did. Very convenient location. Had an issue with my hotel rate and the hotel manager made it right. ,5,2017,10,28
19,Good location- Boutique Hotel,"We enjoyed this boutique hotel. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were nicely decorated and the bedding comfortable. The bath was roomy. It has a nice size shower with controls for alternate shower heads. We stayed for four nights. 

Three nights we had drinks and snacks on the rooftop. It has a lovely  view and very nice and attentive servers.

The hotel is located downtown, a block off Passeig de Garcia. It is close to the major shopping area, near the Gaudi houses and far enough away from the cruise ship mob. It's about a mile from Sagrada Familia - a nice evening walk.

During the stay we took advantage of the free entry to the Egyptian Museum. We also visited the Mayan exhibit on the 1st floor of the hotel.

We will return to this hotel. Nice stay.

",5,2017,10,26
19,Would not return or recommend to others,"TLDR: if you feel that the little things are important, especially if you’re paying an average of 400 USD per night, this hotel will disappoint you. Multiple areas of poor design that makes for a frustrating stay. 

This hotel came highly recommended, so unfortunately I failed to do my usual research. Maybe my expectations were set too high. We had a junior suite on the fourth floor with breakfast included.

First, the good:
Accommodating front desk staff. We arrived at ten am and asked for an early check in. We were told that they could have housekeeping get our room ready within the hour, and they delivered on their promise. This was nice. 

Comfortable bed with nice linens. 

Oversized plush bath towels and robes

Electric blackout screen on the window. 

Android phone that you can use to navigate the city and use as a Wi-Fi hotspot for your personal phone (really great!!!)

Good breakfast. 

Now the bad. 
Housekeeping needs major improvement. They took our unfinished bottle of wine that we were going to finish the next night. They also took our robes, I suspect because they were draped over the side of the tub since there is no place to hang anything (see below). We didn’t get the robes back even after we called to request replacements. 

There is no door on the bathroom area. So if your significant other wants to sleep in while you get ready, they will have a light in their face. 

But luckily not a bright light, as the lighting in the bathroom is dim, unflattering, and harsh, and not suitable at all for doing bathroom things like shaving, putting on makeup, or styling hair. 

A loathsome rain-type shower head that pours on your head from above in the tiny shower. Want to lather up or put some conditioner in your hair or avoid washing off your makeup so you don’t have to reapply for the evening?  Nope sorry. You cannot get away from the deluge. Your only option is to turn off the water and stand in the shower shivering while doing your shower thing. And no hand held shower either. Also, both the shower and bathtub had an unpleasant moldy smell emanating from them. 

Only two itty bitty teeny hooks in the bathroom to hang towels, robes, and clothes. And draping your robes on the edge of the bathroom will get your robes confiscated without replacement.  

All these minor annoyances added up and detracted from the experience. I would not return here nor recommend this hotel to others. ",3,2017,10,25
19,Fantastic hotel,"The room was great. Breakfast is absolutely stunning, with a wide ranging variety of options. The staff is helpful, professional, nice. The location is good, close to bus, train and tube stations. This is definitely a fantastic hotel.",5,2017,10,25
19,Gem of a hotel,"Great location, excellent food; breakfast and rooftop terrace.
Service was excellent at all levels with friendly and caring staff
Would highly recommend this hotel.
Bonus is their complimentary pass to their Egyptian Museum which exceeds expectations ",5,2017,10,25
19,Beatiful hotel would return,"Great stay. I would come back. Walk to shops (la ramblas). Walk to food in any direction. Walk to la segrada familia. Doorman to hail a cab when needed. The room was perfect, huge soaker tub was wonderful",5,2017,10,24
19,Outstanding 5 Star Hotel,"We stayed in you Barcelona hotel along with our friends in room 520. We EXTREMELY EXPRESSED with your trainee CAROLINA, she is an asset to your Hotel, very promp, poliet, friendly and professional... we do have a problem with our dinner experience..the wait staff seemed to be very unfriendly and very rushed even though the dinning area was not full. We do gave to say, we are VERY impressed with all your staff, room, lobby, location and art in your hotel...the protesters were very friendly too...We would love to return to your hotel on our next trip to Barcelona and to your other 3 locations...Thanks for a very memorable experience..

19,Charming art experience in great location,"Location is great, walking distance from city center and main attractions. Amazing experience, I really enjoyed all the artpices in my room, felt like an art collector for a while. Also enjoyed the art collection in the lobby area. Very good food at the top roof restaurant, nice to dine outside, despite the view is not particularly charming, but it's nice and you can also enjoy the pool when the weather is warm. Service very attentive and friendly.",4,2017,10,23
19,Memorable Experience! ,"My husband and I spent a night at the Hotel Claris and it was superb. Our room was large, inviting with beautiful decorations the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was amazing. We dined upstairs on the roof top terrace restaurant the food, service and atmosphere were amazing. The appetizer of croquettes with ham was so delicious we still talk about them and wish we could have them again. What a memorable experience --  Hotel Claris!",5,2017,10,22
19,Wonderful Hotel,We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Claris.  The staff was excellent and the location was perfect.  We were able to walk everywhere and the rooftop terrace was lovely.  We had a great meal at the Asian restaurant in the hotel and the rooftop restaurant was very good.,5,2017,10,22
19,Beautiful Hotel!,"The hotel has an elegant, unique look inside. Our room had a sitting area and bar upon entry and then a nice sized bathroom.  The bedroom was a good size! Staff was top-notch and willing to help in any way.  We visited the roof top bar and had a cocktail.  Great views of the area!  The only negative thing I can say is we could hear our ""neighbor"" upstairs all night! Ear plugs would have helped! :)",5,2017,10,19
19,Our favorite hotel in Barcelona,"We've stayed at some wonderful hotels over the years in Barcelona, including the Omm, and the Duquesa de Cadona, but the Hotel Claris is the place we will return to on our next trip.

The location is excellent in the heart of the Eixample and easily accessed by car off a major thoroughfare, Avenida Diagonal. The valet parking was prompt and very convenient (I know that convenience should be a given with valet parking, but see my soon to be written review of Palacio Guerlain in Pamplona for some grim valet parking experiences). 

The staff were uniformly welcoming, funny, gracious and accommodating.  The rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated.  The hotel's ambience was relaxing with big open spaces a 7 story interior space with an Asian themed garden at the bottom. One of the many pleasures at the Claris is relaxing at the rooftop pool after long morning walks around the city.  The only quite minor complaint I had was that the bath tub drain was slow to drain and water pooled up while showering.  

We look forward to our next stay at the Hotel Claris.",5,2017,10,18
19,very good hotel,"very good hotel. We stayed in the duplex room, which is on two floor. Didn't really use the second floor where there is a couch and coffee machine. The decoration of the room is very special with a mix of antique furniture. The ceiling was very high in this room but I god to visit another kind of room and the ceiling was quite low. 
the terrace is very nice and the pool enjoyable. The breakfast is also quite good.
it is located in a good area 15 minutes walk to the plaza catalunya and corte ingles.",5,2017,10,17
19,"Great interior, but","This is a beautiful hotel and close to everything. The rooms are beautiful and big, but there are some things I niticed that might not be nice to people. The bathroom is spacious BUT terebis NO door. So if you are in a toilet your friend can hear and even smell everything.
But the bed and the room are really super great and clean.
What is always important to me is the gym in hotels. This hotel needs to work on that. If there is two people in the gym there is so called rush hour. Too few equipments and nothing to clean the machine after workout. 
Pool area and the teracce on the 7th floor are really welcoming like the staff in there. 
So a hint, with few extra steps this hotel could be more than perfect.",4,2017,10,17
19,Absolutley love the Claris hotel in Barcelona,"We just checked out of this beautiful hotel yesterday morning.
Cant say enough about how wonderful our experience was. 
From the décor to the rooms to the staff everything is outstanding!
Will definitely be recommending it to other fellow Canadians and friends everywhere!",5,2017,10,15
19,Extraordinary Breakfast and the best service ever,"Imagine being in Barcelona - on a sunny terrace - and having the most
Gracious and attentive person guiding you through the most delicious and giant breakfast imaginable. This is how lucky we were...Mario made the experience exceptional.
The whole hotel is great. Our suite was very special and each member of staff was both kind and professional. Thank you Mario and all at Claris !",5,2017,10,15
19,claris hotel,"very nice upscale hotel with great location and facilities. Service was excellent and friendly, great terrace bar on roof.
would give it a 4.5 star rating not a 5. I have been in some great 5""s, this was not a 5.
Breakfast was good but again I have been to vegas!!",5,2017,10,11
19,Perfect location for first time visitor,"THis was my second stay at this lovely boutique hotel.  A true 5 Star.  The location is perfect, the staff are fabulous and helpful, the rooms are beautiful!  This hotel is filled with antiques and art.  Our headboard was from the 1600’s. Cleverly mounted behind clear plastic.  The roof top pool is small but beautiful, and the restaurant is fantastic.  This hotel gives every guest an android phone for their use whilst visiting Barcelona.  You can call the USA, Canada, and anywhere in Europe for no charge.  It is also useful for maps!  This time we stayed in a duplex room, which had a large luxurious bathroom and a lovely sitting room/loft.  Would recommend this hotel very highly!",5,2017,10,11
19,Beautiful Hotel,"Within 5 to 10 minutes stroll from Sagrada Familia and La Rambla, this hotel is ideally placed. There are many quality restaurants with easy walk but the hotel's restaurant is exceptional. The service in the hotel is top notch with no problem left unsolved. From breakfast to top floor terrace restaurant and pool you are pampered. The hotel owners take an interest in the antiquities and all rooms have examples of ancient sculptures. 
If I was to venture back to Barcelona this would be the hotel I would attempt to book,",5,2017,10,11
19,Great location for exploring the city,"Enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms and beds are comfortable with good sized bathrooms and showers. If you want to get the extra breakfast buffet included in your daily rate, I do recommend it as they had a wonderful collection of healthy and local items. The hotel is an easy 5 minute walk from the Renfe L2 Nord airport train stop of Passeig de Gràcia and 5 minute walk from Casa Batlló. La Rambla, Sagrada Familia and other points of interests are an easy 20 minute walk.",4,2017,10,10
19,I'd stay here again!,"I loved this hotel. It's clean, updated, luxurious and everyone is helpful. They even provide an android phone in every room that you can take with you around the city to use as a wifi hotspot. Since I was alone, this was a surprise which made my visit amazing. They also arranged for me to have a private tour with Carmen who knows everyone and everything but more importantly she skips the tourist lines which makes it a VIP experience. ",5,2017,10,09
19,"Art, relax and super food as landmark","One of my favorite luxury hotels in Barcelona is the Hotel Claris. I have been many many times in its restaurants and in the rooftop terrace for drinks. As well in the amazing Spa Mayan Secret Spa.

But it has been my first time to sleep in the Claris.

Their 124 rooms are all different, similar but different.

I slept in a Duplex suite, the 218. It is a 35m2 suite, splitted in two stories, upstairs there is the wide living with nice velvet sofás and a huge tv and like in all rooms, an exclusive piece of Antique art.

Totally refurbished with an amazing style. One fo the big walls has a painted paper with an exotic garden.

Nespresso coffee machine, Toiletries from The White Company and Speedy wifi.

La Terraza del Claris is the gourmet restaurant with Mediterranean-inspired signature cuisine, i specially loved the amazing service and the canelloni with King parwns and White truffle sauce. All amazing.

The hotel hosts as well my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Barcelona: Mr Kao

Ther eis a médium sized pool in the rooftop which i did not use. As well a tiny gym, in the uppest part of the hotel.

Breakfast has all you can need of high quality local products, including a hot menú for eggs and pancakes. Nutella as well.

Mayan Secret Spa: awarded as Best Emerging Luxury Spa in the World in 2017, it is the first Signature Spa in Spain with original pieces of the Mayan Culture from 600 to 900BC. It is the most elegant Spa in town and offers amazing rituals like my favorite the Mayan Hot Stones & wonderful Carita facials
Mayan Secret Spa has as well a Temazcal, a pre-Hispanic Sauna traditional in the Mayan Culture. ",5,2017,10,03
19,Great stay,"We had 5 great nights at Hotel Claris, the service was excellent, breakfast delicious, roof top pool lovely. Our room was comfortable and  loved to be able to have a bath. It was easy walking distance to all the attractions we booked in to.",5,2017,10,01
19,Classy hotel,"The staff working in this hotel are without exception, conscientious, friendly and helpful. Rooms are airy and fully equipped, including a type of mobile phone that can be taken around town to contact restaurants, tourist sites or even to phone home. The decor is classy, modern but with a nod to Egyptian antiquities. The restaurant on the terrace (top floor near the pool) is staffed by an excellent team who really care about the food and wine they serve. The hotel is situated centrally about 20 minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia and the same from the Ramblas. Great hotel and highly recommended.",5,2017,09,30
19,Noisiest & worst hotel experience,"Let me start of by saying the hotel grounds were quite nice and the staff were very friendly and responsive. That being said, our 5 night stay for our special first anniversary Europe trip in Barcelona was the worst hotel experiences we have ever had. Things started off poorly on the first night when we were put in a room on the second floor which was facing an endless, incredibly loud waterfall feeding the spa pools. After informing the staff we were moved to another room on the same floor. While we no longer heard the water all night, we were now faced with a plethora of other even worse noise. We heard every sound from the people on the floor above is, from hearing them use and flush the toilet to walking on hardwood floors in high heels to what sounds like the moving of heavy furniture. Every morning we also heard the cleaning staff banging their carts against the wall, starting their vacuums in the hallway before going into the room they are cleaning, and shouting at each other from opposite ends of the hallway. In general the walls were extremely thin for such a prestigious hotel, to the point that we were woken up at 5am one night by screaming in the room beside us. The main non-noise-related issue we had was with the bed. The mattress was extremely firm to the point where we would wake up in pain, and the pillows are quite thick making it difficult for stomach and side sleepers to have a comfortable sleep. All these issues put a big damper on our trip, as we were constantly exhausted from not having a single good night's sleep. When we were checking out, the manager did meet with us at the front desk to apologize and arranged a free ride to the airport, but not enough compensation to make up for the poor experience. Definitely not a five star hotel and we would definitely not recommend on these grounds.",2,2017,09,29
19,Wonderful location and property,"Great location to walk the city and most attractions.  Staff was friendly, spoke English and were helpful with dining recommendations.  The roof top bar was a great way to spend the evening as well. Rooms were nicely appointed and clean.  ",5,2017,09,28
19,HIgh end and serene,great staff in every aspect of service; rooms some better than others. a little dark but great mechanical shades  to work the windows. showers need a little updating . not certain how the elderly are climbing in and out of those tubs. every staff member cannot say enough about. Impeccable service. ,5,2017,09,27
19,Great Place to Stay,"Beautiful hotel, very well located.We could walk to almost everything and there were some nice restaurants and cafes nearby. Our room was nicely designed and kept impeccably clean. The shower was a destination in itself :). One of the best things about this hotel was the staff. They are the greatest, always ready to help with suggestions, answering our questions, printing itineraries, etc.
I will add that the lighting in the bathroom is terrible.
We will definitely stay there our next time in Barcelona.",5,2017,09,25
19,Wonderful Stay,"We decided to stay a day in Barcelona one day before our Mediterranean Cruise and we stayed at the Hotel Claris.  The staff was exceptional, as well as the Hotel itself.  Top Notch all around, from the service, to the knowledgeable staff.",5,2017,09,25
19,Very special,"Lovely hotel with amazing rooms and service. Close to a lot of shops, bars and restaurants and we will definitely stay there again. It was my first time, but friends had recommended it, and they were right!",5,2017,09,25
19,Exceptional service!!,We stayed in the Hotel Claris on our recent trip to Barcelona. The staff was excellent and the room and amenities were first rate.  We loved having the use of the Android which helped us to avoid international roaming.  The front desk helped us organize our train tickets and other travel needs. We hope we will be fortunate enough to to travel to Spain in the future and will definitely choose Hotel Claris when in Barcelona,5,2017,09,21
19,Lovely Stay at Claris 5*GL,"Booking process was easy, check in and check out dealt with professionally and quickly. Glass of wine on arrival a nice touch and the free bottle of wine and chocolates delivered to room later much appreciated. Request for quiet room was met and e-mail from hotel before arrival requesting information on arrival time and describing other help available from Guest Relations indicated that the Hotel cared about us having a pleasant stay.
All staff including trainees were very pleasant, helpful and friendly, and represented the Claris Hotel in a positive way. As mentioned by other reviewers a mobile phone was provided in the room to take with us into Barcelona and to make free calls home (an unexpected but very nice helpful touch). The room was well equipped with very comfortable beds and coffee making facilities. The roof top terrace with Pool and bar and comfortable loungers was a very pleasant place to chill out at in the evening after being out in Barcelona most of the day. Breakfast was one of the best we have had in a hotel, lovely wide selection of fresh ingredients and the option for hot freshly cooked eggs bacon etc if preferred. We will go back to this hotel when we next visit Barcelona and have no hesitation in recommending to friends and family.",5,2017,09,18
19,Boutique hotel and great location! ,"Thanks hotel Claris for our overnight stay and loved the contemporary deco, room, services, breaky, roof bar with view and accomodating our late checkout before we started our cruise. Highly recommend! ",5,2017,09,18
19,Horrible stay,"First time visiting Barcelona with my wife, we checked in around 4 pm but we had to wait 2 hours in lobby (for room to be prepared). We booked grand suite but we found it tiny suite duplex with well decorated seating area on lower floor and small bed room/bathroom on top with tiny bed size (queen size but even shorter than normal bed), even we could not able to open our luggages except on bathroom floor (only 40-50 cm surrounding that small bed) with total bed room area 3x3 meters ! It was not convenient for us so we asked for bigger suite and they offered the biggest (king / presidential suite)  but to pay an extra 770€ for our 7 nights stay, we agreed and paid for the upgrade. Although bigger but it's lacking spirit or comfort with room smelling like humid dark basement (molds-like) as bed room was on top and seating area down with steep stairs. There were 2 bathrooms one downstairs (has jacuzzi and sauna! Never used) with tiny shower box and another small bathroom upstairs with shower. We realized that shower upstairs was draining very slowly and water flooded the bathroom (has no door) down to stairs to dripping water to our clothes were put in closet downstairs. We understood why mold and fungus smell in the room (water, wood and darkness poor cleaning and maintenance). We saw few other suites (each one is different) but all share same concept of up and down with staircase (my wife slipped once and hurt her ankle at night). We called our travel agency to check other nearby hotel and decided to leave after 3 nights (majestic hotel one block away but true 5 stars hotel). In Claris hotel, many of staff were trainees and were not professional (reception). Many of rooms facing inside without natural light or view. They have oriental statues or antique-like pieces of art in rooms and lobby (didn't care). To me, it was 3 stars hotel (service and accommodation) with some jars and statues to make it posher. To be fair, they refunded what we paid extra (770€) when we decided to leave prematurely, but overall it was expensive for what it was.",1,2017,09,15
19,Boutique hotel that is beyond 5 star,"When we entered we were greeted with wine and juice during our check in. We were early so the room wasn't ready yet, but they called us about an hour and a half before the scheduled time to tell us they had our room available. There was a mobile phone in the room for you to take to us in Barcelona as a hot spot or to make calls in. This was invaluable to us as hurricane Irma was in track to hit our Son's home in Florida. Being able to call him for free was such a relief. The folks at the desk was so kind, caring and considerate. I have never experienced customer service to this level. They made great recommendations for dinner and tours. The room was well equipped with a sitting area and separate bedroom, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The coffee in the room was wonderful. The bathroom was lovely as well. If back in Barcelona, we will definitely be staying at the Hotel Claris. 
Make sure you eat at Jamie Beriestain cafe. One of their recommendations and it was such a lovely dinner.

19,Claris an Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Claris last week with my husband had an amazing time.
The staff at the hotel was very pleasant and helpful, could not do enough for us. Roof top pool and bar was a lovely space, lovely views over Barcelona. 
Breakfast was fabulous, hot food and everything you could wish for in a breakfast. The head waiter gave excellent service nothing was to much trouble, he was great. Will defenetly go back and recommend to family and friends, Joan and Steve Ferriss, 😀

19,Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,I've only been here for 30-45 mins and I am blown away by the welcome we had! A glass of bubbly and someone to walk us to the room made for a great and homey welcome! The space is beautiful and the rooms are awesome!! So glad we chose this place to stay! ,5,2017,09,08
19,"Art, style and an incredible hotel!","From the moment you get out of the taxi you are greeted warmly, all the way through reception and to your room. A smile was freely given by all. 

The room was beautiful with art adorning the walls. A lovely leather sofa in a nook made the perfect place to read or just gaze out the window to a beautiful view of Barcelona! The rooftop pool was wonderfully relaxing in the August heat *granted my daughter had to buy many bikinis)!

Have stayed in some of the finest hotels in the world and this one definitely ranks up there!",5,2017,09,07
19,Excellent Hotel in Barcelona!,"We stayed at the Claris for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience.  The service was exceptional, the room was spacious, clean, and nicely appointed, housekeeping was top notch, and the rooftop pool and restaurant were great!",5,2017,09,07
19,Amazing hotel,"Hotel Claris is my favorite hotel in Barcelona 
The Claris is unique and special.  Rooms are very spacious and impeccably designed.  The hotel is very clean and the staff is amazing.  The staff will go above and beyond for you!!! To top it off the rooftop is cozy, and the rooftop restaurant is fantastic.",5,2017,09,06
19,Fine stay - some issues,"As we had paid for bed and breakfast, we had been told that having our breakfast brought to our room would be included in the price but only as long as we ordered this service during the breakfast hours. This does not seem to have been the case as we were charged for two room service charged (for the breakfast) and was charged for one breakfast which was inedible, despite this being told to the kitchen staff and room service staff.

We had to change rooms on the second day as the bed was a little small for two people and also was very loud (when you turned over in bed, it squeaked horrendously). Gratefully, we were moved to a new room with no issues. The toilet in this room however did not flush properly. Despite bringing this to the attention of the hotel staff on three occasions, it was unfortunately not fixed. If the toilet needed to be used for anything that was not fluid (shall we say), the toilet on the terrace had to be used instead.

We had a very good stay but the above not happening would have made it better.",4,2017,09,05
19,Fabulous Hotel,It was our first family city break and we couldn't have wished for a better hotel.  The hotel was fabulous in both location and facilities.  The staff were lovely and friendly and made us feel very welcomed especially our 10 year old.  The facilities were top class and we were thoroughly spoilt during our stay.  Would recommended it in a heart beat.,5,2017,09,05
19,Claris will exceed expectatios,"I moved into this hotel after moving out of Le Meredien on Las Ramblas due to awful accommodation . 
The staff were incredible at Hotel Claris .  They could not do enough for me as well as  every guest I saw them helping . Opt for the VIP package if you can , It was included in the deal I got . It offers a personalized breakfast on the roof top - wow . 
The awful terror attack happened when I was there , and the staff handled everything brilliantly. . Some people panicked and left early and they never charged our  friends nor  my brother for an early departure. 
All I can say is do yourself a favor and stay there . The young manager whose name I forget , speaks a few languages well , and will make your stay feel like a home of your own . 
Neil",5,2017,09,04
19,Brilliant Barcelona trip,"Very good hotel helpful and friendly staff had lovely facilities such as roof pool and cocktail bar also a
Nice Spa the hotel is in an ideal location everything in walking distance to the shopping and tour bus routes would definitely stay here again if going back for a trip to Barcelona ",5,2017,09,04
19,Expectations not met as returning guest!,"As a returning guest, naturally expectations of service becomes even higher but I don't feel that Claris takes special note of returning or more regular customer. I would suppose there should be a database that record guests based on email address and reception or management should pay attention to returning and regular customers with early check in or late check out or room upgrades. Or just a hey Sir, welcome back to Claris. But it's always the same old adage of ' have you been here ' ' can I show u ur room' ' first time in Barcelona'.  The ability to 'know' or at least pretend to 'know' returning guests therefore sets hotel chains like ritz, W from the rest. 

But the room did not disappoint luckily. Staying in 217, a grande duplex suite, luxuriously appointed with a centrepiece piece sofa and a green chandelier. The bedroom with a Super comfortable bed and indulgent pillow menu is on the second level. With two bathrooms, what more can one ask for! 

And well...follow on service impeccable. Gotta commend the doorman and Housekeeping. Well pretty much most people u come into contact with. 

U gotta booked yourself here! As a new guest, you would love the attention. As a regular guest, expectations higher. ",3,2017,09,02
19,Great Barcelona Hotel,"Just the nicest service, nothing was too much trouble, looking forward to going back there tomorrow for the last days of our holiday. Great location in easy walking distance of most of the sites. Will definitely stay here again. It has a lovely roof top pool with a restaurant and bar in the roof too. Small note the coffee was delicious. ",5,2017,08,31
19,Great location,"We had a very good experience in this hotel .. the staff and the services were very good ..the room junior suite was perfect and the location was wonderful , I definitely recommend this hotel for my friends !",5,2017,08,27
19,A beautiful stylish hotel ,"Stayed at the Claris hotel for 3 nights this week. 
Had a wonderful stay, hotel is stylish and comfortable.
Pool area and the roof bar and terrace are stunning. 
Staff extremely helpful and nothing seemed like too much trouble. 
I would recommend the hotel to anyone who likes a bit of luxury and it's near to everything you would go to Barcelona to see. 
I will definitely, return 5* 
",5,2017,08,25
19,Excellent value for money,Although we booked during the high summer season prices were reasonable. Excellent location in a quiet street next to all major tourist attractions. 7th floor with pool and tapas bar is extremely enjoyable . A sure value,4,2017,08,21
19,Top qualty hotel in great location,A wonderful hotel to stay to get the best from Barcelona.  Within walking distance of most attractions and the beach (if you're happy to stroll for 30 mins).  Also good for location for access to the quality shops around Gran Via.  The hotel itself has a really nice roof terrace and pool.  This is however relatively small with only a few beds so on a few occassions it was impossible to chill by the pool on days when we had planned to just take it easy.,5,2017,08,17
19,Very elegant and pleasant hotel,"A very interesting museum/hotel concept. The staff is very nice and highly professional. The rooms are comfortable and stylish but we could hear what happened in the corridors though, which is unacceptable in a five star hotel. Nevertheless, there were a cute (a bit noisy) pool, unique pre-columbian sculptures in the rooms and a spa. I recommend it.",5,2017,08,17
19,Lovely Hotel and great location,we stayed for 4 nights and had a lovely stay. The staff were very welcoming and always helpful when needed. It was a bonus have the pool and even though not many chairs its nice to come relax after a day of walking around the city. The rooms are a great size and comfortable. We will be back to stay very soon!,5,2017,08,17
19,"beautiful,botique hotel","excellent location, small boutique hotel.  room was well furnished snd comfortable.  bath was generous in size.  staff very helpful.  an extra bonus- owner pf hotel also owns the Egyptian hotel across the strert and you get free admission.",5,2017,08,16
19,"Great on the outside, but a few misses with the details","This was our post-cruise hotel.  The hotel is very nice.  The front desk is ready for the bus from the cruise ship, a nice envelope of information, excellent bathrooms, all the things you need right away are available.  The room has a unique wonderful feature!!  a free mobile phone which allows you to call the USA and some other countries for free.  This was wonderful after a cruise to call home.  We have been using free and ship WiFI but calling was great.  Down sides.. We were two sisters traveling together and the bed was a queen, the clerk said, they did not have twin beds in the entire hotel. She said even it the largest suite, it was a queen bed.  We were only staying one night so we made it work but this is not comfortable for two adult women traveling together.  Second and the larger issue is the tub/shower.  My sister and I both found it very difficult to get into the tub.  The tub is too high, perhaps great if you like to soak in a tub but we wanted to shower.  Then the controls for the shower at at the head of the tub, you have to basically have the water come on you when you turn it on. I think this is a huge safety issue.  I, in fact, turned the wrong tap on and the water was extremely hot.  I had to yell for my sister to come and help me as I was afraid I would be burned.  

Back to a good point.  The door men.  There are two delightful door men.  Both were so helpful.  One gave us directions and the other helped us with a cab.

One tip, be sure to take a card or something with the hotel name and address on it if you think you will need a taxi to get back to the hotel.  Several times we asked people to give us directions and they did not know the hotel.",4,2017,08,14
19,"Hip, small hotel","This hotel is a bit dark and a bit too hip for a family with 3 kids, but that is just a style issue. The hotel is perfectly located, the rooms are very comfortable, and the little pool (though it can get crowded) is divine. A pool is not easy to come by in central Barcelona and it is great to have.  The breakfast is also well done, with both buffet and a la carte offerings.  They are a bit understaffed in baggage and at the front desk and get overwhelmed, so plan accordingly. The doorman runs the place.",4,2017,08,13
19,Definitely recommended,"The hotel itself was clean and modern with plenty of amenities. Little touches such as a glass of bubbles when you arrive and an umbrella when it rained made it all the more deserved of 5* rating/review. When we were staying it was also my girlfriends birthday and they made it all more special with complementary extras and staff that went the extra mile.

If I had any complaints, storage in the rooms was lacking, the gym could do with a few more bits and there could be some more seating by the pool.

All in all however very hard to fault.",5,2017,08,11
19,Only gave 5/5 because trip advisor wont allow 6/5,"An amazing hotel geared to total customer satisfaction. Truly special. The pool on the roof is the jewel in the crown and is wonderful after a day around town. Hilario, Pancho and Kevan ( Pancho pequeno) are helpful and friendly. It is the small touchs that makes this place special. Complimentary morning tea and coffee brought to the room daily., Free safe boxes. A lovely smell and cool aircon in reception day and night make it a relaxing place. The room was stylish, spacious and comfortable. We will return.",5,2017,08,09
19,Nice hotel in Barcelona.,"Hotel Claris is in an excellent location and it is quiet. Rooms are beautifully decorated. The only thing that we would have changed is the fact that there's no door on the beautiful bathroom. So if one of us used the bathroom at night or early in the morning, the other person would have woken up due to noise and light. But it was a small issue and not too important. We stayed in an executive room and our 3 children stayed in a Junior Suite. However the Junior Suite was a lot more cramped so I think the Executive room is much better. Staff are very good and friendly and the hotel is very clean. There is a nice roof terrace with a small but lovely pool. We felt very welcome there and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",4,2017,08,05
19,"Great hotel in a fabulous position, close to shops and attractions!","We loved the Hotel Claris, and found the position to be perfect for shopping and sightseeing.  Spacious room and bathroom and very good service.  Breakfast was great, and the location was great for walking and exploring Barcelona.  An easy city to navigate, and the Claris was a nice spot to return to at the end of a busy day.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,03
19,Nice stay,Was there for a business conference for few days. Nice hotel with excellent location! Liked the breakfast and the rooftop bar. Service was a bit confused...Good but not great. All in all would stay again if in Barcelona because of the location.,4,2017,07,28
19,All in a days stay,"We stayed at the Hotel Claris for the last night of a 5 day trip.  The location is killer (shops, restaurants, attractions), staff informative and helpful and amenities terrific.  We sat on the roof top for a couple drinks to end the night/trip and it didn't disappoint!  ",5,2017,07,28
19,Disappointed,"A nice hotel, but not a 5* hotel.

We booked a Junior Suite and were allocated room 517.  This room has no view because it looks out onto a brick wall just a few feet away from the window.  We could not even see any sky.  We were also disappointed to discover it was just a very large room with a bed, sofa and a small table with 2 chairs.  We have stayed in similar sized/equipped rooms in other hotels and this room would have been sold as an ‘executive’ room.  The hotel description lists ‘Two flat screen LCD TV’s’ which implies you would have two separate rooms.  In fact the room has just one TV, because it is just one room.  

The room is supplied with a Nespresso coffee machine, but because of the positioning of the few electric points in the room, we had to balance it beside the basin in the bathroom (the alternative would be to place it on the very small designer lump of wood that served as a bedside table or place the machine on the floor).  The coffee machine comes with just 4 complimentary pods and after that you are expected to pay 3 Euro’s for any additional coffee pods.

The bed was comfortable, but a good night’s sleep was not achievable because the walls were very thin and noise/conversations from the neighbouring rooms and corridor were clearly audible.  On Monday our neighbours had an early morning wakeup call at 6am – we really appreciated that!  We also appreciated the children of another family ringing the doorbell to our room and running away!

The shower got top marks but then lost a few because the hidden pipe work became noisy during peak periods.  The hotel were not able to resolve this issue during our stay.

The most amusing part of our stay, was a call from the customer relations the day before check out to ask if we appreciated the hotel/room.  Of course, we expressed our disappointments and was then asked,

‘Would you like a wakeup call tomorrow morning, to make your experience with us even better?’, 

‘No, we don’t want a wakeup call, and that would not make our experience with you even better.  We are disappointed with the room’

Customer relations response was ‘OK.  Goodbye’.

We won’t be staying at Hotel Claris again.",3,2017,07,25
19,Hotel Claris (July 14 to 20),"Absolutely fantastic experience staying with my young son at Hotel Claris!  Check in/out was simple and all staff members were very attentive.  Our room was perfect and the amenities were great.  We took advantage of the pool daily where we appreciated the views, service and free available towels.  The terrace restaurant was great.  Location was ideal -- tonnes of restaurants/cafes nearby with a 10-15 walk to Placa Catalunya or Sagrada Familia.  Great shopping very close by as well as a few 24 markets for whatever essentials you may need.

The absolute best part of Hotel Claris was use of a phone that acted as my personal hot spot which allowed me to go by my day as if I was still at home -- emails, phone calls, etc.  This is something I've never experienced at any hotel before and it was much appreciated.",5,2017,07,25
19,A gem in the city,"A high quality hotel with very helpful & friendly staff. Great if visiting Barcelona,not too big with a lovely roof top bar & pool over looking the surrounding area. Excellent location for most sights,shops & restaurants.",5,2017,07,24
19,Awesome locations and customer service,"Never stay anywhere else except the Hotel Claris when in Barcelona.From the delicious breakfast to the high end designed rooms, and the rooftop pool and bar, it was a nice place to escape  after a day of sightseeing and the heat. The neighborhood is very safe and enchanting.  It is centrally located to the metro plus the local train system.",5,2017,07,24
19,Early Spring Trip,"We spent four nights at Hotel Claris late February, 2017.  The property and the employees were wonderful.  The inside of the hotel and the rooms are all updated and modern.  The beds were extremely comfortable and with the roll down shutters you will find yourself sleeping later than you want.  We were able to walk everywhere including the Sagrada Familia, the market and Casa Battlo.  There are coffee shops and restaurants very close by.  There is a rooftop bar and restaurant that is very nice.  We would stay there again if we return to Barcelona.",5,2017,07,23
19,Great hotel with one flaw,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the breakfast excellent and the room, whilst not large, was well designed. Good wifi but a bit slow to connect on occasions. The location is excellent to get around the city.  The rooftop pool was also very pleasant even if it could be a bit crowded at certain times. Free entrance to the Egyptian museum was a bonus

The flaw was the bed, which was seemingly comfortable on first feel, but the  springs either demonstrated that  the bed was not in its first flush of youth or a better design should have been chosen.",5,2017,07,23
19,Sheer opulence,"As my maiden name before getting married was ""Claris"" I was intrigued to stay here . From the number of pillows you get to choose for your perfect nights sleep to the  the complimentary wine and expansive  upstairs lounge area along with a perfect location one could not possibly be disappointed. Breakfast was ample and served by attentive staff. On arriving at the hotel you are greeted and treated like Royalty. Definitely 5* for us.",5,2017,07,22
19,Lovely hotel. Spacious rooms,"The staff speak perfect English, food on roof top superb. Pool too small. Kids took over. Rooms comfortable and spacious, beds lovely, clean. Centrally located. This is a must stay in Barcelona. Boutique style hotel, built behind the old facade. Modern, well equipped rooms. ",5,2017,07,22
19,Pretty building superficially nice people but fails to provide adequate services,"This hotel is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, which is usually a good sign. But not here. It was nearly impossible to sign into the internet. The phones were fancy, but not labeled so that I had to call the hotel from a cell phone to order a wake-up time.
We were supposed to be entitled to special services, like early check-in and check-out, but in fact our check-in was after 5:00 PM and we got no early check-out. At breakfast, we had to order eggs from the waiter. We did, but they never came. There was a bright light shining in the window all night and there were no shades. (See picture). The elevator sometimes failed to stop even with the floor causing the users to trip as they exited. I needed to find a space to make a business call after checking out and some of the workers were positively nasty about providing it. We couldn't get a drink on the rooftop terrace as it was only for diners. We couldn't take advantage of a $50 credit for a similar reason.",1,2017,07,21
19,Not so good,"Pretty building with great doorman.  Room not made up by 5 pm on day 2.  Thin walls and many missing details -- drawers not properly working, no hooks for towels, few outlets, drain broken, shower door improperly attached etc...
Not worth the price.  ",3,2017,07,19
19,LOVELY HOTEL,"I can honestly say we had WONDERFUL service ...rooms were larger than I expected...the terrace bar is very nice , although small and if pool is what you want it is 'tight' but still quite nice. Drinks and food is a little pricier than on the street but consider the accommodations...I had a message at the spa...wonderful experience ....only complaint was it got hot in our room by late morning and didn't really cool off til evening..granddaughter's room next door was fine🙄...but at night it was perfectly cool!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend this beautiful hotel!!!",5,2017,07,14
19,Perfect for a city break,"The hotel is situated in the city center. It is very easy to get around as the transport and metro stations are a two minute walk. If you like walking it is also near enough to get to the gothic district on foot. The main Gaudi monuments, La Pedera and Casa Batllo, are just a couple of blocks walk away. 
The rooms in the hotel are spacious and comfortable. The owner is an archeologue and it is interesting to visit the mini museum on the first floor or to admire the pieces of his collection that decorate the modern rooms. The breakfast is excellent and the staff are friendly and professional.",4,2017,07,14
19,Wonderful design rooms and staff,"I really enjoyed my stay at this beautifully designed hotel. My room was gorgeous and one of the most unique I have stayed in. 
Spent some time at the rooftop bar and pool where staff were just perfect. Great place to cool off, have a drink and get ready for the evening. 
The best thing was their portier mobile phone. It acts as a hot spot for your mobile and  I popped it in my bag and took it with me everywhere so I didn't need to worry about wifi or mobile roaming. It also had suggestions for restaurants shops and itineraries. Such a good idea hope to see more hotels provide this service.
All of the staff - front desk,  porters, cleaning etc were really friendly and helpful. So many choices in this wonderful city and I am glad I chose the Claris",5,2017,07,14
19,July Barcelona,"Very nice hotel with rooftop pool. Wish there were more seats by the pool, can be crowded.
Didn't use the restaurant, so can't tell you how it was, but the seating outside was not available for food service, only drinks.  We woke up in the middle of the night because the staff was clearing dishes...not a good time to do that. But mostly very good, and convenient to sights, bus, taxi, etc.",4,2017,07,13
19,Wonderful stay,"On booking this hotel a few months ago online directly with hotel website, I experienced an issue which on contacting the hotel was rectified quickly and pleasantly.

Was emailed by the hotel a few days before our arrival asking if we had any special requests etc. 

We arrived earlier than 3pm check in and our room was ready. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite. Check in was quick and easy, and we were offered a lovely chilled glass of cava, which after a morning of traveling was very welcome.

Our suite was on the 6th floor and was well laid out. Super duper comfy bed, with lots of pillows! Great bathroom with separate bath and large walk in shower, with The White Company toiletries.

Fabulous rooftop terrace with lovely views, and a nice pool. Didn't swim or eat in the restaurant so can't comment. But had a couple of drinks and staff were quick and efficient, and cocktails were very good.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend and stay here again ",5,2017,07,12
19,10/10,Fantastic location and a beautiful hotel. Staying here was a real treat from the simple things such as the exceptional courtesy of the staff to the chocolates placed on the pillows each night and free bottled water which appeared daily. The millennia old Ecuadorean figures in a display case were also an interesting quirk! Highly recommended - we will definitely look to stay here again.,5,2017,07,12
19,"Nice hotel, GREAT rooftop pool and lounge","Nice hotel, liked the location, rooms were small but fine, but if you want to hang out and relax after a long day of seeing the sites, great rooftop lounge, pool, and club sandwich! Staff was courteous and helpful",5,2017,07,10
19,Wife 50th Birthday ,"Lovely hotel, staff very friendly and very efficient. Staying now for my wife's 50th Birthday. Rooms very good size and very modern. Thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona. Not too expensive, breakfast lovely and has a roof top bar. Close to main thoroughfare and we walked to the marina area which takes about 30 minutes.",5,2017,07,08
19,Not a tourist hotel,"We were visiting Barcelona for the first time and chose this hotel. The hotel is not suited for holiday travel and is better suited discerning business travellers. The room we got was very small. We are both tall people and the modern bath tub was too small for our liking. We had a comfortable sleep. The many pillows made the small room even smaller. Although the reception was friendly, the introduction to our room was dissapointing. The hotel offer its guests a roaming data device. The battery life of this instrument was about two hours - not much help if you are sight seeing in Barcelona. Also nobody explained to us how the device must be charged. We could therefore use it for only two hours on day one and not at all on day two! I handed the device to the consierge with a request to deliver it to our room and to connect it to the charger so that we can use it once back in the hotel. This request was ignored. The front desk staff other than the lady at consierge desk was most helpful and all have a good command of English
The hotel is not well located for sightseeing and requires a strenous walk to the La Rambla and tourist bus stops. Taxi service was good and they are easily available
This yupie style hotel is not recommended for tourists",3,2017,07,08
19,Get the Duplex/Loft,"Excellent hotel.  Spacious by European standard.  We got the ""duplex"", which has a second floor where there is a sofa and a TV.  High ceiling which makes the room feel much bigger.  Nice little pool with a bar on the roof.
They even give you a free Android phone to use, with unlimited call to US and data.
",5,2017,07,06
19,Barsi,Very nice and clean in a great location. We like the modern design and service was great. Close to shopping and all sight seeing. We walked to all of them. Swimming pool on the roof was very good too.  ,5,2017,07,05
19,Amazing hotel,This hotel is really amazing and i really felt that i was invited in someone's home. Classic art and room looks fancy inside. Service is fantastic and I would really recommend it for everyone.  View from the window tells me that i am really in Barcelona.,5,2017,07,04
19,Strongest recommendation ,"We stayed at this lovely hotel and could not possibly have had a better experience. The staff is friendly and super helpful, and the ambiance of the hotel is beautiful. The location is perfect with many restaurants within a short walk and sights easy to get to. ",5,2017,07,03
19,Not as classy as we'd expected,"We booked a 'superior' room that had No coffee making facilities, no free water, and breakfast charged at an outrageous 25€ pp per day. 

Our flight arrived at 1030am but whilst check out was midday they made absolutely no effort to get us a room until bog standard 3pm although they promised they would 'try their best'. Didn't even bother. We got a room at 3.05pm. So had to hang around for nearly 4 hours.

Can only say on the positive side the location isn't bad.

Last visit to this hotel. Avoid.",3,2017,07,02
19,Fantastic Hotel.   Has everything you need.,"We really look forward to returning, road bit noisy, friends room quieter, the staff helpful, friendly, efficient. Rooms very clean and comfortable, beds great breakfast great, lovely rooftop bar and restaurant. Great place to stay. ",5,2017,06,30
19,Good and no too good,"We booked this hotel for a long week end to celebrate a special birthday. The reception was warm friendly and welcoming although the oriental receptionist was guilty of trying to give too much information while we were taken to our junior suite. 
The room was very comfortably furnished with, whirlpool bath, large shower and sauna. The bed was very comfortable. The decor was definitely not too out liking it was very dark, all the furnishing was black the only window was covered by a black net curtain to give privacy from the occupants of the building opposit. This necessitated having the lights on most of the time. The full length window lacked an outside safety rail and was kept locked. Each room has an artifact from the museum collection housed in a glass case. We also had a small antique wooden chair and foot stool. 
A mobile phone with free wifi access was provided in our room for use during our stay. As our room had no outside space to enjoy the hot sunny weather we lookied forward to using the roof terrace and pool. The sun terrace is a small but very pleasant area. The  hotel is very popular with large and family groups and we were usually unable to get either a seat or access to the pool which has an access ladder situated at the far end and which is difficult to reach because of always occupied sunloungers  situated at the edge of the pool.  There is no other walkway around the pool. there is a small terrace restaurant/ bar which is used for family and other celebrations so again is often very crowded or on one occasion closed,   for a private function. An alternative cocktail bar is available on the ground floor. 
  breakfast in the basement restaurant is excellent with both buffet and a la carte items freshly prepared. We had tapas on our first night which was very good but expensive ( 1 tapas, 1 hamburger 1 glass of cava and 1 gin and tonic 62€) 
The hotel is located centrally with easy walking to the main tourist sites or local transport. A map is provided and all staff are willing to help giving directions.
Without a doubt the best thing about this hotel is the staff, nothing is too much trouble, they are genuinely keen to be of service and always with a smile, from the doorman the reception, restaurants and housekeeping staff.",4,2017,06,28
19,Wonderful city break at this lovely 5* hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay at The Claris.  They contacted us prior to our stay to ask if we had any special requests.  We asked for a quiet room and were delighted that we were upgraded to a junior suite on our arrival, with champagne and cake to celebrate my partner's birthday, which was a really nice touch.  The room was spacious and very quiet although it didn't have a view but as we weren't spending much time inside, it didn't matter!  Although quite small, the roof top bar and pool more than made up for no view from our room, with a very comfortable area to relax and swim at the end of a busy day sight seeing.  The light snacks served there were excellent but expensive, as were the drinks but then we acknowledge we were paying a premium for the comfort and views of a roof top bar. The reception staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.  We made the most of our 4-day stay and saw as much as possible of this wonderful city, which has everything; stunning architecture, lovely beaches (go further along to the Port Olimpic and Poble Nou area if you want sunbeds and a little more space as the first beach you come too is packed, mainly with youngsters playing loud music!).  We enjoyed a walk to the beach (about 45 minutes) as it took us down streets we might have otherwise missed!  We did the bus tour, which was a fantastic way to see the city and then walked back to any areas or buildings we specifically wanted to spend time in.  The Sagrada Familia church is simply awe inspiring and an absolute must-see.  All-in-all, a wonderful memorable stay.            ",5,2017,06,25
19,Unique rooms with great hospitality,"Excellent location right in the city centre. We could walk everywhere. Plenty of restaurants and the tour bus stops nearby. There is a huge and welcoming reception with very helpful staff. Convenient internet facilities for in house use as well as to carry out with you. We stayed in the junior suite which was a duplex. Complimentary wine bottle waiting in the room! Beautiful, unique decor of the rooms with interesting decorative pieces. I slept so well as the room was dark and cold even when it was sweltering hot and bright outside. The bed is comfortable and massive and the house keeping services are very good. There is a roof top pool and bar. They have a Mayan secret spa as well but we did not have the time to check it out. Would definitely want to go back for the spa. I highly recommend this hotel if you want luxury close to the city centre and not afraid to indulge a little. It is expensive but we left feeling the stay was worth the price.",5,2017,06,22
19,Will be back,The hotel is elegantly designed and the staff is hospitable and helpful.  My husband and I asked for recommendations for a nearby dinner spot for date night and they were spot on.  We'll definitely be back!,5,2017,06,20
19,"Trendy, modern hotel with exceptional service, great roof bar and pool and LOCATION!","We loved everything about this hotel.  We had a superior suite room which is 2 story (bedroom upstairs), but would have upgraded this had we known about what you get for a step up.  The lobby is fun and ultra modern--maybe not to everyone's taste but we liked it.  Doorman, concierge, reservations staff and everyone was extremely helpful and friendly.  These folks understand that service is what sets 5 star hotels apart.  The breakfast room is beautiful and the breakfasts excellent, but the rooftop pool is a wonder when you have hot weather in Barcelona.  There is a lovely bar on the roof that has excellent views and nice drinks, and you can have a nice but somewhat pricey meal too.
We also used the gym on the roof (evening better than during the steamy days) with limited but sufficient equipment, but plenty of water.  A real plus to have a pre-programmed phone available in your room and as a take-away hotspot. You also cannot beat the location--in the middle of everything you may want to see.  We will be back!",5,2017,06,20
19,Very good,I enjoyed my stay. Staff was helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was really excellent!! During breakfast the Staff remembered every detail also the day after. Rooms a little bit too small but clean and nice. ,5,2017,06,20
19,Great Central spot,Had a great visit to Barcelona. Stayed 4 nights and everything was perfect. Great service. Wonderful breakfasts included and a awesome roof top bar and pool.even had one of my favourite single malts to end the evening. The hotel is very central and easy to access when driving into town. We dropped the car and walked every where. Staff is young and energetic and always there to help with special needs ,5,2017,06,19
19,Just perfect ,"Stayed here for 4 nights . Brilliant location . Faultless service , nothing is to much trouble for the staff .
They provide you with a mobile which works as a WiFi for your own mobile so we had Google maps and trip advisor throughout our stay when out and about.
The hotel is beautiful , the pool is excellent , the staff are brilliant.
5* Faultless hotel ",5,2017,06,15
19,Best Choice in Hotels!,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful and the service was world class. The location of this hotel is great, which saved us some money on cab fares. The hotel staff greeted us with a glass of cava and excellent service. The room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was stocked with plush robes and bedroom slippers, as well as some unexpected toiletries like luxury bath salts, a nail care kit, and even nighttime pillow spray! I loved that the staff took time to provide a fresh rose in the room as well as an invitation to a cava and jamon (ham) tasting the following evening. The BEST part of this hotel was that they provided a smartphone free of charge to carry with you around the city. For someone who has to pay extra to use data internationally, or someone who doesn't have great reception, this walking hot spot is a huge win! I've never seen a hotel offer something like that before. I will definitely be recommending Hotel Claris to any friends with plans to visit Barcelona, and I hope to stay in another Derby Hotel again sometime!",5,2017,06,15
19,good hotel in the city,"we were pleased the hotel was very friendly and helpful. the recommendation for dinner and lunch were excellent.
Bed was a little hard for my liking and the room very noisy from other room but over all excellnet",5,2017,06,15
19,Hotel made to order,"What a wonderful hotel. Right from the start the staff were friendly. We had a quiet room that was modern and clean. We absolutely loved the free hot spot phone, so we could take it with us on our adventures. 
Our next love was the rooftop pool. Just perfect now that the warm weather has arrived. The bar and lounge seating are also fantastic.
Having a last minute dip in the pool after much walking on our tours just ended our stay in the right way.",5,2017,06,15
19,"""Funky Vibe""",I walked into the lobby and surprise! Very eclectic. Modern and zen at the same time. The vibe continues into the rooms. Super comfy bed with lots of pillows and a contemporary bathroom with a large shower. The staff were nice and accommodating. The breakfast was delicious. There was a big buffet and you could order eggs too. Great location near great shopping and restaurants. Try Mr. Kao in the hotel. The food is amazing!,5,2017,06,14
19,Hidden gem,Wonderful service and very helpful reception and conceiierge great breakfast and received upgraded room when it became available provided a free loaner phone with hiding hot spot to link our other phones so no need to make arrangements for overseas phone,5,2017,06,13
19,Sleepless in Barcelona,"Room 611 was noisy. There was a bar on the roof, open until 2am Saturday mornings, 611 was directly beneath!! Sleeping was impossible. On leaving the response to our complaint was inappropriate. We expect better of a 5* hotel.",3,2017,06,13
19,Exceptional Hotel,"Concierge went above and beyond. I accidently left my backpack in a taxi while visiting Parc Guell. The concierge located the lost item, which was returned safely. Diana and Natalie in Concierge are awesome. ",5,2017,06,11
19,Hotel Claris  Barcelona,"We loved everything about the Claris.  Perfect location, gracious care of us, wonderful spa, artistic and comfortable rooms.  We enjoyed the roof top bar and pool.  As our Spanish is limited, we appreciated that they could converse with us in English.  It was absolutely wonderful and perfect for us.",5,2017,06,11
19,Fabulous location and decor,I really enjoyed my stay at the Claris Hotel.  On arrival I was offered an upgrade to a junior suite and handed a smart phone for use in the city.  These two gestures set the tone of my stay.  The phone is an unbelievable advantage allowing you to use your own iphone via hotspot to the hotel's supplied smartphone.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff extremely accommodating.  The hotel is in a fabulous location just near the beautiful passieg de Garcia and walking distance to the hustle and bustle of La Rambla. Of an evening after an exhaustive day walking the city we enjoyed pre dinner drinks in the roof top bar.  I would highly recommend the Claris for a stay in Barcelona.,5,2017,06,11
19,QUality Hotel and Service,"Superb hotel in a very convienent location.  The rooms are decorated in a totally different style to the standard hotel.  Each room has an Eygptian artefact encased in glass, which, if like ourselves we found this a little disconcerting, so covered it with a towel when we went to bed.  The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble.  The roof terrace bar, which is on the seventh floor, gives a good view over the locality.  Two cocktails cost €30.
The only thing we could find a negative comment about was the shower which is over the bath.  I am 5ft 2"" tall And found it difficult when trying to get out of the shower.  There are two fixed glass panels with only a small aperture so please take care.",5,2017,06,09
19,Great accommodations with perfect service,"Hotel Claris is a special place, combining great facilities with impeccable service from the entire staff. Special mention of Mario, who made our lunch at the hotel's beautiful rooftop restaurant, La Terraza, a most delightful experience. Terrific, imaginative cuisine coupled with service that was so very attentive and friendly. What an amazing welcome to Barcelona!",5,2017,06,06
19,Like sleeping in a museum!,This is a lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona. I love the museum quality pieces throughout the hotel including in the room. It was like sleeping in a museum! The one problem was the bed. It was so hard I had a difficult time sleeping. Also it was only a queen instead of a king. other than that it was wonderful. The staff was extremely solicitous.,5,2017,06,05
19,Great weekend celebrating my wife's 40th,"Great hotel with lovely rooms. Excellent location with the roof terrace and pool being the highlight which is great for drinks before a night out. Really clean hotel, staff excellent and couldn't really fault it. ",5,2017,06,05
19,"Very good 5 star hotel, well located.",Well appointed 5 star hotel well located in a quiet yet very accessible area and away from the chaos around Las Ramblas. Great rooftop pool and bar for end of the day relaxing and drinks before dinner. Rooms were well appointed and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent and included buffet as well as made to order items. Would stay again on a return to Barcelona.,5,2017,06,05
19,"Good location, some poor quality rooms","We checked in and were offered to upgrade to a junior suite for €40 per night extra.  A few hours earlier my sister had checked in a was offered to upgrade to a junior suite for €0. Had we have not seen the layout of hers we may not have been as disappointed.  Our bathroom was much smaller. My sister had a separate bath and shower, ours was in one.  No where to put our toiletries. The acoustics in the room was very poor, we could hear people coming and going all night and on the second night there was running water all night from upstairs.  We had to call a couple of times to ask for water, also though reception stressed if we needed anything they were there to help (as long as you kept asking). Having said that the location was very good, the amenities were good and it was very clean.",3,2017,06,05
19,Brilliant beginning ,"We just had the most brilliant and delighful time at the Hotel Claris. Barcelona was our first stop on our first time to Spain and I can't gush enough about our fabulous experience. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful and they are fluent in english.  The boutique hotel is very well located in the heart of Barcelona. The day we arrived there was  a taxi strike and with some assistance from the concierge we were able to plot out a full day of sightseeing. The Sagrada Famillia was 10 minutes away, Las Ramblas was 15 minutes away and Passiege de Gracia was just 2 minutes from our front door. They were even able to book reservations for dinner at a wonderful restaurant ( Boca Grande) for dinner also a 5 minute walk to the hotel.  We followed dinners with a night cap on the rooftop bar, where you will also find a pool and restaurant. The rooms were well appointed and clean and the beds were very comfortable. Lovely chocolates were laid on our pillows after turn down service. But perhaps the best amenity they offer is a mobile hotspot. The hotel provides a phone which you can network into and carry with you allowing constant Wi-Fi and phone access along with the use of the phone to contact the hotel if required. 
I'm sure it is clear we loved Hotel Claris and the staff. We would absolutely stay there again and highly recommend it. ",5,2017,06,02
19,Stylish and beautiful hotel,"There's overwhelmingly good things to say about this hotel. It is an a great location. The staff are wonderfully courteous and helpful and try to provide a fantastic service. The rooftop pool can be busy but is great and the bar service is also first class.

A great touch is that the hotel provides an android handset which you can use for calls and as a data hotspot. This is a fantastic idea and we got great usage from it.

Wifi throughout was reliable and fast.

There's one bad this that could spoil the trip for some. It was an annoyance for us. Noise. It travels a lot - the hotel has no soft dampening fabrics or carpets anywhere. I had an internal facing room so I didn't hear traffic, but the housekeeping staff stored their tolleys and equipment for each floor beside us. The floors are wooden. It seemed that every sound was loud - from people passing on the corridor to the housekeeping staff doing their work. Early (ish)  each morning, we were woken by noise as the housekeeping staff wheeled trolleys out of the room and into corridors, sometimes it was the noise from upstairs that was worse. It's a small thing overall but I know it can annoy some people more than others.",5,2017,06,02
19,A Boutique Hotel as Charming as the City of Barcelona,"I chose Hotel Claris during my recent visit to Barcelona because they are part of Small Luxury Hotels (SLH). I love hotels affiliated with SLH, and I definitely wanted to stay in one in Barcelona. The hotel location is right in the heart of the city and every tourist attraction was easily accessible. I stayed in the hotel with my boyfriend, and as soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the door man with a warm greeting and a smile. When we checked in, the concierge walked us to our room to ensure that everything was to our liking. I made an error with the booking dates, and though I could not obtain a refund for the error date, Alessio, the hotel manager ensured that our room was upgraded from the Executive Room to the Suite Duplex. 

The room was beautiful. The beds were extremely comfortable as well. The bathroom was large, with both a rain shower and a bath tub, and also a double sink. Upstairs, there was a large loft for a living room area. There were also art sculptures and artifacts showcased throughout the loft, adding a unique feature to the room. 

My favorite amenity was a complimentary cellphone that the hotel provided, which gave us 24 hour access to the concierge as well as free wifi throughout Barcelona. We were even able to connect our own cellphones to its wifi network as we explored the city.

This hotel definitely provided amazing service. Anytime we needed assistance with something in the room, someone came right away. Even their turn down service was impressive. Every night when we arrived back to our room, the beds were made, new towels were paced on the racks, we had slippers readily available, the blinds were down, and they left small treats for us to enjoy before bed. 

Overall, our hotel stay and experience exceeded our expectations and we would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona.",5,2017,05,31
19,"Comfortable, stylish, guest-focused","Lovely boutique hotel with interesting room decor and excellent amenities such as the smartphone for use during your stay. Friendly and helpful staff in all areas. Enjoyable rooftop terrace. Only suggested improvement would be to have better lighting in the bathroom, perhaps a light-up makeup mirror. Otherwise well-appointed and very comfortable accommodations. Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,31
19,Beautifully decorated rooms,"We stayed at hotel Claris in May 2017 for a few days. The room was beautifully decorated with what seemed to us to be real art pieces. We felt the hotel lived up to our expectations of an high end hotel. It's also near some high-end shopping streets. While we were annoyed that the room was short of power outlets, we really appreciated that the hotel loaned us a local LTE phone with unlimited tethering to use as we wandered Barcelona. ",4,2017,05,30
19,Good boutique hotel in central barcelona,"Historical building , very attentive and friendly front office, guest relations, very good door man , even the traininee staffs went out of their way to make sure everything is fine. The only small issue i had was i was charged for mini bar when i had not consumed anything 10 hours after check out. I hope they would resolve it.",5,2017,05,29
19,The best boutique hotel in Barcelona,"What ever you are expecting when you arrive at this hotel you will still be surprised .From the moment you step out of your limo it is full of charm , elegance ,Egyptian pieces of art and superb decor. And as you are checking in you are offered a glass of champagne. From the doorman ,dressed in classical top hat and great coat and bright red sun glasses to the charming chambermaids the staff are wonderful, what you would expect at a 5 star hotel .The hotel which is in the centre of the classical part of Barcelona has been fully modernised , the rooms have lovely pieces of art work in every room,marble bathrooms and total elegance . On the 7th floor is one of the restaurants and the swimming pool and a view of Barcelona.On the 1st floor is  superb collection of
Ancient masks, pottery and sculpture.You will also receive complementary tickets to the
Tootenkarmen exhibition.One could go on and on about this hotel , but the answer is just go there !",5,2017,05,27
19,"Best location, excellent service, pricey","I stayed for a week in this centrally located hotel in Barcelonal. The Gothic quarter, La Pedrera, Caso Battlo and Sagrada Familia are all within walking distance. Excellent rooms but the noise from the traffic is disturbing. Didn't notice it for the first two days however - then realised it was the Easter weekend and a holiday. The windows are reinforced with steel shutters but even then the noise seeps through. For light sleepers this can be a nuisance. However the excellent service more than makes up for this. The best part for me was the complimentary filter coffee I was served in the morning in my room!!! I just loved it and would recommend this hotel just for this touch. Loreno at the travel desk and Jimmy in the restaurant deserve special mention. Loreno got us tickets for almost all the important sights (we avoided long queues) and also first row seats for a superb Flamenco dance ! Jimmy remembered our choices at breakfast and it was almost like dining at home. However what disturbed me was the differential room pricing from day to day - something I had not seen elsewhere. It reminded me of the surge pricing of cab aggregators!! There is a complementary entry to an Egyptian museum which is a must-see. The basement recreation of Tut's tomb is excellent.",4,2017,05,24
19,Great Boutique Hotel in central Barcelona,"Just returned from 2 nights in this fantastic city at this lovely boutique hotel. It was a great choice. Centrally located for sightseeing and shopping. Attentive, English speaking service. Rooms are modern and appear newly renovated. We did not dine in the hotel (too many great restaurants elsewhere) but the breakfast which is included is great. Also, the rooftop bar and pool/lounge area is super nice. We went up each night for pre-dinner cocktails. The views and vibe are great. Had a couple of relaxing hours swimming and sunning in the pool. 
In short, would highly recommend staying here. One tip:  Stay on top of online prices since I was able to revise my reservation here twice and benefited from prices that dropped in half from my original reservation. 
One other tip. Do NOT ask the hotel to arrange for airport transportation. There is a huge upcharge and it is simple and easy to ask the doorman to flag down a taxi for 1/3 the cost. Taxis are plentiful in this city and I think there is a subway to the airport. 
This is a marvelous city. Do not miss it! ",5,2017,05,24
19,Excellent Hotel & Service,This Hotel was Amazing the staff were very pleasant and service beyond my expectation always willing to help with restaurant reservation and guided us to great shops and cafes. The room very clean and supplied with everything needed bed was very comfortable. The whole placed smelled awesome.  ,5,2017,05,23
19,Perfection,"I cannot say enough about this hotel, and their management.     We were upgraded to duplex rooms, without asking.    When our rooms weren't ready, they sent us to their lovely roof restaurant for free drinks and tapas, brought our luggage to our rooms, and then came to the restaurant to let us know our rooms were ready.    I've been to many 5 star hotels, but this was THE best.     Conveniently located, walking distance to most everything.    Beautiful art throughout the hotel.",5,2017,05,22
19,Great Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel, centrally located within walking distant of many attractions.  The staff was very welcoming and attentive.  Staying at the Hotel Claris was a great experience and I would highly recommend it.",5,2017,05,21
19,Hotel Claris,What a welcoming hotel.  When we arrived it was in the middle of the afternoon.  They served us some Champaign and then had us go up to the restaurant at the top of the building and gave us appetizers also at no cost.  An amazing welcome. The staff could not do enough for us.  They were all fabulous. The rooms were magnificient,5,2017,05,19
19,Excellent hotel,"Excellent Hotel & excellent service. We stayed for 2 nights here, 1st time in a small hotel. Surprised that every single member of their staff are very committed to our comfort. Very different from the cold cookie cutter precision of the 5 star hotels before & after our stay at Claris. When we checked into another 5 star hotel after the Claris in Madrid, my daughter immediately mentioned that she missed the fluffiness of their towels n the homely feel of Claris. We are particularly impressed with their trainee who was basically doing everything with such ernestness. We felt very much at home.",5,2017,05,19
19,Excellent service for an excellent hotel!,"Together with my girlfriend we spent 3 days in Barcelona and we choose the Hotel Claris for our stay. It is incredible how pampered you feel since the very first moment you enter the hotel. The hotel is framed into an unbeatable location and from the Doorman to the breakfast staff, everyone cares nothing but your satisfaction. Forget about the cold atmosphere of most of the 5 star hotels nowadays, here everyone demonstrated to be truly caring and devoted to our requests. Breakfast is a must try as well as their lovely Rooftop Terrace. A special mention to the reception manager Alessio Rinella which was a great hotel ambassador and gave us a magnificent hotel overview upon our arrival. We will return and stay again with no doubts (hopefully very soon!)",5,2017,05,18
19,A Wonderful Place to Stay!,"We highly recommend this hotel! We stayed one night during our honeymoon and it was by far the best room, location, service and food. Their rooftop restaurant was the best meal we enjoyed out of our 12 day trip. Thank you for a wonderful experience! :) ",5,2017,05,17
19,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I booked 4 nights and ended up paying 7 nights.

I was traveling from Miami to Barcelona. My flight was canceled (due to maintenance) and lost my connecting flight to Barcelona. The airline arranged the next flight, so I can get to Barcelona for my meeting the next day (Miami-Philadelphia-London-Madrid-Barcelona). The Hotel Claris did not mind my emails and calls warning that the airline cancelled my flight and that my arrival will be until the next day and as penalty they charged me all 4 nights for showing the next day... Even though I warned them that i would only be late one day. 

How did i ended up paying 7 nights? Well they suggested meanwhile the airline was arranging my flight, to book 3 nights on another reservation number and that then they would help me to cancel the other 4 night reservation. At the end, they told me they could not cancel the initial 4 night reservation. So, I paid 7 nights for only staying 3 nights. Unbelievable! Bad Customer Service.",2,2017,05,17
19,Hotel Claris in Barcelona is a gem! ,"My favorite city in Europe was Barcelona The city is very beautiful and clean. We loved our stay at the Hotel Claris, the staff was friendly and helpful during our stay and the rooms are very nicely decorated with interesting artifacts and cool photographs. Not to mention the delicious breakfast that included a variety of fresh fruits and berries, delicious cheeses, meats, fresh squeezed orange juice and much more.  ",5,2017,05,17
19,Worst Customer Service EVER,"I booked two rooms in Hotel Claris for 4 nights and because of flight cancellations we were unable to arrive Barcelona till 2 days later. The other party was able to get to Barcelona 1 day earlier. We called Expedia (this is where we booked our rooms) to cancel the original reservation and book the four nights starting the day we would arrive Barcelona. I was on the phone with Expedia at 4 am ET, since the manager in Barcelona did not arrive at work till 10 am Barcelona time, waiting to have the authorization to make such change. The manager said “NO”, even though I would be staying those 4 nights anyway at the same hotel. After talking to Expedia they recommended I booked again and that they would talk to the manager again because most times with most hotels it can be fixed and refunds are granted. IT WAS NOT THE CASE THIS TIME. I ended up paying the original reservation for $600 dollars and the new reservation for little over $500 because the rate had gone down. I even paid 2 nights twice. While I was there in the hotel I tried to speak to manager in 2 occasions and both times I was told he was not on property. I thought maybe I could reason with him.  The hotel is nice and has a good location but I would never go back to a hotel that treats their customers the way I was treated. The best thing about the hotel is the bellboy “Oscar”; my husband and I really enjoyed his suggestions and his corky attitude.
What I want travelers to know through this review is that if you do encounter any problems in your travels don’t expect this hotel to help you out.  They were unwilling to help a customer who obviously had no fault in what had happen.",2,2017,05,15
19,Great hotel in the center of the city,"The hotel is well situated, close to a lot of public transportation as well as sights. It's two blocks from the most famous Gaudi houses and also offers a mini collection of art right in the hotel. Service and reception we're impeccable.",5,2017,05,14
19,Beautiful hotel,"We just returned from 3 nights at the Claris.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff were extremely helpful. We had a problem with the AC but it was fixed as soon as we reported it. Breakfast was a disappointment, not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Cafe Emma down the street on the left, had a great omelette for a quarter of the price and was very good. There was only 1 small trash can in the bathroom, none anywhere else.  The website and hotel book in the lobby, boast ""Sound Proof"" rooms, unfortunately this is not true. Wear the slippers the hotel revises as the dark wood floors discolor your feet. The hotel is very centrally located, a short walk to Casa Batllo and Casa Mila, a little longer to Sagrada Familia. The Hop on Hop Off bus stop in front of Casa Mila is your best way to see all the sights. We bought a 2 day pass for 39.00 Euro each, the blue line goes to all the Gaudi sights and the red line goes all over the city...so worth the money and a five minute walk from the hotel.  We loved Barcelona and enjoyed the hotel.",4,2017,05,12
19,Three nights stay,"Just back from a three night stay in this amazing hotel. We booked an executive room but were given a free upgrade to a junior suite as it was our wedding anniversary. We were also treated to a bottle of cava. The staff at the hotel spoke very good English and were all very helpful and attentive. We were give a welcome drink while checking in. The hotel is situated 15 mins walk from Catalunya Square and La Ramblas. Very easy to get to from the airport. Aerobus takes 30 mins and costs €5.90 each way. Sagrada la Familia only about 15 min walk from hotel. Such a a amazing city, fantastic architecture, so much to,see and do. Definitely will be returning.",5,2017,05,11
19,Girly Trip,"Fabulous hotel, situation in a great position for shopping and all tourist attractions.  If returning to Barcelona would definitely stay here again.  The hotel reception staff were really helpful and friendly.  Once of the nicest hotels I have stopped in.",5,2017,05,06
19,Fabulous luxury hotel,"My husband and I had a long weekend in Barcelona and were delighted with this hotel. We were greeted on arrival with a glass of cava and the news we had been upgraded to a suite. The room itself was fabulous: huge space and tasteful decor, with some unusual art pieces. 

The hotel is well located, within walking distance of most attractions. A real highlight is the rooftop bar, which was a great sun trap for some late afternoon relaxation. Prices are very reasonable too. 

Breakfast was lovely, with a choice of cold buffet and hot a la carte options. 

The thing that really stood out was the exceptional service, from everyone in the hotel. Really lovely, friendly people, always ready to help. 

Throughly recommended.",5,2017,05,03
19,"Fabulous hotel, must be one of the best in Barcelona - and beyond!","I just returned from a trip to Spain that ended in Barcelona, where I stayed 5 nights at the Claris Hotel and just wish I were still there.  Fabulous location, exquisite remodel of an over 100 year old beautiful building, antiques abound and include a collection of old Mayan sculptures, rooms all fabulous, spotless, extraordinarily comfortable, all the amenities and then some, great roof terrace where you can relax after a long day sight-seeing, enjoy a drink and/or dinner and fabulous personnel, who are eager to help with anything you may need - including planning your day!  I cannot imagine anyone who would not LOVE their stay at the Claris.",5,2017,05,02
19,Family City Trip to Barcelona,"Our family city trip took us this year to Barcelona - we've spent 5 nights at the wonderful Hotel Claris. The perfect place for us in the heart of the city. We've booked a junior suite and definitely loved our room and the stylish interior. The only thing which we didn't like too much: there was hardly any daylight as the room was facing the courtyard. However, we will be back again at the Claris, next time in a room with a view...",4,2017,05,02
19,Great hotel in Barcelona,"Very nice spot.  Rooms were Comfortable.  the staff was great.  Great location, blocks away from a high end shopping district.  Beds where comfortable.  Nice fluffy pillows. Windows have hurricane shutters on them so you can make the room completely black for your enjoyment of a good nights sleep.  

Cons.  Its small but your in the middle of the city, all hotel rooms are small.  Considering the space they use it quite efficiently.",5,2017,05,02
19,Small Boutique Hotel in the Heart of the City,"The Hotel Claris is a very nice little place to base a stay in Barcelona.  The property in general is up-scale, and the owner is apparently a collector of art and pre-Columbian artifacts which adorn the rooms.  The location of the hotel could not be better, situated a block away from the Passeig de Gracia, with lots of restaurants, up-scale shops and tourist attractions within a few minutes walk.  The service is extremely friendly, although it helps to speak Spanish as the staff at the front desk aren't necessarily fluent in English.  The rooms, while reasonably well-appointed are small, but (my one real complaint) the beds are as hard as a rock.  In spite of that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",4,2017,05,01
19,A few days in Bsrcelona,Arriving at our hotel we were greeted by very friendly and extremely helpful staff. The glass of bubbly while checking in was a lovely touch. Our room was great and our three nights in an excellent location made our stay in Barcelona one of the best city breaks you could hope for. Just arrange for sunshine rather than rain and it would have been ideal!,5,2017,05,01
19,Amazing rooftop,"Great location, next to the Passeig de Gracia. Service from reception was top. Nice clean rooms. I think housekeeping came twice a day. But the best thing about the hotel is the rooftop with a nice swimmingpool, bar and a great view of the city.",5,2017,04,29
19,Highly recommended,"We stayed at this hotel from 21 to 25 April 2017, with two couples of friends. Upon arrival we were offered a welcome coctail. We had booked 3 executive double rooms and upon arrival at the Hotel we received an upgrade: 
3 Executive rooms on 2 levels. Very central location. Clean hotel. Hospitality of all staff. Highly recommended",5,2017,04,26
19,City break,We came to Barcelona for an extended weekend my husband and myself.  Upon arrival was greated at the door by a porter who quickly took out cases and wheeled them into reception. We were slightly early to check in but out room was ready so we were escorted up to our room by another consiage who showed us how to work everything.  The room was lovely and a Luxury.  We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we mainly went sight seeing. We would have given 5 star up until leaving.  Our flights were not until 10pm so we didn't need to leave early.  We went out for a walk and came back and asked if we could freshen up I.e shower etc. We were shown to the toilets and ended up using the disabled toilet to wash we had to ask for towels also.  We found this a little disappointing after such a lovely stay.  I have stayed in much lower star accommodation and been offered a shower room never a toilet before.  Sorry hotel Claris this let you down slightly.,4,2017,04,25
19,Design First,"Mixed feelings about hotel but overall positive.  Common areas and rooms are beautiful to look at.  All rooms individually decorated  - our junior suite was Bali (or other Eastern) inspired.  Beautiful to look at but not always very practical.   Night stands next to bed were too tiny to be useful.  Double sinks in the bathroom were designed in such a way to leave almost no space to leave your own toiletries around.   Toilet paper holder jutted at a gorgeous angle ... and cut the unwary (I had three separate run-ins with it - going to the bathroom shouldn't be that dangerous).  No place to plug in coffee tray without lots of work.  
Hotel staff all very friendly and accommodating (with exception of concierge, who we found a bit off putting and less than fully responsive).  Great location, art gallery on the first floor well worth touring.",4,2017,04,24
19,DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I was treated extremely well in this hotel. Welcome wines and chocolates, as well as cake and champagne on my birthday. 
Bed was extremely comfy and I was sound asleep as soon as I lie down except on Saturday night. if your room is facing the road, you need to put your ear plugs. Other than that I cant fault this hotel. Wait, I did not find any coffee or tea bags in the room, not that I need it but it would be nice to have them. You get free sparkling wines in the lobby up to 10 pm and the breakfast is delicious. Internet was quite fast and able to connect to multiple devices without issue.
we have some antique artefact in the room, I was so scared to ruin them. seriously.",5,2017,04,18
19,Hotel with a difference!,"We were initially upgraded to a junior suite but preferred our regular room which although smaller, had views out onto the street. Noise was not a problem. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated - does not feel like a hotel room at all! The position of the hotel is perfect - one street back from Passeig de Gracia and an easy walk to Placa de Catalunya, La Rambla and metro station. Friendly, helpful staff. The hotel smells beautiful - not overwhelmingly so. Highly recommended.",5,2017,04,16
19,Lovely hotel,Faultless service. Very friendly staff and helpful. Well located to stroll to most of the top 10 attractions.  High spec rooms with relaxing ambience and stylish decor. Roof top pool small but adequate. Terrace restaurant was limited menu and expensive.,4,2017,04,16
19,The best in Barcelona,"Great location
Clean and comfortable with a unique interior design!
Fantastic customer service, 
Hotel places in a great location,only 20min from Airport,walking distance to passeig de Garcia and underground link.
Highly recommend it.",5,2017,04,14
19,best stay at this hotel,"From start to finish the service / room was incredible. We stayed in the duplex suite with the four poster bed and upstairs and it was one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The customer service was incredible and from the door our suitcases were taken and put in our room. I couldn't fault this hotel as it is in a perfect location and even has two restaurants within the actual hotel. 
I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family and I would definitely stay again. 
5* from me. ",5,2017,04,12
19,Working in Barcelona,"The Claris Hotel has very nice people, who make you feel at home. We had a business meeting and all support was available. The food during the meeting and the breakfasts were lovely. The people make the difference.",4,2017,04,10
19,Absolutely perfect!,"The location for the hotel is perfect to my opinion, just a black away from Paseo de Gracia, beautiful street with all the high end brands and Gaudi´s La Pedrera and about a 10 minute walk from Plaza Cataluña and Las Ramblas. The hotel is quite modern and decorated with an impeccable taste, each of the rooms holds a piece of the hotel´s art collection, the rooms are quite comfortable and good sized and have many nice amenities such a Nespresso machine with daily free capsules and a courtesy daily bottle of water. The lobby always has water, orange juice and cava (sparkling wine) for guests take. Another great amenity is that each room has a personal cel phone that you can take along with you to make calls to the hotel and other guests´cel phones, as well as local calls, but most important, it has free wifi and personal hotspot for you to use whenever while at Barcelona, that is huge these days! The staff was always very nice and happy to help you with whatever reservation or suggestion you needed. The breakfast buffet is very complete although a bit expensive if not included in your rate. 
If I were to go back to Barcelona, I would definitely go back to Claris. (We also stayed at Urban in Madrid, hotel from the same company and loved it as well!)",5,2017,04,08
19,Top notch hotel,I stayed at the Hotel Claris for 4 nights and couldn't have been happier.  The staff were all very helpful and genuine.  The breakfast was delicious as well.  The location is ideal too.  I would definitely go back to this hotel on a future trip to Barcelona.,5,2017,04,07
19,Short trip in Barcelona with perfect breakfast,"We really loved the location of Claris hotel. The most pleasant, helpful, and happy staff I've experienced, especially ""Andrea"" at breakfast. She focused on making sure you feel like you are the most important person there. Furthermore, the phone with shareable wifi is perfect! ",5,2017,04,06
19,The best place to say in Barcelona,"The location of the hotel is ideal. Close walking to everything one would want to see in Barcelona. The hotel is exquisite! The room is great sized and absolutely beautiful. The beds are super soft and comfy. The hotel is sparkling clean. The staff is super helpful and offered excellent dining recommendations. The view from the rooftop bar is stunning. I booked this room before we departed on a cruise. It was the best decision I made on my trip. I booked somewhere else for our return night, just to stay in a different area, and boy did I regret it. Hotel Claris is one on the nicest hotels I have stayed in. This was my first trip to Barcelona and Europe in general. They offered us a Cava on our way in just to kick off our trip right. The front desk and bell helped up with getting to the boat, and made sure we felt safe and comfortable. I would give 10 stars if I could",5,2017,04,04
19,Great service from the time we walked in the door.,Last minute trip to Barcelona so last minute reservation needed. Hadn't tried the Claris before - so glad we did. From the front desk onwards the service was impeccable! Couldn't fault the staff. Room was good and the breakfast was excellent.,5,2017,04,03
19,Rooms,Rooms too small bathrooms too small no natural light too claustrophobic.  Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast not value for money plates too small.  Lift tiny felt uncomfortable in it. Shower cubicle so small impossible to move around. ,2,2017,04,03
19,Barcelona Trip,"Great Hotel, free hot spot is the best thing a hotel can offer for out of towners especially international visitors. The hotel has complimentary cava all day and water. The door men were the best in assistance with transportation and directions. ",5,2017,04,02
19,Lovely visit but noisy neighbors ,The room was lovely but the walls were so thin that I could hear all the hallway noise as well as my neighbors talking. It was hard to sleep at night.  Breakfast was delicious and hotel staff was great. I would have liked to see more food options at the bar if you need to grab a quick snack. ,4,2017,03,31
19,Good Hotel but needs some refinement,"We stayed in the hotel upon a recommendation from a friend and it was very good. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are clean and have all the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel. The water feature and semi courtyard were impressive, with water trickling over the stairs to the spa below.

Checking in was easy and the glass of cava was a nice touch. The hotel smelt amazing, they had incense burning on each floor which smelt wonderful. 

The rooms are small but are very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable.

The rooftop terrace is very nice but a little cold at this time of year. They could really do with a more permanent structure with bi folding doors and not just a posh tent. I see why it's a tent so that you can open the sides in summer but bi folding doors would make it a pleasant place to sit all year round as this is probably the main restaurant as Mr Kow in the lobby is a dim sum restaurant. They could have had a more extensive cocktail list (they could make anything you ask for but sometimes it's nice to see a few additional items above the ""classics"". We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on food.

The breakfast is expensive at 23euros per person but was nice enough. We only had it the first day and then ate at cafes in the city for the rest of the week. The food is just as good but a lot cheaper. 

The only issue I had with the hotel was that we went for a meal on the Friday night (to Abac restaurant) and had to hail a taxi. The doorman/ concierge that night was not very helpful. He got us a taxi but on the other side of the road and it was pouring with rain. So I had to sprint across the road to get the taxi whilst my partner got stuck on the other side in the rain for a good couple of minutes as she was in heels and didn't make the lights. The hotel has loads of umbrellas (I saw them in the luggage storage room when we were collecting our bags on the last day) but no one offered us one to borrow for the evening, so we got soaked going to Abac, which wasn't the best start to that evening. When we left for the airport on the last day, the concierge had no issue hailing a taxi to the front door so I don't know what the issue was on the Friday evening. We just felt a bit frustrated that night sitting in wet clothes in a Michelin star restaurant. 

Overall a good hotel in a great location but a couple of things let it down for us. I would recommend it though. ",4,2017,03,28
19,"Luxurious, ideal place to establish camp while seeing Barcelona","My wife and I recently spent three nights at the Hotel Claris, and we were impressed with each component of the hotel experience. The rooms are large, especially for a boutique hotel. They are comfortable, well kept, and gave good climate control units. The entire property is beautifully maintained, and the rooftop terrace and pool are an added benefit for a hotel in the heart of the city. Breakfasts are good, and the staff were very responsive. The hotel's decor certainly is unique, and the artifacts in every room and the Egyptian museum next door are worth exploring. Additionally, the Claris is 1.5 blocks away from the bustling Passeig de Gracia, so this perfect location allows for easy access to all of Barcelona. It also is in walking distance to La Sagrada Familia. Finally, at the time of writing this review, each room is provided with a complimentary smartphone with 4g internet and free calling to Spain, the US, Canada, and many other countries in Europe (large replacement fee if lost of damaged during your stay). Having internet on the go made it even easier to explore Barcelona.

One minor drawback that did not detract significantly from my stay. The bathtub is small, so the shower sprays onto the floor. This is probably more of an inconvenience for housekeeping than for the guests.",5,2017,03,26
19,Perfect hotel,"Luxury hotel in the center from Barcelona, strategically located at a walking distance from the Gothic quarter as well as from Paseo de Gracia with its magnificent buildings design by Gaudi. Rooms and public areas really comfortable. Antiquities expositions within the hotel. Breakfast service really good. One will not be disappointed.",5,2017,03,24
19,WOW!,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we returned yesterday (Sunday 19th). This hotel was so good i would definitely recommend it. We were greeted with a welcome drink on arrival and had a choice of what we wanted. Our room was ready early so we could go straight there before heading into Barcelona. The staff surprised me with a complimentary gift for my birthday which was an added bonus. Breakfast was great but the hot food service was very slow, i think this was because of a good of people who all went to breakfast at the same time. I will definitely return to Barcelona and will definitley stay at Hotel Claris again. Make sure you have a drink on the roof terrace - it is wonderful! Thank you to the staff for making it such a special weekend!",5,2017,03,20
19,Now this is 5 star!,"We felt truly spoiled by the staff, the location and the quality of the food. The room was amazing and completely unique.
Walking distance to so many places. Would highly recommend staying here. The view of the mountains from the terrace is beautiful.",5,2017,03,19
19,Fantastic stay,"Travel for business weekly across Europe.
The Hotel Claris was such a pleasure. Amazing staff. Beautiful, trendy hotel with a Mayan flair. The hotel has a museum and each room also has an artifact. 

There is an incense smell throughout the hotel that continues the Mayan theme.

One of the best hotel breakfasts with wide selection of fresh fruits, fresh pastries, as well as a variety of Catalan sausages.",5,2017,03,17
19,Visiting daughter studying abroad,"Our stay in Barcelona was magnificent ! The hotel Claris is classy and a 5 star experience. Staff is helpful- had a spa treatment facial - lovely. Convenient, friendly relaxing. Highly recommend. Don't overpack. Lots to see and shop. Wear comfortable shoes.",5,2017,03,16
19,Perfect stay,"Excellent welcome, great staff, very nice room, I was updated in a junior suite, which was perfect for me. I was in a Business trip (with jetlag) and the suite was perfect to me to relax enough for one night.",5,2017,03,16
19,everything was perfect!!,"the appartament was in a good location in just a 4 min walk from the main street of Barcelona!the customer service was perfect .We came very late around 2 ocklock in the night because of the our flight delate,they was very helpful and very king with us.",5,2017,03,13
19,Best 5 star hotel in a long time!,"We choose the Claris for our last stay in Barcelona, it was not our first time in the city and we have been advices by some friends about this hotel. I must admit it was one of the best choice we have ever made in terms of 5 star hotels. Amazing staff with a great eye for caring every request, wonderful breakfast (forget about the never ending lines, here is all about luxury and food quality) and a unique room furnished with unique pieces of art collection. Make sure to visit the private museum on the first floor and the rooftop terrace for some sunny view over Barcelona! A special mention to the front desk manager alessio which was extremelly welcoming and fernanda at the reception who cared about every single request. We already know where to stay for our next visit in town!",5,2017,03,12
19,A perfect stay!,"We stayed there for 6 nights, It was our honeymoon! A honeymoon like no other! Visiting museums, shopping and eating in good restaurants.The Hotel designs itself is unique. Everything is luxurious! From the lobby they served you drinks when you arrived and The front desk Réceptionnistes are all friendly! I have never been pampered in a hotel before even if we choose an expensive hotel but here, It all worth it! Thanks to the management for the champagne they offered to us because it's our honeymoon. We will definitely coming back! See you soon!",5,2017,03,12
19,A wonderful Stay!!,"I stayed in Hotel Claris for 3 nights and it was absolutely gorgeous. The Hotel is central not far from the Placa Catalunya and the shops streets. The reception team is professional and will always be willing to help you (they know some good places around, do not hesitate to ask for the knowledges!).
The breakfast is a plus. You have a lavish breakfast buffet plus some a la carte dishes included. 
The rooftop terrace is great to enjoy the sun, it was a pity that we couldn't enjoy the swimming pool though. 
We didn't try the restaurant but if the quality is equivalent to the hotel standard, I will recommend it too.
To conclude, I loved my stay there, and I have only one thing in mind, to plan my next trip to Barcelona and to the Claris Hotel.",5,2017,03,10
19,Nice hotel,"A lovely hotel in a good location.  The room was lovely and although the reception staff were helpful and friendly, the waiter taking the orders for hot food at breakfast was not.  He was very slow in coming over even when we asked if we could order which was a shame as everything else about the hotel was great.",4,2017,03,09
19,Nice hotel ,"I visited Barcelona for few days business trip and chosen to stay at Claris hotel...

It's a nice and comfortable place to stay at, very clean place and room service and close to main shopping street and Metro station.

",5,2017,03,01
19,Excellent hotel in good location,"This hotel is well sited just off the Pas. de Gracia, very good rooms, excellent breakfast (did not have opportunity to try dinner) and good attentive employees. Will definitely stay again next time in Barcelona.",4,2017,03,01
19,Outstanding value for Barcelona,"Skip the usual hotel chains.  Hotel Claris is a far better choice for the same price.  I have stayed at hotels across the city and this place is the best I have come across.  Conveniently located to the best shopping and restaurants in Barcelona.  Quick access to main metro lines, Sagrada Familia or a walk to Las Ramblas.  Rooms are well appointed with modern design.  You won't have any regrets.",5,2017,02,27
19,great weekend,"The room was beautiful and the service great.
Only the room service, forgot one time the number of my room and I had to wait for more than 1 hour.
But the rest was excellent.
Everyone was really kind and professional.",5,2017,02,27
19,Wonderful family winter break experience,"I spent three days with my teenagers children and we all liked Hotel Claris. We stayed in a very nice suite. 
The hotel's location is perfect for Paseo de Gratia - Gaudi' Casa Batlo' and La Pedrera are just a short walk. 
Interesting Maya art collection in the hotel. 
Staff very professional and helpful - we found a fantastic guide who toured us around Barcellona for two days. 
Excellent restaurant- beautiful location on the roof- 
Breakfast good - it's expensive but they make anything you want a la carte. 
I would be happily back in this hotel. ",5,2017,02,27
19,AMAZING! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for 3 nights to celebrate his birthday. We had the best time ever in Barcelona. The service is beyond my expectation! We will definitely return again soon. 

I highly recommended booking this accommodation directly from the hotel official website as it gives you the options to add on breakfast, massage, transfers etc 

Also try booking the duplex suite, is SOOO Lovely! My fav room decor. ",5,2017,02,22
19,Excellent,"Amazing service, good design, good comfort, value for money. Amazing location, anything you need from a hotel,So happy to choose Claris. Enjoyed the hotel so much that didn't want to go out for sightseeing. Thank you to all hotel management ",5,2017,02,22
19,Wonderful stay at Hotel Claris,"My husband and I had a 4 night stay at Hotel Claris and totally enjoyed it.  The location in Barcelona was excellent, close to high end shopping, great restaurants and close by metro stops.  We walked most days for meals and appreciated the high end service at the hotel. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. We enjoyed the glass of cava at the reception area after each of our busy sight seeing days.  We want to say thank you to Tony, the restaurant manager who found us a table and provided fantastic service even though we did not have a dinner reservation.  We would absolutely stay at Hotel Claris for ant future trip to Barcelona. 

",5,2017,02,22
19,Fabulous hotel in an amazing coty,"Our first visit to Barcelona, and we were so lucky to stay in such a fantastic hotel.
From being greeted with an ice cold glass of Cava, to having our room upgraded, our stay was perfect. The room was fabulous, comfy beds, fab bathroom & beautiful decor. 
All the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us. 
The hotel is in an ideal location to explore Barcelona, and close to some amazing bars and restaurants.
We will definitely be back, a first class hotel.
",5,2017,02,15
19,Great experience,"The hotel itself is very unique and extraordinary. Have never been to any similar hotel. Located in an old palace building it keeps the cozy, pleasant atomsphere. The staff is professional, very helpful and ready to support the guests whatever they might need.
My room was very spacious, nicely arranged, with all needed facilities. Bed was very comfortable. Conference room is big, with great space for the break/snacks.
Breakfast offered a wide choice of buffet as well as dishes to be ordered from the menu.
The hotel made a great impression on me and there is nothing I could complain about.",5,2017,02,15
19,Lovely stay,Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for city break and loved the hotel. The staff were very smart and genuinely happy to help. Our room was stunning and had a lovely view. I would recommend this hotel to couples but probably not suited to families. ,5,2017,02,14
19,Great staff and facilities,"Great position in Barcelona, short walk to tthe main transport station, however off the main road. Room a bit quirky, lovely and clean, very comfortable and good to have 'different' however tasteful decorations. Loved the jaccuzzi.
Extras were very welcome. AC very quiet. Double glazing blocks out most of the traffic noise
Staff were very friendly and helpful",5,2017,02,14
19,Lovely...but,"A beautiful hotel one block off the Main Street which made the location perfect.  Our room, a small suite which consisted of a small sitting room, bedroom and modern bathroom was the space that  we needed.  It was an eclectic mix of antiques and ultra modern. I needed a lesson on using the phone and should have got one on figuring out the bathtub. At first I thought that we were given an inferior room because we looked out on a minimalist courtyard.  However, after hearing all the traffic and motorcycles in the night, it offered a very quiet retreat for the night. The breakfast was a great start for our busy day. The staff was wonderful (except for one of the front desk associates...Gentleman with the beard...a bit snooty. Doorman has the best smile in the world. Loved our visit, but had a problem with our bill. Our travel agent stepped in and ended up taking care of it. I would absolutely recommend the Claris and just caution you to double check your bill. ",4,2017,02,14
19,Claris o'clock,"From check in to checkout . Great service .
Upgraded to a duplex suite- modern, great bathroom  we loved it!

Restaurant quite expensive, but breakfast was fantastic

Would def stay here if I visited bercelona again",5,2017,02,13
19,**Simply outstanding**,"I recently visited Barcelona and was recommended the Claris Hotel by a friend. I must say I was not disappointed! It was truly FANTASTIC! 
The room was spacious and beautiful - there are even pieces of art that come from the owner's collection in each room! The location is great, there are plenty of restaurants and bars only a few steps away from the hotel. Personally, I simply did not want to leave the hotel! Highlight of the morning: the comfort of the bed! Second highlight of the morning: the bathroom amenities! Third highlight: the delicious breakfast! Not to forget the wonderful staff who greets you by name.
The day goes on, you go for a stroll and then you pop up to the roof terrace for an afternoon tea or a cocktail (or a swim in the summer time!) with the sun shining and a beautiful view! Divine!
We also ate at the hotel restaurant Mr Kao which was perfect! And then highlight of the evening: comfort of the bed!! Ready to start all over again!",5,2017,02,13
19,"Confortable hotel, but not 5*","It's a very good hotel, but for us , it's a 4*, not luxury, but correct. The staff is very good, there is a terrace , in the summer is not confortable because the swimming pool is too small. We were there with our families, the other couple was with their child and for him was not interesting. The location is good, but I prefer a little bit closer to plaza Cataluña .",4,2017,02,13
19,A dream,i stayed at the Hotel with a friend for two nights. We had a lovely split level Suite that was a dream come true. The hotel is wonderful: from the doorman to reception (where we received a lovely welcome drink) to our amazing room. We were lucky enough to enjoy some sunshine on their AMAZING roof top Terrace! The Breakfast was truly amazing and we were looked after by an amazing gentleman who knew our order by heart! Hotel Claris is definitely worth a stop! It is located amazing in the heart of Barcelona and very easy to get to! The staff is amazing and make you fell welcome and home. I will definitely return!,5,2017,02,11
19,Not as expected!,"I was a bit disappointed by Hotel Claris. In the pictures it looked much better than it did in real life. My room was much smaller with less modern interior than the pics. 

The lobby was crowded and one of the guys that was trying to carry my bag looked like a angry bad guy from a action movie. Not a polite guy! 

The elevators and corridors gave me the feeling that i was in a business hotel. 

Positive things was the front desk staff, bellboys and room service late night! 

My feeling when i left was that this was a hotel with a lot of potential that doesn't being used.",3,2017,02,09
19,Outstanding hotel,The staff at the Claris made our stay excellent. Glass of prosecco on arrival was the start. Reception staff and breakfast staff could not do enough for you. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The loocation was very good too.,5,2017,02,08
19,"Stunning, Stunning, Stunning","By the nature of my life I have seen a few hotels and I absolutely loved this hotel, it is the antithesis of the usual stamped out brand and I mean that in a good way.
The rooms have original art and all have a story to tell. The decor is beautiful and very good taste. 
This hotel is obviously someones passion and the love heaped on it shines out like a bright star.
The service is first rate and the staff are really friendly and helpful.
Claris is located in the 'Knightsbridge' of Barcelona and it is within walking distance of great restaurants and tapas bars. 
Barcelona is a magical city and The Claris is a magical hotel I couldn't rate it more highly.
Well done Claris x",5,2017,02,03
19,Feels like home.,"I stayed at this hotel twice in one month. First with my family for the new year holidays for five nights; our two rooms were upgraded from Junior Suite to their beautiful Duplex! Secondly, I returned solo a month later prior to flying back for two nights; gifted with booking rate discount and another generous room upgrade. I can't recommend this hotel enough. From location, to room comfort and customer service, nothing was short of excellent. ",5,2017,02,02
19,"Nice hotel, rooftop pool and bar","Very nice hotel, we were offered a glass of cava upon arrival which was a great start! We were then upgraded to a suite which was brilliant! The suite was Egyptian themed, it was a little dark but nice. There was a living room with sofa and a small table with chairs. The bedroom itself was small but it was fine. Lovely white company toiletries. The rooftop pool was a nice size but there isn't much space around it and people tended to get a spot and stay there which was annoying. One afternoon we managed to get a spot on a sofa and we sat there for a good few hours drinking cava chatting. It was very relaxing. One night we went up to the bar at like 11pm and it was very busy with non hotel guests but as we were staying there we were allowed to have a seat at one of the tables. Location was good too, very close to the metro stop for Gaudi's house. Overall we had a great time in Barcelona. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,28
19,"Staff were great, hotel central, service fine","The location for me was key when chosing this hotel and it didn't disappoint - close enough to everything to walk to but not in the thick of the hustle and bustle. The staff were really welcoming and professional and the hotel itself was well kept and clean. 
More business than romantic, though, I would say
Don't forget the city tax when you leave!",4,2017,01,25
19,Best hotel stayed in for years,"Great staff, fantastic room, lovely food. Will definitely go back. Hotel in great location for Barcelona restaurants. Probably the only way to better our stay would be to go in summer and enjoy the pool.",5,2017,01,17
19,Unbeatable ,"This is a place where you would never want to leave. The moment we arrived the amazing staff at the Claris meant we never touched our bags till they got to our room. The reception staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and were able to recommend the best way to get back to the hotel after a game at Camp Nou. The rooms are beautiful and modern and are stocked with all the amenities you need to enjoy your stay. The beds are some of the comfiest i have slept in. Finally the breakfast is great value if you decide to have it everyday it is only 16 euros a day. The food is unbelievable with a great variety of fresh fruits and berries to hams and cheeses. The price also includes any items on their a la carte menu too! The hotel is situated a mere 100m from the heart of Passeig de Gracia - 2/3 mins to casa batllo and 5 minutes to la pedrera. 
This is the place to stay when I'm Barcelona!",5,2017,01,12
19,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here in November prior to joining a cruise. This was our second visit and it was better than the first. We booked through Small Luxury Hotels and were given an upgrade on arrival as we had hoped for, but to our delight we were given one of the split level suites.

The staff here are both friendly and very informative, obtaining taxis is easy, getting a dinner reservation is no trouble.

We still love the roof top bar and the restaurant, and although it was chilly the heaters made the roof top a great place to sit late at night with a drink and a great view.

The breakfast area has been completely remodelled since our first visit and its now a much more welcoming area, the buffet breakfast is still good.

We will definitely stay again when we next visit Barcelona.",5,2017,01,11
19,A perfection! Art deco & Luxury!,"Oh, wow! This hotel is pure bliss! The interior of our suite was exquisite and pure luxury. Great attention on details.. One of the best luxury hotels we have had the pleasure to stay at! The staff needs a compliment, as well- polite, friendly, not pushy & reserved. P.s. I fell in love with the baroque pink velvet sofa and the feather light installations in the bedroom! Don't think twice about booking a suit here - Treat yourself & enjoy!",5,2017,01,11
19,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for a city break in early January, the service was impeccable and the room was faultless!

You are made to feel very welcome and the staff couldn't do enough for you. The hotel itself was spotless and very classy. Location-wise it was perfect, just a couple of minutes walk from Casa  Batlló.",5,2017,01,09
19,Real class in the prestige end of Barcelona,We had a great stay in the Claris including four nights in one of the duplex mini suites.  The facilities were first class and the service outstanding.  The reception team bent over backwards to make sure that we had the room we wanted and all the staff were extremely welcoming.,5,2017,01,08
19,"Gorgeous room, great location, superb staff",A true 5-star experience from our welcome glass of cava to the upgrade at checkin to the waiting bottle of wine in our room to late checkout. Maybe because we were here off season but this was a great value! Superb front desk. And the location could not be better. Would definitely stay here again!,5,2017,01,07
19,"Claris Hotel, brilliant location","Beautiful hotel, helpful staff at front desk and in the restaurants. A lovely helpful member of staff who told us about attractions, places to visit and the best way to see the city.
Clean and spacious rooms.",5,2017,01,06
19,Stunning,"Beautiful hotel, in the center of Barcelona. Friendly and helpful staff, even if you don't tip! 
Clean, and relaxing. 
We had a free up grade thank you. The Bathroom and bedroom had lovely views of the other beautiful buildings. 

The restaurant on the roof looked lovely but we did not eat here. 

Breakfast however was dainty and delicious. 

The Egyptian collection is amazing, do take time out to see it. ",5,2017,01,04
19,I love this hotel,"The first time I stayed at the Hotel Claris was in January of 2011.  I had booked a regular room and upon checkin was upgraded *for no additional charge* to a suite.  The room was beautiful and I was astonished by the service.  I love the look of the hotel and my room on that first stay was very nice.  I had a big bed in the bed room and then a separate sitting room with TV and couch.  

When my boyfriend and I were going to Barcelona to take a Mediterranean cruise several years later I made sure that we got to the city a few days early to stay again at the Hotel Claris and to show off the beautiful city of Barcelona to my significant other.  That time I booked a duplex suite and again I was incredibly impressed.  The room was magnificent! two levels which was great.  Downstairs was the sitting area and an eating area with refrigerator etc.  This was the PERFECT place to enjoy some cocktails before going out to enjoy the night life.  We also had some glass doors which led to a little private courtyard!  It was a real surprise.  I took two of the chairs out to the little courtyard to sit and enjoy drinks with my BF and left the doors open for most of the time we were in the room.  Another thing which I really liked was the shower. (obviously this is not for everyone i.e. families, people traveling with friends, etc.) the shower in our room completely see through glass! We really enjoyed this room and it set the stage excellently for our romantic cruise.

I have been to the Hotel Claris several times now and every time I am impressed. This is the only hotel I will stay In in Barcelona.  

I don't really know much about art, but the rooms are well decorated and have unique art in them.  Im not sure if this is still a thing but the hotel used to be associated with a nearby museum which were owned by the same company.  I went to the museum and it was enjoyable if not as spectacular as the hotel.",5,2017,01,04
19,Lovely city centre hotel,"On arrival at the Hotel Claris we were offered a glass of cava or water which was a nice touch. Check in was good with all of the amenities explained. Breakfast was extra at €23 but if taken for the duration of our stay a discount was given with breakfast being €16. We didn't take up this offer. We were accompanied to our room which was on the 6th floor. We had booked a junior suite. The room was great and a bed settee was available for our 15 year old daughter. Pool and terrace available on the roof which was lovely, although we didn't spend much time there with it being December. We did eat in the rooftop restaurant and were very surprised at the standard of food - fantastic! Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel. Really friendly staff and definitely 5 star.",5,2017,01,02
19,Great 5-star hotel experience,"Perfectly located in the Eixample with many restaurants around and near Paséig de Gracia. All the staff cared for each of our needs, including driving our car in the parking just besides the hotel. Crazy price found on momondo. We will return.",5,2016,12,31
19,"Good service, good location - great decor","Spent three nights at Claris and found the staff to be really friendly and helpful. The location is perfect if you're not there for the beach but to see the city and enjoy great food. Was upgraded to a junior suite in split levels with comfortable furniture and beautiful art pieces. Enjoyed the all white, all cotton covers on the bed because I prefer a hotelbed without the kind of throw pillows and covers that don't get cleaned after every visit. Big spacious bathroom. Small but efficient gym. Breakfast good. Would have appreciated more than one bottle of free mineralwater in the room - it's five star after all...",4,2016,12,28
19,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed just after Christmas for a couple of nights break.  Arrived early but by the time we had a glass of champagne our room was ready.  Staff are very friendly and seems most fell off the ""pretty tree"" alway nice first thing in the morning.  Rooms are very nice and even the smallest superior room is plenty large enough for 2.  Odd there is no tea and coffee in the room, however they do deliver this to your room in the morning, if you complete the door card.  My only gripe would be breakfast, everything except the eggs is a little cold and it's very expensive for what it is! It's no Hilton breakfast.  On the whole a fabulous hotel and I will definitely be back. Loved the art all over the place and great cocktails on the pool roof terrace.",5,2016,12,27
19,Excellent. Just excellent.,"We arrived at the Hotel and the doorman helpfully opened up the taxi doors and took our bags in, then we received champagne or orange juice/water. The reception staff were all friendly and informed us that we could have breakfast for 16€ if we had it every day. If u can afford it, this is a good idea as not only is it a buffet but it has a included A La Carte menu which is divine. The hotel boasts two restaurants- a Western style rooftop fine dining restaurant and a Chinese fusion place on the ground floor. The service at the hotel is outstanding- every day the doorman would give us a high-five or handshake, the staff are just so darn friendly and helpful. They really do go out of their way to give you a better experience. As a guest of the hotel u gain free access to the Egyptian museum across the road which takes about 2 hours to complete. It offers a wide range of artefacts thousands of years old. On the first floor of the hotel there is a private Mayan artefact collection too- this takes roughly 15 minutes. If you're planning on staying on the first floor ask to be located on the opposite side to the Mayan exhibit as you might find the foot traffic irritating. The rooms were very luxurious and ours came with a bath that had some jets similar to a spa! The location was excellent, the hotel is situated right in the heart of the suburb of Eixample- the area housing most of the tourist attractions. Overall our experience was very good and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.
Give me a helpful vote!",5,2016,12,23
19,Fantastic Hotel - great service,"Beautiful Room, amazing service.  All staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful. Great location also.  Also fabulous roof top terrace - lovely for a glass or two of Cava!
I came here on business but would not hesitate to come back here on a personal visit.",5,2016,12,12
19,Beautiful rooms!,"The hotel is lovely! The staff is exceptional and helpful beyond expectations. The breakfast was AMAZING! Even vegan options! Detox juices and lovely salads. The roof top outdoor space is beautiful, the drinks are ok...the indoor bar area is ehh...I would still stay again!! :) ",5,2016,12,08
19,Good central location!,"Stayed in this stylish hotel in March 2016. Beautiful and modern with stylish rooms. We stayed in a duplex with a separate upstairs lounge area which was stunning. However, a downside was that there barely any hanging space for clothes and we ended up living out of our suitcases for our stay, not ideal! Also the bedside tables were just that, small tables with no drawer space which was much needed.
Breakfast was fab although for some of our stay there was a 'conference' taking place so half the dining room was separated making it much smaller. Hotel located very centrally and we were able to walk to most places. Staff were good and on hand to office advice when needed. Little touches make it special. Toiletries in the bathroom were good quality and replaced daily and one evening when it was raining and we were on our way out to dinner we were provided with umbrellas by the concierge which was a nice touch , All in all I would recommend this hotel and be happy to stay again though perhaps this time not bring so many clothes!",4,2016,12,05
19,Great hotel in a great location,"A stylish hotel, confortably furnished with attention to details. Elegant amenities in bathroom. Located at just a few minutes walking to paseo de gracia and casa battillo, one of barcelona's landmarks. Rooms are well sound-proof even if location is very busy. ",5,2016,12,04
19,Amazing amazing amazing!!,"This is the first time I'm at hotel Claris, despite being in Barcelona countless times. To start, the check in was efficient, clear and transparent. Staff at the reception were super polite, informative and attentive to the guests. I haven't felt so welcomed as a guest for quite a while. And the staff were quick to offer a cava as a welcome drink. Thumbs up!

The upgrade to a suite duplex is amazing! Room 208 is very nice. Well decorated with taste n mix of vintage artefacts and modern touches. The bed is luxuriously appointed with lots of pillows n cushions and super comfortable. For a traveller infected with jet lag, there's no better cure. The bathroom has a rustic feel with a very large rectangular wash basin with taps at both ends for couples to freshen up together. Thoughtful with elegance, I like all the little touches in the bathroom with really nice luscious bathroom amenities. The water pressure is amazing n washes away all that travel fatigue. And the L shaped couch on the upper level of the duplex is so comfortable n Super nice to just chill with friends having the minibar at close reach. The wardrobe is really really nice. Modern, edgy with the curvy surface...I wanted to bring it home!!

Location is another plus. At Claris/Valencia, it's just next to paseo de Gracia. So easy to get around with lots of good food and shopping at easy reach.

I really like this place a lot and commend the owner, I was told owns the collection at museo egipci, and all the staff I encountered at Claris for a great job done! So much that I wrote this review only on the second day I'm here! 

Thumbs up!!

19,Great location and friendly staff,Stayed for a long weekend. Central location and very friendly staff. Kind of different architecture and design. Cool place. Nice with coffee machine in the room and mini bar. A small lounge area between bathroom and beds. Roof top bar with pool (not heated) and a supposedly great cantonese restaurant that we did not try. ,4,2016,11,27
19,"Good hotel, could be better.","Good location, central yet quiet, and great front staff.  When we arrived, we learned that the suite we booked had stairs -- not good for a husband recuperating from knee surgery.  Despite the hotel being fully booked, they immediately moved us to a comparable room without the stairs.  Many thanks for that!  They were also very helpful in helping us plan our stay, navigate the trains and subway, and answered lots of  questions.

The room was lovely & spacious, but emphasized form over function.  The only spot to hang coats was the bedroom closet -- not ideal for wet raincoats.  A few discrete hooks in the entry way would be helpful.  Some in the bathroom would be nice too, as there was very limited counter space and no place for our toiletries.   

Breakfast was the biggest disappointment.  The first morning it was excellent.  The next morning, when we arrived all the serving dishes were empty.  It looked like a herd of elephants had been grazing.  And this was in the middle of the posted service hours.  No one appeared to be supervising the situation, we had to track someone down to request restocking.  And it took 20 minutes to receive a cup of mediocre coffee.  Normally we'd have had coffee in our room, but that hadn't been restocked either.  The following day was better, but service was still very slow.   The wait staff we saw worked hard,  but just weren't enough of them.  I've stayed at other Derby hotels, and their breakfasts were much better organized.

The recent renovations at this hotel are wonderful, they just need to work out a few kinks in the service.",3,2016,11,27
19,Wonderful hotel in amazing city,"We had the most amazing five days in Barcelona to mark our silver wedding anniversary, staying at this wonderful hotel. The staff were so friendly and obliging, breakfast quite the best and the location perfect for sightseeing.",5,2016,11,27
19,Best hotel ever!,"From start to finish this hotel was fantastic. Welcome drink on arrival, free upgrade to a duplex suite, complementary wine and chocolates (when booked direct). The quality of the bedding, room decor and the softest slippers all made this a luxury experience. Good location and excellent staff. I highly recommend it if you are planning a trip to Barcelona.  I have stayed in a number of 5star hotels and often been disappointed. This is by far the best ever.",5,2016,11,20
19,As lovely as always,"Each and everytime we spend time in Barcelone, we spend time at the Claris. This time we didn't stay there and just had drinks on the roof. Renewed pleasure delightfully experienced, too bad it's winter as the pool is so inviting.",5,2016,11,16
19,I really liked this hotel!!!,"The Hotel Claris is one of the very best I have ever stayed at, and I have stayed at hotels all around the world! It is first class in service, clean rooms, breakfast meals, quiet neighborhood, close to everything and I found it to be well worth the money. One of the more unique things about the Hotel is the Mini Mayan museum that is found inside on the 2nd floor. When we checked in we received complementary tickets to the Egyptian Museum almost across the street! It is only 2 blocks over to one of the ""hop on - hop off"" bus stops ( Must do to see the city. But ask when the bus quits for the day, so you will not be stranded at sundown in Las Ramblas looking for a cab.)",5,2016,11,14
19,"Helpful kind staff, great duplex suite!","Great location, great staff! We were here on our honeymoon and had a lovely time all the way around. Didn't utilize many facilities or the restaurant but the duplex suite was really cool and classy. Definitely recommend! ",5,2016,11,14
19,Enjoyable 4 night stay,"Was here on business and it was a very pleasant stay.  Right in the shopping district.  Room service was quick and delicious.  Breakfast was lovely.  A large selection of continental items or free eggs and hot items cooked to order.  Breakfast staff were very helpful and efficient.
Room is well equiped.  White company toiletries in the bathroom.  Robes and slippers and the fluffiest towels I've ever seen in a hotel!!!
Too cold to use the rooftop pool unfortunately, but the bar up there is nice.",4,2016,11,14
19,Enjoyable Stay,"First time in Barcelona to spend four days touring the City. Hotel is nicely designed, in good location and in pristine condition and clean. Staff very helpful and friendly, excellent Chinese restaurant with innovative menu and good wines.
Problem with main restaurant once where they were unable to produce a vegetarian dish for my wife. Room had unusual design though beautiful had no bathroom door and a rather flimsy WC door. Had booked a junior suite but did not feel like a suite although of a good size.
But overall enjoyed our stay there and would return.",4,2016,11,10
19,Wonderful Hotel Perfect Location,"The hotel is situated near a lot of important sights.  The rooms were emaculate and of very decent size.  Everything is first class at a very reasonable price. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Staff very helpful.  I would definitely stay their again when I go back to Barcelona.  Very clean, great beds, and thick towels.  Just wonderful.",5,2016,11,09
19,Nice small hotel in a good location ,"We stayed there with our four young kids. 
Rooms are clean and the bed is very comfortable but the rooms are too small , also the rooms were dark with lack of good lights. 
Kids were scared from the art around the room. 
 
Not a good options for families.

19,Short midweek stay,"All aspects of hotel were first rate. Great location for shops, attractions and bars. Staff extremely helpful and went out of their way to satisfy our specific requirements (e.g. DVD player for room). Didn't use restaurant so can't comment on that.",5,2016,11,06
19,Great stay ,"Stayed at the end of October, made to feel very welcome by helpful staff, chocolates and champagne brought to our room on request for a birthday. Definitely recommend, nice rooms and 10 minute walk from las ramblas. ",5,2016,11,05
19,False advertising,"Calls itself a five star hotel with fully soundproof rooms. Don't believe it very noisy and no sleep from constant noise from our junior suite. Refund not offered 

Staff not helpful and general manager and MD not helpful after subsequent emails on return.

19,everything but the tub,No handles or support to take a shower made it difficult  for my wife. I would say everything else was fine but that one issue. Things otherwise were as expected for  good hotel. The room was clean and the support staff were friendly. The location was excellent. Near all the shops and restairants in Barcelona.,4,2016,11,03
19,Wonderful Hotel,"We visited this hotel for a long weekend and were very impressed. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were delighted to find a bottle of complimentary bubbly and a rose in our room, a lovely touch.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout our staff, the wifi was free and very good and the room and bathroom very nice. 
We visited both restaurants, Mr Kao, a Cantonese, small portions but tasty and La Terraza del Claris, the rooftop restaurant which we thoroughly enjoyed as food and service both amazing. We also really liked the Gin and Tonics in the bar after a long way walking around Barcelona.
We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,02
19,Lovely stay in Barcelona!,"Beautiful room. Skilled, professional staff who spoke what seemed to be dozens of languages. Delicious, ample breakfasts featuring Continental and full American-style selections. . A doorman always available for taxis, luggage retrieval, directions.  Absolutely wonderful toiletry bag for each traveler - the fragrance and product line (The White Company)  is only available through the hotel industry. And did I mention the terrific front desk staff?",5,2016,11,01
19,What a great find,"Having been to Barcelona numerous times we decided we wanted to find a hotel that wasn't like all the other touristy hotels. 
Well the Claris fit the bill perfectly. Great location but yet off the busy Pasig de Garcia. The room was spotlessly clean and quiet and the bed better than the one we have at home. Also the rooftop bar is not to be missed as it not only serves the perfect gin tonic but you have a great view. We cannot wait to return.",5,2016,11,01
19,The Claris offers a superior hotel experience in every conceivable way.,"We stayed at the Claris for five nights and were continually delighted with all that it offered. It is located in an excellent and convenient, but not too touristy neighborhood; it is modern, well-maintained, and beautifully appointed (with art objects located throughout the hotel); our room was lovely and very comfortable; the Claris provides all the quality services you would expect from a five-star hotel; and its entire staff could not have been more attentive, friendly, or resourceful.",5,2016,10,29

19,Very nice experience,"We spent two nights at the hotel in October 2016. It was wonderful and we were very happy with everything. The property itself is lovely, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. They arranged transfers for us and everything went well. 

We had a minor issue in the restaurant, in that they had problems getting the bill correct (they kept cheating themselves), but it was straightened out. We will stay there again when we return to Barcelona.",4,2016,10,27
19,lovely hotel,We stayed at the Claris for three nights and thought it was a lovely  hotel in a wonderful location. The room was very modern and comfortable with many amenities. The breakfast was great with many selections including made to order items. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would certainly recommend it and hope to stay there again in the future. ,5,2016,10,26
19,Feedback,"It was my first stay in Barcelona, it was very nice, the personal and service in the claris hotel was very friendly. My trip was too short but, thats a reason why i come back, and visit Claris hotel again. Thank you!",5,2016,10,25
19,Hotel Claris,The staff were extremely helpful and attentive. The hotel was really comfortable with a good ambiance and interesting art work. The hotel also had a lovely fragrance. The room was luxurious with good quality bathroom products and the breakfast was delicious. ,5,2016,10,24
19,Bad experience at a nice hotel (in the end),"We stayed at the Claris for four nights. We booked months in advance and the first night we arrived late (which we had informed the hotel about). The room we were put in was very basic (just a bed, wardrobe, no decoration, thin curtain which didn't properly block light and a shower which was blocked - it was also on the ground floor so there was no view). Unfortunately the room was also next to the kitchen staff and there was banging and a squeaky door which was going until 1.30am and started again at 6am. I'm quite a heavy sleeper but it was impossible to get any rest. When we spoke to the front desk they said they couldn't move us. Luckily we'd booked through an external travel agent rather than directly so we called them and they spoke to the hotel and had us moved. The other room (which was what we'd paid for an expected) was much nicer and with blinds and curtains, a nice shower and artwork. We were obviously put in a staff room or reserve room in case they overbook but I don't understand why when we booked so far in advance. At no time did anyone at the hotel apologise for this poor service but treated us as if we were being unreasonable for wanting to move room despite paying more for a nice hotel.

Otherwise the stay was lovely. The new room was great and the location was good. The breakfast buffet was nice. The cooked breakfast was not so great as service was very slow. The first day our food was cold when it arrived. We tried again on the last day as we were travelling but we waited half an hour and our food never arrived - it was a similar problem for other guests). ",3,2016,10,24
19,Great location,"This five-star hotel was recommended by our travel agent. I would probably give it four stars – the facility is very modern on the inside and the service staff is very courteous. Jesus was very helpful. When you make reservations make sure to get breakfast included. The hotel is within walking distance of the center of the city.

Be careful that if you get one of the rooms that has a step just before the bed. The dark floors make the step hard to see. The shower is a suicide shower-you really have to step up into it. But other than that I would recommend this hotel. ",4,2016,10,22
19,"Great location, excellent rooms and service","We stayed in Hotel Claris in a superior room and also in a suite.  Both were an excellent choice.  The suite was very roomy and beautifully furnished.  The superior room was very light and bright and provided kind of a happy feeling.  The beds were comfortable and the rooms quiet.  We very much liked the special art objects in the rooms. We did not used the restaurant but used room service in the morning for a light breakfast (the croissants were excellent).  There is also a nice roof terrace to hang out. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect, all places of interest (from Casa Batllo to La Sagrada Familia, the gothic quarter, El Raval etc) in walking distance.   ",5,2016,10,21

19,Family Trip to Barcelona,"What a fantastic hotel! We are a young 30-something family with a 21-month year old daughter.  The suite was ideal for separate living/sleeping areas. Room service was fast and tasty. Location is super easy to walk to most places (20+ mins) and near good restaurants. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Only negative was our bedroom window was the rare window that faced the courtyard, that had a terrible echo from the rooftop bar until 2am. As tired parents of a toddler we needed our sleep!

19,Bad customer service given.,"I have inform hotel for early check in. When I reach hotel at noon, they told me hotel was full thus I can't check in which is understandable. So I gave them my telephone no to call once hotel room was ready. No phone call at all. Came back 7pm receptionist was busy with two clients. Waited for 15min before we were served. No apologise was given. Didt even bring us up to the hotel room like they did with the previous guest. Following night order a hot tea from the room service. The tea was never served at all. Called the reception the next morning about this incident , no apologise as well and straight away put us into room service. When I told room service what happen, she told me she don't know with no apologise as well. 
Bad customer service. But good location. ",3,2016,10,19
19,Excellent Hotel,"Located close to Casa Batollo, the room was large and comfortable. Breakfast was also great with on-demand eggs and pancakes.

I had accidentally left my goods on leaving, but hotel staff were very quick and kind arranging to send me.",5,2016,10,19
19,Great hotel and good location,Really nice 5* hotel. Good size rooms and less than 10 mins walk to Las Ramblas. Did not eat there (had drinks on rooftop bar) but would recommend the hotel. Stayed in room 120 and found that housekeeping echoed down the corridor first thing in the morning (i think it was them anyway). This was the only negitive.,5,2016,10,18
19,Star Rating,"This Hotel should never have been given 5 stars. The Bar was very poorly stocked as it didn't have three of the drinks we ordered, drinks that are usually very popular and available in most good establishments.  There was not a proper lounge bar area for sitting and relaxing with a drink plus there was not a proper dinning room for Dinner in the evening. We only had dinner once in the Hotel as the dinning room was open to the elements, even the entrance doors were open meaning the temperature was far too low to sit and enjoy an evening meal. The result being we had to eat out in restaurants for the rest of our stay.

So no natural light!

It is set over 2.5 feet above the floor and felt almost dangerous to get out - we each slipped at least once. The cava offering in the lobby was a hilite!",4,2016,10,10

Mixture tourist and business clients.  Small rooms not the most quiet.  Very comfortable beds and separate sitting area in Junior suites.  Needs technology update but provides adapters.  Tight showers but large tub and sink area.  Small closets but functional.  Restaurant and bar rooftop very popular on weekends. Found food and bar service there disappointing.

First night, serious sleep deprivation, not usually a light sleeper.  Main culprit was very very noisy occupants of next room - arriving late to their room, slamming doors, shouting at one another, visitors 'hanging' on room doorbell for what seemed an age at 0540hrs. Design of the room finish was such that we could (unfortunately) even hear them using the WC, and throwing their car keys/watch on metal bedside shelf.  Folks in room above us were equally lacking in consideration at silly o'clock in the morning - tip tap tip tap=high heels - why?? The design of the hotel is such that most walls, floors and ceilings are finished in tile and stone, including bedrooms.  Beautiful rooms. This means the acoustics are tremendous, everything is amplified -  felt like 10-fold. For example, chambermaid trolley sounded like a freight train.  Conversations in the reception area were easily heard, likewise staff walking in the area through the night sounded as if they were wearing stilettos or clogs.  Very bad design on the interior finish of this hotel.  I gave up on sleep and went to reception at @0550hrs to have a little chat.  Weird brief experience, one of the lifts was not working, other two seemed to be out in sympathy.  Had to use fire escape stairs to get to reception - very eery lonely experience.  Night staff were sympathetic, but would need to speak to duty manager at 0900 that morning. I had said if a quiet room couldn't be found we would have to leave, said was not prepared to spend the full five days of our break without sleep.  Also said that I understood they could not legislate for selfish guests.  Later spoke to helpful guest relations chap, we were not the only folks to complain about the same noisy guests.  Again very helpful, but couldn't do anything that day, hotel was fully booked.  He was at liberty to say that the duty manager had said we could be moved on Sunday to a much nicer room.  Ear plugs were purchased by the hotel for me - brilliant night's sleep that evening. Noisy neighbours had gone too.  Next day our bags were moved to a lovely room/apartment on two levels on the second floor.  The duty manager (Enrique?) was very apologetic and conciliatory.  The rest of our stay in the hotel was very enjoyable.  However the staff obviously couldn't fix the fabric of the interior of the hotel, people noises exaggerated by the interior design remained.  Thank goodness for ear plugs.

All in all the hotel was very luxurious.  All staff that we interacted with were very friendly, helpful and informative.  We would recommend the hotel from a comfort and location point of view.  But - be aware of the potential for noise levels.",5,2016,10,03
19,Enjoying Barcelona,"This hotel is lovely and exceptionally well located.  We did a lot of walking!  The service at the hotel was top notch and everyone on the staff were friendly and helpful.  This is definatly
 a great hotel.",5,2016,10,01
19,Lovely place!,"Loved the stayed here. Room was amazing with the upstairs area. Spacious, very clean and great air con. Barcelona is an amazing place and will 100% be going back. Would recommend the hotel for a nice relaxing stay. Great rooftop pool too!",5,2016,10,01
19,Formal boutique hotel,"Claris is a well organised hotel complemented by friendly staff and recently updated facilities. The rooms are well decorated, clean with even standard rooms being well sized. 

When I was there they were refurbishing the restaurant and bar downstairs which forced us to the roof top restaurant / bar right by the small pool, which made things a little cramped at times, especially for sunbathers but i am sure this is temporary. 

There is an Egyptian museum on the first floor and Egyptian style artworks in each room. However this comes across as an attempt to be quirky rather than the natural idiosyncrasy one finds in really good boutique hotels - just a bit forced but a small complaint. 

If you want to go shopping at the chain shops then this is well located but the old town and beach are a long walk away; the metro is close but i prefer to walk.",5,2016,10,01
19,Nice place ,"i truly enjoyed my stay at the claris hotel the last week! the location is perfect and easy accessible. definitely one of their assets is joana, the guest relation girl. always with a big smile on her face making it very pleasant to talk to her. she was very customer orientated and helped me out with everything -recommending me restaurants and organized walking tours - fantastic! the waiter on the terrace was very attentive and friendly and always made sure i was satisfied. i will come back for sure, i felt like being at home!",5,2016,10,01
19,"Beautiful pool, with a touch of THEFT","Venue was excellent and clean, the pool area lovely with great food. 

However to not be safe enough to leave your belongings in your room is a big no no. Furthermore the management teams inability to deal with the claim and wash their hands of the matter was disgusting in any language! 

Most establishments are here at when things are going well, however the measure for me is how they behave when something happens and the team at Hotel Claris were very disappointing.",1,2016,09,30
19,Great location for city central sights!,"The hotel is conveniently located, very central and excellent for getting around town.  It is walking distance to Placa Catalunya and Les Ramblas, as well as Sagrada Familia and the hop-on hop-off bus lines.  There are two hop-on hop-off bus lines The Original – blue buses and City SightSeeing Grayline red buses, that appear to run in opposite directions of the same route. 

The Claris GL was quiet for sleeping at night.  We had a room that faced the main street and were not disturbed by noise.  Great black-out blinds in the room were great for a good sleep as well.

The room is typical size for European standards.  Our room had two single beds pushed together – not intentional on our part but no doubt there were double bed rooms available.  The room had a fresh red rose to greet us – nice touch.  Nespresso coffee maker and pods were provided in the room.  This was also available in the main lobby of the hotel, along with chilled water, orange juice and cava.  Nice rooftop pool and bar. It was regularly in use but not over crowded.

Joanna G. in guest relations was extremely helpful before we arrived and during our trip.  She arranged tickets to FC Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid and the seats were excellent!  She also helped to book the hop-on-hop-off bus and a pre-arranged time to tour the Sagrada Familia.",5,2016,09,30
19,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at the Claris for a week with our one year old and the staff were all very helpful and friendly at breakfast especially.
the room was spacious with everything you could need & lovely toiletries.
The only problem we had was LOTS of noise throughout the night due to other guests.. but would definitely stay again",4,2016,09,30
19,Amazing hotel with perfect location,We could not have had a better stay. This hotel is amazing. The staff were very friendly and made excellent recommendations for activities and dinner.  The location was perfectly located for walking to many of the major Barcelona attractions.  ,5,2016,09,29
19,Lovely 5-star boutique hotel,"I highly recommend staying at Hotel Claris. It is centrally located in one of the better neighborhoods in Barcelona, quite close to all the best shopping and within walking distance of La Rambla. 

My husband and I stayed there with some friends. We all loved the look and feel of the hotel. It is a smaller, boutique hotel but we found the amenities luxurious none-the-less. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were plenty large for us. One of our friends upgraded to a split level suite, which was huge. We really enjoyed the rooftop terrace -- the service and food were perfect.

Most of all, the staff here are great! The dinner bookings they made for us are some of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona now (I've since told my friend about them). They also made sure our dog was comfortable (we travel with him frequently) providing a dog bed and food bowls for him.

After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a bit nervous about staying here but I am so glad I didn't listen to them! I am not sure where they stayed or what they experienced, but their experience doesn't mirror ours at all. I will definitely stay here again upon visiting the city. ",5,2016,09,28
19,Ideal Location for Gaudi Walks!,"Before our trip we were attracted to Hotel Claris on a friend's recommendation, reviews, and online photos. However, we didn't realize how well it was located relative to most of the Gaudi sites, La Petrera, Sagrata Familia, Batllo, etc., as well as only 6-7 blocks from the north end of Las Ramblas. We are big walkers, so the location turned out to be perfect. Our room was very nice, although stepping over the high tub rim to take a shower was very awkward. The big disappointment was the services of the concierge. We called one evening to have them make reservations at a popular restaurant in the Old City for the following evening. They promised to leave us a messaging confirming the following day. Of course, we were out the following day sight seeing, and returned in the late afternoon to find that they had not called the restaurant. In fact, they didn't even have our call from the evening before in their log. The young man on the desk was, of course, unable to get us a table at that late hour. In other attempts to get assistance on other days, he passed us off to other staff, none of whom seemed all that able to really help us with various requests. I still think the hotel is very nice and well-located, so I wouldn't cross it off the list because of the weak concierge. The other staff in the hotel was good. The door staff, BTW, was VERY nice and helpful. The morning we left, we rented a car, and the gentleman on the door took over everything when I drove up with it, including allowing us to go down the street for breakfast without worrying about the time.",4,2016,09,27
19,Stylish roof top and decor.,"Beautiful roof top area and stylish decor throughout. Interesting art work and internal design. We were disappointed by the room size and the lack of wardrobe space but we still enjoyed the ambience of the hotel in general. The location was good and the staff were attentive. We found the bedroom a little dark during the day but when lit fully in the evening, it was very attractive.",4,2016,09,27
19,Lovely Hotel,"Perfect location for our weekend trip, with friendly, helpful staff with great local knowledge. Especially enjoyable was a nightcap on the roof terrace. If you're looking for an elegant, unpretentious hotel for a relaxing trip, this is the place for you. ",5,2016,09,27
19,Great location and close to main attractions but without the hustle and bustle,"Lovely hotel with great staff including the warm cheerful welcome of the doorman every time you pass through.
Hotel Claris is in a great location for exploring as it is only one street back from the Passeig de Gracia but without the constant noise of the traffic. Don't get me wrong, it's not peaceful but a lot less noisy - that's all part of city living.

All the main attractions are within walking distance from the hotel, for instance;
La Pedrera and the Gaudi house are 5 mins
The Sagrada Familia is 15-20 mins
The Gothic Quarter is 20 mins
Shopping on Passeig de Gracia/ Av Diagonal is less than 5 mins

The rooms are not huge or as plush as they appear on website photos and a little dark but saying that our room was super clean with plenty of towels, bathrobes and slippers plus a nice selection of White Company toiletries including a sleep spray (so you are well prepared after a hard days walking: bath crystals & something to help you sleep if you think you'll need it!) a huge flat screen tv and the bed was very comfortable. 
My husbands only complaint was no tea, only coffee making facilities.

We opted for room only and enjoyed tea/coffee with croissants in the sunshine each morning at Josephine's across the road, about €6 total.

As for restaurants, lots of choice to suit many tastes and budgets including the hotel rooftop restaurant which had a small but delicious menu and beautifully presented as one would expect in a 5 star hotel and El Rita round the corner from Josephine's is just fab.
The rooftop also bar offers a great selection of drinks, cocktails and tapas with nice views but the pool area is small ( if you are able to get one of the few loungers good luck, they appeared to be fully occupied - I guess some people just aren't up to enjoying the sights the city has to offer!)
We cheekily enjoyed an evening at the rooftop bar of the Hotel Majestic which you can see from hotel Claris's bar, again with nice chilled music but the views down Passeig de Gracia are absolutely spectacular, worth a visit (get in their lift - 10th floor!)

If you prefer tapas then there are plenty to choose from, Tapas 24 (two streets down from the hotel on the corner of Passeig de Gracia) but most are in the next street over on Carrera de Catalunya. 
Although I highly recommend Lonja de Tapas in the picturesque Gothic Quarter near the Piccasso museum.

In a nutshell, a great hotel, not cheap but worth it, with charming staff who are helpful or willing to book any attraction tickets in advance for you,",4,2016,09,26
19,I adore this place,Had a fantastic stay in the split level suite. The staff were great. We were met in reception and greeted with a glass of fizz! We loved our room - the free standing bath was glorious. The hotel is in a great location that is near enough but not too near all the action. The terrace is great for evening drinks. Everything everywhere is spotless.,5,2016,09,26
19,Beautiful concept but beware ,"Stayed here for a long weekend and booked a suite. Unfortunately found out the hard way that not all rooms are equal and I was put into what is a long corridor of a room - tight and super dark. Seriously a misery at over 1000 a night. That was balanced by staff that are on the whole lovely and caring - wanting to do their best to make things better. I especially single out Victoria who clearly feels so strongly about customer service and the hotel - bravo. 
Overall it's really a beautiful concept - art and artifact filled hotel smack in the center. Great public spaces and restaurant on the roof. However- buyer beware of what size the room is and if it has enough Windows for natural light ",3,2016,09,25
19,"Nice location, comfy beds!","Location is once, close to main shopping areas. The beds are nice and service was great. There was a lot of street noise, and we were on the fifth floor. Nothing the hotel can do anything about, as they have thought of all other little details, so that would be the only downside. Otherwise, a lovely stay.",4,2016,09,25
19,Absolutely wonderful,"The location, staff, service, restaurant and pool on the roof top, and room were absolutely wonderful. We had a triple room and it was spacious and comfortable, with even a pillow menu and relaxing lavender spray for bedtime. Our bathroom had the shower, toilet area and bath tub areas all separate from each other, which is perfect for a group of three people. The concierge was accessible, knowledgeable and very helpful. The roof top was so relaxing during the siesta time to lounge with drinks and tapas. The only, and I do mean only, thing I wish they had was 24 hour room service so we could have had an early breakfast on our departure day. 
  Really a perfect stay - from the welcoming bellman , the warm & smiling front desk staff, the helpful concierge, the friendly maids, the efficient & pleasant wait staff at the restaurant, the absolutely lovely and very clean room, the museum on the first floor, the beautiful water feature visible from the elevator, the roof top pool & restaurant with the living wall, and all in a great location. Highly recommend.",5,2016,09,24
19,"Great Hotel, Great Service Great Location","We stayed here for our 30th Anniversary and it was our last stop in Europe.  We were very happy with all the wonderful staff, loved the rooftop buffet breakfast and made notice of how wonderful the wait staff kept the buffet table clean, full of wonderful fruit, breads and made to order eggs!  ",5,2016,09,23
19,"Very tiny rooms, good location","The hotel was recommended by our tour operator, but the rooms were so small that we couldn't stand in the room! Amenities are excellent, business center was accessible for urgent business needs. The breakfast was good with a range of food better than many other Hotels in Europe. Staff were good and helpful.",3,2016,09,23
19,Wonderfull,"Had the most wonderful stay at the Claris hotel in Barcelona. Excellent location only a few minutes walk to the centre. Metro was close by and easy to use. I'd recommend a T10 ticket which Allows 10 tube journeys. One ticket can be used by more that one person. Breakfast was perfect, excellent choice of various food. Staff were friendly and attentive. Nothing bad to say. Would definitely stay again! The museum across the road is a must! ",5,2016,09,22
19,"Amazing roof terrace with restaurant, bar and pool in the city center","Great central location, you can walk or a short cab ride to many of the famous Barcelona attractions. The bedrooms aren't huge I expect you have to pay a lot more for one of the larger rooms, but when you are there to see Barcelona it didn't matter. 

The roof terrace was the best part of the hotel, we ate at the restaurant for lunch when we arrived and the food was delicious in a nice atmosphere.

But it is at night when it is spectacular, the bar serves great cocktails, they had live music and the view over the rooftops were superb.

For location it is a great find. Staff were very helpful and friendly. We would stay here again.",4,2016,09,22
19,"Eceptional service especially room service, Ahh pasta in bed :-)",Comfortable and stylish room. The bed was wonderful. We had room service for dinner due to incredible Jet lag and it was fabulous. Great service! Right in the downtown area so it was wonderful walking around and seeing the sights.,5,2016,09,20
19,Beautiful Hotel - Luxury,"Excellent hotel with beautiful rooms containing pieces of Egyptian Art. Some bedrooms have a mezzanine level. 

Close to Passeig de Gracia.  
Further away from the picturesque Gothic Quarter.

Not cheap. Well worth it for a romantic getaway!! They also have goodie packs for adults...",4,2016,09,19
19,The Best Hotel!,"Staying at the Claris was one of the BEST hotel experiences that I’ve ever had!
The room looked like it was out of a travel magazine! The service was the best. Very helpful, fast and efficient.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and colleges. I will definitely be staying there again!",5,2016,09,19
19,Terrible experience,"Ac isn't working , when I complained they moved me to another hot room

Service is bad, I booked a 9 night stay & they thought it was too much to ask for a complementary water

Value for money = 0
There a lot of hotels which are way better & cheaper",1,2016,09,19
19,Major noise issue,Everything about the hotel was fine except for the fact that our room on the 6th floor was right under the roof-top restaurant. The noise from the restaurant was unbearable and lasted till 2:00 am in the morning.  Choose a room below the 6th floor and away from the restaurant area.,4,2016,09,19
19,The best place to stay in Barcelona ,"A true 5 star hotel in the best ( most convenient and luxurious ) city location
Great roof terrace and pool
Drinks are not cheap but it's a 5 star city hotel 
Great decor in hotel and rooms
Nice Egyptian touches and a dedicated Egyptian museum which is free for the hotel guests.
Superb staff and attention to detail 
5 mins walk from the main shopping and 10 to 15 mins walk to most of the tourist attractions
Possibly the best located hotel in BCN 
Quite central in the heart of what's going on and top quality.  
",5,2016,09,18
19,In need of serious improvement ,"This is a Small Luxury Hotel that is also both a landmark and a monument but on the sample that I have just experienced over the past 2 days, it has fallen well short of my expectation on just about every level. 

The hotel is tired. The lifts are temperamental and it is extremely noisy - the first night I was allocated a room on the 6th floor, directly underneath the rooftop Terraza and was woken in the very early hours of the morning by the dragging of tables, some alarm sirens and a combination of other related sounds which deprived me of the one thing I needed after a late check in / a good nights sleep. 

Apart from the restless night, the room itself was dusty, air vents hadn't been cleaned for some time and settled dust was thick above the in room artefact so proudly displayed. The over the bath shower,  was incapable of being positioned above my head and instead partly flooded the bathroom floor. I complained to reception in the absence of a Duty Manager who didn't start until 9:00 and called me at 10:00. 

He was surprised by my catalogue of errors and was apologetic / offering to move me to a quieter room and rather than an upgrade I was in actual fact downgraded. 

The lifts were faulty for the duration - going up instead of down and bypassing floors seemingly to irritate me. 

Breakfast on the roof should be easy enough but it's not. Despite ample staff the service is sluggish and we had to ask multiple times for hot coffee and toast, toasted on both sides rather than warm breed. Twice I ordered poached eggs and twice I sent them back as they were barely cooked and served in a glass bowl better suited as a receptacle for almonds or olives.

I was sent a plate of fruit for my troubles but the partially rotten strawberries and smashed grapes didn't appeal so I left this offering to be discarded on my departure.

All told / a rather Fawlty Towers type experience all round. Sad really as the Reception staff and doorman were both charming. 

The rest however / was not. ",2,2016,09,18
19,A definite 5 star,"Stayed at the hotel for a day. Got upgraded from a super deluxe to a suite.

Hotel is located in a central area with many trendy restaurants/bars/coffee shops. The famous av. Diagonal was 2-3 mins walk. 
 
We were greeted by a friendly doorman and the luggage was taken care off. The reception staff was warm and welcoming. The hotel interior was modern.

Our Suite was a duplex. The room was a perfect combination of modern and old artsy interior. Walls were decorated with antique artwork. The bed was very comfortable with a flat TV. The upper section had a comfy lounge with another flat TV. The bathroom was a good size too with a bath tub.

We got treated to a bottle of champagne and chocolates for our wedding anniversary. The top floor has a pool, bar and a restaurant. We enjoyed breakfast (24 or 25 euros each) and cocktails in the evening. 

We would certainly come back and stay at Claris in Barcelona,",5,2016,09,14
19,Amazing.,"We were given one of the better grand suites in the hotel, and the room was perfect; the bed and bathroom were especially beautiful. Greeted with a complimentary glass of cava and a bottle of water and chocolates. 

The staff were courteous and friendly throughout; the concierges were especially helpful with directions and taxis. Excellent location.",5,2016,09,13
19,Catalonian luxury,"We arrived very early and our room was not ready yet.  They stowed our luggage and took care of medication that needed refrigeration.  When we went to get our room, we had been upgraded to a suite.  It was lovely.  Great bathroom with a whirlpool tub and separate, roomy shower. Easy walking distance of many sites, very nice rooftop terrace with a swimming pool and a very courteous and accommodating staff. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,09,12
19,"Truly Wonderful, worth the splurge!!!!","We began our vacation at the Hotel Claris. It couldn't be nicer. Great air conditioning, fluffy pillows,huge fluffy towels,a ""10"" shower. Breakfast was on the roof !!!! The food staff, the view. It was all just so nice. After flying 36 hours it was just so perfect. Totally worth the splurge!!!",5,2016,09,11
19,above and beyond,"i was so pleased with the staff... they went above and beyond....the location is quite good as a lot of tourist places are at walking distance...surrounding is quiet,compare to ramblas...have no complaints whatsoever...had a nice stay in barcelona....loved it!",4,2016,09,11
19,Fantastic,"A beautiful roof top pool whilst the rooms were also as beautiful, the staff in the hotel really made the difference. I've stayed in many 5 star hotels in Barcelona but Hotel Claris would be one of my favourites",5,2016,09,11
19,Excellent Choice,Princess Cruises booked Claris for us and it was an excellent choice.  Staff could not have been better   Will stay there again.  The rooftop pool and restaurant was a nice treat.  Breakfast was included and the food quality on the buffet was very good.,5,2016,09,09
19,Luxurious ,"We begin our 2015 Spain trip in Barcelona at the Hotel Claris which definitely lives up to its 5 star rating; plush bathrobes and slippers, great customer service.   Like a luxury hotel everything cost a little bit extra; there's no irons in the room, however, you can pay for pressing service at about $3-$5 USD per item.  

The best asset to the Hotel Claris are the doormen.  They were full of useful information and gave perfect directions.  

A pleasant stay. ",4,2016,09,08
19,Very nice hotel,"This is a Derby hotel. It is very Clean and modern, although tub/shower combo could be a bit upgraded. Very friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. Very nice rooftop terrace, with great tapas choices. They also have luxury car rentals available conveniently at the hotel. ",5,2016,09,06
19,"Fabulous, friendly hotel","We booked here as a last minute short break with lastminute.com. Arrived on Sunday afternoon to be greeted by friendly reception and door staff. 
Room was a junior suite and it was very spacious, simple but spotlessly clean and with everything we needed. Our son had his own little room with a separate tv so that helped on a night. 
Roof terrace great for early or late drinks. 
Mr. Kau dim sum restaurant in the lobby is wonderful. A serene oasis of calm with superb, helpful staff and amazing freshly cooked dim sum. We'd recommend the monkfish in zucchini flower and the prawn won ton. Loved every dish!
Would definite stay here again as it's pretty central and within easy reach of all attractions. 
Didn't try breakfast as decided to eat out both mornings but I'm sure if everything else is to go by it will be fab. 
We did however try room service and our son had a burger which was outstanding! Even my husband said it was one of the best burgers he'd tasted in a long time! ",5,2016,09,05
19,Perfect short break venue,We stayed at the end of August. The hotel is quiet and comfortable with very effective air conditioning. Check in was excellent. The location is good with easy access to metro.etc. The only downside is some traffic noise at night but this was not significant.,4,2016,09,03
19,Great hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights prior to a cruise.  The hotel is centrally located close to shopping and transportation.
Our reception was very friendly, despite our late arrival.  All of the staff we encountered were cheerful and made us feel welcome.
Our room was beautifully kept and comfortable. 
We dined on the rooftop restaurant each night and enjoyed each dish very much.
Our only issue was the wifi reception in our room.  It would work only intermittently for a minute or two at a time.  We have made Reception aware if this issue.",4,2016,09,03
19,Excellent ,"We were on our honeymoon and the staff met us with bottle of champagne and sweets, which was very pleasant. 
Rooms are clean, the staff is polite and always ready to help.
Food is tasty as well. 
The location of the hotel is near the Passeig de Grácia, close to worldwide famous fashion boutiques. 
I liked this hotel, and recommend to all those who is looking for quality service hotel. ",5,2016,09,03
19,Perfect for a city break,"We stayed 3 nights at the Claris hotel and we really enjoyed our stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was upgraded and the room was super spacious and incredibly beautiful. We were there to celebrate my birthday and the hotel had arranged a bottle of champagne which was a lovely gesture. 

The hotel is in a great location and only 10 minute walk from the closest metro stop but so easy to navigate. 

If shopping is your thing, Chanel, Louis Vuitton are just around the corner aswell as Highstreet shops Zara, mango, guess etc. 

We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city. ",5,2016,09,02
19,Great location Great service Great experience,"Starting from the check-in process, where we were greeted by Clément Fabiani, director of rooms and 2 cold glasses of Cava, our stay at Hotel Claris was a perfect one.

The hotel is in walking distance to many of Barcelona's many attractions and steps from the Casa Batlló (a must see).  In addition, the port is walkable as well as La Rambla and the other shopping areas that Barcelona has to offer.

The concierge knows the city well and can give great guidance with regards to restaurants and attractions.

The rooftop restaurant, pool, and bar are spectacular.  A nice little oasis in the middle of a city.  The breakfast (served every morning) is perfect to get the day started with the open air dining.

All in all, a perfect stay.",5,2016,09,02
19,Okay but not Great,"This place disappointed.

Its not a 5 Star hotel in my book, not sure whose book it could be called one.

Nice enough location.

Rooms small. Noisy

Rooms service menu very poor.

Roof top bar has poor service.

Its just not great, not exactly bad either.",3,2016,09,01
19,Outstanding in Every Sense,"The hotel has an excellent location, is a block away from Paseo de Gracia and not too far from the touristy Ramblas to where you can easily walk.  The hotel has beautiful rooms specially the double level suites.  But what makes the hotel different is the service of the staff, who is very committed to make your stay unforgetable, no request is too big or too small.  The manager Victoria is incredible, very professional and committed and sets the tone for the staff, who is there always and invariably very obliging and friendly to assist you.  We were there to celebrate a birthday and found the room decorated with heart ballons, a card and a beautiful cake, unforgetable and touching!  Would highly recommend this hotel, you will enjoy your stay and will get a lot for what you pay.",5,2016,09,01
19,Elegant and affordable,"What a stunning hotel. Don't miss the roof top restaurant, it's perfect for a little down time. The concierge was wonderful, she recommended the perfect spot on the beach for paella. The location was very good, about equal distance from all the major sites and terrific restaurants within walking distance. ",5,2016,08,31
19,Fantastic Hotel,"This was our second stay in this wonderful hotel, after a first class experience last December we decided to try this hotel again this summer. 
The service was second to none, the doorman, the receptionists and cleaners are all second to none, friendly, efficient, always happy to help and every member of staff makes your stay one to remember for all the right reasons.

There are only three things that would stop this hotel being perfect:-

1. Air conditioning in our room was just about adequate it doesn't pump out cold air when you need it and at night it got a little warm (this may have been unique to our room though!).

2. Having a 'Pay per view' service for movies etc. would be great, we spent the first two days of our stay in our room as we run a business and had work to do before we could enjoy ourselves, there is only so much news one can take (the only English language channels were news channels!) so having the option of paying for a movie or two would be very welcome.

3. The drinks at the terrace bar aren't value for money, I know that this is a 5 star hotel and expect to pay more, however 15 Euros for a a champagne glass sized pina colada was a little excessive!

Those minor issues aside our experience was just exceptional, we are booking to return next summer and now wold not stay anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,31
19,"Not a 5*, in my opinion.","We stayed for 4 nights at the start of August. 

The reception staff were generally nice, the concierge was a lovely lady too. Unfortunately, they didn't tell us about the coffee machine just out of sight of reception where you can grab a coffee at any time. There were repairs going on throughout our stay too (not an August job in any hotel). 

The biggest issue for us was the room, it would have been an ok room for a 4* but it was tiny. Even more disappointingly it was nothing like what was advertised on booking.com. The first night the marketing manager left a note in our room asking us to review the hotel. I emailed her the following morning explaining that I felt that the pictures of the rooms were misleading. I heard back from her two days later (while I was still staying in the hotel) hoping I had a nice stay and she would bring it to the attention of the marketing team. Pretty poor response, I thought. 

The room did have a nespresso machine. They put two pods in the first day and never gave us any more. I asked at reception at one point and was told they would have housekeeping put some in the room, none materialised (hence added frustration finding out there was a coffee machine downstairs the entire time with plenty of capsules). 

The roof terrace is really nice, pool is fab. Fresh towels for the loungers. Though there's only about 6 loungers and (as in every hotel) some people like to leave their towels down when they head out for a day sightseeing (I feel this could be managed by the hotel better).

The cocktails on the terrace were lovely. Though the food was overpriced. 

Location-wise it's very good. About a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas. 15 minutes in the other direction to the Sagrada Familia. 

Overall, I wouldn't stay again.",3,2016,08,29
19,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel itself is unlike anything I've visited before, it's like being transported into a different world when you step inside. You'll find ancient artefacts in your room, and a museum of interesting objects on the first floor - which gives it a really quirky (in a good way) feel. The rooms also look great, and are nice and cool.

It's really nice having the rooftop pool and terrace bar - which we thought was reasonably priced (€9 for a glass of Perrier Jouet, for example), for good quality drinks and cocktails. The only comment would be that the pool and terrace are a little smaller than you may assume from the photos.

The other thing I should mention is that every single one of the staff, from cleaning staff to the concierge, were extremely friendly and helpful, without being overbearing. Great!

For us, there were just a few small things that reduced this to a 4* review, and took our impression down from ""breathtaking"" to ""very good"".

1. Beds - we booked a double room, but the bed was actually 2 twins pushed together, with *separate* sheets and duvets. I guess it depends how you sleep, but the inevitable ""gap"" in the middle was large and very uncomfortable! I've seen hotels do this before, and understand why - but have previously stayed in rooms where the issue was mitigated by a) the beds actually linking together, so they don't move apart b) using double bedding, and using a fitted sheet across both mattresses so you don't really notice the gap.

2. Cleaning - The cleaner had a horrible tendency to put anything we left on the floor in the bathroom in the bidet, which was a bit shocking! Also, our glasses were not changed or cleaned for the entire week (one had been used for wine, so was sticky and dirty). I have never experienced this before, least of all in a 5* hotel. Finally, one of the bathrobes was taken away on the first day and never came back.

3. Shower - More of a design flaw (I see others have said the same), but the glass pane didn't reach back very far, which made it really easy to spray the room with water. (Not helped as our shower didn't drain properly, either, so you ended up standing in 10cm of water after a shower).

We did really enjoy our stay, so if these things were fixed, wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends. It was frustrating to see how close the hotel was to perfect, and that the things that disappointed us most were so minor!",4,2016,08,28
19,Hotel Claris Stay,This is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It was very luxurious and had some wonderful facilities such as a museum and pool. All of the staff have magnificent service and we will definitely be back again soon! ,5,2016,08,27
19,Best Honeymoon Hotel,"The best hotel there is. We were in our honeymoon and we were directly upgraded to a premium room. Reception is amazing. Most of the staff speak more than 2 languages and were very helpful, from doormen to reception to cleaning ladies. Everyone are so nice. 3 elevators making it quick access to our room. Breakfast very rich but we just had it once because we chose to eat every day in a different place since we wanted to see most of Barcelona. Price to quality is moreee than great. We were really happy with our stay and the hotel's generosity and we would definitely advise all our friends to stay there since it's in a prime location as well.",5,2016,08,26
19,Excellent Birthday Break in Barcelona!,"I booked the Claris for a 4 day birthday treat for my partner Dorothy - it turned out to be an excellent choice. From first arrival to final departure the service was first class, doorman, front desk, poolside and restaurant staff all couldn't do enough for us. The style of the hotel is chic, modern and arty, our room the same, tasteful and with a huge comfy bed. We loved the roof terrace cocktail bar - our top ""like"" and a great place to finish the day. We actually spent the best part of our last day there relaxing by the pool. The hotel was in the right location for us, walking distance to the Sagrada Familia and Gaudi houses and straight down the fabulous Passieg de Gracia to the Gothic Quarter, Cataluna and La Rambla - a bit further out to Parc Guell.  We walked everywhere but taxis were in plentiful supply. Overall a fabulous stay and one we will definitely repeat.",5,2016,08,25
19,First time in Barcelona,"My partner booked this hotel for my birthday. I loved it. The staff we're so friendly, the hotel was very clean. It was too cold to use the pool as we went in March, but the pool area was spotless. Everything about this hotel was 5*. The butlers at the door were so helpful and very smartly dressed. Only downside was the location, but we were only here for two full days so didn't have the chance to walk around, we had to get taxis to places to fit everything in. Would come back.",5,2016,08,23
19,Good not Great,"The best of the hotel is the location, you are close to the best of Barcelona and on your way is the Sagrada Familia.
But the Hotel is not 5 stars, you will find that the installations are not maintained up to date, the bathrooms are not well designed, the bathtub is small and very tall, every time you shower you wet all bathroom because the glass doors are not closed to the bathtub… etc. We stayed in a room next to the stairs well… it is a chaos, people and employees go in and out all the time at all times, night, day.
Rooms are not quiet, you can hear everything from the halls and the deep smell to incense all the time instead of being relaxing is annoying. Then the restaurant/bar on the top of the hotel says it open until late, well not really, if you go after dinner they will say they only have drinks up to 11pm and no food, they we’ll give you some old dry popcorn. 
Then if you don’t speak English beware because the concierges don’t speak Spanish, the two ladies are very nice but they don’t speak Spanish nor known a lot about Barcelona, as an example one didn’t know about the Barcelona Soccer team… you better go to the front desk, the lady there actually lived in Barcelona and know all the good advices and she also speaks Spanish. She recommended two restaurants that were amazing!!! And she knew the cost of the main attractions and what was worth and what didn’t.
So the location is great, but don’t have a lot of expectations on the rest.",3,2016,08,22
19,Nice short stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights on a short trip to Barcelona. Pretty close to everything if you like walking. Has an interesting private egyptology museum which is worth visiting if you are intressten in the Roman Period of Egypt. Hotel facilities in general are nice. No normal gym, just the tiny room to make it a 5 star. Nice small pool area on the rooftop. ",5,2016,08,22
19,Excellent Stay at the Hotel Claris,"We were so pleased to have chosen the Hotel Claris for our short stay in beautiful Barcelona. The location, the friendly, helpful staff, the individually decorated rooms, the excellent food in the restaurant and the lovely terrace - perfect for drinks after long days sightseeing, all contributed to a memorable trip. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,22
19,Great Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Claris.  The room was great, with only one problem -- there was not enough cupboard space for clothing.  The service was excellent.  The breakfast was fantastic and the service was great.  The pool deck was a little small and lacked some seating, but otherwise a great experience!",5,2016,08,22
19,Short weekend break,The hotel is small and wll presented. Close to the main shops and a short walk to the centre.   The restaurant on the roof should not be missed and the food is wonderful.   Great place just to relax and unwind.   Ask for directions to Jamie Be is ten's restaurant.,5,2016,08,20
19,Great customer service,"Just got back from a long weekend city break with my daughter.  Hotel Claris is well situated for most attractions, as long as you're ok with a bit of a walk. Had a bit of an issue with a flooded bathroom but dealt with quickly and efficiently and moved to an upgraded room - great customer service.  Didn't eat at the hotel but the rooftop bar and pool were a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle. Would stay here again. ",5,2016,08,19
19,Good,"It`s a good, solid 4 star hotel but definitely not 5!
Bathrooms are outdated, minibar is poor. With regards to all other aspects such as cleanliness, service, attention of the staff and location is very good.",4,2016,08,18
19,Good stay,I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and I must say although the hotel was nice it was not spectacular. The staff were great very friendly. Room was comfortable but small. The rooftop bar and pool area is lovely but again small. The food in the rooftop restaurant was beautiful cannot fault with great service . The location was good not to far to walk to be within main areas of sights. ,4,2016,08,16
19,Ok...,"Hotel is nice with a great museum... Rooms are ok but the bathrooms need renovations! They are very outdated... Only downfall is the bathtub - it is so high banged my legs getting out everytime (very frustrating).  Another major inconvenience, there are no irons available.  You have to pay for every piece of clothing that needs to be pressed (gets expensive every night for a family of 4!) ",4,2016,08,16
19,City break in Barcelona,"A very well situated hotel near to the main shopping area and Gaudi architecture. A very short walk to Casa Batllo and around 15/20 minutes to Sagrada Familia. Also near to major bus route for a thirty minute trip to Park Guell.  Went for our tenth wedding anniversary and on return to our room on day one found a complementary bottle of Cava to help celebrate. We had a room on floor four at the front of the hotel which on the first night appeared noisy with loud traffic throughout the night. However, night two slept right through with no issues. The bed was firm/medium and incredibly comfortable and the air conditioning was quiet and efficient. The bathroom was a very generous size with a very powerful hot shower in a large bath tub. My wife's only complaint would be that there were no tea making facilities in the room and only an espresso machine. ",5,2016,08,15
19,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Claris Hotel for 5 days, and we highly recommend it. The staff is helpful, the room was beautifully appointed and quiet (we really depended on those blackout shades!), and although we didn't eat in their restaurant, the buffet breakfast, offered on their rooftop, was ample, fresh and well-prepared. A few of the hotel's design decisions are a bit questionable (the lobby is stark and unwelcoming, and luckily, we rarely heard the clacking of high heels on the marble floors in the hallways), but we would gladly stay there again.",5,2016,08,15
19,"Hotel great, highly recommend","Rooms extremely clean. Amenities high quality. Staff very helpful.  Didn't eat at the restaurant, or the breakfast, so can't comment on meals. Taxi's right at the front door, hotel located easy walking to many attractions",5,2016,08,14
19,Super Top Hotel,"What a wonderful experience while staying at The Claris Hotel. The bellman, desk clerk and matre d' made our trip unforgettable.   

Their lounge on the 7th floor has a wonderful view of the city and it is walking distance to major sites of beautiful Barcelona. We had a tour departing early in the morning and could not have breakfast at the hotel so the desk clerk arranged five scrumptious picnic baskets for us to take on our trip.

If I return to Barcelona I will surely stay at this wonderful hotel again.",5,2016,08,13
19,Great location. Poor welcome,"I used to stay regularly at Claris but recently switched to the W. I thought I'd come back with the family as I love the area. What a shock. The queue to the reception to check in was very long and slow. I took my family which includes 4 children for a snack whilst the queue went down. An hour later we still had to wait and when we got there were met with complete indifference. We booked 2 premium rooms and given that we are only stating one night and had alerted the hotel if our early arrival had hoped the hotel might be able to do something. The lady at reception told us there was one room available. Brilliant we can change the children into lighter clothes. Except the receptionist couldn't get hold of housekeeping and then told us it wasn't available. She made no attempt to keep trying and simply kept repeating the contractual rules about 3pm check in. No empathy, no consideration, and generally poor customer service. Very disappointing. Hope when we finally get into the room that the service will be better. I don't mind the rooms weren't ready but lack of staff on the desk, bad service and indifference is inexcusable. I will keep you updated!!",1,2016,08,13
19,Professional,I began my visit by forgetting my cel-phone on the plane.  Natalia made numerous calls to the airline.   Her persistent strive for me was so professional and she was not willing to give up until she was able to locate my phone.  After retrieving my phone she had set up a personal tour for us with Carmen Salvador that was the most delightful experience that we encountered on our trip.  Elias from the hotel was always helpful for great recommendations to go eat or shop.  The staff was always smiling and greeting me as family when I was walking in or out.  I will always stay at this hotel and recommend it to others.,5,2016,08,13
19,My favorite place to stay in Barcelona,"An excellent experience.  The lobby was unimpressive (but that was about the only thing that was). The hotel itself was welcoming and the staff was among the best I have encountered at a hotel. It appears that all of them speak several languages and they are very concerned about your comfort and happiness at all times.  I especially liked the staff in the roof-top pool/restaurant.  They made the fantastic breakfast, hanging out by the pool during the day, and after dinner drinks enjoyable.  The rooms were also very nice and spacious.  The rooftop pool was smaller than it appears in the pictures ,but ultimately it was functional.  I don't think I can stay in another hotel in Barcelona after this experience.",5,2016,08,11
19,FIne centrally located Barcelona hotel,"We (mid fifties parents and 20 and 16 yo daughters) very much enjoyed our 5 night stay at the Claris.  The location is perhaps the best possible, steps from the Passeig de Gracia and Casa Battlo/La Predrera and the shopping/restaurants of the Eixample, a 10 minute walk to Gracia, a 15 minute walk to Sagrada Familia, a straight shot cab right down to Las Ramblas, Barri Gothic or Barceloneta, you get the picture.  The hotel was fine, helpful staff and a fairly nice breakfast each morning on the rooftop terrace, much interesting Egyptian artwork in halls and rooms, and a decent sized (by European standards) room with good wifi coverage.  Mr. Kao's was a good on site restaurant, though they had a power outage the first night we were there and had to leave and eat elsewhere (clearly not their fault!), we returned and enjoyed the dim sum.  We really just slept at the hotel as we were so busy exploring the city, but it gave us a welcome respite after our hectic and hot days and was just in a perfect location.  I would very much recommend the Claris.",5,2016,08,10
19,Family Trip,"Perfect location!!
The staff was very professional,helpful and courteous.
Defiantly would stay again!
The staff in the terrace went out of there way to accommodate my family and especially my children in making them food that was not on the menu.
We were given a price for the breakfast buffet if we ate every morning at the hotel. There was one day we had a tour very early and would not be able to eat at the hotel and they prepared a picnic basket for us to take. I was very surprised because other hotels we have stayed have never offered this with out us asking.

",5,2016,08,10
19,Wow!!!,"One of the best hotels which I have stayed in.
Standard of service, rooms and cleanliness could not have been improved. Air conditioning a welcome retreat from the heat outside.The very effective  blinds controlled bright light outside resulting in a brilliant nights sleep.
The staff were efficient, unfailingly helpful, happy and approachable.
We decided to have breakfast here each morning of our stay and that was definitely the right decision.
The situation of the hotel was perfect for us - really central, and the rooftop pool was big enough to swim in.",5,2016,08,08
19,Hotel Claris,"I had a very enjoyable stay recently at Hotel Claris.  The room was lovely, well appointed and the air conditioning very welcoming.  The staff were very professional and it was a great location.  Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,07
19,Fantastic hotel!,"I stayed at the Hotel Claris for one night in late June. I was very impressed with this hotel. It is beautifully decorated throughout (from the lobby to the rooms) with gorgeous art and sleek and modern furnishings. Everything was tasteful but luxurious. Our room was a little on the smallish side but beautifully appointed and impeccably clean. I appreciated the black out shades, which not only kept the early morning Barcelona sunlight out, but created a sound barrier from the busy street below. The bed was slightly on the hard side for my personal taste, but I did sleep comfortably and soundly. I loved the location of this hotel. I felt like I was right in the center of the action and could reasonably walk to many points of interest. Casa Battlo is right around the corner for example, and there was an array of restaurants and shops right nearby,The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and accommodating. I can't speak enough about the service at this hotel, The staff goes above and beyond to make their guests comfortable and accommodated. It did not go unnoticed and it was much appreciated. My only regret was only staying one night in this fantastic hotel. I highly recommend the Claris to anyone searching for a place to stay in Barcelona!",5,2016,08,07
19,A lovely stay with super staff,"Perfect location for exploring all that Barcelona has to offer. Third trip to the city and without doubt my favourite hotel.
Super breakfast, small but lovely pool and well appointed bathrooms with luxury brand toiletries.
Staff friendly, welcoming and extremely smiley, all 5 of our group are hoping to return soon!",5,2016,08,06
19,Enjoyed it every day,"it was all you would want in a hotel experience. Excellent reception, high quality beds and rooms, wonderful staff who made our visit of Barcelona a memorable visit. Will go back any time in the future. Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,05
19,Hotel Claris,We loved our stay at Hotel Claris.  The staff were friendly and accommodating.  Sometimes it's really difficult to find accommodation in Europe to fit two kids and adults.  The Jr. Suites here met all of the requirements!,5,2016,08,05
19,Hotel Claris Barcelona,"Lovely Hotel,reception was inviting. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.The room was large(standard) very spacious and clean,plenty of storage. Breakfast area had great views over the city. Great location as it was only a short 10 minute walk into to main square.",5,2016,08,05
19,"Great hotel, great service","Great location for easy walking to many sites and stores. Rooms are very good, with Egyptian antiques and super comfortable beds. Very quiet. Nice rooftop pool, though small, providing a great location for end of day cocktails. Superb service from all staff.",4,2016,08,04
19,Great location and service. Excellentl hotel,"We are a family of 4 traveling with the grandparents. The hotel location is perfect, walkable to any attraction. It is centrally located to any place in Barcelona that one would like to visit. The staff is very friendly, courteous and responsive to your needs. The recons are unique and spacious. The breakfast is not to be missed on the rooftop. I would highly recommend that you stay here if visiting Barcelona ",5,2016,08,03
19,Claris Hotel Review,"We had a wonderful time at the Claris.  The location is perfect!
Excellent stay!  I recommend it to travelers who want proximity to good food and to the known tourist attractions.

his was a mom/daughter trip and the hotel was perfect for planning and executing our travel 
plans.  The hotel staff was very accommodating and gracious.",5,2016,08,03
19,Brillent long weekend.!!,We was upgraded to a suite because it was my partners 30th birthday which was amazing.. we even received champagne.. the hotel staff couldn't be more helpful.. I would highly recommended this hotel...,5,2016,08,02
19,"Great location, beautiful hotel","We visited 2 weeks ago and stayed for 4 days/nights. (2 adults and 7 year old)

Good points:
•	Beautiful hotel
•	Fantastic location
•	Lovely roof top and swimming pool
•	Very comfortable beds
•	Clean and tidy, nicely decorated (Catalonian style)
•	Nice breakfast buffet at rooftop restaurant
•	FANTASTIC food/menu at Mr Kao (ground floor) nearly didn’t go as it looked empty but we were taken upstairs and it was fairly busy – they should advertise this place a little better, it’s so worth a visit!
•	Great room service, delicious food
•	Friendly/helpful staff
•	Small Mayan museum onsite

Negative points
•	Suite walkway too narrow and rooms too dark
•	No view
•	No welcome drink
•	No privacy in bathroom (no door), except for loo and shower but not great
•	Nowhere to hang towels or clothes to dry
•	Called reception for an iron – and one evening, none available
•	Not enough snack/lunch time eating options
•	Cooked breakfast sometimes cold
•	No dinner at the rooftop restaurant; fully booked every night – even tried to book the day before
•	Despite costing 25 euro, staff too keen for us to finish and leave at breakfast time
•	Only given one set of cutlery (knife, fork, spoon) for buffet breakfast – not adequate
•	Not enough space for many sun loungers -somebody got stroppy when I
beat them to one - doesn’t create the best atmosphere

Overall, this is a lovely hotel (with extremely comfortable beds), and we were surrounded by friendly guests of all ages and staff alike - I would highly recommend it as our stay was wonderful despite the set-backs but it would be great if the hotel could make improvements to some of the areas highlighted.

I would imagine little can be done with regard to the lack of sun loungers but we were mostly unaffected as we somehow got to the pool before they were all taken and there is other seating available on the rooftop. Our daughter thoroughly enjoyed her time in the pool every evening, she met a couple of other children and it never got really busy! It was nice to see a variety of people, from city workers to travellers, from family vacations to older and younger couples. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.",4,2016,08,02
19,We really like The Hotel Claris!,"Elegant, contemporary hotel with beautiful Mayan influences. Staff was attentive, helpful and friendly. 
Only shortcoming was bathroom with counter too small and difficult shower operation. Great location in classy, safe neighborhood. Easy walk to Sagrada Familia and other historic sites from the hotel.",5,2016,08,01
19,"Great location, for us didn't work out entirely","We were very pleased to find out that Hotel Claris accepted pets.  Finding a hotel with the perfect location that would take them, proved to be one of the most difficult tasks here in Barcelona. Another hotel that was willing to accept our dogs was Le Meridien, we were relieved we didn’t go for that option, LM is located in Las Ramblas, the busiest part of town. You won’t want to do that to your pets.

We were traveling with out pets because we were relocating to Spain.  

Since our stay was going to be more than a week, we decided to book one of the Gran Suite Duplex, thinking that we would have more space for the dogs and us to move freely as well to store all our luggage.

Not trying to find any fault at the hotel, specially after they took our pets, but there is some observations I would like to make for other travelers before booking this place.

Check-ins are at 2pm and 2pm only, not a minute earlier. It doesn’t matter whether you are arriving from a long evening fly from other continent. We were actually  only able to check in at 3pm, I understand that maybe it’s not the hotel’s fault but we must admit we were a bit annoyed by the indifference shown by the reception staff. Bare that in mind and maybe you won't hold anything against it for having to spend 5-7 hours walking around or finding places to sit (which was our case because we were with our dogs).

The suite is nicely decorated, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on, BUT, the layout is totally unpractical. Maybe it doesn’t matter if you are in for a short stay, but after the third day we were a bit frustrated for having to pay so much for a room that we could not use entirely.

The suite has  a duplex layout, the top area, were the TV and mini bar are located, you will hardly or never use it. It helped us having to keep the dogs away from the cleaning staff, but for no other reason you would have come upstairs.

You can see that lot of attention was paid to the décor, but I hate to admit that their intentions fail completely when looks don’t compensate for all the nonfunctional or nonexistent features.

The mirrors have this very old-vintage feeling, however after a few days, it’s a bit irritating not to be able to even put on your make-up properly. 
There is absolute no space where you can put your toiletries or belongings, so we ended up having to use only one sink and piled up all our stuff in the other.  
There are no hangers for the hand or bathroom towels, except one.  
Even though you have a nice rain shower, the glass cubicle is not built properly so you end up with a mess and having your bathroom flooded every time you use it. 
Even though the bathtub looked a like nice treat after such a long trip, there was water everywhere on the floor. Used it only once.

Breakfast is 25Euro, we founded a bit pricey so keep in mind that there is plenty of cafes around the corner. Unless, what you are really looking for is a breakfast buffet, then you should stick to Hotel Claris.

I would only  recommend this place for short stays and maybe not needing to overpay for a suite that doesn’t fulfill your expectations.",3,2016,07,31
19,Claris hotel Barcelona,"An amazing hotel with unique decor and a nice terrace by the pool on the roof top, the staff are friendly and the location is perfect next to a lot of tourist attractions I would recommend it to anyone",5,2016,07,29
19,"Amazing location, service that aims to please and DOES!!","Our travel agent set us up at the Claris and we were very very happy with her decision. The location is perfect. Walking distance to all major attractions and to basically everything in Barcelona if you are willing to walk!! For all the cheese and jam you will eat, walking is the best way to get around! What stood out to me was the amazing service. I had lots of questions before I arrived and Julia in concierge was beyond helpful and even called me in New Jersey to answer questions and help plan our trip. Once we arrived  Julia was happy to greet us and made us reservations and recommendations that were all commendable. When our flight arrived late and we missed our first tour, Julia took care of the paperwork and did the work to get a refund. She always greeted us with a smile and was happy to help with anything. When she wasn't at the concierge desk there were many other helpful and friendly faces to help too. Victoria, who greeted us with a warm smile and champagne, was very helpful and knowledge with destinations to dine at and areas to visit. Each time  we saw Victoria we ended up talking for a long time, as she is approachable, so friendly and has great expertise with this amazing city. 

We were in a junior suite and were appreciative of the extra space compared to a regular room. We spent each afternoon at the rooftop pool and restaurant. Although crowded it was always a nice spot to unwind. We wish there were more lounge areas to relax, but it is a city hotel so space is limited.  Each afternoon the waiter, Sem, was Courteous and efficient and aimed to please with a smile. The breakfasts on the roof were plentiful with many choices. All in all I highly recommend this hotel. This city is amazing and Claris hotel allowed us to enjoy it even more. ",5,2016,07,29
19,It was a perfect start to our month on honeymoon.," Our trip was excellent. The hotel staff was very efficient and courteous. The rooftop pool and cocktail area was a great way to end every night. And the location cannot be better. It was a perfect start to our month on honeymoon.",5,2016,07,26
19,"beautiful hotel, ideally located.","My experience has learned me that ***** hotels in Spain rarely deserve the five stars, if you compare with hotels in other parts of the world, that is. The Claris is no exception to that rule. Although almost everything was perfect, some minor details make that this hotel, in my opinion, should have 4,5 stars. The room we had was amazing. The bathroom could do with refurbishing and get rid of the royal bath tub and be replaced with a shower. Towels and robes seemed brand new and were oh so soft, a pleasure to wear them. During our stay we had major problems with the wifi system. This was not the responsibility of the hotel but staff failed to pass on this message towards their guests. At the reception desk, we (me and other guests) got a staff member who was telling us the wifi was working on his cell phone, so who were we to complain. (not done in a ***** hotel) After talking to the duty manager, we got word that the kubi network in BCN had had lots of problems over the last day or two and that everything was being done to solve the problem. The duty manager I met, did everything to make our stay a wonderful experience. I want to thank her for that. The rooftop bar, swimming pool and restaurant are fine. I was under the impression that the Claris was employing more students than they should. Sometimes that would lead to uncomfortable situations.
We will definitely go back to the Claris, next time we visit BCN. The hotel is ideally located to visit the city. It has tremendous little restaurants nearby and I am sure that all the minor inconveniences we encountered had a lot to do with murphy's law. When one thing goes bad, a lot of other things follow.....",4,2016,07,26
19,Beautiful Hotel in a quiet area of Central Barcelona,"This is my second time staying at the Claris and the charm of the hotel is still there. The hotel is filled with spectacular artifacts that are in every room, the breakfast consists of a wide range of delicious food, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel is spotless and the rooms are beautiful but i found that one of the rooms i stayed in with my parents felt more like a picture rather than a practical room that could be lived in by three people (However, the beds are very comfortable regardless). My biggest issue with the hotel is the Air-conditioning, It is too high in my opinion and made me feel like I was walking into a freezer when I roamed about the hotel.",5,2016,07,25
19,Mr Hill,"We just spent a long weekend at the Claris hotel, and generally had a great time although there are some down sides. We booked a double room but ended up with two single beds pushed together which spread apart as you move about. The bedding was also single fitted not what you expect from a top class hotel. A kettle and coffee/tea making facilities would also have been nice. The pool bar is also very expensive. 

On the plus side the staff are great, very helpful. The Hotel is well situated especially for shopping, and within walking distance of most of the sightseeing places of interest but once you have walked there and back a few times you will need to use public transport (about 10 Euros to the marina one way). ",4,2016,07,25
19,Super Break,"Great 4 days in Barcelona. Hotel very good with excellent staff. Ideal location for seeing the sights.
Excellent breakfasts on the roof terrace. The swimming pool was also a very pleasant addition to the trip.",5,2016,07,25
19,Elegant hotel in a quiet yet central location.,"This is our second stay at the Claris and we absolutely love it. 
The staff are fantastic, the interior design is very stylish but not over the top and the rooms are very comfortable and plush. 
The location is perfect as you are a few corners away from great shopping and restaurants yet the setting is peaceful and quiet.
Highly recommended!",5,2016,07,22
19,Overnight in Barcelona,We only stayed one night at the Hotel Claris before leaving on a cruise but the hotel was excellent.  The location was good and the staff very helpful. We would definitely go back and recommend to family/friends.,5,2016,07,21
19,An amazing mini break,We planned this trip to Barcelona and used hotel Claris as a base because it was so centrally located in a very nice part of the city! Immaculately clean and staff were amazing even to booking restaurants for us! The hotel is like a museum and rooms are so clean and fresh! Would definitely stay at this hotel again!!!! ,5,2016,07,16
19,Nice place,"Stayed here while seeing bacelona for the first time. The rooms are very nice, location great for sight seeing, rooms cleaned regularly and the staff very friendly. I stayed for 4 nights and had a good time here.",5,2016,07,15
19,Excellent boutique hotel ,"I have stayed at the Claris many times. It is a relatively sizable boutique hotel well located in Barcelona. The rooms are of a high standard and individually and beautifully decorated. The food is excellent, especially the lunch on the lovely little roof terrace overlooking the city.  Service is helpful without being overbearing.  I travel reasonably extensively with my work and I'm always happy to return here. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,07,14
19,Fantastic Hotel,"We have just returned from a fabulous four day stay in the Claris Hotel where we all had a wonderful time.    There were twenty-five in our group, including two small children.  The hotel staff were all exceptionally helpful and efficient and made us feel very welcome.  At check-in we were offered complimentary cava and then showed to our spacious, modern and comfortable rooms.  The automatic black-out blinds, super comfortable mattresses and sumptuous pillows ensured a restful sleep.  We also loved the buffet breakfast where there was a great choice, delicious freshly squeezed orange juice and lots of quality coffee.
We also had a very enjoyable and relaxed meal in the private dining room on the hotel’s rooftop terrace which has amazing views over Barcelona - a memorable experience for us.
This hotel offers great value for money in a central location and the staff were very patient in answering our many questions.  In particular, Clement and the reception team, led by Sven deserve a special mention. Thank you.

We would definitely return to the Claris given the opportunity to do so.",5,2016,07,13
19,Dissapointing,Based on the trip advisor reviews I read before arriving at Hotel Claris I was really looking forward to my stay. Sadly despite the very nice surroundings and friendly staff my visit was disappointing. A complimentary upgrade turned into a disaster meaning that 2 out of our 3 nights were spent in a room with its very own high pitched noise [ unresolved ] and unintentional strobing lights in the bathroom.. Far too many gimmicks in the room and not enough practical things like a wardrobe to hang your clothes. To be fair the Hotel relocated us to a top range room for our last night but by then our enthusiasm for the hotel had gone.,3,2016,07,13
19,Great stay,"We had two groups in at the Claris and I would like to compliment the staff for their excellent service. They were always happy to assist and accommodate our every need.
The hotel is well situated and everyone loved the rooftop bar.
Rooms are not huge but very elegantly decorated and has everything you need.",4,2016,07,13
19,Hmmm,"We spent 5 nights st the Claris much was good but not great ... Room pleasant but Dark, bathroom good but dark and no fan.
Swimming pool very small with only 6 yes 6 (six) loungers ..watching peoples disappointment when they come up to the rooftop and there is no where to lounge is just upsetting as the rooftop terrace is great as a bar.  ",2,2016,07,11
19,Excellent Hotel,"If you like a smaller hotel then you wont get one better than this. The roof top pool is a really nice sanctuary in the middle of a busy city. The rooftop restaurant provides a very reasonable lunch time set menu. There are a number of little touches that really make the experience, for example the hotel provides free water and juice in the reception area. ",5,2016,07,11
19,Fantastic Hotel,This hotel exceeded our expectations in every aspect. Would absolutely recommend! The staff went out of their way to make sure our every need was met. The rooftop pool was perfect. The rooftop restaurant was superb.,5,2016,07,10
19,Everything very good,"Clean hotel,
Great breakfast, with possibility to orders many extras, at no cost.
Nice rooms.
Nice staff, 
Central in Barcelona, close to shopping, and a nice district. 
To the beach it is ca. 2 kilometer, so the alternativ would have been a hotel there, but then it wold have been long to the shopping. We took taxi everywhere anyway, at nice prices.

We will use this hotel again.

We will use it agan.",5,2016,07,10
19,TERRIBLE WI-FI!!!,"We are staying at this hotel and the wi-fi is awful!! We spoke to 2 people at the front desk as well as a local tech help but problem was unresolved and no follow-up was done from the hotel. This is our 5th hotel in Spain and the only one where the wi-fi was below standard even unusable. For an upper scale hotel (almost 300 Euros a night), it should be a given that you'll be provided with premium wi-fi service or at best one that works well enough that you can actually surf the Internet without getting disconnected every 10 minutes. I understand that things happen but how you resolve the issue is what determines whether or not I will stay at the hotel again and in this case, the hotel was not helpful and did not in my opinion do everything  they can to resolve the issue. We also met another couple in the hotel that said they also had the same experience as us. Although the hotel was nice in a good location, I would not recommend this hotel, not worth the money if you can't even get basic wi-fi service.",1,2016,07,10
19,Terrible Wifi - Part 2,"My wife already reviewed this hotel, but I felt it deserved a second review. We paid nearly 300 euros per night, and the room was advertised as offering ""premium wifi"", which unfortunately was unusable. I was unable to do my work in the room, nor FaceTime our kids. The hotel doesn't acknowledge  the issue, doesn't accept responsibility, nor was it willing to provide solutions. They outsource their guest internet services to a local provider (Kubi) using satellite connectivity, so adding an extra router wouldn't have solved anything. When we complained to the hotel, they connected us on the phone with a representative from Kubi, who was totally useless. Although the hotel is reasonably nice (as should be expected at that price point), I would avoid this hotel if you require wifi for any reason. We talked to other guests in the hotel and they had the same issue, so this was not an isolated incident. This was our 4th hotel during our visit to Spain, and the first time we experience this kind of problem.",1,2016,07,10
19,Great Hotel in a great location. ,"We stayed here Four nights and the staff was courteous and very friendly. Room service was exceptionally fast and they have a very nice roof deck restaurant with pool.  A nice place to sit by the pool or have drinks and watch the sun set. 

The rooms are very clean, narrow and long. Because the rooms face the street the noise can be a slight distraction. They have black out blinds on the exterior of the Windows which do a great job of blocking out the light but you still have to contend with the noise from the street. 

Not expensive and everything is very reasonably priced. The location of the hotel is ideal for some Great shopping. 

Had a very nice stay and would recommend. 

PS
Take a walk down the block to the Majestic hotel and go to their roof deck for some panoramic views of Barcelona including a very nice view of Basilica di familia. ",5,2016,07,06
19,"Great location, wonderful service.","Hotel Claris is in a great location - walking distance to everything but just out of the tourist fray so you feel like you're experiencing authentic Barcelona.  The service was outstanding - their guest services desk made all of our restaurant reservations in advance our our arrival (we communicated via email) and it was seamless.  Plus, they made a few great recos too. The room has blackout blinds so it's pitch dark when you sleep with no road noise.  Stayed in a Junior Deluxe room and it was great. A very comfy double bed (great mattress) with lots of pillows and it was nice to have the upstairs area to watch TV, eat room service snacks, etc. The bathrooms had great privacy too -- with double sinks, a shower & bathtub!  The wifi worked flawlessly. The rooftop terrace was a perfect place to unwind after sightseeing - there's a bar, restaurant & small pool.  Even though it got filled with people at times (especially late afternoon), there was room enough for everyone - both sun-worshippers & those who prefer the shade alike.  Highly recommend this hotel.  We'll be back for sure.",5,2016,07,06
19,excellent place to stay and within easy walking distance of the main shopping area,"Wow what an excellent choice of hotel. From the moment we arrived until we departed, the staff from doorman to room service and all the others in between were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough. This was a hotel in a great location and was only one block from passage de Garcia which connects with La Rambla. the walk time from hotel to the end of La Rambla down near the port is around 1hr. there are plenty of shops along the way as well as places to eat or just have coffee. The fresh fruit , vegetables, meat and seafood market at the start of La Rambla is well worth the visit. You cannot go past the hop on hop off bus to get an overall view on Barcelona. the Red bus is the better of the two companies.",5,2016,07,06
19,Simply Amazing Experience!!!,"My family and I stayed at Hotel Claris for five nights in one of the junior suites. I generally do not write reviews on trip advisor but this experience was so amazing that I felt I had to let you know our experience.  I will break up my review into three categories: location, quality of the property, and service.
LOCATION: The location in L'Eixample is fantastic.  It is within 10-15 minute walking distance to every place in town (La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera , Casa Battllo, Passeig de Gracia, Las Ramblas, La Catedral etc.).
PROPERTY: The hotel is maintained impeccably cleanly. The deck and the swimming pool on the 7th floor are pretty cool.  On one of the mornings (Friday, I believe), they even offered unlimited champagne in the lobby.
SERVICE: I saved the best for the last. The service at the hotel is superb. Mr. Ricardo, the front office manager, is just awesome. By mistake, we left $335.00 and a credit card in our room, checked out, and left for the airport. Knowing Barcelona, we thought we lost it all. Instead, Mr. Ricardo, took the cash, gave us credit on our credit card account and destroyed the card! The world runs because of good people like Ricardo. 

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,06
19,Quality Hotel in great Barcelona location.,"Comfortable, clean and well located 5 star Barcelona hotel. Extremely pleasant and knowledgeable front desk staff assisted us in selecting places to visit and in many cases, booked timed tickets on line on our behalf. Small swimming pool on roof terrace is a pleasant place to be after a long hot day wandering the fabulous sites of this great city. ",5,2016,07,05
19,Excellent choice for Barcelona!,"The Hotel is located in a very good location, quiet street but very close to everything ! Staff very friendly! Rooms very comfortable! Roof top with a great view!!
Despite I did not found a seat in the main restaurant we had dinner at the bar and they were very kind to prepare a special meal for my daughter that was sick!",5,2016,07,04
19,Beautiful hotel,"I could not fault the staff. They were kind, helpful, and brilliant at theirs jobs from the porter to the reception staff to the bar men. The hotel is stunning and the roof terrace a lovely place to enjoy drinks. The welcome drink and free entry to the Egyptian museum were nice touches. There is one simple reason I have given this hotel 4 and not 5 star rating. They have no irons and no immediate ironing facility. I have no issue with the hotel charging for an ironing service but if it has no self service facility then there must be a quick option. We stayed only one night following a cruise. We had a special dinner that night and a special brunch the following day. However we had zero option to get clothes pressed. I understand this is relatively typical in Spain but in the UK it isn't. If there had been irons and boards to borrow or a 2 hour pressing facility then this review would have been five stars. Thank you for a lovely stay provided by amazing top class staff.   ",4,2016,07,04
19,Simply Perfect,"We had a wonderful extended weekend at the Hotel Claris, Barcelona. The location is perfect for shopping, eating at great restaurants and experiencing Barcelona's many cultural icons including those created by Gaudi. I stayed at the hotel with my two teenage children  - the hotel is small enough that it caters for both families and couples. The pool area is small but arranged so that you feel that you have your own private space. The staff are professional and friendly. We have high praise for all of the front of house/guest relations teams, pool bar team and the restaurant staff. The food we had was exceptional - in fact our best meal of the holiday was at the roof top restaurant. As a side note, they have the best pillow chocolates I have ever had! If you are looking for a treat in Barcelona - this is it! I would highly recommend the Hotel Claris.",5,2016,07,04
19,Paradise in a busy city,"Couldn't fault a thing great location, helpful friendly staff, amazing accommodation very modern and extremely clean. Loved the roof top bar, can't wait to return.
Pure luxury and great value for money.",5,2016,07,04
19,Excelent choice for Barcelona!!,"This is an Excellent Hotel in and very good location! 
Very nice roof top! 
Great accommodations 
Very friendly front desk staff!!
An excellent choice for Barcelona 
I will certainly recommend and say again",5,2016,07,03
19,Short business trip,"The Ambience of that very central located hotel was as it was promised. It was a very relaxing stay with good food and a full breakfast . The rooms were in good condition and very clean. Everything in barcelona was in walking distance. The parking is valet parking or : just drop the key and everything will be taken care off. The Reception was very friendly and everything was done to perfection sometimes without asking.
3",5,2016,07,03
19,Barca in a weekend,"Fantastic Hotel in a great  location. Rooftop cocktail bar has great views and  a must after a long day sight seeing. 

Minor gripe was checkin. We arrived around 230pm on a sat, it appeared that a large group had left with some of them  still wandering about moaning about their delay, this meant a lot of rooms were being cleaned. Our checking process seemed overlong and then we were told it was a further 45mins til our room would be ready. So we wandered the streets to get a flavor of the tow and returned after an hr. 

After another wait, we got our room, however our travel partners was not ready. In recompense they were given a couple of cocktail vouchers, nice touch. 

Our room on the 6th floor had great views and was very nicely styled. It even had a mini museum exhibit in its own glass case. Blackout blinds were closed as part of the evening turndown service ( a bit of a surprise when you awake! and cant find the up switch). 

In contrast to the slow checkin, the breakfast service was top notch, and the food served was tremendous. 

Checkout was fast and painless, and on leaving we were offered the hotel minibus at a lower rate than the local cabs, very slick. Would definitely recommend.",4,2016,07,02
19,4 nights in Barca,"Initial experience a bit confounding. Although our reservation was confirmed more than 2 months before and we had given details of our arrival, I got an email whilst I was enroute that there was a problem with our reservation. I frantically had to call the hotel and send emails and eventually the 'problem' was resolved. On arrival reception did not offer any explanation or apologies and after a very long flight I didn't intend to pursue this. From then on our stay was very good. The hotel is in a very good location. The room was spacious though I found it a bit dark, but I think that's how it was meant to be.

The staff were fantastic and the breakfast was superb. Reception gave us good tips on restaurants, sights and shopping tips.",4,2016,07,01
19,It felt like home,"This is our second stay at Hotel Claris and again it did not disappoint.  Despite the higher price, the quality of the rooms and all of the service people was exceptional.  The rooftop pool, bar, and restaurant was beautiful in the evening with the Mediterranean breeze.  Its central location made getting around most of Barcelona very easy.  If you are willing to spend a little more, it is a great hotel to consider.",5,2016,06,30
19,2 nights in Barcelon,Had a fantastic time at the beautiful hotel. We were on the third floor and although the view from the room wasn't the best the actual room and hotel was perfect. There was a roof top bar that we used both nights and the service was excellent. We ate up here too and the food was delicious. Once it had got a little colder we were offered blankets to keep us warm. There was also a pool on this level. There was a bottle of water waiting for us in the room and the hotel was just stunning overall with great service. Really enjoyed my stay here. ,5,2016,06,30
19,Family of 6 adults from Oslo,Lovely hotel in a great location. The hotel staff were very helpful. We ate at 3 different restaurants during our stay that the hotel had suggested. Fantastic food at all of them. I would recommend this hotel to others. Can also recommend Cafe Emma for breakfast as the hotel breakfast was rather pricey.,5,2016,06,27
19,Thank you! Great visit,"Thank you to manager Jose Fernandez who personally introduced himself to us on check in and provided every comfort to us during our stay.

Check in was fast and efficient, the staff were friendly and polite. As an extra treat for our 10th wedding anniversary, we were upgraded to a junior suite!

The decor was fantastic, very eclectic and sleek. The room was clean and tidy, and the bathroom well appointed and stocked with The White Company toiletries.

Housekeeping came in daily of course, but always found the time we were out, they had the knack of slipping in and cleaning our room at the right time.

The terrace pool was lovely and refreshing.

Did not dine in the attached restaurant Mr Kao but it looked very good.

The breakfast room although in the basement was light and airy, a great selection of cereals, breads, fruit, cheeses, meats and yogurts.

All in all a very comfortable stay at the Hotel Claris!",4,2016,06,26
19,A great find...,"A wonderful place in the heart of Barcelona. Half way to everywhere and away from the touristy areas. Fabulous front desk, great rooms, great roof top bar and nice swimming pool. What more could you ask for?",5,2016,06,26
19,Wow - what a big room!,"For a hotel in Europe, the room was huge!  Tons of closet space and the bath was gorgeous with big comfy robes and high end amenities.  The decor was interesting and the hotel itself is beautiful.  The only drawback was that the bed was too firm for my liking.",4,2016,06,23
19,high quality stay,"a perfect hotel situated in a nice aerea.  staff without any exception well trained and friendly
roof top bar a must.

highly recommended  rooms a dreamto saty in  lots af fine art  everything you wish on business and pleasure is available.

staff speaks well english   and no request is too much",5,2016,06,23
19,Best Holiday ever.. Amazing !!! ;-),"That was my best Holiday ever. Best Hotel, best Service, best Restaurant, nice Rooftop, nice Staff´s... I´ll come back as soon as possible. Bock this Hotel and enjoy your Time in Barcelona... Great ;-)",5,2016,06,23
19,Junior Suite,"Honestly can't say enough good stuff about this hotel, from the moment we got out the car we were treated like VIP's and not a single member of staff was not lovely and helpful. The hotel is exquisite and the fragrance in all the halls and our room was beautifully done. 
We had room service once and it was Devine. The whirlpool bath was to die for, it actually made me sight see less as we spent so much time in it. 
There is nothing to improve on this hotel, well worth the price. ",5,2016,06,21
19,WOW,"Just come back from our 3 night break in Barcelona, we stayed at Hotel Claris and I can honestly say it's the best hotel I have ever stayed in from the moment to we arrived to the moment we left the staff where excellent and the hotel is beautiful. 

On arrival we where offered a complimentary drink a choice of hot, non alcoholic and a glass of Cava which I thought was a nice tough. Check in was very fast and we where showed to our room by the porter who showed us how to use everything which was a nice touch. 

The room was a good size with good size bathroom and a very nice bed which was very comfortable we had a view of the front of the hotel. The room includes coffee machine, tv, mini bar, safe, free wifi and wardrobe. Our was the standard room but was very impressed and ample for what we needed for our stay.

We didn't used the restaurants in the hotel as we liked to explorer the city, we did use the roof top bar for a cocktail really nice views of the city worth a drink up their €15 for a cocktail which is personally thought was good value.

The hotel is in walking distance of bars n restaurants. 40mins walk to marina which is a nice walk n la rambles is 20mins walk. Sagrada Familia is 30mins walk but there are taxis outside the hotel and it cost €6 to get there via taxi which is cheap.

We really enjoyed our stay and will defiantly be back in the future!",5,2016,06,19
19,Incredible service!,"My fiance and I recently visited Barcelona and the service received at Hotel Claris was phenomenal. The staff where friendly and go out of their way to make you feel special (it was my birthday) and assist you with anything you may need. The guest relations staff, Julia, was extremely helpful with recommending shows and restaurants which where authentic spanish and helped us avoid the overly touristic spots. Room and bathroom finishes where very modern and will suit a fussy traveller well! ",5,2016,06,19
19,Brilliant hotel,"Brilliant hotel, nice comfortable rooms, rooftop pool a bar with nice cocktails. very friendly staff, who can't do enough for you. The complimentary drink on arrival was a nice touch. Will be staying again. ",5,2016,06,17
19,Great Hotel for preboarding a Cruise. Excellent Staff.,Stayed 3 nights prior to boarding a cruise in May/2016.  Very modern and spacious room. The whole experience was 5-star except the hard mattress and foam pillows detracted somewhat.  Wi-Fi included.  110 volt connections provided for USA customers.   Location could not have been better.  Walking distance to La Segrada Familia and other locations.  From this hotel a 5-7Euro taxi ride took us to any area desired for our first trip to Barcelona.  Superb roof top restaurant with views.,4,2016,06,14
19,Great location at Barcelona ,"Great location at heart of Barcelona. Stayed here for 3 nights for sight seeing. Helpful staff. You get cava, orange juice at lobby all day. Good breakfast for two days. We had over 100 people on tour groups on Saturday and it was madness. Few staff, long queue. Poor food. Great the next two mornings with no tour groups. 
Good clean pool at roof top. 
Clean room. Good bed. ",4,2016,06,13
19,It was a great hotel,"Convenience to the subway is also good , it was the best there is delicious shops also nearby. Orange juice was the best also was the all you can drink . It was changed you many times . Breakfast is the best also delicious .

",5,2016,06,12
19,A hotel offering style & class,"I recently stayed at this hotel with family and booked two superior rooms and a junior suite.

The hotel is impressive, with high standards throughout.

Staff could not do more to make our stay enjoyable; they truly care about protecting and improving the hotels excellent reputation. They accommodated various requests for my family including a late check out, which was very much appreciated.

The superior rooms were good, though not fully soundproof. This was fine for us, as we were prepared & accepting of this  given our short stay, in a central city location, within a historical building.

The suite for my mother was fully sound proof, however, and was very impressive. The bathroom included a jacuzzi bath and steam room shower!

Would definitely recommend & stay again.",5,2016,06,10
19,Great location!,"I enjoyed our stay at this hotel a lot. Great location, very convenient to restaurants and metro. Glass of cava while you check in is nice touch. The rooftop terrace bar was great. The room had very comfortable beds and bedding and the bathroom was nice. Would stay here again.",5,2016,06,10
19,Our regular hotel,"We visit Barcelona a few times a year. Whether we choose to stay here for a few nights or just visit the rooftop bar as we are passing through, this is one of our favourites.
Staff are always helpful and welcoming and the doorman has recommended us some amazing places to eat and visit.
Rooms are clean and large but do vary on the details dependant on cost but have never been disappointed.",5,2016,06,10
19,Hotel Amenities,"Great location in Barcelona for the sights. Breakfast in the basement, not the best views! Good rooftop pool and restaurant. Good front desk staff, very helpful with restaurant recommendations and places to get to. Comfortable rooms but no kettle and tea or coffee making facilities in room. ",4,2016,06,09
19,short break,"had a wonderful time staying at the Claris Hotel , staff were fantastic, very central to shops, retaurants & train station. The bar / swimming pool on roof top, was very relaxing & a great way to relax.",5,2016,06,09
19,ONLY THREE  DAYS,"Sadly just three days available in Barcelona, much more time is needed here.
The people, not just at the Claris, but right through the city were so friendly and very helpful to tourists.We did a walking tour with Viatour, an absolute must to see the main sights, then you can spend days just walking the city revisiting the places that really interested you (pretty much all the places). The gardens and everything to do with GAUDI.",5,2016,06,08
19,A gem in the middle of Barcelona,"Do you remember the last time you came to the hotel that exceeded your expectations in every single aspect of the service provided? No? Well in that case you better book yourself to Hotel Claris in Barcelona. Claris is such unique place in Barcelona, the staff is so friendly and go way beyond the necessary to make you happy. I really enjoyed the deco of our Duplex suite, the rooftop swimming pool is the best place to hang out in the afternoon, the breakfast selection is absolutely mervelous. But now I am just being materialistic. The best thing about Claris are the staff - always smiling, always welcoming, always happy to please, no is not an answer. Thank you Claris for your hospitality, we will definitley be back. Well done you!",5,2016,06,08
19,Anniversary treat,"We had an amazing stay at The Claris. The hotel from top to bottom was immaculately clean, modern, luxurious touches everywhere. The staff could not do enough for everyone and not just us. Polite, friendly and looked after everyone they encountered. Very professional team. We loved our stay and would recommend it to anyone. ",5,2016,06,06
19,Brief stop prior to a Cruise,"We arrived early to the hotel due to early flight  from America. Our room was not ready but  the front lobby staff make it enjoyable to wait. They provided orange juice, champagne or coffee wile we waited for our room. The lobby was very nice to hang out in. Because we had to wait a couple of hours for our room they upgraded us to the Junior Sweet. The hotel was remodeled in the last couple of years ago and it shows. The hotel location was great it was in the heart of the town about 2 blocks to the La Rambles area. The hotel had a restaurant on the top floor and a pool on the top floor. It didn't have a hot tub unfortunately. But, the view of the city make up for it. They had a work out room on the highest floor of the hotel over looking the city as well. The food was good at the Restaurant we had dinner at. The rooms where reasonably priced. They provided breakfast in their restaurant in the basement area of the hotel for a charge. It was a buffet breakfast and was good. And again reasonably priced. The bathroom had a separate tub and separate shower but the shower was very small just like the toilet area. But, the common area of the bathroom was roomy. They had two T.V's in the suite one for the bedroom and one for the other room of the suite. We where given a room that looked out the back of the hotel and was quite. View was not interesting but how much time do you spend looking out the window of a hotel. They had 3 elevators so getting to your room was never a problem. The hotel sure exceeded my expectations. I just wish they where closer to my home so I could visit them more often. They had a nice looking banquet room on the top floor across from the restaurant. ",5,2016,06,05
19,Great team but so so facility,"Evaluating this hotel is not simple. On one hand we met a wonderful team. Attentive and ready to help and service at all times. On the other hand,, the facility was intriguing. Rooms were small, missing a desk and a chair (a couch is nice but not instead), missing a simple coffee machine (but free coffe in the lobbi) . Bed was comfortable and all the decoration was very modern (almost too modern when the sink in the washroom is a meter long and not very esthetic to use). A big shower but not one bar to hold on to.  Our room was an ""inner room"" which means no window to the outside but a ""window"" into the lobby which makes the room visible to every person who walks by in the hallways; thus the curtain had to be down at all times. I did not want to stay in the room other than for sleeping, which is the definition of a bad room. Breakfast was ok but again, not to the level of such a high-star hotel, selection was pretty miniml, scrambled eggs had an  ""industrial"" taste.  I am not familiar with other hotels in Barcelona but for the price of the room I had way higher expectations.",3,2016,06,04
19,comfortable,I suggest everyone the Claris. Rooms are very claen. The price is a bit high. The stuffs are excelent. Location is perfect. I want to speak my check in proses. I arrived 13:30 but our rooms did not ready. We can use our rooms at 16:00.,4,2016,06,02
19,Visit to Barcelona,"The room was nicely decorated and had two sinks in the bathroom.  However, the room was not set up for two people with large suitcases.  We were at the hotel for 3 nights and did not want to unpack.  So, we had to use the sofa, the only sitting area in the room, to accommodate one of the suitcases.  Also, the bathtub was dangerous for older individuals.  It was quite deep and had to be stepped into with no safety bar to hold onto.",3,2016,05,30
19,Claris in Barcelona,"Lovely business hotel with very comfortable rooms and great rooftop bar.  Superb service and when I said there was no tea in my room, I am English after all, they made me a pot and brought it to me as complimentary room service. ",5,2016,05,29
19,"The Best, from the Doorman up!!","The Claris was one of the better hotels I've stayed in!   Your service was, from Pancho, the Doorman to Sylvia, who delivered our daily room service breakfast.!  Joana, from reception, I don't know what we would have done without her helpful service and suggestions.  She is a great asset to your hotel.  Our first room was very nice but there was no closet space for two ladies.  Victoria, who couldn't have been nicer, switched our room, it was much bigger, but still no closet space or no bureaus or dressers either.  That would be my only complaint.  I would recommend this hotel for it's wonderful staff, great location, and the cleanliness everywhere.  Also loved our free welcome drinks at the pool bar.  Awesome..!!",5,2016,05,28
19,Nice business trip,"Lovely bit of luxury  on a business trip. This is a lovely hotel in the centre of Barcelona. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are beautiful. Sadly I didn't  get much time for breakfast so only grabbed coffee and a pastry but lunch was lovely by the pool.  I can't comment on value as I have no idea of the price but it was a lovely stay. 
",5,2016,05,28
19,Fabulous Hotel,"We had a corner room that faced an inner courtyard; not a picturesque view, but we weren't concerned with that, preferring to have quiet instead. For the view, head up to the roof, where there's a swimming pool, a restaurant, and a bar. We appreciated our warm welcome and the cava that went with it. The concierge was extremely helpful, getting us tickets to Casa Batllo, Park Guell and the Picasso Museum. She also advised on bus routes and restaurants and cafes. Breakfast at the hotel is expensive, if you're not traveling on an expense account, so we were able to find three excellent cafes nearby serving coffee and pastries. A real treat is to spend your final night in Barcelona up on the rooftop terrace, listening to the hum of the city and admiring the views of the gracious buildlngs in the area. We had cafe Americans and a local brandy--not cheap--but what a memory. The hotel is steps away from high-end shopping on the Passeig de Gracia and within walking distance of many excellent restaurants in every price range. Our room was very comfortable, with ample storage and luxurious bathroom amenities. Fragrant incense burns in the corridor, and there's a small athletic area for fitness buffs if you haven't done your share of walking in Barcelona. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone coming to the city. You won't be disappointed.",5,2016,05,25
19,Best Hotel I've Stayed In !! ,"I've read some of the reviews on this hotel (the terrible and poor ones) and they are completely lies ! Went to this hotel only for a night after being further down the coast in Spain (cambrills) and I can honestly say that even though we only stayed 1 night it was one of the best hotel experience I have ever had ! 
When we first checked in (me my friend and my parents) we found that our rooms were quite far appart and with one word to the reception desk we were moved into 2 connecting rooms facing out of the hotel seeing everything you would want to see in the city of Barcelona the rooms were not cluttered and the decor was just so lovley for me it's the little touches that count for example slippers and dressing gouns with no extra charge,loads of shampoos & conditioners (different types to fit your needs) rooms were so so so nice and the beds were so comfy and easy to relax in ! We spent most of our time in the city of Barcelona but still had time to use the roof top pool witch was lovley and clean don't listen to the bad reviews of this hotel and book it if you want a lovley relaxing time in Barcelona also would just like to say that it's ideal if your wanting to go into the he city as its only a 10 minute walk from the hotel ! 10/10 ",5,2016,05,25
19,Nice,"Nice hotel in a good position, just don't stay in our room, 301, it was very noisy during the night, especially when you switch the air con off. Apart from that staff are very friendly and accomadating, and the hotel is in a perfect position to visit places",4,2016,05,24
19,A Great Hotel in the Heart of the City,"This place came recommended by a friend who lives in Barcelona so that is always a good start, it is a great place, and well situated, almost equidistant from everything you would want to see.  The bar on the roof is fabulous with excellent Saville Gin!  The staff are probably one of the friendliest I have ever encountered and couldn't do enough to help us...they even gave us recommendations on the best skate spots, and I don't think there is another 5 Star hotel in the world that would do that! We will be back.",5,2016,05,23
19,Perfect!,"Visited Barcelona for first time, a birthday pressie from my step daughter who I went with. Perfect location wonderful hotel beautiful room. Spotlessly clean.  Roof top pool bar area perfect. Loved my stay at this hotel that was just a 10/15 min walk from La Rambla. We had an amazing 4 days here and visited everything there was to visit we did two days of hop on hop off bus tours well worth the money that we got on at end of road from hotel.  Staff at hotel very friendly and helpful. Drinks expensive but that's what u expect in City hotel.  Would highly recommend. We didn't have breakfast here but plenty of nearby places. ",5,2016,05,22
19,I ll be back,"A hotel situated in a very cozy area of Barcelona, walking distance to wherever you are going.
Impeccable service, friendly and smiling staff and a breakfast to die for.
I will definitely  stay here again and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona",5,2016,05,22
19,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","After scouting for ages looking for a hotel to stay at for our returning trip to Barcelona we decided to give Hotel Claris a go as the location seemed ideal! We were not wrong. We stayed here for 4 nights and the hotel was beautiful. I loved the smell of the incense in the hallways. All the staff, from the doormen to the reception staff to the maids always greeted you with a smile and were happy to help with anything. We had a room with a street facing view on the 5th floor and the noise was always minimal, especially with having another door to the bedroom itself shut at night. I also loved having the blackout blind and the bed was massive and really comfortable! The AC was also quiet which meant myself and my boyfriend both slept really well! The walk to the main shopping street and also Placa de Catalunya and las ramblas was an ideal distance. Plenty of things to see along the way with the La Pedrera being 5 minutes away. The rooftop terrace had some great views of the Barcelona streets, an ideal place to people watch with a cocktail in hand. We never ate in the restaurant but it looked clean with attentive staff. Very glad we chose to stay here, thank you very much! ",5,2016,05,22
19,"Luxury hotel, great location, warm staff --- what's not to like?","This was our third stay at Hotel Claris in Barcelona --- and we keep coming back for the excellent location (on Pau Claris and Valencia, about midway between La Ramblas and Sagrada Familia), luxury/funky feel, and what may be the friendliest staff we have met. From Juana at reception, to the dining room manager at their very nice breakfast, to the warm smile and handshake from my favorite doorman --- this place just makes you feel welcome. What's not to like!",5,2016,05,22
19,A hidden gem!,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Claris in Barcelona for a fun week with friends. It was a pleasure to be surrounded by such obliging, efficient and friendly people. The rooms were tastefully done and soo comfortable. The Chinese restaurant and the Mediterranean restaurant on the rooftop was a perfect way to relax with great food and ambiance. 
Gaudi architecture was a 5 min walk away as was the shopping and tapas. Ideally located for a bit of everything and away from grunge. 
I will come back to this glorious city and Claris will be hosting me again!!",5,2016,05,18
19,A bit of luxury in a great location,"We had a very enjoyable stay four night stay here , the hotel is really well placed , quiet yet within walking distance of everything . Rooms very comfortable with all the touches you would expect from a hotel of this standard . Breakfast was really good , and particularly the service . Would definitely use the Claris again in Barca .",5,2016,05,18
19,"Barcelona is great, the Claris makes the experience even better","Great Location: easy access to public transport but you hardly need that because Taxis in B. are very reasonable.
Staff always helpful, including assisting us when we experienced a medical emergency: The nearby English speaking pharmacist was a gem, and prevented a doctor's or ER visit.
An almost historic building converted into a slightly quirky but well functioning hotel; interesting decor varies in each room. Great breakfast buffet.",5,2016,05,18
19,Well-positioned luxury.,"We spent 3 nights here at themed of a 10 day visit to Spain, having spent the first days on Mallorca. This hotel is very well appointed and has very helpful and courteous staff. We were offed a nice glass of cava as we checked in as a welcome drink which is a nice touch.
The lobby is grand and features modern chunky leather chairs and sofas and has coffee and mimosas on offer. 
Our room was very nicely appointed with a small foyer separating the entrance from the main room which could be closed off using the sliding pocket doors. The bed was comfortable and large. There was a modern leather love seat with cushions to perch on. There were many different lighting options in the room accentuating the black and gold decor. The windows both in the room and bathroom had electronic blackout shutters which are amazing when you want to have a mid afternoon nap: just close the shutters and you are in a cool dark cave! 
The bathroom was also nice and had a full oval soaking tub/shower combo, and a toilet with an accompanying bidet. It should be noted that this tub was slightly dangerous to step out of as it was too wide to step over the edge and required a person to step onto a wet slope in order to get out of the shower. This could be a serious fall hazard for an older person and should be addressed by management. I'm not sure if all the rooms have this oval tub/shower but if they do it's a hazard so check. Our room was an odd pie shape and in the center of the hall and this tub might be particular to those rooms so ask if you have mobility issues when it comes to bathing.
The room had a Nespresso similar to our own, and we LOVE being able to make our own fresh coffee in the room. They also provided 4 regular pods per day, which is very civilized.
There was a rooftop pool where the main hotel restaurant is located for diners wanting a semi outdoor terrace experience. We didn't eat there but the menu looked tasty and reasonably priced.
There is an art gallery on the 1rst floor, which features ancient sculptures for you history buffs.
 There was a small gym up a small staircase up from the pool area.
The one complaint I did log was that the free wifi in our room was very poor quality. One could only really use it if perched on a chair sitting nearer to the door. From the bed or anywhere into the room at all it was basically unusable. I ended up either using my tablet by the door, or going down to the lobby which was a little annoying. It's an old building with thick walls so I understand but in 2016 they could figure out more powerful routers. So minus one star for bad wifi. I've had better internet connections at Motel 6. Find out what budget hotels use and get that.
In all this hotel was in a perfect location and a great starting point for sightseeing. Only a few blocks from the gothic quarter,  fairly close to the beaches and a short taxi to everything else. Very nice place to spend a few days.
",4,2016,05,18
19,Classy perfection,"My partner and myself arrived to the beautiful Hotel Claris exhausted after weeks of travel. After being greeted with smiles and complimentary champagne, we settled in to our freely upgraded suite. 
The most luxurious bed situated in a tastefully styled room. The room had all the fittings and more, with a very luxurious feel. From slippers to nail care, we were certainly feeling very relaxed and well accommodated. 
The roof top restaurant and pool is amazing and we enjoyed some incredible coctails as the sun set over the beautiful city. 
The hotel and its staff are impressive, friendly and wonderful. We were recommended to stay here by family and would highly recommend it to anyone! ",5,2016,05,16
19,Mediterranean International Cup -10 days in Spain,"Loved this Hotel. The staff was very friendly. Great location. Large rooms well equipped room with slippers, robes and a Nespresso machine. Always had welcome juice,coffee  and champagne in Lobby. A short walk to Las Ramblas but great scenery along the way",5,2016,05,13
19,Excellent location,"We stayed at the Hotel Claris the first two days of our Barcelona trip. The hotel is positioned well for exploring the Exiample and Diagonal area of Barcelona, Passage de Gracia a five minute walk. The rooms are excellent and the White Company bath products are a special treat! The roof terrace is lovely, breakfast is served with excellence and a glass of champagne to boot what more could you want to start off your day in Barcelona!! Highly recommended ... Look out for the fish in the atrium and the Egyptian artefacts on the first floor. Enjoy !!",4,2016,05,12
19,Excellent stay at Hotel Claris ,"We stayed in a duplex suite and were very impressed with the room, It was clean, spacious and well decorated. On arrival at the hotel the staff were very helpful and polite as they were throughout our weekend stay. Hotel Claris has an excellent roof terrace and bar which is reasonably priced and I highly recommend the Chinese restaurant on the ground floor, we had an excellent meal here. The hotel is in a really good location and there are lots of bars and shops close by. I have visited Barcelona on many occasions and stayed in many different hotels but Hotel Claris is by far the best and I shall be returning in the near future. 5 stars.",5,2016,05,10
19,Wonderful hotel in great location,"This is a delightful hotel in a very nice part of town near the main shopping street. Very near the mandarin oriental! The staff are excellent and very friendly bd helpful. From the pieman to the reception staff to the cleaning staff. We did not have any issues with noise as mentioned by other reviews. The complimentary cava, coffee and juice in the lobby is a bonus. The room are stylish and this a proper boutique hotel. 
The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is the meal in the rooftop restaurant was a bit of a let down. It's expensive but the quality of the food did not fit the cost. 
But overall we would definitely stay again! Thank you to all the staff!",4,2016,05,05
19,Almost faultless! ,"The Claris GL is a superb hotel and most certainly worthy of 5 stars.

The staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. The facilities were excellent!

Location is perfect, 5 minutes walk from Casa Batlo, great places to eat and transport. 

The room was one of the best I've stayed in, with a nespresso machine in the room!! 

The pool is excellent however not a lot of beds. The staff at the terrace bar were the only ones to slightly disappoint with a pretty poor customer service. 

One thing which was strange was the lack of iron. I phoned and asked for one and was told they didn't have any on site and they send your clothes off to somewhere offsite to be ironed - which is great. But I wanted to quickly iron my shirt and get out for dinner, so not exactly convenient. 

All in all, a superb place to stay and we got great value considering the quality. 

Highly recommend. ",5,2016,05,05
19,"Great Location, Professional Staff, 5 Stars All Around","Booked through Expedia after doing much research. Very reasonable rates. When we arrived we received a very warm greeting from the front desk staff. Check-in took only a few minutes. We received a glass of Cava and the from desk manager took us for a little tour of the hotel and then took us to our room and explained everything. We stayed for 9 nights. It is very centrally located, near everything. The rooms were extremely comfortable and clean. Everything was upscale. Every dealing we had with any staff was extremely professional and accommodating. I don't think you could do better.",5,2016,05,04
19,Cute Boutique Hotel; Good Service.,"After an all night flight to Barcelona from NY and landing at 7 am, all we wanted to do was shower and unpack! We arrived at the hotel, and though, despite being pretty full (it was St. Jordi Day) they managed to accommodate us and showed us to our room. The room was fine, nothing spectacular but fine for what we needed. We showered and unpacked and went downstairs for the complimentary breakfast. Again, breakfast was fine. No frills but fine for what we needed, some eggs, fruit, coffee... we were good to go. We were out all day and when we came back and got into bed I felt something sticking out of the mattress, a spring. It was late so I chose to go to sleep and deal with it in the morning. We told the staff first thing and they told us they would check on it. Later, when we returned they told us they did not find anything but would be happy to transfer us to another room they had put aside for us. We told them it wasn't a big deal but they told us the other room was an upgrade and offered to show it to us. Upon seeing the duplex we switched rooms and the staff made it very easy for us. While the rooms are definitely new and updated, the layout is a bit silly... very tight quarters. You can also hear a lot of the noise in other rooms/ the hallway. Our safe also got locked shut and it took 2 people to come get it open... The staff really felt horribly about everything and was super friendly/kind. It was fine for what we needed it for... clean, good location. Its not the Arts or the Mandarin but knowing we wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel this absolutely more than sufficed.",3,2016,05,03
19,Wonderfull Hotel & Service,"We stay only one night, the location is perfect the staff in wonderfull specially Jovanna in the reception and Pancho in the front door the room is very spacious the bed super confortable king size. The only little problem is the wifi but the rest excellent place and staff super profesional we recomended",5,2016,05,02
19,Do Not Book This Hotel,"Worst hotel experience we have ever had.  The noise in this hotel will make you want to run screaming bloody murder.  First, the dogs barking begins at 5am and is non stop, the doorbells of all the rooms are so loud you hear it all day long, housekeeping are so loud when cleaning rooms you think there is an eathquake, the echo from all the voices because of the atrium makes you think people are in your room.  You will NOT get any rest if you need or, you will not sleep all night long bc you hear everything going on everywhere.  The worst is the dogs barking.  I changed rooms twice and still unhappy.  We reserved a suite and of course was given the worse suite in the hotel. It's in the back, facing a courtyard, only one window, long and narrow, very small bedroom.  Worst suite ever at over $400+ Per night ridiculous.  At first we were given a suite on the second floor.  Who wants to be on the second floor looking at a wall for that price.  Then was put on 6th floor with terrace above, all you hear are chairs being thrown around upstairs.  Went to 5th floor where it was ridiculously loud with dogs barking, doorbells ringing, voices echoing.  I was mortified.  I had to stay in one full day and practically went crazy listening to all the noise.  The only positive I can give was room service staff, very nice! Accommodating and friendly.  Turn down service is a joke she didn't even turn down the bed or put plethora of pillows away,, what was the point.  I'm disgusted with this hotel.  At checkout they asked if everything was ok, I said no, the dogs barking all day should be addresses by management.  Front desk person asked which dog?  Which dog, you should know you checked it in.  My husband said ""we didn't recognize the bark""' stupid answer for a stupid question.  Dogs should have a muzzle as to not disturb the guest.  Since when do dogs take precedent over human guests.  This hotel is a joke.  It's not even two star.  Shame on you for pretending to be something you are not.  I will do everything possible to deter people from booking this awful hotel.  Do not book this hotel you will regret it.",1,2016,05,01
19,Highly Recommended,We visited this hotel based on the recommendation of friends and SLH highly recommended list.  It's the perfect location for those wanting to be very close to the main activity in Barcelona but one step (or two blocks) removed from the rush and noise.  We were able to walk to most locations when time permitted or take an inexpensive taxi ride (not more than 5 euro) when we were in a hurry.  Small hotel feel with personal focus on the guests. Same level of service I've experienced in hotels with twice the nightly rate. Recommend the Terace for pre/post dinner drinks.  Will definitely be back to visit. ,5,2016,05,01
19,Splendid hotel,"We have just spent one week at the Claris and could not fault it. The staff in particular were, without exception, polite, considerate and most helpful! We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2016,04,24
19,Great hotel in a great location.,"This was in fact our third stay at the Hotel Claris and I have to say each stay has been wonderful.  
The rooms are well equipped clean and smart.  Each room has it's own piece of Ancient Egyptian art  as part of the decor that adds a nice interesting touch.  We've always had rooms on the 4th floor and above so can't comment on the noise issues some guests seem to have had, from reading other reviews, on the lower floors.  We've always been lucky enough to enjoy peace and quiet and good nights sleep!
The roof top bar and restaurant are fantastic.  
Head to the bar if you're a gin lover, enjoy the sun, some tapas and some really top notch gin cocktails.  
The restaurant on the terrace serves great food and again the staff are wonderful and really make you feel at home.  
The location of this hotel couldn't be better either.  Your minutes walk form the shops of Passeig de Gràcia. Surrounded by great restaurants and a short walk to the metro and trains around the city and to the airport.
I can't recommend the Claris highly enough - we'll definitely be going back for our 4th visit soon!!",5,2016,04,22
19,Beautiful building,"I visited the Claris for a birthday weekend treat. The hotel is gorgeous and the artefacts interesting as I have an interest in ancient Egypt. From the doorman Pancho to the staff that served breakfast they were excellent. The room was large and beautiful laid out, with an artefact in each room (nice touch). On our first evening the safe got stuck with our belongings inside. The desk staff got onto very quickly, although the maintenance man they sent up was quite curmudgeonly it was quite funny. The only downside to my time there was that in the morning at 06:15am without fail a large door would start squeaking very loudly and what could only be described as the kitchen staff having a pan fight ensuing. I bought it to the attention of the concierge and they said that it would be dealt with. It never was. Who needs sleep anyway lol. That aside I had a pleasant experience & would visit again, just not in room 120 :)",3,2016,04,18

Pros:
+ Very warm hearted welcome
+ Nice local welcome drink (cava)

Cons:
- Uncomfortable Breakfast room (-1 Floor)

19,Amazing stay!,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Claris- mixing a business trip with pleasure!  This hotel is amazing!  Great location! Beautiful accommodations, friendly and helpful staff!  The restaurant up on the roof is not to be missed!  The chef made a special meal for my husband after we told the concierge we were looking specifically for sea urchin- special to the region.  It was fantastic!  The staff at The Claris couldn't be nicer!  Check out the pool and have a cocktail up on the roof!  Great stay! We will be back!",5,2016,04,15
19,An Excellent Hotel,"This is not the typical traveler's hotel. The rooms are very nice - we stayed in one with a loft, and include works of art. Then we switched to a larger room that was even more comfortable. 
It's evident that the management cares about the details of running an excellent hotel. The staff is very well trained. If there is a problem it is taken care of right away. We stayed there six nights.",5,2016,04,11
19,Mr,"This is not a 5 star hotel. It really is a plain and sparse hotel. An outdoor pool ! No evening dining room unless you go their chinese restaurant. Plastic fish in a pool? The room was disappointing.it was dark and small for a junior suite.room service did not replace a broken glass , took away 2nd key card and on occasion the water was not replaced. The car booked to collect us at the airport did not show. All told, quite a let down. ",3,2016,04,09
19,Beautiful hotel.. Great service! ,"Beautiful hotel with amazing service. The surprise bottle of cava delivered to our room was a lovely gesture, and the wine, bread and meat tapas at 6pm in reception was so nice. The little touches do make it special.

19,Perfection in Barcelona,"The Claris Hotel is a gem in a great location in Barcelona.  The staff were cheerful, warm and intelligent reflective of the leadership and example of Victoria Amoros. The fitness center on the top floor overlooking the city was fabulous. It has a contemporary vibe and it was impeccable. We can't wait to return and to be greeted by Poncho - the mainstay!",5,2016,04,08
19,Great location and Stylish Hotel,"We stayed at Hotel Claris for a few nights as the second part of our honeymoon. The location is great, very close to shopping and restaurants. Service was also great and accommodating. Daily housekeeping and turn down service was on point. Only complaint is that the walls are not very soundproof, we were woken up at 1am one night because our neighbors were talking very loudly in the hallway. Had to call twice to get them to go to their rooms. We were also woken up two mornings by housekeeping, once at 9am because they rang our doorbell and once because they were cleaning the room directly above us. 

Although the hotel is beautifully decorated and the duplexes had separate living and bedroom area. We felt the room was pretty crammed and the space was not efficiently utilized. We hardly ever went upstairs to the living space and our suitcases took up a lot of the space around the bed. 

No big complaints but also not overly impressed. Don't book this hotel purely based on its looks, I didn't feel the space was very functional and would have preferred an one level but better layout hotel room.",4,2016,04,07
19,The best service!,"By way of background, I travel regularly for work and I have stayed at 100+ 5 star hotels around the world.

With this as the background, Hotel Claris' staff is the most sincere, helpful, friendly that I have ever experienced. They made a huge difference in my travel experience and I highly recommend the hotel.  

The room was nice and comfortable; the breakfasts were good; and the neighbourhood lovely.

I also compared notes with other guests and their opinions were very positive as well.",5,2016,04,05
19,Claris hotel barcelona,"This hotel is a must visit..to begin with the location is great..easily accessible by public transportation whether bus or taxi..it is surrounded by different types of restaurants if you want or you simply can order from  their delicious room service menu

19,Trip to ancient world,Do you like ancient art? So you can sleep in a room with 300 DC artefacts. The owner is sahring his private collection of ancient artefacts with the hotel guests. Cool idea to make a mix between a modern hotel and the history of mankind. And the bes - the very nice hotel just a block away from the main shopping street in Barcelona. Definitely a recommendation if you want to stay in Barcelona.,5,2016,03,15
19,Stunning hotel in a great location,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Was brilliant to be accommodated into our room earlier then 3pm , it was a great start to our trip. the little touches like welcome drink and  little note with wine was a lovely surprise. Loved our turn down service too Rooms were very comfortable and spacious , staff were very pleasant.. Thank you",5,2016,03,15
19,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed here with our adult children in December.  Everyone loved it - the unique rooms, the art, the complimentary chocolates and wine, the location.  Big hit.  The concierge helped us find amazing restaurants every day - which is key as the touristy places get old.  We are lucky enough to have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world but this is our favorite now - and for a fraction of the price.",5,2016,03,14
19,Perfect hotel to celebrate my Birthday!,"Great hotel, wonderful staff and the perfect location. Overall our room was great - Spacious, comfy bed and powerful shower. The White Company products in the bathroom and coffee machine were a lovely touch. The rest of the hotel was very nice, what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The breakfast was another highlight which made our stay feel like a real treat.",5,2016,03,14
19,A great hotel.,"A great place to stay when visiting Barcelona. A modern & luxurious hotel befitting a city such as this. Special mention for the truly marvellous Concierge Pancho. Although all of the staff were impeccable, Pancho stood out. He was extremely helpful, considerate & genuine. Thanks for enhancing our visit.",4,2016,03,12
19,Thank you Hotel Claris,"Lovely hotel in fantastic location. Beautiful, spacious room with all amenities, roof terrace with bar and restaurant, swimming pool, gym, museum! Helpful, informative and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more. Looking forward to our next visit

Particular thank you to the two gentlemen on the door for their restaurant recommendations!",5,2016,03,10
19,Fab Hotel in the Center of Barcelona,"Beautiful friendly and clean hotel with excellent staff. We were made to feel so welcome, Would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to Barcelona . On arrival we were greeted by the staff and offered an upgrade to a beautiful suite . Then with a complimentary glass of champagne in hand we were shown to our room.  all of the staff we encountered where helpful and friendly.",5,2016,03,09
19,Hotel Claris,The hotel is in a great location close to the main shopping street and Las Ramblas. The bedrooms are very luxurious with robes and slippers provided and a nice turndown service in the evening. The staff were generally very nice.,5,2016,03,07
19,Short 4 day break,"Booked this hotel for my 30th birthday and friendly staff on arrival, with glass of champagne. Upgraded to suite and the room was very clean. The maid came in twice an day - Julia. The location of the hotel is prime location to everything. The top terrace bar is lovely . Would recommend this hotel in an flash.",5,2016,03,06
19,March 2016,"I stayed at the Claris about 15 years ago and absolutely loved the luxurious feel to the place. I thought i'd found a deal this time with a room just over £100 per night.  So disappointed.  Average room, poor bed, shocking layout - you can barely see the tv from the bed (just look at the photo). At this price and this location it's just about ok but wouldn't pay a penny more. Yet to try sleeping, but already it's very noisy. Just listening to guests above getting ready for bed. Wooden floors - not good.",3,2016,03,03
19,a very good hotel and located in a good place in the city.,a very good hotel with excellent service. I highly recommend on this hotel. the price are a bit expensive but you are getting value for money. efficient and courteous staaf and are ready to help un any subject.,5,2016,02,26
19,Unique,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend for his 21st birthday, and contacted the hotel prior to our visit and upon arrival we were told our room had been upgraded, which was fantastic! The main benefits of this were the lovely The White Company toiletries (the sleep spray was dreamy), wireless bose speakers and our very own nespresso machine! Would definitely opt for this next time! We were also provided with amazing support and recommendations in terms of transport from the airport and local restaurants, this level of customer service is something I have never experienced before and made our holiday much more relaxing. We visited a local restaurant that was recommended and it was hands down the best meal we had in Barcelona (Jaime Berestain ). 

The hotel is beautiful, there is no other way to describe it. We loved the incense burning, it smelt divine. We also loved the historical artifacts found in every room - what an interesting and nice touch. The hotel is faultless, the chocolates on our pillows were a nice thing to return to from a busy day of sight-seeing; it is all the little things that the hotel does so well, and leads to a fantastic experience. The rooftop pool was beautiful at sunset, but sadly too cool to dip in! I imagine it would be lovely in the warm summer! We also tried the rooftop restaurant, it had a fantastic ambiance and wonderful staff - I tried a delicious dessert that was simply described as  'catalan bread oil and chocolate' and recommended to me by our waiter - it was DELICIOUS and loved the story that accompanied it - very different! 

The hotel is situated in a prime location for all tourist attractions in Barcelona. We only used the metro to get to and from the airport, and I think the furthest we walked was 40 mins to Park Guell which is impressive considering how spread out everything is ! 

Definitely will be back!",5,2016,02,24
19,The Perfect Spot In Bacelona,"Perfect location, Close to Train Station , minutes from famous fission shops, Tapas & bars  , 10 min Walk to  Plaza Catalunya. 

Suite Room is spacious, beautiful & Comfortable , it's like living in Art Gallery. With a little in house Museum .

Wonderful food in Hotel , Don't miss the top level Bar  

Amazing Amazing Staff",5,2016,02,24
19,Excellent but unexpected credit card charge,"Excellent location and very friendly staff. We arrived quite early for check in and they managed to get a room for us 2 hours before the official check in time. We were offered complimentary drinks on arrival and plenty of suggestions for eating out around the area. My only issue was the additional charge on my credit card 3 days after checking out. The hotel charged me for the use of the minibar which we did not use. I am surprise that a hotel is able to charge me for something before querying with me first. After emailing the hotel and explaining the situation they were apologetic and promised to refund the money back into my account. 
",4,2016,02,24
19,The Wow factor,"Great place to stay , amazing staff from the doorman to the housekeeper, had a lovely suite with mezzanine , very comfy bed, nice mix of antics and modern for the decoration and very convenient to walk to any places in the city.",5,2016,02,22
19,Once again Tripadvisor comes up trumps.,"Stayed here for three nights Feb 2016. Great location. Easy to find just 10 mins walk from Catalunya Plaza and Ramblas.
Facilities are excellent but it is the quality of the service from every member of staff that we will really remember. They couldn’t do enough for us. Room was amazing with fantastic bath and shower. Loved our stay and will return",5,2016,02,21
19,Just perfect,"We had just a perfect stay at Claris Hotel in Barcelona - Staff was very friendly and helpful, service was phenomenal. Our room was just incredible, lots of unique art pieces - everything was just perfect. ",5,2016,02,21
19,"Amazing hotel, fantastic service, great location","From the moment we stepped in, service was immaculate.  Our suite was spacious, beautifully decorated in Asian style.  We used the terrace for drinks and although it was a bit cold (Feb!), it had great atmosphere.  The location of this hotel is exceptional as is their attention to detail.  ",5,2016,02,21
19,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","The hotel is well decorated and the room was amazing, the view of our room was not that good though, staff was very friendly and supportive, most of them speaks good English.
The Terrace restaurant was superb.",4,2016,02,20
19,"Excellent hotel, great location, friendly staff","Very welcoming and knowledgeable reception staff. Luxurious room with a large bed and lots of pillows, wonderful bathroom and amenities, Nespresso coffee machine, free WiFi and large flat screen TV. Beautiful and quite rooftop terrace.

19,Birthday & Valentines Combo,"Could not rate this hotel more highly. The room was stunning and despite a 3pm check in, on our arrival at 12 lunch we were advised our room was ready for us. After travelling from the early hours it was just what we needed. The staff could not do enough for you and were extremely helpful when trying to orient ourselves with the city. The location was fantastic, giving us easy access to the main attractions. The room was spotless and the added touches when our room had been cleaned just added to our perfect stay. We had all kinds of complementary items following days of wandering. Would stay again 10 times over! Not one to miss! Thank you to all the staff who made our stay most enjoyable 😃 Emma T",5,2016,02,17
19,Fabulous stay,"This is the 3rd time I have stayed at this lovely hotel.  This time I stayed in a Duplex suite and I would highly recommend this room category.  The hotel is located in a prime position just one block from Passeig de Gracia.  Everything is walkable from this property with Sagrada Familia and Las Ramblas approx 15 mins away. The metro and RENFE stations are less than a 2 min walk from the hotel.  I have stayed in a number of 5* properties in Barcelona but I have to say that I think this was probably my best stay in the city.  Many thanks to the helpful, friendly staff.",5,2016,02,16
19,Birthday & Valentines,"Perfect stay, just what we was hoping for! Great location for shopping and to get to other areas, really friendly and helpful staff, room was a good size with a nice views, will definitely visit here again! ",5,2016,02,15
19,Amazing hotel! Fantastic service.,"Last week we spent two amazing nights in this hotel, the staff were very welcoming and very very helpful.

I lost my phone in the taxi and they did their best efforts to try and help me get it back. The doorman especially was very helpful.

The room was clean, beds were comfy, really loved the black out blinds! I would highly recommend to anyone to stay here it is worth every bit of money.

Only thing I can say is I wish there was more choice if food in the restaurant in the hotel. Other than that 10/10!!!!",5,2016,02,14
19,Modern and beautiful,"We were in a junior suite. The furniture is really beautiful. The bed is big and really comfortable. 
You are welcomed with a glass of cava or juice. The bill is not that high for such a hotel. 
Only one negative point : there is no bath.
I highly recommand this hotel.",5,2016,02,14
19,Stylish top hotel in quiet but convenient location - near fantastic restaurants,"I booked an executive room which was perfectly appointed. The hotel is filled with art - even in the rooms. The rooms and bathrooms have everything you need - slippers, robes, hair dryer, magnifying mirror, safe, The White Company toiletries, a selection of six to eight different pillows on the bed, a sofa seating area, mini-bar, Nespresso machine. Really nice. Incense burns non-stop in all corridors and is perfectly intoxicating. The rooftop bar, pool and lounge area is a bit of heaven. We didn't try the restaurants or have breakfast as they were both expensive and there were so many other wonderful restaurants nearby.",5,2016,02,10
19,Can't remember getting better service !,"The hotel itself is nice, the rooftop bar / terrace / pool is cool - but what really makes this hotel a must is the people that work there. 

From the moment of check in you are really made to feel welcome. Was presented almost with a pack of information on local things to do by the ladies on reception. I was only in my room for a couple of mins before the maid was knocking on the door with some free bottles of water and some choccies, 10 mins later the turn down service arrived - more choccies !

Went for dinner at the roof terrace, again the service is amazing. Nice little free appetisers to start and then free little cakes to finish. Super-attentive staff - you're glass will never be empty. Try the secreto iberico for dinner - you won't be disappointed. 

I travel a lot for work, and often on my own, so being made to feel at home is kinda important to me - and this place does it in right. I'll definitely be back !",5,2016,02,10
19,"Great hotel, location and staff","We stayed 6 nights at Hotel Claris in Feb 2016.  Terrific location.  Easy drive up and drop off of bags.  Early check in was no problem.  Lunch on the top floor at the Terrace was exceptional.  Anna was a delight.  Tuna tartar best we have had during 45 days in Spain.  Great wines by the glass.  Hotel is boutique sized in the middle of everything.  Easy to walk to lots of major attractions.  We had a junior suite.  Room 617.  Room was really nice--two sinks in the bath with separate jacuzzi tub and shower.  Lots of huge towels.  Plenty of space for unpacking and living.  BUT--our room was directly beneath a banquet room off the restaurant on the 7th (top) floor.  Every night around 1 pm-2 am staff did a re-set on the room.  Lots of noise on the wooden floor which was our ceiling.  I asked about his after a few nights and was too,d it was an exception and I should have no more late night noise.  Alas, not true.  Staff worked those hours every night.  I was told there would be an adjustment on my bill for the noise.  Didn't happen.

All things considered--great hotel, location and staff.  Value on par with price.  Just don't stay in 617!  ",4,2016,02,09
19,Lovely central hotel in Barcelona - particulary love the rooftop bar/pool,"I stayed with my family at the Hotel Claris, Barcelona in 2015 for 3 nights. We arrived hours earlier than the check-in time, and had to leave our cases with reception whilst we were out to explore. Upon we return, we planned to relax on the rooftop bar until our room was ready, but we were told that they had prepared the room early for us. We unpacked and went to the rooftop, but sadly there are not many sunbeds, so we could not swim or sunbathe. We decided to sit on one of the tables (whilst we waited for sunbeds to become available - which sadly they did not) and order cocktails and a bottle of wine - all very reasonably priced and conveniently we were able to charge them to our room. 

When we arrived we were told both of our rooms had been upgraded to suites for no extra cost! The rooms were lovely, two GIANT single beds, and a pull out sofa bed which were all extremely comfy. Bathroom with bath, shower, toilet and two sinks were also a huge help as smaller bathroom could have been a bit cramped with three of us in the room. On our second day we did opt to use the dry cleaning service to iron a few of our clothes which had gotten creased during travel, which in hindsight I wish we hadn't have done as they were ironed that well and it was a VERY expensive service! I did find the price of the room very expensive at first, but the free upgrade to the suites made it worth the money definitely.

Location wise we could not have picked anywhere better, within walking distance to EVERYTHING. Las ramblas is within a five minute walk, as were a number of supermarkets and little cafe's. Barcelona beach and Camp Nou were also within walking distance, but for those who don't want to walk, the VERY helpful doorman would call taxi's for us. It is also within walking distance to the train station where short journeys would take you to places such as Barcelona Cathedral, Park Guell and La Sagrada Famillia.

",4,2016,02,09
19,A great stay at the Claris,"From when I first arrived at this hotel to the very end the staff were always so obliging and friendly. Was only here for two nights but in that time I was given a free upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine. The location was so central with the main thoroughfare only minutes away. The room and bathroom were huge and spotless and the bed really comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location, staff, customer service and value for money, not to mention the great quality of food in the restaurant and lovely views from the rooftop bar/restaurant.  ",5,2016,02,08
19,First trip to barcelona,Everything was excellent from check in to check out not a bad word to say.on arrival they made you feel special with a glass of champagne also great facilities within the hotel roof top bar just a nice touch to hideaway.,5,2016,02,07
19,Very nice boutique hotel,"Near the city of Barcelona, this hotel is very nice and fashion.
The hotel is part of SLH and it's very modern, fashion & design hotel.The room are very spacious and comfortable.
We had a room on the 1st floor looking the backside and there was not way to open any window.
The terrace with the bat (rooftop) is so nice for a good cocktail or coffee during the day. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful",4,2016,02,07
19,Luxury weekend,Central location within walking distance of major sights. Attentiveness of staff was particularly welcoming. The room was both stylish and comfortable.Highly recommended as a great place to stay in a beautiful city.,5,2016,02,02
19,SUPER HOTEL IN GREAT LOCATION FOR ALL ATTRACTIONS OF BARCELONA,"The hotel is one of the SLH range, and deservedly so. It is well located for the old town centre and also for the major external attractions such as Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, Camp Nou, etc. The staff are both friendly and efficient, from the warm welcome upon arrival to the helpful departure. Our stay was too short to try the restaurant, however the breakfast was excellent, and the room itself was very nice. We'll be back!",5,2016,02,01
19,Great hotel,"Perfect location. Perfect rooms. Perfect service. The hotel is in the heart of the city. You can reach sagrada familia, gotic quarter, casa battlo, casa mila bu walking. Staffs are very helpful. Rooms are very very good. İnternet is Fast. Breakfast is extra. We have paid 45 Euro per a day for three person.
",5,2016,02,01
19,5 star service,"The Claris hotel is definitely value for money.  Fabulous location, outstanding hotel staff and beautiful room.  We highly recommend this hotel.  Great value for money. The breakfast offered was excellent.  Lots of fruit, meats, salads, etc offered.  Coffee is the best",5,2016,01,28
19,Fantastic hotel,"My boyfriend and I are both in our 20s and stayed here for 2 nights in January. The staff gave us a free upgrade and we received a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in the room. Staff were very friendly and helpful and speak good English which helped us as our Spanish is not the best! Facilities are fantastic , roof top bar and pool. 

Location is perfect for exploring the whole of Barcelona as about 5 minute walk to la rambla, 15 to the beach and bars along the sea front and 15 minutes to Sagrada. 

Highly recommend and will be returning ! ",5,2016,01,28
19,Claris is my favorite for over 10 years,"Everything perfect for me, staff, rooms, location, size, friendliness , service food.....
I stay at the hotel now for 10 years, whenever I am in Barcelona on a business trip. I have tried other 5 star hotels before, but I enjoyed the Claris the best. I love to get into and meet the same staff for a very long period of time now. This fact is standing for itself. The size of the hotel makes it very personal and it is far away from these unique monochromatic, stereotype, 5 star bunkers you will find everywhere on earth. Thank you Claris with its wonderful staff.",5,2016,01,25
19,a great weekend,we had two nights at the Claris and it was very comfortable and we had a great time.  Our greeting on arrival was wonderful and room service came promptly. Our room was perfect and just what we needed - clean comfortable with a great view.,5,2016,01,25
19,Wonderful stay,Staying at Hotel Claris was a wonderful experience! Everyone was nice and helpful. The rooms were great and very clean as well. It is also in a great location and I always felt safe in the area. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona!,5,2016,01,21
19,A Wonderful Hotel,"We had such a lovely stay in this hotel in December that we decided to return for a second trip this month.

The staff in the hotel are excellent and it was a wonderful surprise to have been upgraded to a suite . The room was beautiful and it is a real pleasure to be in rooms containing some rather impressive art too. Everything about the hotel is luxurious and the staff cannot do enough to help you. Little touches such as the cava upon arrival, a rose being left for the turn down service and the attentive staff all make for a fantastic hotel experience.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to travel to Barcelona. We are already looking at booking our third trip here. 

Thank you to the staff at Hotel Claris.",5,2016,01,18
19,Best on the top,"Claris GL is ideally located in the center of Barcelona, just a few blocks from Plaza Catalunia. Still, in the pool area and in the roof top bar close to it, you find yourself at rest. The restaurant on top of the hotel is a little bit pricy, but the food is excellent and the service very good.
We we´re welcomed in the hotel with a glass of Cava and felt as if we were really prominent people. After that, escorted to our room, we got a little bit disappointed. The room was supposed to be a Junior Suite, but it did not really feel like it. There was hardly no light in the room - outside of the windows there was only a small backyard - or rather a shaft - never lit up during the day.
My advice to anyone booking on this hotel is to make sure you get a room aiming at the outside of the building. Then you would probably feel you get your money´s worth.",4,2016,01,17
19,5 star in every way,"Room amazing,  lots of really nice little touches,  overall couldn't be happier with this place.  Nice touch of cava on arrival while we waited for them to check us in (took 2 minutes). Rooftop bar has great views and amazing drinks.  Bit pricey but worth it.  Room has bits of art in each.  Breakfast plentiful.  Staff wonderful.  Location second to none. ",5,2016,01,17
19,Central hotel in Barcelona,Claris hotel is in the centre of Barcelona and close to the tourist attractions. Our room was spacious and clean but it hadn't had a dustbin except the bathroom so we asked for another one and they kindly gave us one. The hotel had a mysterious smell on the corridors like something was burning but they told us that it is the air freshener. The breakfast was poor for 5* hotel but the stuff was kind.,4,2016,01,16
19,Fantastic Hotel !,"Brilliant hotel, excellent service, fantastic location, great roof top bar, cant recommend this hotel highly enough !! Swimming pool a little small but more than big enough to be able to cool off. Will definitely return.",5,2016,01,14
19,Modern artsy rooms,"Conveniently located in the Upscale section of the City.  15 minutes walking to Las Ramblas.  Basically dead center of all the Tourist spots in the city.  The staff was extremely eager to make me happy and concerned that they were doing a good job.  English no problem. Special thanx to Carolina, the door men, and the night crew.  The rooms are decorated both modern with taste and art throughout the room.  One thing that I did not like was the incense burning on each floor but they put it out during my stay.",4,2016,01,12
19,Big thank you!!!,First time at the Claris and we had an amazing experience. We got the room at 12:30 with a glass of champagne as a welcome drink. Was a perfect start. We had dinner at the terrace and the staff were superb. Thank you for taking care of us and thank you for this unforgettable trip!,5,2016,01,11
19,"Top hotel, even smells great","Good location, welcome drink FOC, lavender sent in corridor, lovely reception area, breakfast a bit pricey but there are so many places to eat really well and cheap nearby it's not an issue. Rooftop terrace/bar/swimming pool would be great in the summer. Only issue is that the gym is tiny but take your shoes and run to Barcolanetta and through the parks!",5,2016,01,09
19,Did not meet expectations,"We wanted to like Hotel Claris, especially after reading other reviews, but our experience wasn't great.  The hotel and our upgraded room were nice enough, but the service was very average. The reception staff were not particularly interested in assisting us at check in or with our two requests (wifi access issues and an iron).  It seemed that the hotel image was more important that the guests.

On the plus side the breakfast staff were very pleasant and attentive and the hotel is in a good location.  And the hotel did contact us in response to our concerns with the stay.",3,2016,01,09
19,Central and modern,"This is conveniently placed for central Barcelona and all the designer shops, the roof top restaurant is good and reasonably priced.  The rooms are small but adequate and the staff are great especially the breakfast staff, ask for cooked bacon, scrambled eggs as it isn't displayed.",5,2016,01,07
19,Lovely Place,"Well located, the hotel is beautifully decorated and quirky. My duplex room was spacious, comfortable and clean with great facilities. The staff were friendly and helpful - couldn't fault them. A fabulous stay!!",5,2016,01,06
19,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with contemporary elegant decor. Rooms are on the small side as is typical of many European hotels. Our room had a sitting area in a loft which was a nice bonus. Bathroom had only a single sink. The staff was extremely helpful. We did not visit the roof bar or pool but plan to when we return on our next visit. The location, steps to shopping, restaurants and museums is terrific.",4,2016,01,06
19,WE WILL BE BACK!,"The Claris is a very comfortable and stylishly decorated hotel. It is beautiful without being intimidating or over the top.

The location is perfect if you want to be within walking distance of the shops and fine restaurants without being in the middle of all the noise. It is just two streets away from the main shopping area.

We were staying with our 14 year old son and were given a stunning duplex room which was very comfortable for three persons. 

My wife and I had the lower section and our son had the upper section complete with his own separate TV and Sony Bluetooth sound system...ideal for a young teenager. The room was soundproof so we found it really peaceful.

The room contained many fine antiques and ancient archaeological artifacts, something we had never seen in a hotel room before!

This hotel is kept in immaculate condition and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job keeping the room clean and tidy.

We found all the staff to be very friendly, efficient and helpful. The manager at breakfast was particularly charming and cheerful!

We highly recommend the Claris to anyone visiting beautiful Barcelona as it made our 4 day stay just a touch more special.

We will be back and we will definitely stay here again next time.",5,2016,01,05
19,New Year Break,"Stayed at the Claris over the New Year. The hotel staff were very attentive, the rooms were clean and the hotel was in a great location. Would highly recommend to anyone wishing to stay in Barcelona. The roof top bar was pleasant and weather was perfect.",4,2016,01,03
19,Very happy with our stay,Lovely hotel with very pleasing service! Very good rooftop terrace next to bar.... My only criticism would be that our room was located on the ground floor and was rather noisy at times but lovely complimentary chocolates and red wine left for us to enjoy! :) i would definitely recommend staying here,4,2016,01,02
19,Double bed ,"We are asking too change our rooms since yestrday to changed to two separate beds,they wouldnot,rooms are so small,bath are terrible ,elevators are old,borring reception,some staffs are good the rest are not honestly i can tell thier names,hope to go back to prague soon ...",1,2015,12,30
19,Combined birthday & anniversary,"The staff was very helpful and kind during the whole stay. Relaxed atmosphere, but still very courteous. Our special occasion was taken into consideration, which we highly appreciated. The location was excellent, even better than we expected. We also received excellent wine suggestions whilst dining in the restaurant on the upper floor. It is not the cheapest one, but if you're planning to spend some extra for example for the special occasion - it is most certainly worth the price.",5,2015,12,29
19,Thumbs Up!,"Very comfortable  bed and pillows, excellent staff they even offer a free late check out. Great location,very clean room and bathrooms. Just one dissapoiment at the bar on the last floor, it was very expensive and they don't carry premium drinks.",4,2015,12,15
19,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff!","This hotel is just something out of the ordinary. My wife and i stayed here for a extended weekend on my birthday and i can truly say that it was one the nicest hotels i have stayed at. My wife had made all of the arrangements in secrecy to surprise me, and the staff really did a great job to make the stay a wonderful experience. The interior of the hotel is very chic and has a amazing ambiance with a mix of modern decorations and ancient artifacts. The room we had was designed in the same fashion and had a very high standard. Everything was very clean and the room was cleaned twice a day. Every night when we came back to the room, the staff hade made different small arrangements like putting out slippers, putting chocolate on the bed and even served us with a complimentary bottle of Cava since the knew it was my birthday. The hotel is situated in a nice part of the city, with lots of restaurants, cafe's and shops outside. Many of the citys main attractions like the shopping areas and the La Sagrada Familia is within a short walking distance. The staff was really very friendly, helpful and really took care of us, we couldn't had a better time in Barcelona!",5,2015,12,15
19,WONDERFUL STAY,"Stayed two nights with 10 in our party for Melon Bomb christmas party, on arrival we where given a glass of cava which was a good start , staff very friendly and room was up to five star expectation ,  the whole of the hotel was spotlessly clean, and will recommend this hotel to stay in.  Lovely roof terrace to have a drink on .",5,2015,12,08
19,"Beautiful Hotel , excellent staff!","I recently stayed here for my girlfriends birthday and what a great choice. We stayed in a duplex which was amazing. The room was very clean with plenty of towels/ toiletries/ and also dressing gowns and slippers. The bed was the comfiest I have ever known with an abundance of pillows which made it extremely hard to get up and check out at 8am, there is also a turn down service with chocolate on our pillows. 

I had recently broke my leg and therefore was on crutches during my visit and the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating by getting us checked in earlier than 3pm and asking whether we needed a taxi or help with our bags whenever we left to go anywhere. We were even given a complimentary bottle of Cava by the manager which was a lovely gesture. I have never written a review on TripAdvisor but I have signed up just to review this hotel because it was the least I could do after such a wonderful trip. We will hopefully heading back to Barcelona for a night or two in late January and will definitely be booking here again. 

Thank you for making our trip that extra special.

19,Luxury hotel with a genuine friendly feel and unstinting service,"The Hotel Claris deserves a good review. It is a luxury hotel and the service, unlike many ""luxury"" hotels is exemplary. Unlike many hotel chains it has a genuinely welcoming approach.The management clearly looks after its staff who were always happy to go the extra mile. Breakfasts very good and served with a smile. This is a trendy hotel so you would expect boutique aspects. What this hotel does however is look after its guests. Really appreciated The White Company toiletries which are a cut above the dreary stuff other chains provide and provided in abundance right down to the sleep spray. We had the pleasure of a split level room with a very comfortable bed, good bedding and sumptuous pillows. So, high comfort apart what else could you ask for ?  What you get is a very central location and easy access to the airport if you don't use taxis in plentiful supply. Well placed for the best shopping and great restaurants at hand. Barcelona is a wonderful city. This hotel gives you a feel for the city which after all is cool and trendy but retains its elegance and culture and traditions. It took me a long time to choose a hotel and The Claris was a real delight and I am a fussy but discerning  customer.",5,2015,12,08
19,"Super cool, very friendly, but not always practical","As I stood in the beautiful foyer looking at the pools, mosaics, marble and antique statues and being checked in by cool black-dressed urban hipsters I realised that as a dishevelled middle aged Brit I was the least fashionable object in sight. 

The room was fascinating, it was split onto two levels and like the foyer it had been subject to the attentions of a serious interior designer, but sadly one who prioritised style well above practicality. The decorations included a giant bird cage, an Indian mask, an anatomical model which looked as if it was used for training doctors, and a particularly evil looking flying fish (I was grateful he was behind glass).

But whoever designed this room hadn't always stopped to think what a hotel guest might actually need. There was no wardrobe, and the rail to hang clothes on was 7 feet (2.1M) in the air; as a tall guy I could just reach it, but a shorter person would have struggled without a ladder. And I couldn't find any way to stop the water flowing out of the basin in the bathroom, so no way to get a basin full of water to shave in. Maybe these urban hipster designers are all bearded? And while we're on the topic of water the glass shower screen wasn't large enough to stop the bathroom floor getting very wet. There was no waste bin in the main room, only in the bathroom - and as I generate most waste paper when working at the desk that was a bit annoying. The desk was a bit small and covered in black glass, very elegant but totally impractical if you use a laptop with a mouse; probably interior designers only use iDevices and don't think of those of us with old tech. 

But there were lots of good points as well; the staff were friendly and there was a Nespresso machine for my morning caffeine fix - always something that makes a hotel room a little special. The bed was very comfortable and the pillow spray to aid sleep was a nice touch. The internet was also reasonably fast and there were plenty of power sockets to feed my gadget population.

Bottom line: enjoyable if not always practical, especially for a business traveller or anyone who's under 6 ft (1.8M) tall. But it looks beautiful.",4,2015,12,05
19,The Best !!," 
Many thanks to Victoria, the manager of Guest relations,  for her warm welcome at the Claris Hotel. Delicious food and outstanding service combine with perfection in a green oasis above the city. Smile is everywhere present around the Claris. ",5,2015,12,02
19,Great experience ,I started badly p room. But once I emailed the manager he was apologetic and transferred me to the Grand suite. He sent exquisite wine bottles every day m the place is clean well looked after and th staff is helpful and knows English.one of the best I have stayed in. I have stayed in quite a few in Europe ,5,2015,12,01
19,Amazing Stay!!,"First time in Barcelona and what an amazing stay! I loved the city, loved the people, and we were lucky to have such a wonderful hotel -- location, service, décor and people. Cannot say enough about this beautiful hotel. It is like being part of an elegant painting when you stay. Gorgeous art -- throughout the hotel, including our Suite. Concierge Service (Carolina) was outstanding, Front Desk -- outstanding including Manager Sven, and perfect housekeeping. Thank you General Manager Fernandez for your staff, your hotel and the gracious hospitality we encountered. I will recommend many to your city and to the Hotel Claris. Plus, we dined at the rooftop restaurant and wonderful food, beautiful room and even better service. Again, a Five Star Experience from top to bottom. Loved it all!",5,2015,11,30
19,Excellent hotel,"Great service, superb location, great staff, lovely rooms. The food was excellent as was the attention to detail. When we return to Barcelona we will definitely return to this hotel as it ticked all the boxes.",5,2015,11,30
19,Great hotel! Totally recommend!,"I was in Barcelona and decided to stay at the Claris hotel because of the decent price and nearby attractions (walking distance)! 
Great service! They have good meeting rooms with a great coffee break!
The rooms are nice, there are different types so make sure which one you're choosing before you book!

19,beautifull barcelona,"Just back from a weekend in Barcelona , stayed at the Claris, and all i can say is wow !
Hotel is beautiful, the decor, the rooms, and the rooftop bar /pool area is amazing .........staff were very friendly and helpfull.  Loved every minute of my stay in Barcelona , and would definately return to the Claris.",5,2015,11,29
19,Great service!,"I normally stay at this hotel on my business trips to Barcelona and I can't compare the attention of the staff at all times, welcome drink at Reception, welcome gift in the room. Great place to have an evening drink on the roof terrace!",5,2015,11,27
19,great hotel,"It was our first time in Barcelona. And this hotel really made it an amazing experience. 
It´s a great location to explore the city from. Everybody was so friendly and welcoming. Specially Victoria from guest relation. She helped us to find our way around and to the best spots in town. We will be back to this hotel and to Barcelona",5,2015,11,24
19,Lovely hotel but has some 'design' issues!,"Great hotel, perfect location for exploring Barcelona.  Roof top area wonderful for relaxing and drinks.  A few areas let this hotel down - in the room the wardrobe did not have anywhere to hang a full length coat or dress; no bin in the bedroom; every floor had incense burning (too overpowering!).  Originally we were on a higher floor but had to be moved due to the noise of the cleaners arriving in their room at 7.00am We were then moved to the 1st floor but there is a conference facility and they were doing audio visual presentations before 8.00am!",4,2015,11,24
19,Honeymoon Stay,"My Husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon for a few days.  The hotel was amazing from the moment we walked in.  The staff was very helpful in answering all of our questions.  The room we stayed is was your normal size European room and very clean.  It was a nice touch of the chocolate on your pillow at night.  The location of the hotel is also very good.  You are in walking distances to the metro, a lot of shopping, and a few landmarks.",5,2015,11,23
19,Clean and Elegant hotel,"Me and my wife we very satisfied with our stay here in Claris. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Facility very clean. Rooms are small but clean and modern. Breakfast was very good and the service staff and mangers showed there professionalism. The roof top restaurant was the same. great view with nice cocktails, food and awesome service.
The hotel is in the down town and walkable distance to good restaurants and high end shopping, The beach is a 15 min taxi ride from the hotel. I Would recommend claris with no hesitation.",4,2015,11,19
19,one of the best Hotels,"i get to travel a lot because of my work and i can honestly say that this was one of the best hotels i stayed in, the room was amazing, clean, special design, the bath everything about the room was amazing.
the staff of the hotel was very helpful, always with a smile. there were 2 girls working as concierge which helped us with any question we had about anything we needed.
we will sure visit the hotel next time we will be in Barcelona
",5,2015,11,17
19,Amazing,My partner and me had an amazing time at the Claris! Located in the city center and close to the famous Gaudi buildings this hotel offers the best service one can imagine! A very warm welcome was given to us by the guest relations Victoria. She showed us the facilities of the hotel and we had our welcome drink at the fabulous roof terrace. Our room was very clean and we enjoyed our stay and the modern style of the hotel very much! We will definitely come back! Thanks to all!,5,2015,11,16
19,Runaway for the weekend,"Brilliant experience in the heart of the city. Friendly staff, excellent rooms and good breakfast and a fascinating view from the terace over the beautiful city of Barcelona.  Easy choice to return to Claris next time I visit Barcelona.                                      
      
      ",5,2015,11,16
19,Smelly three star at best,"We stayed in Barcelona for 4 nights - 2 nights at a different hotel (Hotel The Serras - which btw was amazing and I strongly recommend!) and 2 nights here. 

Claris was disappointing to say the least. 

The hotel decor is dated and the hotel is long overdue a refurbishment. 

The hotel smells due to constant incense burning in the corridors. 

The decor in the rooms was dated and far from pleasant creating a dark dull room. The bathroom was one I would expect to see in the 80's like pretty much everything in the hotel.

The ""art"" in the hotel was ugly and fat from anything I would want to look at anywhere especially in my hotel room!

The hotel do NOT have irons available to use - they only have a laundry service so after travelling you can't quickly press the creases out of your clothes without paying for full laundry service!

The staff on reception were unwelcoming. No information regards location for breakfast, bar etc.

The bar shut half an hour before the advertised time. 

The staff by the pool were extremely slow to serve despite the pool area not being busy.
 
This hotel should not be rated a 5 star - maybe it was in the 80's and possibly early 90's - for me it is not boutique but more tired.

I would not stay here again. I would not recommend it. In fact I would warn people not to waste there money - there are better 3 star hotels in Barcelona than this one! Don't go here!!!  ",1,2015,11,14
19,The perfect boutique hotel,"In a city that does equally well business and leisure travel, the Hotel Claris is the almost perfect boutique hotel. It is small and caring so that one is recognised by all the staff after less than 24 hours,  but it is also big enough to offer all the facilities that a business or leisure travel may require. The location could not be bettered, the staff are genuinely caring, and the antiques in the common areas and in the rooms are beautifully arranged. I spent there three days during a massive convention, and going back to the oasis of the Claris, being greeted by a smile, and retiring to my lovely split level room made all the difference.",5,2015,11,13
19,Barcelona,"Great stay; Central location afforded easy access to bus tours of city (ideal for a short stay) and easy walking distance to most all attractions.  I would definitely return to the Claris for all it has to offer.
      
      ",5,2015,11,11
19,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here 2 nights. We travelled with a family member who does not walk that well any longer, and asked for rooms next to each other. This was arranged without problems, and from start to end the service and stay was excellent. Rooms are nice and well equipped. The location of the hotel is perfect - close to everything and yet quiet. Breakfast is very good, and we also used room service, which was efficient and fine. I can highly recommend this hotel - and we will come back.",5,2015,11,09
19,Great Location,Location is fabulous.  Very Convenient to commute anywhere with Barca.  Rooms were comfortable and well furnished though a little small. Staff were very helpful!  Breakfast feels like a make shift in a room in the basement.,4,2015,11,05
19,A real gem,What could be better than a beautiful hotel with an attentive staff?  Hotel Claris fills the bill.  We were offered glasses of Spanish champagne while we waited to check in and it only got better from there.  The room was modern and well appointed.  We had a wonderful lunch on the Terrace and the breakfast buffet was bountiful and satisfying.  We will definitely stay at Hotel Claris again when visiting Barcelona.,5,2015,10,31
19,Loved it!,"Value for money, beautiful rooms and exquisite decor! Very helpful staff, easy to communicate with, most staff spoke some English. Well situated, close to everything. Our stay was not long enough!! Don't have a negative word to say.
      
      ",5,2015,10,30
19,Still charming second time around...,"Beautiful staff, accommodations, decor and location. Rooms are very comfortable and well decorated. Wifi connection works well and is fast. The only annoyance was that the water in bathroom sink and tub drains very slowly. Highly recommended and would definetely stay again.",5,2015,10,29
19,work summit,"This hotel is top class! We hosted a summit and pretty much took over the hotel for the whole week. The service was amazing as well as the meals that we has ordered for 80+ people. All the staff we top notch, especially Roberto who helped with making the experience for the team more personalized. The rooms as well are incredible. Truly there is art work in each of the rooms, making them unique and I fun talking point among the guests. I hope to come back to Hotel Claris and enjoy the location and service as a tourist. Highly recommend!",5,2015,10,26
19,"Terrace: great atmosphere, good drinks, best staff","It was a pleasure spending some hours in the terrace of this hotel a couple of weeks ago. I really enjoyed the mix of good music and the views of Tibidabo mountain. All drinks were marvellous, difficult to decide what to order next. Staff was very kind and helpful, especially a blonde young woman called Maria, who was very attentive and let us feel as a VIP. Do not doubt to choose this place, a great and amazing experience.",5,2015,10,26
19,"Great location, helpful staff, room good but a few minor issues.....","Looking for an hotel for four nights in the Eixample area, between T/A and the British Airways websites, I settled on Hotel Claris as we wanted firstly, good quality; secondly, within walking distance of the main sights we wanted to visit in Barcelona; thirdly, it was not on a main thoroughfare - we were pleased in all three respects.
Unusual blend of clean marbled lines inside a more classic stone exterior; and some unusual artwork throughout the hotel.  Free access to the Egyptian museum along the road.
Arriving early, we were able to drop our bags and head out for some light lunch.  Our room still wasn't available on return but the reception staff brought us coffee until ready We were adjacent to the room-maids' cupboard and the back stair which was occasionally noisy.
The room was nice, although a few quirks - working out the lighting took a few attempts; the controllable external shade was useful and essential. 
The shallow, mid-room half-step may cause the occasional trip in the dark.  The twin beds abutting ( rather than a double bed ) were comfortable with loads of pillows. The sofa also had plenty of cushions and bolsters.
The small but neat bathroom had a few issues - 
getting into and out of the marble bath/shower certainly required care - quite a high side and the mixer controls took a bit of fiddling to work out (turn it the wrong way and a very hot or very cold dowsing from above could be a surprise). 
There was no air extract so the mirrors steamed up completely - shame to use the beautiful towels to wipe. The grout/sealant on the marble tiling needed re-doing.
The aforementioned towels and dressing gowns were excellent and the soaps and extras were plentiful. 
Sounds a bit negative but actually they are small matters.
The inclusive breakfast was good on a nice damask cloth table setting - plentiful buffet range of cold meats, cheese, fruits, cereals - a bit limited on the range of juices and hot service.  However, I am sure they would provide if asked.
The wi-fi is free throughout the hotel but a fiddle because one has to keep resetting it.  Which leads me to add that Carolina on the concierge desk was a star in helping with  the numerous queries and matters with which we needed assistance - including online flight check-in - and always with a smile. I must say that all the reception and concierge staff were very helpful and very pleasant to deal with - and indeed the staff in general. A big plus.
We would certainly visit here again - I think it is slightly shy of being 5 star but we were generally pleased with Hotel Claris.  I will cover the Teraza Restaurant separately.",4,2015,10,25
19,Great location,"Two objections for the high rating: the beds are hard as rocks but a beautiful assortment of bed pillows described in a brochure. 
Lights are fun and delightful to use plus darkening automatic shade.
Internet is the worst cuz only works intermittently.
Breakfast was modified to an uncomfortable space because they had a inhouse conference. 
Spacious rooms and pleasant young staff. 
Beautiful decor.",3,2015,10,24
19,Great location and staff but quirky water and light systems,"This hotel occupies the Palacio Vadruna, a 19th century palace that was remodeled in 1992 to become a luxury hotel in time for the Barcelona Olympics.  It’s an ideal location, an easy walk to La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia and upscale restaurants along streets that boast several other palaces and the most fashionable shopping in the city.  The hotel’s sandstone façade still displays the historic coat of arms of the Vadruna family. Inside is a fascinating blend of avant-garde and antique -- art deco-inspired swirling stairways with glass and chrome banisters, ancient mosaics hanging on the wall, Roman statues in the lobby, and water cascading down glass walls into a pebbled pond.
 
A trained archeologist, the hotel owner displays many of his Egyptian antiquities in a museum on the first floor  and 900 more at his nearby private museum (guests are given free passes to get in).  Even the guestrooms showcase original artwork from his impressive personal collection. It makes you wonder if you are living in a contemporary hotel, an antiques museum, a modern art gallery – or a brilliant combination of all three.

Most of the staff are excellent, especially Ricardo Vargas, front desk manager; Antonio Nayac at the rooftop bar; and Marta Lopez, who welcomed us with a glass of cava when our room was not ready on arrival.  The lady working the breakfast buffet could do with a more pleasant attitude, and sometimes the made-to-order eggs took a long while.
 
Much as we enjoyed our stay of four days, we must mention that all is not easy for the guests in their rooms.  This hotel's systems are quirky!  It took us a while to learn to use the shower water and lighting systems – and a few of our group of 10 never got it right!  If the systems cannot be changed, we recommend at minimum a sign explaining how the shower taps work because several of us were hit with very hot water as we tried to figure them out!",4,2015,10,16
19,Great location ,"This hotel is in a perfect location for shops and touring the beautiful city.

The room is absolutely beautiful although they do need a waste bin in bedroom or lounge area. 

Stepping in and out of the high rounded bath is very dangerous to take a shower.

Albeit food and bar lovely, not opening till 8pm will and did put customers off.

Majority of reception staff extremely helpful albeit older female rude, abrupt and gave us the opposite information to younger girls.

How disappointing is it to read others got flowers and chocolates. .... they should treat all customers the same then they'd come back!!!!",3,2015,10,14
19,"Good location, very helpful staff","I was a bit nervous about booking this hotel after reading some of the reviews.  It seems that people either hated it or loved it.  As I was going to my room after the first night some people were going down to check out complaining greatly about the noise the night before.  On the same floor we did not experience any issues.  We were on the 6th floor.  Above us was the restaurant, pool and bar.  Location seems to make a big difference so try to specify the room location, especially if you are on the 6th floor.  They do mention the weekend entertainment but not until you are in the hotel so you should book a room on a lower level or away from the restaurant and bar.

The room was very comfortable and the servicing of the room was great.  Everything was replenished as needed without any follow up required.  I really appreciated the front desk staff and concierge.  Both were very helpful with booking excursions and restaurant recommendations.  The restaurant recommendations were just what we were looking for and excellent.

The only negative we experienced was the free Wi-Fi.  It was almost impossible to connect and stay connected in the early evening hours.  About the only time it worked reasonably well was first thing in the morning.  It also required a full reconnect each time which was very annoying.  I am not sure if the problem was lack of access points at the hotel or the service that was providing the Wi-Fi but this should really be fixed. I expect a better experience especially in a 5 star hotel.",4,2015,10,14
19,Great Hotel - do yourself a favour!,"We booked a suite in this fabulous hotel and enjoyed every minute of our stay. It is in a fantastic location. About 15 mins walk to Sagrada Familia and EUR35 taxi to/from airport. Close to a great selection of restaurants and shopping. The room was huge. Some good and not so good points about the room - we had a nice view out of the front of the hotel, the blackout blinds are the best thing ever. It was pitch black. However, there is no decent bin and nowhere to hang anything in the bathroom and the bedside tables are somewhat impractical. The rain shower was awesome and the bed was super comfy. Early check in doesn't seem to be a possibility at this hotel so be wary if you are coming in early. Service is friendly and décor is interesting and modern. I would thoroughly recommend and would suggest a suite for maximum comfort.",5,2015,10,12
19,"Great Location, Great Service","My wife and I recently stayed here for 3 days on our first trip to Barcelona.We found the people at the front desk were very helpful with directions and recommendations. There was  nightly turn-down service complete with chocolate on your pillow and a bottle of wine on your first night.
The hotel had a great patio on the roof with a small pool and a restaurant (that we did not try). I enjoyed sitting up there reading my book and watching the sun set after a long day of walking.
While it was not my original plan we found ourselves walking to most of the major attractions such as Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo and the Ramblas. We actually walked all the way down to the beach but took a cab back.
The room was clean, the sheets were soft and the room was quiet.",5,2015,10,11
19,Barcelona Trip,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and we were so pleased with our stay at the Claris. The staff, facilities and location were perfect. It was recommended to stay away from the noisy areas so this hotel is in a great locale for quiet nights and great to walk to many of the tourist sites. We would highly recommend it. Also after a long day of touring the rooftop pool/bar are a great way to relax and rest up before your night out. The views were great too from up there.",5,2015,10,06
19,Upscale boutique hotel,"Upscale modern hotel within walking distance to heart of Barcelona activities.
Very high quality room furnishings and upscale lobby, elevators, hallways.
Two block walk to Las Ramblas-which is nice because you get the access without the noise and crowds of being on Las Ramblas.  Would stay again.",5,2015,10,04
19,"A lying front desk, poor housekeeping","Arrived for my 6 day stay, and was told my room would be ready at 2. Upon returning at 2:15, I was told the people in my 'allocated room' were accommodated with a late checkout, so now my room wouldn't be ready until at least 3 - so the hotel made 100€ on the late departure, but I was inconvenienced.  Another guest arrived while I was waiting and was given a room. I asked why I couldn't get any other room. The front desk gentleman looked shocked that I would even ask - and said he'd be right with me. But then another man came to check in ... he was told it would be a few minutes but then they shook hands and then he got a room. The Desk Attendant then addressed my question, saying both these men had paid for the prior night so they would be able to check in early. HE LIED  (the second guest confirmed to me he tipped him 20€, not paid for a prior night). When I returned to the front desk and asked for THE LIAR, I was told he wasn't available, and the woman apologized for her colleague. I finally got my room at 3:30. Several times thereafter, I asked for The Liar (and that is what I called him since they wouldn't tell me his name), I was always told he was busy elsewhere. He should be fired. They know who he is. 

This hotel advertises, website also, two restaurants with bars, but one has been closed for a long time with no signs of returning for business, and the other is open only for certain hours for lunch and dinner, with a late night pool bar. So nothing is available mid day. Poor. 

Housekeeping isn't supervised - my friends and I had to request replacement coffee and toilet paper after the third day, in both our rooms. Poor. 

Don't stay on the 6th floor since the pool and bar noise on 7 is constant on the ceiling throughout the late night and early morning hours. 

The doormen are very helpful as were other concierge staff. So, leaving and returning daily were pleasant. 

Claris is a poorly managed hotel, burning excessive incense in the hallways (why? to mask odors?). Not worth the money. Stay at The Majestic, around the corner.",2,2015,10,04
19,Good but could be better,"My wife and I booked our 5 day stay on a BA package and decided, thank goodness, to ask hotel for an upgrade to Executive room at extra cost. Our room (402) came with a king size bed but hardly anywhere to sit comfortably. We looked at 2 standard ""superior"" rooms on 1st floor which had no outlook and were tiny.
 The plug in our basin was reported 4 times to reception to be stuck either open or closed before it was repaired. 
The pillows and duvet are filled with foam but there is a pillow menu and we had our bolster pillow changed to feather but the duvet was too hot. 
There is no privacy for the toilet in the bathroom. 
On our last full day we asked at reception if we needed to ask them to book tickets for us for the Park Guell, a ""must see"" in all the guidebooks. Reception said no need as we can buy them there. After a 10 minute journey on Metro and a 50 minute slow climb up steep hill to the Park we found a queue of some 100 at ticket office and at 12:30pm were told that it would take one hour to get to front and then we might have to wait until 5:30 slot to gain access. A very helpful guide said we should have asked our hotel to get tickets online. So all way back down hill and train and back to hotel reception who never apologised but did then arrange timed tickets for our last morning. 
Finally service at breakfast leaves a lot to be desired of even a 2 star let alone a 5 star hotel. Ordered eggs with grilled tomatoes. Eggs arrived with apologetic waiter to say tomatoes would follow - they did 15 minutes later. Shame. Generally reception staff were helpful. Good position. But next time we will stay at the Majestic next door having seen their much better standard rooms and everywhere we went there we were greeted by friendly staff.",3,2015,10,04
19,"Was OK, but cannot recommend","I wanted to like this hotel, but lots of little things started to kind of bother me. Reception was OK, but they seemed confused by my reservation saying they ""upgraded"" me to a suite when I had actually booked a suite in the first place.  Umm...thanks.  They gave me a welcome bottle of champagne and a goodbye bottle of Rioja, which I thought was very nice. However, the minibar in the room was half-stocked, as if not refilled after the last guest.  The furnishings were unique and kind of cool, but the bed felt like a cot mattress and the bedspread looked very old and dated. They seemed to advertise themselves as a ""5"" star property, but the room was not at all appointed like a 5-star property - well, maybe from the mid-1900s.  They did not have standard amenities for your clothes, like an iron - and when I called to ask for one, they said they don't give them to guests, but would iron my shirts for me - only later did I find out they charged a notable fee for ironing (prices not indicated anywhere ahead of time) - this was kind of a turn-off, felt like nickel-and-dime'ing me after I already spent a significant amount on the reservation in the first place.  My room was set off the first floor ""Egyptian museum"" area, which they apparently rent out for private functions, since the last two days they had rearranged the space and put up a sign telling me to take an alternative route to the room - can't exactly say that made me feel very welcome...another turn-off.  The concierge was nice, but not particularly knowledgeable about restaurants or surroundings - she was literally ""googling"" places on her laptop.  The front-desk clerk at check-out also seemed to be in a bad mood, not very friendly at all.  The location was excellent though - perfect spot in Eixample.",3,2015,10,03
19,Not going back there in a hurry...,"The service was sadly not at all good. The hotel lost our luggage for 2 hours - not one member of the front desk / management formally apologised. The room we were allocated was completely unsuitable for a child as well as two adults - very cramped, with glass cabinets of artwork that a two year old child could easily hurt themselves on or damage. The reception was appalling - not only rude, but when i asked them for directions of where to pick my pre-booked Camp Nou tickets they sent me to the wrong part of barcelona - i ended up paying for another set of Camp Nou tickets in the end. When we arrived the restaurant on the top floor was completely empty and the staff just ignored us - we had wanted to get a drink but went elsewhere in the end. The ONLY thing that is good about this hotel is its location. BUT DON'T TAKE KIDS.",2,2015,09,30
19,I'd stay there again any time,"Located in the center of everything with easy access to the entire Metro system, this ""small"" hotel is delightful. The service is impeccable and the roof top dining area worth a visit all by itself. The Claris is a great place from which to launch your exploration of a wonderful city.",5,2015,09,30
19,Great location and service,"Arrived at 10.30 hrs - check in from 15.00 hrs. Suitcases we taken over by the staff wenn we entered the hotel and were brought to a secured room untill rooms were available. rooms ready at 14.00 hrs. Very clean, nice, good bathroom. the terrace on the roof is realy great with pool lounch chairs and tables. great ambiance. Staff is very friendly and helpfull. The location is great, 15 min walk from Segrada, 10 min from Gaudy area. Passei the Gracia with luxury shops around the corner. Take the train from the airport to Passaig de Gracia then 5 min walk to the hotel. Cheap and quick transport. € 9,95 - 1 ticket you can use for all travelers. Wenn we go to Barcelona again we will defenitely stay in Claris.",5,2015,09,29
19,Very accomodating staff,"Would have liked a waste basket in the bedroom area and did not like the overhead shower but these are very minor details when overall the staff made our stay so special.  From the doorman to the concierge advice, internet questions, housekeeping et al.  ",5,2015,09,28
19,It's The Little Things,"It's the little things. Little things like a door man, original art in every room, and a hotel staff that is stellar. 

It's the little things. Little things like welcome flowers, hand written notes, and great bath towels. It's the little things. 

It's the little things that make this hotel a big competitor. It's the little things that make big differences. It's the little things that make me have big love for Claris. ",5,2015,09,28
19,Great location for 1st visit to Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed here our first 3 nights in Spain - a great decision. The room was available early, which was great after an international flight. All staff, from breakfast dining room to doorman were multilingual and exceedingly accommodating. The decor was mod mixed with ancient Egyptian artifacts. Cozy bed, the plushest of bathroom towels, and blackout shade for the window - all fantastic. Chocolates on the pillows for turn-down service were delectable!",5,2015,09,26
19,Reception/concierge staff above and beyond.  Much gratitude to them.,"First, we had an urgent medical situation.  The reception/concierge staff went above and beyond to help us and support us.  For the service and support of the staff alone I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone!  We even thanked them with some chocolates; and they thanked us for the gesture with special water and special chocolates and big smiles! Amazing attitude to find in a big city boutique hotel.
Second, the hotel public areas are magnificent and interesting.  You could sell tickets to tour the hotel.
Third, on a negative note, the room design is more for design elements than for comfort.  Very stunning to look at but not the most comfortable for ""living"" in.   Of special concern is a step between the bed area and the rest of the suite that is hard to see in the day and almost impossible to see at night.  We had to leave the light on in the bathroom with the door open to the room to be sure we would not trip if we needed to use the bathroom during the night.  
Fourth, the hotel restaurant, gym, and pool are lovely. 
Would we return?  Yes but hope they mark the step better.",4,2015,09,26
19,Charming Boutique Hotel,"The Claris Hotel is a charming boutique hotel in the modern Eixample district of Barcelona.  The location is great since it is on a quiet side street, but is close to many of the major sites.  The staff at the hotel was most helpful, and recommended great tapas restaurants within walking distance.  We got connecting rooms that were clean, modern and perfect for our family.  The junior suite had a large, beautifully tiled bathroom with an awesome rain shower.  This hotel rivals the more expensive hotels and was a great value.",5,2015,09,23
19,Highly recommended,"The Claris Hotel is in a great location in the heart of Barcelona, and is good hotel in every way, style, service, cleanliness, services etc.  It was great value for money, and I would certainly use again if visiting Barcelona.  I highly recommend the hotel..
      ",5,2015,09,22
19,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a five star hotel.  I'm not really sure who designed our room (room 216) but it was inefficient.  We had no place to put our luggage.  It was very inconvenient to be working out of suitcases placed on the floor.  Really, no luggage racks.  This room is a suite which would have been better laid out if the ""living room"" area was downstairs and the ""bedroom"" area was upstairs.  The bathroom was beautiful and well appointed.  The decor of the room is beautiful, but the design was horrible.  Also, we had twin beds pushed together but made separately.  

Breakfast was difficult at best.  Some days we got to order and other days we were ignored.  There is always someone to refresh your coffee but they evidently can't take your order.  

Make sure you check your bill at checkout.  I was charged for minibar items I never used.  I was also charged for breakfast for one day (even through I was told that breakfast was included) but was there every morning.  Go figure!",3,2015,09,21
19,Hotel Claris Barcelone,We stayed at Hotel Claris in Barcelona during September.  This is a modern hotel a block off Passeige de Gracia.  Very convenient location within walking distance of many sites and close to metro stop.  The staff was extremely helpful with their recommendations.,5,2015,09,19
19,Great hotel for the price,"Myself and three friends stayed at the Claris on the way back from a trip to the Benicassim festival. We'd been staying in a tent in a heat wave in Spain for a week so anything with air conditioning would have seemed amazing, but the Hotel Claris really surpassed our expectations! The rooms were lovely- we went for one of the smaller rooms but we still had plenty of room to lounge around in each other's rooms. The black out blinds were fantastic and made for an excellent night's sleep when used with the air con! The staff were really attentive and polite, and didn't expect tips or anything which is a refreshing change (we had to chase the porter to give him his). Great location too. I would definitely recommend.",5,2015,09,17
19,Lovely little hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights for a city break and it was ideal, just off the Passeig de Gràcia and just 10 minutes walk from La Ramblas, it was ideally located.

Check-in was quick and easy and we were taken to our room and shown how everything worked. 

Room wasn't the biggest (I would have expected at least a queen size bed but it's a double) but was of a very high standard with nice little touches, like having your own unique piece of ancient relic/art piece in every room.

Rooms are turned over a couple of times a day, once in the morning and then again in the evening with chocolates on the pillow.

The only slight negative was that we were on the 6th floor, just under the roof terrace/bar/restaurant, so we could hear some noise from above, like tables/chairs moving, but nothing major.

The roof terrace is lovely with a small pool, loungers and seating. I can imagine it could be difficult to find a seat if it was busy but we didn't have a problem.

We had some tapa with some drinks in the evening which were really good.

The restaurant on the roof terrace was wonderful, food was brilliant and the staff were amazing, one of the best restaurants in Barcelona, and as a hotel guest you get 20% off food! Bargain!

Overall, a very nice hotel with excellent staff and an amazing  restaurant - highly recommend and can't wait to come back again.",5,2015,09,16
19,Claris,"Well located modern hotel just off passeig de Gracia. The rooms are very nice and newly decorated. Unfortunately, on the first night we were given a room on the street side and because of a faulty window was very noisy. The hotel were very good and we were moved and upgraded the next day. I would stay here again.",4,2015,09,16
19,"Nice, comfortable, but overpriced","Stayed in this hotel for a weekend in August. The hotel is beautiful and very comfortable, with good service but I would of expected more for the money I paid. Romantic and trendy.  Location wise the hotel was ok, a 5 minute walk from the metro and 20-30 minutes walk into the centre of the city but there were no bars, restaurants or attractions in the immediate vicinity. The drinks on the rooftop bar were a little bit overpriced and the bathroom would floor every time we had a shower.",3,2015,09,16
19,All that glitters is not gold,"Location fantastic, staff very good and welcoming, room adequate but not a 5 star rate, more like a 3 star. I would not go again. When staying in a hotel I expect it to do what it says, this did not. There is no attention to detail, in our room the light kept flickering, took them 2 days to repair, coffee available on the first day via 3 coffee capsules in room, after they had gone, one had to pay 3 euros per capsule. To me this is not acceptable, one had to pay for any water and coffeee, i do understand a mini bar and expect to pay for the soft drinks and alchoholic drinks etc, but water and coffee NO.
WiFi was intermitant in the room, the only place in the room we could get it was in the toilet. So there i was sitting on the toilet seat on my iPad, not a pretty site or very comfortable.
Sorry to be so negative but this was a trip for a friends birthday and the Hotel was the only thing that let the trip down.",2,2015,09,15
19,Fading Dowager in Tony Neighborhood,"Having stayed in a similarly located Derby Group hotel in Madirid, we had some expectations - for good and for ill.  Hotel Claris enjoys an excellent location, just a short two blocks from Passig de Gracia in chi chi  Eixample area of Barcelona.  An early morning arrival, without benefit of requested early check in, did nothing to advertise the delights of the hotel, what with overstaffed but unhelpful desk folk and a 
lobby whose furnishings had seen better days.  However, general stylishness prevailed and promised original collection of art was more or less in evidence, and the hotel is decently-priced relative to other (newer) luxury properties in Barcelona.

A junior suite well-accommodated our four day stay.  Room was quiet and attractive but poorly appointed.  Absurdly oversized towels that couldn't be hung and therefore reused do not a luxury make, nor does searching for a place to deposit traveler refuse.

Breakfast room and offering were very fine. A delightful if wee (crowded) pool on the roof and pricey drinks from inattentive attendants were enjoyed, if only for the lovely view and breeze.  ""Signature"" restaurant available only for lunch, where generous pour of wine and enjoyment of the rooftop setting outweighed the disappointing eats.",3,2015,09,15
19,Average,The hotel is well presented initially and the room size was okay. The hotel is well located. I room was not well cleaned and there was a lot of small things I was not happy with. The location was one of the best features of this hotel,3,2015,09,14
19,Modern stylish very nice hotel close in a good position,"Very stylish designer hotel, good position close to the center, nice rooms, very nice but very small pool on the roof, which was always full, very difficult practically impossible to get a free space to try it. On the same roof very nice bar and restaurant. Breakfast room on the basement floor, quality of breakfast and service - excellent. Excellent service in general.",4,2015,09,13
19,Amazing!,My boyfriend and I stayed here for the first few days of our euro trip and loved every minute. A beautiful hotel right in the center of town with super accommodating staff and the suite we were upgraded to was gorgeous.  The views from the rooftop deck were unbelievable and the tapas and wine delicious. Definitely a must stay.,5,2015,09,12
19,Very disappointing ,"This is supposedly a 5 star hotel but for me it's a 4 star one
Rooms are small and starting be tired. I must admit that we booked this hotel because the price was very interesting... We did see that review score was not that good but decided to try it anyway. However the score reflects the reality , this hotel is a decent 4 star but not a 5 star. I will not repeat and not recommend . If you get it for a price a 4 star go ahead , if price is not an issue I can recommend many other 5 stars in Barcelona ",3,2015,09,09
19,Delightful experience overall,"There are fancier and more exclusive hotels a few minutes walk away, but we had a wonderful near-five-star experience here.

The location was perfect, off a quiet side street from the Passeig de Gracia. The building was charming, decorated in a hip, modern style and completely full of Asian and Egyptian art, which was much appreciated. The staff was likewise helpful, and the PR manager walked us to our rooms, where complimentary wine and chocolates were waiting. 

We had a junior suite connecting to a twin bedroom. Both were very interestingly decorated and I mean this sincerely - more Asian art, bare light bulbs, and oil painted portraits of what I assumed to be Spanish gentlemen. There isn't much closet space, so if you have a lot of luggage, you may want to request a larger room. Our bathroom was tiled with gold and black and the shower had a huge rainfall shower, which pleased everyone. Housekeeping was exceptional - everything was spotless. Our only complaints were:

1) a conspicuous lack of trash cans - there was one tiny one only in the bathroom and this was the same situation in the other rooms as well

2) some traffic noise late at night

3) lack of bedside table space. I believe my bedside table was a small wooden three legged stool - charmingly carved but it didn't provide much useful space.

The pool, though small, was a great little oasis and the bar next to it was a very pretty and relaxing spot. The breakfast was exceptional! The hot items like omelettes and pancakes were cooked to order, and the variety of cold items (which included many different Spanish pastries) went far beyond my expectations for a continental breakfast. The manager and staff here were very hospitable as well.

The hotel was great value for our money. We would have given them 4.5 stars but rounded up to 5, and would not hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2015,09,07
19,Barcelona/Claris,"Great accomodations.  The personnel were extremely helpful and the facility was in excellent shape.  The room was very nice.  Suggestions: Rm 516 needs a stop so the door handle does not hit the mirrored door to the bathroom.  The bathroom was vey nice but a small shelf would be good in the shower for soap, razor,..the concierge was helpful with recommendations.  The bar and restaurant upstairs was the best that we experienced in Barcelona.
The hotel location was excellent for us.
      
      ",5,2015,09,06
19,"Lovely hotel, great location and service","Just returned from a super 2 days in Barcelona as part of a group of 10 work colleagues on a jolly. 

Arrived at the hotel around 10.30am, two rooms available for early check in which was great as it allowed us to drop bags and freshen up quickly before heading out for the day. 

We were all placed in close location to each other on 6th floor. My colleague and I had been given a double rather than a twin so we swapped with a single colleague next door who was delighted. 

Our new room was lovely. Two good twin beds. Lots of wardrobe and draw space,  a huge TV, hairdryer, dressing gowns and good selection of toiletries. We also had a nice sitting area with sofa so we had plenty of room.

At night, the room was hugely comfortable, the best room air con I've experienced in a hotel for a long time, the shower was amazing and I had the best nights sleep I've had in a hotel in a long time.

The only thing which was missing from our room which we could have really done with was tea or coffee making facilities. Especially as we know our colleagues two doors down had the joy of a coffee machine in theirs! 

The roof terrace on floor 7 was a great place to kick off the day with either coffee or cocktails and the pool was lovely.

Breakfast was fantastic. A great and huge cold buffet selection, service was very good, friendly and fast with lots of coffee available. Cooked breakfast was available by order and the selection was good. The pancakes with streaky bacon and maple syrup received raving reviews from my colleagues who had them. 

All the staff at this hotel were very friendly and very helpful. The doorman was a lovely man too, who was a joy to see on a return of a long day sightseeing, who always had a huge smile to great us.  

Would definitely recommend and stay there again if in the area. 
Pictures attached are views from the roof top terrace.",4,2015,09,06
19,"Beautiful hotel, with roof top swimming pool, walking distance to centre","We stayed in the Claris hotel in a deluxe suite, that had a sitting room with pull out sofa bed for 11 yr old, a great bathroom and then a comfortable stylish bedroom.  Aircon & opening windows.  Hotel is located a few minutes walk from La Perdera, and 5-10 mins walk from La Rambla & Catalonia square for shopping & restaurants.  it had valet parking, roof top bar, restaurant and swimming pool.  The service was fantastic, they couldn't be more helpful if they tried.  We enjoyed the breakfast which was amazingly presented, you could choose hot food cooked to order or cold buffet.  Great location & service.",5,2015,09,04
19,Quality hotel quiet but near the city's attractions,"It is the second time we have stayed here and the standard is still excellent. Were had a junior suite on the sixth floor which was mostly peaceful. We did suffer some noise from the neighbouring room's jacuzzi which they used in the early hours. 

The food at the roof terrace restaurant is high quality and the service is both very friendly and highly professional. 

Their rooftop pool can get busy easily but is worth using. The sun loungers are in need of updating. 

Overall it was an enjoyable City break. 

The hotel does have incense burners on reach floor and we didn't think the smell was very attractive.",4,2015,09,03
19,perfect getaway with friends!,"I had a amazing stay at this hotel!
Stayed in a grand duplex suite and it was beautiful, it had everything we needed we even hosted some after parties at the room with our friends!
Excellent service at the rooftop terrace restaurant and great food!
And not to forget the bed was super the linnen everything top quality!
i would recommend this hotel",5,2015,09,02
19,The best value for money!,"amazing hotel and staff , rooms are big and comfortable the roof terrace with the  pool is breathtaking. Metro is 5 min away And a lot of great breakfast cafes and bars around the hotel! We were planing our trip for a long time and saw dozens of other hotels but we cannot be happier that we choose Claris hotel!
      ",5,2015,09,01
19,Perfect for a weekend away!,"We have just returned from an incredible stay at the Claris Hotel. As soon as we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a junior suite, what a treat! A very comfortable room indeed including a rainfall shower, jacuzzi bath, coffee machine and toiletries - any hotel which stocks white company amenities is always good in my eyes! The statement decor made it feel like you were in an individually decorated room rather than a basic hotel room. A lovely stay altogether! Gracias ",5,2015,09,01
19,Great Staff,"On entering the Claris all was cool marble and quiet sophistication. Immediately we were given a glass of champagne which was a lovely touch. We were given a quick check in, but as we arrived very early in the morning, our room was not ready which was expected. The location is great and we walked out of the hotel to explore. Round the corner we visited a lovely neighbourhood cafe then carried on enjoying the Eixample area. Later when we returned to the Claris we were delighted with our hotel room. We had paid for the most ordinary room but it more than surpassed our expectations. Great  attention to detail - even a jewellery drawer! It was my birthday and the hotel sent to the room a bottle of cava and chocolates. At breakfast time I was given chocolate cake complete with candle too. I was very impressed. The staff everywhere in the hotel went out of their way to be friendly, approachable and smiley especially in the breakfast room. Breakfast  was impressive and again a very pretty room. The roof terrace  was quite contemporary and laid out with designer chairs, lights, sofas and beds and is a great asset to the hotel. All in all the Claris Hotel impressed me with its attention to detail and  the wonderful staff and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to everyone.",5,2015,09,01
19,Excellent for a city stay.,"Stayed at the Claris for one night on 31st August 2015.

Overall this is one of the best Hotels I have ever stayed in, I travelled with my wife and two teenagers.
It is a shame that I cannot attribute my comments to individuals as I did not see any name badges.
Going through our experience chronologically our taxi was met by the doorman and a porter who took all our cases and bags leaving us to book in. We were 5 hrs early so I expected that our rooms would not be available at that point so dropping the bags and getting into Barcelona was our priority.
Reception staff were welcoming polite and efficient and spoke very much better English than my Spanish. Our bags were quickly labelled and stored and we were taken to the lounge area where a charming young lady got us a drink, explained the facilities at the hotel and answered any questions we had.
We had booked a junior suite and a twin room for the kids and the hotel picked up on this without us having to mention it. We ended up in 516 and 515 which I can recommend to anyone as very nicely designed and decorated rooms with the facilities you would expect. Rooms are separate and do not interconnect but are accessed through a communal entrance via card key and then individually again by card key.
Following a few hours waliking around in Barcelona we returned to the hotel.
(Passeg de Gracia is a 3 minute walk then head down hill and you will get to Playa Catalunya which is a large square with fountains and from there you can access La Rambla walking down towards Barceloneta.)

Bags brought up to our rooms where everything was stylishly decorated, very clean and air con was spot on as  Barcelona seemed very hot that day.
Complimentary water was delivered by room service, as was an ice bucket  on request.
There is a small pool and very nice but pricey restaurant and bar on the roof of the hotel which we did not eat in but had drinks in the afternoon and at the end of the evening which I would strongly recommend as  it was atmospheric and very chilled out. Again staff were attentive and pleasant.
We returned to the room to find that the beds had been re made and the rooms tidied. ( Sorry about the teenagers room) A freshly cut rose had been left in our room for my wife and chocolates on the bed. All nice touches.
Beds were very comfortable and we all had a great nights sleep.
Checkout was as efficient as check in, reception staff very pleasant and appeared to be genuinely interested in whether everything had been a good experience for us..

In summary, the hotel is very nice but the service and pleasant welcoming staff made it special. I would use the Claris or any Derby hotel without hesitation as a result, so...  
Muchas Gracias, el hotel y especialmente el personal eran excelentes.

19,Home sweet home in Barrio de Gracias,"An exquisite treat in the heart of Barca, a must stay hotel that truly lives up to its sparkling five star service and amenities. Upon entering the hotel lobby and rooms, there is an immediate homey feeling as you are immersed in high quality interior design, everything carefully placed and effortlessly makes you feel comfortable. During our first evening the staff arrived to the room with gifts; a small bottle of Rioja red, a bottle of water and chocolate almond treats. As we entered and left the hotel, we were always warmly greeted by the doorman on duty - a beaming smile and family feel. Finally, our second evening, upon returning from dinner across town, our bed had been re-made, bed side mats were placed and our fluffy slippers were laid out with a chocolate treat at each bedside. Thank you Hotel Claris for the sweet dreams and stay!",5,2015,08,29
19,Perfect,The staff at the front desk was extremely  helpful and knowledgeable .  At first we felt we may have chosen a hotel a little too posh and swanky to be any fun but the location was perfect and the accommodation  perfect. Extremely  clean and professional in every way  ,5,2015,08,27
19,Friendly,"A bit somber atmosphere, could ve had a bit more modern look. But nice clean rooms. Breakfast was an absolute treat, speedy service, fresh, nutritional food. 
Their wifi solution is a bit unstable, but work ok. Great location, friendly people, great pool on roof. ",4,2015,08,27
19,Perfect location,"Booked this hotel last minute we has an executive room, wow it was beautiful we had an amazing bed with a beautiful antique bed head and modern bathroom on the first floor, there was a mezzanine floor with a beautiful lounge area. A few reviews mention the hotel being noisy due to the floors, it was but not enough to spoil your stay, and every evening beautiful slippers were supplied so if used the noise is eliminated.
Location is fantastic right in the heart of sights, shops, bars and restaurants beautiful hotels with nice added touches.
We would return to this hotel again.",5,2015,08,24
19,Great central hotel in Barcelona ,"Just returned from a wonderful 5 night stay in Barcelona. Great location, fabulous rooms, friendly staff and good facilities. Walking distance to most tourist sights. We were a large group of 9 and the hotel staff really went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. ",5,2015,08,24
19,Wow!!! Great Stay!,"Hotel is in fantastic location for visiting tourists. Metro station only a 5 minute walk. Hotel staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast well what can I say, great selection of cold servings and order service for anything else. Breakfast staff made it for us, thanks to all involved. The wife felt like a princess being called ""My Lady"" as she was handed a glass of champagne. Overall I don't think you would be able to find a better hotel in Barcelona.",5,2015,08,23
19,Great Boutique Hotel,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We spent 4 nights in Barcelona following our wedding. On arrival we mentioned our recent marriage and we were upgraded to a junior suite which was beautiful. The room was spacious and had my favourite White Company toiletries, a jacuzzi bath and a nice lounge area. 

The pool and terrace are an amazing addition to the hotel and great for a dip after a day of sightseeing or shopping. We frequently started our evenings with a drink on the roof before heading our for dinner. 

The hotel is also in a fantastic location; Eixample. Friends have always raved about Las Rambles, but I found it quite touristy. Eixample on the other hand was quiter and we found many great bars and resturants on side streets than didn't have lots of tourists in them. 

Finally, the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel generally had a nice boutique feel.",5,2015,08,23
19,Great hotel and good location,I've never been so crazy about hotels in Barcelona but the Claris made a difference. Great hotel with an amazing roof terrace. Rooms are clean and modern. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others.,4,2015,08,19
19,Boutique feel with 4 star service,"The Claris hotel is modern classy hotel situated in the heart of Eixample (pronounced ""e-shamplay in case you were curious). For just a few days I felt like a 5th Avenue socialite! 

My friends and I stayed in two rooms for four nights this past month prior to departing on a Mediterranean cruise. Our first night the shower head was broken and we had a flood at 2 am in our bathroom. It was cleaned up immediately with an apology note and bottle of wine in our room the next morning. The rooms were small, but being in the heart of Barcelona I think it is pretty common. In my room the windows were fantastic and we heard nothing from the street below. However, 4 rooms down, my friend heard all the street traffic as well as the foot traffic from late owls on the roof Saturday night.  I guess be thoughtful in which room you are placed in. The best part of the hotel is its location. It is two blocks from Casa Batllo, 10 minutes from Casa Mila, and 15 minutes to La Rambla. What I appreciated most from the hotel was the fact that they let us keep our luggage in the storage a WEEK after checking out when he had one afternoon to kill upon return of our cruise. I was stressing about it the entire week prior and they immediately said that it was no problem.   

If you can afford it, I would recommend this hotel. It is expensive, but well spent.",5,2015,08,17
19,Lovely but loud,"While this hotel is lovely and in a great location, I find it to be loud. The floors aren't carpeted so I can here the family above me walking around, using the bathroom and flushing their toilet. I hear voices and coughing. Not sure why but the hotel lights incense in the hallways - not a fan. If your room is near the elevator you may need to ask them not to light it. Wish we had spent the extra money to stay one block away at the Majestic. We did enjoy the rooftop bar and the restaurant up there is outstanding. Bring a white noise machine if you stay here in case you have loud neighbors or neighbors with a dog. Instead of sleeping in past 7:30 this morning, I'm up writing this review. ",2,2015,08,15
19,Good Location,"We visited Barcelona for my 40th Birthday and with so many hotels it was difficult to choose but went for Claris as we wanted something special and it was in a good location. The check-in was simple enough with the very small glass of champagne most welcome, however there were a number of staff at the desk and it didn't seem clear which one of them was attending to us. 
The hotel, and room, was fine for what we were looking for, we were out and about so much we actually spent very little time there, but it was lacking a few touches that I would have expected for a 5* Hotel - notably no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. 
After reading lots of reviews here of little touches for special occasions I must say I was disappointed that my special birthday passed with not so much as an extra chocolate on my pillow at turndown. 
On the plus side, the location is excellent and we walked to many of the main attractions including the Sagrada Familia which was around 15-20 minutes (excluding the stop off for a cold beer!). 
The rooftop pool area is lovely and was never too crowded, we did spend a couple of hours here relaxing before dinner one day and managed a swim, with the waiting staff very attentive, and we ate at the rooftop restaurant on our last evening which I would definitely recommend. 
All in all, it was a pleasant and enjoyable stay but with so many other hotels to choose from I would probably try somewhere else next time.",4,2015,08,14
19,"Nice Hotel, Centrally Located","Claris Hotel is good, located around Barcelona's Passeig De Gracia, one of the main shopping streets of barcelona and a 15 min walking from La Rambla. The hotel's interior is classy, the rooms size is acceptable. We had a smelly room for the kids first that was changed the second day when we complained about it. For a 5 Stars Hotel, the price/quality ratio is good.",4,2015,08,13
19,What a relief ,"After having a horrific experience with AirBNB this hotel quickly accommodated a group of 10. Rooms were clean staff was friendly and modern decor was tasteful. The rooftop pool was really a plus. Two blocks away from high end shops ""Chanel, Prada etc.""",5,2015,08,13
19,Noise,When you walk in the Claris you are greeted by the friendly doorman and bellman. As well as the friendly receptionists who try to help in anyway they can. We got there before three so we did not expect to get our room but they assured us they would do their best to get it. So we went to have breakfast and it was lovely. The combination of the buffet and menu were perfect and the food was very tasty. We never explored the lunch options so I can't comment. They ended up getting our room to us early. Our room was quaint we had everything we asked for. The major problem was the out door noise which was absolutely unbearable. You should not have to bring earplugs to a 5 star hotel. We could not sleep through the entire night because of constant traffic and the three am garbage truck dumping glass bottles. We asked to switch rooms but the other rooms faced the street as well. Other than the noise we had a lovely stay and hope to see this problem fixed.,3,2015,08,10
19,Never again,"If this is a five star hotel then I do not understand who rated them. It actually started pleasantly with great staff at check-in. All perfect although the room was very small.
Then wanted to have on drink on the roof top terrace. First, there was no more food available (at 12:30am) although it said it was open till 1am. Then we sat at the pool where we couldn't even get any chips or snacks. Although the terrace was supposed to be open till 2am they turned off the music at 1:30am started to clear up. Totally unfriendly staff too. The said they had to do this cause of management. Anyway, they kicked all guests out. In the elevator we couldn't get out properly cause it was broken. Then tried tot order from room service. First they said its too late. Never ever again. The hotel is a nightmare.",1,2015,08,09
19,Friendly and Modern,"My stay was for two nights. Upon arrival the porter rushed to help with the bags ✅ The staff at reception were very welcoming and on a hot, humid summers day, it was a wonderful touch being asked if I'd like a drink while I check in (water, juice or champagne!). The checkin process was flawless.
FREE WIFI
The room was clean, modern and all the little touches such as bathroom amenities were included.  I even received a nightly turn down service each night, with chocolate, without asking.
The location was perfect, being within walking distance of everything you'd want to do and see in Barcelona.

19,Great Location and even better staff,"I JUST STAYED AT THE Hotel Claris,  I found the hotel's Staff to be superb, They couldn't be more helpful.  The rooftop bar / pool was terrific for a sunset cocktail .

I heard that the food at their restaurant was great however i didn't go there. The location is great its at the north end of  La Rambla, and in the shopping district",5,2015,08,08
19,Don't be fooled by the stars...,"Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and the experience got worse each night... Terrible food options, barely anything on the menu, the in-room fridge does not work, internet (when working) is very slow and must refresh the registration page every time my iPad locks. A 5 star hotel that does not offer complementary water... Club sandwich was soggy, salad with no dressing... For the rate I paid, you can stay a branded hotel such as the Marriott. ",1,2015,08,08
19,"Pleased, would stay again","Overall pleased and would stay here again. Having the pool made a huge difference to us. I liked the decor, the staff were all nice, and I thought the incense smell was pleasant. Comfortable beds and black out blinds so I had a great sleep each night.

Few minor negatives - 1) the toilet and bidet were so close to each other I kept banging my knees on the bidet (not all rooms are like this but ours was). 2) the wardrobe is split in half horizontally so there is no space to hang a dress properly. 3) there are no irons to iron your own clothes - if you want anything ironing you have to pay the hotel to do it so that means planning ahead as well as paying. 4) I think €3.75 for a small water out of the minibar is quite steep - most 5 star hotels give you a bottle per person free per night. The bar upstairs was fairly reasonable given the location.",4,2015,08,08
19,Rooms are ok but nothing special,"The location of this hotel is good, and the lobby and main areas are nice and modern. However the rooms are far from what you would expect from a 5 star Luxury hotel. Rooms are small, no views at all. The bathroom is very small and no luxury at all. It would be nice for a 4 star hotel, but for sure not 5*L... The wifi connection is very poor and you can barely connect.",3,2015,08,07
19,Too old by now,"This hotel was probably nice 5-7 years ago, but it hasn't been renovated since and it shows. Design is outdated and tacky (golden ceiling???), light switch fell off when I entered the room and touched it.

Cleaning crew doesn't pay attention to detail - forgot to leave shampoo, conditioner, soap. 

Front desk staff is friendly and helpful, and it's a great location. The hotel just needs to be renovated.",3,2015,08,06
19,Great location and value,"We traveled as an extended family in September and thought this hotel was pitch perfect.  Not exactly cheap, but the location made it easy to walk to a lot of key sights and restaurants.  They have a charming roof top bar/restaurant with a very small pool that made for a refreshing respite after a day of site seeing.  The rooms are comfortable and well designed, with sleek wood appointments.  However, they are on the small side - this doesn't bother us, but it may for some.",4,2015,08,05
19,Honeymoon Stay,"We arrived around 11pm at Hotel Claris and check in was quick and easy and reception staff were lovely. Everything was explained to us clearly and we made our way to the room. The room was exactly what we had booked and in immaculate condition, there was even a bottle of Champagne and a note congratulating us to start our celebration! Our stay for 5 nights went as planned and the hotel was very helpful in answering any questions we had regarding touring the sites of the city. We found the city itself beautiful and safe, we cant wait to come back! On our last night there was a lovely bottle of red wine and another note thanking us for our stay, a very nice touch to finish our last night in Barcelona! When we make it back to Barcelona we will be staying here again! ",5,2015,08,05
19,Claris Hotel,"Great property! Great location! Wonderful staff! Rooms are very well appointed and very clean. Loved the signature amenities.
You will need reservations to eat in the restaurant or you will be stuck with a limited menu in the roof top bar.
      
      
      ",5,2015,08,04
19,Very average,"I was a bit disappointed by Hotel Claris.  I spent a lot of time looking at different hotels before booking for a couple of days at the end of July.  The greeting from reception was friendly and despite being early I was given a room.  I had booked a stay and dine offer which included breakfast and a welcome cocktail - no mention of this however.  Took some time to get reception to add in the breakfast and then I had to ask again for the cocktail voucher.  This was for two guests but as it was only me I was just given the one!  The room was okay - simple and pretty basic.  Nice linen and clean but dingy and overlooking ugly apartments in poor state of repair.  No Nespresso machine in my room so these clearly are not included in all the rooms!  The gym is not really a gym but just a couple of pieces of equipment - a real shame as again this was one of the reasons I booked the hotel ... I expected a lot more from a 5 star.  The walls are thin too so I was woken early due to noise in the corridor and neighbouring room.  Breakfast was simple - again, not the standard I would expect for a 5 star hotel.  The setting is pretty unpleasant too - located in the basement without any views or atmosphere. Even on the morning I had time to spare I was done in 15 minutes and got on with the day.  When I checked out I was charged the wrong price and spent a long time working with the reception to adjust the bill to match what I had on my reservation.  All of this was done with a smile but shouldn't have happened in the first place.  Overall, this wasn't the luxury stay I had imagined and I would not return.  There are other better hotels for a similar price (or cheaper) in the area.",3,2015,08,04
19,Great hotel with exceptional service!,I stayed at the hotel with my family for 4 nights. The service was exceptional. The staff goes completely out of their way to satisfy your needs and focus on making your stay memorable. I would also like to compliment the concierge staff because they work very hard to find the right restaurants during your stay and help you navigate your way around the city. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,08,03
19,Not 5 star,"5 star hotel,room is ok but not wow. Pool area is small but nice. Gym is a joke. Staff is friendly and location is good,away from the tourist areas. Its easy to reach metro and main streets from the hotel. Its not a good choice if you wanna relax and be at the pool all day due to the small pool area. Its great for a weekend.",3,2015,08,02
19,Superb hotel with exceptional service! ,"Myself and my family stayed at Claris Hotel for 4 nights. It was my daughters 21st Birthday, which the hotel were aware of and went above and beyond. 

They accommodated both our rooms on the same floor, next to each other without any quibble. They arranged for a bouquet of white roses to be in my daughters room, along with recommending and calling several bakeries in the area to arrange a birthday cake on a Sunday. 

The breakfast was lovely, a full selection of everything continental with very attentive staff topping up with fresh orange juice, coffee and tea. 

The roof top terrace is beautiful, a lovely setting to enjoy a glass of (reasonable) rosé cava at sunset. The pool area is cosy however spacious in comparison to most roof top hotels in Barcelona, such as Hotel Majestic. 

My daughter fainted during breakfast on our last day and was taken to hospital. The restaurant manager was superb along with the rest of the breakfast staff. The General Manager, Jose and Alex, Rooms Divisional Manager came straight down to attend to the scene and went to the local pharmacy to purchase a heart rate monitor. The reception rejigged our rooms (as we were due to check out at 12noon) and allowed my daughter to remain and rest in the room upon return from hospital. 

I could not fault the exceptional service of all of the staff at Hotel Claris, from house keeping to reception to waiter staff. Excellent English spoken and understood by all, with a friendly demeanour shown by all staff. 

A huge thanks to Jose and his staff, a credit to the management team at Hotel Claris. 

We will be returning very soon. ",5,2015,07,27
19,Nice hotel. Great location.,"Nice place to stay close to Pl Catalunya. Good location for shopping, eating and near to tourist attraction. We'd a great time in Barcelona during this trip. Staff is very helpful. We could walk to lot of nearby places. Right in the middle of shopping district. Most of key tourist attractions are close by. 
      
      ",5,2015,07,26
19,so Unwelcoming.,"We had great expectations when we booked as they claim it is a five star property and reviews on tripadvisor were not so bad. Wish I had paid more attention to the negative comments as they seem to have turned out to be true!

Arrived at the hotel around 11 am for a 5 nights reservation that was made and paid about 7 months in advance. Porters were prompt to take care of our luggage right from the taxi. 

Entered the hotel, impression of the lobby- it is a 3 star Lobby Which they are trying to color and paint to make it look like 5 star. There is a pond area with plastic koi and plastic leaves on a tree. I am sure they consider this an art!

Went to reception, that is where the problems started. There are always 2-3 young ladies at the reception desk who would not smile or even make a notice of you until you tap on the counter and ask a question. Anyway, was informed in very cold tone that rooms are not ready and to check back in 2 hrs.  That's it. No further info on when they could be ready and no offer for water or any drink! Went outside after giving them the luggage and had a lunch. Came back around 1 pm and asked about the status of the rooms and again, same answer, "" check back in 2 hrs "" .

While it is understandable that they are not obliged to give us rooms before 3 pm,  it is also expected that they will be more curtious and will work to get us rooms asap. 
Anyway, asked for water and was literally pointed to the tiny bar that hotel has!
That is when I had to ask for a manager and Ricardo, the manager came in and somehow the rooms miraculously appeared ready in 15 minutes. The request for side by side rooms was not granted and was advised to check back next day if we need one. 
What's up with this check back thingy? If you are a five star hotel, you don't ask the customer to check back. Instead you take matters in your hand and follow up with customer. Ricardo mentioned that he will have Victoria see me in the morning next day but nobody appeared for 5 days we were there, although I saw and crossed Victoria many times in the main Lobby. 

Wanted to have help from doorman , pancho to help translate in Spanish as I was trying to hire taxi to go to Montsarret. Instead he starts pushing for a tour to be arranged from concierge despite of me mentioning many times that we don't want to take the tour and already have had talked with concierge! He argued to a point that I had to leave the conversation. That was not the worst part though, after this, he never greeted me or even opened the door for me! He would just look at other direction when I was crossing the door!

Any way, the location is good. Closed to las ramblas and Garcia street and other stuff is also about 10€ taxi ride. That being said, Barcelona is not a very big city to begin with.

The rooms are hit and miss. We had 2 rooms, one was good and other was ok. Size was reasonable. Shower and linen were the only things close to 5 star but still not quite there.

While checking out, we noticed a charge of breakfast that we never had and mentioned to the receptionist and she took it out! Looking at previous reviews, this seem to be happening very frequently and you wonder how and why! 

I thought, it was necessary to write all this as many other 5 star reviews seem to be misleading. 

The place is seriously lacking customer service. The only employees that are worth mentioning in positive note are the porters. Those 2-3 younger men know way more about 5 star hospitality than any other employees in the hotel, including manager. 

Victoria was there for most days of our stays but no effort was made to make things better for us except for  a bottle of wine that was sent to our room which we did not accept as we were not looking for freebies. I feel true customer center approach is needed rather than just responding to tripadvisor reviews and using all that genetic language. 

We will not stay at this hotel again, ever and as a matter of fact will not use any Derby hotels in London, Paris or anywhere else anymore.",2,2015,07,26
19,Lovely Surprise,"We had never heard of this hotel and found it to be delightful. With a large room for my daughter-in-law and granddaughter to share with me, we had a terrific dinner at the rooftop restaurant and found the staff to be especially helpful. Upon checkout, however, I found that the previous night's dinner was charged to the room although we had paid for it separately with a credit card. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and when showed the credit card receipt, they immediately took it off, it is a good lesson about reviewing your bill and saving receipts.  In spite of this, I would definitely return!",5,2015,07,25
19,"Excellent location, amazing staff","Had an incredible time in Barcelona and this hotel had a lot to do with it.  Amazing location, you can walk to so many restaurants, shopping, museums.  The staff helped us every time we needed something, they really went above and beyond to make sure we were happy.  Make sure you visit the rooftop pool and go have the cannelloni in the roof top restaurant (with Massimo, the best waiter in all of Barcelona) - it was the best thing we ate the entire week we were in Spain!  We will be back, thanks to everyone at this amazing hotel.",5,2015,07,22
19,"Junior suite, average rooms, lovely waitstaff and porters","We stayed for one night at the Claris gratis due to an error with a booking at their sister apartment hotel. We stayed in a junior suite which consisted of a small living room and bedroom. The rooms are decorated nicely but are very dark. Also, you have to enter the bedroom to get to the bathroom so if someone happened to be sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room, then they would likely be disturbing those sleeping in the bedroom by using the bathroom as the bathroom has no door.
The waitstaff in the pool restaurant were lovely and helpful, as were the porters who assisted with our bags and were always smiling and welcoming. The reception staff were average.
The pool can be crowded and there are few sun beds.
If I had paid for this room then I would have been overall disappointed.",3,2015,07,21
19,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"Great quality hotel, clean, smell good and great service. We stayed in the Grand Suite Duplex, very unique and wonderful room. Everything worked great and was high quality. Very close to shopping but on a quieter street. Only one restaurant in the hotel, which is outside seating only. I travel often and this was one of the more memorable hotels I've stayed in.",5,2015,07,20
19,"Worth every Dollar ""Euro""","Visiting Barcelona for a wedding my sister in law booked us at the Hotel Claris. The Hotel is one of 4 (Barcelona, Madrid, London and Paris) luxury Hotels by Derby Hotels. This property is luxurious, has a great staff, conveniently located in the heart of Barcelona and is very affordable. The rooms are specious, unusual for European Hotels. All rooms are equipped with a Nespresso Machine with unlimited free Nespresso Capsules. I will definitely try the other Derby properties when I get a chance.",5,2015,07,19
19,Very unique,"The hotel was very comfortable... Lots and lots of pillows. Also the towels and robes were super soft. The staff was very helpful although they were not able to check us in early.

Thanks to the front desk staff for all of your wonderful advice :)",5,2015,07,17
19,Great hotel Great location,"This is one of my favorite hotels in Barcelona. It has been the forth time I stay here. Service is impeccable, staff very friendly, room is very good. My only problem this time was the TV. I came late to the room and there was no way I could get the TV to work. Since it was very late didn't want to have someone come to get it fixed so I went to sleep. Still something to be looked into. Room was 515.",4,2015,07,16
19,5* Luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"Our long weekend stay at the Claris was truly a luxurious experience deserving of their 5 stars.  Check in included a cool glass of Cava and we were indeed made to feel very welcome by all the attentive staff. Our beautiful boutique designer room included all amenities you would expect.  Toiletries from The White Company, fully stocked minibar, room safe, flat screen TV,  White fluffy robes and slippers, electric blackout blinds and lots of comfy pillows and cushions.  Shortly after, we were presented with a bottle of Cava and exquisite chocolates to celebrate our special occasion and we thank the hotel management for this very kind gesture.  As we were late in arriving we made reservations at the rooftop restaurant and enjoyed a lovely meal.  The roof terrace included a pool and bar area which we used most evenings.  Lovely way to end a day sightseeing. Special thanks to the doorman, Poncho (Satchmo) who really took care of us.  Hotel is In fairly quiet location just 2mins walk from the bustling Passeig de Gracia.  Would highly recommend the Claris for couples seeking that perfect, boutique hideaway to celebrate that special occasion.",5,2015,07,15

Location:  in Barcelona within walking distance to great restaurants and close to hop on hop off bus routes.  Great spot to be able to enjoy seeing the city from.h

Hotel room: we stayed in a duplex suite.  The level of luxury was excellent.  From the soft bed and mattress to the bathroom with the nice shower.. Our bathroom also was a steam shower which was very relaxing for after long day sightseeing.  The mini bar was stocked well and we found this suite to be perfect to pamper ourselves after long day sightseeing.

Overall experience was a very romantic weekend enjoyed in a hotel that payed attention to details.  Thank you for a great Barcelona experience.",5,2015,07,13

19,Honeymoon 2015,"We stayed here for 5 nights July 2015 on our honeymoon.
We couldn't have picked a better hotel!
The staff were all helpful and professional, from reception to the bar staff and housekeeping. 
The room was immaculate and cleaned daily, you can just put a little note on the bed if you want fresh sheets.
We enjoyed a few cocktails on the Roof terrace and sunbathed by the pool a fair amount and again the staff were all really helpful and friendly and professional. They play some really good chilled out music on the terrace during the day and evening. 

We ordered room service one evening and it was fantastic! Great food and great service. 
The hotel is within walking distance of casa batllo and casa mila, so would recommend visiting them. Las rambles is about 15-20 minute walk or €5 ish in a cab. Plenty of lovely restaurants around the hotel.

Couldn't be happier with our stay and would recommend to anyone travelling to Barcelona and wanting to be in a central location with a touch of luxury. We will definitely be back!",5,2015,07,12

19,Service with Smiles!!!!,"We stayed at this beautiful gem of a property in the summer of 2014. It was the last leg of our 3 week European vacation and to say it was the icing on the cake is an understatement. Our room was very comfortable for the 3 of us...even though we had lots of luggage. The bathroom spacious and clean...and the shower..an amazing experience! 

We had breakfast each morning (having paid for it in our rate) in the dining room with always, always smiling beautiful and helpful staff. The manager on duty each morning (an Egyptian gentleman) was extremely doting and anticipated our every need. The offerings on the breakfast buffet were out of this world...great variety and fresh.

The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful....even with our halting Spanish....took the time to assist in everyway possible. Both doormen we encountered...fantastic...no other way to describe them. 

Two days before we departed, I met the General Manager and chatted about our 4:30am departure...and to our surprise, upon check out (at 4:30am for our early flight), he had arranged for us to have ""take-away"" breakfast. What a gentleman.

I would definitely recommend this property to anyone traveling to Barcelona.",5,2015,07,07
19,Dissapointment,"My friend and I stayed in a twin room that has a wardrobe designed for men only. On phoning reception we were informed that all rooms at our rates were fitted out this way and it would cost a further 50 Euros a night to up grade to a bigger wardrobe. Having been around the globe to various functions with my husband, this is the first ""5 star"" hotel I've come across that cannot accommodate a day dress in a cupboard let alone a ballgown. So be warned, this is at best a business hotel that only caters for business men, business women better wear trousers too. 
The saving grace of this hotel is its location and its roof terrace. The staff at the bar and in the restaurant up there were first class.",3,2015,07,06
19,A great location and lovely staff,We could not get into the Majestic the hotel that we wanted so we were informed about Claris as the location is ideal. Ideal it is. The hotel is sparse but clean and the staff is excellent. You were treated royally from the moment you walk in. Alfonso and Oscar at the desk were just terrific and they made excellent restaurant reservations. We were impressed! I would still choose the Majestic if I would go again just for the ambience but I would not hesitate to recommend the Claris just because of the excellent care they give you! A bottle of Champagne arrived in the room as did flowers....so lovely you cant go wrong and immaculate it is !!,4,2015,07,03

Unfortunately the hotel is very noisy till around 2.30am. The rooftop bar and terrace while very pleasant when you are up there is, in the rooms below, a cacophony of dragging, banging and slamming as the guests and servers walk around and, I presume, drag crates of beer and wine across the floor. I would not recommend staying on the 6th floor.",1,2015,07,03
19,Gem In Barcelona,"Arrived in Barcelona after a 29 day cruise on Silver Sea Cloud. After a month of living at a 5 star level, we were in awe of this hotel. Small, chic and highly creative.

The hotel isn't ""central"" but is close to most places of interest with only a 6 euro taxi ride needed to La Rambla.

Cant speak highly enough of this place.
Same time next year? Absolutely!",5,2015,06,26
19,Old school,The hotel was perfectly fine although not quite the 5 star we might have expected. We were upgraded to a large room on the ground floor which was very spacious with a sauna in the bathrooms. The furniture felt a little dated but was very comfortable. A small pool and gym on the roof with a roof top bar. Very nice and attentive service. Great location right off of the best shopping streets around the passeig Gracia. ,3,2015,06,26
19,“Here I feel at home”.,"Dear Jose Fernandez,
 
You may recall, we chatted briefly and for our departure, you gave us the room adjacent to the reception to change our clothes, etc. Much appreciated.
 
My wife and I stayed in the Maisonette, room 215 from June 6th to the 12th . I must say, even though I have stayed in some of the best hotels in Europe and North America, The Claris was definitely the best. The maisonette was fabulous. The décor very impressive. Very aesthetic. Upon entering the room, my wife immediately said, “here I feel at home”. Then our compliments to your staff at the front desk. Always helpful and “patient” and special notice for your two trainees. All in all, a most memorable experience and on our next trip to your beautiful city we will certainly stay at The Claris.

Bed on third floor so so...
Yes we had a horrible experience with a bath tub which spewed sewage but other things were totally amiss...
We were moved to a mother room, came home late at night and the bed just had a sheet no duvet no blankets - had to go down and ask for blankets - only on the last night our bed was made properly
Never again!

We checked The Majestic nearby that IS a five star standard",1,2015,06,22

We arrived at the hotel Claris after having been upgraded to an incredible suite at the four seasons in Istanbul. So that was in play. Our first room was very chic, very dark (espresso walls) pretty spacious but a little noisy. Our daughter was joining us so we moved to the duplex suite which was light and airy, beautifully decorated. The downside for both rooms was small bathrooms , the first room didn't have a door for the bathroom. Breakfast was excellent and included and we had a nespresso in our room. ",5,2015,06,20
19,Different hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Very special place, ineresting mix of art and luxury. Very interesting interior design of the rooms! Although the noise in the rooms is the issue, you just hear everything, guests in the next room, people on the corridor... The staff is very professional and at high level. Just a suggestion to improve selection of food for breakfast. Location is great, next to lots of turistic attractions. Great if you want to explore city center and famous places in Barcelona!",4,2015,06,19
19,"Very Comfortable, Good Service, Nice Location","We had a really nice stay at this hotel. The staff was very attentive, and most spoke English quite well, (The concierge left something to be desired, but tried hard, and was the only aspect of the hotel that came up short.) We stayed here for five days at the front and back ends of a three week trip to Europe, and it was quite nice returning to such nice accommodations. I would not recommend paying for the top tier room (we stayed in one on the back end of our trip because we arrived a day early). The next level down was very satisfactory, and the fancy room had an upstairs living area that seemed wasteful.  The restaurant was elegant and its food creative and well-prepared. A little high end for us even with the standard 20% discount for guests, but still a great meal (with some live music that didn't blow your ears off). The views at the top are okay, and the pool refreshing, but it doesn't compare to the bar and pool scene atop the Majestic Hotel a block away, which we visited twice. The location is good - a block from the main shopping drag (Passage de Gracia), and within comfortable walking distance of two Gaudi masterpieces, the subway/metro and a lot of fun bars and restaurants. Not quite the old world feel of hotels in the Gothic quarter, but the neighborhood was cleaner and we felt very safe walking the streets at night.",4,2015,06,19
19,One of the best hotels I stayed in,"Wonderful, warm reception, beautiful interior, comfortable room, great food, great location in the city and the staff are all dedicated to your comfort and well-being. I cannot fault this hotel, I tell everyone I meet about it too.
      ",5,2015,06,18
19,Out of Place in Spain,"When I saw our room I thought I was in Tokyo not Barcelona. The motif was completely Japanese - hanging paper lanterns, open shelves, no bathroom door. There was incense burning in the hallway and a fish pond in the lobby with fake koi. If that was not enough, there was no lounge to have drinks, the pool was small and the few deck chairs were always taken. I also thought the 292.50 euros per night was rather pricey for this hotel.",3,2015,06,16
19,"Fantastic, the little extra touches really do make the differance","I stayed at the Claris Hotel in Barcelona on the 06th June for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. Myself, coming from the hospitality industry was shocked at the high level of customer service and attention to detail all the front of house team. The room was amazing, fitted with all the latest mod-cons and very stylish furniture. Upon arrival I received a personal note from the General Manager which was a lovely touch. Thank you to all the staff at Claris Hotel Barcelona, you made my holiday so special.",5,2015,06,14
19,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, great location, good size room, great pool on roof top. Serve a lovely continental and hot breakfast.  Highlight would have to be the exceptional service by all staff.  Especially Jimmy in the Breakfast restaurant who remembered your coffee order and how you liked your eggs! Would go back any day!.
      ",5,2015,06,13
19,Unique Hotel,"Excellent service, particularly from the lovely receptionist who was on duty throughout our stay. However do make sure you request a room with a proper window and natural light. Our first room, although lovely, had a small window overlooking a break wall and so was dark and gloomy. We expressed our disappointment to reception and they instantly changed our room, this room had a large floor to ceiling Sindhis, overlooking the street and lots of natural daylight, so was much much better.

",4,2015,06,11
19,Great location and comfortable rooms,"We enjoyed five nights at this well located hotel in the classic L'Eixample district of Barcelona. Major sights are within walking distance, including La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, the Cathedral, and the waterfront. The rooms are spacious and stylish, perhaps more stylish than functional. We would have appreciated more sink counter space instead of the trough sink and additional drawers would have helped, but overall the room is fine. The breakfast buffet is excellent and you can order from the kitchen as well. The rooftop pool and Terrace bar offer a refreshing end to a day of sightseeing.",5,2015,06,09
19,A very good location,"I really liked this hotel it was clean, beautiful looking and right where we wanted to be! The room was stylish and modern and housekeeping did a great job of keeping it that way. I would definitely stay here again. The only downside was the roof terrace we went to have a cocktail, which were not cheap but it does look lovely. When we ordered what we wanted (from the menu) the waiter said no and then listed all the ingredients he didn't have and walked off. He didn't ask what else we wanted or make any recommendations of what he did have available! He never came back so we left and had a delicious mojito at a great little bar on the opposite corner called Josephines. It was a shame as otherwise the whole hotel would have been totally perfect.",4,2015,06,05
19,Amazing hotel! great location,Great staff and extremely nice! The location is great! Nice gym which is difficult in Europe :) I will recommend this hotel to anyone looking to do touristic things in Barcelona. I ALSO LOVED THE VALET. They allow you to leave your car out front on weekends during the day. ,5,2015,06,01
19,Stylish and quiet,"I recently spent two nights at the Claris Hotel in Barcelona.  The hotel was well appointed with stylish art pieces throughout.  It was clean, comfortable and reasonably central.  I am not a fan of incense so found that a little overwhelming burning in the hallway on my floor.  Some noise could also be heard from the rooftop, presumably whilst it was being prepared for the warmer weather.  The fountain area in the central atrium could also do with some refurbishment.  Despite these shortfalls, the reception staff were extremely helpful and courteous and I would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,05,31
19,Stay away - This is NOT a 5 star hotel.,"A 5 star hotel anticipates needs and solves problems.  The Claris does not excel at either.  On the “anticipate needs” front, the issues are small but important: one hand towel, one bathrobe and only 2 bath towels provided – that does not anticipate my needs. The posted hours for the rooftop bar are meaningless.  The bar seems to close at will, regardless of the hours posted.  On the “solve problems” front, this place is a DISASTER.  We spent 4 days at the hotel.  On the morning of day 2 we discovered the shower did not drain and after 2 minutes in the shower we were standing in 6 inches of water.  Things happen so I stopped by the front desk and asked that the shower be fixed.  On the 2nd morning in the hotel I discovered the problem had not been fixed.  I asked the front desk to either fix the issue or change our room.  Upon returning to the hotel there was no mention of changing rooms so I assumed the problem had been fixed.  On the 3rd morning I discovered the problem had not been fixed.  Again, I told the front desk to fix it or change my room.  When I returned to the hotel in the evening there was a note to call the hotel maintenance manager.  He said he thought the issued had been solved but stated if it was not I could use the bathroom in a different hotel room.  ($300 a night for a bathroom down the hall?  That is your solution? Really?) Suffice it to say the problem was never fixed.  Had someone from the hotel bothered to turn on the shower and let it run for 2 minutes they would have seen the issue had not been solved.  4 days in a 5 star hotel and they could not manage to unclog a bathtub?  That is NOT 5 star – that is an embarrassment.  Do yourself a favor and stay at any of the other nice hotels in Barcelona.  The Claris is a mess.",2,2015,05,27
19,A honeymoon to remember,"I booked this hotel for 3 nights as the first night of a European honeymoon for myself and my new spouse. We ended up in the 2-story, loft style suite. It was amazing. Bed and bath on the first level, upstairs was a comfy couch, television, and bar area. The manager sent us an artful tray of fruit upon our arrival as congratulations. We found the staff to be very helpful and courteous our whole time there. 

There is a beautiful roof terrace with bar service, a pool, sauna, and a couple treadmills. After a long day of sightseeing, a dip in the pool and a ""vino tinto"" are just what one needs.

The location of the hotel was great if one wants to be a little north of the gothic quarter & cathedral area, but still within an easy walk to La Sagrada Familia.

If you enjoy a classy, well-appointed hotel with excellent staff, don't hesitate to stay here.",5,2015,05,27
19,A great choice,"As a solo traveller at the time it was an excellent I made to stay at the Claris for 3 nights.
The staff were warm and welcoming and always happy to help.
I had a great room -executive and it was worth it paying a bit extra.
The hotel has a roof top restaurant and bar and the food there was fabulous.
The location of the hotel is central and within easy walking distance to many of the main sights. It's also very quiet,",5,2015,05,27
19,Nic Peasley's awesome time in Barca,"Fantastic hotel with incredible rooms and an unbelievable rooftop pool and bar. Stay here as soon as you can!
The shopping was amazing and Cal Pep and Tapas 24 the food highlights.
Location was the highlight!
      ",5,2015,05,26
19,"Great Staff, Okay room","Booked the hotel because of its location, room details, and the reviews written on this website! We had a pleasant stay and really enjoyed the food offered on the roof top overlooking the city. The meals are very well prepared and provides you with a good expectation of what good food in Barcelona should taste like. I really recommend the soup! Unfortunately, we had expected better room management from the hotel. Here are the problems we encountered:

1) Noises, the rooms are not sound-proof. Since we are on the second floor, we could clearly hear what goes on at the lobby or what goes on around the corridor at around midnight which is extremely annoying.
2) Faulty lights in the bathroom that kept on flickering and quite low pressure shower.
3) Delayed room keeping, we expected highly from a five star hotel to oblige to our request to clean our room when we leave in the early morning 9AM. We came back at 3PM and the room was not yet cleaned so we informed the staff at the lobby. We came back to our room at 5:30PM again and the room is NOT CLEANED. We are very disappointed to inform the reception twice.

Overall, we would recommend for our friends to eat the food here. However, as a family, if we were to visit Barcelona again we will not choose to stay at the hotel again :(. Maybe you guys may get a better experience than us (given ratio of good reviews vs. not so good) so we wish you guys loads of luck!

Note for the hotel staff: Please fix the bathroom lights for room 118",4,2015,05,24

19,Incredible two-story suite in Barcelona.,"We stayed at Claris Hotel after much debate around location, amenities, room type, etc. we enjoyed our two-story ""loft style"" room. It was gorgeous and very clean. The service was impeccable and rooftop a favorite place for us to enjoy a night cap. The cleaning supply cabinet was right outside our room, and was very loud. Also, our room was hot and it took 2 days for staff to fix it, but these things were more nuisance than serious complaints. The only other thing we would have wished for was a closer stay to the old city, as that turned out to be our favorite. ",4,2015,05,19
19,"Great location, Great team","This Hotel is perfectly located, close to the shopping area of La Rambla and the night life.
Facilities are nice with a pool at the roof top.
Didn't experienced their restaurant but the breakfast witch is unfortunately located in the basement...They should have made it at the roof top.
Room size are Ok and clean, but the mattress is short and not very confortable.
Staff is very professionnel and nice , trying their best to resolve any problem you may face. Facing a noise problem in my room I've been relocated in another room for the night at 1pm. I was not expecting such a reactivity!.
Their internet system is very bad, always disconnecting and not available everywhere.",4,2015,05,18

Its located next to a high end shopping street and many good resturant (even though the room service was good) one more reason is that this hotel has an AMAZING STAFF that helps you, its a must.",5,2015,05,09
19,Overall.. Exceptional!,"Greetings,

Before I book for this hotel and since it's my first time in Barcelona, I was a bit hesitant. I didn't know if I was making the right choice or not. In fact, and I'm truly being honest here, I think I have made one of the best decisions ever. The hotel was exceptional! The location is amazing and it's quite near to everything. Passaige de Garcia is literally 1 min away (the main shopping district of Barcelona).

I would like to specially mention the staff of this hotel! They are absolutely amazing! Very helpful and they truly know the meaning of pleasing and satisfying their customers! I am referring to everyone working here from the bell boys to the receptionist and the concierge staff.

After saying all of this, I would highly recommend this hotel for both families and friends who are visiting Barcelona? Come here and experience this amazing hotel.",5,2015,05,09
19,Pleasant stay,"Pleasant,  classy hotel that seemed situated in a more business type area than full on touristy. Friendly staff especially the barman in the downstairs bar, who despite speaking as little English as our Spanish engaged with us in animated conversation
Check in quick and provided with glass of cava whilst being talked through hotel amenities. 
Room comfortable, although felt somewhat claustrophobic for my liking despite being able to open windows which then let in a great deal of traffic noise. But then I would imagine that this is the case anywhere in the city. Black out blinds and the most enormous comfortable bed and pillows ensured a very restful sleep. 
Housekeeping was a little inconsistent during our 3 night stay. With one day having to point out no housekeeping by 3pm and no evening 'turn down ' another. I'm not that precious that I need a choccie on my pillow and a tidy up but if it's provided on the first night One expects it for the duration of the stay. My biggest gripe is for a 5 star hotel there was no tea or coffee facilities in the room.
The roof top terrace provides some chill and respite from the hustle and bustle of this metropolis. Don't come to Barcelona looking for peace and quiet. The terrace and pool are small and you will be lucky to grab one of the half dozen loungers
We were booked to eat in the terrace restaurant but after having a light meal in the terrace bar we weren't inspired so cancelled. Drinks are pricey on the terrace particularly if you spend  an afternoon by the pool - 2 glasses sangria 20e. 
Other reviews have said this hotel is centrally located. I suppose it depends on what your priorities are. The sagrada familia is 30 mins walk one way. And the top end of las ramblas about 15 the other. If you're like me though and like the beach be prepared for about a 45 min walk to barcelonetta beach
The walk itself is pleasant enough lots to see and take in but a trek all the same
Over several days. Lots of beach bars doing very good tapas and draught beers. Unfortunately the bleach is plagued by hawkers that you have to swat away like flies that are persistently buzzing round. This is not a peaceful location. Although if you are a runner the 'promenade ' up to the W hotel is a nice 5k. Try to avoid eating and drinking on the main thorough fairs  as like with all major cities you'll pay stupid prices. As always trip advisor was invaluable for finding excellent restaurants.

Check in was smooth and we were greeted warmly.The staff are very helpful and friendly, they sent us a special greeting for our anniversary. The rooms are basic but clean and spacious compared to hotels in europe and the bath tub makes a difference. The breakfast is decent and room service is great. I definitely recommend this hotel.

19,Fantastic Hotel.,"we stayed here recently on a boys weekend in the lively city of Barcelona . I have been to Barcelona many times and stayed all over the city, the Claris is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at , the location, decor, food etc were all top notch. We had a duplex room which had an upstairs area, perfect for lounging and relaxing or entertaining. The rooftop bar was wonderful as was the rooftop pool, the hotel itself was a work of art. The views from the rooftop were breathtaking. It's not cheap by any sense but if you can treat yourself you won't regret staying here. Hello and thank you to all the lovely staff in particular the guys upstairs at the rooftop bar/restaurant . 
I can't wait to stay here again.",5,2015,04,28
19,Nothing special,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights but there wasn't anything special. Breakfast was decent, room was worn down, WiFi didn't work in the room and service wasn't better than average. In room amenities were decent and room was noisy because of the traffic outside.

Only thing we found during our stay to be better than average was its location. It was easy to access everywhere from the hotel. Anyway when you book this hotel, don't expect anything special.",3,2015,04,26

19,"Great Location, excellent service, but not a 5 stars hotel","Stayed again recently at Claris. I would not consider the hotel a 5 star L property. Again I have been impressed by the excellent service. The staff tried to accommodate the best they could all the requests of their guests.  Rooms vary in size. Some of them can be noisy and some are in need of refurbishment.  A good restaurant is located on the top floor. The hotel also boasts a very tiny fitness club and an outdoor pool also on the top floor. The lobby area is sparingly furnished and not extremely inviting. Equally the bar on the ground floor is quite small and dark. However, the bartender was great. What is extremely disappointing and should be fixed is the internet connection. This is extremely slow and at times does not work at all. The hotel offers some kind of premium internet service which I end up buying. Considering internet comes extremely cheap and fast I found ridiculous to have to pay for a premium internet service that finally was just a little bit faster than the free one.",4,2015,04,19

19,Stylish Hotel in Primo Shopping District,"A very stylish, moderately sized hotel is located on a quiet street just a block away from a major shopping district and an easy walk from Las Ramblas as well as many of the Gaudi buildings.

The hotel itself is interesting.  It is in an older building but it has been completely done over inside to a high tech/ultra modern style which was impressive.  It features a really comfortable rooftop lounge/bar/swimming pool area which was great in early  April but would be crucial in the summer.

The staff were all very helpful and pleasant and the breakfasts were excellent....if a bit pricy.  The only complaint was that for my taste our room was a bit small......a long and narrow plan with a sitting area at one end, bathroom in the middle and then the bedroom.  The bathroom was all very high tech but the sink area wasn't the most functional though it looked fabulous.

The location would be very good for most visitors unless they were wanting to be close to the beach during the summer.  For shoppers and sight seers this is close enough to the action but also a little peaceful.",4,2015,04,08

The staff were always friendly and very helpful, especially when asking about bus tours, restaurants etc around the area. The rooftop bar was open and the service was excellent. It was in the perfect location, far enough away from all the noise and about a 15 minute walk tops to Las Ramblas. We had room service one night which was very quick and tasted delicious! The rooms were nice, always clean and the bed is so comfy! To top it off, they provided us with a complimentary bottle of Cava and birthday card for my boyfriend which was lovely!

Good selection of continental breakfast as well as cooked items to order. The only negative about this hotel was the bar both on the terrace and on ground level.

A free ticket for two, worth about Euro 30 to visit the Egyptian museum nearby. Buffet breakfast regularly topped up, plus your special order  from the chef were great. Staff were friendly, polite and will go the extra mile to make your stay a memorable one. Alex, Roberta and Judith, deserve a special mention, at Reception will go beyond their call of duty to help you resolve issues that are not even of the Hotel making. Staff will recommend and direct you to places of interest and dining outside of the hotel if you wish. No pressure. Staff get to know you very quickly and make you feel as part of the family.

We thought the hotel staff were excellent and were alway pleased to help.

We ate in the roof terrace restaurant on one night, which was excellent.

Breakfast was good on two out of three mornings, but on the Saturday of our stay it seemed a little disorganised with selection not being replenished and our eggs over cooked, petty I know but it is supposed to be 5*.

Things to note bed was a little too firm for us. And we had some people being noisy in the corridor one night.",4,2015,03,04
19,5* Stay in a 5* Hotel,"Staff were exceptional, made our stay extra special. Thank you so much. The rooms were lovely! The bathroom had a jacuzzi and sauna included which was wonderful.

19,A lovely surprise!,"My boyfriend booked this as a surprise get away for us, and he definitely done well! 
A lovely boutique hotel, in a great location, with easy access to everything. When we arrived they let us check in early, and upgraded our room! Which was a nice extra touch.
The staff are very helpful and attentive, although they confused us slightly with directions and where to eat. But this isn't a major issue. 
However when it can to checking out, they tried to charge us for breakfast and items from the mini bar that we didn't have, a genuine mistake I'm sure. But all was rectified.

19,Hotel Claris,"What a great experience we had staying at the Hotel Claris.  The  hotel was very comfortable and the staff was so helpful.  Alex Hernandez the rooms division manger was so great to us.  Our flight home was cancelled and not only did Alex assist us in our new travel plans, he helped us out with extending our room for another night as well as a very late check out.  The restaurant on the roof was so delicious.  Not easy to find in a hotel restaurant. We had breakfast included which was very good. Highly recommend doing this if you have the option. The location is also great.  Very easy to get to most of the sights that you need to see in Barcelona.  We were able to walk almost everywhere. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona!!!",5,2015,02,25
19,Gracious and friendly staff in a high end hotel.,"My wife and I are in Spain for ten days. We started and ended our trip at this hotel for a total of five nights. We had a duplex the first stay which was great in terms of space. On our return we didn't like our room and after one bad night of sleep - lots of street noise - we were given a two from spacious suite. Just amazing! Breakfasts were very good. Service was friendly and helpful. My wife asked for gluten free bread and was given enough variety and quantity for two people. That's service. 

Go and enjoy the friendly and professional staff!",5,2015,02,21

19,The Best Valu for your Money!,"I don't think you can get a better room on a premium location for the price we paid than the Claris Hotel. The location is just a block from the main shopping high end street of Gracia and just a short 15 min walk to the Sagrada Familia.
Access to Metro stations is only a 5 min walk,

Loved the idea of the Egyptian art, and enjoyed my room and the great staff.

My one complaint would be that the wifi is pretty shakey and didn't work most of the time I was at the hotel.",5,2015,02,18
19,Lovely Stay,"Very comfortable, central location. The room was not ready when I arrived. I had to wait an hour but they upgraded me and gave me a free drink. Lots of information about city in room, great area, not too many tourists.

19,Highly Recommended,"Visited this hotel for Valentine weekend.. Lovely clean modern hotel with a twist of Egyptian Art. Staff were so helpful and friendly in an appropriate way, nothing was too much trouble. This was demonstrated when my husband had his wallet stolen while eating in a nearby restaurant. The manager Ricardo Vargas was extremely helpful arranging for us to stay longer in the room, loaning us money for a taxi to take us to an English speaking police station at the other end of the city. 
The hotel is situated in an excellent spot just one block from the Passieg de Garcia and in good walking distance to the main attractions. we would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona and have no hesitation in recommending this excellent hotel for a fabulous stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,02,16
19,Modern  Hotel,"WE spent three nights in the Hotel Claris . Its a modern hotel centrally located in Barcelona.
The rooms were clean and spacious and the hotel has a great rooftop bar and restaurant.
The breakfast was simple but good. Just one tip  on the rooms , be careful when they turn down the room because they put the blackout shutters on . One morning we woke up at lunchtime because of this , great if you ant to sleep in , not so good if you want to get an early start.",5,2015,02,13
19,Fantastic Boutique Hotel!,"I just spent two nights at the Hotel Claris in Barcelona and loved every moment!  All guests are welcomed with a glass of champagne which is always a great way to start.  The Reception staff were very polite and professional.... got me checked into my room quickly.  

The first evening I received a lovely turndown including a red rose.  I would like to commend the gentleman who checked me in and out (Feb 13) at 7am, he was very genuine and great asset to the hotel.  The rooftop terrace is a great place for the sunset and a glass of wine.  I would certainly recommend this hotel to any guests looking for great service in a convenient location for exploring the city.",5,2015,02,13
19,visiting Barcelone with a friend,"hotel Claris is situated in the city center of Barcelone near shops, restaurants and cafes.  The service in the hotel was excellent and the room was clean and pleasant. On the table we could find a fresh rose and a welcome card. the personal was always helpful and you felt really welcome to the hotel. I have been twice in the Claris hotel and it is possible that I will book a room in the hotel Claris in the future. there was a good restaurant from Argentina near the hotel Claris. If you want to stay in the luxorious hotel, you can choose the Claris hotel. I can recommend this hotel to my friends who want to visit Barcelona.

19,Highly Recommend,Would highly recommend this hotel. Great location in the modern part of the city centre yet 5 minutes walk from la rambla and el gotic. It is situated next to 2 main metro stations which allows you to see the whole of Barcelona. Room was gorgeous and customer service was outstanding with breakfast times ending at 10:30 midweek/11am at the weekend so you get that extra little lie in. MUST GO!,5,2015,02,10
19,Two days in Barcelona ,"My husband and I stayed at the Claris hotel for two amazing nights. First of all location is great. It is about 20 min walk to all major sites. It's around the corner from the subway which is super easy to navigate (and cheaper than catching cabs). Great coffee/ breakfast spots immediately across the street. Major shopping is also one street over.
The hotel itself is beautiful, great friendly staff that is always happy to help. Rooms are spacious, nicely designed with pretty comfortable bed and some serious blackout shades. Rooftop is spacious with nice views and a cute little bar/restaurant.
",5,2015,02,08
19,"Not just the best of a class, but a class by itself","Talking about the Claris simply as a hotel would misslead to consider it simply as another great hotel in Barcelona (and there are many). But Claris is something more than just that. Is the right place for those that:
1st.- Can affort paying for it
2nd.- Understand luxury as the sense of real uniqueness
3rd.- Appreciate the value of a different concept: a modern hotel where you can sleep, or have a drink looking a piece of art 2000 years old

This is a place to get feelings more than just staying",5,2015,02,05
19,Ruined my birthday,"I booked a Duplex room at this so called 5 Star hotel, to celebrate my 40th birthday  To be woken up on the morning of my birthday by the loudest building work you could imagine was not ideal, having called Reception it finally stopped an hour later.  The works continued throughout the day, literally reverberating around the room - when we went looking it was actually the room that backed on to ours so was obviously going to impact on our stay.  
The rooms on Expedia are also listed as soundproof - another reason for booking the rooms, but this was so untrue, you could hear everyone walking up and down the hallways.
Our city view as mentioned on Expedia was actually a grey brick wall - not what I had paid for.
I have since emailed the hotel to express my concern about the standard of my stay and have been told that they had been forced to carry out works in the room due to an emergency and that I should have complained more and the would have moved me.
Room 201 is also next door to a service lift so constant noise throughout the night with staff using the lifts with loud trolleys for cleaning, etc.
Totally ruined my stay, I am not one to complain, but having called Reception I would have thought if they knew it was going to continue throughout the day they should have suggested moving me.
Total waste of money, please be advised that you need to complain a lot to get anything done at this hotel.",1,2015,02,02
19,Zen yet attentive all at the same time,"Have to say that the money allegedly poured into the renovation of this hotel was money well spent. The Claris Hotel did not miss a thing, including gorgeous accomodations, ambience, quality and best of all service. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a lovely young woman who said that she was our ""liason"" of sorts and could take care of anything for us. Although we didn't need her services per se, she was clearly paying attention on the periphery which was nice to know just in case. She treated us to a glass of Cava while waiting only a few minutes for the room to be ready, which I found generous and appreciated since many hotels just tell you to sit there and wait. The Hotel is very modern (a la Barcelona style) and very asian in decor and atmosphere. There is a nice aroma of incense wafting through the hallways. The place is very clean and quiet yet busy all at the same time.... hard to describe. There were 3 of us and my daughter had a section of the room all to herself with her own tv, which I guess would have been a separate sitting room if we were just two. The bathroom is very modern but I have to say that the shower is a bit tricky. The water comes from above and the stall is a bit small so it is hard to get out of the line of fire (or water). The staff was very friendly and helpful and took time and effort to find us the best restaurants and the best adventures for our time there. The location of the Hotel may be its best feature, being right off the Passeig Gracia and right at the Gaudi houses. There were lots of nice shops and restaurants in walking distance so it is very convenient. The rooftop bar/restaurant and pool area is spectacular. We visited in January so not right for swimming but definitely a nice spot for sunning which was evidence when we had lunch at the rooftop restaurant. You could tell that the other patrons were the ""who's who"" coming to lunch there and not necessarily hotel guests. The food was excellent. There is a young hip vibe going on at this hotel which was appreciated by this middle aged woman which fits in perfectly with the overall vibe in Barcelona so I would highly recommend the Claris when visiting the City",5,2015,01,31
19,Just Fantastic !!!!,"Just got back from an unbelievable weekend in Barcelona and had the pleasure of staying at  Claris Hotel, from the very first minute at check in to the last and very regrettable minute at check out we were met with smily and friendly as well as very helpful staff , from the doorman to the manager we had no complaints whatsoever.
The rooms ,standard, were very comfortable and very well decorated and very clean , the bathroom was also spotless with a lovely shower and white company toiletries , robes and slippers were also provided.
The hotel was also very clean, modern and airy.
This is a must stay hotel if you are thinking of visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,01,26
19,Wonderful!,What a gem of a hotel! We received a warm welcome with champagne. Our luggage was delivered to our rooms which were excellent. We were on the 5th floor (502) and overlooking the street but no noise problems. Good selection of toiletries too. Breakfast was more than adequate. Roof terrace looked amazing but we didn't spend too much time there. Lobby bar was intimate with good selection of drinks and food. What really made this hotel special was the staff. Their attention to detail and level of customer service were superb from the receptionists to the cleaning staff to the doorman. Brilliant!!!!,5,2015,01,26
19,Claris Hotel - Lovely Hotel,"As soon as we arrived at the hotel, I knew we'd made the right choice. We are a young couple (22 and 24) and we wanted something a little more upmarket whilst staying in Barcelona. The location is brilliant for everything; airport, shopping, Gaudi sight-seeing, Camp Nou. We paid 23 Euros to get to the hotel during the day (coming back was 43 Euros so make sure you keep some to return with!) We arrived to the lovely hotel to a staff member opening the taxi door for us. He then took our baggage to the reception to check-in. The receptionist was very pleasant and suggested a couple of things to do whilst here. His English was brilliant and he was very professional. After being checked in (went very smoothly even though we booked on LastMinute.com which has some iffy reviews), we were taken to the room. The lift has clear walls so close your eyes if you don't like heights! We were placed next to the lift (I think this was because we used LastMinute in truth). Our room was absolutely lovely. Exactly how the photograph depicted and it was bigger than I was expecting (we went for the Executive Room). Lovely pillows, lovely bedding, lovely toiletries which were replaced every time room service was requested (which they charged for which I wasn't impressed with). 
 
The first night that we stayed, we realised that the soundproof description was hugely deceptive. We could hear the lift moving every single time someone used it. We could hear people entering and leaving their rooms. We could hear the doorbell of other rooms. We could hear what people were saying to each other. In fact I could hear my boyfriend sighing when I was having a bath, that's how thin the walls were. Being a lady and using the toilet was an issue, as I had to make a real effort to make sure he couldn't hear me use it. That was frustrating and took away from the stay a little. But the safe worked well and the wardrobe area was great. There weren't many clothes hangers which was annoying because I brought a going-out dress for every night and I also had my day clothes  and so did my boyfriend so I had to fold mine and iron later. We used the iron held in reception and they politely brought it up. We used the food room service whilst here too. I wasn't feeling fantastic so we ordered from the menu. We had the chicken and the pizza, with chips on the side as a nice treat. It was such a lovely service. They brought the food in on a tray and there was even miniature salt and pepper pots. 
 
We didn't use the swimming pool or the bar or anything, but we did pop upstairs to see what the restaurant was like. Caviar and the like was being served, but there were no tables left so we went somewhere else instead. It looked lovely from the outside. There is a rooftop terrace which was really nice too. I bet it would be gorgeous on a summer night, because it was even romantic in the middle of December! 
 
I would 100% recommend this hotel. It has a lovely, classy feel and I really enjoyed staying there.",4,2015,01,16
19,Great Value Hotel in central Barcelona,"This place was booked for me by my work so didnt pay much attention at the time.

19,Just 'OK',"Was expecting lots from this hotel stay, but came away slightly disappointed tbh. Room was a 2 storey suite, which initially was impressive - but soon became a chore & waste of space. Beds were just ok, room layout was slighty weird and furniture was showing signs of wear & tear in places.  Staff very friendly. Dont think i'd stay here again.",4,2015,01,02
19,Never again,"Let's start with the positives. The staff are amazingly nice, friendly and helpful (with one exception) and the room, a junior suite in our case, was a decent size and nicely decorated. 
BUT: the room smelled really unpleasantly, apparently of some sort of incense (at least that's what we were told, to me it smelled more like mouldy rooms do). Because of that smell we had to keep the window opened over night, which on a busy main road isn't exactly sleep inducing.
The first night, when we wanted to use the bathroom quite late in the evening there was no hot water, so at 11.30pm we had to call someone to sort that out (which they did but obviously we had to saty up longer than we'd intended). I also noticed a couple of dark brown hairs in the bath (as well as on the hairdryer), which clearly couldn't belong to either of us. On top of that there was no soap in the bathroom so we had to actually ask the cleaning lady the next morning to get some soap. Now in a 5 star hotel you would have thought that soap should be provided without explicitly having to ask for it.
In the afternoon we wanted to have a drink in the bar, but all they had to offer was the terrace bar on the roof. It was about 10 degree C outside, not the kind of weather where the only available option to have a drink should be sitting outside. To their credit the following day in the afternoon they did open the downstairs bars after we requested it (it was announced that it would be open all day). The day after that we decided to have tapas in the said bar and I asked for some bread with it, which they promptly served (as I mentioned before, the staff were great) but it was so hard it was hardly edible.
To top it all, on our second day one of the three lifts wasn't working, which wouldn't be a big deal if we hadn't then got stuck in one of the other lifts. Now, when 2 out of 3 lifts are so unreliable I wonder how often they are maintained. Not very reassuring as far as I'm concerned.
Not to mention the WIFI, which only worked half the time.
In addition, I had contacted the hotel for them to arrange for a private trainer Pilates session, which they did... or so they said in the email they sent me prior to my arrival. However, when I got to the hotel, nobody seemed to ever have heard of such a thing. So I went to the gym where the session had supposedly been booked and again, noone knew of anything. So they clearly hadn't made the booking at all. 
To make up for all the inconveniences we had to face during our stay there, upon check-out, we did get the breakfast for our 3-day stay for free.
Unfortunately, this still doesn't make Claris a 5-star hotel. I will surely not go back there and even less recommend the place to anyone.",2,2015,01,01
19,Just OK (but beware of lifts),"A reasonable hotel but really no more than that. I asked for a quiet room but was give one n the second floor on a busy road. Cannot recommend this hotel for light sleepers. The duplex suite was small but sufficient. I suppose it is a matter of taste but three different kinds of wallpaper, an open bathroom, a bed with glass in the back, an open wardrobe and a scary staircase were a bit much for me. Loads of design but I would have been happy with a more regular lay out and decoration. Got stuck twice in the lift. So not recommended if you are somewhat claustrofobic. The breakfast was good but overpriced. Cafe Emma down the road offers similar quality at half te price. Should be a four star really.",3,2014,12,31
19,Underrated - this hotel is spectacular,"Some hotels have the five star ranking because they meet some kind of criteria checklist. 

Other hotels have a five star ranking because they are truly five star properties.

The Hotel Claris is a modern hotel with a rich atmosphere, excellent service, and differentiated rooms. The junior suite we are in is superbly appointed - furniture, lighting, wall decorations (including an 18th century oil portrait on one wall which is clearly authentic) all blend together to make this one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in. 

We were allowed to see other rooms, and were given a superb explanation of the property and its history. 

The location, also, is superb. Close enough to Las Ramblas to be there on foot in a couple of minutes, far away enough to be quiet at night.

Expect being taken care of thoroughly at check-in!",5,2014,12,29
19,"Beautiful hotel, staff very attentive.","We had a 3night stay at the Claris hotel.  Two couples our son and his new wife with us.
I mentioned to the staff at reception it was our sons honeymoon.  They sent up a bottle of Cava to both our rooms.  During the stay we were sent a second bottle each and a red rose in a vase.
Rooms were very tastefully decorated.  Double bed with sofa and large flat screen tv.  Floor 6.  Had to keep windows shut as on a busy road.  But we were very comfortable.
Large bathroom, with whit bathrobes and towels.

19,Interesting hotel in good location,"Stayed for one night in a junior suite. The room was nice but despite being classified as a suite it was not very big. The bathroom was spacious and well equipped, there was even a jacuzzi. My room was facing the courtyard, it was very quiet, could even leave the window open overnight. The front desk service is very good. The staff are knowledgable and helpful. I did not use the rooftop restaurant but the breakfast room and the tapas bar. The breakfast is excellent, the tapas not outstanding. The location of the hotel could not be better, with the main shopping areas only a short walk away, and a number of Barcelona's top restaurants are in walking distance of the hotel. I can recommend this hotel to fellow travellers. It is also good value for money!",4,2014,12,16
19,Ullis,"Did just came home from 3 nights on Claris. The hotel was very nice, location perfect, we had a duplex room and it was perfect. Clean, big and beautiful. The staff nice, the doorman were lovely. 

BUT our roome were on second floor and beside the street and it was a nightmare. It was impossible to sleep because off the trafficnoise. It felt like we were sleeping next to the highway with open windows. We are having loud traffic near our home today so we are used to noise but this was so loud. The second night did we sleep with earpluggs so we could sleep. To bad beacuse we liked the hotel very much but will not stay there again because of the trafficnoise.",4,2014,12,11
19,"Good, but some ""design faults""","First and foremost, the Claris is a beautifully-appointed property located in the best possible location in downtown Barcelona. Surrounded by dozens of excellent eateries and walking distance to Las Ramblas. However, there are some design faults in this hotel - particularly in the rooms. Poorly designed, the spaces are tight and ""unfriendly"" for the guests i.e. No dressing mirror, tiny bath with awful shower control taps. The public spaces are very inviting but...there is a lack of some quiet corners in the lobby. My other complaint was with the concierge who, although she tried to be helpful, was not at all knowledgable - even on basic queries. Finally, the restaurant was SO expensive compared to other restaurants embracing this location - even with a 20%special discount provided for guests. All this may sound too negative, but seriously, i would expect more from a classic 5 star deluxe (their wording) hotel in lovely Barcelona.",4,2014,12,08
19,Beautiful Barcelona and Hotel Claris,"Just returned from a trip to Barcelona with my wife and stayed in one of the nicest hotels I have ever been in. The staff were faultless and so friendly they made our stay truly exceptional. The doorman was a real joy to talk to and he always had a ready smile and a helping hand should we require assistance with shopping,taxis, directions etc. We were also upgraded to a duplex suite which was fantastic, crisp white linen on the giant bed and with an enormous bathroom en suite on the upper floor. Exceptional decoration throughout the hotel. Everything a five star hotel should be and more. We have always stayed on the passeig de la gracia before now but this place is only one block away from the Passeig and pound for pound blows the socks off anything we have stayed in there.We will definitely be back on our next trip. Fantastic experience all round.",5,2014,12,04
19,It could be so much more,"I really, really wanted to give this hotel more of a rating but my experience with them has just left me sad and unable to!
There are so many pluses going for it that poor staff communication let it down from the start.
My husband and I visited this hotel for our 7th wedding anniversary as I have always wanted to go to Barcelona.  Pre arrival I spoke with the hotel directly about arranging a little surprise to be in our room for my hubby on the Saturday of our stay.  I was happy to have paid for a bottle of bubbly and some other bits to be in the room but after a couple of emails with the hotel they very kindly offered to leave a house bottle of bubbly, some chocolates and personal message from me to the hubby in the room for me........ to cut a long story short, I planed our main day in the city around being back in time to enjoy this pre dinner only to get back to our room and to find nothing, nada, zilch there..... This of course was a major let down, all staff at reception seemed not to have a clue what I was on about when I approached them and even when I showed them the email correspondence they just shrugged!!!! Gee thanks, great customer service.
So for obvious reasons I am not able to say this hotel is wonderful as they pretty much made a  mess of something that should have been great and an email sent after my arrival back to the UK has gone completely ignored!!!!!!
I will be honest and say that it's location is great, we walked everywhere and anywhere over the weekend and was only ever a short taxi ride away from most things you really want to see while in Barcelona...
The hotel interior is something, quirky with lots of wonderful bits and bobs to eye over.
The pool area and rooftop terrace were nice but it wasn't heated so there was no way I was getting in it this time of year!!!
The hotels rooftop restaurant is amazing and the tasting menu was lovely.
So sadly despite all its pros and all that it has got going for it the lack of customer service is something that has put me off this place and any future stays.",2,2014,12,03

It's within walking distance from most of the main attractions in the city and there are plenty shops and street side coffee bars to keep you busy.",5,2014,11,26
19,Excellent hotel !!!,"Excellent service, great rooms. Best location, hardly used transportation, walked every where.
The staff is amazing, helpful, kind always with a smile.
One of the best hotel I have been in.
Very reasonable price.

19,"Superb, stylish hotel","Can honestly say that this is possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed in. We've  just returned from a short weekend  stay and I can't recommend this hotel enough. Its stylish, contemporary and the staff are excellent. It has a great location and the large panoramic windows in our room give a spectacular view of the streets below. The rooftop pool area is terrific.  A really great hotel.",5,2014,11,24
19,"1st review, 2nd time here","We stayed here two years ago and came back for three nights this year before leaving on a cruise. I was surprised by some of the negative comments the other reviewers posted about the general manager Jose Luis Fernandez.  We were in the lobby a few hours after check in and he introduced himself to us and was the most gracious and friendly person anyone could ask for. Even throughout our stay when ever he saw us he would come over and say hello and ask if everything was fine. Some of the other reviews also complained about having to wait for a room when they arrived early from an over night flight-hey people if the hotel was full the night before and no has checked out of their rooms where do you think the hotel is going to put you? Not only do the previous guest have to check out but then the room has to be cleaned and serviced for you. We also arrived early from an overnight flight and our suite was not available at 10:45am when we got there.  However about 20 minutes later one of the front desk clerks came over to us and said a guest had just checked out and they would get the room available as soon as possible for us, shortly there after the suite was ready.
    As most reviews state the location of the hotel is great, walking distance to a lot of sights, shops and restaurants. The staff could not have been nicer, they arranged airport pick up, a car and driver to take us to Montsrrat as well as dinner reservations.  Our suite was on the 3rd floor and faced the intersection and there was never a problem with street noise. There was turn done service every evening with chocolates on the pillows and slippers placed by the bed. The bathroom was to die for, gorgeous tile and marble with a huge jetted tube and very large walk in rain shower. The breakfast was very european, by that I mean cheeses, meats, fruit, yogurts, pastries.  You could order eggs and pancakes cooked to order with their version of bacon if you choose.  We had cocktails every evening at the upstairs bar and restaurant and ate dinner there one night.  Dinner and service were excellent, food was delicious and presented beautifully.  Just remember you are in Barcelona and restaurants don't generally open until at least 8 or maybe even 9pm.   As guest of the hotel you also get free admission to the Egyptian Museum that houses the hotel owners private collection of artifacts. We will be returning to Barcelona next September and will certainly be staying here again. I would and will recommend this hotel for all it has to offer.",5,2014,11,23
19,Gracious Service and Modern Style,"From the moment we arrived at the Claris, we were made to feel at home.  We were greeted warmly at the door, although it was 10AM we were given an available room, and while our bags were being transported to our room, the concierge, Diana Pereira, helped us plan our two day stay.  She listened to us, gave us great advice, clear directions and ordered advanced tickets.  With her help, we were off to enjoy a wonderful day by 11AM.  The hotel's location is perfect:  2 Gaudi houses 5 minutes away, 15 minutes to the cathedral (or 20 if you amble), 15 minutes down the Passeig de Gracia to the Rambla.  If you are weary at the days end, there is no need to wander far for diner.  Across the street is Josephine serving tapas, or salad or fine main dishes with good wine.
The décor was modern, stylish and comfortable.  There was a desk in the lobby with a computer which I used to print my boarding passes.  The breakfast served in the cheerful room on the lower level was excellent and included fresh made items and a generous buffet.  Our room, 314, afforded a bright view of the street.  It was not large but quite comfortable.  The décor was modern, the 2 twin beds which were pushed together were quite firm but comfortable.  The only problem with this room was that the sleeping area was a step up from the sitting and bathroom area: during the day, no problem; at night the step became invisible in the darkened room.  We slept with a light on.  You might want to avoid this design when booking.
Would we stay at the Claris again - absolutely!  We can't wait.",5,2014,11,20
19,The perfect weekend,"Great hotel and location.we were upgraded to a junior suite which was simply stunning.big bed that was so comfortable u didn't want to get out of it.
Fantastic walk in rain fall shower and a separate jacuzzi.air conditioning and a large led TV topped things of.",5,2014,11,19
19,Comfortable Hotel in a Great Location,"My girlfriend surprised me to a weekend away in Barcelona and we stayed at the Claris. First impressions were great, it had a classy feel and very friendly staff which was nice. We arrived early and the room wasn't ready so we stored our bags and went to explore.
The location is spot on in terms of being central, the hotel is 2 blocks away from the main street for shopping with lots of Tapas restaurants etc. The nearest Metro was a 5min walk from the hotel so we could get around to the main spots with ease.
We also used Taxis a lot so if you need an idea of costs a taxi straight from the airport to the hotel cost 30EUR, a taxi from the hotel to the Neu Camp cost 8EUR and a taxi to pretty much any attraction is no more than 10EUR. All taxis are yellow and black so you can't miss them.
When we arrived back at the hotel we were pleased to find our bags waiting in the room and were shown around by a member of staff.
The room was fairly small but classy and clean and comfortable so I would have no hesitation in returning. Breakfast was excellent, you have a buffet along with a menu to order hot food etc.
The roof top bar came in use as our flight home was late so we had a few sangrias before heading to the airport.
Only negative is that the doors to the room are fairly thin so you can hear others in the hallway which did wake us one night.
Overall I would highly recommend.",4,2014,11,18
19,"Modern, well situated, very comfortable, wonderful staff",Very close to most of the Gaudi sites.   Room was very modern and comfortable.   Staff was friendly and very helpful.   Trip was a combination of business and leisure.   Will stay here again next time in BCN.,5,2014,11,15
19,Best accommodations to date.,"I stayed in a duplex at the Claris  and it was absolutely beautiful. I have stay in hotels all over the US( east and west coast ) and these acvomadations were to date the best ever. .
Staff  were very accommodating. When I go back to Barcelona 
I will stay here again and again!!'

19,Barcelona at the best...,"...we had a wonderful stay in a wonderful hotel, best weekend since a long time...   :-)  

We can recommend this hotel to guests of every class, it's wonderful...  if you will have problems any art the staff there will help you very useful...

19,Classic SLH property,"Ten days at this place was hardly enough. Ideally situated and surrounded by shops, bars and restaurants, the staff were universally helpfull. The room overlooked the street intersection but there was no noise. Roof-top bar and restaurant a bit pricey but very slick.",4,2014,11,08
19,Perfectly located in the heart of Barcelona,"Hotel is around 5 min walk from Metro's & Shopping district (including all the designer shops). Room was large & beautiful, Staff helpful, breakfast plentiful with lots of choice. Hotel tastefully decorated throughout lovely rooftop bar.
the walk down Les Rambles is great beautiful Barcelona, Bus tour a must to see this beautiful city.
Buy a metro travel ticket definitely a cheaper way of touring this beautiful city.
Visited Barcelona’s FC - Camp Nou wow, even if you are not a football fan,plenty to see and do there, massive 3 floor souvenirs store, prepare to queue. This is not a short visit, therefore allow enough time,e-mail me for details of tickets ect.,as not allowed to advertise here. Beware of pick pockets they are very quick & skilled,locals remind you all of the time which is nice of them. Do think it was expensive for what it gave you - but the main thing for me was clean,good service with friendly staff and doormen + perfect walking distance - thumbs up - Thank you",4,2014,11,06
19,Beautiful hotel,The rooftop bar and pool area is amazing and the food excellent. The service is also great. Somewhat pricey but worth the price and the experience. Barcelona in itself is stunning and the food market is a must see,4,2014,11,04
19,Delightful Boutique Hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 3-week trip in Europe. It was perfect for us, walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The concierge made our reservations so that we could skip the lines for La Sagrada Familia. The doorman gave us tips about places to eat where the locals eat. Our room was comfortable. This is an ultra modern hotel set within a Colonial exterior. We were here at the end of July and thought the service was excellent.",5,2014,11,03
19,This is not a 5Stars GL hotel,"Selected as a venue for a workshop, it was very disappointing when we noticed meeting rooms are not comfortable, they are noisy, the audiovisual equipment small, and lights were not good. Price too high for the quality received.",2,2014,11,02
19,"Beautiful hotel, terrible experience","I am currently a guest at Hotel Claris. I am beginning day 4 of a 5 day stay. It has, to date, been the worst hotel experience in my extensive work and leisure travel. A brief summary to date:

Check-in. We received room keys and went to the 7th floor. Upon inserting our key and opening the door, we were startled to find a half naked British chap in our room. He was equally as surprised to see us. We returned downstairs, received our properly keyed cards. No big deal.

Later that evening, my wife decided to take a shower. The shower head literally fell off. Upon leaving for the evening, we stopped downstairs to notify the front desk and said we would be gone for several hours. Upon returning around 1am, no one had even been to our room. Annoyed, we returned downstairs where they had no idea what we were talking about. They sent a maintenance man upstairs who messed around with it for a moment and said it would be good for now, they would fix it tomorrow. Our showers the next day involved an inch of water on the floor due to the broken shower head.

Before dinner that evening we received a phone call from the front desk, insisting they move us to a better room. The upgrade was, in fact, very nice. Until the morning...

At 9am we were awoken to what can only be described as a bedside jackhammer. It was so loud, my wife and I jumped out of bed, took 2 min showers, and left to avoid the noise as quickly as possible as plaster fell from the ceiling.

We returned to the front desk to ask about the construction.  1) Yes, they had moved us DIRECTLY BELOW major construction 2) She could not promise it would be finished that day. 3) We could move to another room (we had already moved once so we were not interested in that) 4) She would speak to her manager, and leave a note for us upon our return.

After a beautiful day and dinner, we returned to find NO NOTE from the manager, just disinterested lobby staff. On day 4 of our trip, instead of relaxing in our room, we are being forced out by exceptionally loud banging pipes and drilling. I have not been given any contact or access to the manager. This is a ""5 star hotel"" with incredibly poor service and the worst vacation experience I have ever had.",1,2014,10,31
19,Perfect for a luxury minibreak,Was a treat. Exceptional service and rooftop haven in great location in Barcelona. Took parents for a long weekend to enjoy the city and it was ideal to have a sumptuous base for chilling out and relaxing with easy access to all sights and great eaterias. ,5,2014,10,28
19,Hotel Claris - Excellent,"This is a lovely brand new hotel in a great area of Barcelona. Everything here is of top quality - the rooms are lovely, the view from the rooftop is beautiful, the food is very good. At first we had a problem with a room, right away we were helped by Marc Schmid a senior manager with the hotel. Instantly the problem went away. No questions, no problems, just top quality professionalism that you could not fault. Our four night stay was excellent, largely thanks to Marc. We WILL be back for sure.",5,2014,10,26
19,Lovely hotel with pretty roof top pool,"Good location close to attractions. The pool and the roof top bar were a nice way to relax after a day of sight seeing. Breakfast was a lovely buffet with fresh fruit, cheese, pastries as well as a choice of hot cooked breakfast.",4,2014,10,25
19,Barcelona stay,"Very good hotel and centrally located. Breakfast, service was great. Close to all Barcelona attractions and good restaurants, shops.Would prefer bigger room but overall great stay! I would recommend it to anyone. 
      ",5,2014,10,22
19,Cannot see 5 star service anywhere,Disappointed with the service and facility. Requested room change but been ignored by the receptionist 3 times within 2hours. Borrow a kettle as mom caught a cold and need some hot water. Unfortunately was given a broken one. Breakfast is poor. Don't understand why this hotel is 5star as i simply did not get to have any positive experience here. Ruined holiday in Barcelona ,2,2014,10,22
19,A Nice Hotel,"Excellent location - a very short walk to great shopping , La Rambla , the Gothic Quarter , the seaside , etc., etc.It has a roof top bar which is very pleasant but with not much of a view . Excellent staff for the most part . A very contemporary designed hotel with the smell of incense in the hallways .We did have lunch one day , in the roof top restaurant . It wasn't bad BUT there are far too many great restaurants close by to waste an evening in a hotel restaurant , which is overly priced and has small portions . The hotel is not necessarily a great one for the business traveler as the rooms do not have work stations or desks . It does offer free Wi Fi .",4,2014,10,21
19,Lovely hotel but not a great stay for us.,"My husband and I stayed at hotel Claris just a few weeks ago, we read reviews and decided it was just what we had in mind.
We arrived by their transfer service and was pleased when we arrived as it is indeed a lovely hotel.
We were met by very friendly staff and were taken to out suite.... This is where the problems began.
On entering out suite we were over powered by the smell of stale smoke, even the member of staff grimaced at the smell, however we asked to move and were granted a new suite with no arguments.
 The new did not have the views last one had but we were happy to stay put.
The room was beautiful decorated and the bed was amazingly comfortable.... UNTILL We were woken up the next morning (8.30am) by continues drilling and banging from the room above, we decided to go out for the day under the assumption the noise would of stopped by our return, sadly this did not happen. We returned around 4pm for a little sleep before our evening out. That was not going to happen as the noise continued till about 6pm. This constant noise happened for the whole of our stay, we did speak to the front desk on several occasions, they were very polite and agreed it was noisy and explained they had an issue with a flume/pipe in the kitchen. We understood issues do arise however it was affecting our holiday.  Even though we asked time & time again for them to stop the noise just for the few hours we were in our room nothing happened then On the last day the manager came to our room to apologise & offer a complementary meal, we could not take this as we had booked at another Restaurant so instead he offered a discount on our room which we excepted. We never received that discount and was In fact charged €50 a week later which we have no reason why. We were very disappointed with the experience we had and sadly would most likely never use the hotel again",2,2014,10,19
19,Great choice for Barcelona!,"Hotel is modern.Attentive staff.On arrival was given an upgrade from superior room to junior suite which was of excellent size and quiet (overlooking inner stairwell).We ate in the Terrace restaurant on the 7th floor(very good food,smallish portions) and I used a card I had been given for a complimentary glass of cava.Normally wouldn't drink cava but this was Catalan and rather good.
All members of staff were cheerful and aiming to please.Very nice doorman.

Top tip

Don't make the same mistake as me.Woke up at 4.30am light streaming through window.There is a switch to the left of the window that you have to press quite hard.It activates the electric shutters!

Would definitely use this hotel in Barcelona.Nice and central.",5,2014,10,19
19,Long Weekend Trip,I had a very pleasant stay at Claris Hotel on my visit to Barcelona. Ideal location to walk everywhere. Nice roof pool and bar/restaurant. Hotel staff were very helpful but not on your face. I loved the city and hotel and would return there next time when in Barcelona. The hotel was easy access by train from the airport.,5,2014,10,18
19,Definitely not a 5* hotel,"We stayed four nights at the Claris and whilst in a perfect location it is NOT a 5+ hotel in any way. Rooms not ready on arrival and no chance of checking in early in fact not until well after 2. chased out of rooms at end of stay even with late flight departure. Bath wouldn't fill due to plug not fitting properly, no rubbish bin in room - tiny one in bathroom- warm glasses of water at breakfast, no fresh towels by pool and dirty ones not removed, dirty glasses not cleared, Wi-Fi very poor. Sadly this standard might run across the Derby group as we had similar trials and tribulations at their Lake District Hotel. Not to be recommended!",3,2014,10,14
19,"Great, peaceful, location and great service","We stayed four nights and found this location to be ideal, walking to the Gaudi church and house.  We also did a culinary tour, which was in the adjacent village (now part of Barcelona) that was two blocks away.  It is a bit of a walk to the harbor, the the old town is an easy walk and the taxis were relatively inexpensive and plentiful.  The rooftop bar and Egyptian art and museum as part of the hotel amenities are a nice touch and interesting.  Barcelona is an exciting and interesting city and while I have been here many times on business, this was still an eye opener.",4,2014,10,12
19,Not our problem,"We stayed at the Claris GL for 6 nights. You expect when you walk into a ""5 star"" hotel to have a feeling of welcome - oh no not at the Claris or with the Manager Mr Ricardo. He sticks to his no entry to rooms til 2pm, a most unflexible hotel and we saw the same situation daily in the lobby of the hotel. Everyday around 10-11-midday you see the new arrivals and its the same story. They let no one in the rooms til 2pm and you here the same dolcit tones of the reception staff repeat Mr Ricardo's rehearsed speech of the hotel rules - 'no rooms are ready til 2pm, you can go to the museum for couple of hours, sorry not our problem'. The lobby adorned with the young and old some on overnight flights such as us, exhausted and miserable and camped out in a 5 star lobby like a airport terminal with a delayed flight. Its not funny and completely ridiculous situation. Mr Ricardo has a fully rehearsed speech which if you try to reason with him he talks right over you. There are rooms available - we had a 10am flight out of Barcelona along with many others so we were out of our room by 8am last Saturday we are sure no one got that room before 2pm if they arrived early. We moaned about his rule and we were ushered to the coffee shop and given a Duplex Room one hour earlier 1pm near the construction/refurb of other rooms on the 2nd floor - we paid for Junior Room and requested Quiet plus stated our time of arrival. You moan in the Claris about their procedure you get the opposite of what you have requested and they don't let you forget it. This is not a 5 Star Hotel by any means. We usually have breakfast etc and use all facilities of a hotel - not this time we specifically spent our Euro's outside to local restaurants and outlets who were far more appreciative of our custom.  Spa treatments - there is none they call in from outside to your room? Gym no more than 2 people in the gym its tiny. The exception on the Ricardo rule is the housekeeping and the Conceirge Girl(s) very pleasant and helpful but Team Ricardo not a clue on how to deal with residents.",1,2014,10,12
19,Over rated hotel,"We stayed at the Claris for 4 nights. It is in an excellent location. However we were very disappointed with the room. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel-there was no full length mirror or mirror of any kind in the room itself. the only one was in the bathroom! The hotel claims that it offers ""free wi-fi"". this is a con because the offer is for ""basic wi-fi for 3 days"". They offer an upgrade at an extra charge. 
The breakfast is very good. The Terrace restaurant is hugely over-priced but offers a good view.
The staff are great and very welcoming.",4,2014,10,08
19,Nice stay and great location ,Hotel is very nice. Lots to see as they have an art collection in hotel. Hotel has several fountains throughout. Nice rooftop bar with pool. Have a drink and lounge. Had dinner at the restaurant and it was average. Our room was very roomy and decorated nicely. Would definitely stay here again!!,5,2014,10,05
19,Great hotel in perfect location,This hotel was a very pleasant experience. Decoration is very good with some art pieces that the owner collects. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are different to any other other room. Mine for example had a mezzanine. It is centrally located very close to everything. I would certainly return.,5,2014,10,01
19,"Perfect location, helpful staff","I stayed with a friend for 3 nights in September via SLH. First impressions were good and the hotel is very well known by all taxi drivers and is close to the metro. It is also within a 5min walk from the main shopping district, Gaudi houses and some lovely bars/restaurants. We were given free tickets to the local Egyptian museum as guests of the hotel, and it is well worth keeping an hour free to visit this (closed on Sundays).

Check-in was relatively hassle-free and although our room wasn't ready on arrival, we used these 15mins or so to organise tickets for the Sagrada Familia via the very pleasant concierge. We were upgraded to a junior suite via SLH without having to request this and although the reception staff were somewhat distracted at times and attempted to charge us again for our pre-paid room, this was quickly rectified and they were extremely helpful and pleased to help throughout the remainder of our stay.

Our room (a junior suite on level 5) was beautiful, spacious and very quiet due to it facing the inner courtyard. This made for a limited view and it was somewhat dark, however we were pleased with this as we only intended to use the room to sleep and relax. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom products provided were of good quality.

The rooftop terrace was great for a drink/snack and the views over Barcelona were fabulous. The terrace pool was at all times too busy for us to use in the afternoon due to a lack of sun-loungers and limited space around the small pool, but there were generally plenty of chairs/tables to enjoy a drink at.

Breakfast was extremely varied and the hot options were very good and freshly cooked to order. The staff really made an effort to remember your order, food and table preferences each day which was a nice touch.

A special word of thanks should go out to the doorman who seemed to be there at almost any time of day or night but despite this was always extremely professional, friendly and willing to flag down a cab and direct them in Catalan to where we wanted to go.

Overall, a great, high end hotel in a perfect location in central Barcelona; I would return.",5,2014,09,28
19,Nice Stay and Great Location,"We stayed at the Claris Hotel for 2 nights following a cruise. Very nice hotel and a good size room, we had the executive room. After a long day of touring around the city, the rooftop bar provides a great place to unwind before heading out to one of Barcelona's many great restaurants. Front desk staff was always very helpful and the conceirge provided some great information on places to go. All the staff members we encountered always had a smile and a nice hello. 

The location is great just one block from Passeig de Gràcia and two of Gaudi's masterful creations. A short walk to La Ramblas. Plenty of great restaurants all within walking distance as well. There were a lot of stores on Passeig de Gràcia but nothing you can't find in most major cities these days. 

We would definitely consider Claris Hotel on our next visit to Barcelona.",4,2014,09,26
19,"Very pricey, terrible internet, but very nice rooms","Basically 3 things sum up my feelings about Hotel Claris:
-The rooms were extremely expensive
-The internet was almost unusably slow
-The rooms were very nice and the hotel was beautiful

If money isn't a factor and you don't care about internet, then you'll find no drawbacks.
      ",3,2014,09,25
19,We would definitely return,"We spent 5 nights recently in Claris Hotel based upon the recommendation of a friend. We were certainly happy we did. The hotel has a very pleasant environment and the staff work hard to make sure your stay is pleasant. A hotel stay is rarely ""perfect' in a lll respects, but for us the mark of a fine hotel is how the staff respond when something falls short. In the case of Claris Hotel, in particular Ricardo (front desk manager) and Jimmy (from the breakfast restaurant) went above and beyond in their efforts to make our stay what we hoped for. A very comfortable room (I think each is different) and a very comfortable king size bed. I found the pool area a little cramped and not particularly inviting and the lobby bar (despite a very pleasant barman) missed the mark. Great location!",4,2014,09,22
19,"Good hotel, great location.","This hotel is in a great location and has really cute rooms. We stayed in the duplex room and the furniture, design, ambience-everything about it- was so truly great. The rooftop is also really nice. The lobby was a bit outdated and didn't fit the whole vibe of the hotel, but overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. There was some sort of a conference or a large group when we we were there, so that was a bit loud and annoying. They would wake me  up every morning with their loud voices. They also hosted an event on the rooftop one night where they took a portion of the rooftop. It wasn't a complete turn off as much as it was annoying noise wise and a total killer if you're looking for a romantic little getaway with a loved one. We used the hotel as a base to explore the city, so luckily it didn't make much of a difference to our stay.",4,2014,09,21
19,Another great stay!!,"Just arrived back from barcelona and another great stay at the Claris Hotel. This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel and it still does not disappoint 
The staff are always very accommodating and friendly especially the ones at breakfast. Will defiantly be going back again!",5,2014,09,19
19,Great stay at Claris,"Great hotel for exploring Barcelona. From the doorman at the front when we arrived to the staff in the restaurant at breakfast they were all great. Stayed in a two storey loft room at the front of the hotel. Room was a little noisy the first night due to the neighbouring restaurant across the street having a loud party. Other than that, room was great. Clean, comfortable and roomy. Breakfast was well served and plentiful. Recommendations for dinner were spot on. Great place to stay.",5,2014,09,18
19,Claris great - Barcelona great location - Room 607 definitely not!,"2nd Sept - 9th Sept - I pre-paid my hotel via B.A. and on arrival asked for a quiet room and was told I could have the choice of two available rooms which actually turned out to be only one room 607 - the same applied the next day.  Room 607 again.  One can get used to the steady hum of the traffic but the intermittent sharp banging and scraping of chairs from the seventh floor bar directly above was most annoying.  Previous reviews have noted the same from rooms in this area and it pays to check with trip advisor beforehand.  It is shameful that the hotel has done nothing to address this issue such as rubber floor matting or strong rubber shoes at the bottom of the seats - it is good to note however that the general manager responds to all reviews and I will be looking for a refund of the five star price paid for what can only be described as a two star room location - otherwise great staff particularly the breakfast helpers, doormen always ready for a chat and a laugh.  Barcelona a great city and I will return to continue my research into my family tree which goes back as far as two Spanish Armada Galleons that sank off the coast of the NE of Scotland to one John Rickard - a very long story!",4,2014,09,18
19,the birthday present for my wife,"Great location, very helpful staff, breakfast staff extremely courteous and alert. The receptionist were very well versed on their responsibilities, and the housekeeping staff did a great job. We stayed at 5 different hotels during our vacation and the Claris left a very good impression.",5,2014,09,18
19,Great stay at the Claris,"Stayed here for 3 days during our stay in Barcelona.  Beautiful hotel, great room, great helpful staff, very nice breakfast.  We were upgraded to a junior suite because it was our anniversary.  They also sent champagne up to the room-both very nice touches.  The room was beautiful, exceptional bathroom amenities.  ",5,2014,09,17
19,Average Experience,"The Hotel Claris was nice. The room was clean and furnished nicely. 
We had a suite, with living room and nice sized bathroom. 
The location was okay, in the business district. 
I wished we stayed closer to the Barri Gotic or Raval neighborhoods. 
The staff was accomodating, and made great restaurant reccomendations.
The Rootop area was a disaster. 
We had very poor service for drinks, we sat for over an hour after one drink and never got asked if we wanted another.
The pool area is so small. Lounge chairs are few and  when I asked if someone could bring another over, I was ignored.
Overall it wasn't a bad experience, but I would not recommend this hotel to friends.",3,2014,09,16
19,Happy Staff means happy guests,"The Claris is a wonderful property for many reasons, not the least its accommodating and eager to please staff.  They definitely understand what pride of working in hospitality means and it shows.  The beautiful public spaces and comfortable rooms are but the cream of the cake.  My wife loved the breakfast buffet and the made to order eggs as well as the ambience. The rooftop terrace offers the perfect atmosphere to wind down and take in the sophisticated view that Barcelona offers.  The DJ played grat atmosphere music that blended with the scene and beautiful people there gathered for a fun night. My only concern was the weak internet in the room.  Fix that and you have a perfect option for any discerning guests visiting your vibrant city. My new home address when in Barcelona: The Claris, of course.",5,2014,09,15
19,Good hotel,"Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel room was a large suite on two floors. It was good to have a separate sleeping and living area. There were two showers and toilets. 
Pool was very nice and the roof top bar. Only negative was that the room was noisy. You could hear other toilets flushing and people walking outside the room.",4,2014,09,12
19,"Very nice, but small rooms by US standards and showers flood bathroom","This hotel was very nice with modern, clean rooms. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly. Location is a few blocks from Ramblas but only 1 block from upscale shopping street. 
The rooms are efficiently designed, but rooms are small by typical US standards for high-end hotels. We had 2 rooms for our family of 5. 
Noise from crying baby in neighboring room could be overhead, and some street noise of beeping cars, etc but overall is quiet. 
Rooftop terrace is relaxing and lovely. 
Hotel arranged airport transportation, but driver was an old curmudgeon who complained about everything.
Ok, the shower is our biggest complaint. There is a small partial glass screen that only half encloses the shower. No matter how careful you are, the water gets out of the shower and floods the bathroom floor. There is a floor drain at the far end but we ended up using an extra towel to wipe it up and with so few towels, that was irritating. This is a very poor design, and hotel management could fix this flaw easily and still keep modern design.",4,2014,09,10
19,"Great Hotel, A+ location","Spent 5 nights at Hotel Claris in the upscale L'Exiample neighborhood a few blocks from La Pedrera.  The level of cleanliness for this size of a hotel was second to none...immaculate!  The location was great.  Nearby many things but a block off the busy Passeig de Gracia.  The concierge was extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations which were some of our best meals on the trip.  The rooftop was very nice but the service up there was lacking.  We were only having cocktails (not a meal) but it took an extremely long time to get drink service and the servers never returned to see if we were ready for another so we called the night short both times we were up there. Although wifi was included, signal was intermittent at times and it became frustrating to continually have to rejoin each time you log on. Overall a great room, amazing rain shower and A+ location.  Staff was friendly and helpful and highly recommend.  Amazing value.",4,2014,09,10
19,Lovely hotel in Barcelona-helpful staff and great location,"My wife and I enjoyed this Hotel well located in Barcelona with
helpful staff. The room was cold and comfortable during the hot early September
Days- the shower takes some getting used to.
They have thoughtful high qualty amenities-soaps, shampoos, skin moisturizers
and they had lovely welcoming gifts- wine, chocolates, bottled water that added to the enjoyment. The breakfast is also satsifying if not elborate.
This is not an ultra-luxe hotel but it is, like Avis, trying harder and it is well worth 
booking as it represents good value for  a high quality roomy and comfortabe hotel.KMeloff Toronto",4,2014,09,10
19,Interesting stay but wouldn't do it again,"Great location and very nice staff. Rooms are unique to the point of form over function. We had a sauna in our room and would have traded that out in a sec for a shower. No room to store luggage. End tables and lamps design were just useless. Bedroom window opened to the atrium and we were kept up half the night because of the music and conversation from the nightclub on the roof. 

Always check your bill for internet charges as you should be able to connect 3 to 5 devices in one charge. ",3,2014,09,10
19,A very special Hotel in a Beautiful city,"I chose the Claris Hotel for a special trip to celebrate my 25th Wedding Anniversary.
From the moment we arrived they made us feel special and most welcome.
The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.
They have certainly earned their 5 star rating and I could not fault anything.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone who was looking for a special place to stay.",5,2014,09,10
19,"fantastic, would love to return","My husband booked this hotel for 2 nights to celebrate my 40th birthday.  What a wonderful surprise.

The hotel is very central, only a few minutes walk to all the hustle and bustle.  On arrival we were given a complimentary upgrade to an executive room. My husband had been in regular contact with the hotel prior to the trip and arranged for a bottle of cava to be waiting for our arrival. Nicely chilled, and with delicious strawberries dipped in chocolate, this was very welcome after our journey. 

The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in, wish I could have brought it home with me. Fab shower with several power settings to choose from.  

From check in to check out everything ran smoothly.  Lovely staff from reception to the doorman who made sure we had transport arranged for our return to the airport.  I  would definitely recommend this hotel, and I hope to stay again.",5,2014,09,08
19,"great hotel, great location","Very nice room, reasonable size by euro standards, huge bathroom by euro standards.  Very clean updated, comfortable room.
 Location is quiet but 1 block from very nice restaurants and shopping and easy walk to pl catalunya and gothic shopping district.  subway 1 block away.
Very nice roof bar area w/ pool.",5,2014,09,04
19,Great Hotel,"We found the Claris to be very clean and modern.  It was centrally located to walk almost everywhere.  If we wanted a cab, there was no waiting.  The roof top pool and restaraunt were a great place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  The staff were very attentive to our needs and I would stay there again.",5,2014,09,01
19,Great hotel in a perfect location and with excellent staff giving a 5 star service.,I stayed here for 4 nights and can't fault it. Roof terrace is a bonus if you want a quiet cocktail (or two) and a dip in the pool. The location is perfect for Las Ramblas. First time in Barcelona and without doubt takes 1st place in my favourite European cities. Recommend taking the Tourist bus on your first day to help short list what you want to go back and spend more time visiting. Food was excellent but stay away from the tourist traps (ask the staff at the Claris where to eat - they gave great recommendations). ,5,2014,09,01
19,Fantastic stay,"We stayed here for 4 nights and from start to end we had a fantastic experience. The location is perfect, you can walk to the ramblas in 5 minutes but the top of the street is just as nice. Our room was lovely on the 6th floor with a street view which was great to look out onto. The staff were very helpful and always polite, the doorman needs a special mention a big smile to start your day is always lovely. I planned a surprise on arrival for my partner and the hotel manager (Alex) was so helpful in arranging this for me and all went perfect. The roof top bar and pool are lovely and everywhere very clean and bright. A true 5* experience, would recommend and thank you to all at the Claris who made our stay memorable.",5,2014,08,28
19,Faultless,Great hotel with an awesome location !! Excellent rooms and helpful staff. Highly recommended. The rooms are modern the pool is great for a city hotel. I would have no hesitation in staying here again if we visited. We had 3 kids under 10 with us and the staff were very helpful and we were made to feel very welcome.,5,2014,08,26
19,Great Experience,Loved this hotel. The roof top pool was beautiful and the rooms very nice. The concierge was not very knowledgable about local restaurants but there were lots to find In the neighbourhood just walking around. It's an easy walk to many attractions and to the Old Town. We didn't eat there. Breakfast was not included and it was pricey. We stuck to the local bakeries and coffee shops for breakfast. Would definitely go back.,5,2014,08,25
19,Enjoyed our stay,"We stayed at the Claris for almost a week and found it to be very well located for things we wanted to do.  Could walk to the Gaudi sites and there were lots of restaurant options in the neighborhood.  The rooms were very well laid out and spacious. The closets were a little on the small side for two people staying a long time. The staff were very personable and very helpful with restaurant suggestions and the like.  However, they lacked a dedicated concierge who would normally be much better informed on special events. Also they seemed to lack a mechanism for charging tickets to your bill, which is possible at at least one other comparable hotel we stayed in in Spain.",5,2014,08,24
19,Wonderful hotel with attentive staff,"Diligent, attentive and experienced staff. The hotel was accommodating to the teenagers and they loved the rooftop pool. Late afternoon/early evening drinks and appetizers while watching the kids swim before dinner was a great way to finish the day. Very comfortable beds, strong AC and ultra modern bathrooms. They had an above average breakfast to start the day. Art presentation throughout hotel was impressive. All members of the family would go back in a heart beat. I cannot find any negatives.",5,2014,08,23
19,Amazing!,"This hotel has top of the line everything .  If you ever have an opportunity to stay at Claris there will absolutely be nothing that will disappoint you.  Even seems like the staff knows what you need before you need it. Inexpensive for what you get. I have to nominate this hotel as Barcelonas Best and the only hotel I 'll  ever stay in Barcelona. The rooftop pool area  was very well  decorated and always with a fabulous atmosphere. Even the other guests were 5star. 
The location couldn't be better. 
 Thank you Claris Team for providing such an spectacular stay. See you next time for",5,2014,08,23
19,Fabulous stay in Barcelona,"Although my husband and I had been to Barcelona on a cruise stops (overnight) we had never had a chance to stay in the city and were thrilled when we were able to do so at the Claris Hotel for three nights before our cruise. 

This location in the city can’t be beat as it’s within walking distance of so many places that should be on the MUST SEE list like the Sagredo Familia, La Pedrera, Casa Batllo, the Ramblas, and more.  This medium size hotel has all the amenities of a large property such as multiple restaurants, rooftop pool and bar, gym and the like but has the service level of a boutique property. Everyone at the Claris was concerned that we had the best time in Barcelona.
Our room was a two room unit with small rooms but it was nicely appointed.  I loved the bathroom with the bubble tub, separate shower and toilet and double trough sink.
We didn’t need a concierge desk, as the front desk staff was all very knowledgeable and assisted with great restaurant recommendations and reservations. The breakfast in the lowest level had a lovely spread and nice service. 

The Claris also has a complimentary Smart Car! We took it out for two hours and such a good time exploring the city. What a wonderful perk. 

We dined one night at their wonderful rooftop restaurant La Terraza and chose the prix fix menu, which was great. We enjoyed the pool size drink service and meeting other guests there. 

I highly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to return.",5,2014,08,23
19,Modern art but not total comfort.,"Lovely hotel with lots of very nice amenities. Staff was above average, knowledgable and attentive.
The decor is very modern with almost a sterile feel in the rooms. 
TV and Internet reception is very spotty and not reliable.
Central location is ideal for sightseeing and transportation.",4,2014,08,21
19,Claris Hotel is a lovely place to stay!,"Claris Hotel is a beautiful property with spacious rooms.  The staff is excellent, the rooftop restaurant has a great view.  We only had drinks and snacks there but it was all good!  It is a good location for many of the must see attractions in Barcelona.  I highly recomment it!",5,2014,08,20
19,Excellent,"Friendly staff, assiduous service, lovely roof terrace, comfortable split level rooms, not far from the old town and easy walk from Sagrada Familia and other sites, this hotel offers a very pleasant respite from the heat and bustle of summertime Barcelona. Highly recommended. ",5,2014,08,17
19,Great location!,We have been to Barcelona many times but wanted to try a hotel that was not $400/night. Hotel Claris was perfect. Location is one block away from Passeig de Garcia. The hotel was very nice although our room was small. Yet it was comfortable and clean. Staff helpful and bar on rooftop was so nice. Definitely recommend it for location and value. ,4,2014,08,15
19,Fab hotel great area,"Fantastic hotel very central, breakfast very good no complaints would use again would recommend first visit to Barcelona and it won't be my last people very nice and polite only complaint no free water in room but that is my only complaint and I can live with that well worth a visit",5,2014,08,15
19,Location at a price.,"We pre-booked on a Spanish site to get the best possible rate beforehand (€177.80 on Atrapalo.com) but found it to be a bit of a rip off as we we're expecting a much nicer and bigger room for this money- we had a good nights sleep and was it quiet in the night (on the upside) but the room was really small and very clumsy and extremely tight layout in the bathroom- no tea or coffee facilities with a nice coffee table to enjoy the room more, no courtesy welcome drink and overall for a 5 star hotel we found the value really average, especially as this is not a cheap hotel by any standards. Breakfast was OK but served in basement- open buffet but choice a bit limited especially on cereals.  
Art in the hotel is nice as is the rooftop terrasse but prices are very high - better eat outside.",3,2014,08,13
19,"Not what I expected , but location is very good","The advantage is that the location - just a few steps from de Passeig de Gracia - is very good , but that is about it. The hotel is more a 3 star , average place. Rooms are small , and very noisy (a lot of noice from the street). Breakfast is very good , but expensive. Service in restaurant is very good , in the lobby and reception pretty average. There are certainly better places to stay in Barcelona for the price you had to pay.",3,2014,08,12
19,Reasonably Good Hotel in a Great Location,"We stayed at the Claris for four nights at the end of July.  It is in a convenient location that is walking distance to many restaurants and sights.  Our room was a two level suite with an upstairs bedroom and downstairs sitting area.  There were two full bathrooms as well as closets on both levels.  The shower in the upstairs bathroom didn't drain well, and there was an inch of water on the floor of the shower after I used it.  The room was large but felt a bit claustrophobic due to the window overlooking an outside wall.

There is a rooftop pool and restaurant which offer a lovely view of the surrounding streets.  The pool is small, and there is limited seating.  I was disappointed that no umbrellas were provided near the pool to provide some shade.  You could order drinks and food, but the service was very slow.

The front desk staff was a mixed bag.  One woman was very helpful getting us tickets to a few places, but other staff members weren't overly friendly.

When we checked in the front desk person told us to lock up our valuables in the safe before going out.  We did that most of the time.  However, one of my somewhat valuable possessions went missing when we were in Barcelona, and it may have been taken from the room.",3,2014,08,10
19,Not what it's cracked up to be!,"We chose this hotel because of the reviews and also because of the description on their website.  It looked magnificent, built onto an old palace with Egyptian artifacts in every room, very central in Barcelona and with what looked like an olympic-sized swimming pool on the roof.  Imagine how disappointed we were when we got there.  Not one of their rooms has a balcony or even a window that opens onto the street.  Instead, the windows are all facing a very boring central ventilation and service shaft, decorated with the odd giant metal leaf (clearly art Jim, but not as we know it!) Our room was very dark and dingy, the bathroom was black and gold and not in the slightest bit attractive or interesting.  We were given 10 pillows with snow white bed linen which looked like cotton but was most definitely a polyester mix.  When you pay the prices we payed you would expect better than that.  The fittings were old and could do with refurbishing.  The tap in the toilet on the roof terrace almost came away in your hand.  In this modern day and age you would expect state of the art facilities for charging phones and other electrical equipment.  How much would it cost them to put some kind of travel sockets on the wall or even a USB socket if you think that thieves might steal the travel plug.  The place seemed clean enough but there again, how could we tell given the dark room we stayed in.  I got stuck in the lift briefly so that probably needs fixing too.  To cap it all, many of the staff members did not speak either Spanish or English properly.  When our electric blind broke I mentioned it to the guy on reception and he was very dismissive, telling me I had obviously pressed the wrong button.  They didn't come and fix it.

One last but very important thing to mention is the fact that they do not provide a kettle or any kind of tea and coffee making facilities.  Considering it's a 4 or 5 star hotel, that is pretty poor show. Oh yes, we did get a chocolate on the pillow every night but that doesn't help if you are gasping for a cup of tea.  

The food was exorbitantly priced and even a cup of coffee was silly money and not very nice.  Breakfast I believe was 20 Euros each so we didn't even try that and nor, by the look of things, did many of the guests. 

In conclusion, I have stayed in many much more modest establishments which knock spots off the Claris. I don't really recommend it unless someone else is paying for it as a place to stay on a business trip.",3,2014,08,05
19,Good location,"Our room was the junior suite and it was fabulous! From the moment we arrived, we were pampered and service was sooo good. Reception staff were all very accommodating and helpful. One can only say a big thank you to housekeeping staff too! We were given a tour of the terraza restaurant and immediately booked a dinner for the night.

The food was great! Alas the service was a big disappointment. Staff seemed to be in a constant rush-rush mode and there was just no one to assist you in selecting your food. I am used to being asked by restaurant staff if the food was good, or if I needed anything else. On this occasion, they just served the food and the next time staff went to our table was when we wanted our bill. It was such a let down after all the welcome we were given.

I would still recommend the hotel to my friends but not the restaurant.",4,2014,08,03
19,Excellent Service,"Hotel claris was recommended by a friend due to the excellent location. We spent 5 nights at and felt like it was our home away from home!! Front desk, front door and concierge were stellar!! Our room had a staircase in it leading to the living room-fun!! Modern bathrooms had great sense of style. Roof top bar is the perfect place to end each evening.  Looking forward to returning!",5,2014,08,02
19,Luxury hotel in an excellent location.,"Stayed at the hotel for a week. 

Our room was an ""executive suite"" on the 6th floor. It had a great marble bathroom, little seating area and comfortable beds.

Location is excellent! One block from passeig de gracia and full of restaurants and little coffee shops around. 

The pool upstairs is great for summer and there is a bar as well.

I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!!",5,2014,08,02
19,Amazing hotel!,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location in Barcelona! The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms beautiful and comfortable and the location perfect for walking to many attractions. From the fragrance in the lobby to the decor throughout the hotel, this place is luxurious! Worth every penny!",5,2014,07,31
19,Super comfortable stay in the heart of Barcelona.,"Stayed twice at Claris. First time I've chosen it for its enviable location, second time I 've chosen it for the nice memories it gave us during our first stay. Modern, super comfortable and unexpectetly quiet hotel in busy Exiample district. Friendly and prompt staff, stylish rooms, lovely terrace restaurant with good cocktails. Hotel is in 1 minute walk from La Pedrera.",5,2014,07,30
19,Oasis of a modern hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"I chose this hotel mostly based on where it was located. It was very close to most attractions- within walking distance to Sagadra Familia, Las Ramblas and the Gothic area. It is a very modern hotel, filled with artwork. The staff was helpful. When we arrived (early from a cruise), one room wasn't available, so we went into the other room and asked for a lunch recommendation. The front desk was excellent with suggestions, getting taxis, etc... There is a nice pool area upstairs, not very big, but nice to get out of the heat and a bar up there as well. The workout area is outside, which I wouldn't want to brave in July heat. We stayed in room 315. It was nice and quiet. Breakfast was available for 23 Euro per person, which seems way to expensive for me. It is luckily near many restaurants and shopping areas. My only other complaint is that they charge for ice, which one doesn't normally encounter in the states.",4,2014,07,29
19,Beautiful and friendly staff,"We stayed in a Junior suite at the hotel for 4 nights - not long enough - loved it.  The room had everything you needed plus more.  The staff were the friendliest we had come across during our 6 week vacation.  Location is central, less than 5 minute walk to the main shops.",5,2014,07,29
19,5*Claris hotel vs 2* Claris B&B,"We booked a 4 night stay in what we thought was this hotel through Trivago and then directed to Priceline in April 2014. We arrived at 1 am to uh hotel as our flight was late. Upon entering the hotel, weighed down with luggage, I lost my footing and twisted my ankle on the step inside the door. First impression was of the receptionist glaring at me- never asked if I was ok or needed help despite watching what happened. Fast forwarding on I produced our booking details only to be told that we were not booked in to the hotel- she seemed indifferent. Clearly I was confused. I recognised the hotel interrupt to be the same as that advertised when I booked, the distinct modern art was identical. She made a phone call to where she said our booking was for- a 2* B&B across the road. We had been conned but I didn't know who by- being tired from the flight and with a sore ankle I was conscious of my ability to think straight. I asked the receptionist to hold a room for us while we checked the 2* Claris B&B across the road. We did and it resembled nothing like the photos and description under which we booked. The lady we spoke to there, dressed in jeans and tshirt who was acting as receptionist kindly agreed to cancel our booking there and we returned to the 5* Claris hotel across the road. She was kind enough to tell us that this occurs frequently and that it is used as a way to fill empty bedrooms in the more expensive 5* hotel. I did not enjoy our 1 night stay there as a result, I feel we were conned into paying double the price and as it occurs so frequently I am in the process of following up this complaint in a formal manner with the local police and regularities in Barcelona. We found a beautiful hotel the next morning by recommendation from another first at the hotel that we were very happy with.",1,2014,07,26
19,Fabulous Experience,"The Grand Claris hotel is fantastic in every sense... My husband and I booked a weekend trip to Barcelona before our wedding and decided to stay at the Grand Claris.
From the moment we checked in, the staff were exceptional. The rooms were well decorated and exactly as described. The cleanliness, the staff, the rooms, the location make it a fantastic hotel to stay in.
Highly recommended to all and I will most certainly be going back.",5,2014,07,25
19,Very classy hotel,"Staying at the Claris is a luxurious experience.  It has an atmosphere of class, cleanliness and excellent service. Excellent central location, convenient and inexpensive valet parking, attractively presented appetising breakfast -  highly recommended.",5,2014,07,25
19,"Great Location, Rooms, and Service","This hotel was recommended by my travel agent for my boyfriend and I to stay while visiting Barcelona. The hotel is lovely, with exceptional staff that accommodated all my needs (dinner reservations etc.). We stayed in the Junior Suite which was basically the size of a standard apartment. It was cozy and warm, which made it very comfortable for the both of us. Further the location of this hotel is perfect. Walking distance from the La Sagrada Familia (10-15min), Casa Batllo, La Pedrera (both 5min), and Las Ramblas/Gothic Qtr. (20-25min). Room service was always fast and food was delicious. The free breakfast buffet was also a plus and outstanding service. The pool is small but nice because its private and not overcrowded. Overall we had a great time staying at Hotel Claris. It truly is the best bang for your buck hotel while traveling to Barcelona. It is luxury, clean, has great service, and centrally located.",4,2014,07,23
19,"Amazing staff, brilliant location and stunning hotel.",I took my fiancé to this hotel for his 30th birthday. The hotel was absolutely amazing and done everything they could to make our stay special right from the booking of the hotel to checking out. Really recommend this hotel to anyone looking at staying in Barcelona.  Xx,5,2014,07,23
19,Really beautiful hotel,"We stayed at Hotel Claris for 4 nights in July. It is a lovely hotel and all of the staff do the upmost to make you feel welcome. This hotel is situated in a convenient location which is walking distance to some of the shops and restaurants. The rooms are comfortable, modern and very clean, and the rooftop terrace is great for a few drinks in the evening.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to others & will stay here again the next time I visit Barcelona...If I could give one drawback, it is that breakfast is quite pricey.",4,2014,07,20
19,Top Quality,"From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were looked after.
Rooms cleaned whenever we stepped out of the hotel, not to mention courtesy calls to see if everything was ok...Excellent roof terrace.
Made our trip a memorable one, will definitely return.",4,2014,07,17
19,Stay at Hotel Claris,"The property was very quaint, clean and situated within walking distance to great shopping and restaraunts.  The staff was friendly, responsive and professional.  The rooftop bar and swimming pool is a very nice feature.  I would definately return.",5,2014,07,15
19,Just lovely..need I say more?,"Stayed here on a family vacation three years ago. The pool on top of the hotel is lovely and the view is just beautiful. You can sit up top and eat, drink, and relax. The rooms are nicely appointed and clean. We enjoyed it so much that we returned this summer and stayed here again!
The staff at the hotel is so welcoming and eager to help. They have a small fitness center with a bike and treadmill as well as a sauna. The doormen (there are two that I met) are delightful...somewhat shy but will engage in lovely conversation if you show an interest in them.
The breakfast is good (fresh squeezed OJ). They are quick to serve and eager to please. Additionally, the hotel is well located for easy access to some great shopping!",5,2014,07,12
19,Claris Barcelona,"This hotel met every one of our needs. It was clean, absolutely comfortable,  and within walking distance to all the major sites. The staff were all very friendly and exceptionally helpful, which really enhanced our stay in Barcelona. Can't recommend it more highly!

19,Claris Barcelona,"I chose the Claris on after reading comments on Trip Advisor.  Boy did I make a great choice!  The hotel was spotless, the location was fabulous, everyone was beyond helpful and sent us to wonderful restaurants.  If you are going to Barcelona you can not go wrong staying here.  I will say breakfast was very pricy but there were cafés all around.  This hotel would be fine for any type of traveler.",5,2014,07,09
19,Fine business hotel,"Enjoyed the clean and quiet hotel. It had a lovely rooftop bar and the rooms were well equipped. It is in a nice, but quiet neighborhood of Barcelona and a good place for a business or leisure visit. I would go there again anytime. And it is great city of course.",4,2014,07,08
19,Amazing hotel,"Thanks to Hotel Claris, we had an amazing trip to Barcelona. The service could not have been any better, the rooms were fantastic (they also kindly upgraded us to a suite as we were celebrating a birthday) Rooms were cleaned twice a day, fantastic location and the restaurant on the top floor is beautiful. Gorgeous food, service and view! I really cannot say a bad word about this hotel, I felt that they really went above and beyond to create the best visit for us.",5,2014,07,03
19,Nicely renovated and well located but...noisy and with a drainage problem in the bathrooms,"This hotel is very well located, just a block off Paseo de Gracia and 10' walk from Plaza Catalunya, this is probably it's major advantage. The building is nicely renovated and the rooms are modern, reasonably spacious and comfortable but it's great location is also a disadvantage as the rooms can be quite noisy given its proximity to major streets in a city that truly never sleeps. We stayed twice and the second time asked the bell boy to change to an interior rooms which management obliged and this made a huge difference.

While nicely renovated I believe that they have a problem with their old pipes, both tub and sink didn't drain well on either stay, and the first time we had to ask twice to fix it which they eventually tried but with less than optimal results.

Staff is friendly and the service in general is good. The roof terrace restaurant has a reputation for good cuisine according to local friends.

We were glad that we didn't book a rate with breakfast included, they offered us 50% discount for breakfast when we checked in but we had to commit to it daily.

Not a bad experience in general but next time I will try a different hotel",3,2014,07,02
19,"Some good things, some need improvement","This was our second time at Claris Hotel.  It is in a good location, and is modern and attractive.  There are some things that need improving to make it outstanding.  Twice our keys would not work--apparently the magnetic strip kept malfunctioning.  It was a hassle to have to get new keys two times in  three days.  The reason given was that the keys possibly were by our I Phones, or perhaps came too close to something in a store!  That seems odd since so many carry phones with them now, and who doesn't go into stores? When we suggested they get a new system they just shrugged it off.  The staff tried to be helpful with information but sometimes we were given inaccurate information.  The hotel also was quite noisy as it was used every day for outside functions.  (We don't remember it being used so much for outside functions).",3,2014,07,02
19,Perfect hotel in BCN,This is a great hotel. Perfect location. Big rooms. Well priced and helpful staff. A definite if your considering a 5 star hotel in the city. Whilst I'm sure there are more modern hotels the claris is a perfect stop if you enjoy excellent service and we'll appointed accommodation. ,4,2014,07,01
19,Great Hotel But Definitely Not 5*,"I booked a junior suite (paid in advance!) and when we arrived, we were given a room! They defended that it was a suite until I told them that a suite has a sitting area and a separate bedroom! It took convincing (by showing them photos from their own website) to get a suite we had booked and paid for already! The staff are nice when you have a question but at other times don't expect the friendly Spanish greetings from the reception staff or the door porter (who was always smoking or on the phone!). The rooms are not soundproof as stated (since you can even hear the toilet flushing from other rooms!)... Location is not convenient and quite far from the beach and the old town (city centre). This is a good hotel but definitely not a five star and I do stay in quite a few 5* hotels every month!",3,2014,06,29
19,Great location for a vacation,"This hotel was recommended to me by a friend who had stayed there on a business trip.  I was looking for a nice hotel in a central location that was not touristy for a solo trip.  I checked in on a Wednesday afternoon thru Sunday.   As a solo traveler in Europe I always make sure I request a room with a western style double bed.  When I checked in I was escorted to my room to make sure everything was OK. It was a really nice room with separate seating area but it had 2 single beds pushed together.  I asked to be moved and immediately was shown another room.  It was smaller and was inside so there was no natural light but it worked out nice for me. I think the original room would have been noisy actually.   And the bathroom was huge with a great rain shower.

The key for me was the location, .I didn't want to be in the Gothic Quarter or around a tourist area.  I walked all over the place... La Sagrada Familia, to the beach down Las Ramblas.  Everywhere and on the days I couldn't walk anymore, the metro was  a few short blocks away.

The concierge staff was very nice but the 2 times I did ask questions, the answers were incorrect so it was good that I relied on my Lonely Planet and Rough Guide books.

I would 100% recommend this hotel to people.",4,2014,06,28
19,Great City Hotel with Charme,"The classic exterior of the hotel is deceiving since the interior is a very modern, stylish venue with egyptian art in many places. The rooms have a nice size and a great bathroom. The roof top terrasse with pool offers great views.
Our room went out on a street with lots of traffice and was rather noisy. The black out shades really black out all light!",4,2014,06,26
19,First but not last stay at Claris,"Friendly, competent, helpful reception 
Comfortable bed
Stylish rooms and tasteful decoration
First class Gourmet restaurant with wonderful wine collection
Good idea for romantic week-end
Good location",5,2014,06,23
19,Beautiful hotel staff that goes above and beyond to make your stay memorable.,"We stayed here for 3 nights after our cruise to enjoy the city of Barcelona and it's a great location for walks or a short cab ride to fantastic restaurants and shopping. Our room was not ready upon check in  (noon) so they held our bags and we had a glass of wine and enjoyed a wonderful lunch on the rooftop. Once we did check into our room on the 5th floor we were dissapointed that the bed was very small and soft, toilet seat broken and  A/C barely cooling the room. We were moved to a larger room on the 4th floor right away and although the A/C still wasn't cold enough the room and bed were very ample and comfortable.Black out shades in the room and rainfall shower heads in the bathroom are quite nice.  Front desk supplied an adapter for our electronics as well. Staff was very accomodating with directions and suggestions and who can't love a friendly doorman who shakes your hand every time you leave or return. As we left for dinner one evening one of the front desk staff came running out to provide an umbrella for the incoming storm. Great customer service. Front lobby is quiet and a bit stark, but peaceful for a nice place to sit and use the free WIFI or rest your feet. Very clean, safe location.",5,2014,06,23
19,Loved it!,"We had a long weekend here and it was just class...

Great views from the roof terrace and pool as Barcelona bustled - along with nice wine and tapas...

Friendly attentive staff too! I wish I was back!",5,2014,06,23
19,Great Hotel,Recently stayed here for my first trip to Barcelona. The hotel was great right from the off where the staff were extremely helpful even before we entered the door! The rooms are of a good size with quality fittings. The lifts are quick and give you quick access to the rooftop pool. The breakfast had a wide variety to choose from so even the most fussy of guests have something to eat. The location of the hotel is superb only being 1 block from the passeige de gracias and only a short walk to multiple metro stations. I would highly recommend staying here and I would happily return on my next trip to Barcelona.,5,2014,06,17
19,Nice hotel but mess on checkout,"Very nice hotel,quiet , exceptionally well located, with perfect room.
However there was a mess on checkout where the preauthorisation took 12 days to get removed from the bank account! Why do hotels always mess this up?
They can charge from your account in seconds yet removing charges takes a long while!
Spoiled the visit unfortunately",4,2014,06,17
19,Claris Hotel offers also apartments,"With my friend we travelled to Barcelona for a week. We wanted to be accommodated in the city centre but we also wanted to live in private flat. Claris Hotel offers apartments just across the street. Our apartment had four rooms - living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. What is different is that the house keeper cleans the flat only once a week and that you must make your own breakfast. But... we enjoyed it a lot!",5,2014,06,16
19,Perfect location. Perfect hotel.,"If you are coming to Barcelona for the first time ever and want to get the perfect combination of variables, Hotel Claris is it! Beautiful accommodations, utter comfort, pristine levels of cleanliness, sleek design, attentive service, wonderful breakfasts and fantastic location. By arriving at your hotel, you are steps away from reaching modernista heaven: Casa Batllo and the Illa de la Discordia, La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia are all a brief walk away. Steps away from Passeig de Gracia, you never have to schlep your many heavy shopping bags too far away. You can reach La Rambla and El Mercat de la Boqueria in less than 20 minutes walking provided, you don't get distracted by your surroundings and take many detours. The Colombus Monument and Barceloneta are about a 30 minute walk away. There are many great restaurants in the area. There are also a few convenience stores and supermarkets. I cannot think of a better location.",5,2014,06,15
19,"Elegant, Helpful, and Friendly","Our stay at the Claris Hotel in Barcelona was a blessing for first time travelers to Spain. The rooms were elegant, comfortable, unusually roomy--each having its own sitting room. All the appointments were modern and tasteful. The breakfast is the best I have ever experienced at a hotel, and the rooftop restaurant is a good lunch stop and nice way to cap off the evening. The staff at the Claris were patient and very helpful, especially the concierge, Laura, and her assistant. Every recommendation and set of directions they gave to us was spot on and worth the effort and expense. The Hotel Claris is very close to The Rambla and some of the Goudy exhibits, which are fundamental to a visit to Barcelona. When I go back, which will be soon, Hotel Claris will be my first choice.",5,2014,06,14
19,"Excellent Location, Great Staff","Three nights at Pau Claris, Barcelona, were a wonderful experience. Upon check in, I was ushered to my room, which was one of the ""duplex"" style, meaning it has an upstairs lounge area with TV, mini bar, couch and chairs. This is a nice touch, especially if you're staying for more than a few nights or one person likes to sleep while the other works or surfs the internet. The bathroom is an absolute haven with all the amenities. Similarly, there is a very useful closet with hangars and drawers (as well as a safe) in which you can keep your clothing organized for longer stays. Staff are gracious, helpful, prompt, and capable. My laundry was returned early, magnificently presented in a lovely basket. What a wonderful touch! On the roof, you'll find a swimming pool to relax and cool off as well as a bar, gym, and meeting rooms. The location was in the center of an upscale neighborhood with all the shopping/dining options you could hope for. Since I like to walk cities, I ventured easily to the old town and the Sagrada Familia. Again, the staff are great! I will upload photos with this review to show the clever design and amenities of this hotel.",5,2014,06,11
19,Terrific location and lovely hotel,"We couldn't have asked for a nicer experience on our recent stay in Barcelona.  We ended up at the Claris both before and after a biking trip and enjoyed the comfortable room, helpful staff, fun terrace bar, and full breakfast.  Even though the hotel is located only a block from Passage de Gracia, our room was quiet and the room darkening shades really helped to be able to sleep.  We were even able to get into our room early on one of our stays.  Laura and Mariane at the concierge desk were extremely helpful with dinner reservations and our visit to the Segrada Familia.  Alex at the front desk was very responsive to any requests.  Would definitely recommend for a centrally located stay away from the craziness down near the waterfront.",5,2014,06,09
19,"Perfect Location, Lovely Hotel and Staff","Perfect position close to passage de Gracia and all the shopping and eateries you could want.
Staff were very professional, friendly and helpful, big thank you to cleaning staff who kept the room No310 immaculate, plenty of clean sheets towels etc and also kept the hotel itself looking great, they work very hard.
Rooms were very smart and bed was large, comfortable and a delight to sleep in after a long day walking round the city.
Roof terrace, polite and courteous staff, nice seating various types, sofas etc, nice pool for a swim  or just keeping cool in the sun, drinks and food available, just ask.
Our room overlooked the busy intersection but i must say that with the soundproofing on the window we did not hear a thing at night, so don""t worry just enjoy the view.
On the picky side, the shower was great but complicated to use at first, would be a problem if elderly, no kettle etc for an early or late night drink and air con could be a bit cooler as would be stuffy in mid summer.
We enjoyed our stay of four days at the hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to our friends and would like to take the opportunity to thank all the staff concerned for making our short stay an enjoyable one.",5,2014,06,07
19,"Nice location, excellent staff","Just some 100 meters from Pg de Gracia. You can easily access the main shopping sites and the Metro. Bus 24 goes directly to Parc Guell which is just 200-300 meters away from hotel.
Decoration is new and modern. Electronic Curtain gives us an exellent sleeping experience!
Very nice staff and we really enjoy the stay.",5,2014,06,03
19,Great Barcelona Eixample Option,"The Claris is part of the Derby boutique hotel group. It's centrally located, has beautifully appointed rooms, bars on ground and roof (pool) level, and all the amenities we look for. Most importantly, the entire staff was wonderful and helpful in every way.",5,2014,06,03
19,Very modern hotel and basic rooms. Helpful staff,This hotel was booked as part of a conference. I like to have space in the bathroom to put my toiletries out & an area next to the bed so I can put my things out. This hotel does not have either. The staff were very helpful and the position was good,4,2014,06,01
19,Charming and convenient,"This was our second visit; the first time was with children.  Both times the staff took excellent care of us and were helpful in giving us advice on restaurants and how to use the city's sightseeing buses.  The interior decoration of our room this time was very interesting -- a sort of ""Chinese antique"" -- and original.  The previous time our rooms were more conventionally decorated but still in impeccable taste.  The bathrooms are excellent and roomy, with high quality fixtures and amenities.  Finally, we enjoyed lunch and drinks at the rooftop terrace.  The bartender was friendly and entertaining without being obtrusive.  All in all an excellent experience -- highly recommended.",5,2014,05,31
19,Great stay.,A slightly belated review for a hotel that met our every needs. Friendly and attentive staff ensured our stay was perfect for the whole time. A great location and beautiful decor made for a very pleasant time and one that we will be looking to do again in the future.,5,2014,05,31
19,Absolutely perfect hotel!,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel, would highely recommend. The room was spectacular and with minimal noise. Staff are so friendly, were so happy to help and even helped with directions, provided maps and pointed out places to visit. The roof top terrace is amazing and with a great view.",5,2014,05,29
19,Our stay in Claris Hotel Barcelona,"Excellent hotel near Passage de Gracia. We had a suite for 3 persons occupied by the  2 of us. So we had more space. Hotel is  very nice decorated with good taste. Very friendly and helpful personal. This was our 4 th visit to Barcelona , each time another hotel ; Next time we come again to Claris hotel.",5,2014,05,28
19,Lovely spot,"What a delight to return to such a quiet, lovely hotel after the stimulation of Barcelona.  The staff was friendly and very helpful, our room was very comfortable and well appointed, the hotel felt both warm and upscale, and the location was terrific.  I highly recommend it.",5,2014,05,28
19,Great Hotel for Barcelona,"The hotel is perfect for a nice relaxing long weekend. Located in a great part of Barcelona, it is walking distance to a vast array of shops, cafes and restaurants. Staff are attentive without being over zealous, generating a general calm about the hotel. The rooms were quiet, comfortable, with a good sized bathroom with an endless supply of very hot water. Beds were comfortable, rooms cleaned with perfection to detail. Taxi's were on demand by the doorman, day or night, the front desk always had at least two staff on it so that you did not have to wait for attention. Nothing was too much trouble. If you need three or four nights in Barcelona, and want to explore the best of the food establishments, and to relax in calming surroundings, then the Hotel Claris is the place for you. It certainly is one of the few hotels that we intend to return to.",5,2014,05,28
19,Nothing is a problem,This hotel is modern with a touch of difference with antiques in each room. It is causal but is refined and elegant. The team of staff are more than pleasant. The hello is genuine as is their smiles. Nothing is a problem and they go to great lengths to ensure your stay is the best most relaxing time you can have. It is well equipped with a a small gym and a beautiful pool on the terrace. The bar on the 7th floor is hard to leave and the perfect place for pre and post dinner drinks. Breakfast is a pleasant buffet that has a personal touch that is attentive to your needs. A perfect location near some great restaurants and sights. This hotel is hard to beat. Credit to the management and staff for making it a break to remember and a hotel to return to. ,5,2014,05,28
19,A Great Barcelona Stay,"We disembarked a wonderful Seabourn Mediterranean cruise in Barcelona and stayed two nights at the Claris Hotel.  For us it was a great post-Seabourn stay.  The hotel is quite chic in an old building.  It is in an excellent location for navigating Barcelona's downtown fine dining, shopping and other attractions, including the Picasso Museum and the very fun Las Ramblas Centre.  There is a rooftop fine dining bar and restaurant that is well worth enjoying and reasonably priced.  All in all, the Claris Hotel is a great stay in Barcelona.  We would stay there again were we to revisit Barcelona, which we hope to do.",5,2014,05,27
19,Perfect location and excellent staff,"The concierge staff are great and friendly, very helpful and goes out of their way to please us, specially, Roberta..  Our room is quiet and we slept really well.  Breakfast was very good and the staff in the breakfast room were all very pleasant.
You can not ask for a better location, we walked everywhere and the taxi stand is just across the street.  
We would definitely recommend Claris Hotel to all our friends who will be going to Barcelona.  If the people of Barcelona are represented by these friendly, helpful and interesting people working in the hotel, why go visit anywhere else?
Thanks for the wonderful time we had in your hotel.

Mrs. Judy Ang",5,2014,05,25

19,Claris Hotel perfect for our short visit,"My niece was visiting Spain - her first trip to Europe- and we spent two nights at the Claris Hotel in a junior suite.  Beautiful room with incredibly comfortable beds and a lot of space to live in.  The location is superb. We like to walk and could do so to most sites we wanted to visit, although the metro is very close by (2 blocks) as well as frequent buses. 
The best thing about the hotel is the staff, they were outstanding. From the doorman to the front desk, restaurants, to the other team members we met, all exceeded our expectations.  Friendly, welcoming, helpful. It seemed as if we were staying with friends. Friends with very good taste in decor and food, I might note. We especially loved breakfast.
I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,05,23
19,Great location and great staff!,"Our number one favorite thing about the hotel is the location. It is situated on a lovely street that is not noisy...but steps away from the best shopping and tourist attractions. I can't overemphasize how important this is for us, because we like to walk as many places a possible. In addition, the staff is lovely and so accommodating. My husband got a stomach virus at the end of the trip and they sent for a thermometer and Tylenol and brought them to the room. Their restaurant recommendations were the best ones I have gotten from a concierge staff. The hotel is lovely and well priced. A personal shout out to deputy general manager Maria Rosa and head of guest services, Laura Noelle, for going above and beyond.",4,2014,05,23
19,"Great location, excellent service , great art as owner is a well known art collector","Just came home from Barcelona - stayed at Hotel Claris for 2 nights. The location was excellent and very safe.
The Terrace Bar/restaurant so pleasant - feels like a resort. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast really nice (hot and cold buffet).
bathroom is very important to me - this bathroom was large, with separate toilet and shower, double sink very modern and nicely decorated.
I was very happy and will return.",5,2014,05,22
19,Great location,"I took my fiancée to Barcelona for the weekend as a surprised and booked a room in Claris gl, did not regret it! Beautiful hotel, amazing rooms and top bar/restaurant terrace. Staff were extremely helpful and so polite. Really attentive to your needs. The location is amazing, right in the middle of it all.. We never got into a taxi! Everything was walking distance, the rooms are amazing double floors. My partner loved it so much we're booking again for his birthday!",5,2014,05,21
19,"Great location, very helpful staff, very nice room!","We enjoyed very much our stay in Barcelona in part because of the hotel location and very helpful staff. The room was very modern and comfortable. We chose the breakfast included package and we are glad we did. Plenty of food and great service. We recommend this hotel, for sure.",5,2014,05,19
19,A very enjoyable stay at Hotel Claris.,"Just returned from a three night/ four day stay in Barcelona. Hotel Claris has a superb location if like us you don't want to be in the very thick of things - ie hot, noisy and dusty - situated in a very nice area of the city and close to Sagrada Familia just below the Diagonal. Also a short walk away from the Passeig de Gracia - a lovely shopping street and convenient for stops for both of the City Bus Tour operators. (Would recommend those too - we took all 3 tours and a great way to see a very large City!) Hotel was stylish with a quiet ambience. Scrupulously clean and our room was kept immaculate. The staff were so helpful, especially on the front desk and the roof bar and small pool delightful especially as the weather was pretty warm and to have outside space a real bonus. Breakfast tasty, fresh and plentiful - would have liked some quiet background music to start the day but know it isn't to everyone's taste. Lovely stay.",5,2014,05,19
19,Excellent hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"The rooms at the Claris were beautifully adorned with Egyptian artifacts. Alex Hernandez, the desk manager had excellent suggestions for restaurants - D'Greco & Teleferanis.
 The location was great ! Eating, shopping, sightseeing, and strolling were convenient.
The Claris is a five star hotel in the heart of Barcelona's L'Eixample neighborhood . The location was convenient to all of Barcelona's icons and metro. This international city is easy to navigate, clean, friendly, and is located approximately thirty minutes, by train, from one of Barcelona's famous Mediterranean beach resorts Sitges.",5,2014,05,19
19,"nice rooms, attentive staff, good location",Had a room with my wife and daughter. Room was okay although the lack of tea and coffee facilities was a little disappointing. Probably a little on the expensive side but the staff where excellent as was the cleanliness. Location was good.,4,2014,05,18
19,If you like the 90s...visit Claris.,"Room was quite dirty.  Hotel common areas were nice, rooms were outdated.  Did I mention that they were dirty?  Quality of linens were very poor.  I'm pretty sure the comforter was a nylon-polyester blend.",3,2014,05,17
19,Claris- perfectly located and top quality Hotel,"The Hotel Claris was the perfect place to stay after a tough 10 day bike ride around the Spain countryside.
Being met at the entrance by the friendly Doorman and then stepping into the impressive foyer immediately gave me a sense of comfort and relaxation.
The room was spacious and modern but tastefully furnished.
Service at the front desk was pleasant and very helpful and I enjoyed the breakfast buffet  which had a wide choice with excellent service by the staff.
Highly recommend the Claris for its location, comfort, quietness, quality and service.",5,2014,05,17
19,Claris - quietly classy,"A beautifully architectured building in stone wood and glass. The pale colours and central atrium give a feeling of air and space. The lobby is vaguely Roman classical and the rooms ancient Egypt, which makes a pleasant change from the ultra modern contemporary hotels. The rooms are large, comfortable and elegant with wood floors, caramel-colored marble and gold detailing. But the ""must see"" is the rooftop pool and terrace. There is also an excellent restaurant with superb views. The service is attentive and above all discrete - the whole hotel suggests an air of calm discretion. Great location, free wifi, excellent service. One of my top choices in Barcelona. ",5,2014,05,16
19,Perfect stay,"Very helpful staff, arranges anything you need even if its not from the hotel. Room service and guest service very efficient and of excellent standard, location can never be better, right in the Middle of everywhere, very nice breakfast buffet.",5,2014,05,13
19,Five Star hotel with scope for subtle improvements,"My wife and I stayed five nights in the hotel.  It is in an excellent location close to most of the main cultural sites, Gaudi's Casa Batlo in particular, the Gothic quarter and La Ramblas.  The public areas and bedrooms are decorated to a very high standard and filled with antiques. The place has a classy feel about it.  Staff are friendly and very helpful.

We had an an excellent meal at La Terraza restaurant.  Food served was of a very high quality although the overall ambience could be improved.  No need for a DJ here in my opinion.  Also the East 47 cocktail bar is worth visiting.  There is a good selection of spirits and a very friendly barman.

Our bedroom was well furnished but lacked natural light. Also it was directly opposite the lift so was a bit noisy on a couple of nights.

The breakfast restaurant served decent food but the overall layout was a bit cramped.

I would definitely recommend you stay in the hotel but ask for a bedroom that has natural light.",4,2014,05,07
19,Nice enough,"Had a four night break just after Easter and found the hotel pleasant and comfortable enough though it was all a bit sterile. The room was clean, the breakfast pleasant and well served - nice to have hot food available! Very handy too for Gaudi fans and not too far from the old town. I would definitely stay here again but it would be nice to see a few errors around, just the odd acknowledgement of human fallibility.",4,2014,05,03
19,Noisy,"Spent there two nights.
Location is really fine and few blocks from the ramblas. A comfortable room welcomed us even thought it was really noisy both from outside and from the inside. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it anyway, due to the price and what we got.
Best place is the terrace, shame on us we forgot the swim suit :-(.",3,2014,05,02
19,Wonderful Hotel Claris,"What a beautiful, wonderful hotel—from the people who work there to the ambience of the space. We were looking for a modern/urban hotel and liked the Claris based on its location, the amenities, and the images on their website. We were not disappointed. Our room was sizable compared to other European hotel rooms, lovely with a contemporary decor and Egyptian accents. The bathroom was especially nice with a big tub/shower, a large window with a great view, and ample space for personal belongings. A turned-down bed, house slippers, and yummy chocolates awaited us at each night's return. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The breakfast/brunch was delicious and included as part of our package.

Last, but not least, the service and staff were absolutely wonderful—professional, friendly, excellent at recognizing our preferences, and always there when we needed them. We publicly want to say thank you to Laura, the concierge, and Ricardo, the manager for taking such good care of us. We were very pleased that we chose to stay at the Hotel Claris and would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,04,27
19,Wonderful hotel in central area of Barcelona,"We stayed here on our honeymoon, and absolutely loved it.  We had one of the Junior Suites with a sitting room upstairs.  We had stayed many other places in Europe, and I would say this is our #1 choice.",5,2014,04,24
19,Stunning Hotel,"We enjoyed three nights in a junior suite at the Claris at the end of March,  the whole experience was truly memorable.
Wonderful room excellent service at breakfast and fabulous meals on the terrace.. We even managed a few cocktails in bar!
The staff were really helpful. The atmosphere was sophisticated and relaxed.....highly recommended great location too.",5,2014,04,23
19,Wonderful,"I have never written on trip advisor before and meant to do this last year when we stayed at the Claris as I was so impressed with the hotel, service and accommodation.  The room was well appointed and clean, and the bed was very comfortable .  I loved the automatic blinds that made the room dark and allowed us to actually have lie ins. The chocolates and slippers each night provided a lovely touch.  The staff at reception were very friendly and helpfu and assisted us with all our tourist questions.  The bar by the swimming pool on the top of the hotel made for a relaxing area between sightseeing and getting ready to go out in the evening.  The hotel is in a fantastic location and makes for easy access to everything that you want to see.  Will definitely be coming back to the Claris next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2014,04,22
19,Highly recommend,"We spent four nights at the Claris at the end of March and we thrilled with the property. Our group book four different rooms, from the Duplex Jr Suite to a standard room and each one had unique properties. 

We were upgraded from the Duplex to a Full Suite. The suite include a full sitting room with TV in the front of the room and a separate bedroom with a beautiful bathroom. Each day, housekeeping would convert our couch to a bed for our son. The conversation was a little more difficult than a normal sofa bed, so we weren't able to switch it ourselves in the morning. There were a few negatives about the room. There are no hooks in the bathroom for towels or robes and the light is more limited, because the window in the bedroom is smaller. However, we found the overall quality excellent and loved the space, especially for a European Hotel.

The standard room and the deluxe room we very similar. I was surprised how big a standard room was, given typical European hotels. Both room types included a nice sitting area but the deluxe rooms had both a larger sitting area and much larger bathroom. All the rooms had the same bath products (nice), robes/slippers and turn-down service.

We were greeted warmly when we arrived by Roberto, who noted on our reservation that we had multiple bookings. As he checked us in, he call Maria Rose, the deputy manager to greet us. I am not sure if that is standard procedure, if it was because we had so many people at the hotel or because of our booking with WhatAHotel. In any case it was a very nice touch. Maria Rosa when through all our rooms and the extra amenities we were receiving with the booking. She apologized that the rooms weren't all ready, which we didn't expect as it was 10:00 a.m. And she shared her card so we could call her with any questions or issues.

The staff at the hotel was mostly excellent. We were greeted, by name by most people, every time we returned. When we ran into Maria Rosa in the hotel, she always stopped to see how our trip was and if we needed any help. The restaurant recommendation the hotel gave was was excellent and we were even treated to a complimentary glass of Cava at the end of the meal. (And it was a very local, inexpensive place where dinner was 105 Euros with drinks). 

Also, the hotel location was excellent. The local neighborhood had tons of reasonable restaurants and bars. There was a public market just down the street (and way less crowded than the Rambles one). We could walk to Sagrada, Las Rambles, and the Barrio. We also had both bus and subway just two blocks away.

I cannot image a better hotel or location in Barcelona.",5,2014,04,19
19,Great location,"Stayed there 3 night in March. The hotel was wonderful and so were the people at the front desk.
Any questions we asked they were able to answer and were very helpful. The rooms were very clean and a pair of slippers by our bed each night was an added bonus. Nice touch!",5,2014,04,16
19,Lovely staff terrible hotel,"If you want comfort in a 5 star hotel the Claris is not for you, the location is great the staff are fabulous...but the rooms are just not up to standard, the beds are tiny and very uncomfortable, we booked adjoining rooms as we travelled with children, but there were none available, we go upgraded which was nice but they don't have double beds it's two singles together on a board, very small and not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel.",2,2014,04,11
19,Spectacular stay!,"This is the first time I've felt the need to write a trip advisor review. Our family of six (two adults and four children) stayed at the Claris for four nights and were knocked out by the hotel in all respects. The duplex and executive rooms in which we stayed were gorgeously decorated, spacious and immaculately clean with views to the picturesque street but still perfectly quiet. The roof terrace and pool gave a spectacular view over barcelona and housed a truly first class restaurant with a great and very well priced wine list. The location was perfect for exploring the city. Most of all, the service was perfect in every way from arrangements to pick up my family from the airport to making impossible to come by reservations at a nearby two star Michelin reservations. I travel extensively for business and stay in many of the world's top hotels when I do and would honestly say that the quality of service, rooms, location, facilities and food at the Claris equalled those of any other hotel I've known at a fraction of the price. Tremendous value for money!",5,2014,04,09
19,An amazing week in Barcelona!,"We spent a week at this wonderful hotel on the recommendation of our daughter who stayed here and is also a hotel concierge in the states..The location was great..very near Passeig de Gracia...the metro and the train..easy day trip to Figueres from here..We really enjoyed walking to local restaurants in the evening..The hotel staff was professional and helpful in many ways..

The rooms had very comfortable beds and noise was not an issue..We stayed on an upper floor with a street view..The rooms were very tastefully decorated..

I would highly recommend staying here..",5,2014,04,06
19,unique gift for hotel guests-- admission tics to Egyptian museum,"This hotel is the last hotel which I stayed at before going home to Singapore. It is a treat to stay in this hotel.The hotel is  centrally located & the staff are polite & most helpful. Even the doorman is most helpful. Also, the hotel is scented with a sweet fragrance.The hotel decor is modern contemporary &  Egyptian antiques are displayed in my hotel room. I received the most unique gift ever from a hotel--- a pair of admission tics to the nearby Egyptian museum!!! The owner of hotel Claris is an avid collector of Egyptian antiques & shares his collection with the public in his private museum. This hotel offers  a brochure , offering helpful tips for travellers to avoid being pickpocketed in Barcelona. Great hotel!!",5,2014,04,06
19,Great hotel for a stay in Barcelona,"check in at hotel very friendly and help ful 
great rooms well arranged 
large bathrooms 
all very clean
good location alot in walking distinance 
small but nice pool on the roof
i will return to this hotel",5,2014,04,03
19,Above and beyond,"Or travel agent suggested this hotel for its location, atmosphere, and feedback from other clients. They were absolutely right! Our room was exactly our taste, eclectic and classy but not goshe. The decor and lighting designer here was right on the money and the decorator was wonderful! We did have a little mishap which was addressed immediately. My husband was taking a shower and the handle came off. He couldn't turn off the water and it was spraying hot water everywhere. We called down and in less than five minutes had a plumber there to rectify the situation. The customer service manager came up and offered to change our room or do anything they could . We did change rooms since I needed to shower and get ready and the shower fixture needed to be replaced. This could have happened anywhere. It looked like a new fixture, and they were name brands so it wasn't because of cheap fixtures. I loved the room but said I would look at the new room. Whoa! The new room had a living room loft and was a suite. Both had large walk in showers with very large rain shower heads and lots of water pressure. The tub in the first room was an air jet and jacuzzi but the suite tub was a piece of art. The living room had a large flat screen tv as well as the bedroom. When we arrived, there was a large bottle of water and wine to greet us. Our stay also included $50 toward dinner in the rooftop terrace restaurant, and there was live music. There was a rooftop pool but it was too cool to swim, and a bar. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is right off Passegio de Gracia and it was walking distance from most of the sights. Breakfast was also included in our rate and it was a very fresh Buffett along with them preparing just about anything along with it, all included. We will definitely stay in this hotel again on our next trip to Barcelona. Oh, people on other reviews have complained about no coffee makers in the room, but why would you want a coffee maker when they bring up complimentary a pot of tea or coffee and all the condiments? You just have to fill out the hanger on the door and circle what time you would like it!",5,2014,04,03
19,Good modern City Centre Hotel with very good staff,"You would have to be seriously picky to fault the staff, especially those at breakfast and also our room lady was really very conscientious. The location is 100 meters from Passeig de Gracia and its very convenient station if you want to day trip to Tarragona, Figueres and Girnona as we did.  Rooms aren't large but were all we needed and were very well maintained. The only real problem we had was an amazing amount of traffic noise, even on the fourth floor and with modern double glazing. I really couldn't understand why.

Breakfasts were good and they keep the orange juice and coffee flowing. Breakfast service staff were really very obliging even when it was very busy.  All sorts of omelets, eggs, bacon sausage, cold meats, fruit, bread and pastries. Well good enough for the four of us at the inclusive price. Went to the restaurant here once. Was certainly good and reasonably priced for a 5* hotel in Barcelona. Just be aware that VAT isn't included in the prices on the menu.

The only real downside is their bizarre wifi policy. Its free if you use the two terminals in the lobby and we got three days free for my laptop in the room but then they want 25 euros for three more days. We were there for 7 nights so was I supposed to pay another 25 euros for my final day? Well of course I just went to a cafe along the road and spent money there when my free days ran out rather than having coffee in the hotel. Hotels, especially 5* ones need to understand that charging for wifi is like charging for hot water in the room. Its just one of the facilities that we all expect as included nowadays as the majority of hotels of all classes do. But not this one.

We all agreed though we would happily stay here again",4,2014,04,02
19,Just thank you claris,It was a really nice trip to a lovely city and we stayed at this lovely hotel. It is a clean hotel which is located in a very good spot. If the weather is fine you can walk to everywhere from the hotels location. The staff was lovely and they made some good surprises for us also. Since the hotel met all my expectations I want to give them 5 stars.,5,2014,04,01
19,Great hotel with wonderful staff,"My husband and I spent a week in Barcelona and, on the recommendation of relatives, stayed in Hotel Claris.  From our warm welcome on arrival to the ""fond farewells"" on our departure back to Scotland, we could not have had a better experience.  The staff, without exception, were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, from booking tickets for venues to explaining directions and best methods of travel.  Breakfast was excellent with friendly, attentive staff.  A meal in the Terrace Restaurant was a must and we were not disappointed.  The Taster menu was wonderful and, again, the staff helped to make it a great experience. Our room was quiet and immaculate.  Would we return?  Most certainly, to this 1st class hotel in this wonderful city!",5,2014,03,30
19,"Great hotel, great location","We went on a bank holiday weekend trip to Barcelona. The location is great, right in the center and well connected to the airport via metro and airport bus close by. The service staff is superb, we received great recommendations regarding restaurants, places to see and a flamenco show! The room was really nice and modern. 

We can highly recommend the Claris Hotel and we will definitively stay there again at the next Barcelona trip.",5,2014,03,28
19,This Hotel is more than a great place to stay!,"My husband and i went to Barcelona and stayed at the Claris.  We were very impressed with the staff and their eagerness to please us any way they could.  The room was so nice and the room service was fast and perfect.  They helped us with everything from last minute dinner reservations to local events. The terrace was magnificent and the view was superb.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone and the price was the best part of all.  Each time we left our room, if we didn't put a door hanger that said do not disturb, the staff would go in and make the bed again, if it was messy and put chocolates, fresh water and a rose and a little note to us to please let them know if we needed anything.  I loved it! So did my husband.  Very Classy and the location was perfect.  This was out first trip to Europe and this choice was great.  If you are a first timer(or even a second timer) try it out.  We will always come back to this place.",5,2014,03,26
19,this is not a 5* hotel,"Just returned from a 4nights stay with my husband. The hotel claims to be a 5* star but the services provided are worthy of a 4*. There is a basic incoherence to the attention paid to the guests. On our second day we returned to the room to find a bottle of water, two glasses, a few chocolates and a hand-written note welcoming us, well we never saw any more bottles of water since that day. The breakfast is not anything special and the service is very slow. Our bathroom wasn't properly cleaned and I realized the last day that the bed sheets were not changed at all during the whole 5 days stay!!!!! Also our room door was right next to the housekeeping door and stairway and the housekeeping ladies were striking up conversations right outside our door from 8a.m., so avoid any rooms close to the housekeeping rooms. Also Wifi is very slow and a paid upgrade is asked for extra speed. Overall the location is good, the stuff is willing and smiling but the aftertaste is not of a 5* class allure.",3,2014,03,24
19,Good potential but not there yet,"We stayed for 4 nights at the executive room. The hotel has a great location and the staff were very polite. The room was at the 4th floor right at the end of the corridor. Unfortunately the house keeping room was opposite our room and we could hear all the conversations of the staff from 8.30 every morning. The room was very nice, with excellent quality of bed and linens. You can have the room completely blacked out which is vital on every hotel. The free internet speed is just terrible. The bed sheets weren't replaced for all our stay and the bathroom hasn't been cleaned thoroughly on a daily basis. The breakfast is average, I would expect more from a 5* hotel. The design of the hotel is very nice thought they need to raise their game in the service and function areas.",3,2014,03,24
19,Average at best.....,"Having just spent 5 nights at the Claris, sad to say that the place is average at best.  The design is quite chic but clearly a case of form over function.....literally.  We were in a duplex and the space is cramped.  No closet to hang clothes (supposed to hang over the desk) and limited drawer space.  All the hard surfaces cause internal noises to echo throughout the room.  Bathroom drains don't work well -- there was a sulphurous odor when the bath tub drains and water bubbled up in the sinks.  The overhead shower looks nice but floods the floor.

On three days (when we were trying to catch up on sleep), there was a loud persistent hammering from upstairs or next door and mgmt. seemed not to care.  No offer to move us, compensate etc. although they knew we were there for several more days.  Wifi was intermittent.  

May be great for one night but not good at all for lux travelers or vacations in BCN.  I have stayed at the Melia and the 1 br suites there are much more comfortable.  Also, try the Husa suites for more space or comfort.  Unfortunately, the Claris is not a 5 star hotel though they want to use design/decor as a substitute for service and function.  Mind you, the mgmt. may reply and apologize or say they are addressing problems but that is not what makes a 5 star hotel.

",3,2014,03,21
19,Barcelona,Great location! Room was small but very nice and clean. Minor issues the staff resolved  to our satisfaction. Truly enjoyed the terrace pool. Concierge was also very helpful in booking local attractions. Would not hesitate recommending this hotel.,4,2014,03,19
19,FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCE,"If you are fortunate enough to stay at this hotel, you will be most impressed with the decor, level of service, and location.  They are one block from one of the most fabulous shopping areas in all of Europe.  No task is out of reach with the dedicated staff.  If being in ""in the lap of luxury"" is your idea while traveling, this is your kind of place.  I will go back any time I return to Barcelona!!",5,2014,03,14
19,"Great location, lovely stay","I really enjoyed by stay at the Claris. Having been at the Mobile World Congress surrounded by 80,000 other people for a week, for my last day and a half in Barcelona I wanted to move somewhere quite, clean and beautiful. The Claris was perfectly located for me; close enough to the centre of town via a 15min walk, and far enough away to be quiet in the evening. Its a stones throw from some of the famous landmarks of the city (again within walking distance - 5-6 blocks to the La Sagrada Familia for example) and its situated at a nice crossroads with plenty of cabs of you need them. The room was large and very clean with lovely, Egyptian-themed fabrics and decorations, including some in glass cases (beware of your kids!). My stay included a complimentary pass to the Egyptian museum across the road (owned by the same group apparently) which was interesting and worthwhile. The staff were very attentive and very conversational without being annoying. The only quibble I had was breakfast - while it was delicious, it was a small buffet with some a la carte choices. I enjoyed it, but I know several of my colleagues would have enjoyed a much bigger spread as they are accustomed to at larger chains. I'll definitely stay again on my next visit to Barcelona. Very happy with my stay there.",4,2014,03,14
19,Lovely stay at Hotel Claris,"I stayed at the Claris Hotel for 2 nights in March 2014 and have to say its a very beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff were friendly and courteous throughout the stay. Getting free access to the Egyptian museum down the road was a nice surprise as well. Both my partner and I enjoyed the ancient art work in the room and on the first floor. I felt this was a lovely touch which showed originality over other luxurious hotels I have stayed in.

The one criticism I had, if you can call it a criticism, is the blind wasn't a blackout blind (which I am used to) and so I was awoken by the sunlight. By the second morning however I found this to be a much pleasanter way to wake up rather than alarm and as the trip was for sightseeing the main aim is to be out and about early anyway.

If I ever return to Barcelona this will be the only Hotel I look to stay in. A very big thanks to all the staff especially the maid who came in at approx 5pm both evenings to prepare the room and the very nice waiter at breakfast.",5,2014,03,11
19,Exciting visual design and service to match,"We picked it on line for its design-oriented description. The Claris really is visually exciting throughout.  We were especially pleased by the staff and service.  The breakfast buffet is first rate.  The hotel has a little in-house Egyptian museum, and provides a free pass for the larger Egyptian museum down the street.  We should have booked farther ahead to stay here all the nights we were in Barcelona.",5,2014,03,09
19,"Great location, stylish, and great service","I stayed at the Claris Hotel during Mobile World Congress week.  As others have described, the hotel is modern, stylish, and the rooms are spacious with a great bed.  It is truly a luxury hotel in a great location -- with prices to match.  But what made the Claris special was the staff.  I left my mobile phone and charger in the room when when I checked out at 6 AM to catch an early morning flight.  One call from the airport to the hotel, and the staff retrieved my phone and sent it to me by FedEx! What a great experience!",5,2014,03,04
19,the best hotel ever !!!!,"we arrived in barcelona at 6:30 a.m., and at the claris hotel shortly after.... our room was available, and we were greeted cordially !!!....  the room was beautiful , spacious, and had a bed that was super comfy !!!  room was spotless, and the bathroom  was gorgeous !!!...   the bath salts, shampoo etc. were so beautifully presented... a real class act !!!.... the lobby is gorgeous, breakfast coffee was delicious !!!.......  turndown came with chocolate, and a bud vase with a red rose !!!   a bottle of fancy water and wine were delivered to our room for my birthday ( which hubby advised the desk of)... cannot wait to return to barcelona and he claris !!!!!t",5,2014,02,26
19,"Stylish, comfortable, peaceful","Having stayed in Barcelona on many occasions, I know how difficult it can be to get 'the right' hotel. I was on my own and wanted a few days of peace and quiet but not to be too far from the shops and good places to eat. This hotel absolutely did the job!
Greeted by a helpful doorman who took my bags from the taxi, the chap at reception couldn't have eben more welcoming or helpful. My room was large enough and had a comfortable bed. The decor was simple, elegant, rather than stylish. The bathroom, though compact, was very well designed and had a good sized bath and powerful shower with instant steaming hot water.
Lots of fluffy towels, bathrobe, slippers (replaced daily!) and a good supply of quality toiletries all help to make you feel at home. And the roomw as well insulated so that I was never disturbed by late or early activity in the corridor.
The breakfast was superb. A very good fresh buffet with a number of hot options to order. My breakfast was included in the room rate so worth checking when you book.
If I'm going to have a moan it is only the absence of a coffee maker in the room. I expect that in a 5* hotel. I also could ahve done with better pillows - being alone I had extra to hand from the other side of the bed, but they were quite thin and easily flattened.
The location is good for shops and there are some good local restaurants and bars. I'd certainly recommend this hotel and commend the staff for their courteous attentive service.",4,2014,02,26
19,"Modern, clean, roof too bar and look. Expensive.","Hotel was very modern and clean with good service. The hotel itself was reasonably priced but when you get there, stuff in the hotel is pretty expensive. The
Roof top bar is lovely but again a bit pricey. The pool is fantastic if a bit small. There are about 6-8 sun loungers and a few more chairs so it's a bit of a contest to see who can bag them. If you get one is very enjoyable.

A few minutes walk to the Passieg de Gracia which is a big shopping street but for those who shop at Chanel and Armarni mostly. Some lovely Gaudi architecture there but wouldn't eat round there because it's the same food you get a tube stop away for double the price. 

Close to a subway.",4,2014,02,23
19,We changed our original plans to stay here and glad we did - excellent,"No issues whatsoever.  We felt the location fine for value.  Staff were excellent.  If I had anything to comment on it would be wifi, although towards the end of our stay the wifi settled.   Thank you for a lovely and memorable stay in Barcelona ",5,2014,02,21
19,Amazing staff and good location,"My mom and I stayed here for 3 nights and we loved this hotel! It is a very authentic spanish hotel and 1 block off the main shopping road. It is about a 20 mins walk to Las Ramblas and 25-30 mins to the Gothic Quarters. It was nice being away from Las Ramblas and all the craziness that is around the street.  We walked to Las Ramblas and took the Hop on Hop off bus to other locations in Barcelona. The tourist bus stop is only 3 min walk from the hotel which was very nice because we took this bus to go to Park Guell, the beach area, and other farther locations outside of the central city area. The staff is amazing and we had some of our best meals in Spain because of the recommendations that staff made! They made reservations for us every night at local spanish restaurants! The rooms are nice! We were upgraded to a suit which was great. The breakfast is a traditional spanish breakfast with bread, meat, fruit etc. But you can also order pancakes and eggs if you would like to. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.  We would stay at this hotel again! Thank you Claris Hotel for an amazing stay while we visited the city!!",5,2014,02,10
19,It had been a great experience..,"Being an international and overseas traveler, me and my family decided to put this hotel amongst the best ones we have ever experienced globally. Especially the service provided by the concierge was 5 star. The peak was the ""pet festival"" organised by the hotel's group which made us very happy, as well as being invited as a customer of the hotel. Also the terrace restaurant at the top, had a great lunch menu that we enjoyed the first day we arrived.",5,2014,02,10
19,Friendly Staff .... poor bedroom for business,"A great location , friendly and helpful staff and delightful tapas and roof terrace .... but oh the bedrooms ! Terribly small bedrooms , poor lighting , a tv positioned poorly for watching from the bed and no desk with chair for working from ..... really hopeless for our business trip , uncomfortable mini sofa and noisy from both corridor and adjacent rooms ... breakfast pretty average and rather slow and feel that an injection of reality is needed ...especially given that we were sent to the only souless tapas bar in the city when requesting the best .... not sure a return visit warranted !Also the worst pillows ever encountered and a gym so small it was worth missing",3,2014,02,07
19,"Claris, a superior customer service experience","You can always find photos and information on Hotels for their rooms, prices, location, transportation etc. In many cases though we forget the most valuable asset, their people and service. 

Having traveled almost everywhere in Europe for business and pleasure, having stayed at more than 100 different hotels, i can safely say that at Claris where I stayed with my wife and 8month old kid we were treated exceptionally well, the stuff were fantastic, immediately responding to all of our requests and believe me with a young baby it's not easy... 

So, a big thank you to all people at Claris!",5,2014,01,24
19,Really great,"A Very good hotel, downtown, near La  Rambla and plaza Catalunya. Great service, friendly and helpful staff and good food. A very good choice. We needed baby cot which they gave us and was new. Very clean.",5,2014,01,23
19,Great location !,"Just back from a 4 day stay at Hotel Claris... what an amazing hotel ! Location is key here, with Sagrada Familia only 15/20 mins stroll and La Rambla 15 mins away. Definately a luxury hotel...... we didn't take them up on the expensive breakfast offer, especially with cafe's on every corner in the area.... Shame to not have tea and coffee in the room, but hardly a major problem.... will visit again !",5,2014,01,20
19,Wonderful service and great location!,"The staff was excellent. The reception, housekeeping, the doormen and the staff in the breakfast room were all very friendly and did all they could to help. They did everything from booking tickets to see the Segrada Familia to ordering us a pizza at night. The location of the hotell was great. Just a 15 minute walk away from most things. You could walk everywhere and the neighborhood seemed very safe. Cafe Josephine across the street was a lovely surprise.

The beds were a little bit uncomfortable, and the excecutive room did not have tea/coffee making facilities. 

All in all we would definitely come back to this hotel for our next stay in Barcelona!",4,2014,01,15
19,Excellent Service,We had a most lovely and wonderful stay with the Claris.  The property is excellent and we especially love the art pieces.  Most importantly the service was top-notch and the staff were most helpful and sincere.  Fantastic.  Can't wait to return and also visit their other properties.,5,2014,01,03
19,Excellent hotel with warm service,"Hotel Claris is well located close to passeig de gracia. The property is beautiful, with a good collection of art displayed all over. Rooms are good-sized, well appointed and clean. Service was impressive and warm. Special mention must be given to Alex, who made every effort to make us feel welcome in the most sincere way. Thumbs up for the excellent service delivery!",5,2014,01,02
19,Excellent,"Very nice Hotel right in the center of Barcelona.
 Upgraded the bedroom to a suite with bottle of wine
Breakfast buffet was excellent with hot and cold food available
All the staff were very nice and helpful with any questions
Will stay here again when next in Barcelona",5,2014,01,01
19,The Claris - A big thank you!!,"Driving from Mallorca to UK with our beautiful french bulldog, we needed a dog friendly hotel in Barcelona on the night of December 12th.
We found and booked the Claris for an overnight stop and believe we found a very special place.

We loved the architecture, interior design and the room but most of all, we thought the staff team to be highly professional, extremely welcoming and friendly and great ambassadors of the company / brand they represent.
When the need arises again in the new year, we will book again.

Thanks againl

",5,2013,12,31
19,Very nice place,"We had a long week end at this hotel during early december. Good place at 5 minutes from the subway.
Very good beds, the room was very clean and people very helpful.

A good place to stay to visit Barcelona.",5,2013,12,30
19,A stylish home away from home,"We have just finished a 4 night stay at this hotel and I can only say that I wish we could have stayed longer.  We were greeted on arrival like old friends by the Manager Jose Louis and the assistant manager Rosa.  They really went out of their way to make sure that our stay was the best it could be.  We were given a spacious suite which we really appreciated.  The staff were all so friendly and we especially liked the fact that they all seemed to know our names, even the ones that we had not come across before.  A special thanks to all the staff who made our stay so special and the boys in the Terrace restaurant who served a wonderful degustation dinner and made out Giant Gin and Tonics every afternoon after our sightseeing.  The hotel is perfectly located for exploring Barcelona,  Walking distance from the Ramblas and only around the corner from the Passage de Gracia and the Gaudi Modernista buildings.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone considering staying in Barcelona and I only hope we get to stay again, perhaps in the summer.",5,2013,12,27
19,Great location,We stayed at the Hotel Claris for a short break in September. The location is fantastic - less than 5 minutes from the metro and within easy walking distance of the old town and all the major sites. Our room was well designed and immaculate with a very comfortable bed but our room was a little on the small side and therefore perhaps a little over-priced considering that we didn't have breakfast included.,4,2013,12,22
19,Gracious,"A very classy boutique hotel with a beautiful lobby and interesting furnishings in the rooms.  Gracious and friendly service from top to bottom.  The hotel is perfectly located on a quieter area but very close to the Gaudi apartments and really just a short walk to the busier, touristy center.   The small pool on the roof is a great place to relax with a glass of wine after a day of walking.  ",5,2013,12,21
19,Fabulous Stay,"I stayed at Claris Hotel in early December for 2 nights. The hotel was simply wonderful. The location is central, close to the main sites of attractions. The hotel was also clean, well kept and everything was of an extremely high standard. The bed was absolutely amazing - it was firm and perfect for people with lower back problems like myself! I would definitely choose to stay in Claris Hotel again if i go to Barcelona again.",5,2013,12,14
19,Great Boutique Hotel,"Very stylish hotel, reception staff very helpful. out room wasn't ready when we arrived so they offered us a glass of fizz at the roof bar. Rooms very comfortable and well appointed with a number of nice touches. Location excellent - very near main shopping area and only a 10-15 min walk from Las Ramblas. Would certainly stay again.",5,2013,12,13
19,Weekend in Barcelona,"I stayed at the Hotel for a weekend in December with a friend of mine.  We came over from Paris and had a lovely stay at the hotel.  The staff was helpful with directions and recommendations; it’s in a wonderful location and is close to the Metro too.  The terrace on the roof is amazing, nice views and great selection of wines too!  All in all we had a very nice stay at the hotel!  Something to note, especially for American travelers: I forget if this is a 4 or 5 star hotel but remember, typically everywhere in Europe, whatever the star rating, Always think 1 star down.  So for example, if you are staying at a 3-star in Europe it’s comparable to a 2-star in the US or if 4-stars in Europe similar to a 3-star in the US.  Don’t expect a 4 star hotel in Europe to be comparable to a 4-star in New York City!",4,2013,12,13
19,Well placed,"Well placed hotel, decent facilities.
Stayed in a junior suite (517), must admit we expected a bit more from it.
Room has no view. Experienced a couple of minor issues, all of which were dealt with expediently by the staff, who are excellent by the way.
Good base to explore an excellent city.",4,2013,12,13
19,Perfect oasis - best location - accommodating staff,"We stayed for one night following a cruise.  We had stayed at another slh member while in Paris and decided to give this one a try.  Would stay again, no questions asked.

We had a junior suite and the room was huge.  We much liked the decor as well.  The bathroom was large, we had no annoying water issues, so not sure how to comment on those.  Staff was wonderful.  Quick check in and out, scheduled restaurants and car service for us as well.  Little touches like turndown service with chocolates are nice.  Afforded the walking distance to everything.,,can't wait to be back!! 

We went up to see the fitness room and pool but did not use. (Weather not super warm)...but a nice amenity.   3 machines for 199 rooms probably a bit small.  But not a deal breaker.  If you are looking for something to complain
about, the sinks drain slow.",5,2013,12,10
19,Leisure break,"Stayed for 3 nights and so upgraded ourselves to a Junior Suite. However, (room 205) Junior Duplex Suite was disappointing.  We thought we would have a view but you'd have to lie on your bed sideways to observe the street. The lounge area was upstairs and was rather small and claustrophobic. The staff were very good and moved us to an upgraded room, no 318.  This room was better in size but couldn't understand the concept of the bathroom sink. No plug hole, the water just constantly runs away, temperature only luke warm and both taps sprayed you sideways when you turned them on.   The hotel itself was ok but I'm not sure how it got its 5* rating?  However, all that said, the location was great for Las Ramblas, the staff so helpful and accommodating and probably the best asset of the hotel.  Breakfasts were very good. The roof terrace a great place to enjoy a quiet drink.  The roof terrace restaurant also very, very good. ",4,2013,12,08
19,Fabuloso,"Great central location, could spoke out to sites in all directoins.  Bistro across street aloowed for food-to-fly.  Rooms were modern decor and clean.  Friendly staff.  Taxi stand right across street made for easy travels around an awesome city.",5,2013,12,07
19,Beautiful,"Stayed in February with my wife and another couple, what a beautiful hotel, this period building is just amazing as it is on the inside as it is on the outside. Our room was spacious and airy which was good as we found it quite warm when we arrived. Stayed for 3 days and it not long enough! Also pool was a plus! ",4,2013,12,04
19,3 stars is fair,"This is not a 5 star hotel. Location is fair. Amenities below average. Breakfast served in a small room in the basement without windows. Food at terrace restaurant only fair but to 5 star hotel price. Small room, no chair for working at the desk. Slow internet.",3,2013,11,24
19,5* staff but 3* facilities,"A good location and great staff make up for what are average facilities. 

As mentioned below (in a number of comments), a gym should constitute more than 3 machines so very misleading. Also the shower head in my hotel room kept leaking into the rest of the bathroom, not by design I might add! 

",3,2013,11,19
19,A few hiccups,I stayed at this hotel for a couple of days at the beginning of November to give my wife a suprise Birthday at a 5* Hotel.  We arrived at the Hotel to be greeted by reception staff/concierge! one of whom took my car keys to park the car.  Booked in ok and taken to our room where we started to unpack but realising I had left my coat in the car I returned to reception to collect my keys and was directed to the car park through a rear door in reception with no directions to the car.   On getting to the lift to the car park there were 7 floors shown.  Realising my mistake I returned to reception to enquire of the concierge! to whom I had given my keys as to the location of the car.  He did not know he then approached the doorman to whom he had apparently given the keys and he couldn't remember.  The concierge! then took me to the car park to search for my car which was found on the 3rd floor.  So much for the service and 5*s.  The room we had was very good but lacking in a mirror in the room which was a nuisance as the only one in the bathroom always steamed up.  There were no coffee making facilities in the room.  Breakfast was ok nothing to write home about and we did not eat in the evening there.  Would not recommend this Hotel as a 5*.  The best thing about the hoptel were the beds which were very comfortable.,3,2013,11,19
19,First Class All the Way,"I had the good fortune of having the Claris Hotel in Barcelona recommeded to me by a close friend.  I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, arriving from Vancouver Island, Canada.....a long trip and I was very tired !  This hotel has an understated elegance and style with a staff that were both friendly and professional.   While there were some extremely wealthy guests at the hotel, everyone was treated with the same polite and warm manner that made you feel valued as a patron of the hotel.   The rooms were gorgeous  and like a mini-suite.....with beds turned down in the evenings and a delicious chocolate placed on my pillow !  The continental breakfast was delicious with a wide selection of meats, cheeses, breads and fruits.....better than any continental breakfast I have seen anywhere!   I highly recommend this hotel...it was fantastic !",5,2013,11,09
19,"Great Sevice, Great Rooms, Great location","We stayed at Claris on two occassions in August/September.  The hotel is very well located, close to the main shopping strip and many of the famous Gaudi tourist attractions.  The hotel staff were really great, helping with reservations and providing recommendations etc.  We also liked how close the hotel is to many of the great restaurants in Barcelona. We stayed in two different rooms, one a regular room, the other a suite on our second visit. Both were modern, stylish and clean.  We would recommend the hotel and stay there again.",4,2013,11,04
19,WONDERFUL HONEYMOON,"Lovely welcoming staff. We were upgraded to an executive room, really beautiful.  On our first night a bottle of champagne and a red rose were delivered to our room from the hotel. So grateful to the staff for such wonderful treatment.",5,2013,11,03
19,I've stayed in MUCH better 3* hotels,"I stayed her with my husband and 1 year old toddler at the end of October 2013. My first impression of the hotel was that it was beautiful, clean and staff were very helpful.
We arrived in the evening and requested a free baby cot via email which was confirmed. On arrival I enquired about upgrading from a Superior Double room to an Executive Double to which I was told we had already been given a complimentary upgrade. GREAT!! However I do think that we were only given the upgrade as the baby cot wouldn't fit in a smaller room as it just about fit in the Executive Double (I could be wrong)!
We decided as it was late to order room service, after trying to called the number for an hour to no response I called reception and had them order for us (we were starving by this time)! Food arrived and was average at best, we knew it would be expensive but still was by no means worth the money. Then as I needed to heat up my daughters food I realised there were no tea/coffee making facilities, I requested one from reception and was promptly given one however still no tea or coffee available. The next morning after my amazing shower I noticed the water went everywhere, this is a minor problem but the drain near the door fills up very quickly and you are left with a soggy floor. I then realised there was no hair dryer- again I called reception and one was brought to my room, not ideal!
The worst part of the trip was watching my daughter exploring her new surroundings as she had just started walking and she picked up something from the floor, luckily my husband and I managed to take it from her before she put it in her mouth and we realised it was some kind of cable - lots of copper wires surrounded by black plastic covering. I was horrified, if she has swallowed that that could have caused some serious damage. 
To top it all off the last day we were there we tried to have a siesta as our flight meant we needed to be awake by 3.30am when all we could hear was works being one to the hotel- banging and drilling it was awful!

Some other points to consider, the gym is NOT a gym, it is 3 machines (treadmill, cross trainer and a step up machine I think) it's a waste of space.

The breakfast was as expected for Spain and you could order hot food which was good, some days the bread was old and others it was fresh- hit and miss. But the staff at breakfast were superb and very welcoming!

Location was good, walking distance from some good restaurants (go to the rodizio it was amazing) and some tourist attractions.

Overall not a great stay but not the worst, I wouldn't ever come back here again and wouldn't recommend others to either!",2,2013,11,01
19,Welcoming staff at a great hotel!,"Stayed here for two night's for an anniversary and was very impressed. The location is fantastic and within walking distance of some superb restaurants and all the major tourist attractions. The hotel is stylish, without being trashy, and has some very accommodating and friendly staff. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a excellent hotel that is well located.",5,2013,10,31
19,worst night ever,"We paid 277 € and got a 17-18 m/2 room without any windows. Strange smell of glue from the bathroom. There was an open glas door to the atrium, a 12 meter drop to the 1 st floor if there had been an active  child it would have been a real danger. There was very loud music from a terrace until 00.30 which was not turned down although we asked three times to cut the noice. There was a minibar but no bottle opener to be found.",1,2013,10,28
19,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel 

- Great location , 1 block away from. Metro and Main Street "" Pasieg de Gracia "" , plenty of shopping  and restaurants near by 

- very clean hotel 

- sound proofing , not perfect but very very good 

- rooms have blinds which conpletely black them out , great for getting sleep of your jet lagged 

- roof top pool , very nice 

- gym needs work , only basic very light set of weights , treadmill doesn't work properly ( belt slips ) 

- beds form but comfortable 

- staff are absolutely perfect , to say they were nice and helpful , does do justice to how good these people were , nicest most enegetic and hard working group I have come accross 

Overall we loved our stay at this hotel so much that we decided to stay longer then originally planned",5,2013,10,27
19,"Good Hotel, but not a five stars!","Excellent location. Close to a lot of restaurants and stores. 
Hotel staff was kind, yhe room was ok. Clean and with good space.
But i doesn't look like a five star.
Great rooftop with a good pool and a nice bar and restaurant.",4,2013,10,20
19,"Great location, luxury accommodations","We stayed here in a junior suite for about a week for our honeymoon and had an amazing stay. The workers were very nice, the room was clean and modern, and we slept incredibly well (the blackout shades helped). We loved the rooftop pool and bar, visited almost every day. 

The location is amazing. La Pedrera and Casa Batllo are very close, on a street with lots of good window shopping. It's a block or two from the Passeig de Gracia metro station, which will take you all over the city easily. There's also a train station a block away that has trains to the airport and for day trips. They also have a driver available, though I don't know if he takes you anywhere or just to the airport. We used him to get to the airport for 35 euros.",5,2013,10,15
19,GREAT BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"We stayed for several nights at the Claris Hotel at the start of our trip to Spain.  The room was very comfortable and large by European standards.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Ricardo the Front Desk Manager.  He recommended restaurants that turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable as well as sight seeing destinations, even food stalls at the Ramblas.  Every detail was taken care of for us.  Visiting Barcelona we would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,10,15
19,"Great location, fine hotel, modern design","We stayed  here for 3 nights at the end of our  two-week trip to Spain. We picked this hotel, part of the Derby chain, because of the great experience we had at the beginning of the trip staying at the Urban Hotel in Madrid. This hotel is very similar  in experience, very modern, Egyptian art, rooftop deck. It is in an excellent location one block from the Passeig de Gracia and walking distance of the Rambla, the Gaudi houses, and the fancy shopping, etc. We stayed the first night in an executive room on the fifth floor facing the front of the  building and asked to be switched to the courtyard side because of the traffic noises starting at seven am. They accommodated us and we slept very soundly for the next two nights!  We very much liked this hotel, but I found a few things in the room didn't live up to the five star experience, such as sluggish sink  and bathtub drains, burnt out lighbulb, housekeeping which didnt change the dirty glasses. Minor things but for the price, you expect more. On the upside, we really like the Derby hotel experience so would highly recommend.",4,2013,10,13
19,"Not quite 5 star, more a good 4 star","Downsides: Walls are thin, duplex apartments bizarrely have only the lounge upstairs, service at the roof-top bar is nonexistent.
Positives: clean rooms, the best location in Barcelona, friendly staff.",4,2013,10,11
19,Wonderful location in the heart of the central district,"We had a lovely 3 day stay in Barcelona at this trendy hotel. It is within walking distance of all the Gaudi attractions, Picasso museum, shopping district, Gothic Quarter and La Rumbla. Our room was across from the Egyption museum on the first floor - interesting. The daily included breakfast was very good and satisfying. The staff was very attentive, friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,10,05
19,Unique Hotel for Collectors,"This hotel is a lovely hotel, one that will make art lovers' hearts melt!  There are original art pieces all over the lobby and in the rooms.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spotless and quiet.  The window shades at night drown out all light, we slept like the dead!  The location was part of this great package!  We were just a short walk from two of the main streets in Barcelona (Gracia and La Rambla). We had a high quality experience, but didn't pay the kind of rates you would pay on Gracia.  Plus, the comfortable and attractive roof top bar and terrace gave us a great place to view the fireworks down by the port during St. Merce's festival.  I highly recommend this property!",4,2013,10,01
19,Charming hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"After a 10 day cruise of the Mediterranean, what a charming hotel by which to have been greeted.  Beautiful rooftop with a pool, restaurant, and private dining.  Friendly staff, complimentary business center, and cocktail lounge on the ground floor.  HIghly recommend.",4,2013,09,28
19,A great weekend in Barcelona in a fantastic hotel,A five star hotel with five star service in the heart of Barcelona city centre. We were not disappointed with the Claris and would recommend to all. The rooms were well equipped and very tastefully decorated and the roof top restaurant and pool are a delight. Don't forget to book asap if you want to dine at the roof top restaurant as it is small and fills up very quickly. Food was excellent. Overall no complaints at all and would highly recommend.,5,2013,09,17
19,Close to everything;,Everything was impeccable. The surrounding neighborhood was very safe. There is a fantastic pool on the roof. This is a great way to unwind after enjoying the city. The rooms were spacious and beautiful. We were there during a heatwave but the air conditioning was excellent. They had the room ready when we arrived so we could sleep off the jet lag. The staff was friendly.,5,2013,09,14
19,Very Enjoyable,"We stayed here for three wonderful nights in Barcelona. Staff were fantastic especially doorman and bar staff on roof top bar. Whole hotel, including rooms, are well decorated in a ""funky art"" sort of way (we thought similar to Ellement in NYC). Location was a little on the outer of the maincity area but is was only a short walk to the central part so no real problem.
Our only concern (observation) was the doulbe bed - I dont think we have ever had a double bed in a five star before",5,2013,09,14
19,Design! Very nice! Great Location!,"Clean design room. Big bathroom. Good closet. Good bed. Great location: one block to Passeig de Gracia and 3 blocks to Batló House (metro also). Great terrace for lunch and dinner (make reservation for dinner). Chocolates twice a day on the bed. Gorgeous breakfast, but it didn´t included in our taxes room and the frontdesk checking didn´t tell us (27 euros/day/person). Finally, we really recomend the hotel!!!",5,2013,09,11
19,good location,"had a 3 day break hotel in good location for most of the attractions the metro only a short walk away which was very easy to navigate and was a very cheap way to travel.rooms were comfortable 
and having full blackout blinds and very good air con helped with sleeping.
was nice of an evening to come back to the roof top terrace looking over the city while sipping a cocktail.had no meals at the hotel so cannot comment on food but many restaurants not far away.
found all staff very helpfull, and the hotel spotless.",4,2013,09,09
19,"Friendly and Attentive Staff Rooms Dark, Tired, and Poorly Constructed","What's positive:
- Friendly and attentive staff
- Good Location
- Quite neighborhood
- Clean sheets
- Safe location

What's negative
- Thin walls and plaster falling off in living area
- Worn room (sofa torn, furniture tired, plastic chairs)
- Noisy vibration resonating in room origin not known
- Building noises all the time, flossing, doors closing, neighbors.
- Hard bed and poly foam pillows.
- Bathroom shower pools with water, knobs loose and fall off.
- Expensive for value
- Free Internet is very slow and only supports browsing or web based mail.  $10 euro extra for   service that supports email apps and other services other than port 80 or web traffic.",3,2013,09,07
19,excellent 5*boutique hotel,"Stunning hotel
Rooms were wow
we had a mini suite spa bath and shower
amazing mosaic tiles
Artwork in rooms Egyptian museum on premises
Food was excellent rooftop dinning, gourmet food
free wifi
A delight to be a quest there",5,2013,09,04
19,Good hotel but had better 4 star stays,"Hotel is really pretty and clean, food in the restaurant was really
Nice and we were treated really well that evening just a tad expensive. Could do with more sunloungers at the pool, the pool itself for five star could be bigger. The young staff at the door were really friendly at the door and the door man was really nice but the older reception staff we quite abrupt and at times we felt they looked down on us. The cleanliness is excellent and location is good for metro etc. overall a good hotel but we have had better four stars that this five.",4,2013,09,04
19,"This was the ""Perfect"" stay for 4 days","My partner and I stayed at the Claris for 4 days (Aug.23-27) The staff was very accommodating, polite, very knowledgeable of the area, and everyone spoke English! The room was very spacious and clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. This was the perfect location for us. Close to Placa Cantalunya, Las Ramblas, with the best shopping within 5-10 walking distance and the best tapas restaurant ever! The rooftop bar/restaurant at the hotel is a must see! No negatives about this hotel from us:)",5,2013,09,02
19,Would stay again,"Lovely hotel in ideal central location. Reasonably priced compared to many other 5-star hotels I've stayed at in Europe. Cool decor throughout. Excellent roof terrace with small pool, which got very busy late afternoons. Stayed 4 nights in duplex junior suite with superb bathroom. Ate at terrace restaurant one evening and it was top-notch, but not cheap! Hard to find much to criticise other than temperature of 'hot' breakfast items - lukewarm at best, and actually cold one day!",4,2013,09,01
19,It was just the location for us.,"Pretty good location for a city hotel but the decor wasn't really to my liking. My partner found it a little cold. It wasn't a problem since we sopent only 2 nights here. However, there was a slightly odd smell that trailed us everywhere. I don't know how old this hotel is but our room looked a tad dated and worn. Maybe we were unlucky and got chucked into an older room. I wouldn't comment much about the food. They have a reasonable breakfast service but I wouldn't write home about it. personally i guess the service level made up for all the other shortcomings. We did after all received some friendly and helpful service.",3,2013,08,26
19,Stylish hotel which is centrally located,"I stayed at the Claris hotel in August with my daughter, sister and two nieces.  Upon arrival our rooms were not ready so we were given complimentary drinks vouchers for the bar on the top floor of the hotel by the pool.  My sister and I were given a very delicious glass of champagne! When we returned to get our room keys at reception we found to the delight of my sister and nieces they had been up graded to a large and beautifully decorated junior suite! We had a small, but nicely decorated modern double room.  The rooms were always clean, lots of towels and toiletries being replenished..

So... The hotel is in a nice quiet area yet minutes from where all the shops and restaurants are.. The staff were very well dressed and helpful.. There were interesting Egyptians artefacts in the reception and in the rooms.. Only two minor things I thought I should mention, there were not many sun beds around the pool and the other was the breakfast is just okay.. We got a good deal on the breakfast as we had it every morning of our stay so it was 11.50 euros each per person, however it is normally 22 euros per person and I don't feel it would have been worth it. We would still stay here again next time we visit Barcelona as we've stayed in other hotels in this city, however this is definitely the best one for location!",4,2013,08,24
19,Great service and atmosphere on the roof terrace,"The location of this hotel makes it a very good choice for a long weekend in Barcelona. The public areas are most definitely 5 star however the rooms and breakfast were more like 3/4 star. The roof terrace is amazing, the pool is small but perfect when it is not too busy. The staff are very helpful and have good recommendations for good restaurants nearby. However the rooms are very small and have no tea/coffee facilities in the room (this may be a continental thing), breakfast has a good selection of cold food but not much hot food, over the 3 days we were there the selection didn't change. We didn't eat in the restaurant but the roof terrace bar had well priced cocktails and wine.",4,2013,08,24
19,Helpful staff in a great location,"I really enjoy my stay.  This hotel is well located and the staff is always helpful.  The size of the room is small but very clean.  The breakfast buffet is average.  Always the same selection during the entire week. The staff is helpful.  The pool is nice, however, there is not enough shaded area around it and not enough long chair for all the guests to enjoy it...  Our room was located on the street side.  We did have some difficulty sleeping because of the noise.  Overall, we would recommend it.",5,2013,08,21
19,Stylish Hotel close enough to tourist area but not right in it!,"We stayed at the Claris Hotel in April 2013.  We were warmly greeted by reception and ushered into a junior suite. The elevator is small so if you have more than 2 luggage you might be making two trips because we had to haul our luggage ourselves.   The hotel is stylish with clean lines.  We had a spacious room with a small closet.  The bed was comfortable with good sheets.  The bathroom is small with no door for privacy.  There isn't much if any counter space for toiletries. The bathroom floor gets quite wet when the shower is used.  The tub with water jets is relaxing but drains very slowly.

Hotel staff was helpful when we had questions or asked for directions.  We had breakfast the three days we were there. Breakfast is nothing special.  It is limited but adequate.  The wait staff (all of them) were unfriendly and not eager to serve.  You had to ask them to refill water or coffee and they took so long to do so always with a frown.  They appeared to dislike their job and showed it.  Every morning it seemed the staff had an issue with the head server or one another.  Some of them wouldn't hide their disenchantment with some customers.  Although they were speaking in Spanish, it was obvious, even to me, when they were talking negatively about customers who clearly didn't speak Spanish.  Eating breakfast there was unpleasant.  We found it was better for us to leave quickly and go buy coffee than to trouble the disgruntled wait staff for more coffee.  The restaurant employees clearly need training in customer service. Managing employees does not mean being a dictator it means bringing out the best of those under you.  Clearly the restaurant manager is not doing that.  

We ordered room service our last night and that was decent.  Hotel is in a good location and not crowded with foot traffic. Hotel is better than average but less than very good. Could use some minor tweaks to make it better.",4,2013,08,21
19,Modern and convenient,"We had a large, beautiful room with a tiny window.  The air conditioning worked well, so the window was not a big problem.  The staff were helpful (except for a dinner recommendation to a very touristy restaurant in the Olympic Port area). Breakfast buffet was very good and the hotel's location was excellent.  The rooftop bar had a great view of the city.  The Egyptian artifacts displayed in the lobby are certainly a unique touch!",4,2013,08,18
19,Great location,"6 night stay at The Claris.
Great location , in my opinion the best part of Barcelona . Close to bus and metro stations . 2 minutes to Passage de Gracia , the Bond Street of Barcelona . About 10 minutes walk to Platia De Catalunya and Las  Ramblas. 
The hotel occupies an impressive building with a beautiful facade . There are friendly doormen at the entrance who offer advice on hotel and surrounding areas if asked and to help with luggage . The reception staff were a bit hit and miss . Some great some not so . The lobby is spotless and impressively designed . Rooms kept very clean too but I must admit ours did have a slight musty smell . The shower was hopeless though . Not powerful at all but still managed to soak the entire bathroom floor .  I loved the Egyptian theme in the entire hotel , design and use of water on the concourse . The staff at breakfast were excellent . I would stay here again if the rate was favourable ",4,2013,08,16
19,"Terrific location, nice stay here","The location of this hotel is just wonderful. We walked just about everywhere we went for dinner, and for anything farther, there are nearby metro stops. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We were given a complimentary drink up at the rooftop bar on our arrival, where we also relaxed for a bit and took some nice photos overlooking the city. Our room was nice, on the 6th floor. The rooms are decorated with a decor of old artifacts, as I believe that the hotel owner is also the owner of the Egyptian antiquities museum less than a block away. You get complimentary passes to the museum with your room keys at check in. The room was very nice, clean and modern looking. We found the decor rather interesting and different. As some others have stated here, it's a matter of taste. The hotel wi-fi was I would say decent at best but we found it satisfactory to use our smartphones to help research our travel and dining plans, etc. There is a small variety store just down from the main entrance opposite side of street where you can get huge bottle of water and other supplies for all your walking around the city for extremely cheap. We did not eat any meals in the hotel so I can't share any experience with that. There is a nice cafe right across the street called Josephine that we used for breakfast and some other nice eateries very nearby. The only thing that I can really say about it that was bothersome was that the hallways outside the rooms are hardwood floors (at least on 6th) so if a woman in high heels walks by while you're trying to sleep, you could hear it resonate through the hall right into the room from the elevator all the way til their room. This didn't really bother me and in my opinion is just a minor nitpick. If that's all I can really say about the negatives then I think we're doing ok! They also have computers down in the lobby area to use and can also print out boarding passes or other items if needed. Funny thing, they keep the giant main glass doors so sparkling clean, I almost walked right into it thinking it was open the first time we returned from walking around. After that I would slowly approach with my hand out to make sure I didn't bash my face into it and end up on some embarrassing internet fail video. You'll see when you get there. I think it speaks to the care they take to keep everything looking sharp and clean though. Overall this was a very nice stay and we would definitely not hesitate to stay there again if we ever end up there again. I can definitely recommend it.",5,2013,08,15
19,Pleasant Stay,"My wife and I stayed for four nights from 2 to 6 August this year. The staff were very attentive and pleasant. They were helpful without being intrusive. The hotel has a roof top restaurant, bar and pool. We had some cava at the bar one evening. The pool is small and like most pools, seemed to attract the same people all the time. The hotel is beautifully air conditioned as was the room we stayed in which was small (but we expected this) and clean. The Sony Brava tv had an excellent picture but is 'off-set' in the room and a little odd in it's placement. We had a view of the internal quad of the city block and as a result experienced no traffic noise. Breakfast offered a good cold choice and was self-service but one had to request toast.
Good points - location - two blocks form Goya houses, wide range of shops and restaurants and in walking distance of La Rambla and the Segrada Familia. Friendly staff, clean rooms.
Points to improve - greater range of cooked items at breakfast, ensure bills are made out correctly (we were being charged for breakfast each day despite it being included in the package - it was rectified when I produced my booking invoice).",4,2013,08,15
19,Great Hotel & Location,"Stayed for a long weekend - Without the kids!
We had a duplex room well decorated if eclectic art. Breakfast was worth the money especially if you didn't want to wait until 10 to go to a cafe.

Didn't notice any noise at all - windows well insulated and walls thick enough.

4mins walk from the station, so airport transfers painless. 10 mins from shops & great restaurants everywhere (especially if you keep of the main tourist tracks.

I would have given it 5 stars if not for the very limited seating around the small pool. Impossible to get a lounger or even a chair near the pool. But if you've come for the city not the sun then its just a minor irritation.",4,2013,08,15
19,Excellent,"Claris is situated at a great location. Spacious, nicely decorated rooms. The staff is very attentive and professional. Outstanding breakfast, aand there are plenty of great restaurants in the vicinity for dining out. Staying at this hotel was the highlight of our family trip to Barcelona. Looking forward to another visit.",5,2013,08,14
19,Lovely in everyway.,"I am a travel agent who travels to Euorpe every year. This was my first trip to Barcelona and was overwhelmed with all the hotel choices and various locations. I chose the Claris hotel after searching and was so happy with my choice. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to the Bari Gothic area and the Ramblas. It is also across the street from where you can catch a Hop On Hop Off bus which is a great way to explore this beautiful city. It is in a clean and quiet area with shopping, restaurants but yet 5 minutes walk and you are the tourist areas. I was glad I chose thie location as the hotels closer to the Ramblas and Bari Gothic were noisey and crowded with people. You can even walk to see the beautiful Gaudi's Cassa Batllo and La padres buildings. We were upgraded to a beautiful executive room which was so large and beautiful. The bathroom was massive with a large soaking tub, rain shower and even a sauna. The bed was very large and comfortable and the A/C worked very well. The style of the hotel is modern with Egyptian art which makes for its different and elegant style. 

From the minute our taxi dropped us off the doorman was there to start your welcome. Reception was amazing and they even escorted us to our room. They helped us with great choices for restaurants and sights to visit and printed out maps on how to get there.We had drinks on the rooftop terrace every night and not only enjoyed the view but the friendly staff. We decided one evening to have dinner at the rooftop restaurant and the food and service were 5 star. I will definitely return to Hotel Claris on my next visit to Barcelon and I will highly recommend it to my clients. Hope this helps with your choice of hotel for your holiday in Barcelona.",5,2013,08,11
19,"Location, Location, Location","This hotel is in the most PERFECT location. I can't lie - we booked it because it was a 5* at lower star prices. I'd say this is a 4+ star hotel. Everything is lovely, beautiful, clean, etc etc but it is missing some of the key touches you find at some of the 5* hotels in the UK.

There were some great features at the hotel - the reception area is gorgeous, electronic window shades for full darkness, large wardrobe space, large bath, great shower. The best bit of the hotel for us was the roof terrace with a pool. The perfect place to relax after a long day of walking around Barcelona! They have a great drinks menu, which is on par with 5* hotels price wise.

We were in an Executive room on the 6th floor. There was a little noise from the cars on the road and the terrace bar - but after the first evening it really didn't bother us (plus we went to bed really early that night after travelling all day)! Oh, and at the rooftop bar that night we had the best Club Sandwich and G&T!

As I said in the title, the location of this hotel is perfection! You are just off of the Passeig de Gracia - giving you access to loads of designer and high street shops, hotels, restaurants and the Metro and train station. It was also always a nice surprise to walk a few minutes and be at the Casa Battlo! You can walk to Sagrada Familia within fifteen minutes. It only 30-40 minutes to walk all the way down to La Rambla and then down to the beach. We barely had to take public transport anywhere - although when we did it was very easy to use.

Great stay for the value.",4,2013,08,08
19,Strange and substandard,"I have spent a weekend in Claris after staying in the nearby Majestic. I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Pros: the location is great, very close to Paseig de Gracia and walking distance to major attractions; the beds were comfortable; the staff was ok and tried to be welcoming. Cons: the Executive room decoration is quite bizarre – I would say ugly but it’s a matter of taste. Some people may like it but we found it cold and unappealing. We didn't like the strange artwork (my friend it gave him a nightmare). The room was dark and had a  persistent bad smell. The worst thing: it was very noisy despite of being located far from the street. Indeed, we have been offered another room, which was on the street side but that one seemed to be even noisier so we declined the offer. The bathroom was very small and not very well-designed, which make it uncomfortable. We visited the terrace on the roof but it didn’t look interesting to us so we decided to eat somewhere else. Overall I would say that Claris doesn’t meet the five star standards, I have stayed in four stars hotels in Barcelona that were better than this. I will not return and I will not recommend it to my friends.",3,2013,08,08
19,Lovely hotel and great location,"The Hotel Claris is a lovely, quaint hotel in a perfect location to easily access all of the key attractions in Barcelona. The staff was extremely helpful, responsive and service-oriented. The room was lovely with a lot of nice features you don't find in American hotels -- electronically operated double window shades for full darkness, well designed closet space, plenty of electrical outlets that were easily accessible. Would have liked more counter space in the bathroom and I will never get used to European designed showers that don't have full shower curtains to stop the water from leaking out.  All in all a great Barcelona experience!",5,2013,08,07
19,OK but not a 5 Star,"Positive Points:
-Near the centre of town and all the attractions and shopping area.
-Very comfortable beds (and I am a difficult sleeper)
-Very helpful porters, doormen, waiters, bellboys.
-Great aircon, clean rooms.

Negative Points:
-They advertise Wi-Fi which they do have but its a weak signal which doesn't work, when you complain they actually say 'Oh you can upgrade to our better connection for 10 euros per 24 hours. NO WAY!! I've never seen a 5* hotel do that. 
-Me and my friend (both male) booked twin beds, which we got, but you can't move them apart so we had to sleep in a double right next to each other! Really not cool.
-Inconsistency at the restaurant (me and my friend both ordered the same salad but one was twice the size/ some days there was soya milk at breakfast sometimes not, not what you would get at a real 5 star hotel.
-They had these young trainees on the reception desk who just did not know what was going on, did not give me a good impression, and again not 5* standard.
-Some of the reception staff have really bad attitude which I found bad too.
-I ordered a cucumber Martini and the waiter accidentally spilt a load of salt in it. He changed it but it was pure comedy.

Conclusion: If you get a good cheap deal, go for it, but don't book this for a special occasion and think it's an amazing 5*. You get what you pay for.",3,2013,08,06
19,Great Hotel at a Great Price,"We were totally satisfied with our two night stay at the Claris Hotel.  It is lovely, clean and the staff are very helpful.  We had the least expensive room and found it to be excellent: comfortable, quiet and well decorated  The location is excellent.  Simply put, a great small hotel with reasonably priced rooms.",5,2013,07,31
19,Stay away.   ,"This is NOT a 5 star luxury
Hotel. The rooms are like dungeons and the AC barely worked after we asked for help to fix it several times. Bathroom sink has no counter space for toiletries. Most of the front desk people are sweet but speak very little English. Had to put in two requests for feather pillows.  Beds are fair and but linens are not high quality that you are use to at 5 star hotels. Pool is uncovered and rooftop is too hot to use during  hot weather.  Too steep for young children and no graduated entrance to the pool. Hallways have a foul odor on some floors.   Good location  so if you get a good deal and know what to expect, go for it.  We would have left after the first day of a four day stay but we just didnt have the energy and decided to just laugh about how bad it was compared to all the other places we had stayed in Spain.   Avoid rooms 615 and 616. You can actually hear the water from the swimming pool overhead!  Furniture in room is ridiculously unfunctional and you can break your neck stepping down from the elevated bed.  The desk is unusable with the crazy high chairs provided.  Never again would we stay here when there are so many other good choices. This is the first time ever i have taken time to write a negative review!",2,2013,07,29
19,Great stop in Barcelona,"Traveled with wife, 2 children and parents from Detroit. Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, great pool. Very much enjoyed. The breakfast was terrific. we used this as our first stop before getting on a cruise ship. No complaints at all. We will return here again.",5,2013,07,27
19,Recent Visit to Claris Hotel,"My partner and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel and can say that the hotel was exceptional, the cleanliness of the place is second to none and would recommend it to any visitor. Ideal location, 10 minute walk to La Rambla and Sagrada Famillia either way. Beautiful roof top terrace to unwind after a day sightseeing. Really nice breakfast and beautiful bedrooms. Very friendly staff also. The management team are doing a top class job. We will be returning....",5,2013,07,25
19,Loved our stay at this hotel.,"Claris hotel was really chic and creative with art collections throughout the hotel. This was a welcomed change as it character to our stay. Loved that there was wifi during our stay. We also spent some time at the pool area on the roof sun baking and swimming this was so lovely to be able to just have a quick break and relax from shipping and sight seeing. The staff were really helpful from the doorman who gave me directions to a near by spa to concierge etc. I rate the service they provided. 

The location is great also, far enough from te main bvld's and busy streets so that its away from te noise but close enough walk to them. 

There is also a taxi stand accross the street which is helpful for the ride to the airport. 

I recommend this hotel!! ",5,2013,07,20
19,"Lovely Hotel, Top-Notch Staff","We stayed at the Claris for four days mid-July. We had had a miserable airline experience, were a day delayed, lost luggage, the whole bit, so the lovely Claris was the calm after the storm. Our room was tastefully done with unique artwork and beautiful hardwood flooring. Not the typical germy wall-to-wall. Loved that! The staff from the concierge on down was excellent. I wish I could remember the woman's name at the front desk who was so helpful calling the airlines trying to locate my luggage. She was determined to find an answer. I so appreciated her efforts. My bag did arrive the day before I departed.
Breakfast was good, and the manager remembered from day to day how I liked my coffee...a small touch, but nice. The rooftop bar is not to be missed. 
The hotel location is perfect; we walked everywhere.",5,2013,07,14
19,"Great hotel, fabulous staff","We stayed at the Claris for 6 days during our recent trip to Barcelona and loved this hotel! The location was fabulous, within a short walk to lots of cafes,  restaurants, shopping and some of the Gaudi sites. From the very beginning, during the booking process, I was in contact with the hotel to book tours, etc., and the staff were just wonderful throughout all of that. Biliana and Charlotte in particular, were so helpful and welcoming. We had booked two rooms as we were traveling with my nephew, and the hotel not only made sure we had rooms next to each other, but they also upgraded us. The pool on the top floor is a perfect respite to a long day of sightseeing. This is truly a gem of a hotel-- we hope to go back soon!",5,2013,07,10
19,A Gem in a great location,"Perfectly removed from the busy, crowded streets but close enough to walk to many of Barcelona's stunning attractions and fantastic resturants this sweet hotel made me smile. A personal touch, a chic design and an appreciation of Egyptian art makes this place special. Comfortable beds, organized closets and storage and easy bathrooms made traveling hassle free and boutique style. Try not to miss Cafe' Emma across the street for a delicious meal, snack, cafe', Rose', whatever.... More French than Catalan but ooh la la delish.",5,2013,07,07
19,"Great Hotel, in Great Location",We stayed for four nights and thought this was a great hotel.  The location couldn't be better.  The rooms are large especially for Europe.  The pool and bar on the room make for a great place to relax.  Hotel decor is unique and not a package hotel.,4,2013,07,05
19,Very Nice Hotel & Staff,"My wife & I were on a 2 week trip of Spain that started at The Claris Hotel for our first 4 nights. 

The entire staff were very nice & were always ready to help with directions or good places to eat. The room was beautiful but was rather small (we only sleep & shower at hotels when on vacation so the size was no issue for us). I do need to say that the bed was VERY comfortable. Breakfast is included & was your typical European breakfast buffet that most hotels offer. It has a rooftop terrace that is beautiful & has a pool & a bar/restaurant on it. Only issue we had was the way the bathroom is set up... Having a shower always seemed to flood the bathroom as there was no way of stopping the water from splashing out onto the floor because the glass only went halfway across.

The Hotel is in a very central location & we were able to walk to almost all the places we wanted to see (Waterfront 45mins - Sagrada 25mins). It is also 5mins from 2 of Gaudi's other famous buildings. As well there are lots of nice cafes around so you will not go hungry.

Our room had some interesting artwork in it - A sculpture in a glass case. & The hotel actually had a small Egyptian Museum set up on the 1st floor with some interesting pieces. The lobby area also has some nice sculptures. & a view of artwork in the courtyard

A great start to our vacation!!",4,2013,06,29
19,Good hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"I actually did not spend much time in the hotel expect to sleep and the bed was amazing comfortable. Very clean, helpful staff at the front desk...great service. Lovely bathroom, bath items were the best even the hair products were excellent. I did hear a wee bit of noise from next door but not enough to ask to be moved, the opening and closing of a door and water from their shower or bath running, but I fell asleep quickly.",5,2013,06,28
19,"Great staff, small rooms but superb rooftop terrace and poolside",Arranged a corporate event for 20 people at the hotel and the staff were amazing both before and during our stay. Rooms were smaller than I had expected (like most major city hotels) and slightly faded but the rooftop pool and bar area more than made up for this - it was stylish and modern and it was an absolute treat to return to at the end of the day and into the night (generous cocktail measures). Breakfast was very good but I would agree with the comment that the rooms at the front suffered from lots of road noise. If you're a light sleeper request a room at the back. I would stay here again if I returned to Barcelona.,4,2013,06,28
19,Nice but noisy,"The location was a little further away from the old city center than I expected.  But not far from good cafes and restaurants.  Most of the staff spoke pretty good English.  Hooked us up with local city tours that were really good value.  Did not eat in restaurant.  Menu a little too exotic and expensive.  Rooms were nice, funky decor. The shower/tub is tall and bit clumsy to get in and out of.  A little noisy from street and not much insulation.  Having electric window shades was nice at night.  Breakfast was included, pretty good variety.",4,2013,06,27
19,Great hotel to suit it's surroundings,"Staff is very welcoming, and understanding. Some try hard to speak english een though they are not confident in it.
The hotel is quite convenient, located in the heart of Barcelona close to many tourist attractions.
The environment is very calm, inviting, luxurious but laid back at the same time.

This hotel offers free wifi to it's guests, it's quite fast so long as you have a strong connection (in the reception and common areas). Coverage in the rooms range from fair to non-existent.

The elevators are a little small, so you may feel you need to take turns with other guests sometimes. 
The doorbell is quite unpleasant. It sounds like a buzzer from a basketball game, very urgent and not very fitting with the rest the hotel experience.

I recommend it to older travellers 30+yrs old who are willing to spend towards the mid to high end range during their visit, as they will enjoy this place the most.",5,2013,06,24
19,"Clairis Hotel, Barcelona","The staff at the Claris hotel was quite good. The hotel rooftop pool and bar were a treat. The room was fine but BEWARE-the shower/tub is awkward and quite dangerous to get in and out of.  There is nothing to hold on to when entering or exiting the tub.  We had to move rooms because of a noise issue and the tub and sinks in both rooms drained very slowly.  Worst Internet connection and accessibility that we've had in all our travel, worldwide.",3,2013,06,22
19,Great Staff and Great Roof Top Pool.,"The location of the hotel is amazing since it only a few blocks away from La Pedrera and Casa Batllo as well as the Plaza Catalunya and La Rambla. The hotel staff was very helpful and we totally loved the rooms. The bathroom was modern with good amenities. We walked around quiet a bit and didn't really have too much problems since the staff guided us well. The hotel isn't very far from the main station either. But what really makes your day is the roof top pool and the pool side restaurant. The hotel can however look at improving its breakfast spread and quality of its food. But all in all a nice place to stay. If we every return to Barcelona we are definitely going to stay at the Claris again. 

Cheers,
Priyanka",4,2013,06,20
19,Roof terrace and pool give it the high ranking,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. We chose the Claris Hotel because of the roof terrace and we were very happy with that choice. It´s a perfect spot after a day shopping, sightseeing or for a drink after dinner. They close at 02.00.
There is also a very small pool for those who would like to go for a swim.

The room we had was a very small duplex (2 floors). To be honest we didn´t even use the second floor where there was a couch and tv.

The down part is that breakfast was very expensive (25 Euro per person) so we went to a nearby caffe were we had breakfast for two for around 5 Euro per person.

They also forgot the turn down service the second night, wish we got our first night.",4,2013,06,20
19,No complaints. You get what you pay for.,"The Claris Hotel is nothing special. Decor is modern and formal but lack personality. I got the feeling this very much the businessman's hotel. 

The shower over the bath wasn't great. It was difficult to fit under the shower head. 

My room was comfortable but because it faced into the hotel lobby it was quite dark. I felt slightly claustrophobic in the room. It did not have a nice open feeling. If you want to sleep late though the rooms are very, very dark if the curtains are pulled. 

The roof terrace and pool are fantastic. So this is a nice option for the summer. 

The continental breakfast was good with a nice selection. The hot breakfast was less so.

In the end you get what you pay for. My stay was comfortable and I had no complaints but it wasn't specifically very memorable. It is a smart hotel with all the amenities and services you will expect in it's price class. If you are after a unique experience then this is not the hotel for you.",4,2013,06,20
19,5-star service,"We loved this hotel. Yes, it's modern, but with beautiful classic ""bones."" Rooms are spacious with great storage areas and somewhat secret compartments. My husband and I spent a frightening hour thinking our carryalls were stolen, only to be uncovered behind sliding closet doors. But seriously, the rooms are quite stunning. Beware the junior suite! It features a step quite near the edge of the bed, so should you take a bathroom break in the middle of the night, make sure you leave a light on! And speaking of lights, a little more intensity in the bathroom would help in makeup application.
Now for the service...simply superb! And kudos goes to this trio: Maria (Asst. Mgr.), Cesar and Rinaldo. They were exceptionally welcoming, helpful and so professional. 
Bravo!!!",5,2013,06,18
19,Hotel Claris Barcelona,"The Claris is a very nice boutique hotel well located in the Eixample district of Barcelona two blocks from La Pedrera and Casa Batllo, two blocks from Pg de Gracia metro station and one block from the entrance to the ADIF train to both Sants Railway Station and Barcelona Airport.  The public areas are well-designed and the front desk staff is polite and helpful.
The rooms are individual in style and filled with all the amenities one would expect in this type of hotel.  My junior suite had a bedroom and separate living area, was very comfortable and is highly recommended.  A friend had a junior suite that was one large bedroom with a storage area and bathroom just behind the bedroom itself, but open to the bedroom on two sides.  It was significantly smaller in size, but had far more light coming in from the windows than I was able to get.  He had good wifi service while I barely had any. I would rate his room as very good but not exceptional.
Overall I give this hotel at strong Very Good rating given its location, amenities and comfort.  I would advise potential guests to visually check their room before accepting it, as each is simply too individual to provide a blanket statement that covers all of them.  In addition, while it is well suited to exploring the Gaudi sights of Barcelona, this hotel is a good walk from Las Ramblas and if you expect to spend most of your time there you may want to check out hotels that are closer to it, though the trade off is more noise, petty street crime and longer luggage hauls if traveling by plane or train.",4,2013,06,18
19,Roof top pool,"Great location, chill at the roof top pool, friendly and helpful staff, and a large room with a good bed. Book through their own website (best price). Only negative to come up with is that the maids where a bit eager and the iPod/iPhone docking station was more than difficult. All in all a brilliant stay. We did not try the roof top restaurant.",5,2013,06,18
19,Nice boutique hotel but there is much better in Barcelona,"The hotel is nice and modern in a nice building with a nice rooftop area. We stayed in a junior suite room which wasn't great for the money paid. It had nice interior design but in effect was two separate rooms and everything was very dark. The bathroom was fine with a massive shower head but the water goes everywhere. The free wifi worked only in one part, ie. the entrance room not bed room. The worst part was the noise. We asked for quiet room and we were not facing Main Street but there was renovation works or something going on for the three days we were there that was unbearably loud with drilling noises what sounded like drilling into the wall next to us. When we asked reception they said nothing can be done as it is not their building and it stops out of hours but the walls are very thin and it meant one couldn't have a rest in the afternoon. The place is modern and clean but we also stayed at the Omm Hotel in Barcelona which far surpassed this one.",4,2013,06,16
19,Affordable Luxury - loved it!,"After 3 nights in a 4* hotel in the Raval district we decided to treat ourselves to a night of luxury at the Claris - we were not disappointed.  From the moment we stepped out of the cab the service and ambience was excellent.  The doorman, reception staff and porter were very efficient and hospitable.  The foyer is an oasis of calm and well designed with great art.  Each room has its own pre-Columbian art work and guests are invited to enjoy the Egyptian museum free.

What the pool/bar/restaurant lacks in views makes up with great service! We spent a few hours enjoying bellinis by the pool and never had to chase staff for a fresh drink.  It was a shame we could not order coffee from the pool/bar area in the morning.

The hotel offered 25% discount at the restaurant, which was great as we ordered the pricey degustation menu for supper.  The restaurant manager was a little arrogant, however the rest of the staff were helpful and friendly.  A mix up with another table's menu meant that we received an extra dish (foie gras) on the house.

There is not much too see in the streets around the hotel, however there is a lovely local produce market nearby.  It is only a block away from the passeig de Gracia where you can find two examples of Gaudi's work.

Well designed rooms; great toiletries; we really enjoyed our stay here.  The hotel is very reasonably priced for 5* luxury.",5,2013,06,15
19,Claris Barcelona,We have stayed there several time. It is modernizmo stye. Spacious rooms. Very clean  there is a roof top pool and lounge. Location is near the Majestic. It is a great place to stay. Only problem is the bathrooms are so modernistic as they are bizarre. Their price is reasonable a true 5 star. ,5,2013,06,12
19,"Hotel Claris, Barcelona","We spent one week at the Hotel Claris from May 18, 2013.   The hotel was everything we expected, centrally located, clean, good facilities, roof top pool and bar.   The front desk staff were always helpful as well as the door man.  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a decent size for Europe.   Definitely a good choice.

The only less then great experience was the bartender in the bar/lounge was grumpy and didn't speak English very well and the staff on the roof top bar and restaurant were not very friendly either.  We were with another couple and didn't experience this with any other restaurant and bar in Barcelona so not sure why some of the staff seem to be unhappy at the Claris.

All in all would recommend the Hotel Claris.",5,2013,06,11
19,Claris Hotel reasonably priced luxury and location in Barcelona,"This was our 3rd time to stay at the hotel. Obviously a fan? Location is close enough to La Rambla, shopping, and Gaudi buildings downtown, museums, Oldtown (Gotica) abd a wide range of restaurants to be a great choice. The rooms arte modern with a very ""artsy"" flair and many contain unusual works of art on display. The breakfast room and food is WELL worth the 11 Euros each day and the bar and pool on the roog (7th floor) is a must! Great cocktails always mixed right at your table with a very generous service! The room electronics are completely modern and the bathroom and toiletries are highest standards. My only caution is to avoid the 6th floor - we found it noisy late at night with people moving chairs upstairs in the bar area. The other floors and the suite we used on one occasion were perfect - esp the 2 story suites - if you can splurge it is a great room option ;-) The concierge always did a great job with recommendations and making appointments for us. Metro reasonable distance. Cabs quick to arrive.",5,2013,06,10
19,"Good location, great staff","We found the Claris staff really friendly and helpful, I thought their uniforms smart and a little zany. We loved the bar on the top floor, Mario, Julian and Daniel looked after us very well, they were very professional and friendly. The vodka and tonic with fresh raspberries and lime slipped down very nicely.
Having said that, it wasn't all plain sailing.  We are travelling for 3 months and have a lot of luggage, consequently we book larger rooms and suites in hotels. We had booked a junior suite. The first room we were shown just didn't measure up size wise....there might have been room for us but not our bags.  It was delightfully decorated but oh so dark...on the first floor looking out to a brick wall a few feet away. Reception suggested we store the bulk of our luggage...that doesn't work for me....I don't pack that way!  Take 2...we see another room again on the 1st floor, lighter but still not satisfactory.  We asked for a room on a higher floor to enjoy some natural light...no go there....by now I am thinking we will decamp and go elsewhere, however that is easier said than done, with our bags, we require a large room and car parking.  We have no access to Internet to see what else is available and have just driven 6 hours.  After more discussion we are offered a larger suite....still on the 1st floor....it was unrenovated but okay....the right size, comfortable and room for us and the bags.  However,we found the room very noisy, not from traffic noise, we could clearly hear the antics of our neighbours, it sounded as though they were dancing a flamenco at 6am one morning, also, unfortunate bathroom noises were apparent.
We should have left after 2 days but lethargy set in and we loved the rooftop bar....thanks guys!  Also, the doorman and George were lovely helpful people..along with the charming fellow on reception who recommended great tapas.  Also, even though we only went to breakfast one morning, we enjoyed it.
I guess if you travel light, had the right room and are not concerned about natural light the Claris would really suit. Sadly, for us it was lacking.",3,2013,06,10
19,Style over substance.....,"Great location& not bad value for money but not 'the real deal' - reception staff thought they were just too cool -(despite truly ugly uniforms)-concierge guys fabulous& in fairly plain polo shirts (= much better dressed)-incredibly friendly &helpful when reception are not-but hotel really lacking heart-
Rooms =style over substance- pokey&dark&absolutely no sound proofing- really poor bathrooms-water everywhere-
Recently stayed at house hotel Istanbul which was very cool - but where staff& management really cared - made all the difference-",3,2013,06,08
19,A True Gem,"Woderful hotel with charming helpful staff.
We enjoyed cocktails on the roof terrace.
Lovely large modern room.  Great value for money.
We enjoyed a lovely breakfast. It was easy to get taxis to and from the hotel.
Looking forward to our next visit. We wouldn't go anywhere else.",5,2013,06,07
19,Great Hotel,"Wonderful hotel close to all amenities including shops, metro , la rambla, museums. Only complaint is about free wifi which was very limited and a hassle to get on to. Would not download e mail on iPad . Some rooms also get noise from the passage. Breakfast is good, continental and hot breakfast served.",4,2013,06,05
19,If you like W hotels you will like Claris,"Ours was a one night stay as we were headed back to the U.S. the next day.

Claris reminded us of the W hotels.  Rooms very modern with electronic windows shades that completely black out the outdoors.  Shower takes a few minutes to figure out and the phone is somewhat awkward to hold.  Otherwise the room was fine.

The food and wine in the roof top Claris Restaurant is top notch, as is the service.  We recommend that you get reservations.

If one of your goals is to stroll or shop the high end shops you would be two blocks away.  In addition, in normal traffic you are only 20-30 minutes from the airport.

Since we had an early morning flight the staff arranged for us to get morning room service before they officially opened.  Overall we felt the Claris was a very nice place to stay",4,2013,06,04
19,Wonderful hotel experience,"Well located, beautifully maintained, fabulous staff. In the heart of Barcelona, 15 minute walk to anything, Sagrada Familia, watertfront, Picasso Musuem, restaurants. The staff was very helpful, especially Biliana. She organized anything we wanted in no time at all. Lobby and rooms very cool. Roof top restaurant, bar and pool were beautiful. Ahhh, the view. Our room abutted the apartment building next door. The second day renovation was started on the apartment with a lot of noise. We spoke with Maria Rosa, manager and were moved to a suite within the hour. We stayed an extra night we loved it so much. Highly recommended.",5,2013,06,02
19,"Wonderful hotel, great location","The hotel and rooms are gorgeous and it is very well located--central enough to walk to many sites but not right in the midst of the Old City.  The neighborhood is very elegant and there are many beautiful buildings all around.  Downside for me was that our room was quite small (by American standards!) and the gym was tiny so not conducive to working out.  Staff was wonderful and helpful.  Sleeping conditions are EXCELLENT as the neighborhood is generally quiet and there are black-out shades in the room.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.

We chose to get the 2 for 1 breakfast deal but it was still quite expensive for what was offered.  Like any buffet, if you're not going to totally stuff yourself it's not usually worth it.  There were many, many little coffee shops and restaurants in the neighborhood that I would have like to try instead.  But of course it's nice to have breakfast in your hotel before you set out on your day and not worry about finding a place.",4,2013,05,31
19,Fantastic Property,"This hotel was suggested to me by my travel agent. Usually I just find my own hotels---but this was such a treat!!! Everything about the property is wonderful---great location, friendly staff, beautifully appointed rooms, a rooftop bar with a great view. I would hope to stay here again and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel!!!",5,2013,05,30
19,Good Choice,"My wife and I stayed 5 nites in May 2013.  We had obtained reservations here because our friends were staying at the Claris, but we were pleased with their choice.
First the building itself is interesting.  The facade is an older building, but it has been totally gutted and behind it is a very new, upscale, almost trendy hotel.  You can only see what it is really like by noticing the top of the building where the new part sticks out from the old facade.
As others have noted, it is well located.  It is a short stroll to Passeig de Gracia and the metro stop, allowing easy access to all of the city.  What is more, the neighborhood is very nice, and worth exploring on its on, not just the nearby Gaudi buildings, but the shops, restaurants, and the neighborhood market were worth spending a day visiting.  We had a lot of fun in places that certainly were not in our guide book, and looking at architecture that was likewise not mentioned anywhere or famous but was worthwhile.
Our room was more than satisfactory and pretty roomy by European standards.  It had no view to speak of; looking out over a few roof tops next door. But, the bed was comfortable, the room was clean (the maids came twice a day, as there was turn down service), had nice robes and slippers (we didn't find the slippers for a day or so as they were tucked in a drawer) and a good flat screen TV.  
There were a few nits:
1.  There was no mirror in the main room, only in the bathroom. My wife wasn't happy about that part.
2.  There was  no chair/seat for the ""desk"" in the room, only a stool that was not really useable, and the desk, had we work to do, was far too small for that purpose.  It really was simply a place to put things.  Not a concern for us, but if you are here on business consider that factor.
3.  In our friend's room, which was a bit larger, the extra square footage was really wasted, as there was an alcove by the window that was not really useable. Again, not a concern, but the architects shorted the hotel owners.   Our friends did however have a nice tub while we had to ""make do"" with only a shower.  So ask if you care about a bath vs. shower.  We, on the other hand, had a bidet in our bath room and they did not.
On the very bright side, we have rarely encountered such friendly and helpful staff, especially the conceierge.  She was very young, very fluent in English (as was everyone), and extremely patient.  They probably should give her a raise!
The pool area on the roof was very pleasant, although during our stay it was too cool and rainy to be used other than short visits for a pleasant, but not wowing, view.
I would give this hotel a look if staying in Barcelona; we would stay again.",4,2013,05,29
19,Brilliant,"Excellent stay, rooms brilliant, great location, no complaints....the assistant manager, Maria Rosa helped us with our stay and i cannot speak highly enough of her, the entire experience was first class.",5,2013,05,29
19,Nice Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"We stayed 8 nights in this hotel, great location and an easy walk from Passeig de Gracia and the Designer Shops, the Hop on Hop off Bus, the many sights of Barcelona, and numerous Restaurants and Tapas Bars nearby.  The staff where friendly, helpful and welcoming, from the reception staff, the doormen, the senior housekeeper and her staff all were only to willing to assist.  The senior/head waiter in the breakfast room provided excellent service, even remembering our likes and dislikes every day we ate there. Our room was overlooking the street however the noise from there was minimal, a small room the bed was comfortable and the bathroom very large.  The only negative would be the noise from the restuarant, bar and terrace immediatly above on the 7th floor.",4,2013,05,28
19,Just Great,"My wife and I spent 4 nights in Barcelona and chose Claris. In summary, great location central for shopping and Gaudi, 20minutes from La Rambla and centric for great restaurants. Our room was standard, but spacious. It had a comfy sitting area, mini bar, large flat screen TV and a view to the street below.

Breakfast was good with a good variety. If your choice was not on the buffet, you could ask and the staff were happy please. Dinner in the hotel is very good. Out of our four nights, we chose to eat twice in the terrace restaurant. The tasting menu is fantastic!

During the day, the terrace also has a roof top bar and swimming pool. On a warm day, this is a great place for watching the busy city and just relaxing..

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. They advised good places to eat for lunch and dinner. Also, they booked tickets for some of he sights that hoped us skip the huge queues, eg: La Sagrada Familia.

Overall, there may be better 5* hotels in Barcelona, but not as reasonably priced and in such a great location.",5,2013,05,25
19,"Beautiful hotel, 5 star","Great location, great rooms, lovely breakfast, lovely front desk staff - really helpful - doormen utterly charming. You can walk everywhere from here - bar upstairs is beautiful, lovely view across Barcelona. Close to tube trains. Rooms beautifully designed.",5,2013,05,19
19,Beautiful Hotel in great safe area!,"Stayed here only one night, in the Duplex Room, which is VERY roomy and spacious. They say it is a 5 star hotel, but to some westerners may give it 3 starts at best. Just Europe vs USA. The staff was friendly, the elevators scared me as they shut very abruptly and was a rough ride down from our third floor rooms, the rooftop terrace was beautiful but it was raining the night I stayed. This hotel is in a safe, beautiful, residential area but still within walking distance from major shopping, restaurants, and pubs. I would stay here again when travelling through Barcelona!",4,2013,05,19
19,Love this hotel!,"We had happily stayed at Villa Real in Madrid several years ago and were even more impressed with our week's stay at the Claris Hotel in Barcelona.   The location cannot be beat...an easy walk to sights and  public transport, but much quieter than other more touristy parts of city. The hotel is quite elegant, but not too large, and the staff is very helpful and personable.  Our room was spacious, comfortable and quiet, and the beds and linens were top quality  We highly recommend their daily buffet breakfast, although there are many small cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. We will definitely stay here again  and plan to try other hotels in the Derby chain.",5,2013,05,16
19,GREAT LOCATION AND STAFF,"My mother and I have stayed at several other hotels in Barcelona but decided to try Claris hotel and will stay here from now on! We arrived late from the airport and were very tired and hungry, our bags were brought to our room and the concierge called to the roof top restaurant to make a table for us. The food was good (expensive) but the service made us comfortable and happy after a long day of traveling. The entire hotel is beautifully decorated and made me feel like I was staying at a spa. Our room was beautiful with large window. We had a small seating area which was unexpected and made the room feel very cozy and comfortable. The roof pool is very nice with views of the city. We enjoyed a beautiful day in the sun with cocktails and snacks. For me the hotel is in a good location because it is not too near to the loud gothic area and the ramblas but not a far walk. It is close to many restaurants and shopping. I would highly recommend staying at the Claris hotel and wish all of my hotel experiences in Europe were like this. ",5,2013,05,14
19,Excellent,"We were lucky to get a great price on this hotel for 4 nights room only via Expedia.  We were visiting the city to celebrate my 40th birthday.  The hotel is in a great location in L'Eixample, just around the corner from Casa Batllo and Pg de Gracia.  We arrived by cab and were immediately greated by the doorman who took our bags for us and up to our room.  Reception staff were friendly, helpful and spoke great English.  We were accompanied to our room by a member of staff who explained how everything worked.  The staff were always friendly and smiling whenever we saw them.  The room was on the 6th floor and was large and comfortable with a separate ""lounge"" area.  We didn't really use the facilities of the hotel (which was a shame) apart from the terrace roof top bar.  The cocktails were fantastic but were expensive.  I have given it 5 stars however just for the experience.  My husband had ordered champagne and chocolate stawberries for my birthday but the hotel also left another bottle of wine out with a card as well.  A really lovely touch.  The staff came to the room in the evening to ""turn back"" the bed.  Just stick the Do Not Disturb sign on if you're not bothered about this, as we did after the first night.  The location of the hotel is fantastic.  Just one block from Pg de Gracia which is one of the main areas and where Gaudi's Casa Batllo is situated (a must see - see my separate review!).  There are a few cafes and bars around the immediate area of the hotel and then once on Pg de Gracia you are literally spoilt for choice!  We ate at Cafe Emma and Josephine for breakfast - both are within steps of the hotel (as opposed to the 23 euros for breakfast in the hotel).  We also ate at Cafe Emma in the evening - again see my separate review.  All in all, the hotel is a great base for sightseeing and I would not hesitate to recommend it or return again myself (provided I could get a good deal on it again).  You are also just around the corner from the city sightseeing bus stops, which we used.  La Predera is also just a short walk away.  The hotel has a cocktail andf tapas bar and a roof top terrace restaurant.  We had a drink in the bars but didn't eat there so can't comment on the food.  A really good central location.  Very happy to recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,12
19,Best Hotel Ever!,"We loved everything about this hotel.  The moment we were dropped off at the front door, the bellman was right there to get our bags and bring them to our room.  The front desk staff were very friendly, upgraded our room, and made us feel welcome.  The room was huge and the bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was big and the rainhead shower was awesome.  When we came back from a day of touring, there was a bottle of wine & sweets waiting for us, which was so nice.  We ate dinner in the restaurant on the roof, which was superb.  We ordered a few things to try with wine and it was amazing.  We had espresso & sweets downstairs the next day, and that was great as well.  The included buffet breakfast was also very good with hot & cold choices, including eggs.  This hotel was also in a great location.  We walked everywhere.  My only upsetting thing was that we could only stay one night!",5,2013,05,09
19,Fantastic location but not a 5 star luxury hotel!,"The hotel had the potential to be 5 star, but just didn't make the grade for us. The room was small, (i know its a city hotel but we paid for a superior room) there was not enough drawer space, the safe and the iPod docking station were faulty - maintenance had to come and fix it - which they did but that type of thing should have been checked in advance - the free WiFi was rubbish, very slow and kept throwing us out.

All that said, I liked the decor of both the rooms and the public spaces, warm rich golds and browns. The roof top pool and terrace were very welcoming after a days exploring. Bar prices are very high however.

Will try other hotels next visit over this one.",3,2013,05,08
19,Staff Were Great!,"Everyone in this Hotel was most helpful and made our stay very enjoyable.  Breakfast was very good. Great rooftop pool and bar, although we would have prefered better wine selections.  Did not eat dinner here.  We stayed 4 nights, everyone went out of their way to make sure  we had everything we wanted!",5,2013,05,08
19,"Location, Location, Location","We had one day and night in Barcelona after a cruise.  This hotel let us check in at 9AM with no extra charge.  The location was perfect. Close to restarurants, metro stops and Hop-On Hop-Off bus line.  Rooms were clean, with high end products.  Staff was very accommodating.",4,2013,05,07
19,Great Stay,"As previously said, great hotel in the heart of Barcelona. I would recommend a junior suite if budget allows, as it is quite expensive i would imagine the standard rooms to be a little on the small side.Lunch is a fantastic price of 23 Euros for 3 courses considering the ridiculous prices charged on the Ramblas. All in all a great place with friendly staff",4,2013,05,07
19,Lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"Our stay was wonderful. Because it was the first time I have booked with Small Luxury Hotels, we received a free up grade to a junior suite. Lovely room with excellent beds and wonderful decor. Location is perfect with lots of restaurants and Tapas bars in the vicinity. The front desk personnel, ALL of them, was wonderful, friendly and always willing to help. The rooftop bar was also great! Really beautiful hotel and lovely decor and the flowing water in the lobby is very soothing.
Thanx for a GREAT stay!",5,2013,04,30
19,Nice and central,"The hotel is a affordable 5* Hotel in a calm relatively calm street, 150 m from Passeig de Gracia. So really god situated to the centre. Very nice and modern architecture. Excellent quality of beds. Spectacular roof top bar & pool, unfortunately not open when we stayed there. Excellent price/value, esp. for low season period in March.",4,2013,04,27
19,Good Location,"The hotel is centrally placed allowing visits to most of the tourist sites on foot. It is also well positioned for upmarket shops and first class bars and restaurants. The front of house staff (especially assistant manager Maria) were exceptionally helpful. The bedroom (an executive room) was a little disappointing being quite small, with limited storage facilities and a dangerous step between the seating area and the bed. In summary I would say that its a good base for a visit but is expensive considering the limited amenities and compared with other  top end hotels very close by.",3,2013,04,27
19,"Comfortable, modern, pleasant",This hotel is super quiet and it's in the heart of the city. No traffic noise. Love how the heavy curtains completely block out any outside light so it's easy to get a great night's sleep in the very comfortable bed. The rooms are well appointed and the staff is out-of-their-way helpful.,5,2013,04,26
19,Simply Divine,"After discussing it for far too long, this month my best friend and I finally booked the stylish city break we had been promising ourselves… to Barcelona. Having lived and worked there in the early 90s I have a love for this cosmopolitan, awe-inspiring, quirky city that is as profound as it is eternal so imagine my sheer delight when she suggested it. 

We hopped on the eye-wateringly early, but short, Aer Lingus flight from Dublin and at 10.00am we landed at El Prat airport. While the other passengers were still surveying the arrivals hall for tourist information, we had already taken our seats on the Aerobus for the 5 euro, 30 minute journey right to the heart of Plaça Catalunya. 

We had chosen the 5 star Hotel Claris as our base for the weekend and what a base it was… Right in the heart of the Eixample, Claris is a minute’s walk from the luminous Casa Batlló, one of Gaudí’s most recognisable buildings and on the doorstep of some of the best shopping in Barcelona – the wonderful Passeig de Gràcia. 

The fairly unique style of the hotel is defined by an eclectic approach to design and, above all, the precious artwork, archaeological finds and ancient rugs found in each room and the lobby. 

Our room was light, spacious and made generous use of Brazilian rosewood panelling, which contrasted with the mix of leather, silk and chrome and we even had a Philippe Starck Louis Ghost chair! 

The staff are stylish and friendly and every single one we met over the weekend greeted us with a huge smile. Having stayed with my husband on previous occasions I was nervous in case this wouldn't live up to previous experiences - how wrong I was. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Claris and am already planning my next visit... For a city break with your hubby, your BFF or family Hotel Claris certainly ticks all the boxes!",5,2013,04,26
19,Great Location - very good hotel,"The Claris is located in Eixample, a very lovely part of Barcelona.  It is close to many restaurants within a couple of blocks walk, and is located on an intersection of two reasonably quiet streets.  We heard no street noises at all as we were facing the courtyard (which we normally like).  The room was plenty big enough, shower was excellent, and furnishings were above average.  The only drawback was that the Wi-Fi was a bit weak - they said they'd check it out.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but most 5-star hotels in BCN are not cheap.  However we found the price to be reasonable for what we got (140 Euros for a very comfortable double).",4,2013,04,24
19,Claris - Barcelona,"We've been to Barcelona 3 times and stayed at Claris each time. They are tremendously helpful and nice. The rooms are very nice (albeit a bit small - its worth it to book a duplex jr. suite), and the location could not be better.  Best of all, they have good specials on room rates and give upgrades and small extras like free cava and wine.  This is the best value for a 5 star hotel in Barcelona. However, note that breakfast is not included in the price of the room, and the 20 euro charge per person is not worth it when there are lots of close places that are great for coffee or breakfast for less.",5,2013,04,22
19,Happy with our hotel in Barcelona,"Just returned from our family vacation in Barcelona, Spain, where we stayed at Claris Hotel on Pau Claris.  5 start hotel lives to its rating.  Rooms are super comfortable and modern, staff is very helpful.  The highlight of the hotel is an outside pool on the roofdeck along with a bar and an excellent restaurant.  You can have a swim, then a drink, then dinner, then a cigar and a coffee all outside and in the comfort of your hotel.  Location is excellent!",5,2013,04,20
19,Nice hotel,Great location!  Nice hotel. Very small rooms. Nice decor. Service ok. Small boutique hotel. Room long and narrow.  Couldn't even see TV from bed. Very modern. Breakfast buffet included with our room was ok.  Understaffed for waitstaff for breakfast. ,4,2013,04,16
19,Great location,"Close to the Gaudi houses, Sagrada Familia and the train to the airport.  Friendly staff. Every room is different so if you don't like the first one offered ask for another. I stayed in a duplex, the extra space is nice if you are going to be there more than a day or two.",4,2013,04,15
19,Very nice hotel at the heart of Barcelona city,"During our stay at the hotel, everything are excellent. Thank you so much for all the services and your hosbitality.
We suggest to  all the new guests to stay in this hotel if they will visit Barcelona city.
Hande and Omer Guntas",5,2013,04,15
19,Chill Break,"We stayed for an extended Easter break spanning 7 nights.  We arrived early before our room was ready and offered a temporary room to freshen up.  The front desk manager, Ricardo was very courteous and helpful. One of the reception staff was a bit abrasive but he was quickly isolated by the others who were very accommodating and pleasant.  The ambiance is friendly and cultured.  The room was comfortable and the pillows soft and supporting.  We slept well during the stay with no intrusive noise.  The hotel location is great and within walking distance of the most popular tourist sites.  It is also in a good area and no concerns about safety / security.  The breakfast is a great start to the day with a fusion of Continental, Spanish hams and English cooked.  Great views from the roof and nice swimming pool but would need to be heated at this time of year.  Overall a good choice for our Easter chill break and a fantastic city.",5,2013,04,14
19,Boutique and a great location,"This hotel is really well located if you want to see the sights and go shopping in the heart of Barcelona. Its also really close to Gracia station on the metro so you can get around really easily The service was welcoming ,friendly and helpful when it came to restaurant recommendations ,tickets to the Nou Camp etc 
I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel for a short break in this wonderful city.",4,2013,04,10
19,Good but not Gran Luxe,"I first stayed in the Claris about 10 years ago, when it was very chic and shiny, but I'm afraid that in certain areas some of the gloss has worn a bit thin. As a group we comprised two couples, and our room was adequate, although the rug was tired, as was the bedspread. Our friends, on the other hand, complained about their duplex apartment, and rightly so. The decor was tired, dirty, and oppressive, the rug was frayed, and the overall planning of the room showed a complete lack of attention to detail - which 5* Gran Luxe does not position a TV either opposite the bed or a sofa?!
The staff and the service remain excellent and attentive, and there is a refreshing ""can-do"" attitude to all requests.
The reception area is spacious and has a pleasant colour palette, and the roof terrace is one of the better ones in Barcelona. That rooftop restaurant should be completely re-thought. The decor is SO dated.
All in all our trip was enjoyable, but I did not feel any ""wow"" factor at this hotel anymore, and that is a shame given that the staff work so hard to make the clientele comfortable - time to invest in your infrastructure Derby Hotel Group!!",4,2013,04,09
19,"Chic, modern and great location","My husband, 12 year old daughter and I stayed at the Claris recently and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. Our room was modern and chic with interesting asian/egyptian inspired decor, the bed was extremely comfortable and it had a gorgeous, generous bathroom. My husband and daughter enjoyed the rooftop pool (though it would of been nice if the pool was heated) and sauna. I appreciated the central location , within walking distance of Antoni Gaudi's Casa Batllo, Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia. Lots of great restaurants and shopping close by as well as the famous Rambla. The staff was very friendly and were very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.",5,2013,04,08
19,Good location and pleasant boutique hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights in early March and found the location handy for most attractions in Barcelona. the rooftop is small but lovely views and pleasant in the spring sunshine. Staff at the door and reception were welcoming and helpful. I agree breakfast is OK rather than fab but no real complaints. Eixample is a lovely area to wander round with plenty of shops, and bars and restaurants. It’s also handy for the Gaudi buildings on passiege de gracia, which is one of the main thoroughfares and shopping areas of the city. La Rambla is within walking distance and the museums are 5 minutes away.  There are metro stations nearby if you want to go further afield and if you are arriving from the airport, save the taxi fare and get the train as it is only about 6 mins walk from passiege de gracia train station. If you want to see more of the city get down to Barcelonetta (great tapas bars) and stroll along the beachfront, and La Sagrada Familia is a must see. We got the underground over but walked back (is a 15 minute) past lovely architecture and shops including a lovely flower and food market ( carrer Valencia) which is one block south of the sagrada and takes you right back to the hotel",4,2013,04,08
19,"Beautiful, central, lovely atmosphere","The Claris is a beautiful art hotel, with its own Egyptian art exhibition and pieces of art inside the room.  Modern design, essential but warm, care of details, make of Claris a  luxury, distinctive hotel in Barcelona, only a short walk from the busy Placa de Catalunya, the heart of the city,  just a minute from Passeig de Gracia for shopping and very close to Rambla for restaurants and cafes. The room was nice, comfortable bed, breakfast was very good, I would love to go back also for the friendly and nice staff. A lovely atmosphere and great, soft perfume in the hall !!",4,2013,04,06
19,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Barcelona at the Claris Hotel, in fact so much that we came back for another stay! It is centrally located, beautifully decorated and the rooms were quite comfortable. A very enjoyable experience!",4,2013,04,05
19,Amazing,"I love this hotel. The location is supreme. The breakfast was terrific. I would like to acknowledge Oscar and Ildefonso. The reception was not only friendly but extremely helpful. The rooms very nice and amenities, as well. This will be our number one choice for our next venture to Spain.",5,2013,04,05
19,Would recommend,"Really lovely hotel. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel at ease and welcomed. The Concierge's were both really happy helpful and cheery chaps! The décor of the hotel was amazing, water features, Egyptian art, spotless everywhere.
The rooftop terrace is a great place to unwind after a long day sightseeing.
Only thing we missed from our room was tea/coffee making facilities, we do appreciate that not all countries provide this like we get as standard in rooms in the UK. Location excellent within walking distance to main attractions.",5,2013,03,25
19,"Magnifique, tres tres chic","Great location, walking distance to everywhere, clean swanky rooms, classy, staff more than helpful, roof top great for lounging (I imagine exceptional in the summer) with outdoor pool...............................",5,2013,03,19
19,Exceptional service,"We booked this hotel for our latest trip to Barcelona for 2 nights. We were very glad that we did. Service is exceptional, they are trying to please and comfort you on every possibility. Room is a little bit dark but it did not bother us. Concierge was also very helpful. Breakfast is excellent, great varieties and again very good service.",5,2013,03,19
19,"Claris Hotel ,Barcelona Spain","Stayed at the Claris for 3 days beform a cruise. Excellent hotel!!! 1/2 block from the diagonal and a short walk to La Rambla. Very close to shops, food, nightlife and all that is Barcelona....Will be my first stop on my next trip to my new favorite city..",5,2013,03,19
19,"Lovely room, good location, good service","We stayed for a weekend here in March 2013. The room was excellent. The hotel has modern design - not to everyone's taste - but the finishes and quality are very good. The facilties were excellent and the service was very attentive. It is also very well located. My criticism would be that the breakfast is ok not wonderful and the basement location, not particularly pleasant. The front desk managed to get us into the best restaurants. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,03,18
19,Smart comfortable and well located hotel,"We stayed for four nights on a city break of Barcelona in September 2012. On arrival we were immediately upgraded to a suite with had a very nice mezzanine style seating area. The hotel is smart, clean and well located for many of Barcelona's attractions, La Sagrada Familia is a 15 minute walk away. The buffet breakfast was superb with pretty much everything you could want on offer. The beds were good and the hotel was pretty quiet as our room was away from the main road. Nice little bar, restaurant and small pool on the roof.",5,2013,03,17
19,Stylish hotel but little things missing,"We booked the Claris Hotel for a nice weekend away. We had a very good deal; possibly as it is not high season yet. The location is perfect as you have only about 500m to walk from the train station coming from the airport and the same distance to the underground.
First impression when you come in is very nice and stylish. There were at least 3 people behind the reception but there was not a direct approach of any of those to welcome us. 
We had booked a standard room which was locatedon the 5th floor. Contemporary features, stylish and all you expect. Except: no hooks to hamg our winter coats which were to long for the space in the wardobe on a hanger. And more importantly: no mirror in the room, only in the bathroom. To be honest, this is the least I expect a 5* hotel to have: a full-size mirror.
We ate in the restaurant when we arrived as it was impossible to get a table on a Friday night in a restaurant in that area (you definitily have to book in advance, I recommend). The service was ok 
'ish but the food was not living up to our expectations of a 5* dining but apparently the price said differently. Overprized! The restaurant was freezing as it is possibly only used in summer. We were given the normal menu and later found out (at the lift) that there was a set menu from starter to dessert which was not even offered to us. Again, no good dining and service experience.
Breakfast was ok and very mediterranian style but you could order warm food on request. So something for everyone! 
And the ""spa"" facilities... Well, the pool was on the roof as we knew before but the ""gym"" was a joke. A small space on the roof terrace with a handful of machine cramped onto a tiny space. No way to work out. And the sauna was not working. So better dont say you have spa facilities!
All in all, I would stay here again but definitely not for the price as given on their website.",4,2013,03,11
19,Not a 5 star hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Claris for 2 nights a few days ago ! We arrived at the hotel at 1 pm and were told that check in was at 2 pm , and that there was no room available at that hour ( we were Only 1 hour in advance !!! )  I thought it very improbable and not kind , as we know so many people make check outs early in the morning! since we were coming from Vietnam and travelling for almost 20 hours it was very bad for us . The rooms are medium size and decoration , could be OK for a 4 star, never for a 5 star !! Toilletries were of un unknown brand , but the worst about them was the unpleasant smell of all of them ! body lotion was so unpleasant I could not use it. The real good thing about the hotel is location , excellent , one can walk to the Ramblas, many of Gaudis places, etc. There are lots of good restaurants around .",3,2013,03,10
19,What you can see from Claris!!,"When my husband and I walked into the hotel, nobody says ""Como estas?""  We have already stayed at Paris, Bilbao, Madrid at that time.  we found last three hotels was rather less expensive, friendly and comfortable.  Barcelona is know as a Gaudi's city.  Claris seemed a bit stuck up.  This hotel was introduce from Richard at where we stayed in Madrid.  He said "" My father was also a hotel person and he definitely recommend this hotel in Barcelona.""  He even wrote a note to the hotel to take care of us.  After we checked in, we went up to the top roof veranda, where you can see all over the city, the hill of Monjuic and the sea!!  I felt ""Gee who could ever experience this view !!"".  Eventually I found their hotel service is excellent, when my husband left his guidebook and all the flight tickets, housekeeper has reported the front Immediately, she kept it safely.  We enjoyed coffee to see the view and loved staying at CLARIS...",5,2013,02,25
19,Friendly comfortable and stylish on the doorstep of the best of Barcelona.,Comfortable accommodation with very friendly and helpful staff. The location allowed immediate access to the best of Gaudi and the Sagrada Familia. The old town is only a short distance away. Cool shopping is a stones throw away. Overall first class.,4,2013,02,24
19,Perfect choice for your Barcelona hotel.,"Hotel is comfortable, attractive, and well located for tourists and business travelers. The desk staff were truly outstanding - professional, gracious, and helpful. If only the rooftop pool had been heated!",5,2013,02,19
19,Boutique luxury off the main drag,"Hotel Claris was a great place for my wife and me to spend the week in Barcelona.  Tucked away on Carrer Pau Claris, the hotel offered convenient access to great restaurants and cafes in Eixample, shopping on Passeig de Gracia, and Gaudi houses.  The hotel was about 2 blocks from the metro, allowing for about a 7-10 minute ride into the old town (Barri Gotic and El Born).  Casa Batllo and Casa Mila were also only 5-10 minutes walking.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  A majority of the staff spoke very good English and would also indulge those travelers who wanted to practice a little broken spanish.  The doorman was great and always friendly.  Hotel Claris is a member of the small luxury hotels of the world.  It is rated a 5 star hotel but realistically more of a 4 star hotel.  We upgrade to an executive room, which gave us a little more space to relax during the evenings (20 square meters, which was pretty big for European rooms).  They seem to have a fascination with Egyptian and Mayan artifacts, as every room has an odd statue or piece of art and hotel offers free admission to the Barcelona Egyptian museum down the street.  The roof top terrace was a refreshing oasis from the busy city below, with views of the surround hills, a nice pool (too cold to swim while we were there) and plenty of couches and chairs to have afternoon coffee or a drink.  The two negatives were the cost of breakfast (25 euros/person) and the slow and often not working internet.  Who cares about food when there are two great french cafes across the street, Cafe Emma and Josephine's.  Despite these little annoyances, they are not enough to keep me from highly recommending this hotel.",4,2013,02,16
19,"Great location, excellent for touring and business","This was my first trip to Barcelona and combining touring with business and the Hotel Claris was perfect! The location of Hotel Claris couldn't have been better. It allowed us to maximize our sight seeing and enjoy the wonderful sites of Barcelona by foot during the weekend and provided an excellent business venue for hosting customers and partners during the week.  The hotel rooms were comfortable, clean and current. The entire hotel staff, from doorman to manager,  was tremendously friendly and accommodating.  The business event setup accommodated an audience of ~40 comfortably and the event planning staff ensured a top notch business experience. I'd highly recommend Hotel Claris to anyone travelling to the wonderful city of Barcelona for pleasure or business.",4,2013,02,16
19,Mind you.. The wifi is not what they claim,"I stayed here for 3 nights!! The rooms and service were pretty good. Also the breakfast was adequate. 
The hotel claims to provide free or rather complimentary wifi; however the signal in the rooms are poor. Also the complemtary service will let you access the browser only; cannot download outlook emails etc. just imagine a business traveller without outlook emails. What was I supposed to see.. Facebook!!
They asked me to take up a premium wifi service @12€ per day, if I wanted emails. Well.. I would have paid that too.. Had the policy been clear and the signal strength In the room was good !! Alas.
Also had problems with drainage etc. but all of that was attended to.. Promptly. 
Overall.. The hotel is good, rooms and service are good but sometimes good hotels just mislead you into various loops like the case with me.",3,2013,02,14
19,Wonderful place to stay!,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and we were enjoying our ride and the scenery when I noticed there was a rounded turn on our left with a doorman standing in front wearing a long coat with tails and a cap.  I was excited when I realized it was where we were staying.  It is a lovely hotel with a most helpful staff.  The rooms are very nice and roomy.  I would most definitely stay there again!
I highly recommend it!",5,2013,02,09
19,Excellent stay,"This was my third stay at the Claris in twelve months and I'll be going back on my next Barcelona trip, too. The staff are helpful and efficient and go out of their way to make the stay perfect. I'm allergic to feathers and the room is always de-feathered before arrival. The rooms themselves seem individually decorated and lack the cookie cutter feeling of big hotel chains, thank goodness. Each room I've been assigned to had a spacious bathroom with tub. The hotel pressed a pair of trousers at 10pm in under fifteen minutes. How's that for service! By the way, I'm in a hotel somewhere in the world three or four nights every week and am a picky and sometimes difficult guest.",5,2013,02,03
19,Very nice hotel with excellent location,"Arriving was a pleasure with very friendly staff. Location is in the middle of the vibrant area around Passeig de Gracia with very good restaurants in the neighborhood like Boca Grande. Don't forget to zip a drink at the swimming pool at the roof or dine in the excellent restaurant. Rooms are renovated about 1 or 2 years ago and it's done with a lot of good taste. All positive, you can't go wrong.",5,2013,01,22
19,Christmastime at the Claris,"I stay regularly in a Derby Hotel in Barcelona since there are many in the Eixample where my daughter lives and until now there has not been enough room for me to stay comfortably. I like a good-sized room where I can use my net book, a good en suite, very comfortable bed - in short a 3 or 4 star Derby - where you can take for granted that the staff will be very helpful.Thiq trip was exciting because she was moving into a large 5 bed apartment where at last there would be a room with nearby bathroom for Granny!During five days of the move I stayed in the Claris and we were both glad to fall into the bar and welcoming barman Daniel was ready to pass us two lovely glasses of white wine and to hear of fresh problems with the move!There was free wifi and a couple of free computers in the lobby where you could work and drink wine surrounded by a collection of fascinating artefacts. I loved the bed and the en suite in my room but for once I had no real desk there; I could have changed rooms but it was not important enough. You do not come to Barcelona to stay indoors or to eat hotel food. Room service food, though, was very good. Opposite the hotel is the lovely Josephine and one block down on the left, a branch of Paul, the French boulangerie, almost opposite it a delicious Italian Deli and then the wonderful market where you can eat anything,  either there or in one of its surrounding restaurants. Eat on the move in Barcelona - it's practically the point of going there. And stay at a Derby hotel  - if you don't like your room they will change it. Claris is very good value at Christmas but remember that rates vary according to season. Also, a five star in Barcelona will not necessarily be the equivalent of one elsewhere - in Scotland , for example -  in terms of rooms or facilities.",4,2013,01,16
19,Modern luxury,"First of all I personally think that it is better to stay in Barcelona in the Eixample area where Claris is located than very crowded and touristic Barrio Gothic/La Rambla area. Surely you want to stroll down La Rabla if that's your first visit to Barna... but keep your eyes open and head up.

So as the other reviewers say location is great, walking distance from metro, some major Gaudi buldings, designer shopping, bars, restaurants etc.

The hotel is very good but I think it is lacking personal touch or the extra mile hence I rated this 4 not 5. 

Interior is modern with ancient twist, everything works as expected, breakfast was tasty with good selection of local ham, chorizo, fruits. Also the standard filter cofee was very good. Rooftop pool and lounge was also cool (and a bit on the pricey side) and I guess during warm summer nights is will be packed with 30+ wealthy locals.

Tip. Do take the hotel car for the airport transfers, at least for me it was affered at 35 euros which was cheaper than taxi.",4,2013,01,08
19,great location,"We stayed at the hotel in October. The location is great  and within walking distance of most sights. The staff was extremely helpful. The only drawback was the lack of wifi in the rooms.  The hotel only had 2 computers in the lobby and one was down most of the time. This was especially difficult. Due to hurricane Sandy we had to stay at the hotel for an extra 3 days and needed to be in touch with home and the airlines.  The staff was wonderful and did give us free internet access in our rooms b Unfortunately  it was extremely slow. The hotel needs to upgrade its internet access
There are many good places for breakfast nearbye.",4,2013,01,05
19,great value,"I stayed here for two nights for my first visit in Barcelona. I loved the hotel's location. It's in a walking distance to all the major attractions, yet it's also somewhat off the main tourist hub and therefore you will not bump into hordes of tourists. It's a stylish hotel (I loved the Egyptian ancient statute in my room) and you will get good value for your money. 
One star down for the roof-top service. It was quite slow, probably because I unintentionally showed up close to the closing time (?).But it's a great roof top area for enjoying your morning cup of coffee while observing the city-life down below.
I'm planning my next trip to Barcelona and am thinking to stay here again.",4,2013,01,02
19,Walk to everything!,"Great location of this hotel in central Barcelona... the streets nearby are alive and you could spend days just walking around taking in all the shops and eateries... we did!  This would be a botique hotel by North American standards, but it really has good bones that only Europe could offer, and made for a great introduction as our starting point of our European vacation.

Highlights: excellent western style breakfast buffet, great evening parties on the hotel roof/bar and easy walking to enjoy Barcelona and all it has to offer.

Coming from 12 time zones away (Hawaii) we did have quite a bit of adjusting to do, but fortunately, we were awake early, ready for a nap during siesta time, and awake by 10PM, just in time for prime time dinner time!

This hotel has got the basics, just what you need with a business center/computer area in the lobby (with cameras for Skyping loved ones) as well as a friendly staff and doormen.

Oh- one complaint we had, the rooms are a good size- not too big, but just right for a couple- with a large bathroom, and the motorized blinds were nice... EXCEPT... for some reason the maids just loved opening the one in the bathroom (there was a giant window in our bathroom) and every day, of course, we would modestly close the motorized blind (which was a nice touch, but seemed to take an eternal 45 seconds or so) and every day after maid service it would be back up again... we couldn't understand why the maid couldn't take the hint and just leave the window blinds closed in the bathroom, but alas, they did.  There was a nice view out to the street of course, but I'm guessing there was probably a nice view in as well if we left the blind up...

Otherwise, great hotel, great location and great value!",4,2012,12,27
19,Lovely hotel and friendly staff.,"We stayed in the Claris hotel for a long weekend just before christmas. 
When we arrived the reception staff were welcoming and immediately we felt at ease. 
We were shown to our room which was comfortable and clean and adequate. By night 3 we were moved rooms due to the air conditioning not working and the 2nd room we were given was 100 times better than our original room! the bathroom was amazing with whirlpool bath and an amazing separate shower and double sink. The only downside of this room was the view was a brick wall! But we spent minimal time in our room so the view was not that important. 
Breakfast was plentiful and replenished regularly. Nothing was too much trouble. We could have iberico ham or salmon or fresh fruit and pastries, all the other usuals, omelette, scrambled egg etc.. everything was fresh and very tasty. 
We ate upstairs in the terrace restaurant once because my husband wanted to try the 1kilo of rib of beef. He was happy with the meal and the meat was tasty but not quite the mountain of meat he was expecting! The staff were friendly and attentive. The wine list was great and not ridiculously over priced. 
We spoke to hotel services/consierge for advice on where to go and were given lots of helpful advice and guidance, along with where to go we were also advised where not to go! 
We loved the hotel and all the staff and would definately return to this hotel and the fabulous city of Barcelona.",4,2012,12,21
19,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed in the Claris Hotel for a long weekend to celebrate a special birthday.  This hotel is in an excellent location and we were really pleased with our room.  Everything you could need with some little extra bits and bobs you may find handy, cotton wool, tissues, nail file and the usual toiletries. Reception and door staff could not be more helpful.

Our first two nights were in room 611 on 6th floor which was lovely, only problem we ended up with a sleepless night on the second as there was some strange banging going on all night.  At first we laughed about it as we thought it was just the neighbours ‘having a bit of fun’ but think not judging by the length of time it went on ;-) Anyway we mentioned it to reception and they moved us without issue to a room 509 on the 5th floor. Another lovely room, we were more than happy with (although an additional mirror in the dressing area would have been handy).

We would have liked to have had a cocktail in one of the bars but it seems we timed it badly every time and it was closed.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Claris Hotel and would recommend it to anyone.",4,2012,12,21
19,Worth a 4 stars hotel,"I stayed 2 nights at Claris Hotel in a room locatated on the 5th floor, with a view on the street.
This was my second stay and nothing has really changed since last year.
This is overall a good hotel but not worth 5 stars.
The establishment is getting ageing and a bit old fashion, especially the bathrooms which need to be refreshed. Also the air conditioning is difficult to set, heating didn't seem to work properly, the room was quite cold.
The gym centre is a joke : there are only 3 old machines and a sauna which was off ... 
The double bed is in fact 2 single beds next to each other.

The good things are :
- Central location next to passeig de Gracia
- A very good service from the room maid : rooms are checked at least twice a day
- A big room fitted with a large convenient wardrobe, a big good quality flat screen facing the bed and a kind of small living room corner with a sofa",3,2012,11,29
19,"Awesome staff, super location!","Alone in Barcelona on business. Friendliest staff in Barcelona! My cab wouldn't let me use a charge card, so the front desk paid him and just billed it to my room. Rooms were hip, clean and had modern conveniences. Turn down service with a chocolate every night, black out curtain shade, and a warm doorman. EVERYTHING is nearby....the metro, shopping, restaurants, etc. only complaint is the limited free Internet and walls were a little thinner than my liking.  I would stay here again for sure though.",4,2012,11,29
19,"Amazing hotel, fantastic service, awesome location","An autumn break for me and my cousin. We arrived early before check in and were instantly offered our room, also upgraded to a better room. Bonus! Everything spotlessly clean and always being cleaned. Interesting little sculpture in a glass box in our room. Comfortable beds and ample cupboard space with clever designs, perfect for a girls night out! Clean and large bathroom, lots of toiletries and rain shower was strong and powerful. 

Kristina at concierge was an absolute delight and helped plan our 3 day trip perfectly, suggested all the perfect sites, shopping, nights out. Even though I have been before, this trip was exceptional thanks to the Claris and its delightful staff. One downside, breakfast could have had a little more variety on the hot food, but couldn't complain too much with hot pancakes, fresh fruit, selection of yogurts and hot drinks. 

Thank you and see you soon",5,2012,11,25
19,Great hotel - Would re-book on next visit,"My husband and I were referred by a friend to Hotel Claris and I know now why he gave it such high praise. The staff (especially Kristina) were amazing and so helpful. Weeks before our arrival, Kristina the concierge had emailed us to welcome us to the hotel and arranged for restaurant reservations (and even tickets to an FC Barcelona game for the day of our arrival!)  The hotel itself is beautiful, and very calming. We had booked the Junior Suite Duplex for 7 nights and found it quite nice. There happened to be some construction above our rooms the first couple of days and when we mentioned it, the hotel staff immediately apologized and upgraded us to their large Suite on the top floor that same day (which had its own sauna in the bathroom!) - the room was beautiful. If I had one somewhat negative comment, it was that the beds are quite hard (but that may be a plus for others). But on the positive side, they have great night shutters in the bedrooms so it's quiet and dark.   The rooftop restaurant was also surprisingly good - staff and food were great.  

The location of Claris can't be beat. It's central to everything. We were able to easily walk to the old / gothic part of the city in one direction and to the Sagrada Famillia in another direction. Passeig de Gracia was one block away with shopping and the subway was also very close. 

I have never done a review on Trip Advisor, but we had such a great experience with Hotel Claris, that I wanted to share it others.  We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, and it will definitely be our go-to hotel on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2012,11,22
19,new re-furb has made a difference,"I have been staying at this hotel for more than 10 years now. the only hotel I stay at regularly for business and pleasure.  The Claris have completed the updated all rooms and made a big difference, all wooden floors are newly polished, shower/bath rooms a fully updated with new rain forest showers.  The room I had, had  oriental decor effect. A change from the Egypt feel of old.  The refurb has made a positive difference..
My friends from Australia who came with me enjoyed the stay, having a different style of room and the hotel upgraded them to a duplex room.
The pool area remains the highlight of this hotel, the staff remain attentive, and the dining expereince at La Terraza is always an enjoyable one... they will keep me coming back... and my challenge to concierge to find me a new place to drink and eat never fails",4,2012,11,19
19,Gold Star Hotel for a Silver Lining Situation,"I believe there is an adage about unexpected opportunities arrising from bad situations which certainly applies to our experience with this exceptionally warm yet avant garde hotel. We had our 10 year anniversary trip to Spain planned for quite some time, however, hailing from NJ, super-storm Sandy (and awful American Airlines) had other plans for us! Due to delays we needed to book three nights in Barcelona in a pinch and after doing a quick scan on Tripadvisor and hotels.com we booked Hotel Claris last minute. After all we had gone through to get to Spain, Hotel Claris welcomed us warmly and provided not only top level service but an excellently centralized location for our daily sight-seeing. The room was modern, clean and spacious-perfect for two weary travelers. Beds were comfortable, amenities were upscale (those little details matter to me) and we found that after adjusting some audio settings we were able to get some TV channels in English. The rooftop bar/pool La Terraza was magically romantic with breathtaking views of the beautiful city. The weather was a bit chilly but they provided us cozy blankets to keep us warm while we sipped on delicious cocktails. We were pretty much able to walk to everything (with the closest being the Casa Batllo and Pedrera) but also walkable to Sagrada Familia, La Rambla, and other main areas of interest. Cabs to the clubs on the beach/marina area were only about 5-6 euro each way on average. If I can only make one small critique it would be that WIFI was free for 90 minutes a day, but had a terrible signal and we weren't able to get online. Very small price to pay though for such a great last-minute find in this gem of a hotel. If we ever go back to Barcelona this is the place we will book (planned this time).",5,2012,11,15
19,Outstanding hotel in the centre of town,"We were greeted by an English speaking doorman after a long journey. The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful regarding luggage storage, directions, restaurant recommendations etc. There is a very good breakfast buffet. The room was large and comfortable. Excellent bathroom fittings, space, and shower. The room was also very quiet, and the bed was most comfortable, all of which made for a restful stay. I would happily stay here again.",5,2012,11,12
19,Discover the essence of Barcelona at the Claris Hotel,"Hotel Claris has one of the best locations in all of Barcelona: just a short walk from Gaudi’s La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  This chic and contemporary boutique hotel features an intriguing avant garde design, a fascinating collection of sculptures and paintings and exquisitely appointed rooms.  From the moment we entered the hotel, we felt as though we stepped into a celebration of everything that is artistic in the beautiful and vibrant city of Barcelona. And to our delight, the décor was matched by an unparalleled level of service and dining opportunities.  The hotel even has its own museum of Egyptian artifacts and paintings that is well worth visiting.",5,2012,11,04
19,Autumn getaway,"Very welcoming, great service. Location of the hotel was perfect for us, short walk to the main sites. Easy to walk everywhere but taxis are available outside the hotel and public transport is nearby.

The staff were friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast had a good selection and hot food to order. The pancakes were lovely. Great hotel all round.",5,2012,11,04
19,Small rooms but big heart.,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights.  The room was a bit small, but other than that we have no complaints.  We arrived early, cause you know those night flights!  Our room wasn't ready which we expected, but they gladly took our luggage and told us where to go for a walk.  When we came back it still wasn't ready so they sent us to the rooftop bar for a free drink.  When we finished our luggage was waiting for us in our room.  The included buffet breakfasts were great, lots of choices.  The staff were very helpful in getting us tickets for Sagrada Familia and booking an excursion to Montserrat.  They were also very helpful with tips on where to eat.  Loved the doorman!  The bar staff were very friendly and were making us custom drinks, their own home made baily's.  it was a very nice experience and we would definitely go back there.
",4,2012,11,01
19,Wonderful hotel!   Don't miss this one!,"Beautiful hotel, with top-notch service.   Everyone was so helpful, and spoke and communicated in English with ease.   Make sure you visit the rooftop pool, restaurant, bar.   We were upgraded to an executive room for no charge.    Our room was ready early when we arrived off of a cruise ship.  Couldn't ask for more!",5,2012,10,17
19,Amazing as usual,"It is the third time me and my husband stay at the Claris, and it has been better than ever. The rooms are modern and the staff is so caring. We will come back for sure. I strongly recommend the Claris. We stayed in a junior suite that even had a private sauna.",5,2012,10,14
19,Should NOT be rated a 5 star GL hotel!,"Overall our stay was disappointing.  On the positive side, the hotel is centrally located, has a small Egyptian museum on the second floor and the roof top bar is nice.  

If you are considering staying at this hotel, be forewarned - the description of the rooms on the website in no way matches what the actual room is like.  We chose a Junior Suite based on the descriptions, which turned out to be a big mistake.  Some of the amenities listed:  furnished with antiques, 2 flat screen TVs, sound proofed rooms, wireless internet access.  What we had: very dark room space, (one window looked into a small courtyard which allowed no light into the room), one flat screen TV in the living room, one small TV located high on a shelf in the bedroom closet that didn't even have a TV signal feed, no antiques (perhaps the bedroom TV was that), wireless internet signals that seldom extended into the bedroom, an adjoining door that resulted in us hearing nearly every word our neighbors said.  Not even close to what was described.  

We shared our disappointment with management who at first told us that they can't put a picture of every room on the website.  Our problem wasn't with the picture, it was with the words Claris Hotel used to describe what they offer for a Junior Suite.  We were offered a discount off the price of the room, but honestly, even with the discount, we paid a lot of money for substandard accommodations.  I am very sure that you can find a better value for the money - keep looking.",2,2012,10,14
19,"""Amazing""","I spent the weekend here with the Stowells wine company and have to say this hotel is amazing. From the rooftop pool to the late night whisky selection in the bar. I can't fault it one little bit. 
The views of the city were superb. The room was fantastic (including the complimentary bottle of red wine).
Very close to everything I wanted to see and do and with no lack of top quality restaurants surrounding it. 
The architecture of the area is jaw dropping and I did find myself occasionally just staring at buildings.
Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2012,10,12
19,Over priced,"All TV  is in spanish  the only  english TV  is CNN and BBC with very bad reception 

They charge the full amount before you arrive without telling you

waiters at the rooftop bar are very Rude

We took a duplex suite but found the upstairs living area totally usless due to the lack of space .this is clearly a converted single bed room and nothing more ",3,2012,10,04
19,Warm Welcome,My Husband and I recently return fronm our Honeymoon where we had the pleasure of staying at the Claris Hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We had our breakfast every morning at the hotel. Which had excellent food and the service was incredible. Every hotel we visited after was judge by the high standards of care that Claris bestoned upon us. If you go be sure to visit the roof top pool we spent one of our most pleasant afternoons there.,5,2012,10,03
19,Great hotel in a good location,"A hotel with a quirky feel right in the main shopping area which offers excellent accommodation and service with the minimum of fuss.  You get everything you ask for very quickly.  Breakfasts are very good with excellent service in the dining room.  Rooftop pool is lovely after a day exploring Barcelona and environs.
The bedrooms are really quirky - love them.",5,2012,09,30
19,Good and bad,"Had a great room and the complimentary wine as anniversary present was nice touch. The rooms are however not very soundproofed as we found out when a group of noisy Americans returned to room next door in the middle of the night. We did reception and they were asked to tone it down very quickly which was good. The rooftop pool area was lovely and the barman very friendly and helpful, great drinks. The Internet is slow in the rooms and we had trouble getting on one in the lobby area. Breakfast was really nice, lots of choice and very attentive staff. Checking out was a real drama though as for some reason none of our credit cards were accepted by the hotel machine ( they worked every where else before and after this so NOT our card, was operator error but he refused to admit this or do a manual or sign credit card payment ). We were forced to go to ATM to get money out of each of our accounts to pay in cash, very frustrating. This rather took the gloss off our stay.",3,2012,09,27
19,"Great Location, Comfortable Room","Stayed here just one night before boarding our cruise ship. Location was near many interesting sights. We took advantage of the rooftop bar.
Clean, modern room. Would stay here when we return.
Our rate did not include breakfast, but there any many options in the area",4,2012,09,19
19,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"We spent four days at this very well located hotel Aug. 30-Sept. 2. The staff is extremely helpful and efficient. Rooms are lovely with one exception. There is a step up to the sleeping area. Hard to remember in middle of night and I did go flying once. Aside from that, the price is reasonable and free internet use makes this a great hotel for email-starved travelers. Would definitely go back if opportunity presents itself.",4,2012,09,19
19,More 4 stars than 5,"The first room we were taken to was on the third floor.  The window faced inward to the central atrium and being so low down the room had hardly any natural light, this coupled with the dark colour scheme made the room feel very claustrophobic.  We complained and were offered another room with on outside window on the 5th floor.  This was better but still did not have the 5 star panache.",3,2012,09,17
19,Location and more,"Spent three nights at the Clairis Hotel in Sept 2012.  The room was very nice.  The bed and bedding were great. The closet storage was just ok. The large bathroom was fine. The included breakfast was exceptional with a variety of foods and good service. The hotel is nicely appointed and has an attentive and helpful staff. Its location allowed for easy walking to many areas and to public transportation.  While not cheap, it is less costly than some of the other high end hotels in that area.",5,2012,09,16
19,Great Position,"Stayed at the Claris in May 2012.  Originally we were given a time room and thought we were accidentally show the broom cupboard.  When we spoke to the reception they moved us to a nice duplex room.

The hotel is in a perfect location for walking and taking the public transport.  We were given loads of good advice and help with getting around Barcelona.  We were helped to book our trip to Familia Sagrada.

The rooftop pool was a dream and when we were in the hotel it was great to laze around on the loungers sipping drinks and take a cooling dip in the small pool.",4,2012,09,14
19,Lovely hotel in an excellent location,"We stayed here for four nights and really liked this hotel. It is ideally located within easy walking distance of many of the sights of Barcelona. 
The hotel staff were helpful and when we had a problem with our safe they responded swiftly and professionally. 
Our room was very quiet, clean and the bed was very comfortable.
The roof terrace and pool is a real bonus.
We would certainly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2012,09,13
19,"Great Room, Better location, Best Roof Top Lounge","We stayed here for 3 nights and could not have asked for a better hotel.  The location allows you to safely and easily walk to attractions, restaurants, or tapas bars. The hotel is contemporary and modern having recently been completely and beautifully remodeled.  The rooms are spacious and quiet with ample size baths.   Richard and Kati at the front desk were always friendly, accommodating, and fluent in english!  On the 7th/top floor is a beautiful lounge with gorgeous city views and a gentle cooling breeze.  A duo, singer and acoustic guitar, played soft romantic music.   Because of the ambience, the music and our  friendly servers, Daniel and Jonathan,   we returned each night after dining out.  Make sure to have Daniel make one of his famous gin and tonics for you!  Without hesitation, upon returning to Barcelona, I would stay at the Claris again.",5,2012,09,09
19,Had a fabulous stay',"The rooms are spacious and clean and the staff was very helpful, especially the doorman.  The hotel is in a safe and upscale neighborhood and is walking distance from all the important places.  The rooftop bar and pool were wonderful amenities. Met some great travelers.  I would stay again!",5,2012,09,04
19,It is not a 5 star hotel,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights at the begining of August, 2012.  I have given the hotel a rating of three based on its excellent location and staff. I was upgraded to an executive room, those recently remodeled/refurbished/decorated, and we were very disappointed because of the very small size of the room and its uncomfortable and terrible design and distribution. Guys, there are excellent designers out there ! There is almost no space for a second suitcase, the TV set is very off to the side of the bed and there is hardly any closet space. It was very difficult to get into or out of the bathtub as it is rather high and with very little space to move around.  I repeatedly asked the hotel if any of the executive rooms were more spacious and I was told they were all the same size. Well, they are not !  I saw room 509, an executive room, two days after my check in, and it was larger. This was confirmed by the front staff after I asked them.  I have traveled through Europe extensively and this is not a 5 star GL hotel. Look around for a better deal.",3,2012,09,01
19,"Best hotel I have been in, in Barcelona","If you need a Superb location... YES! If you need quiet... YES!! If you need spacious rooms... YES!! If you need a rooftop bar and pool... YES!!! This hotel has it all, with class, style, safe, spacious and one block off the northern part of the greatest shopping street of Barcelona, Passng de Gracia. Close to Starbucks, great restaurants and fabulous shopping. Right in the heart beat... but quiet. We loved this hotel. And total black out curtains... fantastic for resting.",5,2012,08,31
19,Hotel with lovely staff and great position,"Had a great stay at Claris .  The position was fantastic, staff were very helpful and attentive.  Rooms were modern - quite dark but very clean.
Roof top pool was a bonus
 
Overall would recommend this hotel",5,2012,08,31
19,Excellent location and a very good hotel,This is a beautiful hotel that ia walking distance from the segrada Familia and the Casa Batillio.  Great location in Barcelona. The staff is terrific and very helpful.  Therooms  are comfortable and very well decorated.  The dining room breakfast was a good selection.   I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2012,08,24
19,Great Location & Rooms,"Stayed here with my partner in August 2012. The hotel is in a great location close to train stations and within walking distance to most attractions. For us a big positive was it was far enough away from La Rambla! Rooms are really high standard and very comfortable, staff very friendly and helped with restaurant recommendations and bookings. The roof top pool may be small but it is perfect for a cool down after a day's sightseeing and the roof bar is a perfect spot for a pre or post-dinner drink. One major criticism is the requirement to pay for wi-fi (other than a free first 90 minutes). A hotel of this standard should be providing wi-fi free of charge. It is also cumbersome as you have to log in with the codes every time you surf! That said, we would highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Barcelona and would have no hesitation staying again!",5,2012,08,22
19,very good hotel in a prime location,"the hotel is located in thae center of the city, 2 min wallk from passing de gracia av.
it's really a high class hotel, the room was graet and so is the service. (room clean twice a day)
free wi fi in the lobby area + 2 computers for guest use.
notice that online reservation not include tax 8% and brakefest 23 euro per person.
hotel airport service on depart is very heigh, use a texi only.",4,2012,08,22
19,Good hotel in a fantastic location,The hotel is centrally located and is a good place to stay in Summer given the rooftop pool. We thought the rooms were elegantly fitted and qute large given typical European size rooms. The staff at the pool bar are delightful and Daniel makes one of the best bloody Mary in Barcelona especialy after the long day exploring the sights. The concierge is also very helpful for restaurant and shopping tips. Billiana recommended some great restaurants and non touristy bars for us. Would recommend going straight to the concierge if requiring tips and suggestions around the city as the front desk are not as helpful. We were lucky enough to get the deputy managers help on restaurants also which ended up being our favorite place to eat in Barcelona. Agree the doorman is a gem and is always happy to greet you when you arrive and leave the hotel. An easy recommendation for future visitors of Barcelona.,5,2012,08,21
19,CLARIS - BARCELONA,"Great City and Great Hotel.

Arrived at the hotel and the concierge immediately looked after our car for us and guided us to the hotel reception. Great guy and great service straight away.

We were placed in a brilliant room on the fourth floor which was very clean, and in a fantastic condition. Spot on so far.

The hotel staff were very helpful, and were keen to offer advice on where in the city was worth a visit.

Would stay again when we return to the city.",5,2012,08,19
19,Nice Hotel,"Really good hotel staff brilliant great position,nice  pool area.you are about 5 mins walk from Passiege Gracia and 2 mins from metro cant complain,Hotel to consider when in Barcelona
there are a couple of little supermarkets near to get those little extras you may need.",5,2012,08,16
19,Would stay here again,"We spent two nights here in August. Agree with review by Al3111111 that the doorman is amazing - always smiling and helpful (despite a very hot uniform), not to mention multi-lingual. We found the front desk staff very pleasant and helpful from helping us get tickets to the Sagrada familla to helping with the wifi connection on our ipad. They gave good directions and helped us avoid ""tourist "" mistakes. The amenities are 5 star but the room wasn't, although for us it was just a place to sleep. We couldn't get a late check-out but they did keep our bags locked up for us and we spent a few hours at the pool before heading to the airport, not a problem by any stretch.",5,2012,08,15
19,Hotel Claris - A Gem of a Hotel,"5 Nights spent at the hotel, great decor in the hotel and the room, great service from the moment you enter the hotel.
did not eat at the hotel as explored the eating places in the city. All staff very friendly and helpful, were offered a late check out when requested, a gem of a hotel in Barcelona",5,2012,08,13
19,Never a 5 Star in Service,"Do not understand how can the 5 star can be so misleading. This hotel in Barcelona has a long way to reach its 5 star classification. Service in front desk not too friendly. I do must say the Door-Man is expel did and very service oriented always with a smile ?

We had 2 rooms, and they were not available until around 4:30. When given the rooms, connecting , one was not even made and had a stench of a smocking-room. we had to be given another room but not connecting. The showers gets the water flowing into the floor of the bathroom thru the bottom door.

We had a 4 pm train and therefore asked for one of the rooms for late check out, they say no",2,2012,08,12
19,A super hotel!,"The hotel was a fabulous treat - beautifully designed rooms including works of art and a huge flat screen TV, On arrival you are met by a doorman, helped by very attentive staff and provided with lots of little luxuries such as slippers, dressing gown, rooms checked twice a day with extra towels provided and sweets on pillow. A lovely very comfy bed! There is a mini bar - expensive - excellent air conditioning, electronic blackout blinds. It was for us on the 3rd floor really quiet.
the roof top pool and bar are attractive.
We did not eat at the restaurant so cannot comment on it - a lovely breakfast can be found a stroll away - cross the road, pass Josephines and a few doors along there is a simple place that does the typical Spanish choices. otherwise along the main street a very short distance away turning left you are spoilt for choice.
We would recommend Qu Qu down this road a few blocks - the one with the white tiles and posters covering the walls. What we didn't find until a while later was a parellel street behind this one with the Guadi houses - again not far - that was far quieter and had LOTS of outdoor eating on a central section of a much more peaceful street. (Basically walk from the hotel straight ahead towards the centre - when you get to the junction with the Majestic hotel cross to the far side of the street and take any of the roads off to the right which will take you to the lovely eating area.
Tip - if you go to the Picasso museum go early - it opens at 10am - or else!  
Thias was definitely the best part of Barcelona to stay in - we were so glad we booked it. We walked past others we had thought of booking and this was by far the best.",5,2012,08,09
19,Excellent centrally located hotel,"Our family of five stayed in two courtyard rooms when we recently visited Barcelona for five days. We enthusiastically recommend the hotel. The rooms were comfortable and very clean - roomy with modern bathrooms. The location could hardly be better for exploring one of our favorite cities. A 20 minute walk or less will get you to nearly every site in Barcelona - and for those that are farther out, it is a three block walk to the Metro, which we found clean, safe and very easy to use. The staff at the hotel are excellent. The rooftop pool and lounge are unique and were a nice retreat for us at the end of a day of sightseeing. As compared to other hotels of this quality, the rates are very nice. We did not have breakfast included with the rate, so at 23€ pp, we only indulged one day. It was a very nice breakfast, but we found many nice sidewalk spots close to the hotel for a coffee, juice, croissants and sandwiches for a fraction of that cost. My only true gripe, with this and plenty of other 5* properties, is being charged for wifi in the rooms...but it seems to be commonplace, so hard to complain about.",5,2012,08,06
19,Lovely hotel. Fantastic location,"Lovely hotel for a mini-break. Walking distance to many of the city sights. 
The tasting menu served on the too terrace was a real treat. The staff were friendly and professional. The room was classy, well equipped and very comfortable. 
Highly recommended. ",4,2012,08,05
19,A great contemporary hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"This is one of Barcelona's original 'designer' hotels and overall it didn't disappoint, especially as it was recommended by a number of friends. The staff and service were exceptional and the rooftop bar and pool very popular during the day and at night. The room was good with a view to the main street at the front, although on close inspection it was a little tired and in need of some refurbishment. There is some stiff competition in Barcelona now, and although we had a great stay, the Claris will need to refurbish some of its rooms to keep up. Also, wi-fi was charged at €15 for 24 hours which seemed a little excessive when wi-fi is an essential these days and the Claris is a 5 star hotel.",4,2012,07,29
19,Hotel Claris a great luxury base to explore Barca,I stayed in the Claris Hotel in June for 4 nights & cannot recommend enough. I'm a journalist who was writing an article on the hotel so you can trust my opinion! A high luxury hotel with stunning unique interior and a roof terrace that's among the best in the City. Worth booking for the rooftop pool and cocktail bar alone although I'd advise not to have a room on the top floor as the noise from the DJ on the terrace is too noisy until 2am and you won't get any sleep. I asked to be moved after the staff double booked my original room and was given a room on the 5th floor which was much quieter. One negative is that the walls are thin! Each room is decorated to a high standard and features unique artwork which is a great touch. The bathrooms are big and clean and the showers are excellent. The high spec toiletries help too! The breakfast is very good one of the best hotel breakfasts and the staff are Pleasant and friendly. The location is great for the major sites although a good 20 min walk to the beach although taxis are very cheap! All in all a great stay and I've already recommended to a friend who is staying there next month!,4,2012,07,29
19,Do not accept a room on the top floor,"Most things about this hotel were great, but do not accept a room on the top floor, unless you are a very heavy sleeper or a night owl.

The pool, restaurant and bar areas on the room terrace are tiled with a very heavilly textured non slip finish, great for those stepping out of the pool, but when combined with the tubular aluminium furniture means regular loud scraping noises through the ceilings of the rooms below. 

The staff were great, the fittings, lift, internal waterfall features are all quirky and nice.

Location is fine, esepcially for eating. Most things are within walking or Metro distance without too mich drama.  

Breakfast: in a windowless cellar. What a disappointment after the room terrace.",4,2012,07,29
19,Great Hotel,The hotel was fantastic.  The windows and doors of the hotel room were not sound proof.  It was quite noisy.  ,4,2012,07,27
19,Wonderful hotel and lovely friendly and warm staff,Myself and my new wife spent a 4 night mini moon at the hotel Claris. We both loved our room and thought the hotel was situated in a super location for exploring this wonderful city. All the staff were wonderful so polite friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great and the pool and terrace bar made for a wonderful experience. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and can't wait to return.,5,2012,07,27
19,"Rooms and rooftop great. Nice hotel, not awesome.","Cool rooms, great rooftop for hanging out, nice neighborhood. Lovely hotel but not as five star as the price. Staff not as attentive & friendly as the price would suggest. ",4,2012,07,22
19,Great choice!,"This is a lovely hotel with excellent service.  My husband had his wallet pickpocketed sometime in transit from the airport.  The hotel staff could not have been more helpful in assisting us to cancel credit cards, etc.  The service in general was very good and the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating.  The breakfast was very good if a little expensive.  The location of the hotel is excellent for seeing the sights.  I would not hesitate to return to the Claris Hotel.",5,2012,07,19
19,Better than expected...,"So had read a lot of mixed reviews about the Claris in Barcelona and was concerned about what my stay would be like. First of all, I was traveling with my sixteen year old daughter and another family with a mom and daughter. The location was great. Could walk almost anywhere. La Rambla was about a 15 minute walk. The Metro was about a 5 minute walk. Room was clean and adequate. Lots of closet and draw space for our 5 day stay. Bathroom quite nice. Blow dryer in bathroom. Will need a converter if traveling from the USA. No alarm clock in room but could call for wake up call. Staff at front desk very accomodating. Breakfast included and was adequate. Wanted to mention Alvin who was wonderful every morning at breakfast. The rooftop pool was fine for a quick dip to cool off after a long day of sightseeing. Also nice to just hang out there for a drink and take in the sights of the city. The hotel is also within walking distance to Gaudi's Casa Batllo. A must see in Barcelona. Two computers in the lobby for guest use. Sometimes hard to get on as some guests stayed on longer than necessary but usually you could get on in the very early morning or later at about 10PM. It was an easy and cheap way to keep in touch with family at home. Lots of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel as well. Some guests complained of noise but no matter what hotel you will hear other guests in hallways. Some also complainedof hard beds. The matresses were firm but that is a personal preference of mine. All in all, when you are in Barcelona there is so much to see that you are only at the hotel to sleep. I would stay at the Claris again!",5,2012,07,18
19,"Hotel getting old , time to renovation","To old , time to renovate rooms, dark rooms .  Good service , breakfast like in any other 3 stars hotel !",4,2012,07,17
19,great choice in Barcelona,"The Claris Hotel is located only a block away from the Passeig de Gracia, a block down from the Majestic Hotel and Casa Battlo by Gaudi - can't get much more convenient than that! The intersection the Claris sits on is rather quiet which is a plus, although not much in the way of views other than just a nice area of Barcelona. 
I had an executive room and I can highly recommend it. All the basics were covered, and overall a very pleasing design style with a living room area and a slight step riser to the bed area. Bedding in the room was two singles pushed together as a king, all well and good, but still only set up as a single bed every night. Also, while the overall design was pleasant, one bedspread looked a bit worn, taking away from the overall quality feel of the room. 
Breakfast is expensive, but well laid out and I particularly liked the hot dishes, including bacon or sausage, all cooked to order. Made for a pleasant start to every morning.
The lobby is very comfortable, staff excellent, and the rooftop pool, lounge, restaurant were very enjoyable, especially as a pool and lounge area (never actually ate in the restaurant, so many other choices within a couple blocks of the hotel).
The Egyptian artifacts add an interesting twist, with a beautiful statue in a case in my room that added a very exotic and stylish touch, something unexpected for a hotel stay. And the room was extremely well sound proofed, never heard a sound from outside, and double doors inside sealed off the hallway noise for absolute peace. If you are a light sleeper, as am I, then you will find this to be an absolutely perfect choice and I would give it 5 stars for you.
All in all, a great choice, and a hotel that I would happily return to again.",4,2012,07,15
19,Great!,"We stayed at the Claris twice while in Spain in July. The second time was to be in a different hotel but, after seeing it, we decided to stick with the Claris for our return. Very modern decor and the comfiest beds around! The restaurant and bar on the rooftop (7th floor) is great. Do not stay near room 608 if you can help it. That's where we were for the first night of our second stay. The restaurant is directly above it. There was constant pounding, shuffling and objects falling on the floor (my head). I called to complain at 1:20 AM and the night clerk said ""Oh, that's the restaurant. They should be closing shortly."" Well, things calmed down at 2:30. They were nice the next day and moved us down to the fifth floor. All in all, I recommend the Claris for a nicely-appointed, restful stay.",4,2012,07,14
19,Claris Hotel Barcelona,"I have been staying at the Claris for about 8 years now - it's my default hotel every time I am in Barcelona. Great design, full of fabulous artifacts, lovely rooftop terrace pool, bar and restaurant, and right in the middle of where you want to be - everywhere is a walk. I stayed in one of their nice duplex Junior Suites, which was a great layout with the office/lounges upstairs, if a little dark. Also you can't open the windows, which always annoys me, although I understand why it's done!
I spent some time in the rooftop bar and the staff up there were really lovely and friedly just as always.
However, this time I noticed that the generally friendly service with which I have always been so impressed was somewhat from the reception staff.My flight on the way out was cancelled as I was checking in, so I called and advised them - as I could not even get another flight to Barcelona that night. As it was outside their minimum cut off time, they said I had to pay for all three nights I'd booked even though I would miss the first one through no fault of my own. That was a little disappointing, but rules are rules, so I understand. 
They also need to get a few basics right in the rooms - after all these years - one of which is having a 'hot power' socket, so when you go out, remove the electricity key or turn the lights off it leaves your laptop, iPad, phone, etc. charging rather than running flat! The maids also have always had the an annoying habit of confiscating your second key if you happen to leave it in the electricity slot and go out!
The WIFI you had to pay for 24 hours at 15 Euros - a rip off as it costs the hotel nothing! You have to use those 24 hours concurrently and you can only get one device on at a time! The upload speed/bandwidth is throttled, so it took about 6 hours to upload around 450 Mb of photos from my last job for which I was on deadline - pretty poor! Also things like a box of tissues in the bathroom would be handy! 
On the day I left I had serious food poisoning and was unable to move and catch my flight back in the morning - I had to change my flight to later, and then as I became worse, i called to reception and let them know I was ill - they weren't the slightest bit interested, although I could have been dying! I asked if I could stay another night as I was ill and when I get like this I know it's really hard to travel and this was another option - they said they would call back. Nothing after an hour, so I managed to call again as I was extremely stressed by then .... and they said the hotel was full, but they would come back to me again. This gave me the determination to get out of there and get the later flight that I had changed to .. but that time it was midday and I was over the worst of getting the poisoning out of my body, just dehydrated and weak. I was pleased to be out of there .. it really felt like a different vibe this time ... so ... I think (almost sadly) time for me to find another funky, friendly cool design hotel in Barcelona - I am sure there are plenty of them!",4,2012,07,11
19,"""Grand comfort close to the attractions""","We were given a very warm welcome on arrival, and shown to our comfortable connecting Junior Suites. The rooms are pleasantly furnished, and the bathrooms modern. We ate dinner in the rooftop restaurant, which in spite of the inclement (for June) weather, was avery pleasant experience. The food was good, and they have some very good Spanish wines from the region, which they are happy to recommend to you. On our final day we passed time on the open rooftop, enjoying the sunshine, and a drink or 2. Service was good. The Claris is a short walk from the Gaudi attractions, and within 15 minutes walk of the main tourist areas leading down to the sea front.",5,2012,07,10
19,Outstandiing Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"We had the pleasure of spending three wonderful nights at the Claris Hotel in Barcelona recently.  The facility itself is beautiful and the rooms are comfortable and well-appointed.  Breakfast, which is included, is the best we've ever had at a facility like this....plenty of fresh food already prepared or you can order something cooked especially for you.  Service is impeccable.  The reception desk staff is welcoming and extremely helpful. The roof top bar and restaurant is outstanding and at night you have an unbelievable view of the city. If you want a hotel that is close to many of the city's best attraction, you would not go wrong staying here.  We will definitely return.",5,2012,07,09
19,Just alright,"I don't think this hotel deserves 5 stars, the rooms are a little old fashioned, they have the look of trying to be modern but don't really pull it off.  the covers on the bed are dark brown nylon and just look 'grubby', we immediately took them off the bed along with the matching cushions.  The bed is on an elevated level with a faux leather sofa on the 'ground', the tv is opposite the sofa and so you can't see it from the bed.  The bathroom was fine, clean and the shower worked very well.  The hotel itself was far too cold, the air conditioning was on too high and it was a real shock coming in.  The hotel wasn't at all cosy, as i said before it tries to be modern but unfortunately doesn't succeed. The bar on the 7th floor is very nice.  The one other gripe i had is that you have to pay for wifi, i forgot to ask this at the time of booking and normally just out of principle make it one of the important things when booking accommodation.  If there is no wifi i normally don't make the booking.  In fact, i stayed at the Majestic hotel last year and much preferred it, it is very close by and a lot nicer.",3,2012,07,06
19,Barcelona,Great location with very helpful and informative staff. Rooms well insulated so little street noise and well fitted out generally. Price of in house breakfast steep so go to street cafes near by. Rooftop pool and terrace lovely,4,2012,07,06
19,"Great hotel, great location","We had a great deal with last minute.com, we just got a room only deal so cant rate the restaurant.  We had a junior suite which was really nice and on two levels, all very clean and tidy.  Good helpful staff, comfortable bed.  There is a great little cafe on the opposite corner of the hotel, and its about a ten minute walk to the main part of the town and we pretty much walked everywhere.  Took the open top bus tour which allowed us to take in all the sights and hop on and off so we didnt need to pay for any other transport while we were there.  The best part of the hotel was the fabulous seventh floor rooftop bar with swimming pool.  Great for a drink last thing at night. We really enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend this hotel as the perfect location for sightseeing and quality accommodation. Our room was onthe front of the hotel and on the second floor but we had no problem with noise at all, and had a good nights sleep.",5,2012,07,06
19,"Great hotel, great location","Got a good deal with Lastminute.com. We really liked this hotel - big comfortable room, friendly service and in a really good location. Very close to Passeig de Gràcia station (50 metres) so worth using the train from the airport direct to that station to save a taxi fare.",4,2012,07,05
19,cosmopolitan hotel with great service in midst of tourist attractions,"We stayed for four nights in this comfortable hotel with a very helpful and knowledgeable staff.  They helped us change rooms, recommended and made reservations at restaurants that we found to our tastes, and reserved a rental auto.  

The location was ideal for visiting a variety of tourist attractions, either by foot, subway, or taxi.  The hotel is situated among the turn-of-the 20th century Modernista buildings and in-between Gaudi's cathedral and the old town.

The hotel's public areas and our room, all decorated in a contemporary style, were inviting, especially the roof-top bar, patio, and swimming pool. 

We chose a smaller room, quite small by U.S. standards, which was well-organized and -appointed.  The only difficulty was that we had to climb over a high side to enter and leave the shower.  The room, on an upper floor, looked onto the intersection, which made it light but a bit noisy even with the window closed.",4,2012,06,30
19,Very Disappointing,"The view from the VERY small window in our room was straight onto a brick wall, we couldn't see  anything of the outside world and as we couldn't even see any sky we hadn't a clue what the weather was like. The room was very dark and depressing and very claustrophobic and we had to have all the lights on whenever we were in it. We asked for a move but were shown an even smaller, darker room than the one we had been in, with an even smaller, darker bathroom so we decided to stick with what we were first given. A four day stayin this room actually spoiled the holiday for my friend and I. Breakfast wasn't bad for the price but the breakfast room was below ground so again dark and depressing. East 47 tapas and cocktail bar wasn't the 'hot spot' described, in fact we didn't see anybody in there. However, the doorman and lobby staff were fantastic.

The roof terrace and pool were great, it was just a shame most of the staff up there had no customer service skills whatsoever.

On the whole Hotel Claris was a 5 star disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.",2,2012,06,26
19,Central Hotel,"Quite disappointing as a member of SLH hotels. Our suite was disappointing as it was quite dark and over looked a white brick wall! The bed was comfortable but the bath was cramped and the shower within was small it needed updating as there was mould around the bath. The roof top bar, restaurant and small pool was very disappointing mainly because the service was very poor. The waiters and bar staff seemed more interested in themselves than the customers. Having stayed in several SHL hotels around the world this was the worst.",3,2012,06,23
19,Lovely hotel,"We were at the Hotel Claris for three nights.The hotel is centrally located - easy to walk to many sites and public transportation. The hotel and rooms are very pretty. Our room was on a high floor and quiet. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The rooms had good lighting.The bathtub was difficult for my mother to get in and out of, and there was a step in our room, so it wasn't ideal for an older person.The hotel description does say free wifi - but it's only for a short time.They do have two computers available off the lobby for guests' use. 

There is a lovely rooftop restaurant and bar. The staff were all very nice and helpful. They gave us great restaurant recommendations and helped us with our site-seeing questions.

A friend had recommended the hotel to us and I would also recommend it.",5,2012,06,21
19,chic and comfortable,"This is a lovely hotel, located just off of one of Barcelona's most glamourous shopping areas.  The staff is accommodating at every turn; the facilities are beautifully maintained, and the rooms are clean, modern, and very comfortable.  I had a room at the end of the hallway and it offered great space, with a sitting room separated from the sleeping area, so it was really great for giving you a work area or just somewhere to relax and unwind. Nice business center downstairs in the very handsome lobby.

Like most Spanish facilities, though, the rooms tend to be heated to a temperature far warmer than Americans are used to ... but thankfully, the hotel window opens, so once in your room, you can get a little break ... but the hallways are really toasty!  

This hotel experience definitely added to my enjoyment of Barcelona",4,2012,06,14
19,some unique touches but overall disappointing,"The lobby area and the interesting atrium with glass elevators and waterfalls provides an unusual first impression. The rooftop restaurant and bar with pool has a wonderful view.  And the integration of a small Egyptian museum into the hotel itself with original pieces of art  in some of the rooms (our room's Pre-Columbian sculpture was displayed in a cube made of security glass) adds a unique touch. We chose one of the better rooms (executive) after seeing the standard rooms and got a reasonably good deal since there were no trade fairs on that week. 

But we had issues with the street noise – only the next morning did the manager explain that the windows have to be especially locked to have the sound-proof effect we had expected - and that evidently the cleaning staff hadn't managed to do that. The breakfast wasn’t worth even the special reduced price of two-for-one. We were equally disappointed with the very small hotel bar on the ground floor (the outside bar on the roof was closed due to the unusually cold mid-February weather) with a limited offering of non-alcoholic drinks in the late evening, but at least the very friendly waiter there gave us a lot of details about the history of the hotel with its more recent staff and renovation problems.

And indeed some of the personnel didn’t seem to be very experienced or well trained. My Spanish husband voiced our problems upon checkout to the manager - she spoke excellent English to me by the way. She apologized for any inconveniences and offered us a complimentary ride in the hotel car to our next destination in Barcelona.

Part of Claris’ problem seems to be in its 5-star Deluxe status, which raised expectations that weren’t met fully. As a 4-star hotel with reasonable prices Claris wouldn’t have disappointed us as much.",3,2012,06,13
19,"Good location, average hotel","We spent a weekend with my wife in Barcelona and stayd in Claris Hotel. The price was pretty high even with the special discount (20% for 3 nights stay). 

The hotel's location is good. You can easily walk from the hotel to the old town and to the major sights. 

We stayed in the Junior Suite Duplex-room. The pictures of the room were better than the room itself. We didn't use the second floor that much so a smaller room would have been OK. The view from the room was to the back of the hotel which wasn't good (we were in the third floor).

The restaurant at the top of the hotel was very good. When compared to the overall quality of the hotel the restaurant was top quality. The drink bar in the ground floor wasn't that good. 

Service at the hotel was average. The only negative thing about the service was that during the breakfast the service was really slow even tough there weren't that many quests. 

The quality of the hotel is OK but the price is too high for this quality.",3,2012,06,11
19,Bit dated and so so service,"I booked this hotel through ""what a hotel"" which entitled me to several perks (which is why i booked through them) not one of these perks was mentioned at check in and the check in clerk wasn't overly friendly when checking us in.
When he gave me my room card it had written that breakfast was 23e, I queried this and he then did agree that breakfast was actually included in the rate. One of the other things included in my rate was a late check out but again it wasn't offered. (amongst other things)
We did  get the room upgrade to a very nice (if dated) duplex room so have no complaints about the room and to be fair when i saw the same check in guy the next day he was very helpful and friendly.
Rooftop pool is great but service wasn't. Struggled to get the waiters attention as they were all too busy have a good old gossip! Drinks were good though and the cocktails in the bar, were mixed well and by a very friendly waiter.
Breakfast was ok, but the basement room it was housed in was a tad depressing. Overall i wouldn't stay here again unless i got a mega deal as i found it a tad dated and the overall service lacking (£185 for the night)
Oh i would add the doorman was EXCELLENT and super helpful",3,2012,06,11
19,V good service,"Just back from the Claris in Barcelona.  Excellent service more than made up for the slight downside of the rooms being a little long in the tooth in design.  The service started right at reception when a slight muddle with our names led to the hotel giving us an upgrade to a duplex suite.  Room was high quality, with good beds, albeit a little 90s in style.  Highlight of the hotel is the rooftop pool area (just big enough to swim in) which also had very friendly service in the bar.  If you can get this place as a bargain (often available on good deals with flights) then definitely worth choosing.",4,2012,06,06
19,Trendy Hotel in Great Location,"We found this hotel on the internet because of its location.  It was expensive (225 euros a night), but worth it given it is only one block off the main shopping area and Gaudy house.  The hotel rooms were typical smaller European rooms.  The hotel decor is very trendy and somewhat odd.  We ate the breakfast buffet which was extremely overpriced at 25 euros a person.  We thought it was 2 for 1 and when we checked out we were informed that you needed to let them know you wanted that option upon check in.  The hotel staff had attitude and were not very helpful to us.  Our inablilty to speak Spanish didn't help the situation either.  The workout room was a complete joke.  The treadmill and elliptical were rusted and something from the 70s.  The price of the hotel was to include free internet.  However, we could never get it to work and the front desk provided no assistance.  The hotel's bar was way over priced.  There are several bars/restaurants nearby that are much better.  I will not return to this hotel on my next visit to Barcelona.",3,2012,05,31
19,Windows you can walk through.,"We took the train down from Paris and arrived late in the night and the city was quiet and warm and the cabbie drove us a dozen blocks out of the way in order to charge more, but when we arrived at the hotel we were renewed. When in Europe you grow accustomed to small 400 hundred dollar a night rooms in three hundred year old buildings. Claris Hotel is a gorgeous, sophisticated, and generous exception. Maybe I haven't travelled in Spain enough to know any better, but for the price this hotel gives abundantly. We took a huge room with an upper sitting area and a vast bathroom and windows to the balcony big enough to walk through. It was the day after New Years and lights were still strung along the architecture and burned through the night given the facade a welcoming glow. The bellman was a bit crazy, scaring us with stories of crime and lack of punishment and the dangers of strolling through the city at night. But the rest of the staff was very cordial and as compared to Paris exceptionally warm and friendly. The hotel bar and restaurant were nearly empty and thus the servers fell short of wiping the corners of our mouths as we ate and drank, they were so attentive. We found some of the finest rioja I've ever tasted on the bar menu. The water hall and sculptural elements throughout the lobby were a source of endless interest and the furnishing were of top quality. Only regret is that it wasn't warmer in order to take advantage of rooftop pool and bar scene.",4,2012,05,29
19,Cool Boutique Hotel in a fascinating city!,"Barcelona struck me from a hotel perspective as a typical European very-touristed city - hotels were generally very expensive and delivery pretty mediocre. Kind of like they know you're going to come anyway. This hotel was a good choice. Nice position, fair size room (although the split level room is great from an overall size point of view, it's a bit of a waste - you're likely to never use the upper level. I mean who's going to sit in a dark lounge watching TV while visiting this brilliant city?), try get the funny little balcony thing - better than none at all, overall pretty funky and interesting. Not cheap for what you get. The terrace pool is a winner - make sure you use it!",4,2012,05,28
19,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here in March for my Husbands Birthday. We got a room upgrade & a bottle of wine Excellent tutch. Really good location, all the staff were very helpful, loved the roof terrice. A little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for. The food was wonderful. So l would recommend this hotel if you want to have it all while in Barcelond. Thank you Hotel Claris for making it a special stay.",4,2012,05,24
19,under construction,we went during April 2012 and it was under construction. The room was fine - and the pool looked fun but it was too cold to swim. If you are looking for a good gym- this is not the best choice.,3,2012,05,23
19,Whoops,"What a disappointment. Except for the wonderful art on the reservation/concierge floor the hotel was a complete disappointment. The up-graded room was tiny. Everything that could go wrong with the plumbing did go wrong. The repair people of the hotel staff were in our room over and over. In a hotel of this ""quality"" I expect them to get it right before I get there. The doorman was quite good and very informative. Break fast was ok but over priced. Loved the water feature ouside the elevator.",2,2012,05,20
19,"Fantastic hotel, great location, service and luxury and value",I stayed here with a group of friends we were so impressed by the hotel for the price we paid it was 5* and was excellent quality and service as well as a great location - can't recommend enough would stay again!,5,2012,05,09
19,A 5 star hotel in 21stC Europe without WiFi ...,"Don't book with this hotel: the people here are not trying hard at all it seems, just turning up, doing the minimum, and taking your money. The hotel is down at heel: it could do with a make over as paint was chipped and water stains from broken plumbing on the bathroom ceiling. The pool was nice to swim in but the equipment was worn out. We asked the hotel to book us a table at a specific restaurant but they seemingly lied to us saying that the restaurant we chose was full, recommending instead a place that they obviously had a deal with: (we'll send these tired and confused suckers your way for $$$$). Overall it wasn't really bad. It just wasn't worth the large sums of money they expect travellers to hand over. 

The lack of WiFi could be seriously irritating if you are needing to do work online, make searches or make reservations. There ARE some free-to-use internet-connected computers available in the lobby but this sort of arrangement belongs to the 1990s. For the money they're charging free high speed WiFi should be available. 

Verdict: Rip Off.",2,2012,05,05
19,Stunning details at the Claris,A bargain in Barcelona [for this quality of a hotel].  Everything from the water features to the rooftop pool and La Terreza.  Highly recommend for short stay in Barcelona.,4,2012,05,01
19,Superb hotel despite smallish rooms,"I recently stayed at the Claris on a business trip to Barcelona and I found it a very charming place: the staff were friendly and professional, and the 2 main things I liked were the completely unexpected Egyptian Museum on the mezzanine floor - you feel as though you´ve had time for a little culture even if you´re on a busy schedule and have no time for sightseeing - and the rooftop pool, with its great rooftop views of this beautiful city!! The one thing that is a slight, and pardonable fault, are the standard room sizes - slightly pokey, but cosy rather than cramped. I´d certainly come back however and spend more time here.",4,2012,04,27
19,Fantastic hotel and best location,"There's no way you could improve on the location of the Claris - it's within walking distance of just about anything you could want or need in Barcelona.  And, if it's more than a walk away, you just hop on the nearby Metro.

Everything the Claris has to offer was top rate - the room, the front desk, the rooftop bar, and especially the breakfast, which was included.  I've stayed in a number of European hotels, and none of them have come close to the Claris.  If there's anything I would change it would be the overwhelming sweet vanilla scent they use in the lobby - it hits you in the nose as soon as you walk in and by the time you get to the elevator you're tasting it - yuck! A little of that goes a long way.

We arrived at 9:00 am and were told that checkin is at 3:00 p.m., but they managed to get us into a room by 11:00 a.m. - very much appreciated. I highly recommend this hotel",5,2012,04,16
19,Venerable luxury,"The Hedonist speaks.

We stayed at the Claris hotel in Barcelona. It's near, but not at the top of the luxury market and very nice. Doormen in long white coats are a welcome sight, and probably speak English  better than you do. The brilliant art in the lobby is a nod to all that is modern inside this venerable building. The rooms are large and well appointed with real art, high thread count sheets (important to a proper hedonist), electrically controlled shades for the windows, and pillows that practically sing a lullaby as they cradle you to sleep. The bathtubs are a bit short by hedonist standards, but typical European, so it's (marginally) forgivable. The staff all seemed to have our comfort in mind and did whatever was necessary to make our stay perfect. Wifi is 15€ a day per online device - outrageous and maddening, but not unique. There are free Internet hot spots at some of the cafes throughout the city. The business center has free internet, but you'll need help from the staff to print anything. They have to transfer the page you're printing to a flash drive and take it to one of their computers to print. 
Their Terrazza restaurant is excellent and the small bar by the main lobby (dedicated to Andy Warhol, of all people) has mojitos that are pretty good. (The third one is especially good,  for some reason.) Get the fourth one and some tapas at ""Josephine"" across the street. (Live jazz Thursday nights starting at 11:30.)

If you want weekend dinner reservations, make them on or before Thursday - especially at the better restaurants. The incredibly helpful hotel concierge(s) will do it for you with a smile. Most places open for dinner at 8:30;  many are closed on Sunday, making reservations more of a challenge. 

""Il Caffé di Francesco"" is the tiny coffee shop one block from the hotel where I went to wake up every day of our visit.  No i-net here, but it's laden with interesting locals, and the coffee and pastries are good, but not world class. Give it a try.

""AaBC"" is a Michelin star (2 of them!) restaurant. Hedonist foodies must go. It's way north, but worth the 20 minute cab ride. Take a high limit credit card... just sayin'.  Overheard: ""what wine goes with the woodcock and foie?"" and ""No foam? No smoke? How pedestrian!"" The food is beautiful and fun, if overpriced; the service, immaculate and not stuffy. 

A word to the wise: if you want to go to the Sagrada Familia, get your tickets at any of the ""Caixa"" ATM's (they're everywhere), or get them online. You'll avoid a very long line. At the caixa, it's easier to get them if you speak/read Spanish. They offer an English alternative, but it's difficult to maneuver through the many pages of authorization - at least it was for me. Use your ATM, or credit card with a 4 number pin. Ticketmaster(!?!?) will issue the tickets directly from the machine. If you want the audio tour (recommended), buy it then to save another long line. 
When you arrive,  it can be a bit difficult to tell where to go. If you already have a ticket, get into the line farthest to your right as you face the entrance to the Basilica (nearest the info booth). Everyone has internet, so this line is also not short. The audio units are in a kiosk to the far right behind the little school building after you're inside the grounds. Long lines, but worth the wait. Several times a day, they also offer large group guided tours - not a proper hedonist choice (unwashed masses and all that), but it's there if you want it. Be prepared to say, ""Wow!"" Gasps abound. There is something amazing and beautiful at every turn. 
In the Basilica, there are seats for a thousand voice choir surrounding the chancellory, with four pipe organs planned (one installed so far). I suspect the music at the first mass will be amazing when construction is finished in the middle of the century.  I'm sorry I won't live that long. My invitation would probably be lost in the mail anyway, assuming there will still be such a thing as mail. ",5,2012,04,16
19,A good place to stay in Barcelona,"This is a place we feel very comfortable in recommending. We got upgraded to an executive suite and found it roomy and comfortable.  The staff was most helpful and responsive, and the location was in walking distance for most sites, yet in a quiet area.",4,2012,04,15
19,"Very noisy, disappointing",We booked the suite but the bedroom area is small and cramped. We were moved to a junior suite on the ground floor which is very noisy 24/7. The staff were really not very helpful. We moved out after just one night.,2,2012,04,15
19,Elegant hotel well located,"Enjoyed a superb short break staying at Claris. Room was fine, and public areas very elegant. Especially liked rooftop terrace restaurant. Location is great in smart area close to many good restaurants, and walkable to Sagrada and Ramblas.",4,2012,04,13
19,Excellent & Perfect Location!,"This hotel is one street off of the main street, which is perfect: it provides quiet and quaint surroundings, but it's also just 2 mins. away from the hustle and bustle.  It's spotless -- both the public spaces and the rooms -- and we never wanted for anything in our room: everything was provided for and a quick call to the front desk granted us any add'l requests.  
The layout of the property is pretty cool -- a spacious entry lobby with a business center and a bar, an easily accessible reception area, light and spacious floors, a roof terrace with a gym, pool, cocktail area, and restaurant, and a basement floor with conference rooms where breakfast was served in the mornings.
Everyone was friendly and helpful and prompt.  I've stayed in so many hotels where you had to call two or three times to follow up on a blanket you requested 30 mins. ago or an early morning coffee that you ordered the night before -- but not here.  Not one things was forgotten or overlooked.
We chose this hotel for another reason: the bathrooms were actual separate rooms, like in American hotels.  Many hotels we looked at had no door to the sink and shower area; only the toilet room was closed off.  We were not sorry we did that.  The bathroom was spacious and the products were great!
A couple of challenges: the rooms are a little dated and needs some updating.  We had a great duplex and it was spacious, but it was a little worn but not a big deal.  The bigger challenge was the internet: it wasn't free so you had to call the front desk everyday to request a code, and someone would bring up a card to your room with that code.  I wish they would've just made it complimentary or tacked it onto the daily rate.
There was a restaurant across the street called Josephine, and it was picture-postcard charming.  We ate a lighte breakfast there almost everyday, and they also opened for lunch, dinner, and cocktail hours both in the afternoon and late into the evening and after midnight. 
Overall, I'd recommend this property wholeheartedly.  The staff, including the doormen, were friendly and made you feel welcome.  The location can't be beat.  A perfect place to stay in the center of it all in Barcelona!",4,2012,04,12
19,Great location,"Stayed in 2 of the duplex rooms - were great.  We were traveling with our 2 teenage sons to visit my daughter who was in Barcelona for semester abroad.  Thought the front desk staff could have been a little ""warmer"" but overall was a really nice hotel.
Had one bad experience - my husband left his wallet with credit cards in cab.day before we were leaving.   We were contacted by hotel staff that evening to let us know cabbie came back with wallet but wouldn't leave it  because we weren't there.....would come back next day ........next day different person at desk.....gentleman at desk told my husband we should be lucky and should be quiet because we were a little disturbed cabbie still hadn't come back.....well,  turns out cab driver did return the wallet, but charged a few cab fares to a debit card and another credit card.before returning the wallet.....I'm sure he's probably a regular cabbie outside that hotel......other than that one incident, hotel itself is in a really good location....near metro and convenient to almost everything.",4,2012,04,12
19,Kid-friendly,"We have twin babies and most hotels insist on booking 2 interconnected rooms for us. We spoke to Claris, and they were kind enough to suggest that we could all stay together in a Junior Suite, and we got a great price on www.derbyhotels.com. 

The location is wonderful, the service impeccable, and the artworks fabulous. There was some drilling noise from the 6th floor, but when we complained about it, it immediately stopped. The restaurants in the hotel looked great, but there were so many wonderful places nearby that we ate out all the time.  A special mention for the doormen who were always kind and helped us with the strollers, shopping bags and taxis on multiple occasions. Our kids loved the hotel and we will come back again.",4,2012,04,10
19,Rooms need updating,"Although the hotel is excellently located in the example, and the neighborhood is elegant, our room was tiny and dark. The wood floors were extremely scratched and worn, the bathroom was claustrophobic, and didn't seem to deserve the 5 star rating. The lobby is cool and the rooftop lounge was lovely. It is time to renovate the rooms.
Also the hairdryer was broken.. ",2,2012,04,09
19,Great location and style,"Superb location. That is the first comment. Hotel oozes chic style and features great artworks. Staff were first class with excellent English. Lots of good advice too, notably on restaurants. Breakfast was good but not cheap at €40. Room was stylish and comfortable. One disadvantage is that the stylish bathroom is not for the elderly or infirm. The bath is narrow and a fall would be disastrous in view of sharp edges everywhere. Ask for a disabled room if you are not too stable.",4,2012,04,08
19,FABULOUS HOTEL in Great area,Just returned from 3 nights at the Claris in Barcelona. Great hotel. Rooms are modern and immaculate. Staff was great. Can not say enough great things about this hotel. Very attentive with subtle luxury amenities.,5,2012,04,03
19,Excellent customer service,"Not only is the Claris's location wonderful, but the customer service provided by the hotel is just amazing! The staff was accommodating and always went beyond expectations to say hello, and assist. The hotel has a small hotel feeling, very clean and the rooftop is a relaxing place after a day of touring this wonderful city! Would definitely go back and recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona!",5,2012,03,30
19,Perfect for a Mini Break in the Sun,"We chose the Claris as the location for a family mini break in March 2012. It is well situated in the Business district which gives easy access to the Ramblas etc and is surrounded by upscale shops, restaurants and bars.
The hotel is bright and modern with communal areas filled with antiquities and interesting exhibits. We were upgraded on arrival from a twin room to a suite which was very well kitted out providing every amenity you could think of and that other reviewers have listed!
Standards are high here and the staff are discreet yet attentive. The rooftop bar & pool should not be missed!",5,2012,03,27
19,Hotel Claris is a gem!,"We stayed in this ideal location in the L’Eixample district of Barcelona for a week in late March and found the service, amenities and especially the staff to be warm, welcoming and helpful.  Located in the middle of an upscale area with great shops and restaurants; two blocks to La Rambla.  Staff anticipated all needs from the gentleman who ran the sumptuous breakfast bringing cappiccino without request on my 2nd morning to Billiana (front desk staff member) suggestions for the best reasonably priced restaurants in Barcelona, where we joined locals out for the evening (not an American tourist guidebook in sight)!  The rooms were beautifully decorated and the bed/linens are among the best I’ve ever slept on.  Rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed; thick, fluffy towels and robes and marble tile floor in bathroom.  Would happily return again!",5,2012,03,25
19,Worth the trip to Barcelona.,"I had stayed by myself at the Claris Hotel in the middle of March for my Spring Break, and I must say, this hotel was one of the highlights of my stay. Besides the fact that my room was very modern and spacious, with ample room to move around, and the little extras such as the remote-controlled blinds, a second door in the room for soundproofing against the noises of the hallway, etc. what really pleased me was the attention I had received from the staff of this hotel, starting with the maids, and going to the front-desk staff, as well as the manager herself. When informed by my family in the US that I had neglected to bring a proper power adapter for Spain with me, as well as the charger for my iPod, the hotel staff responded immediately, and produced a charger with the proper power adapter the very next day while I was out. Upon my check-out I had learned that this was the power adapter of one of the members of the staff, and I was very impressed by their attention and helpfulness. The staff was very helpful with suggestions in whether where to eat, or the best way to get to any tourist attractions, specifically I should mention their doorman who was a great deal of help every time. The maids were also very accommodating, frequently coming in the evening to ask if I needed anything, and replacing towels twice a day, and bringing me slippers to go with the bathrobe, and leaving chocolates on the bed. I also appreciated their ""Business Center"" which was a great help, especially when checking-in for the flight back, and keeping in touch with the US. And on top of it all, the location of the Claris simply couldn't be beat. It was fantastic! Close to everything, and away from the dark alleys.  Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay here again, or any of the Derby hotel chains.",5,2012,03,24
19,5 star service in the best location !!!,"We spent 3 nights at the Claris Hotel from 3rd march 2012 and stayed in room 322, The Claris is only 100 metres from the nearest metro station. The room and the bathroom was very clean, there is a mini bar, a flat screen tv and a free safe to use, also there were complimentary slippers and dressing gowns and toiletry set. The breakfast in the morning was very good with a hot and cold selection of food and the service from the breakfast staff was excellent !!! In actual fact the service from all the staff is excellent at the Claris !!! There is also an egyptian museum in the hotel which is very interesting. Also it has a lovely roof terrace and small swimming pool and gym and sauna. My wife booked this city break as a birthday treat for me, We were so happy to have booked a 5 star hotel at 3 star prices !!! Anybody that stays at the Claris will be very well treated and we would love to go back and stay there again.",4,2012,03,20
19,Outstanding Service All Throughout,"It was my wife's birthday as well as the Mobile World Congress and thus needed the attention to detail necessary to satisfy both personal and business needs. The Hotel Claris excelled on both levels. We were booked into a fantastic loft that reminded me of a cool pad in Soho with all the amenities. In addition, the concierge Biliana and manager Maria Rosa were incredibly accommodating to ensure that we secured difficult to come by restaurant reservations as well as a fantastic guide to lead my wife around while I attended the Congress. I would highly recommend the Claris for anyone looking for an intimate but sophisticated experience right in the heart Barcelona. I am already helping a couple family members and friends get set up to stay there in the coming months. Muchisima gracias!",5,2012,03,07

19,Perfect except for a couple design flaws,"We've just spent five nights at the Claris and are very happy with our choice. Given the upscale atmosphere and attitude of the hotel and staff, the price was fair. It's located in a very nice upscale neighborhood and we were thrilled to find a Paul Pattiserie, or favorite Parisian bakery, a block away. It's a healthy walk to the Ramblas or the Gothic area, but we love to get our exercise that way, and like being away from the turismo crush. Our room was very nice, in the newer top floor area, had a fabulous view of the street but had some very questionable design flaws that seemed to be the result of overthinking by some modernist design committee. It's impossible to turn on the shower without stepping into the tub and getting soaked. There was no chair in the room at which you could sit at the desk...only an artisinal stool that was more suited for milking cows. After asking, though, they brough us one from a ballroom so I could work on my computer at the desk. We've lucked into a wonderful heat wave this week in Barcelona, which unfortunately made our room oppressively warm. The only way to cool it off was to request that they unlock the windows, which also allowed in the loud traffic noise. Internet service was a hefty 13 euros a day, even though we were members of the Small Luxury Hotels club. Given all of this, we very much enjoyed our stay and the service was fabulous. We would definitely recommend the Claris with those caveats.",4,2012,02,25
19,"Fantastic location, staff, and overall value","I recently stayed at the Claris for 5 nights - mixture of business and pleasure.  I loved the rooftop restaurant, the location to major sights, and the staff was incredible.  I called down to order a glass of wine one evening, and they sent a ""sommelier"" with 3 bottles for me to choose from.  The concierge was also excellent in assisting me with shopping destinations, sightseeing tips, and restaurant reservations.  The only downside to this hotel is lack of WIFI, having to purchase internet cards instead.  I had a lovely experience, and would absolutely return.",4,2012,02,18
19,Location! Location! Location!,"I booked our room at Hotel Claris on the advice of a world traveling friend and was extremely pleased with the choice. It was only after our visit that I read reviews on this site and was somewhat amused by any negative comments. The cumulative positive elements of this hotel surpass our recent experience at a Ritz Carlton. The location was perfect, the staff pleasant and attentive at all times, the quirky ambience was very comfortable, the rooftop terrace is excellent and we even enjoyed the bonus experience touring the Egyptian museum (we've been to Cairo and visited several Tut exhibitions in America). What endeared me to this hotel for all time occured when we were in customs and my husband realized his cell phone was missing. I emailed our last two hotels and got a timely response from Claris notifying us that the phone had been found in the safe by a maid. I was astounded when it was delivered by FedEx two days later. If Barcelona ever pops up on a planned itinerary, Claris will be our home.",5,2012,02,17
19,Excellent Hotel in an Excellent Place,"Claris has all you could wih for. Great location (walking distance to Passaige de Gracia, 10 mins to Rambla, many shopa and restaurants around). My room had a great panoramic view and was full of sunlight all day long (506, if you'd like to enjoy the same). Bathroom has the same panoramic window too so you can either enjoy a view of Barcelona or let Barcelona enjoy nude you :-) or simply close the curtain :-)",5,2012,02,17
19,"Great hotel, well located with friendly staff","We stayed two nights for a birthday treat. Got upgraded to much better room on 5th floor and gave us a half bottle of red wine to enjoy together. Very happy overall - and was exceptional value as we booked months in advance (€120/130 a night).
Few slight negatives - I would say this is probably a four star not five, both for quality of room but also service. The staff were very friendly when you engaged with them - but not pro-actively ensuring your stay was to a five star level with those personal touches.
The room we had originally booked was too small and poorly equipped for five star - but upgrade was fine with a good view.
Oh finally roof Terrace looked superb - and I'm sure great asset in the summer with pool and great city views.",5,2012,02,16
19,Great location,"the rooms are interesting, layout of the suites with the upper level TV area is quite funky. staff friendly, the f&b is good, roof top bar is great for people watching and looking out over the city. reception staff, at least the lady on duty on arrival was the only negative",4,2012,01,30
19,"HOTEL CLARIS, BARCELONA","I am a TA in NY and just had clients at this hotel. The staff and service were amazing, the rooms were great as well and my clients will be back",5,2012,01,09
19,nice location in the L'Eixample area,"My husband surprised me with a trip to Barcelona to ring in the New Year.

Overall, we were pleased with this hotel. We arrived early in the day (9am) and the hotel upgraded us to an executive room that was ready.  Per Trip Advisor reviews, I requested a room facing the center courtyard vs the street.  We stayed in room 501.

We had no view from our room given the choice to face the courtyard, but it was definitely less noisy than the street side.  We live in a NYC apartment, so we are used to occasional noise from neighbors & didn't find it difficult to sleep due to noise from neighboring rooms.  Granted we went to bed pretty late & rose pretty late (trying to eat late as the Barcelona locals do)  We could definitely hear people talking & water running in  our bathroom, but nothing bothersome.

We did find that the room could get a bit stuffy at times.  There was a heat/air switch, but it didn't seem to work that great on the cool setting.  We found a big move towards conserving energy, and guessed that the hotel was limiting the time the level of the a/c.  If the windows opened (they were locked), this may have eliminated this concern.  We both thought that we might not want to stay here in the summer if the a/c could be a concern. (It was in the 40s & 50's most of our trip)

The doormen, front desk staff & the housekeepers were all very pleasant & willing to help. 

There were several metro stops within walking distance.  There are many nice restaurants in walking distance.  Most of the shopping nearby is upscale chain oriented, but there were a few boutiques too.  I preferred the boutiques in the Born area of town as they seemed to have more unique clothing & leather goods.

Paco Meralgo was one of our favorite restaurants on the trip but a long walk or short cab ride from the hotel.  Cornelia & Co on Valencia was a nice option for late night eating or grabbing something to go.  Crusto bakery across the street from Cornelia & Co had lovely sweets and offered some yummy sandwiches & salads too. Dolce was a nice place in the same area.  Known for their sweets, but they have a nice lunch & dinner menu too. Great price fixe deal the night we dined there.  We enjoyed dinner at Habaluc too, also in walking distance & a nice option when you tire of all the Catalan tapas places.  Great wine bar on Passeig de Gracia nearby too.",4,2012,01,08
19,Great location and staff,"We stayed here for three nights in July 2011 in a two-story Duplex room (with our niece in a Standard room). Our room had a great walk-in closet and a lovely living room upstairs. We found the beds perfectly comfortable (and I'm pretty picky about that) although not plushy. We almost did not book here because of the high-priced WiFi, but we asked the front desk about this and you can get one hour free per room per day with a special code. It was all we needed, so we were quite satisfied. The rooftop lounge is absolutely delightful and we had a nightcap there on two of the three nights. We also used the (very small) business center to print our boarding passes. The artwork and ambiance of the hotel are impressive. The location is the best part of this hotel (in addition to a really accommodating staff, who made excellent restaurant recommendations). We were within easy walking distance of many attractions, restaurants and shops. It's not very far really to walk into the Barri Gotic, but this area is so much quieter. Most of the Gaudi sites are either just around the corner or a short walk. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.",4,2012,01,08
19,Perfectly Located Gem,"Amazing location, midway up, but one block off of the main drag (Passeig de Gracia) so you were minutes away from great restaurants, the Ramblas, Guadi sites, and great shopping; but it was quiet.  Claris is more of a Boutique hotel than a typical 5 star, however what they lacked in amenities (tiny gym, small business center) they more than made up for in service.  I was having trouble on the old PC's while trying to print boarding passes and someone from reception sat with me trying to help and eventually let me use her office computer; the concierge made and changed restaurant reservations as needed and made excellent recommendations - we ended up having a wonderful New Year's Eve dinner at a hip restaurant nearby that we wouldn't have known about otherwise.  Rooms are nicer than in the picture and again, well serviced - twice daily maid service, ice within minutes of making a call, sent someone up to our room in 1 minute when the key was not working.  Great for romance or a family - would stay here again.",4,2012,01,07
19,Stayed over New Years,"Just stayed at Claris Hotel in Barcelona over New Years. Overall a good experience. Jr Suite was very nice & modern. Bathroom was a bit dated style-wise but still had high-end finishes and was very clean. Location was also very convenient - short distance to excellent shopping areas.

Other reviewers had concerns around hardness of bed. I didn't find this to be a problem at all, but typically I've found most European hotels to not have super plushy beds like in North America. Front Desk staff & service from everyone we encountered was also very nice. Only complaint was the pricey WiFi (15 euros/24 hrs) and you have to keep logging back in with an ID/password provided.

While it was too chilly to utilize the rooftop pool, the bar was very nice and had a great view. We also had a New Years Eve dinner at the Hotel - was an excellent meal - too much food in fact & superb wine/champagne.",4,2012,01,02
19,Great location and very helpful staff,"Had a quick pre Christmas break without the children. Arrived at the hotel around 8.30pm asked the front desk to organise a nice restaurant for us they were great. Restaurant booked, nice table , they gave us a card to show we were from the hotel which I am sure helped us get very attentive service. The hotel was in a great spot just off the main boulevard and close to the metro. They upgraded us to a suite which was nice and also very quiet. The front desk couldn't do enough to help providing maps booking restaurants and offering advice. 
We would certainly return to Barcelona and would happily return to the hotel Claris.",4,2011,12,23
19,Keep returning...,"16-19 July Suite number 622
WIFI AT A (HIGH) CHARGE
Booked through Small Luxury Hotels and was triple upgraded to a suite (nice)! Stayed many time at the Claris. Like the location and love their rooftop pool and terrace. Staff professional, friendly and service minded (not the standard feature in Barcelona). Even though bedrooms are nicely decorated and comfortable, they need to be upgraded. In particular the bathrooms which also tend to be a bit small (even in the suite). Rooms on the lower floors facing the street are a bit noisy so I stay away from them. But Claris has its charm, you get what you expect and most often also at a very decent price. Don’t expect W or Mandarin Oriental, but the quality and service is still more than adequate with a third of the price tag from the hotel mentioned.  BUT why no free wifi???",4,2011,12,09

19,Good. A rating.,"We just got back a week ago. I booked this hotel from all the reviews from this sites. Good location. About 2 blocks to the main shopping and reastaurant street. Hotel is new. Does have bellboy services. Room is cleaning. Air flow not very good in the room. Windows can't open it at all.  I booked room with breakfast package. Breakfast does offer hot meal. Very good.  Hotel also has gym, swim pool. We only spent for 3 nights. Didn't get chance to use at all.  Very nice. I liked it.  I will stay there again, if I do got back to Barcelona.. I give 3-4starts rating for the hotel. ",5,2011,12,03
19,"Great location, great value, stylish and comfortable","We stayed 6 nights at the Claris in November/11 (based on a friend's recommendation) and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff was welcoming and helpful, and the location is outstanding for convenience and proximity to major attractions. Our suite was an excellent value, well appointed, and very quiet, a nice oasis in noisy and congested Barcelona. Given the cooler weather, we didn't make use of the pool but did enjoy the rooftop terrace, which has great views of the neighborhood and friendly staff that were happy to let us stay under the cozy heat lamps until the wee hours of the morning. 

Our room had some problems... The sauna didn't work properly and despite bringing this to the staff's attention early on, it didn't get fixed during our stay. Nor did a clogged bathroom sink. But despite these glitches we came away with a positive impression and would recommend the Claris for those seeking comfortable accommodations in a stylish hotel with good amenities and in a super location.",4,2011,12,03
19,Personal Letter....,"Dear lovely Hotel Claris Team!

Your Hotel is unique in design and facilities. Small and cosy - to feel like home, even far away! Once you arrive at the small corner, the beautiful facade, with modern and historic architecture is welcoming you.

The always helpful and very friendly doormen are greeting you with ""Ola!"" and you know, where you are! Regardless if luggage, shopping and sight- seeing advises or the TAXI request, the 2 gentlemen have been always at our service- prompt and warm hearted! Chatting with you...having a word, not just because they are supposed to, because they want to...

Your amazing Front Office team, always busy, but quick and efficient in the same time- but never stressed or hectic. Any language spoken, always smiling, ANY request- they can make it happen. Thanks at this point for the apples :-) keep it!

My special regards and thanks goes to your gentleman, serving every morning at the daily breakfast restaurant: very very friendly, prompt and supe attentive! Nothing came out of my mouth- he was already there...I never needed to turn around to look for anything...my coffee hot and never empty, he knew you from the first day and how you like your breakfast...how much more relaxing can a day start?

At any point of service either the ladies cleaning the room, opening my bed sheets in the evening or the good looking guys from your room service ( good strategy!)...you have an amazing team and I trust you know!

It is not common to receive such a positive attitude now a days in many places..keep them happy :-)

Don't let anyone of them go!!!

Whenever I will return to Barcelona and you are not running 100% occupancy, you will see me again :-)

Cheers and thank you all very much, for such a pleasant memory!

(P.S. Loved you bed and pillows!)

19,Great value and location,"Fantastic hotel for the price.  Great location and service, and a lovely breakfast.  The rooms are well-furnished and impeccably clean.  The bathroom is great, tho the shower was a little awkward to use.  We enjoyed the rooftop pool and terrace to relax and for the views.",4,2011,11,28
19,Good hotel but slightly pretentious,"Lovely location, beautiful and stylish hotel but the worst bit was the breakfast room and the low-ish quality of the overpriced food. Rooms were not on a par with the rest of the hotel but I didn't feel they were as bad as some reviewers wrote. The pool was nice but not really big enough to accomodate more than 2 or 3 guests at a time. And that's all the sun-loungers they've got anyway. Overall, good enough service, but I wouldn't go back to it when I go back to Barcelona.",4,2011,11,28
19,You Can Do Better...But Location & Staff Are Excellent,"We just stayed 5 nights at Claris Hotel.  The diappointments: The rooms were the worst part of our trip as they were dark and cramped.  They are kind of depressing to be in. You won't find a worse bed anywhere as they are hard and short to the floor.  The bathrooms are luxurious yet dated and it's hard to get in shower easily. Eating in the basement for breakfast was not ideal...again, it felt dark and cramped.  The positives: The hotel itself was very modern and you can't beat location...taxis are waiting across street 24/7.  The staff is extremely accomodating.  The rooftop is beautiful and a great place to relax at night with wine or anytime.The price was right but this really isn't a 5 star hotel...it goes downhill after lobby and friendly staff.  More a 3-4 star.",3,2011,11,22
19,Disappointing,"We recently stayed at the Claris Hotel in Barcelona.  Convenient location, beautiful lobby, but rooms and amenities are not 5-star quality.  Only hotel we stayed in during our 2-week, 6-city vacation in Spain and Portugal that charged for wifi. Bright lobby but rooms are dark.  Noisy--could hear adjoining rooms and halls.  Bathroom with 2 sinks but shower floods bathroom.  Heat did not work--staff had to bring us a space heater.  Disappointing for a 5-star hotel.",3,2011,11,15
19,CONVENIENT LOCATION,"Just returned from our 4 day stay in Barcelona and at the Claris.  Couldn't be happier with the service of the more than accomodating staff, particularly Bilianna, the concierge.  She went over and above in helping us to make the most of our limited time in the city.  The hotel was very conveniently located just a block from a major street, but without the noise and hustle, bustle that would accompany such a location.  The room was clean and spacious and offered a window that actually opened!  The morning buffet breakfast was more than adequate with choices of hot meals prepared per your request.  In all, a wonderful hotel in a exciting city.",5,2011,11,14
19,Just OK,"Other reviews here note most of the positives and negatives.. Good location and nice lobby.  Everything else at the hotel -- room, service, ammenities -- was just ok but nothing special.",3,2011,11,09
19,Beautiful hotel and location,"We just completed out first trip to Barcelona. We stayed at the Claris. We were alittle unsure of our bearings as we had never visited this city. The Claris was perfectly located. It was a nice, quiet neigbothood and within walking distance of everything. We were able to walk to the Rambla and Placa de Catalunya. Also walked to the Cathedral and the old town area. Goudi house also within walking distance. Hotel upscale. Room was clean and very nicely equipped. Beautiful rooftop bar and restaurant. Food was excellent but a little expensive. Staff can arrange anything you need like transfers to airport. Taxis right outside the door. Shops close by. All in all-perfecC",5,2011,11,07
19,"Location was great, lacked character","I give this hotel 3 stars because of it's proximity to cultural attractions (5 minute walk to La Pedrera and Passieg de Gracia). That is a definite plus. You feel the upscale nature of the hotel when you walk in the lobby; it's very modern and bright. However, the rooms are tiny and dark, so it is not a hotel you want to laze around in. The pool on the roof is just okay, there is nothing fancy or especially inviting about it. Also, internet is an extra charge, about 15 Euro a day, which is always something that surprises me in a nicer hotel. When I go back to Barcelona, I will probably stay somewhere else, I don't think this is worth the money.",3,2011,11,07
19,"Overall good location and service, not 5 star quality","My girlfriend and I visited Barcelona nov 2010. Hotel Claris in general was very nice however we felt it was more 4 star than 5 star. 

Service was good, staff were accommodating and welcoming, however the room seemed to lack 5 star quality. It was not entirely clean and the bed was extremely uncomfortable, in fact i found 'premier inn' had better quality beds. 

Location was ideal however there was an extreme amount of traffic noise, despite the thick glazed windows it wasn't enough to block out.",3,2011,11,05
19,Don't bother booking at this hotel!,"My wife and I were booked into this hotel by a travel agent.  The 5 star rating being shown for this place made it seem absolutely acceptable.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Upon arrival we were taken to a room on the 4th floor.  There was an odor (which turned out to be drying varnish) in the hallway  which got worse when we entered the room.  We asked to be shown another room.  The next room was smaller and the bed was uncomfortable in appearance and more so when sat upon.  Once again we asked for another room.  After some delay we were told by the manager that the first room was an ""upgrade"" from the original room booking and the only option was another ""upgrade"" for a fee!  We decided to try to stay with the first room when we were told that the facility staff knew what the problem was and it would clear in an hour or two.  After waiting for about an hour we reentered the room and found that the odor was as bad as before. There was a clue just outside of the room: incense burning in an obvious attempt to cover the other odors! At this point we were tired and decided to try and deal with the problem by opening the windows and airing the room.  The odor was not the only problem.  There were no chairs, the closet was too small to hang anything more than a few shirts, the TV was not easily viewable from the bed (because there were no chairs the bed was the one place to sit aside from a low bench along the wall), the sink and floor in the bathroom were not clean, there were no tissues, access in and out of the tub was difficult since there was no railing or handle to provide assistance, one of the sheets on the bed was stained, the door to the small refrigerator would not stay closed, no food service in the hotel except at specific times, and finally, the lobby had only limited seating.  We stayed three nights and did survive.  The staff at Reception was as helpful as they could be given the circumstances and the attitude of the manager.  Don't bother to book this place.  There are a great number of hotels in the city to choose from.",1,2011,10,31
19,Loved the hotel and its location,"From the moment we walked thru the lobby everyone was welcoming, warm and friendly. The room was great (except the internet connection never worked from the room). I especially loved how helpful Pau at the front desk was. His restaurant and other suggestions were greatly appreciated. The location of the hotel is perfect for all the Gaudi sites. We would definitly return to the Claris.",5,2011,10,26
19,Great Hotel - we would stay here again.,Wonderful location for Barcelona. Great room -- we had a suite with it's own sauna. Didn't get a chance to use it -- too busy enjoying the city. Very good breakfast buffet. Only complaint is that wifi connection was very poor. Very helpful staff -- gave great recommendations for shopping and services in the area.,5,2011,10,26
19,Overall excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Claris for 5 nights in October.  The room was excellent - very quiet, clean, turn down service every night.  Although we got to the hotel early, our room was ready and we were able to check in.  The concergie services were good, and we got a dinner recommendation almost every night we were there as well as other recommendations.  The breakfast was wonderful, very fresh and an ample supply of food.  We loved the location of the hotel in a quiet area of the city and walkable to everything, but definately not in the center near all the action of the Ramblas.  We would definately stay here again!",4,2011,10,25
19,"Beautiful Hotel, Terrific Service and a fabulous location","We stayed at the Claris Hotel for 4 nights recently as we discovered Barcelona.  The location was outstanding and within easy walking distance to all of the major sites.  

The roof top restaurant was lovely for a late evening drink. The food pricing was a bit high for the quality of it - and it is better to experience Tapas in the local restaurants.

The staff was most helpful and we selected to have the breakfast buffet at the hotel - and the food quality and selection were excellent.",5,2011,10,13
19,"Great Location, Service and Staff (what else you want??)","Recently we had a pleasure to stay at this chic hotel in the center of Barcelona. During our stay my wife got very sick because of the malfunction of our room aircondition. As anyone can understand traveling on vacation and get sick is the last thing you want.

After talking with the hotel team about our situation, they helped us with everything they could, from calling a doctor, offer to change the room and help us in any way possible (even getting gatorade drinks, thanks Pedro)

One of top of that, they deputy general manager, Ms. MaRosa was there to check on us on daily basis. She went out of her way to make sure we comfortable and if we need anything. 

We have been around the around the world and stayed good amount 5 stars hotels, because of Ms. MaRosa and her team makes Claris Hotel stand out from the most of them.

Truely a pleasure experience when we needed the most during our tough times.",5,2011,10,11
19,Not at it's prime anymore.,"The good: location was pretty good, the rooftop was very nice and room service was good.  The staff was helpful sometimes.  The bad: couldn't figure out why they burned incense in the hall on each floor until day 3 when we were checking out and the smell of sewer gas was strong enough to over power the incense. The TV in our room did not work and they had no one to fix it. The toilet ran and had to be jiggled to stop it and had no one to fix it. Large crack in the wall by the door.  The room was modern and fairly clean however overall this hotel has seen better days and is moving toward ""the run down and in need of updates"" phase of it's lifecycle. There are many other choices that are better for the price.",2,2011,10,11
19,Jules,"Enjoyed everything about our stay at the Claris. The staff could not have been more helpful. We arrvied early for check-in left our luggage and went out for lunch. We arrvied back to be upgraded, at no extra cost, to a junior suite.  Location is great. Would certainly recommend this to other people.",5,2011,10,10
19,"Okay, but not outstanding for a 5 star hotel","Had high expectations as the hotel is a member of Design Hotels. The interior might all be handcrafted but so is the crack in the wall of my room only scarcely covered with some white paint in the wrong colour.. TV remote did not work, the internet connection that you pay 13 Euros for a day only sometimes work and overall I think you can find better value for money elsewhere. Staff was nice, roof top terrace with swimmingpool was also nice.",3,2011,10,07
19,"Great Hotel, good location, good service",We had a very enjoyable 4 nights stay at the Claris Hotel.  Location was great for walking to everything.  Staff was very helpful with restaurant recommendations/reservations.  Thanks Pedro!!!!!  Great pool and views on the roof.  The roof is a very nice place to have a drink after a long day of walking.  Would definitely stay here next time we are in Barcelona,4,2011,10,05
19,Not 5star by USA standards,"The hotel was nice. Location was great.  Amenities  and staff were nice but... Walls are very very thin.  Wifi is not free. And overall its just not up to USA standards of what classifies as 5 star.  To me, not worth the money.",3,2011,10,01
19,"Lovely hotel, would definately go back!",Stayed here at the beginning of September for 3 nights and had a very enjoyable stay. Before we left for Barcelona I emailed the hotel to say that we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday and on the first night they sent some champagne and strawberries up to the room! The room was really nice and we couldn't fault the maid service. Lovely roof top bar and the hotel is in a fantastic location.,5,2011,09,30
19,Excellent hotel and service,"We stayed at the Claris for four nights in late September 2011 and have nothing but praise for the staff, service and accommodation. Although the room was at the front of the hotel in the original building and looked out onto the street, noise was not a problem.
The room was very clean and spacious, with an excellent king sized bed. Terrific toiletries and a nightly turn down service with chocolate was a nice touch.
Nothing seemed like too much trouble for the front desk staff, especially Pau, who suggested restaurants and happily booked them for us and arranged taxis when necessary. 
The rooftop bar was a lovely spot to have a pre dinner drink.
We stay in many high end hotels and I have no hesitation in recommending The Claris!",5,2011,09,27
19,Would return to Claris in a Heartbeat.,"Of our week in Barcelona, we had originally booked the Claris for 4 nights and a noted hotel in the Ramblas for the other 3 nights.  We enjoyed everything about the Claris--location in the Eixemple section and within walking distance of many attractions and restaurants and accessible to others by taxi or bus, our elegant and contemporary room in a stately and historic building, terrific rooftop pool, bar, and gym, friendly and helpful staff and fine service, and splendid breakfast buffet.  Asked for a room over the front entrance and enjoyed our view from the long windows in our 2-story room, after discovering the motorize shade control behind the drape.  The Claris is a fun conflation of contemporary and ancient artwork and decor.  We became very attached to this terrific hotel and ultimately cancelled our reservation at the other hotel in the noisy Ramblas area so that we could continue our stay at the Claris. I inadvertently left some valued jewelry in the room safe and the staff was attentive in seeing that it was  located and returned to me promptly to the US.  We highly recommend the Claris and would return there in a heartbeat.",5,2011,09,24
19,nice place.,"it is a very nice hotel, staff very friendly. The location is amazing. Right by some high end shopping and clean wide streets. The only problem we had was that there was some construction in the room next door that woke us up early. The were nice enough to stop it when we complained.",4,2011,09,18
19,"Perfect location, great hotel","The location was perfect for us, the hotel superb. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. And many thanks to them for the easy and early check-in after a long overnight flight. We would definitely return. ",5,2011,09,16
19,"Lovely rooms and good location, but stay spoilt by very noisy re-furb work","Booked 2 nights in superior room in August 2011. Room on 5th floor was great but woken at 8:30 next morning by very loud hammering by workers re-furbishing next room. No warning about this work taking place when we booked, checked in or were shown to the room. Asked to move room and moved to similar room on 3rd floor and same thing happened next morning. Complained again and was given 10% discount on bill - Spansih sense of humour.

Understand that rooms have to be re-furbished and that closing hotel does not make financial sense, but why not do the following:
1) notify people in advance so that they can make up their mind whether they want to stay 
2) schedule noisy work, for periods when most guests are likely to be out of the hotel say 11 to 6
3) let guests know when noisy work will start and stop so that they can plan accordingly.",3,2011,09,02
19,Staff were awesome,"Hey all,
I had friends who stayed here and i would go over and meet them morning and sometimes for a swim at the roof-top pool.  The staff were so very nice to me and welcoming even though I did not stay there.  I'd recommend this and I did not stay here as they were booked out at the time or out of my budget, either way it was a great hotel and close to all good things in Barcelona.",4,2011,08,28
19,Good but not as great as I thought it would be,Nice but not inexpensive hotel. Room was clean but not as impeccable as the price would suggest. I chose a duplex room because I thought it would be cool. We never used the upstairs. Not the hotel's fault but something to keep in mind. I found that charging for WIFI was a little cheesy. We has stayed in less expensive hotels earlier in the week and it was free as it should be. Good location however and the staff was pleasant and very helpful.,3,2011,08,25
19,Excellent!!!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights - excellent quality, service, and great attention to detail throughout....  We enjoyed having late night drings on the rooftop patio almost every night... Hotel gym is not great, but everything else was amazing...The only thing that would be nice to have is free WIFI in the rooms...",5,2011,08,23
19,Excellent Hotel In Great Location,"This modern hotel is a very short walk to most places you would want to visit and very close to a Metro stop.   Our junior suites were large and quiet (We were on the courtyard side of the hotel, I don't think there is much to see in the front, but I can't imagine it is too noisy in any event).  The housekeeping staff was excellent.   The included breakfast was very good.   The pool area on the roof is a very nice extra. The few pieces of fitness equipment on the roof work.   The staff were always cheerful and generally very helpful.   Like other small hotels, the same folks who work the front desk also take turns as the concierge.  I do have to say that one of those folks was either not well informed or perhaps there was a language issue -- she said a restaurant didn't take reservations when it did (no harm because we were early enough to get a table), she said we wouldn't have to wait at another restaurant when the wait was over an hour (which was impossible for our children), and she didn't know that what we (and the map) would call a Furnicular was necessary to get from the Metro to the Gondolas to visit the old fort.  None of these things was a big deal but if you speak to the front desk staff you might want to verify particularly important details.   None of this detracted much from our very positive experience at the hotel which I highly recommend.  Don't miss the exhibition of Egyptian artifacts on the second floor.",5,2011,08,23
19,Return Stay as Memorable as the First,"On our third trip to Barcelona, we returned to the Claris Hotel which we had been to 3or 4 years earlier. On our initial stay, it had been considered one of the best hotels in this fantastic city because of its location, ( 1block off the Passeige de Gracia)  unique  architecture( beautiful modern, boutique style within a modernist palace), amenities ( great rooftop pool, bar and restaurants) and service. This time ,I was hesitant to rebook because the tour books (ie Fodor) were not raving as they had before. However, we were not at all disappointed. We still love this hotel because  of what I have previously written. Also, I feel it offers great value, especially compared to other 5*L  Barcelona hotels.",5,2011,08,20
19,Excellent hotel - love bar at the top for late evening drinks,Second visit here.       Good comfortable room and excellent service.  Love the poolside bar on top of the hotel with excellent cocktail menu.   Can be crowded at weekends thought  Avoid breakfast in little basement downstairs.,5,2011,08,14
19,"Great location, clean rooms and nice staff.","Went with a group of friends and although we did not spend much time in the hotel, each minute we were there was quiet and cozy.  Us Americans had to get used to the small quarters and the bathroom was very tiny (we had a standard room with king bed) and our friends had an adjacent room, which the staff was very accommodating!  The shutters were pretty cool as they completely black out the room with a touch of a button.  The view was not bad at all.  We were in central location from the tours and museums like Gaudi, Picasso, and La Rambla.  The check in process was smooth and the hotel is clean and property was well maintained.  The breakfast spread was phenomenal and the concierge was helpful in giving us directions, getting event tickets and they even gave us a courtesy car free.  All in all we will return to this hotel soon!",4,2011,08,13
19,Highly Recommend,"Great location and hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.  Clean and neat hotel.  Excellent breakfast.  There is a rooftop pool, bar and restaurant.  Don't miss the bar on the roof.",5,2011,08,10
19,Overall it ticked all the boxes,"We went to Barca to celebrate our wedding anniversary (3 nights) and chose the Claris through Trip Advisor. The Hotel is very modern in style. Located close enough to be able to walk to many of the key sights and districts.
Our room looked to have been recently refurbished and everything worked as it should.
The only minor irritation was that our towels kept being replenished every day even though we indicated a preference to reuse them by placing them back on the rail as per the green policy info. 
We thoroughly enjoyed the roof top bar and pool area and appreciated the advice from the reception on the options for restaurants within walking distance.
Overall this hotel contributed to what was a really great break.",4,2011,08,09
19,Perfect !!!!!,"Dear all,
I recommend you the Claris Hotel,  in the centre of the city, very modern and vanguardist Hotel.
Very helpful staff, always available and the best concierge with a big list of recommendtions.
Very big terrace with a very nice and romantic restaurant and live music at night.
Our stay was a dream !!!!!.",5,2011,08,07
19,"Very cold, unfriendly and unwelcoming atmosphere","As soon as we went inside the lobby, my family and I knew that we had made a mistake. The lobby had a dreary look to it.  It looked like a lobby in a drab apartment building.  We had stayed at Hotel Arts Barcelona before our cruise and what a difference.  The feeling at Hotel Arts was upbeat, friendly and light.  At Claris it was the exact opposite.  In fact it felt a little depressing. There were only 2 people at the reception. They had us pay at the beginning, which felt a little odd. We went to our room, and it looked a little run down. We turned the TV on, and no TV channels were available. That night, a storm came. The rain poured in through a leak in the window, which seemed to show the poor construction of the building, or at least of the windows. The bathroom shower was poorly designed. The staff were not warm and friendly (in fact some of them were outright sour and surly), although they had a good tapas restaurant recommendation and the concierge helped us get tickets to The Sagrada Familia.  We should also mention that the hotel is not kid or family friendly in any way.

Overall, we can't recommend this hotel.",1,2011,08,06
19,Not a 5 star hotel in my opinion,"When I say the best thing about this hotel is it's location, then you'll understand why I don't rate it as a genuine 5 star hotel. If you want a genuine 5 star hotel with fantastic rooms and service, then I would recommend the 'W hotel' (we have stayed there before). 
When I use the minibar in my room for my pleasure, I don't expect to find bottles of drinks that are not only 'flat', but actually OUT OF DATE!!! there is NO excuse for that.",2,2011,08,04
19,not great but not too bad,"this is a very nice 3 star hotel masquerading as a 5 star. The appearance beautiful, the rooms....a little small...but lets just call them cosy...the staff unhelpful and the noise levels from within the building were quite unexpected and disappointing. I have stayed in alot worse hotels then this but I think the major disappoint was that I expected it to be much better, to perhaps adhere to its '5 star' standard which it flaunts.",3,2011,08,03
19,Great location,"Excellent quality, friendly and helpful staff. Wonderful  quiet pool and dining area. Metro chic boutique hotel that is within walking distance to all the things you will love seeing in Barcelona. We loved the hotel!",5,2011,07,26
19,"Perfect location, knowledgeable concierge and friendly staff","We spent 2 days in Barcelona and stayed at this wonderful hotel.  The staff was excellent!  The concierge was extremely helpful, giving us great ideas for dinner (we went to some amazing local places thanks to her) and she helped us to secure tickets to La Sagrada Familia during a time that wasn't very busy.  The doorman were also extremely pleasant and helpful - always ensuring we had directions and warning us to be sure to secure our belongings so as not to fall victim to pickpockters.

The location of this hotel cannot be beat - it is very centrally located and within walking distance of most of the major sites.  The rooms were clean and well appointed.  We had drinks on the terrace both nights after returning from a late dinner and enjoyed a really relaxing time.

The only item keeping this hotel from getting 5 stars is we were not able to check in until after 3pm.  We arrived on the overnight flight, very tired and hoping to freshen up.  The front desk staff pointed us to the bathrooms downstairs and said they would call us when our room was ready but it would be no later than 1 or 2pm.  When we returned at 1:30 we found our room was still not ready so we went to get some tapas.  When returning around 3/3:30 our room still was not ready and after hurriedly calling housekeeping we were finally able to check in and go to our room around 4pm.  We saw many people checking out when we arrived at 11am so we were surprised none of the rooms were ready.  

I would still recommend this hotel but advise those hoping to check in early that this may not be feasible.  Overall though, a great experience and I would stay here again.",4,2011,07,20
19,All right,Beautiful design for certain.  Don't expect welcoming warmth or a smile from the staff and you won't be disappointed.,3,2011,07,20
19,Great area and good hotel.,"Great area, excellent service and very helpful staff.
Breakfast was not included and was not tempting at over 20 Euro, however there are plenty of lovely cafes close by.
The rooms were not soundproof and I was kept awake after midnight by the piped music playing in the foyer.",3,2011,07,17
19,"Location..Great, Rooms..Beautiful,  Service..not so good.","My friends and I stayed at this hotel based on the recommendation of the travel agent who set up this trip to Barcelona (and Pamplona).    That being said, here's the deal:

LOCATION is great.  A block off the Passeig de Gracias; only 2 blocks from some awesome Gaudi buildings.  It was fairly quiet, being a block off the beaten path,
but was across from a taxi stand, and a few blocks from a subway station.  So getting
around was beyond easy.

ROOMS were beautiful.  Bathrooms were well appointed.  Very nice for the
apparent price (see below).

SERVICE was wanting!  After a very long flight, the front desk folk were 
civil but not friendly.   Being in Barcelona on a Sunday and Monday, dinner
reservations and eating in general is a bit more challenging.   We asked for
help and really got none.   We had done some research before coming and
asked them to make a reservation for us.  They either didn't follow up, or just
told us they had done so.   When we arrived at the restaurant that they said
they had made the reservation for us, we discovered that the restaurant was
closed.   This sort of think happened not once, not twice, but about 5 times!!
Concierge service was.....how do I put this.....non-existent!
Also,  my friends room was right next to the service elevator and at 0600
the noise began and did not stop.  So the room staff seem to have no clue on the
appropriate noise level they create early in the morning.  Inexcusable!!  
These people DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SERVICE MEANS!!!!!!!
Also, just to twist the knife a bit (them to us) they charge $20/day for WIFI.
So it makes the hotel not quite the value it may appear to be. 

In review,  Great location, great rooms, lousy service.",4,2011,07,14
19,Great welcome to Barcelona Hotel,"25 euro taxi from BCN.... smooth check-in.... comfortable room, quiet for jet-lag recovery...
hip rooftop bar-restaurant with a small but elegant pool, all with a club feeling, a respite from the bustle outside.... EXTRAORDINARY LOCATION.... a great place to settle into Barcelona.  Expensive but well worth it.",5,2011,07,11
19,Remarkably appealing and hip - would stay again and again,"We stayed at this spectacular boutique hotel for 8 days in April of this year and were wowed beyond our expectations.  This is a stunning little boutique hotel and we HIGHLY RECOMMEND it for your travel accomodations in beautiful Barcelona.  The rooftop patio we attended each evening for a pre-dinner drink and after one visit, they knew our drinks and they were on the table as we sat. The parma ham snack we had at the rooftop patio and restaurant was off the charts delicious.
Rooms are great, staff goes above and beyond the call of duty to ensure you are well looked after.

19,Lovely Hotel - Great Location & Helpful Staff,"Overall, my experience at Claris Hotel was great. We stayed in a duplex room. It was clean, inviting, and very comfortable. Very cool with the beds on the first floor and the living area at the top. Loved the ambiance of the hotel, especially the rooftop performance we stumbled upon Saturday evening. It was a memorable way to end our day after an afternoon of strolling. The mood was so romantic with the singer sitting on the steps and the band behind her.

Breakfast was included in our room rate. There's an impressive spread in the middle of the room, but you could also have made-to-order breakfast. It was fabulous! The waiter that helped us was very attentive as well (look for a man with the mustache - I forget what his name is though!). My boyfriend and I both had a delicious omelet.

One negative thing about this hotel though is the gym. It was very small with only a few cardio machines and a very small free weights area. Other than that, our experience was wonderful.",4,2011,07,05
19,"Fab Hotel, Fab holiday and we will DEFINITELY return","We arrived at Hotel Claris at midday on June 27 2011. We were greeted by smiling staff and we were checked into our room immediately. The room itself was perfect - lovely soft cotton sheets and some very comfy slippers and robe were provided during our stay! The breakfast was absolutely wonderful - a great range of foods to cater for all breakfast needs and the wait staff were fantastic - especially the gentleman (didn't catch his name) but he was an absolute credit to that hotel! The terrace was lovely and got very busy in the evening, although we mainly used it in the day time but it was a perfect little haven up there! The walk form the hotel to the designer shops was 5 mins and a further 5 to the Ramblas - ideally situated!! We will definitely return to this hotel as the staff were magnificent and really made our trip special. (The only thing I know my husband would change was the lack of free wifi - we did manage to find coffee shops on the ramblas that allowed it but it would have been better at the hotel - however, this did not ruin our holiday with Hotel Claris)Thank you Claris!!",5,2011,07,05
19,Our second time around and we loved it,"Excellent location,service-both profesional and gracious-.It was the same as our previous stay(and the reason we came back....this time with our children and grandson.Only a minor annoyance was the fact that we were unaware(and not told) of the big festivity day of ""La verbena de San Juan"" on a Friday....with most everything closing,especially the banks at 2:30 PM onThursday.",5,2011,07,05
19,Pay Extra for Everything,"It started out ok... the room at the Hotel Claris was clean and included a mini frig to keep some of our heat sensitive stuff in.  I guess I expected that, plus other amenities as normal having stayed at numerous hotels all over the US.  I admit it was my first time outside the US.  I learned after the fact this hotel you PAY EXTRA for everything.  The nightly rate ($270) was absolutely no bargain compared to comparable US hotel stays.  Euros or dollars it's a high price.

We stayed for two nights, except the first night was about totally opposite from the second night.  At the beginning, I agreed with my wife that the room was peaceful and quiet.  Well, that all changed on the second evening when apparently the hotel rents out the roof and the pool for parties!  A huge party on a Thursday night going on and on to well past 1AM!  Not good when you have get up by 6AM to met the plane.

We were told when first checking in, that there was a pool on the roof, plus a bar and dinner entrees.  Just assumed it was for the hotel guests only.  On each floor next to the elevator doors is a small podium which listed the dinner entrees available that day on the roof and price.   We were also told ""breakfast is served below the lobby between 7AM and 10AM"".  Great I thought!  Since we already experienced a delicious free breakfast buffet in Verona Italy, I was looking forward to more European fare...

Not until we sleepily turned in our key at the hotel desk at 7AM did we see our supposedly pre-paid bill had been added to... a $32 charge for EACH of us for a measly breakfast we now regret ever having in their tiny basement!  No where when we went downstairs the first morning, was there any indication that there was a charge.  A huge charge!  Considering it was only a few slices of fruit, little wedges of cheese, and very runny scrambled eggs.  A waiter motioned that we must go to a specific table right next to the buffet table.  Since I thought it was free, I dare not use tables in a more secluded spot.  Since we thought it was free we even gave the waiter a tip!

Bottom line, the hotel was noisy, expensive, no morning coffee, cold pool, no free room Internet ($15 per day).  Our room was not even turned down the second night (everyone must have been at the party).",2,2011,06,30
19,"Not much effort ,very noisy inside , a 4 star at best if you travel a lot and know how it works","The hotel is situated in a great location . We were on the back end of a fabulous trip to Italy ,Sicily , and Palma , all at 5 star stops, La Residencia etc  . We thought we had chosen a top hotel . The initial check in was okay but not warm though the man who brought our bags up was very helpful . The hotel is very noisy , I mean noisy , lots of banging , its not from the street , its inside the hotel . We went to the roof top bar for a cocktail , we could not get served despite going up to the manager and several staff over a 30 minute period , the staff were all consumed with a couple of girls sipping on the same drinks , this included the manager . We left and went across the road to a great place , had a good meal and spent our money else where . checkout was very cool and no questions were asked of our stay , in fact at no point in our stay did we have any communication from the staff . my conclusion is great location , poor management .",3,2011,06,29
19,"Lovely hotel, good location","This hotel is in a great location for access to all parts of Barca. Has Metro stations extremely close closeby to all areas including the airport. 
Hotel nicely set out with a rooftop pool/bar/restaurant. Staff really helpful and friendly and room serviced very well several times a day including 2 towel changes a day. A great stay!!",4,2011,06,29
19,Better than the first time - unique and a perfect location,"We'd stayed here in 2003 and when the opportunity to visit Barcelona at the tail end of a cruise came about, we again chose the Claris.  I'd reserved three suites well ahead of our arrival for our small group and the others appreciated the Claris as much as we did.  The front desk staff was knowledgeable and professional.

The location is superb - close to the best shopping and close enough to the upper parts of Las Ramblas.  Tucked a block away from major thoroughfares, so not noisy.  The rooms are all different, 217 and 218 both have lofts. 217 with a living area upstairs and 218 with a great entry way and sleeping accommodations upstairs. Very clean and well managed with air conditioning that is silent and almost cold. We found our rooms to be quiet and nicely dark for sleeping in. It is affiliated with an Egyptian museum and each room houses various examples of Egyptian art.

The roof houses a restaurant, cocktail area and pool.  A great rooftop venue.  We did not eat here, but enjoyed drinks. Like everywhere else in Barcelona, it is not busy until later.

Great value and a If we are ever back in Barcelona, we'll again choose the Claris.",5,2011,06,17
19,not 5 star...small rooms and average to poor facilities,"We booked this through lastminute.com and if we had paid full price I would have been really upset. The location is the only excellent thing about it. The room was very small and very faded, the bar area by the pool sort of wraps around the lift shaft and didnt have any charm, the gym was  a joke with machines from the 80's....

the staff were lovely and very helpful. Barcelona is great just don't stay here...",3,2011,06,17
19,Mediocre hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in April. We loved the neighborhood it was situated in, some nice restaurants and shops close by. However, the hotel itself did not quite live up to our expectations. It is a design hotel in the cold, impersonal kind of way. The staff was friendly, but nothing more than that. 
The rooms were impersonal as well, and the materials used looked a bit worn down. 
The roof terrace is great, however, so that is definitely worth a visit. Stay there for a drink and wait for the sun to set, then hit the town. 
Conclusion: While the hotel is at a great location, we will not stay here again soon due to the impersonal feeling the hotel breathes.",3,2011,06,15
19,Not the money worth,"Old old, not like 5 star but at most 4. Location is good.",2,2011,06,10
19,The trip of a LIFETIME!,"What an INCREDIBLE hotel. Before arriving, I was in constant contact with Victoria at the concierge desk. She graciously answered my MANY ,MANY emails about restaurants and sights to see and made all our reservations prior to our arrival. When we arrived she introduced herself right away and we felt welcome. She took us upstairs and bought us a glass of wine while we briefly waited for our room to be ready. At the pool overlooking the city (a breathtaking view) she went over our itinerary and explained how to get everywhere going over the mapof the city  in detail.Waiting for us in our room was a bottle of champagne and strawberries to enjoy for our honyemoon, a very nice surprise. Each day when we saw her, she asked if she could be of further assistance. We then met Pau and Biliana who also worked at the concierge desk. They too were friendly and helpful. Each day Biliana when we came back from our long day of sightseeing asked how our day went, what we saw, and offered suggestions what to do at night. Tinto Verano was a FABULOUS suggestion of hers! It was like seeing an old friend to chat with at the end of each day. ALL the staff couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. We kissed them goodbye and felt sad to leave them.The hotel is beautiful, clean, and in a perfect location to most attractions(within walking distance easily) MAGNIFICO!!!! Gracias Victoria, Biliana and Pau for making our stay in Barcelona A TRIP OF A LIFETIME!",5,2011,06,07
19,Excellent Hotel - Could not fault it !!!!,"Just returned from a most wonderful stay in Barcelona for our 20th Wedding anniversary and I have to say the Hotel Claris more than added to how perfect our break away was ! 
We were on an early flight and arrived at the Hotel mid morning and the receptionist could not have been more accommodating in trying to get my friends and I rooms, not only together, but that were ready for us to check in immediately.  She went to a lot of trouble and re-arranging to make this possible for us and was more than pleasant about doing so ! So we were able to check in as soon as we arrived - no having to leave our bags do shopping and then come back to our rooms !
Our rooms were beautiful with a lovely view over the front of the hotel. 
The service was excellent, the staff at all times courteous and all in all we just could not fault this beautiful hotel in the centre of Barcelona with the most amazing roof top Garden and restaurant overlooking the city. (We would recomment you book the restaurant in advance though as a lot of local people use it and as it was the week-end of the Grand Prix we could not get a table there in the evenings to eat - which was the only dissapointment we had !)
So all in all we would highly recommend this Hotel for a romantic week-end away or a sightseeing tour of this amazing city !
A big Thank you to the Hotel Claris and its lovely staff for making our 20th Wedding Anniversary a happy and special one !!!!
We will be back !

19,"Great location, wonderful food, excellent staff","The hotel has a perfect location, and the staff at this hotel were amazing.  The room (jr. suite) was spacious.  I ordered room service once because my spouse had an unexpected meeting and the quality of the food (for room service) was the best I have had.  The only drawback that I had with this hotel is that the beds are VERY firm.  The bed quality was definitely not five star.  Overall, I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and their attention to detail.",4,2011,05,13
19,impeccable in every respect,"I have been travelling since 1955 and have always sought out the best hotels wherever I went.  The Claris, where I stayed for eight days, is among the very best.  In every way I found it outstandingly good.  The reception was as friendly and helpful as you could want and the hotel manager active, friendly and available.  My room itself (I had a spacious junior suite) was extremely comfortable and attractive.  The room service was impeccable (rooms are cleaned and used towels exchanged several times a day). Although I did not use them, there was a beautiful terrace pool and a small exercize room.  One of the best features of all was the small, delightful terrace restauurant.  The service was efficient and friendly; the cuisine was so imaginative excellent (and so well-priced) I had most lunches and several dinners there.   All in all the Claris is a winner.   It well merits its five star rating.",5,2011,05,12
19,A great hotel can make a vacation great - Claris is a great hotel,"One block off the best street in the best neighborhood in Barcelona, we could not have asked for a better location. Lots of restaurants, bars, shops it is convenient to everything. Beautiful hotel with spectacular public spaces. Art is everywhere in the Barcelona tradition. Our standard room was very comfortable, quiet and roomy with a great bed. Nice to have a sofa in the room to watch TV. Staff is helpful and friendly. On the down side, the shower is a little weird and difficult to control overspray, no free WiFi and we had some air conditioning issues. Overall a very good value and we would stay at the Claris again with no hesitation.",5,2011,05,04
19,"Wonderful staff, average accommodations, no wireless access.","Beds and rooms are a little small.  Wireless is said to be available for 15 euros/day, but we were only able to get a signal in the bathroom, and even that signal was weak.  Location is good, not very far from metro stations or Eixample area sights.  The staff was the only real highlight of the place, everyone was wonderful.",3,2011,04,24
19,Disappointing,"The hotel was extremely noisy and the staff not particulary hospitable. They were not very accommodating in helping with restaurants,sightseeing or bike tours. Thanks goodness we had the Frommer guide since it was our first visit to Barcelona. We could not sleep because we could hear the guests above,below and next to us at all hours of the night. For the price we paid it was very disappointing. Yes. my friend did let the manager know of our disappointment.
Would not recommend this hotel to other travelers.",1,2011,04,21
19,Extraordinarily noisy,"The noise level was completely unacceptable.  The rooms and hallways have wood floors, so you can hear people coming in all night long. We were told we were in a quiet suite, but the street noise was not the problem. Also, I could hear every single word from  the television next door, it was not even muffled. No one could sleep.Stayed 4 nights, same every night. The hotel staff is not very informed about restaurants. They recommended uninteresting places, when a fabulous bistro was across the street. It was very clean, and good location, but I would never stay again.",1,2011,04,12
19,the room we were given was far from being 5 star L,"Room small and dark (small corner window), small bathroom (1 basin), toilets not separated, small bed. Everything would have been perfect if the hotel had been 3 or 4 stars but for a 5 stars L, it is like daylight robbery. I guess that when you buy a package (flight+hotel) they give you their lowest standard rooms, which is not fair. You have to pay for listening music! great disappointment",2,2011,04,05
19,A great start to our belated honeymoon.,"This hotel is in a great location-close to Passeig de Gracia, metro, and about 15 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya and The Ramblas.  It is a truly elegant hotel. They knew we were coming for our honeymoon, and they pulled out all of the stops for us. The rooms are spacious, and the bathroom is just stunning (sauna included!). Staff are extremely helpful.  The rooftop bar/restaurant is fantastic, well worth the price.  For those who have food allergies (I'm GFCF), they will adapt to your needs beautifully. There is also a small gallery in the hotel which has some great Egyptian artifacts.  We were the only ones in it when we visited it. 

Only minuses to the hotel were we found the beds a little too hard to the point of not being able to sleep, no free wifi (15 Euro a 24 hour period) and the lack of English channels on TV.  BBC world was frozen, so we really only had one channel to get any information from at all.",5,2011,03,31
19,"You pay for perfect location, service, and a spacious room, and the Hotel Claris does not disappoint!","We have just returned from 5 nights in Barcelona and loved our stay at the Hotel Claris. We enjoyed early check-in, the ample and tasty buffet breakfast, extremely helpful staff, and perfect location. We were traveling with our two young children and the hotel was so accomodating, providing a roll away bed and even linens and slippers for our youngest when he decided to make the sofa his bed. The front desk helped us secure dinner reservations and always provided excellent advice. It would be best if they could provide free wifi but the two free computers in the business center sufficed. We loved our stay in Barcelona and the Hotel Claris had a lot to do with a great vacation. ",5,2011,03,24
19,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for our first wedding anniversary at the end of February for three nights. This is a nice hotel, fabulous reception area, modern, fresh and clean, and the bar/restaurant on the roof terrace is wonderful with a nice, modern sitting area with sofas and tables, then an inside part for the restaurant and a pool next to this (which we did not use as it was not heated and it was fairly chilly) however the bar was very overpriced but we expected this from a four star hotel in the center of Barcelona, however if you walk just minutes in any direction you can literally buy the same drinks for nearly half the price. The staff in all areas of the hotel are friendly and extremely helpful, they recommended some gorgeous restaurants and were happy to make us reservations. Breakfast was nice, fresh fruits, yogurts, pastries, breads, juices, coffee and they also offered a hot menu which was cooked on request which was very nice and the waiter in the restaurant offered fantastic customer service. 
The only down side to the hotel was the rooms, they were extremely dated and worn compared to the rest of the hotel; the rugs, the curtains and furniture needs to be replaced, and the room as a whole was small, dim and over looked some residential flats and gardens, however this is to be expected in a large city. The beds were comfortable and the maid service was fantastic, cleaning and tidying the rooms twice a day, and leaving complimentary chocolates on our pillows each night for when we got home, with some slippers and cotton mats laid out next to our beds, nice touch. 
The location of the hotel was good, but not fantastic, La Ramblas and the port were about a 30 minute walk away, as were the Picasso and Gaudi museums and we had to get a taxi which cost approx 13euros each way to the Nou Camp. However there was a lot of authentic Spanish bars, tapas bars and restaurants close to the hotel which we prefer to the tourist bars and restaurants anyway, so it was a bonus. The main shopping street was only a 5 minute walk as well, which is handy for those who go to Barcelona to shop.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would certainly stay there again.",4,2011,03,18
19,"Modern, Great Location, Can't go Wrong","The place is clean, modern, beautiful. The cab driver who took us there said it was the best hotel in Barcelona. It may be so, just don't expect to be as glitzy as the best hotel in NY or London. 

The service was ok. We were greeted by a very friendly guy at the front desk. A couple hours later, we came back to the desk to ask for information - I saw the same guy, smiled at him, and he acted like he had never seen me before. So they can be a little hot and cold - but my impression is that this is the case with the great majority of native Barcelonans. On this trip we also visited Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Monaco and we noticed that the people in Barcelona are the coldest by far. But, since Barcelona really is an amazing city, I think it is worth putting up with their attitude.

The rooftop restaurant is beautiful, but the one night we tried to go there we were in the mood for tapas and they don't have any, which was a bit shocking to me. It was a night we were particularly tired, but our craving for tapas was stronger than our laziness, so we went back to the front desk to ask for a recommendation. While we waited to speak to someone, the bell hop stepped up and asked if he could help us (he saw we had been waiting a long time and we were starting to get impatient). We figured why not, let's ask him. He gave us a great recommendation - a hopping tapas bar a couple of blocks away with only locals. We were lucky to get a table, mostly because there were only 2 of us we were willing to sit outside. It was the kind of place you need a reservation, yet the prices were good. I don't remember the name of the place, but perhaps the bell hop does :)",4,2011,03,09
19,Lovely boutique hotel in wonderful location,"We just returned from Barcelona where we stayed at the Claris for 6 nights.   The staff were friendly and helpful without being overly effusive.   We looked at several rooms before choosing a junior suite that was very quiet as the window was not over the street.  The bed was super comfortable.  At first I thought it would be too hard but it was great.   The hotel location enabled us to walk everywhere from the Eixample to Barcolonetta to Barri Gotic to Parc Guell etc.   The only time we took a taxi was when we went to Montguiic.   The only problem with the hotel was that you can hear flushing toilets and showers (both sounded like rain so not bad) but no noise from neighbors.   Rooms are nicely decorated, stylish, and comfortable.    I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,02,16
19,"Bra, men förväntade bättre...","Nice location, walking distance to several places of interest and tourist locations. Hotel room was hot as well as the floor I was in (5th). Small rooms, slightly out of date, but clean. The breakfast area was small. Nice and friendly staff!
Confortable bed. Very nice pool in the roof with sunbeds and a restaurant.",4,2011,02,13
19,Location and value make Claris a winner,"Stayed 5 nights taking advantage of Winter special posted on Travelzoo. Lots of good English speaking staff at front desk upon arrival and throughout our stay and helpful indeed. Interesting two level room separating bedroom/bathroom from living room mezzanine. Firm comfortable bed, spotless bathroom with high end toiletries updated frequently. Terrific breakfast with numerous and good buffet items and fresh eggs/omlets on request. One block from Passeig de Gracia and 3 blocks from Plaza Catalunya. Great shopping, restaurants, Gaudi buildings, subway, regional trains within a couple of blocks. What's not to like!?",4,2011,02,09
19,Find my luggage,"Upon Arrival, I realized ! had left one of my suitcases at another hotel in La Sue D'Guell, Spain.
The staff at the front desk ""was on it"".
My bag arrived the next day thanks to a great job by the front-desk staff.
Great rooftop spa, sauna, lounge chairs, etc. 
Well located hotel.",5,2011,02,09
19,Hot,"Claris hotel has a problem with the heat in the rooms.  My room (and my whole floor) was hot hot hot.  So hot that I was sweating before I went out in the morning, was sweating all night, and was uncomfortable in between.   You can open the window to combat this problem but then the noise off the street is extremely loud.  The staff told me there is no way for the system to reduce the heat and the air conditioning is turned off for the winter.  So... hot sweaty sleepless nights or cold noisy sleepless nights is your choice.   It was really noticeable and made it hard to relax during my downtime in my room.",3,2011,02,06
19,"Average 4* hotel, with a lot of faults","Was a good hotel few tears ago, now is just living from the old times memories, it really need a deep refubishment, the rooms, even if are clean, you dont feel comfortable, the bed is like a 3* hotel, internet is a disaster......",3,2011,02,05
19,Great Location but not  quite a 5 star experience,"The Hotel Claris is located in a prime area of Barcelona and within easy access to many of the main attractions this great city has to offer. If you are a fan of the work of Antonio Gaudi you will find Casa Batlo and Casa Mila within an easy walk of the Hotel and La Sagrada familia a short taxi ride away. As a family we were required to take out two rooms which were right next door to each other but not interconnecting as we were told this option is not an available configuration within the Hotel. Having to take two rooms made our 5 day stay considerably more expensive but after researching Hotels we chose The Claris hoping it had a ""WOW' factor.
 
I have to say that although the staff at The Claris were professional and seemingly well trained the Hotel's public areas,restaurants and accommodation should really only rate at a 4-4.5 star going by European standards.The rooms are adequate in size and moderately furnished - nothing luxurious though. Despite the ""dirty""  windows being double glazed  traffic and street noise can still be heard in the rooms facing the street especially in the early hours.The bathroom was spacious enough and there was a shower over a bath situation which was OK if you were able to climb in and out of the  large bathtub  - I would not recommend this though for elderly guests or young children. There was a nice arrangement of ""Derby Hotel"" toilettries on offer and bathrobes/slippers in the wardrobe if required.

I always expect 5 star properties to offer tea and coffee making facilities in the room for their guests but this was not available at The Claris - not even complimentary bottles of water. During our stay (January/winter) the rooms were extremely hot and despite having the air conditioner on the lowest setting we were uncomfortably warm at times. When I enquired about this we were told they were on ""set"" settings - doesn't really make sense!!

We only had breakfast once at the Hotel which was pleasant but pricey for what it was - the buffet was fairly standard with a few  cold chef prepared items to jazz it up and if you wanted something hot then it was made to order. Fresh orange juice and coffee was also available but it was served by the Restaurant staff so you had to wait for ""top ups"" rather than having the pot at your table which was a bit controlling for my liking.
We wanted to eat dinner at the hotel (although pricey) but the menu was just not that appealing or expansive enough to accommodate for the likes of our family. So, after enquiries at Reception we found an unreal Tappas Bar a few blocks away which was reasonable and delicious and we also ate on the Passage de Gracia just a block away from the Hotel most days for things like Pasta, Pizza, Tappas etc.

All in all we loved our stayed in Barcelona...the hop on hop off buses are a fantastic way to get around and the taxis also offer a terrific service. There is so much to see and do in this great Modernista city that you really must allow at least 2 full days to explore it's vast attractions.

Last note on The Claris - pleasant Hotel in a great location with professioanl staff but sadly it did not have the ""WOW"" factor I would expect from a 5 star Hotel in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World Group.If you want to stay here then make sure you get a great rate otherwise you may be disappointed with the cost v's value for money ratio.

PS. Unknowingly we also arrived on a special celebration day in Barcelona ""The Kings Parade"" . If the Hotel Manager had organised a nice letter to be placed in all guests rooms  advising them of this festival then we may have had the opportunity to attend this colourful parade. Also...the following day was a Public Holiday in Barcelona so apart from a few food outlets/cafes being open nearly everything else was closed!! Again, this information would have been welcomed at check in.",4,2011,02,01
19,TRULY A GREAT EXPERIENCE,"We traveled to Barcelona with great expectations and every one of them was met. The hotel location is terrific, staff marvelous,room clean and comfortable,roof top bar and garden a delight. We would go back in a moment and stay at the Claris. We loved Barcelona so much we have to return .",5,2011,01,29
19,Pleasant stay - hotel needs updating,"I have stayed in Derby Hotels before and liked them. I decided to splurge a bit on the Claris for this trip. While I had a pleasant stay, I don't think that the price differential between, e.g., the Astoria (about 60 euros) and the Claris (about 120) was represented good value for money spent. 

The Claris definitely has some pluses: the location is superb, the public areas of the hotel are stylish, and the staff I dealt with were very friendly and service-oriented. There are more amenities at the Claris than the Astoria (e.g., restaurant, bar, gym etc) and that no doubt is part of the reason for the price differential.

However, there were a few, somewhat less satisfactory elements.  First of all, the decor is a bit tired and dated - it needs refreshing, a coat of paint here and there, etc. Second, the bed was rock hard. (I like hard beds, but this was too hard for me.) Third, while there is a gym in the hotel, it is miniscule and fitted out with old machines. The single treadmill, for example, looked like the one I bought 2nd-hand 20 years ago. The rooftop room was cold (with no way I could see to turn on the heat).  I realize one generally doesn't stay at the Claris to use the gym, but if a hotel is going to offer a gym, it should keep the equipment up to date.

The pluses at this hotel outweigh the minuses, but as other reviewers have said, this isn't a 5* hotel in terms of luxury level, even if it does have the amenities typically associated with a higher-end hotel.  The next time I'm in Barcelona, I very likely will stay at a Derby Hotel - but one that offers better value for money spent.",3,2011,01,27
19,"Great Location! 5 Stars...?? Not sure, but still a good hotel","We stayed at Claris for a New Year city break. Overall we had a very nice stay and would certainly recommend the hotel to our friends.
Now the break down.

Location

The location of this hotel could not be better.  Within 200m of a station with direct train links to the airport and within 100m of one of the main roads in the city linking to the centre.  Hotel to middle of town, 10-15 minutes walk. Location, perfect.

Service.

When we checked in the staff were lovely.  They welcomed us and we were in our room in no time.  Apart from that we had little interaction with the reception staff.  The hotel doormen were always ready with a smile.  We did not really ask for anything of them so not much to comment on. We drank at the bar (a couple of times) and ate at restaurant (once) and the bar man and waiting staff were very helpful and friendly.

Room.

We stayed in a duplex suite (on a special rate from a well know website offering late booking on rooms). This was very well appointed but showing signs of wear in places.  There was road noise at times but did not detract from the overall experience.  There was a very good shower and toiletries and a turn down service on the first night made us feel very welcome, (flower in room, note from manager welcoming us). After that this service was always done, but lacked that first night personal touch. 

Food and drink.

We drank at the bar next to reception a couple of times and found the barman to be very friendly and attentive. Prices were, as one would expect, not the cheapest. We ate at the restaurant on the 7th floor one evening and it was very pleasant.  The food was good, the wine selection extensive and a very enjoyable atmosphere.  The service was very good. 

Summary

We enjoyed our stay at Claris and would recommend it to our friends.  Perfect location (could not be better in any way) and a satisfactory level of service for what we asked of them.  We are glad however that we were not paying the full rate for the room but overall we had a very nice stay.",4,2011,01,23
19,"Good, but not great!","We stayed at the Hotel Claris from the 15th January 2011 for seven nights in order to explore the City.   The hotel is located one block from Passeig de Gracia where there is an excellent selection of regular and high-end retail stores as well as numerous bars and restaurants.   The hotel is well positioned for the Barri Gotic and also the districts of Eixample and Gracia.  It is quite feasible to walk to the waterfront but it took us around half an hour to do so.  Placa de Catalunya is located at the top of La Rambla and if you are visiting for just the weekend and want “tourist Barcelona” this might be a more convenient location.  The area around the Hotel Claris is quieter and perfectly pleasant with plenty of shops, bars, and restaurants close by.  It felt very safe to us both day and night.  We did not eat at the hotel restaurant purely because there is a staggering choice of venues in the City.  We would recommend Josephine’s (directly opposite) and the Vinoteca wine bar and shop, which is a five-minute walk north on Pau Claris - small but serves its own excellent wines and the best tapas that we found all week - highly recommended!    As for the Claris, we found the staff very attentive and helpful and the majority had some English.  The common parts to the hotel are maintained to a very high standard, namely the reception, bar, restaurant, corridors, roof terrace and pool.   The hotel’s East 47 bar was quiet during our stay, and whilst a little small it was perfectly comfortable.  We stayed in a junior suite at the Claris which was a good size with a separate seating area.  The television had a reasonable number of channels in various languages but screen size and picture quality were not great.  The suite was comfortable enough and quiet but unfortunately the bathroom was disappointing.  The shower and bath were combined, and not well maintained.  The bath had lost its enamel finish around the plug and drain holes, and really looked quite tatty.  Some of the surrounding tiling and grouting was also discoloured.  The shower is mounted behind a fixed glass screen and we suspect it was not always cleaned as it should be, as to do so would have required standing or kneeling in the bath.   Overall we enjoyed our stay, but on the basis of our suite (and in particular the bathroom) that 5th star that the Hotel claims is, in our opinion, wishful thinking.",4,2011,01,23
19,Nice hotel but not a 5*,"We stayed in this hotel on a special offer, which included an upgrade to a duplex and breakfast.  Our room was nice, albeit rather tired decor wise, inlcuding holes in curtains.  Had we not been upgraded I would not have gone for the duplex as we didn't use the sofa area.  Whilst our room was at the back and quiet we did hear a lot of noise from the other rooms despite the hotel information saying that the rooms were soundproofed.

There were some 5* touchs such as having robes and slippers, beds turned down and lots of complimentary toiletries, but overall I don't think it warrents being a 5* - we have stayed in 4* hotels in Barcelona which I think are much better.

The location is good and the roof top is fab, albeit the swimming pool area is quite small.

Breakfast was very good although we found we had to continuously ask staff for more coffee, a cooked breakfast etc - I would have thought  for 5* we would not have to had done this.

The receception staff were quite helpful and friendly but they were not aware that the airport bus no longer goes up the Passeig de Gracia and could not tell us bus numbers for the buses outside the hotel (minor thing but all adds up).

Overall whilst a nice hotel there are better in Barcelona from my experience so I would probably not stay here again.",3,2011,01,16
19,Lovely hotel in great location.,"This was a great hotel, especially for first time in Barcelona. The rooms were spacious and very clean and comfortable. Loved the various bath salts. The staff was very kind, especially the folks at the front door, bellmen and maids (front desk very efficient and helpful). I loved our view but there is some street noise - not excessive but too much to leave windows open at night. My friend's room was inside so no view but quiet. We never ate in hotel - breakfast pricey ( 23 Eurosbut who knows...might have been great). Anyway, Josephine's across the street was perfect for coffee and rolls. Computers for guest use though I used internet which cost 15Euro a day...would be nice for that to be free someday. The pool on the roof is lovely and it was a great place to sit and have tea. We got a great price on our rooms and it was more than worth it. EAsy walking distance to everything and cabs and train stop for everything else! We had a few issues with wrong billing on final bill but staff fixed same quickly and with no hassle.",5,2011,01,15
19,"This was a terrific hotel; staff was over-the-top good, the place was spotless and we totally enjoyed our stay.",Could not have been better.  My tip would be to just put your wishes in front of the staff and let them arrange whatever you want to do.,5,2011,01,12
19,Claris Hotel 5 Star!!!!!,"My husband surprised me back in 2002 and took me to Barcelona for valentines day.  We stayed here at the Claris Hotel.

It is goooooorgeous! The service is amazing, the room was a little snug but very luxurious!  Would love to go back and stay there again.  

Highly recommend it.",5,2011,01,10
19,"Charming hotel, helpful staff","We stayed there over the new year , the hotel is in the center of the city yet just a block off the main P. de Gracia street , close to everything yet away from the noise pollution . we had a lovely duplex suite that is highly recommended. The rooms do need some maintenance but any negative point was compensated by the staff , Victoria (guest relations) was superb , and Luciano (the Argentinean bellhop) was brilliant with his suggestions and so helpful .",4,2011,01,07
19,"Front Desk RUDE, Management RUDE, Ran Credit Card as CASH.","For Dec 26-29, we stayed at Claris Hotel in Barcelona.  Our stay was an great experience until the last morning at check-out. 

When we checked in, we were greeted by a front desk attendant, who informed us that breakfast was complimentary and served between 7:00 and 11:00. Upon reviewing our bill, however, we noticed a charge totaling 84 EUR (approx. $112.00) that was for 4 breakfasts . When we questioned the front desk attendant (a different individual than the one who checked us in) about these charges, he told us breakfast was not complimentary and ridiculed us for not reading the Claris Hotel website more carefully. We attempted to explain to him what we had been told upon checking-in and were met with additional rude and disrespectful comments. He never offered an apology for the confusion, despite the fact that the gentleman told us - in English - that breakfast was complimentary. Because we did not desire to continue dealing with this individual, we presented our credit card for payment.

After giving the attendant a credit card to pay for the room, he informed us the card had been declined. We explained that there was plenty of credit on that card, but were met with - once more - a rude and condescending attitude. Because there were numerous people attempting to check in at that time - and we had already been humiliated enough - a different card was presented for payment. As we knew would happen, after leaving the hotel and checking with the credit card company, we were informed there was ample room on the first (allegedly declined) card to cover the stay. We were also informed that the attendant RAN THE CARD AS A CASH TRANSACTION rather than a credit for some inexplicable reason. Had he run the card as a credit card, as requested, the entire experience would have been avoided. Additionally, he failed to inform us that he was running the card as a cash transaction; had he done so, we could have corrected him and, once more, avoided the embarrassment and hassle of this situation.

The real shame of the aforementioned experiences is that - up until this morning.  And because of this, we are sad.  As it stands now, after being treated the way we were, we will not only never stay at Claris Hotel-Barcelona again (or a Derby Hotel for that matter), but we will also never recommend this hotel to our friends and family.

Lastly, when we emailed the hotel an explanation of everything that afternoon after checking with our credit card company, his response was embarrasing to the hotel industry.  I have NEVER been treated like that by a hotel you spend $1000.00 with over 4 days.  I was disgusted.  

Sleep Qualtiy is 0 because the ""Sound Proof"" windows are really not so...the street noise is so loud.

The ""Business Center"" had TWO computers and neither of them worked.  The internet shut down ALL the time and the mouse on one wouldn't work.  When we asked the front desk about this, they really didn't do anything other than give us a card (reluctantly and as if we were annoying them) for free wifi for 30 minutes in our room.  This hotel also did NOT have free wifi which many others do.",1,2011,01,03
19,"Very good hotel, excellent service!","Very pleasant surprise! Excellent staff! Modern, clean interior. The breakfast was very good.",4,2011,01,01
19,Helped me when I was sick--wonderful staff,"I arrived at the hotel after getting sick on a cruise.  The staff was so helpful, particularly the waiter in the breakfast room, Jimmy, who got me soup and made me feel better when I was really feeling ill.  The hotel is beautiful and they made me some special room service.  I'm just sorry that I couldn't enjoy the lovely hotel and Barcelona.  But the service--whether you are ill or well--is excellent.  Thank you Hotel Claris staff!",5,2010,12,24
19,Perfect spot in Barcelona,"We spent five wonderful days at Hotel Claris. We loved everything about it, from the architecture and decor of the hotel, to the friendly and helpful staff, the ideal location, the quiet elegance, the charming rooftop pool and lounge, and the delicious breakfast. During the planning stages, I had read some comments in  on Tripadvisor that concerned me but after emailing the hotel, I was reassured and decided to stay there. That turned out to be a wonderful decision. It was just perfect.",5,2010,12,06
19,"Claris, Barcelona Hotel - Excellent in Every Way!","On our recent triip to Barcelona, we stayed six nights at the Claris.  In a great location - within walking distance to most of the sights we planned to take in - i.e. Casa Batllo, Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, etc.  The hotel staff was very welcoming and very helpful in every way.  The concierge recommended restaurants and was very much on the mark.  The room was immaculate and in great condition.  The overall impression of the hotel was remarkable.  Upon check-in we were offered tickets to the Egyptian Museum and complimentary Cava for later that day.  We would not hesitate to stay at the Claris on future trips.",5,2010,11,28
19,Excellent Hotel,The hotel was excellent overall....the staff were friendly and very helpful. The rooms were impeccable and the food was excellent. The hotel is also perfectally situated near many of the key sites and world class shopping.,5,2010,11,22
19,Lovely hotel with excellent staff!,"Ive just come back from a three night stay at the lovely Claris hotel and had such a great stay I felt inspired to write a review immediatly! All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, they were able to give us information and directions of all local attractions and ensured we had a comfortable stay. The hotel itself was luxurious, the entrance is very attractive. Our standard room was large with a spacious bathroom, comfortable bed and all the amenities a room needs apart from a dressing table mirror (which would have made it perfect!) The only other slight complaint is that we had to wait over an hour after check-in to get into our room (although the free bubbly on arrival made up for it!) We had breakfast included in our room rate and were impressed that the cooked breakfast was cooked to order. The location  was good, close enough to the action but not too close. I would love to go back to this hotel its brilliantly designed and the staff's excellent customer service skills are the icing on the cake!",5,2010,11,16
19,"Good location, some staff excellent, some not?!","We spent 4 days in Barcelona, before travelling south. Fab location for all restos, shops etc, and rooms good. Most staff in hotel good - namely reception staff, bar staff and doorman/concierge- however, breakfast waitresses were rude, impatient and generally awful!
Considering we were a party of six, in 3 rooms, spending a significant amount, this was a definite disappointment to us. 
We are returning to Barcelona in January- hotel Claris was good but our custom may go elsewhere- purely because of bad manners from their breakfast staff. Seems such a shame ?!?

19,very good hotel,luxury design hotel and very helpful and nice staff. Excellent breakfast and location.Some criticisms are very hard with this hotel. I would recommand it definitely,5,2010,11,02
19,"Great Hotel, would stay there again","The staff were excellent and were extremely helpful.  We were there during the strike and the staff were able to change our train tickets to Madrid and re-book us for a train the following day.  The room was comfortable and quite.  The location was close to resturants and the metro.  The morning breakfast was very good.  

The afternoon of the strike we stayed in the hotel and used the pool and bar on the top of the hotel.  We were able to waive to the strikers as they passed the hotel.

The only downside is the resturant on the top of the hotel.  We ate there once on Sunday night and the service was so so.",5,2010,10,27
19,what a fabulous place from which to experience Barcelona,"Tthe Claris is a beautiful, charming modern hotel with an ideal location in Barcelona...a short walk to fabulous shopping, dining,architectural wonders and all the ""must see"" cultural neighborhoods.  The staff of the hotel is extremely attentive, helpful and very knowledgeable about all the aspects of the city that any visitor might need assistance with.  The roof-top bar and restaurant is an added bonus for the weary tourist or shopper---a great way to end the day!",5,2010,10,26
19,Great value for money,"My wife and I stayed at the Claris for a week. The location is so convenient that we were able to walk everywhere in Barcelona, yet it was away from the hordes of tourists that throng places like La Rambla. Paseig de Gracia is a block away and there are numerous restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk.

The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. There was always someone on duty who spoke good English. This is a small hotel but we were not looking for American hotel style amenities. There is a restaurant and bar, including a rooftop bar inside the hotel.

The room was small but functional and exquisitely clean. Maid service was prompt and meticulous. Because of the small hotel size, the inside noise in the hotel was minimal. Outside noise was a problem. Our room faces the busy Pau Claris and there was traffic noise well into the night. It may be quieter on the opposite side.",4,2010,10,25
19,Not a 5-star hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Claris earlier this month. The main snafu occurred at check-in which unfortunately tainted the remainder of our experience there.  I am pregnant and had requested a no-smoking room. We were shown up to our 'non-smoking' room which reeked of cigerette smoke. I mentioned this to the receptionist who had shown us up there and she made a phone-call to the lobby and asked us to wait in the room while they figured out an alternative room for us. So far so good. Five minutes later we were called by the lobby and asked to come downstairs where we saw the another receptionist yelling at the lady who had shown us to our room saying that she shouldn't have told us to stay in that room because ''now we will have to clean that room!!!' All in plain view of us! And to make matters worse  another receptionist told us very matter-of-factly,  that 'yes, that was a smoking room. Now we will have to wait for a non-smoking room. Which could take another hour.'  No apology!!  My husband and I decided to wait in the lobby for our room. I want to note that I was visibly 7 months pregnant and a 5-star hotel would be a little more accommodating rather than have us wait for hours in their lobby. Its the little things that count and unfortunately the service at this hotel is sub-par.

One annoying thing  was the lack of free wireless internet. In the year 2010 I really do not understand why the Claris is charging for it. Initially I thought it was a  Europe thing but I have stayed at plenty of hotels in Europe (a lot that are 5star) that offer free wireless. 

Moving onto the hotel. The hotel itself is nice . It is a small boutique hotel with a lot of trendy pieces of art being displayed. It is a block off Passeig de Gracia so its not that noisy. The rooms are a decent size, uncarpeted with a lot of wooden furniture. Nice bathroom with slippers, a bathrobe, hairdryer etc. There is a rooftop pool with a bar area around it that is quite nice. There is also complimentary coffee or tea that is delivered in the morning. Unfortunately the coffee was provided without milk so I would hold out and get my morning coffee from one of the cafes outside. Its in a good location-with most of the sights within the walking distance plus there is a taxi stand right outside the hotel so it was always easy to get a taxi.

I do want to to say that the concierge we spoke to (Maureen) was lovely. She recommended some great restaurants, helped us make reservations and was generally super helpful. Also the white-jacketed doormen were very gracious, always smiling and ready to call you a taxi.

Overall, its a good hotel, just not great. A 5-star hotel must provide exceptional service which unfortunately the Hotel Claris failed to do in our case. While not all the receptionists were unfriendly, the few that were (especially those involved with our check-in) made it a less than satisfactory experience for us.",3,2010,10,24
19,All-Round Excellence,"If you want a 5* hotel that is in an ideal location, has exceptional service and great views of the city then I cannot recommend a better hotel...

My friends and I took a duplex suite which was extremely comfortable and spacious. Bathrooms are of a good size and there is plenty of cupboard space (walk-in wardrobe). I'm not sure what the other rooms are like but I do recommend staying in a duplex suite.

The hotel itself gives off a boutique feel; the hotel lobby is very contemporary and filled with unique pieces of art, reminding you of what Barcelona is famous for. There is also a chic bar on the rooftop which offers a stunning view of Mt. Tibidabo.

All the hotel staff are very friendly and extremely quick and efficient when it comes to meeting guest's demands; Room Service would arrive within 10 minutes of placing an order. Similarly, housekeeping would deal with any problems within 5 minutes of addressing an issue (unlike most hotels where you would have to wait at least 20 minutes for someone from housekeeping to come up to your room). 

All in all I was very happy with the Hotel and it made our trip to Barcelona all the more worthwhile. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,10,21
19,Outstanding Barcelona adventure,"Am writing this from my room. I read mixed reviews here before I booked the trip for three nights as a side trip from our original destination of Madrid. I must say the hotel and entire staff including the room cleaners, concierge, waiters, front desk, etc. provided outstanding service. Also, very, very cool hotel with art and all amenities, excellent room. Highly recommend.",5,2010,10,18
19,Beautiful hotel,"Great location, beautiful hotel and attentive staff for a great price! Roof top pool didn't have enough seating though so we didn't even get to get to enjoy it but did get have a few delicious drinks there. Had  a problem one night with dining at the restaurant hotel as the wait staff didn't want to seat us because we didn't have reservations and the restaurant was half empty, even though we were told by the concierge that we didn't need them. Finally the hotel manager came in and fixed the problem which was very nice of him. I would definitely go back",4,2010,10,17
19,excellent location,"Clean, polite, responsive but not too warm. The room was nice and the bathroom was excellent. T.V. had too few English channels. Pay for view channels were too expensive. One local phone call cost 4 euros, seems a bit excessive. Excellent breakfast. Local eatery, PALERMO, had inexpensive, authentic and low cost food with no or few tourists.",5,2010,10,14

It is a small boutique hotel with a great roof terrace which has a pool, bar and restaurant. The hotel is about 10 mins walk from Placa de la Catalunya and the rooms were pretty decent too - bathrobes, slipper etc... It's not quite a 5 star but for that price, I would definitely go back!",4,2010,10,07
19,Great location.,Arrived after long train journey from pamplona and was just about to embark on another epic one between Barcelona and Paris. Hotel itself is reasonably trendy and lots of smiles from staff when checking in. There seemed to be a fair mix of guests there when I was checking in. Pool and roof top restaurant were not used by me so couldn't comment. I had read all reviews on here prior to staying and while I would say that it wasn't  the quietest hotel that I've ever stayed in it wasn't deafingly loud either. I would stay again because of its location and staff smiles.,4,2010,10,03
19,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,"First time in Barcelona and we hit the jack pot - Hotel was brilliant , excellent location,  wonderful room, beautiful breakfast buffet and a roof terrace not to be missed. Hope to be back some day!!",5,2010,09,30
19,Does not live up to 5 star grade,"We stayed at the Claris Hotel for my Partners 40th Birthday, I did plenty of research on hotels before booking the Claris Hotel and decided on the hotel because of its great location and entry into 'Small Leading Hotels of  the World'.

Unfortunately the hotel does not live up to its 5 star rating.  Check in was all fine and staff friendly but on entering the room we were very disappointed, it had very standard furniture, and quite old fashioned bathroom with pink marble walls flooded everytime the shower was used,  the whole room could have done with a lick of paint too!!  The beds were unbelievably hard and my partner did leave with a bad back.

On the first night we requested an iron to be delivered, the first one had a frayed wire and large black mark on bottom, the 2nd had no steam facility and very small at the 3rd time of trying they got it right! 

There is no concierge service in this hotel so everything is done through reception, normally in a five star hotel the concierge has lots of knowledge and connections to leading restaurants etc and can make reservations very late but this does not happen at the Claris.

Breakfast was ok, buffet style was fine with a short menu of cooked items to choose from.  One morning my partner chose scrambled egg, when this arrived I would swear it was powdered egg, it certainly looked and tasted like it!!

The cost of this hotel compares with The Baglioni Hotel in London (which we stayed in 18 mths ago, and was fantastic), the location in a large city is also comparible and also both 5 star, The Claris does not live up to any expectations that we had of a 5 star hotel in a city location.

The location of this hotel and the friendliness of SOME of the staff is the only thing, in our opinion, this hotel has going for it.  Incidentally the 'famous' white coated doorman was only spotted once in our whole stay of 3 nights the rest of the time the doorman was dressed in black polo t shirt and black trousers.",3,2010,09,21
19,where's the luxury? Only found attached to hotel name,"Extraordinary location for a hotel that seemed had better times not long ago, but there is no anymore worth of the “Great luxury” label.
The members of staff we deal with (reception ladies and breakfast room waiters) were professional, attentive and caring. 
Standard double is a good size room with a king (very comfortable) bed, two-door-closet, sofa, tea table, carpet and LCD tv-set. 
The pieces of furniture are announced at arty ones, quite well maintained (not obviously brand new) and beautiful in a classic, sublet way.
Bathroom let them down a bit, as it is quite old fashioned, with all this pink marble, bath tube instead of shower cabin and small size. 
Breakfast is fine, with a fair but short continental and cooked selection. Orange juice was good the very first day and not so next (did they run out of oranges?) but coffee is awful.
Roof pool is a joke, more a puddle that anything else. There is only 4 sun bench available, so in a hotel with 120 rooms … just make your maths. Although there was live music on Fr & Sa, we didn’t stay for a drink up in the roof: it is small,  lighting is not inviting and in essence there wasn’t any reason to stay over. 
Small things make the different and here is where hotel fails miserably: the mentioned undrinkable coffee, the frayed bathrobes (if you are not providing a wearable ones, just don’t provide any), the lack of any amenities that can be consider different, special or real value against cheaper  4* options…. In essence you don’t appreciate for a single second what you’re in a boasted 5* GL. 
If looking forward for  the luxury experience don’t show up. There is no any.",4,2010,09,14
19,Beware of terrible beds,"The beds gave both of us sore backs every morning- the were hard like a sofa and short. 

The last night a private party was being held on the pool level with a singer who was very loud. When we called down to complain, they said it was a private party and there was nothing they could do about it- really?

Would not book again. ",3,2010,09,06
19,A great stay in Barcelona,"This is my fifth stay in Barcelona and my third in this hotel which I stay in for two or three days as a treat after a few weeks holidaying on the cheap in a basic resort. The first impression of the hotel is coming in from outside Barcelona's hot summer weather into a reception area that's cool in two senses: Refreshingly cool temperaturewise, but also a cool blend of modern design and ancient roman and egyptian artefacts. The staff don't mess about getting you into your room which, provided its ready, is done prompty. We got an upgrade for the second time and they recognised us even though our previous stay was five years before. The pool at the top of the hotel is great, as is the nice bar/restaurant beside it. The exercise room is small but adequate. The staff are freindly and the interior design of the rooms, corridors and even the lift and interal atrium are all great. The location of the hotel is also very good. You are two minutes away from the Paseig de Gracia (the main drag) and so have the benefit of avoiding the traffic and high prices of hotels directly on it, but also of the lower prices. The nearby bar ""Les Gens qui J'aime"" is not to be missed for a dreamy late night drink in a mysterious setting. Neither are the restaurants ""Can Culleteres"" or ""Les Quinz Nits"" near and on, respectively, the Placa Real.",5,2010,09,01
19,Claris hotel - a lovely hotel for those who don't need to show off,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who said it was not a 5 star hotel.  It is, although not in a big flashy way like the Majestic.  Its beauty is in the details -the complimentary glass of cava on the terrace when we arrived, the bathrobe and slippers, the maid who turned down the bedding after we arrived, the works of art around the hotel, the Egyptian artifacts displayed on the first floor, the complimentary ticket to the Egyptian Museum down the road (worth about 18 Euros) and so on.  This is a very understated, calm hotel for people who enjoy a quieter luxury stay.    

The room was about average size for Europe and contained everything we needed, tastefully decorated.  The bed, while enormous, was the only thing I would have changed, as the mattress was firmer than I'd have chosen.  We were on the 4th floor, facing the street, but with the blinds down there was very little noise outside.  I particularly liked the two sets of doors in the room, which meant that any sounds from the the bathroom or outside corridor were unlikely to disturb you if you were sleeping.

The hotel is in Eixample, an elegant 19thC neighbourhood, and is just around the corner from 2 Gaudi buildings and a block away from Passeig de Gracia station, which takes you straight to the airport.  (You'll appreciate this even more if you have an early flight.)  I found the character of the neighbourhood changed dramatically between the weekend, when it had a quiet residential air, and the Monday, when all these interesting local shops and businesses opened up that we hadn't even realised were there.  

The hotel is well situated if you don't mind not being in the centre of Barcelona's touristy bits - in fact, we walked all over Barcelona and only felt the need to get the metro once, although I would suggest that anyone with mobility issues either gets taxis or stays closer to the cathedral.  If you're the average adult, however, it's a fairly easy walk to Las Ramblas and Sagrada Familia and if the walk down to the port/beach is longer, well, we found it helpful as we were eating far too much and this gave us an excuse to justify it.  Personally, I found it pleasant to wander through the Gothic quarter but then to be able to retreat to our quieter streets after the hustle and bustle of the tourist crowd.  The restaurants in this neighbourhood, while not as numerous as in streets closer to Placa de Catalunya, were also less likely to be tourist traps.  (Be sure to try Cervezeria Catalanya, which is on Carrer de Mallorca, but get there early as by 8.30pm it was so full with a mixture of locals and tourists that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.  It was worth it, though.)

Back to the hotel - the staff were fantastic, particularly Guillermo, Victoria, Alfonso and a young women who was in training.  We had a great recommendation for Cervezeria Catalanya from Guillermo and another group of guests were very vocal in their praise for another restaurant they had been recommended.  The reception staff were friendly, personable and at no point were we made to feel anything but welcome.  The chambermaid was great too.  The bar staff seemed slightly standoffish, which was a shame as it didn't really feel in keeping with the rest of the hotel, but perhaps that was because it was busy when we went there.    

This was a wonderful place to stay and I would definitely recommend it to friends.",5,2010,09,01
19,Lovely hotel - just lacking in a few basics,"From the moment we arrived we were very well treated by the hotel - they greeted us by name, took our bags up to the rooms while we were checking in, showed us how everything worked and then made sure that we had everything we needed.  The rooms were a decent size (we had a standard double and a standard twin), if lacking in some of the basics that I'd expect in an English hotel - there were only a few hangers in the wardrobe, no tea and coffee facilities (though you could order complimentary tea or coffee to your room between 5:30 and 6:45am) and that bath was very small.
The rooms were turned over 3 times a day; once in the morning, just before siesta (if you were out) and then in the evening and the housekeeping staff were always helpful and friendly.
We didn't eat in the hotel as we felt it was too expensive (breakfast was 22 Euro) and there were so many great value eateries nearby - try La Rita one block south, which has great food at really reasonable prices.
The pool was lovely to relax in, though the space was very small and we were only able to secure a couple of sun loungers on one occasion during our 5 day stay.
The only issue we had during our stay was a faulty safe, which couldn't be opened until the hotel manager came with her master override code.  She was very quick to come and sort the problem, was very apologetic and left a letter for us when we checked out offering us a superior room upgrade for our next visit.
A lovely hotel, but if you don't want to pay an arm and a leg for food; take a travel kettle and visit the small convenience store 3 blocks south on Pau Claris for milk, fruit and brioche.",4,2010,08,30

19,"A beautiful hotel with uneven service, the Claris needs to better train its staff.","When my wife booked the room at the Claris for a week long stay for a combination of business and leisure, she requested a king size bed and received an email confirmation, but after we checked in we were brought up to a room with two twin beds.  The front desk said that they were fully booked and could not change our room that night, but to try again the next day.  There was no apology or attempt to compensate us.  The next morning, a  man at the front desk informed us that there were still no doubles available with a king bed.  One of his colleagues looked up and said that yes, there was one available, which they gave us.  In a week long stay, rarely did they greet us in reception.  In fact, the reception staff was usually unsmiling, surly, and unwilling to assist.  And we both speak Spanish fluently, having lived in Barcelona, so language was not a problem. It is a beautiful hotel, with an amazing rooftop pool deck and restaurant, but with prices starting at several hundred dollars a night, the staff should be bending over backwards to serve  the hotel guests.  The Claris was once known for its service, but those days seem to be gone.  The management needs to retrain its staff.",3,2010,08,27
19,"Beautiful, well priced, well situated!","One block from the action, this oasis is a great bargain. The rooms are on the small side but provide every sense of a luxury hotel. The service is lovely and food is spectacular. The breakfast was included and is both a buffet and made to order. It is the prettiest presented buffet I have ever seen. Pool on roof top with bar adjacent. I would stay again.",5,2010,08,25
19,Claris Perfection Again,"this was our 3rd trip to the Claris in a year and we were recognised by the doorman Pablo, a nice touch, he is so helpful.
They upgraded us which was nice to a duplex room froma standard. The restaurant always provides a surprise on the menu and service is always of high standard. Go there expecting to spend money, on food and wine and you'll have a good time.

Pool remains the key part, small but confortable, with service all day why move..",4,2010,08,25
19,"Wonderful Staff, Location, Amenities....You will be Pleased!!!","Excellent location,staff, breakfast, room,pool, rooftop terrace!!!!!

From the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming, friendly, helpful...always asking if we had a nice day touring or if there was anything they could do for us.  The hotel itself is fun and nicely laid out, with a refreshing  rooftop pool and terrace. Though sometimes difficult to find a  poolside lounge, there were always seats or comfortable sofa options. Breakfast was delicious, with many superior  fruit, cereal, veggie, egg ,pastry, yogurt options. The staff was always refreshing our cafe and juice cups.  The rooms are large by European standards and though  a bit worn, the size more then overcame that minor issue.  Also our rooms were near the lift so until you fell asleep there was a background hum. Not a big problem relative to this great stay.  The location is excellent, a quick walk to the Passeig de Gracia, a beautiful upscale  shopping street and very near a couple of Gaudi sites, and Metro but far from noise.  La Ramblas is 10 min. walk anyway.   Excellent turn down service at night and always fresh towels  when we returned  after dinner.  Wonderful  overall !!!!!",5,2010,08,24
19,Interesting choice of hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Claris in August 2010. The main reason we chose this hotel is because the Manager genuinely seems to care what people think of his hotel (see other reviews here and replies from the Manager). Really nice touch on his part. We had an issue when we checked in and further to a complaint made to Reception, we found a complimentary bottle of wine, glasses, cork screw and chocolates in our room, with a note from the Manager... again nice touch. Staff on the whole were very good actually. Rooftop bar and restaurant excellent. Shame the other hotel restaurant and bar are shut in the summer though. Pool on rooftop way too small... only accommodates a handful of people at any one time. We were in a standard room which was a little tatty around the edges. Good central position though. Hotel expensive as it's a 5 star. However, in my opinion, the Hotel Claris is no more than a 4 star hotel... with a 5 star hotel Manager.",3,2010,08,17
19,Very nice and convenient,"My wife and I stayed in Claris for a weekend. The hotel is perfectly located, one block away from to metro/bus station, with practically everything within walking distance. We wanted to stay away from the Ramblas and street noise and still be downtown. The Claris was a perfect choice, we could not hear a whisper from our room. We took the smallest kind of room available and liked it a lot. It is modern, cozy and spotless. We saw other larger rooms, really beautifuly ones, to be considered if you have money to spend. The terrace is also an asset.",4,2010,08,16
19,"Nice upscale hotel...but ""snooty"" staff.","My wife and I stayed at the Claris Hotel for three nights while in Barcelona recently, one night prior to a cruise and then two nights following our return from the cruise.  As previous reviewers have said, this is a very nice boutique style hotel with upscale “Euro” amenities.  

Positives:  

1)  One of the strong points of this hotel is the breakfast (make sure to get a package where this is included with your rate) which is buffet style offering a very nice assortment of hot and cold items.  Unlike the front desk staff (see below), the wait staff in the breakfast area (located in the basement area but nicely appointed) were very courteous and attentive. 

2)  Location – if you aren’t averse to walking several blocks, the Claris is within 10 to 20 minutes walking time from many Gaudi sites as well as La Ramblas and the port restaurants and shops.  We ate several times on La Ramblas, once down at the port, and once across from Casa Batllo and had a comfortable walk to and from all of these areas.  Of course, taxis are plentiful too if you choose.  The hotel is north of La Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya so you are away from the crowds until you choose to venture down to those areas.

3) Claris Hotel has a nice rooftop terrace and pool as well as a rooftop restaurant.  I can’t speak to the restaurant as we didn’t eat there however we did have a few drinks while lounging up next to the pool and that was nice.  We happened to be staying at Hotel Claris on the night of the World Cup finals and ended up watching the entire match in a viewing room the hotel had set up next to the restaurant.  Wanting to avoid the huge crowds on the streets, it was nice to still be able to join in the spirit of the finals without venturing out.

4)  The rooms themselves were fine – we stayed in two different rooms, each with a King bed and couch.  We had a slightly larger room our second and third nights that had a view out the front of the hotel and this room had a raised area for the bed and step down “separate” sitting area which lead to the exit hallway and bathroom.  The bathrooms were large by European standards and there was plenty of closet space.  A safe was provided although the instructions were a bit confusing (again, see below).  Noise was not too bad while in these rooms but they were typical of big city hotels where you can hear sirens, horns, street noise, etc. 

5)  There is a taxi parking area right across the street which is very convenient. 

Negatives:

1) The front desk staff seemed aloof and was not very customer oriented.  As we entered the hotel, no one at the front desk even acknowledged us with a greeting.  I finally went up to the counter and after a moment, an employee looked up and I actually greeted that person first!  We just felt it was poor customer relations.  They weren’t rude necessarily, just not welcoming.  Even the manager acted perturbed when we had to have our in-room safe reopened.  We were unfamiliar with this type of safe, had mistakenly locked it, and were just asking for help but this seemed to be an inconvenience to the manager.  My wife said he even “rolled” his eyes behind my back when I asked for a quick demo of how to work the safe again.  Very unnecessary to act this way, we felt, and maybe this attitude spread down to his employees.  

2)  We never saw a concierge the whole time we were there although there seemed to be a concierge desk.  The front desk personnel did help us with directions when asked and so we found our way to the nearest Barcelona tourist information site for assistance with tours, etc.

3) Pay for use internet – an upscale hotel like this should provide free internet to the customers, in my opinion.

4)  The elevators were very small - my wife and I had to take separate elevators when we headed down with our bags.  Any group larger than 3 people has to take separate elevators so not too family friendly in that respect. 

Overall, an above average hotel experience but due to the “cold shoulder” from the front desk staff and the one manager we encountered, we probably would try a different hotel next time as there are many comparable hotels in Barcelona.  I would think with the amount of competition in this city, pleasant customer relations would be a priority.",4,2010,08,06
19,Fabulous Hotel,"We just returned from a trip to Barcelona and the Algarve in Portugal.
In Barcelona, we stayed at the Claris for four nights.
The hotel was one of the best I have ever stayed in.
The room was nicely sized, fine for two persons and bigger than typical small European hotel rooms. The entire hotel is very nicely furnished. It's sort of a boutique hotel, but not too trendy. In fact, the stylings were just right.
Breakfast was far better than we expected. It was served on white tablecloths,  with waiters pouring steaming hot coffee. The buffet included fresh fruits, cereals, delicious freshly baked goods, and you could order cooked to order eggs or omelettes from the kitchen. This was all included in  the base room price.
The rooftop pool and deck were marvelous to hang out on and swim in on the hot July afternoons. 
The service was excellent.
I have nothing negative to say.
Go.",5,2010,07,22
19,stay away,"there was a room, but with the swimming pool on the roof very NOISY all day long.
there was a roof swimming pool, but with VERY dirty water,
there was a breakfast, but in the basement instead of on the roof
there a was a bath, but dirty 
there was a TV, but with pay movies only 
there wa a fitness room, but small and dirty 

the staff is very young, but unfortunetely very unsure.

I suggest to go to this hotel only if you are in barcelona with no other options.

trust me.",1,2010,07,19
19,Near to Casa Mila and Casa Batlo,"If you like Egypt style, this chould be a good choice.  Very well design common area and pool, spacious room - just I don't really prefer the dark brown colour theme in my standard room.   view from the pool is nice but was closed when i was there in March.",4,2010,07,08
19,Location and roof-top pool are winners,"Got upgraded from a duplex to a suite - cost me about €310 for two nights. Room was fab, staff polite and attentive. Rooftop pool / terrace is a great place to unwide before venturing out in the evening. Maybe not fully 5*, but excellent value all things considered - couldn't fault it.",4,2010,06,07
19,Disappointing in so many ways,"The hotel was small and had a lovely roof-top pool.  However, the room was not carefully checked before we arrived - the internet wasn't working, one TV was not working and one remote was not working.  After several attempts they managed to fix the remote, but we had to wait until the second day for a TV engineer to fix the television.  They offered us free internet in exchange.  I must say that charging 15 euro for a half hour access to the internet seems very petty given the price we were paying for the room overall.

We were three in the bedroom, but they forgot extra towels and they had forgotten to put the extra bed into the room.  The rooms were very small, and with the extra bed it was very cramped.

Room service was friendly but the selection of food was very limited.

Wooden floors meant that the noise between the rooms was very annoying - trying to sleep in after 9 am was difficult because of the sound of adjacent rooms being cleaned.  You also could hear people in the bathrooms on either side at all times of the day and night.

I think that for a major hotel in a major city, The Hotel Claris needs to try much much harder to impress.",3,2010,06,06
19,Claris not all its cracked up to be,"We were recommended the claris for our honeymoon stay in Barcelona. We were told it was a fantastic five star hotel in the heart of town. The location is great, but the service for us as well as the rooms was really 50/50.

We were placed in a fairly average roon and were not advised that it was on the smoking floor. One morning we woke up and our room was full of smoke from the room next door. I was advised that we were being moved to a superior room however they just moved us to the same room one floor down.

My wife tried to order room service one night when I was sick and had to go down to reception to make the order because they just were not answering the phone. The lady in charge of guest services (I can't remember her name but she is tall and has brown hair) is amazing and always happy to help out! The rest of the staff were sometimes helpful and sometimes acted like they just didn't care.

Also breakfast is amazing but if its not part of your package don't go. Its 21 euro a person and you can get better outside the hotel.

Also when we were there there was a conference on so our questions almost seemed like we were bothering them and parts of the hotel like the rooftop bar were closed off to us. It was very annoying.

There are some amazing hotels in Barcelona and I am sure that some people reallly liked this hotel and I know that from past experiences some people's experiences of the same hotel can be different. For us this place was average. Like another reader said 3 stars not 5.",3,2010,05,25
19,"Not a 5 star hotel nor a 5 star ""gran lujo"" as they state they are","I always value a hotel comparing it to previous experiences in the same category of hotel and as well depending on the type of hotel, meaning that a 3 star hotel can have 5 in every category.
The Claris hotel is not a 5 star hotel at all....
The service is of a 3 star hotel:
At reception they dont even look at you or greet you when you pass by.
In the room the made put us some nice packed chocolates one day and never again we had them...
One day we came to the room after it had been cleaned and the room service tray from the previous night was still there...
2 bulbs were dead the whole stay...
There is no turn down service. They leave the room turned down since the morning cleaning.
The quality of the towels is more of a 3 or 4 star hotel.
The WC amenities are ok but not great for a named grand lujo hotel.
The noise from the street is just unacceptable in a 5* hotel. 
The hotel has also some good things. The bed linnen is great and the terrace is very nice.",3,2010,05,24
19,Good price but not a 5 star property,"I got a great rate on Expedia for the Hotel Claris in Barcelona.  It was listed as a 5 star hotel, and was half the price of other 5 star properties.  In hindsight, there was a reason that it was half the price.  It just didn’t measure up to the standards of a 5 star hotel.

I booked a duplex suite room.  The room was split on to two levels with a bedroom and bathroom on the main floor and a sitting room above the bathroom.  I would have preferred to have the sitting room on the main floor and the bedroom on the upper level, but I imagine not all guests would have wanted to climb the stairs to the bedroom.  However, it would have been nice to have that option.  The bathroom was a bit dated, but everything was very clean, and I liked the large walk-in closet.

The staff at the front desk were polite and tried to be helpful, but I never really knew who to speak to if I had any questions.  If I asked about restaurants, they would confer with each other and try to determine which person had the best recommendation.  When I asked about museums and tours, again the person I asked kept checking with his colleagues until finally someone who could actually answer my questions appeared from the back room.  It didn’t give me the confidence that the staff providing accurate or useful information. 

The hotel was well located with some other 5-star hotels nearby.  The Mandarin Oriental Hotel was a couple of blocks away, and I ended up talking to their concierge if I needed any help.  Next time, I’ll pay the extra and stay there instead.",3,2010,05,17
19,"Excellent location, service; rooms could use improvement","We stayed here for three nights at the end of April.  Like many other reviewers, we were somewhat disappointed in the size, decor and ambiance of our standard room, not to mention the small window towards a nondescript courtyrad.  We asked to see another room, and this room was slightly larger, but had a strangely shaped window and an even stranger odor, so we stayed in our original room. The rooms are definitely due for an update -- it would be easy to make the rooms much more comfortable and appealing despite their European size.

That said, the common areas of the hotel, like the lobby,  the inner covered courtyard and the roof are lovely, and the service was excellent. Katy at the front desk in particular was very helpful with a car rental crisis we had, and this was much appreciated.  

Most importantly, the location is terrific for viewing Eixample sights and the general area is very safe and has several excellent restarants.  Some other hotels in the area may have more luxurious rooms, but if they are facing a busy street, the noise may be significant, whereas the Claris is on a quieter intersection 1 block from the Passeig de Gracia.  

We also stayed 1 night at the Le Meridian on Las Ramblas, which has almost exactly the opposite pros and cons from the Hotel Claris (excellent rooms, spotty service).",4,2010,05,14
19,5 stars and wifi as an extra??,Good location and nice place (even if it should be soon updated) but I dont understand a 5 stars hotel trying to charge wifi as an extra. Whats next? Paid for towels used in bathroom? Not logical in 21st century... This small details are the ones that makes people come back (or not to places).,2,2010,05,01
19,Noisy room with tiny window is not worth EUR200 per night,"We booked this hotel on last minute.com for a long weekend. They showed us to our room but when they opened the door the non smoking room had an unbearable smoke smell. We asked for a different room and they placed us in a very small and depressing rear room. Again we asked to move and they gave us a 4th floor room with zero light. In the morning you could hear everything. It felt like the maid and the elevator were actually in our room. They said the hotel was full but it did not seem so and I feel they could have made an effort to give us a good room. I will never stay at this hotel again. A tip, if you have the cash stay at the arts hotel.",2,2010,04,04
19,Outstanding!,"Maria Rosa Castillo, Deputy Manager

19,Wonderful hotel in wonderful part of Barcelona,"My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in Barcelona. We booked the Hotel Claris through one of the discount hotel sites at a very reasonable rate. It exceeded every expectation. The staff was superb (even to pushing the elevator button as you approached). The restaurant was world class and no more expensive than most of the local restaurants. The location in the Eixample district was brilliant. We were a short (two to three block) walk from two of Gaudi's masterpieces (Casa Batllo and Las Perdreras) and the wonderful Fundacion de Tapies and the Carrera Gracia was a wonderful place to stroll. And if you don't mind walking, the Barie Gotic and the Ramblas were not too far to reach.",5,2010,03,17
19,Excellent location and no real issues,"I read a number of moaning reports about this hotel, mostly from non european visitors. Many claiming its was not a 5* hotel. I am lead to believe that these rating as given on the basis of a number of things including, lesiure facilities, lift, room service etc. Therefore a hotel with no lift and no room service and no lesiure, could be a place but not 5*. However, this is located just off the main strip by one block. There are restaurant and taps bars nearby and drinking only bars including an English named pub called the Daily telegraph. 
The hotel reception was good and efficient and the porter took my bag. I had a room on the 4th floor which was quiet and over looked the rear. This is central Barcelona, however it was very peaceful. The room was very clean, linen changed everyday, good bath compliments and clean towels. The bed was comfortable, it was really fine.
I only had the breakfast in the hotel which was in my price, very fresh and enough to satisfy even the ""eat it all"" crowd.
The bar 47 was friendly and a good place to to come back for a night cap, but open all day. The roof had a swimming pool and loungers, even in December it was nice to sit outside, but might be a bit of a bun fight in the summer.
Summing up if this was in London the price would be double for the standard and location, its not the Ritz, but it is nice, friendly and in a good location!",4,2010,01,14
19,"Good location, Good hotel",The Claris looks great for the outside and the inside.  Its near the busy streets but its calm inside.  Service is not to the standard of a 4 or 5 starts hotel.,4,2009,12,06

19,Had a terrible stay,"The window in our room hadn't been sealed properly, and the traffic noise was terrible. We had a duplex room, and I ended up sleeping on the small sofa on the upper level just to get away from the noise. I complained to the desk, with no success. 
The pool area on the roof is beautiful, but didn't come close to compensating for our terrible experience.",1,2009,11,16
19,Horrible Hotel.  Much false advertising in their amenities.,"We spent a lot of money for a 3 night stay.  It was the absolute worst experience I've ever had in a hotel.  When we checked in, the front desk switched the room we chose and paid for online saying they didn't have what we ordered available.  So they gave us a small suite in the back of the hotel with a tiny window and a view of the buildings in the back alley.  The house keepers did a lousy job of cleaning the room.

Upon check-out, the front desk staff coerced us into taking a cab to the airport which we were grossly overcharged for.  When we came down to the cab, we found it had been running the meter long before we arrived and had racked up over 10 Euros in fees.  The cab driver refused to blank out the meter when we refused to get in her taxi and pay for the time she waited for us before we even drove anywhere.  When I insisted the that front desk call us another car service, they rudely refused.  Because we had little time to continue arguing as we had to make an international flight we were basically forced to take the cab to the airport.  On the way, the cab driver basically admitted she paid members of the hotel staff under the table to be on of the only cars they called for their guests.  That explains why the front desk wouldn't accommodate us with another car and didn't care how awful we were treated by the cabbie.  This kind of nonsense is something I would expect from a motel in a shady part of town, not an expensive hotel like the Claris.

Other disappointing facts:  A sign on the rooftop bar labeled it 'indefinitely closed', the outdoor pool was tiny and unswimmably frigid and their supposed 'fitness center' consisted of a cramped bicycle and treadmill.",1,2009,11,04
19,not ikea canteen,i recently had my birthday party in the bar area of Hotel Claris and my guests and I were wowed by the service of the staff and the fantastic Egyptian artefacts on show. The artwork is definetly not what you would expect to see in an Ikea  canteen,5,2009,10,30
19,Very disappointing..,I had read some great reviews about the Claris however struggle to see what all the hype is about. The pool is lovely - that was definitely the highlight. The room was small and dark and the bed was similar to a camp bed in size and comfort levels..The bar area is definitely not that of a 5 Star hotel - more IKEA canteen. We were very disappointed as it was not a cheap choice.,3,2009,10,27
19,Very far from being a 5*GL!!!!!!!!!!,"I have stayed at the Claris 5*GL in Barcelona from 1510.09 to 19.10.09, and I have to say that this hotel is very far from being a 5*GL.  I booked a Suite in the hotel’s website at the rate of 353 Euros per night (tax + breakfast included).  To start with, some of the staff treated me in a very familiar way and they behaved as if we were friends, they didn’t keep the distance that has to be between the client and the employee.  To follow, the suite is small taking into account that it is a 5*GL. For example the smallest Suite in any Four Seasons is 80 sq. m. (and this year I’ve stayed twice at the F. Seasons in Buenos Aires, so I know what I am talking about), and the room was in a deplorable state of neglect.  Part of the ceiling is full of cracks due to humidity and it was never repaired.  It seems that there was a leaking in the wall as it is full of stains that nobody bothered cleaning (see pics).  The room is divided in two rooms by a sliding door.  The room and the bathroom don’t have any window at all, which equals to zero ventilation (see pic). The wood floors are all scratched as a consequence of moving furniture around or adding beds (see pic).  Last but not least, the furniture is just deplorable too!  It gives the impression that they have gone to a second hand store and bought some spare pieces and cheap furniture and they put them together with the existing one, so nothing matches with nothing.  For instance, there is an old English style wood table with three plastic black chairs!!!!! I’ve sent a three pages letter with the pics to the General Manager.  The day that I left the hotel he came to apologize for the inconveniences and he deducted 100 Euros from my bill. I go very often to 5*GL and as far as I am concerned, that was not a solution.  I don’t want to sound pretentious but if I can afford to pay 350 euros daily I expect to have a comfortable stay, and 100 Euros less in the final bill doesn’t make any difference.  All in all I don’t recommend this hotel at all.  There are far much better options in Barcelona for that price or for a slightly higher price.",2,2009,10,26
19,loved it- boutique feel with personal touches,"We just got back from Barcelona- stayed for 7 days with husband and 4 year old daughter. I agonized of where to stay and was glad we settled on the Claris. It was beautiful and in the perfect area. one block from the train station which made it easy for short trips down to sitges. 
1. This is kind of like the NYC Park Avenue area. This was a nice change of pace from the Rambles or Bari Gothic area. These are all close enough to walk to but not in the thick of tourist traps. It was a treat to walk back to the hotel where it was a bit less hectic.
2. Awesome pool deck to relax at
3. spotless hotel
4. great service- got fabuolus recommendations by conceirge for special restaurants
5. standard rooms have separate seating area.
My suggestion is if you want a quieter room ask for the back of the hotel- if you want a bright room with a view ask for the front of the hotel.
 
Also be sure to check rates on the hotel derby website. I found by booking direct I got a 25% discount which was cheaper than any of the travel sites.",5,2009,10,18
19,Excellent well located find,"Stayed three nights at the Claris at the recommendationof our son who was there last year.  Rooms are perfect.  Services excellent.  Front desk staff was very helpful and even the doorman remembered who we were.

Hotel is located several blocks from Las Ramblas but is nevertheless  within easy walking distance of all the major sites in Barcelona.  It is on a quiet street so the hectic city noises were not a bother.

There is an excellent rooftop restaurant.  With all the great restaurants in Barcelona, this is on a par with those and is considerably less expensive than many of the other Barcelona hotel restaurants.",5,2009,10,17
19,Needs an update,"We have stayed at the Claris on many occassions over the past 10 years and I am beginning to think the 5* Gran Luxe is wearing a bit thin. While the hotel is still in a great location, the staff still great and the rooftop pool the best in Barcelona, the rooms do need an up-date. We have stayed in both suites and rooms and they are all of the same, dark brown, wood with iffy art. They need a serious 2010 makeover; while they might have been plush in the late 80's (or whenever it opened) they just don't cut the mustard.
They also need to create a comfortable lounge area where patrons can have a drink after dinner. The bar in miniscule and really not fit for purpose. 
200 yards away is the similarly priced Majestic Hotel which has recently had a complete re-vamp and will steal customers away if the Claris doesn't do something soon.
That said it's still a great hotel, with as I said the best rooftop pool in Barcelona.",4,2009,10,07
19,"Nicely designed hotel, good location","We stayed here at one of their junior duplex suites last week. The rooms themselves are very nicely designed with nice hard wood floors, nice modern bathrooms and all the necessary amenities. Overall the whole hotel had a fresh modern design. The location is a short walk away from the main street. 

Service was good and anything we needed was brought to our room promptly.  The roof top restaurant is good for a drink, but the service is pretty slow. 
The one issue I had with the hotel was the fact that there was no real concierge service. In fact I dont think I ever actually saw anyone at the concierge desk during our stay. Most of our questions were answered by the front desk people. While they were competent, they were not as useful as a a full time concierge would be.
 A five star hotel should have a full time concierge.",4,2009,09,18

19,Red Roof Inns have better bathrooms.,"While the location is good, the lobby is beautiful, the rooms are clean and the service is impecable,  the bathrooms were over designed for all style and no function. First of all, there is no ventilation -- not so much as a wall grate, so when you rush back to the haven your room to relieve the effects of an unfamiliar diet, you find yourself having to leave again till it airs out, which could be quite a while.  The sink is one of those flat bottom troughs which look sophisticated, but don't drain. Your toothpaste and spit effluvia can sit there until the maid comes. The toilet paper holder is located so that you have to be a rubbery contortionist to reach it. The trash bin is a spring loaded lid with a pedal -- step on the pedal, and the can tilts forward and hits you in the shin. Most egregious, the shower has neither door nor curtain, and the shower head is a hand held thing. It is impossible to shower without drenching the entire bathroom, and the shower is in a very deep tub. So you have to climb out of the tub onto a treacherously slippery floor, and reach around to some remote place for your towels -- there are no bars either to hang a towel or to grab to steady yourself during the climb. Clearly, the bathrooms are meant for high style twenty-somethings who could care less if they soak the room or throw the bathrobes on the floor to mop up.",3,2009,07,17
19,Beware of the Claris.......,"Claris was recommended highly in   Fodors and also some travel pubs and I did see it mentioned on Goop (Paltrow blogsite).      Location is perfect and hotel at first glance and entry seems nice.   Front desk staff is almost non existent in terms of getting any attention or assistance.   Upon arrival they immediately handed us a full page list of warnings for walking around Barcelona...theft, pickpockets, etc.    We travel a lot so this was something we are aware of in every city.    The mgr. of hotel checked us in and insisted we pay for our 4 or 5 day stay right then on our credit card.
Reservation had been booked months in advance and held with card.   Had never experienced a hotel asking for payment on room stay up front.
We let them put thru the charge because we were going to be there but were puzzled and he gave no explanation.    I later asked the evening clerk why this took place and was told that a new ruling or law went into effect in Barcelona that all hotel rooms must be paid in advance upon checkin.     The following day we visited some friends staying nearby at the OM and Majestic Hotel and I asked about this policy at the front desk and the staff told me there is no such law in  Barcelona and their procedure for clients is to hold credit card for the booking and client pays bill upon departing the hotel.      Seems the only rip off in Barcelona to ""beware of"" is the staff at the Claris who seem to have some scam going on.       When I asked the desk clerk on another day what would be done if  I needed to check out earlier that my 5 day stay.....after paying in full on 1st day>    Answer: You would get a refund
The staff only seem concerned with the traffic coming in and out for the rooftop restaurant/pool deck.     During stay we could never find the concierge so we could get some assistance with a day plan.     Not once did we see the concierge.        Coming back to hotel in evenings...staff at desk always seemed to be having a party..sitting on the front desk...nobody is asked if they are staying at hotel...no security of any kind is present.        There is a mgr. but he does not seem to know what a mgr. should do..except get your pymt. upfront - when you check is.
Stay away from this hotel.",1,2009,07,13
19,"Location, Style and Sleep Can't Be Beat!","We loved everything about the Claris Hotel. Terrific location, largish rooms with style and character, professional/plentiful/helpful staff, great restaurant, pretty pool - wonderful value all in all. We spent our first few nights in the Born historic area - Banys Oriental Hotel which was another fine hotel to stay in offering a very different perspective of this amazing city. We would strongly recommend trying both in a single visit to Barcelona.",5,2009,07,10
19,Fabulous Hotel... excellent staff,"Hotel Claris is an all around winner!  Great location, wonderful neighborhood - near great restaurants, shopping and GAUDI!  Modern hotel with great design and artwork. Warm and hospitable staff.  7th Floor Terrace is wonderful - pool, bar and restaurant with views of the city.",5,2009,06,22
19,totally overrated,"we initially booked for 5 days but checked out after one night, rooms were very small, prices outrageous, location excellent. staff quite snobby. food quality so so
wouldnt stay there again, there are much better deals going on.",3,2009,05,21
19,"Not a 5*L hotel, more like a 4* hotel","My stayed in this hotel was from 4/5/09 to 4/8/09 (3 nights 4 days)
The service at front desk was good/plus; cordial and welcoming. The reception area was very clean, 5* with a desing and decor from the 70's, 60's or 90's a little be of every decade up to the XXI century.
My first room #501 was near the elevator and I could hear the noises of the doors open and close plus the going up and down, this was a double room for single use (full size bed) I called front desk and they put me in a different room # 502, room with 2 single beds, I was not very happy but I took it; the lady at front desk explained to me that the rooms were far apart. At night I found out that room 502 was nexts to the service elevator. The next morning they gave the choise to look the room first (that was nice) to see if I like it before they switch my room.
My permanent room it was fine, on the 3rd floor in quite area. The rooms are in need of fresh paint, better matresses and a different way to stop water come out from shower in to the bathroom floor; as a guest of a 5*L hotel I don't like the idea of need to dry the floor every time I take a shower. The view from the window of this room was back of different buildings.
In general the rooms are OK good size, nice bathroom (marble) very clean exellent towels and amenities, hight quality of linen but.... 5*L ??
I did like the location near every thing and far from the crowd; the food in the restaurant is very good, set menu, and good price special offer 25% off
I did not like the terrase restaurant and it seems they don't have enough staff of servers",3,2009,04,16
19,"Hotel Is Under Construction, and it needs it!","Hotel is in a decent location, but I would prefer to stay closer to the gothic area next time. The major problem for me was the construction that was going in the hotel. We could hear loud banging, drilling, and grinding ALL DAY from 7am till 7pm everyday. Which may not be an issue if you are out most of the day and getting back at night, but when we first got there in the afternoon after a long flight we couldnt rest at all. I asked the guy in the front desk if he could put us in a different room away from the construction area, his response was that they have to do construction during the day and the rooms on the other side of the hotel that is further away from the construction area are an upgrade that I had to pay more, but you still could hear the construction, but not as bad. The hotel is not in great shape, but decent. I will NOT stay there again with the construction as they are redoing their rooms. Hotel staff and manager are NOT accommodating. We finally decided to move out of there for a piece of mind. Moved to Hotel 1898, closer to southern part of the city which is more activity, first class place and first class service, was a couple of bucks more, but money well spent.",2,2009,04,15
19,nice hotel,"stayed here for four days - great location and trendy hotel with a fantastic roof top pool and terrace 
overall a lovely stay and the staff were very helpful - just a couple of little things 
room was not very clean and bathroom not cleaned properly had to call housekeeping twice. 
only got 1 turndown which I thought was strange - no iron and ironing board - had to pay for ironing service which i find annoying. had to pay for mineral water and internet service.
ate in the restaurant one night which was fine",4,2009,04,12
19,Wonderful Hotel in Barcelona,"Our family of three just stayed at the Hotel Claris in Barcelona and had a great experience.  The hotel is located approximately 8 blocks from the Sangrada Familia and two blocks from the main shopping area.  Like much of Barcelona, the HC is a very modern, contemporary hotel complete with its own art collection.  There is a very chic rooftop pool and dining area (with a great view of the entire city) perfect for a glass of wine or cappacino after a long day of sight seeing.  The pool is not heated.  Hotel Claris had a great location.  We could walk to just about any where we desired.  Our room was a small suite that was well suited for our family.  The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for all of us to relax when we weren't out discovering Barcelona.  The staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful and by the end of our four day stay, we were on a first name basis with everyone.  The breakfast that came with package was very good too.  We did find that the restaraunts that we found on our own (especially for Tapas) were just as good and less expensive that the ones they suggested.  One good suggestion they did make was for a small Tapas Restaraunt called Bohemia- fabulous.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time at dinner as this is part of the experience; little taste of each artfully prepared dish.  Dinner can easily last for three hours.  Hotel Claris is just as nice as it looks in the pictures and a top pick for business or pleasure.",4,2009,04,05
19,Claris - a five-star hotel with one-star beds!,"What a pity! This five-star hotel has lots of potential: it's in an excellent location, it's very clean and the staff are friendly. However, following the worst night's 'sleep' we've had in years, a simple request to rectify a problem concerning a 'rock-hard' mattress could not be resolved. After telling us that 'all of the mattresses are the same"" and before demonstrating this unfortunate but extremely important oversight in three other rooms, they attempted, in vain, to address our problem by putting a thick blanket below the mattress. After expressing our concerns again and with little or no response, we politely suggested that, instead, they give us extra pillows to lie on - which they did. No questions asked! So was the problem resolved? Absolutely not! With no alternative, other than move to another hotel, I spent the remaining two nights of our five-star stay, sleeping on a settee in the room, while my wife slept on the pillows we had requested! Did anyone ask if the problem had been resolved to our satisfaction? NO! Ignore this genuine complaint at your peril - the 'five-star' Claris Hotel Barcelona.",3,2009,03,19
19,"Smart, quirky and a bit noisy but very cool and dont forgte to bring your trunks!","Good central position, great staff impeccably turned out.
Nice to enjoy something different to the Holiday Inn on a business trip, forget it if your looking for Grand, but this hotel so suits Barcelona. A city that has reinvented itself to be my favourite destination when on business. Try and get an upgrade to one of their duplex suites, all very cool but equally all very comfortable. Restaurant’s menu is expensive and a bit weird for my tastes so enjoy the Tapas off the Ramblas or take advice from the concierge. Great roof top pool.",4,2009,03,18
19,Beautiful design and convenient location,"We overnighted at the Claris Hotel recently following a cruise.  Despite arriving mid-morning, the excellent front-desk staff were able to give us a room immediately.

The hotel has a very modern, elegant interior with a glassed-in waterfall feature, visible from the glass elevators.  There is a small gym and pool on the top floor.  A display of Egyptian artifacts is on the first floor, where the restaurant is located.  The hotel offers free admission to the Egyptian museum 1/2 block away.

The room we were given was a bit worn (scuffed hardwood floor), but very clean.  The bathroom had double sinks and a tub/shower combination, and a nice amenity kit.  Robes and slippers were also provided.  Wireless internet is available for 10 euro per day, but as we were there for just the one night, we used the computers in their business centre instead.

Our major quibble was the noise in the room at night.  There is a bit of street noise, and a noticeable gurgling sound that was probably coming from pipes in the wall.  This can be a problem if you are a light sleeper.  We also could not get the LCD television to work, but were not in the room long enough for this to be more than a slight annoyance.

The location of the hotel is very convenient, near the centre of the Eixample area attractions and shops.  We were satisfied on the whole with the accommodations, particularly as we booked a good promotional rate on the hotel's website.  The overall feeling we got was that design here won over function.",5,2009,03,11
19,I love this place,"This review is based on my second visit to Pau Claris in August 2008 which my partner wisked me off to after proposing earlier on that day in England.  My first visit was with a friend and I loved the place so much I came home raving about it. 

Upon check in it was quite late and we went up to the terrace and had a few cocktails overlooking the city - the mojitos are lush!

The room we stayed in was an immaculate duplex and some friends of ours had arranged to have flowers in the room to say congratulations.  The Guest relations noting this arranged for champagne to be in our room that night when we came back from sight seeing and chocolates on the third night, (Very nice touch).   

We didnt spend much time in the hotel but I cant really understand some of the crticisms, if people dont want to walk to La Rambla then stay on La Rambla!   Perfect trip, Beautiful hotel and well located.",5,2009,03,06
19,Loved the Claris Hotel,"Central location for seeing the major sites made this a perfect choice for our family.  The hotel was immaculate, service was friendly & prompt. Times are tough all over, so we were given a great rate for adjoining suites which were very spacious. One suite had a king bed, a table for 2 and a full size sofa that could have slept a third person or child ... don't know if they offer cots, but the suite could have easily accommodated a family of 4. Very modern interior, beautiful marble bath with european shower.  The adjoining suite had 2 double beds, a desk and chair and a couch. Would definitely recommend. We walked everywhere from the hotel as the tourist bus lines were way too long!",5,2009,02,26
19,Not A Five Star Hotel,"We stayed at Claris Hotel during the World Congress last week.  The rate were inflated to the large convention in town.  Our rate was over 950 Euros per night.  Since it was a five star hotel we were expecting a luxurious experience.  As noted on previou reviews, the location of the hotel is super, and the reception area and lobby is very nice.  However, the first room we got had two small twin beds.  My husband is 6'3 and his feet hung off the bed.  We pulled the beds together for that first night.  The sheets were too short and rough.  The beds reminded me of beds you would get at summer camp.  The mattress was hard. They moved us to different room for the remainder of our stay.  The King bed is not what I would consider a King bed (especially for a five star hotel).  Same issues, hard mattress, sheets too short and scratchy.  Some other issues we had with the hotel.  The hardwood floors in the room were extremely noisy.  You could hear other guests walking around. The tile in the hallways is also noisy.  You could heard people coming and going morning and night.  You could hear toilets flushing, showers being taken etc.  We could hear water running all the time.  Also, the walls were thin.  I could hear coughing and talking in the other room.  The housekeeper department made no attempt at being quiet in the morning.  They were talking outiside our room and banging their cleaning equipment. The bathroom was adequate (but again, not a five star standard).  Both rooms on the second floor had a living room loft area (a waste of space that we didn't use).  The morning breakfast was just ok.  The staff at the hotel were very nice and helpful.  We never ate at the restaurant, but did have drinks at their bar.",2,2009,02,22
19,old tired 5 star,"We arrived back yesterday, we flew to Gerona then drove down to barcelona.
This 5 star hotel looked great from the reception, but as soon as you went into the room it looked really tired, it was once a nice room. The parque floors were scratched and dirty, the marble bathroom was fitted 20 years ago at a guess and there were black mouldy areas in the shower area in the bath. No seperate shower. The window would not open an inch and the aircon would not get cool, it was'nt a hot weekend although the room stayed stuffy and hot all weekend long.
The gym was 4 pieces of dated equipment squashed into a small glass room on the roof and the pool was very tired too!
What a shame, location great, the consierge was friendly and the city was wonderful. This is a four star at best hotel, with a note that it is tired.",2,2008,11,25
19,Best of Barcelona,"We stayed at the Claris before doing a Butterfield & Robinson bicycle trip in Barcelona.

We found the location and the ambience sensational.  Breakfasts were lovely. The concierge, Emma del Valle, was terrific in making dinner reservations and suggestions. It was truly a memorable experience.",5,2008,10,12
19,A special experience,"This is a very unusual hotel - full of beautiful and atmospheric antiquities in an artistic and comfortable modern  interior.
It was very special to stay in a spacious suite and share this with a large ancient Thai sculpture. 
The rooms are in need of refreshing a little but are very comfortable as they are. 
There were some odd noises from plumbing in other rooms, 
but this did not disturb our sleep on the very comfortable bed.
The staff were all exceptionally pleasant, and the concierge particularly helpful and friendly.
The Claris is conveniently located and is a hotel for those who seek something with unique character and style.",4,2008,10,04
19,Oh dear........................,"On the positive side, the staff, without exception were superb, friendly, helpful and courteous.  Also the hotel location is very central.

Like many frequest travellers I am curious how hotels of different styles, age, service, facilities etc....can equally be classified under a particular star rating as there often seems to be inconsistent offerings.  While I have learned to accept this I can not accept a same star rating (5 Star GL) for two hotels owned by the same Group where their customer offerings are wildly inconsistent.  I stayed in the Hotel Urban in Madrid in early August and could find no fault with this property or its positioning in the 5 Star GL market.  I had looked forward to my stay in its sister hotel in Barcelona.  Was I disappointed..................

I had requested early check in due to flight timings and was informed on arrival that the room was not ready, which was not an issue.  The manager of the hotel was on hand to greet us on arrival and as part of our booking upgrade we were to get a complimentary glass of champagne and a room upgrade.  Wonderful I thought!  We were given a room to freshen up and then go to the roof top bar for our drink.  When it came to signing for the drink the barman could not deal with it as complimentary as we had not been assigned a room!  I paid!  I am still waiting on my complementary drink...................

We were given access to the room at 2:30pm.  The upgrade room was duplex, which is a category down from the junior suite originally booked!  We were then taken to another upgraded room.  We had lost interest in complaining.  After a while the various noises were a curiousity.  I then worked out that our room was directly below the roof top pool!  Noise of loungers being dragged along and all the splashing around.  The pool closes at 8.  The hotel makes reference to its ""total sound proofing"" - even the quiet summer time traffic of Barcelona centre was audible. If this qualifies as an upgrade, I dispare.

As for the room......... the hotel prides itself on its antiques collection and boasts at least one piece in every room.  Perhaps I missed it, but there was no obvious antique in the room.  The advertised tea/coffee facilities did not exist, no iron/ironing board was to be made available - meaning (costly) hotel services had to be used.  This is entirely unacceptable.  The bathroom was clean and functionally but totally in need of modernisation.

No, I won't be back, but it is the expectation gap from my Madrid experience that I felt most let down about.",1,2008,09,09
19,5 star?????,"Not a bad hotel by any means, it was clean, modern, trendy and the room was large with a large window and another in the bathroom. 
However I am not convinced it meats UK 5star status as the room showed its wear and tear and the entire hotel although uber modern lacks any atmosphere what so ever. My wife and I stayed in another hotel which did not boast 5 stars and yet was much superior in every aspect. 
The staff where friendly enough but to finish our honeymoon here after a great cruise around the med was disappointing, as i said before there is nothing badly wrong with the hotel but its 5 star hype was made insignificant when my wife said, I preferred the other hotel!",3,2008,08,20
19,Fantastic Hotel +++++,"I recently spent five days at the Claris hotel on my 5th Visit to the beautiful city of Barcelona. This was by far the best hotel i have ever stayed in in Spain let alone in barcelona. The service was fantastic and the staff were very very helpfull. The rooms were luxurious and the room service was impeccable. I cannot find any fault with this hotel and you must try the terrace and the Pool on the roof. The location of the hotel is also perfect as it is right in the heart of the city and within walking distance of many famous sights and landmarks (La Rambla etc etc). I will definately stay here if i come back to barcelona and i recommend it for those that seek something special, the epitome of luxury, service, location and total comfort.",5,2008,08,19
19,Need to improve!,"Stayed 5 days 6-11 july -08 in a Duplex Suite. It's my 4th stay at this hotel but unless there is an overall improvement I doubt will be a 5th time. The décor is not bad, art deco style, and rooms are comfortable. Bathrooms are bit run down but they are good in size.  I’ve previously stayed in Duplex Suite and been satisfied but unfortunately this time had a room towards c/ Pau Claris and noise was disturbing. All Duplex suites are on 2nd floor. Agree with previous comments it is really poor the hotel charge for use of wireless internet. Previous occasions front desk staff including concierge have been helpful and service-minded, but this time must say they all seemed dull, tired, uninterested and not motivated (except the concierge Monday evening). The roof top terrace is very nice with its swimming pool although not enough sun chairs and, again, service is pretty poor (used to be much better). The gym is a joke. Machines which are out of date and useless.The air-condition didn’t do any help so it became impossible to stay in the room. Food and drinks at the hotel are ok, but I don’t think worth the price. Location is pretty good for shopping but not so good for the beach which is far away. This hotel needs to shape up in order to compete with the rising stars in Barcelona!",4,2008,08,18
19,A disappointment,"I share the view of someone else who noted this was the least favorite hotel on a two-week stay in Spain.  We spent the longest time in Barcelona, and we loved the city.  But we were really disappointed with the Claris.  The location is great and the public spaces ok, but we had booked a junior suite to get more space, and it was really dark (inner room) and the furniture was definitely showing its wear.  We asked to be moved but apparently nothing else was available the first two nights and after that it was too much trouble to move. While the staff was pleasant, they had a bit of attitude and were pretty bad on directions or recommendations. They did send us to a fabulous tapas bar the first day, just a few blocks away. 

As for the pool, although small, it was adequate for cooling, but the main problem, as with every hotel we stayed in, was that the seating was lacking and there was NO shade, a real problem in July when the sun was brutal. 

Overall, it was not a five star experience, and if I went back (as I hope to), I will choose a different hotel.",3,2008,08,14
19,Wanted to enjoy the Claris but didn't,"Do not be fooled by the ""5 stars"" in the title of this hotel. This is far from 5 stars. As I sit here in our room waiting, waiting, waiting for reception...they seem to tell you everything you want to hear but are never quite able to deliver.

The hotel boasts about ""Mercedes Smart courtesy car"" -- actually this is a rental that you must pay for. The hotel only has 2, and on this day the owner of the hotel is galivanting around Barcelona in one of them. That leaves one car, which is apparently unavailable.

The hotel website mentions ""wireless internet service"" -- this is paid internet like any other ordinary hotel.

The restaurant tried to cheat and overcharge us. At first, the waiter tried to charge the room without showing us the bill. Then it became clear there was an additional $40 charge on the bill that had appeared mysteriously...imagine that.

The bands playing on the roof last night and today can be heard in pretty much every corner of the hotel.

Location is good, which is one thing they can't fake.",2,2008,08,08
19,Eixample location is great,"We spent 3 nights in Barcelona.  Loved the city but hotel was not great.  It was the most disappointing of the hotels we stayed at during our 2 week vacation. However it was the least expensive of the hotels we stayed at as well.  The Hotel Claris is rated a 5 star GL hotel but it does not exude a luxury hotel feel. The Hotel Majestic one block away exudes that luxury hotel feel.  The public spaces in the Majestic  had a 5 star feel where the Claris did not.  The Claris is a 19th century building that has been completely gutted and converted into a very modern hotel with interesting design and modern atrium in the middle to provide light.  Our junior suite was very dark with a separate livingroom with no window and the sole window in the bedroom was on a courtyard with very little light.  The roof top pool and lounge area was nice but the gym is poor.  just 3 cardio machines in a very small space.

We totally enjoyed our stay in Eixample as opposed to staying in the more touristy Las Ramblas area.   Within easy walking distance are the fine shops on the Pg. de Gracia (1 block away) and many of the fine Gaudi architectural treasures are within walking distance.  I love art nouveau design and there is great examples all around.  I enjoy walking and the old city is a good walk away but for those that don't enjoy the long walk it is just a short cab ride.   There are also many great restaurants and cafes just a short walk away.  We spent 3 nights there but we could have easily filled 6 days in Barcelona.  There is much to see do and experience.  Also the city is every bit as sophisticated as the top European cities.",4,2008,07,05
19,"Not really 5 Star, pretty loud, very stylish","Stayed one night at the Claris on our way through to France.  Nice modern decor, great terrace bar & pool.  The room and service were lovely.  The staff were really helpful and all the amenities in the room were great - clean, well stocked with toiletries, towels, robes, slippers, etc.  Very rough sheets (appeared to be linen, as in not cotton but actual linen, but the effect was too hard for me) were a disappointment.  The a/c worked well and is completely temp adjustable.  One big caviat - they are not soundproofed.  The hallway is not the issue - there is a lobby door between the room and the bath/hall door.  The issue is really the windows to outdoor.  We were awakened to traffic sounds and an auto accident, even though we were on the top floor.  Easy access to business center downstairs with two computers & internet access free.",4,2008,05,28
19,"Good, 4.5 star - not quite 5 star","I stayed here whilst at a meeting in Barcelona. The location is great being just one block off the Paseig de Gracia and hence only two blocks from the metro. The hotel itself has been constructed within an older building and the architecture is very interesting. The hotel is built around a central atrium. The front lobby is very arty with various glass and water features. The public areas were generally of a high standard.

The front desk were very friendly and helpful. My room was on the fifth floor - the lifts are very small, glass affairs. The furnishings were to a high standard in the room. The bedroom and separate bathroom were spotlessly clean. It did suffer majorly from having only one small window which was set a one end of the room and opened out onto the internal atrium.  This meant that little natural daylight got into the room.  The toileteries were ample and of good quality.

Breakfast was served in the basement - so no daylight there either. The room I found to be featureless and devoid of atmosphere. It started serving at 07:00 which is quite late for business people. The choice was reasonable and the presentation faultless. I have had better breakfasts in Spain, but I have had many worse.

There is a pool on the roof but this is much smaller in reality than the hotel website photographs would suggest  - so be warned you won't being doing traiing laps here. There is a bar beside the pool and another small one on the ground floor.

Overall this is indeed a luxury hotel but I am not sure it meets UK 5 star standards, mainly due to the lack of amenities. It is a moderate sized, boutique-type hotel rather than your large scale Mariott or Hilton.",4,2008,05,17
19,"Location, Service, Ammenities","Stayed here April 08 for a long weekend of leisure.  Main reason was the hotel's membership in the Small Luxury Hotels.  I am yet to be dissapointed by any of the hotels of SLH. 

As for the Claris.  Service was excellent.  Stayed in a Jr. Suite which had plenty of room and a large Marble bathroom with Sauna and Jacuzzi Tub.  Service was above average but not great because not every time there was someone opening the door for us and because while there was turndown service, no mint was left until my last night.  (Small bones to pick!).

Lobby is great, clean, modern and sleek.  As was the bedroom.  Great sound-proofing to street noise and only slight sound from adjacent rooms and hallway.  Double doors from hallway to room help to ease noise. 

Rooftop area is great for a drink or a smoke after a long day of sight seeing.  Free wi-fi and busines center are a plus.  Extensive international newspapers with the Herald Tribune, Financial Times and Wall Street Journal all available in the lobby.  Room service was attentive and fine.

Overall greatly recommended for amenities and price point, which while not cheap, still more economical than comparables (ritz carlton, etc.)

Enjoy Barcelona!",4,2008,04,15
19,"""Don't Believe the Negative Reviews - A Wonderful Hotel""","My family and I stayed at the Claris during spring break.  We missed our original flight to Barcelona and our luggage did not arrive until a few days after we did...it was very comforting that, from the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff was very accomodating; the Public Relations Manager, in particular, went way above the call of duty to help us with our lost luggage crisis.  The rooms are nicely adorned and we particularly appreciated the hardwood floors and furnishings.  The location is accessible to ""all that's Barcelona,"" and the room rates are very reasonable for the ammenities offered. We look forward to staying at the Claris again on our next trip to Spain:-)",5,2008,04,05
19,Fantastic Service,"My husband and I stayed at the Claris over the Easter holiday weekend.  While I was concerned about the service over the holiday weekend, we had nothing to worry about.  From the moment we stepped out of the cab until we left, we received warm hospitality and excellent service.  We ate dinner at the hotel one evening because we were too tired to go out.  The restaurant was quite excellent with service and quality of food.  While we had an outside room, I would admit that the noise level to the street was noiceable but not too distracting as we slept in most days.  Also, the rooms are not large but they are quite clean and our rooms were serviced every day.
Lastly, my husband and I wanted to go to an Easter mass in English.  We had located a church prior to our arrival but didn't mapquest the location.  The hotel concierge was kind enough to map it out for us and gave us the easiest route.",5,2008,03,26
19,"Good location, particular rooms.",The Claris Hotel is sort of a boutique style hotel. They have duplex rooms wich are nice but a bid old style. Lobby is nice and location is good!,3,2008,03,25
19,Unbelievably Noisy for late sleepers and rotten service,"First of all I will must say that overall this hotel wasn't all that bad except for an  Extremely big problem. Understandedly Spain is known for it stone and Marble but this is a Huge problem for a hotel that uses all the corridor flooring in Marble/Stone and has thin walls.

At about 10am the Hotel comes alive with showers, toilets flushing, made's service, elevators, shoes clacking, vacuums and chattering. If you are a late sleeper like me this Hotel is a nightmare. The noise was so loud that even a deep sleeper would have problems.

The bedding wasnt all that great either and the mini bar was scant. I guess I can go on and on but it's really not worth it. I should have followed a person's advice and stayed at the Majestic which was a blcck away. I also want to mention the front desk was also very rude.",1,2008,03,10
19,Disappointing,"Very disappointed with my last stay at the Claris. I booked and paid 100% in advance for 10 rooms for all my colleagues. 

I arrived to the hotel and realized I had left my passport with a colleague at another hotel. They refused to check me in even though I had already checked in 3 guests of mine into their rooms.

There is one receptionist in particular who has an attitude problem is absolutely incompetent. I'm surprised he's in the service industry at all. 

It took the GM's interference to allow me to check in after being made to wait for 40 minutes.   

When I finally checked in I noticed that my room was very noisy. The windows don't [--] hermetically and let in a lot of noise from the street. 

Aside from that it was ok, breakfast was ok, room was clean. 

But I'm was not at all impressed.

I changed hotel on my last night and stayed at the Majestic. Go there for service.",2,2008,03,01
19,"Location, Location, Location","During our recent trip to Barcelona to visit our daughter who is studying abroad there, we opted to stay at the five-star Hotel Claris. While I'm not sure it deserves its five-star rating, we were pleased with many things the hotel offered. 
First and foremost, the Claris is located in one of Barcelona's most elegant neighborhoods––L'Eixample. It's a stone's throw from Paseo de Gracia, one of Western Europe's most beautiful boulevards. Within walking distance from the hotel, we were able to tour La Pedrera, Casa Batllo, Placa de Catalunya, Las Ramblas, and Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece, Sagrada Familia. A little further away, but still within walking distance, was the Bari Gotic quarter.
There are numerous cafés and restaurants within walking distance of the Claris. At 25 euros per person, there's no need to take breakfast at the hotel as there are excellent, moderatey priced cafés right around the corner. Plus, it's infinitely more fun to frequent places where the locals go. Also within walking distance is Dow Jones, an American-style sports bar, where we were able to catch the Patriots and Giants playoff games.
The hotel combines an Old World European facade with modern amenities. Glass elevators overlooking the hotel's interior whisk you to your room, all furnished with antique kilim rugs and Brazilian cherry floors. My husband and I happen to like modern furnishings, so we were very pleased with the décor.
The hotel's staff was uneven at best. Some people, especially bell staff and doormen, were extremely helpful and attentive, but  some front desk personnel were rude and impatient. 
There were very few English speaking television channels, and by the end of the week we started to grow tired of the steady dose of CNN and Sky News. Our in-room movies, something you expect at a five-star, were not working and the front desk was unable to fix it.. It was January and the hotel was not busy, so the staff accommodated us by giving us access to the room next door.
There's a small collection of museum-quality Egyptian antiquity on display on the second floor, which is definitely worth a look. There's also a rooftop bar/restaurant and pool, but since we were there in January those facilities were not operational. On the flip side, January was a perfect time to visit Barcelona. The weather was ideal for long walks and you didn't have to fight the crowds anywhere in the city.",4,2008,01,31
19,"Not bad, perhaps not 5-star","This is certainly an above-average hotel. It is quite nice, in fact. I'm not quite sure it is 5-star, though.",4,2008,01,14
19,"Really disappointing, don't waste your money","I am a regular business visitor to Barcelona, but on this occasion my wife came with me and so I booked us into supposedly the best hotel in town, the 5-star Claris.  The internet booking I made promised all sorts of luxuries (e.g. antique furniture) which never materialized.  The service promises things that also did not materialize (e.g. Leave this tag on your door and we shall deliver wake-up coffee).  The room was very badly designed, e.g. nowhere within reach of the bed to out anything.  Complained at the time and got nowhere.  Filled in a form to the manager, but have just got blocking replies from the secretary.  There are plenty of decent hotels in Barcelona, so I won't waste my money here again.",2,2008,01,13
19,Great location but overpriced and overrated,"Great location for accessing central Barcelona, friendly staff and lovely decor. Very impressive exterior in particular. But doesnt merit five star rating - the facilities/amenities and services provided are just not good enough for such a high rating. Has services of a good 3 star with 4/5 star decor. Bad points:
- small rooms that are very noisy because of traffic (double glazing just not good enough)
- very overpriced
- no basic amenities in rooms such as iron, drinking water etc.
Having stayed in other hotels of the ""small luxury hotel"" (slh) brand, this one should definitely not be included. It just doesnt compare when it comes to services and facilities.",3,2008,01,01
19,What an experience,"I stayed at Hotel Claris while on business in Barcelona.  Overall, it was a very good experience.  Rooms were spacious by European standards and very clean.  This hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of major attractions.  Walking to the port is about 20 minutes.

What really stands out for me is a diner I had on the rooftop restaurant - La Terraza del Claris.   The food was unbelieveable and the setting and views were exceptional!  They were fully booked that night and without having a reservation, they were able to accomodate me after only a short wait.

I would recommend passing on breakfast at the hotel.  The buffet was good but the dining area is in the basement and is basically a large converted meeting room.  Who wants to be stucked in a basement in Barcelona of all places!  

Though the hotel and restaurant were pricey, the overall experience was worth it.",4,2007,12,14
19,Claris clearly NOT condusive to comfort or work!,"My husband and I stayed at 2 hotels while we were in Barcelona, the Claris Hotel and the Majestic Hotel.  The reason why we ended up at 2 is because we initially booked our reservation at the Claris, and after 1 night we swtiched hotels.  I was mildly unsatisfied, my husband as the business traveler was MAJORLY unsatisfied.

The lobby was nice and modern in design.  We arrived at the hotel at around 9:30pm and there were 2 gentlemen to greet us. They were busy behind the desk and weren't extremely welcoming or attentive.  However, they did manage the check-in and a very nice bellhop showed us to our junior suite.

The junior suite was located on the first floor directly off of the elevator.   When we entered the room the decor was very dark and reminded me of something you might expect in a lodge in the southwestern part of the US (Arizona or New Mexico maybe).  There were hardwood floors (dark reddish brown tones) with rugs on them.  Everything in the room was very low to the ground.  The bed, the television, the couch.  There was a small table with chairs next to the entryway and then upon entering the room there was a couch on one wall with the bed facing it. A flat screen tv was facing the bed and was mounted so that it stood about 1 foot off of the floor. which meant that if you were sleeping in the bed, you would not be able to really see it unless you were propped up.  There wasn't a desk area in the room unless you wanted to work on that small table by the door....

I proceeded to unpack while my husband attempted to do some work on his laptop.  He was literally logging into the laptop every 15 minutes because the internet connection wasn't working.  After 2 hours he called the front desk and they sent the bellhop to our room to try and assist with the wireless connection.  A failed effort as the bellhop knew nothing about wireless connections. Finally, at around midnight--my husband had to go to the lobby and work from the lobby for about 2 hours (to access the internet connection).  

I couldn't get the air conditioner to turn off all night so we were freezing in our bed.  My last complaint-the sheets were not soft! I was surprised and unsure if this was a Spanish thing.  Fortunately, when we arrived at the Hotel Majestic I realized soft sheets can be found in Barcelona!",2,2007,11,21
19,Very pleasant saty at the lovely Claris,"A seven night stay at the Hotel Claris for our fortieth wedding anniversary! Conveniently located for the first time Barcelona tourist, the hotel is a compact jewel in many ways. Lovely lobby with dramatic hallways, glass interior elevators ascending through a pleasing water garden, and an attentive staff made the stay most enjoyable. But, as with all good things, there was a wrinkle or two. With a street side room, there was consistent late night traffic noise. The maid opened the windows for the first 2 or 3 days and required a desk person to come up and re-secure them with the special key. And the attractive bathroom sink took forever to drain. I advised the desk of this to no avail.  Because of the ultra convenient location, we’d probably stay at the Claris again although there are super alternatives in the immediate area.",5,2007,11,17
19,"Great Location, Decent Service","Barcelona was our second city in our Spanish trip and the Claris was our second favorite hotel.

We arrived around 11:00 and while they had some rooms ready, we were being upgraded and ours was not yet ready, so we made our way off for lunch and the bus tour.  When we came back, not only did we have our room, but they had moved our luggage into the room.  And let me tell you, the room was worth the wait.  We had a 2 floor duplex.  The first floor had the main bathroom (separate shower and bath) as well as a Sauna (looked a little small, but what can you expect for a private sauna).  It also had the living room/dining room with comfortable couch and chairs and big screen flat tv/  Upstairs had the bed and another full bath (no sauna).  Another great feature was the tv, which seemed to have movies you could rent, and, most importnatly, 5 english speaking channels (CNN Int'l, CNBC Europe, BBC World, Sky News and Disney).  There was nice art in the room, and we were left a rose.  They also gave us a bottle of red wine.

On the negative side, the room was not up to the level of cleanliness I like.  The sink in one of the bathrooms was not clean and the floor was dirty/dusty.  I normally do not wear the hotel slippers (my feet are too big).  But fortunately, their slippers were a little bigger since I needed them.

Service was also a little spotty.  While everyone was helpful (including the door man who remembered that my wife and I wanted a non-smoking restuarant and asking how dinner was), there was one mess up that bothered me.  We had the hotel make reservations in advance.  They made excellent suggestions and we loved 3 of the 4 restaurants.  However, we had a bad experience the night before in Madrid where we went to a smoking resturant.  Therefore, when we picked up our reservations, we asked if they were all for non-smoking restaurants.  We were told that they were. However, the first one was smoking only.  We left and went back to the hotel.  They found us a non-smoking restaurant nearby, but not us fancy or nice.  They followed up with phone calls to ensure that the rest of the restaurants were non-soking (they were).

Breakfast was a buffet.  Very nice selection of breads and an excellent choice of fruits.  You could also order food (such as eggs, pnackages, breakfast meats, etc), but they do not tell you that.

Last, we enjoyed the car they provided to take us to the airport (included in a stay of 3 nights or more).  However, agan ask for non-smoking since at least one car reaks of cigarettes.

The location was great.  A very short walk to a couple of Gaudi houses/museums.  We were also very close to the Metro and only about a 10 minute walk to the Gothic Section.",4,2007,10,16
19,Excellent service - would definitely return,"We stayed at the Claris in September 2007.  I've written a couple of other reviews about places we didn't think were perfect, but we were really very pleased with the Claris.

The location is excellent - just off Passeig de Gracia, one block from La Pedrera and a short walk from Las Ramblas and Barri Gotic.

We experienced excellent service throughout our stay.  We had booked a 2-br suite for our family of four, as well as an adjacent room for my in-laws.  When we arrived in the late morning, only one of the suite rooms was available, but the hotel immediately arranged for the other two rooms to be prepared for us.  Within ten minutes, we had access to all three rooms.  Despite the short wait, the hotel still gave us vouchers for free drinks.  

The remainder of our experience was similarly classy in gracious hospitality.  The buffet breakfast was varied, fresh, and tasty.  Dinner at the terrace restaurant was delicious.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.

Our 2-br suite consisted of two junior suites whose living rooms were connected by opening the wall between them, making a comfortable larger common area.  The bathrooms weren't huge but they were certainly ample, and the bathtub was an unusual somewhat triangular shape, which was interesting and kind of fun for the kids.

We would definitely stay here again; in fact, we would plan a trip back to Barcelona in part because our experience here was so pleasant.",5,2007,10,15
19,Great Location,"My partner and I recently stayed 4 nights at the Claris Hotel.  We found the hotel to be an excellent stay with a couple minor exceptions.  When we arrived at the airport we got a T10 ticket for the train which gave us round trip pass from/to the airport as well as use on the metro in the city. We took the train to Passeig de Gracia (about a 30minute ride) from there the hotel is a very short walk from the Metro stop. Once at the hotel we found the hotel staff to be very friendly.  A nice Spanish bottle of wine and chocolates greeted us in our room.  The  room was quite large with a nice view of the busy streets below.  The street noise was noticeable but wasnt bad. The bed was firm but comfortable with nice linen. The bathroom was large and bright with double sinks and a  good selection of aromatherapy bath products. The hotel pool on the roof was a little small but has a great view and was a nice place to relax in the afternoon from all the walking we would do during the day. The breakfast buffet was excellent and never left us feeling hungry. 

The only minor problems we found were the room we had was on the top level under the roof top restaurant/bar so we heard the movement of tables and people till late in the night. The last day/night we were there our room had a very bad smell of sewer. Although we let the front desk know about it early in the day they did nothing about it till we couldnt take it any longer about 1am and then they let us use another room to sleep in that last night.

Over all the hotel is in an EXCELLENT location to all the major streets for shopping and dining. We would stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona but would ask for a room not under the bar and away from the elevator.",5,2007,10,07
19,Claris hotel,The hotel is not too bad. Very good location near the city center. However I don't agree about the 5 stars Luxe. The hotel is clean and the swimming pool is great but the rooms are not so large and also are not soudproof. There is a main road just close the hotel... The bathroom is very small and some details have to be reviewed. To me it should be a good 3 stars. That means it should be cheaper than 200€ night.,3,2007,09,30
19,Loved the Claris,"What a beautiful, luxurious hotel !!!  We had a pefect stay.  The staff was wonderful, especially the concierge.  The rooms were great !!!  A great find !!!
",5,2007,09,14
19,Beautiful Building but Customer Care Missing,"I had high expectation of this 5 star rated hotel but it left us feeling ..no soul.  The owner evidentally is into Egyptian Art but what he needs for his customers are Egyptian linens...the worst bed linens I have ever experienced in my lifetime.  Rough sheets and horrid pillows and course towels...and in a 5 star facility.  The rooms was a bit beat up and all in all...great foyer and lovely roof top deck but client quarters...just so-so.

I found nothing special about this hotel other than a nice location in the Example...close to Gaudi home and Sagrada Familia.

Just a neutral experience at a high dollar hotel...not worth the money but perhaps this is as good as it gets in Spain????
",3,2007,08,30
19,Close To To Perfection and Las Ramblas!,"Not majestic on the outside but stunning on the inside the Hotel Claris is in a prime Barcelona location.  You're within easy walking distance of Las Rambles, and close to public transportation.

We found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating.  The breakfast buffet is a veritable feast, and the helpful wait staff will prepare whatever else you might wish.  Our room was spacious with enough hanging space and it was an interior one, thus we were not bothered by any street noises.  

We did find that the safe did not work properly and since it was a Friday, they said they couldn't have a repair man there until Monday so we simply moved our things to the hotel safe.  It would have been nice to have had bottled water in the room, and a clock.  We're assuming it was an oversight as there was only one bar of soap in the bath which my husband and I tossed back and forth between shower and sink.  These are, of course, minor details but things one does expect to find in a five star hotel.  

I should add that there was a special bath amenity - a zippered tote holding six products - shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath gel, mouthwash, cologne, and cotton balls.  This tote was freshened every day.  A nice touch!  Plus, our room was cleaned thoroughly and made up promptly each day.

A return trip to Barcelona will bring us back to the Claris.

19,Loved the Claris,"We spent 2 nights at the Claris after a cruise that ended in Barcelona. Our room was spectacular. The service was wonderful. The concierge recommendations for sightseeing allowed us to cover all of the major sights in our short stay. This hotel is within walking distance of the best part of Barcelona. We ate lunch at the hotel on a terrace on the roof, breakfast at an overflowing buffet on the lower floor, and followed their directions to an excellent seafood restaurant in the vicinity. If you want service, luxury and location, the Claris is for you
",5,2007,08,14
19,Not 5* Grand Luxe,"We arrived at the Claris on a Friday evening and were met from the taxi by a bellboy who took our luggage. Inside our check-in was handled swiftly and efficiently and we were given maps of the city and local information without asking.

The room we had booked was a duplex, which was on the second floor. It did seem strange however that upon entering you find yourself in the bedroom and then have to go up the stairs to the living area. Most duplexes I’ve had in the past have the bedroom upstairs which tends to make for far better use of this type of space.

The next thing you notice is how dark these rooms actually are due to the small window on the lower level while on the upper level there’s no natural light at all. The window overlooks a busy main road and doesn’t open. Traffic noise was evident throughout our stay. While the décor is pleasant the furniture and fabrics are rather on the worn side. The bathroom is very small and rather old fashioned. The shower is extremely powerful but always flooded the floor due to inadequate screening.  The bath products were of the cheap un-named variety. Disappointing for a hotel that’s supposed to be 5* Gran Luxe.

The worst aspect of this room was the very hard and uncomfortable bed. The mattresses are the sort that cave in the middle slightly from overuse. The bed linen is actually real linen, which is a nice touch, but what good is that with a bad mattress? And why no duvet / comforter? Just a cotton bed cover, which again didn’t help. The air-conditioning vent for the bedroom was situated directly over the bed and even on the lowest setting resulted in wafts of chilled air over one’s head while trying to sleep. 

Breakfast was served in a lower ground floor room and was a buffet. Plenty of variety and attentive service.

The small roof top pool wasn’t anything spectacular and with six people around it seemed rather crowded. The adjoining bar did seem to have good views of the surrounding area and I’m sure would be a great drinking venue at night if busy.

All in all a decent hotel with good service. However the very uncomfortable beds let the property down.

19,A wonderful hotel,"We traveled to Barcelona in June, and on the recommendation of our travel agent, we booked the Hotel Claris.  It was delightful.  We were with another couple as well.   We arrived early and they upgraded our rooms.  We found the dining area on the terrace to be one of the finest dining experiences we had in Barcelona.    After a short trip to the south of France, we returned to the Hotel Claris prior to our departure to the States.  The location of the hotel is superb, the staff was superb, and the dining was superb.  We all look forward to returning.
",5,2007,08,06
19,"Confident, Stylish, Self Assured Hotel","We recently returned from a 4 day stay in the Hotel Claris and felt inspired to share the experience.  This hotel is worth booking for any stay in the city.  The location is excellent, and within walking distance of the Passeig de Gracia and Eixample, with its many elegant shops and restaurants.  The hotel interior is an eclectic mix of historical artifacts and  contemporary furnishings, rather than the usual generic modern design template.
The service and attention to detail exhibited by the staff was just the right balance without being intrusive. This is a stylish, confident and self assured hotel.  Indeed the staff almost sensed our requirements and attended to any matters before they arose.
The roof top pool, whilst compact, afforded an escape from the days heat and included a small number of loungers for sunbathing.  
The roof top terrace and bar came to life in the evenings, and included live smooth latin jazz. to help us chill!
This was our third visit to the city in 4 years and the most satisifying stay to date, due largely to the hotel and the quality of the staff.
",5,2007,07,29
19,IGood choice,"We recently stayed at the Claris for 2 nights prior to a cruise.  We booked it because the friends we were travelling with had already booked  a room there and I was a bit skepitcal after reading the mixed reviews on TA.  But we really liked the hotel.  The public spaces are very nice, the staff is quite helpful and our room was very pleasant.  Our room was on the backside of the hotel so we had no noise problem and it was spacious and well appointed.  The bathroom was large and nice.  They offer a free mini-bottle of wine as a welcome gift which is a nice touch.  The concierge suggested a restaurant on the night of our arrival which was very good and made a reservation for us the next night at a restaurant I had selected.  
The location is wonderful for upscale shopping and visiting the some of the Gaudi sights.
",5,2007,05,16
19,It was OK.....,"Because we booked v last minute we had trouble finding a hotel at all, and so we booked this one via last minute.com. Cost about £1350 for the 2 of us and with BA business class flights - as these seemed to be cheaper than economy at certain times due to it being the May bank holiday weekend...anyway....I agree with previous reviews and I am not sure why this hotel is 5* Grand Luxe and a member of the small
luxury hotels (SLH) - especially the Grand Luxe bit.  

We stayed in a duplex room - all of which seem to be all on the 2nd floor - and because we were overlooking the front of the building, we heard the traffic most of the time - although the view was better than over looking the inner courtyard - perhaps ask for a different room on a higher floor. The room was modern and fairly basic - the bed mattress was v firm and there were sheets and a thin blanket which doesn't make for a comfy nights sleep. The bathroom was in need of a spruce up - but the shower was powerful and you had to stand in the bath and then whole of the bathroom floor tended to get a bit wet.  The toiletaries are 'own brand' and are ok. The hotel offers a welcome gift - this was a mini bottle of red wine.

Didn't eat the hotel but menu seemed to be good but a little on the expensive side when you see what the rest of barcelona has to offer -there is only one restaurant and this then relocates to the roof terrace in the summer - perhaps if it wasn't currently on the 1st floor which was v narrow then we would have eaten there.  We ate at the Rita restaurant around the corner towards pg de gracia - but get there at 8.30 when it opens as the queues grow fast - €50 incl tip and wine for 3 courses for 2 - excellant! Also recomment L'Olive restaurant - full of locals and a bit smarter than Rita - but then double the price - was about 10-15 min walk away. The bar was v modern and fairly small. Also - didn't have breakfast as this is €20 pp per day - just pop around the corner and have a croissant!  - this saved us €160 for the 4 nights!

The location of the hotel is v good - and it was lovely to see the Casa Batllo each time we walked the 3 minutes to the pg de gracia.  Wanted to stay in/near Las Ramblas - but some bits looked a bit dark and deserted esp. on a sunday afternoon.  PS all the shops are closed on sunday!  Recommend taking the Bus Turistic to get your bearings.  Wouldn't stay in the Diagonal Mar area at this time of year - perhaps in the height of summer if you want to be near the beach.",3,2007,05,09
19,Fantastic!,"My husband and I booked a last minute city break and decided to go to The Hotel Claris.  Check in was very efficient and our room was on two levels with the bedroom downstairs and sofa and an additional TV upstairs, the room was beautifully decorated with very modern art work.  That evening a bottle of wine and a pack of specialised bath products were brought to our room to welcome us.  Unfortunately we had a very noisy room of people above us who kept us awake from 6am.  We rang down to reception who said they would investigate and apologised.  My husband then went to reception and they were most sympathetic and said we shouldn't have waited two hours before complaining!  We were then moved to a junior suite which was very nice (bigger bathroom etc.) but was only on one level. We slept extremely well the second night.
The Hotel is in an excellent location just off the main shopping street and a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas.  It is also well placed for the open top tourist bus.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful and the hotel is beautifully furnished.  We also spent a few hours at the open air swimming pool which is situated on the roof and was lovely in the sunshine.
A most enjoyable stay.",5,2007,05,02
19,We really enjoyed Hotel Claris,"We recently stayed there for a week, right before Easter, and found the hotel delightful.  We booked a standard with two twin beds.  Aside from the room being a bit stuffy temperature-wise (couldn't open the window), it was overall pleasant and modern.   Nice linens, bathrobe and slippers, turn down service - everything you would expect from a fine hotel.  The service was excellent and staff gracious.  Additionally, it was one block from Passeig de Gracia and a short walk to the Plaza Catalunya, so the location was great.  One evening we could hear a dog barking from a nearby room, but honestly, there was very little to complain about.  I enjoyed it very much and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

19,awful,"Booked this via last minute.com the morning of arrival. The cost for a five star property appeared very good value for money. As always, a big mistake !  I can only assume they keep this horrid little room for that purpose ! Most probably it makes more money than any other room in the hotel. The room was described as a junior suite which it is not. It has a totally seperate pokey, windowless, tiny sitting room. The bedroom has a view of an 'inner courtyard' ie. airless and quite clausterophobic. Bathroom had large corner bath but was small and very contemporary toiletries; ie no face cloths or anyhting more basic than unbranded soap and cheap shampoo. What a shame I would never dream of recommending the property to anyone. It is not suitable for business as facilities are not five star if one has an important day nor located well for sustainable tourism. The staff have been very pleasant which made a difference. My other big complaint is that I went to make a call last evening and attempted to turn down CNN only to realise it was the volume of the TV from the room next door that I could not alter !!

19,Everything was nice apart from my room!,"Stayed here for a weekend, hotel was beautiful and in a great location. You can walk literally two blocks one way and you have Casa Battlo, walk two blocks the other way and you have Casa Milo both Gaudi must sees! It is also very close to the Metro and some great restaurants.
The staff were very helpful and totally on the ball, if we seemed like we needed help they would come to our assistance before we even had a chance to ask. 
The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was my room, it was basic and stuffy as the window wouldn't open and one of the lights above the bed wouldn't switch off. Definitely not 5 star quality. It was also very very noisy being on the main road and reminded me of staying in 2 star hotels in Paris on a college trip - you could hear everything going on outside and in the corridors.
All in all it is a very chic little hotel and feels luxurious as soon as you step inside.
Just make sure you get a decent room.

19,nice location,"The location is perfect for walking around the center of the city.  BCN is quite walk-able and this is a great jumping off point.  The room was a bit too modern for my taste -- I like modern rooms, but not when they are unwelcoming.  The bathroom had nice fixtures.  Not sure it was the best value for the money, but there was nothing to complain about.

19,Not a luxury hotel,"I stayed at the Claris right before Christmas. We booked a junior suite and the room was big and nice. Hotel is beautiful and warm, staff is friendly and professional. The location is worderful, close to Passeig De Gracia and the main sites of the city.
Negative items: HOTEL IS VERY NOISY!!! You can hear people talking in the rooms close to yours, and housekeepers usually scream in the corridors.
Heat didn't work and nobody could fix it; after our request the concierge bring us an old portable radiator.
Bar is expensive, but in line for a deluxe hotel.
",3,2007,01,17
19,not 5 star but....,"My husband and I stayed in the Claris in April this year, to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
The hotel is perfectly situated to explore Barcelona on foot, and a two minuite walk to the nearest tourbus stop.
Our room was more than adequate for our needs, with a lovely bathroom with excellant shower. A particularly nice touch was complimentary aromatherapy bath oil delivered to our room on the first night.
The downside of the room was that the double bed was actually two singles joined together, not particularly romantic!
While it was a bonus to have a rooftop pool, the view was rather disappointing.
We found all staff to be courtious, helpful and friendly but the hotel lacked that certain something expected from a 5 star rating.
Think 4 star when booking and will not be disappointed.

19,Be carefull with 5 Stars in Barcelona,"Got to tell you all, be very carefull with 5 Star Hotels in Barcelona.

This Claris Hotel in calle Pau Claris is far way from what a 5 Star supose to be.

The envioroment is good but the services and the quality of the rooms....

Our toilet was out of work for 2 days, and nobody could make things work.

I could keep on writing here a huge list of things, but I write just to let you all know:

""For some of Barcelona Hotels to see the 5 stars look at the Sky""",1,2006,11,22
19,We found a winner!,"I was in despair when confronted by all the hotels available in Barcelona. Then I noticed the Claris and read that the owner has a collection of antiquities that he features in the hotel. I felt this set the Claris apart from the others and booked it. Right from the beginning I felt that I had made the right choice. I e-mailed the hotel before we left to request a quiet non-smoking room and they assured me this could be done. When we arrived our room wasn't quite ready, so we were shown into the very nice bar and offered free champagne, olives and crisps--an excellent way to start our weekend. There were wonderful fountains and sculptures in the open courtyard that could be seen from the glass elevators as we ascended to our floor. The room was beautifully decorated in various woods, it was just the right size, it overlooked the back so it was quiet and it was very comfortable. After sightseeing for a few hours, we returned to have a bath before dinner and someone was knocking on the door to offer a selection of bath salts and oils! I chose lavender and had a lovely bath with flowers floating in it. We went to the hotel's restaurant, East 47, which was offering a special mushroom tasting menu, which we selected. It proved to be one of the most memorable meals we'd ever had--every dish was exquisite and the service could not have been better. Our waiter helped us choose a very unusual bottle of local white wine which was delicious and went with all the dishes. Breakfast was massive, well presented and also very delicious with a wide variety of food to suit every taste. The location is excellent--close to the amazing Gaudi buildings, yet also not too far to walk to the Gothic district. Taxis are always available. All the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, even going so far as to check us onto our flight and print out our boarding passes on the day we left. I can't think of a better place to stay and highly recommend this to everyone. By the way, there was a decent pool on the roof, but it was too cold to use it in November--a good reason to go back in warmer weather! Try this place and you'll not be sorry. It made our trip really special (especially the little museum of antiquities which you shouldn't miss).
",5,2006,11,16
19,a gem of a hotel,"My husband and I checked into the Hilton Hotel, a recommendation of a friend, but quickly checked out because of old-fashioned decor and its distance from all of the fun things to do in Barcelona.  We got on the internet and reviewed our notes, quickly called the Claris and were lucky to find availability at a very good rate for our 8 day stay.
We are experienced travelers and enjoy staying in 4 and 5 star resorts wherever we go.  From our first phone call to check-out, we were treated like VIP'S by Ricardo and his staff.  We found the Claris to be a charming boutique hotel only a few blocks from the Ramblis.  It is convenient to exciting areas, very friendly and quiet.  The suites are like little apartments but with no kitchen, and we preferred the floor plan that was all on one floor because it felt more spacious, rather than the floor plan where the sitting area was a loft.
We were thrilled with the help and recommendations given to us by Victoria, their Guest Relations Person.  We had some of the very best meals we have ever had thanks to her suggestions (we don't like fish or meat...so eating in Spain was a bit of a challenge for us).  We HIGHLY recommend the Ming Dynasty for delicious Chinese, Bembi for perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented Indian and the magnificently appointed Thai Gardens.  I must add that the breakfasts at the Claris were extremely satisfying and pleasantly served.
We also enjoyed ""hanging out"" at the Magestic Hotel (down the street) for its piano bar and roof-top refreshments and view.  It is a bit pricey, but it gave us the lounge experience that the Claris was lacking.
We look forward to returning to the Claris!

19,"The Claris Hotel, Barcelona","Part of the joy of visiting a lovely city, is a hotel that is convenient to the sights, perfect service, and delightful accommodations. We studied our choice of hotels, and The Claris continued to be a top choice, and our final decision. The Claris is a member of the excellent group of hotels called Small Luxury Hotels located throughout the world. They are expensive, but known for the high quality while staying on the small side with outstanding personal service. 

The Hotel Claris was built in 1992 keeping the facade of the former Palacio Vedruna. Barcelona has been working very hard to upgrade and improve on its elegant architecture, and although the exterior of this hotel appears very old, the interior is an entirely different story. The Claris is a crossroads experience of the past, present and future. Behind the palatial facade you discover a private pre-Columbian Art collection, and one of the most extensive museums of Egyptian relics in Europe. The modern interior is quite a diversion from what you might expect. Everything is crisp and clean, simple, but elegant in design.....almost mysterious. 

We arrived in Barcelona by ship, and were at the hotel at 10:00am. It was too early to check in, however, they were more than gracious to put our luggage in a safe place and invite us to have lunch, or just stroll around the city. We returned several hours later and our room was ready. 

The reception desk was most interesting in appearance with a beautiful burled wood wall. All of a sudden, the person that had been helping us went to check on something and he was gone. The wooden wall was actually secret doors to the back, and with a swift push he disappeared...quick to return, I might add. The staff was most friendly and always willing to be helpful. They arranged a tour for us and best of all gave us a list of the best Spanish brandies and were to buy them. 

All of the 120 rooms, have been decorated with a mixture of modern contemporary and classic styles. There are over 100 antique kilim rugs, 17th and 18th century English and French furniture, and many sculptures from the 2nd to 7th centuries. All rooms are air-conditioned, several phones, satellite TV, a safe, mini-bar, desk, and sofa. The bathrooms are quite the most beautiful, done in coral marble with fresh flowers attached to the mirror in little tubes. We had the standard room, which was a little on the small side, but still a good value at $175 US including a grand breakfast and taxes. 

The hotel has three restaurants, one being the Caviar Restaurant, which didn't appeal to us. However, the main one, on the lower level was where breakfast was served as well as dinner. Breakfast was a buffet style with every imaginable pastry, meat, and more than enough to last you for a week. Several nights we ate dinner there also, where they have a fixed price menu including wine. I loved with spinach soup with scampi! The price per person was about $30....not bad at all, and well worth it. There is a restaurant on the roof, however we were there in the Spring and it was not open yet. 

Yes, we enjoyed this hotel so much, but best of all, it was just one block away from the Paseo de Gracia, the heart of Barcelona. We were able to walk everywhere from this convenient location. 

So, are you looking for a special place to stay while you are visiting this marvelous city? You need to seriously consider the Claris, it is a good value, and a most interesting hotel!
",5,2006,09,22
19,More of the same,"Like previous reviewers, we are mystified by the 5 star accolade.

The location is excellent and we too found the staff exceptionally good. 
Our room, although quiet at the back of the hotel, had a grim view. The decor was well maintained if a bit odd colourwise. The bathroom was OK - good size and well equipped.

The bizarre thing was the lack of sound proofing from, not next door, but above. We could hear every move they made and even voices. Somewhere in the refurb process, something has gone amiss. Fortunately this only effected one of our 3 night stay.

Breakfast was unimaginative although beautifully presented.

I thought the roof terrace was grim - the pool uninviting and it only took a few guests to make the whole area feel packed. High above the city, it was noisy and had no view to speak of.

Barcelona is a great place - better than Madrid because of its seaside location. 

Do use the train to get to the city from the airport, it's cheap and convenient. Once in town, use the open tourist bus to get around - it's excellent value and very frequent, but do look carefully before choosing the Claris.
",4,2006,09,19
19,Great rooftop pool!,"This hotel is overated and over priced, however the pool and bar on the roof overlook the hustle and bustle and was very nice.  Rooms are small, I stayed in suite and it was just a large hotel room, although the marble bathroom was very nice.  I found the staff to be very friendly and the breakfast was great.  Great for a 2-3 night stop over.
",4,2006,08,21
19,Definitely not a 5-star,"I booked this 2-day stay on my day of arrival, as I wasn't happy with a 4* booking I had gotten through Priceline.  I paid the Run of the house rate / $135.00 per night (meaning they give you whatever is available upon arrival) and phoned the hotel before booking to ask if I would be put in a broom closet for this price.  I was assured that I would have a double room for single use so I went ahead with the booking.  When I arrived at the hotel and asked about my room they told me I had a single room.  When I complained, I was told by the person who seemed to be the manager that this was all that I could expect for the rate I paid (not a 5 star reply by any means!).  After some discussion, I was upgraded to a relatively small room with a double (1m60?) bed and a large marble bathroom.  

The rooftop bar and pool are small but wonderful, the fitness room is okay (but no changing room), the elevators give you a spectacular view of the inside of the hotel.   The building is a Barcelona historical landmark, the reason for the slightly strange L-shaped reception that was mentioned previously by a reviewer.  However, I found the room in relatively mediocre condition with cracked paint on the walls and I was definitely not impressed by the lack of: minibar prices anywhere, luggage rack, instructions for the safe and the two tiny pillows on the bed (Marriott is best and also my favourite…!).  

All in all, hotel staff (room service, rooftop bar, housekeeping) was wonderful and very kind.  I would not go back.
",3,2006,08,14
19,nice city hotel,"The hotel is very compfortable with a good hip atmosphere and a lot of artsy ambience. The roof top pool is small but adequate, the bar is good but the views are not special. It's a refreshing place to hang out after a hot day of sightseeing. The area is safe and prosperous but noisy from traffic and so not that pleasant to walk around. You need to take a taxi to the sights except for some of the Gaudi buildings/Sacra Familia. and some restaurants. If there is a similar hotel with a pool and terrace closer in e.g. Ramblas, that may be a better bet. BTW, the price doesnt include breakfast--I e-mailed them just before arrival and they included it as an exception.15 euros would be a lot to have to pay for continental bkfst.
",4,2006,07,24
19,"Very nice, but somewhat overrated","We recently spent five enjoyable nights at the Hotel Claris.  Here are our observations:

Positives:
1.  The staff was extremely cordial, knowledgable, available and spoke English almost flawlessly
2.  Our room was very new, clean and quiet (we were on the 5th floor), and the beds were quite comfortable.  The mini-bar and programmable safe were nice extras.
3.  The bathroom was very modern and clean (but see below), and provided quite a few nice amenities, including bathrobes, slippers, and a nice collection of shampoos, rinses, bath gels and salts, q-tips, razors, etc.
4.  The breakfast buffet (see below regarding price) was very nice.
5.  The rooftop spa/solarium, while small, was a nice touch.
6.  The hotel was located close to Passeig de Gracia, a major shopping hub (similar to 5th Avenue in NYC), and very close to Metro, bus, and Renfe (railroad) stations.
7.  The neighborhood was very upscale, safe, and there were many good restaurants nearby.  The was also a nearby food market that was fantastic (see below).
8.  There were a few major tourist sights within a 10-minute walk (2 Gaudi buildings, and the Sagretta Familla church).
9.  A business office (with internet access) was available at no extra cost.

Negatives:
1.  Our room was exceptionally small and its sitting area was barely adequate.  There was no way we could ever have had dinner in the room comfortably.
2.  Instead of a shower curtain or separate stall, our tub had a swiveling glass panel which made showering difficult and claustrophobic.
3.  The breakfast buffet was ridiculously expensive (20 euros pp), as were all the items in the minibar.  Room service items were beyond expensive (8 euros for coffee?).  
4.  Because the neighborhood was upsale, so were the prices of everything nearby.
5.  Like most hotels in Spain, the room did not have a coffee maker or an iron. (We would have traded the bidet for those items in an instant.)

In general, the hotel was quite nice, but I don't think it qualifies as a five-star hotel.   

There is a spectacular fresh-foods market with an underground supermarket a few blocks away.   I strongly recommend you visit it to stock up on goodies to bring back to your room (like bottles of spring water for 19 cents that in the minibar are priced at 3 euros, as well as wines, fruit, olives, etc.).  That market was one of the high points of the hotel's location for us.
",4,2006,05,16
19,Great hotel - but would choose a different location,"The room was lovely and the service was great.  Complimentary wine and a visiting bath oil maid!  The hotel is just off the main shopping area but in terms of eating, drinking and soaking up the atmosphere the area around the cathedral would be a better choice.  However, we were within walking distance of all the main sites bar the Gaudi park.
",4,2006,05,15
19,3 star in disguise,"Have just returned from a visit to the Claris. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, but we have never seen such a weird shaped lobby.  Certainly not where you'd sit with a cappucino or a cognac and the bar quite akin to a small office canteen. A visit to any 4* Irish hotel would show them how lobbies should be designed!  However the location was excellent and the rooms, though small, were well equipped.  The walls were very thin - noise everywhere.  The rooftop area was very nice with the smallest pool I've ever seen.  Prices not bad. Would certainly return if there was a special offer due to the location.
",3,2006,04,20
19,huge square bed,"An Easter city break for the two of us to sample Barcelona's fabulous sights and food. A warm welcome from the doorman who showed us into the lobby. Not a soul around, no Muzak, no friendly faces but an efficient check-in none the less. Beautiful feature of cascading water and lights greets you when you enter the glass elevators. Our room was a good size and my husband thought it looked sensual! (Must have been the purple 7ft square bed and the fully stocked mini bar.) Lovely antiques scattered around the hotel and rooms and on the top floor is an Egyptian ""museum"" which leads you to East 47 restaurant, which we visited on our first night but unfortunately didn't have any ambience or guests apart from us. Food was quite good if not a little slow in turning up at the table. Good buffet breakfast is served in the uninviting basement room. This is like a corporate room with no atmosphere and silent apart from the half-a-dozen or so other guests whispering into their cold meat and rolls, although staff attention was excellent. Check-out was a cold affair. No eye contact and he spoke to his colleague all the time and didn't even ask if we enjoyed our stay.  Would suite business travellers. 
You must try the restaurant called La Maison du Languedoc-Roussillon on C.de Pau Claris 77.(French-Catalan) We were greeted by the chef himself and had a fabulous meal there. Waiter was very helpful with our choice of food. As we got up to leave, the chef came over to say goodbye.",4,2006,04,14
19,Not great,"You expect certain things from a hotel that bills itself as 4/5 star. A decent size room, a window that looks out at something other than an airshaft, a mattress that is at least a few steps above something you slept on in college, nice soft linens...the list goes on. While the staff was top notch, attentive and tried very hard to make things right, The Claris is not luxurious by any stretch of the imagination and is overpriced for what it is. Boutique hotels are known for small rooms and minimalist decor so if this is your preference, by all means stay there. The lobby is a bit depressing and much smaller than it looks in pictures. The bar is tiny. The location, however, is excellent.
",3,2006,04,05
19,Good but not great,"Had high hopes of the Claris but was disappointed by the blandness of the small rooms, curious lobby, tiny bar and subterranean breakfast areas. It just all seemed a bit poorly styled, and really wasnt hitting the boutique heights I'd hoped. Location is great though, the staff were all very attentive and the food fine but compare it to the Omm and it feels overpriced and doesn't hit the mark.
",3,2006,03,18
19,Wonderful Claris,"The hotel team is excellent. The service during our recent stay was great and the customer service went above and beyond to make our stay most enjoyable.

 We had a wonderful day, although of course much too short. The suite was delightful and the staff were all helpful and efficient. Of course, no-one more so than the concierge who organised our stay efficiently. 

We love the Claris
",5,2005,12,18
19,"Boutique hotel, boutique size rooms","This hotel is very well located, near charming Passeig de Gracia. The arquiteture is impressing, and the lobby is nice. Service is quite attentive.
Rooms are too little, boutique sized. Even the junior suite we got was sub-compact. They have good, but paid, wi-fi access, but the suite has not a desk to use the laptop. The bar, with poor service, is sad...
",3,2005,10,03
19,Brilliant place to stay,"Top notch hotel, great location, excellent rooms, friendly helpful staff.

Located a block away from prime shopping area, restaurants, etc.

Exciting lobby, with modern glass, polished steel and stone atrium,
with a soft flowing water cascade.

Rooms are stylish, comfortable. well furnished.

Staff are friendly, smile, speak good english, and are very willing to help.

Great buffet breakfast, including fruits, cheeses, breads, pastries,
and great omelets.

In walking distance of must see Gaudi buildings, including
+ Casa Mila La Pedrer 'the quarry', an unusual, Expressionistic, very decorative apartment building - with good informative tour inside.
+ Sagrada Familia cathedral, wonderful church still under construction.
",5,2005,09,16
19,A cool Hotel,"The hotel has very nice rooms. The Roof Terrace restaurant was fab and the evening entertainment by the pool was really laid back, fun and chilled out. Generally good service and pleasant staff. A friend told us to check out the hotel online at TabletHotels and we were so surprised to find this fantastic site filled with the most amazing boutique hotels. The site was so easy to navigate through and there was so much information on this hotel and others that we already have our next vacation planned. I would certainly come back here again.
",5,2005,08,30
19,Dark and Noisy,"I would agree with all the negative comments and wish I had heeded them.

The rooms are very small - even a junior suite is not large enough for three people.  Two people cannot pass between the bed and the wall!

Noise - yes, you can hear between the walls easily.  If someone coughs in the next room, you will hear it in your room.  This is especially true in the anteroom of the suites.

Staff - more interested in telling us about how to use their card system to save electricity rather than telling us anything about the room, the hotel or the city.

Staff - conceirge did nothing but give out wrong information.  Told us hours of things that were closed, etc.  Said she would book a car rental for us no problem/ then said need to do 2 - 3 weeks in advance.

Reviews of water pressure are correct; it is low.

If you stay here, be very choosy about what room you accept - we had a room at the bottom of what amounts to an air shaft - so dark that it was depressing.  Luckily, the room was so small that we didn't want to stay in it anyway.

Maid service - weak - very nice to have a bag with bottles of toiletries, but when half of them are mouthwash and the other half are body milk and you have no shampoo, you start to wonder.

Pool is very very small - really just for a jump in and cool off.  Views from roof are not great.

After we complained, manager tried to make better but this was already 5 days into a 6 day stay so we had given up.

Would definitely NOT rec'd if you are looking for 5 star pampering and luxury.

Also, would disagree that this is a great location.  Seemed out of the way for most everything.  Far from beaches, and clubs and not all that close to many of the best shops and the trendiest neighborhoods.  If you are familar with NYC, I would compare it to Park and 88th steet. By subway or cab you can get anywhere, but when you go out the door of the hotel there is really  nothing.

Lobby is pretty, but so what - with the smokers sitting in it, it becomes not usuable.  Free internet was helpful.
",2,2005,08,15
19,Fantastic,"We stayed at the Claris a few weeks ago and had a very pleasant stay. Staff was friendly and helpful.
It is a fantastic hotel with a great location.
",5,2005,07,21
19,beautiful decor,"The hotel is beautiful; a small lobby was cozy for our children to relax.  Pool a big plus.  Location was superb. Staff was friendly.  Main complaint was that the hotel has wooden floors and thus we could hear EVERYTHING from rom to room.
",4,2005,06,05
19,"Too corporate, no character","This hotel was a disappointment.   From its literature I expected a very individual hotel with lots of character but in reality this is just another corporate hotel.   The breakfast area was rather miserable and in the basement and the food itself was pretty average.   We ate in the restaurant one night where the food was fine but the restaurant was empty and we felt rushed to finish.  The bar is tiny and once again charmless.   The service was fine.  They were moderately helpful about hotel bookings although I thought it was slightly inappropriate to ask me how old I was when I asked for a restaurant recommendation.  The pool is tiny and freezing cold.  To call their fitness equipment a gym is a massive stretch of the imagination.  They had three bits of equipment tucked in a corner and only two were working.  Othere than that generally it was ok in a dull kind of way.
",3,2005,05,08
19,NYE in Barcelona,"The hotel was ok, not a 5 star, more like a 4.  Rooms were hot, so you needed to open the windows, but the street side is too loud to keep them open while you sleep.  

As we were there for New Year's, we solicited from the hotel info about where to go. The hotel proceeded to recommend only the most expensive places in their large binder of information.  When I looked through the binder myself, I noticed there were many more choices (for less money) than what was offered.  I proceeded to make my reservations myself.  I then asked the hotel for directions to the restaurant, and they made sure to make a note on their form that we (hotel guests) were going to that specific restaurant. I could only presume they would then call the restaurant to claim their portion of the commission.  It then became clear why the hotel was only recommending the most expensive restaurants (€120 and above).  As one pointed out in my group, this was not behavior becoming to a supposedly 5 star establishment.

19,"Great, amazing, superb hotel","I stayed here from 10th Dec to the 13th Dec with my girlfriend. The staff were amazing and extremely helpful. There English was also really good. Every night before we went out we went to East 47 bar to have some cocktails which were very very tasty and well made. The rooms are quite small, but it was perfect for 2 people. We had an amazing view which looked over the busy street. You could sit in the window with a glass of wine watching the world go by. The roof top terrace is also amazing. I am defiantly going to go back as soon as possible. Thank you Hotel Claris for an amazing weekend!!!!
",5,2004,12,16
19,"Stylish, clean but small rooms","We stayed here for 3 nights with our 11 year old boy and baby girl all in one room. The room was not quite big enough for us all, but we all managed to squeez in. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was clean. The rooftop swimming pool and terrace were a delight and the water was swimmable even in Late September (I don't think the pool is heated). If you prefer the Eixample to the Old Town, the location of the Claris is ""estupendo!"". The only complaint I have is that the staff service for the breakfast was absolutely attrocious (no problems with the food though). I had to ask four times for a baby chair (they just kept forgetting) and when I broke a plate by accident, they didn't clean it up off the floor. My advice is to eat the breakfast in your room! By the way, the Gaudi houses are fantastic. What an imagination that guy had!!!!!!!!!
",4,2004,12,03
19,Solid Hotel - Not Super Deluxe,"We spent 5 nights here in Nov. '04. Great location and friendly staff, but rooms are small and poorly ventilated. Air conditoner did not work and room became a sauna after a bath. Ask for a non-smoking room if you don't smoke, overwhelming cigarette smell in other rooms. A solid four star hotel - not a super-deluxe five star property.
",4,2004,11,23
19,Fabulous location and staff,"We had a wonderful package for 5 nights at the Claris and enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel is so centrally located we could walk just about everywhere. Shopping is around the corner. The hotel is perfectly situated a block away from the busy street in a quieter residential area. The staff went out of their way to tend to our every need. The service they showed far surpassed the service I have experienced at many 5 star hotels worldwide. I would highly recommend this hotel and in the summer the rooftop pool and restaurant look tremendous!
",5,2004,11,10
19,Good Location but...,"We booked here at the last minute.  The staff was nice and the location is good, but I dont think it is worth the money to stay here.  The rooms are quite standard and ours smelled so bad of smoke that we had to move.  Usually, I dont mind a smoking room as long as it is fairly aired out but even the bellman agreed this was too strong.  The bathrooms are very nice.  This hotel was fine and the lobby pretty but if you are going to pay the money, I suggest maybe an alternative. This hotel may be better suited for a corporate stay.
",3,2004,10,20
19,Mixed Impressions,"We stayed one week in the hotel. Very attentiv and helpful staff. Our room was dark. You cannot open the window. The great hit of the hotel is the open swimmigpool on the rooftop.

19,Sheer luxury,"Spent one night in Claris. Could have spent a week there. Wonderful hotel in a lovely, safe area. Very close to Sagrada Familia and the shopping street, Passeig del Gracia. Plenty of restaurants and excellent tapas bars nearby.Swimming pool and small gym on 7th floor of hotel. Very spacious rooms and excellent service.  Got us a very good deal on car hire at short notice.
",5,2004,08,24
19,Great Spot to Relax,"Just returned from a 4 day stay at The Claris in early August 2004. The hotel is lovely and staff is very helpful. It's just a couple blocks from the main shopping area and very convenient to subway, etc.
We had a duplex style room which was very nice. Great sitting area upstairs and plenty of room downstairs for bed/bath.
Pool on the rooftop terrace was a great end-of-day relaxation spot. Only complaint was too few lounge chairs available for guests.
Only problem was the last night there a VERY loud family must have checked in to the room next door and soundproofing seemed non-existent. After 2 hours of non-stop yelling, jumping, etc. and the clock hitting Midnight...we called the desk. Who must have done something, as noise stopped soon after. But, it would have been very annoying had it been that loud during the entire stay. We heard nothing before this, so don't  know if room was empty or previous guests were quiet. 
But, other than that...a great place to stay.
",4,2004,08,18
19,Blissful... trust me,"I was a bit skeptical about booking this hotel because of the mixed reviews, but I decided to give it a go, book for a night, see if I liked it or go elsewhere if not. 

On arrival I was eagerly greeted by the concierge, happy and friendly staff at reception, and my baggage, readily ported to my room. The hotel was very stylishly decorated and true epitome of 'boutique'. Room was fully stocked with everything you'd expect from a 5 star... plus complimentary wine. The only downer I found was the CD player, which could do with some upgrading, including limited choice of cds. The roof top pool was a good size... not everyone trains for the olympics.The food at the roof top restaurant was divine... cocktails, dj... everything was up to standards. The area was upmarket and location very central. Obviously I spent the rest of my days there (4nights)... Being out most of the day and having the comfort of returning to my cosy suit was just bliss.. 

I have stayed in many fabulous hotels.. compared to Hotel Arts in Barcelona, I would rate this a 4 star. But then, Hotel Arts is in a class of it's own.

19,Best hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is brilliant, the staff are friendly and very helpful, they have superb knowlege of where to go. They supply maps and guide books (don't forget to ask for a book of discount vouchers).

The beds are very comfortable, complimentary wine and mints, marble en-suite, fully adjustable quiet air-con.

Didn't try Restaurants but heard they were superb. Rooms cleaned twice a day with mints left on bed.

Complimentary tickets to local egyptian museum, pool on roof, glass sided lifts overlooking courtyard with water garden. 10 min walk to two
Gaudi houses.

Very Romantic!

19,"top hotel, great location, terrific staff","we stayed at the claris in early july 2004 for a week, business and pleasure, and were very pleased with the hotel and staff. it's a funky mixture of modern and old, great roof restaurant and cafe, pool and little workout room. awesome views! barcelona is expensive, breakfasts are too expensive in most hotels, but the location cannot be beat, and it's easy to get a more reasonable breakfast elsewhere. lots of good tapas places around, as well. well worth it if you can afford it! i'd recommend it highly.

19,"Disappointing, don't waste your money there",Were booked at this hotel with my husband before we went on a cruise and were very disappointed. Staff is unwelcoming and hotel is cold. Have an egyptian museum but does not warm up the hotel. Left the hotel after 1 night and booked a hotel next door (Majestic) which was great.,1,2004,05,09
19,Good hotel choice,"Stayed here for three nights 21st Nov. Upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was spacious. Door man was very helpful as was check in staff who both assisted in things to do whilst here. Only down point was no iron in room. However they do offer ironing services for you at 9euros per item which we thought was ridiculous. Nice location.",4,2003,11,25
19,Great hotel in Central Barcelona,"This is an excellent hotel. I've stayed there three times and have been pleased each time. The rooms are comfortable and well styled. The bar and pool on the roof are a wonderful oasis in the heart of Barcelona. 
And the location is perfect. Can't see why anyone could be unhappy with this place...",5,2003,11,13
19,not a 5 star hotel,"we stayed at the Claris in october2003.The suite was shabby and dark ,it needed up grading.the hotel is cutting edge modern in its public rooms. The waterfall, the bonzai area a nice touch to view from the glass elevators. The 47 dinning room and staff were excellent.We would not stay there again it is a very cold place. We moved to the Avendia Palace which we found to be a much more comodious hotel.The claris does not seem to care very much for its patrons",2,2003,11,05
19,Sublime,"I have stayed at the Claris three times and have been disappointed yet. 
The entire staff speaks english , the rooms are small but very nicely furnished. Be nice to the staff and they will upgrade you. The rooftop terrace at night ( summer ) has a live DJ. You will not want to leave.",5,2003,11,03
19,Style over function....,"Have just got back from a weekend at the Claris and I have to say I was not overly impressed.

A good hotel...but not 5 star, it is interesting to see that my thoughts concur with a lot of what has been written, to summarise; indifferent reception staff, nice rooms but you would expect that for the price....giving CD players to people is fine....but not at 3am when you are trying to sleep.....the soundproving if there is any is rubbish.....hot buffet was anything but...and the ""gym"" is laughable...

On a more positive note....the doorman/barman were helpful and the bar is nice..East 47 produces some stylish food...visually the hotel is excellent....complimentry wine nice...

You can but hope for considerate neighbours....

Andrew, UK",3,2003,08,25
19,Ultimately disappointing,"Spent 4 nights at the Claris in July. My wife and I stayed in a 'Junior Suite' and our children (21 and 16) in a twin. Doorman excellent, reception throughout our stay generally poor - slow, not efficient and not helpful. The first 5 star luxury hotel I've ever stayed in with no Concierge. With poor in room information and no concierge you need good reception staff in an unfamiliar City. Doorman and excellent barman in downstairs bar did the best they could to help us (and others) find restauarants, attractions etc. Our suite was a poor room. Spacious enough but infacing and dark. Do not be tempted to pay the extra money for a suite. Our childrens much cheaper room was bright and outward facing and much more attractively designed and furnished. Most of the frills you would expect from a 5 star - robes, slippers and good toiletries. Shower in the bathtup even in the suite must be a minus. 
Very comfortable beds. Breakfast excellent with service to match. 
Driven out of the rooftop terrace bar/restaurant by rude manager so didn't eat there. East 47 as good as they say. Took forever to check out. In general a hotel that thinks it's a lot better than it really is. A good 4 star overall, certainly when working seemingly at half pace in off season July. We will stay at the Majestic next time",2,2003,07,29
19,Expensive and only so-so,"We stayed at the Claris for 5 nights of our Honeymoon. We decided to splurge for this special occastion and stayed at the Claris (in particular because it was one of the few in Barcelona with a pool).

They advertise sound-proofed rooms, but we doubt that (maybe from the street only). We could hear one of our neighbors' radio and called the front desk to have them address the problem 3 times and finally asked to switch rooms because the noise was still there (because the front desk never handled the problem?)

The rooftop pool was cool, but very small. The rooms were also very modern and clean with tub/shower, a toilet, and a bidet. Cleaning service was adequate. We ordered room service one night and it was sub-standard. Our suite was bi-level with the sitting area on the upper area that was about 8 steps up (very, very inconvenient for room service as we had to carry everything up there - or eat on the bed), and the bed was in the lower area. Decent location, but we wouldn't stay there again - just too expensive for what we thought would be a very ""cool"" hotel.",3,2003,07,28
19,The Claris is superb,"The Claris is a contemporary hotel with all the fine touches. They were able to accommodate me with an early check-in at 8:30 AM, which was much appreciated.

The lobby has 3 full size glass elevators that were always available. 
Our room may have been a touch small as compared to a US hotel but is relatively large for a European City hotel. The bathrooms are exquisite as they are done in marble with all the trimmings. Double sinks, luxurious bathrobes, slippers and a bottle of wine were all there to greet us. At night the beds are turned down with chocolate mints left on the pillow. The room windows have motorized shutters that act as room darkeners along with eliminating any city noise.

We took advantage of the rooftop pool daily. Also, the two complimentary computers that were located off the lobby were equipped with Internet Service, making E-mail a breeze. One other surprise was the complimentary fax service (Transmission from Spain to the USA) that they provided. They fulfilled any and all requests of my party.

Breakfast in the morning ranged from smoked salmon to fresh fruit. All in all, this Hotel has a great location and earns its 5 Star G.L. 
rating.",5,2003,07,25
19,Great hotel,Geat hotel in an ecellent location. Loved the roof top swimming pool and the close proximity to things. About a 15-20 minute walk to Los Rambles. Staff was mostly very fiendly.,4,2003,06,18
19,"Cool, but Too Expensive","Spent two nights here. Our Junior Suite consisted of a 3 inch step-down from bed area to sitting area. Teeny closet. Large bathroom, but bath/shower combo & no separate toilet. Staff were sometimes friendly, sometimes cool. Doormen & porters were excellent. Excellent room service. Enjoyed the bar & Restaurant 47 - casual, yet hip & good food, friendly service. Don't know if I'd stay here again for the price. Nice location.",4,2003,06,11
19,Disgraceful service for a 5-star hotel,"Having staying for two night at the Claris last month, I can honestly say I have never experienced such rudesss, off-handedness and indifference. If I sound disgruntled, imagine having you wife barked at at check-in, a bag going missing from you hotel room, spending three hours in a police station compiling a report on this theft, and then being told amongst other things that the Claris they don't believe that have done any wrong. We were not even offered any compensation, being told business was business. I am not a demanding person, and this was supposed to be a relaxing and special weekend away. I have stayed in anything from  hostels in Wales to Sea villas in the Maldives. Naturally I will never stay at the Claris hotel again, and I just wanted to warn you of our experience as there are very few methods of come-back for what we went through. feel feel to e-mail if you ant to hear more details ! Given the number of superb hotels in Barcelona, I'd suggest staying elsewhere. I have since stayed at the Tryo Apollo which was superb.",1,2003,02,14
19,The best in the city!,"Fantastic hotel but expensive.  However, luxury bedrooms, spacious and stylish public areas, excellent food and wines, attentive and friendly staff and a stunning interior never came cheap.  The Egyptian museum on the first floor is worth a visit and the rooftop terrace gives fine views over the city.  Probably the best hotel in Barcelona.
",5,2003,01,06
19,Very correct treatment. Very quiet hotel and very family friendly,"In most hotels in this chain and where I always try to stay, it breathes a friendly atmosphere, almost familiar so I am very comfortable. This time I have not been able to use the facilities for schedule reasons, but the peace of mind that the hotel is to repeat.",5,2024,07,06
19,Noisy room and paid spa entrance,"Nice hotel in an excellent location. Cleanliness ok, friendly staff.
Criticalities:
The room, a junior suite, on the fifth floor, did not have a soundproof window, so the noise of the traffic below could be heard loud and clear
Entrance to the Spa (not just the extra services) for hotel guests is subject to a fee. Never seen in a 5 star hotel
Two (decent) spritzes on the terrace, paid over 30 euros, served with a bowl of popcorn. Definitely exorbitant.
So, overall, the price paid is not worth the overall quality of the structure.",2,2024,05,04
19,Expensive and uncomfortable to work,"Uncomfortable hotel. Small rooms. They make you pay upfront with basic service before even giving you the room. The desk comes with drawers and you can't even put your legs in. To make matters worse, they don't have chairs and they give you a stool. The worst hotel if you have to work, even for 2 hours. What back pain! Internet speed of the last century. In summary. Expensive, uncomfortable and poor service. On the contrary, it is beautiful and elegant. It depends what you are looking for.",1,2024,04,27
19,Location - Top breakfast,"We stayed a few nights at this hotel, we had a really good time, high points: location - breakfast - customer care. We will definitely return.",4,2024,04,24
19,Modern and comfortable structure in the center,"We always felt ""pampered"" by all the staff.
An exemplary kindness to say the least.
The only flaw in the room was that there was no full-height mirror, the only one present was in the bathroom. The entire hotel was always pervaded by a wonderful scent.",5,2024,01,30
19,Location and cleanliness are the strong points!,"Excellent location next to Paseig de Gracia and within 15 minutes walk of many points of interest. Comfortable bed and very clean room. Some details to improve but nothing transcendental: coffee machine that was not clear where to use, uncomfortable sofa, somewhat basic bathroom amenities.
Very kind staff",4,2024,01,15
19,A wonderful holiday in a wonderful hotel,An elegant hotel in the center of Barcelona equipped with excellent service and staff who are very attentive to the needs of guests. On the terrace you can enjoy gourmet dishes in a beautiful restaurant and in the rooms and on one of the floors there is a wonderful exhibition of pre-Columbian art. We will definitely be back.,5,2024,01,15

The staff of 10, at reception, at breakfast... the very original rooms. We were in a beautiful junior suite with a jacuzzi!!!! very complete breakfast.
We will definitely repeat!",5,2024,01,10
19,Did not meet expectations,"Veryyyy loud, you could hear the workers talking in the hallways. The bathrooms are not 5☆, sometimes the elevators took a while. I think that with that price you can find a better Hotel.",3,2024,01,05
19,New Year's Eve in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel!
Spacious room, very clean, excellently soundproofed. Very pleasant fragrance throughout the entire structure. Fantastic breakfast. Extremely professional and at the same time friendly and kind staff. Pampered throughout your stay! Thank you with all my heart.",5,2024,01,03
19,It is not what is expected from a hotel of this category.,"Junior suite with a small window overlooking a courtyard, with a small living room at the entrance without window or natural light, not to mention the size...there are undoubtedly better options in the area. I definitely wouldn't recommend it.",2,2023,12,10
19,We expected much more,"We stayed one night. The hotel is small but very nice, the service has been very good during the time we have spent at the hotel, however the room has deeply disappointed us.
We took an executive double and, although the room was smaller and triangular in shape (they didn't look like that in the photos), it was similar to what we had seen, although it seemed small to us. The problem is that the bathroom was very old, it really needs a renovation for a long time and it looks NOTHING like what I have seen in the photos, nothing to see. It may have just been our bad luck and they gave us an unrenovated one, but it was a 3-star bathroom (not a 5-star G.L., sorry).
Also, in the morning we were woken up by traffic noise at 7-8 in the morning, the soundproofing was really bad being on the 6th floor.
Therefore, very disappointed with the room. For one night it is a very well located hotel with many services but I would not spend more than one night in a similar room given similar prices in other hotels we have been to in the area.
When checking out they did not ask us how the room was, which I have not productively mentioned.",4,2023,12,07
19,"Incredible location, price and quality","The hotel is incredible both in location and quality-price, you have everything. The staff is super friendly and super helpful which is something that many places lack. I was super happy with my stay and would definitely book with them again.",5,2023,10,12
19,"""Moments Claris""","We have celebrated our 27th Wedding Anniversary and it has been a success. The facilities, the staff, the very complete breakfasts have left us impressed once again. This is the third time we have visited this Hotel and I would like to convey from these small lines the feeling of pleasure, relaxation and well-being that this visit leaves in your body. Thank you for these ""Moments Claris""",5,2023,09,15
19,Simply perfect,"Kindness, availability, professionalism. We are welcomed with a smile and we leave with great melancholy. Excellent breakfast, excellent service, pampered and recommended choices. We will remember everyone with great pleasure, from those who welcomed you at the door to the staff at the Claris Terrace. I hope to come back soon. Highly recommended!!!!!!",5,2023,09,02
19,too much noise,"I was in a room where noises were always present, whether the noise of the machines throughout the night or early in the morning due to construction work in progress. Unfortunately it was too noisy. Plus I was in a 2-story suite where it was impossible to have an adequate temperature, it was too hot upstairs and too cold downstairs, a real disaster.",2,2023,08,30
19,Nice and well located hotel,"Hotel Claris is very well located in Barcelona, near Paseo de Gracia, Las Ramblas, the Gracia neighborhood and monuments such as the Sagrada Familia and Gaudi's houses.

The hotel facilities are average. It is worth highlighting the rooftop with a bar and pool that, if you are lucky, you can lie down in the sunbeds they have (they are normally occupied by guests who are not in the sunbeds).

The service is regular too. We had problems with check-in (more than an hour late) and in general a treatment with little interest in making your stay unique and more wanting you to spend more money. As a comment, the standard breakfast offered by the hotel is not worth it for the price offered.",3,2023,08,09
19,Cuartos sin mantenimiento ,"Las paredes manchadas , rayadas y cuarteadas.  Una falta de mantenimiento visible, sin atención de la gerencia , deplorable para un hotel que se encuentra dentro los small luxury hotels y coloca que es un 5 estrellas . ",2,2023,06,25
19,No es 5* GL,"Las habitaciones son muy pequeñas (incluso la senior suite) las camas son también muy pequeñas, hacer peticiones a recepción es como hablar con una pared, no te hacen caso, pedimos en tres ocasiones durante la tarde que nos prepararan el sofá-cama para nuestra hija y no lo hicieron, llegamos a la 01.20 de la madrugada y seguía igual, aún tuvimos que esperar 20 mins más a que vinieran a prepararlo. No es para nada un 5* GL, diferencia extrema entre calidad y precio.",1,2023,05,28

La stanza assegnatami era una sorta di entry level  ma per 500  euro a notte mi aspetto almeno una pulizia impeccabile ed un divano letto con materasso passabile. Mia figlia ha trovato un anellino di plastica in un grumo di polvere sotto il letto!  Stanza affacciata sul cavedio senza luce. Ma forse altre stanze a prezzi diversi saranno almeno come esposizione sicuramente migliori!",3,2023,05,03
19,Leider 5 Sterne nicht wert,"Gebucht habe ich extra eine Junior Suite; bekommen habe ich zuerst eine Junior Suite Duplex. Hätte ich das gewollt, dann hätte ich das gebucht!

Meine Koffer wurden sofort auf die Junior Suite Duplex gebracht!

Nachdem ich umgezogen bin in die Junior Suite, habe ich lange auf die Koffer warten müssen!
Die Minibar wurde nicht aufgefüllt, obwohl das Zimmer gereinigt wurde. Daraufhin habe ich bei der Rezeption angerufen. Mir wurde gesagt, dass gleich jemand kommt!
Nach 2 Stunden ist immer noch keiner gekommen; also habe ich wieder angerufen, daraufhin kam dann einer nach 40 Minuten!
Die Zimmer sind sehr dunkel!
Ich muss sagen, dass dieses Hotel einem 4 Sterne Hotel entspricht!
Leider bin ich besseres gewohnt!",3,2023,04,18

Vergleichsweise teuer (zumal ohne Frühstück). Teures Frühstück (EUR 36). Insgesamt eher 4*+
Schneller Check-In, mit einem Glas Cava zur Begrüßung.
Das Zimmer geschmackvoll eingerichtet, wenn auch in einem ungewöhnlichen (mezo-amerikanisch/asiatisch) Stil. Die Junior Suite mit zwei abtrennbaren Räumen hat ein wenig enttäuscht. Das Wohnzimmer (mit Schlafsofa, das in ausgezogenem Zustand so ungünstig gestaltet ist, dass man nicht mehr drauf sitzen kann) hatte gar kein Fenster. Das Schlafzimmer nur ein kleines Fenster in einen winzigen, dunklen Innenhof.
Schönes Badezimmer, mit guten Amenities. Das Bett war sehr bequem.
Sehr schöner Dachgarten mit Restaurant, Bar und Pool.
Der Service war freundlich, aber nicht perfekt. Die (kostenlose) Minibar wurde an einem Tag nicht aufgefüllt. Angebrochene (noch nutzbare) Amenities wurden entfernt, aber nicht wieder aufgefüllt. Für 5* übliche Goodies wie Aufdeckservice.
Kostenloser Zugang zum Ägyptischen Museum.",4,2023,04,15

Der Service und die Freundlichkeit des gesamten Personals sind großartig und wohltuend.

Das Frühstück ist sehr gut und reichhaltig mit einem sehr aufmerksamen Service und ließ bei uns keine Wünsche offen.
Die Bar auf der Dachterrasse ist ein sehr schöner Ort, um sich zu treffen, für einen Drink am Nachmittag oder einen Sundowner.

Davanti alla stanza sostava sempre due carrelli delle pulizie e c’era un continuo rumore. La spa è una presa in giro con un bagno turco/sauna all’interno di una minuscola palestra senza neppur una doccia.
Il personale è brusco. Ci hanno prenotato una trasferta senza dirci che le frazioni di ora venivano pagate per intero ed una gita a Cadaqués ci è costata 900 euro. È incredibile che qualcuno lo consideri un 5 stelle.",1,2023,01,21

Sehr freundliches Personal.
Zimmerservice wird übertrieben.

En recepción te atienden con exquisita amabilidad , y en mi caso, resolviendo diligentemente un pequeño percance en el que necesité servicio urgente de lavandería. La habitación que ocupé me pareció espaciosa, iluminada y limpia, decorada con gusto, dando un toque étnico una figura pre-colombina que configuraba el estilo propio de la misma. Por poner un pero, la distribución del baño, a mi juicio se podrían cambiar de posición  algunos elementos del baño. Servicio de habitaciones presto a lo que necesites. Restaurante y piscina en la terraza que hay que visitar. Mención especial al canelón de txangurro que me pareció una exquisitez.",5,2022,08,17
19,"Una pena, no se merece las 5* GRAN LUJO...","Me esperaba a ver si me iban a contestar después del cuestionario que rellene en el mail directamente enviado por el hotel pero me da que no...
El hotel esta super bien ubicado, los porteros/botones super amables y atentos ya que íbamos con carro de bebe. 
La gente de la recepcion simpatica, aunque podrían avisar que cuando llegas a los 300Euros de extra te hacen cargo a la tarjeta. Me parece de muy mal gusto, como se paga a la entrada, se deja la tarjeta para garantía.
La gente del desayuno son muy pocos amables y atentos, eso si estaban atentos a la hora de cerrar el desayuno... Nos querían dar mesa en medio del comedor, pero pedimos mas privacidad con la niña, para no molestar si se pusiese a correr. Tardaron mucho en traer un té y un latte... 25Euros para un desayuno con poca variedad. Lo informe en recepción que el trato no era adecuado. 
El servicio del SPA increíble, ellos si merecen 5*. las terapeutas son muy muy profesionales.
En fin, un hôtel de luge en el papel y por los precios pero el servicio no sigue, íbamos para tener un` experiencia pero no la tuvimos. La suite no tiene ventana al exterior.
La piscina es agradable aunque la pensábamos mas grande en las fotos, pero la temperatura esta perfecta.
No repetiremos, una pena.",2,2022,08,11

Auf Nachfrage bekamen wir den Satz: wenn Sie hier übernachten wollen, dann bringen Sie doch ihre Koffer selber rein. Oben das Restaurant ist immer ausgebucht, das Hotel bietet also den Gästen nichts zu essen an. Man wird weiter geschickt in umliegende Restaurants. Die Zimmer sind sehr dunkel eingerichtet. Sollten Sie das Zimmer 118 angeboten bekommen, Finger weg. Es ist dunkel wie in einem Keller. Insgesamt ist dieses Hotel maximal drei Sterne. Wir reisen sehr viel durch die Gegend und sind wie auch in den zuletzt lesbaren Bewertungen höchst unzufrieden. Buchen Sie ein anderes Hotel. Es ist wirklich unverschämt, wie das Personal am Pool mit den Gästen umgeht: nicht nur dass man sehr lange wartet, bis jemand kommt, sondern es ist unfreundlich.

19,L'illusione di un  Hotel a 5 stelle: una pessima esperienza,"Soggiornando in questo Hotel ho riscontrato aspetti più negativi che positivi. L'aspetto positivo è indubbiamente la posizione centralissima. Per quanto riguarda gli aspetti negativi è da sottolineare la dimensione della stanza proposta come suite tripla ma sicuramente non adatta per tre persone, c'era pochissimo spazio per muoversi. Non parliamo del bagno al quale si accedeva senza la porta....Veramente inadeguato! Pessima e poco professionale anche la gestione del personale delle pulizie ( intromissione nella stanza per la sistemazione e la pulizia a tardo pomeriggio quasi ad ora di cena con noi ospiti dentro). Ma il peggior aspetto è da riferire al personale della reception, parte di esso purtroppo si è mostrato non curante nei confronti di noi clienti che non siamo stati trattati come si deve...tante difficoltà ad ogni richiesta di aiuto, non siamo riusciti ad avere la stampa di una carta d'imbarco nemmeno dopo due giorni dalla richiesta.

Und was wäre wenn einer verletzt wäre? Kommt mir so vor, als würde Hotel Personal mit der Bande arbeiten und Informationen über Gäste und ihre Wertsachen weitergeben. Man musste wirklich wissen, dass die Uhr überhaupt existiert, denn sie war stets unter Pullover verdeckt, und in 3 Sekunden während Abschied einfach von der Hand gerissen? An solche Zufälle glaube ich persönlich nicht. 

Außerdem, Schrecklicher Service, Leute die sich um nichts kümmern, so tun als würden sie einen verstehen mit netten Lächeln, ziehen aber ihr Ding durch. Man muss 30 mal bitten lediglich zwei separate Decken zu bringen, einfach sinnlos. 

Ein Hotel mit schönen Ambiente, viel deko, dass die internen Fehler aber nicht überdecken kann. Der Manager vor Ort sitzt wie ein Roboter, außer „i’m Sorry” fällt ihm nichts ein. 

Es wäre vielleicht ok für ein Hotel, der sich nicht als 5* Hotel präsentiert. 

Jeder Gast, der neben oder vorm Hotel auf Taxi oder Freunde wartet muss darauf vorbereitet sein Opfer eines Überfalls zu werden, und als Entschuldigung ein trockenes „sorry“ zu hören.

19,Ottimo hotel nel centro storico,"Ho alloggiato con la mia famiglia al claris per la mia vacanza di capodanno, parto con il dire che l’hotel si trova in una posizione fantastica vicino a molte delle bellezze storiche di barcellona e alla via della moda.
L’hotel ha uno stile molto orientale che viene ripreso anche nella camera molto minimal e curata, io sono stato nella junior suitè numero 519, composta da un salottino con un divano letto (dove la prima sera è stato quasi impossibile dormirci, poi grazie ad un asse lo si è reso più stabile) un bellissimo bagno molto ampio con anche la vasca idromassaggio dove però per un italiano e anche per un cinque stelle è stato intollerabile la mancanza di un bidet, e poi una stanza da letto con una ampia finestra, letto comodo con scelta dei cuscini.
Un punto veramente fortissimo di questo hotel oltre alla posizione è la gentilezza e cordialità del personale davvero tutti, dalla simpatia dei portieri, a mario in terrazza, al personale in reception e al capo sala nel ristorante.
Ho provato un giorno la colazione a buffet e devo dire che mi è piaciuta non c’è un ampissima scelta di cose però tutto è risultato buono e di qualità anche se è eccessivo il prezzo di 23€ cadauno.
L’hotel poi è pulitissimo come abbiamo trovato sempre la camera al nostro ritorno ordinata e pulita, non ho usufruito della palestra o della spa mentre sono stato più volte in terrazza a cui ho già dedicato una recensione ad hoc, comunque molto bello e suggestivo stare all’ultimo piano in un ambiente così elegante.
Un ultima cosa mi aspettavo un po’ più di spirito natalizio anche negli addobbi però capisco che sia un hotel che spinga anche su una clientela a cui interessa meno, in ogni caso gran hotel molto bello e curato dove la cordialità è di casa.
Prezzo chiaramente da 5 stelle ma ottimo il rapporto con la qualità, ho trovato poche cose che non mi sono piaciute, hotel sicuramente molto consigliato.",5,2022,01,05

19,5 estrellas??,"Hotel 5 estrellas?? He estado en muchos hoteles de 5 estrellas. Esté no llega ni a la suela de los zapatos a esta categoría. Teníamos una suíte duplex. Habitación súper pequeña, teníamos que pedirnos permiso yo y mi mujer para poder pasar. Cama pequeña. Mido 1,80m. Me salían los pies por debajo y estrecha. Habitación ruidosa  sin insonorización. Se oía todo el trafico de la calle y el ruido de la habitación de arriba que parecia que estuvieran en mi misma habitación. O sea que no descansamos nada. Un total desastre. La zona duplex un sofa cama, un mueble para poner la TV. Decoración horrenda. Encima de la cama un cuadro de una señora medieval que daba miedo mezclado delante de la cama con decoración japonesa!! Totalmente gore!!. Desayuno muy pobre. Pedimos pan tostado ya que no disponían del pan en el buffet y un poco de bacon. Nos traen 4 tostadas de pan bimbo (ni preguntar que tipo de pan queriamos) y 4 lonchas de bacon totalmente pasadas. Buffet super pobre!! Repostería mínima solo mini croissant y mini napolitanas. El café iban con jarras de café aguado. Al pedir un café de máquina el camarero me miro con mala leche. No pienso volver ni recomendarlo.
Lo mejor el botones. Muy amable y correcto 
El resto de personal ni fu ni fa. 
Por cierto se puede ahorrar las excusas y disculpas no van a solucionar para nada la mala estancia que tuvimos en su hotel, eso ya no lo solucionan Direct@r o Relaciones Públicas.

En la piscina tienen cerveza barata y si te preparan una bebida están fatal.

19,LAMENTABLE Y DECEPCIONANTE,"Reserve un fin de semana en el mes de julio como regalo de cumpleaños a mi pareja, incluía un desayuno en la habitación y un late check out. También reservamos cena en el restaurante. De entrada ya nos pusieron problemas por el late check out, alegando problemas de disponibilidad cuando en el paquete lo indicaba claramente. Solicitamos un upgrade y desayunar en la terraza, nos dijeron que ok con un cargo de 45€ y nos dieron hora a la 9.00h, para más tarde cambiarla a las 11.45€ (Desayuno a las 11.45????), por supuesto lo anulamos. La cena de calidad en un entorno agradable, aunque no pasaré por alto lo ""sobrado"" que iba el camarero que nos atendió cuestionándonos si champagne que habíamos pedido estaba a una temperatura adecuada según su criterio. Llega la noche y después de disfrutar en la terraza de unas copas, vamos a la habitación. Hacia las 2.30 a.m. se empiezan a oír gritos y golpes en la habitación de encima de nosotros, duran unos 20 minutos y cesan. A la mañana siguiente disfrutamos de la piscina y cuando nos vamos a duchar para ir a comer ( nos permitían finalmente abandonar la habitación más tarde) la habitación se convierte en una cascada de agua que empieza a filtrar por el techo del baño, el agua caía a chorros mientras estábamos en el baño, con el secador enchufado, descalzos, etc...la instalación eléctrica no salta, se inunda la habitación...avisamos a recepción y a los 10 minutos se presenta una persona de mantenimiento que lo ve y se va sin mas ( Tenemos un video que haremos público). Abandonamos la habitación y bajamos recepción. Nos atiende la Srta. Roberta y nos pide mil disculpas, no solo por este incidente sino por los otros inconvenientes y problemas que habíamos tenido durante la estancia y dado que la habitación ya estaba pagada (tampoco le reclamamos nada) nos dice que como compensación no abonemos la cuenta del restaurante y del bar que ascendía a mas de 240,00€, y que por supuesto reportará a dirección todo lo sucedido para que de una u otra manera se nos compense. Hay que notar que le pedimos el libro de reclamaciones y nos dió largas desviando el tema con la compensación recibida y a recibir. Días después recibimos unos correros del Sr. Dmitry Prosyanik y del Sr. Alessio Rinella, en el que lamentan la cadena de incidentes y nos invitan a pasar un fin de semana en el hotel, pero, y aquí viene lo mas lamentable y creo que hasta indecente....NOS CONDICIONAN LA COMPENSACIÓN A QUE ABONEMOS PRIMERO LA FACTURA DE LOS EXTRAS DE BAR Y RESTAURANTE (eso si nos aplican un descuento!!!) que ellos mismos nos dijeron que no teníamos que abonar. Reproduzco parte de los correos: ""Como he comentado por teléfono, nos gustaría invitarle nuevamente a nuestro hotel. Le adjunto el bono para una nueva estancia. Por favor contácteme directamente para hacer su reserva, de este modo nos aseguraremos que tenga una buena habitación. Por otro lado, tenemos una factura a su nombre con los cargos del restaurante pendiente. Le hemos aplicado un descuento por las inconveniencias. Si por favor puede confirmar que podemos cargar la tarjeta que dejaron a la llegada."" Nuestra respuesta ha sido la siguiente: ""Una vez más, no salimos de nuestro asombro al recibir su respuesta. Tenemos la sensación de que esta desafortunada situación se ha convertido en una negociación, pese a que nosotros hemos actuado en todo momento de forma respetuosa y comunicativa. Por supuesto que no vamos a abonar el importe de los gastos extras (aún no entendemos por qué se nos reclaman…) y no “disfrutaremos” de su bono de una noche, como consecuencia de su afán de negociación.” Es lamentable que después de todo lo sucedido un 5* GL, quiera negociar una compensación. Solicitaremos formalmente el Libro de Reclamaciones que no nos quisieron facilitar y elevaremos esta queja a la ACC...Un 5* GL no son solo unas instalaciones de lujo, también han de saber empatizar con los clientes y estar a la altura de las circunstancias.",1,2021,08,08

El servicio de desayuno no corresponde a lo que uno espera de un hotel de estas características, servido en la planta -1 en un salón anodino y con una oferta escasa. No lo recomiendo",3,2021,03,07
19,Total decepción. No a la altura de un 5*GL,"Hoy es 12/2/2020 y reservamos hace unos días la suite del Claris para pasar la noche del 13/02/2020 al 14/02/2020.

Ayer día 11/02/2020 llamé al hotel pese a la reserva por Booking. Siempre lo hago en persona y como deferencia para confirmar nuestra llegada al hotel.

Cuando pregunto por la cena en su restaurante Michelin, me contestan que están llenos, que no podemos cenar en el restaurante su Menú Degustación.

Sorprendido les propongo que sirvan la cena en la suite y me vuelven a sorprender diciendo que es viable, pero no el menú degustación si no un room service convencional porque ""están cortos de personal"".

Me ofrecen cenar en el bar del hotel, junto al restaurante, en su terraza, en una da las dos mesas que tienen a resguardo porque, además el fin de semana amenaza con llover. Lo acepto a regañadientes y solicito que nos guarden esa mesa para poder cenar.

En este punto las cosas toman un cariz que no me gusta nada, cuando me dicen que tenemos que ir a cenar a las 19h porque ellos no reservan las mesas de la terraza y nos podemos quedar sin mesa.

Le recuerdo a la assistant que me atiende que somos sus clientes de la suite y que, evidentemente, mi interés es llegar al hotel y cenar allí pero que en ningún modo pienso pelearme por una mesa. No ofrece ninguna solución.

Vuelvo a llamar hasta tres veces hoy 18:00h por teléfono, para una vez más tratar de encontrar una solución satisfactoria para todos y no responden al teléfono.

Acabo de cancelar la reserva. Y para postre, según la aplicación, el hotel nos cobrará la reserva igualmente. No me jugaría yo la cena que no van a darnos a que la van a cobrar...

Total, que nos vamos a la Suite Premium del Hotel Alma (5*GL), dónde si entienden las necesidades de un cliente. No solo nos reservan una mesa en su restaurante si no que se sorprenden como yo de que no sea así, y nos obsequian con un cocktail de bienvenida, un buen desayuno y acceso a su spa.

Yo recuerdo el Claris como un gran hotel y si, malos días los tenemos todos. Cuando tu establecimiento es distinguido, lo es por la suma de todos y cada uno de los servicios que ofrece y, en nuestro caso, no podemos reconocer el trato recibido como distinguido y a la altura de nuestro recuerdo.

19,Espectacular :) Un acierto ,"Debido a la actual situación por COVID-19 🦠hemos postergado varios viajes en los últimos 12 meses y han quedado varios aniversarios por celebrar, por este motivo y con ganas de darnos un “respiro” de tantas malas noticias y decidimos contratar una noche en un buen hotel en la ciudad, para no saltarnos el perimetral municipal.

Hace tiempo que hablábamos de ir al Hotel Claris pero por una cosa u otra siempre cambiábamos de plan... quizás por tenerlo tan cerca y pensar que en cualquier momento podríamos en cualquier otro momento.

La experiencia ha sido de 10! 🔝

Desde el primer instante en el que cruzas la puerta y el corteje te saluda y pasas a recepción percibes la cordialidad y buen hacer. 

🔝Tratándose de un aniversario nos aplicaron una mejora en la habitación y nos dieron una Suite Junior -Detallazo! 🥇

🟢Cositas que nos han encantado:

- Cafetera Nesspresso con cápsulas de cortesía, crema de leche.
- Minibar  con refresco de cortesía del Hotel.🧃🥤🍻
-Menaje (copas de cava y vasos de cristal para tomar🥂 una copa en la habitación)
-Toallas  y albornoces de alta calidad (Marca Bassols)
-Ropa de cama súper suave y cojines / Colchon ultra cómodos.
-Presión del agua perfecta para poder utilizar el jacuzzi y la ducha al mismo tiempo.🛁
-Decoración impecable y con los detalles de tener mobiliario Victoriano  y alfombras turcas, además de todas las obras de arte que contiene el hotel.
-Desayuno delicioso, muy bien atendidos,por protocolo Covid todo te lo traen a la mesa. 🥐☕️🧃
- Entradas al Museo Egipcio ⚱️
-Calidad de los productos excelente y amplia variedad (frutas, tostadas, cereales, zumos, platos calientes, pancakes, huevos...)🍳🍞🥓🥞

Creo que se nota que nos ha encantado!!!!!

🔴 Como punto a mejorar:

Siempre en las opiniones que pongo en TriAdvisor intento poner todo lo bueno y algo que quizás no me ha gustado tanto, aunque en este caso es por poner un pero.

✔️Temperatura:🔥

Pasamos algo de calor pero es cierto que no llamamos a recepción para pedir que alguien nos explicara como cambiar la climatización....

✔️Barra/Asa en el Jacuzzi:🛀

La entrada y la salida del jacuzzi se hace algo complicada, una barra o asas, haría más cómoda la experiencia.

Es un hotel situado en un edificio muy icónico y bonito del centro de Barcelona, donde se nota que llevan muchos años de experiencia en el sector.

Este hotel merece las 5 estrellas, para mí, porque:

✓ El trato del personal, ya sea de recepción o de cualquier otra índole, es exquisito. Están todos y todas atentos a cada detalle que necesites y dispuestos a ayudar.

✓ El gusto y la decoración de cada habitación es impresionante. De aquellas en las que he estado, las dúplex son mis favoritas.

19,"Trato EXCEPCIONAL, te sientes como en casa pero a todo lujo.","La sensación de comodidad y de encontrarte como en casa. El trato del personal es cercano, sensible a tus necesidades, con una amabilidad exquisita. El encontrarte rodeado de obras de arte, te obliga instintivamente a mantener un ambiente de respeto y cuidado hacia todo lo que te rodea, lo cual redunda en tu propia comodidad. La ubicación es excelente, cercano a todo. La terraza de la planta 7, es pequeña pero muy acogedora. No utilizé el restaurante pero si que comí las tapas (en el bar y en la habitación), de una calidad extraordinaria (croquetas de cecina con Idiazabal, de jamón, etc. ). el desayuno completo, sin estridencias innecesarias(como pasteles de mil tipos) y el servicio muy profesional, aunque tengo que decir que los huevos con bacon son mejores en el Hotel Urban de Madrid ( de la misma cadena). Visita gratis en el Museo Egipcio de Barcelona (muy recomendable), para los clientes del hotel. Exposición de arte precolombino en la primera planta, que recomiendo visitar. Vamos, que al final de todo, le vienen a uno ganas de marcharse de expedición arqueológica a Egipto, eso si, llevándose al cocinero, al barman y a todo el personal del Hotel Clarís.",5,2020,12,10
19,Excelente hotel en pleno centro,"Hotel de excelente calidad tanto en las instalaciones como en el servicio.

19,EQUPAZO TIENE ESTE HOTEL ! EL PERSONAL TE HACE SENTIR COMO EN CASA!!! ,"No tengo palabras de agradecimiento para el personal que he tenido el placer de conocer en este coqueto y con estilazo hotel ! Primero dar las gracias a Katty por atenderme en la reserva por teléfono y el gran recibimiento a mi llegada!!! Un placer y si hay otra ofertita que se adapte a mi
Bolsillo no dudaré en volver !! También muchas gracias a Roberta mi cuidadora por la tarde ! Soy un desastre y no supe hacer ir la Nespresso y me cargue las 2 cápsulas de regalo y me hizo subir un café con leche tipo capuchino, 2 cápsulas más y el chico que me las subió ( no sé su nombre para agradecérselo ) pero muy majo y me enseñó bien cómo funcionaba !! Tenía reserva del desayuno VIP en la terraza a las 10:00 a las 9:00 me fui a dar un paseo por Paseo de Gracia y Antes de irme me asomé para ver como era el buffet para una próxima ocasión , y no solo me dejaron entrar y verlo , sino que Jimmy el maitre me invitó a sentarme y me ofreció un café , tal café fue acompañado de 2.croisantitos y un Zumo de naranja ! Un detallazo !!! Y el desayuno no tiene palabras ...EXCELENTE CÁLIDAD PRECIO !!! Allí tanto Jose el camarero como
Martin el Cheff , no solo estuvieron de 10 en todo sino al ver que me encanta el buen comer se esmeraron al máximo en hacerme disfrutar y doy fe que lo consiguieron !!! Sin duda Renei la directora ( la cual tuve el placer de conocerla hará un par de años cuando fuimos con 3 amigas a tomar algo en la terraza ) tiene un equipazp ! Lastima que esta vez no he coincidido con Remei , me hubiera encantado saludarla otra vez , ella con tanta gente educación y buen hacer !!!  No me extraña que tenga este equipazo humano !!! Solo tengo 3 palabras para todos GRACIAS, GRACIAS, GRACIAS!! ",5,2020,11,22
19,Fantástica relación calidad-precio,"Nos decidimos por este hotel para hacer una pequeña escapada y disfrutar de un “confinamiento” diferente. 

Reservamos una suite duplex a un precio muy por debajo de mercado y por ello reconocemos que íbamos un poco reticentes.

Sin embargo, desde el minuto 1 nos trataron espectacular. Tuvieron el detalle de subirnos una botella de cava cuando no estábamos, y el servicio ha sido excelente.

Si sois de los que queréis contribuir a mantener viva la economía en esta situación, os recomiendo este lugar.",5,2020,11,15
19,Reconfortante y Agradable,"Excelente trato, Flexibilidad y disponibilidad, dadas las circuntancias.Se agradece el hecho de tener la opción de utilizar el servicio de bar y restaurante en la terraza del hotel, dadas las circunstyancias excepcionales que se están viviendo y también es de agradecer la flexibilidad ofrecida en la hora de salida.",5,2020,11,02
19,Quasi perfetto,"Ottimo soggiorno al Claris: posizione ideale, praticamente in centro, personale giovane e gentile. Colazione ottima, e anche il ristorante, dove ho mangiato gustoso formaggio alla brace, carne e arrosto squisiti, un pò caro. Palestra piccolina, ma gratis, e spa graziosa, ma a pagamento. Competenti le massaggiatrici. Suggestiva la terrazza al 7 piano. Le camere sono belle e pulite, forse da ammodernare i bagni. Prezzo non economico, essendo un 5 stelle, però giustificato, nel complesso. Suggerito. ",4,2020,10,17
19,Una experiencia inolvidable ,"Durante mi estancia en Barcelona tuve el placer de hospedarme en el Hotel Claris, en una de sus hermosas suites. La habitación contaba con una decoración exclusiva y todo lo necesario para descansar y disfrutar de la estancia en Barcelona. Hemos recibido un trato impecable, especialmente de Roberta, quién nos atendió de manera excelente y muy atenta. La estancia ha sido maravillosa y segura, respetando las actuales restricciones sanitarias. Todo ha sido impecable, hasta el último detalle. ",5,2020,10,14
19,La insignia de Derby Colección,"Llevo años eligiendo siempre al Hotel derby para alojarme en Barcelona. Derby es el más antiguo de una colección (No una vulgar ‘cadena’) que destaca por el buen gusto, un gusto refinado, por la calidad y confort culturalmente superior de sus instalaciones, con asombrosas obras originales de arte en las principales instalaciones y en las habitaciones de los hoteles.

Aparte del derby, he tenido la suerte de alojarme también en el gran derby, una maravilla. Pero en mis tres últimas visitas a Barcelona mi Derby me ha hecho un upgrade hacia su buque insignia: El Claris. 

Todavía no sé cómo agradecerle que me haya remitido a este Hotel. Impresionante el compromiso, el buen trato y la eficiencia de su personal. Las instalaciones asimismo llenas de obras de arte antiguas y modernas, las habitaciones diseñadas y decoradas con tanto buen gusto y calidad y confort que las hacen verdaderamente singulares.

he disfrutado en el Claris de una exposición permanente de arte maya original, de esculturas romanas, aztecas, chinas (un magnífico Buda de madera observa al huésped nada menos que en el porche del salón de desayunos!). Todo lo que he visto y todo lo que he disfrutado es de orden superior. La terraza es estupenda, el bar muy bien llevado, la comida espectacular, el desayuno buffet a la altura de un cinco estrellas. 

En fin, el hotel Claris hace honor a la gran familia Derby. Cualquier huésped, por exigente que sea, puede elegir el Claris con los ojos cerrados y saldrá sonriendo.",5,2020,10,05
19,Magnifico,"Diogo fue muy cordial y las habitaciones fantásticas.muy recomendable.
El hotel es muy bonito y la habitación que me tocó más de lo mismo, tampoco puedo decir mucho más porque estuve una noche :) .....",5,2020,10,04
19,Excelente,"Hemos estado este fin de semana mi pareja y yo y la verdad es que todo ha sido perfecto. Lástima del frío que hacía ayer por la noche que no nos permitió disfrutar de la gran terraza que tienen. Habitación bonita, desayuno buenísimo y abundante y mucha limpieza en general. Lo recomendamos. ",5,2020,09,27
19,Sin ningún pero !!!,"Hotel céntrico , de solera y tradición en la capital Catalana. Estupendo servicio , comodidad y lujo en sus habitaciones . Restauración de nivel . Como titulo el comentario , sin ningún pero !!! Volveremos con seguridad !!!",5,2020,09,24
19,BUEN HOTEL Y UBICACIÓN MAGNIFICA,"Muy buen hotel y situado en el corazón de Barcelona. Me hospedé 2 noches y la verdad es casi como si estuvieras en casa. Gran hotel, lo cuidan todo al mínimo detalle, magnifica atención por parte del personal, habitaciones amplias, bien decoradas y la limpieza extrema de 10 muy de agradecer en los momentos que estamos viviendo, magnifica y bonita terraza/solárium/restaurante,  las 5 ***** se las tiene ganadas.
Como me considero persona sensata y habiendo dado la máxima puntuación,  también me gusta hacer constar que en la vida todo es mejorable, solamente comentaré 2 puntos en negativo. El primero que siendo un huésped del hotel no pudiera comer en el restaurante ""La Terraza del Claris"" porque según me dijo el camarero lo tenia completo por gente que no estaba hospedada en el mismo, me pareció una falta de atención de cara al huésped y el 2º punto debo de indicar que la conexión de wifi no va ni con pedales. De todas formas recomendable al 100x100 y con previsión de volver en mis viajes a Barcelona",5,2020,09,21
19,Errores técnicos,"Pasamos dos noches en este hotel y nada más llegar pudimos comprobar que la conexión a internet era casi inexistente con una velocidad de 0,07 megas por segundo. Que hoy en día en un hotel de 5 estrellas tengamos que sufrir esta falta de ancho de banda deja mucho que desear. Por supuesto fue totalmente imposible poder ver una serie de NETFLIX. Al día siguiente llamé a recepción para ver si lo podían solucionar, me llamó un técnico que me dijo que lo solucionaba remotamente, pero cuando regresé al hotel al cabo de unas horas seguía sin tener servicio y el técnico no se puso en contacto conmigo y ya no volví a insistir.
En la habitación hay un teléfono móvil que pertenece al hotel con un sistema que se llama MANET. Se supone que dicho sistema sirve como conserje virtual para realizar numerosas funciones. Lo primero que hice fue acceder a la guía telefónica para solicitar un room service, lo cual fue totalmente imposible ya que llamaba a un número de Italia y nadie contestó jamás. Además, los textos que aparecen en dicho terminal, como la descripción del hotel, son casi ilegibles por el pequeño tamaño del texto. Me dio la sensación que el sistema no estaba acabado de implantar.
El personal de recepción es correcto. La habitación está limpia, aunque hay varios aspectos a mejorar como por ejemplo que no tiene un escritorio donde uno se pueda sentar a trabajar con el portátil cómodamente. Tampoco me convence que para ver la TV tengas que sentarte en un pequeño sofá, y si te apetece verla desde la cama tengas que estar girando la cabeza ya que queda totalmente desplazada hacia la derecha. Solicitamos que nos sirvieran la cena en la habitación y tuvimos que poner los platos encima de las piernas, ya que no existe ni tan siquiera una pequeña mesita para poder colocar los platos mientras cenas.
El desayuno es excelente y la atención del encargado fue exquisita.
La ubicación es muy buena en el centro de la ciudad.
Dicen que la primera impresión es muy importante, sin embargo en este caso siento tener que decir que NO  ha sido lo que esperábamos de un hotel de esta categoría.",3,2020,09,18
19,"Insuperable / Aniversario en Hotel con "" CHARME""","Insuperable, para una estancia 10 en el centro de Barcelona.

19,Simplemente excelente,"Estuvimos un fin de semana en este hotel y todo fue perfecto. La ubicación es perfecta para moverse por la ciudad. El personal, aunque se da por hecho que en un hotel de esta categoria es correcto, fue muy amable en todo momento. Es mas, era mi cumpleaños y cuando lo supieron (por casualidad) me llevaron una tarta y cava en el desayuno y nos llenaron de atenciones. 
El hotel tiene un encanto especial porque es como un pequeño museo. Las habitaciones tienen obras de arte importadas y le dan un aire distinto a otros hoteles mas clasicos de esta categoria.

19,Soggiorno a Barcellona,"Siamo stati in questo hotel per un weekend lungo e non possiamo che essere pienamente soddisfatti.
La struttura alloggiata in  un palazzo d'epoca è affascinante e confortevole ed oltretutto in un'ottima posizione dalla quale sono raggiungibili a piedi le maggiori attrazioni turistiche della città.
Da sottolineare la gentilezza e professionalità di tutto lo staff .

19,Complimenti,E’ stata una bella vacanza a Barcellona; ho potuto apprezzare la comodità dell’albergo sia per l’accoglienza che per la posizione che mi ha consentito di poter visitare la città con spostamenti comodi sia a piedi che con i mezzi pubblici.,5,2019,04,21
19,"SILENCIO, CONFORT, ARTE Y DIVERSIDAD EN EL CLARIS","Amable bienvenida con cava y primavera en La Terraza. 
Espacios comunes bellamente decorados con arte de diferentes orígenes.
Sorprende y agrada la diversidad cultural de su eficiente personal.
En nuestra habitación encontramos arte en muebles, esculturas, cerámicas, lámparas. Tras unos instantes sin palabras, llama nuestra atención el silencio. Nos espera el confort de su cama, una gran bañera abajo, la relajante sauna arriba, frutas acompañadas por un excelente brut y buena conversación en el cómodo chester.

Señora Gómez, Remei, muy agradecidos por su buen hacer, atención y amabilidad. Le rogamos que haga llegar mil gracias a su personal.",5,2019,04,16
19,"Confor, calidad, museo y millones de extras","El hotel es mucho más que 5 estrellas, es un museo en sí lleno de obras de arte por todos lados, muy limpio cómodo y confortable, habitación grande llena de extras como botella grande de agua, cafetera con cápsulas y leche gratis, chocolate y zapatillas de cortesía muy cómodas, céntrico a 5 min de parada metro de paseo Gràcia y 15 andando a plaza Cataluña y comienzo de las ramblas, el personal muy amable, rápido y servicial",5,2019,04,12
19,"Sieht schön aus, aber...","Wir haben im April 4 Nächte in diesem Hotel verbracht und können es leider nicht weiterempfehlen.

Gut ist die Lage. Vieles ist zu Fuss erreichbar. Auch sehr schön ist die Hotelterrasse mit Pool.

Wir hatten eine Duplex-Suite mit Blick zur Strasse hin. Der erste Eindruck war WOW. Sieht sehr schön aus! Leider sind die Betten steinhart, weshalb wir wenig erholt mit Rückenschmerzen nach Hause gingen. Der Lärm von der Strasse ist sehr laut. Normalerweise kein Problem bei einem Städtetrip. Aber in Kombination mit diesen harten Betten leider nicht begünstigend für den Schlaf.

Beim CheckIn hiess es, dass Wasser inkludiert ist. Das war eine Literflasche pro Tag. Als wir an der Reception nachgefragt haben, ob wir zwei Flaschen erhalten dürften meinte der Herr nur sehr arrogant, dass die zweite Flasche verrechnet würde. Die Art der Antwort und auch die Verrechnung sind für mich nicht 5* würdig. Sehr schade. So haben wir das Wasser beim kleinen Supermarkt um die Ecke eingekauft.",3,2019,04,12
19,Ein wunderbares Wochenend,"Wir haben ein wunderbares Wochenende in Barcelona im Hotel Club verbracht .Das Zimmer war toll, absolut sauber mit allem, was man braucht und einem bequemen Bett . Alle Mitarbeiter waren ausgesprochen zuvorkommend und freundlich . Das Frühstücksbuffet ist anders, als der Hamburger es gewohnt ist, ließ aber keine Wünsche offen. Rundum war es ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt. Vielen Dank",5,2019,03,25
19,"Di prestigio, ottima posizione","Ottima struttura, personale gentile e disponibile. La posizione è ottima, Barcellona poi è una città a misura d’uomo ed è piacevole passeggiare per raggiungere ogni punto di interesse (ottima la vicinanza alla Sagrada Família). Mi sono sentito come in famiglia insieme ai miei cani, bene accolti dal personale. Ci tornerò sicuramente.",5,2019,03,19
19,Tariffe sbagliate,"Una delusione totale, abbiamo prenotato questo albergo per il mese di Aprile ad un costo di 429€ per 4 notti sembrava interessante come offerta così ci siamo presi anche i biglietti subito ma è stata una delusione perché mi è arrivata dopo giorni della conferma di prenotazione la mail del hotel che la tariffa non e la stessa ma e cambiata è mi chiedevano di cancellare la prenotazione oppure accettare di mantenerla ad un costo di 679€!! Io chiaramente l’ho dovuta cancellare ma per una questione di principio perché un hotel a *****stelle se da un servizio del genere dimostra poca professionalità è serietà.
Senz’altro un posto da evitare..",1,2019,03,18
19,Rundum zufrieden,Tolle Lage. Sehr schönes Stadthotel. Frühstück meines Erachtens zu teuer ... jedoch in Barcelona kein Problem. Man kann problemlos in den vielen Cafes frühstücken. Das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich. Unser Zimmer klasse... Jederzeit wieder!!! ,5,2019,03,15
19,Tariffe Sbagliate!!!,"Dopo aver prenotato per un soggiorno di 4 notti e stabilito un determinato prezzo, mi hanno inviato un'email dove dicevano che il prezzo era sbagliato e bisognava aumentare di 160 euro a notte!!! Non ci hanno dato nemmeno il tempo di valutare l'opzione che ci avevano offerto e che ci hanno costretto a cancellare la prenotazione per liberare la stanza!!! Nonostante il problema fosse stato il loro, nello stabilire il prezzo iniziale, ci siamo ritrovati senza albergo!!! La serietà e il rispetto per il cliente manca! Non lo consiglio assolutamente!",1,2019,03,08
19,Ottimo albergo. Personale gentile e preparato.,"Abbiamo soggiornato qui io e mia moglie con il mio bimbo di 1 anno e mezzo. Molto disponibile tutto il personale. Ottimo il ristorante la terrazza de Claris, sicuramente da provare. Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione a mio parere un po’ cara. Basta uscire e fare 2 passi e si trovano ottimi bar per fare colazione con pochi euro.",5,2019,02,20

19,Da sogno!,"Meraviglioso e di gran livello nel centro di Barcellona! Stile antico e contemporaneo di gran pregio. Gli ambienti sembrano ristrutturati da pochi giorni tanto sono freschi, attuali, profumati, di buon gusto e puliti. Sicuramente il top sia dell’eleganza e dell'arredo che nella professionalità del personale. Ottima colazione ricca e abbondante con prodotti di qualità. Graziosa terrazza con piscina! ",5,2019,01,25

Alternativ kann aber auch gut draußen um die Ecke frühstücken, da gibt es viele Cafés um die Ecke ... Auf jeden Fall kann ich das Hotel nur empfehlen.",5,2019,01,13
19,Bellissimo ma rumoroso...,"Hotel bellissimo e curatissimo negli arredi e nella pulizia. Personale gentilissimo e accogliente. Ristoranti di grande livello. Bellissima e competente anche la SPA dove si beneficia di un buono di 25€ di sconto se clienti hotel. Insomma un ottimo hotel con una grande pecca che, francamente, mi ha lasciata molto perplessa essendo, tutto sommato, la qualità del sonno il primo vero requisito di ogni buon hotel. La stanza, la mia per lo meno, era veramente rumorosa. E non per il traffico...che si percepiva, ma appena, grazie alle ottime finestre, ma per i vicini e i rumori interni all'hotel. Non si poteva nemmeno fare una pennica senza tappi: acqua che scorre nei bagni limitrofi al piano e sopra, porte sbattute, cellulari e sveglie dei vicini che suonano, personale delle pulizie che traffica e parla in corridoio (non è colpa loro...sia chiaro....fanno il loro lavoro e lo fanno anche bene....sono le camere che non sono insonorizzate)....non c'è un momento di vero silenzio. Assurdo che un notel 5 stelle grand luxe non abbia lavorato su questo punto fondamentale. E' davvero un peccato....perché l'hotel è bellissimo, ma se non si dorme bene senza tappi, per quello che costa...c'è un problema serio. ",3,2019,01,02

19,Genial,"Lo mejor de mi estancia ha sido este hotel, interesante al máximo, recorrer por sus instalaciones es muy placentero, la pileta y todo lo que ofrece como el museo.
Lo que más me sorprendió fue el profesionalismo de sus empleados, todos actúan como si fueran sus dueños, las habitaciones carecen de ciertos detalles pero que no son importantes en relación al trato que se recibe. Felicitaciones y muchas gracias por todo.",5,2018,10,29
19,Un Hotel con GRAN CLASE Y CONFORT," Quizá un Hotel de cinco estrellas se puede encontrar fácilmente en cualquier ciudad. Muy difícil todavía encontrar un museo en un Hotel de cinco estrellas. Por ello este Hotel de gran categoría profesional y humana se caracteriza por un museo vivo y lleno de grandes profesionales de todas la rama hotelera. Empezando por la directora que se ocupa de todos los detalles de los clientes en recepción el señor Jesús y en desayunos el señor Alvin, hacen que la estancia se convierta en un sueño donde todas las fantasías y deseos se vean cumplidos.

19,bañera,"La bañera es incómoda e incluso peligrosa al salir. Sugiero  que le pongan un antideslizante y unas barandillas para poder agarrarse al salir.  también estuvimos cuatro días y uno de ellos no repusieron el café y el agua.  Aún así, estamos encantados con el Hotel y el servicio. Es un detalle que haya cafetera en la habitación.  El personal es muy amable ",5,2018,10,16
19,livello del servizio baso,"Lhotel è bello e ben posizionato con una bella terrazza all'ultimo piano. Il livello del servizio scarso per il prezzo che si paga.Avevo ordinato la sveglia e se ne sono dimenticati, per scusarsi hanno mandato lo champagne senza bicchieri.le chiavi della porta non funzionavano, quindi ono dovuta tornare giu alla reception.Inomma la parte dell'attenzione al cliente è scarsa",2,2018,10,14

19,Odore di fogna,"un albergo a cinque stelle che non offre una colazione ai suoi ospiti avendo pagato profumatamente una junior suite, un odore di fogna che pervade il piano 6 con profumatore per nascondere la problematica, il bagno senza spazzolino e il wc che torna tutto su, non il massimo, il ricevimento collaborativo ma purtroppo ostacolato dalla policy della struttura che dire cè di meglio. consiglio: expedia controlla bene prima di vendere ciò che vedi da una foto. Peccato.",1,2018,10,02
19,"Bello, romantico e curato","Abbiamo appena trascorso Quattro giorni in questo albergo. 
Piscina piccola ma curata che, dopo 20 km a  piedi in giro per la città, abbiamo molto apprezzato, così come la vasca con  idromassaggio che avevamo in camera e come il meraviglioso massaggio in coppia fatto nella Spa ( un po’ cara ma ne è valsa la pena! ). 
Personale molto disponibile e cortese.
La terrazza con il bar e la piscina è veramente un luogo molto piacevole dove riprendersi dalle fatiche della giornata.
Avevamo un junior suite, bagno notevole.

19,Estancia correcta,"El hotel es muy bonito, decorado con elegancia, situacion excelente. El personal es muiy agradable, tanto en recepcion como en el bar de la azotea pasando por el servicio de habitaciones y limpieza. Tuvimos un pequeno problema con el ruido una noche y se encargaron de arreglarlo y fuimos compensados muy amablemente. Hotel cinco estrellas con una inmejorable relacion calidad/precio.
La habitacion es amplia y comoda, el bano tambien, quiza lo que mas eche de menos fue no tener ducha, si no que la banera hacia las mismas funciones.
Por lo demas; realmente increible.",5,2018,06,25
19,gutes Hotel mit guter Lage ,Wir waren für 5 Tage in diesem Hotel und haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt die Zimmer sind sehr schön und das Hotel eignet sich sehr um Barcelona zu erkunden. Manche Angestellte sind etwas arrogant.Das Frühstücksbüffet ist übersichtlich Eierspeisen werden frisch zubereitet. Die Hotelbar auf der Dachterrasse mit kleinem Pool bietet einen schönen Blick und die Cocktails sind auch lecker 15 Euro. Falls man nicht gut Englisch spricht hat man ein kleines Problem da die Rezeption nur Englisch sprechen gerade wenn man anreist fanden wir es sehr schade das es keine Informationen bzw Infoblätter auf Deutsch gab. ,3,2018,06,25

- Habitación preciosa y cama muy cómoda. 

El gran pero es que estuvimos en la segunda planta con la ventana orientada a la calle, las VENTANAS NO estan INSONORIZADAS!! Se oye todo el ruido de la calle, incluso la conversación de dos persones... En nuestro caso vivimos en el campo y tenemos la suerte d no escuchar nada de ruido, al estar acostumbrados así no hemos podido dormir bien!!

Ademas de esto Derby cuida cada detalle para que estes lo mas a gusto posible. La piscina en el rooftop y el spa hace que tu viaje de trabajo o tu escapada de finde en Barcelona sean mucho mas agradable.
El personal es super amable y atento para que desde que entres no tengas que preocuparte por nada.

Sin duda repetiré en mi próxima visita.",5,2018,05,18
19,Diseño precioso y localización inmejorable.,Me ha encantado. Tienen muchos detalles y su personal estupendo. Se gana las estrellas que tiene. Además tiene una sala destinada a museo. Actualmente tiene una colección de Arte mejicano pre colombino,5,2018,05,06
19,No volveré,"Explico, el hotel está muy bien ubicado, el personal de maravilla, la habitacion genial, el único pero como el que me fuí es que lo cogi por el gimnasio y era horrible, la calefacción puesta en ua erraza de techo de uralita y haciendo deporte! Era muerte aquello!
Se hubiese quedado ahí la cosa, pero una vez abandonamos el hotel me llegó un mail como que habíamos consumido algo del minibar, y ni siquiera lo ví! No especificaba que era, solo 3,50, cosa que veo mal, la verdad.
Visto que no habíamos tomado nada, les escribi preguntando qué era lo que habían cbrado y me dijeron que no lo sabían, que al día siguiente me decían. Les dije que no había tomado nada y al día siguiente me dijeron que una coca-cola!
Les volví a escribir, diciendoles que no habiamos tomado nada, que porfavor mirasen si del anterior huesped no la habian rellenado o algo! No me dieron más explicación y me devolvieron mi dinero.  Veo que esto estuvo mal tramitado, pues no sé porqué nos dijeron que si y luego que no, si no era en nuestro numero de habitación, cosa que también les dije que comprobaran, o si era debido al anterior huesped... en fin! No me gustó nada el trato, viendo lo que vale y que en esa misma calle en cada esquina, tienes un hotel de caracteristicas similares volvería a otro si o si. Me parece que para un hotel de tanta clase, quedaron muy mal conmigo.",2,2018,05,02
19,Me gustó mucho,"Atención muy buena, todo perfecto. Es recomendable para todo el  que quiera ir. Cerca de tiendas y lugares de ocio. La Sagrada familia está a pocos minutos, hay mercados y se come bien por la zona.

Las rosas, el Champán Rosado, las Fresas con chocolate, el globo en forma de corazón, todo perfecto como lo había previsto y maravillosa la sorpresa., El desayuno también espectacular.

19,Falsa información,"Muy mala experiencia. La habitación nos la ofertaban como una suite de lujo y dejaba mucho que desear. El botón de las persianas mecánicas estaba escondido y no se podía dormir en toda la noche porque el sol entraba. Además, es falso que haya Spa, es publicidad engañosa, lo que hay es un departamento pequeñito con escasos servicios. Una gran decepción. No lo recomiendo para nada.",1,2018,04,02

19,«Noche en el museo»,"Alojarse en el Hotel Claris es como transportarse al pasado viviendo en el futuro. Estar rodeado de arte antiguo en un hotel que va a la delantera de muchos de los hoteles de la ciudad. 
Me recuerda a la famosa película de Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Hackman, etc. “Una noche en el museo”, donde las figuras del Museo neoyorquino cobran vida por la noche y hacen de un interesante museo un lugar lleno de vida. 
Pónganse a soñar, uno se acuesta en la cama de una habitación de un hotel y se levanta en la sala de un museo rodeado de piezas de arte.
Hotel con mucha personalidad. Trato exquisito y muy humano de todos los que “mantienen vivo” este hotel. Gran staff. Enhorabuena. 
Terraza y piscina en el piso de arriba con vistas a toda la ciudad. Un oasis en el centro de Barcelona. 
Pidan cualquier cosa que necesiten que no pondrán ningún pero en conseguirla. 
Atención al cliente en recepción sobresaliente. Bienvenida con copa de cava a la llegada y ofrecimiento de una mejor habitación que la que habíamos reservado sin pedirlo (sujeto supongo a la disponibilidad). 
Céntrico hotel. A 10 minutos caminando de la Plaza Catalunya. 
Lo único negativo, el no disponer de más días para saborearlo mejor.
Felicidades. Seguid así.

19,"Excelente ubicación, servicios recepcion","Mala insonorización interna, por ejemplo: . El ruido de la cisterna se oye más desde la habitación más que en el wc, creo que es porque el zoom que comunica todas las habitaciones en la vertical tiene salida al dormitorio y como es un falso techo ocasiona muchas molestias",5,2018,01,28
19,Acojedor,"Muy buen hotel. 
El tamaño de las habitaciones quizas un poco pequeñas, así como la cama de 150 y el armario reducido de ahí la puntuacion de 4.

El desayuno muy correcto y servicio impecable. Buenos embutidos y servicio de carta de calientes. 
Servicio de aparcacoches en parquing, de pago 25 euros la noche.

19,Bueno,"El hotel, muy céntrico tiene una atención de los empleados de 10.
Nos dieron un tipo de suite que daba a un patio interior, no muy bonito pero tampoco es culpa suya. 
La habitación contaba a parte de lo típico, con 2 televisores, una bañera de hidromasaje, cafetera, vino de cortesía, un movil con el ecosistema del hotel, incluso un altavoz bluetooth. 
Todos estos lujos pero el baño no tenia puerta. El lavabo estaba separado del resto de la habitación por una simple mampara de cristal opaco, así que de intimidad poca si hay alguien mas en la habitación. El lavabo tampoco tenia escobilla, un detalle en el que hay que fijarse antes de sentarse. 
A parte de eso la habitación tiene timbre, cosa que no sabia y a la que me di cuenta de que estaban picando a las 7 de la tarde en mi habitación y salí al comedor a ver que pasaba, el servicio de habitaciones me encontró desnudo, al menos me dieron unas chocolatinas a cambio.
Por las mañanas es  un poco ruidoso, desde mi habitación a las 9 de la mañana se oían los ruidos de las habitaciones cercanas.
PD: el televisor del comedor no funcionaba, no tenia señal y me di cuenta a las 2 de la mañana por lo que ya no se podía arreglar.
En definitiva un cumulo de experiencias que deslució mi estancia y por las que no volvería al hotel",3,2018,01,25

19,Espectaculares instalaciones y servicio,Espectaculares las instalaciones y el servicio. La habitación fantástica y al bajar la persiana la oscuridad se hacía total.

19,Excelente trato de todo el personal,"Organizamos una jornada de trabajo en el Hotel Clarís y la decisión no pudo ser más acertada. La sala donde realizamos la formación estaba en la terraza con unas vistas magnificas. La comida posterior fue entre esculturas y jarrones históricos. La calidad de la comida muy bien. Pero sobre todo, y en total eramos unas 20 personas, lo mejor fue el trato del equipo interno. Atentos en todo momento, flexibles, etc. Volveremos seguro.",5,2017,12,04

19,Me encanta este hotel!,"Súper céntrico, con una decoración especial y diferente a los hoteles tan minimalistas actuales. Las habitaciones decoradas diferentes con muy buen gusto y con elementos egipcios maravillosos. Las telas y maderas hacen las habitaciones especiales.
La terraza del hotel en verano para tomar algo o cenar, y la sala acristalada con vistas a Barcelona para un evento.
Muy recomendable!

19,Gute Adresse in Barcelona ,"Wir hatten unser Zimmer leider auch zum Lichtschacht hin mit der Folge, dass sehr wenig Tageslicht ins Zimmer gelangte. Da wir aber tagsüber sowieso nicht im Zimmer bleiben wollten hat dies aber nicht speziell gestört. Bei einem nächsten Besuch würde ich aber definitiv kein Zimmer zum Innenhof mehr buchen, auch wenn diese vermutlich ruhiger gelegen sind. Unser Zimmer war sehr geräumig und stylish eingerichtet. Die Dachterrasse mit Pool kann ich nur empfehlen, dort gibts auch leckere Drinks bei einer schönen Aussicht auf die Stadt (schon nicht grad über die ganze Stadt aber doch schon schön...). Hotel ist gut gelegen um die Stadt zu Fuss zu erkunden.
Durchwegs sehr freundliches Personal. ",4,2017,11,08

19,Calma en el centro de Barcelona,"Entrar en el hotel Claris ya es un lujo. La Grand Suite era muy bonita, en dos niveles, aunque algo peligrosa la escalera de acceso a la salita superior. El baño también está bien aunque faltaría un poco de espacio de encimera y en la bañera hay que ir con cuidado pues te das con la cabeza en el canto del techo que es la escalera de acceso arriba.La decoración muy bonita y la cama muy cómoda y espaciosa. Para mi gusto demasiados almohadones, no sabía donde dejarlos. 
El personal es muy atento. Tuvimos un problema en el desayuno, no nos atendieron bien y acabamos ocupando una mesa gogante de una sala contigua, lejos del buffet y tardaron mucho en servirnos el café. El buffet fue correcto. La entrada al Museo Egipcio que viene con el hotel merece la pena aprovecharla.",4,2017,09,20

Betten hart. Kein Schrank, nur Regal, welches durch einen verschiebbaren Spiegel halb verdeckt wurde. Die Schlüsselkarte musste eingesteckt sein, damit der Strom funktioniert, dieses Gerät hatte einen Wackelkontakt, so dass einige Male das Licht ausging. Es war kalt, da der Strom auch bei eingesteckter Schlüsselkarte nicht funktionierte, sobald man das Zimmer verließ. Die Temperatur der Heizung stellte sich dann automatisch zurück. Im Flur wurden permanent Räucherstäbchen verbrannt. Das Personal war sehr nett und bemüht. Die Lage des Hotels ist gut. Ich würdenicht wieder hier wohnen.

Ciabattine morbide, macchina del caffè Nespresso e perfino lo spray da spruzzare sul cuscino per rilassarsi, oltre ad un bagno fornitissima di qualsiasi coccola. Insomma nulla lasciato al caso.

Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile ma non molto organizzato. Salendo alle camere da gli ascensori in vetro si apprezzano molto certe soluzioni architettoniche. Le camere non mi sono parse all'altezza del resto, a volte con combinazione di materiali discutibili ed il bagno aveva una vasca scomoda per la doccia . Buona la colazione ed eccellente la posizione.

Siempre en la Suite duplex más grande ( bueno, la primera vez en la de los Chester marrones, y las últimas en la de LAS fotos que adjunto)... y lo que nunca he comprendido es como las habitaciones SUITES de un 5 estrellas GL SON INTERIORES!!! A un patio oscuro...
La primera vez que me hospedé , hace años, pedí explicaciones, la explicación que se me dio por parte del director fue que "" precisamente para que los mejores clientes descansen mejor y más íntimamente ""... sinceramente, después de 18 años viajando y viviendo en hoteles de 5, nunca había oído ni experimentado semejante explicación ...
El personal es muy atento y profesional... y las habitaciones ( las suites ) no están mal porque tienen sala y siempre preciso recibir visitas ... si bien, reitero, sería un hotel de 10 si estás habitaciones fueran exteriores y tuvieran luz... en ese caso, repetiría con asiduidad, y no por ""descarte""...",4,2016,11,10

19,Gutes Hotel,"Wirklich gutes Hotel, schöne Zimmer, netter Service, gutes Frühstück und schöne Dachterasse. Allerdings eher 4 als 5 Sterne, aber das ist halt in Spanien so. Fitness Raum eher lächerlich, Pool sehr klein, schwimmen kann man da nicht wirklich. In Summe würden wir aber wieder kommen, auch wegen der guten Lage.",4,2016,10,25
19,Gesamtpaket passt,"Pluspunkte: super Lage, elegant und hochwertig ausgestattet, tolle Dachterasse mit Pool, Bar und Restaurant. Unsere Juniorsuite war schön eingerichtet, abseits vom üblichen Mainstream, groß genug, in sehr gutem Zustand. Badewanne mit Massagedüsen, große Dusche. Superbequemes Kingsize-Bett.
Personal sehr nett und hilfsbereit.
Abzüge gibts für die Lage des Zimmers zu einem winzigen dunklen Innenhof/Schaft. Dadurch kommt kaum Tageslicht ins Zimmer. Andererseits aber auch kein Verkehrslärm, was nach einem langen Tag im extrem quirligen Barcelona auch sehr angenehm ist ;-))).
Außerdem hat uns gestört dass nichtmal Wasser am Zimmer zur Verfügung gestellt wird . Bei einem Zimmerpreis von knapp 400€ am Tag sollte das schon drinnen sein.
Alles in Allem hat es uns aber gut gefallen und wir kommen gerne mal wieder.",4,2016,10,20

Hotel molto moderno, ma costellato da numerose statue e reperti molto antichi, molti provenienti dall'Egitto, non solo nella hall ma anche nelle camere. Queste sono moderne, ma funzionali ed ampie. Bela la coda dei dettagli, tra cui lo spray per il cuscino che vi aiuta ad addormentarvi. Bagno bello, con vasca doppia, molto pulito e attrezzato. Il proprietario possiede anche un museo egizio antistante l'hotel, che si può visitare gratuitamente, e vi consiglio di farlo.

La atencion  es excelente, yo como médico de profesión voy mucho a Barcelona y me hospedo en este hotel.

Recepcion, trato agradable y sobretodo agiles. 
Habitaciones, amplias y comodas y diseño acogedor.. Han eliminado las mascaras triviales en las paredes.. Cosa que se agradece. Cama optima, almohadas  muy deficientes..
Desayuno, por obras se ofrece en la terraza.. Aunque con un espacio muy reducido gana mucho el desayuno, es escaso de seleccion, eso si trato del personal esquisito.
En fin un hotel para repetir si el precio es razonable, a igual coste , hotel majestic  continua siendo mi predilección.",4,2016,09,23
19,Qué buen hotel,"Este hotel tiene una ubicación privilegiada. Caminando puedes llegar a varias de las atracciones que ofrece Barcelona. Nos hospedamos en una Junior suite con mi esposa, un cuarto muy amplio con buena decoración y el baño excelente. ",5,2016,09,23

La colazione offre sia una vasta scelta di piatti pronti che  una carta ricca di proposte il tutto gestito da un personale efficente e qualificato come Jmmy e Alvin.

19,"Gute Lage, freundliches Personal ABER....","... für den Preis und den eigenen Anspruch ein bestenfalls durchschnittliches Hotel. 

Zwei Themen möchte ich dabei herausheben:
1. Die meist schmal geschnittenen Zimmer sind sehr hellhörig.
Egal, ob schreiendes Baby, rückkehrende Gäste oder hohe Schuhe auf dem Gang: Sie bekommen alles sehr genau mit. 

2. Es fehlt an jeglicher Möglichkeit die Zimmer zu verdunkeln. Es gibt zwar einen halbtransparenten Sichtschutz, aber das war es auch. 

Beides Dinge, die bei einem Hotel dieser Kategorie  (small luxury hotels... etc.) m.E. nicht sein dürfen. 

Wir werden das nächste Mal ein anderes Hotel wählen. ",3,2016,08,21

19,Sehr gutes Hotel in Top Lage aber keine 5*,Wir waren dieses Jahr zum 2. mal in diesem Hotel nur diesmal für 2 Nächte. Die Lage ist absolut Top. Tiefgaragenplatz gleich anbei. Zimmer super. Wir hatten wieder eine doppelstöckige Juniorsuite die sich sehen lassen kann. Freundliches Personal. Pool auf dem Dach allerdings sehr klein und überlaufen. Sehr kleiner Fitnessraum mit nur 3 Geräten. Ich finde 4* wären eher angebracht. Wir werden aber - allein schon aufgrund der Lage - sicher wieder hier übernachten wenn wir wieder in Barcelona sind.,4,2016,07,23
19,Céntrico y lujoso,"Un servicio muy atento en un excelente hotel de 5 estrellas en el centro de Barcelona. En pleno centro nos resultó ,sin embargo, muy tranquilo.

La terraza del hotel es muy agradable para cenar en verano. 
La ubicación del hotel es excelente.",5,2016,07,21

Zimmer hervorragend und sauber. Aber mit Fenster 
in einen hässlichen Innenhof. Mir scheint das war keine Ausnahme sondern gilt für viele Zimmer.
Kein Ausblick, Rollos heruntergelassen hat uns für ca.
250 Euro sehr gestört.
Hervorragend die Dachterrasse mit Pool incl.
der dort eingenommenen Aperitive.
Aber : am Samstag 13. Juni früh verkam das Hotel zum Massenturismus. Ca. 120 Busreisende (zum halben Preis oder weniger) belegten den Frühstücksraum.
Wartezeiten von 15-20 Minuten. Service stark eingeschränkt. Ein Teil unserer Gruppe kam gar nicht

19,Non al top,"Lo ricordavo lussuoso e in certo senso lo è ancora. Ma alcune ""scivolate"" non sono da hotel di lusso. A partire dalle reception (ho chiesto che mi conservassero in frigo dei cibi acquistati e mi hanno chiesto: ma lei soggiorna qui? E io gli ho risposto ""no abitualmente entro negli alberghi per mettere in frigo il prosciutto""), per continuare nel concierge (lentissimo nel chiamare un taxi). Molto bella la camera e la terrazza dove c'è un bar con vista strepitosa e servizio attento.

19,Me ha gustado mucho más que la primera vez que estuve.,"El Hotel Claris ya es también un clásico en Barcelona. Situado en la zona del Ensanche (en catalán Eixample) en la esquina de la calle Pau Claris con Valencia el hotel se encuentra en un antiguo edificio restaurado, manteniendo su fachada tradicional y ampliado en su altura de forma moderna, pero que no choca con el entorno. El trato del personal es muy agradable y acogedor y hacen todo lo posible para que el cliente se encuentre como en su casa. Admiten perros, lo que me permite viajar a Barcelona con la totalidad de la familia, porque aunque es un animal, está educado exquisitamente y se comporta por el momento mejor que mi hija de menos de dos años, a la que admitirían en cualquier otro hotel a pesar de ser un torbellino. Las habitaciones son grandes y con mucho espacio y silenciosas, pese al tráfico. El hotel se gana con creces sus 5 estrellas gran lujo, desde que se llega, hasta que uno se vá. En su interior un cocktail bar y dos magníficos restaurantes, uno mediterráneo y otro asiático, pero ambos magníficos y de buen precio pese a estar en un gran hotel como el Claris. Por último agradecer la pequeña piscina de la cubierta del hotel. Después de un día de trabajo o de compras con la familia se agradece refrescarse. LLevaba unos años sin venir por distintas circunstancias, pero tengo que decir que este fin de semana en familia, me ha convencido de que este hotel sigue siendo uno de los mejores de Barcelona y que muy pronto volveré a estar aquí.",4,2016,06,04
19,Du kommst als Fremder und gehst als Freund,"Was soll ich sagen, darf ich nach Barcelona, gehe ich ins Hotel Claris🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. Freundliches und aufmerksames Personal, schöne Zimmer und die Terrasse im 7. Stock ist schon was janz feines.
Auch das Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche offen, es werde einige frisch zubereitete Speisen wie Omelett und Waffeln direkt am Tisch serviert, frischer Orangensaft wird ständig offeriert🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.
Das Hotel liegt verkehrsgünstig und die Taxis sind im Vergleich zu anderen europäischen Metropolen günstig. 
Barcelona einfach besuchen und lieben lernen.

19,Un día completo en un hotel urbano de Barcelona,"Aunque residimos en la ciudad, queríamos pasar el día de Sant Jordi relajados en el centro de Barcelona. El Hotel Claris cumplió todas nuestras expectativas. El restaurante la Terraza del Claris (ya lo conocíamos) es inmejorable para comer un día de sol y el Mr. Kao que tiene un punto neoyorquino, es sensacional para cenar.
El hotel es muy cómodo para moverse por el centro.
Nuestra habitación (doble superior) era correcta. La cama muy cómoda y el servicio amable. 
He de reconocer que se ha quedado un poco obsoleto el diseño en relación con otros hoteles de cinco estrellas de la zona, pero el precio lo compensa.
Creo que la oferta del desayuno la han de mejorar, el personal es muy atento pero el desayuno es muy básico, ni la variedad, ni la presentación lo hacen atractivo. De no mejorarlo es preferible desayunar en cualquiera de los locales próximos al hotel.
La cafeteria de Jaime Beriestain es mucho más interesante en ese sentido.
Salvo eso, por lo demás, perfecto.",4,2016,04,27
19,"Hotel justo para ser 5 estrellas lujo, es un 4 estrellas","La verdad que me ha sorprendido que sea un 5 estrellas lujo porque podría pasar por 4 estrellas, las habitaciones no son ninguna maravilla, la mía pequeña con un baño pequeño y con las amenities justas, algunos 4 estrellas tienen mejores habitaciones. El cuarto de baño muy pequeño. El servicio justo, el personal de recepción poco profesional. Sin duda no vale la pena pagar por un 5 estrellas que ofrece servicios de 4 estrellas. ",3,2016,04,21

19,Perfecta ubicación en Barcelona,"Estuve hospedado en dos oportunidades en el mes de Enero, las habitaciones son cómodas aunque por ser Enero (invierno) eran muy calurosas por mas que uno pusiera a funcionar el aire acondicionado. La calidad del personal es acorde al hotel, salvo una de las personas de la noche que me dijo que el business center no estaba operativo para poder hacer mi check in del avión. Destaco la buena predispoción de Nuria, que trató de solucionar el inconveniente que tuve al llegar en la segunda visita.
El hotel se encuentra ubicado en un lugar estratégico para quienes desean visitar las mas importantes atracciones de Barcelona. ",4,2016,02,22

19,Un paseo por un museo,"El Hotel Claris destila arte por todos lados en gran parte gracias a su ideal ubicación y sobretodo, por el gran legado artístico que hay en su interior, donado por la Familia Clos.

Cada habitación es una experiencia en si misma ya que todas tienen algo especial...son como pequeños museos donde sólo pagas entrada para dos personas.

Con la apertura del nuevo restaurante, MR Kao, han puesto la guinda en el pastel ;)",5,2016,02,01
19,"Bello, ottimo e centralissimo ma........","Il Claris ti aiuta senz'altro a conoscere e vivere il centro elegante della città. 
Ottima stanza, anche se un pó piccola, ben arredata e molto confortevole. 
Eccoci al ""ma"": arrivati verso l'ora di pranzo, fatto un breve riposino (sacrosanto, dopo la sveglia del mattino) e rientrati in camera verso le 17, dopo un primo assaggio di passeggiata, abbiamo trovato il letto così come lo avevamo lasciato e, nel corso della serata, nessuno si è fatto vivo per l'atteso refresh.  Così il giorno dopo e questo ci ha indotti a segnalare il fatto al ricevimento. Da quell momento tutto ha preso a girare perfettamente e, la terza sera, abbiamo trovato anche il cioccolatino vicino al cuscino.
Tenuto conto comunque dell'insieme del servizio dell'hotel, lo possiamo considerare un peccato assolutamente veniale. Concludendo, l'esperienza è stata senz'altro positiva, anche grazie alla gentilezza del personale, all'ottima colazione e al confort generale.
Punto di forza, come detto, l'ubicazione eccellente rispetto alleprincipali attrattive di Barcellona",5,2016,02,01

19,Non alla altezza delle stelle,"Buona serata abbiamo soggiornato in questi giorni presso questo hotel ma la ricercatezza degli arredi non corrisponde assolutamente al servizio. Arrivati in albergo alle 13 la camera non era pronta e il recepionist ci dice che dovremo aspettare fino alle 15 ma faranno il possibile: alle 14 era pronta. La prima sera  dopo aver rifatto la stanza lasciano un cioccolatino sul cuscino....ma solo la prima sera. Per il caffè solo 4 capsule di Nespresso e poi se le vuoi le devi pagare....il nescaffe no? Come in migliaia di alberghi nel mondo? Attenzione alla presa elettrica....una mi è rimasta in mano. Per non parlare Dell insonorizzazione scarsissima....sarà che qui di cartongesso c'è ne veramente tanto...
Infine non mi rimane che consigliare al direttore di curare meglio queste cose perché solo con gli arredi non si fa un grande Albergo. Prego astenersi da risposte di rito. Grazie",1,2015,12,30

19,Muchas gracias,Fue solamente una noche pero tanto mi familia de Venezuela como yo nos sentimos como en casa. Gracias a todos los camareros de la terraza. Hicieron que pasáramos una gran velada. Gracias al personal por su amabilidad. Fueron todos encantadores.,5,2015,12,20
19,Confortable hotel,"Si busca un lugar cómodo y bien comunicado es su hotel,  con una estupenda terraza para disfrutar de una copa en un entorno singular y elegante.  El desayuno es estupendo pero el comedor es un poco pequeño cuando utilizan la sala contigua para algún evento.",4,2015,12,17
19,Qué buen Hotel!!,"Merece la pena viajar para encontrar hoteles como el Claris, muy bien ubicado, silencioso, decorado con esculturas magníficas antiguas,y con todos los servicios en un nivel elevado.
Muy limpio, y admiten mascotas. Barcelona vale la pena, el hotel Claris también.",5,2015,12,16
19,La sonrisa amable del portero,"He estado en este hotel para una comida de empresa. Todo genial, comida, servició y ubicación en el centro de Barcelona.
Sin embargo, lo mejor del hotel es el portero. Sonrisa siempre a punto para cualquier persona que pase por delante. Gracias, Arsenio!",5,2015,11,28
19,Excelente opción ,"Excelente servicio e instalaciones. Muy buena atención y cuidado de los detalles. Excelente ubicación, muy céntrico y bien comunicado. Victoria, la Relaciones Públicas, se encargó de que nuestro aniversario fuera inolvidable. Muy recomendable, tanto para viajes de negocios como familiares.",5,2015,11,19
19,100% recomendable,"Me hablaron de su fantástica terraza y de sus servicios,  así que decidí celebrar mi aniversario en este hotel. Tengo que decir que el trato fue excelente,  y su relaciones públicas,  Victoria hizo que fuera un aniversario inolvidable. Totalmente recomendable",5,2015,11,19
19,Un gustazo,"Nos decantamos por este hotel por su ubicación y las fotos, que nos parecieron fantásticas. Pero una vez hospedados, todo estuvo por encima de nuestras expectativas. Cómodo, personal atento, en especial agradecer a Victoria, la relaciones públicas, que nos ayudó a que nuestra estancia en Barcelona fuera fantástica.",5,2015,11,16
19,Was habe ich von einem Grand Luxe zu erwarten?,"Zwei Nächte im Hotel Claris: Fünfstern GL, also Grand Luxe. So bewertet Spanien dieses Haus. Für mich ist es ein Vierstern-Hotel, von dem ich weit aus mehr erwartet habe.
Bestechend schön: Das Hotel wirkt architektonisch sehr harmonisch. Der Bezug zu Kunst und Kultur vermischt sich mit edlen Materialien, wie Stein, Holz, Marmor und wertigen Einrichtungsgegenständen.
Auf dem Dach ""Roof Top"" ein Pool, der leider nicht beheizt ist und damit nicht zu nutzen war. Das kleine (Doppel-)Zimmer (Nr 123) zeigt zum Innenhof, in dem nur auf Verlangen durch die Rezeption ein Fenster geöffnet werden kann. Im Innenhof toben künstliche Wasserfälle, die lauter als Strassenlärm empfunden werden. Das Zimmer selbst ist dunkel mit niedrigen Decken. Absolut furchtbar ist die Qualität der Federkern-Betten, die keinen guten Schlaf versprechen. Das Restaurant im Souterrain ist fensterlos, was ich nicht mag. Das Frühstück exzellent. Das Personal an der Rezeption geschult und freundlich. Das Personal oben auf dem Roof Top ist eher unwirsch und die Qualität der kleinen Speisen (Pancakes mit Eis, die kalt und glitschig waren), weit unterdurchschnittlich. Barcelona hält weitaus bessere Hotel bereit. Das Claris muss es für mich in Bezug auf Preis-Leistung nicht mehr sein...",3,2015,11,12
19,Excelente opcion,"Buen servicio, calidad de habitaciones y ubicación excelente opción para alojarse en Barcelona. Personal muy amable y dispuesto a atender al huésped de la mejor manera. Recomendable ampliamente en todo sentido
      
      
      ",5,2015,11,08
19,Chapeau.,"Cuando vas a un cinco estrellas GL, como es el caso, frecuentemente no somos conscientes de todo lo que hay detrás...al menos yo....
La capacidad y calidad de servicio que tenemos a nuestra disposición pasa habitualmente desapercibida en circunstancias normales.
Por razones que ni vienen al caso yo he tenido, en el Claris, ocasión de percibirlo.
Y ciertamente el Claris ha sobrepasado cualquier expectativa en calidad de servicio, y lo que es más importante en calidez humana.
Todo funciona como una maquina perfectamente engrasada, con la exactitud que da la alta escuela.
Y en lo que ordinariamente buscamos en un hotel igualmente todo supera la excelencia, desde las habitaciones, (no hay dos iguales ), hasta el room servíce con una carta inusual por amplia y calidad.
Y desde luego un servicio impecable.
Chapeau.",5,2015,11,07
19,Ottimo hotel,"Ottimo hotel centralissimo a 50 mt da Passeig de Gracia. 
Abbiamo soggiornato una settimana benissimo. La stanza, seppure una junior suite ere un po piccola nella zona notte ma comunque sufficiente. Insonorizzata perfettamente nonostante il traffico. Colazione abbondante e con servizio da ristorante.  Ristorante La terrazza di ottimo livello con servizio eccellente come nel resto dell'hotel. Personale preparato simpatico e molto disponibile. Un ringraziamento particolare a Victoria. Da tornarci. ",5,2015,11,07
19,Fantastisches Hotel an zentraler Lage,"Das Hotel überzeugt nicht nur durch das moderne Interieur und die stilvolle Dekoration; auch der Service war jederzeit zuvorkommend. Das Gepäck kann problemlos deponiert werden und zur Begrüssung gibt's ein Glas Cava.
Die 3 Nächte im Superior Doppelzimmer mit zwei Matratzen, inkl. Fenster in Zimmer 415. Das Fenster verfügt über einen blickdichten, elektronischen Rollladen - ideal für Langschläfer.
Das Badezimmer mit Badewanne/Dusche, Klo und Bider. Sehr flauschige Bademäntel, die Pflegeprodukte wurden täglich nachgefüllt.
Unbedingt empfehlenswert ist die Terrasse für einen Absacker am Abend.
Jederzeit wieder! ",5,2015,10,20
19,Pequeña decepción,"Me esperaba una habitación mejor para el precio.
Mala coordinación entre los recepcionistas de la mañana y de la tarde.
Dificultades para reservar en el restaurante aun estando alojado allí.
Agradezco la invitación para el Museo Egipcio.
      ",3,2015,10,19
19,Personal amable y localización fantástica!,"El hotel tiene un ambiente muy agradable, la decoración, los colores, el ruido del agua dan mucha sensación de paz a los clientes. El personal es educado y amable. La terraza es muy bonita y merece la pena visitarla para tomar una copa. La localización es estupenda! El único problema que tuve fue el ruido en los pasillos por la noche.",4,2015,10,14
19,Super Lage für einen Shoppingtripp.,"Für ein 3 Tägigen - Aufenthalt haben wir das Hotel Claris gebucht. Von Flughafen zum Hotel sind es ca. 20min mit dem Taxi. Lage des Hotels ist ideal und vieles ist zu Fuss erreichbar ob die Einkaufsstrasse Passeig de Gràcia oder Barri Gòtic oder La Ramba.  In einer halber Stunde gelingt Mann zu Fuss zum Strand. Für einen Shoppingtrip ist das Hotel Ideal.
Das Hotel ist sehr schön eingerichtet und Personal ist sehr freundlich vor allem beim Check In. Wir hatten einen Upgrade gekriegt in die Kind Size Suite. Das Zimmer 211 ist sehr Rustikal eingerichtet und für meinen Geschmack zu dunkel. Ich hätte lieber die Duplex Suite gehabt wie ursprünglich gebucht.Dafür gibt es eine Sauna und Jacuzzi drin. Die Geste war nett, aber da wir nur 3 Tage da waren konnten wir dies auch nicht nutzen. Das Bett war unbequem. Eine Kaffeemaschine gab es auch aber nur mit 4 Kapselkaffe. und weitere 4 Kapseln kostetet 4 €. Für ein 5Sterne haus bisschen merkwürdig! Hotel Bar ist sehr klein sowie auch der Pool. Ebenfalls die Auswahl an Getränken ist sehr eingeschränkt.",4,2015,10,05
19,Encantado!!,"Fantástico hotel, trato cercano y muy profesional, habitación amplia llena de confort y lujo, terraza de cine y un perfecto restaurante, sinceramente perfecto hotel en Barcelona, a una calle del Paseo de Gracia.",5,2015,09,28
19,Tolles Hotel im Centrum,"Sehr schönes Zimmer mit toller Einrichtung, wie der Rest des Hotels auch. Sehr stylisch und modern. Personal war wirklich klasse und sehr zuvorkommend.
Frühstück war super, frische Omeletts etc. auf Wunsch extra zubereitet.
Zentrale Lage in der Stadt mit sehr guter Anbindung zur Metro.",5,2015,09,26
19,Städte Trip ,Das Hotel Claris in Barcelona ist sehr zu empfehlen. Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Essen im Hause ist auch sensationell. Wir hatten ein sieben Gang Menü für 52.euro. Auf der Dachterrasse es war einfach super. Nur mit der Sprache hat es ein wenig gehapert aber sonst War alles gut. Lg Monika aus Schweiz ,5,2015,09,15
19,Empfehlenswert,"Sehr gutes Hotel in ausgezeichneter Lage. Rezeption zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Schöne Dachterasse mit kleinem Pool und Bar. Spezielles Design, individuell. Ich würde wieder in dieses Hotel gehen. Prima war auch, dass man den Hotel-Smart nutzen konnte",5,2015,09,07

19,Te quiero,"Ci siamo tornati per la seconda volta e confermo il giudizio della precedente.
Il Claris è moderno ma con charme, confortevole, pulito, ha un roof garden da mille 
e una notte, per piscina e tapas...
Servizio di livello e quartiere tranquillo.
Prezzi elevati ma adeguati.",5,2015,08,23
19,Io ci tornerò di sicuro!,"Abbiamo soggiornato una settimana al Claris e siamo stati coccolati dal personale efficente e gentile, colazioni, aperitivi in piscina, cene, servizio in camera, autista .. tutto stupendo!
lo consiglio con il cuore!",5,2015,08,17
19,Repetire,"La gente del hotel super bien, en especial los de Recepción,y sobre todo el Sr. Ricardo.
La única pega que le encuentro a este hotel es el servicio de  la Terraza , ya que son super lentos y tanto el servicio como la comida dejan mucho que desear para un hotel de 5 estrellas GL:, deberían de fijarse en otros hoteles como el OHLA  o el OMM.",4,2015,07,27
19,Desencanto,"Hotel muy bien situado en el Eixample de Barcelona, con habitaciones espaciosas y bonitas. Desencanto porque para mi un hotel 5 estrellas GL tiene que estar perfecto y  en este caso el estado de la pintura , muebles y algunas estacnias no era perfecto y el aislamiento acustico en las habitaciones que dan a la calle es infame. La terraza tiene un bar espectacular pero muy lento.Desayuno bastante bien pero la chica que atendia la sala trató a unos clientes extranjeros de modo bastante grosero cuando ellos solo pedían un poco de atención, por lo demás muy bueno",3,2015,07,24
19,¡Mejor imposible!,Nos dieron la suite presidencial por ser nuestra noche de bodas y nos hicieron llegar algunas cosas que nos olvidamos en taxi. Instalaciones originales y de calidad y trato personal y atento. ¡Genial!,5,2015,07,15
19,"Muy agradable, acogedor y bien ubicado. Gran servicio","Hotel acogedor, con preciosas vistas, gran emplazamiento, y novedoso atractivo con museo Egipcio. Aunque solo sea por tomarte un Martini en la terraza, con sus preciosas vistas de Barcelona, al fresquito de la tarde, merece muy mucho la pena. El servicio es divino...",5,2015,07,09
19,Lejos de un GL,"La categorización de los hoteles en España ya no es lo que era. Antes -y en parte ahora- de regía por una normativa que, por lo que se comprueba continuamente, carece de mucho criterio y no creo que contemple aspectos del alojamiento que deberían ser relevantes (el servicio, por ejemplo). Hace años eran contados los GL, casi siempre asociados a antiguos establecimientos de no menos tardíos edificios con mobiliario (y personal) acorde a la estampa. Seguramente en aquella época tenía un porque, y era aceptado. Ahora creo que estamos en una situación muy diferente y se da con alegría este añadido Grand Luxe a un 5*. 
Mis dos últimas experiencias (uno de costa, que solamente abre 7/8 meses, por lo cual ya no debería tener cabida el GL, y el que os hablo) no me han dejado indiferente. En el Claris no he encontrado este plus que puedes ""degustar"" en muchos de los hoteles de Oriente Medio o Sudeste Asiático que superan con creces las prestaciones, espectacularidad, situación, servicios, atención, etc etc. Hablamos de un pequeño palacio reconvertido, algo de museo, bonita y funcional habitación, pasable buffet de desayuno... pero nada que haga embobarte por esta experiencia (y precio). Si a todo ello añadimos un personal ""muy justito"" en el momento de atenderte e interesarse por tu estancia convierte a lo que debería ser un buen recuerdo, en algo muy pasajero y olvidable. Esta ha sido mi sensación.",3,2015,07,07
19,Espectacular,"Una lástima haber disfrutado de este hotel solamente una noche, espero volver algún día.
Las habitaciones son muy bonitas y el descanso está garantizado.
Buena conexión Wifi.
Desayuno no muy variado pero de calidad.",5,2015,06,20
19,Vacanze,"Hotel molto bello, situato nei pressi della via ""della moda""
L'hotel è dotato di una bella terrazza con piscina all'ultimo piano con una buona vista.
Le stanze sono comode e il personale cortese. purtroppo non mi è parso troppo vicino a locali serali ma la cosa buona di Barcellona è che puoi girare in taxi per la città spendendo veramente poco",5,2015,06,19
19,"Hotel Boutique, que no dudamos calificar lujoso con una decoraciòn muy original","Construido sobre lo que antes fue el Museo Egipcio (ahora a pocos metros de alli en un nuevo edificio) este Hotel Boutique que no dudamos calificar de lujoso cuenta con una decoración muy original en estilo moderno con muebles antiguos y valiosas obras de arte. La atenciòn del personal es excelente, bombones, flores en la habitación y hasta sofisticada agua mineral eran los obsequios que recibimos a diario. 
El desayuno es muy bueno (el lugar un tanto oscuro) pero el restaurante en la Terraza es muy bueno (recomiendo el ciervo con boniato o el arroz con bogavante) 
-Ver las propociones del día que pueden reducir bastante la cuenta-
Las habitaciones muy amplias, el gimnasio correcto. Es un hotel de precio elevado pero vale lo que ofrecen.",5,2015,06,12
19,"buena situación, mejorable el servicio","Habitación estupenda con un baño precioso, el desayuno es mejorable y hay un poco de descontrol en el room service. Situación inmejorable. Dan bastantes facilidades en la entrada y el chek out es rápido. Precios elevados",4,2015,06,10
19,"Claris Barcelona, realmente 5*GL","Absolutamente todo el personal está pendiente de lo que necesites a cada momento. El servicio, staff, sitio, terraza, son simplemente fantásticos. ¡Gracias por todo!
Estoy segura que repetiré con otro evento, ¡sin duda!",5,2015,03,16
19,Maravillosa estancia con Ash,"Estuve este fin de semana y fue estupendo! 
Me recibieron con una copa de cava, y el servicio es muy amable y atento. 
Lleve a mi perrita y la trataron como a una más, las habitaciones son muy espaciosas. 
No os perdáis el restaurante de la terraza, de 10!  

Lo recomiendo 100%",5,2015,03,16
19,Expectacular,"Hemos pasado un fin de semana inolvidable. Gracias a la gentileza del hotel por proporcionarnos una de las mejores habitaciones, la suite duplex, cuando teniámos reservada una standar. El servicio ha sido excelente, a la habitación no le faltaba detalle y en general, todos en el hotel trabajan para hacerte agradable la estancia. Tuvimos que pedir el coche en un par de ocasiones y nos lo trajeron puntualmente, y hasta tiene un servicio de cafe de cortesía si tienes que salir pronto y no te da tiempo a llegar al desayuno, detalle éste que no había visto en ningún otro hotel de esta categoria, y he estado en unos cuantos.
En general, unos grandes profesionales y un hotel de lujo de referencia en Barcelona.
El restaurante es fantástico, por el servicio, la comida, las vistas, aunque eso, como es obvio, se paga. Nos animamos a comer allí porque se nos ofreció un descuento del 20% por estar alojados, lo que hizo que la cuenta fuera menos ""dolorosa"".",5,2015,02,23
19,Fabuloso,"La unica pega que la habitacion era un poco ruidosa. Por lo demas, tengo que comentar que mi estancia fue muy agradable. El personal fue siempre muy atento y la la localizacion del hotel no pudo ser mejor. Definitivamente volvere a este hotel.
              ",4,2015,02,20
19,Experiencia que espero repetir,"Me recomendó un familiar de Barcelona hace unos meses este hotel por el emplezamiento y por la originalidad y vistosidad del hotel, y reconozco que se han superado las expectativas. El servicio del hotel es una delicia, la restauración en cuanto a calidad por el precio que se requiere es totalmente justa y me quedé con la sensación de un dinero buen invertido, y además he de reconocer que lo que más me gustó es la decoración de las habitaciones y espacios comunes, algo que siempre valoro como positivo para ayudarme a desconectar y descansar que es lo que pido yo a un hotel. Espero volver a Barcelona próximamente y volveré al Claris, seguro",5,2015,02,17
19,Un trato genial.,"Este fin de semana pasado estuvimos en el hotel Claris de Barcelona, celebramos la despedida de soltero de un amigo, el trato fue buenísimo, nos dejaron hacer el check in antes de hora. Tenian libre una suit, y nos alojaron en ella sin suplemento en el precio. Recomiendo este hotel para cualquier visita a Barcelona, te dirigen muy y te recomiendan buenos sitios.",5,2015,02,11
19,Super schick und zentral,"Sehr zuvorkommendes und freundliches Personal. Zentrale Lage. Sehr schönes individuelles Mobiliar mit teilweise antiquarischem Wert in der Duplex Junior-Suite. Sehr schöne Dachterrasse, allerdings in diesem Februar zu kalt. Also kommen wir gerne in einer wärmeren Zeit wieder.

19,Para una estancia romantica,"Mi opinión sobre el hotel Claris de Barcelona no puede ser más positiva ya que tuvimos excelente servicio a más de que disponiamos de una lujosa habitación con una maravillosa terraza donde pudimos contemplar unas estupendas vistas. 
Acabamos de pasar un fin de semana en el hotel Claris mi novio y yo estábamos de aniversario.
Cuando llegamos, nuestra habitación ya estaba preparada (pese a ser antes de la hora de check in)
La habitación era espaciosa y tenia dos espacios, estilo duplex.
En la séptima planta está la terraza y en ella el restaurante  (no hay que perderselo),la carta de vinos es increible y el steack tartar me dejo sin palabras...
El personal de todo el hotel es muy atento y rápido ayudando con todo.
Por la tarde, cuando volvimos del paseo, nos esperaba una sorpresa en la habitación, una botella de cava y unas catanias! 
Realmente demuestran que se preocupan por conocer a sus clientes y por los detalles...
Sinceramente ha pasado a ser nuestro hotel de referencia en Barcelona.
Eso es todo!!!! Mil gracias.",5,2015,02,09
19,Mejor...imposible!,"Me alojé en el Hotel Claris de Barcelona con mi pareja una noche y ha sido, sin lugar a dudas, de las mejores estancias en un hotel que he tenido en mi vida. Desde luego no habría sido posible sin la previa colaboración en los detalles (era una sorpresa para mi pareja) de Álex Hernández (Rooms Division Manager) y de Marc Schmid (Front Desk Manager Assistant), ha sido todo un hallazgo ya que de su profesionalidad, imagen impecable y trato al cliente deberían aprender muchos. Les deseo mucha suerte y lo mejor en su futuro en el sector y algún día volver a encontrarme con ellos de nuevo, gracias a vosotros el Claris ha ganado dos nuevos clientes.Felicito al resto del equipo también, por supuesto, todos hicieron que nos sintiéramos como en casa.",5,2015,02,05
19,Perfecta Ubicacion,"El Hotel Claris en Barcelona es una buenísima selección ... La ubicación es perfecta, ya q estas a solo pasos del Paseo de Gracia, La plaza Catalunya, El Barrio Gótico y las Ramblas.....
Caminas x lugares muy agradables y te encuentras muy cerca de todos esos puntos claves en Barcelona.
Una Ubicacion Perfecta.
El Bar y Restaurant en el top del edificio, son muy agradables y acogedores. Totalmente recomendables para pasar un buen rato de relax y de disfrute.
Si tiene algo no tan perfecto, es q las habitaciones q son muy modernas y muy bien decoradas, no son tan prácticas para acomodar tu equipaje. 
He probado diferentes modelos de ellas y hay unas mas practicas q otras, todo dependerá de la suerte q tengas.
El personal a veces no es tan simpático, aunq se esmeran por serlo.... Y también esto depende de la suerte con la q estés.
El  Lobby muy amplio y agradable, el desayuno exquisito y elegante..
La verdad es q cada vez q voy a Barcelona, repito El Claris porq tiene un encanto muy especial y te sientes totalmente involucrado con la cuidad.",4,2015,01,31
19,Excelente ubicación y relación-calidad precio,"Excelente ubicación cerca de paseo de gracia, Pedrera, etc. La relación-calidad precio es muy buena (al menos en enero). El trato de los empleados es excelente y el servicio de desayuno con cocina al instante perfecto.

19,Hält nicht was es verspricht...,"Architektonisch ein Super Hotel... Personal oft etwas überfordert! Sauberkeit in den Zimmern und Suites lässt zu wünschen übrig. 
Das Frühstück lässt genauso enttäuschend und völlig überteuert. Dafür wird man im Restaurant La Terraza (auf dem Dach) verwöhnt. Die Speisen sind absolut köstlich aber nicht für einen grossen Hunger gedacht...",4,2015,01,11
19,MAGNIFICO !,"sono stato al Claris Hotel alla fine di settembre con la mia famiglia, è devo assolutamente dire che l'Hotel in tutte le sue prestazioni è risultato semplicemente MAGNIFICO! La junior suite che ho ricevuto aveva un bellissimo soppalco, con vetrata a tutta altezza da mozzare il fiato, 2 TV da 40""
è dei bagni di ultimissima generazione con vasca a vista e tante piccole attenzioni che da un 5 stelle non sempre attendi. La prima colazione è all'altezza è molto apprezzato il succo di arancia fresco che numerosi e attenti camerieri lo servono con frequenza. Spettacolare hall con un giardino pensile e ascensore panoramico con vetrate sul verde e cascate d'acqua un tripudio di fantasia dell'architetto che in una città come Barcellona che ha dato i natali ad un certo Gaudì, per certi versi, lo riconosci. Per la location beh è perfetta ! a poche centinaia di metri dalla ramblas e centro gotico, a pochi metri da tutti punti di trasporto non serve altro.. Assolutamente consigliato per una Barcellona a 5 stelle !",5,2015,01,08
19,schönes Hotel in bester Lage,"Im Eixample von Barcelona gelegen, 5 Minuten von Passeig de Gracia und Plaça Catalunya, bietet das Hotel schöne Zimmer und vor allem einen ausgezeichneten Service. Das Restaurant ist etwas sehr neutral, dafür kann man auf der gegenüberliegenden Strassenseite im argentinischen Restaurant 9Reinas ganz ausgezeichnet essen. Hotel hat kein eigenen Parking und der neben dem Hotel gelegene ist für grössere Fahrzeuge eine Zumutung.",4,2015,01,05
19,Un hotel para repetir,"Es muy centrico, tiene las amenidades necesarias y el personal muy agradable y servicial. Esta localizado en una area de facial acceso por metro y cerca de atracciones a distancia caminable como la Pedreira. Tiene cerca tambien tiendas de marca asi como lugares de comida.",5,2014,12,29

19,"Gran Hotel, Ubicación perfecta",La ubicación de este hotel es estupenda. Puedes ir andando a un montón de sitios de interés. La habitación estaba bastante bién equipada y era cómoda.

En general todo muy bién.,4,2014,12,05
19,buon Hotel,"Ottimo hotel e ottima posizione centrale, letto da 190 troppo corto per un hotel di questo livello. Il personale è preparato e molto cordiale, colazione ottima.

19,Ottimo soggiorno - Ottima Location,"Lo consiglio per la particolarità del design specie delle zone comuni. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo e posizione top.

19,"Decoración exquisita, situado en un punto perfecto de la ciudad","Hemos quedado muy contentos con el hotel.
Es un hotel caro, pero al haber estado hospedado en él y visto y disfrutado de él, lo comprendo.
Nos alojamos en la habitación executive dos adultos y un niño, cenamos en el  restaurante La terraza, obviamente en el ático del hotel. Todo fenomenal.
La habitación es exquisita, amplia, tranquila, con una decoración preciosa. El cuarto de baño, además de bañera y ducha separadas, en el interior de la cabina de la ducha, cuenta con una especie de baño turco - caldarium. no se puede pedir más tranquilidad.
En el restaurante cenamos muy bien, los platos no son de poca cantidad a pesar de lo que pueda parecer el precio y el lugar. Es muy recomendable.",4,2014,11,20
19,Für Business-Reisende nicht geeignet - und kein Fünf-Sterne-Haus,"Das Hotel liegt zentral und ist sehr chic eingerichtet. Viele Mitarbeiter sind auch bemüht, leider nicht alle: Obwohl ich ausdrücklich und sehr frühzeitig ein ruhiges Zimmer nachgefragt hatte, musste ich zweimal (!) umzuiehen, bevor ich wirklich schlafen konnte. Die meisten Zimmer gehen zu einer stark befahrenen Straßenkreuzung hinaus und sind sehr schlecht isoliert. Auch bei geschlossenem Fenster ist der Lärm kaum zu  überhören. 
Zudem sind die Superior-ZImmer relativ klein und haben zumeist keinen Schreibtisch. Das kostenlose WLAN - für mich ein Buchungskriterium - funktionierte so gut wie nie und wenn, dann nur im Bad.  EIne Mitarbeiterin räumte ein, der Server sei zu knapp bemessen und viele Gäste beschwerten sich. An der Rezeption bestritt man das selbstverständlich. Wer ein WLAN braucht, sollte also gleich zu Anfang ein kostenpflichtiges Paket buchen - und hoffen, dass er eine adäquate Gegenleistung erhält.
Das Frühstück kann ich nicht bewerten, weil mir der Preis im Vergleich zu den umliegenden Cafes doch arg überzogen erschien. Die Fitnessgeräte im Dachgeschoss habe ich auch nicht benutzt; sie machten einen etwas überalterten Eindruck.
Erst nach der Abreise habe ich festgestellt, dass sich mein bescheidener  Minibar-Konsum virtuell verdoppelt hatte: Das heißt, es wurden Artikel berechnet, die ich nicht verbraucht hatte. Aber da hatte ich schon keine Lust mehr, mich damit auseinanderzusetzen. Zeit ist schließlich auch Geld, wie man sagt.
Ach so: Aus dem Badezimmer verschwanden eines Tages noch nicht verbrauchte Gratis-Produkte und wurden nicht mehr ersetzt. Dafür hatte ich dann ein Silberfischchen als Mitbewohner. Fünf Sterne Grand Luxe? Eher nicht!",3,2014,11,16
19,Posizione strategica,"Hotel molto interessante,la posizione ad una quadra dal Paseo de Gracia rende accessibile,per chi vuole camminare,il cuore della città.
L'estrema gentilezza del personale,la calda luce soffusa delle camere e la terrazza lo rendono uno splendido ritiro.
Non ho usufruito della colazione ma per quanto ho potuto vivere l'hotel e' un'ottima struttura.",4,2014,11,06
19,Ser o no ser,"Hemos estado cenando en el restaurante La terraza del Claris, cabe decir que tanto el lugar como la comida y sus vinos estan a la altura de un restaurante de su categoría, nos ha encantado! 
Marcaría el steaktartar como el plato estrella de la cena, aunque su solomillo es exquisito. 
A pesar de una excelente comida, la nota especial a la velada la dio nuestro camarero, Massimo, nos impresionó su buen trato, gracia, educación, cercanía... Al salir de la cena nos hemos dado cuenta tanto mi acompañante como yo que lo que más nos llamó la atención fue el buen trato recibido por dicho camarero. Un 10 para el! ",5,2014,10,31
19,Lujoso y bien situado,"El hotel está muy próximo al Passeig de Gracia. Es tranquilo y elegante.
Las habitaciones muy limpias y con una cama comodísima.

Desayuno a precio elevado (23 euros) si no se es muy comilón...",4,2014,10,28
19,Eigentlich gutes Hotel mit eher kleinen Zimmern!,"Die Zimmer sind sauber und sehr zweckdienlich eingerichtet. Wenn man vom Service in einem 5*-Hotel spricht, gehört eine Gratisflasche Wasser mit zum Service. Gibt es hier nicht! Da das Hotel direkt an einer vielbefahrenden Straße liegt und die Lärmdämmung nach außen wohl nicht das primäre Ziel des Ausbau des Hotels war, ist es ziemlich laut auf den Zimmern. Das Frühstück ist sehr gut und der restliche Service ist gut.",3,2014,10,28
19,Turismo en Barcelona,"Reservamos una hab. executive para pasar cuatro días en Barcelona, nos quedamos bastante decepcionados ya que el hotel lo venden como cinco estrellas GL y esta muy lejos de tener esa categoría. La hab. bastante pequeña y nuestro hijo adolescente tuvo que dormir en el sofá que ni siquiera se convertía en cama. Precio carísimo ya que coincidía con un evento en Barcelona, pero no estaba a la altura. Personal amable y muy buena ubicacion",3,2014,10,26
19,Moderno e accogliente,bell'hotel di design moderno e ricercato con personale assai gentile e preparato. Ho dormito con mia moglie in una suite ampia e accogliente.

Las habitaciones muy bien y los baños geniales. El servicio excelente. A mencionar especialmente la Terraza que hay arriba donde se come muy bien y a un precio razonable.,5,2014,10,15
19,Simplemente fantástico,"Desde hace muchos años tengo el placer de ser cliente del hotel, y por ello no tuve ninguna duda en celebrar el evento de nuestra boda en el hotel.
Dado que ya nos habíamos casado en Italia y celebrado con la familia, en esta ocasión queríamos hacer una celebración con los amigos exclusivamente y así lo hicimos y fue maravilloso. Simplemente fantástico..., celebramos un cóctel cena en la terraza que fue estupendo, una atmósfera maravillosa y un trato exquisito.",5,2014,09,17
19,"Buen hotel, buen servicio, buena ubicación","El hotel esta en un lugar céntrico de Barcelona, , habitaciones amplias y agradables, el personal muy correcto, limpieza perfecta. El recibidor del hotel muy amplio y luminoso, hace sentirse en un lugar muy apetecible. Felicidades a todo el equipo.",4,2014,09,15
19,Opcion aceptable para Barcelona,"Estuvimos con mi familia 5 dias en julio.
El hotel esta lindo, pero las habitaciones creo que en poco tiempo van a tener que refaccionarlas. Al tener piso de madera, llama la atencion la cantidad de rayas en el piso y uno quita la vista en el resto que esta bastante bien.
La ubicacion y el servicio del hotel resultaron ser muy buenos.",4,2014,09,01
19,Restaurante en la terraza pésimo.,"Hotel bonito, nada a destacar en positivo, es un 5 estrellas.
El desayuno escaso, poca variedad, me sorprendió en negativo para ser un 5 estrellas.
Habitaciones bien.
El restaurante de la terraza fatal. Relación calidad-precio  pésima.Carta escueta, el metre, si se puede llamar metre, o encargado, bastante antipático, por no saber, no sabe ni cómo van conformados los platos, igual era nuevo, pero no es excusa.
No volveré.",3,2014,08,29
19,Bonitas vistas con cena,"Justamente ayer fuimos a cenar a este Hotel, ya que se han puesto de moda las terrazas y el tiempo lo permite porque no aprovechar? Fuimos tres persona con un niño, bonitas vistas, la terraza gupisima y la atencion estupenda. Se puede tomar algo a lado de la piscine y los cockteles estan muy buenos. Pedimos champagne rose para acompañar ceviche de lobina y fois gras, lo acompañamos muy bien. Como plato principal pedimos cordero y solomillo con mil hojas de patatas. La verdad fue algo casi fuera de lo normal porque era buenisimisimisimo todo!!
Por cierto los camareros muy simpaticos. La carta no es muy variada pero apetece probar todo lo que tienen.",4,2014,08,28
19,Bueno,Hotel muy bien ubicado en inmejorable zona. El trato del Front Desk es cordial y servicial. La habitación es un tanto oscura y en los pasillos había olor bastante fuerte como a desagües. La ambientación es agradable y la limpieza buena. Buen hotel aunque le falta como para 5 estrellas gran luxe.,3,2014,08,20
19,Esperaba algo mejor,"El hotel esta muy bien situado, a una cuadra de Paseo de Gracia y se puede ir caminando a la Sagrada Familia y las Ramblas.
Lo mas decepcionante fue la habitacion, bastante oscura, la cama algo dura y no lo encontré a la altura de un 5 estrellas gran lujo. La terraza es agradable, pero pequeña, un dia quisimos comer y no habian mesas, hay que reservar con anticipacion. La piscina tambien es muy pequeña. El desayuno está bien, pero no sorprende para nada. ",3,2014,07,12
19,Muy recomendable,"Me alojé en Julio del año pasado y la verdad es que el trato fue muy bueno desde el momento que hice la reserva. El hotel está muy bien situado, el desayuno es muy bueno y tiene una terraza en el ático insuperable y con piscina. Una estancia muy recomendable",4,2014,06,27
19,Excelente,"Un bello hotel, con un personal cálido, siempre dispuestos a ayudar en todo. Y una ubicación increible. Con una terraza para pasar momentos increíbles, hermoso. Una habitación muy cómoda y muy limpia. Realmente para ir siempre que uno va a Barcelona.",5,2014,06,26
19,5 Estrellas GL ?,"Me he quedado en este Hotel en Septiembre del año 2011 durante una semana , me han reservado una Junior Suite y si llaman a esa habitación una Junior Suite como serán las habitaciones , el Servicio de Recepcion les doy nota 9 por el trato que han tenido conmigo muy bien , el Portero también muy bien todos los dias por la mañana me tenia el coche preparado a la puerta del Hotel al lado del Propietario del Hotel , la Terraza está muy Bien para tomar un café o otra bebida , la Piscina es muy pequeña , Conclusion un el Hotel tener categoria de 5 Estrellas Gran Lujo quereis saber como se hace ? Existen varias maneras que no las voy a poner aqui pero una de ellas es las Estrellas se pagan y cuenta mucho quien es la persona que firma la categoria de los hoteles , puedo hablar de este tema de la manera mas profunda porque soy Inversor Hotelero en Propiedad no en Exploracion hace muchos Años En la Peninsula Iberica y varios Paises del Mundo y mi Abuelo fue Presidente de ATE en España , por eso siempre que voy a Barcelona que son varias veces porque me gusta la Ciudad elijo otros Hoteles .",3,2014,06,21
19,Super freundlicher Service,"Das Hotel entspricht voll den Erwartungen an ein 5 Sterne Hotel. Die Mitarbeiter sind ausgesprochen freundlich. Die Ausstattung der Zimmer ist einmalig. von Draußen dringen keinerlei Geräusche von der bielbefahrenen Straße ins Innere. Leider traf dies nicht für die Innengeräusche des Zimmers zu. Die ""Sozialgeräusche"" aus den angrenzenden Hotelzimmern, insbesondere bei der Toilettennutzung, sind extrem unerfreulich gewesen. Da sich im Zimmer kein Fenster zum öffnen befand, war die Funktion der Klimaanlage zwingend. Leider war diese in der Nacht nicht effektiv. Die Luft im Zimmer war deshalb zu warm.
Die gute Lage des Hotels und das freundliche Personal haben dies jedoch wieder ausgeglichen.",4,2014,06,08
19,Excelente ubicación para visitar Barcelona,"El hotel está situado muy bien para pasar unos días en Barcelona. Está cerca (andando) de la Basílica de la Sagrada Familia. La Casa de la Pedrera y la Casa Batlló, (que se encuentran en el Paseo de Gracia) están a 5 minutos. Y también puedes ir dando un paseo a Las Ramblas y visitar el mercado de la Boquería, la catedral de Barcelona,... 

A mi familia y a mí nos gustó el hotel porque además de la perfecta ubicación, el personal era muy amable y profesional. Queríamos también visitar el Camp Now y nos indicaron cómo era la forma más fácil de ir con nuestro coche. También se interesó en buscarnos la relaciones públicas del hotel, para ver si todo estaba a nuestro gusto y si teníamos alguna duda o necesidad.

Volveremos a Barcelona ya que es una ciudad muy bonita y con mucho encanto. Y por supuesto, nos hospedaremos en el hotel Claris.",4,2014,05,16
19,Excelente,"Entras por la puerta, y a pesar de la sobriedad de la decoración, los recepcionistas te atienden con una sonrisa y con muchísima calidez. 
Atención del personal inmejorable. Serviciales, eficaces y rápidos. 
Habitación muy buena. Muy limpia, cama y almohadas muy cómodas. La habitación tenia una ventana muy grande que daba a la avenida, pero no se oía nada de ruido.  En el baño había amenities, sales de baño, albornoces, zapatillas. Todo cuidado al detalle. 
Y lo dicho, lo mejor, la atención del personal. No solo recepción, las chicas de pisos, camareros del desayuno... Siempre con una sonrisa, amabilidad y profesionalidad. Mis mas sinceras felicitaciones por ello. 
La verdad un hotel, que me ha dado una sorpresa muy agradable y al que sin duda volveré.",5,2014,05,15
19,Muy recomendable en todos los sentidos,"Personal muy agradable , maxima ayuda en todos los sentidos.
muy competente.
ambiente muy tranquilo, a pesar de estar en el mismo centro, muy buenas instalaciones y exxcelente servicio de habitaciones.
restaurante y terraza excelentes y desayunos muy buenos.",5,2014,05,08
19,5 stelle lusso....facciamo 2 stelle e 3 stalle,"Gli oltre 500 recensori che valutano questo hotel eccellente,credo non conoscano i servizi di un 5 stelle l......infatti l unico servizio degno di nota e'all ingresso quando si arriva in albergo con il taxi e c e sempre qualcuno che apre la porta del taxi e che se piove ti ripara con l ombrello.....
Reception con addetti gentili ma incapaci,stanze buie da morire ed opprimenti e per dimensioni, le nostre non arrivavano a 25mq ,e per la scarsa luce,non male il bagno ma senza eccellere,la colazione poco assortita e le marmellate hero sono da fitta camere ....suggestivo il bar sul rooftop ma il servizio e'mediocre....in conclusione altamente sconsigliato",2,2014,04,14
19,Hotel muy aconsejable.,"Hotel con una situación privilegiada,  con un personal muy agradable  y  amable con  una habitación amplia y limpia con una decoración interior de la misma acogedora y exquisita.
La  decoración  de  zonas  comunes, acceso  a las  habitaciones, terraza exterior etc. son 
inmejorables y muy a destacar las esculturas en interiores y exteriores.
Lo recomiendo 9,5 sobre 10. Enhorabuena.",5,2014,04,07
19,Estupendo hotel,"El hotel está en muy buen sitio, el personal muy amable y profesional, desde que te abren la puerta y dan la bienvenida hasta que te dicen hasta pronto.
Habitaciones limpias y el hotel en general.
Lo que no encontré fueron zapatillas para estar en la habitación, espero que la próxima vez encuentre, ya que espero repetir.
Saludos",5,2014,03,15
19,Un buen hotel,"Un buen hotel con un personal amable y correcto.
Algunos detalles impropios de un 5 estrellas en la habitación, sobre todo el kit de baño.
En general, una estancia agradable y con un precio razonable.",4,2014,03,07
19,Errori inammissibili per un hotel 5 stelle,"Abbiamo soggiornato per 3 notti durante il weekend di s.Valentino e abbiamo trovato l'hotel molto scarso per il prezzo pagato. Al nostro arrivo abbiamo dovuto cambiare stanza in quanto, sebbene avessimo esplicitamente chiesto un letto matrimoniale, ci era stata fornita una stanza con 2 letti singoli. La stanza assegnata era -chiaramente- non pronta: pavimento molto sporco, doccia non pulita, tappeti poggiati sul divano. il secondo giorno abbiamo deciso di fare un riposino e rilassarci dopo pranzo ma la stanza - alle ore 15 - non era stata ancora rifatta! Voglio però sottolineare anche gli aspetti positivi dell'hotel: personale con buone conoscenze della lingua italiana, location invidiabile, terrazza con piscina, vasca da bagno in ogni camera.",2,2014,02,23
19,Hotel singular,"Llagamos al hotel y estaba anocheciendo, aparcamos en la misma puerta y mientras nos registrabamos en recepción ya habían guardado el coche y estaban las maletas en la habitación cosa que agradecimos ya que el día había sido duro, cenamos en un restaurante en la Calle Balmes que nos recomendaron y llegar al hotel, ducharse y meterse en la cama fué una gozada, al dia siguiente empece a fijarme un poco más en el hotel y en sus peculiaridades, la verdad es que todo transmitia paz, tranquiidad, serenidad y sobre todo sensibilidad al arte , yo en este aspecto soy profana pero no dejo se sorprenderme este hotel boutique que a la vez parecia un museo. La terraza es muy agradable y el restaurante para repetir, para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas no es excesivamente caro, sin dudarlo volvería",5,2014,02,18
19,Fantástico Hotel,"Precioso hotel, magníficamente situado y lo mejor de todo, su servicio. No pueden ser más amables y más eficientes. La terraza en la parte superior es muy agradable y ofrece todos los servicios necesarios. Desde luego, para repetir!!",5,2014,02,11
19,Hotel excelente,"Precioso hotel muy bien situado y con un buen equipo y excelentes servicios. No deben dejar de visitar el restaurante en la terraza (aún en invierno con la carpa que tienen donde se está calentito). La comida y el servicio son excelentes!!
Sin duda un lugar para repetir aunque sea solo para cenar bien.",4,2014,02,03
19,excelente,"hotel estupendo ,el trato inmejorable la atencion superior todo justo en el centro donde puedes ver parte de la ciudad ,el desayuno perfecto y el sevicio de habitaciones estupendo si tengo q volver sin dudarlo eligiria el hotel claris",5,2014,02,03
19,Excelente Hotel,"El Claris para mi es uno de los mejores hoteles, tienen un servicio impecable, las habitaciones tienen el tamaño justo pero sobre todo están diseñadas para hacerte sentir comido en todo momento. El personal atento, profesional y muy servicial. Tiene una ubicación privilegiada a tan solo 1 cuadra de gracia y a 7 minutos caminando se llega a plaza de Catalunya. La cadena derby hotels merece la pena!",5,2014,01,21
19,Perfecta estancia,"Hotel muy bien situado, cerca de Paseo de gracia, Plaza Cataluña. Desde entrar en el hotel una atención excelente por parte de todo el personal, desde el aparca cotxes a los chicos de la recepción y la chicas de la limpieza de habitación.
La habitación perfecta, con una decoración original y con sopresa de bienvenida.
Totalmente recomendable poder pasar una estancia en este hotel. Si algún día queremos repetir la experiencia no dudaremos en ir otra vez.",5,2014,01,13
19,"Zentral gelegenes Hotel, das allerdings keine 5 Sterne verdient","Das Hotel können wir empfehlen für einen Städtetrip, bei dem man ein zentrales Stadthotel sucht. Ein 5 Sterne Luxushotel, wie es angekündigt war, ist es jedoch keinesfalls. Hätten wir dieses Hotel als ein 4 Sterne Hotel zu einem entsprechenden Preis gebucht, wären wir durchaus zufrieden gewesen. So aber stimmte leider das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis einfach gar nicht.",4,2014,01,06
19,un soggiorno eccellente,"Bellissimo hotel assolutamente in linea con i requisiti di un 5 stelle. Abbiamo trascorso 5 bellissimi giorni dal 28 dicembre al 1° gennaio. Arredamento moderno, ma non eccessivo, molto caldo e accogliente. Bella terrazza al settimo piano dove abbiamo gustato un'ottima cena. Colazione buona, ottimi sia i dolci che i salati. Posizione centrale, personale estremamente gentile, disponibile, cordiale. Cura del cliente con un atteggiamento professionale, ma mai distaccato. La sera del 31, poiché mio marito si è ammalato (!) ci hanno gentilmente offerto lo spumante e l'uva: 12 chicchi ciascuno serviti in un delizioso sacchettino.Sempre cioccolatino in camera. Ottima pulizia. Ottimi gli snack del frigobar e non cari. Da consigliare e per quanto ci riguarda sicuramente da tornare. Una speciale menzione a Riccardo. Rosanna firenze",5,2014,01,02
19,Hotel Excelente y mejor servicio y ubicación,"Estuve el pasado sabado 14 de diciembre, alojado y desde la llegada el trato dispensado fue exquisito, la habitación fantastica con detalles y sorpresas, la cena en el restaurant de la Terraza fabulosa, ubicación perfecta puedes ir caminando a pasear por paseo de gracía, plaza cataluña, etc..., el desayuno muy completo y muy bien atendidos.
Es un hotel muy aconsejable, un saludo

Rosa y Emilio",5,2013,12,20
19,"Excelente, trato y ubicación","Estuve con unos amigos del 6 al 8 de diciembre, el trato por parte del personal del hotel fué exquisito, tanto por parte de los conserjes, pasando por recepción hasta llegar al jefe de recepción, la situación del hotel fantástica pues casi te da más ventaja no estar en el mismo paseo de Gracia porque te evitas ruido, la calle en la que está situada el hotel es principal pero sin ruido. De reseñar la magnífica terraza de la que pudimos disfrutar un poquito a pesar del fresco, en época de temperatura agradable será fantátisco sitio. También comentar que la atención y el buen hacer del camarero del bar del hotel que nos preparó unos mojitos fantásticos. Vamos que pasamos un fin de semana más que agradable",4,2013,12,13
19,Excelente hotel de lujo en Barcelona,"Viajo mucho por trabajo a Barcelona y desconocia este hotel 5* GL. Desde mi llegada el trato del personal en recepción ha sido extremadamente bueno, el Room Service super rápido y eficiente. Ademas del servicio de limpieza, decoracion original, servicio de desayuno, la propia suite (con baño convertido en todo un spa- con jacuzzi y ducha que se puede convertir en baño turco) todo ello increible, lo más digno de destacar es el elemento humano de todos y cada uno de los trabajadores de este hotel. Todo es exquisita educación, trato personalizado, caras sonrientes. Me suelo hospedar en hoteles de lujo de todo el mundo y es muy dificil encontrar un hotel como este, cumple todo lo que a mi parecer tiene que ofrecer un GL. Y la relacion calidad/precio es mas que excelente. Altamente recomendable!!!!!",5,2013,12,05
19,Una excelente alternativa en Bcn,"Excelente ubicación, a sólo 100 metros de Paseo de Gracia, totalmente aconsejable por el precio y cercanía a la zona de las mejores tiendas.  Os podéis ahorrar tres veces la tarifa de los hoteles situados sobre. P. De gracia y estar tan sólo dos minutos a pie ;)

Habitación cómoda, desayuno muy completo, atención excelente",4,2013,12,01
19,bello,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per il ponte del 31 ottobre e ci siamo trovati benissimo, si trova in un ottima posizione, dalla quale si raggiungono a piedi  Casa Batlo, Casa Pedrera, Piazza Catalunia, La Rambla ecc. La stanza ben arredata e spaziosa, pulita, completa di tutto il necessario. Il personale molto gentile e pronto ad aiutarti. L'unica pecca è la colazione, servita in una sala molto piccola, poco varia e soprattutto il personale poco presente, ci ha fatto attendere circa 20 minuti per portarci poi il contrario di quello che avevamo chiesto. Comunque nel complesso bel posto sicuramente da consigliare.",4,2013,11,08
19,Muy atentos,"Céntrico, muy tranquilo, acogedor,nos sentimos cómodos en  la habitación por las dos zonas una como la sala de televisión o sala de estar y la otra dormitorio y aseo.Lo recomiendo si vas a pasar unos cuantos días en la ciudad. Nos gustó la música en directo en la azotea (finde-semana) En tiempos de espera puedes visitar sus antigüedades egipcias",5,2013,09,13
19,"Sehr guter Service,und geniale Dachterrasse","Unser Zimmer, eine Junior Suite, war grosszügig und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt, sehr nahe der Passeig Gracia und trotzdem in einer ruhigen Nebenstrasse. Das Highlight ist die schöne Dachterrasse, die nach dem Shoppen zum Relaxen einlädt.
Wir hatten einige Sonderwünsche und haben den Front Desk stark strapaziert. Sie waren immer sehr freundlich und kompetent und haben uns sehr geholfen.
Wir kommen sicher wieder in Claris.",5,2013,08,07
19,Bien ubicado pero con muy malos detalles,"El hotel esta a una cuadra de Paseo de Gracia, una excelente ubicación lamentablemente una serie de pequeños detalles que no te hacen regresar, lo único que vale la pena es su excelente Restaurant la terraza donde tienen una excelente propuesta gastronómica y una buena selección de vinos y el servicio es excelente",3,2013,07,21
19,Quasi perfetto,"Splendido hotel al cento di Barcellona quasi tutto a portata di mano dai trasporti a degli ottimi ristoranti e per lo shopping c' è solo l'imbarazzo della scelta.L'hotel è moderno nuovo e bellissimo ,le stanze accoglienti e fornite di ogni confort non manca assolutamente nulla,la sera la governante ci sistemava il letto lo scendiletto e le ciabattine dell'hotel lascia un dolcetto della buona notte e va via lasciando il suo numero a disposizione h24 non so se è cosi per tutte le stanze o solo in alcune ma comunque,se volete un po di lusso un po di vizi un posto speciale e un'accoglienza altrettanto speciale è per voi.IO sicuramente tornerò l'ho adorato.",5,2013,07,11
19,Le falta un poco,"He pasado un fin de semana con mi familia en este hotel, y en general la opinión es buena, pero creo que hay algunos aspectos a mejorar.
El desayuno buffet es un poco escaso, pero no de cantidad sino de variedad, le faltan muchas cosas que creo que un hotel de esta categoría debería tener.
Las habitaciones a niveles generales están bien exceptuando que son un poco pequeñas, aunque eso era algo que ya sabía, pero la colocación de la televisón respecto a la cama no es la más correcta, vi 3 habitaciones y en todas están colocadas respecto al pequeño sofa, creo que un sistema para poder moverla y que desde la cama se viera correctamente sería muy util.
Lo mejor de este hotel es la ubicación.",3,2013,07,09
19,Un trato excelente!,"No sólo la ubicación, la comida, y la decoración son excelentes. Lo que ha hecho de nuestro evento un éxito, sobre todo, ha sido el trato recibido por parte del staff del Claris.
Por supuesto la ubicación, a una calle de Paseo de Gracia, hizo que toda la gente estuviera aún más a gusto, pues puedes salir de compras y volver para descansar sin problemas.",5,2013,07,08
19,Gran decepción,"Tras visitar el hotel Banke de la misma cadena y categoría inferior, decidimos reservar en este hotel de 5 estrellas GL en Barcelona. Desde el momento de nuestra llegada todo fue decepcionante. Aunque realmente mi critica no sé si será contra el hotel, la cadena o contra el organismo catalán que regula la categoría de los hoteles. El parking era sucio e incómodo. Las habitaciones pequeñas (ya sé que cumplen con la normativa, pero tal vez haya que revisar esas regulaciones) El baño pequeño, incómodo y la bañera (no había ducha cosa que en algunas autonomías es exigible en un hotel de estas características ) era resbaladiza, estrecha y muy alta para alguien como yo (mido 1,60 m), un auténtico peligro que viendo el gusto del propietario por el arte egipcio debía querer asemejar un sarcófago. El wifi no funcionaba con todos los servidores, como era nuestro caso con el correo de la empresa (cosa que en París no nos pasó) y si querías acceder debías contratar el wifi de pago. En la sala de desayuno la camarera debía encontrarse en prácticas y no hablar el español, cuando sirvió el café tuvimos que decirle basta hasta tres veces, y cuando le dijimos que retirara la taza y nos pusiera otra para que nos echara menos café no nos entendió. El aire acondicionado a pesar de estar en off seguía emitiendo aire frío, debajo de la cama había,en unos cestillos, unas almohadas adicionales, al sacarlas encontramos una cucaracha fosilizada (igual tenía un valor histórico como los recortes de kilims de supuesto gran valor y no menos suciedad). Por cierto, y con esto acabo porque no quiero alargarme mas, en una entrevista al Sr. Clos, este dijo que le gustaban los baños grandes en los hoteles, de esto deduzco que pocas veces irá a sus establecimientos o en caso de alojarse en ellos no se encontrará nada cómodo.",2,2013,06,18
19,Mi última estancia durante la Semana Santa,Es dificil encontrar en el mundo un hotel de las caracteristicas del Claris. Su coleccion privada de arte y arte egipcio le confieren una calidad practicamente inigualable. El servicio es excepcional y la calidad de la estancia superior. Su localizacion tan centrica en Barcelona le dan el valor añadido que no necesita.,5,2013,04,18
19,Bien ubicado,"Me aloje dos noches con mi hija adolescente, quien quedo fascinada con la decoracion. A mi tambien me parecio muy linda aunque un poco oscura para mi gusto. La ubicacion es excelente y el personal es bastante atento.  Lo recomiendo.",5,2013,04,10
19,OTTIMO LIVELLO,"e già la quarta volta che soggiorniamo in questo hotel, livello veramente ottimo, pulito, colazione di buon livello, personale molto accogliente, camere ben insonorizzate, accettano anche i piccoli cani, ci ritoniamo volentieri",5,2013,04,09
19,Lo mejor la ubicacion,"El hotel esta excelentemente ubicado, junto a la meior zona de Paseo de Gracia. Por supuesto tiene parking, pero como en general en Barcelona muy caro (unos 35€...); las plazas son un poco estrechas. Destacaria en positivo el servicio y la atencion; desde el conserje, pasando por todos los recepcionistas y todo el personal en general te hacen sentir comodo y excelentemente atendido, pero sin el agobio tipico de esta categoria de hotel. La habitacion (la nuestra era la basica) esta bien decorada y es muy agradable, pero claramente pequeña, especialmente el baño, para un 5*GL. Se echan de menos algunos ammenities en el baño. El desayuno esta bien, con productos de excelente calidad, pero la variedad es menor de lo que esperarias y ademas el personal repone muy despacio, con lo que a ratos el bufete ha llegado a estar casi vacio. Muy coqueta la piscina de la azotea. Destacar algo que no publicitan mucho pero nos ha parecido genial y hemos aprovechado, que son smarts de cortesia para recorrer la ciudad a tu gusto.
En resumen muy buen hotel pero mejorable. Genial el prestamo sin coste del smart.",4,2013,03,29
19,"Topp Zimmer, topp Lage, Frühstück war nix!","Wer etwas Leben vor und in der Nähe des Hotels sucht, ist hier genau richtig. 4 Blocks bis zum Zentrum und nur eine Straße zum guten Shopping. Am Abend die geniale Dachterasse genießen und auf geht´s zum nächsten Club, ob zu Fuß oder mit dem Taxi.

Ich persönlich fand das Zimmer extrem stylisch und mit Blick auf die Kreuzung hatte es echt Scharm. Das Personal hat einem sogar noch das Bett vor dem Schlafen hergerichtet inkl. Zimmer verdunkeln usw.

Das Frühstück war hingegen für das Geld schwach! Die Bedienung brauchte 30 Minuten für ein Rührei, da war der halbe Tag weg. Das sollte man lassen und in einer der vielen Cafés frühstücken.

Ich sicher wieder - nur ohne Frühstück!",4,2013,03,15
19,Casi todo perfecto..!,"Acabo de pasar cinco dias en este hotel y tengo que decir, que me he ido muy contenta. A parte de la ubicacion ideal, me gusta mucho el estilo..., una mezcla entre un pasado historico y un diseño moderno de mucha clase. Tambien se tiene que destacar la atención amable y simpatico del personal, dispuesto a asistir y ayudar en cada momento. El restaurante en la terraza de la ultima planta tiene que ser espectacular en verano. Pero como he dicho ""casi todo perfecto!"", me gustaria mecionar que el precio de 23.-- Euro para el desayuno es exagerado. Estoy viajando mucho y es uno de los precios mas altos que he visto. Tambien considero que se tendria ofrecer la opcion de eligir entre ""Full Breakfast"" y un ""Continental"" a un precio mas bajo, para las personas que no quieren llenar tanto a primera hora. Pero, en total, estoy segura de volver varias veces a este hotel, siendo Barcelona una de mis ciudades preferidas. Margaret.St.",5,2013,01,20
19,La classe non è acqua...,"Soggiornare all'Hotel Claris è diventata ormai una prassi per noi durante il capodanno ed è di buon augurio. Temperature, atmosfere, servizi, gentilezza e riservatezza del personale, ci fanno sentire proprio a casa, anche in termini di sicurezza.  Personale estremamente cortese anche con le famiglie con bebè. Buon rapporto qualità/prezzo. Ottima pulizia delle camere, inclusa la biancheria , sempre pulita e profumata. Bella la piscina ed il solurium in terrazza. Un pò piccolo il fitness center , ma tutto sommato  proporzionato alle dimensioni dell'Hotel. Il ristorante in terrazzo è adeguato al blasone dell'Hotel, ma un pò caro. Bella l'architettura dell'Hotel, consone ad un luogo come Barcellona. Quest'anno la nostra visita al Claris è saltata all'ultimo minuto in quanto nostra figlia era malata, ma il prossimo anno sicuramente ci torneremo.",5,2013,01,01
19,Un clásico en forma,"Fantástica estancia de fin de semana. Noche del 15 al 16 de diciembre. Límpio, tranquilo, acojedor. Habitación confortable, con TV alucinante (40""??) y todos los detalles necesarios. Instalaciones al dia, no acusan paso del tiempo. Desayuno impecable, internacional, con productos de primera calidad y, mención especial merece su servicio: camareros de gran profesionalidad, atentos, discretos y sin perder detalle. Eso si que es un lujo.Solo un pequeñisimo detalle: con café Nespresso seria de 11. Ahora solo 10.",5,2012,12,19
19,Habitaciones enanas para un 5*,"Moderno, arquitectura y decoración preciosa, habitaciones muy masculinas pero el tamaño de la habitación estándar es enana para su categoría, así como el baño. Puedes seleccionar una duplex por más precio, la verdad poco cómodo en 2 plantas. Mejor otro hotel de su categoría.",2,2012,12,19
19,Ottimo hotel in centro,Prima volta qui ma con tariffa speciale e trattamento vip con stanza junior suite e colazione compresa. Molto silenzioso forse in estate con più gente rimane più rumore ! Suggerisco di cambiare i prodotti da bagno che sono scadenti per un hotel 5*GL no si può accettare. Ottimo il turn down service.,4,2012,10,30
19,Una atencion perfecta. Muy recomendable.,"Solo hemos pasado una noche. Nos hubiera gustado estar mas dias. Nos sentimos muy bien atendidos. La habitacion amplia y comoda. El desayuno muy completo. Cenamos en el mismo hotel. Una terraza muy agradable, pese a que nos lloviera. A un paso de Paseo de Gracia.",5,2012,10,23
19,Niente da dichiarare: contro,"Condivido i giudizi entusiastici per struttura, location, professionalità e gentilezza del personale, favolose colazioni, smart (courtesy car) a disposizione degli ospiti. Temperature, atmosfere, servizi. Una sicurezza!  Infatti ci siamo tornati per la seconda volta.",5,2012,09,08

19,Signori si nasce,"Ringrazio anche in questa occasione l'upgrade fatto senza battere ciglio da junior suite a suite. Un miniappartamento con sauna in camera. Effettivamente Signori si nasce. Questo Hotel dive stars GL nel cuore di Barcellona offre servizi di concierge all'altezza della città in perenne movimento culturale e sociale. Al primo piano un mini museo egizio (il proprietario della ergo é anche il proprietario dell'unico museo egizio della città. Gli ospiti possono visitarlo gratis. E godere di alcuni pezzi di più di 3000 anni fa nei corridoi dell'albergo, nelle sale ai piani, e negli spazi comuni.
Colazione memorabile. Per le cene peró tranne casi strepitosi di cucine di albergo migliori della città (es. Portixolo in Mallorca) é bene fare due passi e godersi Barcellona by night.
Nel complesso uno dei migliori alberghi che ho visitato.
Mi spiace che ad alcuni sia andata male: es riscaldamento in inverno che quel giorno non andava o altre stanze non all'altezza dei sogni. Fatevele cambiare. Ricordatevi che il vostro desiderio si basa anche su un rapporto contrattuale che tutti i contraenti devono rispettare. Buon soggiorno a tutti.",5,2012,08,17
19,Volveremos,"Pasamos una noche en junio 2012 en ese magnifico hotel , y volvimos otra vez en julio-2012 para pasar dos noches mas.
Queremos dar las gracias por la atención recibida en todo el hotel, empezando por la recepsion , el botones y resto de el
Personal. El desayuno exquisito, la terraza una maravilla y la cantidad de detalles hacen que uno se sienta realmente bien.
Finalmente la ubicación, perfecta para hacer compras o visitar lugares de interés.",5,2012,07,15
19,Non vale 5 stelle...,Non aspettatevi effusioni...il personale è piuttosto indifferente. Un pomeriggio senz'acqua...inconcepibile per un 5 stelle. La reception è composta da un tavolino con due sedie (forse per via dei lavori in corso...). Ventilazione nel bagno pressocchè inesistente. Lavandino mezzo intasato. La finestra si chiude a malappena. Rumori dalle stanze vicine. Non vale tutti quei soldi spesi. Fate conto di stare in un buon 4 stelle Italiano.,2,2012,05,04
19,Finger weg!!!!!,"Lage ok, Lobby superschön, ebenso die Dachterasse! ABER: Wir hatten die Junior-Suite gebucht- das sind 2 Zimmer eng und schlauchförmig angelegt mit Blick auf den Hinterhof. Wir konnten unsere Nachbarn duschen, reden, schnarchen etc. hören. Der Schimmel an der Decke im Badezimmer wurde offensichtlich mit einer Zwischendecke abgedeckt. Die kaputten Armaturen, die schlechten Ausbesserungsarbeiten im gesamten Bad waren nicht einladend. Es gibt 2 deutschsprachige TV-Kanäle: ARD und Eurosport.... Es gibt billigere und schönere Hotels um jede Ecke. Dieses Hotel hat unseren Urlaub wirklich getrübt....wird als 5 Sterne GL verkauft....unglaublich!!",2,2012,04,10
19,Sicuramente da ritornarci,"Posizione strategica, vicino al Passeig de Gracia e alla Rambla. Bellissima hall e tre ascensori a vista in vetro. Personale gentilissimo. Camera non grandissima, ma molto pulita e dotata di ogni comfort. Bagno con bidé e set di cortesia di prima categoria. Accappatoi e ciabattine fantastici. Colazione con ogni ben di dio con un cameriere molto simpatico e disponibile (ha accettato i nostri consigli di come fare un vero espresso macchiato italiano). Sulla terrazza la piscina e ristorante-bar. Lo consigliamo vivamente.",5,2012,03,18
19,Para volver otra vez,"Nos gusto mucho, más céntrico no puede ser, todo lo hicimos andando es como se conoce ya que íbamos por 3 noches, comer en restaurante de hotel fue delicioso, tiene un menú exquisito, barato-calidad-precio. El trato en todo el aspecto cordial y amable. Cogimos un buen precio.",4,2012,03,17
19,Calidad/precio - super amables,"Enfin un hotel que entiende como captar a sus clientes: upgrading a habitaciones que no tienen reserva. Personal muy amable. Desayuno lujo asiatico en servicio y diversidad. Ubicacion perfecta. Baños un poco viejos, pero para un 5 GL, precio de ganga. Una terraza que en verano tiene que ser una pasada. Para negocios o unos dias en Barcelona, lo perfecto. Ya no iré más a hoteles de 4* en Barcelona.",5,2012,03,03
19,un ex 5 stelle,"Hotel che si attribuisce 5 stelle dove a  gennaio non funziona il riscaldamento, forse merita al massimo solo 2 stelle!  Lo staff è  molto gentile e ci ha offerto una stufetta elettrica da mettere in camera, ma che tristezza prenotare un 5 stelle gl e ritrovrasi con la stufetta in camera, cose da barboni! (meglio soffrire il freddo),  inoltre la camera non corrispondeva a quella prenotata sul sito dell'hotel!

Hotel da evitare meglio un 4 stelle",1,2012,01,07
19,"Tanta bellezza, con tanto di ""neo""","L'hotel è in una posizione veramente strategica, vicino a casa Battlo e alla Pedrera (due opere d'arte di Gaudì) ed a pochi passi dai negozi più ""in"" della città. 
L'ambiente è molto trendy, soprattutto se vi spingete all'ultimo piano dove c'è una piscina e una terrazza mozzafiato con ristorante.
Tutto il personale è molto gentile, disponibile e capace di parlare diverse lingue fluentemente.
Quale è il ""neo""?
Come tutte le vere bellezze, ci vuole un piccolo neo e a nostro avviso è il wifi a pagamento:
15€ per 24 ore, anche nella Hall! 
Davvero anacronistico, visto il costo medio di una camera e soprattutto la consuetudine ormai diffusa di molti Hotel, con molte meno stelle, ad offrirlo gratuitamente.",4,2012,01,02
19,ottimo,"Non male , un filo caro ma ottimo hotel in pieno centro di Barcelona.
Per un viaggio di lavoro, Salone Nautico, è stato ottimo peccato non avere utilizzato le varie strutture interne.

19,Las comodidades de un gran hotel en ambiente funcional.,"Pasamos un fin de semana en Marzo.
Nos ubicaron en una preciosa habitación con grandes ventanales también en el cuarto de baño.
Muy buena situación para recorrer la ciudad paseando.
Es sencillo y a la vez elegante, edificio reformado con mucha elegancia y simplicidad.
Nos sentimos en todo momento bien atendidos.
Ciertamente, recomendable.",5,2011,11,06
19,Lo staff e' sempre all'altezza,"La prima Volta Che ho soggiornato al Claris Fu nel 2003 e credo Che fosse stato da poco aperto. L'impressione Ed il ricordo furono ottime. Ci torno dopo Otto Anni e mi continua a dare la stessa sensazione anche se il tempo pass a anche per lui e la crisi si fa sentire. Le camera, anche se ottime, soon un po' povere ma nulla di grave. Sconsiglio le camere sul davanti per chi come me AMA il silenzio.",4,2011,09,24
19,Lástima del servicio de la terraza de verano.......,"Nos alojamos en este hotel por su terraza de verano. Es bonita, música en directo... pero nos falló lo básico: El servicio !!!!! y concretamente su responsable. Cuando se atiende al público en un establecimiento de esta categoría, sobra el endiosamiento y la arrogancia.
Nos resultó terriblemente antipático, y claro, estropeó el resto del entrono: un buen mojito y buena música...  El equipo de la terraza tiene mucho que aprender sobre ofrecer un buen servicio. Una lástima......",2,2011,09,03
19,Gran ubicacion y excelente servicio,"Acabamos de volver del Claris y realmente, muy contentos. La ubicación del hotel es perfecta para visitar la ciudad. No necesitar coger el coche para nada. 
Fantástica terraza, con muy buen servicio y musica en vivo.
Habitacion justita en tamaño pero limpia.
Recalcar el excelente staff de recepción, en especial a Victoria, que nos ayudo mucho durante nuestra estancia, y César, del que nos impresionó sus conocimientos profesionales ( le comentamos un problema y sin haberselo pedido, al regresar al hotel nos lo habia solucionado ) y su ""mano"" con los niños.
Un saludo",5,2011,08,12
19,"Ormai ""siamo di casa""!!!!!!!!!!","L'hotel Claris è situato in posizione strategica, vicino casa Battlo e la Pedrera (Gaudì) ed a poche decini di metri dalla via più elegante di Barcellona: Paseo de Gracia. L'hotel è modernissimo, le camere spaziose e pulite, il personale della reception cordiale e preparato per far fronte a tutte le esigenze della clientela. Il bagno è accessoriato di tutto (accappatoio, ciabattine, prodotti di toletta, phon e bidet!). Io prendo sempre la camera duplex (ha un salotto rialzato con una seconda televisione). Spesso si internet si trovano promozioni. Ha un buon rapporto qualità/prezzo. Assolutamente da consigliare (in estate ha anche una piccola ma ben tenuta piscina in terrazza con un bel bar ed una stupenda vista della città).",5,2011,08,02
19,Kein wirkliches 5-Sterne-Haus,"Das Hotel liegt strategisch gut hat allerdings etliche Schwaechen.
Der Fernseher geht in der Regel alle 5-10min von alleine aus. Das ist zu beheben indem man den Stecker zieht und wieder anschliesst. Das geht dann alle 5min so... Kommentar des Hotels: das ist normal.....
Das Frühstück ist mit 21 EUR definitiv zu teuer.
Es ist leider sehr laut in den Zimmern - die Fenster bieten keine gute Laermdaemmung.",3,2011,07,27
19,A un paso de excelente,"Personalmente creo que la categoria 5 GL es un poco excesiva, me explico. Aun con una ubicacion excelente, un servicio (recepcion, concierge, restauracion, servicio de limpieza,...) excelente y unas habitaciones excelentes respecto al tamaño, creo que le falta algo para ser un GL, tal vez un toque extra en la decoracion de las habitaciones, una pequeña renovacion de suelos (nuestra habitacion tenia suelos de madera de alta calidad pero que notan el paso del tiempo), no se algo ""palido"" en el ambiente. Siempre desde la critica constructiva, considero al hotel una muy buena opcion en la ciudad.",5,2011,06,13
19,Exelente atencion y ubicacion,"Las habitaciones son muy confortables, el servicio del personal es inmejorable, ambiente tranquilo, relajado y esta en exelente ubicacion. Definitivamente regresariamos.",5,2011,05,28
19,"""Tutto fumo e niente...""","Appena tornati da Barcellona, soggiornato al Claris, chiesto e pagato per una junior ci assegnano una duplex...e vabbè, stanza rumorosa (il bagno del vicino era praticamente nella nostra stanza), spazi angusti, pavimento in parquet che aveva visto tempi migliori, scarico del bagno tre volte guasto...in poche parole 4 stelle appena guadagnate. Poi mi chiedo: ma se il Claris ha 5 stelle GL, il Mandarin Oriental quante ne deve avere???",3,2011,05,18
19,Ubicación perfecta,"El hotel está muy bien situado, al lado del Mayestic, y del paseo de Gracia, ideal para ir de compras. El hotel es muy bonito en su arquitectura interior, pero en cambio, para mi gusto, las habitaciones no son tan bonitas. Eso sí en el hotel tienen sus detalles (nos pusieron una botella de vino).
El desayuno es normalillo. Yo fui con una buena oferta y me quedé satisfecha.",4,2011,04,15
19,ottimo hotel,"un ottimo hotel. forse non 5 stelle lusso, ma un 5 stelle!
le parti comuni sono piu lussuose delle camere standard (ma per il prezzo concorrenziale va benissimo)
ultimo piano con piscina (sebbene chiusa) è stupendo anche per l'aperitivo
personale disponibilissimo, gentile, cortese , ineccepibile.
posizione strategica, dietro la strada del lusso
lo consiglierei!",4,2011,03,07
19,hotel di lusso,"Hotel di lusso con bellissime suite divise in due categorie con e senza balcone.
Piscina sul tetto, due ascensori e un piccolo museo di pezzi egizi antichi.
Si trova nel centro di barcellona con tutti i servizi a portata di mano.
Consigliamo di effettuare la visita della città con il bus turist che tocca tutti i punti importanti musei, cattedrale, piazze, opere di gaudì ecc.",5,2011,02,24
19,perfecto para estar en el centro y muy confortable,"Hotel muy recomendable si buscas un hotel céntrico....está al lado del Paseo de Gracia, una de las mejores avenidas de Barcelona. Habitación y aseo muy correcto para un 5 estr. quizás el ""G.L."" me parece excesivo....Estuvimos muy bien atendidos por todo el personal que había en abundancia, lo cual no es muy normal en epoca de crísis....El precio tarifa es un poco caro, pero adecuado si vas con alguna oferta. Por ponerle alguna pega, sería perfecto si tuviese SPA....ah!!! y otra cosa que eché en falta es ""cava"" en el desayuno....está en casi todos los hoteles incluso en los de menos categoria y en cataluña tenemos la obligación (moral) de hacer pais con nuestros maravillosos cavas. Sería de agradecer que este Hotel lo incluyese!!!!",4,2011,02,17
19,troppe stelle!,"ma come fa questo hotel (poco più che modesto) a risultare un 5 stelle GL?
di ottimo livello ha solo la posizione!
le stanze sono normalmente pulite ma al povero e spennato viaggiatore si pone subito l'arduo dilemma: 1) avere una stanza più luminosa sul lato esterno con il gran rumore prodotto h24 dal gran traffico di Barcellona; oppure 2) privilegiare il sonno, ma trovarsi in una stanza praticamente buia (quelle sul lato interno).
il personale di servizio è gentile, ma quello del roof garden (scontroso e inospitale) fa abbassare la media!
per evitare di rimanere delusi consiglio di prenotare un buon 3 stelle!",2,2011,02,13
19,Excelente hotel,"Cada año para el dia de San Valentin, buscamos un bonito hotel donde pasar el fin de semana, vamos siempre con otra pareja y este año escogimos el HOTEL CLARIS en Barcelona, un 5 * G.L. aprovechamos una buena oferta y acertamos de pleno con el hotel. Muy céntrico y bien comunicado, habitaciones grandes y confortables, cama King Size, amenities y complementos  en el baño de calidad, el personal muy atentos y amables, desde el aparcacoches y botones hasta la recepción, sin olvidarnos de los camareros y el ""barman"",  un tipo agradable y conocedor de su oficio.
El desayuno exquisito, no falta casi  nada, los platos calientes preparados y servidos en la mesa.
Como anécdota  final,  tengo que decir que la cadena propiedad del hotel, cuenta con el mayor museo egipcio privado de Cataluña, y como no podía ser de otra manera, los clientes del hotel pueden entrar gratuitamente.
P.D. en la 1º planta del hotel, hay una pequeña representación del museo egipcio.",5,2011,02,13
19,Experiencia positiva,"Hotel céntrico, tranquilo y el personal amable y atento.",4,2011,01,14
19,OTTIMO HOTEL,"E' la terza volta che soggiorno in questo hotel per affari e mi trovo sempre molto bene.
Comodo per raggiungere gli uffici che mi interessano nel centro di Barcellona.
Questa volta ho soggiornato in una JS e la camera devo dire era molto bella, comoda e con ottime finiture.
L'unica pecca che ho notato è stato che aprendo la finestra la visuale è molto brutta: a due mt. di distanza dalla finestra c'è un muro che da su un vicolo maleodorante; sinceramente parlando sono stato anche in camere base che guardavano l'incrocio del Pau Claris e anche se erano finestre piccole la visuale era molto migliore.
Come ho scritto non ero a Barcellona per piacere ma per affari e comunque ritrovarsi un muro a due mt. dall'apertura finestra non era piacevole (dava un senso di prigione).
Ripeto la JS ottima ma la visuale pessima per quel tipo di camera/prezzo (anche se a quella maniera era molto silenziosa!!!).
Lo consiglierò vivamente e ritornerò sicuramente.",4,2010,11,24
19,"Buen hotel pero le sobra una estrella y el ""GL""",Hotel muy céntrico y tranquilo. Personal muy eficiente y amable. La habitación y el baño un poco justo de medidas. Se le van notando los años en su decoración.,3,2010,11,03
19,Unbedingt im Sommer buchen!,Das Hotel Claris überzeugt in erster Linie durch die nette Dachterasse incl. kleinem Pool. Toller Ausblick! Genau passend nach einer Stadttour hier nachmittags zu entspannen und sich auf den Abend einzustellen. Shoppingarea ist gleich in der Parallelstrasse und selbst die Rambla ist gut zu Fuß erreichbar. Zimmer sind teilweise relativ steril gehalten und beim Betreten stark klimatisiert. Ansonsten wird sehr viel Wert auf Kunstobjekte gelegt. Frühstück würde ich in einer der nahegelegen Bodegas einnehmen. Hat mehr Flair.,4,2010,10,09
19,Hotel deludente per essere un 5 stelle,"Un discreto 3 stelle , niente di più niente di meno : camera bella ma  piccola , letto duro  , finestre mal sigilate e rumorose ( per fortuna il rumore non mi disturba il sonno ma era come dormire nell'incrocio sottostante) . Connessione  internet (solo wireless ) a PAGAMENTO !!!!! per la modica somma di 15 Euro ogni 45 minuti !!!!!!! Non mi hanno cambiato gli asciugamani quando ( come da loro istruzioni) li ho lasciati per terra per segnalare la richiesta di cambio . Niente TV satellitare , solo 2 canali italiani ( RAI 2 e RAI 3 ...... ).
Parcheggio a pagamento caro ...23 Euro a notte. Bella terrazza con micropiscina .
Personale molto gentile ( unica nota positiva)",1,2010,08,25

19,Excelente Noche de Bodas,"Estuvimos en el Claris, hace quince días, para celebrar nuestro aniversario de Bodas, y tengo que decir que fue fantástico. La Situación del Hotel, inmejorable, el servicio muy atento, la habitación espectacular. Cenamos en la terraza y el ambiente fue muy especial y romántico. Mi mujer quedó encantada y para mi era lo más importante. Ha sido una experiencia maravillosa y lo recomiendo 100%.",5,2010,06,14
19,Excelente !!!!!!!,"He pasado un fin de semana con mi pareja y ha sido mi mejor experiencia en un Hotel.
Un Palacio en el centro de la ciudad, excelente staff , restaurante de la Terraza y piscina impresionantes, habitaciones amplias y muy bien decoradas.

Por supuesto que volveré !!!!!!",5,2010,06,13

Excelente comida en su pequeño restaurant

19,"nie wieder - schlecht, teuer","die negativen Kritiken hier sind durchaus berechtigt. Ich war sehr enttäuscht und teilweise fassungslos. Die Betten sind zu KURZ für Menschen ab 1,85m/ das einzige Fenster lässt sich nicht öffnen, wir hatten vier Tage keine Frischluft/Reinigungspersonal schlampig, jeden Tag etwas vergessen, mal Handtücher, mal Abfall/ das Standard-Zimmer insgesamt winzig, 4Stern-Hotels bieten üblicherweise mehr, und das soll ein 5Stern sein/ Klingel vor jedem Zimmer, die leider zwei Mal, vermutlich vom Reinigungspersonal, gegen 9h betätigt wurde/ definitv zu teuer etc. 
Das einzig positive, die Lage.",1,2010,04,14
19,El mejor capital que tiene este hotel es su personal,"Sin grandes pretensiones de lujo, muy limpio  y una decoración con tendencia a hotel boutique, el Hotel Claris cuenta con un personal único, con  excelente disposición de ánimo a  la hora de satisfacer las necesidades de su clientela, merecen especial mención el gerente del mismo señor José Luis Fernández, el personal que atiende el desayuno, la recepción  y la concierge señora  Emma del Valle con amplísimo conocimiento del inglés, alemán, francés ,italiano y por supuesto el castellano,  ella conoce la ciudad  de Barcelona  y sus alrededores en toda su extensión recomendando los mejores lugares tanto en la rama gastronómica, como en la variopinta gama cultural y turística. Por lo que a nosotros respecta la relación precio calidad fue bien retribuida",4,2010,02,22

19,Decepcionante,"Acabo de pasar un fin de semana en el hotel y he quedado muy decepcionado de su calidad. La habitación estaba en un estado lamentable; sucia (con mucho polvo), mobiliario muy deteriorado, una alfombra que no utilizaría ni como felpudo, en general, una habitación que no ofrecería ni un hotel de 3 estrellas. En cuanto a la atención del personal, buena y en cuanto a los servicios, solo disfrute del buffet del desayuno y este fue muy bueno.
Como conclusión decir que es un hotel al que no volveré y tampoco recomendaré.",1,2009,09,28
19,No es tan lujoso como lo pintan,"Hotel correcto sin más, lo venden como gran lujo y se pasan , al llegar nos dieron una habitación tipo tres estrellas, interior y pequeña, nos quejamos y mejor .",3,2009,09,24
19,un ottimo hotel,"abbiamo trascorso tre giorni al Claris dal 9 al 11 settembre. Le camere son ben rifinite, il servizio è ineccepibile, il personale disponibile e simpatico, nemmeno troppo formale, insomma gradevole. Colazione a buffet cara ma assolutamente ineccepibile. In conclusione un'ottima scelta che vale il prezzo non proprio economico in verità. A 10 minuti a piedi da Placa de Catalunia. A due minuti dalla stazione del treno Renfe (metro leggera) che arriva dall'aeroporto Prad. Consigliato.",5,2009,09,13
19,No se merece la clasificación de 5 estrellas GL y menos aun pertenecer a SLHW,"Deja mucho que desear tanto en las habitaciones, como en el desayuno, como en la atención, los espacios comunes, .... 
Lo mejor la zona y el edificio por fuera. El resto es un hotel de 4 estrellas.",3,2009,09,10
19,Sempre all'altezza,"E' la seconda volta che alloggio al Claris, c'ero già stata ad agosto 2008.
Allora prenotai due suite, eccellenti, quest'anno era tutto pieno ed ho trovato due matrimoniali standard.
La mia sorpresa è stata che erano ampie, con tutti i confort e rifinite in maniera eccellente.
Il Claris è a 100 m dal Paseo de Gracia, zona dello shopping chic e comunque centralissimo.
Ha una piscina sul terrazzo, che seppure piccola, invita ad un tuffo tra una visita e l'altra alla città.
Anche il ristorante sulla terrazza, oltre che bello, serve piatti deliziosi, spesso è pieno e bisogna prenotare, è un pò caro rispetto ai ristoranti esterni, ma ha dei prezzi veramente concorrenziali se pensate che è un 5 stelle Lusso.
Tutto l'hotel è nuovissimo e pulitissimo.
Il personale è gentile e disponibile ad ogni informazione.
La prima colazione, un pò cara e che si paga a parte, è veramente buonissima ed abbondante, potete sbafarvi finchè volete.
Vi consiglio di prenotarlo direttamente sul sito della catena Derby Hotels, poichè spesso hanno promozioni fantastiche e più vantaggiose rispetto ai tanti siti di prenotazione on line.",5,2009,08,03
19,El mejor hotel en el que he estado,"Gané un concurso y el primero de los premios que me dieron fue una noche en este hotel, con cena degustación y desayuno en la habitación.

Desde que entré por la puerta que aluciné. Nunca había estado en un hotel tan lujoso. 

El hotel me encantó. Y la habitación, impresionante. Era una habitación dúplex!! En la misma habitación había 2 teles y dos baños (uno con ducha y el otro con bañera). En la planta de abajo había uno de los baños y un salón con 2 sofás, una tele plana y una mesa grande con sillas. En la planta de arriba había la cama de matrimonio, otra televisión y otro baño. La habitación era preciosa, limpia, cómoda... genial vamos.

La cena también me encantó. El menú degustación estaba muy bueno e incluso me dejaron cambiar algún plato que no me gustaba. Además, no dejaron de servirnos vinos y cava. Incluso sin haberme terminado el cava de mi copa, me la cambiaron porque decían que ya no estaba frío.

El desayuno que nos subieron a la habitación era abundante y bueno. 

Sin duda, recomiendo este hotel a todo el mundo.",5,2008,10,07
19,Ottimo,"Stanze meravigliose, ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo, posizione eccellente.
Consigliatissimo",5,2007,10,17
19,Nur der Preis erinnert an ein 5 Sterne Hotel...,"Viel zu teuer fuer die gebotene Leistung. Die Zimmer sind o.k. aber nicht extrem luxoriös oder komfortabel. Ich hatte eine Suite, was sich nur in der Gestaltung des Badezimmers niedergeschlagen hat. Hier hatte ich neben einer Eckbadewanne mit Hydromassage auch eine 1-Mann-Sauna. Nett, aber eine funktionierende Klimaanlage wäre mir lieber gewesen. Der Service hat ebenfalls nicht im geringsten einem 5 Sterne Haus entsprochen. Meiner Kollegin wurde nur widerwillig mit dem Gepäck geholfen und auch die sonstige Unterstützung (Taxi bestellen, Koffer Service...) war nicht vorhanden. Es mag sein, dass bei einem privaten Aufenthalt die Annehmlichkeiten (Dach Pool, 1-Mann-Sauna etc) überwiegen, für einen geschäftichen Aufenthalt würde ich nicht nocheinmal im Claris übernachten.
